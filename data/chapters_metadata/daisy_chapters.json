  "content": "The Daisy Chain\nCharlotte M. Yonge\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nNo one can be more sensible than is the Author that the present is an\novergrown book of a nondescript class, neither the “tale” for the young,\nnor the novel for their elders, but a mixture of both.\n\nBegun as a series of conversational sketches, the story outran both\nthe original intention and the limits of the periodical in which it was\ncommenced; and, such as it has become, it is here presented to those who\nhave already made acquaintance with the May family, and may be willing\nto see more of them. It would beg to be considered merely as what it\ncalls itself, a Family Chronicle--a domestic record of home events,\nlarge and small, during those years of early life when the character\nis chiefly formed, and as an endeavour to trace the effects of those\naspirations which are a part of every youthful nature. That the young\nshould take one hint, to think whether their hopes and upward-breathings\nare truly upwards, and founded in lowliness, may be called the moral of\nthe tale.\n\nFor those who may deem the story too long, and the characters too\nnumerous, the Author can only beg their pardon for any tedium that they\nmay have undergone before giving it up. Feb. 22nd, 1856.\n\n\nPART 1.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\n\n     Si douce est la Marguerite.--CHAUCER.\n\n\n\n“Miss Winter, are you busy? Do you want this afternoon? Can you take a\ngood long walk?”\n\n“Ethel, my dear, how often have I told you of your impetuosity--you have\nforgotten.”\n\n“Very well”--with an impatient twist--“I beg your pardon. Good-morning,\nMiss Winter,” said a thin, lank, angular, sallow girl, just fifteen,\ntrembling from head to foot with restrained eagerness, as she tried to\ncurb her tone into the requisite civility.\n\n“Good-morning, Ethel, good-morning, Flora,” said the prim, middle-aged\ndaily governess, taking off her bonnet, and arranging the stiff little\nrolls of curl at the long, narrow looking-glass, the border of which\ndistorted the countenance.\n\n“Good-morning,” properly responded Flora, a pretty, fair girl, nearly\ntwo years older than her sister.\n\n“Will you--” began to burst from Etheldred’s lips again, but was stifled\nby Miss Winter’s inquiry, “Is your mamma pretty well to-day?”\n\n“Oh! very well,” said both at once; “she is coming to the reading.” And\nFlora added, “Papa is going to drive her out to-day.”\n\n“I am very glad. And the baby?”\n\n“I do believe she does it on purpose!” whispered Ethel to herself,\nwriggling fearfully on the wide window-seat on which she had\nprecipitated herself, and kicking at the bar of the table, by which\nmanifestation she of course succeeded in deferring her hopes, by a\nreproof which caused her to draw herself into a rigid, melancholy\nattitude, a sort of penance of decorum, but a rapid motion of the\neyelids, a tendency to crack the joints of the fingers, and an\nunquietness at the ends of her shoes, betraying the restlessness of the\ndigits therein contained.\n\nIt was such a room as is often to be found in old country town houses,\nthe two large windows looking out on a broad old-fashioned street,\nthrough heavy framework, and panes of glass scratched with various names\nand initials. The walls were painted blue, the skirting almost a third\nof the height, and so wide at the top as to form a narrow shelf. The\nfireplace, constructed in the days when fires were made to give as\nlittle heat as possible, was ornamented with blue and white Dutch\ntiles bearing marvellous representations of Scripture history, and was\nprotected by a very tall green guard; the chairs were much of the same\ndate, solid and heavy, the seats in faded carpet-work, but there was a\nsprinkling of lesser ones and of stools; a piano; a globe; a large table\nin the middle of the room, with three desks on it; a small one, and a\nlight cane chair by each window; and loaded book-cases. Flora began, “If\nyou don’t want this afternoon to yourself--”\n\nEthel was on her feet, and open-mouthed. “Oh, Miss Winter, if you would\nbe so kind as to walk to Cocksmoor with us!”\n\n“To Cocksmoor, my dear!” exclaimed the governess in dismay.\n\n“Yes, yes, but hear,” cried Ethel. “It is not for nothing. Yesterday--”\n\n“No, the day before,” interposed Flora.\n\n“There was a poor man brought into the hospital. He had been terribly\nhurt in the quarry, and papa says he’ll die. He was in great distress,\nfor his wife has just got twins, and there were lots of children before.\nThey want everything--food and clothes--and we want to walk and take\nit.”\n\n“We had a collection of clothes ready, luckily,” said Flora; “and we\nhave a blanket, and some tea and some arrowroot, and a bit of bacon, and\nmamma says she does not think it too far for us to walk, if you will be\nso kind as to go with us.”\n\nMiss Winter looked perplexed. “How could you carry the blanket, my\ndear?”\n\n“Oh, we have settled that,” said Ethel, “we mean to make the donkey a\nsumpter-mule, so, if you are tired, you may ride home on her.”\n\n“But, my dear, has your mamma considered? They are such a set of wild\npeople at Cocksmoor; I don’t think we could walk there alone.”\n\n“It is Saturday,” said Ethel, “we can get the boys.”\n\n“If you would reflect a little! They would be no protection. Harry would\nbe getting into scrapes, and you and Mary running wild.”\n\n“I wish Richard was at home!” said Flora.\n\n“I know!” cried Ethel. “Mr. Ernescliffe will come. I am sure he can walk\nso far now. I’ll ask him.”\n\nEthel had clapped after her the heavy door with its shining brass lock,\nbefore Miss Winter well knew what she was about, and the governess\nseemed annoyed. “Ethel does not consider,” said she. “I don’t think your\nmamma will be pleased.”\n\n“Why not?” said Flora.\n\n“My dear--a gentleman walking with you, especially if Margaret is\ngoing!”\n\n“I don’t think he is strong enough,” said Flora; “but I can’t think\nwhy there should be any harm. Papa took us all out walking with him\nyesterday--little Aubrey and all, and Mr. Ernescliffe went.”\n\n“But, my dear--”\n\nShe was interrupted by the entrance of a fine tall blooming girl\nof eighteen, holding in her hand a pretty little maid of five.\n“Good-morning. Miss Winter. I suppose Flora has told you the request we\nhave to make to you?”\n\n“Yes, my dear Margaret, but did your mamma consider what a lawless place\nCocksmoor is?”\n\n“That was the doubt,” said Margaret, “but papa said he would answer for\nit nothing would happen to us, and mamma said if you would be so kind.”\n\n“It is unlucky,” began the governess, but stopped at the incursion of\nsome new-comers, nearly tumbling over each other, Ethel at the head\nof them. “Oh, Harry!” as the gathers of her frock gave way in the\nrude grasp of a twelve-year-old boy. “Miss Winter, ‘tis all right--Mr.\nErnescliffe says he is quite up to the walk, and will like it very much,\nand he will undertake to defend you from the quarrymen.”\n\n“Is Miss Winter afraid of the quarrymen?” hallooed Harry. “Shall I take\na club?”\n\n“I’ll take my gun and shoot them,” valiantly exclaimed Tom; and while\nthreats were passing among the boys, Margaret asked, in a low voice,\n“Did you ask him to come with us?”\n\n“Yes, he said he should like it of all things. Papa was there, and said\nit was not too far for him--besides, there’s the donkey. Papa says it,\nso we must go, Miss Winter.”\n\nMiss Winter glanced unutterable things at Margaret, and Ethel began to\nperceive she had done something wrong. Flora was going to speak, when\nMargaret, trying to appear unconscious of a certain deepening colour in\nher own cheeks, pressed a hand on her shoulder, and whispering, “I’ll\nsee about it. Don’t say any more, please,” glided out of the room.\n\n“What’s in the wind?” said Harry. “Are many of your reefs out there,\nEthel?”\n\n“Harry can talk nothing but sailors’ language,” said Flora, “and I am\nsure he did not learn that of Mr. Ernescliffe. You never hear slang from\nhim.”\n\n“But aren’t we going to Cocksmoor?” asked Mary, a blunt downright girl\nof ten.\n\n“We shall know soon,” said Ethel. “I suppose I had better wait till\nafter the reading to mend that horrid frock?”\n\n“I think so, since we are so nearly collected,” said Miss Winter; and\nEthel, seating herself on the corner of the window-seat, with one leg\ndoubled under her, took up a Shakespeare, holding it close to her\neyes, and her brother Norman, who, in age, came between her and Flora,\nkneeling on one knee on the window-seat, and supporting himself with one\narm against the shutter, leaned over her, reading it too, disregarding a\ntumultuous skirmish going on in that division of the family collectively\ntermed “the boys,” namely, Harry, Mary, and Tom, until Tom was suddenly\npushed down, and tumbled over into Ethel’s lap, thereby upsetting\nher and Norman together, and there was a general downfall, and a loud\nscream, “The sphynx!”\n\n“You’ve crushed it,” cried Harry, dealing out thumps indiscriminately.\n\n“No, here ‘tis,” said Mary, rushing among them, and bringing out a green\nsphynx caterpillar on her finger--“‘tis not hurt.”\n\n“Pax! Pax!” cried Norman, over all, with the voice of an authority,\nas he leaped up lightly and set Tom on his legs again. “Harry! you had\nbetter do that again,” he added warningly. “Be off, out of this window,\nand let Ethel and me read in peace.”\n\n“Here’s the place,” said Ethel--“Crispin, Crispian’s day. How I do like\nHenry V.”\n\n“It is no use to try to keep those boys in order!” sighed Miss Winter.\n\n“Saturnalia, as papa calls Saturday,” replied Flora.\n\n“Is not your eldest brother coming home to-day?” said Miss Winter in a\nlow voice to Flora, who shook her head, and said confidentially, “He\nis not coming till he has passed that examination. He thinks it better\nnot.”\n\nHere entered, with a baby in her arms, a lady with a beautiful\ncountenance of calm sweetness, looking almost too young to be the mother\nof the tall Margaret, who followed her. There was a general hush as she\ngreeted Miss Winter, the girls crowding round to look at their little\nsister, not quite six weeks old.\n\n“Now, Margaret, will you take her up to the nursery?” said the\nmother, while the impatient speech was repeated, “Mamma, can we go to\nCocksmoor?”\n\n“You don’t think it will be too far for you?” said the mother to Miss\nWinter as Margaret departed.\n\n“Oh, no, not at all, thank you, that was not--But Margaret has\nexplained.”\n\n“Yes, poor Margaret,” said Mrs. May, smiling. “She has settled it by\nchoosing to stay at home with me. It is no matter for the others, and he\nis going on Monday, so that it will not happen again.”\n\n“Margaret has behaved very well,” said Miss Winter.\n\n“She has indeed,” said her mother, smiling. “Well, Harry, how is the\ncaterpillar?”\n\n“They’ve just capsized it, mamma,” answered Harry, “and Mary is making\nall taut.”\n\nMrs. May laughed, and proceeded to advise Ethel and Norman to put away\nHenry V., and find the places in their Bibles, “or you will have the\nthings mixed together in your heads,” said she.\n\nIn the meantime Margaret, with the little babe, to-morrow to be her\ngodchild, lying gently in her arms, came out into the matted hall, and\nbegan to mount the broad shallow-stepped staircase, protected by low\nstout balusters, with a very thick, flat, and solid mahogany hand-rail,\npolished by the boys’ constant riding up and down upon it. She was only\non the first step, when the dining-room door opened, and there came out\na young man, slight, and delicate-looking, with bright blue eyes, and\nthickly-curling light hair. “Acting nurse?” he said, smiling. “What\nan odd little face it is! I didn’t think little white babies were so\npretty! Well, I shall always consider myself as the real godfather--the\nother is all a sham.”\n\n“I think so,” said Margaret; “but I must not stand with her in a\ndraught,” and on she went, while he called after her. “So we are to have\nan expedition to-day.”\n\nShe did not gainsay it, but there was a little sigh of disappointment,\nand when she was out of hearing, she whispered, “Oh! lucky baby, to\nhave so many years to come before you are plagued with troublesome\npropriety!”\n\nThen depositing her little charge with the nurse, and trying to cheer up\na solemn-looking boy of three, who evidently considered his deposition\nfrom babyhood as a great injury, she tripped lightly down again, to take\npart in the Saturday’s reading and catechising.\n\nIt was pleasant to see that large family in the hush and reverence of\nsuch teaching, the mother’s gentle power preventing the outbreaks of\nrestlessness to which even at such times the wild young spirits were\nliable. Margaret and Miss Winter especially rejoiced in it on this\noccasion, the first since the birth of the baby, that she had been able\nto preside. Under her, though seemingly without her taking any trouble,\nthere was none of the smothered laughing at the little mistakes, the\nfidgeting of the boys, or Harry’s audacious impertinence to Miss Winter;\nand no less glad was Harry to have his mother there, and be guarded from\nhimself.\n\nThe Catechism was repeated, and a comment on the Sunday Services read\naloud. The Gospel was that on the taking the lowest place, and when they\nhad finished, Ethel said, “I like the verse which explains that:\n\n\n       ‘They who now sit lowest here,\n        When their Master shall appear,\n        He shall bid them higher rise,\n        And be highest in the skies.’”\n\n\n“I did not think of that being the meaning of ‘when He that bade thee\ncometh,’” said Norman thoughtfully.\n\n“It seemed to be only our worldly advantage that was meant before,” said\nEthel.\n\n“Well, it means that too,” said Flora.\n\n“I suppose it does,” said Mrs. May; “but the higher sense is the\none chiefly to be dwelt on. It is a lesson how those least known and\nregarded here, and humblest in their own eyes, shall be the highest\nhereafter.”\n\nAnd Margaret looked earnestly at her mother, but did not speak.\n\n“May we go, mamma?” said Mary.\n\n“Yes, you three--all of you, indeed, unless you wish to say any more.”\n\nThe “boys” availed themselves of the permission. Norman tarried to put\nhis books into a neat leather case, and Ethel stood thinking. “It means\naltogether--it is a lesson against ambition,” said she.\n\n“True,” said her mother, “the love of eminence for its own sake.”\n\n“And in so many different ways!” said Margaret.\n\n“Ay, worldly greatness, riches, rank, beauty,” said Flora.\n\n“All sorts of false flash and nonsense, and liking to be higher than one\nought to be,” said Norman. “I am sure there is nothing lower, or more\nmean and shabby, than getting places and praise a fellow does not\ndeserve.”\n\n“Oh, yes!” cried Ethel, “but no one fit to speak to would do that!”\n\n“Plenty of people do, I can tell you,” said Norman.\n\n“Then I hope I shall never know who they are!” exclaimed Ethel. “But\nI’ll tell you what I was thinking of, mamma. Caring to be clever, and\nget on, only for the sake of beating people.”\n\n“I think that might be better expressed.”\n\n“I know,” said Ethel, bending her brow, with the fullness of her\nthought--“I mean caring to do a thing only because nobody else can do\nit--wanting to be first more than wanting to do one’s best.”\n\n“You are quite right, my dear Ethel,” said her mother; “and I am glad\nyou have found in the Gospel a practical lesson, that should be useful\nto you both. I had rather you did so than that you read it in Greek,\nthough that is very nice too,” she added, smiling, as she put her hand\non a little Greek Testament, in which Ethel had been reading it, within\nher English Bible. “Now, go and mend that deplorable frock, and if you\ndon’t dream over it, you won’t waste too much of your holiday.”\n\n“I’ll get it done in no time!” cried Ethel, rushing headlong upstairs,\ntwice tripping in it before she reached the attic, where she slept, as\nwell as Flora and Mary--a large room in the roof, the windows gay with\nbird-cages and flowers, a canary singing loud enough to deafen any one\nbut girls to whom headaches were unknown, plenty of books and treasures,\nand a very fine view, from the dormer window, of the town sloping\ndownwards, and the river winding away, with some heathy hills in the\ndistance. Poking and peering about with her short-sighted eyes, Ethel\nlighted on a work-basket in rare disorder, pulled off her frock, threw\non a shawl, and sat down cross-legged on her bed, stitching vigorously,\nwhile meantime she spouted with great emphasis an ode of Horace, which\nNorman having learned by heart, she had followed his example; it being\nher great desire to be even with him in all his studies, and though\neleven months younger, she had never yet fallen behind him. On Saturday,\nhe showed her what were his tasks for the week, and as soon as her rent\nwas repaired, she swung herself downstairs in search of him for this\npurpose. She found him in the drawing-room, a pretty, pleasant room--its\nonly fault that it was rather too low. It had windows opening down to\nthe lawn, and was full of pretty things, works and knick-knacks. Ethel\nfound the state of affairs unfavourable to her. Norman was intent on\na book on the sofa, and at the table sat Mr. Ernescliffe, hard at work\nwith calculations and mathematical instruments. Ethel would not for the\nworld that any one should guess at her classical studies--she scarcely\nliked to believe that even her father knew of them, and to mention them\nbefore Mr. Ernescliffe would have been dreadful. So she only shoved\nNorman, and asked him to come.\n\n“Presently,” he said.\n\n“What have you here?” said she, poking her head into the book. “Oh! no\nwonder you can’t leave off. I’ve been wanting you to read it all the\nweek.”\n\nShe read over him a few minutes, then recoiled: “I forgot, mamma told me\nnot to read those stories in the morning. Only five minutes, Norman.”\n\n“Wait a bit, I’ll come.”\n\nShe fidgeted, till Mr. Ernescliffe asked Norman if there was a table of\nlogarithms in the house.\n\n“Oh, yes,” she answered; “don’t you know, Norman? In a brown book on the\nupper shelf in the dining-room. Don’t you remember papa’s telling us the\nmeaning of them, when we had the grand book-dusting?”\n\nHe was conscious of nothing but his book; however, she found the\nlogarithms, and brought them to Mr. Ernescliffe, staying to look at his\ndrawing, and asking what he was making out. He replied, smiling at the\nimpossibility of her understanding, but she wrinkled her brown forehead,\nhooked her long nose, and spent the next hour in amateur navigation.\n\nMarket Stoneborough was a fine old town. The Minster, grand with the\narchitecture of the time of Henry III., stood beside a broad river, and\nround it were the buildings of a convent, made by a certain good Bishop\nWhichcote, the nucleus of a grammar school, which had survived the\nReformation, and trained up many good scholars; among them, one of\nEngland’s princely merchants, Nicholas Randall, whose effigy knelt in\na niche in the chancel wall, scarlet-cloaked, white-ruffed, and black\ndoubletted, a desk bearing an open Bible before him, and a twisted\npillar of Derbyshire spar on each side. He was the founder of thirteen\nalmshouses, and had endowed two scholarships at Oxford, the object of\nambition of the Stoneborough boys, every eighteen months.\n\nThere were about sixty or seventy boarders, and the town boys slept at\nhome, and spent their weekly holiday there on Saturday--the happiest\nday in the week to the May family, when alone, they had the company at\ndinner of Norman and Harry, otherwise known by their school names of\nJune and July, given them because their elder brother had begun the\nseries of months as May.\n\nSome two hundred years back, a Dr. Thomas May had been headmaster, but\never since that time there had always been an M. D., not a D. D., in\nthe family, owning a comfortable demesne of spacious garden, and field\nenough for two cows, still green and intact, among modern buildings and\nimprovements.\n\nThe present Dr. May stood very high in his profession, and might soon\nhave made a large fortune in London, had he not held fast to his\nhome attachments. He was extremely skilful and clever, with a boyish\ncharacter that seemed as if it could never grow older; ardent,\nsensitive, and heedless, with a quickness of sympathy and tenderness of\nheart that was increased, rather than blunted, by exercise in scenes of\nsuffering.\n\nAt the end of the previous summer holidays, Dr. May had been called one\nmorning to attend a gentleman who had been taken very ill, at the Swan\nInn.\n\nHe was received by a little boy of ten years old, in much grief,\nexplaining that his brother had come two days ago from London, to bring\nhim to school here; he had seemed unwell ever since they met, and last\nnight had become much worse. And extremely ill the doctor found him;\na youth of two or three and twenty, suffering under a severe attack of\nfever, oppressed, and scarcely conscious, so as quite to justify his\nlittle brother’s apprehensions. He advised the boy to write to his\nfamily, but was answered by a look that went to his heart--“Alan”\n was all he had in the world--father and mother were dead, and their\nrelations lived in Scotland, and were hardly known to them.\n\n“Where have you been living, then?”\n\n“Alan sent me to school at Miss Lawler’s when my mother died, and there\nI have been ever since, while he has been these three years and a half\non the African station.”\n\n“What, is he in the navy?”\n\n“Yes,” said the boy proudly, “Lieutenant Ernescliffe. He got his\npromotion last week. My father was in the battle of Trafalgar; and\nAlan has been three years in the West Indies, and then he was in the\nMediterranean, and now on the coast of Africa, in the Atalantis. You\nmust have heard about him, for it was in the newspaper, how, when he was\nmate, he had the command of the Santa Isabel, the slaver they captured.”\n\nThe boy would have gone on for ever, if Dr. May had not recalled him to\nhis brother’s present condition, and proceeded to take every measure\nfor the welfare and comfort of the forlorn pair. He learned from other\nsources that the Ernescliffes were well connected. The father had been\na distinguished officer, but had been ill able to provide for his sons;\nindeed, he died, without ever having seen little Hector, who was born\nduring his absence on a voyage--his last, and Alan’s first. Alan, the\nelder by thirteen years, had been like a father to the little boy,\nshowing judgment and self-denial that marked him of a high cast of\ncharacter. He had distinguished himself in encounters with slave ships,\nand in command of a prize that he had had to conduct to Sierra Leone,\nhe had shown great coolness and seamanship, in several perilous\nconjunctures, such as a sudden storm, and an encounter with another\nslaver, when his Portuguese prisoners became mutinous, and nothing but\nhis steadiness and intrepidity had saved the lives of himself and his\nfew English companions. He was, in fact, as Dr. May reported, pretty\nmuch of a hero. He had not, at the time, felt the effects of the\nclimate, but, owing to sickness and death among the other officers, he\nhad suffered much fatigue and pressure of mind and body. Immediately on\nhis return, had followed his examination, and though he had passed with\ngreat credit, and it had been at once followed by well-earned promotion,\nhis nervous excitable frame had been overtasked, and the consequence was\na long and severe illness.\n\nThe Swan Inn was not forty yards from Dr. May’s back gate, and, at\nevery spare moment, he was doing the part of nurse as well as doctor,\nprofessionally obliged to Alan Ernescliffe for bringing him a curious\nexotic specimen of fever, and requiting him by the utmost care and\nattention, while, for their own sakes, he delighted in the two boys with\nall the enthusiasm of his warm heart. Before the first week was at\nan end, they had learned to look on the doctor as one of the kindest\nfriends it had been their lot to meet with, and Alan knew that if he\ndied, he should leave his little brother in the hands of one who would\ncomfort him as a father.\n\nNo sooner was young Ernescliffe able to sit up, than Dr. May insisted on\nconveying him to his own house, as his recovery was likely to be tedious\nin solitude at the Swan. It was not till he had been drawn in a chair\nalong the sloping garden, and placed on the sofa to rest, that he\ndiscovered that the time the good doctor had chosen for bringing a\nhelpless convalescent to his house, was two days after an eleventh child\nhad been added to his family.\n\nMrs. May was too sorry for the solitary youth, and too sympathising\nwith her husband, to make any objection, though she was not fond of\nstrangers, and had some anxieties. She had the utmost dependence on\nMargaret’s discretion, but there was a chance of awkward situations,\nwhich papa was not likely to see or guard against. However, all seemed\nto do very well, and no one ever came into her room without some degree\nof rapture about Mr. Ernescliffe. The doctor reiterated praises of his\nexcellence, his principle, his ability and talent, his amusing talk; the\ngirls were always bringing reports of his perfections; Norman retracted\nhis grumbling at having his evenings spoiled; and “the boys” were\nbursting with the secret that he was teaching them to rig a little ship\nthat was to astonish mamma on her first coming downstairs, and to be\nnamed after the baby; while Blanche did all the coquetry with him, from\nwhich Margaret abstained. The universal desire was for mamma to see him,\nand when the time came, she owned that papa’s swan had not turned out a\ngoose.\n\nThere were now no grounds for prolonging his stay; but it was very hard\nto go, and he was glad to avail himself of the excuse of remaining for\nthe christening, when he was to represent the absent godfather. After\nthat, he must go; he had written to his Scottish cousins to offer a\nvisit, and he had a promise that he should soon be afloat again. No\nplace would ever seem to him so like home as Market Stoneborough. He was\nquite like one of themselves, and took a full share in the discussions\non the baby’s name, which, as all the old family appellations had been\nused up, was an open question. The doctor protested against Alice and\nEdith, which he said were the universal names in the present day. The\nboys hissed every attempt of their sisters at a romantic name, and\nthen Harry wanted it to be Atalantis! At last Dr. May announced that\nhe should have her named Dowsabel if they did not agree, and Mrs. May\nadvised all the parties concerned to write their choice on a slip of\npaper, and little Aubrey should draw two out of her bag, trusting that\nAtalantis Dowsabel would not come out, as Harry confidently predicted.\n\nHowever, it was even worse, Aubrey’s two lots were Gertrude and\nMargaret. Ethel and Mary made a vehement uproar to discover who could\nhave written Margaret, and at last traced it home to Mr. Ernescliffe,\nwho replied that Flora, without saying why, had desired him to set down\nhis favourite name. He was much disconcerted, and did not materially\nmend the matter by saying it was the first name that came into his head.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\n\n    Meadows trim with daisies pied.--MILTON.\n\n\nEthel’s navigation lesson was interrupted by the dinner-bell. That long\ntable was a goodly sight. Few ever looked happier than Dr. and Mrs. May,\nas they sat opposite to each other, presenting a considerable contrast\nin appearance as in disposition. She was a little woman, with that\nsmooth pleasant plumpness that seems to belong to perfect content and\nserenity, her complexion fair and youthful, her face and figure very\npretty, and full of quiet grace and refinement, and her whole air and\nexpression denoting a serene, unruffled, affectionate happiness, yet\nwith much authority in her mildness--warm and open in her own family,\nbut reserved beyond it, and shrinking from general society.\n\nThe doctor, on the contrary, had a lank, bony figure, nearly six feet\nhigh, and looking more so from his slightness; a face sallow, thin,\nand strongly marked, an aquiline nose, highly developed forehead, and\npeculiar temples, over which the hair strayed in thin curling flakes.\nHis eyes were light coloured, and were seldom seen without his\nnear-sighted spectacles, but the expressions of the mouth were\neverything--so varying, so bright, and so sweet were his smiles that\nshowed beautiful white teeth--moreover, his hand was particularly well\nmade, small and delicate; and it always turned out that no one ever\nrecollected that Dr. May was plain, who had heard his kindly greeting.\n\nThe sons and daughters were divided in likeness to father and mother;\nEthel was almost an exaggeration of the doctor’s peculiarities,\nespecially at the formed, but unsoftened age of fifteen; Norman had his\nlong nose, sallow complexion, and tall figure, but was much improved by\nhis mother’s fine blue eyes, and was a very pleasant-looking boy, though\nnot handsome; little Tom was a thin, white, delicate edition of his\nfather; and Blanche contrived to combine great likeness to him with a\ngreat deal of prettiness. Of those that, as nurse said, favoured their\nmamma, Margaret was tall and blooming, with the same calm eyes, but with\nthe brilliance of her father’s smile; Flora had greater regularity of\nfeature, and was fast becoming a very pretty girl, while Mary and\nHarry could not boast of much beauty, but were stout sturdy pictures of\nhealth; Harry’s locks in masses of small tight yellow curls, much given\nto tangling and matting, unfit to be seen all the week, till nurse put\nhim to torture every Saturday, by combing them out so as, at least, to\nmake him for once like, she said, a gentleman, instead of a young lion.\n\nLittle Aubrey was said by his papa to be like nothing but the full moon.\nAnd there he shone on them, by his mamma’s side, announcing in language\nfew could understand, where he had been with papa.\n\n“He has been a small doctor,” said his father, beginning to cut the\nboiled beef as fast as if his hands had been moved by machinery. “He has\nbeen with me to see old Mrs. Robins, and she made so much of him, that\nif I take him again he’ll be regularly spoiled.”\n\n“Poor old woman, it must have been a pleasure to her,” said Mrs.\nMay--“it is so seldom she has any change.”\n\n“Who is she?” asked Mr. Ernescliffe.\n\n“The butcher’s old mother,” said Margaret, who was next to him. “She\nis one of papa’s pet patients, because he thinks her desolate and\nill-used.”\n\n“Her sons bully her,” said the doctor, too intent on carving to perceive\ncertain deprecatory glances of caution cast at him by his wife, to\nremind him of the presence of man and maid--“and that smart daughter is\nworse still. She never comes to see the old lady but she throws her into\nan agitated state, fit to bring on another attack. A meek old soul, not\nfit to contend with them!”\n\n“Why do they do it?” said Ethel.\n\n“For the cause of all evil! That daughter marries a grazier, and wants\nto set up for gentility; she comes and squeezes presents out of her\nmother, and the whole family are distrusting each other, and squabbling\nover the spoil before the poor old creature is dead! It makes one sick!\nI gave that Mrs. Thorn a bit of my mind at last; I could not stand the\nsight any longer. Madam, said I, you’ll have to answer for your mother’s\ndeath, as sure as my name’s Dick May--a harpy dressed up in feathers and\nlace.”\n\nThere was a great laugh, and an entreaty to know whether this was really\nhis address--Ethel telling him she knew he had muttered it to himself\nquite audibly, for which she was rewarded by a pretended box on the ear.\nIt certainly was vain to expect order at dinner on Saturday, for the\ndoctor was as bad as the boys, and Mrs. May took it with complete\ncomposure, hardly appearing sensible of the Babel which would sometimes\nalmost deafen its promoter, papa; and yet her interference was\nall-powerful, as now when Harry and Mary were sparring over the salt,\nwith one gentle “Mary!” and one reproving glance, they were reduced to\nquiescence.\n\nMeanwhile Dr. May, in a voice above the tumult, was telling “Maggie,” as\nhe always called his wife, some piece of news about Mr. Rivers, who had\nbought Abbotstoke Grange; and Alan Ernescliffe, in much lower tones,\nsaying to Margaret how he delighted in the sight of these home scenes,\nand this free household mirth.\n\n“It is the first time you have seen us in perfection,” said Margaret,\n“with mamma at the head of the table--no, not quite perfection either,\nwithout Richard.”\n\n“I am very glad to have seen it,” repeated Alan. “What a blessing it\nmust be to your brothers to have such a home!”\n\n“Yes, indeed,” said Margaret earnestly.\n\n“I cannot fancy any advantage in life equal to it. Your father and\nmother so entirely one with you all.”\n\nMargaret smiled, too much pleased to speak, and glanced at her mother’s\nsweet face.\n\n“You can’t think how often I shall remember it, or how rejoiced I--” He\nbroke off, for the noise subsided, and his speech was not intended for\nthe public ear, so he dashed into the general conversation, and catching\nhis own name, exclaimed, “What’s that base proposal, Ethel?”\n\n“To put you on the donkey,” said Norman.\n\n“They want to see a sailor riding,” interposed the doctor.\n\n“Dr. May!” cried the indignant voice of Hector Ernescliffe, as his\nhonest Scottish face flushed like a turkey cock, “I assure you that Alan\nrides like--”\n\n“Like a horse marine,” said Norman.\n\nHector and Harry both looked furious, but “June” was too great a man in\ntheir world for them to attempt any revenge, and it was left for Mary\nto call out, “Why, Norman, nonsense! Mr. Ernescliffe rode the new black\nkicking horse till he made it quite steady.”\n\n“Made it steady! No, Mary, that is saying too much for it,” said Mr.\nErnescliffe.\n\n“It has no harm in it--capital horse--splendid,” said the doctor; “I\nshall take you out with it this afternoon, Maggie.”\n\n“You have driven it several times?” said Alan.\n\n“Yes, I drove him to Abbotstoke yesterday--never started, except at a\nfool of a woman with an umbrella, and at the train--and we’ll take care\nnot to meet that.”\n\n“It is only to avoid the viaduct at half-past four,” said Mrs. May, “and\nthat is easily done.”\n\n“So you are bound for Cocksmoor?” said the doctor. “I told the poor\nfellow you were going to see his wife, and he was so thankful, that it\ndid one’s heart good.”\n\n“Is he better? I should like to tell his wife,” said Flora.\n\nThe doctor screwed up his face. “A bad business,” he said; “he is a shade\nbetter to-day; he may get through yet; but he is not my patient. I only\nsaw him because I happened to be there when he was brought in, and Ward\nwas not in the way.”\n\n“And what’s his name?”\n\n“I can’t tell--don’t think I ever heard.”\n\n“We ought to know,” said Miss Winter; “it would be awkward to go\nwithout.”\n\n“To go roaming about Cocksmoor asking where the man in the hospital\nlives!” said Flora. “We can’t wait till Monday.”\n\n“I’ve done,” said Norman; “I’ll run down to the hospital and find out.\nMay I, mamma?”\n\n“Without your pudding, old fellow?”\n\n“I don’t want pudding,” said Norman, slipping back his chair. “May I,\nmamma?”\n\n“To be sure you may;” and Norman, with a hand on the back of Ethel’s\nchair, took a flying leap over his own, that set all the glasses\nringing.\n\n“Stop, stop! know what you are going after, sir,” cried his father.\n“What will they know there of Cocksmoor, or the man whose wife has\ntwins? You must ask for the accident in number five.”\n\n“And oh, Norman, come back in time!” said Ethel.\n\n“I’ll be bound I’m back before Etheldred the Unready wants me,” he\nanswered, bounding off with an elasticity that caused his mother to say\nthe boy was made of india-rubber; and then putting his head in by the\nwindow to say, “By-the-bye, if there’s any pudding owing to me, that\nlittle chorister fellow of ours, Bill Blake, has got a lot of voracious\nbrothers that want anything that’s going. Tom and Blanche might take it\ndown to ‘em; I’m off! Hooray!” and he scampered headlong up the garden,\nprolonging his voice into a tremendous shout as he got farther off,\nleaving every one laughing, and his mother tenderly observing that he\nwas going to run a quarter of a mile and back, and lose his only chance\nof pudding for the week--old Bishop Whichcote’s rules contemplating no\nfare but daily mutton, to be bought at a shilling per sheep. A little\nprivate discussion ensued between Harry and Hector on the merits of the\ncakes at Ballhatchet’s gate, and old Nelly’s pies, which led the doctor\nto mourn over the loss of the tarts of the cranberries, that used to\ngrow on Cocksmoor, before it was inhabited, and to be the delight of the\nscholars of Stoneborough, when he was one of them--and then to enchant\nthe boys by relations of ancient exploits, especially his friend Spencer\nclimbing up, and engraving a name on the top of the market cross, now no\nmore--swept away by the Town Council in a fit of improvement, which had\nfor the last twenty years enraged the doctor at every remembrance of\nit. Perhaps at this moment his wife could hardly sympathise, when she\nthought of her boys emulating such deeds.\n\n“Papa,” said Ethel, “will you lend me a pair of spectacles for the\nwalk?”\n\n“And make yourself one, Ethel,” said Flora.\n\n“I don’t care--I want to see the view.”\n\n“It is very bad for you, Ethel,” further added her mother; “you will\nmake your sight much shorter if you accustom your eyes to them.”\n\n“Well, mamma, I never do wear them about the house.”\n\n“For a very good reason,” said Margaret; “because you haven’t got them.”\n\n“No, I believe Harry stole them in the holidays.”\n\n“Stole them!” said the doctor; “as if they weren’t my property,\nunjustifiably appropriated by her!”\n\n“They were that pair that you never could keep on, papa,” said\nEthel--“no use at all to you. Come, do lend me them.”\n\n“I’m sure I shan’t let you wear them,” said Harry. “I shan’t go, if you\nchoose to make yourself such an object.”\n\n“Ah!” said the father, “the boys thought it time to put a stop to it\nwhen it came to a caricature of the little doctor in petticoats.”\n\n“Yes, in Norman’s Lexicon,” said Ethel, “a capital likeness of you,\npapa; but I never could get him to tell me who drew it.”\n\nNor did Ethel know that that caricature had been the cause of the black\neye that Harry had brought home last summer. Harry returned, to\nprotest that he would not join the walk, if she chose to be seen in\nthe spectacles, while she undauntedly continued her petition, though\nanswered that she would attract the attacks of the quarrymen, who would\ntake her for an attenuated owl.\n\n“I wish you were obliged to go about without them yourself, papa!” cried\nEthel, “and then you would know how tiresome it is not to see twice the\nlength of your own nose.”\n\n“Not such a very short allowance either,” said the doctor quaintly, and\ntherewith the dinner concluded. There was apt to be a race between the\ntwo eldest girls for the honour of bringing down the baby; but this time\ntheir father strode up three steps at once, turned at the top of the\nfirst flight, made his bow to them, and presently came down with his\nlittle daughter in his arms, nodded triumphantly at the sisters, and set\nher down on her mother’s lap.\n\n“There, Maggie, you are complete, you old hen-and-chicken daisy. Can’t\nyou take her portrait in the character, Margaret?”\n\n“With her pink cap, and Blanche and Aubrey as they are now, on each\nside?” said Flora.\n\n“Margaret ought to be in the picture herself,” said Ethel. “Fetch the\nartist in Norman’s Lexicon, Harry.”\n\n“Since he has hit off one of us so well,” said the doctor. “Well! I’m\noff. I must see old Southern. You’ll be ready by three? Good-bye, hen\nand chicken.”\n\n“And I may have the spectacles?” said Ethel, running after him; “you\nknow I am an injured individual, for mamma won’t let me carry baby about\nthe house because I am so blind.”\n\n“You are welcome to embellish yourself, as far as I am concerned.”\n\nA general dispersion ensued, and only Mrs. May, Margaret, and the baby,\nremained.\n\n“Oh, no!” sighed Margaret; “you can’t be the hen-and-chicken daisy\nproperly, without all your chickens. It is the first christening we ever\nhad without our all being there.”\n\n“It was best not to press it, my dear,” said her mother. “Your papa\nwould have had his thoughts turned to the disappointment again and it\nmakes Richard himself so unhappy to see his vexation, that I believe it\nis better not to renew it.”\n\n“But to miss him for so long!” said Margaret. “Perhaps it is best, for\nit is very miserable when papa is sarcastic and sharp, and he cannot\nunderstand it, and takes it as meaning so much more than it really does,\nand grows all the more frightened and diffident. I cannot think what he\nwould do without you to encourage him.”\n\n“Or you, you good sister,” said her mother, smiling. “If we could only\nteach him not to mind being laughed at, and to have some confidence in\nhimself, he and papa would get on together.”\n\n“It is very hard,” cried Margaret, almost indignantly, “that papa won’t\nbelieve it, when he does his best.”\n\n“I don’t think papa can bear to bring himself to believe that it is his\nbest.”\n\n“He is too clever himself to see how other people can be slow,” said\nMargaret; “and yet”--the tears came into her eyes--“I cannot bear\nto think of his telling Richard it was no use to think of being a\nclergyman, and he had better turn carpenter at once, just because he\nfailed in his examination.”\n\n“My dear, I wish you would forget that,” said Mrs. May. “You know papa\nsometimes says more than he means, and he was excessively vexed and\ndisappointed. I know he was pleased with Ritchie’s resolve not to come\nhome again till he had passed, and it is best that it should not be\nbroken.”\n\n“The whole vacation, studying so hard, and this christening!” said\nMargaret; “it is treating him as if he had done wrong. I do believe Mr.\nErnescliffe thinks he has--for papa always turns away the conversation\nif his name is mentioned! I wish you would explain it, mamma; I can’t\nbear that.”\n\n“If I can,” said Mrs. May, rather pleased that Margaret had taken on\nherself this vindication of her favourite brother her father’s expense.\n“But, after all, Margaret, I never feel quite sure that poor Ritchie\ndoes exert himself to the utmost, he is too desponding to make the most\nof himself.”\n\n“And the more vexed papa is, the worse it grows!” said Margaret. “It is\nprovoking, though. How I do wish sometimes to give Ritchie a jog, when\nthere is some stumbling-block that he sticks fast at. Don’t you remember\nthose sums, and those declensions? When he is so clear and sensible\nabout practical matters too--anything but learning--I cannot think\nwhy--and it is very mortifying!”\n\n“I dare say it is very good for us not to have our ambition gratified,”\n said her mother. “There are so many troubles worse than these failures,\nthat it only shows how happy we are that we should take them so much to\nheart.”\n\n“They are a very real trouble!” said Margaret. “Don’t smile, mamma. Only\nremember how wretched his schooldays were, when papa could not see any\ndifficulty in what to him was so hard, and how all papa’s eagerness only\nstupified him the more.”\n\n“They are a comfort not to have that over again! Yet,” said the mother,\n“I often think there is more fear for Norman. I dread his talent and\nsuccess being snares.”\n\n“There is no self-sufficiency about him,” said Margaret.\n\n“I hope not, and he is so transparent, that it would be laughed down at\nthe first bud: but the universal good report, and certainty of success,\nand being so often put in comparison with Richard, is hardly safe. I was\nvery glad he heard what Ethel said to-day.”\n\n“Ethel spoke very deeply,” said Margaret; “I was a good deal struck by\nit--she often comes out with such solid thoughts.”\n\n“She is an excellent companion for Norman.”\n\n“The desire of being first!” said Margaret, “I suppose that is a form\nof caring for oneself! It set me thinking a good deal, mamma, how many\nforms of ambition there are. The craving for rank, or wealth, or beauty,\nare so clearly wrong, that one does not question about them; but I\nsuppose, as Ethel said, the caring to be first in attainments is as\nbad.”\n\n“Or in affection,” said Mrs. May.\n\n“In affection--oh, mamma, there is always some one person with whom one\nis first!” said Margaret eagerly; and then, her colour deepening, as\nshe saw her mother looking at her, she said hastily, “Ritchie--I never\nconsidered it--but I know--it is my great pleasure--oh, mamma!”\n\n“Well, my dear, I do not say but that you are the first with Richard,\nand that you well deserve to be so; but is the seeking to be the first\neven in that way safe? Is it not self-seeking again?”\n\n“Well, perhaps it is. I know it is what makes jealousy.”\n\n“The only plan is not to think about ourselves at all,” said Mrs. May.\n“Affection is round us like sunshine, and there is no use in measuring\nand comparing. We must give it out freely ourselves, hoping for nothing\nagain.”\n\n“Oh, mamma, you don’t mean that!”\n\n“Perhaps I should have said, bargaining for nothing again. It will\ncome of itself, if we don’t exact it; but rivalry is the sure means of\ndriving it away, because that is trying to get oneself worshipped.”\n\n“I suppose, then, you have never thought of it,” said Margaret, smiling.\n\n“Why, it would have been rather absurd,” said Mrs. May, laughing, “to\nbegin to torment myself whether you were all fond of me! You all have\njust as much affection for me, from beginning to end, as is natural,\nand what’s the use of thinking about it? No, no, Margaret, don’t go\nand protest that you love me, more than is natural,” as Margaret looked\ninclined to say something very eager, “that would be in the style of\nRegan and Goneril. It will be natural by-and-by that you should, some\nof you, love some one else better, and if I cared for being first, what\nshould I do then?”\n\n“Oh, mamma! But,” said Margaret suddenly, “you are always sure of papa.”\n\n“In one way, yes,” said Mrs. May; “but how do I know how long--” Calm as\nshe was, she could not finish that sentence. “No, Margaret, depend upon\nit, the only security is not to think about ourselves at all, and not\nto fix our mind on any affection on earth. The least share of the Love\nabove is the fullness of all blessing, and if we seek that first, all\nthese things will be added unto us, and are,” she whispered, more to\nherself than to Margaret.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n\n     Wee modest crimson-tipped flower,\n     Thou’st met me in an evil hour,\n     For I maun crush amang the stoure\n       Thy slender stem.\n     To spare thee now is past my power,\n       Thou bonnie gem.\n                               BURNS.\n\n\n“Is this all the walking party?” exclaimed Mr. Ernescliffe, as Miss\nWinter, Flora, and Norman gathered in the hall.\n\n“Harry won’t go because of Ethel’s spectacles,” answered Flora; “and\nMary and he are inseparable, so they are gone with Hector to have a\nshipwreck in the field.”\n\n“And your other sisters?”\n\n“Margaret has ratted--she is going to drive out with mamma,” said\nNorman; “as to Etheldred the Unready, I’ll run up and hurry her.”\n\nIn a moment he was at her door. “Oh! Norman, come in. Is it time?”\n\n“I should think so! You’re keeping every one waiting.”\n\n“Oh, dear! go on; only just tell me the past participle of ‘offero’, and\nI’ll catch you up.”\n\n“‘Oblatus.’”\n\n“Oh, yes, how stupid. The ‘a’ long or short? Then that’s right. I had\nsuch a line in my head, I was forced to write it down. Is not it a\ncapital subject this time?”\n\n“The devotion of Decius? Capital. Let me see!” said Norman, taking up\na paper scribbled in pencil, with Latin verses. “Oh, you have taken up\nquite a different line from mine. I began with Mount Vesuvius spouting\nlava like anything.”\n\n“But Mount Vesuvius didn’t spout till it overthrew Pompeii.”\n\n“Murder!” cried Norman, “I forgot! It’s lucky you put me in mind. I must\nmake a fresh beginning. There go my six best lines! However, it was\nan uncanny place, fit for hobgoblins, and shades, and funny customers,\nwhich will do as well for my purpose. Ha! that’s grand about its being\nso much better than the vana gloria triumphalis--only take care of the\nscanning there--”\n\n“If it was but English. Something like this:\n\n\n        “For what is equal to the fame\n         Of forgetting self in the aim?\n\n\nThat’s not right, but--”\n\n“Ethel, Norman, what are you about?” cried Flora. “Do you mean to go to\nCocksmoor to-day?”\n\n“Oh, yes!” cried Ethel, flying into vehement activity; “only I’ve lost\nmy blue-edged handkerchief--Flora, have you seen it?”\n\n“No; but here is your red scarf.”\n\n“Thank you, there is a good Flora. And oh! I finished a frock all but\ntwo stitches. Where is it gone? Go on, all of you, I’ll overtake you:\n\n\n        “Purer than breath of earthly fame,\n         Is losing self in a glorious aim.\n\n\n“Is that better, Norman?”\n\n“You’ll drive us out of patience,” said Flora, tying the handkerchief\nround Ethel’s throat, and pulling out the fingers of her gloves, which,\nof course, were inside out; “are you ready?”\n\n“Oh, my frock! my frock! There ‘tis--three stitches--go on, and I’ll\ncome,” said Ethel, seizing a needle, and sewing vehemently at a little\npink frock. “Go on, Miss Winter goes slowly up the hill, and I’ll\novertake you.”\n\n“Come, Norman, then; it is the only way to make her come at all.”\n\n“I shall wait for her,” said Norman. “Go on, Flora, we shall catch you\nup in no time;” and, as Flora went, he continued, “Never mind your aims\nand fames and trumpery English rhymes. Your verses will be much the\nbest, Ethel; I only went on a little about Mount Vesuvius and the\nlandscape, as Alan described it the other day, and Decius taking a last\nlook, knowing he was to die. I made him beg his horse’s pardon, and say\nhow they will both be remembered, and their self-devotion would inspire\nRomans to all posterity, and shout with a noble voice!” said Norman,\nrepeating some of his lines, correcting them as he proceeded.\n\n“Oh! yes; but oh, dear, I’ve done! Come along,” said Ethel, crumpling\nher work into a bundle, and snatching up her gloves; then, as they ran\ndownstairs, and emerged into the street, “It is a famous subject.”\n\n“Yes, you have made a capital beginning. If you won’t break down\nsomewhere, as you always do, with some frightful false quantity, that\nyou would get an imposition for, if you were a boy. I wish you were. I\nshould like to see old Hoxton’s face, if you were to show him up some of\nthese verses.”\n\n“I’ll tell you what, Norman, if I was you, I would not make Decius\nflatter himself with the fame he was to get--it is too like the\nstuff every one talks in stupid books. I want him to say--Rome--my\ncountry--the eagles--must win, if they do--never mind what becomes of\nme.”\n\n“But why should he not like to get the credit of it, as he did? Fame and\nglory--they are the spirit of life, the reward of such a death.”\n\n“Oh, no, no,” said Ethel. “Fame is coarse and vulgar--blinder than\never they draw Love or Fortune--she is only a personified newspaper,\ntrumpeting out all that is extraordinary, without minding whether it\nis good or bad. She misses the delicate and lovely--I wished they would\ngive us a theme to write about her. I should like to abuse her well.”\n\n“It would make a very good theme, in a new line,” said Norman; “but I\ndon’t give into it, altogether. It is the hope and the thought of fame,\nthat has made men great, from first to last. It is in every one that\nis not good for nothing, and always will be! The moving spirit of man’s\ngreatness!”\n\n“I’m not sure,” said Ethel; “I think looking for fame is like wanting\na reward at once. I had rather people forgot themselves. Do you think\nArnold von Winkelried thought about fame when he threw himself on the\nspears?”\n\n“He got it,” said Norman.\n\n“Yes; he got it for the good of other people, not to please himself.\nFame does those that admire it good, not those that win it.”\n\n“But!” said Norman, and both were silent for some short interval, as\nthey left the last buildings of the town, and began to mount a steep\nhill. Presently Norman slackened his pace, and driving his stick\nvehemently against a stone, exclaimed, “It is no use talking, Ethel, it\nis all a fight and a race. One is always to try to be foremost. That’s\nthe spirit of the thing--that’s what the great, from first to last, have\nstruggled, and fought, and lived, and died for.”\n\n“I know it is a battle, I know it is a race. The Bible says so,” replied\nEthel; “but is not there the difference, that here all may win--not\nonly one? One may do one’s best, not care whether one is first or last.\nThat’s what our reading to-day said.”\n\n“That was against trumpery vanity--false elevation--not what one has\nearned for oneself, but getting into other people’s places that one\nnever deserved. That every one despises!”\n\n“Of course! That they do. I say, Norman, didn’t you mean Harvey\nAnderson?”\n\nInstead of answering, Norman exclaimed, “It is pretension that is\nhateful--true excelling is what one’s life is for. No, no, I’ll never be\nbeat, Ethel--I never have been beat by any one, except by you, when you\ntake pains,” he added, looking exultingly at his sister, “and I never\nwill be.”\n\n“Oh, Norman!”\n\n“I mean, of course, while I have senses. I would not be like Richard for\nall the world.”\n\n“Oh, no, no, poor Richard!”\n\n“He is an excellent fellow in everything else,” said Norman; “I could\nsometimes wish I was more like him--but how he can be so amazingly slow,\nI can’t imagine. That examination paper he broke down in--I could have\ndone it as easily as possible.”\n\n“I did it all but one question,” said Ethel, “but so did he, you know,\nand we can’t tell whether we should have it done well enough.”\n\n“I know I must do something respectable when first I go to Oxford, if\nI don’t wish to be known as the man whose brother was plucked,” said\nNorman.\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel; “if papa will but let you try for the Randall\nscholarship next year, but he says it is not good to go to Oxford so\nyoung.”\n\n“And I believe I had better not be there with Richard,” added Norman. “I\ndon’t like coming into contrast with him, and I don’t think he can like\nit, poor fellow, and it isn’t his fault. I had rather stay another year\nhere, get one of the open scholarships, and leave the Stoneborough ones\nfor those who can do no better.”\n\nIn justice to Norman, we must observe that this was by no means said as\na boast. He would scarcely have thus spoken to any one but Etheldred, to\nwhom, as well as to himself, it seemed mere matter-of-fact. The others\nhad in the meantime halted at the top of the hill, and were looking back\nat the town--the great old Minster, raising its twin towers and long\nroof, close to the river, where rich green meadows spread over the\nvalley, and the town rising irregularly on the slope above, plentifully\ninterspersed with trees and gardens, and one green space on the banks\nof the river, speckled over with a flock of little black dots in rapid\nmotion.\n\n“Here you are!” exclaimed Flora. “I told them it was of no use to wait\nwhen you and Norman had begun a dissertation.”\n\n“Now, Mr. Ernescliffe, I should like you to say,” cried Ethel, “which\ndo you think is the best, the name of it, or the thing?” Her eloquence\nalways broke down with any auditor but her brother, or, perhaps,\nMargaret.\n\n“Ethel!” said Norman, “how is any one to understand you? The argument is\nthis: Ethel wants people to do great deeds, and be utterly careless of\nthe fame of them; I say, that love of glory is a mighty spring.”\n\n“A mighty one!” said Alan: “but I think, as far as I understand the\nquestion, that Ethel has the best of it.”\n\n“I don’t mean that people should not serve the cause first of all,” said\nNorman, “but let them have their right place and due honour.”\n\n“They had better make up their minds to do without it,” said Alan.\n“Remember--\n\n\n       ‘The world knows nothing of its greatest men.’”\n\n\n“Then it is a great shame,” said Norman.\n\n“But do you think it right,” said Ethel, “to care for distinction? It\nis a great thing to earn it, but I don’t think one should care for the\nouter glory.”\n\n“I believe it is a great temptation,” said Alan. “The being over-elated\nor over-depressed by success or failure in the eyes of the world,\nindependently of the exertion we have used.”\n\n“You call it a temptation?” said Ethel.\n\n“Decidedly so.”\n\n“But one can’t live or get on without it,” said Norman.\n\nThere they were cut short. There was a plantation to be crossed, with a\ngate that would not open, and that seemed an effectual barrier against\nboth Miss Winter and the donkey, until by persuasive eloquence and great\ngallantry, Mr. Ernescliffe performed the wonderful feat of getting the\nformer over the tall fence, while Norman conducted the donkey a long way\nround, undertaking to meet them at the other side of the plantation.\n\nThe talk became desultory, as they proceeded for at least a mile along\na cart-track through soft-tufted grass and heath and young fir-trees.\nIt ended in a broad open moor, stony; and full of damp boggy hollows,\nforlorn and desolate under the autumn sky. Here they met Norman again,\nand walked on along a very rough and dirty road, the ground growing\nmore decidedly into hills and valleys as they advanced, till they found\nthemselves before a small, but very steep hillock, one side of which was\ncut away into a slate quarry. Round this stood a colony of roughly-built\nhuts, of mud, turf, or large blocks of the slate. Many workmen were\nengaged in splitting up the slates, or loading wagons with them, rude\nwild-looking men, at the sight of whom the ladies shrank up to their\nprotectors, but who seemed too busy even to spare time for staring at\nthem.\n\nThey were directed to John Taylor’s house, a low mud cottage, very\nwretched looking, and apparently so smoky that Mr. Ernescliffe and\nNorman were glad to remain outside and survey the quarry, while the\nladies entered.\n\nInside they found more cleanliness and neatness than they had expected,\nbut there was a sad appearance of poverty, insufficient furniture, and\nthe cups and broken tea-pot on the table, holding nothing but toast and\nwater, as a substitute for their proper contents. The poor woman was\nsitting by the fire with one twin on her lap, and the other on a chair\nby her side, and a larger child was in the corner by the fire, looking\nheavy and ill, while others of different ages lounged about listlessly.\nShe was not untidy, but very pale, and she spoke in a meek, subdued way,\nas if the ills of life were so heavy on her that she had no spirit even\nto complain. She thanked them for their gifts but languidly, and did not\nvisibly brighten when told that her husband was better.\n\nFlora asked when the babes would be christened.\n\n“I can’t hardly tell, Miss--‘tis so far to go.”\n\n“I suppose none of the children can go to school? I don’t know their\nfaces there,” said Flora, looking at a nice tall, smooth-haired girl of\nthirteen or fourteen.\n\n“No, Miss--‘tis so far. I am sorry they should not, for they always was\nused to it where we lived before, and my oldest girl she can work very\nnicely. I wish I could get a little place for her.”\n\n“You would hardly know what to do without her,” said Miss Winter.\n\n“No, ma’am; but she wants better food than I can give her, and it is a\nbad wild place for a girl to grow up. It is not like what I was used to,\nma’am; I was always used to keep to my school and to my church--but it\nis a bad place to live in here.”\n\nNo one could deny it, and the party left the cottage gravely. Alan and\nNorman joined them, having heard a grievous history of the lawlessness\nof the people from a foreman with whom they had met. There seemed to be\nno visible means of improvement. The parish church was Stoneborough, and\nthere the living was very poor, the tithes having been appropriated\nto the old Monastery, and since its dissolution having fallen into\npossession of a Body that never did anything for the town. The\nincumbent, Mr. Ramsden, had small means, and was not a high stamp of\nclergyman, seldom exerting himself, and leaving most of his parish work\nto the two under masters of the school, Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Harrison, who\ndid all they had time and strength for, and more too, within the town\nitself. There was no hope for Cocksmoor!\n\n“There would be a worthy ambition!” said Etheldred, as they turned their\nsteps homeward. “Let us propose that aim to ourselves, to build a church\non Cocksmoor!”\n\n“How many years do you give us to do it in?” said Norman.\n\n“Few or many, I don’t care. I’ll never leave off thinking about it till\nit is done.”\n\n“It need not be long,” said Flora, “if one could get up a subscription.”\n\n“A penny subscription?” said Norman. “I’d rather have it my own doing.”\n\n“You agree then,” said Ethel; “do you, Mr. Ernescliffe?”\n\n“I may safely do so,” he answered, smiling. Miss Winter looked at\nEtheldred reprovingly, and she shrank into herself, drew apart, and\nindulged in a reverie. She had heard in books of girls writing poetry,\nromance, history--gaining fifties and hundreds. Could not some of the\nmyriads of fancies floating in her mind thus be made available? She\nwould compose, publish, earn money--some day call papa, show him her\nhoard, beg him to take it, and, never owning whence it came, raise the\nbuilding. Spire and chancel, pinnacle and buttress, rose before her\neyes, and she and Norman were standing in the porch with an orderly,\nreligious population, blessing the unknown benefactor, who had caused\nthe news of salvation to be heard among them.\n\nThey were almost at home, when the sight of a crowd in the main street\nchecked them. Norman and Mr. Ernescliffe went forward to discover the\ncause, and spoke to some one on the outskirts--then Mr. Ernescliffe\nhurried back to the ladies.\n\n“There’s been an accident,” he said hastily--“you had better go down the\nlane and in by the garden.”\n\nHe was gone in an instant, and they obeyed in silence. Whence came\nEthel’s certainty that the accident concerned themselves? In an agony\nof apprehension, though without one outward sign of it, she walked home.\nThey were in the garden--all was apparently as usual, but no one was in\nsight. Ethel had been first, but she held back, and let Miss Winter go\nforward into the house. The front door was open--servants were standing\nabout in confusion, and one of the maids, looking dreadfully frightened,\ngave a cry, “Oh! Miss--Miss--have you heard?”\n\n“No--what? What has happened? Not Mrs. May--” exclaimed Miss Winter.\n\n“Oh, ma’am! it is all of them. The carriage is overturned, and--”\n\n“Who’s hurt? Mamma! papa! Oh, tell me!” cried Flora.\n\n“There’s nurse,” and Ethel flew up to her. “What is it? Oh, nurse!”\n\n“My poor, poor children,” said old nurse, passionately kissing Ethel.\nHarry and Mary were on the stairs behind her, clinging together.\n\nA stranger looked into the house, followed by Adams, the stableman.\n“They are going to bring Miss May in,” some one said.\n\nEthel could bear it no longer. As if she could escape, she fled upstairs\ninto her room, and, falling on her knees, hid her face on her bed.\n\nThere were heavy steps in the house, then a sound of hasty feet coming\nup to her. Norman dashed into the room, and threw himself on a chair. He\nwas ghastly pale, and shuddered all over.\n\n“Oh, Norman, Norman, speak! What is it?” He groaned, but could not\nspeak; he rested his head against her, and gasped. She was terribly\nfrightened. “I’ll call--” and she would have gone, but he held her.\n“No--no--they can’t!” He was prevented from saying more, by chattering\nteeth and deadly faintness. She tried to support him, but could only\nguide him as he sank, till he lay at full length on the floor, where she\nput a pillow under his head, and gave him some water. “Is it--oh, tell\nme! Are they much hurt? Oh, try to say!”\n\n“They say Margaret is alive,” said Norman, in gasps; “but--And papa--he\nstood up--sat--walked--was better-”\n\n“Is he hurt--much hurt?”\n\n“His arm--” and the tremor and fainting stopped him again.\n\n“Mamma?” whispered Ethel; but Norman only pressed his face into the\npillow.\n\nShe was so bewildered as to be more alive to the present distress of his\ncondition than to the vague horrors downstairs. Some minutes passed in\nsilence, Norman lying still, excepting a nervous trembling that agitated\nhis whole frame. Again was heard the strange tread, doors opening and\nshutting, and suppressed voices, and he turned his face upwards, and\nlistened with his hand pressed to his forehead, as if to keep himself\nstill enough to listen.\n\n“Oh! what is the matter? What is it?” cried Ethel, startled and recalled\nto the sense of what was passing.\n\n“Oh, Norman!” Then springing up, with a sudden thought, “Mr. Ward! Oh!\nis he there?”\n\n“Yes,” said Norman, in a low hopeless tone, “he was at the place. He\nsaid it--”\n\n“What?”\n\nAgain Norman’s face was out of sight.\n\n“Mamma?” Ethel’s understanding perceived, but her mind refused to grasp\nthe extent of the calamity. There was no answer, save a convulsive\nsqueezing of her hand.\n\nFresh sounds below recalled her to speech and action.\n\n“Where is she? What are they doing for her? What--”\n\n“There’s nothing to be done. She--when they lifted her up, she was--”\n\n“Dead?”\n\n“Dead.”\n\nThe boy lay with his face hidden, the girl sat by him on the floor, too\nmuch crushed for even the sensations belonging to grief, neither moving\nnor looking. After an interval Norman spoke again, “The carriage turned\nright over--her head struck on the kerb stone--”\n\n“Did you see?” said Ethel presently.\n\n“I saw them lift her up.” He spoke at intervals, as he could get breath\nand bear to utter the words. “And papa--he was stunned--but soon he\nsat up, said he would go to her--he looked at her--felt her pulse, and\nthen--sank down over her!”\n\n“And did you say--I can’t remember--was he hurt?”\n\nThe shuddering came again, “His arm--all twisted--broken,” and his voice\nsank into a faint whisper; Ethel was obliged to sprinkle him again\nwith water. “But he won’t die?” said she, in a tone calm from its\nbewilderment.\n\n“Oh! no, no, no--”\n\n“And Margaret?”\n\n“They were bringing her home. I’ll go and see. Oh! what’s the meaning of\nthis?” exclaimed he, scolding himself, as, sitting up, he was forced to\nrest his head on his shaking hand.\n\n“You are still faint, dear Norman; you had better lie still, and I’ll go\nand see.”\n\n“Faint--stuff--how horridly stupid!” but he was obliged to lay his head\ndown again; and Ethel, scarcely less trembling, crept carefully towards\nthe stairs, but a dread of what she might meet came over her, and she\nturned towards the nursery.\n\nThe younger ones sat there in a frightened huddle. Mary was on a low\nchair by the infant’s cot, Blanche in her lap, Tom and Harry leaning\nagainst her, and Aubrey almost asleep. Mary held up her finger as Ethel\nentered, and whispered, “Hush! don’t wake baby for anything!”\n\nThe first true pang of grief shot through Ethel like a dart, stabbing\nand taking away her breath, “Where are they?” she said; “how is papa?\nwho is with him?”\n\n“Mr. Ward and Alan Ernescliffe,” said Harry. “Nurse came up just now,\nand said they were setting his arm.”\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“On the bed in his dressing-room,” said Harry.\n\n“Has he come to himself--is he better?”\n\nThey did not seem to know, and Ethel asked where to find Flora. “With\nMargaret,” she was told, and she was thinking whether she could venture\nto seek her, when she herself came fast up the stairs. Ethel and\nHarry both darted out. “Don’t stop me,” said Flora--“they want some\nhandkerchiefs.”\n\n“What, is not she in her own room?”\n\n“No,” said Harry, “in mamma’s;” and then his face quivered all over,\nand he turned away. Ethel ran after her sister, and pulling out drawers\nwithout knowing what she sought, begged to hear how papa and Margaret\nwere.\n\n“We can’t judge of Margaret--she has moved, and made a little\nmoaning--there are no limbs broken, but we are afraid for her head. Oh!\nif papa could but--”\n\n“And papa?”\n\n“Mr. Ward is with him now--his arm is terribly hurt.”\n\n“But oh! Flora--one moment--is he sensible?”\n\n“Hardly; he does not take any notice--but don’t keep me.”\n\n“Can I do anything?” following her to the head of the stairs.\n\n“No; I don’t see what you can do. Miss Winter and I are with Margaret;\nthere’s nothing to do for her.”\n\nIt was a relief. Etheldred shrank from what she might have to behold,\nand Flora hastened down, too busy and too useful to have time to think.\nHarry had gone back to his refuge in the nursery, and Ethel returned to\nNorman. There they remained for a long time, both unwilling to speak\nor stir, or even to observe to each other on the noises that came in to\nthem, as their door was left ajar, though in those sounds they were so\nabsorbed, that they did not notice the cold of a frosty October evening,\nor the darkness that closed in on them.\n\nThey heard the poor babe crying, one of the children going down to call\nnurse, and nurse coming up; then Harry, at the door of the room where\nthe boys slept, calling Norman in a low voice. Norman, now nearly\nrecovered, went and brought him into his sister’s room, and his tidings\nwere, that their father’s arm had been broken in two places, and the\nelbow frightfully injured, having been crushed and twisted by the wheel.\nHe was also a good deal bruised, and though Mr. Ward trusted there was\nno positive harm to the head, he was in an unconscious state, from\nwhich the severe pain of the operation had only roused him, so far as to\nevince a few signs of suffering. Margaret was still insensible.\n\nThe piteous sound of the baby’s wailing almost broke their hearts.\nNorman walked about the room in the dark, and said he should go down,\nhe could not bear it; but he could not make up his mind to go, and after\nabout a quarter of an hour, to their great relief, it ceased.\n\nNext Mary opened the door, saying, “Norman, here’s Mr. Wilmot come to\nask if he can do anything--Miss Winter sent word that you had better go\nto him.”\n\n“How is baby?” asked Harry.\n\n“Nurse has fed her, and is putting her to bed; she is quiet now,” said\nMary; “will you go down, Norman?”\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“In the drawing-room.”\n\nNorman paused to ask what he was to say.\n\n“Nothing,” said Mary, “nobody can do anything. Make haste. Don’t you\nwant a candle?”\n\n“No, thank you, I had rather be in the dark. Come up as soon as you have\nseen him,” said Etheldred.\n\nNorman went slowly down, with failing knees, hardly able to conquer the\nshudder that came over him, as he passed those rooms. There were\nvoices in the drawing-room, and he found a sort of council there, Alan\nErnescliffe, the surgeon, and Mr. Wilmot. They turned as he came in, and\nMr. Wilmot held out his hand with a look of affection and kindness that\nwent to his heart, making room for him on the sofa, while going on with\nwhat he was saying. “Then you think it would be better for me not to sit\nup with him.”\n\n“I should decidedly say so,” replied Mr. Ward. “He has recognised\nMr. Ernescliffe, and any change might excite him, and lead him to ask\nquestions. The moment of his full consciousness is especially to be\ndreaded.”\n\n“But you do not call him insensible?”\n\n“No, but he seems stunned--stupified by the shock, and by pain. He spoke\nto Miss Flora when she brought him some tea.”\n\n“And admirably she managed,” said Alan Ernescliffe. “I was much afraid\nof some answer that would rouse him, but she kept her self-possession\nbeautifully, and seemed to compose him in a moment.”\n\n“She is valuable indeed--so much judgment and activity,” said Mr. Ward.\n“I don’t know what we should have done without her. But we ought to have\nMr. Richard--has no one sent to him?”\n\nAlan Ernescliffe and Norman looked at each other.\n\n“Is he at Oxford, or at his tutor’s?” asked Mr. Wilmot.\n\n“At Oxford; he was to be there to-day, was he not, Norman?”\n\n“What o’clock is it? Is the post gone--seven--no; it is all safe,” said\nMr. Ward.\n\nPoor Norman! he knew he was the one who ought to write, but his icy\ntrembling hand seemed to shake more helplessly than ever, and a piteous\nglance fell upon Mr. Wilmot.\n\n“The best plan would be,” said Mr. Wilmot, “for me to go to him at once\nand bring him home. If I go by the mail-train, I shall get to him sooner\nthan a letter could.”\n\n“And it will be better for him,” said Mr. Ward. “He will feel it\ndreadfully, poor boy. But we shall all do better when we have him. You\ncan get back to-morrow evening.”\n\n“Sunday,” said Mr. Wilmot, “I believe there is a train at four.”\n\n“Oh! thank you, sir,” said Norman.\n\n“Since that is settled, perhaps I had better go up to the doctor,” said\nAlan; “I don’t like leaving Flora alone with him,” and he was gone.\n\n“How fortunate that that youth is here,” said Mr. Wilmot--“he seems to\nbe quite taking Richard’s place.”\n\n“And to feel it as much,” said Mr. Ward. “He has been invaluable with\nhis sailor’s resources and handiness.”\n\n“Well, what shall I tell poor Richard?” asked Mr. Wilmot.\n\n“Tell him there is no reason his father should not do very well, if\nwe can keep him from agitation--but there’s the point. He is of so\nexcitable a constitution, that his faculties being so far confused is\nthe best thing, perhaps, that could be. Mr. Ernescliffe manages him very\nwell--used to illness on that African coast, and the doctor is very\nfond of him. As to Miss May, one can’t tell what to say about her\nyet--there’s no fracture, at least--it must be a work of time to judge.”\n\nFlora at that moment half-opened the door, and called Mr. Ward, stopping\nfor a moment to say it was for nothing of any consequence. Mr. Wilmot\nand Norman were left together. Norman put his hands over his face and\ngroaned--his master looked at him with kind anxiety, but did not feel as\nif it were yet time to speak of consolation.\n\n“God bless and support you, and turn this to your good, my dear boy,”\n said he affectionately, as he pressed his hand; “I hope to bring your\nbrother to-morrow.”\n\n“Thank you, sir,” was all Norman could say; and as Mr. Wilmot went\nout by the front door, he slowly went up again, and, lingering on the\nlanding-place, was met by Mr. Ward, who told him to his relief--for the\nmere thinking of it renewed the faint sensation--that he had better not\ngo to his father’s room.\n\nThere was nothing to be done but to return to Ethel and Harry, and tell\nthem all; with some humiliation at being helpless, where Flora was doing\nso much, and to leave their father to be watched by a stranger. If he\nhad been wanted, Norman might have made the effort, but being told that\nhe would be worse than useless, there was nothing for him but to give\nway.\n\nThey sat together in Ethel’s room till somewhere between eight and nine\no’clock, when good old nurse, having put her younger ones to bed, came\nin search of them. “Dear, dear! poor darlings,” said she, as she found\nthem sitting in the dark; she felt their cold hands, and made them all\ncome into the nursery, where Mary was already, and, fondling them, one\nby one, as they passively obeyed her, she set them down on their little\nold stools round the fire, took away the high fender, and gave them each\na cup of tea. Harry and Mary ate enough to satisfy her, from a weary\ncraving feeling, and for want of employment; Norman sat with his elbow\non his knee, and a very aching head resting on his hand, glad of drink,\nbut unable to eat; Ethel could be persuaded to do neither, till she\nfound old nurse would let her have no peace.\n\nThe nurse sent them all to bed, taking the two girls to their own room,\nundressing them, and never leaving them until Mary was in a fair way of\ncrying herself to sleep--for saying her prayers had brought the tears;\nwhile Ethel lay so wide awake that it was of no use to wait for her, and\nthen she went to the boys, tucked them each in, as when they were little\nchildren, and saying, “Bless your dear hearts!” bestowed on each of them\na kiss which came gratefully to Norman’s burning brow, and which even\nHarry’s boyish manliness could not resist.\n\nFlora was in Margaret’s room, too useful to be spared.\n\nSo ended that dreadful Saturday.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n\n     They may not mar the deep repose\n       Of that immortal flower:\n     Though only broken hearts are found\n       To watch her cradle by,\n     No blight is on her slumbers found,\n       No touch of harmful eye.\n                                    LYRA INNOCENTIUM.\n\n\nSuch a strange sad Sunday! No going to church, but all the poor children\nmoving in awe and oppression about the house, speaking under their\nbreath, as they gathered in the drawing-room. Into the study they might\nnot go, and when Blanche would have asked why, Tom pressed her hand and\nshuddered.\n\nEtheldred was allowed to come and look at Margaret, and even to sit in\nthe room for a little while, to take the place of Miss Winter; but she\nwas not sensible of sufficient usefulness to relieve the burden of fear\nand bewilderment in the presence of that still, pale form; and, what was\nalmost worse, the sight of the familiar objects, the chair by the fire,\nthe sofa, the books, the work-basket, the letter-case, the dressing\nthings, all these were too oppressive. She sat crouched up, with her\nface hidden in her hands, and the instant she was released, hastened\nback to Norman. She was to tell him that he might go into the room, but\nhe did not move, and Mary alone went in and out with messages.\n\nDr. May was not to be visited, for he was in the same half-conscious\nstate, apparently sensible only of bodily suffering, though he answered\nwhen addressed, and no one was trusted to speak to him but Flora and\nErnescliffe.\n\nThe rest wore through the day as best they might. Harry slept a good\ndeal, Ethel read to herself, and tried to get Norman to look at passages\nwhich she liked, Mary kept the little ones from being troublesome, and\nat last took them to peep behind the school-room blinds for Richard’s\ncoming.\n\nThere was a simultaneous shout when, at four o’clock, they caught sight\nof him, and though, at Ethel’s exclamation of wonder, Mary and Tom hung\ntheir heads at having forgotten themselves, the association of gladness\nin seeing Richard was refreshing; the sense of being desolate and\nforsaken was relieved, and they knew that now they had one to rely on\nand to comfort them.\n\nHarry hastened to open the front door, and Richard, with his small\ntrim figure, and fresh, fair young face, flushed, though not otherwise\nagitated, was among them, almost devoured by the younger ones, and\ndealing out quiet caresses to them, as he caught from the words and\nlooks of the others that at least his father and sister were no worse.\nMr. Wilmot had come with him, but only stayed to hear the tidings.\n\n“Can I see papa?” were Richard’s first audible words--all the rest had\nbeen almost dumb show.\n\nEthel thought not, but took him to Margaret’s room, where he stood for\nmany minutes without speaking; then whispered to Flora that he must go\nto the others, she should call him if--and went down, followed by Ethel.\n\nTom and Blanche had fallen into teasing tricks, a sort of melancholy\nplay to relieve the tedium. They grew cross. Norman was roused to\nreprove sharply, and Blanche was beginning to cry. But Richard’s\nentrance set all at peace--he sat down among them, and, with soft voice\nand arm round Blanche, as she leaned against him, made her good in a\nmoment; and she listened while he talked over with Norman and Ethel all\nthey could bear to speak of.\n\nLate in the day Flora came into her father’s room, and stood gazing\nat him, as he lay with eyes closed, breathing heavily, and his brows\ncontracted by pain. She watched him with piteous looks, as if imploring\nhim to return to his children. Poor girl, to-day’s quiet, after the last\nevening’s bustle, was hard to bear. She had then been distracted from\nthought by the necessity of exertion, but it now repaid itself, and she\nknew not how to submit to do nothing but wait and watch.\n\n“No change?” enquired Alan Ernescliffe; looking kindly in her face.\n\n“No,” replied she in a low, mournful tone. “She only once said, thank\nyou.”\n\nA voice which she did not expect, asked inquiringly, “Margaret?” and her\nheart beat as if it would take away her breath, as she saw her father’s\neyes intently fixed on her. “Did you speak of her?” he repeated.\n\n“Yes, dear papa,” said Flora, not losing presence of mind, though in\nextreme fear of what the next question might be. “She is quiet and\ncomfortable, so don’t be uneasy, pray.”\n\n“Let me hear,” he said, and his whole voice and air showed him to be\nentirely roused. “There is injury? What is it--”\n\nHe continued his inquiries till Flora was obliged fully to explain her\nsister’s condition, and then he dismayed her by saying he would get up\nand go to see her. Much distressed, she begged him not to think of it,\nand appealed to Alan, who added his entreaties that he would at least\nwait for Mr. Ward; but the doctor would not relinquish his purpose, and\nsent her to give notice that he was coming.\n\nMr. Ernescliffe followed her out of the room, and tried to console her,\nas she looked at him in despair.\n\n“You see he is quite himself, quite collected,” he said; “you heard now\nclear and coherent his questions were.”\n\n“Can’t it be helped? Do try to stop him till I can send to Mr. Ward.”\n\n“I will try, but I think he is in a state to judge for himself. I do,\nupon my word; and I believe trying to prevent him would be more likely\nto do him harm than letting him satisfy himself. I really think you need\nnot be alarmed.”\n\n“But you know,” said Flora, coming nearer, and almost gasping as she\nwhispered and signed towards the door, “she is there--it is mamma’s\nroom, that will tell all.”\n\n“I believe he knows,” said Alan. “It was that which made him faint\nafter the accident, for he had his perceptions fully at first. I have\nsuspected all day that he was more himself than he seemed, but I think\nhe could not bear to awaken his mind to understand it, and that he was\nafraid to hear about her--your sister, so that our mention of her was a\ngreat relief, and did him good. I am convinced he knows the rest. Only\ngo on, be calm, as you have been, and we shall do very well.”\n\nFlora went to prepare. Ethel eagerly undertook to send to Mr. Ward, and\nhastened from the room, as if in a sort of terror, shrinking perhaps\nfrom what might lead to an outburst of grief. She longed to have seen\nher father, but was frightened at the chance of meeting him. When she\nhad sent her message, and told her brothers what was passing, she went\nand lingered on the stairs and in the passage for tidings. After what\nseemed a long time, Flora came out, and hastened to the nursery, giving\nher intelligence on the way.\n\n“Better than could be hoped, he walked alone into the room, and was\nquite calm and composed. Oh! if this will not hurt him, if the seeing\nbaby was but over!”\n\n“Does he want her?”\n\n“Yes, he would have come up here himself, but I would not let him.\nNurse, do you hear? Papa wants baby; let me have her.”\n\n“Bless me, Miss Flora, you can’t hold her while you are all of a\ntremble! And he has been to Miss Margaret?”\n\n“Yes, nurse, and he was only rather stiff and lame.”\n\n“Did Margaret seem to know him?” said Ethel.\n\n“She just answered in that dreamy way when he spoke to her. He says\nhe thinks it is as Mr. Ward believes, and that she will soon come to\nherself. He is quite able to consider--”\n\n“And he knows all?”\n\n“I am sure he does. He desired to see baby, and he wants you, nurse.\nOnly mind you command yourself--don’t say a word you can help--do\nnothing to agitate him.”\n\nNurse promised, but the tears came so fast, and sobs with them, as\nshe approached her master’s room, that Flora saw no composure could\nbe expected from her; and taking the infant from her, carried it in,\nleaving the door open for her to follow when wanted. Ethel stood by\nlistening. There was silence at first, then some sounds from the baby,\nand her father’s voice soothing it, in his wonted caressing phrases and\ntones, so familiar that they seemed to break the spell, drive away her\nvague terrors, and restore her father. Her heart bounded, and a sudden\nimpulse carried her to the bedside, at once forgetting all dread of\nseeing him, and chance of doing him harm. He lay, holding the babe close\nto him, and his face was not altered, so that there was nothing in the\nsight to impress her with the need of caution, and, to the consternation\nof the anxious Flora, she exclaimed, abruptly and vehemently, “Papa!\nshould not she be christened?”\n\nDr. May looked up at Ethel, then at the infant; “Yes,” he said, “at\nonce.” Then added feebly and languidly, “Some one must see to it.”\n\nThere was a pause, while Flora looked reproachfully at her sister, and\nEthel became conscious of her imprudence, but in a few moments Dr. May\nspoke again, first to the baby, and then asking, “Is Richard here?”\n\n“Yes, papa.”\n\n“Send him up presently. Where’s nurse?”\n\nEthel retreated, much alarmed at her rash measure, and when she related\nit she saw that Richard and Mr. Ernescliffe both thought it had been a\ngreat hazard.\n\n“Papa wants you,” was a welcome sound to the ears of Richard, and\nbrought a pink glow into his face. He was never one who readily showed\nhis feelings, and there was no danger of his failing in self-command,\nthough grievously downcast, not only at the loss of the tender mother,\nwho had always stood between him and his father’s impatience, but by\nthe dread that he was too dull and insignificant to afford any help or\ncomfort in his father’s dire affliction.\n\nYet there was something in the gentle sad look that met him, and in the\nlow tone of the “How d’ye do, Ritchie?” that drove off a thought of not\nbeing loved; and when Dr. May further added, “You’ll see about it all--I\nam glad you are come,” he knew he was of use, and was encouraged and\ncheered. That his father had full confidence and reliance in him, and\nthat his presence was a satisfaction and relief he could no longer\ndoubt; and this was a drop of balm beyond all his hopes; for loving\nand admiring his father intensely, and with depressed spirits and a low\nestimate of himself, he had begun to fancy himself incapable of being\nanything but a vexation and burden.\n\nHe sat with his father nearly all the evening, and was to remain with\nhim at night. The rest were comforted by the assurance that Dr. May was\nstill calm, and did not seem to have been injured by what had passed.\nIndeed, it seemed as if the violence and suddenness of the shock,\ntogether with his state of suffering, had deadened his sensations; for\nthere was far less agitation about him than could have been thought\npossible in a man of such strong, warm affections and sensitive\ntemperament.\n\nEthel and Norman went up arm-in-arm at bedtime.\n\n“I am going to ask if I may wish papa good-night,” said Ethel. “Shall I\nsay anything about your coming?”\n\nNorman hesitated, but his cheeks blanched; he shuddered, shook his head\nwithout speaking, ran up after Harry, and waved her back when she would\nhave followed.\n\nRichard told her that she might come in, and, as she slowly advanced,\nshe thought she had never seen anything so ineffably mournful as\nthe affectionate look on her father’s face. She held his hand and\nventured--for it was with difficulty she spoke--to hope he was not in\npain.\n\n“Better than it was, thank you, my dear,” he said, in a soft weak tone:\nthen, as she bent down to kiss his brow; “you must take care of the\nlittle ones.”\n\n“Yes, papa,” she could hardly answer, and a large drop gathered slowly\nin each eye, long in coming, as if the heart ached too much for them to\nflow freely.\n\n“Are they all well?”\n\n“Yes, papa.”\n\n“And good?” He held her hand, as if lengthening the interview.\n\n“Yes, very good all day.”\n\nA long deep sigh. Ethel’s two tears stood on her cheeks.\n\n“My love to them all. I hope I shall see them to-morrow. God bless you,\nmy dear, good-night.”\n\nEthel went upstairs, saddened and yet soothed. The calm silent sorrow,\ntoo deep for outward tokens, was so unlike her father’s usually\ndemonstrative habits, as to impress her all the more, yet those two\ntears were followed by no more; there was much strangeness and confusion\nin her mind in the newness of grief.\n\nShe found poor Flora, spent with exertion, under the reaction of all she\nhad undergone, lying on her bed, sobbing as if her heart would break,\ncalling in gasps of irrepressible agony on “mamma! mamma!” yet with\nher face pressed down on the pillow that she might not be heard. Ethel,\nterrified and distressed, timidly implored her to be comforted, but it\nseemed as if she were not even heard; she would have fetched some one,\nbut whom? Alas! alas! it brought back the sense that no mother would\never soothe them--Margaret, papa, both so ill, nurse engaged with\nMargaret! Ethel stood helpless and despairing, and Flora sobbed on, so\nthat Mary awakened to burst out in a loud frightened fit of crying; but\nin a few moments a step was at the door, a knock, and Richard asked, “Is\nanything the matter?”\n\nHe was in the room in a moment, caressing and saying affectionate things\nwith gentleness and fondling care, like his mother, and which recalled\nthe days when he had been proud to be left for a little while the small\nnurse and guardian of the lesser ones. Mary was hushed in a moment, and\nFlora’s exhausted weeping was gradually soothed, when she was able\nto recollect that she was keeping him from her father; with kind\ngood-nights, he left Ethel to read to her till she could sleep. Long did\nEthel read, after both her sisters were slumbering soundly; she went on\nin a sort of dreamy grief, almost devoid of pain, as if all this was too\nterrible to be true: and she had imagined herself into a story, which\nwould give place at dawn to her ordinary life.\n\nAt last she went to bed, and slept till wakened by the return of Flora,\nwho had crept down in her dressing-gown to see how matters were going.\nMargaret was in the same state, papa was asleep, after a restless\ndistressing night, with much pain and some fever; and whenever Richard\nhad begun to hope from his tranquillity, that he was falling asleep,\nhe was undeceived by hearing an almost unconsciously uttered sigh of\n“Maggie, my Maggie!” and then the head turned wearily on the pillow,\nas if worn out with the misery from which there was no escape. Towards\nmorning the pain had lessened, and, as he slept, he seemed much less\nfeverish than they could have ventured to expect.\n\nNorman looked wan and wretched, and could taste no breakfast; indeed\nHarry reported that he had been starting and talking in his sleep half\nthe night, and had proceeded to groaning and crying out till, when it\ncould be borne no longer, Harry waked him, and finished his night’s rest\nin peace.\n\nThe children were kept in the drawing-room that morning, and there were\nstrange steps in the house; but only Richard and Mr. Ernescliffe knew\nthe reason. Happily there had been witnesses enough of the overturn to\nspare any reference to Dr. May--the violent start of the horses had been\nseen, and Adams and Mr. Ernescliffe agreed, under their breath, that the\nnew black one was not fit to drive, while the whole town was so used to\nDr. May’s headlong driving, that every one was recollecting their\nown predictions of accidents. There needed little to account for the\ndisaster--the only wonder was that it had not happened sooner.\n\n“I say,” announced Harry, soon after they were released again, “I’ve\nbeen in to papa. His door was open, and he heard me, and called me. He\nsays he should like any of us to come in and see him. Hadn’t you better\ngo, Norman?”\n\nNorman started up, and walked hastily out of the room, but his hand\nshook so, that he could hardly open the door; and Ethel, seeing how it\nwas with him, followed him quickly, as he dashed, at full speed, up the\nstairs. At the top, however, he was forced to cling to the rail, gasping\nfor breath, while the moisture started on his forehead.\n\n“Dear Norman,” she said, “there’s nothing to mind. He looks just as\nusual. You would not know there was anything the matter.” But he rested\nhis head on his hand, and looked as if he could not stir. “I see it\nwon’t do,” said Ethel--“don’t try--you will be better by-and-by, and he\nhas not asked for you in particular.”\n\n“I won’t be beat by such stuff,” said Norman, stepping hastily forwards,\nand opening the door suddenly. He got through the greeting pretty well,\nthere was no need for him to speak, he only gave his hand and looked\naway, unable to bring himself to turn his eyes on his father, and afraid\nof letting his own face be seen. Almost at the same moment, nurse\ncame to say something about Margaret, and he seized the opportunity of\nwithdrawing his hand, and hurrying away, in good time, for he was pale\nas death, and was obliged to sit down on the head of the stairs, and\nlean his head against Etheldred.\n\n“What does make me so ridiculous?” he exclaimed faintly, but very\nindignantly.\n\nThe first cure was the being forced to clear out of Mr. Ward’s way,\nwhich he could not effect without being seen; and Ethel though she knew\nthat he would be annoyed, was not sorry to be obliged to remain, and\ntell what was the matter with him. “Oh,” said Mr. Ward, turning and\nproceeding to the dining-room, “I’ll set that to rights in a minute, if\nyou will ask for a tumbler of hot water Miss Ethel.”\n\nAnd armed with the cordial he had prepared, Ethel hunted up her brother,\nand persuaded him, after scolding her a little, to swallow it, and take\na turn in the garden; after which he made a more successful attempt at\nvisiting his father.\n\nThere was another room whither both Norman and Etheldred wished to go,\nthough they dared not hint at their desire. At last Richard came\nto them, as they were wandering in the garden, and, with his usual\nstillness of manner, shaded with additional seriousness, said, “Would\nyou like to come into the study?”\n\nEtheldred put one hand into his, Norman took the other, and soon\nthey stood in that calm presence. Fair, cold, white, and intensely\nstill--that face brought home to them the full certainty that the warm\nbrightening look would never beam on them, the soft blue eyes never\nguide, check, and watch them, the smile never approve or welcome them.\nTo see her unconscious of their presence was too strange and sad,\nand all were silent, till, as they left the room, Ethel looked out at\nBlanche and Aubrey in the garden. “They will never remember her! Oh! why\nshould it be?”\n\nRichard would fain have moralised and comforted, but she felt as if she\nknew it all before, and heard with languid attention. She had rather\nread than talk, and he sat down to write letters.\n\nThere were no near relations to be sent for. Dr. May was an only son,\nand his wife’s sister, Mrs. Arnott, was in New Zealand; her brother\nhad long been dead, and his widow, who lived in Edinburgh, was scarcely\nknown to the May family. Of friends there were many, fast bound by\naffection and gratitude, and notes, inquiries, condolences, and offers\nof service came in thickly, and gave much occupation to Flora, Richard,\nand Alan Ernescliffe, in turn. No one from without could do anything for\nthem--they had all the help they wanted in Miss Winter and in Alan, who\nwas invaluable in sharing with Richard the care of the doctor, as well\nas in giving him the benefit of his few additional years’ experience,\nand relieving him of some of his tasks. He was indeed like one of\nthemselves, and a most valuable help and comforter. Mr. Wilmot gave them\nall the time he could, and on this day saw the doctor, who seemed to\nfind some solace in his visit, though saying very little.\n\nOn this day the baby was to be baptized. The usual Stoneborough fashion\nwas to collect all the christenings for the month into one Sunday,\nexcept those for such persons as thought themselves too refined to see\ntheir children christened before the congregation, and who preferred\nan empty church and a week-day. The little one had waited till she was\nnearly six weeks old for “a Christening Sunday,” and since that had been\nmissed, she could not be kept unbaptized for another month; so, late in\nthe day, she was carried to church.\n\nRichard had extremely gratified old nurse, by asking her to represent\npoor Margaret; Mrs. Hoxton stood for the other godmother, and Alan\nErnescliffe was desired to consider himself absolutely her sponsor, not\nmerely a proxy. The younger children alone were to go with them: it\nwas too far off, and the way lay too much through the town for it to\nbe thought proper for the others to go. Ethel wished it very much, and\nthought it nonsense to care whether people looked at her; and in spite\nof Miss Winter’s seeming shocked at her proposing it, had a great mind\nto persist. She would even have appealed to her papa, if Flora had\nnot stopped her, exclaiming, “Really, Ethel, I think there never was a\nperson so entirely without consideration as you are.”\n\nMuch abashed, Ethel humbly promised that if she might go into papa’s\nroom, she would not say one word about the christening, unless he should\nbegin, and, to her great satisfaction, he presently asked her to read\nthe service to him. Flora came to the doorway of Margaret’s room, and\nlistened; when she had finished, all were silent.\n\n“How shall we, how can we virtuously bring up our motherless little\nsister?” was the thought with each of the girls. The answers were, in\none mind, “I trust we shall do well by her, dear little thing. I see, on\nan emergency, that I know how to act. I never thought I was capable of\nbeing of so much use, thanks to dear, dear mamma’s training. I shall\nmanage, I am sure, and so they will all depend on me, and look up to me.\nHow nice it was to hear dear papa say what he did about the comfort of\nmy being able to look after Margaret.”\n\nIn the other, “Poor darling, it is saddest of all for her, because she\nknows nothing, and will never remember her mamma! But if Margaret is but\nbetter, she will take care of her, and oh how we ought to try--and I,\nsuch a naughty wild thing--if I should hurt the dear little ones by\ncarelessness, or by my bad example! Oh! what shall I do, for want of\nsome one to keep me in order? If I should vex papa by any of my wrong\nways!”\n\nThey heard the return of the others, and the sisters both sprang up,\n“May we bring her to you?” said Flora.\n\n“Yes, do, my dears.”\n\nThe sisters all came down together with the little one, and Flora put\nher down within the arm her father stretched out for her. He gazed into\nthe baby face, which, in its expressionless placidity, almost recalled\nher mother’s tranquil sweetness.\n\n“Gertrude Margaret,” said Flora, and with a look that had more of\ntenderness than grief, he murmured, “My Daisy blossom, my little\nMaggie.”\n\n“Might we?” said Ethel, when Flora took her again, “might we take her to\nher godmother to see if she would notice her?”\n\nHe looked as if he wished it; but said, “No, I think not, better not\nrouse her,” and sighed heavily; then, as they stood round his bed,\nunwilling to go, he added, “Girls, we must learn carefulness and\nthoughtfulness. We have no one to take thought for us now.”\n\nFlora pressed the babe in her arms, Ethel’s two reluctant tears stood\non her cheeks, Mary exclaimed, “I’ll try not to be naughty;” and Blanche\nclimbed up to kiss him, saying, “I will be always good papa.”\n\n“Daisy--papa’s Daisy--your vows are made,” whispered Ethel, gaining sole\npossession of the babe for a minute. “You have promised to be good and\nholy. We have the keeping of you, mamma’s precious flower, her pearl\nof truth! Oh, may God guard you to be an unstained jewel, till you come\nback to her again--and a blooming flower, till you are gathered into the\nwreath that never fades--my own sweet poor little motherless Daisy!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n\n     “Through lawless camp, through ocean wild,\n     Her prophet eye pursues her child;\n     Scans mournfully her poet’s strain,\n     Fears for her merchant, loss alike and gain.”\n                                           LYRA INNOCENTIUM.\n\n\nDr. May took the management of himself into his own hands, and paid\nso little attention to Mr. Ward’s recommendations that his sons and\ndaughters were in continual dread of his choosing to do something that\nmight cause injurious agitation.\n\nHowever, he did not go further than Margaret’s bedroom where he sat\nhour after hour his eyes fixed upon her, as she continued in a state\nbordering on insensibility. He took little notice of anything else,\nand hardly spoke. There were heavy sighs now and then, but Richard and\nFlora, one or other of whom were always watching him, could hardly tell\nwhether to ascribe them to the oppression of sorrow or of suffering.\nTheir great fear was of his insisting on seeing his wife’s face, and it\nwas a great relief that he never alluded to her, except once, to desire\nRichard to bring him her ring. Richard silently obeyed, and, without a\nword, he placed it on his little finger. Richard used to read the Psalms\nto him in the morning, before he was up, and Flora would bring little\nDaisy and lay her by his side.\n\nTo the last moment they dreaded his choosing to attend the funeral, and\nFlora had decided on remaining at home, though trembling at the thought\nof what there might be to go through. They tried to let him hear nothing\nabout it, but he seemed to know everything; and when Flora came into\nMargaret’s room without her bonnet, he raised his head, and said, “I\nthought you were all going.”\n\n“The others are--but may I not stay with you and her, papa?”\n\n“I had rather be alone, my dears. I will take care of her. I should wish\nyou all to be there.”\n\nThey decided that his wishes ought to be followed, and that the patients\nmust be entrusted to old nurse. Richard told Flora, who looked very\npale, that she would be glad of it afterwards, and she had his arm to\nlean upon.\n\nThe grave was in the cloister attached to the minster, a smooth green\nsquare of turf, marked here and there with small flat lozenges of stone,\nbearing the date and initials of those who lay there, and many of them\nrecording former generations of Mays, to whom their descent from the\nheadmaster had given a right of burial there. Dr. Hoxton, Mr. Wilmot,\nand the surgeon, were the only friends whom Richard had asked to be\nwith them, but the minster was nearly full, for there was a very\nstrong attachment and respect for Dr. and Mrs. May throughout the\nneighbourhood, and every one’s feelings were strongly excited.\n\n“In the midst of life, we are in death--” There was a universal sound\nas of a sort of sob, that Etheldred never disconnected from those words.\nYet hardly one tear was shed by the young things who stood as close as\nthey could round the grave. Harry and Mary did indeed lock their hands\ntogether tightly, and the shoulders of the former shook as he stood,\nbowing down his head, but the others were still and quiet, in part from\nawe and bewilderment, but partly, too, from a sense that it was against\nher whole nature that there should be clamorous mourning for her. The\ncalm still day seemed to tell them the same, the sun beaming softly on\nthe gray arches and fresh grass, the sky clear and blue, and the trees\nthat showed over the walls bright with autumn colouring, all suitable to\nthe serenity of a life unclouded to its last moment. Some of them felt\nas if it were better to be there than in their saddened desolate home.\n\nBut home they must go, and, before going upstairs, as Flora and\nEtheldred stood a moment or two with Norman, Ethel said in a tone of\nresolution, and of some cheerfulness, “Well, we have to begin afresh.”\n\n“Yes,” said Flora, “it is a great responsibility. I do trust we may be\nenabled to do as we ought.”\n\n“And now Margaret is getting better, she will be our stay,” said Ethel.\n\n“I must go to her,” and Flora went upstairs.\n\n“I wish I could be as useful as Flora,” said Ethel; but I mean to try,\nand if I can but keep out of mischief, it will be something.\n\n“There is an object for all one does, in trying to be a comfort to\npapa.”\n\n“That’s no use,” said Norman, listlessly. “We never can.”\n\n“Oh, but, Norman, he won’t be always as he is now--I am sure he cares\nfor us enough to be pleased, if we do right and get on.”\n\n“We used to be so happy!” said Norman.\n\nEthel hesitated a little, and presently answered, “I don’t think it can\nbe right to lament for our own sakes so much, is it?”\n\n“I don’t want to do so,” said Norman, in the same dejected way.\n\n“I suppose we ought not to feel it either.” Norman only shook his head.\n“We ought to think of her gain. You can’t? Well, I am glad, for no more\ncan I. I can’t think of her liking for papa and baby and all of us to\nbe left to ourselves. But that’s not right of me, and of course it all\ncomes right where she is; so I always put that out of my head, and think\nwhat is to come next in doing, and pleasing papa, and learning.”\n\n“That’s grown horrid,” said Norman. “There’s no pleasure in getting on,\nnor in anything.”\n\n“Don’t you care for papa and all of us being glad, Norman?” As Norman\ncould not just then say that he did, he would not answer.\n\n“I wish--” said Ethel, disappointed, but cheering up the next minute. “I\ndo believe it is having nothing to do. You will be better when you get\nback to school on Monday.”\n\n“That is worst of all!”\n\n“You don’t like going among the boys again? But that must be done some\ntime or other. Or shall I get Richard to speak to Dr. Hoxton to let you\nhave another week’s leave?”\n\n“No, no, don’t be foolish. It can’t be helped.”\n\n“I am very sorry, but I think you will be better for it.”\n\nShe almost began to fancy herself unfeeling, when she found him so much\nmore depressed than she was herself, and unable to feel it a relief to\nknow that the time of rest and want of occupation was over. She thought\nit light-minded, though she could not help it, to look forward to\nthe daily studies where she might lose her sad thoughts and be as if\neverything were as usual. But suppose she should be to blame, where\nwould now be the gentle discipline? Poor Ethel’s feelings were not such\nas to deserve the imputation of levity, when this thought came over\nher; but her buoyant mind, always seeking for consolation, recurred to\nMargaret’s improvement, and she fixed her hopes on her.\n\nMargaret was more alive to surrounding objects, and, when roused, she\nknew them all, answered clearly when addressed, had even, more than\nonce, spoken of her own accord, and shown solicitude at the sight of her\nfather’s bandaged, helpless arm, but he soon soothed this away. He was\nmore than ever watchful over her, and could scarcely be persuaded to\nleave her for one moment, in his anxiety to be at hand to answer, when\nfirst she should speak of her mother, a moment apprehended by all the\nrest, almost as much for his sake as for hers.\n\nSo clear had her perceptions been, and so much more awake did she\nappear, on this evening, that he expected the inquiry to come every\nmoment, and lingered in her room; till she asked the hour, and begged\nhim to go to bed.\n\nAs he bent over her, she looked up in his face, and said softly, “Dear\npapa.”\n\nThere was that in her tone which showed she perceived the truth, and he\nknelt by her side kissing her, but not daring to relax his restraint of\nfeeling.\n\n“Dear papa,” she said again, “I hope I shall soon be better, and be some\ncomfort to you.”\n\n“My best--my own--my comfort,” he murmured, all he could say without\ngiving way.\n\n“Baby--is she well?”\n\n“Yes, thank Heaven, she has not suffered at all.”\n\n“I heard her this morning, I must see her to-morrow. But don’t stay,\ndear, dear papa, it is late, and I am sure you are not at all well. Your\narm--is it very much hurt?”\n\n“It is nothing you need think about, my dear. I am much better than I\ncould have imagined possible.”\n\n“And you have been nursing me all the time! Papa, you must let me take\ncare of you now. Do pray go to bed at once, and get up late. Nurse will\ntake good care of me. Good-night, dear papa.”\n\nWhen Dr. May had left her, and tried to tell Richard how it had been,\nthe tears cut him short, and had their free course; but there was much\nof thankfulness, for it might be looked on as the restoration of his\ndaughter; the worst was over, and the next day he was able to think of\nother things, had more attention to spare for the rest, and when the\nsurgeon came, took some professional interest in the condition of his\nown arm, inquired after his patients, and even talked of visiting them.\n\nIn the meantime, Margaret sent for her eldest brother, begging him to\ntell her the whole, and it was heard as calmly and firmly as it was\ntold. Her bodily state lulled her mind; and besides it was not new; she\nhad observed much while her faculties were still too much benumbed for\nher to understand all, or to express her feelings. Her thoughts seemed\nchiefly occupied with her father. She made Richard explain to her\nthe injury he had suffered, and begged to know whether his constant\nattendance on her could do him harm. She was much rejoiced when her\nbrother assured her that nothing could be better for him, and she\nbegan to say, with a smile, that very likely her being hurt had been\nfortunate. She asked who had taken care of him before Richard’s arrival,\nand was pleased to hear that it was Mr. Ernescliffe. A visit from the\nlittle Gertrude Margaret was happily accomplished, and, on the whole,\nthe day was most satisfactory--she herself declaring that she could not\nsee that there was anything the matter with her, except that she felt\nlazy, and did not seem able to move.\n\nThus the next Sunday morning dawned with more cheerfulness. Dr. May came\ndownstairs for the first time, in order to go to church with his whole\nflock, except the two Margarets. He looked very wan and shattered, but\nthey clustered gladly round him, when he once more stood among them,\nlittle Blanche securing his hand, and nodding triumphantly to Mr.\nErnescliffe, as much as to say, “Now I have him, I don’t want you.”\n\nNorman alone was missing; but he was in his place at church among the\nboys. Again, in returning, he slipped out of the party, and was at\nhome the first, and when this recurred in the afternoon Ethel began\nto understand his motive. The High Street led past the spot where the\naccident had taken place, though neither she nor any of the others knew\nexactly where it was, except Norman, on whose mind the scene was branded\nindelibly; she guessed that it was to avoid it that he went along what\nwas called Randall’s Alley, his usual short cut to school.\n\nThe Sunday brought back to the children that there was no one to hear\ntheir hymns; but Richard was a great comfort, watching over the little\nones more like a sister than a brother. Ethel was ashamed of herself\nwhen she saw him taking thought for them, tying Blanche’s bonnet,\nputting Aubrey’s gloves on, teaching them to put away their Sunday toys,\nas if he meant them to be as neat and precise as himself.\n\nDr. May did not encounter the family dinner, nor attempt a second going\nto church; but Blanche was very glorious as she led him down to drink\ntea, and, before going up again, he had a conversation with Alan\nErnescliffe, who felt himself obliged to leave Stoneborough early on the\nmorrow.\n\n“I can endure better to go now,” said he, “and I shall hear of you\noften; Hector will let me know, and Richard has promised to write.”\n\n“Ay, you must let us often have a line. I should guess you were a\nletter-writing man.”\n\n“I have hitherto had too few friends who cared to hear of me to write\nmuch, but the pleasure of knowing that any interest is taken in me\nhere--”\n\n“Well,” said the doctor, “mind that a letter will always be welcome, and\nwhen you are coming southwards, here are your old quarters. We cannot\nlose sight of you anyway, especially”--and his voice quivered--“after\nthe help you gave my poor boys and girls in their distress.”\n\n“It would be the utmost satisfaction to think I had been of the smallest\nuse,” said Alan, hiding much under these commonplace words.\n\n“More than I know,” said Dr. May; “too much to speak of. Well, we shall\nsee you again, though it is a changed place, and you must come and see\nyour god-daughter--poor child--may she only be brought up as her sisters\nwere! They will do their best, poor things, and so must I, but it is sad\nwork!”\n\nBoth were too much overcome for words, but the doctor was the first to\ncontinue, as he took off his dimmed spectacles. He seemed to wish to\nexcuse himself for giving way; saying, with a look that would fain have\nbeen a smile, “The world has run so light and easy with me hitherto,\nthat you see I don’t know how to bear with trouble. All thinking and\nmanaging fell to my Maggie’s share, and I had as little care on my hands\nas one of my own boys--poor fellows. I don’t know how it is to turn out,\nbut of all the men on earth to be left with eleven children, I should\nchoose myself as the worst.”\n\nAlan tried to say somewhat of “Confidence--affection--daughters,” and\nbroke down, but it did as well as if it had been connected.\n\n“Yes, yes,” said the doctor, “they are good children every one of them.\nThere’s much to be thankful for, if one could only pluck up heart to\nfeel it.”\n\n“And you are convinced that Marga--that Miss May is recovering.”\n\n“She has made a great advance today. The head is right, at least,” but\nthe doctor looked anxious and spoke low as he said, “I am not satisfied\nabout her yet. That want of power over the limbs, is more than the mere\nshock and debility, as it seems to me, though Ward thinks otherwise,\nand I trust he is right, but I cannot tell yet as to the spine. If\nthis should not soon mend I shall have Fleet to see her. He was a\nfellow-student of mine very clever, and I have more faith in him than in\nany one else in that line.”\n\n“By all means--Yes,” said Alan, excessively shocked. “But you will let\nme know how she goes on--Richard will be so kind.”\n\n“We will not fail,” said Dr May more and more touched at the sight of\nthe young sailor struggling in vain to restrain his emotion, “you shall\nhear. I’ll write myself as soon as I can use my hand, but I hope she may\nbe all right long before that is likely to be.”\n\n“Your kindness--” Alan attempted to say, but began again. “Feeling as I\nmust--” then interrupting himself. “I beg your pardon, ‘tis no fit time,\nnor fit--But you’ll let me hear.”\n\n“That I will,” said Dr May, and as Alan hastily left the room, he\ncontinued, half aloud, to himself, “Poor boy! poor fellow. I see. No\nwonder! Heaven grant I have not been the breaking of their two young\nhearts, as well as my own! Maggie looked doubtful--as much as she ever\ndid when my mind was set on a thing, when I spoke of bringing him here.\nBut after all, she liked him as much as the rest of us did--she could\nnot wish it otherwise--he is one of a thousand, and worthy of our\nMargaret. That he is! and Maggie thinks so. If he gets on in his\nprofession, why then we shall see--” but the sigh of anguish of mind\nhere showed that the wound had but been forgotten for one moment.\n\n“Pshaw! What am I running on to? I’m all astray for want of her! My poor\ngirl--”\n\nMr Ernescliffe set out before sunrise. The boys were up to wish him\ngood-bye, and so were Etheldred and Mary, and some one else, for while\nthe shaking of hands was going on in the hall there was a call, “Mr\nErnthcliffe,” and over the balusters peeped a little rough curly head, a\nface glowing with carnation deepened by sleep, and a round, plump, bare\narm and shoulder, and down at Alan’s feet there fell a construction of\nwhite and pink paper, while a voice lisped out, “Mr Ernthcliffe, there’s\na white rothe for you.”\n\nAn indignant “Miss Blanche!” was heard behind and there was no certainty\nthat any thanks reached the poor little heroine, who was evidently borne\noff summarily to the nursery, while Ethel gave way to a paroxysm of\nsuppressed laughter, joined in, more or less, by all the rest, and thus\nAlan, promising faithfully to preserve the precious token, left Dr May’s\ndoor, not in so much outward sorrow as he had expected.\n\nEven their father laughed at the romance of the white “rothe,” and\ndeclared Blanche was a dangerous young lady; but the story was less\nsuccessful with Miss Winter, who gravely said it was no wonder since\nBlanche’s elder sister had been setting her the example of forwardness\nin coming down in this way after Mr. Ernescliffe. Ethel was very angry,\nand was only prevented from vindicating herself by remembering there\nwas no peacemaker now, and that she had resolved only to think of Miss\nWinter’s late kindness, and bear with her tiresome ways.\n\nEtheldred thought herself too sorrowful to be liable to her usual faults\nwhich would seem so much worse now; but she found herself more irritable\nthan usual, and doubly heedless, because her mind was preoccupied. She\nhated herself, and suffered more from sorrow than even at the first\nmoment, for now she felt what it was to have no one to tame her, no eye\nover her; she found herself going a tort et a travers all the morning,\nand with no one to set her right. Since it was so the first day, what\nwould follow?\n\nMary was on the contrary so far subdued, as to be exemplary in goodness\nand diligence, and Blanche was always steady. Flora was too busy to\nthink of the school-room, for the whole house was on her hands, besides\nthe charge of Margaret, while Dr. May went to the hospital, and\nto sundry patients, and they thought he seemed the better for the\noccupation, as well as gratified and affected by the sympathy he\neverywhere met with from high and low.\n\nThe boys were at school, unseen except when at the dinner play-hour\nNorman ran home to ask after his father and sister; but the most trying\ntime was at eight in the evening, when they came home. That was wont to\nbe the merriest part of the whole day, the whole family collected,\npapa at leisure and ready for talk or for play, mamma smiling over her\nwork-basket, the sisters full of chatter, the brothers full of fun, all\nthe tidings of the day discussed, and nothing unwelcome but bedtime. How\ndifferent now! The doctor was with Margaret, and though Richard tried to\nsay something cheerful as his brothers entered, there was no response,\nand they sat down on the opposite sides of the fire, forlorn and silent,\ntill Richard, who was printing some letters on card-board to supply the\ngaps in Aubrey’s ivory Alphabet, called Harry to help him; but Ethel,\nas she sat at work, could only look at Norman, and wish she could devise\nanything likely to gratify him.\n\nAfter a time Flora came down, and laying some sheets of closely written\nnote-paper before her sister, said, “Here is dear mamma’s unfinished\nletter to Aunt Flora. Papa says we elder ones are to read it. It is a\ndescription of us all, and very much indeed we ought to learn from it. I\nshall keep a copy of it.”\n\nFlora took up her work, and began to consult with Richard, while Ethel\nmoved to Norman’s side, and kneeling so as to lean against his shoulder,\nas he sat on a low cushion, they read their mother’s last letter by\nthe fire-light, with indescribable feelings, as they went through the\nsubjects that had lately occupied them, related by her who would never\nbe among them again. After much of this kind, for her letters to Mrs.\nArnott were almost journals, came,\n\n\n“You say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken\ndaisies, and if I do not write in these leisure days, you will hardly\nget it after I am in the midst of business again. The new Daisy is like\nMargaret at the same age--may she continue like her! Pretty creature,\nshe can hardly be more charming than at present. Aubrey, the moon-faced,\nis far from reconciled to his disposition from babyhood; he is a sober,\nsolemn gentleman, backward in talking, and with such a will of his own,\nas will want much watching; very different from Blanche, who is Flora\nover again, perhaps prettier and more fairy-like, unless this is only\none’s admiration for the buds of the present season. None of them has\never been so winning as this little maid, who even attracts Dr. Hoxton\nhimself, and obtains sugar-plums and kisses. ‘Rather she than I,’ says\nHarry, but notice is notice to the white Mayflower, and there is my\nanxiety--I am afraid it is not wholesome to be too engaging ever to get\na rebuff. I hope having a younger sister, and outgrowing baby charms may\nbe salutary. Flora soon left off thinking about her beauty, and the fit\nof vanity does less harm at five than fifteen. My poor Tom has not such\na happy life as Blanche, he is often in trouble at lessons, and bullied\nby Harry at play, in spite of his champion, Mary; and yet I cannot\ninterfere, for it is good for him to have all this preparatory teasing\nbefore he goes into school. He has good abilities, but not much\nperseverance or energy, and I must take the teaching of him into my\nown hands till his school-days begin, in hopes of instilling them.\nThe girlishness and timidity will be knocked out of him by the boys,\nI suppose; Harry is too kind and generous to do more than tease him\nmoderately, and Norman will see that it does not go too far. It is a\ncommon saying that Tom and Mary made a mistake, that he is the girl,\nand she the boy, for she is a rough, merry creature, the noisiest in the\nhouse, always skirmishing with Harry in defence of Tom, and yet devoted\nto him, and wanting to do everything he does. Those two, Harry and Mary,\nare exactly alike, except for Harry’s curly mane of lion-coloured wig.\nThe yellow-haired laddie, is papa’s name for Harry, which he does not\nmind from him, though furious if the girls attempt to call him so.\nHarry is the thorough boy of the family, all spirit, recklessness, and\nmischief, but so true, and kind, and noble-hearted, that one loves him\nthe better after every freely confessed scrape. I cannot tell you how\ngrateful I am to my boy for his perfect confidence, the thing that\nchiefly lessens my anxiety for him in his half-school, half-home life,\nwhich does not seem to me to work quite well with him. There are two\nsons of Mrs. Anderson’s at the school, who are more his friends than I\nlike, and he is too easily led by the desire not to be outdone, and to\nshow that he fears nothing. Lately, our sailor-guest has inspired him\nwith a vehement wish to go to sea; I wish it was not necessary that the\ndecision should be made so early in life, for this fault is just what\nwould make us most fear to send him into the world very young, though in\nsome ways it might not do amiss for him.\n\n“So much for the younger bairns, whom you never beheld, dear Flora.\nThe three whom you left, when people used to waste pity on me for their\nbeing all babies together, now look as if any pair of them were twins,\nfor Norman is the tallest, almost outgrowing his strength, and Ethel’s\nsharp face, so like her papa’s, makes her look older than Flora. Norman\nand Ethel do indeed take after their papa, more than any of the others,\nand are much alike. There is the same brilliant cleverness, the same\nstrong feeling, not easy of demonstration, though impetuous in action;\nbut poor Ethel’s old foibles, her harum-scarum nature, quick temper,\nuncouth manners, and heedlessness of all but one absorbing object, have\nkept her back, and caused her much discomfort; yet I sometimes think\nthese manifest defects have occasioned a discipline that is the\nbest thing for the character in the end. They are faults that show\nthemselves, and which one can tell how to deal with, and I have full\nconfidence that she has the principle within her that will conquer\nthem.”\n\n“If--” mournfully sighed Ethel; but her brother pointed on further.\n\n“My great hope is her entire indifference to praise--not approval, but\npraise. If she has not come up to her own standard, she works on, not\nalways with good temper, but perseveringly, and entirely, unheeding of\ncommendation till she has satisfied herself, only thinking it stupid not\nto see the faults. It is this independence of praise that I want to see\nin her brother and sister. They justly earn it, and are rightly pleased\nwith it; but I cannot feel sure whether they do not depend on it too\nmuch. Norman lives, like all school-boys, a life of emulation, and has\nnever met with anything but success. I do believe Dr. Hoxton and\nMr. Wilmot are as proud of him as we are; and he has never shown any\ntendency to conceit, but I am afraid he has the love of being foremost,\nand pride in his superiority, caring for what he is, compared with\nothers, rather than what he is himself.”\n\n\n“I know,” said Norman; “I have done so, but that’s over. I see what it\nis worth. I’d give all the quam optimes I ever got in my life to be the\nhelp Richard is to papa.”\n\n“You would if you were his age.”\n\n“Not I, I’m not the sort. I’m not like her. But are we to go on about\nthe elders?”\n\n“Oh! yes, don’t let us miss a word. There can’t be anything but praise\nof them.”\n\n\n“Your sweet goddaughter. I almost feel as if I had spoken in\ndisparagement of her, but I meant no such thing, dear girl. It would be\nhard to find a fault in her, since the childish love of admiration was\nsubdued. She is so solid and steady, as to be very valuable with the\nyounger ones, and is fast growing so lovely, that I wish you could\nbehold her. I do not see any vanity, but there lies my dread, not\nof beauty--vanity, but that she will find temptation in the being\neverywhere liked and sought after. As to Margaret, my precious companion\nand friend, you have heard enough of her to know her, and, as to telling\nyou what she is like, I could as soon set about describing her papa.\nWhen I thought of not being spared to them this time, it was happiness\nindeed to think of her at their head, fit to be his companion, with so\nmuch of his own talent as to be more up to conversation with him, than\nhe could ever have found his stupid old Maggie. It was rather a trial\nof her discretion to have Mr. Ernescliffe here while I was upstairs,\nand very well she seems to have come out of it. Poor Richard’s last\ndisappointment is still our chief trouble. He has been working hard with\na tutor all through the vacation, and has not even come home to see his\nnew sister, on his way to Oxford. He had made a resolution that he would\nnot come to us till he had passed, and his father thought it best that\nit should be kept. I hope he will succeed next time, but his nervousness\nrenders it still more doubtful. With him it is the very reverse of\nNorman. He suffers too much for want of commendation, and I cannot\nwonder at it, when I see how much each failure vexes his father, and\nRichard little knows how precious is our perfect confidence in him, how\nmuch more valuable than any honours he could earn. You would be amused\nto see how little he is altered from the pretty little fair fellow,\nthat you used to say was so like my old portrait, even the wavy rings of\nlight glossy hair sit on his forehead, just as you liked to twist them;\nand his small trim figure is a fine contrast to Norman’s long legs and\narms, which--”\n\n\nThere the letter broke off, the playful affection of the last words\nmaking it almost more painful to think that the fond hand would never\nfinish the sentence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\n\n     A drooping daisy changed into a cup,\n     In which her bright-eyed beauty is shut up.\n                                          WORDSWORTH.\n\n\n“So there you are up for the day--really you look very comfortable,”\n said Ethel, coming into the room where Margaret lay on her bed,\nhalf-raised by pillows, supported by a wooden frame.\n\n“Yes, is not it a charming contrivance of Richard’s? It quite gives me\nthe use of my hands,” said Margaret.\n\n“I think he is doing something else for you,” said Ethel; “I heard him\ncarpentering at six o’clock this morning, but I suppose it is to be a\nsecret.”\n\n“And don’t you admire her night-cap?” said Flora.\n\n“Is it anything different?” said Ethel, peering closer. “Oh, I see--so\nshe has a fine day night-cap. Is that your taste, Flora?”\n\n“Partly,” said Margaret, “and partly my own. I put in all these little\nwhite puffs, and I hope you think they do me credit. Wasn’t it grand of\nme?”\n\n“She only despises you for them,” said Flora.\n\n“I’m very glad you could,” said Ethel, gravely; “but do you know? it\nis rather like that horrid old lady in some book, who had a paralytic\nstroke, and the first thing she did that showed she had come to her\nsenses was to write, ‘Rose-coloured curtains for the doctors.’”\n\n“Well, it was for the doctor,” said Margaret, “and it had its effect. He\ntold me I looked much better when he found me trying it on.”\n\n“And did you really have the looking-glass and try it on?” cried Ethel.\n\n“Yes, really,” said Flora. “Don’t you think one may as well be fit to be\nseen if one is ill? It is no use to depress one’s friends by being more\nforlorn and disconsolate than one can help.”\n\n“No--not disconsolate,” said Ethel; “but the white puffiness--and the\nhemming--and the glass!”\n\n“Poor Ethel can’t get over it,” said Margaret. “But, Ethel, do you think\nthere is nothing disconsolate in untidiness?”\n\n“You could be tidy without the little puffs! Your first bit of work too!\nDon’t think I’m tiresome. If they were an amusement to you, I am sure I\nam very glad of them, but I can’t see the sense of them.”\n\n“Poor little things!” said Margaret laughing. “It is only my foible for\nmaking a thing look nice. And, Ethel,” she added, drawing her down close\nover her, “I did not think the trouble wasted, if seeing me look fresher\ncheered up dear papa a moment.”\n\n“I spoke to papa about nurse’s proposal,” said Margaret presently to\nFlora, “and he quite agrees to it. Indeed it is impossible that Anne\nshould attend properly to all the children while nurse is so much\nengaged with me.”\n\n“I think so,” said Flora; “and it does not answer to bring Aubrey into\nthe school-room. It only makes Mary and Blanche idle, and Miss Winter\ndoes not like it.”\n\n“Then the question is, who shall it be? Nurse has no one in view, and\nonly protests against ‘one of the girls out of the school here.’”\n\n“That’s a great pity,” said Flora. “Don’t you think we could make her\ntake to Jane White, she is so very nice.”\n\n“I thought of her, but it will never answer if we displease nurse.\nBesides, I remember at the time Anne came, dear mamma thought there was\ndanger of a girl’s having too many acquaintances, especially taking the\nchildren out walking. We cannot always be sure of sending her out with\nAnne.”\n\n“Do you remember--” said Ethel, there stopping.\n\n“Well,” said both sisters.\n\n“Don’t you recollect, Flora, that girl whose father was in the\nhospital--that girl at Cocksmoor?”\n\n“I do,” said Flora. “She was a very nice girl; I wonder whether nurse\nwould approve of her.”\n\n“How old?” said Margaret. “Fourteen, and tall. Such a clean cottage!”\n\nThe girls went on, and Margaret began to like the idea very much, and\nconsider whether the girl could be brought for inspection, before nurse\nwas prejudiced by hearing of her Cocksmoor extraction. At that moment\nRichard knocked at the door, and entered with Tom, helping him to bring\na small short-legged table, such as could stand on the bed at the right\nheight for Margaret’s meals or employments.\n\nThere were great exclamations of satisfaction, and gratitude; “it was\nthe very thing wanted, only how could he have contrived it?”\n\n“Don’t you recognise it?” said he.\n\n“Oh, I see; it is the old drawing-desk that no one used. And you have\nput legs to it--how famous! You are the best contriver, Richard!”\n\n“Then see, you can raise it up for reading or writing; here’s a corner\nfor your ink to stand flat; and there it is down for your dinner.”\n\n“Charming, you have made it go so easily, when it used to be so stiff.\nThere--give me my work-basket, please, Ethel; I mean to make some more\nwhite puffs.”\n\n“What’s the matter now, Ethel?” said Flora; “you look as if you did not\napprove of the table.”\n\n“I was only thinking it was as if she was settling herself to lie in bed\nfor a very long time,” said Ethel.\n\n“I hope not,” said Richard; “but I don’t see why she should not be as\ncomfortable as she can, while she is there.”\n\n“I am sure I hope you will never be ill, Ethel,” said Flora. “You would\nbe horrid to nurse!”\n\n“She will know how to be grateful when she is,” said Margaret.\n\n“I say, Richard,” exclaimed Ethel, “this is hospital-meeting day, so you\nwon’t be wanted to drive papa.”\n\n“No, I am at your service; do you want a walk?”\n\nSo it was determined that Richard and Ethel should walk together to\nCocksmoor.\n\nNo two people could be much more unlike than Richard and Etheldred May;\nbut they were very fond of each other. Richard was sometimes seriously\nannoyed by Ethel’s heedlessness, and did not always understand her\nsublimities, but he had a great deal of admiration for one who partook\nso much of his father’s nature; and Ethel had a due respect for her\neldest brother, gratitude and strong affection for many kindnesses,\na reverence for his sterling goodness, and his exemption from her own\nbesetting failings, only a little damped by compassionate wonder at\nhis deficiency in talent, and by her vexation at not being always\ncomprehended.\n\nThey went by the road, for the plantation gate was far too serious an\nundertaking for any one not in the highest spirits for enterprise. On\nthe way there was a good deal of that desultory talk, very sociable and\ninteresting, that is apt to prevail between two people, who would never\nhave chosen each other for companions, if they were not of the same\nfamily, but who are nevertheless very affectionate and companionable.\nEthel was anxious to hear what her brother thought of papa’s spirits,\nand whether he talked in their drives.\n\n“Sometimes,” said Richard. “It is just as it happens. Now and then he\ngoes on just like himself, and then at other times he will not speak for\nthree or four miles.”\n\n“And he sighs?” said Ethel. “Those sighs are so very sad, and long, and\ndeep! They seem to have whole volumes in them, as if there was such a\nweight on him.”\n\n“Some people say he is not as much altered as they expected,” said\nRichard.\n\n“Oh! do they? Well! I can’t fancy any one feeling it more. He can’t\nleave off his old self, of course, but--” Ethel stopped short.\n\n“Margaret is a great comfort to him,” said Richard.\n\n“That she is. She thinks of him all day long, and I don’t think either\nof them is ever so happy as in the evening, when he sits with her. They\ntalk about mamma then--”\n\nIt was just what Richard could not do, and he made some observation to\nchange the subject, but Ethel returned to it, so far as to beg to know\nhow the arm was going on, for she did not like to say anything about it\nto papa.\n\n“It will be a long business, I am afraid,” said Richard. “Indeed, he\nsaid the other day, he thought he should never have the free use of the\nelbow.”\n\n“And do you think it is very painful? I saw the other day, when Aubrey\nwas sitting on his knee and fidgeting, he shrank whenever he even came\ntowards it, and yet it seemed as if he could not bear to put him down.”\n\n“Yes it is excessively tender, and sometimes gets very bad at night.”\n\n“Ah,” said Ethel; “there’s a line--here--round his eyes, that there\nnever used to be, and when it deepens, I am sure he is in pain, or has\nbeen kept awake.”\n\n“You are very odd, Ethel; how do you see things in people’s faces, when\nyou miss so much at just the same distance?”\n\n“I look after what I care about,” said Ethel. “One sees more with one’s\nmind than one’s eyes. The best sight is inside.”\n\n“But do you always see the truth?” said Richard gravely.\n\n“Quite enough. What is less common than the ordinary world?” said Ethel.\n\nRichard shook his head, not quite satisfied, but not sure enough that he\nentered into her meaning to question it.\n\n“I wonder you don’t wear spectacles,” was the result of his meditation,\nand it made her laugh by being so inapposite to her own reflections: but\nthe laugh ended in a melancholy look. “Dear mamma did not like me to use\nthem,” she said, in a low voice.\n\nThus they talked till they arrived at Cocksmoor, where poor Mrs. Taylor,\ninspirited by better reports of her husband and the hopes for her\ndaughter, was like another woman. Richard was very careful not to raise\nfalse expectations, saying it all depended on Miss May and nurse, and\nwhat they thought of her strength and steadiness, but these cautions\ndid not seem capable of damping the hopes of the smooth-haired Lucy,\nwho stood smiling and curtseying. The twins were grown and improved, and\nEthel supposed they would be brought to church on the next christening\nSunday, but their mother looked helpless and hopeless about getting\nthem so far, and how was she to get gossips? Ethel began to grow very\nindignant, but she was always shy of finding fault with poor people\nto their faces when she would not have done so to persons in her own\nstation, and so she was silent, while Richard hoped they would be able\nto manage, and said it would be better not to wait another month for\nstill worse weather and shorter days.\n\nAs they were coming out of the house, a big, rough-looking, uncivilised\nboy came up before them, and called out, “I say--ben’t you the young\ndoctor up at Stoneborough?”\n\n“I am Dr. May’s son,” said Richard; while Ethel, startled, clung to his\narm, in dread of some rudeness.\n\n“Granny’s bad,” said the boy; proceeding without further explanation to\nlead the way to another hovel, though Richard tried to explain that the\nknowledge of medicine was not in his case hereditary. A poor old woman\nsat groaning over the fire, and two children crouched, half-clothed, on\nthe bare floor.\n\nRichard’s gentle voice and kind manner drew forth some wonderful\ndescriptions--“her head was all of a goggle, her legs all of a fur, she\nfelt as if some one was cutting right through her.”\n\n“Well,” said Richard kindly, “I am no doctor myself, but I’ll ask\nmy father about you, and perhaps he can give you an order for the\nhospital.”\n\n“No, no, thank ye, sir; I can’t go to the hospital, I can’t leave these\npoor children; they’ve no father nor mother, sir, and no one to do for\nthem but me.”\n\n“What do you live on, then?” said Richard, looking round the desolate\nhut.\n\n“On Sam’s wages, sir; that’s that boy. He is a good boy to me, sir, and\nhis little sisters; he brings it, all he gets, home to me, rig’lar, but\n‘tis but six shillings a week, and they makes ‘em take half of it out in\ngoods and beer, which is a bad thing for a boy like him, sir.”\n\n“How old are you, Sam?”\n\nSam scratched his head, and answered nothing. His grandmother knew he\nwas the age of her black bonnet, and as he looked about fifteen, Ethel\nhonoured him and the bonnet accordingly, while Richard said he must be\nvery glad to be able to maintain them all, at his age, and, promising to\ntry to bring his father that way, since prescribing at second hand\nfor such curious symptoms was more than could be expected, he took his\nleave.\n\n“A wretched place,” said Richard, looking round. “I don’t know what help\nthere is for the people. There’s no one to do any thing for them, and it\nis of no use to tell them to come to church when it it so far off, and\nthere is so little room for them.”\n\n“It is miserable,” said Ethel; and all her thoughts during her last walk\nthither began to rush over her again, not effaced, but rather burned in,\nby all that had subsequently happened. She had said it should be her aim\nand effort to make Cocksmoor a Christian place. Such a resolve must not\npass away lightly; she knew it must be acted on, but how? What would her\npresent means--one sovereign--effect? Her fancies, rich and rare,\nhad nearly been forgotten of late, but she might make them of use in\ntime--in time, and here were hives of children growing up in heathenism.\nSuddenly an idea struck her--Richard, when at home, was a very diligent\nteacher in the Sunday-school at Stoneborough, though it was a thankless\ntask, and he was the only gentleman so engaged, except the two\nclergymen--the other male teachers being a formal, grave, little baker,\nand one or two monitors.\n\n“Richard,” said Ethel, “I’ll tell you what. Suppose we were to get up\na Sunday-school at Cocksmoor. We could get a room, and walk there every\nSunday afternoon, and go to church in the evening instead.”\n\nHe was so confounded by the suddenness of the project, that he did not\nanswer, till she had time for several exclamations and “Well, Richard?”\n\n“I cannot tell,” he said. “Going to church in the evening would\ninterfere with tea-time--put out all the house--make the evening\nuncomfortable.”\n\n“The evenings are horrid now, especially Sundays,” said Ethel.\n\n“But missing two more would make them worse for the others.”\n\n“Papa is always with Margaret,” said Ethel. “We are of no use to him.\nBesides these poor children--are not they of more importance?”\n\n“And, then, what is to become of Stoneborough school?”\n\n“I hate it,” exclaimed Ethel; then seeing Richard shocked, and finding\nshe had spoken more vehemently than she intended--“It is not as bad\nfor you among the boys, but, while that committee goes on it is not\nthe least use to try to teach the girls right. Oh! the fusses about the\nbooks, and one’s way of teaching! And fancy how Mrs Ledwich used us.\nYou know I went again last Sunday, for the first time, and there I found\nthat class of Margaret’s, that she had just managed to get into some\ndegree of nice order, taken so much pains with, taught so well. She\nhad been telling me what to hear them--there it is given away to\nFanny Anderson, who is no more fit to teach than that stick, and all\nMargaret’s work will be undone. No notice to us--not even the civility\nto wait and see when she gets better.”\n\n“If we left them now for Cocksmoor, would it not look as it we were\naffronted?”\n\nEthel was slightly taken aback, but only said, “Papa would be very angry\nif he knew it.”\n\n“I am glad you did not tell him,” said Richard.\n\n“I thought it would only tease him,” said Ethel, “and that he might\ncall it a petty female squabble; and when Margaret is well, it will come\nright, if Fanny Anderson has not spoiled the girls in the meantime. It\nis all Mrs. Ledwich’s doing. How I did hate it when every one came up\nand shook hands with me, and asked after Margaret and papa, only just\nout of curiosity!”\n\n“Hush, hush, Ethel, what’s the use of thinking such things?”\n\nA silence,--then she exclaimed, “But, indeed, Richard, you don’t\nfancy that I want to teach at Cocksmoor, because it is disagreeable at\nStoneborough?”\n\n“No, indeed.”\n\nThe rendering of full justice conveyed in his tone so opened Ethel’s\nheart that she went on eagerly:--“The history of it is this. Last time\nwe walked here, that day, I said, and I meant it, that I would never put\nit out of my head; I would go on doing and striving, and trying, till\nthis place was properly cared for, and has a church and a clergyman. I\nbelieve it was a vow, Richard, I do believe it was,--and if one makes\none, one must keep it. There it is. So, I can’t give money, I have but\none pound in the world, but I have time, and I would make that useful,\nif you would help me.”\n\n“I don’t see how,” was the answer, and there was a fragment of a smile\non Richard’s face, as if it struck him as a wild scheme, that Ethel\nshould undertake, single handed, to evangelise Cocksmoor.\n\nIt was such a damper as to be most mortifying to an enthusiastic girl,\nand she drew into herself in a moment.\n\nThey walked home in silence, and when Richard warned her that she was\nnot keeping her dress out of the dirt, it sounded like a sarcasm on\nher projects, and, with a slightly pettish manner, she raised the\nunfortunate skirt, its crape trimmings greatly bespattered with ruddy\nmud. Then recollecting how mamma would have shaken her head at that very\nthing, she regretted the temper she had betrayed, and in a larmoyante\nvoice, sighed, “I wish I could pick my way better. Some people have the\ngift, you have hardly a splash, and I’m up to the ankles in mud.”\n\n“It is only taking care,” said Richard; “besides your frock is so long,\nand full. Can’t you tuck it up and pin it?”\n\n“My pins always come out,” said Ethel, disconsolately, crumpling the\nblack folds into one hand, while she hunted for a pin with the other.\n\n“No wonder, if you stick them in that way,” said Richard. “Oh! you’ll\ntear that crape. Here, let me help you. Don’t you see, make it go in and\nout, that way; give it something to pull against.”\n\nEthel laughed. “That’s the third thing you have taught me--to thread a\nneedle, tie a bow, and stick in a pin! I never could learn those things\nof any one else; they show, but don’t explain the theory.”\n\nThey met Dr. May at the entrance of the town, very tired, and saying\nhe had been a long tramp, all over the place, and Mrs. Hoxton had been\nboring him with her fancies. As he took Richard’s arm he gave the long\nheavy sigh that always fell so painfully on Ethel’s ear.\n\n“Dear, dear, dear papa!” thought she, “my work must also be to do all I\ncan to comfort him.”\n\nHer reflections were broken off. Dr. May exclaimed, “Ethel, don’t make\nsuch a figure of yourself. Those muddy ankles and petticoats are not\nfit to be seen--there, now you are sweeping the pavement. Have you no\nmedium? One would think you had never worn a gown in your life before!”\n\nPoor Ethel stepped on before with mud-encrusted heels, and her father\nspeaking sharply in the weariness and soreness of his heart; her\ndraggle-tailed petticoats weighing down at once her missionary projects\nat Cocksmoor, and her tender visions of comforting her widowed father;\nher heart was full to overflowing, and where was the mother to hear her\ntroubles?\n\nShe opened the hall door, and would have rushed upstairs, but nurse\nhappened to be crossing the hall. “Miss Ethel! Miss Ethel, you aren’t\ngoing up with them boots on! I do declare you are just like one of the\nboys. And your frock!”\n\nEthel sat submissively down on the lowest step, and pulled off her\nboots. As she did so, her father and brother came in--the former\ndesiring Richard to come with him to the study, and write a note for\nhim. She hoped that thus she might have Margaret to herself, and hurried\ninto her room. Margaret was alone, maids and children at tea, and Flora\ndressing. The room was in twilight, with the red gleam of the fire\nplaying cheerfully over it.\n\n“Well, Ethel, have you had a pleasant walk?”\n\n“Yes--no--Oh, Margaret!” and throwing herself across the bottom of the\nbed, she burst into tears.\n\n“Ethel, dear, what is the matter? Papa--”\n\n“No--no--only I draggled my frock, and Richard threw cold water. And I\nam good for nothing! Oh! if mamma was but here!”\n\n“Darling Ethel, dear Ethel, I wish I could comfort you. Come a little\nnearer to me, I can’t reach you! Dear Ethel, what has gone wrong?”\n\n“Everything,” said Ethel. “No--I’m too dirty to come on your white bed;\nI forgot, you won’t like it,” added she, in an injured tone.\n\n“You are wet, you are cold, you are tired,” said Margaret. “Stay here\nand dress, don’t go up in the cold. There, sit by the fire pull off your\nfrock and stockings, and we will send for the others. Let me see you\nlook comfortable--there. Now tell me who threw cold water.”\n\n“It was figurative cold water,” said Ethel, smiling for a moment. “I was\nonly silly enough to tell Richard my plan, and it’s horrid to talk to\na person who only thinks one high-flying and nonsensical--and then came\nthe dirt.”\n\n“But what was the scheme, Ethel?”\n\n“Cocksmoor,” said Ethel, proceeding to unfold it.\n\n“I wish we could,” said Margaret. “It would be an excellent thing. But\nhow did Richard vex you?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said Ethel, “only he thought it would not do. Perhaps he\nsaid right, but it was coldly, and he smiled.”\n\n“He is too sober-minded for our flights,” said Margaret. “I know the\nfeeling of it, Ethel dear; but you know if he did see that some of\nyour plans might not answer, it is no reason you should not try to do\nsomething at once. You have not told me about the girl.”\n\nEthel proceeded to tell the history. “There!” said Margaret cheerfully,\n“there are two ways of helping Cocksmoor already. Could you not make\nsome clothes for the two grandchildren? I could help you a little,\nand then, if they were well clothed, you might get them to come to the\nSunday-school. And as to the twins, I wonder what the hire of a cart\nwould be to bring the christening party? It is just what Richard could\nmanage.”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel; “but those are only little isolated individual\nthings!”\n\n“But one must make a beginning.”\n\n“Then, Margaret, you think it was a real vow? You don’t think it silly\nof me?” said Ethel wistfully.\n\n“Ethel, dear, I don’t think dear mamma would say we ought to make vows,\nexcept what the church decrees for us. I don’t think she would like the\nnotion of your considering yourself pledged; but I do think, that, after\nall you have said and felt about Cocksmoor, and being led there on that\nday, it does seem as if we might be intended to make it our especial\ncharge.”\n\n“Oh, Margaret, I am glad you say so. You always understand.”\n\n“But you know we are so young, that now we have not her to judge for us,\nwe must only do little things that we are quite sure of, or we shall get\nwrong.”\n\n“That’s not the way great things were done.”\n\n“I don’t know, Ethel; I think great things can’t be good unless they\nstand on a sure foundation of little ones.”\n\n“Well, I believe Richard was right, and it would not do to begin on\nSunday, but he was so tame; and then my frock, and the horrid deficiency\nin those little neatnesses.”\n\n“Perhaps that is good for you in one way; you might get very high-flying\nif you had not the discipline of those little tiresome things,\ncorrecting them will help you, and keep your high things from being all\nromance. I know dear mamma used to say so; that the trying to conquer\nthem was a help to you. Oh, here’s Mary! Mary, will you get Ethel’s\ndressing things? She has come home wet-footed and cold, and has been\nwarming herself by my fire.”\n\nMary was happy to help, and Ethel was dressed and cheered by the time\nDr. May came in, for a hurried visit and report of his doings; Flora\nfollowed on her way from her room. Then all went to tea, leaving\nMargaret to have a visit from the little ones under charge of nurse. Two\nhours’ stay with her, that precious time when she knew that sad as the\ntalk often was, it was truly a comfort to him. It ended when ten o’clock\nstruck, and he went down--Margaret hearing the bell, the sounds of\nthe assembling servants, the shutting of the door, the stillness\nof prayer-time, the opening again, the feet moving off in different\ndirections, then brothers and sisters coming in to kiss her and bid her\ngood-night, nurse and Flora arranging her for the night, Flora coming\nto sleep in her little bed in the corner of the room, and, lastly, her\nfather’s tender good-night, and melancholy look at her, and all was\nquiet, except the low voices and movements as Richard attended him in\nhis own room.\n\nMargaret could think: “Dear, dear Ethel, how noble and high she is! But\nI am afraid! It is what people call a difficult, dangerous age, and the\ngrander she is, the greater danger of not managing her rightly. If those\nhigh purposes should run only into romance like mine, or grow out into\neccentricities and unfemininesses, what a grievous pity it would be! And\nI, so little older, so much less clever, with just sympathy enough not\nto be a wise restraint--I am the person who has the responsibility, and\noh, what shall I do? Mamma trusted to me to be a mother to them, papa\nlooks to me, and I so unfit, besides this helplessness. But God sent it,\nand put me in my place. He made me lie here, and will raise me up if it\nis good, so I trust He will help me with my sisters.”\n\n“Grant me to have a right judgment in all things, and evermore to\nrejoice in Thy holy comfort.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n\n     Something between a hindrance and a help.\n                                    WORDSWORTH.\n\n\nEtheldred awoke long before time for getting up, and lay pondering over\nher visions. Margaret had sympathised, and therefore they did not seem\nentirely aerial. To earn money by writing was her favourite plan, and\nshe called her various romances in turn before her memory, to judge\nwhich might be brought down to sober pen and ink. She considered till it\nbecame not too unreasonably early to get up. It was dark, but there was\na little light close to the window: she had no writing-paper, but she\nwould interline her old exercise-book. Down she ran, and crouching\nin the school-room window-seat, she wrote on in a trance of eager\ncomposition, till Norman called her, as he went to school, to help him\nto find a book.\n\nThis done, she went up to visit Margaret, to tell her the story, and\nconsult her. But this was not so easy. She found Margaret with little\nDaisy lying by her, and Tom sitting by the fire over his Latin.\n\n“Oh, Ethel, good-morning, dear! you are come just in time.”\n\n“To take baby?” said Ethel, as the child was fretting a little.\n\n“Yes, thank you, she has been very good, but she was tired of lying\nhere, and I can’t move her about,” said Margaret.\n\n“Oh, Margaret, I have such a plan,” said Ethel, as she walked about with\nlittle Gertrude; but Tom interrupted.\n\n“Margaret, will you see if I can say my lesson?” and the thumbed Latin\ngrammar came across her just as Dr. May’s door opened, and he came in\nexclaiming, “Latin grammar! Margaret, this is really too much for you.\nGood-morning, my dears. Ha! Tommy, take your book away, my boy. You must\nnot inflict that on sister now. There’s your regular master, Richard, in\nmy room, if it is fit for his ears yet. What, the little one here too?”\n\n“How is your arm, papa?” said Margaret. “Did it keep you awake?”\n\n“Not long--it set me dreaming though, and a very romantic dream it was,\nworthy of Ethel herself.”\n\n“What was it, papa?”\n\n“Oh, it was an odd thing, joining on strangely enough with one I had\nthree or four and twenty years ago, when I was a young man, hearing\nlectures at Edinburgh, and courting--” he stopped, and felt Margaret’s\npulse, asked her a few questions, and talked to the baby. Ethel longed\nto hear his dream, but thought he would not like to go on; however, he\ndid presently.\n\n“The old dream was the night after a picnic on Arthur’s Seat with the\nMackenzies; mamma and Aunt Flora were there. ‘Twas a regular boy’s\ndream, a tournament, or something of that nature, where I was victor,\nthe queen--you know who she was--giving me her token--a Daisy Chain.”\n\n“That is why you like to call us your Daisy Chain,” said Ethel.\n\n“Did you write it in verse?” said Margaret. “I think I once saw some\nverses like it in her desk.”\n\n“I was in love, and three-and-twenty,” said the doctor, looking drolly\nguilty in the midst of his sadness. “Ay, those fixed it in my memory,\nperhaps my fancy made it more distinct than it really was. An evening\nor two ago I met with them, and that stirred it up I suppose. Last\nnight came the tournament again, but it was the melee, a sense of being\ncrushed down, suffocated by the throng of armed knights and horses--pain\nand wounds--and I looked in vain through the opposing overwhelming\nhost for my--my Maggie. Well, I got the worst of it, my sword arm was\nbroken--I fell, was stifled--crushed--in misery--all I could do was to\ngrasp my token--my Daisy Chain,” and he pressed Margaret’s hand as he\nsaid so. “And, behold, the tumult and despair were passed. I lay on the\ngrass in the cloisters, and the Daisy Chain hung from the sky, and was\ndrawing me upwards. There--it is a queer dream for a sober old country\ndoctor. I don’t know why I told you, don’t tell any one again.”\n\nAnd he walked away, muttering. “For he told me his dreams, talked of\neating and drinking,” leaving Margaret with her eyes full of tears, and\nEthel vehemently caressing the baby.\n\n“How beautiful!” said Ethel.\n\n“It has been a comfort to him, I am sure,” said Margaret.\n\n“You don’t think it ominous,” said Ethel with a slight tremulous voice.\n\n“More soothing than anything else. It is what we all feel, is it not?\nthat this little daisy bud is the link between us and heaven?”\n\n“But about him. He was victor at first--vanquished the next time.”\n\n“I think--if it is to have an interpretation, though I am not sure we\nought to take it so seriously, it would only mean that in younger days\npeople care for victory and distinction in this world, like Norman, or\nas papa most likely did then; but, as they grow older, they care less,\nand others pass them, and they know it does not signify, for in our race\nall may win.”\n\n“But he has a great name. How many people come from a distance to\nconsult him! he is looked upon, too, in other ways! he can do anything\nwith the corporation.”\n\nMargaret smiled. “All this does not sound grand--it is not as if he had\nset up in London.”\n\n“Oh, dear, I am so glad he did not.”\n\n“Shall I tell you what mamma told me he said about it, when Uncle\nMackenzie said he ought? He answered that he thought health and happy\nhome attachments were a better provision for us to set out in life with\nthan thousands.”\n\n“I am sure he was right!” said Ethel earnestly. “Then you don’t think\nthe dream meant being beaten, only that our best things are not gained\nby successes in this world?”\n\n“Don’t go and let it dwell on your mind as a vision,” said Margaret. “I\nthink dear mamma would call that silly.”\n\nAn interruption occurred, and Ethel had to go down to breakfast with a\nmind floating between romance, sorrow, and high aspirations, very unlike\nthe actual world she had to live in. First, there was a sick man walking\ninto the study, and her father, laying down his letters, saying, “I must\ndespatch him before prayers, I suppose. I’ve a great mind to say I never\nwill see any one who won’t keep to my days.”\n\n“I can’t imagine why they don’t,” said Flora, as he went. “He is always\nsaying so, but never acting on it. If he would once turn one away, the\nrest would mind.”\n\nRichard went on in silence, cutting bread and butter.\n\n“There’s another ring,” said Mary.\n\n“Yes, he is caught now, they’ll go on in a stream. I shall not keep\nMargaret waiting for her breakfast, I shall take it up.”\n\nThe morning was tiresome; though Dr. May had two regular days for seeing\npoor people at his house, he was too good-natured to keep strictly to\nthem, and this day, as Flora had predicted, there was a procession of\nthem not soon got rid of, even by his rapid queries and the talismanic\nfigures made by his left hand on scraps of paper, with which he sent\nthem off to the infirmary. Ethel tried to read; the children lingered\nabout; it was a trial of temper to all but Tom, who obtained Richard’s\nattention to his lessons. He liked to say them to his brother, and was\nan incentive to learn them quickly, that none might remain for Miss\nWinter when Richard went out with his father. If mamma had been there,\nshe would have had prayers; but now no one had authority enough, though\nthey did at last even finish breakfast. Just as the gig came to the\ndoor, Dr. May dismissed his last patient, rang the bell in haste, and\nas soon as prayers were over, declared he had an appointment, and had no\ntime to eat. There was a general outcry that it was bad enough when he\nwas well, and now he must not take liberties; Flora made him drink some\ntea; and Richard placed morsels in his way, while he read his letters.\nHe ran up for a final look at Margaret, almost upset the staid Miss\nWinter as he ran down again, called Richard to take the reins, and was\noff.\n\nIt was French day, always a trial to Ethel. M. Ballompre, the master,\nknew what was good and bad French, but could not render a reason,\nand Ethel, being versed in the principles of grammar, from her Latin\nstudies, chose to know the why and wherefore of his corrections--she did\nnot like to see her pages defaced, and have no security against future\nerrors; while he thought her a troublesome pupil, and was put out by\nher questions. They wrangled, Miss Winter was displeased, and Ethel felt\ninjured.\n\nMary’s inability to catch the pronunciation, and her hopeless dull look\nwhen she found that coeur must not be pronounced cour, nor cur, but\nsomething between, to which her rosy English lips could never come--all\nthis did not tease M. Ballompre, for he was used to it.\n\nHis mark for Ethel’s lesson was “de l’humeur.”\n\n“I am sorry,” said Miss Winter, when he was gone. “I thought you had\noutgrown that habit of disputing over every phrase.”\n\n“I can’t tell how a language is to be learned without knowing the\nreasons of one’s mistakes,” said Ethel.\n\n“That is what you always say, my dear. It is of no use to renew it all,\nbut I wish you would control yourself. Now, Mary, call Blanche, and you\nand Ethel take your arithmetic.”\n\nSo Flora went to read to Margaret, while Blanche went lightly and\nplayfully through her easy lessons, and Mary floundered piteously over\nthe difficulties of Compound Long Division. Ethel’s mind was in too\nirritated and tumultuous a state for her to derive her usual solace from\nCube Root. Her sum was wrong, and she wanted to work it right, but Miss\nWinter, who had little liking for the higher branches of arithmetic,\nsaid she had spent time enough over it, and summoned her to an\nexamination such as the governess was very fond of and often practised.\nEthel thought it useless, and was teased by it; and though her answers\nwere chiefly correct, they were given in an irritated tone. It was of\nthis kind:--\n\n\n        What is the date of the invention of paper?\n        What is the latitude and longitude of Otaheite?\n        What are the component parts of brass?\n        Whence is cochineal imported?\n\n\nWhen this was over, Ethel had to fetch her mending-basket, and Mary her\nbook of selections; the piece for to-day’s lesson was the quarrel of\nBrutus and Cassius; and Mary’s dull droning tone was a trial to her\nears; she presently exclaimed, “Oh, Mary, don’t murder it!”\n\n“Murder what?” said Mary, opening wide her light blue eyes.\n\n“That use of exaggerated language,--” began Miss Winter.\n\n“I’ve heard papa say it,” said Ethel, only wanting to silence Miss\nWinter. In a cooler moment she would not have used the argument.\n\n“All that a gentleman may say, may not be a precedent for a young lady;\nbut you are interrupting Mary.”\n\n“Only let me show her. I can’t bear to hear her, listen, Mary.\n\n\n        “What shall one of us\n         That struck the foremost”--\n\n\n“That is declaiming,” said Miss Winter. “It is not what we wish for in a\nlady. You are neglecting your work and interfering.”\n\nEthel made a fretful contortion, and obeyed. So it went on all the\nmorning, Ethel’s eagerness checked by Miss Winter’s dry manner,\nproducing pettishness, till Ethel, in a state between self-reproach\nand a sense of injustice, went up to prepare for dinner, and to visit\nMargaret on the way.\n\nShe found her sister picking a merino frock to pieces. “See here,” she\nsaid eagerly, “I thought you would like to make up this old frock for\none of the Cocksmoor children; but what is the matter?” as Ethel did not\nshow the lively interest that she expected.\n\n“Oh, nothing, only Miss Winter is so tiresome.”\n\n“What was it?”\n\n“Everything, it was all horrid. I was cross, I know, but she and M.\nBallompre made me so;” and Ethel was in the midst of the narration of\nher grievances, when Norman came in. The school was half a mile off, but\nhe had not once failed to come home, in the interval allowed for play\nafter dinner, to inquire for his sister.\n\n“Well, Norman, you are out of breath, sit down and rest. What is doing\nat school; are you dux of your class?”\n\n“Yes,” said the boy wearily.\n\n“What mark for the verses?” said Ethel.\n\n“Quam bene.”\n\n“Not optime?”\n\n“No, they were tame,” Dr. Hoxton said.\n\n“What is Harry doing?” said Margaret.\n\n“He is fourth in his form. I left him at football.”\n\n“Dinner!” said Flora at the door. “What will you have, Margaret?”\n\n“I’ll fetch it,” said Norman, who considered it his privilege to wait\non Margaret at dinner. When he had brought the tray, he stood leaning\nagainst the bed-post, musing. Suddenly, there was a considerable clatter\nof fire-irons, and his violent start surprised Margaret.\n\n“Ethel has been poking the fire,” she said, as if no more was needed to\naccount for their insecurity. Norman put them up again, but a ringing\nsound betrayed that it was not with a firm touch, and when, a minute\nafter, he came to take her plate, she saw that he was trying with effort\nto steady his hand.\n\n“Norman, dear, are you sure you are well?”\n\n“Yes, very well,” said he, as if vexed that she had taken any notice.\n\n“You had better not come racing home. I’m not worth inquiries now, I am\nso much better,” said she, smiling.\n\nHe made no reply, but this was not consenting silence.\n\n“I don’t like you to lose your football,” she proceeded.\n\n“I could not--” and he stopped short.\n\n“It would be much better for you,” said she, looking up in his face with\nanxious affectionate eyes, but he shunned her glance and walked away\nwith her plate.\n\nFlora had been in such close attendance upon Margaret, that she needed\nsome cheerful walks, and though she had some doubts how affairs at\nhome would go on without her, she was overruled, and sent on a long\nexpedition with Miss Winter and Mary, while Ethel remained with\nMargaret.\n\nThe only delay before setting out, was that nurse came in, saying, “If\nyou please, Miss Margaret, there is a girl come to see about the place.”\n\nThe sisters looked at each other and smiled, while Margaret asked whence\nshe came, and who she was.\n\n“Her name is Taylor, and she comes from Cocksmoor, but she is a nice,\ntidy, strong-looking girl, and she says she has been used to children.”\n\nNurse had fallen into the trap most comfortably, and seemed bent upon\ntaking this girl as a choice of her own. She wished to know if Miss\nMargaret would like to see her.\n\n“If you please, nurse, but if you think she will do, that is enough.”\n\n“Yes, Miss, but you should look to them things yourself. If you please,\nI’ll bring her up.” So nurse departed.\n\n“Charming!” cried Ethel, “that’s your capital management, Flora; nurse\nthinks she has done it all herself.”\n\n“She is your charge though,” said Flora, “coming from your own beloved\nCocksmoor.”\n\nLucy Taylor came in, looking very nice, and very shy, curtseying low, in\nextreme awe of the pale lady in bed. Margaret was much pleased with her,\nand there was no more to be done but to settle that she should come on\nSaturday, and to let nurse take her into the town to invest her with the\nuniversal blackness of the household, where the two Margarets were the\nonly white things.\n\nThis arranged, and the walking party set forth, Ethel sat down by her\nsister’s bed, and began to assist in unpicking the merino, telling\nMargaret how much obliged she was to her for thinking of it, and how\ngrieved at having been so ungrateful in the morning. She was very happy\nover her contrivances, cutting out under her sister’s superintendence.\nShe had forgotten the morning’s annoyance, till Margaret said, “I have\nbeen thinking of what you said about Miss Winter, and really I don’t\nknow what is to be done.”\n\n“Oh, Margaret, I did not mean to worry you,” said Ethel, sorry to see\nher look uneasy.\n\n“I like you to tell me everything, dear Ethel; but I don’t see clearly\nthe best course. We must go on with Miss Winter.”\n\n“Of course,” said Ethel, shocked at her murmurs having even suggested\nthe possibility of a change, and having, as well as all the others, a\ngreat respect and affection for her governess.\n\n“We could not get on without her even if I were well,” continued\nMargaret; “and dear mamma had such perfect trust in her, and we all know\nand love her so well--it would make us put up with a great deal.”\n\n“It is all my own fault,” said Ethel, only anxious to make amends to\nMiss Winter. “I wish you would not say anything about it.”\n\n“Yes, it does seem wrong even to think of it,” said Margaret, “when she\nhas been so very kind. It is a blessing to have any one to whom Mary and\nBlanche may so entirely be trusted. But for you--”\n\n“It is my own fault,” repeated Ethel.\n\n“I don’t think it is quite all your own fault,” said Margaret, “and that\nis the difficulty. I know dear mamma thought Miss Winter an excellent\ngoverness for the little ones, but hardly up to you, and she saw that\nyou worried and fidgeted each other, so, you know, she used to keep the\nteaching of you a good deal in her own hands.”\n\n“I did not know that was the reason,” said Ethel, overpowered by the\nrecollection of the happy morning’s work she had often done in that\nvery room, when her mother had not been equal to the bustle of the\nwhole school-room. That watchful, protecting, guarding, mother’s love,\na shadow of Providence, had been round them so constantly on every side,\nthat they had been hardly conscious of it till it was lost to them.\n\n“Was it not like her?” said Margaret, “but now, my poor Ethel, I don’t\nthink it would be right by you or by Miss Winter, to take you out of the\nschool-room. I think it would grieve her.”\n\n“I would not do that for the world.”\n\n“Especially after her kind nursing of me, and even, with more reason, it\nwould not be becoming in us to make changes. Besides, King Etheldred,”\n said Margaret, smiling, “we all know you are a little bit of a sloven,\nand, as nurse says, some one must be always after you, and do you know?\neven if I were well, I had rather it was Miss Winter than me.”\n\n“Oh, no, you would not be formal and precise--you would not make me\ncross.”\n\n“Perhaps you might make me so,” said Margaret, “or I should let you\nalone, and leave you a slattern. We should both hate it so! No, don’t\nmake me your mistress, Ethel dear--let me be your sister and play-fellow\nstill, as well as I can.”\n\n“You are, you are. I don’t care half so much when I have got you.”\n\n“And will you try to bear with her, and remember it is right in the\nmain, though it is troublesome?”\n\n“That I will. I won’t plague you again. I know it is bad for you, you\nlook tired.”\n\n“Pray don’t leave off telling me,” said Margaret--“it is just what I\nwish on my own account, and I know it is comfortable to have a good\ngrumble.”\n\n“If it does not hurt you, but I am sure you are not easy now--are you?”\n\n“Only my back,” said Margaret. “I have been sitting up longer than\nusual, and it is tired. Will you call nurse to lay me flat again?”\n\nThe nursery was deserted--all were out, and Ethel came back in\ntrepidation at the notion of having to do it herself, though she knew\nit was only to put one arm to support her sister, while, with the other,\nshe removed the pillows; but Ethel was conscious of her own awkwardness\nand want of observation, nor had Margaret entire trust in her. Still she\nwas too much fatigued to wait, so Ethel was obliged to do her best. She\nwas careful and frightened, and therefore slow and unsteady. She trusted\nthat all was right, and Margaret tried to believe so, though still\nuneasy.\n\nEthel began to read to her, and Dr. May came home. She looked up\nsmiling, and asked where he had been, but it was vain to try to keep him\nfrom reading her face. He saw in an instant that something was amiss,\nand drew from her a confession that her back was aching a little. He\nknew she might have said a great deal--she was not in a comfortable\nposition--she must be moved. She shook her head--she had rather\nwait--there was a dread of being again lifted by Ethel that she could\nnot entirely hide. Ethel was distressed, Dr. May was angry, and, no\nwonder, when he saw Margaret suffer, felt his own inability to help,\nmissed her who had been wont to take all care from his hands, and was\nvexed to see a tall strong girl of fifteen, with the full use of both\narms, and plenty of sense, incapable of giving any assistance, and only\ndoing harm by trying.\n\n“It is of no use,” said he. “Ethel will give no attention to anything\nbut her books! I’ve a great mind to put an end to all the Latin and\nGreek! She cares for nothing else.”\n\nEthel could little brook injustice, and much as she was grieving, she\nexclaimed, “Papa, papa, I do care--now don’t I, Margaret? I did my\nbest!”\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense. Your best, indeed! If you had taken the most\nmoderate care--”\n\n“I believe Ethel took rather too much care,” said Margaret, much\nmore harassed by the scolding than by the pain. “It will be all right\npresently. Never mind, dear papa.”\n\nBut he was not only grieved for the present, but anxious for the future;\nand, though he knew it was bad for Margaret to manifest his displeasure,\nhe could not restrain it, and continued to blame Ethel with enough\nof injustice to set her on vindication, whereupon he silenced her, by\ntelling her she was making it worse by self-justification when Margaret\nought to be quiet. Margaret tried to talk of other things, but was in\ntoo much discomfort to exert herself enough to divert his attention.\n\nAt last Flora returned, and saw in an instant what was wanted. Margaret\nwas settled in the right posture, but the pain would not immediately\ndepart, and Dr. May soon found out that she had a headache, of which he\nknew he was at least as guilty as Etheldred could be.\n\nNothing could be done but keep her quiet, and Ethel went away to be\nmiserable; Flora tried to comfort her by saying it was unfortunate, but\nno doubt there was a knack, and everyone could not manage those things;\nMargaret was easier now, and as to papa’s anger, he did not always mean\nall he said.\n\nBut consolation came at bedtime; Margaret received her with open arms\nwhen she went to wish her goodnight. “My poor Ethel,” she said, holding\nher close, “I am sorry I have made such a fuss.”\n\n“Oh, you did not, it was too bad of me--I am grieved; are you quite\ncomfortable now?”\n\n“Yes, quite, only a little headache, which I shall sleep off. It has\nbeen so nice and quiet. Papa took up George Herbert, and has been\nreading me choice bits. I don’t think I have enjoyed anything so much\nsince I have been ill.”\n\n“I am glad of that, but I have been unhappy all the evening. I wish I\nknew what to do. I am out of heart about everything!”\n\n“Only try to mind and heed, and you will learn. It will be a step if you\nwill only put your shoes side by side when you take them off.”\n\nEthel smiled and sighed, and Margaret whispered, “Don’t grieve about me,\nbut put your clever head to rule your hands, and you will do for home\nand Cocksmoor too. Good-night, dearest.”\n\n“I’ve vexed papa,” sighed Ethel--and just then he came into the room.\n\n“Papa,” said Margaret, “here’s poor Ethel, not half recovered from her\ntroubles.”\n\nHe was now at ease about Margaret, and knew he had been harsh to another\nof his motherless girls.\n\n“Ah! we must send her to the infant-school, to learn ‘this is my right\nhand, and this is my left,’” said he, in his half-gay, half-sad manner.\n\n“I was very stupid,” said Ethel.\n\n“Poor child!” said her papa, “she is worse off than I am. If I have but\none hand left, she has two left hands.”\n\n“I do mean to try, papa.”\n\n“Yes, you must, Ethel. I believe I was hasty with you, my poor girl. I\nwas vexed, and we have no one to smooth us down. I am sorry, my dear,\nbut you must bear with me, for I never learned her ways with you when I\nmight. We will try to have more patience with each other.”\n\nWhat could Ethel do but hang round his neck and cry, till he said, but\ntenderly, that they had given Margaret quite disturbance enough to-day,\nand sent her to bed, vowing to watch each little action, lest she should\nagain give pain to such a father and sister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n\n     “Tis not enough that Greek or Roman page\n      At stated hours, his freakish thoughts engage,\n      Even in his pastimes he requires a friend\n      To warn and teach him safely to unbend,\n      O’er all his pleasures gently to preside,\n      Watch his emotions, and control their tide.”--COWPER.\n\n\nThe misfortunes of that day disheartened and disconcerted Etheldred. To\ndo mischief where she most wished to do good, to grieve where she longed\nto comfort, seemed to be her fate; it was vain to attempt anything for\nanyone’s good, while all her warm feelings and high aspirations were\nthwarted by the awkward ungainly hands and heedless eyes that Nature had\ngiven her. Nor did the following day, Saturday, do much for her\ncomfort, by giving her the company of her brothers. That it was Norman’s\nsixteenth birthday seemed only to make it worse. Their father had\napparently forgotten it, and Norman stopped Blanche when she was going\nto put him in mind of it; stopped her by such a look as the child never\nforgot, though there was no anger in it. In reply to Ethel’s inquiry\nwhat he was going to do that morning, he gave a yawn and stretch, and\nsaid, dejectedly, that he had got some Euripides to look over, and some\nverses to finish.\n\n“I am sorry; this is the first time you ever have not managed so as to\nmake a real holiday of your Saturday!”\n\n“I could not help it, and there’s nothing to do,” said Norman wearily.\n\n“I promised to go and read to Margaret while Flora does her music,” said\nEthel; “I shall come after that and do my Latin and Greek with you.”\n\nMargaret would not keep her long, saying she liked her to be with\nNorman, but she found him with his head sunk on his open book, fast\nasleep. At dinner-time, Harry and Tom, rushing in, awoke him with a\nviolent start.\n\n“Halloo! Norman, that was a jump!” said Harry, as his brother stretched\nand pinched himself. “You’ll jump out of your skin some of these days,\nif you don’t take care!”\n\n“It’s enough to startle any one to be waked up with such a noise,” said\nEthel.\n\n“Then he ought to sleep at proper times,” said Harry, “and not be waking\nme up with tumbling about, and hallooing out, and talking in his sleep\nhalf the night.”\n\n“Talking in his sleep! why, just now, you said he did not sleep,” said\nEthel.\n\n“Harry knows nothing about it,” said Norman.\n\n“Don’t I? Well, I only know, if you slept in school, and were a junior,\nyou would get a proper good licking for going on as you do at night.”\n\n“And I think you might chance to get a proper good licking for not\nholding your tongue,” said Norman, which hint reduced Harry to silence.\n\nDr. May was not come home; he had gone with Richard far into the\ncountry, and was to return to tea. He was thought to be desirous of\navoiding the family dinners that used to be so delightful. Harry was\nimpatient to depart, and when Mary and Tom ran after him, he ordered\nthem back.\n\n“Where can he be going?” said Mary, as she looked wistfully after him.\n\n“I know,” said Tom.\n\n“Where? Do tell me.”\n\n“Only don’t tell papa. I went down with him to the playground this\nmorning, and there they settled it. The Andersons, and Axworthy, and he,\nare going to hire a gun, and shoot pee-wits on Cocksmoor.”\n\n“But they ought not; should they?” said Mary. “Papa would be very\nangry.”\n\n“Anderson said there was no harm in it, but Harry told me not to tell.\nIndeed, Anderson would have boxed my ears for hearing, when I could not\nhelp it.”\n\n“But Harry would not let him?”\n\n“Ay. Harry is quite a match for Harvey Anderson, though he is so much\nyounger; and he said he would not have me bullied.”\n\n“That’s a good Harry! But I wish he would not go out shooting!” said\nMary.\n\n“Mind, you don’t tell.”\n\n“And where’s Hector Ernescliffe? Would not he go?”\n\n“No. I like Hector. He did not choose to go, though Anderson teased him,\nand said he was a poor Scot, and his brother didn’t allow him tin enough\nto buy powder and shot. If Harry would have stayed at home, he would\nhave come up here, and we might have had some fun in the garden.”\n\n“I wish he would. We never have any fun now,” said Mary; “but oh! there\nhe is,” as she spied Hector peeping over the gate which led from the\nfield into the garden. It was the first time that he had been to Dr.\nMay’s since his brother’s departure, and he was rather shy, but the\njoyful welcome of Mary and Tom took off all reluctance, and they claimed\nhim for a good game at play in the wood-house. Mary ran upstairs to beg\nto be excused the formal walk, and, luckily for her, Miss Winter was\nin Margaret’s room. Margaret asked if it was very wet and dirty, and\nhearing “not very,” gave gracious permission, and off went Mary and\nBlanche to construct some curious specimens of pottery, under the\nsuperintendence of Hector and Tom. There was a certain ditch where\nyellow mud was attainable, whereof the happy children concocted marbles\nand vases, which underwent a preparatory baking in the boys’ pockets,\nthat they might not crack in the nursery fire. Margaret only stipulated\nthat her sisters should be well fenced in brown holland, and when Miss\nWinter looked grave, said, “Poor things, a little thorough play will do\nthem a great deal of good.”\n\nMiss Winter could not see the good of groping in the dirt; and Margaret\nperceived that it would be one of her difficulties to know how to\nfollow out her mother’s views for the children, without vexing the good\ngoverness by not deferring to her.\n\nIn the meantime, Norman had disconsolately returned to his Euripides,\nand Ethel, who wanted to stay with him and look out his words, was\nordered out by Miss Winter, because she had spent all yesterday indoors.\nMiss Winter was going to stay with Margaret, and Ethel and Flora coaxed\nNorman to come with them, “just one mile on the turnpike road and back\nagain; he would be much fresher for his Greek afterwards.”\n\nHe came, but he did not enliven his sisters. The three plodded on,\ntaking a diligent constitutional walk, exchanging very few words, and\nthose chiefly between the girls. Flora gathered some hoary clematis,\nand red berries, and sought in the hedge-sides for some crimson “fairy\nbaths” to carry home; and, at the sight of the amusement Margaret\nderived from the placing the beauteous little Pezizas in a saucer of\ndamp green moss, so as to hide the brown sticks on which they grew,\nEthel took shame to herself for want of perception of little attentions.\nWhen she told Norman so, he answered, “There’s no one who does see what\nis the right thing. How horrid the room looks! Everything is nohow!”\n added he, looking round at the ornaments and things on the tables, which\nhad lost their air of comfort and good taste. It was not disorder, and\nEthel could not see what he meant. “What’s wrong?” said she.\n\n“Oh, never mind--you can’t do it. Don’t try--you’ll only make it worse.\nIt will never be the same as long as we live.”\n\n“I wish you would not be so unhappy!” said Ethel.\n\n“Never mind,” again said Norman, but he put his arm round her.\n\n“Have you done your Euripides? Can I help you? Will you construe it with\nme, or shall I look out your words?”\n\n“Thank you, I don’t mind that. It is the verses! I want some sense!”\n said Norman, running his fingers through his hair till it stood on end.\n“‘Tis such a horrid subject, Coral Islands! As if there was anything to\nbe said about them.”\n\n“Dear me, Norman, I could say ten thousand things, only I must not tell\nyou what mine are, as yours are not done.”\n\n“No, don’t,” said Norman decidedly.\n\n“Did you read the description of them in the Quarterly? I am sure you\nmight get some ideas there. Shall I find it for you? It is in an old\nnumber.”\n\n“Well, do; thank you.”\n\nHe rested listlessly on the sofa while his sister rummaged in a\nchiffonier. At last she found the article, and eagerly read him the\ndescription of the strange forms of the coral animals, and the beauties\nof their flower-like feelers and branching fabrics. It would once\nhave delighted him, but his first comment was, “Nasty little brutes!”\n However, the next minute he thanked her, took the book, and said he\ncould hammer something out of it, though it was too bad to give such an\nunclassical subject. At dusk he left off, saying he should get it done\nat night, his senses would come then, and he should be glad to sit up.\n\n“Only three weeks to the holidays,” said Ethel, trying to be cheerful;\nbut his assent was depressing, and she began to fear that Christmas\nwould only make them more sad.\n\nMary did not keep Tom’s secret so inviolably, but that, while they were\ndressing for tea, she revealed to Ethel where Harry was gone. He was\nnot yet returned, though his father and Richard were come in, and the\nsisters were at once in some anxiety on his account, and doubt whether\nthey ought to let papa know of his disobedience.\n\nFlora and Ethel, who were the first in the drawing-room, had a\nconsultation.\n\n“I should have told mamma directly,” said Flora.\n\n“He never did so,” sighed Ethel; “things never went wrong then.”\n\n“Oh, yes, they did; don’t you remember how naughty Harry was about\nclimbing the wall, and making faces at Mrs. Richardson’s servants?”\n\n“And how ill I behaved the first day of last Christmas holidays?”\n\n“She knew, but I don’t think she told papa.”\n\n“Not that we knew of, but I believe she did tell him everything, and I\nthink, Flora, he ought to know everything, especially now. I never could\nbear the way the Mackenzies used to have of thinking their parents must\nbe like enemies, and keeping secrets from them.”\n\n“They were always threatening each other, ‘I’ll tell mamma,’” said\nFlora, “and calling us tell-tales because we told our own dear mamma\neverything. But it is not like that now--I neither like to worry papa,\nnor to bring Harry into disgrace--besides, Tom and Mary meant it for a\nsecret.”\n\n“Papa would not be angry with him if we told him it was a secret,” said\nEthel; “I wish Harry would come in. There’s the door--oh! it is only\nyou.”\n\n“Whom did you expect?” said Richard, entering.\n\nThe sisters looked at each other, and Ethel, after an interval,\nexplained their doubts about Harry.\n\n“He is come in,” said Richard; “I saw him running up to his own room,\nvery muddy.”\n\n“Oh, I’m glad! But do you think papa ought to hear it? I don’t know\nwhat’s to be done. ‘Tis the children’s secret,” said Flora.\n\n“It will never do to have him going out with those boys continually,”\n said Ethel--“Harvey Anderson close by all the holidays!”\n\n“I’ll try what I can do with him,” said Richard. “Papa had better not\nhear it now, at any rate. He is very tired and sad this evening! and\nhis arm is painful again, so we must not worry him with histories of\nnaughtiness among the children.”\n\n“No,” said Ethel decidedly, “I am glad you were there, Ritchie; I never\nshould have thought of one time being better than another.”\n\n“Just like Ethel!” said Flora, smiling.\n\n“Why should not you learn?” said Richard gently.\n\n“I can’t,” said Ethel, in a desponding way.\n\n“Why not? You are much sharper than most people, and, if you tried, you\nwould know those things much better than I do, as you know how to learn\nhistory.”\n\n“It is quite a different sort of cleverness,” said Flora. “Recollect Sir\nIsaac Newton, or Archimedes.”\n\n“Then you must have both sorts,” said Ethel, “for you can do things\nnicely, and yet you learn very fast.”\n\n“Take care, Ethel, you are singeing your frock! Well, I really don’t\nthink you can help those things!” said Flora. “Your short sight is the\nreason of it, and it is of no use to try to mend it.”\n\n“Don’t tell her so,” said Richard. “It can’t be all short sight--it is\nthe not thinking. I do believe that if Ethel would think, no one would\ndo things so well. Don’t you remember the beautiful perspective drawing\nshe made of this room for me to take to Oxford? That was very difficult,\nand wanted a great deal of neatness and accuracy, so why should she not\nbe neat and accurate in other things? And I know you can read faces,\nEthel--why don’t you look there before you speak?”\n\n“Ah! before instead of after, when I only see I have said something\nmalapropos,” said Ethel.\n\n“I must go and see about the children,” said Flora; “if the tea comes\nwhile I am gone, will you make it, Ritchie?”\n\n“Flora despairs of me,” said Ethel.\n\n“I don’t,” said Richard. “Have you forgotten how to put in a pin yet?”\n\n“No; I hope not.”\n\n“Well, then, see if you can’t learn to make tea; and, by-the-bye, Ethel,\nwhich is the next christening Sunday?”\n\n“The one after next, surely. The first of December is Monday--yes,\nto-morrow week is the next.”\n\n“Then I have thought of something; it would cost eighteenpence to hire\nJoliffe’s spring-cart, and we might have Mrs. Taylor and the twins\nbrought to church in it. Should you like to walk to Cocksmoor and settle\nit?”\n\n“Oh yes, very much indeed. What a capital thought. Margaret said you\nwould know how to manage.”\n\n“Then we will go the first fine day papa does not want me.”\n\n“I wonder if I could finish my purple frocks. But here’s the tea. Now,\nRichard, don’t tell me to make it. I should do something wrong, and\nFlora will never forgive you.”\n\nRichard would not let her off. He stood over her, counted her shovelfuls\nof tea, and watched the water into the teapot--he superintended her\nwarming the cups, and putting a drop into each saucer. “Ah!” said Ethel,\nwith a concluding sigh, “it makes one hotter than double equations!”\n\nIt was all right, as Flora allowed with a slightly superior smile. She\nthought Richard would never succeed in making a notable or elegant woman\nof Ethel, and it was best that the two sisters should take different\nlines. Flora knew that, though clever and with more accomplishments,\nshe could not surpass Ethel in intellectual attainments, but she was\ncertainly far more valuable in the house, and had been proved to have\njust the qualities in which her sister was most deficient. She did not\nrelish hearing that Ethel wanted nothing but attention to be more than\nher equal, and she thought Richard mistaken. Flora’s remembrance of\ntheir time of distress was less unmixedly wretched than it was with the\nothers, for she knew she had done wonders.\n\nThe next day Norman told Ethel that he had got on very well with the\nverses, and finished them off late at night. He showed them to her\nbefore taking them to school on Monday morning, and Ethel thought\nthey were the best he had ever written. There was too much spirit and\npoetical beauty for a mere schoolboy task, and she begged for the foul\ncopy to show it to her father. “I have not got it,” said Norman. “The\nfoul copy was not like these; but when I was writing them out quite\nlate, it was all I don’t know how. Flora’s music was in my ears, and the\nroom seemed to get larger, and like an ocean cave; and when the candle\nflickered, ‘twas like the green glowing light of the sun through the\nwaves.”\n\n“As it says here,” said Ethel.\n\n“And the words all came to me of themselves in beautiful flowing Latin,\njust right, as if it was anybody but myself doing it, and they ran off\nmy pen in red and blue and gold, and all sorts of colours; and fine\nbranching zig-zagging stars, like what the book described, only\nstranger, came dancing and radiating round my pen and the candle. I\ncould hardly believe the verses would scan by daylight, but I can’t find\na mistake. Do you try them again.”\n\nEthel scanned. “I see nothing wrong,” she said, “but it seems a shame to\nbegin scanning Undine’s verses, they are too pretty. I wish I could copy\nthem. It must have been half a dream.”\n\n“I believe it was; they don’t seem like my own.”\n\n“Did you dream afterwards?”\n\nHe shivered. “They had got into my head too much; my ears sang like the\nroaring of the sea, and I thought my feet were frozen on to an iceberg:\nthen came darkness, and sea monsters, and drowning--it was too horrid!”\n and his face expressed all, and more than all, he said. “But ‘tis a\nquarter to seven--we must go,” said he, with a long yawn, and rubbing\nhis eyes. “You are sure they are right, Ethel? Harry, come along.”\n\nEthel thought those verses ought to make a sensation, but all that\ncame of them was a Quam optime, and when she asked Norman if no special\nnotice had been taken of them, he said, in his languid way, “No; only\nDr. Hoxton said they were better than usual.”\n\nEthel did not even have the satisfaction of hearing that Mr. Wilmot,\nhappening to meet Dr. May, said to him, “Your boy has more of a poet\nin him than any that has come in my way. He really sometimes makes very\nstriking verses.”\n\nRichard watched for an opportunity of speaking to Harry, which did not\nat once occur, as the boy spent very little of his time at home, and, as\nif by tacit consent, he and Norman came in later every evening. At last,\non Thursday, in the additional two hours’ leisure allowed to the boys,\nwhen the studious prepared their tasks, and the idle had some special\ndiversion, Richard encountered him running up to his own room to fetch a\nnewly-invented instrument for projecting stones.\n\n“I’ll walk back to school with you,” said Richard. “I mean to run,”\n returned Harry.\n\n“Is there so much hurry?” said Richard. “I am sorry for it, for I wanted\nto speak to you, Harry; I have something to show you.”\n\nHis manner conveyed that it related to their mother, and the sobering\neffect was instantaneous. “Very well,” said he, forgetting his haste.\n“I’ll come into your room.”\n\nThe awe-struck, shy, yet sorrowful look on his rosy face showed\npreparation enough, and Richard’s only preface was to say, “It is a\nbit of a letter that she was in course of writing to Aunt Flora, a\ndescription of us all. The letter itself is gone, but here is a copy of\nit. I thought you would like to read what relates to yourself.”\n\nRichard laid before him the sheet of notepaper on which this portion of\nthe letter was written, and left him alone with it, while he set out on\nthe promised walk with Ethel.\n\nThey found the old woman, Granny Hall, looking like another creature,\nsmoke-dried and withered indeed, but all briskness and animation.\n\n“Well! be it you, sir, and the young lady?”\n\n“Yes; here we are come to see you again,” said Richard. “I hope you are\nnot disappointed that I’ve brought my sister this time instead of the\ndoctor.”\n\n“No, no, sir; I’ve done with the doctor for this while,” said the old\nwoman, to Ethel’s great amusement. “He have done me a power of good, and\nthank him for it heartily; but the young lady is right welcome here--but\n‘tis a dirty walk for her.”\n\n“Never mind that,” said Ethel, a little shyly, “I came--where are your\ngrandchildren?”\n\n“Oh, somewhere out among the blocks. They gets out with the other\nchildren; I can’t be always after them.”\n\n“I wanted to know if these would fit them,” said Ethel, beginning to\nundo her basket.\n\n“Well, ‘pon my word! If ever I see! Here!” stepping out to the door,\n“Polly--Jenny! come in, I say, this moment! Come in, ye bad girls, or\nI’ll give you the stick; I’ll break every bone of you, that I will!” all\nwhich threats were bawled out in such a good-natured, triumphant voice,\nand with such a delighted air, that Richard and Ethel could not help\nlaughing.\n\nAfter a few moments, Polly and Jenny made their appearance, extremely\nrough and ragged, but compelled by their grandmother to duck down, by\nway of courtesies, and, with finger in mouth, they stood, too shy to\nshow their delight, as the garments were unfolded; Granny talking so\nfast that Ethel would never have brought in the stipulation, that the\nfrocks should be worn to school and church, if Richard, in his mild, but\nsteady way, had not brought the old woman to listen to it. She was full\nof asseverations that they should go; she took them to church sometimes\nherself, when it was fine weather and they had clothes, and they could\nsay their catechiz as well as anybody already; yes, they should come,\nthat they should, and next Sunday. Ethel promised to be there to\nintroduce them to the chief lady, the president of the Committee, Mrs.\nLedwich, and, with a profusion of thanks, they took leave.\n\nThey found John Taylor, just come out of the hospital, looking weak and\nill, as he smoked his pipe over the fire, his wife bustling about at\na great rate, and one of the infants crying. It seemed to be a great\nrelief that they were not come to complain of Lucy, and there were many\nlooks of surprise on hearing what their business really was. Mrs. Taylor\nthanked them, and appeared not to know whether she was glad or sorry;\nand her husband, pipe in hand, gazed at the young gentleman as if he\ndid not comprehend the species, since he could not be old enough to be a\nclergyman.\n\nRichard hoped they would find sponsors by that time; and there Mrs.\nTaylor gave little hope; it was a bad lot--there was no one she liked to\nask to stand, she said, in a dismal voice; but there her husband put in,\n“I’ll find some one if that’s all; my missus always thinks nobody can’t\ndo nothing.”\n\n“To be sure,” said the lamentable Mrs. Taylor, “all the elder ones was\ntook to church, and I’m loath the little ones shouldn’t; but you see,\nsir, we are poor people, and it’s a long way, and they was set down in\nthe gentleman’s register book.”\n\n“But you know that is not the same, Mrs. Taylor. Surely Lucy could have\ntold you that, when she went to school.”\n\n“No, sir, ‘tis not the same--I knows that; but this is a bad place to\nlive in--”\n\n“Always the old song, missus!” exclaimed her husband. “Thank you kindly,\nsir--you have been a good friend to us, and so was Dr. May, when I was\nup to the hospital, through the thick of his own troubles. I believe you\nare in the right of it, sir, and thank you. The children shall be ready,\nand little Jack too, and I’ll find gossips, and let ‘em christened on\nSunday.”\n\n“I believe you will be glad of it,” said Richard; and he went on to\nspeak of the elder children coming to school on Sunday, thus causing\nanother whining from the wife about distance and bad weather, and no\none else going that way. He said the little Halls were coming, but Mrs.\nTaylor begun saying she disliked their company for the children--granny\nlet them get about so much, and they said bad words. The father again\ninterfered. Perhaps Mr. Wilmot, who acted as chaplain at the hospital,\nhad been talking to him, for he declared at once that they should come;\nand Richard suggested that he might see them home when he came from\nchurch; then, turning to the boy and girl, told them they would meet\ntheir sister Lucy, and asked them if they would not like that.\n\nOn the whole, the beginning was not inauspicious, though there might be\na doubt whether old Mrs. Hall would keep all her promises. Ethel was so\nmuch diverted and pleased as to be convinced she would; Richard was a\nlittle doubtful as to her power over the wild girls. There could not be\nany doubt that John Taylor was in earnest, and had been worked upon just\nat the right moment; but there was danger that the impression would\nnot last. “And his wife is such a horrible whining dawdle!” said\nEthel--“there will be no good to be done if it depends on her.”\n\nRichard made no answer, and Ethel presently felt remorseful for her\nharsh speech about a poor ignorant woman, overwhelmed with poverty,\nchildren, and weak health.\n\n“I have been thinking a great deal about what you said last time we took\nthis walk,” said Richard, after a considerable interval.\n\n“Oh, have you!” cried Ethel eagerly; and the black peaty pond she was\nlooking at seemed to sparkle with sunlight.\n\n“Do you really mean it?” said Richard deliberately.\n\n“Yes, to be sure;” she said, with some indignation.\n\n“Because I think I see a way to make a beginning, but you must make\nup your mind to a great deal of trouble, and dirty walks, and you must\nreally learn not to draggle your frock.”\n\n“Well, well; but tell me.”\n\n“This is what I was thinking. I don’t think I can go back to Oxford\nafter Christmas. It is not fit to leave you while papa is so disabled.”\n\n“Oh no, he could not get on at all. I heard him tell Mr. Wilmot the\nother day that you were his right hand.”\n\nEthel was glad she had repeated this, for there was a deepening colour\nand smiling glow of pleasure on her brother’s face, such as she had\nseldom seen on his delicate, but somewhat impassive features.\n\n“He is very kind!” he said warmly. “No, I am sure I cannot be spared\ntill he is better able to use his arm, and I don’t see any chance\nof that just yet. Then if I stay at home, Friday is always at my own\ndisposal, while papa is at the hospital meeting.”\n\n“Yes, yes, and we could go to Cocksmoor, and set up a school. How\ndelightful!”\n\n“I don’t think you would find it quite so delightful as you fancy,” said\nRichard; “the children will be very wild and ignorant, and you don’t\nlike that at the National School.”\n\n“Oh, but they are in such need, besides there will be no Mrs. Ledwich\nover me. It is just right--I shan’t mind anything. You are a capital\nRitchie, for having thought of it!”\n\n“I don’t think--if I am ever to be what I wish, that is, if I can get\nthrough at Oxford--I don’t think it can be wrong to begin this, if Mr.\nRamsden does not object.”\n\n“Oh, Mr. Ramsden never objects to anything.”\n\n“And if Mr. Wilmot will come and set us off. You know we cannot begin\nwithout that, or without my father’s fully liking it.”\n\n“Oh! there can be no doubt of that!”\n\n“This one thing, Ethel, I must stipulate. Don’t you go and tell it all\nout at once to him. I cannot have him worried about our concerns.”\n\n“But how--no one can question that this is right. I am sure he won’t\nobject.”\n\n“Stop, Ethel, don’t you see, it can’t be done for nothing? If we\nundertake it, we must go on with it, and when I am away it will fall on\nyou and Flora. Well, then, it ought to be considered whether you are\nold enough and steady enough; and if it can be managed for you to go\ncontinually all this way, in this wild place. There will be expense\ntoo.”\n\nEthel looked wild with impatience, but could not gainsay these scruples,\notherwise than by declaring they ought not to weigh against the good of\nCocksmoor.\n\n“It will worry him to have to consider all this,” said Richard, “and it\nmust not be pressed upon him.”\n\n“No,” said Ethel sorrowfully; “but you don’t mean to give it up.”\n\n“You are always in extremes, Ethel. All I want is to find a good time\nfor proposing it.”\n\nShe fidgeted and gave a long sigh.\n\n“Mind,” said Richard, stopping short, “I’ll have nothing to do with it\nexcept on condition you are patient, and hold your tongue about it.”\n\n“I think I can, if I may talk to Margaret.”\n\n“Oh yes, to Margaret of course. We could not settle anything without her\nhelp.”\n\n“And I know what she will say,” said Ethel. “Oh, I am so glad,” and she\njumped over three puddles in succession.\n\n“And, Ethel, you must learn to keep your frock out of the dirt.”\n\n“I’ll do anything, if you’ll help me at Cocksmoor.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\n\n     For the structure that we raise,\n       Time is with materials filled;\n     Our to-days and yesterdays,\n       Are the blocks which we build.\n\n     Truly shape and fashion these,\n       Leave no yawning gaps between;\n     Think not, because no man sees,\n       Such things will remain unseen.--LONGFELLOW.\n\n\nWhen Ethel came home, burning with the tidings of the newly-excited\nhopes for Cocksmoor, they were at once stopped by Margaret eagerly\nsaying, “Is Richard come in? pray call him;” then on his entrance, “Oh,\nRichard, would you be so kind as to take this to the bank. I don’t like\nto send it by any one else--it is so much;” and she took from under her\npillows a velvet bag, so heavy, that it weighed down her slender white\nhand.\n\n“What, he has given you the care of his money?” said Ethel.\n\n“Yes; I saw him turning something out of his waistcoat-pocket into the\ndrawer of the looking-glass, and sighing in that very sad way. He said\nhis fees had come to such an accumulation that he must see about sending\nthem to the bank; and then he told me of the delight of throwing his\nfirst fee into dear mamma’s lap, when they were just married, and his\nold uncle had given up to him, and how he had brought them to her ever\nsince; he said she had spoiled him by taking all trouble off his hands.\nHe looked at it, as if it was so sorrowful to him to have to dispose\nof it, that I begged him not to plague himself any more, but let me see\nabout it, as dear mamma used to do; so he said I was spoiling him too,\nbut he brought me the drawer, and emptied it out here: when he was gone,\nI packed it up, and I have been waiting to ask Richard to take it all to\nthe bank, out of his sight.”\n\n“You counted it?” said Richard.\n\n“Yes--there’s fifty--I kept seventeen towards the week’s expenses. Just\nsee that it is right,” said Margaret, showing her neat packets.\n\n“Oh, Ritchie,” said Ethel, “what can expense signify, when all that has\nbeen kicking about loose in an open drawer? What would not one of those\nrolls do?”\n\n“I think I had better take them out of your way,” said Richard quietly.\n“Am I to bring back the book to you, Margaret?”\n\n“Yes, do,” said Margaret; “pray do not tease him with it.” And as her\nbrother left the room, she continued, “I wish he was better. I think he\nis more oppressed now than even at first. The pain of his arm, going on\nso long, seems to me to have pulled him down; it does not let him sleep,\nand, by the end of the day, he gets worn and fagged by seeing so many\npeople, and exerting himself to talk and think; and often, when there is\nsomething that must be asked, I don’t know how to begin, for it seems as\nif a little more would be too much for him.”\n\n“Yes, Richard is right,” said Ethel mournfully; “it will not do to press\nhim about our concerns; but do you think him worse to-day?”\n\n“He did not sleep last night, and he is always worse when he does not\ndrive out into the country; the fresh air, and being alone with Richard,\nare a rest for him. To-day is especially trying; he does not think poor\nold Mr. Southern will get through the evening, and he is so sorry for\nthe daughter.”\n\n“Is he there now?”\n\n“Yes; he thought of something that might be an alleviation, and he would\ngo, though he was tired. I am afraid the poor daughter will detain him,\nand he is not fit to go through such things now.”\n\n“No, I hope he will soon come; perhaps Richard will meet him. But, oh,\nMargaret, what do you think Richard and I have been talking of?” and,\nwithout perception of fit times and seasons, Ethel would have told her\nstory, but Margaret, too anxious to attend to her, said, “Hark! was not\nthat his step?” and Dr. May came in, looking mournful and fatigued.\n\n“Well,” said he, “I was just too late. He died as I got there, and I\ncould not leave the daughter till old Mrs. Bowers came.”\n\n“Poor thing,” said Margaret. “He was a good old man.”\n\n“Yes,” said Dr. May, sitting wearily down, and speaking in a worn-out\nvoice. “One can’t lightly part with a man one has seen at church every\nSunday of one’s life, and exchanged so many friendly words with over\nhis counter. ‘Tis a strong bond of neighbourliness in a small place like\nthis, and, as one grows old, changes come heavier--‘the clouds return\nagain after the rain.’ Thank you, my dear,” as Ethel fetched his\nslippers, and placed a stool for his feet, feeling somewhat ashamed of\nthinking it an achievement to have, unbidden, performed a small act of\nattention which would have come naturally from any of the others.\n\n“Papa, you will give me the treat of drinking tea with me?” said\nMargaret, who saw the quiet of her room would suit him better than the\nbustle of the children downstairs. “Thank you,” as he gave a smile of\nassent.\n\nThat Margaret could not be made to listen this evening was plain, and\nall that Ethel could do, was to search for some books on schools. In\nseeking for them, she displayed such confusion in the chiffonier, that\nFlora exclaimed, “Oh, Ethel, how could you leave it so?”\n\n“I was in a hurry, looking for something for Norman. I’ll set it to\nrights,” said Ethel, gulping down her dislike of being reproved by\nFlora, with the thought that mamma would have said the same.\n\n“My dear!” cried Flora presently, jumping up, “what are you doing?\npiling up those heavy books on the top of the little ones; how do you\nthink they will ever stand? let me do it.”\n\n“No, no, Flora;” and Richard, in a low voice, gave Ethel some advice,\nwhich she received, seated on the floor, in a mood between temper and\ndespair.\n\n“He is going to teach her to do it on the principles of gravitation,”\n said Flora.\n\nRichard did not do it himself, but, by his means, Ethel, without being\nin the least irritated, gave the chiffonier a thorough dusting and\nsetting-to-rights, sorting magazines, burning old catalogues, and\nfinding her own long-lost ‘Undine’, at which she was so delighted that\nshe would have forgotten all; in proceeding to read it, curled up on\nthe floor amongst the heaps of pamphlets, if another gentle hint from\nRichard had not made her finish her task so well, as to make Flora\ndeclare it was a pleasure to look in, and Harry pronounce it to be all\nneat and ship-shape.\n\nThere was no speaking to Margaret the next morning--it was French\nday--and Ethel had made strong resolutions to behave better; and whether\nthere were fewer idioms, or that she was trying to understand, instead\nof carping at the master’s explanations, they came to no battle; Flora\nled the conversation, and she sustained her part with credit, and gained\nan excellent mark.\n\nFlora said afterwards to Margaret, “I managed nicely for her. I would\nnot let M. Ballompre blunder upon any of the subjects Ethel feels too\ndeeply to talk of in good French, and really Ethel has a great talent\nfor languages. How fast she gets on with Italian!”\n\n“That she does,” said Margaret. “Suppose you send her up, Flora--you\nmust want to go and draw or practice, and she may do her arithmetic\nhere, or read to me.”\n\nIt was the second time Margaret had made this proposal, and it did not\nplease Flora, who had learned to think herself necessary to her sister,\nand liked to be the one to do everything for her. She was within six\nweeks of seventeen, and surely she need not be sent down again to the\nschool-room, when she had been so good a manager of the whole family.\nShe was fond of study and of accomplishments, but she thought she might\nbe emancipated from Miss Winter; and it was not pleasant to her that a\nsister, only eighteen months older, and almost dependant on her, should\nhave authority to dispose of her time.\n\n“I practise in the evening,” she said, “and I could draw here, if I\nwished, but I have some music to copy.”\n\nMargaret was concerned at the dissatisfaction, though not understanding\nthe whole of it: “You know, dear Flora,” she said, “I need not take up\nall your time now.”\n\n“Don’t regret that,” said Flora. “I like nothing so well as waiting on\nyou, and I can attend to my own affairs very well here.”\n\n“I’ll tell you why I proposed it,” said Margaret. “I think it would be a\nrelief for Ethel to escape from Miss Winter’s beloved Friday questions.”\n\n“Great nonsense they are,” said Flora. “Why don’t you tell Miss Winter\nthey are of no use?”\n\n“Mamma never interfered with them,” said Margaret. “She only kept Ethel\nin her own hands, and if you would be so kind as to change sometimes\nand sit in the school-room, we could spare Ethel, without hurting Miss\nWinter’s feelings.”\n\n“Well, I’ll call Ethel, if you like, but I shall go and practise in the\ndrawing-room. The old school-room piano is fit for nothing but Mary to\nhammer upon.”\n\nFlora went away, evidently annoyed, and Margaret’s conjectures on the\ncause of it were cut short by Ethel running in with a slate in one hand\nand two books in the other, the rest having all tumbled down on the\nstairs.\n\n“Oh, Margaret, I am so glad to come to you. Miss Winter has set Mary to\nread ‘To be, or not to be,’ and it would have driven me distracted\nto have stayed there. I have got a most beautiful sum in Compound\nProportion, about a lion, a wolf, and a bear eating up a carcase, and as\nsoon as they have done it, you shall hear me say my ancient geography,\nand then we will do a nice bit of Tasso; and if we have any time after\nthat, I have got such a thing to tell you--only I must not tell you now,\nor I shall go on talking and not finish my lessons.”\n\nIt was not till all were done, that Ethel felt free to exclaim, “Now\nfor what I have been longing to tell you--Richard is going to--” But the\nfates were unpropitious. Aubrey trotted in, expecting to be amused; next\ncame Norman, and Ethel gave up in despair; and, after having affronted\nFlora in the morning, Margaret was afraid of renewing the offence, by\nattempting to secure Ethel as her companion for the afternoon; so not\ntill after the walk could Margaret contrive to claim the promised\ncommunication, telling Ethel to come and settle herself cosily by her.\n\n“I should have been very glad of you last evening,” said she, “for papa\nwent to sleep, and my book was out of reach.”\n\n“Oh, I am sorry; how I pity you, poor Margaret!”\n\n“I suppose I have grown lazy,” said Margaret, “for I don’t mind\nthose things now. I am never sorry for a quiet time to recollect and\nconsider.”\n\n“It must be like the waiting in the dark between the slides of a magic\nlantern,” said Ethel; “I never like to be quiet. I get so unhappy.”\n\n“I am glad of resting and recollecting,” said Margaret. “It has all been\nso like a dream, that merry morning, and then, slowly waking to find\nmyself here in dear mamma’s place, and papa watching over me. Sometimes\nI think I have not half understood what it really is, and that I don’t\nrealise, that if I was up and about, I should find the house without\nher.”\n\n“Yes; that is the aching part!” said Ethel. “I am happy, sitting on her\nbed here with you. You are a little of her, besides being my own dear\nPeg-top! You are very lucky to miss the mealtimes and the evenings.”\n\n“That is the reason I don’t feel it wrong to like to have papa sitting\nwith me all the evening,” said Margaret, “though it may make it worse\nfor you to have him away. I don’t think it selfish in me to keep him. He\nwants quiet so much, or to talk a little when it suits him; we are too\nmany now, when he is tired.”\n\n“Oh, it is best,” said Ethel. “Nothing that you do is selfish--don’t\ntalk of it, dear Margaret. It will be something like old times when you\ncome down again.”\n\n“But all this time you are not telling me what I want so much to hear,”\n said Margaret, “about Cocksmoor. I am so glad Richard has taken it up.”\n\n“That he has. We are to go every Friday, and hire a room, and teach the\nchildren. Once a week will do a great deal, if we can but make them wish\nto learn. It is a much better plan than mine; for if they care about it,\nthey can come to school here on Sunday.”\n\n“It is excellent,” said Margaret, “and if he is at home till Easter, it\nwill give it a start, and put you in the way of it, and get you through\nthe short days and dark evenings, when you could not so well walk home\nwithout him.”\n\n“Yes, and then we can all teach; Flora, and Mary, and you, when you\nare well again. Richard says it will be disagreeable, but I don’t think\nso--they are such unsophisticated people. That Granny Hall is such a\nfunny old woman; and the whole place wants nothing but a little care, to\ndo very well.”\n\n“You must prepare for disappointments, dear Ethel.”\n\n“I know; I know nothing is done without drawbacks; but I am so glad to\nmake some beginning.”\n\n“So am I. Do you know, mamma and I were one day talking over those kind\nof things, and she said she had always regretted that she had so many\nduties at home, that she could not attend as much to the poor as she\nwould like; but she hoped now we girls were growing up, we should be\nable to do more.\n\n“Did she?” was all Ethel said, but she was deeply gratified.\n\n“I’ve been wanting to tell you. I knew you would like to hear it. It\nseems to set us to work so happily.”\n\n“I only wish we could begin,” said Ethel, “but Richard is so slow! Of\ncourse we can’t act without papa’s consent and Mr. Wilmot’s help, and he\nsays papa must not be worried about it, he must watch for his own time\nto speak about it.”\n\n“Yes” said Margaret.\n\n“I know--I would not have it otherwise; but what is tiresome is this.\nRichard is very good, but he is so dreadfully hard to stir up, and\nwhat’s worse, so very much afraid of papa, that while he is thinking\nabout opportunities, they will all go by, and then it will be Easter,\nand nothing done!”\n\n“He is not so much afraid of papa as he was,” said Margaret. “He has\nfelt himself useful and a comfort, and papa is gentler; and that has\ncheered him out of the desponding way that kept him back from proposing\nanything.”\n\n“Perhaps,” said Ethel; “but I wish it was you. Can’t you? you always\nknow how to manage.”\n\n“No; it is Richard’s affair, and he must do as he thinks fit. Don’t\nsigh, dear Ethel--perhaps he may soon speak, and, if not, you can be\npreparing in a quiet way all the time. Don’t you remember how dear mamma\nused to tell us that things, hastily begun, never turn out well?”\n\n“But this is not hasty. I’ve been thinking about it these six weeks,”\n said Ethel. “If one does nothing but think, it is all no better than a\nvision. I want to be doing.”\n\n“Well, you can be doing--laying a sound foundation,” said Margaret. “The\nmore you consider, and the wiser you make yourself, the better it will\nbe when you do set to work.”\n\n“You mean by curing myself of my slovenly ways and impatient temper?”\n\n“I don’t know that I was exactly thinking of that,” said Margaret, “but\nthat ought to be the way. If we are not just the thing in our niche at\nhome, I don’t think we can do much real good elsewhere.”\n\n“It would be hollow, show-goodness,” said Ethel. “Yes, that is true;\nand it comes across me now, and then what a horrid wretch I am, to be\nwanting to undertake so much, when I leave so much undone. But, do you\nknow, Margaret, there’s no one such a help in those ways as Richard.\nThough he is so precise, he is never tiresome. He makes me see things,\nand do them neatly, without plaguing me, and putting me in a rage. I’m\nnot ready to bite off my own fingers, or kick all the rattle-traps over\nand leave them, as I am when Miss Winter scolds me, or nurse, or even\nFlora sometimes; but it is as if I was gratifying him, and his funny\nlittle old bachelor tidyisms divert me; besides, he teaches me the\ntheory, and never lays hold of my poor fingers, and, when they won’t\nbend the wrong way, calls them frogs.”\n\n“He is a capital master for you,” said Margaret, much amused and\npleased, for Richard was her especial darling, and she triumphed in any\neulogy from those who ordinarily were too apt to regard his dullness\nwith superior compassion.\n\n“If he would only read our books, and enter into poetry and delight\nin it; but it is all nonsense to him,” said Ethel. “I can’t think how\npeople can be so different; but, oh! here he comes. Ritchie, you should\nnot come upon us before we are aware.”\n\n“What? I should have heard no good of myself?”\n\n“Great good,” said Margaret--“she was telling me you would make a\nneat-handed woman of her in time.”\n\n“I don’t see why she should not be as neat as other people,” said\nRichard gravely. “Has she been telling you our plan?”\n\nAnd it was again happily discussed; Ethel, satisfied by finding him\nfully set upon the design, and Margaret giving cordial sympathy and\ncounsel. When Ethel was called away, Margaret said, “I am so glad you\nhave taken it up, not only for the sake of Cocksmoor, but of Ethel. It\nis good for her not to spend her high soul in dreams.”\n\n“I am afraid she does not know what she undertakes,” said Richard.\n\n“She does not; but you will keep her from being turned back. It is just\nthe thing to prevent her energies from running to waste, and her being\nso much with you, and working under you, is exactly what one would have\nchosen.”\n\n“By contraries!” said Richard, smiling. “That is what I was afraid of. I\ndon’t half understand or follow her, and when I think a thing nonsense,\nI see you all calling it very fine, and I don’t know what to make of\nit--”\n\n“You are making yourself out more dull than you are,” said Margaret\naffectionately.\n\n“I know I am stupid, and seem tame and cold,” said Richard, “and you\nare the only one that does not care about it. That is what makes me wish\nNorman was the eldest. If I were as clever as he, I could do so much\nwith Ethel, and be so much more to papa.”\n\n“No, you would not. You would have other things in your head. You would\nnot be the dear, dear old Ritchie that you are. You would not be a calm,\ncautious, steady balance to the quicksilver heads some of us have got.\nNo, no, Norman’s a very fine fellow, a very dear fellow, but he would\nnot do half so well for our eldest--he is too easily up, and down\nagain.”\n\n“And I am getting into my old way of repining,” said Richard. “I don’t\nmind so much, since my father has at least one son to be proud of, and I\ncan be of some use to him now.”\n\n“Of the greatest, and to all of us. I am so glad you can stay after\nChristmas, and papa was pleased at your offering, and said he could not\nspare you at all, though he would have tried, if it had been any real\nadvantage to you.”\n\n“Well, I hope he will approve. I must speak to him as soon as I can find\nhim with his mind tolerably disengaged.”\n\nThe scene that ensued that evening in the magic lantern before\nMargaret’s bed, did not promise much for the freedom of her father’s\nmind. Harry entered with a resolute manner. “Margaret, I wanted to speak\nto you,” said he, spreading himself out, with an elbow on each arm of\nthe chair. “I want you to speak to papa about my going to sea. It is\nhigh time to see about it--I shall be thirteen on the fourth of May.”\n\n“And you mean it seriously, Harry?”\n\n“Yes, of course I do, really and truly; and if it is to come to pass, it\nis time to take measures. Don’t you see, Margaret?”\n\n“It is time, as you say,” answered Margaret reflectingly, and sadly\nsurveying the bright boy, rosy cheeked, round faced, and blue eyed, with\nthe childish gladsomeness of countenance, that made it strange that his\nlot in life should be already in the balance.\n\n“I know what you will all tell me, that it is a hard life, but I must\nget my own living some way or other, and I should like that way the\nbest,” said he earnestly.\n\n“Should you like to be always far from home?”\n\n“I should come home sometimes, and bring such presents to Mary, and\nbaby, and all of you; and I don’t know what else to be, Margaret. I\nshould hate to be a doctor--I can’t abide sick people; and I couldn’t\nwrite sermons, so I can’t be a clergyman; and I won’t be a lawyer, I\nvow, for Harvey Anderson is to be a lawyer--so there’s nothing left but\nsoldiers and sailors, and I mean to be a sailor!”\n\n“Well, Harry, you may do your duty, and try to do right, if you are a\nsailor, and that is the point.”\n\n“Ay, I was sure you would not set your face against it, now you know\nAlan Ernescliffe.”\n\n“If you were to be like him--” Margaret found herself blushing, and\nbroke off.\n\n“Then you will ask papa about it?”\n\n“You had better do so yourself. Boys had better settle such serious\naffairs with their fathers, without setting their sisters to interfere.\nWhat’s the matter, Harry--you are not afraid to speak to papa?”\n\n“Only for one thing,” said Harry. “Margaret, I went out to shoot\npee-wits last Saturday with two fellows, and I can’t speak to papa while\nthat’s on my mind.”\n\n“Then you had better tell him at once.”\n\n“I knew you would say so; but it would be like a girl, and it would be\ntelling of the two fellows.”\n\n“Not at all; papa would not care about them.”\n\n“You see,” said Harry, twisting a little, “I knew I ought not; but they\nsaid I was afraid of a gun, and that I had no money. Now I see that was\nchaff, but I didn’t then, and Norman wasn’t there.”\n\n“I am so glad you have told me all this, Harry dear, for I knew you had\nbeen less at home of late, and I was almost afraid you were not going on\nquite well.”\n\n“That’s what it is,” said Harry. “I can’t stand things at all, and I\ncan’t go moping about as Norman does. I can’t live without fun, and now\nNorman isn’t here, half the time it turns to something I am sorry for\nafterwards.”\n\n“But, Harry, if you let yourself be drawn into mischief here for want of\nNorman, what would you do at sea?”\n\n“I should be an officer!”\n\n“I am afraid,” said Margaret, smiling, “that would not make much\ndifference inside, though it might outside. You must get the\nself-control, and leave off being afraid to be said to be afraid.”\n\nHarry fidgeted. “I should start fresh, and be out of the way of the\nAndersons,” he said. “That Anderson junior is a horrid fellow--he spites\nNorman, and he bullied me, till I was big enough to show him that it\nwould not do--and though I am so much younger, he is afraid of me.\nHe makes up to me, and tries to get me into all the mischief that is\ngoing.”\n\n“And you know that, and let him lead you? Oh, Harry!”\n\n“I don’t let him lead me,” said Harry indignantly, “but I won’t have\nthem say I can’t do things.”\n\nMargaret laughed, and Harry presently perceived what she meant, but\ninstead of answering, he began to boast, “There never was a May in\ndisgrace yet, and there never shall be.”\n\n“That is a thing to be very thankful for,” said Margaret, “but you know\nthere may be much harm without public disgrace. I never heard of one of\nthe Andersons being in disgrace yet.”\n\n“No--shabby fellows, that just manage to keep fair with old Hoxton, and\nmake a show,” said Harry. “They look at translations, and copy old stock\nverses. Oh, it was such fun the other day. What do you think? Norman\nmust have been dreaming, for he had taken to school, by mistake,\nRichard’s old Gradus that Ethel uses, and there were ever so many rough\ncopies of hers sticking in it.”\n\n“Poor Ethel! What consternation she would be in! I hope no one found it\nout.”\n\n“Why, Anderson junior was gaping about in despair for sense for his\nverses--he comes on that, and slyly copies a whole set of her old ones,\ndone when she--Norman, I mean--was in the fifth form. His subject was\na river, and hers Babylon; but, altering a line or two, it did just as\nwell. He never guessed I saw him, and thought he had done it famously.\nHe showed them up, and would have got some noted good mark, but that, by\ngreat good luck, Ethel had made two of her pentameters too short, which\nhe hadn’t the wit to find out, thinking all Norman did must be right. So\nhe has shown up a girl’s verses--isn’t that rare?” cried Harry, dancing\non his chair with triumph.\n\n“I hope no one knows they were hers?”\n\n“Bless you, no!” said Harry, who regarded Ethel’s attainments as\nsomething contraband. “D’ye think I could tell? No, that’s the only\npity, that he can’t hear it; but, after all, I don’t care for anything\nhe does, now I know he has shown up a girl’s verses.”\n\n“Are these verses of poor Ethel’s safe at home?”\n\n“Yes, I took care of that. Mind you don’t tell anyone, Margaret; I never\ntold even Norman.”\n\n“But all your school-fellows aren’t like these? You have Hector\nErnescliffe.”\n\n“He’s a nice fellow enough, but he is little, and down in the school.\n‘Twould be making a fourth form of myself to be after him. The fact is,\nMargaret, they are a low, ungentlemanly lot just now, about sixth\nand upper fifth form,” said Harry, lowering his voice into an anxious\nconfidential tone; “and since Norman has been less amongst them, they’ve\ngot worse; and you see, now home is different, and he isn’t like what he\nwas, I’m thrown on them, and I want to get out of it. I didn’t know that\nwas it before, but Richard showed me what set me on thinking of it, and\nI see she knew all about it.”\n\n“That she did! There is a great deal in what you say, Harry, but you\nknow she thought nothing would be of real use but changing within.\nIf you don’t get a root of strength in yourself, your ship will be no\nbetter to you than school--there will be idle midshipmen as well as idle\nschool-boys.”\n\n“Yes, I know,” said Harry; “but do you think papa will consent? She\nwould not have minded.”\n\n“I can’t tell. I should think he would; but if any scheme is to come to\ngood, it must begin by your telling him of the going out shooting.”\n\nHarry sighed. “I’d have done it long ago if she was here,” he said. “I\nnever did anything so bad before without telling, and I don’t like it at\nall. It seems to come between him and me when I wish him good-night.”\n\n“Then, Harry, pray do tell him. You’ll have no comfort if you don’t.”\n\n“I know I shan’t; but then he’ll be so angry! And, do you know,\nMargaret, ‘twas worse than I told you, for a covey of partridges got up,\nand unluckily I had got the gun, and I fired and killed one, and that\nwas regular poaching, you know! And when we heard some one coming, how\nwe did cut! Ax--the other fellow, I mean, got it, and cooked it in his\nbedroom, and ate it for supper; and he laughs about it, but I have felt\nso horrid all the week! Suppose a keeper had got a summons!”\n\n“I can only say again, the only peace will be in telling.”\n\n“Yes; but he will be so angry. When that lot of fellows a year or two\nago did something like it, and shot some of the Abbotstoke rabbits,\ndon’t you remember how much he said about its being disgraceful, and\nordering us never to have anything to do with their gunnery? And he will\nthink it so very bad to have gone out on a lark just now! Oh, I wish I\nhadn’t done it.”\n\n“So do I, indeed, Harry! but I am sure, even it he should be angry at\nfirst, he will be pleased with your confessing.”\n\nHarry looked very reluctant and disconsolate, and his sister did\nnot wonder for Dr. May’s way of hearing of a fault was never to be\ncalculated on. “Come, Harry,” said she, “if he is ever so angry, though\nI don’t think he will be, do you think that will be half as bad as this\nload at your heart? Besides, if you are not bold enough to speak to him,\ndo you think you can ever be brave enough for a sailor?”\n\n“I will,” said Harry, and the words were hardly spoken, before his\nfather’s hand was on the door. He was taken by surprise at the moment\nof trial coming so speedily, and had half a mind to retreat by the other\ndoor; he was stayed by the reflection that Margaret would think him a\ncoward, unfit for a sailor, and he made up his mind to endure whatever\nmight betide.\n\n“Harry here? This is company I did not expect.”\n\n“Harry has something to say to you, papa.”\n\n“Eh! my boy, what is it?” said he kindly.\n\n“Papa, I have killed a partridge. Two fellows got me to hire a gun, and\ngo out shooting with them last Saturday,” said Harry, speaking firmly\nand boldly now he had once begun. “We meant only to go after pee-wits,\nbut a partridge got up, and I killed it.”\n\nThen came a pause. Harry stopped, and Dr. May waited, half expecting to\nhear that the boy was only brought to confession by finding himself in\na scrape. Margaret spoke. “And he could not be happy till he had told\nyou.”\n\n“Is it so? Is that the whole?” said the doctor, looking at his son with\na keen glance, between affection and inquiry, as if only waiting to be\nsure the confession was free, before he gave his free forgiveness.\n\n“Yes, papa,” said Harry, his voice and lip losing their firmness, as the\nsweetness of expression gained the day on his father’s face. “Only that\nI know--‘twas very wrong--especially now--and I am very sorry--and I beg\nyour pardon.”\n\nThe latter words came between sighs, fast becoming sobs, in spite of\nHarry’s attempts to control them, as his father held out his arm, and\ndrew him close to him.\n\n“That’s mamma’s own brave boy,” he said in his ear--in a voice which\nstrong feeling had reduced to such a whisper, that even Margaret could\nnot hear--she only saw how Harry, sobbing aloud, clung tighter and\ntighter to him, till he said “Take care of my arm!” and Harry sprang\nback at least a yard, with such a look of dismay, that the doctor\nlaughed. “No harm done!” said he. “I was only a little in dread of such\na young lion! Comeback, Harry,” and he took his hand. “It was a bad\npiece of work, and it will never do for you to let yourself be drawn\ninto every bit of mischief that is on foot; I believe I ought to\ngive you a good lecture on it, but I can’t do it, after such a\nstraightforward confession. You must have gone through enough in the\nlast week, not to be likely to do it again.”\n\n“Yes, papa--thank you.”\n\n“I suppose I must not ask you any questions about it, for fear of\nbetraying the fellows,” said Dr. May, half smiling.\n\n“Thank you, papa,” said Harry, infinitely relieved and grateful, and\nquite content for some space to lean in silence against the chair, with\nthat encircling arm round him, while some talk passed between his father\nand Margaret.\n\nWhat a world of thought passed through the boy’s young soul in that\nspace! First, there was a thrill of intense, burning love to his father,\nscarcely less fondness to his sweet motherly sister; a clinging feeling\nto every chair and table of that room, which seemed still full of\nhis mother’s presence; a numbering over of all the others with ardent\nattachment, and a flinging from him with horror the notion of asking to\nbe far away from that dearest father, that loving home, that arm that\nwas round him. Anything rather than be without them in the dreary\nworld! But then came the remembrance of cherished visions, the shame of\nrelinquishing a settled purpose, the thought of weary morrows, with the\ntempters among his playmates, and his home blank and melancholy; and\nthe roaming spirit of enterprise stirred again, and reproached him with\nbeing a baby, for fancying he could stay at home for ever. He would come\nback again with such honours as Alan Ernescliffe had brought, and oh!\nif his father so prized them in a stranger, what would it be in his\nown son? Come home to such a greeting as would make up for the parting!\nHarry’s heart throbbed again for the boundless sea, the tall ship,\nand the wondrous foreign climes, where he had so often lived in fancy.\nShould he, could he speak: was this the moment? and he stood gazing at\nthe fire, oppressed with the weighty reality of deciding his destiny.\nAt last Dr. May looked in his face, “Well, what now, boy? You have your\nhead full of something--what’s coming next?”\n\nOut it came, “Papa will you let me be a sailor?”\n\n“Oh!” said Dr. May, “that is come on again, is it? I thought that you\nhad forgotten all that.”\n\n“No, papa,” said Harry, with the manly coolness that the sense of his\ndetermination gave him--“it was not a mere fancy, and I have never had\nit out of my head. I mean it quite in earnest--I had rather be a sailor.\nI don’t wish to get away from Latin and Greek, I don’t mind them; but\nI think I could be a better sailor than anything. I know it is not all\nplay, but I am willing to rough it; and I am getting so old, it is time\nto see about it, so will you consent to it, papa?”\n\n“Well! there’s some sense in your way of putting it,” said Dr. May. “You\nhave it strong in your head then, and you know ‘tis not all fair-weather\nwork!”\n\n“That I do; Alan told me histories, and I’ve read all about it; but one\nmust rough it anywhere, and if I am ever so far away, I’ll try not to\nforget what’s right. I’ll do my duty, and not care for danger.”\n\n“Well said, my man; but remember ‘tis easier talking by one’s own\nfireside than doing when the trial comes.”\n\n“And will you let me, papa?”\n\n“I’ll think about it. I can’t make up my mind as ‘quick as directly,’\nyou know, Harry,” said his father, smiling kindly, “but I won’t treat\nit as a boy’s fancy, for you’ve spoken in a manly way, and deserve to\nbe attended to. Now run down, and tell the girls to put away their work,\nfor I shall come down in a minute to read prayers.”\n\nHarry went, and his father sighed and mused! “That’s a fine fellow! So\nthis is what comes of bringing sick sailors home--one’s own boys must be\ncatching the infection. Little monkey, he talks as wisely as if he were\nforty! He is really set on it, do you think, Margaret? I’m afraid so!”\n\n“I think so,” said Margaret; “I don’t think he ever has it out of his\nmind!”\n\n“And when the roving spirit once lays hold of a lad, he must have his\nway--he is good for nothing else,” said Dr. May.\n\n“I suppose a man may keep from evil in that profession as well as in any\nother,” said Margaret.\n\n“Aha! you are bit too, are you?” said the doctor; “‘tis the husbandman\nand viper, is it?” Then his smile turned into a heavy sigh, as he saw\nhe had brought colour to Margaret’s pale cheek, but she answered calmly,\n“Dear mamma did not think it would be a bad thing for him.”\n\n“I know,” said the doctor, pausing; “but it never came to this with\nher.”\n\n“I wish he had chosen something else; but--” and Margaret thought it\nright to lay before her father some part of what he had said of the\ntemptations of the school at Stoneborough. The doctor listened and\nconsidered at last he rose, and said, “Well, I’ll set Ritchie to write\nto Ernescliffe, and hear what he says. What must be, must be. ‘Tis only\nasking me to give up the boy, that’s all;” and as he left the room,\nhis daughter again heard his sigh and half-uttered words, “Oh, Maggie,\nMaggie!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\n\n                                   A tale\n     Would rouse adventurous courage in a boy,\n     And make him long to be a mariner,\n     That he might rove the main.--SOUTHEY.\n\n\nEtheldred had the satisfaction of seeing the Taylors at school on\nSunday, but no Halls made their appearance, and, on inquiry, she was\ntold, “Please ma’am, they said they would not come;” so Ethel condemned\nGranny Hall as “a horrid, vile, false, hypocritical old creature! It was\nno use having anything more to do with her.”\n\n“Very well,” said Richard; “then I need not speak to my father.”\n\n“Ritchie now! you know I meant no such thing!”\n\n“You know, it is just what will happen continually.”\n\n“Of course there will be failures, but this is so abominable, when they\nhad those nice frocks, and those two beautiful eighteen-penny shawls!\nThere are three shillings out of my pound thrown away!”\n\n“Perhaps there was some reason to prevent them. We will go and see.”\n\n“We shall only hear some more palavering. I want to have no more to say\nto--” but here Ethel caught herself up, and began to perceive what\na happiness it was that she had not the power of acting on her own\nimpulses.\n\nThe twins and their little brother of two years old were christened\nin the afternoon, and Flora invited the parents to drink tea in the\nkitchen, and visit Lucy, while Ethel and Mary each carried a baby\nupstairs to exhibit to Margaret.\n\nRichard, in the meantime, had a conversation with John Taylor, and\nlearned a good deal about the district, and the number of the people. At\ntea, he began to rehearse his information, and the doctor listened with\ninterest, which put Ethel in happy agitation, believing that the moment\nwas come, and Richard seemed to be only waiting for the conclusion of a\nlong tirade against those who ought to do something for the place, when\nbehold! Blanche was climbing on her father’s knee, begging for one of\nhis Sunday stories.\n\nEtheldred was cruelly disappointed, and could not at first rejoice to\nsee her father able again to occupy himself with his little girl. The\nnarration, in his low tones, roused her from her mood of vexation.\nIt was the story of David, which he told in language scriptural and\npoetical, so pretty and tender in its simplicity, that she could not\nchoose but attend. Ever and anon there was a glance towards Harry, as\nif he were secretly likening his own “yellow-haired laddie” to the\n“shepherd boy, ruddy, and of a fair countenance.”\n\n“So Tom and Blanche,” he concluded, “can you tell me how we may be like\nthe shepherd-boy, David?”\n\n“There aren’t giants now,” said Tom.\n\n“Wrong is a giant,” said his little sister.\n\n“Right, my white May-flower, and what then?”\n\n“We are to fight,” said Tom.\n\n“Yes, and mind, the giant with all his armour may be some great thing we\nhave to do: but what did David begin with when he was younger?”\n\n“The lion and the bear.”\n\n“Ay, and minding his sheep. Perhaps little things, now you are little\nchildren, may be like the lion and the bear--so kill them off--get rid\nof them--cure yourself of whining or dawdling, or whatever it be,\nand mind your sheep well,” said he, smiling sweetly in answer to the\nchildren’s earnest looks as they caught his meaning, “and if you do,\nyou will not find it near so hard to deal with your great giant struggle\nwhen it comes.”\n\nAh! thought Ethel, it suits me as well as the children. I have a great\ngiant on Cocksmoor, and here I am, not allowed to attack him, because,\nperhaps, I am not minding my sheep, and letting my lion and my bear run\nloose about the house.\n\nShe was less impatient this week, partly from the sense of being on\nprobation, and partly because she, in common with all the rest, was much\nengrossed with Harry’s fate. He came home every day at dinner-time with\nNorman to ask if Alan Ernescliffe’s letter had come; and at length Mary\nand Tom met them open-mouthed with the news that Margaret had it in her\nroom.\n\nThither they hastened. Margaret held it out with a smile of\ncongratulation. “Here it is, Harry; papa said you were to have it, and\nconsider it well, and let him know, when you had taken time. You must do\nit soberly. It is once for all.”\n\nHarry’s impetuosity was checked, and he took the letter quietly. His\nsister put her hand on his shoulder, “Would you mind my kissing you,\ndear Harry?” and as he threw his arms round her neck, she whispered,\n“Pray that you may choose right.”\n\nHe went quietly away, and Norman begged to know what had been Alan\nErnescliffe’s advice.\n\n“I can scarcely say he gave any direct advice,” said Margaret; “He would\nnot have thought that called for. He said, no doubt there were hardships\nand temptations, more or less, according to circumstances; but weighing\none thing with another, he thought it gave as fair a chance of happiness\nas other professions, and the discipline and regularity had been very\ngood for himself, as well as for many others he had known. He said, when\na man is willing to go wrong there is much to help him, but when he is\nresolved on doing right, he need not be prevented.”\n\n“That is what you may say of anything,” said Norman.\n\n“Just so; and it answered papa’s question, whether it was exposing Harry\nto more temptation than he must meet with anywhere. That was the reason\nit was such a comfort to have anyone to write to, who understands it so\nwell.”\n\n“Yes, and knows Harry’s nature.”\n\n“He said he had been fortunate in his captains, and had led, on the\nwhole, a happy life at sea; and he thought if it was so with him, Harry\nwas likely to enjoy it more, being of a hardy adventurous nature, and a\nsailor from choice, not from circumstances.”\n\n“Then he advised for it? I did not think he would; you know he will not\nlet Hector be a sailor.”\n\n“He told me he thought only a strong natural bent that way made it\ndesirable, and that he believed Hector only wished it from imitation of\nhim. He said too, long ago, that he thought Harry cut out for a sailor.\n\n“A spirited fellow!” said Norman, with a look of saddened pride and\napproval, not at all like one so near the same age. “He is up to\nanything, afraid of nothing, he can lick any boy in the school already.\nIt will be worse than ever without him!”\n\n“Yes, you will miss your constant follower. He has been your shadow\never since he could walk. But there’s the clock, I must not keep you any\nlonger; good-bye, Norman.”\n\nHarry gave his brother the letter as soon as they were outside the\nhouse, and, while he read it, took his arm and guided him. “Well,” said\nNorman as he finished.\n\n“It is all right,” said Harry; and the two brothers said no more; there\nwas something rising up in their throats at the thought that they had\nvery few more walks to take together to Bishop Whichcote’s school;\nNorman’s heart was very full at the prospect of another vacancy in his\nhome, and Harry’s was swelling between the ardour of enterprise and the\nthought of bidding good-bye to each familiar object, and, above all, to\nthe brother who had been his model and admiration from babyhood.\n\n“June!” at length he broke out, “I wish you were going too. I should not\nmind it half so much if you were.”\n\n“Nonsense, Harry! you want to be July after June all your life, do you?\nYou’ll be much more of a man without me.”\n\nThat evening Dr. May called Harry into his study to ask him if his mind\nwas made up; he put the subject fairly before him, and told him not to\nbe deterred from choosing what he thought would be for the best by any\nscruples about changing his mind. “We shall not think a bit the worse of\nyou; better now, than too late.”\n\nThere was that in his face and tone that caused Harry to say, in a\nstifled voice, “I did not think you would care so much, papa; I won’t\ngo, if you do.”\n\nDr. May put his hand on his shoulder, and was silent. Harry felt a\nstrange mixture of hope and fear, joy and grief, disappointment and\nrelief. “You must not give it up on that account, my dear,” he said at\nlength; “I should not let you see this, if it did not happen at a time\nwhen I can’t command myself as I ought. If you were an only son, it\nmight be your duty to stay; being one of many, ‘tis nonsense to make a\nrout about parting with you. If it is better for you, it is better for\nall of us; and we shall do very well when you are once fairly gone.\nDon’t let that influence you for a moment.”\n\nHarry paused, not that he doubted, but he was collecting his\nenergies--“Then, papa, I choose the navy.”\n\n“Then it is done, Harry. You have chosen in a dutiful, unselfish spirit,\nand I trust it will prosper with you; for I am sure your father’s\nblessing--aye, and your mother’s too, go with you! Now then,” after a\npause, “go and call Richard. I want him to write to Ernescliffe about\nthat naval school. You must take your leave of the Whichcote foundation\non Friday. I shall go and give Dr. Hoxton notice tomorrow, and get Tom’s\nname down instead.”\n\nAnd when the name of Thomas May was set down, Dr. Hoxton expressed his\ntrust that it would pass through the school as free from the slightest\nblemish as those of Richard, Norman, and Harry May.\n\nNow that Harry’s destiny was fixed, Ethel began to think of Cocksmoor\nagain, and she accomplished another walk there with Richard, Flora, and\nMary, to question Granny Hall about the children’s failure.\n\nThe old woman’s reply was a tissue of contradictions: the girls were\nidle hussies, all contrary: they plagued the very life out of her, and\nshe represented herself as using the most frightful threats, if they\nwould not go to school. Breaking every bone in their skin was the least\ninjury she promised them; till Mary, beginning to think her a cruel old\nwoman, took hold of her brother’s coat-tails for protection.\n\n“But I am afraid, Mrs. Hall,” said Richard, in that tone which might be\neither ironical or simple, “if you served them so, they would never be\nable to get to school at all, poor things.”\n\n“Bless you, sir, d’ye think I’d ever lay a finger near them; it’s only\nthe way one must talk to children, you see,” said she, patronising his\ninexperience.\n\n“Perhaps they have found that out,” said Richard. Granny looked much\nentertained, and laughed triumphantly and shrewdly, “ay, ay, that they\nhave, the lasses--they be sharp enough for anything, that they be. Why,\nwhen I tell little Jenny that there’s the black man coming after her,\nwhat does she do but she ups and says, ‘Granny, I know ‘tis only the\nwind in the chimney.’”\n\n“Then I don’t think it seems to answer,” said Richard. “Just suppose you\nwere to try for once, really punishing them when they won’t obey you,\nperhaps they would do it next time.”\n\n“Why, sir, you see I don’t like to take the stick to them; they’ve got\nno mother, you see, sir.”\n\nMary thought her a kind grandmother, and came out from behind her\nbrother.\n\n“I think it would be kinder to do it for once. What do you think they\nwill do as they grow older, if you don’t keep them in order when they\nare little?”\n\nThis was foresight beyond Granny Hall, who began to expatiate on the\ntroubles she had undergone in their service, and the excellence of Sam.\nThere was certainly a charm in her manners, for Ethel forgot her charge\nof ingratitude, the other sisters were perfectly taken with her, nor\ncould they any of them help giving credence to her asseverations that\nJenny and Polly should come to school next Sunday.\n\nThey soon formed another acquaintance; a sharp-faced woman stood in\ntheir path, with a little girl in her hand, and arrested them with a low\ncurtsey, and not a very pleasant voice, addressing herself to Flora,\nwho was quite as tall as Richard, and appeared the person of most\nconsequence.\n\n“If you please, miss, I wanted to speak to you. I have got a little girl\nhere, and I want to send her to school, only I have no shoes for her.”\n\n“Why, surely, if she can run about here on the heath, she can go to\nschool,” said Flora.\n\n“Oh! but there is all the other children to point at her. The poor thing\nwould be daunted, you see, miss; if I could but get some friend to give\nher a pair of shoes, I’d send her in a minute. I want her to get some\nlearning; as I am always saying, I’d never keep her away, if I had\nbut got the clothes to send her in. I never lets her be running on the\ncommon, like them Halls, as it’s a shame to see them in nice frocks, as\nMrs. Hall got by going hypercriting about.”\n\n“What is your name?” said Richard, cutting her short.\n\n“Watts, if you please, sir; we heard there was good work up here, sir,\nand so we came; but I’d never have set foot in it if I had known what a\ndark heathenish place it is, with never a Gospel minister to come near\nit,” and a great deal more to the same purpose.\n\nMary whispered to Flora something about having outgrown her boots, but\nFlora silenced her by a squeeze of the hand, and the two friends of\nCocksmoor felt a good deal puzzled.\n\nAt last Flora said, “You will soon get her clothed if she comes\nregularly to school on Sundays, for she will be admitted into the club;\nI will recommend her if she has a good character and comes regularly.\nGood-morning, Mrs. Watts. Now we must go, or it will be dark before we\nget home.” And they walked hastily away.\n\n“Horrid woman!” was Ethel’s exclamation.\n\n“But Flora,” said innocent Mary, “why would you not let me give the\nlittle girl my boots?”\n\n“Perhaps I may, if she is good and comes to school, said Flora.\n\n“I think Margaret ought to settle what you do with your boots,” said\nRichard, not much to Flora’s satisfaction.\n\n“It is the same,” she said. “If I approve, Margaret will not object.”\n\n“How well you helped us out, Flora,” said Ethel; “I did not know in the\nleast what to say.”\n\n“It will be the best way of testing her sincerity, said Flora; and at\nleast it will do the child good; but I congratulate you on the promising\naspect of Cocksmoor.”\n\n“We did not expect to find a perfect place,” said Ethel; “if it were, it\nwould be of no use to go to it.”\n\nEthel could answer with dignity, but her heart sank at the aspect of\nwhat she had undertaken. She knew there would be evil, but she had\nexpected it in a more striking and less disagreeable form.\n\nThat walk certainly made her less impatient, though it did not relax her\ndetermination, nor the guard over her lion and bear, which her own\ngood feeling, aided by Margaret’s council, showed her were the greatest\nhindrances to her doing anything good and great.\n\nThough she was obliged to set to work so many principles and reflections\nto induce herself to wipe a pen, or to sit straight on her chair, that\nit was like winding up a steam-engine to thread a needle; yet the work\nwas being done--she was struggling with her faults, humbled by them,\nwatching them, and overcoming them.\n\nFlora, meanwhile, was sitting calmly down in the contemplation of the\nunexpected services she had rendered, confident that her character for\nenergy and excellence was established, believing it herself, and looking\nback on her childish vanity and love of domineering as long past and\nconquered. She thought her grown-up character had begun, and was too\nsecure to examine it closely.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\n\n     One thing is wanting in the beamy cup\n       Of my young life! one thing to be poured in;\n     Ay, and one thing is wanting to fill up\n       The measure of proud joy, and make it sin.--F. W. F.\n\n\nHopes that Dr. May would ever have his mind free, seemed as fallacious\nas mamma’s old promise to Margaret, to make doll’s clothes for her\nwhenever there should be no live dolls to be worked for in the nursery.\n\nRichard and Ethel themselves had their thoughts otherwise engrossed.\nThe last week before the holidays was an important one. There was\nan examination, by which the standing of the boys in the school was\ndetermined, and this time it was of more than ordinary importance, as\nthe Randall scholarship of £100 a year for three years would be open in\nthe summer to the competition of the first six boys. Richard had never\ncome within six of the top, but had been past at every examination by\nyounger boys, till his father could bear it no longer; and now Norman\nwas too young to be likely to have much chance of being of the number.\nThere were eight decidedly his seniors, and Harvey Anderson, a small,\nquick-witted boy, half a year older, who had entered school at the same\ntime, and had always been one step below him, had, in the last three\nmonths, gained fast upon him.\n\nHarry, however, meant Norman to be one of the six, and declared all the\nfellows thought he would be, except Andersen’s party. Mr. Wilmot, in a\ncall on Ethel and Flora, told them that he thought their brother had a\nfair chance, but he feared he was over-working himself, and should tell\nthe doctor so, whenever he could catch him; but this was difficult, as\nthere was a great deal of illness just then, and he was less at home\nthan usual.\n\nAll this excited the home party, but Norman only seemed annoyed by talk\nabout it, and though always with a book in his hand, was so dreamy and\nlistless, that Flora declared that there was no fear of his doing too\nmuch--she thought he would fail for want of trying.\n\n“I mean to try,” said Norman; “say no more about it, pray.”\n\nThe great day was the 20th of December, and Ethel ran out, as the boys\nwent to school, to judge of Norman’s looks, which were not promising.\n“No wonder,” said Harry, since he had stayed up doing Euripides and\nCicero the whole length of a candle that had been new at bedtime. “But\nnever mind, Ethel, if he only beats Anderson, I don’t care for anything\nelse.”\n\n“Oh, it will be unbearable if he does not! Do try, Norman, dear.”\n\n“Never you mind.”\n\n“He’ll light up at the last moment,” said Ethel, consolingly, to Harry;\nbut she was very uneasy herself, for she had set her heart on his\nsurpassing Harvey Anderson. No more was heard all day. Tom went at\ndinner-time to see if he could pick up any news; but he was shy, or\nwas too late, and gained no intelligence. Dr. May and Richard talked\nof going to hear the speeches and viva voce examination in the\nafternoon--objects of great interest to all Stoneborough men--but just\nas they came home from a long day’s work, Dr. May was summoned to the\nnext town, by an electric telegraph, and, as it was to a bad case, he\ndid not expect to be at home till the mail-train came in at one o’clock\nat night. Richard begged to go with him, and he consented, unwillingly,\nto please Margaret, who could not bear to think of his “fending for\nhimself” in the dark on the rail-road.\n\nVery long did the evening seem to the listening sisters. Eight, and\nno tidings; nine, the boys not come; Tom obliged to go to bed by sheer\nsleepiness, and Ethel unable to sit still, and causing Flora demurely to\nwonder at her fidgeting so much, it would be so much better to fix her\nattention to some employment; while Margaret owned that Flora was right,\nbut watched, and started at each sound, almost as anxiously as Ethel.\n\nIt was ten, when there was a sharp pull at the bell, and down flew the\nsisters; but old James was beforehand, and Harry was exclaiming, “Dux!\nJames, he is Dux! Hurrah! Flossy, Ethel, Mary! There stands the Dux of\nStoneborough! Where’s papa?”\n\n“Sent for to Whitford. But oh! Norman, Dux! Is he really?”\n\n“To be sure, but I must tell Margaret,” and up he rushed, shouted the\nnews to her, but could not stay for congratulation; broke Tom’s slumber\nby roaring it in his ear, and dashed into the nursery, where nurse for\nonce forgave him for waking the baby. Norman, meanwhile, followed his\neager sisters into the drawing-room, putting up his hand as if the\nlight dazzled him, and looking, by no means, as it he had just achieved\ntriumphant success.\n\nEthel paused in her exultation: “But is it, is it true, Norman?”\n\n“Yes,” he said wearily, making his way to his dark corner.\n\n“But what was it for? How is it?”\n\n“I don’t know,” he answered.\n\n“What’s the matter?” said Flora. “Are you tired, Norman, dear, does your\nhead ache?”\n\n“Yes;” and the pain was evidently severe.\n\n“Won’t you come to Margaret?” said Ethel, knowing what was the greater\nsuffering; but he did not move, and they forbore to torment him with\nquestions. The next moment Harry came down in an ecstacy, bringing in,\nfrom the hall, Norman’s beautiful prize books, and showing off their\nLatin inscription.\n\n“Ah!” said he, looking at his brother, “he is regularly done for.\nHe ought to turn in at once. That Everard is a famous fellow for an\nexaminer. He said he never had seen such a copy of verses sent up by a\nschool-boy, and could hardly believe June was barely sixteen. Old Hoxton\nsays he is the youngest Dux they have had these fifty years that he\nhas known the school, and Mr. Wilmot said ‘twas the most creditable\nexamination he had ever known, and that I might tell papa so. What did\npossess that ridiculous old landlubber at Whitford, to go and get on the\nsick-list on this, of all the nights of the year? June, how can you go\non sitting there, when you know you ought to be in your berth?”\n\n“I wish he was,” said Flora, “but let him have some tea first.”\n\n“And tell us more, Harry,” said Ethel. “Oh! it is famous! I knew he\nwould come right at last. It is too delightful, if papa was but here!”\n\n“Isn’t it? You should have seen how Anderson grinned--he is only\nfourth--down below Forder, and Cheviot, and Ashe.”\n\n“Well, I did not think Norman would have been before Forder and Cheviot.\nThat is grand.”\n\n“It was the verses that did it,” said Harry; “they had an hour to do\nThemistocles on the hearth of Admetus, and there he beat them all to\nshivers. ‘Twas all done smack, smooth, without a scratch, in Alcaics,\nand Cheviot heard Wilmot saying, ‘twas no mere task, but had poetry, and\nall that sort of thing in it. But I don’t know whether that would have\ndone, if he had not come out so strong in the recitation; they put him\non in Priam’s speech to Achilles, and he said it--Oh it was too bad papa\ndid not hear him! Every one held their breath and listened.”\n\n“How you do go on!” muttered Norman; but no one heeded, and Harry\ncontinued. “He construed a chorus in Sophocles without a blunder, but\nwhat did the business was this, I believe. They asked all manner of\nout-of-the-way questions--history and geography, what no one expected,\nand the fellows who read nothing they can help, were thoroughly posed.\nForder had not a word to say, and the others were worse, for Cheviot\nthought Queen Elizabeth’s Earl of Leicester was Simon de Montfort; and\ndidn’t know when that battle was, beginning with an E.--was it Evesham,\nor Edgehill?”\n\n“O Harry, you are as bad yourself?”\n\n“But any one would know Leicester, because of Kenilworth,” said Harry;\n“and I’m not sixth form. If papa had but been there! Every one was\nasking for him, and wishing it. For Dr. Hoxton called me--they shook\nhands with me, and wished me joy of it, and told me to tell my father\nhow well Norman had done.”\n\n“I suppose you looked so happy, they could not help it,” said Flora,\nsmiling at that honest beaming face of joy.\n\n“Ay,” said Norman, looking up; “they had something to say to him on his\nown score, which he has forgotten.”\n\n“I should think not,” said Harry. “Why, what d’ye think they said? That\nI had gone on as well as all the Mays, and they trusted I should still,\nand be a credit to my profession.”\n\n“Oh! Harry! why didn’t you tell us?”\n\n“Oh! that is grand!” and, as the two elder girls made this exclamation,\nMary proceeded to a rapturous embrace. “Get along, Mary, you are\nthrottling one. Mr. Everard inquired for my father and Margaret, and\nsaid he’d call to-morrow, and Hoxton and Wilmot kept on wishing he was\nthere.”\n\n“I wish he had been!” said Ethel; “he would have taken such delight in\nit; but, even if he could have gone, he doubted whether it would not\nhave made Norman get on worse from anxiety.”\n\n“Well, Cheviot wanted me to send up for him at dinner-time,” said Harry;\n“for as soon as we sat down in the hall, June turned off giddy, and\ncould not stay, and looked so horrid, we thought it was all over with\nhim, and he would not be able to go up at all.”\n\n“And Cheviot thought you ought to send for papa!”\n\n“Yes, I knew he would not be in, and so we left him lying down on the\nbench in the cloister till dinner was over.”\n\n“What a place for catching cold!” said Flora.\n\n“So Cheviot said, but I couldn’t help it; and when we went to call him\nafterwards, he was all right. Wasn’t it fun, when the names were called\nover, and May senior at the head! I don’t think it will be better when I\nam a post-captain myself! But Margaret has not heard half yet.”\n\nAfter telling it once in her room, once in the nursery, in whispers\nlike gusts of wind, and once in the pantry, Harry employed himself in\nwriting--“Norman is Dux!” in immense letters, on pieces of paper, which\nhe disposed all over the house, to meet the eyes of his father and\nRichard on their return.\n\nEthel’s joy was sadly damped by Norman’s manner. He hardly spoke--only\njust came in to wish Margaret good-night, and shrank from her\naffectionate sayings, departing abruptly to his own room.\n\n“Poor fellow! he is sadly overdone,” said she, as he went.\n\n“Oh!” sighed Ethel, nearly ready to cry, “‘tis not like what I used to\nfancy it would be when he came to the head of the school!”\n\n“It will be different to-morrow,” said Margaret, trying to console\nherself as well as Ethel. “Think how he has been on the strain this\nwhole day, and long before, doing so much more than older boys. No\nwonder he is tired and worn out.”\n\nEthel did not understand what mental fatigue was, for her active,\nvigorous spirit had never been tasked beyond its powers.\n\n“I hope he will be like himself to-morrow!” said she disconsolately. “I\nnever saw him rough and hasty before. It was even with you, Margaret.”\n\n“No, no, Ethel you aren’t going to blame your own Norman for unkindness\non this of all days in the year. You know how it was; you love him\nbetter; just as I do, for not being able to bear to stay in this room,\nwhere--”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel, mournfully; “it was a great shame of me! How could I?\nDear Norman! how he does grieve--what love his must have been! But yet,\nMargaret,” she said impatiently, and the hot tears breaking out, “I\ncannot--cannot bear it! To have him not caring one bit for all of us! I\nwant him to triumph! I can’t without him!”\n\n“What, Ethel, you, who said you didn’t care for mere distinction and\npraise? Don’t you think dear mamma would say it was safer for him not to\nbe delighted and triumphant?”\n\n“It is very tiresome,” said Ethel, nearly convinced, but in a slightly\npetulant voice.\n\n“And does not one love those two dear boys to-night!” said Margaret.\n“Norman not able to rejoice in his victory without her, and Harry in\nsuch an ecstacy with Norman’s honours. I don’t think I ever was so fond\nof my two brothers.”\n\nEthel smiled, and drew up her head, and said no boys were like them\nanywhere, and papa would be delighted, and so went to bed happier in her\nexultation, and in hoping that the holidays would make Norman himself\nagain.\n\nNothing could be better news for Dr. May, who had never lost a grain\nof the ancient school-party-loyalty that is part of the nature of the\nEnglish gentleman. He was a thorough Stoneborough boy, had followed\nthe politics of the Whichcote foundation year by year all his life, and\nperhaps, in his heart, regarded no honour as more to be prized than that\nof Dux and Randall scholar. Harry was in his room the next morning as\nsoon as ever he was stirring, a welcome guest--teased a little at first,\nby his pretending to take it all as a sailor’s prank to hoax him and\nRichard, and then free to pour out to delighted ears the whole history\nof the examination, and of every one’s congratulations.\n\nNorman himself was asleep when Harry went to give this narration. He\ncame down late, and his father rose to meet him as he entered. “My boy,”\n he said, “I had not expected this of you. Well done, Norman!” and the\nwhole tone and gesture had a heartfelt approval and joy in them, that\nEthel knew her brother was deeply thrilled by, for his colour deepened,\nand his lips quivered into something like a smile, though he did not\nlift his eyes.\n\nThen came Richard’s warm greeting and congratulation, he, too, showing\nhimself as delighted as if the honours were his own; and then Dr. May\nagain, in lively tones, like old times, laughing at Norman for sleeping\nlate, and still not looking well awake, asking him if he was quite sure\nit was not all a dream.\n\n“Well,” said Norman, “I should think it was, if it were not that you all\nbelieve it.”\n\n“Harry had better go to sleep next,” said Dr. May, “and see what\ndreaming will make him. If it makes Dux of Norman, who knows but it may\nmake Drakes of him? Ha! Ethel--\n\n\n       “Oh, give us for our Kings such Queens,\n          And for our Ducks such Drakes.”\n\n\nThere had not been such a merry breakfast for months. There was the old\nconfusion of voices; the boys, Richard, and the doctor had much to talk\nover of the school doings of this week, and there was nearly as much\nlaughing as in days past. Ethel wondered whether any one but herself\nobserved that the voice most seldom heard was Norman’s.\n\nThe promised call was made by Dr. Hoxton, and Mr. Everard, an old\nfriend, and after their departure Dr. May came to Margaret’s room with\nfresh accounts, corroborating what Harry had said of the clear knowledge\nand brilliant talent that Norman had displayed, to a degree that\nsurprised his masters, almost as much as the examiners. The copy\nof verses Dr. May brought with him, and construed them to Margaret,\ncommenting all the way on their ease, and the fullness of thought,\ncertainly remarkable in a boy of sixteen.\n\nThey were then resigned to Ethel’s keeping, and she could not help\nimparting her admiration to their author, with some apology for vexing\nhim again.\n\n“I don’t want to be cross,” said Norman, whom these words roused to a\nsense that he had been churlish last night; “but I cannot help it. I\nwish people would not make such a fuss about it.”\n\n“I don’t think you can be well, Norman.”\n\n“Nonsense. There’s nothing the matter with me.”\n\n“But I don’t understand your not caring at all, and not being the least\npleased.”\n\n“It only makes it worse,” said Norman; “I only feel as if I wanted to be\nout of the way. My only comfortable time yesterday was on that bench in\nthe cool quiet cloister. I don’t think I could have got through without\nthat, when they left me in peace, till Cheviot and Harry came to rout me\nup, and I knew it was all coming.”\n\n“Ah! you have overworked yourself, but it was for something. You have\ngiven papa such pleasure and comfort, as you can’t help being glad of.\nThat is very different from us foolish young ones and our trumpeting.”\n\n“What comfort can it be? I’ve not been the smallest use all this time.\nWhen he was ill, I left him to Ernescliffe, and lay on the floor like\nan ass; and if he were to ask me to touch his arm, I should be as bad\nagain. A fine thing for me to have talked all that arrogant stuff about\nRichard! I hate the thought of it; and, as if to make arrows and barbs\nof it, here’s Richard making as much of this as if it was a double first\nclass! He afraid to be compared with me, indeed!”\n\n“Norman, indeed, this is going too far. We can’t be as useful as the\nelder ones; and when you know how papa was vexed about Richard, you must\nbe glad to have pleased him.”\n\n“If I were he, it would only make me miss her more. I believe he only\nmakes much of me that he may not disappoint me.”\n\n“I don’t think so. He is really glad, and the more because she would\nhave been so pleased. He said it would have been a happy day for her,\nand there was more of the glad look than the sorry one. It was the\nglistening look that comes when he is watching baby, or hearing Margaret\nsay pretty things to her. You see it is the first bright morning we have\nhad.”\n\n“Yes,” said Norman; “perhaps it was, but I don’t know. I thought half of\nit was din.”\n\n“Oh, Norman!”\n\n“And another thing, Ethel, I don’t feel as if I had fairly earned it.\nForder or Cheviot ought to have had it. They are both more really good\nscholars than I am, and have always been above me. There was nothing\nI really knew better, except those historical questions that no one\nreckoned on; and not living at home with their sisters and books, they\nhad no such chance, and it is very hard on them, and I don’t like it.”\n\n“Well, but you really and truly beat them in everything.”\n\n“Ay, by chance. There were lots of places in construing, where I should\nhave broken down if I had happened to be set on in them; it was only a\nwonder I did not in that chorus, for I had only looked at it twice; but\nEverard asked me nothing but what I knew; and now and then I get into\na funny state, when nothing is too hard for me, and that was how it was\nyesterday evening. Generally, I feel as dull as a post,” said Norman,\nyawning and stretching; “I could not make a nonsense hexameter this\nminute, if I was to die for it.”\n\n“A sort of Berserkar fury!” said Ethel, “like that night you did the\ncoral-worm verses. It’s very odd. Are you sure you are well, dear\nNorman?”\n\nTo which he answered, with displeasure, that he was as well as possible,\nordered her not to go and make any more fuss, and left her hastily. She\nwas unhappy, and far from satisfied; she had never known his temper\nso much affected, and was much puzzled; but she was too much afraid of\nvexing him, to impart her perplexity even to Margaret. However, the next\nday, Sunday, as she was reading to Margaret after church, her father\ncame in, and the first thing he said was, “I want to know what you think\nof Norman.”\n\n“How do you mean?” said Margaret; “in health or spirits?”\n\n“Both,” said Dr. May. “Poor boy! he has never held up his head since\nOctober, and, at his age, that is hardly natural. He goes moping about,\nhas lost flesh and appetite, and looks altogether out of order, shooting\nup like a Maypole too.”\n\n“Mind and body,” said Margaret, while Ethel gazed intently at her\nfather, wondering whether she ought to speak, for Margaret did not know\nhalf what she did; nothing about the bad nights, nor what he called the\n“funny state.”\n\n“Yes, both. I fancied it was only his rapid growth, and the excitement\nof this examination, and that it would go off, but I think there’s more\namiss. He was lounging about doing nothing, when the girls were gone\nto school after dinner, and I asked him to walk down with me to the\nAlmshouses. He did not seem very willing, but he went, and presently, as\nI had hold of his arm, I felt him shivering, and saw him turn as pale as\na sheet. As soon as I noticed it, he flushed crimson, and would not hear\nof turning back, stoutly protesting he was quite well, but I saw his\nhand was quivering even when I got into church. Why, Ethel, you have\nturned as red as he did.”\n\n“Then he has done it!” exclaimed Ethel, in a smothered voice.\n\n“What do you mean? Speak, Ethel.”\n\n“He has gone past it--the place,” whispered she.\n\nThe doctor made a sound of sorrowful assent, as if much struck; then\nsaid, “you don’t mean he has never been there since?”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel, “he has always gone round Randall’s alley or the\ngarden; he has said nothing, but has contrived to avoid it.”\n\n“Well,” said Dr. May, after a pause, “I hoped none of us knew the exact\nspot.”\n\n“We don’t; he never told us, but he was there.”\n\n“Was he?” exclaimed her father; “I had no notion of that. How came he\nthere?”\n\n“He went on with Mr. Ernescliffe, and saw it all,” said Ethel, as her\nfather drew out her words, apparently with his eye; “and then came up to\nmy room so faint that he was obliged to lie on the floor ever so long.”\n\n“Faint--how long did it last?” said her father, examining her without\napparent emotion, as if it had been an indifferent patient.\n\n“I don’t know, things seemed so long that evening. Till after dark at\nleast, and it came on in the morning--no, the Monday. I believe it was\nyour arm--for talking of going to see you always brought it on, till Mr.\nWard gave him a dose of brandy-and-water, and that stopped it.”\n\n“I wish I had known this before. Derangement of the nervous system, no\ndoubt--a susceptible boy like that--I wonder what sort of nights he has\nbeen having.”\n\n“Terrible ones,” said Ethel; “I don’t think he ever sleeps quietly till\nmorning; he has dreams, and he groans and talks in his sleep; Harry can\ntell you all that.”\n\n“Bless me!” cried Dr. May, in some anger; “what have you all been\nthinking about to keep this to yourselves all this time?”\n\n“He could not bear to have it mentioned,” said Ethel timidly; “and I\ndidn’t know that it signified so much; does it?”\n\n“It signifies so much, that I had rather have given a thousand pounds\nthan have let him go on all this time, to be overworked at school, and\nwound up to that examination!”\n\n“Oh, dear! I am sorry!” said Ethel, in great dismay. “If you had but\nbeen at home when Cheviot wanted Harry to have sent for you--because he\ndid not think him fit for it!” And Ethel was much relieved by pouring\nout all she knew, though her alarm was by no means lessened by the\neffect it produced on her father, especially when he heard of the “funny\nstate.”\n\n“A fine state of things,” he said; “I wonder it has not brought on a\ntremendous illness by this time. A boy of that sensitive temperament\nmeeting with such a shock--never looked after--the quietest and most\nknocked down of all, and therefore the most neglected--his whole system\ndisordered--and then driven to school to be harassed and overworked; if\nwe had wanted to occasion brain fever we could not have gone a better\nway to set about it. I should not wonder if health and nerves were\ndamaged for life!”\n\n“Oh! papa, papa!” cried Ethel, in extreme distress, “what shall I do! I\nwish I had told you, but--”\n\n“I’m not blaming you, Ethel, you knew no better, but it has been\ngrievous neglect. It is plain enough there is no one to see after you,”\n said the doctor, with a low groan.\n\n“We may be taking it in time,” said Margaret’s soft voice--“it is very\nwell it has gone on no longer.”\n\n“Three months is long enough,” said Dr. May.\n\n“I suppose,” continued Margaret, “it will be better not to let dear\nNorman know we are uneasy about him.”\n\n“No, no, certainly not. Don’t say a word of this to him. I shall\nfind Harry, and ask about these disturbed nights, and then watch him,\ntrusting it may not have gone too far; but there must be dreadful\nexcitability of brain!”\n\nHe went away, leaving Margaret to comfort Ethel as well as she could, by\nshowing her that he had not said the mischief was done, putting her in\nmind that he was wont to speak strongly; and trying to make her thankful\nthat her brother would now have such care as might avert all evil\nresults.\n\n“But, oh,” said Ethel, “his success has been dearly purchased!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\n\n                      “It hath do me mochil woe.”\n      “Yea hath it?  Use,” quod he, “this medicine;\n      Every daie this Maie or that thou dine,\n      Go lokin in upon the freshe daisie,\n      And though thou be for woe in poinct to die,\n      That shall full gretly lessen thee of thy pine.”\n                                                    CHAUCER.\n\n\nThat night Norman started from, what was not so much sleep, as a trance\nof oppression and suffering, and beheld his father’s face watching him\nattentively.\n\n“Papa! What’s the matter?” said he, starting up. “Is any one ill?”\n\n“No; no one, lie down again,” said Dr. May, possessing himself of a\nhand, with a burning spot in the palm, and a throbbing pulse.\n\n“But what made you come here? Have I disturbed any one? Have I been\ntalking?”\n\n“Only mumbling a little, but you looked very uncomfortable.”\n\n“But I’m not ill--what are you feeling my pulse for?” said Norman\nuneasily.\n\n“To see whether that restless sleep has quickened it.”\n\nNorman scarcely let his father count for a moment, before he asked,\n“What o’clock is it?”\n\n“A little after twelve.”\n\n“What does make you stay up so late, papa?”\n\n“I often do when my arm seems likely to keep me awake. Richard has done\nall I want.”\n\n“Pray don’t stay here in the cold,” said Norman, with feverish\nimpatience, as he turned upwards the cool side of his pillow.\n“Good-night!”\n\n“No hurry,” said his father, still watching him.\n\n“There’s nothing the matter,” repeated the boy.\n\n“Do you often have such unquiet nights?”\n\n“Oh, it does not signify. Good-night,” and he tried to look settled and\ncomfortable.\n\n“Norman,” said his father, in a voice betraying much grief, “it will not\ndo to go on in this way. If your mother was here, you would not close\nyourself against her.”\n\nNorman interrupted him in a voice strangled with sobs: “It is no good\nsaying it--I thought it would only make it worse for you; but that’s it.\nI cannot bear the being without her.”\n\nDr. May was glad to see that a gush of tears followed this exclamation,\nas Norman hid his face under the coverings.\n\n“My poor boy,” said he, hardly able to speak, “only One can comfort you\ntruly; but you must not turn from me; you must let me do what I can for\nyou, though it is not the same.”\n\n“I thought it would grieve you more,” said Norman, turning his face\ntowards him again.\n\n“What, to find my children, feeling with me, and knowing what they have\nlost? Surely not, Norman.”\n\n“And it is of no use,” added Norman, hiding his face again, “no one can\ncomfort--”\n\n“There you are wrong,” said Dr. May, with deep feeling, “there is much\ncomfort in everything, in everybody, in kindness, in all around, if one\ncan only open one’s mind to it. But I did not come to keep you awake\nwith such talk: I saw you were not quite well, so I came up to see about\nyou; and now, Norman, you will not refuse to own that something is the\nmatter.”\n\n“I did not know it,” said Norman, “I really believe I am well, if I\ncould get rid of these horrible nights. I either lie awake, tumbling and\ntossing, or I get all sorts of unbearable dreams.”\n\n“Ay, when I asked master Harry about you, all the answer I could get\nwas, that he was quite used to it, and did not mind it at all. As if\nI asked for his sake! How fast that boy sleeps--he is fit for a\nmidshipman’s berth!”\n\n“But do you think there is anything amiss with me?”\n\n“I shall know more about that to-morrow morning. Come to my room as\nsoon as you are up, unless I come to you. Now, I have something to read\nbefore I go to bed, and I may as well try if it will put you to sleep.”\n\nNorman’s last sight that night was of the outline of his father’s\nprofile, and he was scarcely awake the next morning before Dr. May was\nthere again.\n\nUnwilling as he had been to give way, it was a relief to relinquish the\nstruggle to think himself well, and to venture to lounge and dawdle,\nrest his heavy head, and stretch his inert limbs without fear of\nremark. His father found him after breakfast lying on the sofa in the\ndrawing-room with a Greek play by his side, telling Ethel what words to\nlook out.\n\n“At it again!” exclaimed Dr. May. “Carry it away, Ethel. I will have no\nLatin or Greek touched these holidays.”\n\n“You know,” said Norman, “if I don’t sap, I shall have no chance of\nkeeping up.”\n\n“You’ll keep nowhere if you don’t rest.”\n\n“It is only Euripides, and I can’t do anything else,” said Norman\nlanguidly.\n\n“Very likely, I don’t care. You have to get well first of all, and the\nGreek will take care of itself. Go up to Margaret. I put you in her\nkeeping, while I am gone to Whitford. After that, I dare say\nRichard will be very glad to have a holiday, and let you drive me to\nAbbotstoke.”\n\nNorman rose, and wearily walked upstairs, while his sister lingered\nto excuse herself. “Papa, I did not think Euripides would hurt him--he\nknows it all so well, and he said he could not read anything else.”\n\n“Just so, Ethel. Poor fellow, he has not spirits or energy for anything:\nhis mind was forced into those classicalities when it wanted rest, and\nnow it has not spring enough to turn back again.”\n\n“Do you think him so very ill?”\n\n“Not exactly, but there’s low fever hanging about him, and we must look\nafter him well, and I hope we may get him right. I have told Margaret\nabout him; I can’t stop any longer now.”\n\nNorman found the baby in his sister’s room, and this was just what\nsuited him. The Daisy showed a marked preference for her brothers; and\nto find her so merry and good with him, pleased and flattered him far\nmore than his victory at school. He carried her about, danced her,\nwhistled to her, and made her admire her pretty blue eyes in the glass\nmost successfully, till nurse carried her off. But perhaps he had been\nsent up rather too soon, for as he sat in the great chair by the fire,\nhe was teased by the constant coming and going, all the petty cares of\na large household transacted by Margaret--orders to butcher and\ncook--Harry racing in to ask to take Tom to the river--Tom, who was to\ngo when his lesson was done, coming perpetually to try to repeat the\nsame unhappy bit of ‘As in Proesenti’, each time in a worse whine.\n\n“How can you bear it, Margaret?” said Norman, as she finally dismissed\nTom, and laid down her account-book, taking up some delicate fancy work.\n“Mercy, here’s another,” as enter a message about lamp oil, in the midst\nof which Mary burst in to beg Margaret to get Miss Winter to let her go\nto the river with Harry and Tom.\n\n“No, indeed, Mary, I could not think of such a thing. You had better go\nback to your lessons, and don’t be silly,” as she looked much disposed\nto cry.\n\n“No one but a Tom-boy would dream of it,” added Norman; and Mary\ndeparted disconsolate, while Margaret gave a sigh of weariness, and\nsaid, as she returned to her work, “There, I believe I have done. I hope\nI was not cross with poor Mary, but it was rather too much to ask.”\n\n“I can’t think how you can help being cross to every one,” said Norman,\nas he took away the books she had done with.\n\n“I am afraid I am,” said Margaret sadly. “It does get trying at times.”\n\n“I should think so! This eternal worrying must be more than any one can\nbear, always lying there too.”\n\n“It is only now and then that it grows tiresome,” said Margaret. “I am\ntoo happy to be of some use, and it is too bad to repine, but sometimes\na feeling comes of its being always the same, as if a little change\nwould be such a treat.”\n\n“Aren’t you very tired of lying in bed?”\n\n“Yes, very, sometimes. I fancy, but it is only fancy, that I could move\nbetter if I was up and dressed. It has seemed more so lately, since I\nhave been stronger.”\n\n“When do you think they will let you get up?”\n\n“There’s the question. I believe papa thinks I might be lifted to the\nsofa now--and oh! how I long for it--but then Mr. Ward does not approve\nof my sitting up, even as I am doing now, and wants to keep me flat.\nPapa thinks that of no use, and likely to hurt my general health, and\nI believe the end of it will be that he will ask Sir Matthew Fleet’s\nopinion.”\n\n“Is that the man he calls Mat?”\n\n“Yes, you know they went through the university together, and were at\nEdinburgh and Paris, but they have never met since he set up in London,\nand grew so famous. I believe it would be a great treat to papa to have\nhim, and it would be a good thing for papa too; I don’t think his arm is\ngoing on right--he does not trust to Mr. Ward’s treatment, and I am sure\nsome one else ought to see it.”\n\n“Did you know, Margaret, that he sits up quite late, because he cannot\nsleep for it?”\n\n“Yes, I hear him moving about, but don’t tell him so; I would not have\nhim guess for the world, that it kept me awake.”\n\n“And does it?”\n\n“Why, if I think he is awake and in pain I cannot settle myself to\nsleep; but that is no matter; having no exercise, of course I don’t\nsleep so much. But I am very anxious about him--he looks so thin, and\ngets so fagged--and no wonder.”\n\n“Ah! Mr. Everard told me he was quite shocked to see him, and would\nhardly have known him,” and Norman groaned from the bottom of his heart.\n\n“Well, I shall hope much from Sir Matthew’s taking him in hand,” said\nMargaret cheerfully; “he will mind him, though he will not Mr. Ward.”\n\n“I wish the holidays were over!” said Norman, with a yawn, as expressive\nas a sigh.\n\n“That’s not civil, on the third day,” said Margaret, smiling, “when I am\nso glad to have you to look after me, so as to set Flora at liberty.”\n\n“What, can I do you any good?” said Norman, with a shade of his former\nalacrity.\n\n“To be sure you can, a great deal. Better not come near me otherwise,\nfor I make every one into a slave. I want my morning reading now--that\nbook on Advent, there.”\n\n“Shall I read it to you?”\n\n“Thank you, that’s nice, and I shall get on with baby’s frock.”\n\nNorman read, but, ere long, took to yawning; Margaret begged for the\nbook, which he willingly resigned, saying, however, that he liked it,\nonly he was stupid. She read on aloud, till she heard a succession of\nheavy breathings, and saw him fast asleep, and so he continued till\nwaked by his father’s coming home.\n\nRichard and Ethel were glad of a walk, for Margaret had found them a\npleasant errand. Their Cocksmoor children could not go home to dinner\nbetween service and afternoon school, and Margaret had desired the cook\nto serve them up some broth in the back kitchen, to which the brother\nand sister were now to invite them. Mary was allowed to take her boots\nto Rebekah Watts, since Margaret held that goodness had better be\nprofitable, at least at the outset; and Harry and Tom joined the party.\n\nNorman, meantime, was driving his father--a holiday preferment highly\nvalued in the days when Dr. May used only to assume the reins, when his\nspirited horses showed too much consciousness that they had a young\nhand over them, or when the old hack took a fit of laziness. Now, Norman\nneeded Richard’s assurance that the bay was steady, so far was he from\nbeing troubled with his ancient desire, that the steed would rear right\nup on his hind legs.\n\nHe could neither talk nor listen till he was clear out of the town, and\nfound himself master of the animal, and even then the words were few,\nand chiefly spoken by Dr. May, until after going along about three miles\nof the turnpike road, he desired Norman to turn down a cross-country\nlane.\n\n“Where does this lead?”\n\n“It comes out at Abbotstoke, but I have to go to an outlying farm.”\n\n“Papa,” said Norman, after a few minutes, “I wish you would let me do my\nGreek.”\n\n“Is that what you have been pondering all this time? What, may not the\nbonus Homerus slumber sometimes?”\n\n“It is not Homer, it is Euripides. I do assure you, papa, it is no\ntrouble, and I get much worse without it.”\n\n“Well, stop here, the road grows so bad that we will walk, and let the\nboy lead the horse to meet us at Woodcote.”\n\nNorman followed his father down a steep narrow lane, little better than\na stony water-course, and began to repeat, “If you would but let me do\nmy work! I’ve got nothing else to do, and now they have put me up, I\nshould not like not to keep my place.”\n\n“Very likely, but--hollo--how swelled this is!” said Dr. May, as they\ncame to the bottom of the valley, where a stream rushed along, coloured\nwith a turbid creamy yellow, making little whirlpools where it crossed\nthe road, and brawling loudly just above where it roared and foamed\nbetween two steep banks of rock, crossed by a foot-bridge of planks,\nguarded by a handrail of rough poles. The doctor had traversed it, and\ngone a few paces beyond, when, looking back, he saw Norman very pale,\nwith one foot on the plank, and one hand grasping the rail. He came\nback, and held out his hand, which Norman gladly caught at, but no\nsooner was the other side attained, than the boy, though he gasped with\nrelief, exclaimed, “This is too bad! Wait one moment, please, and let me\ngo back.”\n\nHe tried, but the first touch of the shaking rail, and glance at the\nchasm, disconcerted him, and his father, seeing his white cheeks and\nrigid lips, said, “Stop, Norman, don’t try it. You are not fit,” he\nadded, as the boy came to him reluctantly.\n\n“I can’t bear to be such a wretch!” said he. “I never used to be. I will\nnot--let me conquer it;” and he was turning back, but the doctor took\nhis arm, saying decidedly, “No, I won’t have it done. You are only\nmaking it worse by putting a force on yourself.” But the farther Norman\nwas from the bridge, the more displeased he was with himself, and more\nanxious to dare it again. “There’s no bearing it,” he muttered; “let me\nonly run back. I’ll overtake you. I must do it if no one looks on.”\n\n“No such thing,” said the doctor, holding him fast. “If you do, you’ll\nhave it all over again at night.”\n\n“That’s better than to know I am worse than Tom.”\n\n“I tell you, Norman, it is no such thing. You will recover your tone\nif you will only do as you are told, but your nerves have had a severe\nshock, and when you force yourself in this way, you only increase the\nmischief.”\n\n“Nerves,” muttered Norman disdainfully. “I thought they were only fit\nfor fine ladies.”\n\nDr. May smiled. “Well, will it content you if I promise that as soon as\nI see fit, I’ll bring you here, and let you march over that bridge as\noften as you like?”\n\n“I suppose I must be contented, but I don’t like to feel like a fool.”\n\n“You need not, while the moral determination is sound.”\n\n“But my Greek, papa.”\n\n“At it again--I declare, Norman, you are the worst patient I ever had!”\n\nNorman made no answer, and Dr. May presently said, “Well, let me hear\nwhat you have to say about it. I assure you it is not that I don’t want\nyou to get on, but that I see you are in great need of rest.”\n\n“Thank you, papa. I know you mean it for my good, but I don’t think\nyou do know how horrid it is. I have got nothing on earth to do or care\nfor--the school work comes quite easy to me, and I’m sure thinking is\nworse; and then”--Norman spoke vehemently--“now they have put me up, it\nwill never do to be beaten, and all the four others ought to be able to\ndo it. I did not want or expect to be dux, but now I am, you could not\nbear me not to keep my place, and to miss the Randall scholarship, as I\ncertainly shall, if I do not work these whole holidays.”\n\n“Norman, I know it,” said his father kindly. “I am very sorry for\nyou, and I know I am asking of you what I could not have done at your\nage--indeed, I don’t believe I could have done it for you a few months\nago. It is my fault that you have been let alone, to have an overstrain\nand pressure on your mind, when you were not fit for it, and I cannot\nsee any remedy but complete freedom from work. At the same time, if you\nfret and harass yourself about being surpassed, that is, as you say,\nmuch worse for you than Latin and Greek. Perhaps I may be wrong, and\nstudy might not do you the harm I think it would; at any rate, it is\nbetter than tormenting yourself about next half year, so I will not\npositively forbid it, but I think you had much better let it alone. I\ndon’t want to make it a matter of duty. I only tell you this, that you\nmay set your mind at rest as far as I am concerned. If you do lose your\nplace, I will consider it as my own doing, and not be disappointed. I\nhad rather see you a healthy, vigorous, useful man, than a poor puling\nnervous wretch of a scholar, if you were to get all the prizes in the\nuniversity.”\n\nNorman made a little murmuring sound of assent, and both were silent for\nsome moments, then he said, “Then you will not be displeased, papa, if I\ndo read, as long as I feel it does me no harm.”\n\n“I told you I don’t mean to make it a matter of obedience. Do as you\nplease--I had rather you read than vexed yourself.”\n\n“I am glad of it. Thank you, papa,” said Norman, in a much cheered\nvoice.\n\nThey had, in the meantime, been mounting a rising ground, clothed with\nstunted wood, and came out on a wide heath, brown with dead bracken; a\nhollow, traced by the tops of leafless trees, marked the course of the\nstream that traversed it, and the inequalities of ground becoming more\nrugged in outlines and grayer in colouring as they receded, till they\nwere closed by a dark fir wood, beyond which rose in extreme distance\nthe grand mass of Welsh mountain heads, purpled against the evening sky,\nexcept where the crowning peaks bore a veil of snow. Behind, the sky was\npure gold, gradually shading into pale green, and then into clear light\nwintry blue, while the sun sitting behind two of the loftiest, seemed\nto confound their outlines, and blend them in one flood of soft hazy\nbrightness. Dr. May looked at his son, and saw his face clear up, his\nbrow expand, and his lips unclose with admiration.\n\n“Yes,” said the doctor, “it is very fine, is it not? I used to bring\nmamma here now and then for a treat, because it put her in mind of her\nScottish hills. Well, your’s are the golden hills of heaven, now, my\nMaggie!” he added, hardly knowing that he spoke aloud. Norman’s throat\nswelled, as he looked up in his face, then cast down his eyes hastily to\nhide the tears that had gathered on his eyelashes.\n\n“I’ll leave you here,” said Dr. May; “I have to go to a farmhouse close\nby, in the hollow behind us; there’s a girl recovering from a fever.\nI’ll not be ten minutes, so wait here.”\n\nWhen he came back, Norman was still where he had left him, gazing\nearnestly, and the tears standing on his cheeks. He did not move till\nhis father laid his hand on his shoulder--they walked away together\nwithout a word, and scarcely spoke all the way home.\n\nDr. May went to Margaret and talked to her of Norman’s fine character,\nand intense affection for his mother, the determined temper, and quietly\nborne grief, for which the doctor seemed to have worked himself into a\nperfect enthusiasm of admiration; but lamenting that he could not tell\nwhat to do with him--study or no study hurt him alike--and he dreaded to\nsee health and spirits shattered for ever. They tried to devise change\nof scene, but it did not seem possible just at present; and Margaret,\nbesides her fears for Norman, was much grieved to see this added to her\nfather’s troubles.\n\nAt night Dr. May again went up to see whether Norman, whom he had moved\ninto Margaret’s former room, were again suffering from fever. He found\nhim asleep in a restless attitude, as if he had just dropped off, and\nwaking almost at the instant of his entrance, he exclaimed, “Is it you?\nI thought it was mamma. She said it was all ambition.”\n\nThen starting, and looking round the room, and at his father, he\ncollected himself, and said, with a slight smile, “I didn’t know I had\nbeen asleep. I was awake just now, thinking about it. Papa, I’ll give\nit up. I’ll try to put next half out of my head, and not mind if they do\npass me.”\n\n“That’s right, my boy,” said the doctor.\n\n“At least if Cheviot and Forder do, for they ought. I only hope Anderson\nwon’t. I can stand anything but that. But that is nonsense too.”\n\n“You are quite right, Norman,” said the doctor, “and it is a great\nrelief to me that you see the thing so sensibly.”\n\n“No, I don’t see it sensibly at all, papa. I hate it all the time, and\nI don’t know whether I can keep from thinking of it, when I have nothing\nto do; but I see it is wrong; I thought all ambition and nonsense was\ngone out of me, when I cared so little for the examination; but now\nI see, though I did not want to be made first, I can’t bear not to be\nfirst; and that’s the old story, just as she used to tell me to guard\nagainst ambition. So I’ll take my chance, and if I should get put down,\nwhy, ‘twas not fair that I should be put up, and it is what I ought to\nbe, and serves me right into the bargain--”\n\n“Well, that’s the best sort of sense, your mother’s sense,” said the\ndoctor, more affected than he liked to show. “No wonder she came to you\nin your dream, Norman, my boy, if you had come to such a resolution.\nI was half in hopes you had some such notion when I came upon you, on\nFar-view down.”\n\n“I think that sky did it,” said Norman, in a low voice; “it made me\nthink of her in a different way--and what you said too.”\n\n“What did I say? I don’t remember.”\n\nBut Norman could not repeat the words, and only murmured, “Golden\nhills.” It was enough.\n\n“I see,” said the doctor, “you had dwelt on the blank here, not taken\nhome what it is to her.”\n\n“Ay,” almost sobbed Norman, “I never could before--that made me,” after\na long silence, “and then I know how foolish I was, and how she would\nsay it was wrong to make this fuss, when you did not like it, about my\nplace, and that it was not for the sake of my duty, but of ambition. I\nknew that, but till I went to bed to-night, I could not tell whether I\ncould make up my mind, so I would say nothing.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n\n     The days are sad, it is the Holy tide,\n     When flowers have ceased to blow and birds to sing.\n                                               F. TENNYSON.\n\n\nIt had been a hard struggle to give up all thoughts of study, and Norman\nwas not at first rewarded for it, but rather exemplified the truth of\nhis own assertion, that he was worse without it; for when this sole\noccupation for his mind was taken away, he drooped still more. He would\nwillingly have shown his father that he was not discontented, but he was\ntoo entirely unnerved to be either cheerful or capable of entering with\ninterest into any occupation. If he had been positively ill, the task\nwould have been easier, but the low intermittent fever that hung about\nhim did not confine him to bed, only kept him lounging, listless and\nforlorn, through the weary day, not always able to go out with his\nfather, and on Christmas Day unfit even for church.\n\nAll this made the want of his mother, and the vacancy in his home, still\nmore evident, and nothing was capable of relieving his sadness but his\nfather’s kindness, which was a continual surprise to him. Dr. May was a\nparent who could not fail to be loved and honoured; but, as a busy man,\ntrusting all at home to his wife, he had only appeared to his children\neither as a merry playfellow, or as a stern paternal authority, not\noften in the intermediate light of guiding friend, or gentle guardian;\nand it affected Norman exceedingly to find himself, a tall schoolboy,\nwatched and soothed with motherly tenderness and affection; with\ncomplete comprehension of his feelings, and delicate care of them. His\nfather’s solicitude and sympathy were round him day and night, and this,\nin the midst of so much toil, pain, grief, and anxiety of his own, that\nNorman might well feel overwhelmed with the swelling, inexpressible\nfeelings of grateful affection.\n\nHow could his father know exactly what he would like--say the very\nthings he was thinking--see that his depression was not wilful\nrepining--find exactly what best soothed him! He wondered, but he\ncould not have said so to any one, only his eye brightened, and, as his\nsisters remarked, he never seemed half so uncomfortable when papa was\nin the room. Indeed, the certainty that his father felt the sorrow as\nacutely as himself, was one reason of his opening to him. He could not\nfeel that his brothers and sisters did so, for, outwardly, their habits\nwere unaltered, their spirits not lowered, their relish for things\naround much the same as before, and this had given Norman a sense of\nisolation. With his father it was different. Norman knew he could never\nappreciate what the bereavement was to him--he saw its traces in almost\nevery word and look, and yet perceived that something sustained and\nconsoled him, though not in the way of forgetfulness. Now and then\nNorman caught at what gave this comfort, and it might be hoped he would\ndo so increasingly; though, on this Christmas Day, Margaret felt very\nsad about him, as she watched him sitting over the fire, cowering with\nchilliness and headache, while every one was gone to church, and saw\nthat the reading of the service with her had been more of a trouble than\na solace.\n\nShe tried to think it bodily ailment, and strove hard not to pine for\nher mother, to comfort them both, and say the fond words of refreshing\ncheering pity that would have made all light to bear. Margaret’s home\nChristmas was so spent in caring for brother, father, and children,\nthat she had hardly time to dwell on the sad change that had befallen\nherself.\n\nChristmas was a season that none of them knew well how to meet: Blanche\nwas overheard saying to Mary that she wished it would not come, and\nMary, shaking her head, and answering that she was afraid that was\nnaughty, but it was very tiresome to have no fun. Margaret did her best\nupstairs, and Richard downstairs, by the help of prints and hymns, to\nmake the children think of the true joy of Christmas, and in the evening\ntheir father gathered them round, and told them the stories of the\nShepherds and of the Wise Men, till Mary and Blanche agreed, as they\nwent up to bed, that it had been a very happy evening.\n\nThe next day Harry discomfited the schoolroom by bursting in with the\nnews that “Louisa and Fanny Anderson were bearing down on the front\ndoor.” Ethel and Flora were obliged to appear in the drawing-room, where\nthey were greeted by two girls, rather older than themselves. A whole\nshower of inquiries for Dr. May, for Margaret, and for the dear little\nbaby, were first poured out; then came hopes that Norman was well, as\nthey had not seen him at church yesterday.\n\n“Thank you, he was kept at home by a bad headache, but it is better\nto-day.”\n\n“We came to congratulate you on his success--we could not help it--it\nmust have been such a pleasure to you.”\n\n“That it was!” exclaimed Ethel, pleased at participation in her\nrejoicing. “We were so surprised.”\n\nFlora gave a glance of warning, but Ethel’s short-sighted eyes were\nbeyond the range of correspondence, and Miss Anderson continued. “It\nmust have been a delightful surprise. We could hardly believe it when\nHarvey came in and told us. Every one thought Forder was sure, but they\nall were put out by the questions of general information--those were all\nMr. Everard’s doing.”\n\n“Mr. Everard was very much struck with Norman’s knowledge and\nscholarship too,” said Flora.\n\n“So every one says. It was all Mr. Everard’s doing. Miss Harrison told\nmamma, but, for my part, I am very glad for the sake of Stoneborough; I\nlike a town boy to be at the head.”\n\n“Norman was sorry for Forder and Cheviot,” began Ethel. Flora tried\nto stop her, but Louisa Anderson caught at what she said, and looked\neagerly for more. “He felt,” said she, only thinking of exalting her\ngenerous brother, “as if it was hardly right, when they are so much his\nseniors, that he could scarcely enjoy it.”\n\n“Ah! that is just what people say,” replied Louisa. “But it must be very\ngratifying to you, and it makes him certain of the Randal scholarship\ntoo, I suppose. It is a great thing for him! He must have worked very\nhard.”\n\n“Yes, that he has,” said Flora; “he is so fond of study, and that goes\nhalfway.”\n\n“So is dear Harvey. How earnest he is over his books! Mamma sometimes\nsays, ‘Now Harvey, dear, you’ll be quite stupified, you’ll be ill; I\nreally shall get Dr. May to forbid you.’ I suppose Norman is very busy\ntoo; it is quite the fashion for boys not to be idle now.”\n\n“Poor Norman can’t help it,” said Ethel piteously. “Papa will not hear\nof his doing any Latin or Greek these whole holidays.”\n\n“He thinks he will come to it better again for entire rest,” said Flora,\nlaunching another look at her sister, which again fell short.\n\nA great deal of polite inquiry whether they were uneasy about him\nfollowed, mixed with a little boasting of dear Harvey’s diligence.\n\n“By-the-bye, Ethel, it is you that are the great patroness of the wild\nCocksmoor children--are not you?”\n\nEthel coloured, and mumbled, and Flora answered for her, “Richard and\nEthel have been there once or twice. You know our under nursery-maid is\na Cocksmoor girl.”\n\n“Well, mamma said she could not think how Miss May could take one from\nthence. The whole place is full of thieves, and do you know, Bessie\nBoulder has lost her gold pencil-case.”\n\n“Has she?” said Flora.\n\n“And she had it on Sunday when she was teaching her class.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Ethel vehemently; “surely she does not suspect any of those\npoor children!”\n\n“I only know such a thing never happened at school before,” said Fanny,\n“and I shall never take anything valuable there again.”\n\n“But is she sure she lost it at school?”\n\n“Oh, yes, quite certain. She will not accuse any one, but it is not\ncomfortable. And how those children do behave at church!”\n\n“Poor things! they have been sadly neglected,” said Flora.\n\n“They are quite spoiling the rest, and they are such figures! Why don’t\nyou, at least, make them cut their hair? You know it is the rule of the\nschool.”\n\n“I know, but half the girls in the first class wear it long.”\n\n“Oh, yes, but those are the superior people, that one would not be\nstrict with, and they dress it so nicely too. Now these are like little\nsavages.”\n\n“Richard thinks it might drive them away to insist at first,” said\nEthel; “we will try to bring it about in time.”\n\n“Well, Mrs. Ledwich is nearly resolved to insist, so you had better be\nwarned, Ethel. She cannot suffer such untidiness and rags to spoil the\nappearance of the school, and, I assure you, it is quite unpleasant to\nthe teachers.”\n\n“I wish they would give them all to me!” said Ethel. “But I do hope Mrs.\nLedwich will have patience with them, for they are only to be gained\ngently.”\n\nThe visitors took their leave, and the two sisters began\nexclaiming--Ethel at their dislike of her proteges, and Flora at what\nthey had said of Norman. “And you, Ethel, how could you go and tell them\nwe were surprised, and Norman thought it was hard on the other boys?\nThey’ll have it all over the town that he got it unjustly, and knows it,\nas they say already it was partiality of Mr. Everard’s.”\n\n“Oh, no, no, they never can be so bad!” cried Ethel; “they must have\nunderstood better that it was his noble humility and generosity.”\n\n“They understand anything noble! No, indeed! They think every one like\ntheir own beautiful brother! I knew what they came for all the time;\nthey wanted to know whether Norman was able to work these holidays, and\nyou told them the very thing they wanted to hear. How they will rejoice\nwith that Harvey, and make sure of the Randall!”\n\n“Oh, no, no!” cried Ethel; “Norman must get that!”\n\n“I don’t think he will,” said Flora, “losing all this time, while they\nare working. It cannot be helped, of course, but it is a great pity.”\n\n“I almost wish he had not been put up at all, if it is to end in this\nway,” said Ethel. “It is very provoking, and to have them triumphing as\nthey will! There’s no bearing it!”\n\n“Norman, certainly, is not at all well, poor fellow,” said Flora, “and I\nsuppose he wants rest, but I wish papa would let him do what he can.\nIt would be much better for him than moping about as he is always doing\nnow; and the disappointment of losing his place will be grievous, though\nnow he fancies he does not care for it.”\n\n“I wonder when he will ever care for anything again. All I read and tell\nhim only seems to tease him, though he tries to thank me.”\n\n“There is a strange apathy about him,” said Flora, “but I believe it is\nchiefly for want of exertion. I should like to rouse him if papa would\nlet me; I know I could, by telling him how these Andersons are reckoning\non his getting down. If he does, I shall be ready to run away, that I\nmay never meet any one here again.”\n\nEthel was very unhappy till she was able to pour all this trouble out\nto Margaret, and worked herself almost into crying about Norman’s being\npassed by “that Harvey,” and his sisters exulting, and papa being vexed,\nand Norman losing time and not caring.\n\n“There you are wrong,” said Margaret, “Norman did care very much, and it\nwas not till he had seen clearly that it was a matter of duty to do\nas papa thought right, and not agitate his mind about his chances of\nkeeping up, that he could bear to give up his work;” and she told Ethel\na little of what had passed.\n\nEthel was much struck. “But oh, Margaret, it is very hard, just to have\nhim put up for the sake of being put down, and pleasing the Andersons!”\n\n“Dear Ethel, why should you mind so much about the Andersons? May they\nnot care about their brother as we do for ours?”\n\n“Such a brother to care about!” said Ethel.\n\n“But I suppose they may like him the best,” said Margaret, smiling.\n\n“I suppose they do,” said Ethel grudgingly; “but still I cannot bear to\nsee Norman doing nothing, and I know Harvey Anderson will beat him.”\n\n“Surely you had rather he did nothing than made himself ill!”\n\n“To be sure, but I wish it wasn’t so.”\n\n“Yes; but, Ethel, whose doing is his getting into this state?”\n\nEthel looked grave. “It was wrong of me,” said she, “but then papa is\nnot sure that Greek would hurt him.”\n\n“Not sure, but he thinks it not wise to run the risk. But, Ethel, dear,\nwhy are you so bent on his being dux at all costs?”\n\n“It would be horrid if he was not.”\n\n“Don’t you remember you used to say that outward praise or honour was\nnot to be cared for as long as one did one’s duty, and that it might be\na temptation?”\n\n“Yes, I know I did,” said Ethel, faltering, “but that was for oneself.”\n\n“It is harder, I think, to feel so about those we care for,” said\nMargaret; “but after all, this is just what will show whether our pride\nin Norman is the right true loving pride, or whether it is only the\nfamily vanity of triumphing over the Andersons.”\n\nEthel hung her head. “There’s some of that,” she said, “but it is not\nall. No--I don’t want to triumph over them, nobody would do that.”\n\n“Not outwardly perhaps, but in their hearts.”\n\n“I can’t tell,” said Ethel, “but it is the being triumphed over that I\ncannot bear.”\n\n“Perhaps this is all a lesson in humility for us,” said Margaret “It is\nteaching us, ‘Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that\nhumbleth himself shall be exalted.’”\n\nEthel was silent for some little space, then suddenly exclaimed, “And\nyou think he will really be put down?”\n\nMargaret seemed to have been talking with little effect, but she kept\nher patience, and answered, “I cannot guess, Ethel, but I’ll tell you\none thing--I think there’s much more chance if he comes to his work\nfresh and vigorous after a rest, than if he went on dulling himself with\nit all this time.”\n\nWith which Ethel was so far appeased that she promised to think as\nlittle as she could of the Andersons, and a walk with Richard to\nCocksmoor turned the current of her thoughts. They had caught some\nmore Sunday-school children by the help of Margaret’s broth, but it was\nuphill work; the servants did not like such guests in the kitchen, and\nthey were still less welcome at school.\n\n“What do you think I heard, Ethel?” said Flora, the next Sunday, as\nthey joined each other in the walk from school to church; “I heard Miss\nGraves say to Miss Boulder, ‘I declare I must remonstrate. I undertook\nto instruct a national, not a ragged school;’ and then Miss Boulder\nshook out her fine watered silk and said, ‘It positively is improper to\nplace ladies in contact with such squalid objects.’”\n\n“Ladies!” cried Ethel. “A stationer’s daughter and a banker’s clerk’s!\nWhy do they come to teach at school at all?”\n\n“Because our example makes it genteel,” said Flora.\n\n“I hope you did something more in hopes of making it genteel.”\n\n“I caught one of your ragged regiment with her frock gaping behind, and\npinned it up. Such rags as there were under it! Oh, Ethel!”\n\n“Which was it?”\n\n“That merry Irish-looking child. I don’t know her name.”\n\n“Oh! it is a real charming Irish name, Una M’Carthy. I am so glad you\ndid it, Flora. I hope they were ashamed.”\n\n“I doubt whether it will do good. We are sure of our station and can do\nanything--they are struggling to be ladies.”\n\n“But we ought not to talk of them any more, Flora; here we are almost at\nthe churchyard.”\n\nThe Tuesday of this week was appointed for the visit of the London\nsurgeon, Sir Matthew Fleet, and the expectation caused Dr. May to talk\nmuch to Margaret of old times, and the days of his courtship, when it\nhad been his favourite project that his friend and fellow-student should\nmarry Flora Mackenzie, and there had been a promising degree of liking,\nbut “Mat” had been obliged to be prudent, and had ended by never\nmarrying at all. This the doctor, as well as his daughters, believed was\nfor the sake of Aunt Flora, and thus the girls were a good deal excited\nabout his coming, almost as much on his own account, as because they\nconsidered him as the arbiter of Margaret’s fate. He only came in time\nfor a seven o’clock dinner, and Margaret did not see him that night, but\nheard enough from her sisters, when they came up to tell the history of\ntheir guest, and of the first set dinner when Flora had acted as lady\nof the house. The dinner it appeared had gone off very well. Flora\nhad managed admirably, and the only mishap was some awkward carving of\nEthel’s which had caused the dish to be changed with Norman. As to the\nguest, Flora said he was very good-looking and agreeable. Ethel abruptly\npronounced, “I am very glad Aunt Flora married Uncle Arnott instead.”\n\n“I can’t think why,” said Flora. “I never saw a person of pleasanter\nmanners.”\n\n“Did they talk of old times?” said Margaret.\n\n“No,” said Ethel; “that was the thing.”\n\n“You would not have them talk of those matters in the middle of dinner,”\n said Flora.\n\n“No,” again said Ethel; “but papa has a way--don’t you know, Margaret,\nhow one can tell in a moment if it is company talk.”\n\n“What was the conversation about?” said Margaret.\n\n“They talked over some of their fellow-students,” said Flora.\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel; “and then when papa told him that beautiful history\nof Dr. Spencer going to take care of those poor emigrants in the fever,\nwhat do you think he said? ‘Yes, Spencer was always doing extravagant\nthings.’ Fancy that to papa, who can hardly speak of it without having\nto wipe his spectacles, and who so longs to hear of Dr. Spencer.”\n\n“And what did he say?”\n\n“Nothing; so Flora and Sir Matthew got to pictures and all that sort of\nthing, and it was all company talk after that.”\n\n“Most entertaining in its kind,” said Flora: “but--oh, Norman!” as he\nentered--“why, they are not out of the dining-room yet!”\n\n“No; they are talking of some new invention, and most likely will not\ncome for an hour.”\n\n“Are you going to bed?”\n\n“Papa followed me out of the dining-room to tell me to do so after tea.”\n\n“Then sit down there, and I’ll go and make some, and let it come up\nwith Margaret’s. Come, Ethel. Good-night, Norman. Is your head aching\nto-night?”\n\n“Not much, now I have got out of the dining-room.”\n\n“It would have been wiser not to have gone in,” said Flora, leaving the\nroom.\n\n“It was not the dinner, but the man,” said Norman. “It is\nincomprehensible to me how my father could take to him. I’d as soon have\nHarvey Anderson for a friend!”\n\n“You are like me,” said Ethel, “in being glad he is not our uncle.”\n\n“He presume to think of falling in love with Aunt Flora!” cried Norman\nindignantly.\n\n“Why, what is the matter with him?” asked Margaret. “I can’t find much\nground for Ethel’s dislike, and Flora is pleased.”\n\n“She did not hear the worst, nor you either, Ethel,” said Norman. “I\ncould not stand the cold hard way he spoke of hospital patients. I am\nsure he thinks poor people nothing but a study, and rich ones nothing\nbut a profit. And his half sneers! But what I hated most was his way\nof avoiding discussions. When he saw he had said what would not go down\nwith papa, he did not honestly stand up to the point, and argue it out,\nbut seemed to have no mind of his own, and to be only talking to please\npapa--but not knowing how to do it. He understand my father indeed!”\n\nNorman’s indignation had quite revived him, and Margaret was much\nentertained with the conflicting opinions. The next was Richard’s, when\nhe came in late to wish her good-night, after he had been attending on\nSir Matthew’s examination of his father’s arm. He did nothing but admire\nthe surgeon’s delicacy of touch and understanding of the case, his view\nagreeing much better with Dr. May’s own than that with Mr. Ward’s.\nDr. May had never been entirely satisfied with the present mode of\ntreatment, and Richard was much struck by hearing him say, in answer to\nSir Matthew, that he knew his recovery might have been more speedy and\nless painful if he had been able to attend to it at first, or to afford\ntime for being longer laid up. A change of treatment was now to be made,\nlikely soon to relieve the pain, to be less tedious and troublesome,\nand to bring about a complete cure in three or four months at latest.\nIn hearing such tidings, there could be little thought of the person\nwho brought them, and Margaret did not, till the last moment, learn that\nRichard thought Sir Matthew very clever and sensible, and certain to\nunderstand her case. Her last visitor was her father: “Asleep, Margaret?\nI thought I had better go to Norman first in case he should be awake.”\n\n“Was he?”\n\n“Yes, but his pulse is better to-night. He was lying awake to hear what\nFleet thought of me. I suppose Richard told you?”\n\n“Yes, dear papa; what a comfort it is!”\n\n“Those fellows in London do keep up to the mark! But I would not be\nthere for something. I never saw a man so altered. However, if he can\nonly do for you as well--but it is of no use talking about it. I may\ntrust you to keep yourself calm, my dear?”\n\n“I am trying--indeed I am, dear papa. If you could help being anxious\nfor me--though I know it is worse for you, for I only have to lie still,\nand you have to settle for me. But I have been thinking how well off I\nam, able to enjoy so much, and be employed all day long. It is nothing\nto compare with that poor girl you told me of, and you need not be\nunhappy for me. I have some verses to say over to myself to-night:\n\n\n        “O Lord my God, do Thou Thy holy will,\n                I will lie still,\n        I will not stir, lest I forsake Thine arm\n                And break the charm\n        That lulls me, clinging to my Father’s breast\n                In perfect rest.”\n\n\n“Is not that comfortable?”\n\n“My child--my dear child--I will say no more, lest I should break your\nsweet peace with my impatience. I will strive for the same temper, my\nMargaret. Bless you, dearest, good-night.”\n\nAfter a night spent in waking intervals of such thoughts, Margaret\nfound the ordinary morning, and the talk she could not escape, somewhat\noppressive. Her brothers and sisters disturbed her by their open\nexpressions of hope and anxiety; she dreaded to have the balance of\ntranquillity overset; and then blamed herself for selfishness in not\nbeing as ready to attend to them as usual. Ethel and Norman came\nup after breakfast, their aversion by no means decreased by further\nacquaintance. Ethel was highly indignant at the tone in which he had\nexclaimed, “What, May, have you one as young as this?” on discovering\nthe existence of the baby; and when Norman observed that was not so\natrocious either, she proceeded, “You did not hear the contemptuous,\ncompassionate tone when he asked papa what he meant to do with all these\nboys.”\n\n“I’m glad he has not to settle,” said Norman.\n\n“Papa said Harry was to be a sailor, and he said it was a good way to\nsave expenses of education--a good thing.”\n\n“No doubt,” said Norman, “he thinks papa only wants to get rid of us, or\nif not, that it is an amiable weakness.”\n\n“But I can’t see anything so shocking in this,” said Margaret.\n\n“It is not the words,” said Norman, “the look and tone convey it; but\nthere are different opinions. Flora is quite smitten with him, he talks\nso politely to her.”\n\n“And Blanche!” said Ethel. “The little affected pussy-cat made a set\nat him, bridled and talked in her mincing voice, with all her airs, and\nmade him take a great deal of notice of her.”\n\nNurse here came to prepare for the surgeon’s visit.\n\nIt was over, and Margaret awaited the judgment. Sir Matthew had spoken\nhopefully to her, but she feared to fasten hopes on what might have no\nmeaning, and could rely on nothing, till she had seen her father, who\nnever kept back his genuine opinion, and would least of all from her. She\nfound her spirits too much agitated to talk to her sisters, and quietly\nbegged them to let her be quite alone till the consultation was over,\nand she lay trying to prepare herself to submit thankfully, whether she\nmight be bidden to resign herself to helplessness, or to let her mind\nopen once more to visions of joyous usefulness. Every step she hoped\nwould prove to be her father’s approach, and the longest hour of her\nlife was that before he entered her room. His face said that the tidings\nwere good, and yet she could not ask.\n\n“Well, Margaret, I am glad we had him down. He thinks you may get about\nagain, though it may be a long time first.”\n\n“Does he?--oh, papa!” and the colour spread over her face, as she\nsqueezed his hand very fast.\n\n“He has known the use of the limbs return almost suddenly after even a\nyear or two,” and Dr. May gave her the grounds of the opinion, and an\naccount of other like cases, which he said had convinced him, “though,\nmy poor child,” he said, “I feared the harm I had done you was\nirremediable, but thanks--” He turned away his face, and the clasp of\ntheir hands spoke the rest.\n\nPresently he told Margaret that she was no longer to be kept prostrate,\nbut she was to do exactly as was most comfortable to her, avoiding\nnothing but fatigue. She might be lifted to the sofa the next day, and\nif that agreed with her, she might be carried downstairs.\n\nThis, in itself, after she had been confined to her bed for three\nmonths, was a release from captivity, and all the brothers and sisters\nrejoiced as if she was actually on her feet again. Richard betook\nhimself to constructing a reading-frame for the sofa; Harry tormented\nMiss Winter by insisting on a holiday for the others, and gained the\nday by an appeal to his father; then declared he should go and tell Mr.\nWilmot the good news; and Norman, quite enlivened, took up his hat, and\nsaid he would come too.\n\nIn all his joy, however, Dr. May could not cease bewailing the\nalteration in his old friend, and spent half the evening in telling\nMargaret how different he had once been, in terms little less measured\nthan Ethel’s: “I never saw such a change. Mat Fleet was one of the most\nwarm, open-hearted fellows in the world, up to anything. I can hardly\nbelieve he is the same--turned into a mere machine, with a moving spring\nof self-interest! I don’t believe he cares a rush for any living thing!\nExcept for your sake, Margaret, I wish I had never seen him again, and\nonly remembered him as he was at Edinburgh, as I remembered dear old\nSpencer. It is a grievous thing! Ruined entirely! No doubt that London\nlife must be trying--the constant change and bewilderment of patients\npreventing much individual care and interest. It must be very hardening.\nNo family ties either, nothing to look to but pushing his way. Yes!\nthere’s great excuse for poor Mat. I never knew fully till now the\nblessing it was that your dear mother was willing to take me so early,\nand that this place was open to me with all its home connections and\ninterests. I am glad I never had anything to do with London!”\n\nAnd when he was alone with Norman, he could not help saying, “Norman,\nmy boy, I’m more glad than ever you yielded to me about your Greek these\nholidays, and for the reason you did. Take care the love of rising and\npushing never gets hold of you; there’s nothing that faster changes a\nman from his better self.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Matthew Fleet had met another old college friend in\nLondon, and was answering his inquiries for the Dick May of ancient\ntimes.\n\n“Poor May! I never saw a man so thrown away. With his talent and\nacuteness, he might be the most eminent man of his day, if he had only\nknown how to use them. But he was always the same careless, soft-hearted\nfellow, never knowing how to do himself any good, and he is the same\nstill, not a day older nor wiser. It was a fatal thing for him that\nthere was that country practice ready for him to step into, and even of\nthat he does not make as good a thing as he might. Of course, he\nmarried early, and there he is, left a widower with a house full of\nchildren--screaming babies, and great tall sons growing up, and he\nwithout a notion what he shall do with them, as heedless as ever--saving\nnothing, of course. I always knew it was what he would come to, if he\nwould persist in burying himself in that wretched little country town,\nbut I hardly thought, after all he has gone through, to find him such a\nmere boy still. And yet he is one of the cleverest men I ever met--with\nsuch talent, and such thorough knowledge of his profession, that it does\none good to hear him talk. Poor May! I am sorry for him, he might have\nbeen anything, but that early marriage and country practice were the\nruin of him.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n\n     To thee, dear maid, each kindly wile\n       Was known, that elder sisters know,\n     To check the unseasonable smile,\n       With warning hand and serious brow.\n\n     From dream to dream with her to rove,\n       Like fairy nurse with hermit child;\n     Teach her to think, to pray, to love,\n       Make grief less bitter, joy less wild.\n                          LINES ON A MONUMENT AT LICHFIELD.\n\n\nSir Matthew Fleet’s visit seemed like a turning-point with the May\nfamily, rousing and giving them revived hopes. Norman began to shake off\nhis extreme languor and depression, the doctor was relieved from much\nof the wearing suffering from his hurt, and his despondency as to\nMargaret’s ultimate recovery had been driven away. The experiment of\ntaking her up succeeded so well, that on Sunday she was fully attired,\n“fit to receive company.” As she lay on the sofa there seemed an advance\ntoward recovery. Much sweet coquetry was expended in trying to look\nher best for her father; and her best was very well, for though the\nbrilliant bloom of health was gone, her cheeks had not lost their pretty\nrounded contour, and still had some rosiness, while her large bright\nblue eyes smiled and sparkled. A screen shut out the rest of the room,\nmaking a sort of little parlour round the fire, where sundry of the\nfamily were visiting her after coming home from church in the afternoon.\nEthel was in a vehement state of indignation at what had that day\nhappened at school. “Did you ever hear anything like it! When the point\nwas, to teach the poor things to be Christians, to turn them back,\nbecause their hair was not regulation length!”\n\n“What’s that! Who did?” said Dr. May, coming in from his own room, where\nhe had heard a few words.\n\n“Mrs. Ledwich. She sent back three of the Cocksmoor children this\nmorning. It seems she warned them last Sunday without saying a word to\nus.”\n\n“Sent them back from church!” said the doctor.\n\n“Not exactly from church,” said Margaret.\n\n“It is the same in effect,” said Ethel, “to turn them from school; for\nif they did try to go alone, the pew-openers would drive them out.”\n\n“It is a wretched state of things!” said Dr. May, who never wanted\nmuch provocation to begin storming about parish affairs. “When I am\nchurchwarden again, I’ll see what can be done about the seats; but it’s\nno sort of use, while Ramsden goes on as he does.”\n\n“Now my poor children are done for!” said Ethel. “They will never come\nagain. And it’s horrid, papa; there are lots of town children who wear\nimmense long plaits of hair, and Mrs. Ledwich never interferes with\nthem. It is entirely to drive the poor Cocksmoor ones away--for nothing\nelse, and all out of Fanny Anderson’s chatter.”\n\n“Ethel, my dear,” said Margaret pleadingly.\n\n“Didn’t I tell you, Margaret, how, as soon as Flora knew what Mrs.\nLedwich was going to do, she went and told her this was the children’s\nonly chance, and if we affronted them for a trifle, there would be no\nhope of getting them back. She said she was sorry, if we were interested\nfor them, but rules must not be broken; and when Flora spoke of all who\ndo wear long hair unmolested, she shuffled and said, for the sake of\nthe teachers, as well as the other children, rags and dirt could not be\nallowed; and then she brought up the old story of Miss Boulder’s pencil,\nthough she has found it again, and ended by saying Fanny Anderson told\nher it was a serious annoyance to the teachers, and she was sure we\nshould agree with her, that something was due to voluntary assistants\nand subscribers.”\n\n“I am afraid there has been a regular set at them,” said Margaret, “and\nperhaps they are troublesome, poor things.”\n\n“As if school-keeping were for luxury!” said Dr. May. “It is the worst\nthing I have heard of Mrs. Ledwich yet! One’s blood boils to think of\nthose poor children being cast off because our fine young ladies are\ntoo grand to teach them! The clergyman leaving his work to a set of\nconceited women, and they turning their backs on ignorance, when it\ncomes to their door! Voluntary subscribers, indeed! I’ve a great mind\nI’ll be one no longer.”\n\n“Oh, papa, that would not be fair--” began Ethel; but Margaret knew he\nwould not act on this, squeezed her hand, and silenced her.\n\n“One thing I’ve said, and I’ll hold to it,” continued Dr. May; “if they\noutvote Wilmot again in your Ladies’ Committee, I’ll have no more to do\nwith them, as sure as my name’s Dick May. It is a scandal the way things\nare done here!”\n\n“Papa,” said Richard, who had all the time been standing silent, “Ethel\nand I have been thinking, if you approved, whether we could not do\nsomething towards teaching the Cocksmoor children, and breaking them in\nfor the Sunday-school.”\n\nWhat a bound Ethel’s heart gave, and how full of congratulation and\nsympathy was the pressure of Margaret’s hand!\n\n“What did you think of doing?” said the doctor. Ethel burned to reply,\nbut her sister’s hand admonished her to remember her compact. Richard\nanswered, “We thought of trying to get a room, and going perhaps once or\ntwice a week to give them a little teaching. It would be little enough,\nbut it might do something towards civilising them, and making them wish\nfor more.”\n\n“How do you propose to get a room?”\n\n“I have reconnoitred, and I think I know a cottage with a tolerable\nkitchen, which I dare say we might hire for an afternoon for sixpence.”\n\nEthel, unable to bear it any longer, threw herself forward, and sitting\non the ground at her father’s feet, exclaimed, “Oh, papa! papa! do say\nwe may!”\n\n“What’s all this about?” said the doctor, surprised.\n\n“Oh! you don’t know how I have thought of it day and night these two\nmonths!”\n\n“What! Ethel, have a fancy for two whole months, and the whole house\nnot hear of it!” said her father, with a rather provoking look of\nincredulity.\n\n“Richard was afraid of bothering you, and wouldn’t let me. But do speak,\npapa. May we?”\n\n“I don’t see any objection.”\n\nShe clasped her hands in ecstasy. “Thank you! thank you, papa! Oh,\nRitchie! Oh, Margaret!” cried she, in a breathless voice of transport.\n\n“You have worked yourself up to a fine pass,” said the doctor, patting\nthe agitated girl fondly as she leaned against his knee. “Remember, slow\nand steady.”\n\n“I’ve got Richard to help me,” said Ethel.\n\n“Sufficient guarantee,” said her father, smiling archly as he looked up\nto his son, whose fair face had coloured deep red. “You will keep the\nUnready in order, Ritchie.”\n\n“He does,” said Margaret; “he has taken her education into his hands,\nand I really believe he has taught her to hold up her frock and stick in\npins.”\n\n“And to know her right hand from her left, eh, Ethel? Well, you deserve\nsome credit, then. Suppose we ask Mr. Wilmot to tea, and talk it over.”\n\n“Oh, thank you, papa! When shall it be? To-morrow?”\n\n“Yes, if you like. I have to go to the town-council meeting, and am not\ngoing into the country, so I shall be in early.”\n\n“Thank you. Oh, how very nice!”\n\n“And what about cost? Do you expect to rob me?”\n\n“If you would help us,” said Ethel, with an odd shy manner; “we meant\nto make what we have go as far as may be, but mine is only fifteen and\nsixpence.”\n\n“Well, you must make interest with Margaret for the turn-out of my\npocket to-morrow.”\n\n“Thank you, we are very much obliged,” said the brother and sister\nearnestly, “that is more than we expected.”\n\n“Ha! don’t thank too soon. Suppose to-morrow should be a blank day!”\n\n“Oh, it won’t!” said Ethel. “I shall tell Norman to make you go to\npaying people.”\n\n“There’s avarice!” said the doctor. “But look you here, Ethel, if you’ll\ntake my advice, you’ll make your bargain for Tuesday. I have a note\nappointing me to call at Abbotstoke Grange on Mr. Rivers, at twelve\no’clock, on Tuesday. What do you think of that, Ethel? An old banker,\nrich enough for his daughter to curl her hair in bank-notes. If I were\nyou, I’d make a bargain for him.”\n\n“If he had nothing the matter with him, and I only got one guinea out of\nhim!”\n\n“Prudence! Well, it may be wiser.”\n\nEthel ran up to her room, hardly able to believe that the mighty\nproposal was made; and it had been so readily granted, that it seemed\nas if Richard’s caution had been vain in making such a delay, that even\nMargaret had begun to fear that the street of by-and-by was leading to\nthe house of never. Now, however, it was plain that he had been wise.\nOpportunity was everything; at another moment, their father might have\nbeen harassed and oppressed, and unable to give his mind to concerns,\nwhich now he could think of with interest, and Richard could not have\ncaught a more favourable conjuncture.\n\nEthel was in a wild state of felicity all that evening and the next day,\nvery unlike her brother, who, dismayed at the open step he had taken,\nshrank into himself, and in his shyness dreaded the discussion in the\nevening, and would almost have been relieved, if Mr. Wilmot had been\nunable to accept the invitation. So quiet and grave was he, that Ethel\ncould not get him to talk over the matter at all with her, and she was\nobliged to bestow all her transports and grand projects on Flora or\nMargaret, when she could gain their ears, besides conning them over to\nherself, as an accompaniment to her lessons, by which means she tried\nMiss Winter’s patience almost beyond measure. But she cared not--she\nsaw a gathering school and rising church, which eclipsed all thought\nof present inattentions and gaucheries. She monopolised Margaret in the\ntwilight, and rhapsodised to her heart’s content, talking faster and\nfaster, and looking more and more excited. Margaret began to feel\na little overwhelmed, and while answering “yes” at intervals, was\nconsidering whether Ethel had not been flying about in an absent\ninconsiderate mood all day, and whether it would seem unkind to damp\nher ardour, by giving her a hint that she was relaxing her guard over\nherself. Before Margaret had steeled herself, Ethel was talking of a\nstory she had read, of a place something like Cocksmoor. Margaret was\nnot ready with her recollection, and Ethel, saying it was in a magazine\nin the drawing-room chiffonier, declared she would fetch it.\n\nMargaret knew what it was to expect her visitors to return “in one\nmoment,” and with a “now-or-never” feeling she began, “Ethel, dear,\nwait,” but Ethel was too impetuous to attend. “I’ll be back in a\ntwinkling,” she called out, and down she flew, in her speed whisking\naway, without seeing it, the basket with Margaret’s knitting and all\nher notes and papers, which lay scattered on the floor far out of\nreach, vexing Margaret at first, and then making her grieve at her own\nimpatient feeling.\n\nEthel was soon in the drawing-room, but the right number of the magazine\nwas not quickly forthcoming, and in searching she became embarked in\nanother story. Just then, Aubrey, whose stout legs were apt to carry him\ninto every part of the house where he was neither expected nor wanted,\nmarched in at the open door, trying by dint of vehement gestures to make\nher understand, in his imperfect speech, something that he wanted. Very\nparticularly troublesome she thought him, more especially as she could\nnot make him out, otherwise than that he wanted her to do something\nwith the newspaper and the fire. She made a boat for him with an old\nnewspaper, a very hasty and frail performance, and told him to sail it\non the carpet, and be Mr. Ernescliffe going away; and she thought him\nthus safely disposed of. Returning to her book and her search, with her\nface to the cupboard, and her book held up to catch the light, she was\nsoon lost in her story, and thought of nothing more till suddenly roused\nby her father’s voice in the hall, loud and peremptory with alarm,\n“Aubrey! put that down!” She looked, and beheld Aubrey brandishing a\ngreat flaming paper--he dropped it at the exclamation--it fell burning\non the carpet. Aubrey’s white pinafore! Ethel was springing up, but in\nher cramped, twisted position she could not do so quickly, and even as\nhe called, her father strode by her, snatched at Aubrey’s merino frock,\nwhich he crushed over the scarcely lighted pinafore, and trampled out\nthe flaming paper with his foot. It was a moment of dreadful fright, but\nthe next assured them that no harm was done.\n\n“Ethel!” cried the doctor, “Are you mad? What were you thinking of?”\n\nAubrey, here recollecting himself enough to be frightened at his\nfather’s voice and manner, burst into loud cries; the doctor pressed him\ncloser on his breast, caressed and soothed him. Ethel stood by, pale and\ntransfixed with horror. Her father was more angry with her than she\nhad ever seen him, and with reason, as she knew, as she smelled the\nsingeing, and saw a large burnt hole in Aubrey’s pinafore, while the\nfront of his frock was scorched and brown. Dr. May’s words were not\nneeded, “What could make you let him?”\n\n“I didn’t see--” she faltered.\n\n“Didn’t see! Didn’t look, didn’t think, didn’t care! That’s it, Ethel.\n‘Tis very hard one can’t trust you in a room with the child any more\nthan the baby himself. His frock perfect tinder! He would have been\nburned to a cinder, if I had not come in!”\n\n\nAubrey roared afresh, and Dr. May, kissing and comforting him, gathered\nhim up in his left arm, and carried him away, looking back at the door\nto say, “There’s no bearing it! I’ll put a stop to all schools and\nGreek, if it is to lead to this, and make you good for nothing!”\n\nEthel was too much terrified to know where she was, or anything,\nbut that she had let her little brother run into fearful peril, and\ngrievously angered her father; she was afraid to follow him, and stood\nstill, annihilated, and in despair, till roused by his return; then,\nwith a stifled sob, she exclaimed, “Oh, papa!” and could get no further\nfor a gush of tears.\n\nBut the anger of the shock of terror was over, and Dr. May was sorry\nfor her tears, though still he could not but manifest some displeasure.\n“Yes, Ethel,” he said, “it was a frightful thing,” and he could not\nbut shudder again. “One moment later! It is an escape to be for ever\nthankful for--poor little fellow!--but, Ethel, Ethel, do let it be a\nwarning to you.”\n\n“Oh, I hope--I’ll try--” sobbed Ethel.\n\n“You have said you would try before.”\n\n“I know I have,” said Ethel, choked. “If I could but--”\n\n“Poor child,” said Dr. May sadly; then looking earnestly at her, “Ethel,\nmy dear, I am afraid of its being with you as--as it has been with me;”\n he spoke very low, and drew her close to him. “I grew up, thinking\nmy inbred heedlessness a sort of grace, so to say, rather manly--the\nreverse of finikin. I was spoiled as a boy, and my Maggie carried on the\nspoiling, by never letting me feel its effects. By the time I had sense\nenough to regret this as a fault, I had grown too old for changing of\ningrain, long-nurtured habits--perhaps I never wished it really. You\nhave seen,” and his voice was nearly inaudible, “what my carelessness\nhas come to--let that suffice at least, as a lesson that may spare\nyou--what your father must feel as long as he lives.”\n\nHe pressed his hand tightly on her shoulder, and left her, without\nletting her see his face. Shocked and bewildered, she hurried upstairs\nto Margaret. She threw herself on her knees, felt her arms round\nher, and heard her kind soothing, and then, in broken words, told how\ndreadful it had been, and how kind papa had been, and what he had said,\nwhich was now the uppermost thought. “Oh, Margaret, Margaret, how very\nterrible it is! And does papa really think so?”\n\n“I believe he does,” whispered Margaret.\n\n“How can he, can he bear it!” said Ethel, clasping her hands. “Oh! it is\nenough to kill one--I can’t think why it did not!”\n\n“He bears it,” said Margaret, “because he is so very good, that help and\ncomfort do come to him. Dear papa! He bears up because it is right, and\nfor our sakes, and he has a sort of rest in that perfect love they had\nfor each other. He knows how she would wish him to cheer up and look to\nthe end, and support and comfort are given to him, I know they are; but\noh, Ethel! it does make one tremble and shrink, to think what he has\nbeen going through this autumn, especially when I hear him moving\nabout late at night, and now and then comes a heavy groan--whenever any\nespecial care has been on his mind.”\n\nEthel was in great distress. “To have grieved him again!” said she, “and\njust as he seemed better and brighter! Everything I do turns out wrong,\nand always will; I can’t do anything well by any chance.”\n\n“Yes you can, when you mind what you are about.”\n\n“But I never can--I’m like him, every one says so, and he says the\nheedlessness is ingrain, and can’t be got rid of.”\n\n“Ethel, I don’t really think he could have told you so.”\n\n“I’m sure he said ingrain.”\n\n“Well, I suppose it is part of his nature, and that you have inherited\nit, but--” Margaret paused, and Ethel exclaimed:\n\n“He said his was long-nurtured; yes, Margaret, you guessed right, and he\nsaid he could not change it, and no more can I.”\n\n“Surely, Ethel, you have not had so many years. You are fifteen instead\nof forty-six, and it is more a woman’s work than a man’s to be careful.\nYou need not begin to despair. You were growing much better; Richard\nsaid so, and so did Miss Winter.”\n\n“What’s the use of it, if in one moment it is as bad as ever? And\nto-day, of all days in the year, just when papa had been so very, very\nkind, and given me more than I asked.”\n\n“Do you know, Ethel, I was thinking whether dear mamma would not say\nthat was the reason. You were so happy, that perhaps you were thrown off\nyour guard.”\n\n“I should not wonder if that was it,” said Ethel thoughtfully. “You know\nit was a sort of probation that Richard put me on. I was to learn to be\nsteady before he spoke to papa, and now it seemed to be all settled and\nright, and perhaps I forgot I was to be careful still.”\n\n“I think it was something of the kind. I was a little afraid before, and\nI wish I had tried to caution you, but I did not like to seem unkind.”\n\n“I wish you had,” said Ethel. “Dear little Aubrey! Oh, if papa had not\nbeen there! And I cannot think how, as it was, he could contrive to put\nthe fire out, with his one hand, and not hurt himself. Margaret it was\nterrible. How could I mind so little! Did you see how his frock was\nsinged?”\n\n“Yes, papa showed it to me. How can we be thankful enough! One thing I\nhope, that Aubrey was well frightened, poor little boy.”\n\n“I know! I see now!” cried Ethel; “he must have wanted me to make the\nfire blaze up, as Richard did one evening when we came in and found it\nlow; I remember Aubrey clapping his hands and shouting at the flame;\nbut my head was in that unhappy story, and I never had sense to put the\nthings together, and reflect that he would try to do it himself. I only\nwanted to get him out of my way, dear little fellow. Oh, dear, how bad\nit was of me! All from being uplifted, and my head turned, as it used to\nbe when we were happier. Oh! I wish Mr. Wilmot was not coming!”\n\nEthel sat for a long time with her head hidden in Margaret’s pillows,\nand her hand clasped by her good elder sister. At last she looked up and\nsaid, “Oh, Margaret, I am so unhappy. I see the whole meaning of it now.\nDo you not? When papa gave his consent at last, I was pleased and set\nup, and proud of my plans. I never recollected what a silly, foolish\ngirl I am, and how unfit. I thought Mr. Wilmot would think great things\nof it--it was all wrong and self-satisfied. I never prayed at all that\nit might turn out well, and so now it won’t.”\n\n“Dearest Ethel, I don’t see that. Perhaps it will do all the better for\nyour being humbled about it now. If you were wild and high flying, it\nwould never go right.”\n\n“Its hope is in Richard,” said Ethel.\n\n“So it is,” said Margaret.\n\n“I wish Mr. Wilmot was not coming to-night,” said Ethel again. “It would\nserve me right if papa were to say nothing about it.”\n\nEthel lingered with her sister till Harry and Mary came up with\nMargaret’s tea, and summoned her, and she crept downstairs, and entered\nthe room so quietly, that she was hardly perceived behind her boisterous\nbrother. She knew her eyes were in no presentable state, and cast them\ndown, and shrank back as Mr. Wilmot shook her hand and greeted her\nkindly.\n\nMr. Wilmot had been wont to come to tea whenever he had anything to say\nto Dr. or Mrs. May, which was about once in ten or twelve days. He was\nMary’s godfather, and their most intimate friend in the town, and he\nhad often been with them, both as friend and clergyman, through their\ntrouble--no later than Christmas Day, he had come to bring the feast of\nthat day to Margaret in her sick-room. Indeed, it had been chiefly\nfor the sake of the Mays that he had resolved to spend the holidays\nat Stoneborough, taking the care of Abbotstoke, while his brother, the\nvicar, went to visit their father. This was, however, the first time\nhe had come in his old familiar way to spend an evening, and there was\nsomething in the resumption of former habits that painfully marked the\nchange.\n\nEthel, on coming in, found Flora making tea, her father leaning back\nin his great chair in silence, Richard diligently cutting bread,\nand Blanche sitting on Mr. Wilmot’s knee, chattering fast and\nconfidentially. Flora made Harry dispense the cups, and called every one\nto their places; Ethel timidly glanced at her father’s face, as he rose\nand came into the light. She thought the lines and hollows were more\nmarked than ever, and that he looked fatigued and mournful, and she\nfelt cut to the heart; but he began to exert himself, and to make\nconversation, not, however, about Cocksmoor, but asking Mr. Wilmot what\nhis brother thought of his new squire, Mr. Rivers.\n\n“He likes him very much,” said Mr. Wilmot. “He is a very pleasing\nperson, particularly kind-hearted and gentle, and likely to do a great\ndeal for the parish. They have been giving away beef and blankets at a\ngreat rate this Christmas.”\n\n“What family is there?” asked Flora.\n\n“One daughter, about Ethel’s age, is there with her governess. He\nhas been twice married, and the first wife left a son, who is in the\nDragoons, I believe. This girl’s mother was Lord Cosham’s daughter.”\n\nSo the talk lingered on, without much interest or life. It was rather\nkeeping from saying nothing than conversation, and no one was without\nthe sensation that she was missing, round whom all had been free and\njoyous--not that she had been wont to speak much herself, but nothing\nwould go on smoothly or easily without her. So long did this last, that\nEthel began to think her father meant to punish her by not beginning the\nsubject that night, and though she owned that she deserved it, she could\nnot help being very much disappointed.\n\nAt length, however, her father began: “We wanted you to talk over a\nscheme that these young ones have been concocting. You see, I am obliged\nto keep Richard at home this next term--it won’t do to have no one in\nthe house to carry poor Margaret. We can’t do without him anyway, so\nhe and Ethel have a scheme of seeing what can be done for that wretched\nplace, Cocksmoor.”\n\n“Indeed!” said Mr. Wilmot, brightening and looking interested. “It is\nsadly destitute. It would be a great thing if anything could be done\nfor it. You have brought some children to school already, I think. I saw\nsome rough-looking boys, who said they came from Cocksmoor.”\n\nThis embarked the doctor in the history of the ladies being too fine to\nteach the poor Cocksmoor girls, which he told with kindling vehemence\nand indignation, growing more animated every moment, as he stormed over\nthe wonted subject of the bad system of management--ladies’ committee,\nnegligent incumbent, insufficient clergy, misappropriated tithes--while\nMr. Wilmot, who had mourned over it, within himself, a hundred times\nalready, and was doing a curate’s work on sufferance, with no pay, and\nlittle but mistrust from Mr. Ramsden, and absurd false reports among the\nmore foolish part of the town, sat listening patiently, glad to hear\nthe doctor in his old strain, though it was a hopeless matter for\ndiscussion, and Ethel dreaded that the lamentation would go on till\nbedtime, and Cocksmoor be quite forgotten.\n\nAfter a time they came safely back to the project, and Richard was\ncalled on to explain. Ethel left it all to him, and he with rising\ncolour, and quiet, unhesitating, though diffident manner, detailed\ndesigns that showed themselves to have been well matured. Mr. Wilmot\nheard, cordially approved, and, as all agreed that no time was to be\nlost, while the holidays lasted, he undertook to speak to Mr. Ramsden on\nthe subject the next morning, and if his consent to their schemes could\nbe gained, to come in the afternoon to walk with Richard and Ethel to\nCocksmoor, and set their affairs in order. All the time Ethel said not\na word, except when referred to by her brother; but when Mr. Wilmot took\nleave, he shook her hand warmly, as if he was much pleased with her.\n“Ah!” she thought, “if he knew how ill I have behaved! It is all show\nand hollowness with me.”\n\nShe did not know that Mr. Wilmot thought her silence one of the best\nsigns for the plan, nor how much more doubtful he would have thought her\nperseverance, if he had seen her wild and vehement. As it was, he was\nvery much pleased, and when the doctor came out with him into the hall,\nhe could not help expressing his satisfaction in Richard’s well-judged\nand sensibly-described project.\n\n“Ay, ay!” said the doctor, “there’s much more in the boy than I used\nto think. He’s a capital fellow, and more like his mother than any of\nthem.”\n\n“He is,” said Mr. Wilmot; “there was a just, well-weighed sense and\nsoberness in his plans that put me in mind of her every moment.”\n\nDr. May gave his hand a squeeze, full of feeling, and went up to tell\nMargaret. She, on the first opportunity, told Richard, and made him\nhappier than he had been for months, not so much in Mr. Wilmot’s words,\nas in his father’s assent to, and pleasure in them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\n\n     Pitch thy behaviour low, thy projects high,\n       So shalt thou humble and magnanimous be;\n     Sink not in spirit; who aimeth at the sky\n       Shoots higher much than he that means a tree.\n         A grain of glory mixed with humbleness,\n         Cures both a fever and lethargicness.\n                                             HERBERT.\n\n\n“Norman, do you feel up to a long day’s work?” said Dr. May, on the\nfollowing morning. “I have to set off after breakfast to see old Mrs.\nGould, and to be at Abbotstoke Grange by twelve; then I thought of going\nto Fordholm, and getting Miss Cleveland to give us some luncheon--there\nare some poor people on the way to look at; and that girl on Far-view\nHill; and there’s another place to call in at coming home. You’ll have a\ngood deal of sitting in the carriage, holding Whitefoot, so if you think\nyou shall be cold or tired, don’t scruple to say so, and I’ll take Adams\nto drive me.”\n\n“No, thank you,” said Norman briskly. “This frost is famous.”\n\n“It will turn to rain, I expect--it is too white,” said the doctor,\nlooking out at the window. “How will you get to Cocksmoor, good people?”\n\n“Ethel won’t believe it rains unless it is very bad,” said Richard.\n\nNorman set out with his father, and prosperously performed the\nexpedition, arriving at Abbotstoke Grange at the appointed hour.\n\n“Ha!” said the doctor, as the iron gates of ornamental scrollwork were\nswung back, “there’s a considerable change in this place since I was\nhere last. Well kept up indeed! Not a dead leaf left under the old\nwalnuts, and the grass looks as smooth as if they had a dozen gardeners\nrolling it every day.”\n\n“And the drive,” said Norman, “more like a garden walk than a road! But\noh! what a splendid cedar!”\n\n“Isn’t it! I remember that as long as I remember anything. All this\nfine rolling of turf, and trimming up of the place, does not make much\ndifference to you, old fellow, does it? You don’t look altered since I\nsaw you last, when old Jervis was letting the place go to rack and ruin.\nSo they have a new entrance--very handsome conservatory--flowers--the\nbanker does things in style. There,” as Norman helped him off with his\nplaid, “wrap yourself up well, don’t get cold. The sun is gone in, and I\nshould not wonder if the rain were coming after all. I’ll not be longer\nthan I can help.”\n\nDr. May disappeared from his son’s sight through the conservatory,\nwhere, through the plate-glass, the exotics looked so fresh and perfumy,\nthat Norman almost fancied that the scent reached him. “How much poor\nMargaret would enjoy one of those camellias,” thought he, “and these\npeople have bushels of them for mere show. If I were papa, I should be\ntempted to be like Beauty’s father, and carry off one. How she would\nadmire it!”\n\nNorman had plenty of time to meditate on the camellias, and then to\nturn and speculate on the age of the cedar, whether it could have been\nplanted by the monks of Stoneborough Abbey, to whom the Grange had\nbelonged, brought from Lebanon by a pilgrim, perhaps; and then he tried\nto guess at the longevity of cedars, and thought of asking Margaret, the\nbotanist of the family. Then he yawned, moved the horse a little\nabout, opined that Mr. Rivers must be very prosy, or have some abstruse\ncomplaint, considered the sky, and augured rain, buttoned another button\nof his rough coat, and thought of Miss Cleveland’s dinner. Then he\nthought there was a very sharp wind, and drove about till he found a\nsheltered place on the lee side of the great cedar, looked up at it, and\nthought it would be a fine subject for verses, if Mr. Wilmot knew of it,\nand then proceeded to consider what he should make of them.\n\nIn the midst he was suddenly roused by the deep-toned note of a dog, and\nbeheld a large black Newfoundland dog leaping about the horse in great\nindignation. “Rollo! Rollo!” called a clear young voice, and he saw two\nladles returning from a walk. Rollo, at the first call, galloped back to\nhis mistress, and was evidently receiving an admonition, and promising\ngood behaviour. The two ladies entered the house, while he lay down on\nthe step, with his lion-like paw hanging down, watching Norman with a\nbrilliant pair of hazel eyes. Norman, after a little more wondering\nwhen Mr. Rivers would have done with his father, betook himself to civil\ndemonstrations to the creature, who received them with dignity, and\npresently, after acknowledging with his tail, various whispers of “Good\nold fellow,” and “Here, old Rollo!” having apparently satisfied himself\nthat the young gentleman was respectable, he rose, and vouchsafed to\nstand up with his forepaws in the gig, listening amiably to Norman’s\ndelicate flatteries. Norman even began to hope to allure him into\njumping on the seat: but a great bell rang, and Rollo immediately turned\nround, and dashed off, at full speed, to some back region of the house.\n“So, old fellow, you know what the dinner-bell means,” thought Norman.\n“I hope Mr. Rivers is hungry too. Miss Cleveland will have eaten up her\nwhole luncheon, if this old bore won’t let my father go soon! I hope he\nis desperately ill--‘tis his only excuse! Heigh ho! I must jump out to\nwarm my feet soon! There, there’s a drop of rain! Well, there’s no end\nto it! I wonder what Ethel is doing about Cocksmoor! It is setting in\nfor a wet afternoon!” and Norman disconsolately put up his umbrella.\n\nAt last Dr. May and another gentleman were seen in the conservatory, and\nNorman gladly proceeded to clear the seat; but Dr. May called out, “Jump\nout, Norman, Mr. Rivers is so kind as to ask us to stay to luncheon.”\n\nWith boyish shrinking from strangers, Norman privately wished Mr.\nRivers at Jericho, as he gave the reins to a servant, and entered the\nconservatory, where a kindly hand was held out to him by a gentleman\nof about fifty, with a bald smooth forehead, soft blue eyes, and gentle\npleasant face. “Is this your eldest son?” said he, turning to Dr.\nMay--and the manner of both was as if they were already well acquainted.\n“No, this is my second. The eldest is not quite such a long-legged\nfellow,” said Dr. May. And then followed the question addressed to\nNorman himself, where he was at school.\n\n“At Stoneborough,” said Norman, a little amused at the thought how angry\nEthel and Harry would be that the paragraph of the county paper, where\n“N. W. May” was recorded as prizeman and foremost in the examination,\nhad not penetrated even to Abbotstoke Grange, or rather to its owner’s\nmemory.\n\nHowever, his father could not help adding, “He is the head of the\nschool--a thing we Stoneborough men think much of.”\n\nThis, and Mr. Rivers’s civil answer, made Norman so hot, that he did not\nnotice much in passing through a hall full of beautiful vases, stuffed\nbirds, busts, etc., tastefully arranged, and he did not look up till\nthey were entering a handsome dining-room, where a small square table\nwas laid out for luncheon near a noble fire.\n\nThe two ladies were there, and Mr. Rivers introduced them as his\ndaughter and Mrs. Larpent. It was the most luxurious meal that Norman\nhad ever seen, the plate, the porcelain, and all the appointments of\nthe table so elegant, and the viands, all partaking of the Christmas\ncharacter, and of a recherche delicate description quite new to him.\nHe had to serve as his father’s right hand, and was so anxious to put\neverything as Dr. May liked it, and without attracting notice, that he\nhardly saw or listened till Dr. May began to admire a fine Claude on the\nopposite wall, and embarked in a picture discussion. The doctor had\nmuch taste for art, and had made the most of his opportunities of seeing\npaintings during his time of study at Paris, and in a brief tour to\nItaly. Since that time, few good pictures had come in his way, and these\nwere a great pleasure to him, while Mr. Rivers, a regular connoisseur,\nwas delighted to meet with one who could so well appreciate them. Norman\nperceived how his father was enjoying the conversation, and was much\ninterested both by the sight of the first fine paintings he had ever\nseen, and by the talk about their merits; but the living things in the\nroom had more of his attention and observation, especially the young\nlady who sat at the head of the table; a girl about his own age; she\nwas on a very small scale, and seemed to him like a fairy, in the airy\nlightness and grace of her movements, and the blithe gladsomeness of her\ngestures and countenance. Form and features, though perfectly healthful\nand brisk, had the peculiar finish and delicacy of a miniature painting,\nand were enhanced by the sunny glance of her dark soft smiling eyes.\nHer hair was in black silky braids, and her dress, with its gaiety of\nwell-assorted colour, was positively refreshing to his eye, so long\naccustomed to the deep mourning of his sisters. A little Italian\ngreyhound, perfectly white, was at her side, making infinite variations\nof the line of beauty and grace, with its elegant outline, and S-like\ntail, as it raised its slender nose in hopes of a fragment of bread\nwhich she from time to time dispensed to it.\n\nLuncheon over, Mr. Rivers asked Dr. May to step into his library, and\nNorman guessed that they had been talking all this time, and had never\ncome to the medical opinion. However, a good meal and a large fire made\na great difference in his toleration, and it was so new a scene, that\nhe had no objection to a prolonged waiting, especially when Mrs. Larpent\nsaid, in a very pleasant tone, “Will you come into the drawing-room with\nus?”\n\nHe felt somewhat as if he was walking in enchanted ground as he followed\nher into the large room, the windows opening into the conservatory,\nthe whole air fragrant with flowers, the furniture and ornaments so\nexquisite of their kind, and all such a fit scene for the beautiful\nlittle damsel, who, with her slender dog by her side, tripped on\ndemurely, and rather shyly, but with a certain skipping lightness in her\nstep. A very tall overgrown schoolboy did Norman feel himself for one\nbashful moment, when he found himself alone with the two ladies; but he\nwas ready to be set at ease by Mrs. Larpent’s good-natured manner, when\nshe said something of Rollo’s discourtesy. He smiled, and answered\nthat he had made great friends with the fine old dog, and spoke of his\nrunning off to the dinner, at which little Miss Rivers laughed,\nand looked delighted, and began to tell of Rollo’s perfections and\nintelligence. Norman ventured to inquire the name of the little Italian,\nand was told it was Nipen, because it had once stolen a cake, much like\nthe wind-spirit in Feats on the Fiord. Its beauty and tricks were duly\ndisplayed, and a most beautiful Australian parrot was exhibited, Mrs.\nLarpent taking full interest in the talk, in so lively and gentle a\nmanner, and she and her pretty pupil evidently on such sister-like\nterms, that Norman could hardly believe her to be the governess, when he\nthought of Miss Winter.\n\nMiss Rivers took up some brown leaves which she was cutting out with\nscissors, and shaping. “Our holiday work,” said Mrs. Larpent, in answer\nto the inquiring look of Norman’s eyes. “Meta has been making a drawing\nfor her papa, and is framing it in leather-work. Have you ever seen\nany?”\n\n“Never!” and Norman looked eagerly, asking questions, and watching while\nMiss Rivers cut out her ivy leaf and marked its veins, and showed how\nshe copied it from nature. He thanked her, saying, “I wanted to learn\nall about it, for I thought it would be such nice work for my eldest\nsister.”\n\nA glance of earnest interest from little Meta’s bright eyes at her\ngoverness, and Mrs. Larpent, in a kind, soft tone that quite gained his\nheart, asked, “Is she the invalid?”\n\n“Yes,” said Norman. “New fancy work is a great gain to her.”\n\nMrs. Larpent’s sympathetic questions, and Meta’s softening eyes,\ngradually drew from him a great deal about Margaret’s helpless state,\nand her patience, and capabilities, and how every one came to her with\nall their cares; and Norman, as he spoke, mentally contrasted the life,\nuntouched by trouble and care, led by the fair girl before him, with\nthat atmosphere of constant petty anxieties round her namesake’s couch,\nat years so nearly the same.\n\n“How very good she must be,” said little Meta, quickly and softly; and a\ntear was sparkling on her eyelashes.\n\n“She is indeed,” said Norman earnestly. “I don’t know what papa would do\nbut for her.”\n\nMrs. Larpent asked kind questions whether his father’s arm was very\npainful, and the hopes of its cure; and he felt as if she was a great\nfriend already. Thence they came to books. Norman had not read for\nmonths past, but it happened that Meta was just now reading Woodstock,\nwith which he was of course familiar; and both grew eager in discussing\nthat and several others. Of one, Meta spoke in such terms of delight,\nthat Norman thought it had been very stupid of him to let it lie on the\ntable for the last fortnight without looking into it.\n\nHe was almost sorry to see his father and Mr. Rivers come in, and hear\nthe carriage ordered, but they were not off yet, though the rain was now\nonly Scotch mist. Mr. Rivers had his most choice little pictures\nstill to display, his beautiful early Italian masters, finished like\nilluminations, and over these there was much lingering and admiring.\nMeta had whispered something to her governess, who smiled, and advanced\nto Norman. “Meta wishes to know if your sister would like to have a few\nflowers?” said she.\n\nNo sooner said than done; the door into the conservatory was opened,\nand Meta, cutting sprays of beautiful geranium, delicious heliotrope,\nfragrant calycanthus, deep blue tree violet, and exquisite hothouse\nferns; perfect wonders to Norman, who, at each addition to the bouquet,\nexclaimed by turns, “Oh, thank you!” and, “How she will like it!”\n\nHer father reached a magnolia blossom from on high, and the quick warm\ngrateful emotion trembled in Dr. May’s features and voice, as he said,\n“It is very kind in you; you have given my poor girl a great treat.\nThank you with all my heart.”\n\nMargaret Rivers cast down her eyes, half smiled, and shrank back,\nthinking she had never felt anything like the left-handed grasp, so full\nof warmth and thankfulness. It gave her confidence to venture on the\none question on which she was bent. Her father was in the hall, showing\nNorman his Greek nymph; and lifting her eyes to Dr. May’s face, then\ncasting them down, she coloured deeper than ever, as she said, in a\nstammering whisper, “Oh, please--if you would tell me--do you think--is\npapa very ill?”\n\nDr. May answered in his softest, most reassuring tones: “You need not\nbe alarmed about him, I assure you. You must keep him from too much\nbusiness,” he added, smiling; “make him ride with you, and not let him\ntire himself, and I am sure you can be his best doctor.”\n\n“But do you think,” said Meta, earnestly looking up--“do you think he\nwill be quite well again?”\n\n“You must not expect doctors to be absolute oracles,” said he. “I will\ntell you what I told him--I hardly think his will ever be sound health\nagain, but I see no reason why he should not have many years of comfort,\nand there is no cause for you to disquiet yourself on his account--you\nhave only to be careful of him.”\n\nMeta tried to say “thank you,” but not succeeding, looked imploringly\nat her governess, who spoke for her. “Thank you, it is a great relief to\nhave an opinion, for we were not at all satisfied about Mr. Rivers.”\n\nA few words more, and Meta was skipping about like a sprite finding\na basket for the flowers--she had another shake of the hand, another\ngrateful smile, and “thank you,” from the doctor; and then, as the\ncarriage disappeared, Mrs. Larpent exclaimed, “What a very nice\nintelligent boy that was.”\n\n“Particularly gentlemanlike,” said Mr. Rivers. “Very clever--the head of\nthe school, as his father tells me--and so modest and unassuming--though\nI see his father is very proud of him.”\n\n“Oh, I am sure they are so fond of each other,” said Meta: “didn’t you\nsee his attentive ways to his father at luncheon! And, papa, I am\nsure you must like Dr. May, Mr. Wilmot’s doctor, as much as I said you\nwould.”\n\n“He is the most superior man I have met with for a long time,” said\nMr. Rivers. “It is a great acquisition to find a man of such taste and\nacquirements in this country neighbourhood, when there is not another\nwho can tell a Claude from a Poussin. I declare, when once we began\ntalking, there was no leaving off--I have not met a person of so much\nconversation since I left town. I thought you would like to see him,\nMeta.”\n\n“I hope I shall know the Miss Mays some time or other.”\n\n“That is the prettiest little fairy I ever did see!” was Dr. May’s\nremark, as Norman drove from the door.\n\n“How good-natured they are!” said Norman; “I just said something about\nMargaret, and she gave me all these flowers. How Margaret will be\ndelighted! I wish the girls could see it all!”\n\n“So you got on well with the ladies, did you?”\n\n“They were very kind to me. It was very pleasant!” said Norman, with a\ntone of enjoyment that did his father’s heart good.\n\n“I was glad you should come in. Such a curiosity shop is a sight, and\nthose pictures were some of them well worth seeing. That was a splendid\nTitian.”\n\n“That cast of the Pallas of the Parthenon--how beautiful it was--I knew\nit from the picture in Smith’s dictionary. Mr. Rivers said he would show\nme all his antiques if you would bring me again.”\n\n“I saw he liked your interest in them. He is a good, kind-hearted\ndilettante sort of old man; he has got all the talk of the literary,\ncultivated society in London, and must find it dullish work here.”\n\n“You liked him, didn’t you?”\n\n“He is very pleasant; I found he knew my old friend, Benson, whom I had\nnot seen since we were at Cambridge together, and we got on that and\nother matters; London people have an art of conversation not learned\nhere, and I don’t know how the time slipped away; but you must have been\ntolerably tired of waiting.”\n\n“Not to signify,” said Norman. “I only began to think he must be very\nill; I hope there is not much the matter with him.”\n\n“I can’t say. I am afraid there is organic disease, but I think it may\nbe kept quiet a good while yet, and he may have a pleasant life for some\ntime to come, arranging his prints, and petting his pretty daughter. He\nhas plenty to fall back upon.”\n\n“Do you go there again?”\n\n“Yes, next week. I am glad of it. I shall like to have another look at\nthat little Madonna of his--it is the sort of picture that does one good\nto carry away in one’s eye. Whay! Stop. There’s an old woman in here. It\nis too late for Fordholm, but these cases won’t wait.”\n\nHe went into the cottage, and soon returned, saying, “Fine new blankets,\nand a great kettle of soup, and such praises of the ladies at the\nGrange!” And, at the next house, it was the same story. “Well, ‘tis no\nmockery now to tell the poor creatures they want nourishing food. Slices\nof meat and bottles of port wine rain down on Abbotstoke.”\n\nA far more talkative journey than usual ensued; the discussion of the\npaintings and antiques was almost equally delightful to the father and\nson, and lasted till, about a mile from Stoneborough, they descried\nthree figures in the twilight.\n\n“Ha! How are you, Wilmot? So you braved the rain, Ethel. Jump in,”\n called the doctor, as Norman drew up.\n\n“I shall crowd you--I shall hurt your arm, papa; thank you.”\n\n“No, you won’t--jump in--there’s room for three thread-papers in one\ngig. Why, Wilmot, your brother has a very jewel of a squire! How did you\nfare?”\n\n“Very well on the whole,” was Mr. Wllmot’s answer, while Ethel scrambled\nin, and tried to make herself small, an art in which she was not very\nsuccessful; and Norman gave an exclamation of horrified warning, as she\nwas about to step into the flower-basket; then she nearly tumbled out\nagain in dismay, and was relieved to find herself safely wedged in,\nwithout having done any harm, while her father called out to Mr. Wilmot,\nas they started, “I say! You are coming back to tea with us.”\n\nThat cheerful tone, and the kindness to herself, were a refreshment and\nrevival to Ethel, who was still sobered and shocked by her yesterday’s\nadventure, and by the sense of her father’s sorrowful displeasure.\nExpecting further to be scolded for getting in so awkwardly, she did not\nventure to volunteer anything, and even when he kindly said, “I hope\nyou were prosperous in your expedition,” she only made answer, in a very\ngrave voice, “Yes, papa, we have taken a very nice tidy room.”\n\n“What do you pay for it?”\n\n“Fourpence for each time.”\n\n“Well, here’s for you,” said Dr. May. “It is only two guineas to-day;\nthat banker at the Grange beguiled us of our time, but you had better\nclose the bargain for him, Ethel--he will be a revenue for you, for this\nwinter at least.”\n\n“Oh, thank you, papa,” was all Ethel could say; overpowered by his\nkindness, and more repressed by what she felt so unmerited, than she\nwould have been by coldness, she said few words, and preferred listening\nto Norman, who began to describe their adventures at the Grange.\n\nAll her eagerness revived, however, as she sprang out of the carriage,\nfull of tidings for Margaret; and it was almost a race between her and\nNorman to get upstairs, and unfold their separate budgets.\n\nMargaret’s lamp had just been lighted, when they made their entrance,\nNorman holding the flowers on high.\n\n“Oh, how beautiful! how delicious! For me? Where did you get them?”\n\n“From Abbotstoke Grange; Miss Rivers sent them to you.”\n\n“How very kind! What a lovely geranium, and oh, that fern! I never saw\nanything so choice. How came she to think of me?”\n\n“They asked me in because it rained, and she was making the prettiest\nthings, leather leaves and flowers for picture frames. I thought it was\nwork that would just suit you, and learned how to do it. That made them\nask about you, and it ended by her sending you this nosegay.”\n\n“How very kind everybody is! Well, Ethel, are you come home too?”\n\n“Papa picked me up. Oh, Margaret, we have found such a nice room, a\nclean sanded kitchen--”\n\n“You never saw such a conservatory--”\n\n“And it is to be let to us for fourpence a time--”\n\n“The house is full of beautiful things, pictures and statues. Only think\nof a real Titian, and a cast of the Apollo!”\n\n“Twenty children to begin with, and Richard is going to make some\nforms.”\n\n“Mr. Rivers is going to show me all his casts.”\n\n“Oh, is he? But only think how lucky we were to find such a nice woman;\nMr. Wilmot was so pleased with her.”\n\nNorman found one story at a time was enough, and relinquished the\nfield, contenting himself with silently helping Margaret to arrange the\nflowers, holding the basket for her, and pleased with her gestures of\nadmiration. Ethel went on with her history. “The first place we thought\nof would not do at all; the woman said she would not take half-a-crown a\nweek to have a lot of children stabbling about, as she called it; so\nwe went to another house, and there was a very nice woman indeed, Mrs.\nGreen, with one little boy, whom she wanted to send to school, only it\nis too far. She says she always goes to church at Fordholm because it is\nnearer, and she is quite willing to let us have the room. So we settled\nit, and next Friday we are to begin. Papa has given us two guineas, and\nthat will pay for, let me see, a hundred and twenty-six times, and\nMr. Wilmot is going to give us some books, and Ritchie will print some\nalphabets. We told a great many of the people, and they are so glad.\nOld Granny Hall said, ‘Well, I never!’ and told the girls they must be\nas good as gold now the gentlefolks was coming to teach them. Mr. Wilmot\nis coming with us every Friday as long as the holidays last.”\n\nEthel departed on her father’s coming in to ask Margaret if she would\nlike to have a visit from Mr. Wilmot. She enjoyed this very much, and\nhe sat there nearly an hour, talking of many matters, especially the\nCocksmoor scheme, on which she was glad to hear his opinion at first\nhand.\n\n“I am very glad you think well of it,” she said. “It is most desirable\nthat something should be done for those poor people, and Richard would\nnever act rashly; but I have longed for advice whether it was right to\npromote Ethel’s undertaking. I suppose Richard told you how bent on it\nshe was, long before papa was told of it.”\n\n“He said it was her great wish, and had been so for a long time past.”\n\nMargaret, in words more adequate to express the possession the project\nhad gained of Ethel’s ardent mind, explained the whole history of it.\n“I do believe she looks on it as a sort of call,” said she, “and I have\nfelt as if I ought not to hinder her, and yet I did not know whether it\nwas right, at her age, to let her undertake so much.”\n\n“I understand,” said Mr. Wilmot, “but, from what I have seen of Ethel,\nI should think you had decided rightly. There seems to me to be such\na spirit of energy in her, that if she does not act, she will either\nspeculate and theorise, or pine and prey on herself. I do believe that\nhard homely work, such as this school-keeping, is the best outlet for\nwhat might otherwise run to extravagance--more especially as you say the\nhope of it has already been an incentive to improvement in home duties.”\n\n“That I am sure it has,” said Margaret.\n\n“Moreover,” said Mr. Wilmot, “I think you were quite right in thinking\nthat to interfere with such a design was unsafe. I do believe that a\ngreat deal of harm is done by prudent friends, who dread to let young\npeople do anything out of the common way, and so force their aspirations\nto ferment and turn sour, for want of being put to use.”\n\n“Still girls are told they ought to wait patiently, and not to be eager\nfor self-imposed duties.”\n\n“I am not saying that it is not the appointed discipline for the girls\nthemselves,” said Mr. Wilmot. “If they would submit, and do their best,\nit would doubtless prove the most beneficial thing for them; but it is a\ntrial in which they often fail, and I had rather not be in the place of\nsuch friends.”\n\n“It is a great puzzle!” said Margaret, sighing.\n\n“Ah! I dare say you are often perplexed,” said her friend kindly.\n\n“Indeed I am. There are so many little details that I cannot be always\nteasing papa with, and yet which I do believe form the character more\nthan the great events, and I never know whether I act for the best. And\nthere are so many of us, so many duties, I cannot half attend to any.\nLately, I have been giving up almost everything to keep this room quiet\nfor Norman in the morning, because he was so much harassed and hurt by\nbustle and confusion, and I found to-day that things have gone wrong in\nconsequence.”\n\n“You must do the best you can, and try to trust that while you work in\nthe right spirit, your failures will be compensated,” said Mr. Wilmot.\n“It is a hard trial.”\n\n“I like your understanding it,” said Margaret, smiling sadly. “I don’t\nknow whether it is silly, but I don’t like to be pitied for the wrong\nthing. My being so helpless is what every one laments over; but, after\nall, that is made up to me by the petting and kindness I get from all\nof them; but it is the being mistress of the house, and having to settle\nfor every one, without knowing whether I do right or wrong, that is my\ntrouble.”\n\n“I am not sure, however, that it is right to call it a trouble, though\nit is a trial.”\n\n“I see what you mean,” said Margaret. “I ought to be thankful. I know\nit is an honour, and I am quite sure I should be grieved if they did\nnot all come to me and consult me as they do. I had better not have\ncomplained, and yet I am glad I did, for I like you to understand my\ndifficulties.”\n\n“And, indeed, I wish to enter into them, and do or say anything in my\npower to help you. But I don’t know anything that can be of so much\ncomfort as the knowledge that He who laid the burden on you, will help\nyou to bear it.”\n\n“Yes,” said Margaret, pausing; and then, with a sweet look, though a\nheavy sigh, she said, “It is very odd how things turn out! I always\nhad a childish fancy that I would be useful and important, but I little\nthought how it would be! However, as long as Richard is in the house,\nI always feel secure about the others, and I shall soon be downstairs\nmyself. Don’t you think dear papa in better spirits?”\n\n“I thought so to-day,”--and here the doctor returned, talking of\nAbbotstoke Grange, where he had certainly been much pleased. “It was\na lucky chance,” he said, “that they brought Norman in. It was exactly\nwhat I wanted to rouse and interest him, and he took it all in so well,\nthat I am sure they were pleased with him. I thought he looked a very\nlanky specimen of too much leg and arm when I called him in, but he has\nsuch good manners, and is so ready and understanding, that they\ncould not help liking him. It was fortunate I had him instead of\nRichard--Ritchie is a very good fellow, certainly, but he had rather\nlook at a steam-engine, any day, than at Raphael himself.”\n\nNorman had his turn by-and-by. He came up after tea, reporting that papa\nwas fast asleep in his chair, and the others would go on about Cocksmoor\ntill midnight, if they were let alone; and made up for his previous\nyielding to Ethel, by giving, with much animation, and some excitement,\na glowing description of the Grange, so graphic, that Margaret said she\ncould almost fancy she had been there.\n\n“Oh, Margaret, I wonder if you ever will! I would give something for you\nto see the beautiful conservatory. It is a real bower for a maiden of\nromance, with its rich green fragrance in the midst of winter. It is\nlike a picture in a dream. One could imagine it a fairy land, where no\ncare, or grief, or weariness could come, all choice beauty and sweetness\nwaiting on the creature within. I can hardly believe that it is a real\nplace, and that I have seen it.”\n\n“Though you have brought these pretty tokens that your fairy is as good\nas she is fair!” said Margaret, smiling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\n\n   EVANS.   Peace your tattlings. What is fair, William?\n   WILLIAM. PULCHER.\n   QUICKLY. Poulcats! there are fairer things than poulcats sure!\n   EVANS.   I pray you have your remembrance, child, accusative\n            HING HANG HOG.\n   QUICKLY. HANG HOG is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.\n                                                   SHAKESPEARE.\n\n\nIn a large family it must often happen, that since every member of it\ncannot ride the same hobby, nor at the same time, their several steeds\nmust sometimes run counter to each other; and so Ethel found it, one\nmorning when Miss Winter, having a bad cold, had given her an unwonted\nholiday.\n\nMr. Wilmot had sent a large parcel of books for her to choose from for\nCocksmoor, but this she could not well do without consultation. The\nmultitude bewildered her, she was afraid of taking too many or too few,\nand the being brought to these practical details made her sensible that\nthough her schemes were very grand and full for future doings, they\npassed very lightly over the intermediate ground. The Paulo post fulurum\nwas a period much more developed in her imagination than the future,\nthat the present was flowing into.\n\nWhere was her coadjutor, Richard? Writing notes for papa, and not to\nbe disturbed. She had better have waited tranquilly, but this would not\nsuit her impatience, and she ran up to Margaret’s room. There she found\na great display of ivy leaves, which Norman, who had been turning\nhalf the shops in the town upside down in search of materials, was\ninstructing her to imitate in leather-work--a regular mania with him,\nand apparently the same with Margaret.\n\nIn came Ethel. “Oh, Margaret, will you look at these ‘First Truths?’ Do\nyou think they would be easy enough? Shall I take some of the Parables\nand Miracles at once, or content myself with the book about ‘Jane\nSparks?’”\n\n“There’s some very easy reading in ‘Jane Sparks’, isn’t there? I would\nnot make the little books from the New Testament too common.”\n\n“Take care, that leaf has five points,” said Norman.\n\n“Shall I bring you up ‘Jane Sparks’ to see? Because then you can judge,”\n said Ethel.\n\n“There, Norman, is that right?--what a beauty! I should like to look\nover them by-and-by, dear Ethel, very much.”\n\nEthel gazed and went away, more put out than was usual with her. “When\nMargaret has a new kind of fancy work,” she thought, “she cares for\nnothing else! as if my poor children did not signify more than trumpery\nleather leaves!” She next met Flora.\n\n“Oh, Flora, see here, what a famous parcel of books Mr. Wilmot has sent\nus to choose from.”\n\n“All those!” said Flora, turning them over as they lay heaped on the\ndrawing-room sofa; “what a confusion!”\n\n“See, such a parcel of reading books. I want to know what you think of\nsetting them up with ‘Jane Sparks’, as it is week-day teaching.”\n\n“You will be very tired of hearing those spelled over for ever; they\nhave some nicer books at the national school.”\n\n“What is the name of them? Do you see any of them here?”\n\n“No, I don’t think I do, but I can’t wait to look now. I must write some\nletters. You had better put them together a little. If you were to sort\nthem, you would know what is there. Now, what a mess they are in.”\n\nEthel could not deny it, and began to deal them out in piles, looking\nsomewhat more fitting, but still felt neglected and aggrieved, at no one\nbeing at leisure but Harry, who was not likely to be of any use to her.\n\nPresently she heard the study door open, and hoped; but though it was\nRichard who entered the room, he was followed by Tom, and each held\nvarious books that boded little good to her. Miss Winter had, much\nto her own satisfaction, been relieved from the charge of Tom, whose\nlessons Richard had taken upon himself; and thus Ethel had heard so\nlittle about them for a long time past, that even in her vexation and\ndesire to have them over, she listened with interest, desirous to judge\nwhat sort of place Tom might be likely to take in school.\n\nShe did not perceive that this made Richard nervous and uneasy. He had a\ngreat dislike to spectators of Latin lessons; he never had forgotten an\nunlucky occasion, some years back, when his father was examining him\nin the Georgics, and he, dull by nature, and duller by confusion and\ntimidity, had gone on rendering word for word--enim for, seges a crop,\nlini of mud, urit burns, campum the field, avenae a crop of pipe, urit\nburns it; when Norman and Ethel had first warned him of the beauty of\nhis translation by an explosion of laughing, when his father had shut\nthe book with a bounce, shaken his head in utter despair, and told him\nto give up all thoughts of doing anything--and when Margaret had cried\nwith vexation. Since that time, he had never been happy when any one was\nin earshot of a lesson; but to-day he had no escape--Harry lay on the\nrug reading, and Ethel sat forlorn over her books on the sofa. Tom,\nhowever, was bright enough, declined his Greek nouns irreproachably, and\nconstrued his Latin so well, that Ethel could not help putting in a word\nor two of commendation, and auguring the third form. “Do let him off the\nparsing, Ritchie,” said she coaxingly--“he has said it so well, and I\nwant you so much.”\n\n“I am afraid I must not,” said Richard; who, to her surprise, did not\nlook pleased or satisfied with the prosperous translation; “but come,\nTom, you shan’t have many words, if you really know them.”\n\nTom twisted and looked rather cross, but when asked to parse the word\nviribus, answered readily and correctly.\n\n“Very well, only two more--affuit?”\n\n“Third person singular, praeter perfect tense of the verb affo, affis,\naffui, affere,” gabbled off Tom with such confidence, that though Ethel\ngave an indignant jump, Richard was almost startled into letting it\npass, and disbelieving himself. He remonstrated in a somewhat hesitating\nvoice. “Did you find that in the dictionary?” said he; “I thought affui\ncame from adsum.”\n\n“Oh, to be sure, stupid fool of a word, so it does!” said Tom hastily.\n“I had forgot--adsum, ades, affui, adesse.”\n\nRichard said no more, but proposed the word oppositus.\n\n“Adjective.”\n\nEthel was surprised, for she remembered that it was, in this passage,\npart of a passive verb, which Tom had construed correctly, “it was\nobjected,” and she had thought this very creditable to him, whereas he\nnow evidently took it for opposite; however, on Richard’s reading the\nline, he corrected himself and called it a participle, but did not\ncommit himself further, till asked for its derivation.\n\n“From oppositor.”\n\n“Hallo!” cried Harry, who hitherto had been abstracted in his book, but\nnow turned, raised himself on his elbow, and, at the blunder, shook his\nthick yellow locks, and showed his teeth like a young lion.\n\n“No, now, Tom, pay attention,” said Richard resignedly. “If you found\nout its meaning, you must have seen its derivation.”\n\n“Oppositus,” said Tom, twisting his fingers, and gazing first at Ethel,\nthen at Harry, in hopes of being prompted, then at the ceiling and\nfloor, the while he drawled out the word with a whine, “why, oppositus\nfrom op-posor.”\n\n“A poser! ain’t it?” said Harry.\n\n“Don’t, Harry, you distract him,” said Richard. “Come, Tom, say at once\nwhether you know it or not--it is of no use to invent.”\n\n“From op-” and a mumble.\n\n“What? I don’t hear--op--”\n\nTom again looked for help to Harry, who made a mischievous movement of\nhis lips, as if prompting, and, deceived by it, he said boldly, “From\nop-possum.”\n\n“That’s right! let us hear him decline it!” cried Harry, in an ecstasy.\n“Oppossum, opottis, opposse, or oh-pottery!”\n\n“Harry,” said Richard, in a gentle reasonable voice, “I wish you would\nbe so kind as not to stay, if you cannot help distracting him.”\n\nAnd Harry, who really had a tolerable share of forbearance and\nconsideration, actually obeyed, contenting himself with tossing his book\ninto the air and catching it again, while he paused at the door to give\nhis last unsolicited assistance. “Decline oppossum you say. I’ll tell\nyou how: O-possum re-poses up a gum tree. O-pot-you-I will, says the\nO-posse of Yankees, come out to ketch him. Opossum poses them and\ndeclines in O-pot-esse by any manner of means of o-potting-di-do-dum,\nwas quite oppositum-oppotitu, in fact, quite contrairy.”\n\nRichard, with the gravity of a victim, heard this sally of schoolboy\nwit, which threw Ethel back on the sofa in fits of laughing, and\ndeclaring that the Opossum declined, not that he was declined; but, in\nthe midst of the disturbance thus created, Tom stepped up to her, and\nwhispered, “Do tell me, Ethel!”\n\n“Indeed I shan’t,” said she. “Why don’t you say fairly if you don’t\nknow?”\n\nHe was obliged to confess his ignorance, and Richard made him conjugate\nthe whole verb opponor from beginning to end, in which he wanted a good\ndeal of help.\n\nEthel could not help saying, “How did you find out the meaning of that\nword, Tom, if you didn’t look out the verb?”\n\n“I--don’t know,” drawled Tom, in the voice, half sullen, half piteous,\nwhich he always assumed when out of sorts.\n\n“It is very odd,” she said decidedly; but Richard took no notice, and\nproceeded to the other lessons, which went off tolerably well, except\nthe arithmetic, where there was some great misunderstanding, into which\nEthel did not enter for some time. When she did attend, she perceived\nthat Tom had brought a right answer, without understanding the working\nof the sum, and that Richard was putting him through it. She began to\nbe worked into a state of dismay and indignation at Tom’s behaviour, and\nRichard’s calm indifference, which made her almost forget ‘Jane Sparks’,\nand long to be alone with Richard; but all the world kept coming into\nthe room, and going out, and she could not say what was in her mind till\nafter dinner, when, seeing Richard go up into Margaret’s room, she ran\nafter him, and entering it, surprised Margaret, by not beginning on her\nbooks, but saying at once, “Ritchie, I wanted to speak to you about Tom.\nI am sure he shuffled about those lessons.”\n\n“I am afraid he does,” said Richard, much concerned.\n\n“What, do you mean that it is often so?”\n\n“Much too often,” said Richard; “but I have never been able to detect\nhim; he is very sharp, and has some underhand way of preparing his\nlessons that I cannot make out.”\n\n“Did you know it, Margaret?” said Ethel, astonished not to see her\nsister looked shocked as well as sorry.\n\n“Yes,” said Margaret, “Ritchie and I have often talked it over, and\ntried to think what was to be done.”\n\n“Dear me! why don’t you tell papa? It is such a terrible thing!”\n\n“So it is,” said Margaret, “but we have nothing positive or tangible\nto accuse Tom of; we don’t know what he does, and have never caught him\nout.”\n\n“I am sure he must have found out the meaning of that oppositum in some\nwrong way--if he had looked it out, he would only have found opposite.\nNothing but opponor could have shown him the rendering which he made.”\n\n“That’s like what I have said almost every day,” said Richard, “but\nthere we are--I can’t get any further.”\n\n“Perhaps he guesses by the context,” said Margaret.\n\n“It would be impossible to do so always,” said both the Latin scholars\nat once.\n\n“Well, I can’t think how you can take it so quietly,” said Ethel. “I\nwould have told papa the first moment, and put a stop to it. I have a\ngreat mind to do so, if you won’t.\n\n“Ethel, Ethel, that would never do!” exclaimed Margaret, “pray don’t.\nPapa would be so dreadfully grieved and angry with poor Tom.”\n\n“Well, so he deserves,” said Ethel.\n\n“You don’t know what it is to see papa angry,” said Richard.\n\n“Dear me, Richard!” cried Ethel, who thought she knew pretty well what\nhis sharp words were. “I’m sure papa never was angry with me, without\nmaking me love him more, and, at least, want to be better.”\n\n“You are a girl,” said Richard.\n\n“You are higher spirited, and shake off things faster,” said Margaret.\n\n“Why, what do you think he would do to Tom?”\n\n“I think he would be so very angry, that Tom, who, you know, is timid\nand meek, would be dreadfully frightened,” said Richard.\n\n“That’s just what he ought to be, frightened out of these tricks.”\n\n“I am afraid it would frighten him into them still more,” said Richard,\n“and perhaps give him such a dread of my father as would prevent him\nfrom ever being open with him.”\n\n“Besides, it would make papa so very unhappy,” added Margaret. “Of\ncourse, if poor dear Tom had been found out in any positive deceit, we\nought to mention it at once, and let him be punished; but while it is\nall vague suspicion, and of what papa has such a horror of, it would\nonly grieve him, and make him constantly anxious, without, perhaps,\ndoing Tom any good.”\n\n“I think all that is expediency,” said Ethel, in her bluff, abrupt way.\n\n“Besides,” said Richard, “we have nothing positive to accuse him of, and\nif we had, it would be of no use. He will be at school in three weeks,\nand there he would be sure to shirk, even if he left it off here. Every\none does, and thinks nothing of it.”\n\n“Richard!” cried both sisters, shocked. “You never did?”\n\n“No, we didn’t, but most others do, and not bad fellows either. It is\nnot the way of boys to think much of those things.”\n\n“It is mean--it is dishonourable--it is deceitful!” cried Ethel.\n\n“I know it is very wrong, but you’ll never get the general run of boys\nto think so,” said Richard.\n\n“Then Tom ought not to go to school at all till he is well armed against\nit,” said Ethel.\n\n“That can’t be helped,” said Richard. “He will get clear of it in time,\nwhen he knows better.”\n\n“I will talk to him,” said Margaret, “and, indeed, I think it would be\nbetter than worrying papa.”\n\n“Well,” said Ethel, “of course I shan’t tell, because it is not my\nbusiness, but I think papa ought to know everything about us, and I\ndon’t like your keeping anything back. It is being almost as bad as Tom\nhimself.”\n\nWith which words, as Flora entered, Ethel marched out of the room in\ndispleasure, and went down, resolved to settle Jane Sparks by herself.\n\n“Ethel is out of sorts to-day,” said Flora. “What’s the matter?”\n\n“We have had a discussion,” said Margaret. “She has been terribly\nshocked by finding out what we have often thought about poor little Tom,\nand she thinks we ought to tell papa. Her principle is quite right, but\nI doubt--”\n\n“I know exactly how Ethel would do it!” cried Flora; “blurt out all on\na sudden, ‘Papa, Tom cheats at his lessons!’ then there would be a\ntremendous uproar, papa would scold Tom till he almost frightened him\nout of his wits, and then find out it was only suspicion.”\n\n“And never have any comfort again,” said Margaret. “He would always\ndread that Tom was deceiving him, and then think it was all for want\nof--Oh, no, it will never do to speak of it, unless we find out some\npositive piece of misbehaviour.”\n\n“Certainly,” said Flora.\n\n“And it would do Tom no good to make him afraid of papa,” said Richard.\n\n“Ethel’s rule is right in principle,” said Margaret thoughtfully, “that\npapa ought to know all without reserve, and yet it will hardly do in\npractice. One must use discretion, and not tease him about every\nlittle thing. He takes them so much to heart, that he would be almost\ndistracted; and, with so much business abroad, I think at home he should\nhave nothing but rest, and, as far as we can, freedom from care and\nworry. Anything wrong about the children brings on the grief so much,\nthat I cannot bear to mention it.”\n\nRichard and Flora agreed with her, admiring the spirit which made her,\nin her weakness and helplessness, bear the whole burden of family cares\nalone, and devote herself entirely to spare her father. He was, indeed,\nher first object, and she would have sacrificed anything to give him\nease of mind; but, perhaps, she regarded him more as a charge of\nher own, than as, in very truth, the head of the family. She had the\ngovernment in her hands, and had never been used to see him exercise it\nmuch in detail (she did not know how much her mother had referred to\nhim in private), and had succeeded to her authority at a time when his\nhealth and spirits were in such a state as to make it doubly needful to\nspare him. It was no wonder that she sometimes carried her consideration\nbeyond what was strictly right, and forgot that he was the real\nauthority, more especially as his impulsive nature sometimes carried him\naway, and his sound judgment was not certain to come into play at\nthe first moment, so that it required some moral courage to excite\ndispleasure, so easy of manifestation; and of such courage there was,\nperhaps, a deficiency in her character. Nor had she yet detected her own\nsatisfaction in being the first with every one in the family.\n\nEthel was put out, as Flora had discovered, and when she was downstairs\nshe found it out, and accused herself of having been cross to Margaret,\nand unkind to Tom--of wishing to be a tell-tale. But still, though\ndispleased with herself, she was dissatisfied with Margaret; it might\nbe right, but it did not agree with her notions. She wanted to see every\none uncompromising, as girls of fifteen generally do; she had an intense\ndisgust and loathing of underhand ways, could not bear to think of\nTom’s carrying them on, and going to a place of temptation with them\nuncorrected; and she looked up to her father with the reverence and\nenthusiasm of one like minded.\n\nShe was vexed on another score. Norman came home from Abbotstoke Grange\nwithout having seen Miss Rivers, but with a fresh basket of choice\nflowers, rapturous descriptions of Mr. Rivers’s prints, and a present\nof an engraving, in shading, such as to give the effect of a cast, of\na very fine head of Alexander. Nothing was to be thought of but a frame\nfor this--olive, bay, laurel, everything appropriate to the conqueror.\nMargaret and Norman were engrossed in the subject, and, to Ethel, who\nhad no toleration for fancy work, who expected everything to be either\nuseful or intellectual, this seemed very frivolous. She heard her\nfather say how glad he was to see Norman interested and occupied, and\ncertainly, though it was only in leather leaves, it was better than\ndrooping and attending to nothing. She knew, too, that Margaret did it\nfor his sake, but, said Ethel to herself, “It was very odd that people\nshould find amusement in such things. Margaret always had a turn for\nthem, but it was very strange in Norman.”\n\nThen came the pang of finding out that this was aggravated by the\nneglect of herself; she called it all selfishness, and felt that she had\nhad an uncomfortable, unsatisfactory day, with everything going wrong.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n\n     Gently supported by the ready aid\n       Of loving hands, whose little work of toil\n     Her grateful prodigality repaid\n       With all the benediction of her smile,\n         She turned her failing feet\n         To the softly cushioned seat,\n       Dispensing kindly greetings all the time.\n                                             R. M. MILNES.\n\n\nThree great events signalised the month of January. The first was, the\nopening of the school at Cocksmoor, whither a cart transported half\na dozen forms, various books, and three dozen plum-buns, Margaret’s\ncontribution, in order that the school might begin with eclat. There\nwalked Mr. Wilmot, Richard, and Flora, with Mary, in a jumping, capering\nstate of delight, and Ethel, not knowing whether she rejoiced. She\nkept apart from the rest, and hardly spoke, for this long probation had\nimpressed her with a sense of responsibility, and she knew that it was\na great work to which she had set her hand--a work in which she must\npersevere, and in which she could not succeed in her own strength.\n\nShe took hold of Flora’s hand, and squeezed it hard, in a fit of\nshyness, when they came upon the hamlet, and saw the children watching\nfor them; and when they reached the house, she would fain have shrank\ninto nothing; there was a swelling of heart that seemed to overwhelm and\nstifle her, and the effect of which was to keep her standing unhelpful,\nwhen the others were busy bringing in the benches and settling the room.\n\nIt was a tidy room, but it seemed very small when they ranged the\nbenches, and opened the door to the seven-and-twenty children, and the\nfour or five women who stood waiting. Ethel felt some dismay when they\nall came pushing in, without order or civility, and would have been\nutterly at a loss what to do with her scholars now she had got them, if\nRichard and Flora had not marshalled them to the benches.\n\nRough heads, torn garments, staring vacant eyes, and mouths gaping in\nshy rudeness--it was a sight to disenchant her of visions of pleasure in\nthe work she had set herself. It was well that she had not to take the\ninitiative.\n\nMr. Wilmot said a few simple words to the mothers about the wish to\nteach their children what was right, and to do the best at present\npracticable; and then told the children that he hoped they would take\npains to be good, and mind what they were taught. Then he desired all\nto kneel down; he said the Collect, “Prevent us, O Lord, in all our\ndoings,” and then the Lord’s Prayer.\n\nEthel felt as if she could bear it better, and was more up to the work\nafter this. Next, the children were desired to stand round the room, and\nMr. Wilmot tried who could say the Catechism--the two biggest, a boy and\na girl, had not an idea of it, and the boy looked foolish, and grinned\nat being asked what was his name. One child was tolerably perfect, and\nabout half a dozen had some dim notions. Three were entirely ignorant of\nthe Lord’s Prayer, and many of the others did not by any means pronounce\nthe words of it. Jane and Fanny Taylor, Rebekah Watts, and Mrs. Green’s\nlittle boy, were the only ones who, by their own account, used morning\nand evening prayers, though, on further examination, it appeared that\nPolly and Jenny Hall, and some others, were accustomed to repeat the old\nrhyme about “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,” and Una M’Carthy and her\nlittle brother Fergus said something that nobody could make out, but\nwhich Mr. Wilmot thought had once been an “Ave Maria.”\n\nSome few of the children could read, and several more knew their\nletters. The least ignorant were selected to form a first class, and Mr.\nWilmot promised a Prayer-book to the first who should be able to repeat\nthe Catechism without a mistake, and a Bible to the first who could read\na chapter in it.\n\nThen followed a setting of tasks, varying from a verse of a Psalm, or\nthe first answer in the Catechism, down to the distinction between A,\nB, and C; all to be ready by next Tuesday, when, weather permitting,\na second lesson was to be given. Afterwards, a piece of advice of\nMargaret’s was followed, and Flora read aloud to the assembly the story\nof “Margaret Fletcher.” To some this seemed to give great satisfaction,\nespecially to Una, but Ethel was surprised to see that many, and those\nnot only little ones, talked and yawned. They had no power of attention\neven to a story, and the stillness was irksome to such wild colts. It\nwas plain that it was time to leave off, and there was no capacity there\nwhich did not find the conclusion agreeable, when the basket was opened,\nand Ethel and Mary distributed the buns, with instructions to say,\n“thank you.”\n\nThe next Tuesday, some of the lessons were learned, Una’s perfectly, the\nbig ignorant boy came no more; and some of the children had learned to\nbehave better, while others behaved worse; Ethel began to know what she\nwas about; Richard’s gentleness was eminently successful with the little\ngirls, impressing good manners on them in a marvellous way; and Mary’s\nimportance and happiness with alphabet scholars, some bigger than\nherself, were edifying. Cocksmoor was fairly launched.\n\nThe next memorable day was that of Margaret’s being first carried\ndownstairs. She had been willing to put it off as long as she could,\ndreading to witness the change below-stairs, and feeling, too, that in\nentering on the family room, without power of leaving it, she was losing\nall quiet and solitude, as well as giving up that monopoly of her father\nin his evenings, which had been her great privilege.\n\nHowever, she tried to talk herself into liking it; and was rewarded\nby the happy commotion it caused, though Dr. May was in a state of\nexcitement and nervousness at the prospect of seeing her on the stairs,\nand his attempts to conceal it only made it worse, till Margaret knew\nshe should be nervous herself, and wished him out of sight and out of\nthe house till it was over, for without him she had full confidence in\nthe coolness and steadiness of Richard, and by him it was safely and\nquietly accomplished. She was landed on the sofa, Richard and Flora\nsettling her, and the others crowding round and exclaiming, while the\nnewness of the scene and the change gave her a sense of confusion, and\nshe shut her eyes to recover her thoughts, but opened them the next\ninstant at her father’s exclamation that she was overcome, smiled to\nreassure him, and declared herself not tired, and to be very glad to be\namong them again. But the bustle was oppressive, and her cheerful manner\nwas an effort; she longed to see them all gone, and Flora found it\nout, sent the children for their walk, and carried off Ethel and the\nbrothers.\n\nDr. May was called out of the room at the same time, and she was left\nalone. She gazed round her, at the room where, four months before, she\nhad seen her mother with the babe in her arms, the children clustered\nround her, her father exulting in his hen-and-chicken daisies, herself\nfull of bright undefined hope, radiant with health and activity, and her\none trouble such that she now knew the force of her mother’s words, that\nit only proved her happiness. It was not till that moment that Margaret\nrealised the change; found her eyes filling with tears, as she looked\nround, and saw the familiar furniture and ornaments.\n\nThey were instantly checked as she heard her father returning, but not\nso that he did not perceive them, and exclaim that it had been too much\nfor her. “Oh, no--it was only the first time,” said Margaret, losing the\nsense of the painful vacancy in her absorbing desire not to distress her\nfather, and thinking only of him as she watched him standing for some\nminutes leaning on the mantel-shelf with his hand shading his forehead.\n\nShe began to speak as soon as she thought he was ready to have his mind\nturned away: “How nicely Ritchie managed! He carried me so comfortably\nand easily. It is enough to spoil me to be so deftly waited on.”\n\n“I’m glad of it,” said Dr. May; “I am sure the change is better for\nyou;” but he came and looked at her still with great solicitude.\n\n“Ritchie can take excellent care of me,” she continued, most anxious\nto divert his thoughts. “You see it will do very well indeed for you to\ntake Harry to school.”\n\n“I should like to do so. I should like to see his master, and to take\nNorman with me,” said the doctor. “It would be just the thing for him\nnow--we would show him the dockyard, and all those matters, and such a\nthorough holiday would set him up again.”\n\n“He is very much better.”\n\n“Much better--he is recovering spirits and tone very fast. That\nleaf-work of yours came at a lucky time. I like to see him looking out\nfor a curious fern in the hedgerows--the pursuit has quite brightened\nhim up.”\n\n“And he does it so thoroughly,” said Margaret. “Ethel fancies it is\nrather frivolous of him, I believe; but it amuses me to see how men give\ndignity to what women make trifling. He will know everything about the\nleaves, hunts up my botany books, and has taught me a hundred times more\nof the construction and wonders of them than I ever learned.”\n\n“Ay,” said the doctor, “he has been talking a good deal to me about\nvegetable chemistry. He would make a good scientific botanist, if\nhe were to be nothing else. I should be glad if he sticks to it as a\npursuit--‘tis pretty work, and I should like to have gone further with\nit, if I had ever had time for it.”\n\n“I dare say he will,” said Margaret. “It will be very pleasant if he can\ngo with you. How he would enjoy the British Museum, if there was time\nfor him to see it! Have you said anything to him yet?”\n\n“No; I waited to see how you were, as it all depends on that.”\n\n“I think it depends still more on something else; whether Norman is as\nfit to take care of you as Richard is.”\n\n“That’s another point. There’s nothing but what he could manage now, but\nI don’t like saying anything to him. I know he would undertake anything\nI wished, without a word, and then, perhaps, dwell on it in fancy, and\nforce himself, till it would turn to a perfect misery, and upset his\nnerves again. I’m sorry for it. I meant him to have followed my trade,\nbut he’ll never do for that. However, he has wits enough to make himself\nwhat he pleases, and I dare say he will keep at the head of the school\nafter all.”\n\n“How very good he has been in refraining from restlessness!”\n\n“It’s beautiful!” said Dr. May, with strong emotion. “Poor boy! I trust\nhe’ll not be disappointed, and I don’t think he will; but I’ve promised\nhim I won’t be annoyed if he should lose his place--so we must take\nespecial care not to show any anxiety. However, for this matter,\nMargaret, I wish you would sound him, and see whether it would be more\npleasure or pain. Only mind you don’t let him think that I shall be\nvexed, if he feels that he can’t make up his mind; I would not have him\nfancy that, for more than I can tell.”\n\nThis consultation revived the spirits of both; and the others returning,\nfound Margaret quite disposed for companionship. If to her the evening\nwas sad and strange, like a visit in a dream to some old familiar haunt,\nfinding all unnatural, to the rest it was delightful. The room was no\nlonger dreary, now that there was a centre for care and attentions, and\nthe party was no longer broken up--the sense of comfort, cheerfulness,\nand home-gathering had returned, and the pleasant evening household\ngossip went round the table almost as it used to do. Dr. May resumed\nhis old habit of skimming a club book, and imparting the cream to the\nlisteners; and Flora gave them some music, a great treat to Margaret,\nwho had long only heard its distant sounds.\n\nMargaret found an opportunity of talking to Norman, and judged\nfavourably. He was much pleased at the prospect of the journey, and of\nseeing a ship, so as to have a clearer notion of the scene where Harry’s\nlife was to be spent, and though the charge of the arm was a drawback,\nhe did not treat it as insurmountable.\n\nA few days’ attendance in his father’s room gave him confidence in\ntaking Richard’s place, and, accordingly, the third important measure\nwas decided on, namely, that he and his father should accompany Harry\nto the naval school, and be absent three nights. Some relations would be\nglad to receive them in London, and Alan Ernescliffe, who was studying\nsteam navigation at Woolwich, volunteered to meet them, and go with them\nto Portsmouth.\n\nIt was a wonderful event; Norman and Harry had never been beyond\nWhitford in their lives, and none of the young ones could recollect\ntheir papa’s ever going from home for more than one night. Dr. May\nlaughed at Margaret for her anxiety and excitement on the subject, and\nwas more amused at overhearing Richard’s precise directions to Norman\nover the packing up.\n\n“Ay, Ritchie,” said the doctor, as he saw his portmanteau locked, and\nthe key given to Norman, “you may well look grave upon it. You won’t see\nit look so tidy when it comes back again, and I believe you are thinking\nit will be lucky if you see it at all.”\n\nThere was a very affectionate leave-taking of Harry, who, growing rather\nsoft-hearted, thought it needful to be disdainful, scolded Mary and\nBlanche for “lugging off his figure-head,” and assured them they made\nas much work about it as if he was going to sea at once. Then, to put\nan end to any more embraces, he marched off to the station with Tom,\nand nearly caused the others to be too late, by the search for him that\nensued.\n\nIn due time, Dr. May and Norman returned, looking the better for the\njourney. There was, first, to tell of Harry’s school and its master, and\nAlan Ernescliffe’s introduction of him to a nice-looking boy of his\nown age; then they were eloquent on the wonders of the dockyard, the\nVictory, the block machinery. And London--while Dr. May went to transact\nsome business, Norman had been with Alan at the British Museum, and\nthough he had intended to see half London besides, there was no tearing\nhim away from the Elgin marbles; and nothing would serve him, but\nbringing Dr. May the next morning to visit the Ninevite bulls. Norman\nfurther said, that whereas papa could never go out of his house\nwithout meeting people who had something to say to him, it was the same\nelsewhere. Six acquaintances he had met unexpectedly in London, and two\nat Portsmouth.\n\nSo the conversation went on all the evening, to the great delight of\nall. It was more about things than people, though Flora inquired after\nMr. Ernescliffe, and was told he had met them at the station, had been\neverywhere with them, and had dined at the Mackenzies’ each day. “How\nwas he looking?” Ethel asked; and was told pretty much the same as when\nhe went away; and, on a further query from Flora, it appeared that an\nold naval friend of his father’s had hopes of a ship, and had promised\nto have him with him, and thereupon warm hopes were expressed that Harry\nmight have a berth in the same.\n\n“And when is he coming here again, papa?” said Ethel.\n\n“Eh! oh! I can’t tell. I say, isn’t it high time to ring?”\n\nWhen they went up at night, every one felt that half the say had\nnot been said, and there were fresh beginnings on the stairs. Norman\ntriumphantly gave the key to Richard, and then called to Ethel, “I say,\nwon’t you come into my room while I unpack?”\n\n“Oh, yes, I should like it very much.”\n\nEthel sat on the bed, rolled up in a cloak, while Norman undid his bag,\nannouncing at the same time, “Well, Ethel, papa says I may get to my\nEuripides to-morrow, if I please, and only work an hour at a time!”\n\n“Oh, I am so glad. Then he thinks you quite well?”\n\n“Yes, I am quite well. I hope I’ve done with nonsense.”\n\n“And how did you get on with his arm?”\n\n“Very well--he was so patient, and told me how to manage. You heard that\nSir Matthew said it had got much better in these few weeks. Oh, here it\nis! There’s a present for you.”\n\n“Oh, thank you. From you, or from papa?”\n\n“This is mine. Papa has a present for every one in his bag. He said, at\nlast, that a man with eleven children hadn’t need to go to London very\noften.”\n\n“And you got this beautiful ‘Lyra Innocentium’ for me? How very kind\nof you, Norman. It is just what I wished for. Such lovely binding--and\nthose embossed edges to the leaves. Oh! they make a pattern as they\nopen! I never saw anything like it.”\n\n“I saw such a one on Miss Rivers’s table, and asked Ernescliffe where to\nget one like it. See, here’s what my father gave me.”\n\n“‘Bishop Ken’s Manual’. That is in readiness for the Confirmation.”\n\n“Look. I begged him to put my name, though he said it was a pity to do\nit with his left hand; I didn’t like to wait, so I asked him at least to\nwrite N. W. May, and the date.”\n\n“And he has added Prov. xxiii. 24, 25. Let me look it out.” She did\nso, and instead of reading it aloud, looked at Norman full of\ncongratulation.\n\n“How it ought to make one--” and there Norman broke off from the\nfullness of his heart.\n\n“I’m glad he put both verses” said Ethel presently. “How pleased with\nyou he must be!”\n\nA silence while brother and sister both gazed intently at the crooked\ncharacters, till at last Ethel, with a long breath, resumed her ordinary\ntone, and said, “How well he has come to write with his left hand now.”\n\n“Yes. Did you know that he wrote himself to tell Ernescliffe Sir\nMatthew’s opinion of Margaret?”\n\n“No: did he?”\n\n“Do you know, Ethel,” said Norman, as he knelt on the floor, and tumbled\nmiscellaneous articles out of his bag, “it is my belief that Ernescliffe\nis in love with her, and that papa thinks so.”\n\n“Dear me!” cried Ethel, starting up. “That is famous. We should always\nhave Margaret at home when he goes to sea!”\n\n“But mind, Ethel, for your life you must not say one word to any living\ncreature.”\n\n“Oh, no, I promise you I won’t, Norman, if you’ll only tell me how you\nfound it out.”\n\n“What first put it in my head was the first evening, while I was undoing\nthe portmanteau; my father leaned on the mantel-shelf, and sighed and\nmuttered, ‘Poor Ernescliffe! I wish it may end well.’ I thought he\nforgot that I was there, so I would not seem to notice, but I soon saw\nit was that he meant.”\n\n“How?” cried Ethel eagerly.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know--by Alan’s way.”\n\n“Tell me--I want to know what people do when they are in love.”\n\n“Nothing particular,” said Norman, smiling.\n\n“Did you hear him inquire for her? How did he look?”\n\n“I can’t tell. That was when he met us at the station before I thought\nof it, and I had to see to the luggage. But I’ll tell you one thing,\nEthel; when papa was talking of her to Mrs. Mackenzie, at the other end\nof the room, all his attention went away in an instant from what he was\nsaying. And once, when Harry said something to me about her, he started,\nand looked round so earnestly.”\n\n“Oh, yes--that’s like people in books. And did he colour?”\n\n“No; I don’t recollect that he did,” said Norman; “but I observed he\nnever asked directly after her if he could help it, but always was\ntrying to lead, in some round-about way, to hearing what she was doing.”\n\n“Did he call her Margaret?”\n\n“I watched; but to me he always said, ‘Your sister,’ and if he had to\nspeak of her to papa, he said, ‘Miss May.’ And then you should have seen\nhis attention to papa. I could hardly get a chance of doing anything for\npapa.”\n\n“Oh, sure of it!” cried Ethel, clasping her hands. “But, poor man, how\nunhappy he must have been at having to go away when she was so ill!”\n\n“Ay, the last time he saw her was when he carried her upstairs.”\n\n“Oh, dear! I hope he will soon come here again!”\n\n“I don’t suppose he will. Papa did not ask him.”\n\n“Dear me, Norman! Why not? Isn’t papa very fond of him? Why shouldn’t he\ncome?”\n\n“Don’t you see, Ethel, that would be of no use while poor Margaret is no\nbetter. If he gained her affections, it would only make her unhappy.”\n\n“Oh, but she is much better. She can raise herself up now without\nhelp, and sat up ever so long this morning, without leaning back on her\ncushions. She is getting well--you know Sir Matthew said she would.”\n\n“Yes; but I suppose papa thinks they had better say nothing till she is\nquite well.”\n\n“And when she is! How famous it will be.”\n\n“Then there’s another thing; he is very poor, you know.”\n\n“I am sure papa doesn’t care about people being rich.”\n\n“I suppose Alan thinks he ought not to marry, unless he could make his\nwife comfortable.”\n\n“Look here--it would be all very easy: she should stay with us, and be\ncomfortable here, and he go to sea, and get lots of prize money.”\n\n“And that’s what you call domestic felicity!” said Norman, laughing.\n\n“He might have her when he was at home,” said Ethel.\n\n“No, no; that would never do,” said Norman. “Do you think Ernescliffe’s\na man that would marry a wife for her father to maintain her?”\n\n“Why, papa would like it very much. He is not a mercenary father in a\nbook.”\n\n“Hey! what’s that?” said a voice Ethel little expected. “Contraband talk\nat contraband times? What’s this!”\n\n“Did you hear, papa?” said Ethel, looking down.\n\n“Only your last words, as I came up to ask Norman what he had done with\nmy pocket-book. Mind, I ask no impertinent questions; but, if you have\nno objection, I should like to know what gained me the honour of that\ncompliment.”\n\n“Norman?” said Ethel interrogatively, and blushing in emulation of her\nbrother, who was crimson.\n\n“I’ll find it,” said he, rushing off with a sort of nod and sign, that\nconveyed to Ethel that there was no help for it.\n\nSo, with much confusion, she whispered into her papa’s ear that Norman\nhad been telling her something he guessed about Mr. Ernescliffe.\n\nHer father at first smiled, a pleased amused smile. “Ah! ha! so Master\nJune has his eyes and ears open, has he? A fine bit of gossip to regale\nyou with on his return!”\n\n“He told me to say not one word,” said Ethel.\n\n“Right--mind you don’t,” said Dr. May, and Ethel was surprised to see\nhow sorrowful his face became. At the same moment Norman returned,\nstill very red, and said, “I’ve put out the pocket-book, papa. I think\nI should tell you I repeated what, perhaps, you did not mean me to\nhear--you talked to yourself something of pitying Ernescliffe.” The\ndoctor smiled again at the boy’s high-minded openness, which must have\ncost an effort of self-humiliation. “I can’t say little pitchers have\nlong ears, to a May-pole like you, Norman,” said he; “I think I ought\nrather to apologise for having inadvertently tumbled in among your\nsecrets; I assure you I did not come to spy you.”\n\n“Oh, no, no, no, no!” repeated Ethel vehemently. “Then you didn’t mind\nour talking about it?”\n\n“Of course not, as long as it goes no further. It is the use of sisters\nto tell them one’s private sentiments. Is not it, Norman?”\n\n“And do you really think it is so, papa?” Ethel could not help\nwhispering.\n\n“I’m afraid it is”, said Dr. May, sighing; then, as he caught her\nearnest eyes, “The more I see of Alan, the finer fellow I think him,\nand the more sorry I am for him. It seems presumptuous, almost wrong, to\nthink of the matter at all while my poor Margaret is in this state; and,\nif she were well, there are other difficulties which would, perhaps,\nprevent his speaking, or lead to long years of waiting and wearing out\nhope.”\n\n“Money?” said Ethel.\n\n“Ay! Though I so far deserve your compliment, miss, that should be\nfoolish enough, if she were but well, to give my consent to-morrow,\nbecause I could not help it; yet one can’t live forty-six years in\nthis world without seeing it is wrong to marry without a reasonable\ndependence--and there won’t be much among eleven of you. It makes my\nheart ache to think of it, come what may, as far as I can see, and\nwithout her to judge. The only comfort is, that poor Margaret herself\nknows nothing of it, and is at peace so far. It will be ordered for\nthem, anyhow. Good-night, my dear.”\n\nEthel sought her room, with graver, deeper thoughts of life than she had\ncarried upstairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n\n     Saw ye never in the meadows,\n       Where your little feet did pass,\n     Down below, the sweet white daisies\n       Growing in the long green grass?\n\n     Saw you never lilac blossoms,\n       Or acacia white and red,\n     Waving brightly in the sunshine,\n       On the tall trees over head?\n                           HYMNS FOR CHILDREN, C. F. A.\n\n\n“My dear child, what a storm you have had! how wet you must be!”\n exclaimed Mrs. Larpent, as Meta Rivers came bounding up the broad\nstaircase at Abbotstoke Grange.\n\n“Oh no; I am quite dry; feel.”\n\n“Are you sure?” said Mrs. Larpent, drawing her darling into a luxurious\nbedroom, lighted up by a glowing fire, and full of pretty things. “Here,\ncome and take off your wet things, my dear, and Bellairs shall bring you\nsome tea.”\n\n“I’m dry. I’m warm,” said Meta, tossing off her plumy hat, as she\nestablished herself, with her feet on the fender. “But where do you\nthink I have been? You have so much to hear. But first--three guesses\nwhere we were in the rain!”\n\n“In the Stoneborough Cloisters, that you wanted to see? My dear, you did\nnot keep your papa in the cold there?”\n\n“No, no; we never got there at all; guess again.”\n\n“At Mr. Edward Wilmot’s?”\n\n“No!”\n\n“Could it have been at Dr. May’s? Really, then, you must tell me.”\n\n“There! you deserve a good long story; beginning at the beginning,” said\nMeta, clapping her hands, “wasn’t it curious? as we were coming up the\nlast hill, we met some girls in deep mourning, with a lady who looked\nlike their governess. I wondered whether they could be Dr. May’s\ndaughters, and so it turned out they were.\n\n“Presently there began to fall little square lumps, neither hail, nor\nsnow, nor rain; it grew very cold, and rain came on. It would have been\ngreat fun, if I had not been afraid papa would catch cold, and he said\nwe would canter on to the inn. But, luckily, there was Dr. May walking\nup the street, and he begged us to come into his house. I was so glad!\nWe were tolerably wet, and Dr. May said something about hoping the girls\nwere at home; well, when he opened the drawing-room door, there was the\npoor daughter lying on the sofa.”\n\n“Poor girl! tell me of her.”\n\n“Oh! you must go and see her; you won’t look at her without losing your\nheart. Papa liked her so much--see if he does not talk of her all the\nevening. She looks the picture of goodness and sweetness. Only think\nof her having some of the maidenhair and cape jessamine still in water,\nthat we sent her so long ago. She shall have some flowers every three\ndays. Well, Dr. May said, ‘There is one at least, that is sure to be\nat home.’ She felt my habit, and said I must go and change it, and\nshe called to a little thing of six, telling her to show me the way to\nFlora. She smiled, and said she wished she could go herself, but Flora\nwould take care of me. Little Blanche came and took hold of my hand,\nchattering away, up we went, up two staircases, and at the top of the\nlast stood a girl about seventeen, so pretty! such deep blue eyes, and\nsuch a complexion! ‘That’s Flora,’ little Blanche said; ‘Flora, this is\nMiss Rivers, and she’s wet, and Margaret says you are to take care of\nher.’”\n\n“So that was your introduction?”\n\n“Yes; we got acquainted in a minute. She took me into her room--such a\nroom! I believe Bellairs would be angry if she had such a one; all up\nin the roof, no fire, no carpet, except little strips by the beds; there\nwere three beds. Flora used to sleep there till Miss May was ill, and\nnow she dresses there. Yet I am sure they are as much ladies as I am.”\n\n“You are an only daughter, my dear, and a petted one,” said Mrs.\nLarpent, smiling. “There are too many of them to make much of, as we do\nof our Meta.”\n\n“I suppose so; but I did not know gentlewomen lived in such a way,”\n said Meta. “There were nice things about, a beautiful inlaid work-box of\nFlora’s, and a rosewood desk, and plenty of books, and a Greek book and\ndictionary were spread open. I asked Flora if they were hers, and she\nlaughed and said no; and that Ethel would be much discomposed that I had\nsee them. Ethel keeps up with her brother Norman--only fancy! and he at\nthe head of the school. How clever she must be!”\n\n“But, my dear, were you standing in your wet things all this time!”\n\n“No; I was trying on their frocks, but they trailed on the ground upon\nme, so she asked if I would come and sit by the nursery fire till my\nhabit was dry; and there was a dear little good-humoured baby, so fair\nand pretty. She is not a bit shy, will go to anybody, but, they say, she\nlikes no one so well as her brother Norman.”\n\n“So you had a regular treat of baby-nursing.”\n\n“That I had; I could not part with her, the darling. Flora thought we\nmight take her down, and I liked playing with her in the drawing-room\nand talking to Miss May, till the fly came to take us home. I wanted to\nhave seen Ethel; but, only think, papa has asked Dr. May to bring Flora\nsome day; how I hope he will!”\n\nLittle Meta having told her story, and received plenty of sympathy,\nproceeded to dress, and, while her maid braided her hair, a musing fit\nfell upon her. “I have seen something of life to-day,” thought she. “I\nhad thought of the great difference between us and the poor, but I did\nnot know ladies lived in such different ways. I should be very miserable\nwithout Bellairs, or without a fire in my room. I don’t know what I\nshould do if I had to live in that cold, shabby den, and do my own hair,\nyet they think nothing of it, and they are cultivated and ladylike! Is\nit all fancy, and being brought up to it? I wonder if it is right? Yet\ndear papa likes me to have these things, and can afford them. I never\nknew I was luxurious before, and yet I think I must be! One thing I do\nwish, and that is, that I was of as much use as those girls. I ought to\nbe. I am a motherless girl like them, and I ought to be everything to\npapa, just as Miss May is, even lying on the sofa there, and only two\nyears older than I am. I don’t think I am of any use at all; he is fond\nof me, of course, dear papa; and if I died, I don’t know what would\nbecome of him; but that’s only because I am his daughter--he has only\nGeorge besides to care for. But, really and truly, he would get on as\nwell without me. I never do anything for him, but now and then playing\nto him in the evening, and that not always, I am afraid, when I want\nto be about anything else. He is always petting me, and giving me all I\nwant, but I never do anything but my lessons, and going to the school,\nand the poor people, and that is all pleasure. I have so much that I\nnever miss what I give away. I wonder whether it is all right! Leonora\nand Agatha have not so much money to do as they please with--they are\nnot so idolised. George said, when he was angry, that papa idolises\nme; but they have all these comforts and luxuries, and never think of\nanything but doing what they like. They never made me consider as these\nMays do. I should like to know them more. I do so much want a friend of\nmy own age. It is the only want I have. I have tried to make a friend of\nLeonora, but I cannot; she never cares for what I do. If she saw these\nMays she would look down on them. Dear Mrs. Larpent is better than any\none, but then she is so much older. Flora May shall be my friend. I’ll\nmake her call me Meta as soon as she comes. When will it be? The day\nafter tomorrow?”\n\nBut little Meta watched in vain. Dr. May always came with either Richard\nor the groom, to drive him, and if Meta met him and hoped he would bring\nFlora next time, he only answered that Flora would like it very much,\nand he hoped soon to do so.\n\nThe truth was, it was no such everyday matter as Meta imagined. The\nlarger carriage had been broken, and the only vehicle held only the\ndoctor--his charioteer--and in a very minute appendage behind, a small\nson of the gardener, to open gates, and hold the horse.\n\nThe proposal had been one of those general invitations to be fulfilled\nat any time, and therefore easily set aside; and Dr. May, though\ncontinually thinking he should like to take his girls to Abbotstoke,\nnever saw the definite time for so doing; and Flora herself, though\ncharmed with Miss Rivers, and delighted with the prospect of visiting\nher, only viewed it as a distant prospect.\n\nThere was plenty of immediate interest to occupy them at home, to say\nnothing of the increasing employment that Cocksmoor gave to thoughts,\nlegs, and needles. There was the commencement of the half-year, when\nTom’s schoolboy life was to begin, and when it would be proved whether\nNorman were able to retain his elevation.\n\nMargaret had much anxiety respecting the little boy about to be sent\ninto a scene of temptation. Her great confidence was in Richard, who\ntold her that boys did many more wrong things than were known at home,\nand yet turned out very well, and that Tom would be sure to right\nhimself in the end. Richard had been blameless in his whole school\ncourse, but though never partaking of the other boys’ evil practices,\nhe could not form an independent estimate of character, and his tone had\nbeen a little hurt, by sharing the school public opinion of morality. He\nthought Stoneborough and its temptations inevitable, and only wished to\nmake the best of it. Margaret was afraid to harass her father by laying\nthe case before him. All her brothers had gone safely through the\nschool, and it never occurred to her that it was possible that, if her\nfather knew the bias of Tom’s disposition, he might choose, for the\npresent, at least, some other mode of education.\n\nShe talked earnestly to Tom, and he listened impatiently. There is an\nage when boys rebel against female rule, and are not yet softened by the\nchivalry of manhood, and Tom was at this time of life. He did not like\nto be lectured by a sister, secretly disputed her right, and, proud of\nbecoming a schoolboy, had not the generous deference for her weakness\nfelt by his elder brothers; he was all the time peeling a stick, as\nif to show that he was not attending, and he raised up his shoulder\npettishly whenever she came to a mention of the religious duty of\nsincerity. She did not long continue her advice, and, much disappointed\nand concerned, tried to console herself with hoping that he might have\nheeded more than he seemed to do.\n\nHe was placed tolerably high in the school, and Norman, who had the\nfirst choice of fags, took him instead of Hector Ernescliffe, who had\njust passed beyond the part of the school liable to be fagged. He said\nhe liked school, looked bright when he came home in the evenings, and\nthe sisters hoped all was right.\n\nEvery one was just now anxiously watching Norman, especially his father,\nwho strove in vain to keep back all manifestation of his earnest desire\nto see him retain his post. Resolutely did the doctor refrain from\nasking any questions, when the boys came in, but he could not keep his\neyes from studying the face, to see whether it bore marks of mental\nfatigue, and from following him about the room, to discover whether he\nfound it necessary, as he had done last autumn, to spend the evening in\nstudy. It was no small pleasure to see him come in with his hand full of\nhorse-chestnut and hazel-buds, and proceed to fetch the microscope and\nbotany books, throwing himself eagerly into the study of the wonders\nof their infant forms, searching deeply into them with Margaret, and\ntalking them over with his father, who was very glad to promote the\npursuit--one in which he had always taken great interest.\n\nAnother night Dr. May was for a moment disturbed by seeing the\nschool-books put out, but Norman had only some notes to compare, and\nwhile he did so, he was remarking on Flora’s music, and joining in the\nconversation so freely as to prove it was no labour to him. In truth,\nhe was evidently quite recovered, entirely himself again, except that he\nwas less boyish. He had been very lively and full of merry nonsense; but\nhis ardour for play had gone off with his high spirits, and there was\na manliness of manner, and tone of mind, that made him appear above his\nreal age.\n\nAt the end of a fortnight he volunteered to tell his father that all\nwas right. “I am not afraid of not keeping my place,” he said; “you were\nquite right, papa. I am more up to my work than I was ever before, and\nit comes to me quite fresh and pleasant. I don’t promise to get the\nRandall scholarship, if Forder and Cheviot stay on, but I can quite keep\nup to the mark in school work.”\n\n“That’s right,” said Dr. May, much rejoiced. “Are you sure you do it\nwith ease, and without its haunting you at night?”\n\n“Oh, yes; quite sure. I can’t think what has made Dr. Hoxton set us on\nin such easy things this time. It is very lucky for me, for one gets so\nmuch less time to oneself as dux.”\n\n“What! with keeping order?”\n\n“Ay,” said Norman. “I fancy they think they may take liberties because I\nam new and young. I must have my eye in all corners of the hall at once,\nand do my own work by snatches, as I can.”\n\n“Can you make them attend to you?”\n\n“Why, yes, pretty well, when it comes to the point--‘will you, or will\nyou not?’ Cheviot is a great help, too, and has all the weight of being\nthe eldest fellow amongst us.”\n\n“But still you find it harder work than learning? You had rather have to\nmaster the dead language than the live tongues?”\n\n“A pretty deal,” said Norman; then added, “One knows what to be at with\nthe dead, better than with the living; they don’t make parties against\none. I don’t wonder at it. It was very hard on some of those great\nfellows to have me set before them, but I do not think it is fair to\nvisit it by putting up the little boys to all sorts of mischief.”\n\n“Shameful!” said the doctor warmly; “but never mind, Norman, keep your\ntemper, and do your own duty, and you are man enough to put down such\npetty spite.”\n\n“I hope I shall manage rightly,” said Norman; “but I shall be glad if I\ncan get the Randall and get away to Oxford; school is not what it used\nto be, and if you don’t think me too young--”\n\n“No, I don’t; certainly not. Trouble has made a man of you, Norman, and\nyou are fitter to be with men than boys. In the meantime, if you can\nbe patient with these fellows, you’ll be of great use where you are. If\nthere had been any one like you at the head of the school in my time, it\nwould have kept me out of no end of scrapes. How does Tom get on? he is\nnot likely to fall into this set, I trust.”\n\n“I am not sure,” said Norman; “he does pretty well on the whole. Some\nof them began by bullying him, and that made him cling to Cheviot and\nErnescliffe, and the better party; but lately I have thought Anderson,\njunior, rather making up to him, and I don’t know whether they don’t\nthink that tempting him over to them would be the surest way of vexing\nme. I have an eye over him, and I hope he may get settled into the\nsteadier sort before next half.”\n\nAfter a silence, Norman said, “Papa, there is a thing I can’t settle in\nmy own mind. Suppose there had been wrong things done when older boys,\nand excellent ones too, were at the head of the school, yet they never\ninterfered, do you think I ought to let it go on?”\n\n“Certainly not, or why is power given to you?”\n\n“So I thought,” said Norman; “I can’t see it otherwise. I wish I could,\nfor it will be horrid to set about it, and they’ll think it a regular\nshame in me to meddle. Oh! I know what I came into the study for; I\nwant you to be so kind as to lend me your pocket Greek Testament. I gave\nHarry my little one.”\n\n“You are very welcome. What do you want it for?”\n\nNorman coloured. “I met with a sermon the other day that recommended\nreading a bit of it every day, and I thought I should like to try, now\nthe Confirmation is coming. One can always have some quiet by getting\naway into the cloister.”\n\n“Bless you, my boy! while you go on in this way, I have not much fear\nbut that you’ll know how to manage.”\n\nNorman’s rapid progress affected another of the household in an\nunexpected way.\n\n“Margaret, my dear, I wish to speak to you,” said Miss Winter,\nreappearing when Margaret thought every one was gone out walking.\nShe would have said, “I am very sorry for it”--so ominous was the\ncommencement--and her expectations were fulfilled when Miss Winter had\nsolemnly seated herself, and taken out her netting. “I wished to speak\nto you about dear Ethel,” said the governess; “you know how unwilling\nI always am to make any complaint, but I cannot be satisfied with her\npresent way of going on.”\n\n“Indeed,” said Margaret. “I am much grieved to hear this. I thought she\nhad been taking great pains to improve.”\n\n“So she was at one time. I would not by any means wish to deny it, and\nit is not of her learning that I speak, but of a hurried, careless way\nof doing everything, and an irritability at being interfered with.”\n\nMargaret knew how Miss Winter often tried Ethel’s temper, and was\ninclined to take her sister’s part. “Ethel’s time is so fully occupied,”\n she said.\n\n“That is the very thing that I was going to observe, my dear. Her time\nis too much occupied, and my conviction is, that it is hurtful to a girl\nof her age.”\n\nThis was a new idea to Margaret, who was silent, longing to prove\nMiss Winter wrong, and not have to see poor Ethel pained by having to\nrelinquish any of her cherished pursuits.\n\n“You see there is that Cocksmoor,” said Miss Winter. “You do not know\nhow far off it is, my dear; much too great a distance for a young girl\nto be walking continually in all weathers.”\n\n“That’s a question for papa,” thought Margaret.\n\n“Besides,” continued Miss Winter, “those children engross almost all her\ntime and thoughts. She is working for them, preparing lessons, running\nafter them continually. It takes off her whole mind from her proper\noccupations, unsettles her, and I do think it is beyond what befits a\nyoung lady of her age.”\n\nMargaret was silent.\n\n“In addition,” said Miss Winter, “she is at every spare moment busy\nwith Latin and Greek, and I cannot think that to keep pace with a boy of\nNorman’s age and ability can be desirable for her.”\n\n“It is a great deal,” said Margaret, “but--”\n\n“I am convinced that she does more than is right,” continued Miss\nWinter. “She may not feel any ill effects at present, but you may depend\nupon it, it will tell on her by-and-by. Besides, she does not attend to\nanything properly. At one time she was improving in neatness and orderly\nhabits. Now, you surely must have seen how much less tidy her hair and\ndress have been.”\n\n“I have thought her hair looking rather rough,” said Margaret\ndisconsolately.\n\n“No wonder,” said Miss Winter, “for Flora and Mary tell me she hardly\nspends five minutes over it in the morning, and with a book before her\nthe whole time. If I send her up to make it fit to be seen, I meet with\nlooks of annoyance. She leaves her books in all parts of the school-room\nfor Mary to put away, and her table drawer is one mass of confusion. Her\nlessons she does well enough, I own, though what I should call much too\nfast; but have you looked at her work lately?”\n\n“She does not work very well,” said Margaret, who was at that moment,\nthough Miss Winter did not know it, re-gathering a poor child’s frock\nthat Ethel had galloped through with more haste than good speed.\n\n“She works a great deal worse than little Blanche,” said Miss Winter,\n“and though it may not be the fashion to say so in these days, I\nconsider good needlework far more important than accomplishments. Well,\nthen, Margaret, I should wish you only just to look at her writing.”\n\nAnd Miss Winter opened a French exercise-book, certainly containing\nanything but elegant specimens of penmanship. Ethel’s best writing was\nan upright, disjointed niggle, looking more like Greek than anything\nelse, except where here and there it made insane efforts to become\nrunning-hand, and thereby lost its sole previous good quality of\nlegibility, while the lines waved about the sheet in almost any\ndirection but the horizontal. The necessity she believed herself under\nof doing what Harry called writing with the end of her nose, and\nher always holding her pen with her fingers almost in the ink, added\nconsiderably to the difficulty of the performance. This being at her\nbest, the worst may be supposed to be indescribable, when dashed off in\na violent hurry, and considerably garnished with blots. Margaret thought\nshe had seen the worst, and was sighing at being able to say nothing for\nit, when Miss Winter confounded her by turning a leaf, and showing it\nwas possible to make a still wilder combination of scramble, niggle,\nscratch, and crookedness--and this was supposed to be an amended\nedition! Miss Winter explained that Ethel had, in an extremely short\ntime, performed an exercise in which no fault could be detected except\nthe writing, which was pronounced to be too atrocious to be shown up to\nM. Ballompre. On being desired to write it over again, she had obeyed\nwith a very bad grace, and some murmurs about Cocksmoor, and produced\nthe second specimen, which, in addition to other defects, had some\nelisions from arrant carelessness, depriving it of its predecessor’s\nmerits of being good French.\n\nMiss Winter had been so provoked that she believed this to be an effect\nof ill temper, and declared that she should certainly have kept Ethel at\nhome to write it over again, if it had not so happened that Dr. May had\nproposed to walk part of the way with her and Richard, and the governess\nwas unwilling to bring her into disgrace with him. Margaret was so\ngrateful to her for this forbearance, that it disposed her to listen\nthe more patiently to the same representations put in, what Miss Winter\nfancied, different forms. Margaret was much perplexed. She could not but\nsee much truth in what Miss Winter said, and yet she could not bear\nto thwart Ethel, whom she admired with her whole heart; and that dry\nexperience, and prejudiced preciseness, did not seem capable of entering\ninto her sister’s thirst for learning and action. When Miss Winter said\nEthel would grow up odd, eccentric, and blue, Margaret was ready to\nanswer that she would be superior to every one; and when the governess\nurged her to insist on Cocksmoor being given up, she felt impatient of\nthat utter want of sympathy for the good work.\n\nAll that evening Margaret longed for a quiet time to reflect, but it\nnever came till she was in bed; and when she had made up her mind how to\nspeak to Ethel, it was five times harder to secure her alone. Even when\nMargaret had her in the room by herself, she looked wild and eager, and\nsaid she could not stay, she had some Thucydides to do.\n\n“Won’t you stay with me a little while, quietly?” said Margaret; “we\nhardly ever have one of our talks.”\n\n“I didn’t mean to vex you, dear Margaret; I like nothing so well, only\nwe are never alone, and I’ve no time.”\n\n“Pray do spare me a minute, Ethel, for I have something that I must say\nto you, and I am afraid you won’t like it--so do listen kindly.”\n\n“Oh!” said Ethel, “Miss Winter has been talking to you. I know she said\nshe would tell you that she wants me to give up Cocksmoor. You aren’t\ndreaming of it, Margaret?”\n\n“Indeed, dear Ethel, I should be very sorry, but one thing I am sure of,\nthat there is something amiss in your way of going on.”\n\n“Did she show you that horrid exercise?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, I know it was baddish writing, but just listen, Margaret. We\npromised six of the children to print them each a verse of a hymn on a\ncard to learn. Ritchie did three, and then could not go on, for the\nbook that the others were in was lost till last evening, and then he\nwas writing for papa. So I thought I would do them before we went to\nCocksmoor, and that I should squeeze time out of the morning; but I got\na bit of Sophocles that was so horridly hard it ate up all my time, and\nI don’t understand it properly now; I must get Norman to tell me. And\nthat ran in my head and made me make a mistake in my sum, and have\nto begin it again. Then, just as I thought I had saved time over the\nexercise, comes Miss Winter and tells me I must do it over again, and\nscolds me besides about the ink on my fingers. She would send me up at\nonce to get it off, and I could not find nurse and her bottle of stuff\nfor it, so that wasted ever so much more time, and I was so vexed that,\nreally and truly, my hand shook and I could not write any better.”\n\n“No, I thought it looked as if you had been in one of your agonies.”\n\n“And she thought I did it on purpose, and that made me angry, and so\nwe got into a dispute, and away went all the little moment I might have\nhad, and I was forced to go to Cocksmoor as a promise breaker!”\n\n“Don’t you think you had better have taken pains at first?”\n\n“Well, so I did with the sense, but I hadn’t time to look at the writing\nmuch.”\n\n“You would have made better speed if you had.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I know I was wrong, but it is a great plague altogether.\nReally, Margaret, I shan’t get Thucydides done.”\n\n“You must wait a little longer, please, Ethel, for I want to say to\nyou that I am afraid you are doing too much, and that prevents you from\ndoing things well, as you were trying to do last autumn.”\n\n“You are not thinking of my not going to Cocksmoor?” cried Ethel\nvehemently.\n\n“I want you to consider what is to be done, dear Ethel. You thought,\nlast autumn, a great deal of curing your careless habits, now you seem\nnot to have time to attend. You can do a great deal very fast, I know,\nbut isn’t it a pity to be always in a hurry?”\n\n“It isn’t Cocksmoor that is the reason,” said Ethel.\n\n“No; you did pretty well when you began, but you know that was in the\nholidays, when you had no Latin and Greek to do.”\n\n“Oh, but, Margaret, they won’t take so much time when I have once got\nover the difficulties, and see my way, but just now they have put Norman\ninto such a frightfully difficult play, that I can hardly get on at all\nwith it, and there’s a new kind of Greek verses, too, and I don’t make\nout from the book how to manage them. Norman showed me on Saturday, but\nmine won’t be right. When I’ve got over that, I shan’t be so hurried.”\n\n“But Norman will go on to something harder, I suppose.”\n\n“I dare say I shall be able to do it.”\n\n“Perhaps you might, but I want you to consider if you are not working\nbeyond what can be good for anybody. You see Norman is much cleverer\nthan most boys, and you are a year younger; and besides doing all his\nwork at the head of the school, his whole business of the day, you have\nCocksmoor to attend to, and your own lessons, besides reading all the\nbooks that come into the house. Now isn’t that more than is reasonable\nto expect any head and hands to do properly?”\n\n“But if I can do it?”\n\n“But can you, dear Ethel? Aren’t you always racing from one thing to\nanother, doing them by halves, feeling hunted, and then growing vexed?”\n\n“I know I have been cross lately,” said Ethel, “but it’s the being so\nbothered.”\n\n“And why are you bothered? Isn’t it that you undertake too much?”\n\n“What would you have me do?” said Ethel, in an injured, unconvinced\nvoice. “Not give up my children?”\n\n“No,” said Margaret; “but don’t think me very unkind if I say, suppose\nyou left off trying to keep up with Norman.”\n\n“Oh, Margaret! Margaret!” and her eyes filled with tears. “We have\nhardly missed doing the same every day since the first Latin grammar was\nput into his hands!”\n\n“I know it would be very hard,” said Margaret; but Ethel continued, in a\npiteous tone, a little sentimental, “From hie haec hoc up to Alcaics and\nbeta Thukididou we have gone on together, and I can’t bear to give it\nup. I’m sure I can--”\n\n“Stop, Ethel, I really doubt whether you can. Do you know that Norman\nwas telling papa the other day that it was very odd Dr. Hoxton gave them\nsuch easy lessons.”\n\nEthel looked very much mortified.\n\n“You see,” said Margaret kindly, “we all know that men have more power\nthan women, and I suppose the time has come for Norman to pass beyond\nyou. He would not be cleverer than any one, if he could not do more than\na girl at home.”\n\n“He has so much more time for it,” said Ethel.\n\n“That’s the very thing. Now consider, Ethel. His work, after he goes to\nOxford, will be doing his very utmost--and you know what an utmost that\nis. If you could keep up with him at all, you must give your whole time\nand thoughts to it, and when you had done so--if you could get all\nthe honours in the University--what would it come to? You can’t take a\nfirst-class.”\n\n“I don’t want one,” said Ethel; “I only can’t bear not to do as Norman\ndoes, and I like Greek so much.”\n\n“And for that would you give up being a useful, steady daughter and\nsister at home? The sort of woman that dear mamma wished to make you,\nand a comfort to papa.”\n\nEthel was silent, and large tears were gathering.\n\n“You own that that is the first thing?”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel faintly.\n\n“And that it is what you fail in most?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then, Ethel dearest, when you made up your mind to Cocksmoor, you knew\nthose things could not be done without a sacrifice?”\n\n“Yes, but I didn’t think it would be this.”\n\nMargaret was wise enough not to press her, and she sat down and sighed\npitifully. Presently she said, “Margaret, if you would only let me leave\noff that stupid old French, and horrid dull reading with Miss Winter,\nI should have plenty of time for everything; and what does one learn by\nhearing Mary read poetry she can’t understand?”\n\n“You work, don’t you? But indeed, Ethel, don’t say that I can let you\nleave off anything. I don’t feel as if I had that authority. If it be\ndone at all, it must be by papa’s consent, and if you wish me to ask\nhim about it, I will, only I think it would vex Miss Winter; and I don’t\nthink dear mamma would have liked Greek and Cocksmoor to swallow up all\nthe little common ladylike things.”\n\nEthel made two or three great gulps; “Margaret, must I give up\neverything, and forget all my Latin and Greek?”\n\n“I should think that would be a great pity,” said Margaret. “If you were\nto give up the verse-making, and the trying to do as much as Norman, and\nfix some time in the day--half an hour, perhaps--for your Greek, I think\nit might do very well.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Ethel, much relieved; “I’m glad you don’t want me to\nleave it all off. I hope Norman won’t be vexed,” she added, looking a\nlittle melancholy.\n\nBut Norman had not by any means the sort of sentiment on the subject\nthat she had. “Of course, you know, Ethel,” said he, “it must have come\nto this some time or other, and if you find those verses too hard, and\nthat they take up too much of your time, you had better give them up.”\n\nEthel did not like anything to be said to be too hard for her, and was\nvery near pleading she only wanted time, but some recollection came\nacross her, and presently she said, “I suppose it is a wrong sort of\nambition to want to learn more, in one’s own way, when one is told it\nis not good for one. I was just going to say I hated being a woman,\nand having these tiresome little trifles--my duty--instead of learning,\nwhich is yours, Norman.”\n\n“I’m glad you did not,” said Norman, “for it would have been very silly\nof you; and I assure you, Ethel, it is really time for you to stop, or\nyou would get into a regular learned lady, and be good for nothing. I\ndon’t mean that knowing more than other people would make you so, but\nminding nothing else would.”\n\nThis argument from Norman himself did much to reconcile Ethel’s mind to\nthe sacrifice she had made; and when she went to bed, she tried to work\nout the question in her own mind, whether her eagerness for classical\nlearning was a wrong sort of ambition, to know what other girls did not,\nand whether it was right to crave for more knowledge than was thought\nadvisable for her. She only bewildered herself, and went to sleep before\nshe had settled anything, but that she knew she must make all give way\nto papa first, and, secondly, to Cocksmoor.\n\nMeanwhile Margaret had told her father all that had passed. He was\nonly surprised to hear that Ethel had kept up so long with Norman, and\nthought that it was quite right that she should not undertake so much,\nagreeing more entirely than Margaret had expected with Miss Winter’s\nview, that it would be hurtful to body as well as mind.\n\n“It is perfectly ridiculous to think of her attempting it!” he said. “I\nam glad you have put a stop to it.”\n\n“I am glad I have,” said Margaret; “and dear Ethel behaved so very well.\nIf she had resisted, it would have puzzled me very much, I must have\nasked you to settle it. But it is very odd, papa, Ethel is the one of\nthem all who treats me most as if I had real authority over her; she\nlets me scold her, asks my leave, never seems to recollect for a moment\nhow little older I am, and how much cleverer she is. I am sure I\nnever should have submitted so readily. And that always makes it more\ndifficult to me to direct her; I don’t like to take upon me with her,\nbecause it seems wrong to have her obeying me as if she were a mere\nchild.”\n\n“She is a fine creature,” said Dr. May emphatically. “It just shows the\nfact, the higher the mind the readier the submission. But you don’t mean\nthat you have any difficulty with the others?”\n\n“Oh, no, no. Flora never could need any interference, especially from\nme, and Mary is a thorough good girl. I only meant that Ethel lays\nherself out to be ruled in quite a remarkable way. I am sure, though she\ndoes love learning, her real love is for goodness and for you, papa.”\n\nEthel would have thought her sacrifice well paid for, had she seen her\nfather’s look of mournful pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\n\n     O ruthful scene! when from a nook obscure,\n     His little sister doth his peril see,\n     All playful as she sate, she grows demure,\n     She finds full soon her wonted spirits flee,\n     She meditates a prayer to set him free.\n                                          SHENSTONE.\n\n\nThe setting sun shone into the great west window of the school at\nStoneborough, on its bare walls, the masters’ desks, the forms polished\nwith use, and the square, inky, hacked and hewed chests, carved with the\nnames of many generations of boys.\n\nAbout six or eight little boys were clearing away the books or papers\nthat they, or those who owned them as fags, had left astray, and a good\ndeal of talk and laughing was going on among them. “Ha!” exclaimed one,\n“here has Harrison left his book behind him that he was showing us the\ngladiators in!” and, standing by the third master’s desk, he turned\nover a page or two of Smith’s ‘Antiquities’, exclaiming, “It is full of\npictures--here’s an old man blowing the bellows--”\n\n“Let me see!” cried Tom May, precipitating himself across the benches\nand over the desk, with so little caution, that there was an outcry;\nand, to his horror, he beheld the ink spilled over Mr. Harrison’s book,\nwhile, “There, August! you’ve been and done it!” “You’ll catch it!”\n resounded on all sides.\n\n“What good will staring with your mouth open do!” exclaimed Edward\nAnderson, the eldest present. “Here! a bit of blotting-paper this\nmoment!”\n\nTom, dreadfully frightened, handed a sheet torn from an old paper-case\nthat he had inherited from Harry, saying despairingly, “It won’t take it\nout, will it?”\n\n“No, little stupid head, but don’t you see, I’m stopping it from running\ndown the edges, or soaking in. He won’t be the wiser till he opens it\nagain at that place.”\n\n“When he does, he will,” said the bewildered Tom.\n\n“Let him. It won’t tell tales.”\n\n“He’s coming!” cried another boy, “he is close at the door.”\n\nAnderson hastily shut the book over the blotting-paper, which he did not\nventure to retain in his hand, dragged Tom down from the desk, and\nwas apparently entirely occupied with arranging his own box, when Mr.\nHarrison came in. Tom crouched behind the raised lid, quaking in every\nlimb, conscious he ought to confess, but destitute of resolution to do\nso, and, in a perfect agony as the master went to his desk, took up the\nbook, and carried it away, so unconscious, that Larkins, a great wag,\nonly waited till his back was turned, to exclaim, “Ha! old fellow, you\ndon’t know what you’ve got there!”\n\n“Hallo! May junior, will you never leave off staring? you won’t see a\nbit farther for it,” said Edward Anderson, shaking him by the ear; “come\nto your senses, and know your friends.”\n\n“He’ll open it!” gasped Tom.\n\n“So he will, but I’d bet ninety to one, it is not at that page, or if\nhe does, it won’t tell tales, unless, indeed, he happened to see you\nstanding there, crouching and shaking. That’s the right way to bring him\nupon you.”\n\n“But suppose he opens it, and knows who was in school?”\n\n“What then? D’ye think we can’t stand by each other, and keep our own\ncounsel?”\n\n“But the blotting-paper--suppose he knows that!”\n\nThere was a laugh all round at this, “as if Harrison knew everyone’s\nblotting-paper!”\n\n“Yes, but Harry used to write his name all over his--see--and draw Union\nJacks on it.”\n\n“If he did, the date is not there. Do you think the ink is going to say\nMarch 2nd? Why should not July have done it last half?”\n\n“July would have told if he had,” said Larkins. “That’s no go.”\n\n“Ay! That’s the way--the Mays are all like girls--can’t keep a\nsecret--not one of them. There, I’ve done more for you than ever one of\nthem would have done--own it--and he strode up to Tom, and grasped his\nwrists, to force the confession from him.”\n\n“But--but he’ll ask when he finds it out--”\n\n“Let him. We know nothing about it. Don’t be coming the good boy over\nme like your brothers. That won’t do--I know whose eyes are not too\nshort-sighted to read upside down.”\n\nTom shrank and looked abject, clinging to the hope that Mr. Harrison\nwould not open the book for weeks, months, or years.\n\nBut the next morning his heart died within him, when he beheld the\nunfortunate piece of blotting-paper, displayed by Mr. Harrison, with the\ninquiry whether any one knew to whom it belonged, and what made it worse\nwas, that his sight would not reach far enough to assure him whether\nHarry’s name was on it, and he dreaded that Norman or Hector Ernescliffe\nshould recognise the nautical designs. However, both let it pass, and\nno one through the whole school attempted to identify it. One danger was\npast, but the next minute Mr. Harrison opened his Smith’s ‘Antiquities’\nat the page where stood the black witness. Tom gazed round in despair,\nhe could not see his brother’s face, but Edward Anderson, from the\nsecond form, returned him a glance of contemptuous encouragement.\n\n“This book,” said Mr. Harrison, “was left in school for a quarter of an\nhour yesterday. When I opened it again, it was in this condition. Do any\nof you know how it happened?” A silence, and he continued, “Who was in\nschool at this time? Anderson junior, can you tell me anything of it?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“You know nothing of it?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\nCold chills crept over Tom, as Mr. Harrison looked round to refresh his\nmemory. “Larkins, do you know how this happened?”\n\n“No, sir,” said Larkins boldly, satisfying his conscience because he had\nnot seen the manner of the overthrow.\n\n“Ernescliffe, were you there?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\nTom’s timid heart fluttered in dim hope that he had been overlooked, as\nMr. Harrison paused, then said, “Remember, it is concealment that is the\nevil, not the damage to the book. I shall have a good opinion ever after\nof a boy honest enough to confess, May junior, I saw you,” he added,\nhopefully and kindly. “Don’t be afraid to speak out if you did meet with\na mischance.”\n\nTom coloured and turned pale. Anderson and Larkins grimaced at him, to\nremind him that they had told untruths for his sake, and that he must\nnot betray them. It was the justification he wanted; he was relieved\nto fancy himself obliged to tell the direct falsehood, for which a long\ncourse of petty acted deceits had paved the way, for he was in deadly\nterror of the effects of truth.\n\n“No, sir.” He could hardly believe he had said the words, or that they\nwould be so readily accepted, for Mr. Harrison had only the impression\nthat he knew who the guilty person was, and would not tell, and,\ntherefore, put no more questions to him, but, after a few more vain\ninquiries, was baffled, and gave up the investigation.\n\nTom thought he should have been very unhappy; he had always heard that\ndeceit was a heavy burden, and would give continual stings, but he was\nsurprised to find himself very comfortable on the whole, and able to\ndismiss repentance as well as terror. His many underhand ways with\nRichard had taken away the tenderness of his conscience, though his\nknowledge of what was right was clear; and he was quite ready to accept\nthe feeling prevalent at Stoneborough, that truth was not made for\nschoolboys.\n\nThe axiom was prevalent, but not universal, and parties were\nrunning high. Norman May, who as head boy had, in play-hours, the\nresponsibility, and almost the authority of a master, had taken higher\nground than was usual even with the well-disposed; and felt it his duty\nto check abuses and malpractices that his predecessors had allowed. His\nfriend, Cheviot, and the right-minded set, maintained his authority\nwith all their might; but Harvey Anderson regarded his interference as\nvexatious, always took the part of the offenders, and opposed him in\nevery possible way, thus gathering as his adherents not only the idle\nand mischievous, but the weak and mediocre, and, among this set,\nthere was a positive bitterness of feeling to May, and all whom they\nconsidered as belonging to him.\n\nIn shielding Tom May and leading him to deceive, the younger Anderson\nhad gained a conquest--in him the Mays had fallen from that pinnacle\nof truth which was a standing reproach to the average Stoneborough\ncode--and, from that time, he was under the especial patronage of his\nfriend. He was taught the most ingenious arts of saying a lesson without\nlearning it, and of showing up other people’s tasks; whispers and signs\nwere directed to him to help him out of difficulties, and he was sought\nout and put forward whenever a forbidden pleasure was to be enjoyed by\nstealth. These were his stimulants under a heavy bondage; he was teased\nand frightened, bullied and tormented, whenever it was the fancy of Ned\nAnderson and his associates to make his timidity their sport; he\nwas scorned and ill-treated, and driven, by bodily terror, into acts\nalarming to his conscience, dangerous in their consequences, and painful\nin the perpetration; and yet, among all his sufferings, the little\ncoward dreaded nothing so much as truth, though it would have set him\nfree at once from this wretched tyranny.\n\nExcepting on holidays, and at hours when the town-boys were allowed to\ngo home, there were strict rules confining all except the sixth form\nto their bounds, consisting of two large courts, and an extensive field\nbordered by the river and the road. On the opposite side of the\nbridge was a turnpike gate, where the keeper exposed stalls of various\neatables, very popular among the boys, chiefly because they were not\nallowed to deal there. Ginger-beer could also be procured, and\nthere were suspicions that the bottles so called contained something\ncontraband.\n\n“August,” said Norman, as they were coming home from school one evening,\n“did I see you coming over the bridge?”\n\nTom would not answer.\n\n“So you have been at Ballhatchet’s gate? I can’t think what could take\nyou there. If you want tarts, I am sure poor old Betty’s are just as\ngood. What made you go there?”\n\n“Nothing,” said Tom.\n\n“Well, mind you don’t do it again, or I shall have to take you in hand,\nwhich I shall be very sorry to do. That man is a regular bad character,\nand neither my father nor Dr. Hoxton would have one of us have anything\nto do with him, as you know.”\n\nTom was in hopes it was over, but Norman went on. “I am afraid you are\ngetting into a bad way. Why won’t you mind what I have told you plenty\nof times before, that no good comes of going after Ned Anderson, and\nAxworthy, and that set. What were you doing with them to-day?” But,\nreceiving no answer, he went on. “You always sulk when I speak to you.\nI suppose you think I have no right to row you, but I do it to save you\nfrom worse. You can’t never be found out.” This startled Tom, but Norman\nhad no suspicion. “If you go on, you will get into some awful scrape,\nand papa will be grieved. I would not, for all the world, have him put\nout of heart about you. Think of him, Tom, and try to keep straight.”\n Tom would say nothing, only reflecting that his elder brother was harder\nupon him than any one else would be, and Norman grew warmer. “If you let\nAnderson junior get hold of you, and teach you his tricks, you’ll\nnever be good for anything. He seems good-natured now, but he will turn\nagainst you, as he did with Harry. I know how it is, and you had better\ntake my word, and trust to me and straightforwardness, when you get into\na mess.”\n\n“I’m in no scrape,” said Tom, so doggedly, that Norman lost patience,\nand spoke with more displeasure. “You will be then, if you go out of\nbounds, and run Anderson’s errands, and shirk work. You’d better take\ncare. It is my place to keep order, and I can’t let you off for being my\nbrother; so remember, if I catch you going to Ballhatchet’s again, you\nmay make sure of a licking.”\n\nSo the warning closed--Tom more alarmed at the aspect of right, which he\nfancied terrific, and Norman with some compunction at having lost temper\nand threatened, when he meant to have gained him by kindness.\n\nNorman recollected his threat with a qualm of dismay when, at the end of\nthe week, as he was returning from a walk with Cheviot, Tom darted out\nof the gate-house. He was flying across the bridge, with something under\nhis arm, when Norman laid a detaining hand on his collar, making a sign\nat the same time to Cheviot to leave them.\n\n“What are you doing here?” said Norman sternly, marching Tom into the\nfield. “So you’ve been there again. What’s that under your jacket?”\n\n“Only--only what I was sent for,” and he tried to squeeze it under the\nflap.\n\n“What is it? a bottle--”\n\n“Only--only a bottle of ink.”\n\nNorman seized it, and gave Tom a fierce angry shake, but the indignation\nwas mixed with sorrow. “Oh, Tom, Tom, these fellows have brought you a\npretty pass. Who would have thought of such a thing from us!”\n\nTom cowered, but felt only terror.\n\n“Speak truth,” said Norman, ready to shake it out of him; “is this for\nAnderson junior?”\n\nUnder those eyes, flashing with generous, sorrowful wrath, he dared\nnot utter another falsehood, but Anderson’s threats chained him, and he\npreferred his thraldom to throwing himself on the mercy of his brother\nwho loved him. He would not speak.\n\n“I am glad it is not for yourself,” said Norman; “but do you remember\nwhat I said, in case I found you there again?”\n\n“Oh! don’t, don’t!” cried the boy. “I would never have gone if they had\nnot made me.”\n\n“Made you?” said Norman, disdainfully, “how?”\n\n“They would have thrashed me--they pinched my fingers in the box--they\npulled my ears--oh, don’t--”\n\n“Poor little fellow!” said Norman; “but it is your own fault. If you\nwon’t keep with me, or Ernescliffe, of course they will bully you. But\nI must not let you off--I must keep my word!” Tom cried, sobbed, and\nimplored in vain. “I can’t help it,” he said, “and now, don’t howl! I\nhad rather no one knew it. It will soon be over. I never thought to have\nthis to do to one of us.” Tom roared and struggled, till, releasing\nhim, he said, “There, that will do. Stop bellowing, I was obliged, and I\ncan’t have hurt you much, have I?” he added more kindly, while Tom went\non crying, and turning from him. “It is nothing to care about, I am\nsure; look up;” and he pulled down his hands. “Say you are sorry--speak\nthe truth--keep with me, and no one shall hurt you again.”\n\nVery different this from Tom’s chosen associates; but he was still\nobdurate, sullen, and angry, and would not speak, nor open his heart to\nthose kind words. After one more, “I could not help it, Tom, you’ve no\nbusiness to be sulky,” Norman took up the bottle, opened it, smelled,\nand tasted, and was about to throw it into the river; when Tom\nexclaimed, “Oh, don’t, don’t! what will they do to me? give it to me!”\n\n“Did they give you the money to pay for it?”\n\n“Yes; let me have it.”\n\n“How much was it?”\n\n“Fourpence.”\n\n“I’ll settle that,” and the bottle splashed in the river. “Now then,\nTom, don’t brood on it any more. Here’s a chance for you of getting quit\nof their errands. If you will keep in my sight. I’ll take care no one\nbullies you, and you may still leave off these disgraceful tricks, and\ndo well.”\n\nBut Tom’s evil spirit whispered that Norman had beaten him, that he\nshould never have any diversion again, and that Anderson would punish\nhim; and there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing that his perverse\nsilence really distressed his brother.\n\n“If you will go on in this way, I can’t help it, but you’ll be sorry\nsome day,” said Norman, and he walked thoughtfully on, looking back to\nsee whether Tom was following, as he did slowly, meditating on the way\nhow he should avert his tyrant’s displeasure.\n\nNorman stood for a moment at the door, surveying the court, then walked\nup to a party of boys, and laid his hand on the shoulder of one, holding\na silver fourpence to him. “Anderson Junior,” said he, “there’s your\nmoney. I am not going to let Stoneborough School be turned into a gin\npalace. I give you notice, it is not to be. Now you are not to bully May\njunior for telling me. He did not, I found him out.”\n\nLeaving Anderson to himself he looked for Tom, but not seeing him,\nhe entered the cloister, for it was the hour when he was used to read\nthere, but he could not fix his mind. He went to the bench where he had\nlain on the examination day, and kneeling on it, looked out on the green\ngrass where the graves were. “Mother! mother!” he murmured, “have I been\nharsh to your poor little tender sickly boy? I couldn’t help it. Oh! if\nyou were but here! We are all going wrong! What shall I do? How should\nTom be kept from this evil?--it is ruining him! mean, false, cowardly,\nsullen--all that is worst--and your son--oh! mother! and all I do only\nmakes him shrink more from me. It will break my father’s heart, and you\nwill not be there to comfort him.”\n\nNorman covered his face with his hands, and a fit of bitter grief\ncame over him. But his sorrow was now not what it had been before his\nfather’s resignation had tempered it, and soon it turned to prayer,\nresolution, and hope.\n\nHe would try again to reason quietly with him, when the alarm of\ndetection and irritation should have gone off, and he sought for the\noccasion; but, alas! Tom had learned to look on all reproof as “rowing,”\n and considered it as an additional injury from a brother, who, according\nto the Anderson view, should have connived at his offences, and turned\na deafened ear and dogged countenance to all he said. The foolish boy\nsought after the Andersons still more, and Norman became more dispirited\nabout him, greatly missing Harry, that constant companion and follower,\nwho would have shared his perplexities, and removed half of them, in his\nown part of the school, by the influence of his high, courageous, and\ntruthful spirit.\n\nIn the meantime Richard was studying hard at home, with greater\nhopefulness and vigour than he had ever thrown into his work before.\n“Suppose,” Ethel had once said to him, “that when you are a clergyman,\nyou could be Curate of Cocksmoor, when there is a church there.”\n\n“When?” said Richard, smiling at the presumption of the scheme, and\nyet it formed itself into a sort of definite hope. Perhaps they might\npersuade Mr. Ramsden to take him as a curate with a view to Cocksmoor,\nand this prospect, vague as it was, gave an object and hope to his\nstudies. Every one thought the delay of his examination favourable\nto him, and he now read with a determination to succeed. Dr. May had\noffered to let him read with Mr. Harrison but Richard thought he was\ngetting on pretty well, with the help Norman gave him; for it appeared\nthat ever since Norman’s return from London, he had been assisting\nRichard, who was not above being taught by a younger brother; while, on\nthe other hand, Norman, much struck by his humility, would not for the\nworld have published that he was fit to act as his elder’s tutor.\n\nOne evening, when the two boys came in from school, Tom gave a great\nstart, and, pulling Mary by the sleeve, whispered, “How came that book\nhere?”\n\n“It is Mr. Harrison’s.”\n\n“Yes, I know, but how came it here?”\n\n“Richard borrowed it to look out something, and Ethel brought it down.”\n\nA little reassured, Tom took up an exciting story-book, and ensconced\nhimself by the fire, but his agonies were great during the ensuing\nconversation.\n\n“Norman,” Ethel was exclaiming in delight, “do you know this book?”\n\n“Smith? Yes, it is in the school library.”\n\n“There’s everything in it that one wants, I do believe. Here is such an\naccount of ancient galleys--I never knew how they managed their banks of\nrowers before--oh! and the Greek houses--look at the pictures too.”\n\n“Some of them are the same as Mr. Rivers’s gems,” said Norman, standing\nbehind her, and turning the leaves, in search of a favourite.\n\n“Oh! what did I see? is that ink?” said Flora, from the opposite side of\nthe table.\n\n“Yes, didn’t you hear?” said Ethel. “Mr. Harrison told Ritchie when he\nborrowed it, that unluckily one day this spring he left it in school,\nand some of the boys must have upset an inkstand over it; but, though he\nasked them all round, each denied it. How I should hate for such things\nto happen! and it was a prize-book too.”\n\nWhile Ethel spoke she opened the marked page, to show the extent of the\ncalamity, and as she did so Mary exclaimed, “Dear me! how funny! why,\nhow did Harry’s blotting-paper get in there?”\n\nTom shrank into nothing, set his teeth, and pinched his fingers, ready\nto wish they were on Mary’s throat, more especially as the words made\nsome sensation. Richard and Margaret exchanged looks, and their father,\nwho had been reading, sharply raised his eyes and said, “Harry’s\nblotting-paper! How do you know that, Mary?”\n\n“It is Harry’s,” said she, all unconscious, “because of that anchor up\nin one corner, and the Union Jack in the other. Don’t you see, Ethel?”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel; “nobody drew that but Harry.”\n\n“Ay, and there are his buttons,” said Mary, much amused and delighted\nwith these relics of her beloved Harry. “Don’t you remember one day\nlast holidays, papa desired Harry to write and ask Mr. Ernescliffe what\nclothes he ought to have for the naval school, and all the time he\nwas writing the letter, he was drawing sailors’ buttons on his\nblotting-paper. I wonder how ever it got into Mr. Harrison’s book!”\n\nPoor Mary’s honest wits did not jump to a conclusion quite so fast as\nother people’s, and she little knew what she was doing when, as a great\ndiscovery, she exclaimed, “I know! Harry gave his paper-case to Tom.\nThat’s the way it got to school!”\n\n“Tom!” exclaimed his father, suddenly and angrily, “where are you\ngoing?”\n\n“To bed,” muttered the miserable Tom, twisting his hands. A dead silence\nof consternation fell on all the room. Mary gazed from one to the other,\nmystified at the effect of her words, frightened at her father’s loud\nvoice, and at Tom’s trembling confusion. The stillness lasted for\nsome moments, and was first broken by Flora, as if she had caught at\na probability. “Some one might have used the first blotting-paper that\ncame to hand.”\n\n“Come here, Tom,” said the doctor, in a voice not loud, but trembling\nwith anxiety; then laying his hand on his shoulder, “Look in my face.”\n Tom hung his head, and his father put his hand under his chin, and\nraised the pale terrified face. “Don’t be afraid to tell us the meaning\nof this. If any of your friends have done it, we will keep your secret.\nLook up, and speak out. How did your blotting-paper come there?”\n\nTom had been attempting his former system of silent sullenness, but\nthere was anger at Mary, and fear of his father to agitate him, and in\nhis impatient despair at thus being held and questioned, he burst out\ninto a violent fit of crying.\n\n“I can’t have you roaring here to distress Margaret,” said Dr. May.\n“Come into the study with me.”\n\nBut Tom, who seemed fairly out of himself, would not stir, and a\nscreaming and kicking scene took place, before he was carried into the\nstudy by his brothers, and there left with his father. Mary, meantime,\ndreadfully alarmed, and perceiving that, in some way, she was the cause,\nhad thrown herself upon Margaret, sobbing inconsolably, as she begged to\nknow what was the matter, and why papa was angry with Tom--had she made\nhim so?\n\nMargaret caressed and soothed her to the best of her ability, trying\nto persuade her that, if Tom had done wrong, it was better for him it\nshould be known, and assuring her that no one could think her unkind,\nnor a tell-tale; then dismissing her to bed, and Mary was not unwilling\nto go, for she could not bear to meet Tom again, only begging in a\nwhisper to Ethel, “that, if dear Tom had not done it, she would come and\ntell her.”\n\n“I am afraid there is no hope of that!” sighed Ethel, as the door closed\non Mary.\n\n“After all,” said Flora, “he has not said anything. If he has only done\nit, and not confessed, that is not so bad--it is only the usual fashion\nof boys.”\n\n“Has he been asked? Did he deny it?” said Ethel, looking in Norman’s\nface, as if she hardly ventured to put the question, and she only\nreceived sorrowful signs as answers. At the same moment Dr. May called\nhim. No one spoke. Margaret rested her head on the sofa, and looked\nvery mournful, Richard stood by the fire without moving limb or feature,\nFlora worked fast, and Ethel leaned back on an arm-chair, biting the end\nof a paper-knife.\n\nThe doctor and Norman came back together. “I have sent him up to bed,”\n said Dr. May. “I must take him to Harrison to-morrow morning. It is a\nterrible business!”\n\n“Has he confessed it?” said Margaret.\n\n“I can hardly call such a thing a confession--I wormed it out bit by\nbit--I could not tell whether he was telling truth or not, till I called\nNorman in.”\n\n“But he has not said anything more untrue--”\n\n“Yes, he has though!” said Dr. May indignantly. “He said Ned Anderson\nput the paper there, and had been taking up the ink with it--‘twas\nhis doing--then when I came to cross-examine him I found that though\nAnderson did take up the ink, it was Tom himself who knocked it down--I\nnever heard anything like it--I never could have believed it!”\n\n“It must all be Ned Anderson’s doing!” cried Flora. “They are enough to\nspoil anybody.”\n\n“I am afraid they have done him a great deal of harm,” said Norman.\n\n“And what have you been about all the time?” exclaimed the doctor, too\nkeenly grieved to be just. “I should have thought that with you at the\nhead of the school, the child might have been kept out of mischief; but\nthere have you been going your own way, and leaving him to be ruined by\nthe very worst set of boys!”\n\nNorman’s colour rose with the extreme pain this unjust accusation caused\nhim, and his voice, though low, was not without irritation, “I have\ntried. I have not done as much as I ought, perhaps, but--”\n\n“No, I think not, indeed!” interrupted his father. “Sending a boy there,\nbrought up as he had been, without the least tendency to deceit--”\n\nHere no one could see Norman’s burning cheeks, and brow bent downwards\nin the effort to keep back an indignant reply, without bursting out in\nexculpation; and Richard looked up, while the three sisters all at once\nbegan, “Oh, no, no, papa”--and left Margaret to finish--“Poor little Tom\nhad not always been quite sincere.”\n\n“Indeed! and why was I left to send him to school without knowing it?\nThe place of all others to foster deceit.”\n\n“It was my fault, papa,” said Margaret.\n\n“And mine,” put in Richard; and she continued, “Ethel told us we were\nvery wrong, and I wish we had followed her advice. It was by far the\nbest, but we were afraid of vexing you.”\n\n“Every one seems to have been combined to hide what they ought not!”\n said Dr. May, though speaking to her much more softly than to Norman, to\nwhom he turned angrily again. “Pray, how came you not to identify this\npaper?”\n\n“I did not know it,” said Norman, speaking with difficulty. “He ought\nnever to have been sent to school,” said the doctor--“that tendency was\nthe very worst beginning.”\n\n“It was a great pity; I was very wrong,” said Margaret, in great\nconcern.\n\n“I did not mean to blame you, my dear,” said her father affectionately.\n“I know you only meant to act for the best, but--” and he put his hand\nover his face, and then came the sighing groan, which pained Margaret\nten thousand times more than reproaches, and which, in an instant,\ndispersed all the indignation burning within Norman, though the pain\nremained at his father’s thinking him guilty of neglect, but he did not\nlike, at that moment, to speak in self-justification.\n\nAfter a short space, Dr. May desired to hear what were the deceptions\nto which Margaret had alluded, and made Norman tell what he knew of the\naffair of the blotted book. Ethel spoke hopefully when she had heard it.\n“Well, do you know, I think he will do better now. You see, Edward made\nhim conceal it, and he has been going on with it on his mind, and in\nthat boy’s power ever since; but now it is cleared up and confessed, he\nwill begin afresh and do better. Don’t you think so, Norman? don’t you,\npapa?”\n\n“I should have more hope if I had seen anything like confession or\nrepentance,” said Dr. May; “but that provoked me more than all--I\ncould only perceive that he was sorry to be found out, and afraid of\npunishment.”\n\n“Perhaps, when he has recovered the first fright, he will come to his\nbetter self,” said Margaret; for she guessed, what indeed was the case,\nthat the doctor’s anger on this first shock of the discovery of the\nfault he most abhorred had been so great, that a fearful cowering spirit\nwould be completely overwhelmed; and, as there had been no sorrow shown\nfor the fault, there had been none of that softening and relenting that\nwon so much love and confidence.\n\nEvery one felt that talking only made them more unhappy, they tried to\nreturn to their occupations, and so passed the time till night. Then, as\nRichard was carrying Margaret upstairs, Norman lingered to say, “Papa, I\nam very sorry you should think I neglected Tom. I dare say I might have\ndone better for him, but, indeed, I have tried.”\n\n“I am sure you have, Norman. I spoke hastily, my boy--you will not think\nmore of it. When a thing like this comes on a man, he hardly knows what\nhe says.”\n\n“If Harry were here,” said Norman, anxious to turn from the real loss\nand grief, as well as to talk away that feeling of being apologised to,\n“it would all do better. He would make a link with Tom, but I have so\nlittle, naturally, to do with the second form, that it is not easy to\nkeep him in sight.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I know that very well. It is no one’s fault but my own; I\nshould not have sent him there without knowing him better. But you see\nhow it is, Norman--I have trusted to her, till I have grown neglectful,\nand it is well if it is not the ruin of him!”\n\n“Perhaps he will take a turn, as Ethel says,” answered Norman\ncheerfully. “Good-night, papa.”\n\n“I have a blessing to be thankful for in you, at least,” murmured the\ndoctor to himself. “What other young fellow of that age and spirit would\nhave borne so patiently with my injustice? Not I, I am sure! a fine\nfather I show myself to these poor children--neglect, helplessness,\ntemper--Oh, Maggie!”\n\nMargaret had so bad a headache the next day that she could not come\ndownstairs. The punishment was, they heard, a flogging at the time, and\nan imposition so long, that it was likely to occupy a large portion\nof the play-hours till the end of the half-year. His father said, and\nNorman silently agreed, “a very good thing, it will keep him out of\nmischief;” but Margaret only wished she could learn it for him, and took\nupon herself all the blame from beginning to end. She said little to her\nfather, for it distressed him to see her grieved; he desired her not to\ndwell on the subject, caressed her, called her his comfort and support,\nand did all he could to console her, but it was beyond his power; her\nsisters, by listening to her, only made her worse. “Dear, dear papa,”\n she exclaimed, “how kind he is! But he can never depend upon me again--I\nhave been the ruin of my poor little Tom.”\n\n“Well,” said Richard quietly, “I can’t see why you should put yourself\ninto such a state about it.”\n\nThis took Margaret by surprise. “Have not I done very wrong, and perhaps\nhurt Tom for life?”\n\n“I hope not,” said Richard. “You and I made a mistake, but it does not\nfollow that Tom would have kept out of this scrape, if we had told my\nfather our notion.”\n\n“It would not have been on my conscience,” said Margaret--“he would not\nhave sent him to school.”\n\n“I don’t know that,” said Richard. “At any rate we meant to do right,\nand only made a mistake. It was unfortunate, but I can’t tell why you go\nand make yourself ill, by fancying it worse than it is. The boy has\ndone very wrong, but people get cured of such things in time, and it is\nnonsense to fret as if he were not a mere child of eight years old. You\ndid not teach him deceit.”\n\n“No, but I concealed it--papa is disappointed, when he thought he could\ntrust me.”\n\n“Well! I suppose no one could expect never to make mistakes,” said\nRichard, in his sober tone.\n\n“Self-sufficiency!” exclaimed Margaret, “that has been the root of all!\nDo you know, Ritchie, I believe I was expecting that I could always\njudge rightly.”\n\n“You generally do,” said Richard; “no one else could do half what you\ndo.”\n\n“So you have said, papa, and all of you, till you have spoilt me. I have\nthought it myself, Ritchie.”\n\n“It is true,” said Richard.\n\n“But then,” said Margaret, “I have grown to think much of it, and not\nlike to be interfered with. I thought I could manage by myself, and when\nI said I would not worry papa, it was half because I liked the doing\nand settling all about the children myself. Oh! if it could have been\nvisited in any way but by poor Tom’s faults!”\n\n“Well,” said Richard, “if you felt so, it was a pity, though I never\nshould have guessed it. But you see you will never feel so again, and as\nTom is only one, and there are nine to govern, it is all for the best.”\n\nHis deliberate common-sense made her laugh a little, and she owned he\nmight be right. “It is a good lesson against my love of being first. But\nindeed it is difficult--papa can so little bear to be harassed.”\n\n“He could not at first, but now he is strong and well, it is different.”\n\n“He looks terribly thin and worn still,” sighed Margaret, “so much\nolder!”\n\n“Ay, I think he will never get back his young looks; but except his weak\narm, he is quite well.”\n\n“And then his--his quick way of speaking may do harm.”\n\n“Yes, that was what I feared for Tom,” said Richard, “and there was the\nmistake. I see it now. My father always is right in the main, though\nhe is apt to frighten one at first, and it is what ought to be that he\nshould rule his own house. But now, Margaret, it is silly to worry about\nit any more--let me fetch baby, and don’t think of it.”\n\nAnd Margaret allowed his reasonableness, and let herself be comforted.\nAfter all, Richard’s solid soberness had more influence over her than\nanything else.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\n\n     Think how simple things and lowly,\n       Have a part in Nature’s plan,\n     How the great hath small beginnings,\n       And the child will be a man.\n     Little efforts work great actions,\n       Lessons in our childhood taught\n     Mould the spirit of that temper\n       Whereby blessed deeds are wrought.\n     Cherish, then, the gifts of childhood,\n       Use them gently, guard them well,\n     For their future growth and greatness\n       Who can measure, who can tell!\n                                    MORAL SONGS.\n\n\nThe first shock of Tom’s misdemeanour passed away, though it still gave\nmany an anxious thought to such of the family as felt responsible for\nhim.\n\nThe girls were busily engaged in preparing an Easter feast for\nCocksmoor. Mr. Wilmot was to examine the scholars, and buns and tea were\nprovided, in addition to which Ethel designed to make a present to every\none--a great task, considering that the Cocksmoor funds were reserved\nfor absolute necessaries, and were at a very low ebb. So that\ntwenty-five gifts were to be composed out of nothing!\n\nThere was a grand turn-out of drawers of rubbish, all over Margaret,\nraising such a cloud of dust as nearly choked her. What cannot rubbish\nand willing hands effect! Envelopes and wafer boxes were ornamented with\npictures, bags, needle-cases, and pincushions, beautiful balls, tippets,\nboth of list and gay print, and even sun-bonnets and pinafores were\ncontrived, to the supreme importance and delight of Mary and Blanche,\nwho found it as good or better than play, and ranged their performances\nin rows, till the room looked like a bazaar. To provide for boys was\nmore difficult; but Richard mended old toys, and repaired the frames of\nslates, and Norman’s contribution of half-a-crown bought mugs, marbles,\nand penny knives, and there were even hopes that something would remain\nfor bodkins, to serve as nozzles to the bellows, which were the pride of\nBlanche’s heart.\n\nNever were Easter gifts the source of more pleasure to the givers,\nespecially when the nursery establishment met Dr. Hoxton near the\npastrycook’s shop, and he bestowed on Blanche a packet of variegated\nsugar-plums, all of which she literally poured out at Ethel’s feet,\nsaying, “I don’t want them. Only let me have one for Aubrey, because he\nis so little. All the rest are for the poor children at Cocksmoor.”\n\nAfter this, Margaret declared that Blanche must be allowed to buy the\nbodkin, and give her bellows to Jane Taylor, the only Cocksmoor child\nshe knew, and to whom she always destined in turn every gift that she\nthought most successful.\n\nSo Blanche went with Flora to the toy-shop, and there fell in love with\na little writing-box, that so eclipsed the bellows, that she tried to\npersuade Flora to buy it for Jane Taylor, to be kept till she could\nwrite, and was much disappointed to hear that it was out of the\nquestion. Just then a carriage stopped, and from it stepped the pretty\nlittle figure of Meta Rivers.\n\n“Oh! how do you do? How delightful to meet you! I was wondering if we\nshould! Little Blanche too!” kissing her, “and here’s Mrs. Larpent--Mrs.\nLarpent--Miss Flora May. How is Miss May?”\n\nThis was all uttered in eager delight, and Flora, equally pleased,\nanswered the inquiries. “I hope you are not in a hurry,” proceeded Meta;\n“I want your advice. You know all about schools, don’t you? I am come\nto get some Easter presents for our children, and I am sure you can help\nme.”\n\n“Are the children little or big?” asked Flora.\n\n“Oh! all sorts and sizes. I have some books for the great sensible ones,\nand some stockings and shoes for the tiresome stupid ones, but there are\nsome dear little pets that I want nice things for. There--there’s a doll\nthat looks just fit for little curly-headed Annie Langley, don’t you\nthink so, Mrs. Larpent?”\n\nThe price of the doll was a shilling, and there were quickly added to\nit, boxes of toys, elaborate bead-work pincushions, polished blue and\ngreen boxes, the identical writing-case--even a small Noah’s ark. Meta\nhardly asked the prices, which certainly were not extravagant, since she\nhad nearly twenty articles for little more than a pound.\n\n“Papa has given me a benefaction of £5 for my school-gifts,” said she,\n“is not that charming? I wish you would come to the feast. Now, do! It\nis on Easter Tuesday. Won’t you come?”\n\n“Thank you, I am afraid we can’t. I should like it very much.”\n\n“You never will come to me. You have no compassion.”\n\n“We should enjoy coming very much. Perhaps, in the summer, when Margaret\nis better.”\n\n“Could not she spare any of you? Well, I shall talk to papa, and make\nhim talk to Dr. May. Mrs. Larpent will tell you I always get my way.\nDon’t I? Good-bye. See if I don’t.”\n\nShe departed, and Flora returned to her own business; but Blanche’s\ninterest was gone. Dazzled by the more lavish gifts, she looked\nlistlessly and disdainfully at bodkins, three for twopence. “I wish I\nmight have bought the writing-box for Janet Taylor! Why does not papa\ngive us money to get pretty things for the children?” said she, as soon\nas they came out.\n\n“Because he is not so rich as Miss Rivers’s papa.”\n\nFlora was interrupted by meeting the Misses Anderson, who asked, “Was\nnot that carriage Mr. Rivers’s of Abbotstoke Grange?”\n\n“Yes. We like Miss Rivers very much,” said Flora, resolved to show that\nshe was acquainted.\n\n“Oh! do you visit her? I knew he was a patient of Dr. May.” Flora\nthought there was no need to tell that the only call had been owing to\nthe rain, and continued, “She has been begging us to come to her school\nfeast, but I do not think we can manage it.”\n\n“Oh, indeed! the Grange is very beautiful, is it not?”\n\n“Very,” said Flora. “Good-morning.”\n\nFlora had a little uneasiness in her conscience, but it was satisfactory\nto have put down Louisa Anderson, who never could aspire to an intimacy\nwith Miss Rivers. Her little sister looked up--“Why, Flora, have you\nseen the Grange?”\n\n“No, but papa and Norman said so.”\n\nAnd Blanche showed that the practical lesson on the pomps of the world\nwas not lost on her, by beginning to wish they were as rich as Miss\nRivers. Flora told her it was wrong to be discontented, but the answer\nwas, “I don’t want it for myself, I want to have pretty things to give\naway.”\n\nAnd her mind could not be turned from the thought by any attempt of her\nsister. Even when they met Dr. May coming out of the hospital, Blanche\nrenewed the subject. She poured out the catalogue of Miss Rivers’s\npurchases, making appealing attempts at looking under his spectacles\ninto his eyes, and he perfectly understood the tenor of her song.\n\n“I have had a sight, too, of little maidens preparing Easter gifts,”\n said he.\n\n“Have you, papa? What were they? Were they as nice as Miss Rivers’s?”\n\n“I don’t know, but I thought they were the best sort of gifts, for I saw\nthat plenty of kind thought and clever contrivance went to them, ay, and\nsome little self-denial too.”\n\n“Papa, you look as if you meant something; but ours are nothing but\nnasty old rubbish.”\n\n“Perhaps some fairy, or something better, has brought a wand to touch\nthe rubbish, Blanche; for I think that the maidens gave what would have\nbeen worthless kept, but became precious as they gave it.”\n\n“Do you mean the list of our flannel petticoats, papa, that Mary has\nmade into a tippet?”\n\n“Perhaps I meant Mary’s own time and pains, as well as the tippet. Would\nshe have done much good with them otherwise?”\n\n“No, she would have played. Oh! then you like the presents because they\nare our own making? I never thought of that. Was that the reason you did\nnot give us any of your sovereigns to buy things with?”\n\n“Perhaps I want my sovereigns for the eleven gaping mouths at home,\nBlanche. But would not it be a pity to spoil your pleasure? You would\nhave lost all the chattering and laughing and buzzing I have heard round\nMargaret of late, and I am quite sure Miss Rivers can hardly be as happy\nin the gifts that cost her nothing, as one little girl who gives her\nsugar-plums out of her own mouth!”\n\nBlanche clasped her papa’s hand tight, and bounded five or six times.\n“They are our presents, not yours,” said she. “Yes, I see. I like them\nbetter now.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” said the doctor. “Seeing Miss Rivers’s must not take the shine\nout of yours, my little maids; for if you can’t give much, you have the\npleasure of giving the best of all, your labour of love.” Then thinking\non, and speaking to Flora, “The longer I live, the more I see the\nblessing of being born in a state of life where you can’t both eat your\ncake and give it away.”\n\nFlora never was at ease in a conversation with her father; she could\nnot follow him, and did not like to show it. She answered aside from the\nmark, “You would not have Blanche underrate Miss Rivers?”\n\n“No, indeed, she is as good and sweet a creature as ever came across\nme--most kind to Margaret, and loving to all the world. I like to see\none whom care and grief have never set their grip upon. Most likely she\nwould do like Ethel, if she had the opportunity, but she has not.”\n\n“So she has not the same merit?” said Flora.\n\n“We don’t talk of merit. I mean that the power of sacrifice is a great\nadvantage. The habit of small sacrifice that is made necessary in a\nlarge family is a discipline that only-children are without: and so,\nwith regard to wealth, I think people are to be pitied who can give\nextensively out of such abundance that they can hardly feel the want.”\n\n“In effect, they can do much more,” said Flora.\n\n“I am not sure of that. They can, of course, but it must be at the cost\nof personal labour and sacrifice. I have often thought of the words,\n‘Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee.’ And ‘such\nas we have’ it is that does the good; the gold, if we have it, but, at\nany rate, the personal influence; the very proof of sincerity, shown by\nthe exertion and self-denial, tells far more than money lightly come by,\nlightly spent.”\n\n“Do you mean that a person who maintained a whole school would do less\ngood than one who taught one child?”\n\n“If the rich person take no pains, and leave the school to take care\nof itself--nay, if he only visit it now and then, and never let it\ninconvenience him, has he the least security that the scholars are\nobtaining any real good from it? If the teacher of the one child is\ndoing his utmost, he is working for himself at least.”\n\n“Suppose we could build, say our church and school, on Cocksmoor at\nonce, and give our superintendence besides?”\n\n“If things were ripe for it, the means would come. As it is, it is a\nfine field for Ethel and Richard. I believe it will be the making of\nthem both. I am sure it is training Ethel, or making her train herself,\nas we could never have done without it. But here, come in and see old\nMrs. Robins. A visit from you will cheer her up.”\n\nFlora was glad of the interruption, the conversation was uncomfortable\nto her. She almost fancied her papa was moralising for their good, but\nthat he carried it too far, for wealthy people assuredly had it in their\npower to do great things, and might work as hard themselves; besides, it\nwas finer in them, there was so much eclat in their stooping to charity.\nBut her knowledge of his character would not allow her to think for a\nmoment that he could say aught but from the bottom of his heart--no, it\nwas one of his one-sided views that led him into paradox. “It was just\nlike papa,” and so there was no need to attend to it. It was one of\nhis enthusiasms, he was so very fond of Ethel, probably because of her\nlikeness to himself. Flora thought Ethel put almost too forward--they\nall helped at Cocksmoor, and Ethel was very queer and unformed, and\ncould do nothing by herself. The only thing Flora did keep in her mind\nwas, that her papa had spoken to her, as if she were a woman compared\nwith Ethel.\n\nLittle Blanche made her report of the conversation to Mary, “that it was\nso nice; and now she did not care about Miss Rivers’s fine presents at\nall, for papa said what one made oneself was better to give than what\none bought. And papa said, too, that it was a good thing not to be rich,\nfor then one never felt the miss of what one gave away.”\n\nMargaret, who overheard the exposition, thought it so much to Blanche’s\ncredit, that she could not help repeating it in the evening, after the\nlittle girl was gone to bed, when Mr. Wilmot had come in to arrange\nthe programme for Cocksmoor. So the little fit of discontent and its\noccasion, the meeting with Meta Rivers, were discussed.\n\n“Yes,” said Mr. Wilmot, “those Riverses are open-handed. They really\nseem to have so much money, that they don’t know what to do with it. My\nbrother is ready to complain that they spoil his parish. It is all meant\nso well, and they are so kind-hearted and excellent, that it is a shame\nto find fault, and I tell Charles and his wife that their grumbling at\nsuch a squire proves them the most spoiled of all.”\n\n“Indiscriminate liberality?” asked the doctor. “I should guess the old\ngentleman to be rather soft!”\n\n“That’s one thing. The parish is so small, and there are so few to\nshower all this bounty on, and they are so utterly unused to country\npeople. They seem to think by laying out money they can get a show set\nof peasants in rustic cottages, just as they have their fancy cows and\npoultry--all that offends the eye out of the way.”\n\n“Making it a matter of taste,” said the doctor.\n\n“I’m sure I would,” said Norman aside to Ethel. “What’s the use of\ngetting oneself disgusted?”\n\n“One must not begin with showing dislike,” began Ethel, “or--”\n\n“Ay--you like rags, don’t you? but hush!”\n\n“That is just what I should expect of Mr. Rivers,” said Dr. May; “he\nhas cultivated his taste till it is getting to be a disease, but his\ndaughter has no lack of wit.”\n\n“Perhaps not. Charles and Mary are very fond of her, but she is entirely\ninexperienced, and that is a serious thing with so much money to throw\nabout. She pays people for sending their children to school, and keeping\ntheir houses tidy; and there is so much given away, that it is enough to\ntake away all independence and motive for exertion. The people speculate\non it, and take it as a right; by-and-by there will be a reaction--she\nwill find out she is imposed upon, take offence, and for the rest of her\nlife will go about saying how ungrateful the poor are!”\n\n“It is a pity good people won’t have a little common-sense,” said Dr.\nMay. “But there’s something so bewitching in that little girl, that I\ncan’t give her up. I verily believe she will right herself.”\n\n“I have scarcely seen her,” said Mr. Wilmot. “She has won papa’s heart\nby her kindness to me,” said Margaret, smiling. “You see her beautiful\nflowers? She seems to me made to lavish pleasures on others wherever she\ngoes.”\n\n“Oh, yes, they are most kind-hearted,” said Mr. Wilmot. “It is only\nthe excess of a virtue that could be blamed in them, and they are most\nvaluable to the place. She will learn experience in time--I only hope\nshe will not be spoiled.”\n\nFlora felt as if her father must be thinking his morning’s argument\nconfirmed, and she was annoyed. But she thought there was no reason why\nwealth should not be used sensibly, and if she were at the head of such\nan establishment as the Grange, her charity should be so well regulated\nas to be the subject of general approbation.\n\nShe wanted to find some one else on her side, and, as they went to bed,\nshe said to Ethel, “Don’t you wish we had some of this superfluity of\nthe Riverses for poor Cocksmoor?”\n\n“I wish we had anything for Cocksmoor! Here’s a great hole in my boot,\nand nurse says I must get a new pair, that is seven-and-sixpence gone! I\nshall never get the first pound made up towards building!”\n\n“And pounds seem nothing to them,” said Flora.\n\n“Yes, but if they don’t manage right with them! I’ll tell you, Flora,\nI got into a fit of wishing the other day; it does seem such a grievous\npity to see those children running to waste for want of daily teaching,\nand Jenny Hall had forgotten everything. I was vexed, and thought it was\nall no use while we could not do more; but just then I began to look out\nthe texts Ritchie had marked for me to print for them to learn, and the\nfirst was, ‘Be thou faithful over a few things, and I will make thee\nruler over many things,’ and then I thought perhaps we were learning to\nbe faithful with a few things. I am sure what they said to-night showed\nit was lucky we have not more in our hands. I should do wrong for ever\nwith the little we have if it were not for Ritchie and Margaret. By the\ntime we have really got the money together for the school, perhaps I\nshall have more sense.”\n\n“Got the money! As if we ever could!”\n\n“Oh, yes! we shall and will. It need not be more than £70, Ritchie says,\nand I have twelve shillings for certain, put out from the money for hire\nof the room, and the books and clothes, and, in spite of these horrid\nboots, I shall save something out of this quarter, half-a-crown at\nleast. And I have another plan besides--”\n\nBut Flora had to go down to Margaret’s room to bed. Flora was always\nready to throw herself into the present, and liked to be the most\nuseful person in all that went forward, so that no thoughts of greatness\ninterfered with her enjoyment at Cocksmoor.\n\nThe house seemed wild that Easter Monday morning. Ethel, Mary, and\nBlanche, flew about in all directions, and in spite of much undoing of\ntheir own arrangements, finished their preparations so much too early,\nthat, at half-past eleven, Mary complained that she had nothing to do,\nand that dinner would never come.\n\nMany were the lamentations at leaving Margaret behind, but she answered\nthem by talking of the treat of having papa all to herself, for he had\nlent them the gig, and promised to stay at home all the afternoon with\nher.\n\nThe first division started on foot directly after dinner, the real\nCouncil of education, as Norman called them, namely, Mr. Wilmot,\nRichard, Ethel, and Mary; Flora, the other member, waited to take care\nof Blanche and Aubrey, who were to come in the gig, with the cakes,\ntea-kettles, and prizes, driven by Norman. Tom and Hector Ernescliffe\nwere invited to join the party, and many times did Mary wish for Harry.\n\nSupremely happy were the young people as they reached the common, and\nheard the shout of tumultuous joy, raised by their pupils, who were on\nthe watch for them. All was now activity. Everybody tripped into Mrs.\nGreen’s house, while Richard and Ethel ran different ways to secure that\nthe fires were burning, which they had hired, to boil their kettles,\nwith the tea in them.\n\nThen when the kitchen was so full that it seemed as if it could hold no\nmore, some kind of order was produced, the children were seated on their\nbenches, and, while the mothers stood behind to listen, Mr. Wilmot began\nto examine, as well as he could in so crowded an audience.\n\nThere was progress. Yes, there was. Only three were as utterly rude\nand idealess as they used to be at Christmas. Glimmerings had dawned\non most, and one--Una M’Carthy--was fit to come forward to claim Mr.\nWilmot’s promise of a Prayer-book. She could really read and say the\nCatechism--her Irish wit and love of learning had outstripped all the\nrest--and she was the pride of Ethel’s heart, fit, now, to present\nherself on equal terms with the Stoneborough set, as far as her sense\nwas concerned--though, alas! neither present nor exhortation had\nsucceeded in making her anything, in looks, but a picturesque\ntatterdemalion, her sandy elf locks streaming over a pair of eyes, so\ndancing and gracieuses, that it was impossible to scold her.\n\nWith beating heart, as if her own success in life depended for ever\non the way her flock acquitted themselves, Ethel stood by Mr. Wilmot,\ntrying to read answers coming out of the dull mouths of her children,\nand looking exultingly at Richard whenever some good reply was made,\nespecially when Una answered an unexpected question. It was too\ndelightful to hear how well she remembered all the history up to the\nflood, and how prettily it came out in her Irish accent! That made up\nfor all the atrocious stupidity of others, who, after being told every\ntime since they had begun who gave their names, now chose to forget.\n\nIn the midst, while the assembly were listening with admiration to the\nreading of the scholar next in proficiency to Una, a boy who could read\nwords of five letters without spelling, there was a fresh squeezing at\nthe door, and, the crowd opening as well as it could, in came Flora and\nBlanche, while Norman’s head was seen for a moment in the doorway.\n\nFlora’s whisper to Ethel was her first discovery that the closeness and\nthe heat of the room was nearly overpowering. Her excitement had made\nall be forgotten. “Could not a window be opened?”\n\nMrs. Green interfered--it had been nailed up because her husband had the\nrheumatiz!\n\n“Where’s Aubrey?” asked Mary.\n\n“With Norman. Norman said he would not let him go into the black-hole,\nso he has got him out of doors. Ethel, we must come out! You don’t know\nwhat an atmosphere it is! Blanche, go out to Norman!”\n\n“Flora, Flora! you don’t consider,” said Ethel, in an agony.\n\n“Yes, yes. It is not at all cold. Let them have their presents out of\ndoors and eat their buns.”\n\nRichard and Mr. Wilmot agreed with Flora, and the party were turned out.\nEthel did own, when she was in the open air, “that it had been rather\nhot.”\n\nNorman’s face was a sight, as he stood holding Aubrey in his arms, to\ngratify the child’s impatience. The stifling den, the uncouth aspect\nof the children, the head girl so very ragged a specimen, thoroughly\nrevolted his somewhat fastidious disposition. This was Ethel’s delight!\nto this she made so many sacrifices! this was all that her time and\nlabour had effected! He did not wish to vex her but it was more than he\ncould stand.\n\nHowever, Ethel was too much engrossed to look for sympathy. It was a\nfine spring day, and on the open space of the common the arrangements\nwere quickly made. The children stood in a long line, and the baskets\nwere unpacked. Flora and Ethel called the names, Mary and Blanche gave\nthe presents, and assuredly the grins, courtesies, and pulls of the\nforelock they elicited, could not have been more hearty for any of Miss\nRivers’s treasures. The buns and the kettles of tea followed--it was\nperfect delight to entertainers and entertained, except when Mary’s\ndignity was cruelly hurt by Norman’s authoritatively taking a kettle out\nof her hands, telling her she would be the death of herself or somebody\nelse, and reducing her to the mere rank of a bun distributor, which\nBlanche and Aubrey could do just as well; while he stalked along with a\ngrave and resigned countenance, filling up the cups held out to him by\ntimid-looking children. Mary next fell in with Granny Hall, who had gone\ninto such an ecstasy over Blanche and Aubrey, that Blanche did not know\nwhich way to look; and Aubrey, in some fear that the old woman might\nintend to kiss him, returned the compliments by telling her she was\n“ugly up in her face,” at which she laughed heartily, and uttered more\nvehement benedictions.\n\nFinally, the three best children, boys and girls, were to be made fit\nto be seen, and recommended by Mr. Wilmot to the Sunday-school and\npenny club at Stoneborough, and, this being proclaimed and the children\nselected, the assembly dispersed, Mr. Wilmot rejoicing Ethel and\nRichard by saying, “Well, really, you have made a beginning. There is an\nimprovement in tone among those children, that is more satisfactory than\nany progress they may have made.”\n\nEthel’s eyes beamed, and she hurried to tell Flora. Richard coloured\nand gave his quiet smile, then turned to put things in order for their\nreturn.\n\n“Will you drive home, Richard?” said Norman, coming up to him.\n\n“Don’t you wish it?” said Richard, who had many minor arrangements to\nmake, and would have preferred walking home independently.\n\n“No, thank you, I have a headache, and walking may take it off,” said\nNorman, taking off his hat and passing his fingers through his hair.\n\n“A headache again--I am sorry to hear it.”\n\n“It is only that suffocating den of yours. My head ached from the moment\nI looked into it. How can you take Ethel into such a hole, Richard? It\nis enough to kill her to go on with it for ever.”\n\n“It is not so every day,” said the elder brother quietly. “It is a warm\nday, and there was an unusual crowd.”\n\n“I shall speak to my father,” exclaimed Norman, with somewhat of the\nsupercilious tone that he had now and then been tempted to address to\nhis brother. “It is not fit that Ethel should give up everything, health\nand all, to such a set as these. They look as if they had been picked\nout of the gutter--dirt, squalor, everything disgusting, and summer\ncoming on, too, and that horrid place with no window to open! It is\nutterly unbearable!”\n\nRichard stooped to pick up a heavy basket, then smiled and said, “You\nmust get over such things as these if you mean to be a clergyman,\nNorman.”\n\n“Whatever I am to be, it does not concern the girls being in such a\nplace as this. I am surprised that you could suffer it.”\n\nThere was no answer--Richard was walking off with his basket, and\nputting it into the carriage. Norman was not pleased with himself, but\nthought it his duty to let his father know his opinion of Ethel’s weekly\nresort. All he wished was to avoid Ethel herself, not liking to show her\nhis sentiments, and he was glad to see her put into the gig with Aubrey\nand Mary.\n\nThey rushed into the drawing-room, full of glee, when they came home,\nall shouting their news together, and had not at first leisure to\nperceive that Margaret had some tidings for them in return. Mr.\nRivers had been there, with a pressing invitation to his daughter’s\nschool-feast, and it had been arranged that Flora and Ethel should go\nand spend the day at the Grange, and their father come to dine, and\nfetch them home in the evening. Margaret had been much pleased with the\nmanner in which the thing was done. When Dr. May, who seemed reluctant\nto accept the proposal that related to himself, was called out of the\nroom, Mr. Rivers had, in a most kind manner, begged her to say whether\nshe thought it would be painful to him, or whether it might do\nhis spirits good. She decidedly gave her opinion in favour of the\ninvitation, Mr. Rivers gained his point, and she had ever since been\npersuading her father to like the notion, and assuring him it need not\nbe made a precedent for the renewal of invitations to dine out in the\ntown. He thought the change would be pleasant for his girls, and had,\ntherefore, consented.\n\n“Oh, papa, papa! thank you!” cried Ethel, enraptured, as soon as he\ncame into the room. “How very kind of you! How I have wished to see the\nGrange, and all Norman talks about! Oh, dear! I am so glad you are going\nthere too!”\n\n“Why, what should you do with me?” said Dr. May, who felt and looked\ndepressed at this taking up of the world again.\n\n“Oh, dear! I should not like it at all without you! It would be no fun\nat all by ourselves. I wish Flora would come home. How pleased she will\nbe! Papa, I do wish you would look as if you didn’t mind it! I can’t\nenjoy it if you don’t like going.”\n\n“I shall when I am there, my dear,” said the doctor affectionately,\nputting his arm around her as she stood by him. “It will be a fine day’s\nsport for you.”\n\n“But can’t you like it beforehand, papa?”\n\n“Not just this minute, Ethel,” said he, with his bright, sad smile. “All\nI like just now is my girl’s not being able to do without me; but we’ll\ndo the best we can. So your flock acquitted themselves brilliantly? Who\nis your Senior Wrangler?”\n\nEthel threw herself eagerly into the history of the examination, and had\nalmost forgotten the invitation till she heard the front door open. Then\nit was not she, but Margaret, who told Flora--Ethel could not, as she\nsaid, enjoy what seemed to sadden her father. Flora received it much\nmore calmly. “It will be very pleasant,” said she; “it was very kind of\npapa to consent. You will have Richard and Norman, Margaret, to be with\nyou in the evening.”\n\nAnd, as soon as they went upstairs, Ethel began to write down the list\nof prizes in her school journal, while Flora took out the best evening\nfrocks, to study whether the crape looked fresh enough.\n\nThe invitation was a convenient subject of conversation, for Norman had\nso much to tell his sisters of the curiosities they must look for at the\nGrange, that he was not obliged to mention Cocksmoor. He did not like\nto mortify Ethel by telling her his intense disgust, and he knew he\nwas about to do what she would think a great injury by speaking to his\nfather on the subject; but he thought it for her real welfare, and\ntook the first opportunity of making to his father and Margaret a most\nformidable description of Ethel’s black-hole. It quite alarmed Margaret,\nbut the doctor smiled, saying, “Ay, ay, I know the face Norman puts on\nif he looks into a cottage.”\n\n“Well,” said Norman, with some mortification, “all I know is, that my\nhead ached all the rest of the day.”\n\n“Very likely, but your head is not Ethel’s, and there were twice as many\npeople as the place was intended to hold.”\n\n“A stuffy hole, full of peat-smoke, and with a window that can’t open at\nthe best of times.”\n\n“Peat-smoke is wholesome,” said Dr. May, looking provoking.\n\n“You don’t know what it is, papa, or you would never let Ethel spend her\nlife there. It is poisonous!”\n\n“I’ll take care of Ethel,” said Dr. May, walking off, and leaving Norman\nin a state of considerable annoyance at being thus treated. He broke\nout into fresh exclamations against the horrors of Cocksmoor, telling\nMargaret she had no idea what a den it was.\n\n“But, Norman, it can’t be so very bad, or Richard would not allow it.”\n\n“Richard is deluded!” said Norman; “but if he chooses to run after dirty\nbrats, why should he take Ethel there?”\n\n“My dear Norman, you know it is all Ethel’s doing.”\n\n“Yes, I know she has gone crazy after them, and given up all her Greek\nfor it. It is past endurance!” said Norman, who had worked himself up\ninto great indignation.\n\n“Well, but surely, Norman, it is better they should do what they can for\nthose poor creatures, than for Ethel to learn Greek.”\n\n“I don’t know that. Let those who are fit for nothing else go and\ndrone over A B C with ragged children, if they like. It is just their\nvocation; but there is an order in everything, Margaret, and minds of a\nsuperior kind are intended for higher purposes, not to be wasted in this\nmanner.”\n\n“I don’t know whether they are wasted,” said Margaret, not quite liking\nNorman’s tone, though she had not much to say to his arguments.\n\n“Not wasted? Not in doing what any one can do? I know what you’ll\nsay about the poor. I grant it, but high ability must be given for a\npurpose, not to be thrown away. It is common-sense, that some one must\nbe meant to do the dirty work.”\n\n“I see what you mean, Norman, but I don’t quite like that to be called\nby such a name. I think--” she hesitated. “Don’t you think you dislike\nsuch things more than--”\n\n“Any one must abominate dirt and slovenliness. I know what you mean. My\nfather thinks ‘tis all nonsense in me, but his profession has made him\ninsensible to such things, and he fancies every one else is the same!\nNow, Margaret, am I unreasonable?”\n\n“I am sure I don’t know, dear Norman,” said Margaret, hesitating,\nand feeling it her duty to say something; “I dare say it was very\ndisagreeable.”\n\n“And you think, too, that I made a disturbance for nothing?”\n\n“No, indeed I don’t, nor does dear papa. I have no doubt he will see\nwhether it is proper for Ethel. All I think he meant is, that perhaps\nyour not being well last winter has made you a little more sensitive in\nsuch things.”\n\nNorman paused, and coloured. He remembered the pain it had given him to\nfind himself incapable of being of use to his father, and that he had\nresolved to conquer the weakness of nerve of which he was ashamed;\nbut he did not like to connect this with his fastidious feelings of\nrefinement. He would not own to himself that they were over nice, and,\nat the bottom of all this justification, rankled Richard’s saying, that\nhe who cared for such things was unfit for a clergyman. Norman’s secret\nthought was, it was all very well for those who could only aspire\nto parish work in wretched cottages--people who could distinguish\nthemselves were more useful at the university, forming minds, and\nopening new discoveries in learning.\n\nWas Norman quite proof against the consciousness of daily excelling\nall his competitors? His superiority had become even more manifest\nthis Easter, when Cheviot and Forder, the two elder boys whom he had\noutstripped, left the school, avowedly, because it was not worth\nwhile for them to stay, since they had so little chance of the Randall\nscholarship. Norman had now only to walk over the course, no one even\napproaching him but Harvey Anderson.\n\nMeta Rivers always said that fine weather came at her call, and so it\ndid--glowing sunshine streaming over the shaven turf, and penetrating\neven the solid masses of the great cedar.\n\nThe carriage was sent for the Misses May, and at two o’clock they\narrived. Flora, extremely anxious that Ethel should comport herself\ndiscreetly; and Ethel full of curiosity and eagerness, the only drawback\nher fears that her papa was doing what he disliked. She was not in the\nleast shy, and did not think about her manner enough to be troubled by\nthe consciousness that it had a good deal of abruptness and eagerness,\nand that her short sight made her awkward. Meta met them with\noutstretched hands and a face beaming with welcome. “I told you I should\nget my way!” she said triumphantly, and, after her warm greeting, she\nlooked with some respect at the face of the Miss May who was so very\nclever. It certainly was not what she expected, not at all like either\nof the four sisters she had already seen--brown, sallow, and with that\nsharp long nose, and the eager eyes, and brow a little knit by the\ndesire to see as far as she could. It was pleasanter to look at Flora.\n\nEthel left the talk chiefly to Flora--there was wonder and study enough\nfor her in the grounds and garden, and when Mrs. Larpent tried to enter\ninto conversation with her, she let it drop two or three times while\nshe was peering hard at a picture and trying to make out its subject.\nHowever, when they all went out to walk to church, Ethel lighted up,\nand talked, admired, and asked questions in her quick, eager way, which\ninterested Mrs. Larpent greatly. The governess asked after Norman, and\nno more was wanted to produce a volume of histories of his successes,\ntill Flora turned as she walked before with Meta, saying, “Why, Ethel,\nyou are quite overwhelming Mrs. Larpent.”\n\nBut some civil answer convinced Ethel that what she said was\ninteresting, and she would not be stopped in her account of their\nanxieties on the day of the examination. Flora was pleased that Meta,\ncatching some words, begged to hear more, and Flora gave an account\nof the matter, soberer in terms, but quietly setting Norman at a much\ngreater distance from all his competitors.\n\nAfter church came the feast in the school. It was a large commodious\nbuilding. Meta declared it was very tiresome that it was so good inside,\nit was so ugly, she should never rest till papa had built her a real\nbeauty. They found Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wilmot in the school, with a\nvery nice well-dressed set of boys and girls, and--But there is no need\nto describe the roast-beef and plum-pudding, “the feast ate merrily,”\n and Ethel was brilliantly happy waiting on the children, and so was\nsunny-hearted Meta. Flora was too busy in determining what the Riverses\nmight be thinking of her and her sister to give herself up to the\nenjoyment.\n\nEthel found a small boy looking ready to cry at an untouched slice of\nbeef. She examined him whether he could cut it, and at last discovered\nthat, as had been the case with one or two of her own brothers at the\nsame age, meat was repugnant to him. In her vehement manner she flew\noff to fetch him some pudding, and hurrying up, as she thought, to Mr.\nCharles Wilmot, who had been giving it out, she thrust her plate between\nhim and the dish, and had begun her explanation when she perceived it\nwas a stranger, and she stood, utterly discomfited, not saying, “I beg\nyour pardon,” but only blushing, awkward and confused, as he spoke to\nher, in a good-natured, hospitable manner, which showed her it must be\nMr. Rivers. She obtained her pudding, and, turning hastily, retreated.\n\n“Meta,” said Mr. Rivers, as his daughter came out of the school with\nhim, for, open and airy as it was, the numbers and the dinner made him\nregard it as Norman had viewed the Cocksmoor room, “was that one of the\nMiss Mays?”\n\n“Yes, papa, Ethel, the third, the clever one.”\n\n“I thought she must be one of them from her dress; but what a difference\nbetween her and the others!”\n\nMr. Rivers was a great admirer of beauty, and Meta, brought up to be the\nsame, was disappointed, but consoled herself by admiring Flora. Ethel,\nafter the awkwardness was over, thought no more of the matter, but went\non in full enjoyment of the feast. The eating finished, the making of\npresents commenced, and choice ones they were. The smiles of Meta and of\nthe children were a pretty sight, and Ethel thought she had never seen\nanything so like a beneficent fairy. Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot said their\nwords of counsel and encouragement, and, by five o’clock, all was over.\n\n“Oh, I am sorry!” said Meta, “Easter won’t come again for a whole year,\nand it has been so delightful. How that dear little Annie smiled and\nnursed her doll! I wish I could see her show it to her mother! Oh, how\nnice it is! I am so glad papa brought me to live in the country. I don’t\nthink anything can be so charming in all the world as seeing little\nchildren happy!”\n\nEthel could not think how the Wilmots could have found it in their heart\nto regret the liberality of this sweet damsel, on whom she began to look\nwith Norman’s enthusiastic admiration.\n\nThere was time for a walk round the grounds, Meta doing the honours to\nFlora, and Ethel walking with Mrs. Larpent. Both pairs were very good\nfriends, and the two sisters admired and were charmed with the beauty\nof the gardens and conservatories--Ethel laying up a rich store of\nintelligence for Margaret; but still she was not entirely happy;\nher papa was more and more on her mind. He had looked dispirited\nat breakfast; he had a long hard day’s work before him, and she was\nincreasingly uneasy at the thought that it would be a painful effort to\nhim to join them in the evening. Her mind was full of it when she was\nconducted, with Flora, to the room where they were to dress; and when\nFlora began to express her delight, her answer was only that she hoped\nit was not very unpleasant to papa.\n\n“It is not worth while to be unhappy about that, Ethel. If it is an\neffort, it will be good for him when he is once here. I know he will\nenjoy it.”\n\n“Yes, I should think he would--I hope he will. He must like you to have\nsuch a friend as Miss Rivers. How pretty she is!”\n\n“Now, Ethel, it is high time to dress. Pray make yourself look\nnice--don’t twist up your hair in that any-how fashion.”\n\nEthel sighed, then began talking fast about some hints on school-keeping\nwhich she had picked up for Cocksmoor.\n\nFlora’s glossy braids were in full order, while Ethel was still\nstruggling to get her plait smooth, and was extremely beholden to her\nsister for taking it into her own hands and doing the best with it that\nits thinness and roughness permitted. And then Flora pinched and pulled\nand arranged Ethel’s frock, in vain attempts to make it sit like her\nown--those sharp high bones resisted all attempts to disguise them.\n“Never mind, Flora, it is quite tidy, I am sure, there--do let me be in\npeace. You are like old nurse.”\n\n“So those are all the thanks I get?”\n\n“Well, thank you very much, dear Flora. You are a famous person. How I\nwish Margaret could see that lovely mimosa!”\n\n“And, Ethel, do take care. Pray don’t poke and spy when you come into\nthe room, and don’t frown when you are trying to see. I hope you won’t\nhave anything to help at dinner. Take care how you manage.”\n\n“I’ll try,” said Ethel meekly, though a good deal tormented, as Flora\nwent on with half a dozen more injunctions, closed by Meta’s coming to\nfetch them. Little Meta did not like to show them her own bedroom--she\npitied them so much when she thought of the contrast. She would have\nliked to put Flora’s arm through her’s, but she thought, it would look\nneglectful of Ethel; so she only showed the way downstairs. Ethel forgot\nall her sister’s orders; for there stood her father, and she looked\nmost earnestly at his face. It was cheerful, and his voice sounded\nwell pleased as he greeted Meta; then resumed an animated talk with\nMr. Rivers. Ethel drew as near him as she could; she had a sense of\nprotection, and could open to full enjoyment when she saw him bright. At\nthe first pause in the conversation, the gentlemen turned to the young\nladies. Mr. Rivers began talking to Flora, and Dr. May, after a few\npleasant words to Meta, went back to Ethel. He wanted her to see\nhis favourite pictures--he led her up to them, made her put on his\nspectacles to see them better, and showed her their special merits. Mr.\nRivers and the others joined them; Ethel said little, except a remark\nor two in answer to her papa, but she was very happy--she felt that he\nliked to have her with him; and Meta, too, was struck by the soundness\nof her few sayings, and the participation there seemed to be in all\nthings between the father and daughter.\n\nAt dinner Ethel went on pretty well. She was next to her father, and was\nvery glad to find the dinner so grand, that no side-dish fell to her lot\nto be carved. There was a great deal of pleasant talk, such as the girls\ncould understand, though they did not join much in it, except that now\nand then Dr. May turned to Ethel as a reference for names and dates. To\nmake up for silence at dinner, there was a most confidential chatter in\nthe drawing-room. Flora and Meta on one side, hand in hand, calling each\nother by their Christian names, Mrs. Larpent and Ethel on the other.\nFlora dreaded only that Ethel was talking too much, and revealing too\nmuch in how different style they lived. Then came the gentlemen, Dr. May\nbegging Mr. Rivers to show Ethel one of his prints, when Ethel stooped\nmore than ever, as if her eyelashes were feelers, but she was in\ntransports of delight, and her embarrassment entirely at an end in her\nadmiration, as she exclaimed and discussed with her papa, and by her\nhearty appreciation made Mr. Rivers for the time forget her plainness.\nMusic followed; Flora played nicely, Meta like a well-taught girl; Ethel\nwent on musing over the engravings. The carriage was announced, and\nso ended the day in Norman’s fairy-land. Ethel went home, leaning hard\nagainst her papa, talking to him of Raphael’s Madonnas; and looking out\nat the stars, and thinking how the heavenly beauty of those faces that,\nin the prints she had been turning over, seemed to be connected with the\nglories of the dark-blue sky and glowing stars. “As one star differeth\nfrom another star in glory,” murmured she; “that was the lesson to-day,\npapa;” and when she felt him press her hand, she knew he was thinking of\nthat last time she had heard the lesson, when he had not been with her,\nand her thoughts went with his, though not another word was spoken.\n\nFlora hardly knew when they ceased to talk. She had musings equally\nengrossing of her own. She saw she was likely to be very intimate with\nMeta Rivers, and she was roaming away into schemes for not letting the\nintercourse drop, and hopes of being admitted to many a pleasure as yet\nlittle within her reach--parties, balls, London, itself, and, above all,\nthe satisfaction of being admired. The certainty that Mr. Rivers thought\nher pretty and agreeable had gratified her all the evening, and if he,\nwith his refined taste, thought so, what would others think? Her\nonly fear was, that Ethel’s awkwardness might make an unfavourable\nimpression, but, at least, she said to herself, it was anything but\nvulgar awkwardness.\n\nTheir reflections were interrupted by the fly stopping. It was at a\nlittle shop in the outskirts of the town, and Dr. May, explained that he\nwanted to inquire for a patient. He went in for a moment, then came back\nto desire that they would go home, for he should be detained some little\ntime. No one need sit up for him--he would let himself in.\n\nIt seemed a comment on Ethel’s thoughts, bringing them back to the\npresent hour. That daily work of homely mercy, hoping for nothing again,\nwas surely the true way of doing service.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\n    WATCHMAN. How, if he will not stand?\n    DOGBERRY. Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go.\n                                          Much Ado about Nothing.\n\n\nDr. May promised Margaret that he would see whether the black-hole of\nCocksmoor was all that Norman depicted it, and, accordingly, he came\nhome that way on Tuesday evening the next week, much to the astonishment\nof Richard, who was in the act of so mending the window that it might\nlet in air when open, and keep it out when shut, neither of which\npurposes had it ever yet answered.\n\nDr. May walked in, met his daughter’s look of delight and surprise,\nspoke cheerfully to Mrs. Green, a hospital acquaintance of his, like\nhalf the rest of the country, and made her smile and curtsey by asking\nif she was not surprised at such doings in her house; then looked at the\nchildren, and patted the head that looked most fit to pat, inquired who\nwas the best scholar, and offered a penny to whoever could spell copper\ntea-kettle, which being done by three merry mortals, and having made him\nextremely popular, he offered Ethel a lift, and carried her off between\nhim and Adams, on whom he now depended for driving him, since Richard\nwas going to Oxford at once.\n\nIt was possible to spare him now. Dr. May’s arm was as well as he\nexpected it ever would be; he had discarded the sling, and could use his\nhand again, but the arm was still stiff and weak--he could not stretch\nit out, nor use it for anything requiring strength; it soon grew tired\nwith writing, and his daughters feared that it ached more than he chose\nto confess, when they saw it resting in the breast of his waistcoat.\nDriving he never would have attempted again, even if he could, and he\nhad quite given up carving--he could better bear to sit at the side than\nat the bottom of the dinner-table.\n\nMeans of carrying Margaret safely had been arranged by Richard, and\nthere was no necessity for longer delaying his going to Oxford, but he\nwas so unwillingly spared by all, as to put him quite into good spirits.\nEthel was much concerned to lose him from Cocksmoor, and dreaded\nhindrances to her going thither without his escort; but she had much\ntrust in having her father on her side, and meant to get authority from\nhim for the propriety of going alone with Mary.\n\nShe did not know how Norman had jeopardised her projects, but the danger\nblew over. Dr. May told Margaret that the place was clean and wholesome,\nand though more smoky than might be preferred, there was nothing to do\nany one in health any harm, especially when the walk there and back was\nover the fresh moor. He lectured Ethel herself on opening the window,\nnow that she could; and advised Norman to go and spend an hour in the\nschool, that he might learn how pleasant peat-smoke was--a speech Norman\ndid not like at all. The real touchstone of temper is ridicule on a\npoint where we do not choose to own ourselves fastidious, and if it and\nbeen from any one but his father, Norman would not have so entirely kept\ndown his irritation.\n\nRichard passed his examination successfully, and Dr. May wrote himself\nto express his satisfaction. Nothing went wrong just now except little\nTom, who seemed to be justifying Richard’s fears of the consequence of\nexciting his father’s anger. At home, he shrank and hesitated at the\nsimplest question if put by his father suddenly; and the appearance of\ncowardice and prevarication displeasing Dr. May further, rendered his\ntone louder, and frightened Tom the more, giving his manner an air\nof sullen reserve that was most unpleasant. At school it was much\nthe same--he kept aloof from Norman, and threw himself more into the\nopposite faction, by whom he was shielded from all punishment, except\nwhat they chose themselves to inflict on him.\n\nNorman’s post as head of the school was rendered more difficult by the\ndeparture of his friend Cheviot, who had always upheld his authority;\nHarvey Anderson did not openly transgress, for he had a character to\nmaintain, but it was well known throughout the school that there was a\nwide difference between the boys, and that Anderson thought it absurd,\nsuperfluous, and troublesome in May not to wink at abuses which appeared\nto be licensed by long standing. When Edward Anderson, Axworthy, and\ntheir set, broke through rules, it was with the understanding that the\nsecond boy in the school would support them, if he durst.\n\nThe summer and the cricket season brought the battle of Ballhatchet’s\nhouse to issue. The cricket ground was the field close to it, and\nfor the last two or three years there had been a frequent custom of\ndespatching juniors to his house for tarts and ginger-beer bottles.\nNorman knew of instances last year in which this had led to serious\nmischief, and had made up his mind that, at whatever loss of popularity,\nit was his duty to put a stop to the practice.\n\nHe was an ardent cricketer himself, and though the game did not, in\nanticipation, seem to him to have all the charms of last year, he\nentered into it with full zest when once engaged. But his eye was on all\nparts of the field, and especially on the corner by the bridge, and the\nboys knew him well enough to attempt nothing unlawful within the range\nof that glance. However, the constant vigilance was a strain too great\nto be always kept up, and he had reason to believe he was eluded more\nthan once.\n\nAt last came a capture, something like that of Tom, one which he could\nnot have well avoided making. The victim was George Larkins, the son\nof a clergyman in the neighbourhood, a wild, merry varlet, who got into\nmischief rather for the sake of the fun than from any bad disposition.\n\nHis look of consternation was exaggerated into a most comical\ncaricature, in order to hide how much of it was real.\n\n“So you are at that trick, Larkins.”\n\n“There! that bet is lost!” exclaimed Larkins. “I laid Hill half-a-crown\nthat you would not see me when you were mooning over your verses!”\n\n“Well, I have seen you. And now--”\n\n“Come, you would not thrash a fellow when you have just lost him\nhalf-a-crown! Single misfortunes never come alone, they say; so\nthere’s my money and my credit gone, to say nothing of Ballhatchet’s\nginger-beer!”\n\nThe boy made such absurd faces, that Norman could hardly help laughing,\nthough he wished to make it a serious affair. “You know, Larkins, I have\ngiven out that such things are not to be. It is a melancholy fact.”\n\n“Ay, so you must make an example of me!” said Larkins, pretending to\nlook resigned. “Better call all the fellows together, hadn’t you, and\nmake it more effective? It would be grateful to one’s feelings, you\nknow; and June,” added he, with a ridiculous confidential air, “if\nyou’ll only lay it on soft, I’ll take care it makes noise enough. Great\ncry, little wool, you know.”\n\n“Come with me,” said Norman. “I’ll take care you are example enough.\nWhat did you give for those articles?”\n\n“Fifteen-pence halfpenny. Rascally dear, isn’t it? but the old rogue\nmakes one pay double for the risk! You are making his fortune, you have\nraised his prices fourfold.”\n\n“I’ll take care of that.”\n\n“Why, where are you taking me? Back to him?”\n\n“I am going to gratify your wish to be an example.”\n\n“A gibbet! a gibbet” cried Larkins. “I’m to be turned off on the spot\nwhere the crime took place--a warning to all beholders. Only let me send\nhome for old Neptune’s chain, if you please, sir--if you hang me in\nthe combined watch-chains of the school, I fear they would give way and\ndefeat the purposes of justice.”\n\nThey were by this time at the bridge. “Come in,” said Norman to his\nfollower, as he crossed the entrance of the little shop, the first time\nhe had ever been there. A little cringing shrivelled old man stood up in\nastonishment.\n\n“Mr. May! can I have the pleasure, sir?”\n\n“Mr. Ballhatchet, you know that it is contrary to the rules that there\nshould be any traffic with the school without special permission?”\n\n“Yes, sir--just nothing, sir--only when the young gentlemen come\nhere, sir--I’m an old man, sir, and I don’t like not to oblige a young\ngentleman, sir,” pleaded the old man, in a great fright.\n\n“Very likely,” said Norman, “but I am come to give you fair notice. I\nam not going to allow the boys here to be continually smuggling spirits\ninto the school.”\n\n“Spirits! bless you, sir, I never thought of no sich a thing! ‘Tis\nnothing in life but ginger-beer--very cooling drink, sir, of my wife’s\nmaking; she had the receipt from her grandmother up in Leicestershire.\nWon’t you taste a bottle, sir?” and he hastily made a cork bounce, and\npoured it out.\n\nThat, of course, was genuine, but Norman was “up to him,” in schoolboy\nphrase.\n\n“Give me yours, Larkins.”\n\nNo pop ensued. Larkins, enjoying the detection, put his hands on his\nknees and looked wickedly up in the old man’s face to see what was\ncoming.\n\n“Bless me! it is a little flat. I wonder how that happened? I’ll be\nmost happy to change it, sir. Wife! what’s the meaning of Mr. Larkins’s\nginger-pop being so flat?”\n\n“It is very curious ginger-beer indeed, Mr. Ballhatchet,” said Norman;\n“and since it is liable to have such strange properties, I cannot allow\nit to be used any more at the school.”\n\n“Very well, sir-as you please, sir. You are the first gentleman as has\nobjected, sir.”\n\n“And, once for all, I give you warning,” added Norman, “that if I\nhave reason to believe you have been obliging the young gentlemen, the\nmagistrates and the trustees of the road shall certainly hear of it.”\n\n“You would not hurt a poor man, sir, as is drove to it--you as has such\na name for goodness!”\n\n“I have given you warning,” said Norman. “The next time I find any of\nyour bottles in the school fields, your licence goes. Now, there are\nyour goods. Give Mr. Larkins back the fifteen-pence. I wonder you are\nnot ashamed of such a charge!”\n\nHaving extracted the money, Norman turned to leave the shop. Larkins,\ntriumphant, “Ha! there’s Harrison!” as the tutor rode by, and they\ntouched their caps. “How he stared! My eyes! June, you’ll be had up for\ndealing with old Ball!” and he went into an ecstasy of laughing. “You’ve\nsettled him, I believe. Well, is justice satisfied?”\n\n“It would be no use thrashing you,” said Norman, laughing, as he leaned\nagainst the parapet of the bridge, and pinched the boy’s ear. “There’s\nnothing to be got out of you but chaff.”\n\nLarkins was charmed with the compliment.\n\n“But I’ll tell you what, Larkins, I can’t think how a fellow like you\ncan go and give in to these sneaking, underhand tricks that make you\nashamed to look one in the face.”\n\n“It is only for the fun of it.”\n\n“Well, I wish you would find your fun some other way. Come, Larkins,\nrecollect yourself a little--you have a home not so far off. How do you\nthink your father and mother would fancy seeing you reading the book you\nhad yesterday, or coming out of Ballhatchet’s with a bottle of spirits,\ncalled by a false name?”\n\nLarkins pinched his fingers; home was a string that could touch him, but\nit seemed beneath him to own it. At that moment a carriage approached,\nthe boy’s whole face lighted up, and he jumped forward. “Our own!” he\ncried. “There she is!”\n\nShe was, of course, his mother; and Norman, though turning hastily away\nthat his presence might prove no restraint, saw the boy fly over the\ndoor of the open carriage, and could have sobbed at the thought of what\nthat meeting was.\n\n“Who was that with you?” asked Mrs. Larkins, when she had obtained leave\nto have her boy with her, while she did her shopping.\n\n“That was May senior, our dux.”\n\n“Was it? I am very glad you should be with him, my dear George. He is\nvery kind to you, I hope?”\n\n“He is a jolly good fellow,” said Larkins sincerely, though by no means\ntroubling himself as to the appropriateness of the eulogy, nor thinking\nit necessary to explain to his mother the terms of the conversation.\n\nIt was not fruitless; Larkins did avoid mischief when it was not\nextremely inviting, was more amenable to May senior, and having been put\nin mind by him of his home, was not ashamed to bring the thought to the\naid of his eyes, when, on Sunday, during a long sermon of Mr. Ramsden’s,\nhe knew that Axworthy was making the grimace which irresistibly incited\nhim to make a still finer one.\n\nAnd Ballhatchet was so much convinced of “that there young May” being in\nearnest, that he assured his persuasive customers that it was as much as\nhis licence was worth to supply them.\n\nEvil and insubordination were more easily kept under than Norman had\nexpected, when he first made up his mind to the struggle. Firmness had\nso far carried the day, and the power of manful assertion of the right\nhad been proved, contrary to Cheviot’s parting auguries, that he would\nonly make himself disliked, and do no good.\n\nThe whole of the school was extremely excited this summer by a\nproceeding of Mr. Tomkins, the brewer, who suddenly closed up the\nfootway called Randall’s Alley, declaring that there was no right of\npassage through a certain field at the back of his brewery. Not only the\nschool, but the town was indignant, and the Mays especially so. It\nhad been the doctor’s way to school forty years ago, and there were\nrecollections connected with it that made him regard it with personal\naffection. Norman, too, could not bear to lose it; he had not entirely\nconquered his reluctance to pass that spot in the High Street, and the\nloss of the alley would be a positive deprivation to him. Almost every\nnative of Stoneborough felt strongly the encroachment of the brewer, and\nthe boys, of course, carried the sentiment to exaggeration.\n\nThe propensity to public speaking perhaps added to the excitement, for\nNorman May and Harvey Anderson, for once in unison, each made a vehement\nharangue in the school-court--Anderson’s a fine specimen of the village\nHampden style, about Britons never suffering indignities, and free-born\nEnglishmen swelling at injuries.\n\n“That they do, my hearty,” interjected Larkins, pointing to an inflamed\neye that had not returned to its right dimensions. However, Anderson\nwent on unmoved by the under titter, and demonstrated, to the full\nsatisfaction of all the audience, that nothing could be more illegal and\nunfounded than the brewer’s claims.\n\nThen came a great outburst from Norman, with all his father’s headlong\nvehemence; the way was the right of the town, the walk had been trodden\nby their forefathers for generations past--it had been made by the good\nold generous-hearted man who loved his town and townspeople, and would\nhave heard with shame and anger of a stranger, a new inhabitant, a\ngrasping radical, caring, as radicals always did, for no rights, but\nfor their own chance of unjust gains, coming here to Stoneborough to cut\nthem off from their own path. He talk of liberalism and the rights of\nthe poor! He who cut off Randall’s poor old creatures in the almshouses\nfrom their short way! and then came some stories of his oppression as a\npoor-law guardian, which greatly aggravated the wrath of the speaker and\naudience, though otherwise they did not exactly bear on the subject.\n\n“What would old Nicholas Randall say to these nineteenth-century\ndoings?” finished Norman.\n\n“Down, with them!” cried a voice from the throng, probably Larkins’s;\nbut there was no desire to investigate, it was the universal sentiment.\n“Down with it! Hurrah, we’ll have our footpath open again! Down with the\nfences! Britons never shall be slaves!” as Larkins finally ejaculated.\n\n“That’s the way to bring it to bear!” said Harvey Anderson, “See if he\ndares to bring an action against us. Hurrah!”\n\n“Yes, that’s the way to settle it,” said Norman. “Let’s have it down. It\nis an oppressive, arbitrary, shameful proceeding, and we’ll show him we\nwon’t submit to it!”\n\nCarried along by the general feeling, the whole troop of boys dashed\nshouting up to the barricade at the entrance of the field, and levelled\nit with the ground. A handkerchief was fastened to the top of one of the\nstakes, and waved over the brewhouse wall, and some of the boys were\nfor picking up stones and dirt, and launching them over, in hopes of\nspoiling the beer; but Norman put a stop to this, and brought them back\nto the school-yard, still in a noisy state of exultation.\n\nIt cooled a little by-and-by under the doubt how their exploit would be\ntaken. At home, Norman found it already known, and his father half glad,\nhalf vexed, enjoying the victory over Tomkins, yet a little uneasy on\nhis son’s behalf. “What will Dr. Hoxton say to the dux?” said he. “I\ndidn’t know he was to be dux in mischief as well as out of it.”\n\n“You can’t call it mischief, papa, to resent an unwarranted encroachment\nof our rights by such an old ruffian as that. One’s blood is up to think\nof the things he has done!”\n\n“He richly deserves it, no doubt,” said the doctor, “and yet I wish you\nhad been out of the row. If there is any blame, you will be the first it\nwill light on.”\n\n“I am glad of it, that is but just. Anderson and I seem to have stirred\nit up--if it wanted stirring--for it was in every fellow there; indeed,\nI had no notion it was coming to this when I began.”\n\n“Oratory,” said the doctor, smiling. “Ha, Norman! Think a little another\ntime, my boy, before you take the law into your own hands, or, what is\nworse, into a lot of hands you can’t control for good, though you may\nexcite them to harm.”\n\nDr. Hoxton did not come into school at the usual hour, and, in the\ncourse of the morning, sent for May senior, to speak to him in his\nstudy.\n\nHe looked very broad, awful, and dignified, as he informed him that Mr.\nTomkins had just been with him to complain of the damage that had been\ndone, and he appeared extremely displeased that the dux should have been\nno check on such proceedings.\n\n“I am sorry, sir,” said Norman, “but I believe it was the general\nfeeling that he had no right to stop the alley, and, therefore, that it\ncould not be wrong to break it down.”\n\n“Whether he has a right or not is not a question to be settled by you.\nSo I find that you, whose proper office it is to keep order, have been\ninflaming the mischievous and aggressive spirit amongst the others. I am\nsurprised at you; I thought you were more to be depended upon, May, in\nyour position.”\n\nNorman coloured a good deal, and simply answered, “I am sorry, sir.”\n\n“Take care, then, that nothing of the kind happens again,” said Dr.\nHoxton, who was very fond of him, and did not find fault with him\nwillingly.\n\nThat the first inflammatory discourse had been made by Anderson did not\nappear to be known--he only came in for the general reprimand given to\nthe school.\n\nIt was reported the following evening, just as the town boys turned\nout to go to their homes, that “old Tomkins had his fence up five times\nhigher than before.”\n\n“Have at him again, say I!” exclaimed Axworthy. “What business has he\ncoming stopping up ways that were made before he was born?”\n\n“We shall catch it from the doctor if we do,” said Edward Anderson, “He\nlooked in no end of a rage yesterday when he talked about the credit of\nthe school.”\n\n“Who cares for the credit of the school?” said the elder Anderson; “we\nare out of the school now--we are townsmen--Stoneborough boys--citizens\nnot bound to submit to injustice. No, no, the old rogue knew it would\nnot stand if it was brought into court, so he brings down old Hoxton on\nus instead--a dirty trick he deserves to be punished for.”\n\nAnd there was a general shout and yell in reply.\n\n“Anderson,” said Norman, “you had better not excite them again, they are\nripe for mischief. It will go further than it did yesterday--don’t you\nsee?”\n\nAnderson could not afford to get into a scrape without May to stand\nbefore him, and rather sulkily he assented.\n\n“It is of no use to rave about old Tomkins,” proceeded Norman, in his\nstyle of popular oratory. “If it is illegal, some one will go to law\nabout it, and we shall have our alley again. We have shown him our mind\nonce, and that is enough; if we let him alone now, he will see ‘tis only\nbecause we are ordered, not for his sake. It would be just putting\nhim in the right, and maybe winning his cause for him, to use any more\nviolence. There’s law for you, Anderson. So now no more about it--let us\nall go home like rational fellows. August, where’s August?”\n\nTom was not visible--he generally avoided going home with his brother;\nand Norman having seen the boys divide into two or three little parties,\nas their roads lay homewards, found he had an hour of light for an\nexpedition of his own, along the bank of the river. He had taken up\nbotany with much ardour, and sharing the study with Margaret was a great\ndelight to both. There was a report that the rare yellow bog-bean grew\nin a meadow about a mile and a half up the river, and thither he was\nbound, extremely enjoying the summer evening walk, as the fresh dewy\ncoolness sunk on all around, and the noises of the town were mellowed by\ndistance, and the sun’s last beams slanted on the green meadows, and the\nMay-flies danced, and dragon-flies darted, and fish rose or leaped high\nin the air, or showed their spotted sides, and opened and shut their\ngills, as they rested in the clear water, and the evening breeze rustled\nin the tall reeds, and brought fragrance from the fresh-mown hay.\n\nIt was complete enjoyment to Norman after his day’s study and the rule\nand watch over the unruly crowd of boys, and he walked and wandered\nand collected plants for Margaret till the sun was down, and the\ngrasshoppers chirped clamorously, while the fern-owl purred, and\nthe beetle hummed, and the skimming swallows had given place to the\nsoft-winged bat, and the large white owl floating over the fields as it\nmoused in the long grass.\n\nThe summer twilight was sobering every tint, when, as Norman crossed the\ncricket-field, he heard, in the distance, a loud shout. He looked\nup, and it seemed to him that he saw some black specks dancing in the\nforbidden field, and something like the waving of a flag, but it was not\nlight enough to be certain, and he walked quickly home.\n\nThe front door was fastened, and, while he was waiting to be let in, Mr.\nHarrison walked by, and called out, “You are late at home to-night--it\nis half-past nine.”\n\n“I have been taking a walk, sir.”\n\nA good-night was the answer, as he was admitted. Every one in the\ndrawing-room looked up, and exclaimed as he entered, “Where’s Tom?”\n\n“What! he is not come home?”\n\n“No! Was he not with you?”\n\n“I missed him after school. I was persuaded he was come home. I have\nbeen to look for the yellow bog-bean. There, Margaret. Had not I better\ngo and look for him?”\n\n“Yes, do,” said Dr. May. “The boy is never off one’s mind.”\n\nA sort of instinctive dread directed Norman’s steps down the open\nportion of Randall’s Alley, and, voices growing louder as he came\nnearer, confirmed his suspicions. The fence at this end was down, and,\non entering the field, a gleam of light met his eye on the ground--a\ncloud of smoke, black figures were flitting round it, pushing brands\ninto red places, and feeding the bonfire.\n\n“What have you been doing?” exclaimed Norman. “You have got yourselves\ninto a tremendous scrape!”\n\nA peal of laughter, and shout of “Randall and Stoneborough for ever!”\n was the reply.\n\n“August! May junior! Tom! answer me! Is he here?” asked Norman, not\nsolicitous to identify any one.\n\nBut gruff voices broke in upon them. “There they are, nothing like ‘em\nfor mischief.”\n\n“Come, young gentlemen,” said a policeman, “be off, if you please. We\ndon’t want to have none of you at the station to-night.”\n\nA general hurry-skurry ensued. Norman alone, strong in innocence, walked\nquietly away, and, as he came forth from the darkness of the alley,\nbeheld something scouring away before him, in the direction of home. It\npopped in at the front door before him, but was not in the drawing-room.\nHe strode upstairs, called, but was not answered, and found, under the\nbedclothes, a quivering mass, consisting of Tom, with all his clothes\non, fully persuaded that it was the policeman who was pursuing him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\n\n     Oh Life, without thy chequered scene,\n     Of right and wrong, of weal and woe,\n     Success and failure, could a ground\n     For magnanimity be found?\n                                   WORDSWORTH.\n\n\nDr. May was called for late the next day, Friday, and spent some time\nin one of the houses near the river. It was nearly eight o’clock when\nhe came away, and he lingered, looking towards the school, in hopes of a\nwalk home with his boys.\n\nPresently he saw Norman coming out from under the archway, his cap drawn\nover his face, and step, gesture, and manner betraying that something\nwas seriously wrong. He came up almost to his father without seeing\nhim, until startled by his exclamation, “Norman--why, Norman, what’s the\nmatter?”\n\nNorman’s lips quivered, and his face was pale--he seemed as if he could\nnot speak.\n\n“Where’s Tom?” said the doctor, much alarmed. “Has he got into disgrace\nabout this business of Tomkins? That boy--”\n\n“He has only got an imposition,” interrupted Norman. “No, it is not\nthat--it is myself”--and it was only with a gulp and struggle that he\nbrought out the words, “I am turned down in the school.”\n\nThe doctor started back a step or two, aghast. “What-how--speak, Norman.\nWhat have you done?”\n\n“Nothing!” said Norman, recovering in the desire to reassure his\nfather--“nothing!”\n\n“That’s right,” said the doctor, breathing freely. “What’s the meaning\nof it...a misunderstanding?”\n\n“Yes,” said Norman, with bitterness. “It is all Anderson’s doing--a word\nfrom him would have set all straight--but he would not; I believe, from\nmy heart, he held his tongue to get me down, that he might have the\nRandall!”\n\n“We’ll see you righted,” said the doctor eagerly. “Come, tell me the\nwhole story, Norman. Is it about this unlucky business?”\n\n“Yes. The town-fellows were all up about it last evening, when we came\nout of school. Anderson senior himself began to put them up to having\nthe fence down again. Yes, that he did--I remember his very words--that\nTomkins could not bring it into court, and so set old Hoxton at us.\nWell, I told them it would not do--thought I had settled them--saw them\noff home--yes, Simpson, and Benson, and Grey, up the High Street, and\nthe others their way. I only left Axworthy going into a shop when I set\noff on my walk. What could a fellow do more? How was I to know that\nthat Axworthy would get them together again, and take them to this\naffair--pull up the stakes--saw them down--for they were hard to get\ndown--shy all sorts of things over into the court--hoot at old Tomkins’s\nman, when he told them to be off--and make a bonfire of the sticks at\nlast?”\n\n“And Harvey Anderson was there?”\n\n“No--not he. He is too sharp--born and bred attorney as he is--he\ntalked them up to the mischief when my back was turned, and then sneaked\nquietly home, quite innocent, and out of the scrape.”\n\n“But Dr. Hoxton can never entertain a suspicion that you had anything to\ndo with it!”\n\n“Yes, he does though. He thinks I incited them, and Tomkins and the\npoliceman declare I was there in the midst of the row--and not one of\nthese fellows will explain how I came at the last to look for Tom.”\n\n“Not Tom himself?”\n\n“He did try to speak, poor little fellow, but, after the other affair,\nhis word goes for nothing, and so, it seems, does mine. I did think\nHoxton would have trusted me!”\n\n“And did not he?” exclaimed Dr. May.\n\n“He did not in so many words accuse me of--of--but he told me he\nhad serious charges brought against me--Mr. Harrison had seen me at\nBallhatchet’s, setting an example of disregard to rules--and, again, Mr.\nHarrison saw me coming in at a late hour last night. ‘I know he did,’\nI said, and I explained where I had been, and they asked for proofs! I\ncould hardly answer, from surprise, at their not seeming to believe me,\nbut I said you could answer for my having come in with the flowers for\nmy sister.”\n\n“To be sure I will--I’ll go this instant--” he was turning.\n\n“It is of no use, papa, to-night; Dr. Hoxton has a dinner-party.”\n\n“He is always having parties. I wish he would mind them less, and his\nbusiness more. You disbelieved! but I’ll see justice done you, Norman,\nthe first thing to-morrow. Well--”\n\n“Well then, I said, old Ballhatchet could tell that I crossed the bridge\nat the very time they were doing this pretty piece of work, for he was\nsitting smoking in his porch when I went home, and, would you believe\nit? the old rascal would not remember who passed that evening! It is all\nhis malice and revenge--nothing else!”\n\n“Why--what have you been doing to him?”\n\nNorman shortly explained the ginger-beer story, and adding, “Cheviot\ntold me I should get nothing but ill-will, and so I have--all those town\nfellows turn against me now, and though they know as well as possible\nhow it was, they won’t say a word to right me, just out of spite,\nbecause I have stopped them from all the mischief I could!”\n\n“Well, then--”\n\n“They asked me whether--since I allowed that I had been there at last--I\nhad dispersed the boys. I said no, I had no time. Then they desired to\nknow who was there, and that I had not seen; it was all dark, and there\nhad not been a moment, and if I guessed, it was no affair of mine to\nsay. So they ordered me down, and had up Ned Anderson, and one or two\nmore who were known to have been in the riot, and then they consulted\na good while, and sent for me; Mr. Wilmot was for me, I am sure, but\nHarrison was against me. Dr. Hoxton sat there, and made me one of his\naddresses. He said he would not enter on the question whether I had been\npresent at the repetition of the outrage, as he called it, but what was\nquite certain was, that I had abused my authority and influence in the\nschool; I had been setting a bad example, and breaking the rules\nabout Ballhatchet, and so far from repressing mischief, I had been the\nforemost in it, making inflammatory harangues, leading them to commit\nviolence the first time, and the next, if not actually taking part in\nit personally, at any rate not preventing it. In short, he said it was\nclear I had not weight enough for my post--it was some excuse I had been\nraised to it so young--but it was necessary to show that proficiency in\nstudies did not compensate for disregard of discipline, and so he turned\nme down below the first six! So there’s another May in disgrace!”\n\n“It shall not last--it shall not last, my boy,” said Dr. May, pressing\nNorman’s arm; “I’ll see you righted. Dr. Hoxton shall hear the whole\nstory. I am not for fathers interfering in general, but if ever there\nwas a case, this is! Why, it is almost actionable--injuring your whole\nprospects in life, and all because he will not take the trouble to make\nan investigation! It is a crying shame.”\n\n“Every fellow in the school knows how it was,” said Norman; “and plenty\nof them would be glad to tell, if they had only the opportunity; but he\nasked no one but those two or three worst fellows that were at the fire,\nand they would not tell, on purpose. The school will go to destruction\nnow--they’ll get their way, and all I have been striving for is utterly\nundone.”\n\n“You setting a bad example! Dr. Hoxton little knows what you have been\ndoing. It is a mockery, as I have always said, to see that old fellow\nsit wrapped up in his pomposity, eating his good dinners, and knowing no\nmore what goes on among his boys than this umbrella! But he will listen\nto me--and we’ll make those boys confess the whole--ay, and have up\nBallhatchet himself, to say what your traffic with him was; and we will\nsee what old Hoxton says to you then, Norman.”\n\nDr. May and his son felt keenly and spoke strongly. There was so much of\nsympathy and fellow-feeling between them, that there was no backwardness\non Norman’s part in telling his whole trouble, with more confidence than\nschoolboys often show towards their fathers, and Dr. May entered into\nthe mortification as if he were still at school. They did not go into\nthe house, but walked long up and down the garden, working themselves up\ninto, if possible, stronger indignation, and concerting the explanation\nfor to-morrow, when Dr. May meant to go at once to the head-master, and\nmake him attend to the true version of the story, appealing to Harvey\nAnderson himself, Larkins, and many others, for witnesses. There could\nbe hardly a doubt that Norman would be thus exculpated; but, if Dr.\nHoxton would not see things in their true light, Dr. May was ready to\ntake him away at once, rather than see him suffer injustice.\n\nStill, though comforted by his father’s entire reliance, Norman was\nsuffering severely under the sense of indignity, and grieved that Dr.\nHoxton and the other masters should have believed him guilty--that\nname of May could never again boast of being without reproach. To be in\ndisgrace stung him to the quick, even though undeservedly, and he could\nnot bear to go in, meet his sisters, and be pitied. “There’s no need\nthey should know of it,” said he, when the Minster clock pealing ten\nobliged them to go indoors, and his father agreed. They bade each other\ngood-night, with the renewal of the promise that Dr. Hoxton should be\nforced to hear Norman’s vindication the first thing to-morrow, Harvey\nAnderson be disappointed of what he meanly triumphed in, and Norman\nbe again in his post at the head of the school, in more honour and\nconfidence than ever, putting down evil, and making Stoneborough what it\nought to be.\n\nAs Dr. May lay awake in the summer’s morning, meditating on his address\nto Dr. Hoxton, he heard the unwelcome sound of a ring at the bell, and,\nin a few minutes, a note was brought to him.\n\n“Tell Adams to get the gig ready--I’ll let him know whether he is to go\nwith me.”\n\nAnd, in a few minutes, the doctor opened Norman’s door, and found him\ndressed, and standing by the window, reading. “What, up already, Norman?\nI came to tell you that our affairs must wait till the afternoon. It\nis very provoking, for Hoxton may be gone out, but Mr. Lake’s son, at\nGroveswood, has an attack on the head, and I must go at once. It is a\ncouple of dozen miles off or more. I have hardly ever been there, and it\nmay keep me all day.”\n\n“Shall you go in the gig? Shall I drive you?” said Norman, looking\nrather blank.\n\n“That’s what I thought of, if you like it. I thought you would sooner be\nout of the way.”\n\n“Thank you--yes, papa. Shall I come and help you to finish dressing?”\n\n“Yes, do, thank you; it will hasten matters. Only, first order in some\nbreakfast. What makes you up so early? Have not you slept?”\n\n“Not much--it has been such a hot night.”\n\n“And you have a headache. Well, we will find a cure for that before the\nday is over. I have settled what to say to old Hoxton.”\n\nBefore another quarter of an hour had passed, they were driving through\nthe deep lanes, the long grass thickly laden with morning dew, which\nbeaded the webs of the spiders and rose in clouds of mist under the\ninfluence of the sun’s rays. There was stillness in the air at first,\nthen the morning sounds, the labourer going forth, the world wakening to\nlife, the opening houses, the children coming out to school. In spite of\nthe tumult of feeling, Norman could not but be soothed and refreshed\nby the new and fair morning scene, and both minds quitted the school\npolitics, as Dr. May talked of past enjoyment of walks or drives home\nin early dawn, the more delicious after a sad watch in a sick-room, and\ntold of the fair sights he had seen at such unwonted hours.\n\nThey had far to go, and the heat of the day had come on before they\nentered the place of their destination. It was a woodland village, built\non a nook in the side of the hill, sloping greenly to the river, and\nshut in by a white gate, which seemed to gather all in one the little\nold-fashioned church, its yard, shaded with trees, and enclosed by long\nwhite rails; the parsonage, covered with climbing plants and in the\nmidst of a gay garden; and one or two cottages. The woods cast a cool\nshadow, and, in the meadows by the river rose cocks of new-made hay;\nthere was an air of abiding serenity about the whole place, save\nthat there stood an old man by the gate, evidently watching for the\nphysician’s carriage; and where the sun fell on that parsonage-house was\na bedroom window wide open, with the curtains drawn.\n\n“Thank Heaven you are come, sir,” said the old man; “he is fearfully\nbad.”\n\nNorman knew young Lake, who had been a senior boy when he first went to\nschool, was a Randall scholar, and had borne an excellent character,\nand highly distinguished himself at the university. And now, by all\naccounts, he seemed to be dying--in the height of honour and general\nesteem. Dr. May went into the house, the old man took the horse, and\nNorman lingered under the trees in the churchyard, watching the white\ncurtains now and then puffed by the fitful summer breeze, as he lay on\nthe turf in the shade, under the influence of the gentle sadness\naround, resting, mind and body, from the tossing tumultuous passionate\nsensations that had kept him restless and miserable through the hot\nnight.\n\nHe waited long--one hour, two hours had passed away, but he was not\nimpatient, and hardly knew how long the time had been before his father\nand Mr. Lake came out of the house together, and, after they parted, Dr.\nMay summoned him. He of course asked first for the patient. “Not quite\nso hopeless as at first,” and the reasons for having been kept so long\nwere detailed, with many circumstances of the youth’s illness, and the\nparents’ resignation, by which Dr. May was still too deeply touched to\nhave room in his mind for anything besides.\n\nThey were more than half-way home, and a silence had succeeded the\nconversation about the Lake family, when Norman spoke:\n\n“Papa, I have been thinking about it, and I believe it would be better\nto let it alone, if you please.”\n\n“Not apply to Dr. Hoxton!” exclaimed his father.\n\n“Well, I think not. I have been considering it, and it does hardly seem\nto me the right thing. You see, if I had not you close at hand, this\ncould never be explained, and it seems rather hard upon Anderson, who\nhas no father, and the other fellows, who have theirs farther off--”\n\n“Right, Norman, that is what my father before me always said, and the\nway I have always acted myself; much better let a few trifles go on not\njust as one would wish, than be for ever interfering. But I really think\nthis is a case for it, and I don’t think you ought to let yourself be\ninfluenced by the fear of any party-spirit.”\n\n“It is not only that, papa--I have been thinking a good deal to-day, and\nthere are other reasons. Of course I should wish Dr. Hoxton to know that\nI spoke the truth about that walk, and I hope you will let him know, as\nI appealed to you. But, on cooler thoughts, I don’t believe Dr. Hoxton\ncould seriously suspect me of such a thing as that, and it was not on\nthat ground that I am turned down, but that I did not keep up sufficient\ndiscipline, and allowed the outrage, as he calls it. Now, you know, that\nis, after a fashion, true. If I had not gone on like an ass the other\nday, and incited them to pull down the fences, they would not have done\nit afterwards, and perhaps I ought to have kept on guard longer. It was\nmy fault, and we can’t deny it.”\n\nDr. May made a restless, reluctant movement. “Well, well, I suppose it\nwas--but it was just as much Harvey Anderson’s--and is he to get the\nscholarship because he has added meanness to the rest?”\n\n“He was not dux,” said Norman, with a sigh. “It was more shabby than I\nthought was even in him. But I don’t know that the feeling about him is\nnot one reason. There has always been a rivalry and bitterness between\nus two, and if I were to get the upper hand now, by means not in the\nusual course, such as the fellows would think ill of, it would be worse\nthan ever, and I should always feel guilty and ashamed to look at him.”\n\n“Over-refining, Norman,” muttered Dr. May.\n\n“Besides, don’t you remember, when his father died, how glad you and\neveryone were to get him a nomination, and it was said that if he gained\na scholarship it would be such a relief to poor Mrs. Anderson? Now he\nhas this chance, it does seem hard to deprive her of it. I should not\nlike to know that I had done so.”\n\n“Whew!” the doctor gave a considering whistle.\n\n“You could not make it straight, papa, without explaining about the\ndealing with Ballhatchet, and that would be unfair to them all, even the\nold rogue himself; for I promised to say nothing about former practices,\nas long as he did not renew them.”\n\n“Well! I don’t want to compromise you, Norman. You know your own ground\nbest, but I don’t like it at all. You don’t know the humiliation\nof disgrace. Those who have thought highly of you, now thinking you\nchanged--I don’t know how to bear it for you.”\n\n“I don’t mind anything while you trust me,” said Norman, eagerly; “not\nmuch I mean, except Mr. Wilmot. You must judge, papa, and do as you\nplease.”\n\n“No, you must judge, Norman. Your confidence in me ought not to be a\nrestraint. It has always been an understood thing that what you say\nat home is as if it had not been said, as regards my dealings with the\nmasters.”\n\n“I know, papa. Well, I’ll tell you what brought me to this. I tumbled\nabout all night in a rage, when I thought how they had served me, and\nof Hoxton’s believing it all, and how he might only half give in to your\nrepresentation, and then I gloried in Anderson’s coming down from his\nheight, and being seen in his true colours. So it went on till morning\ncame, and I got up. You know you gave me my mother’s little ‘Thomas\na Kempis’. I always read a bit every morning. To-day it was, ‘Of four\nthings that bring much inward peace’. And what do you think they were?--\n\n\n    “‘Be desirous, my son, to do the will of another\n        rather than thine own.\n     Choose always to have less rather than more.\n     Seek always the lowest place, and to be inferior\n        to everyone.\n     Wish always and pray that the will of God may be\n        wholly fulfilled in thee.’\n\n\n“I liked them the more, because it was just like her last reading with\nus, and like that letter. Well, then I wondered as I lay on the grass\nat Groveswood, whether she would have thought it best for me to be\nreinstated, and I found out that I should have been rather afraid of\nwhat you might say when she had talked it over with you.”\n\nDr. May smiled a little at the simplicity with which this last was said,\nbut his smile ended in one of his heavy sighs. “So you took her for your\ncounsellor, my boy. That was the way to find out what was right.”\n\n“Well, there was something in the place and, in watching poor Lake’s\nwindows, that made me not able to dwell so much on getting on, and\nhaving prizes and scholarships. I thought that caring for those had been\ndriven out of me, and you know I never felt as if it were my right when\nI was made dux; but now I find it is all come back. It does not do\nfor me to be first; I have been what she called elated, and been more\nperemptory than need with the lower boys, and gone on in my old way with\nRichard, and so I suppose this disgrace has come to punish me. I wish\nit were not disgrace, because of our name at school, and because it\nwill vex Harry so much; but since it is come, considering all things,\nI suppose I ought not to struggle to justify myself at other people’s\nexpense.”\n\nHis eyes were so dazzled with tears that he could hardly see to drive,\nnor did his father speak at first. “I can’t say anything against it,\nNorman, but I am sorry, and one thing more you should consider. If Dr.\nHoxton should view this absurd business in the way he seems to do, it\nwill stand in your way for ever in testimonials, if you try for anything\nelse.”\n\n“Do you think it will interfere with my having a Confirmation ticket?”\n\n“Why no, I should not think--such a boyish escapade could be no reason\nfor refusing you one.”\n\n“Very well then, it had better rest. If there should be any difficulty\nabout my being confirmed, of course we will explain it.”\n\n“I wish every one showed themselves as well prepared!” half muttered\nthe doctor; then, after long musing, “Well, Norman, I give up the\nscholarship. Poor Mrs. Anderson wants it more than we do, and if the boy\nis a shabby fellow the more he wants a decent education. But what do\nyou say to this? I make Hoxton do you full justice, and reinstate you\nin your proper place, and then I take you away at once--send you to a\ntutor--anything, till the end of the long vacation.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Norman, pausing. “I don’t know, papa. I am very\nmuch obliged to you, but I think it would hardly do. You would be\nuncomfortable at seeming to quarrel with Dr. Hoxton, and it would be\nhardly creditable for me to go off in anger.”\n\n“You are right, I believe,” said Dr. May. “You judge wisely, though I\nshould not have ventured to ask it of you. But what is to become of the\ndiscipline of the school? Is that all to go to the dogs?”\n\n“I could not do anything with them if I were restored in this way; they\nwould be more set against me. It is bad enough as it is, but, even for\nmy own peace, I believe it is better to leave it alone. All my comfort\nin school is over, I know!” and he sighed deeply.\n\n“It is a most untoward business!” said the doctor. “I am very sorry your\nschooldays should be clouded--but it can’t be helped, and you will work\nyourself into a character again. You are full young, and can stay for\nthe next Randall.”\n\nNorman felt as if, while his father looked at him as he now did, the\nrest of the world were nothing to him; but, perhaps, the driving past\nthe school brought him to a different mind, for he walked into the house\nslowly and dejectedly.\n\nHe told his own story to Ethel, in the garden, not without much\ndifficulty, so indignant were her exclamations; and it was impossible to\nmake her see that his father’s interference would put him in an awkward\nposition among the boys. She would argue vehemently that she could not\nbear Mr. Wilmot to think ill of him, that it was a great shame of Dr.\nHoxton, and that it was dreadful to let such a boy as Harvey Anderson go\nunpunished. “I really do think it is quite wrong of you to give up your\nchance of doing good, and leave him in his evil ways!” That was all\nthe comfort she gave Norman, and she walked in to pour out a furious\ngrumbling upon Margaret.\n\nDr. May had been telling the elder ones, and they were in conversation\nafter he had left them--Margaret talking with animation, and Flora\nsitting over her drawing, uttering reluctant assents. “Has he told you,\npoor fellow?” asked Margaret.\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel. “Was there ever such a shame?”\n\n“That is just what I say,” observed Flora. “I cannot see why the\nAndersons are to have a triumph over all of us.”\n\n“I used to think Harvey the best of the two,” said Ethel. “Now I think\nhe is a great deal the worst. Taking advantage of such a mistake as\nthis! How will he ever look Norman in the face!”\n\n“Really,” said Margaret, “I see no use in aggravating ourselves by\ntalking of the Andersons.”\n\n“I can’t think how papa can consent,” proceeded Flora. “I am sure, if I\nwere in his place, I should not!”\n\n“Papa is so much pleased with dear Norman’s behaviour that it quite\nmakes up for all the disappointment,” said Margaret. “Besides, he is\nvery much obliged to him in one way; he would not have liked to have\nto battle the matter with Dr. Hoxton. He spoke of Norman’s great good\njudgment.”\n\n“Yes, Norman can persuade papa to anything,” said Flora.\n\n“Yes, I wish papa had not yielded,” said Ethel. “It would have been just\nas noble in dear Norman, and we should not have the apparent disgrace.”\n\n“Perhaps it is best as it is, after all,” said Flora.\n\n“Why, how do you mean?” said Ethel.\n\n“I think very likely things might have come out. Now don’t look\nfurious, Ethel. Indeed, I can’t help it, but really I don’t think it\nis explicable why Norman should wish to hush it up, unless there were\nsomething behind!”\n\n“Flora!” cried Ethel, too much shocked to bring out another word.\n\n“If you are unfortunate enough to have such suspicions,” said Margaret\nquietly, “I think it would be better to be silent.”\n\n“As if you did not know Norman!” stammered Ethel.\n\n“Well,” said Flora, “I don’t wish to think so. You know I did not hear\nNorman himself, and when papa gives his vehement accounts of things, it\nalways puzzles us of the cooler-minded sort.”\n\n“It is as great a shame as ever I heard!” cried Ethel, recovering her\nutterance. “Who would you trust, if not your own father and brother?”\n\n“Yes, yes,” said Flora, not by any means wishing to displease her\nsisters. “If there is such a thing as an excess of generosity, it is\nsure to be among ourselves. I only know it does not suit me. It will\nmake us all uncomfortable whenever we meet the Andersons or Mr. Wilmot,\nor any one else, and as to such tenderness to Harvey Anderson, I think\nit is thrown away.”\n\n“Thrown away on the object, perhaps,” said Margaret, “but not in\nNorman.”\n\n“To be sure,” broke out Ethel. “Better be than seem! Oh, dear! I am\nsorry I was vexed with dear old June when he told me. I had rather have\nhim now than if he had gained everything, and every one was praising\nhim--that I had! Harvey Anderson is welcome to be dux and Randall\nscholar for what I care, while Norman is--while he is, just what we\nthought of the last time we read that Gospel--you know, Margaret?”\n\n“He is--that he is,” said Margaret, “and, indeed, it is most beautiful\nto see how what has happened has brought him at once to what she wished,\nwhen, perhaps, otherwise it would have been a work of long time.”\n\nEthel was entirely consoled. Flora thought of the words “tete exaltee”\n and considered herself alone to have sober sense enough to see things in\na true light--not that she went the length of believing that Norman had\nany underhand motives, but she thought it very discreet in her to think\na prudent father would not have been satisfied with such a desire to\navoid investigation.\n\nDr. May would not trust himself to enter on the subject with Dr. Hoxton\nin conversation; he only wrote a note.\n\n\n                                “June 16th.\n\n“Dear Dr. Hoxton,\n\n“My son has appealed to me to confirm his account of himself on Thursday\nevening last. I therefore distinctly state that he came in at half-past\nnine, with his hands full of plants from the river, and that he then\nwent out again, by my desire, to look for his little brother.\n\n                              --Yours very truly,\n                                   R. May.”\n\n\nA long answer came in return, disclaiming all doubt of Norman’s\nveracity, and explaining Dr. Hoxton’s grounds for having degraded him.\nThere had been misconduct in the school, he said, for some time past,\nand he did not consider that it was any very serious reproach, to a\nboy of Norman’s age, that he had not had weight enough to keep up his\nauthority, and had been carried away by the general feeling. It had been\nnecessary to make an example for the sake of principle, and though very\nsorry it should have fallen on one of such high promise and general good\nconduct, Dr. Hoxton trusted that it would not be any permanent injury to\nhis prospects, as his talents had raised him to his former position in\nthe school so much earlier than usual.\n\n“The fact was,” said Dr. May, “that old Hoxton did it in a passion,\nfeeling he must punish somebody, and now, finding there’s no uproar\nabout it, he begins to be sorry. I won’t answer this note. I’ll stop\nafter church to-morrow and shake hands, and that will show we don’t bear\nmalice.”\n\nWhat Mr. Wilmot might think was felt by all to affect them more nearly.\nEthel wanted to hear that he declared his complete conviction of\nNorman’s innocence, and was disappointed to find that he did not once\nallude to the subject. She was only consoled by Margaret’s conjecture\nthat, perhaps, he thought the headmaster had been hasty, and could not\nventure to say so--he saw into people’s characters, and it was notorious\nthat it was just what Dr. Hoxton did not.\n\nTom had spent the chief of that Saturday in reading a novel borrowed\nfrom Axworthy, keeping out of sight of every one. All Sunday he avoided\nNorman more scrupulously than ever, and again on Monday. That day was a\nsevere trial to Norman; the taking the lower place, and the sense that,\nexcel as much as ever he might in his studies, it would not avail to\nrestore him to his former place, were more unpleasant, when it came to\nthe point, than he had expected.\n\nHe saw the cold manner, so different from the readiness with which his\ntasks had always been met, certain as they were of being well done; he\nfound himself among the common herd whom he had passed so triumphantly,\nand, for a little while, he had no heart to exert himself.\n\nThis was conquered by the strong will and self-rebuke for having merely\ncraved for applause, but, in the play-ground, he found himself still\nalone--the other boys who had been raised by his fall shrank from\nintercourse with one whom they had injured by their silence, and the\nAndersons, who were wont to say the Mays carried every tale home, and\nwho still almost expected interference from Dr. May, hardly believed\ntheir victory secure, and the younger one, at least, talked spitefully,\nand triumphed in the result of May’s meddling and troublesome over\nstrictness. “Such prigs always come to a downfall,” was the sentiment.\n\nNorman found himself left out of everything, and stood dispirited and\nweary on the bank of the river, wishing for Harry, wishing for Cheviot,\nwishing that he had been able to make a friend who would stand by\nhim, thinking it could not be worse if he had let his father reinstate\nhim--and a sensation of loneliness and injustice hung heavy at his\nheart.\n\nHis first interruption was a merry voice. “I say, June, there’s no\nend of river cray-fish under that bank,” and Larkins’s droll face was\nlooking up at him, from that favourite position, half stooping, his\nhands on his knees, his expression of fun trying to conceal his real\nanxiety and sympathy.\n\nNorman turned and smiled, and looked for the cray-fish, and, at the same\ntime, became aware of Hector Ernescliffe, watching for an opportunity to\nsay, “I have a letter from Alan.” He knew they wanted, as far as little\nboys ventured to seek after one so much their elder, to show themselves\nhis friends, and he was grateful; he roused himself to hear about Alan’s\nnews, and found it was important--his great friend, Captain Gordon, had\ngot a ship, and hoped to be able to take him, and this might lead to\nHarry’s going with him. Then Norman applied himself to the capture of\ncray-fish, and Larkins grew so full of fun and drollery, that the hours\nof recreation passed off less gloomily than they had begun.\n\nIf only his own brother would have been his adherent! But he saw almost\nnothing of Tom. Day after day he missed him, he was off before him in\ngoing and returning from school, and when he caught a sight of his face,\nit looked harassed, pale, and miserable, stealing anxious glances after\nhim, yet shrinking from his eye. But, at the same time, Norman did not\nsee him mingling with his former friends, and could not make out how he\ndisposed of himself. To be thus continually shunned by his own brother,\neven when the general mass were returning to ordinary terms, became\nso painful, that Norman was always on the watch to seek for one more\nconversation with him.\n\nHe caught him at last in the evening, just as they were going home.\n“Tom, why are you running away? Come with me,” said he authoritatively;\nand Tom obeyed in trembling.\n\nNorman led the way to the meads. “Tom,” said he, “do not let this go on.\nWhy do you serve me in this way? You surely need not turn against me,”\n he said, with pleading melancholy in his voice.\n\nIt was not needed. Tom had flung himself upon the grass, and was in an\nagony of crying, even before he had finished the words.\n\n“Tom, Tom! what is the matter? Have they been bullying you again? Look\nup, and tell me--what is it? You know I can stand by you still, if\nyou’ll only let me;” and Norman sat by him on the grass, and raised his\nface by a sort of force, but the kind words only brought more piteous\nsobs. It was a long time before they diminished enough to let him utter\na word, but Norman went on patiently consoling and inquiring, sure, at\nleast, that here had broken down the sullenness that had always repelled\nhim.\n\nAt last came the words, “Oh! I cannot bear it. It is all my doing!”\n\n“What--how--you don’t mean this happening to me? It is not your doing,\nAugust--what fancy is this?”\n\n“Oh, yes, it is,” said Tom, his voice cut short by gasps, the remains\nof the sobs. “They would not hear me! I tried to tell them how you\ntold them not, and sent them home. I tried to tell about\nBallhatchet--but--but they wouldn’t--they said if it had been Harry,\nthey would have attended--but they would not believe me. Oh! if Harry\nwas but here!”\n\n“I wish he was,” said Norman, from the bottom of his heart; “but you\nsee, Tom, if this sets you on always telling truth, I shan’t think any\ngreat harm done.”\n\nA fresh burst, “Oh, they are all so glad! They say such things! And the\nMays were never in disgrace before. Oh, Norman, Norman!”\n\n“Never mind about that--” began Norman.\n\n“But you would mind,” broke in the boy passionately, “if you knew what\nAnderson junior and Axworthy say! They say it serves you right, and they\nwere going to send me to old Ballhatchet’s to get some of his stuff to\ndrink confusion to the mouth of June, and all pragmatical meddlers; and\nwhen I said I could not go, they vowed if I did not, I should eat the\ncorks for them! And Anderson junior called me names, and licked me. Look\nthere.” He showed a dark blue-and-red stripe raised on the palm of his\nhand. “I could not write well for it these three days, and Hawes gave me\ndouble copies!”\n\n“The cowardly fellows!” exclaimed Norman indignantly. “But you did not\ngo?”\n\n“No, Anderson senior stopped them. He said he would not have the\nBallhatchet business begin again.”\n\n“That is one comfort,” said Norman. “I see he does not dare not to keep\norder. But if you’ll only stay with me, August, I’ll take care they\ndon’t hurt you.”\n\n“Oh, June! June!” and he threw himself across his kind brother. “I am so\nvery sorry! Oh! to see you put down--and hear them! And you to lose the\nscholarship! Oh, dear! oh, dear! and be in disgrace with them all!”\n\n“But, Tom, do cheer up. It is nothing to be in such distress at. Papa\nknows all about it, and while he does, I don’t care half so much.”\n\n“Oh, I wish--I wish--”\n\n“You see, Tom,” said Norman, “after all, though it is very kind of you\nto be sorry for not being able to get me out of this scrape, the thing\none wants you to be sorry about is your own affair.”\n\n“I wish I had never come to school! I wish Anderson would leave me\nalone! It is all his fault! A mean-spirited, skulking, bullying--”\n\n“Hush, hush, Tom, he is bad enough, but now you know what he is, you\ncan keep clear of him for the future. Now listen. You and I will make\na fresh start, and try if we can’t get the Mays to be looked on as they\nwere when Harry was here. Let us mind the rules, and get into no more\nmischief.”\n\n“You’ll keep me from Ned Anderson and Axworthy?” whispered Tom.\n\n“Yes, that I will. And you’ll try and speak the truth, and be\nstraightforward?”\n\n“I will, I will,” said Tom, worn out in spirits by his long bondage, and\nglad to catch at the hope of relief and protection.\n\n“Then let us come home,” and Tom put his hand into his brother’s, as a\nfew weeks back would have seemed most unworthy of schoolboy dignity.\n\nThenceforth Tom was devoted to Norman, and kept close to him, sure that\nthe instant he was from under his wing his former companions would fall\non him to revenge his defection, but clinging to him also from real\naffection and gratitude. Indolence and timidity were the true root of\nwhat had for a time seemed like a positively bad disposition; beneath,\nthere was a warm heart, and sense of right, which had been almost\nstifled for the time, in the desire, from moment to moment, to avoid\npresent trouble or fear. Under Norman’s care his better self had\nfreer scope, he was guarded from immediate terror, and kept from the\nsuggestions of the worse sort of boys, as much as was in his brother’s\npower; and the looks they cast towards him, and the sly torments they\nattempted to inflict, by no means invited him back to them. The lessons,\nwhere he had a long inveterate habit of shuffling, came under Norman’s\neye at the same time. He always prepared them in his presence,\ninstead of in the most secret manner possible, and with all Anderson’s\nexpeditious modes of avoiding the making them of any use. Norman sat by,\nand gave such help as was fair and just, showed him how to learn, and\nexplained difficulties, and the ingenuity hitherto spent in eluding\nlearning being now directed to gaining it, he began to make real\nprogress and find satisfaction in it. The comfort of being good dawned\nupon him once more, but still there was much to contend with; he had\nacquired such a habit of prevarication that, if by any means taken by\nsurprise, his impulse was to avoid giving a straightforward answer,\nand when he recollected his sincerity, the truth came with the air of\nfalsehood. Moreover, he was an arrant coward, and provoked tricks by his\nmanifest and unreasonable terrors. It was no slight exercise of patience\nthat Norman underwent, but this was the interest he had made for\nhimself; and the recovery of the boy’s attachment, and his improvement,\nthough slow, were a present recompense.\n\nErnescliffe, Larkins, and others of the boys, held fast to him, and\nafter the first excitement was past, all the rest returned to their\nformer tone. He was decidedly as much respected as ever, and, at the\nsame time, regarded with more favour than when his strictness was\nresented. And as for the discipline of the school, that did not suffer.\nAnderson felt that, for his own credit, he must not allow the rules\nto be less observed than in May’s reign, and he enforced them upon the\nreluctant and angry boys with whom he had been previously making common\ncause. Dr. Hoxton boasted to the under-masters that the school had never\nbeen in such good order as under Anderson, little guessing that this was\nbut reaping the fruits of a past victory, or that every boy in the whole\nschool gave the highest place in their esteem to the deposed dux.\n\nTo Anderson, Norman’s cordial manner and ready support were the\nstrangest part of all, only explained by thinking that he deemed it, as\nhe tried to do himself, merely the fortune of war, and was sensible of\nno injury.\n\nAnd, for Norman himself, when the first shock was over, and he was\naccustomed to the change, he found the cessation of vigilance a relief,\nand carried a lighter heart than any time since his mother’s death.\nHis sisters could not help observing that there was less sadness in the\nexpression of his eyes, that he carried his head higher, walked with\nfreedom and elasticity of step, tossed and flourished the Daisy till she\nshouted and crowed, while Margaret shrank at such freaks; and, though he\nwas not much of a laugher himself, contributed much sport in the way of\nbright apposite sayings to the home circle.\n\nIt was a very unexpected mode of cure for depression of spirits, but\nthere could be no question that it succeeded; and when, a few Saturdays\nafter, he drove Dr. May again to Groveswood to see young Mr. Lake,\nwho was recovering, he brought Margaret home a whole pile of botanical\ncuriosities, and drew his father into an animated battle over natural\nand Linnaean systems, which kept the whole party merry with the pros and\ncons every evening for a week.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\n\n     Oh! the golden-hearted daisies,\n       Witnessed there before my youth,\n     To the truth of things, with praises\n       Of the beauty of the truth.--E. B. BROWNING.\n\n\n“Margaret, see here.”\n\nThe doctor threw into her lap a letter, which made her cheeks light up.\n\nMr. Ernescliffe wrote that his father’s friend, Captain Gordon, having\nbeen appointed to the frigate Alcestis, had chosen him as one of his\nlieutenants, and offered a nomination as naval cadet for his brother. He\nhad replied that the navy was not Hector’s destination, but, as Captain\nGordon had no one else in view, had prevailed on him to pass on the\nproposal to Harry May.\n\nAlan wrote in high terms of his captain, declaring that he esteemed the\nhaving sailed with him as one of the greatest advantages he had ever\nreceived, and adding that, for his own part, Dr. May needed no promise\nfrom him to be assured that he would watch over Harry like his own\nbrother. It was believed that the Alcestis was destined for the South\nAmerican station.\n\n“A three years’ business,” said Dr. May, with a sigh. “But the thing is\ndone, and this is as good as we can hope.”\n\n“Far better!” said Margaret. “What pleasure it must have given him! Dear\nHarry could not sail under more favourable circumstances.”\n\n“No, I would trust to Ernescliffe as I would to Richard. It is kindly\ndone, and I will thank him at once. Where does he date from?”\n\n“From Portsmouth. He does not say whether he has seen Harry.”\n\n“I suppose he waited for my answer. Suppose I enclose a note for him to\ngive to Harry. There will be rapture enough, and it is a pity he should\nnot have the benefit of it.”\n\nThe doctor sat down to write, while Margaret worked and mused, perhaps\non outfits and new shirts--perhaps on Harry’s lion-locks, beneath a blue\ncap and gold band, or, perchance, on the coral shoals of the Pacific.\n\nIt was one of the quiet afternoons, when all the rest were out, and\nwhich the doctor and his daughter especially valued, when they were able\nto spend one together without interruption. Soon, however, a ring at\nthe door brought an impatient exclamation from the doctor; but his smile\nbeamed out at the words, “Miss Rivers.” They were great friends; in\nfact, on terms of some mutual sauciness, though Meta was, as yet, far\nless at home with his daughters, and came in, looking somewhat shy.\n\n“Ah, your congeners are gone out!” was the doctor’s reception. “You must\nput up with our sober selves.”\n\n“Is Flora gone far?” asked Meta.\n\n“To Cocksmoor,” said Margaret. “I am very sorry she has missed you.”\n\n“Shall I be in your way?” said Meta timidly. “Papa has several things to\ndo, and said he would call for me here.”\n\n“Good luck for Margaret,” said Dr. May.\n\n“So they are gone to Cocksmoor!” said Meta. “How I envy them!”\n\n“You would not if you saw the place,” said Dr. May. “I believe Norman is\nvery angry with me for letting them go near it.”\n\n“Ah! but they are of real use there!”\n\n“And Miss Meta is obliged to take to envying the black-hole of\nCocksmoor, instead of being content with the eglantine bowers of\nAbbotstoke! I commiserate her!” said the doctor.\n\n“If I did any good instead of harm at Abbotstoke!”\n\n“Harm!” exclaimed Margaret.\n\n“They went on very well without me,” said Meta; “but ever since I have\nhad the class they have been getting naughtier and noisier every Sunday;\nand, last Sunday, the prettiest of all--the one I liked best, and had\ndone everything for--she began to mimic me--held up her finger, as I\ndid, and made them all laugh!”\n\n“Well, that is very bad!” said Margaret; “but I suppose she was a very\nlittle one.”\n\n“No, a quick clever one, who knew much better, about nine years old. She\nused to be always at home in the week, dragging about a great baby; and\nwe managed that her mother should afford to stay at home and send her to\nschool. It seemed such a pity her cleverness should be wasted.”\n\nThe doctor smiled. “Ah! depend upon it, the tyrant-baby was the best\ndisciplinarian.”\n\nMeta looked extremely puzzled.\n\n“Papa means,” said Margaret, “that if she was inclined to be conceited,\nthe being teased at home might do her more good than being brought\nforward at school.”\n\n“I have done everything wrong, it seems,” said Meta, with a shade of\nwhat the French call depit. “I thought it must be right and good--but\nit has only done mischief; and now papa says they are an ungrateful set,\nand that, if it vexes me, I had better have no more to do with them!”\n\n“It does not vex you so much as that, I hope,” said Margaret.\n\n“Oh, I could not bear that!” said Meta; “but it is so different from\nwhat I thought!”\n\n“Ah! you had an Arcadia of good little girls in straw hats, such as I\nsee in Blanche’s little books,” said the doctor, “all making the young\nlady an oracle, and doing wrong--if they do it at all--in the simplest\nway, just for an example to the others.”\n\n“Dr. May! How can you know so well? But do you really think it is their\nfault, or mine?”\n\n“Do you think me a conjurer?”\n\n“Well, but what do you think?”\n\n“What do Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wilmot think?”\n\n“I know Mrs. Wilmot thinks I spoil my class. She spoke to me about\nmaking favourites, and sometimes has seemed surprised at things which\nI have done. Last Sunday she told me she thought I had better have a\nsteadier class, and I know whom she will give me--the great big, stupid\nones, at the bottom of the first class! I do believe it is only out\nof good-nature that she does not tell me not to teach at all. I have a\ngreat mind I will not; I know I do nothing but harm.”\n\n“What shall you say if I tell you I think so too?” asked the doctor.\n\n“Oh, Dr. May, you don’t really? Now, does he, Miss May? I am sure I only\nwant to do them good. I don’t know what I can have done.”\n\nMargaret made her perceive that the doctor was smiling, and she changed\nher tone, and earnestly begged to be told what they thought of the case;\nfor if she should show her concern at home, her father and governess\nwould immediately beg her to cease from all connection with the school,\nand she did not feel at all convinced that Mrs. Wilmot liked to have her\nthere. Feeling injured by the implied accusation of mismanagement, yet,\nwith a sense of its truth, used to be petted, and new to rebuffs, yet\nwith a sincere wish to act rightly, she was much perplexed by this, her\nfirst reverse, and had come partly with the view of consulting Flora,\nthough she had fallen on other counsellors.\n\n“Margaret, our adviser general,” said the doctor, “what do you say? Put\nyourself in the place of Mrs. Charles Wilmot, and say, shall Miss Rivers\nteach or not?”\n\n“I had rather you would, papa.”\n\n“Not I--I never kept school.”\n\n“Well, then, I being Mrs. Wilmot, should certainly be mortified if Miss\nRivers deserted me because the children were naughty. I think, I think I\nhad rather she came and asked me what she had better do.”\n\n“And you would answer ‘teach,’ for fear of vexing her,” said Meta.\n\n“I should, and also for the sake of letting her learn to teach.”\n\n“The point where only trial shows one’s ignorance,” said Dr. May.\n\n“But I don’t want to do it for my own sake,” said Meta. “I do everything\nfor my own sake already.”\n\n“For theirs, then,” said the doctor. “If teaching will not come by\nnature, you must serve an apprenticeship, if you mean to be of service\nin that line. Perhaps it was the gift that the fairies omitted.”\n\n“But will it do any good to them?”\n\n“I can’t tell; but I am sure it would do them harm for you to give it\nup, because it is disagreeable.”\n\n“Well,” said Meta, with a sigh, “I’ll go and talk to Mrs. Wilmot. I\ncould not bear to give up anything that seems right just now, because of\nthe Confirmation.”\n\nMargaret eagerly inquired, and it appeared that the bishop had given\nnotice for a Confirmation in August, and that Mr. Wilmot was already\nbeginning to prepare his candidates, whilst Mr. Ramsden, always tardy,\nnever gave notice till the last moment possible. The hope was expressed\nthat Harry might be able to profit by this opportunity; and Harry’s\nprospects were explained to Meta; then the doctor, recollecting\nsomething that he wished to say to Mr. Rivers, began to ask about the\nchance of his coming before the time of an engagement of his own.\n\n“He said he should be here at about half-past four,” said Meta. “He is\ngone to the station to inquire about the trains. Do you know what time\nthe last comes in?”\n\n“At nine forty-five,” said the doctor.\n\n“That is what we were afraid of. It is for Bellairs, my maid. Her mother\nis very ill, and she is afraid she is not properly nursed. It is about\nfive miles from the Milbury Station, and we thought of letting her go\nwith a day-ticket to see about her. She could go in the morning, after\nI am up; but I don’t know what is to be done, for she could not get back\nbefore I dress for dinner.”\n\nMargaret felt perfectly aghast at the cool tone, especially after what\nhad passed.\n\n“It would be quite impossible,” said the doctor. “Even going by the\neight o’clock train, and returning by the last, she would only have two\nhours to spare--short enough measure for a sick mother.”\n\n“Papa means to give her whatever she wants for any nurse she may get.”\n\n“Is there no one with her mother now?”\n\n“A son’s wife, who, they think, is not kind. Poor Bellairs was so\ngrateful for being allowed to go home. I wonder if I could dress for\nonce without her?”\n\n“Do you know old Crabbe?” said the doctor.\n\n“The dear old man at Abbotstoke? Oh, yes, of course.”\n\n“There was a very sad case in his family. The mother was dying of\na lingering illness, when the son met with a bad accident. The only\ndaughter was a lady’s-maid, and could not be spared, though the brother\nwas half crazy to see her, and there was no one to tend them but a\nwretch of a woman, paid by the parish. The poor fellow kept calling for\nhis sister in his delirium, and, at last, I could not help writing to\nthe mistress.”\n\n“Did she let her come?” said Meta, her cheek glowing.\n\n“As a great favour, she let her set out by the mail train, after\ndressing her for a ball, with orders to return in time for her toilette\nfor an evening party the next day.”\n\n“Oh, I remember,” said Margaret, “her coming here at five in the\nmorning, and your taking her home.”\n\n“And when we got to Abbotstoke the brother was dead. That parish nurse\nhad not attended to my directions, and, I do believe, was the cause of\nit. The mother had had a seizure, and was in the most precarious state.”\n\n“Surely she stayed!”\n\n“It was as much as her place was worth,” said the doctor; “and her wages\nwere the chief maintenance of the family. So she had to go back to dress\nher mistress, while the old woman lay there, wailing after Betsy. She\ndid give warning then, but, before the month was out, the mother was\ndead.”\n\nMeta did not speak, and Dr. May presently rose, saying he should try to\nmeet Mr. Rivers in the town, and went out. Meta sat thoughtful, and at\nlast, sighing, said, “I wonder whether Bellairs’s mother is so very ill?\nI have a great mind to let Susan try to do my hair, and let Bellairs\nstay a little longer. I never thought of that.”\n\n“I do not think you will be sorry,” said Margaret.\n\n“Yes, I shall, for if my hair does not look nice, papa will not be\npleased, and there is Aunt Leonora coming. How odd it will be to be\nwithout Bellairs! I will ask Mrs. Larpent.”\n\n“Oh, yes!” said Margaret. “You must not think we meant to advise; but\npapa has seen so many instances of distress, from servants not spared to\ntheir friends in illness, that he feels strongly on the subject.”\n\n“And I really might have been as cruel as that woman!” said Meta. “Well,\nI hope Mrs. Bellairs may be better, and able to spare her daughter. I\ndon’t know what will become of me without her.”\n\n“I think it will have been a satisfaction in one way,” said Margaret.\n\n“In what way?”\n\n“Don’t you remember what you began by complaining of, that you could not\nbe of use? Now, I fancy this would give you the pleasure of undergoing a\nlittle personal inconvenience for the good of another.”\n\nMeta looked half puzzled, half thoughtful, and Margaret, who was a\nlittle uneasy at the style of counsel she found herself giving, changed\nthe conversation.\n\nIt was a memorable one to little Miss Rivers, opening out to her, as did\nalmost all her meetings with that family, a new scope for thought and\nfor duty. The code to which she had been brought up taught that\nservants were the machines of their employer’s convenience. Good-nature\noccasioned much kindliness of manner and intercourse, and every luxury\nand indulgence was afforded freely; but where there was any want of\naccordance between the convenience of the two parties, there was no\nquestion. The master must be the first object, the servants’ remedy was\nin their own hands.\n\nAmiable as was Mr. Rivers, this, merely from indulgence and want of\nreflection, was his principle; and his daughter had only been acting\non it, though she did not know it, till the feelings that she had\nnever thought of were thus displayed before her. These were her first\npractical lessons that life was not meant to be passed in pleasing\nourselves, and being good-natured at small cost.\n\nIt was an effort. Meta was very dependent, never having been encouraged\nto be otherwise, and Bellairs was like a necessary of life in her\nestimation; but strength of principle came to aid her naturally\nkind-hearted feeling, and she was pleased by the idea of voluntarily\nundergoing a privation so as to test her sincerity.\n\nSo when her father told her of the inconvenient times of the trains, and\ndeclared that Bellairs must give it up, she answered by proposing to let\nher sleep a night or two there, gaily promised to manage very well, and\nsatisfied him.\n\nHer maid’s grateful looks and thanks recompensed her when she made\nthe offer to her, and inspirited her to an energetic coaxing of Mrs.\nLarpent, who, being more fully aware than her father of the needfulness\nof the lady’s-maid, and also very anxious that her darling should appear\nto the best advantage before the expected aunt, Lady Leonora Langdale,\nwas unwilling to grant more than one night at the utmost.\n\nMeta carried the day, and her last assurance to Bellairs was that she\nmight stay as long as seemed necessary to make her mother comfortable.\n\nThereupon Meta found herself more helpful in some matters than she\nhad expected, but at a loss in others. Susan, with all Mrs. Larpent’s\nsupervision, could not quite bring her dress to the air that was so\npeculiarly graceful and becoming; and she often caught her papa’s eye\nlooking at her as if he saw something amiss, and could not discover what\nit was. Then came Aunt Leonora, always very kind to Meta, but the dread\nof the rest of the household, whom she was wont to lecture on the\nproper care of her niece. Miss Rivers was likely to have a considerable\nfortune, and Lady Leonora intended her to be a very fashionable and much\nadmired young lady, under her own immediate protection.\n\nThe two cousins, Leonora and Agatha, talked to her; the one of her\nballs, the other of her music--patronised her, and called her their good\nlittle cousin--while they criticised the stiff set of those unfortunate\nplaits made by Susan, and laughed, as if it was an unheard-of\nconcession, at Bellairs’s holiday.\n\nNevertheless, when “Honoured Miss” received a note, begging for three\ndays’ longer grace, till a niece should come, in whom Bellairs could\nplace full confidence, she took it on herself to return free consent.\nLady Leonora found out what she had done, and reproved her, telling her\nit was only the way to make “those people” presume, and Mrs. Larpent\nwas also taken to task; but, decidedly, Meta did not regret what she had\ndone, though she felt as if she had never before known how to appreciate\ncomfort, when she once more beheld Bellairs stationed at her toilette\ntable.\n\nMeta was asked about her friends. She could not mention any one but Mrs.\nCharles Wilmot and the Misses May.\n\n“Physician’s daughters; oh!” said Lady Leonora.\n\nAnd she proceeded to exhort Mr. Rivers to bring his daughter to London,\nor its neighbourhood, where she might have masters, and be in the way of\nforming intimacies suited to her connections.\n\nMr. Rivers dreaded London--never was well there, and did not like the\ntrouble of moving--while Meta was so attached to the Grange, that she\nentreated him not to think of leaving it, and greatly dreaded her aunt’s\ninfluence. Lady Leonora did, indeed, allow that the Grange was a very\npretty place; her only complaint was the want of suitable society for\nMeta; she could not bear the idea of her growing accustomed--for want of\nsomething better--to the vicar’s wife and the pet doctor’s daughters.\n\nFlora had been long desirous to effect a regular call at Abbotstoke, and\nit was just now that she succeeded. Mrs. Charles Wilmot’s little girl\nwas to have a birthday feast, at which Mary, Blanche, and Aubrey were\nto appear. Flora went in charge of them, and as soon as she had safely\ndeposited them, and appointed Mary to keep Aubrey out of mischief, she\nwalked up to the Grange, not a whit daunted by the report of the very\nfine ladies who were astonishing the natives of Abbotstoke.\n\nShe was admitted, and found herself in the drawing-room, with a quick\nlively-looking lady, whom she perceived to be Lady Leonora, and who\ninstantly began talking to her very civilly. Flora was never at a loss,\nand they got on extremely well; her ease and self-possession, without\nforwardness, telling much to her advantage. Meta came in, delighted to\nsee her, but, of course, the visit resulted in no really intimate talk,\nthough it was not without effect. Flora declared Lady Leonora Langdale\nto be a most charming person; and Lady Leonora, on her side, asked\nMeta who was that very elegant conversible girl. “Flora May,” was\nthe delighted answer, now that the aunt had committed herself by\ncommendation. And she did not retract it; she pronounced Flora to be\nsomething quite out of the common way, and supposed that she had had\nunusual advantages.\n\nMr. Rivers took care to introduce to his sister-in-law Dr. May (who\nwould fain have avoided it), but ended by being in his turn pleased and\nentertained by her brilliant conversation, which she put forth for\nhim, as her instinct showed her that she was talking to a man of high\nability. A perfect gentleman she saw him to be, and making out some\nmutual connections far up in the family tree of the Mackenzies,\nshe decided that the May family were an acquisition, and very good\ncompanions for her niece at present, while not yet come out. So ended\nthe visit, with this great triumph for Meta, who had a strong belief in\nAunt Leonora’s power and infallibility, and yet had not consulted her\nabout Bellairs, nor about the school question.\n\nShe had missed one Sunday’s school on account of her aunt’s visit, but\nthe resolution made beside Margaret’s sofa had not been forgotten. She\nspent her Saturday afternoon in a call on Mrs. Wilmot, ending with a\nwalk through the village; she confessed her ignorance, apologised for\nher blunders, and put herself under the direction which once she had\nfancied too strict and harsh to be followed.\n\nAnd on Sunday she was content to teach the stupid girls, and abstain\nfrom making much of the smooth-faced engaging set. She thought it very\ndull work, but she could feel that it was something not done to please\nherself; and whereas her father had feared she would be dull when her\ncousins were gone, he found her more joyous than ever.\n\nThere certainly was a peculiar happiness about Margaret Rivers; her\nvexations were but ripples, rendering the sunny course of her life more\nsparkling, and each exertion in the way of goodness was productive of so\nmuch present joy that the steps of her ladder seemed, indeed, to be of\ndiamonds.\n\nHer ladder--for she was, indeed, mounting upwards. She was very earnest\nin her Confirmation preparation, most anxious to do right and to contend\nwith her failings; but the struggle at present was easy; and the hopes,\njoys, and incentives shone out more and more upon her in this blithe\nstage of her life.\n\nShe knew there was a dark side, but hope and love were more present to\nher than was fear. Happy those to whom such young days are granted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\n\n     It is the generous spirit, who, when brought\n     Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought\n     Upon the plan that pleased his childish thought,\n     Whose high endeavours are an inward light,\n     Making the path before him always bright.\n                                          WORDSWORTH.\n\n\nThe holidays had commenced about a week when Harry, now duly appointed\nto H. M. S. Alcestis, was to come home on leave, as he proudly expressed\nit.\n\nA glad troop of brothers and sisters, with the doctor himself, walked up\nto the station to meet him, and who was happiest when, from the window,\nwas thrust out the rosy face, with the gold band? Mary gave such a\nshriek and leap, that two passengers and one guard turned round to look\nat her, to the extreme discomfiture of Flora and Norman, evidenced by\none by a grave “Mary! Mary!” by the other, by walking off to the extreme\nend of the platform, and trying to look as if he did not belong to them,\nin which he was imitated by his shadow, Tom.\n\nSailor already, rather than schoolboy, Harry cared not for spectators;\nhis bound from the carriage, and the hug between him, and Mary would\nhave been worthy of the return from the voyage. The next greeting was\nfor his father, and the sisters had had their share by the time the two\nbrothers thought fit to return from their calm walk on the platform.\n\nGrand was it to see that party return to the town--the naval cadet,\nwith his arm linked in Mary’s, and Aubrey clinging to his hand, and the\nothers walking behind, admiring him as he turned his bright face every\nmoment with some glad question or answer, “How was Margaret?” Oh, so\nmuch better; she had been able to walk across the room, with Norman’s\narm round her--they hoped she would soon use crutches--and she sat up\nmore. “And the baby?” More charming than ever--four teeth--would soon\nwalk--such a darling! Then came “my dirk, the ship, our berth.” “Papa,\ndo ask Mr. Ernescliffe to come here. I know he could get leave.”\n\n“Mr. Ernescliffe! You used to call him Alan!” said Mary.\n\n“Yes, but that is all over now. You forget what we do on board. Captain\nGordon himself calls me Mr. May!”\n\nSome laughed, others were extremely impressed.\n\n“Ha! There’s Ned Anderson coming,” cried Mary. “Now! Let him see you,\nHarry.”\n\n“What matters Ned Anderson to me?” said Harry; and, with an odd\nmixture of shamefacedness and cordiality, he marched full up to his old\nschool-fellow, and shook hands with him, as if able, in the plenitude of\nhis officership, to afford plenty of good-humoured superiority. Tom had\nmeantime subsided out of all view. But poor Harry’s exultation had a\nfall.\n\n“Well!” graciously inquired ‘Mr. May’, “and how is Harvey?”\n\n“Oh, very well. We are expecting him home to-morrow.”\n\n“Where has he been?”\n\n“To Oxford, about the Randall.”\n\nHarry gave a disturbed, wondering look round, on seeing Edward’s air of\nmalignant satisfaction. He saw nothing that reassured him, except the\nquietness of Norman’s own face, but even that altered as their eyes met.\nBefore another word could be said, however, the doctor’s hand was on\nHarry’s shoulder.\n\n“You must not keep him now, Ned,” said he--“his sister has not seen him\nyet.”\n\nAnd he moved his little procession onwards, still resting on Harry’s\nshoulder, while a silence had fallen on all, and even the young sailor\nventured no question. Only Tom’s lips were quivering, and Ethel had\nsqueezed Norman’s hand. “Poor Harry!” he muttered, “this is worst of\nall! I wish we had written it to him.”\n\n“So do I now, but we always trusted it would come right. Oh! if I were\nbut a boy to flog that Edward!”\n\n“Hush, Ethel, remember what we resolved.”\n\nThey were entering their own garden, where, beneath the shade of the\ntulip-tree, Margaret lay on her couch. Her arms were held out, and Harry\nthrew himself upon her, but when he rose from her caress, Norman and Tom\nwere gone.\n\n“What is this?” he now first ventured to ask.\n\n“Come with me,” said Dr. May, leading the way to his study, where he\nrelated the whole history of the suspicion that Norman had incurred.\nHe was glad that he had done so in private, for Harry’s indignation and\ngrief went beyond his expectations; and when at last it appeared that\nHarvey Anderson was actually Randall-scholar, after opening his\neyes with the utmost incredulity, and causing it to be a second time\nrepeated, he gave a gulp or two, turned very red, and ended by laying\nhis head on the table, and fairly sobbing and crying aloud, in spite of\ndirk, uniform, and manhood.\n\n“Harry! why, Harry, my boy! We should have prepared you for this,” said\nthe doctor affectionately. “We have left off breaking our hearts about\nit. I don’t want any comfort now for having gold instead of glitter;\nthough at first I was as bad as you.”\n\n“Oh, if I had but been there!” said Harry, combating unsuccessfully with\nhis tears.\n\n“Ah! so we all said, Norman and all. Your word would have cleared\nhim--that is, if you had not been in the thick of the mischief. Ha!\nJuly, should not you have been on the top of the wall?”\n\n“I would have stood by him, at least. Would not I have given Axworthy\nand Anderson two such black eyes as they could not have shown in school\nfor a week? They had better look out!” cried Harry savagely.\n\n“What! An officer in her Majesty’s service! Eh, Mr. May?”\n\n“Don’t, papa, don’t. Oh! I thought it would have been so happy, when I\ncame home, to see Norman Randall-scholar. Oh! now I don’t care for the\nship, nor anything.” Again Harry’s face went down on the table.\n\n“Come, come, Harry,” said Dr. May, pulling off the spectacles that had\nbecome very dewy, “don’t let us make fools of ourselves, or they will\nthink we are dying for the scholarship.”\n\n“I don’t care for the scholarship, but to have June turned down--and\ndisgrace--”\n\n“What I care for, Harry, is having June what he is, and that I know\nbetter now.”\n\n“He is! he is--he is June himself, and no mistake!” cried Harry, with\nvehemence.\n\n“The prime of the year, is not it?” said the doctor, smiling, as he\nstroked down the blue sleeve, as if he thought that generous July did\nnot fall far short of it.\n\n“That he is!” exclaimed Harry. “I have never met one fellow like him.”\n\n“It will be a chance if you ever do,” said Dr. May. “That is better than\nscholarships!”\n\n“It should have been both,” said Harry.\n\n“Norman thinks the disappointment has been very good for him,” said the\ndoctor.\n\n“Perhaps it made him what he is now. All success is no discipline, you\nknow.”\n\nHarry looked as if he did not know.\n\n“Perhaps you will understand better by-and-by, but this I can tell you,\nHarry, that the patient bearing of his vexation has done more to renew\nNorman’s spirits than all his prosperity. See if if has not. I believe\nit is harder to every one of us, than to him. To Ethel, especially, it\nis a struggle to be in charity with the Andersons.”\n\n“In charity!” repeated Harry. “Papa! you don’t want us to like a horrid,\nsneaking, mean-spirited pair like those, that have used Norman in that\nshameful way?”\n\n“No, certainly not; I only want you to feel no more personal anger\nthan if it had been Cheviot, or some indifferent person, that had been\ninjured.”\n\n“I should have hated them all the same!” cried Harry.\n\n“If it is all the same, and it is the treachery you hate, I ask no\nmore,” said the doctor.\n\n“I can’t help it, papa, I can’t! If I were to meet those fellows, do\nyou think I could shake hands with them? If I did not lick Ned all down\nMinster Street, he might think himself lucky.”\n\n“Well, Harry, I won’t argue any more. I have no right to preach\nforbearance. Your brother’s example is better worth than my precept.\nShall we go back to Margaret, or have you anything to say to me?”\n\nHarry made no positive answer, but pressed close to his father, who\nput his arm round him, while the curly head was laid on his shoulder.\nPresently he said, with a great sigh, “There’s nothing like home.”\n\n“Was that what you wanted to say?” asked Dr. May, smiling, as he held\nthe boy more closely to him.\n\n“No; but it will be a long time before I come back. They think we shall\nhave orders for the Pacific.”\n\n“You will come home our real lion,” said the doctor. “How much you will\nhave to tell!”\n\n“Yes,” said Harry; “but oh! it is very different from coming home every\nnight, not having any one to tell a thing to.”\n\n“Do you want to say anything now?”\n\n“I don’t know. I told you in my letter about the half-sovereign.”\n\n“Ay, never mind that.”\n\n“And there was one night, I am afraid, I did not stand by a little\nfellow that they bullied about his prayers. Perhaps he would have gone\non, if I had helped him!”\n\n“Does he sail with you?”\n\n“No, he was at school. If I had told him that he and I would stand by\neach other--but he looked so foolish, and began to cry! I am sorry now.”\n\n“Weak spirits have much to bear,” said the doctor, “and you stronger\nones, who don’t mind being bullied, are meant, I suppose, to help them,\nas Norman has been doing by poor little Tommy.”\n\n“It was thinking of Norman--that made me sorry. I knew there was\nsomething else, but you see I forget when I don’t see you and Margaret\nevery day.”\n\n“You have One always near, my boy.”\n\n“I know, but I cannot always recollect. And there is such a row at night\non board, I cannot think or attend as I ought,” murmured Harry.\n\n“Yes, your life, sleeping at home in quiet, has not prepared you for\nthat trial,” said the doctor. “But others have kept upright habits under\nthe same, you know--and God helps those who are doing their best.”\n\nHarry sighed.\n\n“I mean to do my best,” he added; “and if it was not for feeling bad,\nI should like it. I do like it”--and his eye sparkled, and his smile\nbeamed, though the tear was undried.\n\n“I know you do!” said Dr. May, smiling, “and for feeling bad, my Harry,\nI fear you must do that by sea, or land, as long as you are in this\nworld. God be thanked that you grieve over the feeling. But He is ready\nto aid, and knows the trial, and you will be brought nearer to Him\nbefore you leave us.”\n\n“Margaret wrote about the Confirmation. Am I old enough?”\n\n“If you wish it, Harry, under these circumstances.”\n\n“I suppose I do,” said Harry, uneasily twirling a button.\n\n“But then, if I’ve got to forgive the Andersons--”\n\n“We won’t talk any more of that,” said the doctor; “here is poor Mary,\nreconnoitring, to know why I am keeping you from her.”\n\nThen began the scampering up and down the house, round and round the\ngarden, visiting every pet or haunt or contrivance; Mary and Harry at\nthe head, Blanche and Tom in full career after them, and Aubrey stumping\nand scrambling at his utmost speed, far behind.\n\nNot a word passed between Norman and Harry on the school misadventure,\nbut, after the outbreak of the latter, he treated it as a thing\nforgotten, and brought all his high spirits to enliven the family party.\nRichard, too, returned later on the same day, and though not received\nwith the same uproarious joy as Harry, the elder section of the family\nwere as happy in their way as what Blanche called the middle-aged. The\nDaisy was brought down, and the eleven were again all in the same room,\nthough there were suppressed sighs from some, who reflected how long it\nmight be before they could again assemble.\n\nTea went off happily in the garden, with much laughing and talking.\n“Pity to leave such good company!” said the doctor, unwillingly rising\nat last--“but I must go to the Union--I promised Ward to meet him\nthere.”\n\n“Oh, let me walk with you!” cried Harry.\n\n“And me!” cried other voices, and the doctor proposed that they should\nwait for him in the meads, and extend the walk after the visit. Richard\nand Ethel both expressing their intention of adhering to Margaret--the\nlatter observing how nice it would be to get rid of everybody, and have\na talk.\n\n“What have we been doing all this time?” said Dr. May, laughing.\n\n“Chattering, not conversing,” said Ethel saucily.\n\n“Ay! the Cocksmoor board is going to sit,” said Dr. May.\n\n“What is a board?” inquired Blanche, who had just come down prepared for\nher walk.\n\n“Richard, Margaret, and Ethel, when they sit upon Cocksmoor,” said Dr.\nMay.\n\n“But Margaret never does sit on Cocksmoor, papa.”\n\n“Only allegorically, Blanche,” said Norman.\n\n“But I don’t understand what is a board?” pursued Blanche.\n\n“Mr. May in his ship,” was Norman’s suggestion.\n\nPoor Blanche stood in perplexity. “What is it really?”\n\n“Something wooden headed,” continued the provoking papa.\n\n“A board is all wooden, not only its head,” said Blanche.\n\n“Exactly so, especially at Stoneborough!” said the doctor.\n\n“It is what papa is when he comes out of the council-room,” added Ethel.\n\n“Or what every one is while the girls are rigging themselves,” sighed\nHarry. “Ha! here’s Polly--now we only want Flora.”\n\n“And my stethoscope! Has any one seen my stethoscope!” exclaimed the\ndoctor, beginning to rush frantically into the study, dining-room,\nand his own room; but failing, quietly took up a book, and gave up the\nsearch, which was vigorously pursued by Richard, Flora, and Mary, until\nthe missing article was detected, where Aubrey had left it in the nook\non the stairs, after using it for a trumpet and a telescope.\n\n“Ah! now my goods will have a chance!” said Dr. May, as he took it, and\npatted Richard’s shoulder. “I have my best right hand, and Margaret will\nbe saved endless sufferings.”\n\n“Papa!”\n\n“Ay! poor dear! don’t I see what she undergoes, when nobody will\nremember that useful proverb, ‘A place for everything, and everything in\nits place.’ I believe one use of her brains is to make an inventory of\nall the things left about the drawing-room; but, beyond it, it is past\nher power.”\n\n“Yes,” said Flora, rather aggrieved; “I do the best I can, but, when\nnobody ever puts anything into its place, what can I do, single-handed?\nSo no one ever goes anywhere without first turning the house upside down\nfor their property; and Aubrey, and now even baby, are always carrying\nwhatever they can lay hands on into the nursery. I can’t bear it; and\nthe worst of it is that,” she added, finishing her lamentation, after\nthe others were out at the door, “papa and Ethel have neither of them\nthe least shame about it.”\n\n“No, no, Flora, that is not fair!” exclaimed Margaret--but Flora was\ngone.\n\n“I have shame,” sighed Ethel, walking across the room disconsolately, to\nput a book into a shelf.\n\n“And you don’t leave things trainants as you used,” said Margaret. “That is\nwhat I meant.”\n\n“I wish I did not,” said Ethel; “I was thinking whether I had better not\nmake myself pay a forfeit. Suppose you keep a book for me, Margaret,\nand make a mark against me at everything I leave about, and if I pay\na farthing for each, it will be so much away from Cocksmoor, so I must\ncure myself!”\n\n“And what shall become of the forfeits?” asked Richard.\n\n“Oh, they won’t be enough to be worth having, I hope,” said Margaret.\n\n“Give them to the Ladies’ Committee,” said Ethel, making a face. “Oh,\nRitchie! they are worse than ever. We are so glad that Flora is going to\njoin it, and see whether she can do any good.”\n\n“We?” said Margaret, hesitating.\n\n“Ah! I know you aren’t, but papa said she might--and you know she has so\nmuch tact and management--”\n\n“As Norman says,” observed Margaret doubtfully. “I cannot like the\nnotion of Flora going and squabbling with Mrs. Ledwich and Louisa\nAnderson!”\n\n“What do you think, Ritchie?” asked Ethel. “Is it not too bad that they\nshould have it all their own way, and spoil the whole female population?\nWhy, the last thing they did was to leave off reading the Prayer-book\nprayers morning and evening! And it is much expected that next they will\nattack all learning by heart.”\n\n“It is too bad,” said Richard, “but Flora can hardly hinder them.”\n\n“It will be one voice,” said Ethel; “but oh! if I could only say half\nwhat I have in my mind, they must see the error. Why, these, these--what\nthey call formal--these the ties--links on to the Church--on to what is\ngood--if they don’t learn them soundly--rammed down hard--you know what\nI mean--so that they can’t remember the first--remember when they did\nnot know them--they will never get to learn--know--understand when they\ncan understand!”\n\n“My dear Ethel, don’t frown so horribly, or it will spoil your\neloquence,” said Margaret.\n\n“I don’t understand either,” said Richard gravely. “Not understand when\nthey can understand? What do you mean?”\n\n“Why, Ritchie, don’t you see? If they don’t learn them--hard, firm, by\nrote when they can’t--they won’t understand when they can.”\n\n“If they don’t learn when they can’t, they won’t understand when they\ncan?” puzzled Richard, making Margaret laugh; but Ethel was too much in\nearnest for amusement.\n\n“If they don’t learn them by rote when they have strong memories. Yes,\nthat’s it!” she continued; “they will not know them well enough to\nunderstand them when they are old enough!”\n\n“Who won’t learn and understand what?” said Richard.\n\n“Oh, Ritchie, Ritchie! Why the children--the Psalms--the Gospels--the\nthings. They ought to know them, love them, grow up to them, before they\nknow the meaning, or they won’t care. Memory, association, affection,\nall those come when one is younger than comprehension!”\n\n“Younger than one’s own comprehension?”\n\n“Richard, you are grown more tiresome than ever. Are you laughing at\nme?”\n\n“Indeed, I beg your pardon--I did not mean it,” said Richard. “I am very\nsorry to be so stupid.”\n\n“My dear Ritchie, it was only my blundering--never mind.”\n\n“But what did you mean? I want to know, indeed, Ethel.”\n\n“I mean that memory and association come before comprehension, so that\none ought to know all good things--fa--with familiarity before one can\nunderstand, because understanding does not make one love. Oh! one does\nthat before, and, when the first little gleam, little bit of a sparklet\nof the meaning does come, then it is so valuable and so delightful.”\n\n“I never heard of a little bit of a sparklet before,” said Richard, “but\nI think I do see what Ethel means; and it is like what I heard and liked\nin a university sermon some Sundays ago, saying that these lessons and\nholy words were to be impressed on us here from infancy on earth, that\nwe might be always unravelling their meaning, and learn it fully at\nlast--where we hope to be.”\n\n“The very same thought!” exclaimed Margaret, delighted; “but,” after\na pause, “I am afraid the Ladies’ Committee might not enter into it in\nplain English, far less in Ethel’s language.”\n\n“Now, Margaret! You know I never meant myself. I never can get the right\nwords for what I mean.”\n\n“And you leave about your faux commencements, as M. Ballompre would call\nthem, for us to stumble over,” said Margaret.\n\n“But Flora would manage!” said Ethel. “She has power over people, and\ncan influence them. Oh, Ritchie, don’t persuade papa out of letting her\ngo.”\n\n“Does Mr. Wilmot wish it?” asked Richard.\n\n“I have not heard him say, but he was very much vexed about the\nprayers,” said Ethel.\n\n“Will he stay here for the holidays?”\n\n“No, his father has not been well, and he is gone to take his duty. He\nwalked with us to Cocksmoor before he went, and we did so wish for you.”\n\n“How have you been getting on?”\n\n“Pretty well, on the whole,” said Ethel, “but, oh, dear! oh, dear,\nRichard, the M’Carthys are gone!”\n\n“Gone, where?”\n\n“Oh, to Wales. I knew nothing of it till they were off. Una and Fergus\nwere missing, and Jane Taylor told me they were all gone. Oh, it is so\nhorrid! Una had really come to be so good and so much in earnest. She\nbehaved so well at school and church, that even Mrs. Ledwich liked\nher, and she used to read her Testament half the day, and bring her\nSunday-school lessons to ask me about! Oh! I was so fond of her, and it\nreally seemed to have done some good with her. And now it is all lost!\nOh, I wish I knew what would become of my poor child!”\n\n“The only hope is that it may not be all lost,” said Margaret.\n\n“With such a woman for a mother!” said Ethel; “and going to some\nheathenish place again! If I could only have seen her first, and begged\nher to go to church and say her prayers. If I only knew where she is\ngone! but I don’t. I did think Una would have come to wish me good-bye!”\n\n“I am very sorry to lose her,” said Richard.\n\n“Mr. Wilmot says it is bread cast on the waters,” said Margaret--“he was\nvery kind in consoling Ethel, who came home quite in despair.”\n\n“Yes, he said it was one of the trials,” said Ethel, “and that it might\nbe better for Una as well as for me. And I am trying to care for the\nrest still, but I cannot yet as I did for her. There are none of the\neyes that look as if they were eating up one’s words before they come,\nand that smile of comprehension! Oh, they all are such stupid little\ndolts, and so indifferent!”\n\n“Why, Ethel!”\n\n“Fancy last Friday--Mary and I found only eight there--”\n\n“Do you remember what a broiling day Friday was?” interrupted Margaret.\n“Miss Winter and Norman both told me I ought not to let them go, and I\nbegan to think so when they came home. Mary was the colour of a peony!”\n\n“Oh! it would not have signified if the children had been good for\nanything, but all their mothers were out at work, and, of those that\ndid come, hardly one had learned their lessons--Willy Blake had lost his\nspelling-card; Anne Harris kicked Susan Pope, and would not say she was\nsorry; Mary Hale would not know M from N, do all our Mary would; and\nJane Taylor, after all the pains I have taken with her, when I asked how\nthe Israelites crossed the Red Sea, seemed never to have heard of them.”\n\nMargaret could have said that Ethel had come in positively crying with\nvexation, but with no diminution of the spirit of perseverance.\n\n“I am so glad you are come, Richard!” she continued. “You will put a\nlittle new life into them. They all looked so pleased when we told them\nMr. Richard was coming.”\n\n“I hope we shall get on,” said Richard.\n\n“I want you to judge whether the Popes are civilised enough to\nbe dressed for Sunday-school. Oh, and the money! Here is the\naccount-book--”\n\n“How neatly you have kept it, Ethel.”\n\n“Ah! it was for you, you know. Receipts--see, aren’t you surprised?”\n\n“Four pounds eighteen and eightpence! That is a great deal!”\n\n“The three guineas were Mr. Rivers’s fees, you know; then, Margaret\ngave us half-a-sovereign, and Mary a shilling, and there was one that\nwe picked up, tumbling about the house, and papa said we might have, and\nthe twopence were little Blanche’s savings. Oh, Ritchie!” as a bright\ncoin appeared on the book.\n\n“That is all I could save this term,” he said.\n\n“Oh, it is famous! Now, I do think I may put another whole sovereign\naway into the purse for the church. See, here is what we have paid.\nShoes--those did bring our money very low, and then I bought a piece of\nprint which cost sixteen shillings, but it will make plenty of frocks.\nSo, you see, the balance is actually two pounds nine! That is something.\nThe nine shillings will go on till we get another fee; for I have two\nfrocks ready made for the Popes, so the two pounds are a real nest-egg\ntowards the church.”\n\n“The church!” repeated Rlchard, half smiling.\n\n“I looked in the paper the other day, and saw that a chapel had been\nbuilt for nine hundred pounds,” said Ethel.\n\n“And you have two!”\n\n“Two in eight months, Ritchie, and more will come as we get older. I\nhave a scheme in my head, but I won’t tell you now.”\n\n“Nine hundred! And a church has to be endowed as well as built, you\nknow, Ethel.”\n\n“Oh! never mind that now. If we can begin and build, some good person\nwill come and help. I’ll run and fetch it, Ritchie. I drew out a sketch\nof what I want it to be.”\n\n“What a girl that is!” said Richard, as Ethel dashed away.\n\n“Is not she?” said Margaret. “And she means all so heartily. Do you know\nshe has spent nothing on her own pleasures, not a book, not a thing has\nshe bought this year, except a present for Blanche’s birthday, and some\nsilk to net a purse for Harry.”\n\n“I cannot help being sometimes persuaded that she will succeed,” said\nRichard.\n\n“Faith, energy, self-denial, perseverance, they go a great way,” said\nMargaret. “And yet when we look at poor dear Ethel, and her queer\nungainly ways, and think of her building a church!”\n\nNeither Richard nor Margaret could help laughing, but they checked it at\nonce, and the former said, “That brave spirit is a reproof to us all.”\n\n“Yes,” said Margaret; “and so is the resolution to mend her little\nfaults.”\n\nEthel came back, having, of course, mislaid her sketch, and, much vexed,\nwished to know if it ought to cause her first forfeit, but Margaret\nthought these should not begin till the date of the agreement, and the\nthree resumed the Cocksmoor discussion.\n\nIt lasted till the return of the walking party, so late, that they had\nbeen star-gazing, and came in, in full dispute as to which was Cygnus\nand which Aquila, while Blanche was talking very grandly of Taurus\nPoniatouski, and Harry begging to be told which constellations he should\nstill see in the southern hemisphere. Dr. May was the first to rectify\nthe globe for the southern latitudes, and fingers were affectionately\nlaid on Orion’s studded belt, as though he were a friend who would\naccompany the sailor-boy. Voices grew loud and eager in enumerating the\nstars common to both; and so came bedtime, and the globe stood on the\ntable in danger of being forgotten. Ethel diligently lifted it up; and\nwhile Norman exclaimed at her tidiness, Margaret told how a new leaf was\nto be turned, and of her voluntary forfeits.\n\n“A very good plan,” cried the doctor. “We can’t do better than follow\nher example.”\n\n“What you, papa? Oh, what fun!” exclaimed Harry.\n\n“So you think I shall be ruined, Mr. Monkey. How do you know I shall\nnot be the most orderly of all? A penny for everything left about,\nconfiscated for the benefit of Cocksmoor, eh?”\n\n“And twopence for pocket-handkerchiefs, if you please,” said Norman,\nwith a gesture of disgust.\n\n“Very well. From Blanche, upwards. Margaret shall have a book, and set\ndown marks against us--hold an audit every Saturday night. What say you,\nBlanche?”\n\n“Oh, I hope Flora will leave something about!” cried Blanche, dancing\nwith glee.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\n\n     Oh, no, we never mention her,\n     We never breathe her name.--SONG.\n\n\nA great deal of merriment had come home with Harry, who never was grave\nfor ten minutes without a strong reaction, and distracted the house with\nhis noise and his antics, in proportion, as it sometimes seemed, to the\nspaces of serious thought and reading spent in the study, where Dr.\nMay did his best to supply Mr. Ramsden’s insufficient attention to his\nConfirmation candidates, by giving an hour every day to Norman, Ethel,\nand Harry. He could not lecture, but he read with them, and his own\nearnestness was very impressive.\n\nThe two eldest felt deeply, but Harry often kept it in doubt, whether he\nwere not as yet too young and wild for permanent impressions, so rapid\nwere his transitions, and so overpowering his high spirits. Not that\nthese were objected to; but there was a feeling that there might as well\nbe moderation in all things, and that it would have been satisfactory\nif, under present circumstances, he had been somewhat more subdued and\ndiligent.\n\n“There are your decimals not done yet, Harry.”\n\nFor Harry, being somewhat deficient in arithmetic, had been recommended\nto work in that line during his visit at home--an operation usually\ndeferred, as at present, to the evening.\n\n“I am going to do my sums now, Flora,” said Harry, somewhat annoyed.\n\nHe really fetched his arithmetic, and his voice was soon heard asking\nhow he was ever to put an end to a sum that would turn to nothing but\neverlasting threes.\n\n“What have you been doing, young ladies?” asked Dr. May. “Did you call\non Miss Walkingham?”\n\n“Flora and Blanche did,” said Ethel; “I thought you did not want me to\ngo, and I had not time. Besides, a London grand young lady--oh!” and\nEthel shook her head in disgust.\n\n“That is not the way you treat Meta Rivers.”\n\n“Oh, Meta is different! She has never been out!”\n\n“I should have been glad for you to have seen Miss Walkingham,” said\nher father. “Pretty manners are improving; besides, old Lady Walkingham\nbegged me to send my daughters.”\n\n“I should not have seen her,” said Ethel, “for she was not well enough\nto let us in.”\n\n“Was it not pushing?” said Flora. “There were the Andersons leaving\ntheir card!”\n\n“Those Andersons!” exclaimed the doctor; “I am sick of the very sound of\nthe name. As sure as my name is Dick May, I’ll include it in Margaret’s\nbook of fines.”\n\nFlora looked dignified.\n\n“They are always harping on that little trumpery girl’s nonsense,” said\nHarry. “Aught, aught, eight, that is eight thousandths, eh, Norman! If\nit was about those two fellows, the boys--”\n\n“You would harp only on what affects you?” said the doctor.\n\n“No, I don’t; men never do. That is one hundred and twenty-fifth.”\n\n“One man does it to an hundred and twenty-five women?” said Dr. May.\n\n“It is rather a female defect, indeed,” said Margaret.\n\n“Defect!” said Flora.\n\n“Yes,” said Dr. May, “since it is not only irksome to the hearers, but\nleads to the breaking of the ninth commandment.”\n\nMany voices declared, in forms of varying severity, that it was\nimpossible to speak worse of the Andersons than they deserved.\n\n“Andersons again!” cried Dr. May. “One, two, three, four, five, six\nforfeits!”\n\n“Papa himself, for he said the name,” saucily put in Blanche.\n\n“I think I should like the rule to be made in earnest,” said Ethel.\n\n“What! in order to catch Flora’s pence for Cocksmoor?” suggested Harry.\n\n“No, but because it is malice. I mean, that is, if there is dislike,\nor a grudge in our hearts at them--talking for ever of nasty little\nmiserable irritations makes it worse.”\n\n“Then why do you do it?” asked Flora. “I heard you only on Sunday\ndeclaiming about Fanny Anderson.”\n\n“Ha!” cried out all at once. “There goes Flora.”\n\nShe looked intensely serious and innocent.\n\n“I know,” said Ethel. “It is the very reason I want the rule to be made,\njust to stop us, for I am sure we must often say more than is right.”\n\n“Especially when we come to the pass of declaring that the ninth\ncommandment cannot be broken in regard to them,” observed the doctor.\n\n“Most likely they are saying much the same of us,” said Richard.\n\n“Or worse,” rejoined Dr. May. “The injured never hates as much as the\ninjurer.”\n\n“Now papa has said the severest thing of all!” whispered Ethel.\n\n“Proving the inexpedience of personalities,” said Dr. May, “and in good\ntime enter the evening post.--Why! how now, Mr. May, are you gone mad?”\n\n“Hallo! why ho! ha! hurrah!” and up went Harry’s book of decimals to the\nceiling, coming down upon a candle, which would have been overturned on\nEthel’s work, if it had not been dexterously caught by Richard.\n\n“Harry!” indignantly cried Ethel and Flora, “see what you have done;”\n and the doctor’s voice called to order, but Harry could not heed. “Hear!\nhear! he has a fortune, an estate.”\n\n“Who? Tell us--don’t be so absurd. Who?”\n\n“Who, Mr. Ernescliffe. Here is a letter from Hector. Only listen:\n\n“‘Did you know we had an old far-away English cousin, one Mr. Halliday?\nI hardly did, though Alan was named after him, and he belonged to my\nmother. He was a cross old fellow, and took no notice of us, but within\nthe last year or two, his nephew, or son, or something, died, and now he\nis just dead, and the lawyer wrote to tell Alan he is heir-at-law. Mr.\nErnescliffe of Maplewood! Does it not sound well? It is a beautiful\ngreat place in Shropshire, and Alan and I mean to run off to see it as\nsoon as he can have any time on shore.’”\n\nEthel could not help looking at Margaret, but was ashamed of her\nimpertinence, and coloured violently, whereas her sister did not colour\nat all, and Norman, looking down, wondered whether Alan would make the\nvoyage.\n\n“Oh, of course he will; he must!” said Harry. “He would never give up\nnow.”\n\nNorman further wondered whether Hector would remain on the Stoneborough\nfoundation, and Mary hoped they should not lose him; but there was no\ngreat readiness to talk over the event, and there soon was a silence\nbroken by Flora saying, “He is no such nobody, as Louisa Anderson said,\nwhen we--”\n\nAnother shout, which caused Flora to take refuge in playing waltzes for\nthe rest of the evening. Moreover, to the extreme satisfaction of Mary,\nshe left her crochet-needle on the floor at night. While a tumultuous\nparty were pursuing her with it to claim the penny, and Richard was\nconveying Margaret upstairs, Ethel found an opportunity of asking her\nfather if he were not very glad of Mr. Ernescliffe’s good fortune.\n\n“Yes, very. He is a good fellow, and will make a good use of it.”\n\n“And now, papa, does it not make--You won’t say now you are sorry he\ncame here.”\n\nShe had no answer but a sigh, and a look that made her blush for having\nventured so far. She was so much persuaded that great events must ensue,\nthat, all the next day, she listened to every ring of the bell, and when\none at last was followed by a light, though, to her ears, manly sounding\ntread, she looked up flushing with expectation.\n\nBehold, she was disappointed. “Miss Walkingham” was announced, and she\nrose surprised, for the lady in question had only come to Stoneborough\nfor a couple of days with an infirm mother, who, having known Dr. May\nin old times, had made it her especial request that he would let her see\nhis daughters. She was to proceed on her journey to-day, and the return\nof the visit had been by no means expected.\n\nFlora went forward to receive her, wondering to see her so young\nlooking, and so unformed. She held out her hand, with a red wrist, and,\nas far as could be seen under her veil, coloured when presented to the\nrecumbent Margaret. How she got into her chair, they hardly knew, for\nFlora was at that moment extremely annoyed by hearing an ill-bred peal\nof Mary’s laughter in the garden, close to the window; but she thought\nit best to appear unconscious, since she had no power to stop it.\n\nMargaret thought the stranger embarrassed, and kindly inquired for Lady\nWalkingham.\n\n“Much the same, thank you,” mumbled a voice down in the throat.\n\nA silence, until Margaret tried another question, equally briefly\nanswered; and, after a short interval, the young lady contrived to make\nher exit, with the same amount of gaucherie as had marked her entrance.\n\nExpressions of surprise at once began, and were so loud, that when Harry\nentered the room, his inquiry was, “What’s the row?”\n\n“Miss Walkingham,” said Ethel, “but you won’t understand. She seemed\nhalf wild! Worse than me!”\n\n“How did you like the pretty improving manners?” asked Harry.\n\n“Manners! she had none,” said Flora. “She, highly connected! used to the\nbest society!”\n\n“How do you know what the best society do?” asked Harry.\n\n“The poor thing seemed very shy,” said Margaret.\n\n“I don’t know about shyness,” said Flora.\n\n“She was stifling a laugh all the time, like a rude schoolboy. And I\nthought papa said she was pretty!”\n\n“Ay? Did you think her so?” asked Harry.\n\n“A great broad red face--and so awkward!” cried Flora indignantly.\n\n“If one could have seen her face, I think she might have been\nnice-looking,” said Margaret. “She had pretty golden curls, and merry\nblue eyes, rather like Harry’s.”\n\n“Umph!” said Flora; “beauty and manners seemed to me much on a par. This\nis one of papa’s swans, indeed!”\n\n“I can’t believe it was Miss Walkingham at all,” said Ethel. “It must\nhave been some boy in disguise.”\n\n“Dear me!” cried Margaret, starting with the painful timidity of\nhelplessness.\n\n“Do look whether anything is gone. Where’s the silver inkstand?”\n\n“You don’t think she could put that into her pocket,” said Ethel,\nlaughing as she held it up.\n\n“I don’t know. Do, Harry, see if the umbrellas are safe in the hall. I\nwish you would, for now I come to remember, the Walkinghams went at nine\nthis morning. Miss Winter said that she saw the old lady helped into\nthe carriage, as she passed.” Margaret’s eyes looked quite large and\nterrified. “She must have been a spy--the whole gang will come at night.\nI wish Richard was here. Harry, it really is no laughing matter. You had\nbetter give notice to the police.”\n\nThe more Margaret was alarmed, the more Harry laughed. “Never mind,\nMargaret, I’ll take care of you! Here’s my dirk. I’ll stick all the\nrobbers.”\n\n“Harry! Harry! Oh, don’t!” cried Margaret, raising herself up in an\nagony of nervous terror. “Oh, where is papa? Will nobody ring the bell,\nand send George for the police?”\n\n“Police, police! Thieves! Murder! Robbers! Fire! All hands ahoy!”\n shouted Harry, his hands making a trumpet over his mouth.\n\n“Harry, how can you?” said Ethel, hastily; “don’t you see that Margaret\nis terribly frightened. Can’t you say at once that it was you?”\n\n“You!” and Margaret sank back, as there was a general outcry of laughter\nand wonder.\n\n“Did you know it, Ethel?” asked Flora severely.\n\n“I only guessed at this moment,” said Ethel. “How well you did it,\nHarry!”\n\n“Well!” said Flora, “I did think her dress very like Margaret’s shot\nsilk. I hope you did not do that any harm.”\n\n“But how did you manage?” said Ethel. “Where did your bonnet come from?”\n\n“It was a new one of Adams’s wife. Mary got it for me. Come in, Polly,\nthey have found it out. Did you not hear her splitting with laughing\noutside the window? I would not let her come in for fear she should\nspoil all.”\n\n“And I was just going to give her such a scolding for giggling in the\ngarden,” said Flora, “and to say we had been as bad as Miss Walkingham.\nYou should not have been so awkward, Harry; you nearly betrayed\nyourself.”\n\n“He had nobody to teach him but Mary,” said Ethel.\n\n“Ah! you should have seen me at my ease in Minster Street. No one\nsuspected me there.”\n\n“In Minster Street. Oh, Harry, you don’t really mean it!”\n\n“I do. That was what I did it for. I was resolved to know what the\nnameless ones said of the Misses May.”\n\nHasty and eager inquiries broke out from Flora and Ethel.\n\n“Oh, Dr. May was very clever, certainly, very clever. Had I seen the\ndaughters? I said I was going to call there, and they said--”\n\n“What, oh, what, Harry?”\n\n“They said Flora was thought pretty, but--and as to Ethel, now, how do\nyou think you came off, Unready?”\n\n“Tell me. They could not say the same of me, at any rate.”\n\n“Quite the reverse! They called Ethel very odd, poor girl.”\n\n“I don’t mind,” said Ethel. “They may say what they please of me;\nbesides that, I believe it is all Harry’s own invention.”\n\n“Nay, that is a libel on my invention!” exclaimed Harry. “If I had drawn\non that, could I not have told you something much droller?”\n\n“And was that really all?” said Flora.\n\n“They said--let me see--that all our noses were too long, and, that as\nto Flora’s being a beauty! when their brothers called her--so droll\nof them--but Harvey called her a stuck-up duchess. In fact, it was the\nfashion to make a great deal of those Mays.”\n\n“I hope they said something of the sailor brother,” said Ethel.\n\n“No; I found if I stayed to hear much more, I should be knocking Ned\ndown, so I thought it time to take leave before he suspected.”\n\nAll this had passed very quickly, with much laughter, and numerous\ninterjections of amusement, and reprobation, or delight. So excited were\nthe young people, that they did not perceive a step on the gravel,\ntill Dr. May entered by the window, and stood among them. His first\nexclamation was of consternation. “Margaret, my dear child, what is the\nmatter?”\n\nOnly then did her brother and sisters perceive that Margaret was lying\nback on her cushions, very pale, and panting for breath. She tried to\nsmile and say, “it was nothing,” and “she was silly,” but the words were\nfaint, from the palpitation of her heart.\n\n“It was Harry’s trick,” said Flora indignantly, as she flew for the\nscent-bottle, while her father bent over Margaret. “Harry dressed\nhimself up, and she was frightened.”\n\n“Oh, no--no--he did not mean it,” gasped Margaret; “don’t.”\n\n“Harry, I did not think you could be so cowardly and unfeeling!” and Dr.\nMay’s look was even more reproachful than his words.\n\nHarry was dismayed at his sister’s condition, but the injustice of the\nwholesale reproach chased away contrition. “I did nothing to frighten\nany one,” he said moodily.\n\n“Now, Harry, you know how you kept on,” said Flora, “and when you saw\nshe was frightened--”\n\n“I can have no more of this,” said Dr. May, seeing that the discussion\nwas injuring Margaret more and more. “Go away to my study, sir, and wait\ntill I come to you. All of you out of the room. Flora, fetch the sal\nvolatile.”\n\n“Let me tell you,” whispered Margaret. “Don’t be angry with Harry. It\nwas--”\n\n“Not now, not now, my dear. Lie quite still.” She obeyed, took the\nsal volatile, and shut her eyes, while he sat leaning anxiously over,\nwatching her. Presently she opened them, and, looking up, said rather\nfaintly, and trying to smile, “I don’t think I can be better till you\nhave heard the rights of it. He did not mean it.”\n\n“Boys never do mean it,” was the doctor’s answer. “I hoped better things\nof Harry.”\n\n“He had no intention--” began Margaret, but she still was unfit to talk,\nand her father silenced her, by promising to go and hear the boy’s own\naccount.\n\nIn the hall, he was instantly beset by Ethel and Mary, the former\nexclaiming, “Papa, you are quite mistaken! It was very foolish of\nMargaret to be so frightened. He did nothing at all to frighten any\none.”\n\nEthel’s mode of pleading was unfortunate; the “very foolish of Margaret”\n were the very words to displease.\n\n“Do not interfere!” said her father sternly. “You only encourage him in\nhis wanton mischief, and no one takes any heed how he torments my poor\nMargaret.”\n\n“Papa,” cried Harry, passionately bursting open the study door,\n“tormenting Margaret was the last thing I would do!”\n\n“That is not the way to speak, Harry. What have you been doing?”\n\nWith rapid agitated utterance, Harry made his confession. At another\ntime the doctor would have treated the matter as a joke carried too far,\nbut which, while it called for censure, was very amusing; but now\nthe explanation that the disguise had been assumed to impose on the\nAndersons, only added to his displeasure.\n\n“You seem to think you have a licence to play off any impertinent freaks\nyou please, without consideration for any one,” he said; “but I tell\nyou it is not so. As long as you are under my roof, you shall feel my\nauthority, and you shall spend the rest of the day in your room. I hope\nquietness there will bring you to a better mind, but I am disappointed\nin you. A boy who can choose such a time, and such subjects, for\ninsolent, unfeeling, practical jokes, cannot be in a fit state for\nConfirmation.”\n\n“Oh, papa! papa!” cried the two girls, in tones of entreaty--while\nHarry, with a burning face and hasty step, dashed upstairs without a\nword.\n\n“You have been as bad!” said Dr. May. “I say nothing to you, Mary, you\nknew no better; but, to see you, Ethel, first encouraging him in his\nimpertinence, and terrifying Margaret so, that I dare say she may be a\nweek getting over it, and now defending him, and calling her silly, is\nunbearable. I cannot trust one of you!”\n\n“Only listen, papa!”\n\n“I will have no altercation; I must go back to Margaret, since no one\nelse has the slightest consideration for her.”\n\nAn hour had passed away, when Richard knocked at Ethel’s door to tell\nher that tea was ready.\n\n“I have a great mind not to go down,” said Ethel, as he looked in, and\nsaw her seated with a book.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I cannot bear to go down while poor Harry is so unjustly used.”\n\n“Hush, Ethel!”\n\n“I cannot hush. Just because Margaret fancies robbers and murderers, and\nall sorts of nonsense, as she always did, is poor Harry to be accused of\nwantonly terrifying her, and shut up, and cut off from Confirmation? and\njust when he is going away, too! It is unkind, and unjust, and--”\n\n“Ethel, you will be sorry--”\n\n“Papa will be sorry,” continued Ethel, disregarding the caution. “It is\nvery unfair, that I will say so. It was all nonsense of Margaret’s,\nbut he will always make everything give way to her. And poor Harry\njust going to sea! No, Ritchie, I cannot come down; I cannot behave as\nusual.”\n\n“You will grieve Margaret much more,” said Richard.\n\n“I can’t help that--she should not have made such a fuss.”\n\nRichard was somewhat in difficulties how to answer, but at that moment\nHarry’s door, which was next, was slightly opened, and his voice said,\n“Go down, Ethel. The captain may punish any one he pleases, and it is\nmutiny in the rest of the crew to take his part.”\n\n“Harry is in the right,” said Richard. “It is our duty not to question\nour father’s judgments. It would be wrong of you to stay up.”\n\n“Wrong?” said Ethel.\n\n“Of course. It would be against the articles of war,” said Harry,\nopening his door another inch. “But, Ritchie, I say, do tell me whether\nit has hurt Margaret.”\n\n“She is better now,” said Richard, “but she has a headache, chiefly, I\nbelieve, from distress at having brought this on you. She is very sorry\nfor her fright.”\n\n“I had not the least intention of frightening the most fearsome little\ntender mouse on earth,” said Harry.\n\n“No, indeed!” said Ethel.\n\n“And at another time it would not have signified,” said Richard; “but,\nyou know, Margaret always was timid, and now, the not being able to\nmove, and the being out of health, has made her nerves weak, so that she\ncannot help it.”\n\n“The fault was in our never heeding her when we were so eager to hear\nHarry’s story,” said Ethel. “That was what made the palpitation so bad.\nBut, now papa knows all, does he not understand about Harry?”\n\n“He was obliged to go out as soon as Margaret was better,” said Richard,\n“and was scarcely come in when I came up.”\n\n“Go down, Ethel,” repeated Harry. “Never mind me. Norman told me that\nsort of joke never answered, and I might have minded him.”\n\nThe voice was very much troubled, and it brought back that burning\nsensation of indignant tears to Ethel’s eyes.\n\n“Oh, Harry! you did not deserve to be so punished for it.”\n\n“That is what you are not to say,” returned Harry. “I ought not to have\nplayed the trick, and--and just now too--but I always forget things--”\n\nThe door shut, and they fancied they heard sobs. Ethel groaned, but made\nno opposition to following her brother down to tea. Margaret lay, wan\nand exhausted, on the sofa--the doctor looked very melancholy and rather\nstern, and the others were silent. Ethel had begun to hope for the\nwarm reaction she had so often known after a hasty fit, but it did\nnot readily come; Harry was boy instead of girl--the fault and its\nconsequence had been more serious--and the anxiety for the future\nwas greater. Besides, he had not fully heard the story; Harry, in his\nincoherent narration, had not excused himself, and Margaret’s panic had\nappeared more as if inspired by him, than, as it was, in fact, the work\nof her fancy.\n\nThus the evening passed gloomily away, and it was not till the others\nhad said good-night that Dr. May began to talk over the affair with his\neldest son, who then was able to lay before him the facts of the case,\nas gathered from his sisters. He listened with a manner as though it\nwere a reproof, and then said sadly, “I am afraid I was in a passion.”\n\n“It was very wrong in Harry,” said Richard, “and particularly unlucky it\nshould happen with the Andersons.”\n\n“Very thoughtless,” said the doctor, “no more, even as regarded\nMargaret; but thoughtlessness should not have been treated as a crime.”\n\n“I wish we could see him otherwise,” said Richard.\n\n“He wants--” and there Dr. May stopped short, and, taking up his candle,\nslowly mounted the stairs, and looked into Harry’s room. The boy was in\nbed, but started up on hearing his father’s step, and exclaimed, “Papa,\nI am very sorry! Is Margaret better?”\n\n“Yes, she is; and I understand now, Harry, that her alarm was an\naccident. I beg your pardon for thinking for a moment that it was\notherwise--”\n\n“No,” interrupted Harry, “of course I could never mean to frighten her;\nbut I did not leave off the moment I saw she was afraid, because it was\nso very ridiculous, and I did not guess it would hurt her.”\n\n“I see, my honest boy. I do not blame you, for you did not know how\nmuch harm a little terror does to a person in her helpless state. But,\nindeed, Harry, though you did not deserve such anger as mine was, it is\na serious thing that you should be so much set on fun and frolic as to\nforget all considerations, especially at such a time as this. It takes\naway from much of my comfort in sending you into the world; and for\nhigher things--how can I believe you really impressed and reverent, if\nthe next minute--”\n\n“I’m not fit! I’m not fit!” sobbed Harry, hiding his face.\n\n“Indeed, I hardly know whether it is not so,” said the doctor. “You are\nunder the usual age, and, though I know you wish to be a good boy, yet\nI don’t feel sure that these wild spirits do not carry away everything\nserious, and whether it is right to bring one so thoughtless to--”\n\n“No, no,” and Harry cried bitterly, and his father was deeply grieved;\nbut no more could then be said, and they parted for the night--Dr. May\nsaying, as he went away, “You understand, that it is not as punishment\nfor your trick, if I do not take you to Mr. Ramsden for a ticket, but\nthat I cannot be certain whether it is right to bring you to such solemn\nprivileges while you do not seem to me to retain steadily any grave or\ndeep feelings. Perhaps your mother would have better helped you.”\n\nAnd Dr. May went away to mourn over what he viewed as far greater sins\nthan those of his son.\n\nAnger had, indeed, given place to sorrow, and all were grave the next\nmorning, as if each had something to be forgiven.\n\nMargaret, especially, felt guilty of the fears which, perhaps, had not\nbeen sufficiently combated in her days of health, and now were beyond\ncontrol, and had occasioned so much pain. Ethel grieved over the words\nshe had yesterday spoken in haste of her father and sister; Mary knew\nherself to have been an accomplice in the joke; and Norman blamed\nhimself for not having taken the trouble to perceive that Harry had not\nbeen talking rhodomontade, when he had communicated “his capital scheme”\n the previous morning.\n\nThe decision as to the Confirmation was a great grief to all. Flora\nconsoled herself by observing that, as he was so young, no one need know\nit, nor miss him; and Ethel, with a trembling, almost sobbing voice,\nenumerated all Harry’s excellences, his perfect truth, his kindness, his\ngenerosity, his flashes of intense feeling--declared that nobody might\nbe confirmed if he were not, and begged and entreated that Mr. Wilmot\nmight be written to, and consulted. She would almost have done so\nherself, if Richard had not shown her it would be undutiful.\n\nHarry himself was really subdued. He made no question as to the\npropriety of the decision, but rather felt his own unworthiness, and was\ncompletely humbled and downcast. When a note came from Mrs. Anderson,\nsaying that she was convinced that it could not have been Dr. May’s wish\nthat she should be exposed to the indignity of a practical joke, and\nthat a young lady of the highest family should have been insulted, no\none had spirits to laugh at the terms; and when Dr. May said, “What is\nto be done?” Harry turned crimson, and was evidently trying to utter\nsomething.\n\n“I see nothing for it but for him to ask their pardon,” said Dr. May;\nand a sound was heard, not very articulate, but expressing full assent.\n\n“That is right,” said the doctor. “I’ll come with you.”\n\n“Oh, thank you!” cried Harry, looking up.\n\nThey set off at once. Mrs. Anderson was neither an unpleasing nor\nunkind person--her chief defect being a blind admiration of her sons\nand daughters, which gave her, in speaking of them, a tone of pretension\nthat she would never have shown on her own account.\n\nHer displeasure was pacified in a moment by the sight of the confused\ncontrition of the culprit, coupled with his father’s frank and kindly\ntone of avowal, that it had been a foolish improper frolic, and that he\nhad been much displeased with him for it.\n\n“Say no more--pray, say no more, Dr. May. We all know how to overlook a\nsailor’s frolic, and, I am sure, Master Harry’s present behaviour; but\nyou’ll take a bit of luncheon,” and, as something was said of going home\nto the early dinner, “I am sure you will wait one minute. Master Harry\nmust have a piece of my cake, and allow me to drink to his success.”\n\nPoor Mr. May! to be called Master Harry, and treated to sweet cake! But\nhe saw his father thought he ought to endure, and he even said, “Thank\nyou.”\n\nThe cake stuck in his throat, however, when Mrs. Anderson and her\ndaughters opened their full course of praise on their dear Harvey and\ndearest Edward, telling all the flattering things Dr. Hoxton had said of\nthe order into which Harvey had brought the school, and insisting on Dr.\nMay’s reading the copy of the testimonial that he had carried to Oxford.\n“I knew you would be kind enough to rejoice,” said Mrs. Anderson, “and\nthat you would have no--no feeling about Mr. Norman; for, of course, at\nhis age, a little matter is nothing, and it must be better for the dear\nboy himself to be a little while under a friend like Harvey, than to\nhave authority while so young.”\n\n“I believe it has done him no harm,” was all that the doctor could\nbring himself to say; and thinking that he and his son had endured quite\nenough, he took his leave as soon as Harry had convulsively bolted the\nlast mouthful.\n\nNot a word was spoken all the way home. Harry’s own trouble had\noverpowered even this subject of resentment. On Sunday, the notice\nof the Confirmation was read. It was to take place on the following\nThursday, and all those who had already given in their names were to\ncome to Mr. Ramsden to apply for their tickets. While this was read,\nlarge tear-drops were silently falling on poor Harry’s book.\n\nEthel and Norman walked together in the twilight, in deep lamentation\nover their brother’s deprivation, which seemed especially to humble\nthem; “for,” said Norman, “I am sure no one can be more resolved on\ndoing right than July, and he has got through school better than I did.”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel; “if we don’t get into his sort of scrape, it is only\nthat we are older, not better. I am sure mine are worse, my letting\nAubrey be nearly burned--my neglects.”\n\n“Papa must be doing right,” said Norman, “but for July to be turned\nback when we are taken, makes me think of man judging only by outward\nappearance.”\n\n“A few outrageous-looking acts of giddiness that are so much grieved\nover, may not be half so bad as the hundreds of wandering thoughts that\none forgets, because no one else can see them!” said Ethel.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Mary were sitting twisted together into a sort of\nbundle, on the same footstool, by Margaret’s sofa. Harry had begged of\nher to hear him say the Catechism once more, and Mary had joined with\nhim in the repetition. There was to be only one more Sunday at home.\n“And that!” he said, and sighed.\n\nMargaret knew what he meant, for the Feast was to be spread for those\nnewly admitted to share it. She only said a caressing word of affection.\n\n“I wonder when I shall have another chance,” said Harry. “If we should\nget to Australia, or New Zealand--but then, perhaps, there would be no\nConfirmation going on, and I might be worse by that time.”\n\n“Oh, you must not let that be!”\n\n“Why, you see, if I can’t be good here, with all this going on, what\nshall I do among those fellows, away from all?”\n\n“You will have one friend!”\n\n“Mr. Ernescliffe! You are always thinking of him, Margaret; but perhaps\nhe may not go, and if he should, a lieutenant cannot do much for a\nmidshipman. No, I thought, when I was reading with my father, that\nsomehow it might help me to do what it called putting away childish\nthings--don’t you know? I might be able to be stronger and steadier,\nsomehow. And then, if--if--you know, if I did tumble overboard, or\nanything of that sort, there is that about the--what they will go to\nnext Sunday, being necessary to salvation.”\n\nHarry laid down his head and cried; Margaret could not speak for tears;\nand Mary was incoherently protesting against any notion of his falling\noverboard.\n\n“It is generally necessary, Harry,” Margaret said at last--“not in\nimpossible cases.”\n\n“Yes if it had been impossible, but it was not; if I had not been a\nmad goose all this time, but when a bit of fun gets hold of me, I can’t\nthink. And if I am too bad for that, I am too bad for--for--and I shall\nnever see mamma again! Margaret, it almost makes me af--afraid to sail.”\n\n“Harry, don’t, don’t talk so!” sobbed Mary. “Oh, do come to papa, and\nlet us beg and pray. Take hold of my hand, and Margaret will beg too,\nand when he sees how sorry you are, I am sure he will forgive, and let\nyou be confirmed.” She would have dragged him after her.\n\n“No, Mary,” said Harry, resisting her. “It is not that he does not\nforgive. You don’t understand. It is what is right. And he cannot help\nit, or make it right for me, if I am such a horrid wretch that I can’t\nkeep grave thoughts in my head. I might do it again after that, just the\nsame.”\n\n“You have been grave enough of late,” said Mary.\n\n“This was enough to make me so,” said Harry; “but even at church, since\nI came home, I have behaved ill! I kicked Tom, to make him look at old\nLevitt asleep, and then I went on, because he did not like it. I know I\nam too idle.”\n\nOn the Tuesday, Dr. May had said he would take Norman and Etheldred to\nMr. Ramsden. Ethel was gravely putting on her walking dress, when she\nheard her father’s voice calling Harry, and she started with a joyful\nhope.\n\nThere, indeed, when she came downstairs, stood Harry, his cap in his\nhand, and his face serious, but with a look on it that had as much\nsubdued joy as awe.\n\n“Dear, dear Harry! you are going with us then?”\n\n“Yes, papa wrote to ask what Mr. Wilmot thought, and he said--”\n\nHarry broke off as his father advanced, and gave her the letter itself\nto read. Mr. Wilmot answered that he certainly should not refuse such\na boy as Harry, on the proof of such entire penitence and deep feeling.\nWhether to bring him to the further privilege might be another question;\nbut, as far as the Confirmation was concerned, the opinion was decided.\n\nNorman and Ethel were too happy for words, as they went arm in arm along\nthe street, leaving their dear sailor to be leaned on by his father.\n\nHarry’s sadness was gone, but he still was guarded and gentle during the\nfew days that followed; he seemed to have learned thought, and in his\ngratitude for the privileges he had so nearly missed, to rate them more\nhighly than he might otherwise have done. Indeed, the doubt for the\nSunday gave him a sense of probation.\n\nThe Confirmation day came. Mr. Rivers had asked that his daughter\nmight be with Miss May, and Ethel had therefore to be called for in the\nAbbotstoke carriage, quite contrary to her wishes, as she had set her\nheart on the walk to church with her father and brothers. Flora would\nnot come, for fear of crowding Mr. Rivers, who, with Mrs. Larpent,\naccompanied his darling.\n\n“Oh, Margaret,” said Flora, after putting her sister into the carriage,\n“I wish we had put Ethel into a veil! There is Meta all white from head\nto foot, with such a veil! and Ethel, in her little white cap, looks as\nif she might be Lucy Taylor, only not so pretty.”\n\n“Mamma thought the best rule was to take the dress that needs least\nattention from ourselves, and will be least noticed,” said Margaret.\n\n“There is Fanny Anderson gone by in the fly with a white veil on!” cried\nMary, dashing in.\n\n“Then I am glad Ethel has not one,” said Flora. Margaret looked annoyed,\nbut she had not found the means of checking Flora without giving\noffence; and she could only call Mary and Blanche to order, beg them to\nthink of what the others were doing, and offer to read to them a little\ntale on Confirmation.\n\nFlora sat and worked, and Margaret, stealing a glance at her, understood\nthat, in her quiet way, she resented the implied reproof. “Making the\nchildren think me worldly and frivolous!” she thought; “as if Margaret\ndid not know that I think and feel as much as any reasonable person!”\n\nThe party came home in due time, and after one kiss to Margaret, given\nin silence, dispersed, for they could not yet talk of what had passed.\n\nOnly Ethel, as she met Richard on the stairs, said, “Ritchie, do you\nknow what the bishop’s text was? ‘No man having put his hand to the\nplough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.’”\n\n“Yes?” said Richard interrogatively.\n\n“I thought it might be a voice to me,” said Ethel; “besides what it says\nto all, about our Christian course. It seems to tell me not to be out\nof heart about all those vexations at Cocksmoor. Is it not a sort of\nputting our hand to the plough?”\n\nDr. May gave his own history of the Confirmation to Margaret. “It was\na beautiful thing to watch,” he said, “the faces of our own set.\nThose four were really like a poem. There was little Meta in her snowy\nwhiteness, looking like innocence itself, hardly knowing of evil, or\npain, or struggle, as that soft earnest voice made her vow to be ready\nfor it all, almost as unscathed and unconscious of trial, as when they\nmade it for her at her baptism; pretty little thing--may she long be as\nhappy. And for our own Ethel, she looked as if she was promising on and\non, straight into eternity. I heard her ‘I do,’ dear child, and it was\nin such a tone as if she meant to be ever doing.”\n\n“And for the boys?”\n\n“There was Norman grave and steadfast, as if he knew what he was about,\nand was manfully and calmly ready--he might have been a young knight,\nwatching his armour.”\n\n“And so he is,” said Margaret softly. “And poor Harry?”\n\nThe doctor could hardly command voice to tell her. “Poor Harry, he was\nlast of all, he turned his back and looked into the corner of the seat,\ntill all the voices had spoken, and then turned about in haste, and the\ntwo words came on the end of a sob.”\n\n“You will not keep him away on Sunday?” said Margaret.\n\n“Far be it from me. I know not who should come, if he should not.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n\n     What matter, whether through delight,\n       Or led through vale of tears,\n     Or seen at once, or hid from sight,\n       The glorious way appears?\n     If step by step the path we see,\n       That leads, my Saviour, up to Thee!\n\n\n“I could not help it,” said Dr. May; “that little witch--”\n\n“Meta Rivers? Oh! what, papa?”\n\n“It seems that Wednesday is her birthday, and nothing will serve her but\nto eat her dinner in the old Roman camp.”\n\n“And are we to go? Oh, which of us?”\n\n“Every one of anything like rational years. Blanche is especially\ninvited.”\n\nThere were transports till it was recollected that on Thursday morning\nschool would recommence, and that on Friday Harry must join his ship.\n\nHowever, the Roman camp had long been an object of their desires, and\nMargaret was glad that the last day should have a brilliancy, so she\nwould not hear of any one remaining to keep her company, talked of the\nprofit she should gain by a leisure day, and took ardent interest in\nevery one’s preparations and expectations, in Ethel’s researches\ninto county histories and classical dictionaries, Flora’s sketching\nintentions, Norman’s promises of campanula glomerata, and a secret\nwhispered into her ear by Mary and Harry.\n\n“Meta’s weather,” as they said, when the August sun rose fresh and\njoyous; and great was the unnecessary bustle, and happy confusion from\nsix o’clock till eleven, when Dr. May, who was going to visit patients\nsome way farther on the same road, carried off Harry and Mary, to set\nthem down at the place.\n\nThe rest were called for by Mr. Rivers’s carriage and brake. Mrs.\nCharles Wilmot and her little girl were the only additions to the party,\nand Meta, putting Blanche into the carriage to keep company with her\ncontemporary, went herself in the brake. What a brilliant little fairy\nshe was, in her pink summer robes, fluttering like a butterfly, and\nwith the same apparent felicity in basking in joy, all gaiety, glee,\nand light-heartedness in making others happy. On they went, through\nhoneysuckled lanes, catching glimpses of sunny fields of corn falling\nbefore the reaper, and happy knots of harvest folks dining beneath the\nshelter of their sheaves, with the sturdy old green umbrella sheltering\nthem from the sun.\n\nSnatches of song, peals of laughter, merry nonsense, passed from one to\nthe other; Norman, roused into blitheness, found wit, the young ladies\nfound laughter, and Richard’s eyes and mouth looked very pretty, as they\nsmiled their quiet diversion.\n\nAt last, his face drawn all into one silent laugh, he directed the eyes\nof the rest to a high green mound, rising immediately before them, where\nstood two little figures, one with a spy-glass, intently gazing the\nopposite way.\n\nAt the same time came the halt, and Norman, bounding out, sprang lightly\nand nimbly up the side of the mound, and, while the spy-glass was yet\npointed full at Wales, had hold of a pair of stout legs, and with the\nwords, “Keep a good lockout!” had tumbled Mr. May headforemost down the\ngrassy slope, with Mary rolling after.\n\nHarry’s first outcry was for his precious glass--his second was, not\nat his fall, but that they should have come from the east, when, by the\ncompass, Stoneborough was north-north-west. And then the boys took to\ntumbling over one another, while Meta frolicked joyously, with Nipen\nafter her, up and down the mounds, chased by Mary and Blanche, who were\nwild with glee.\n\nBy-and-by she joined Ethel, and Norman was summoned to help them to\ntrace out the old lines of encampment, ditch, rampart, and gates--happy\nwork on those slopes of fresh turf, embroidered with every minute\nblossom of the moor--thyme, birdsfoot, eyebright, and dwarf purple\nthistle, buzzed and hummed over by busy, black-tailed, yellow-banded\ndumbledores, the breezy wind blowing softly in their faces, and the\nexpanse of country--wooded hill, verdant pasture, amber harvest-field,\nwinding river, smoke-canopied town, and brown moor, melting grayly away\nto the mountain heads.\n\nNow in sun, now in shade, the bright young antiquaries surveyed the old\nbanks, and talked wisely of vallum and fossa, of legion and cohort, of\nAgricola and Suetonius, and discussed the delightful probability, that\nthis might have been raised in the war with Caractacus, whence, argued\nEthel, since Caractacus was certainly Arviragus, it must have been the\nvery spot where Imogen met Posthumus again. Was not yonder the very\nhigh-road to Milford Haven, and thus must not “fair Fidele’s grassy\ntomb” be in the immediate neighbourhood?\n\nThen followed the suggestion that the mound in the middle was a good\ndeal like an ancient tomb, where, as Blanche interposed with some of the\nlore lately caught from Ethel’s studies, “they used to bury their tears\nin wheelbarrows,” while Norman observed it was the more probable, as\nfair Fidele never was buried at all.\n\nThe idea of a search enchanted the young ladies. “It was the right sort\nof vehicle, evidently,” said Norman, looking at Harry, who had been\nparticularly earnest in recommending that it should be explored; and\nMeta declared that if they could but find the least trace, her\npapa would be delighted to go regularly to work, and reveal all the\ntreasures.\n\nRichard seemed a little afraid of the responsibility of treasure-trove,\nbut he was overruled by a chorus of eager voices, and dispossessed of\nthe trowel, which he had brought to dig up some down-gentians for the\ngarden. While Norman set to work as pioneer, some skipped about in wild\necstasy, and Ethel knelt down to peer into the hole.\n\nVery soon there was a discovery--an eager outcry--some pottery! Roman\nvessels--a red thing that might have been a lamp, another that might\nhave been a lachrymatory.\n\n“Well,” said Ethel, “you know, Norman, I always told you that the\nchildren’s pots and pans in the clay ditch were very like Roman\npottery.”\n\n“Posthumus’s patty pan!” said Norman, holding it up. “No doubt this was\nthe bottle filled with the old queen’s tears when Cloten was killed.”\n\n“You see it is very small,” added Harry; “she could not squeeze out\nmany.”\n\n“Come now, I do believe you are laughing at it!” said Meta, taking the\nderided vessels into her hands. “Now, they really are genuine, and very\ncurious things, are not they, Flora?”\n\nFlora and Ethel admired and speculated till there was a fresh, and still\nmore exciting discovery--a coin, actually a medal, with the head of\nan emperor upon it--not a doubt of his high nose being Roman. Meta was\ncertain that she knew one exactly like him among her father’s gems.\nEthel was resolved that he should be Claudius, and began decyphering the\ndefaced inscription THVRVS. She tried Claudius’s whole torrent of names,\nand, at last, made it into a contraction of Tiberius, which highly\nsatisfied her.\n\nThen Meta, in her turn, read D.V.X., which, as Ethel said, was all she\ncould wish--of course it was dux et imperator, and Harry muttered into\nNorman’s ear, “ducks and geese!” and then heaved a sigh, as he thought\nof the dux no longer. “V.V.,” continued Meta; “what can that mean?”\n\n“Five, five, of course,” said Flora.\n\n“No, no! I have it, Venus Victrix” said Ethel, “the ancestral Venus! Ha!\ndon’t you see? there she is on the other side, crowning Claudius.”\n\n“Then there is an E.”\n\n“Something about Aeneas,” suggested Norman gravely. But Ethel was sure\nthat could not be, because there was no diphthong; and a fresh theory\nwas just being started, when Blanche’s head was thrust in to know what\nmade them all so busy.\n\n“Why, Ethel, what are you doing with Harry’s old medal of the Duke of\nWellington?”\n\nPoor Meta and Ethel, what a downfall! Meta was sure that Norman had\nknown it the whole time, and he owned to having guessed it from Harry’s\nimportunity for the search. Harry and Mary had certainly made good\nuse of their time, and great was the mirth over the trap so cleverly\nset--the more when it was disclosed that Dr. May had been a full\nparticipator in the scheme, had suggested the addition of the pottery,\nhad helped Harry to some liquid to efface part of the inscription, and\nhad even come up with them to plant the snare in the most plausible\ncorner for researches.\n\nMeta, enchanted with the joke, flew off to try to take in her governess\nand Mrs. Wilmot, whom she found completing their leisurely promenade,\nand considering where they should spread the dinner.\n\nThe sight of those great baskets of good fare was appetising, and the\ncompany soon collected on the shady turf, where Richard made himself\nextremely useful, and the feast was spread without any worse mishap than\nNipen’s running away with half a chicken, of which he was robbed, as Tom\nreported, by a surly-looking dog that watched in the outskirts of the\ncamp, and caused Tom to return nearly as fast as the poor little white\nmarauder.\n\nMeta “very immorally,” as Norman told her, comforted Nipen with a large\nshare of her sandwiches. Harry armed himself with a stick and Mary with\na stone, and marched off to the attack, but saw no signs of the enemy,\nand had begun to believe him a figment of Tom’s imagination, when Mary\nspied him under a bush, lying at the feet of a boy, with whom he was\nsharing the spoil.\n\nHarry called out rather roughly, “Hallo! what are you doing there?”\n\nThe boy jumped up, the dog growled, Mary shrank behind her brother,\nand begged him not to be cross to the poor boy, but to come away. Harry\nrepeated his question.\n\n“Please, sir, Toby brought it to me.”\n\n“What, is Toby your dog?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Are you so hungry as to eat dog’s meat?”\n\n“I have not had nothing before to-day, sir.”\n\n“Why, where do you live? hereabouts?”\n\n“Oh, no, sir; I lived with grandmother up in Cheshire, but she is dead\nnow, and father is just come home from sea, and he wrote down I was to\nbe sent to him at Portsmouth, to go to sea with him.”\n\n“How do you live? do you beg your way?”\n\n“No, sir; father sent up a pound in a letter, only Nanny Brooks said I\nowed some to her for my victuals, and I have not much of it left, and\nbread comes dear, so when Toby brought me this bit of meat I was glad of\nit, sir, but I would not have taken it--”\n\nThe boy was desired to wait while the brother and sister, in breathless\nexcitement, rushed back with their story.\n\nMrs. Wilmot was at first inclined to fear that the naval part of it had\nbeen inspired by Harry’s uniform, but the examination of Jem Jennings\nput it beyond a doubt that he spoke nothing but the truth; and the\nchoicest delight of the feast was the establishing him and Toby behind\nthe barrow, and feeding them with such viands as they had probably never\nseen before.\n\nThe boy could not read writing, but he had his father’s letter in his\npocket, and Mary capered at the delightful coincidence, on finding that\nJem Jennings was actually a quarter-master on board the Alcestis. It\ngave a sort of property in the boy, and she almost grudged Meta the\nhaving been first to say that she would pay for the rest of his journey,\ninstead of doing it by subscription.\n\nHowever, Mary had a consolation, she would offer to take charge of Toby,\nwho, as Harry observed, would otherwise have been drowned--he could not\nbe taken on board. To be sure, he was a particularly ugly animal, rough,\ngrisly, short-legged, long-backed, and with an apology for a tail--but\nhe had a redeeming pair of eyes, and he and Jem lived on terms of such\nclose friendship, that he would have been miserable in leaving him to\nthe mercy of Nanny Brooks.\n\nSo, after their meal, Jem and Toby were bidden to wait for Dr. May’s\ncoming, and fell asleep together on the green bank, while the rest\neither sketched, or wandered, or botanised. Flora acted the grown-up\nlady with Mrs. Wilmot, and Meta found herself sitting by Ethel, asking\nher a great many questions about Margaret, and her home, and what it\ncould be like to be one of such a numerous family. Flora had always\nturned aside from personal matters, as uninteresting to her companion,\nand, in spite of Meta’s admiration, and the mutual wish to be intimate,\nconfidence did not spring up spontaneously, as it had done with the\ndoctor, and, in that single hour, with Margaret. Blunt as Ethel was, her\nheartiness of manner gave a sense of real progress in friendship. Their\nConfirmation vows seemed to make a link, and Meta’s unfeigned enthusiasm\nfor the doctor was the sure road to Ethel’s heart. She was soon telling\nhow glad Margaret was that he had been drawn into taking pleasure in\nto-day’s scheme, since, not only were his spirits tried by the approach\nof Harry’s departure, but he had, within the last few days, been made\nvery sad by reading and answering Aunt Flora’s first letter on the news\nof last October’s misfortune.\n\n“My aunt in New Zealand,” explained Ethel.\n\n“Have you an aunt in New Zealand?” cried Meta. “I never heard of her!”\n\n“Did not you? Oh! she does write such charming long letters!”\n\n“Is she Dr. May’s sister?”\n\n“No; he was an only child. She is dear mamma’s sister. I don’t remember\nher, for she went out when I was a baby, but Richard and Margaret were\nso fond of her. They say she used to play with them, and tell them\nstories, and sing Scotch songs to them. Margaret says the first sorrow\nof her life was Aunt Flora’s going away.”\n\n“Did she live with them?”\n\n“Yes; after grandpapa died, she came to live with them, but then Mr.\nArnott came about. I ought not to speak evil of him, for he is my\ngodfather, but we do wish he had not carried off Aunt Flora! That letter\nof hers showed me what a comfort it would be to papa to have her here.”\n\n“Perhaps she will come.”\n\n“No; Uncle Arnott has too much to do. It was a pretty story altogether.\nHe was an officer at Edinburgh, and fell in love with Aunt Flora, but my\ngrandfather Mackenzie thought him too poor to marry her, and it was all\nbroken off, and they tried to think no more of it. But grandpapa died,\nand she came to live here, and somehow Mr. Arnott turned up again,\nquartered at Whitford, and papa talked over my Uncle Mackenzie, and\nhelped them--and Mr. Arnott thought the best way would be to go out to\nthe colonies. They went when New Zealand was very new, and a very funny\nlife they had! Once they had their house burned in Heki’s rebellion--and\nAunt Flora saw a Maori walking about in her best Sunday bonnet; but,\nin general, everything has gone on very well, and he has a great farm,\nbesides an office under government.”\n\n“Oh, so he went out as a settler! I was in hopes it was as a\nmissionary.”\n\n“I fancy Aunt Flora has done a good deal that may be called missionary\nwork,” said Ethel, “teaching the Maori women and girls. They call her\nmother, and she has quite a doctor’s shop for them, and tries hard to\nteach them to take proper care of their poor little children when\nthey are ill; and she cuts out clothes for the whole pah, that is, the\nvillage.”\n\n“And are they Christians?”\n\n“Oh! to be sure they are now! They meet in the pah for prayers every\nmorning and evening--they used to have a hoe struck against a bit of\nmetal for a signal, and when papa heard of it, he gave them a bell, and\nthey were so delighted. Now there comes a clergyman every fourth Sunday,\nand, on the others, Uncle Arnott reads part of the service to the\nEnglish near, and the Maori teacher to his people.”\n\nMeta asked ravenously for more details, and when she had pretty well\nexhausted Ethel’s stock, she said, “How nice it must be! Ethel, did you\never read the ‘Faithful Little Girl?’”\n\n“Yes; it was one of Margaret’s old Sunday books. I often recollected it\nbefore I was allowed to begin Cocksmoor.”\n\n“I’m afraid I am very like Lucilla!” said Meta.\n\n“What? In wishing to be a boy, that you might be a missionary?” said\nEthel. “Not in being quite so cross at home?” she added, laughing.\n\n“I am not cross, because I have no opportunity,” said Meta.\n\n“No opportunity. Oh, Meta, if people wish to be cross, it is easy enough\nto find grounds for it. There is always the moon to cry for.”\n\n“Really and truly,” said Meta thoughtfully, “I never do meet with any\nreasonable trial of temper, and I am often afraid it cannot be right or\nsafe to live so entirely at ease, and without contradictions.”\n\n“Well, but,” said Ethel, “it is the state of life in which you are\nplaced.”\n\n“Yes; but are we meant never to have vexations?”\n\n“I thought you had them,” said Ethel. “Margaret told me about your maid.\nThat would have worried some people, and made them horridly cross.”\n\n“Oh, no rational person,” cried Meta. “It was so nice to think of her\nbeing with the poor mother, and I was quite interested in managing for\nmyself; besides, you know, it was just a proof how one learns to be\nselfish, that it had never occurred to me that I ought to spare her.”\n\n“And your school children--you were in some trouble about them?”\n\n“Oh, that is pleasure.”\n\n“I thought you had a class you did not like?”\n\n“I like them now--they are such steady plodding girls, so much in\nearnest, and one, that has been neglected, is so pleased and touched by\nkindness. I would not give them up for anything now--they are just fit\nfor my capacity.”\n\n“Do you mean that nothing ever goes wrong with you, or that you do not\nmind anything--which?”\n\n“Nothing goes wrong enough with me to give me a handsome excuse for\nminding it.”\n\n“Then it must be all your good temper.”\n\n“I don’t think so,” said Meta; “it is that nothing is ever disagreeable\nto me.”\n\n“Stay,” said Ethel, “if the ill-temper was in you, you would only be the\ncrosser for being indulged--at least, so books say. And I am sure myself\nthat it is not whether things are disagreeable or not, but whether one’s\nwill is with them, that signifies.”\n\n“I don’t quite understand.”\n\n“Why--I have seen the boys do for play, and done myself, what would have\nbeen a horrid hardship if one had been made to do it. I never liked any\nlessons as well as those I did without being obliged, and always, when\nthere is a thing I hate very much in itself, I can get up an interest in\nit, by resolving that I will do it well, or fast, or something--if I can\nstick my will to it, it is like a lever, and it is done. Now, I think it\nmust be the same with you, only your will is more easily set at it than\nmine.”\n\n“What makes me uncomfortable is, that I feel as if I never followed\nanything but my will.”\n\nEthel screwed up her face, as if the eyes of her mind were pursuing some\nthought almost beyond her. “If our will and our duty run the same,” she\nsaid, “that can’t be wrong. The better people are, the more they ‘love\nwhat He commands,’ you know. In heaven they have no will but His.”\n\n“Oh! but Ethel,” cried Meta, distressed, “that is putting it too high.\nWon’t you understand what I mean? We have learned so much lately about\nself-denial, and crossing one’s own inclinations, and enduring hardness.\nAnd here I live with two dear kind people, who only try to keep every\nlittle annoyance from my path. I can’t wish for a thing without getting\nit--I am waited on all day long, and I feel like one of the women that\nare at ease--one of the careless daughters.”\n\n“I think still papa would say it was your happy contented temper that\nmade you find no vexation.”\n\n“But that sort of temper is not goodness. I was born with it; I never\ndid mind anything, not even being punished, they say, unless I knew papa\nwas grieved, which always did make me unhappy enough. I laughed, and\nwent to play most saucily, whatever they did to me. If I had striven for\nthe temper, it would be worth having, but it is my nature. And Ethel,”\n she added, in a low voice, as the tears came into her eyes, “don’t you\nremember last Sunday? I felt myself so vain and petted a thing! as if I\nhad no share in the Cup of suffering, and did not deserve to call myself\na member--it seemed ungrateful.”\n\nEthel felt ashamed, as she heard of warmer feelings than her own had\nbeen, expressed in that lowered trembling voice, and she sought for the\nanswer that would only come to her mind in sense, not at first in words.\n“Discipline,” said she, “would not that show the willingness to have the\npart? Taking the right times for refusing oneself some pleasant thing.”\n\n“Would not that be only making up something for oneself?” said Meta.\n\n“No, the Church orders it. It is in the Prayer-book,” said Ethel. “I\nmean one can do little secret things--not read storybooks on those days,\nor keep some tiresome sort of work for them. It is very trumpery, but it\nkeeps the remembrance, and it is not so much as if one did not heed.”\n\n“I’ll think,” said Meta, sighing. “If only I felt myself at work, not\nto please myself, but to be of use. Ha!” she cried, springing up, “I do\nbelieve I see Dr. May coming!”\n\n“Let us run and meet him,” said Ethel.\n\nThey did so, and he called out his wishes of many happy returns of\nblithe days to the little birthday queen, then added, “You both look\ngrave, though--have they deserted you?”\n\n“No, papa, we have been having a talk,” said Ethel. “May I tell him,\nMeta? I want to know what he says.”\n\nMeta had not bargained for this, but she was very much in earnest, and\nthere was nothing formidable in Dr. May, so she assented.\n\n“Meta is longing to be at work--she thinks she is of no use,” said\nEthel; “she says she never does anything but please herself.”\n\n“Pleasing oneself is not the same as trying to please oneself,” said Dr.\nMay kindly.\n\n“And she thinks it cannot be safe or right,” added Ethel, “to live that\nhappy bright life, as if people without care or trouble could not be\nliving as Christians are meant to live. Is that it, Meta?”\n\n“Yes, I think it is,” said Meta. “I seem to be only put here to be made\nmuch of!”\n\n“What did David say, Meta?” returned Dr. May.\n\n\n              “My Shepherd is the living Lord,\n                 Nothing therefore I need;\n               In pastures fair, near pleasant streams,\n                 He setteth me to feed.”\n\n\n“Then you think,” said Meta, much touched, “that I ought to look on this\nas ‘the pastures fair,’ and be thankful. I hope I was not unthankful.”\n\n“Oh, no,” said Ethel. “It was the wish to bear hardness, and be a good\nsoldier, was it not?”\n\n“Ah! my dear,” he said, “the rugged path and dark valley will come in\nHis own fit time. Depend upon it, the good Shepherd is giving you what\nis best for you in the green meadow, and if you lay hold on His rod\nand staff in your sunny days--” He stopped short, and turned to his\ndaughter. “Ethel, they sang that psalm the first Sunday I brought your\nmamma home!”\n\nMeta was much affected, and began to put together what the father and\ndaughter had said. Perhaps the little modes of secret discipline,\nof which Ethel had spoken, might be the true means of clasping the\nstaff--perhaps she had been impatient, and wanting in humility in\ncraving for the strife, when her armour was scarce put on.\n\nDr. May spoke once again. “Don’t let any one long for external trial.\nThe offering of a free heart is the thing. To offer praise is the great\nobject of all creatures in heaven and earth. If the happier we are, the\nmore we praise, then all is well.”\n\nBut the serious discussion was suddenly broken off.\n\nOthers had seen Dr. May’s approach, and Harry and Mary rushed down\nin dismay at their story having, as they thought, been forestalled.\nHowever, they had it all to themselves, and the doctor took up the\nsubject as keenly as could have been hoped, but the poor boy being still\nfast asleep, after, probably, much fatigue, he would not then waken him\nto examine him, but came and sat down in the semicircle, formed by a\nterraced bank of soft turf, where Mrs. Larpent, Mrs. Wilmot, Richard,\nand Flora, had for some time taken up their abode. Meta brought him\nthe choice little basket of fruit which she had saved for him, and all\ndelighted in having him there, evidently enjoying the rest and sport\nvery much, as he reposed on the fragrant slope, eating grapes, and\nmaking inquiries as to the antiquities lately discovered.\n\nNorman gave an exceedingly droll account of the great Roman Emperor,\nTiberius V.V., and Meta correcting it, there was a regular gay skirmish\nof words, which entertained every one extremely--above all, Meta’s\nindignation when the charge was brought home to her of having declared\nthe “old Duke” exactly like in turns to Domitian and Tiberius--his\nfeatures quite forbidding.\n\nThis lasted till the younger ones, who had been playing and rioting till\nthey were tired, came up, and throwing themselves down on the grass,\nBlanche petitioned for something that every one could play at.\n\nMeta proposed what she called the story play. One was to be sent out of\nearshot, and the rest to agree upon a word, which was then to be guessed\nby each telling a story, and introducing the word into it, not too\nprominently. Meta volunteered to guess, and Harry whispered to Mary it\nwould be no go, but, in the meantime, the word was found, and Blanche\neagerly recalled Meta, and sat in the utmost expectation and delight.\nMeta turned first to Richard, but he coloured distressfully, and begged\nthat Flora might tell his story for him--he should only spoil the game.\nFlora, with a little tinge of graceful reluctance, obeyed. “No woman had\nbeen to the summit of Mont Blanc,” she said, “till one young girl, named\nMarie, resolved to have this glory. The guides told her it was madness,\nbut she persevered. She took the staff, and everything requisite,\nand, following a party, began the ascent. She bravely supported every\nfatigue, climbed each precipice, was undaunted by the giddy heights she\nattained, bravely crossed the fields of snow, supported the bitter cold,\nand finally, though suffering severely, arrived at the topmost peak,\nlooked forth where woman had never looked before, felt her heart swell\nat the attainment of her utmost ambition, and the name of Marie was\ninscribed as that of the woman who alone has had the glory of standing\non the summit of the Giant of the Alps.”\n\nIt was prettily enunciated, and had a pleasing effect. Meta stood\nconning the words--woman--giant--mountain--glory--and begged for another\ntale.\n\n“Mine shall not be so stupid as Flora’s,” said Harry. “We have an old\nsailor on board the Alcestis--a giant he might be for his voice--but he\nsailed once in the Glory of the West, and there they had a monkey that\nwas picked up in Africa, and one day this old fellow found his queer\nmessmate, as he called him, spying through a glass, just like the\ncaptain. The captain had a glorious collection of old coins, and the\nlike, dug up in some of the old Greek colonies, and whenever Master\nMonkey saw him overhauling them, he would get out a brass button, or\na card or two, and turn ‘em over, and chatter at them, and glory over\nthem, quite knowing,” said Harry, imitating the gesture, “and I dare say\nhe saw V.V., and Tiberius Caesar, as well as the best of them.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Harry,” said Meta. “I think we are at no loss for\nmonkeys here. But I have not the word yet. Who comes next? Ethel--”\n\n“I shall blunder, I forewarn you,” said Ethel, “but this is mine: There\nwas a young king who had an old tutor, whom he despised because he was\nso strict, so he got rid of him, and took to idle sport. One day, when\nhe was out hunting in a forest, a white hind came and ran before him,\ntill she guided him to a castle, and there he found a lady all dressed\nin white, with a beamy crown on head, and so nobly beautiful that he\nfell in love with her at once, and was only sorry to see another prince\nwho was come to her palace too. She told them her name was Gloria,\nand that she had had many suitors, but the choice did not depend on\nherself--she could only be won by him who deserved her, and for three\nyears they were to be on their probation, trying for her. So she\ndismissed them, only burning to gain her, and telling them to come back\nin three years’ time. But they had not gone far before they saw another\npalace, much finer, all glittering with gold and silver, and their Lady\nGloria came out to meet them, not in her white dress, but in one all\ngay and bright with fine colours, and her crown they now saw was of\ndiamonds. She told them they had only seen her everyday dress and house,\nthis was her best; and she showed them about the castle, and all the\npictures of her former lovers. There was Alexander, who had been nearer\nretaining her than any one, only the fever prevented it; there\nwas Pyrrhus, always seeking her, but slain by a tile; Julius\nCaesar--Tamerlane--all the rest, and she hoped that one of these two\nwould really prove worthy and gain her, by going in the same path as\nthese great people.\n\n“So our prince went home; his head full of being like Alexander and all\nthe rest of them, and he sent for his good old tutor to reckon up his\narmies, and see whom he could conquer in order to win her. But the old\ntutor told him he was under a mistake; the second lady he had seen was a\ntreacherous cousin of Gloria, who drew away her suitors by her deceits,\nand whose real name was Vana Gloria. If he wished to earn the true\nGloria, he must set to work to do his subjects good, and to be virtuous.\nAnd he did; he taught them, and he did justice to them, and he bore it\npatiently and kindly when they did not understand. But by-and-by the\nother king, who had no good tutor to help him, had got his armies\ntogether, and conquered ever so many people, and drawn off their men to\nbe soldiers; and now he attacked the good prince, and was so strong that\nhe gained the victory, though both prince and subjects fought manfully\nwith heart and hand; but the battle was lost, and the faithful prince\nwounded and made prisoner, but bearing it most patiently, till he was\ndragged behind the other’s triumphal car with all the rest, when the\nthree years were up, to be presented to Vana Gloria. And so he was\ncarried into the forest, bleeding and wounded, and his enemy drove the\ncar over his body, and stretched out his arms to Vana Gloria, and found\nher a vain, ugly wretch, who grew frightful as soon as he grasped her.\nBut the good dying prince saw the beautiful beamy face of his lady--love\nbending over him. ‘Oh!’ he said, ‘vision of my life, hast thou come to\nlighten my dying eyes? Never--never, even in my best days, did I deem\nthat I could be worthy of thee; the more I strove, the more I knew that\nGloria is for none below--for me less than all.’\n\n“And then the lady came and lifted him up, and she said, ‘Gloria is\ngiven to all who do and suffer truly in a good cause, for faithfulness\nis glory, and that is thine.’”\n\nEthel’s language had become more flowing as she grew more eager in the\ntale, and they all listened with suspended interest. Norman asked\nwhere she got the story. “Out of an old French book, the ‘Magazin des\nenfans,’” was the answer.\n\n“But why did you alter the end?” said Flora, “why kill the poor man? He\nused to be prosperous, why not?”\n\n“Because I thought,” said Ethel, “that glory could not properly belong\nto any one here, and if he was once conscious of it, it would be all\nspoiled. Well, Meta, do you guess?”\n\n“Oh! the word! I had forgotten all about it. I think I know what it must\nbe, but I should so like another story. May I not have one?” said Meta\ncoaxingly. “Mary, it is you.”\n\nMary fell back on her papa, and begged him to take hers. Papa told the\nbest stories of all, she said, and Meta looked beseeching.\n\n“My story will not be as long as Ethel’s,” said the doctor, yielding\nwith a half-reluctant smile. “My story is of a humming-bird, a little\ncreature that loved its master with all its strength, and longed to do\nsomewhat for him. It was not satisfied with its lot, because it seemed\nmerely a vain and profitless creature. The nightingale sang praise, and\nthe woods sounded with the glory of its strains; the fowl was valued\nfor its flesh, the ostrich for its plume, but what could the little\nhumming-bird do, save rejoice in the glory of the flood of sunbeams, and\ndisport itself over the flowers, and glance in the sunny light, as its\nbright breastplate flashed from rich purple to dazzling flame-colour,\nand its wings supported it, fluttering so fast that the eye could hardly\ntrace them, as it darted its slender beak into the deep-belled blossoms.\nSo the little bird grieved, and could not rest, for thinking that it was\nuseless in this world, that it sought merely its own gratification, and\ncould do nothing that could conduce to the glory of its master. But\none night a voice spoke to the little bird, ‘Why hast thou been placed\nhere,’ it said, ‘but at the will of thy master? Was it not that he might\ndelight himself in thy radiant plumage, and see thy joy in the sunshine?\nHis gifts are thy buoyant wing, thy beauteous colours, the love of all\naround, the sweetness of the honey-drop in the flowers, the shade of the\npalm leaf. Esteem them, then, as his; value thine own bliss, while it\nlasts, as the token of his care and love; and while thy heart praises\nhim for them, and thy wings quiver and dance to the tune of that praise,\nthen, indeed, thy gladness conduces to no vain-glory of thine own, in\nbeauty, or in graceful flight, but thou art a creature serving--as best\nthou canst to his glory.’”\n\n“I know the word,” half whispered Meta, not without a trembling of the\nlip. “I know why you told the story, Dr. May, but one is not as good as\nthe humming-birds.”\n\nThe elder ladies had begun to look at watches, and talk of time to go\nhome; and Jem Jemmings having been seen rearing himself up from behind\nthe barrow, the doctor proceeded to investigate his case, was perfectly\nsatisfied of the boy’s truth, and as ready as the young ones to befriend\nhim. A letter should be written at once, desiring his father to look out\nfor him on Friday, when he should go by the same train as Harry, who\nwas delighted at the notion of protecting him so far, and begged to be\nallowed to drive him home to Stoneborough in the gig.\n\nConsent was given; and Richard being added to give weight and\ndiscretion, the gig set out at once--the doctor, much to Meta’s delight,\ntook his place in the brake. Blanche, who, in the morning, had been\ninclined to despise it as something akin to a cart, now finding it a\npopular conveyance, was urgent to return in it; and Flora was made over\nto the carriage, not at all unwillingly, for, though it separated her\nfrom Meta, it made a senior of her.\n\nNorman’s fate conveyed him to the exalted seat beside the driver of the\nbrake, where he could only now and then catch the sounds of mirth from\nbelow. He had enjoyed the day exceedingly, with that sort of abandon\nmore than ordinarily delicious to grave or saddened temperaments, when\nroused or drawn out for a time. Meta’s winning grace and sweetness had\na peculiar charm for him, and, perhaps, his having been originally\nintroduced to her as ill, and in sorrow, had given her manner towards\nhim a sort of kindness which was very gratifying.\n\nAnd now he felt as if he was going back to a very dusky dusty world; the\nlast and blithest day of his holidays was past, and he must return to\nthe misapprehensions and injustice that had blighted his school career,\nbe kept beneath boys with half his ability, and without generous\nfeeling, and find all his attainments useless in restoring his\nposition. Dr. Hoxton’s dull scholarship would chill all pleasure in\nhis studies--there would be no companionship among the boys--even his\nsupporters, Ernescliffe and Larkins, were gone, and Harry would leave\nhim still under a cloud.\n\nNorman felt it more as disgrace than he had done since the first, and\nwished he had consented to quit the school when it had been offered--be\nmade a man, instead of suffering these doubly irksome provocations,\nwhich rose before him in renewed force. “And what would that little\nhumming-bird think of me if she knew me disgraced?” thought he. “But it\nis of no use to think of it. I must go through with it, and as I always\nam getting vain-glorious, I had better have no opportunity. I did not\ndeclare I renounced vain pomp and glory last week, to begin coveting\nthem now again.”\n\nSo Norman repressed the sigh as he looked at the school buildings, which\nnever could give him the pleasures of memory they afforded to others.\n\nThe brake had set out before the carriage, so that Meta had to come in\nand wait for her governess. Before the vehicle had disgorged half its\ncontents, Harry had rushed out to meet them. “Come in, come in, Norman!\nOnly hear. Margaret shall tell you herself! Hurrah!”\n\nIs Mr. Ernescliffe come? crossed Ethel’s mind, but Margaret was alone,\nflushed, and holding out her hands. “Norman! where is he? Dear Norman,\nhere is good news! Papa, Dr. Hoxton has been here, and he knows all\nabout it--and oh! Norman, he is very sorry for the injustice, and you\nare dux again!”\n\nNorman really trembled so much that he could neither speak nor stand,\nbut sat down on the window-seat, while a confusion of tongues asked\nmore.\n\nDr. Hoxton and Mr. Larkins had come to call--heard no one was at home\nbut Miss May--had, nevertheless, come in--and Margaret had heard\nthat Mr. Larkins, who had before intended to remove his son from\nStoneborough, had, in the course of the holidays, made discoveries from\nhim, which he could not feel justified in concealing from Dr. Hoxton.\n\nThe whole of the transactions with Ballhatchet, and Norman’s part in\nthem, had been explained, as well as the true history of the affray in\nRandall’s Alley--how Norman had dispersed the boys, how they had again\ncollected, and, with the full concurrence of Harvey Anderson, renewed\nthe mischief, how the Andersons had refused to bear witness in his\nfavour, and how Ballhatchet’s ill-will had kept back the evidence which\nwould have cleared him.\n\nLittle Larkins had told all, and his father had no scruple in repeating\nit, and causing the investigation to be set on foot. Nay, he deemed that\nNorman’s influence had saved his son, and came, as anxious to thank\nhim, as Dr. Hoxton, warm-hearted, though injudicious, was to repair his\ninjustice. They were much surprised and struck by finding that Dr. May\nhad been aware of the truth the whole time, and had patiently put up\nwith the injustice, and the loss of the scholarship--a loss which Dr.\nHoxton would have given anything to repair, so as to have sent up a\nscholar likely to do him so much credit; but it was now too late, and he\nhad only been able to tell Margaret how dismayed he was at finding out\nthat the boy to whom all the good order in his school was owing had been\nso ill-used. Kind Dr. May’s first feeling really seemed to be pity and\nsympathy for his old friend, the head-master, in the shock of such a\ndiscovery. Harry was vociferously telling his version of the story to\nEthel and Mary. Tom stood transfixed in attention. Meta, forgotten and\nbewildered, was standing near Norman, whose colour rapidly varied,\nand whose breath came short and quick as he listened. A quick half\ninterrogation passed Meta’s lips, heard by no one else.\n\n“It is only that it is all right,” he answered, scarcely audibly; “they\nhave found out the truth.”\n\n“What?--who?--you?” said Meta, as she heard words that implied the past\nsuspicion.\n\n“Yes,” said Norman, “I was suspected, but never at home.”\n\n“And is it over now?”\n\n“Yes, yes,” he whispered huskily, “all is right, and Harry will not\nleave me in disgrace.”\n\nMeta did not speak, but she held out her hand in hearty congratulation;\nNorman, scarce knowing what he did, grasped and wrung it so tight\nthat it was positive pain, as he turned away his head to the window to\nstruggle with those irrepressible tears. Meta’s colour flushed into her\ncheek as she found it still held, almost unconsciously, perhaps, in his\nagitation, and she heard Margaret’s words, that both gentlemen had said\nNorman had acted nobly, and that every revelation made in the course of\ntheir examination had only more fully established his admirable conduct.\n\n“Oh, Norman, Norman, I am so glad!” cried Mary’s voice in the first\npause, and, Margaret asking where he was, he suddenly turned round,\nrecollected himself, and found it was not the back of the chair that he\nhad been squeezing, blushed intensely, but made no attempt at apology,\nfor indeed he could not speak--he only leaned down over Margaret, to\nreceive her heartfelt embrace; and, as he stood up again, his father\nlaid his hand on his shoulder, “My boy, I am glad;” but the words were\nbroken, and, as if neither could bear more, Norman hastily left the\nroom, Ethel rushing after him.\n\n“Quite overcome!” said the doctor, “and no wonder. He felt it cruelly,\nthough he bore up gallantly. Well, July?”\n\n“I’ll go down to school with him to-morrow, and see him dux again! I’ll\nhave three-times-three!” shouted Harry; “hip! hip! hurrah!” and Tom and\nMary joined in chorus.\n\n“What is all this?” exclaimed Flora, opening the door, “--is every one\ngone mad?”\n\nMany were the voices that answered.\n\n“Well, I am glad, and I hope the Andersons will make an apology. But\nwhere is poor Meta? Quite forgotten?”\n\n“Meta would not wonder if she knew all,” said the doctor, turning, with\na sweet smile that had in it something, nevertheless, of apology.\n\n“Oh, I am so glad--so glad!” said Meta, her eyes full of tears, as she\ncame forward.\n\nAnd there was no helping it; the first kiss between Margaret May\nand Margaret Rivers was given in that overflowing sympathy of\ncongratulation.\n\nThe doctor gave her his arm to take her to the carriage, and, on the\nway, his quick warm words filled up the sketch of Norman’s behaviour;\nMeta’s eyes responded better than her tongue, but, to her good-bye, she\ncould not help adding, “Now I have seen true glory.”\n\nHis answer was much such a grip as her poor little fingers had already\nreceived, but though they felt hot and crushed all the way home, the\nsensation seemed to cause such throbs of joy, that she would not have\nbeen without it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\n\n     And full of hope, day followed day,\n     While that stout ship at anchor lay\n        Beside the shores of Wight.\n     The May had then made all things green,\n     And floating there, in pomp serene,\n     That ship was goodly to be seen,\n        His pride and his delight.\n\n     Yet then when called ashore, he sought\n     The tender peace of rural thought,\n        In more than happy mood.\n     To your abodes, bright daisy flowers,\n     He then would steal at leisure hours,\n     And loved you, glittering in your bowers,\n        A starry multitude.\n                                         WORDSWORTH.\n\n\nHarry’s last home morning was brightened by going to the school to see\nfull justice done to Norman, and enjoying the scene for him. It was\nindeed a painful ordeal to Norman himself, who could, at the moment,\nscarcely feel pleasure in his restoration, excepting for the sake of his\nfather, Harry, and his sisters. To find the head-master making apologies\nto him was positively painful and embarrassing, and his countenance\nwould have been fitter for a culprit receiving a lecture. It was\npleasanter when the two other masters shook hands with him, Mr. Harrison\nwith a free confession that he had done him injustice, and Mr. Wilmot\nwith a glad look of congratulation, that convinced Harry he had never\nbelieved Norman to blame.\n\nHarry himself was somewhat of a hero; the masters all spoke to him, bade\nhim good speed, and wished him a happy voyage, and all the boys were\neager to admire his uniform, and wish themselves already men and\nofficers like Mr. May. He had his long-desired three cheers for “May\nsenior!” shouted with a thorough goodwill by the united lungs of the\nWhichcote foundation, and a supplementary cheer arose for the good ship\nAlcestis, while hands were held out on every side; and the boy arrived\nat such a pitch of benevolence and good humour, as actually to volunteer\na friendly shake of the hand to Edward Anderson, whom he encountered\nskulking apart.\n\n“Never mind, Ned, we have often licked each other before now, and don’t\nlet us bear a grudge now I am going away. We are Stoneborough fellows\nboth, you know, after all.”\n\nEdward did not refuse the offered grasp, and though his words were only,\n“Good-bye, I hope you will have plenty of fun!” Harry went away with a\nlighter heart.\n\nThe rest of the day Harry adhered closely to his father, though chiefly\nin silence; Dr. May had intended much advice and exhortation for his\nwarm-hearted, wild-spirited son, but words would not come, not even when\nin the still evening twilight they walked down alone together to the\ncloister, and stood over the little stone marked M. M. After standing\nthere for some minutes, Harry knelt to collect some of the daisies in\nthe grass.\n\n“Are those to take with you?”\n\n“Margaret is going to make a cross of them for my Prayerbook.”\n\n“Ay, they will keep it in your mind--say it all to you, Harry. She\nmay be nearer to you everywhere, though you are far from us. Don’t put\nyourself from her.”\n\nThat was all Dr. May contrived to say to his son, nor could Margaret do\nmuch more than kiss him, while tears flowed one by one over her cheeks,\nas she tried to whisper that he must remember and guard himself, and\nthat he was sure of being thought of, at least, in every prayer; and\nthen she fastened into his book the cross, formed of flattened daisies,\ngummed upon a framework of paper. He begged her to place it at the\nBaptismal Service, for he said, “I like that about fighting--and I\nalways did like the church being like a ship--don’t you? I only found\nthat prayer out the day poor little Daisy was christened.”\n\nMargaret had indeed a thrill of melancholy pleasure in this task, when\nshe saw how it was regarded. Oh, that her boy might not lose these\nimpressions amid the stormy waves he was about to encounter!\n\nThat last evening of home good-nights cost Harry many a choking sob\nere he could fall asleep; but the morning of departure had more\ncheerfulness; the pleasure of patronising Jem Jennings was as consoling\nto his spirits, as was to Mary the necessity of comforting Toby.\n\nToby’s tastes were in some respects vulgar, as he preferred the stable,\nand Will Adams, to all Mary’s attentions; but he attached himself\nvehemently to Dr. May, followed him everywhere, and went into raptures\nat the slightest notice from him. The doctor said it was all homage to\nthe master of the house. Margaret held that the dog was a physiognomist.\n\nThe world was somewhat flat after the loss of Harry--that element of\nriot and fun; Aubrey was always playing at “poor Harry sailing away,”\n Mary looked staid and sober, and Norman was still graver, and more\ndevoted to books, while Ethel gave herself up more completely to the\nthickening troubles of Cocksmoor.\n\nJealousies had arisen there, and these, with some rebukes for failures\nin sending children to be taught, had led to imputations on the\ncharacter of Mrs. Green, in whose house the school was kept. Ethel\nwas at first vehement in her defence; then when stronger evidence was\nadduced of the woman’s dishonesty, she was dreadfully shocked, and\nwanted to give up all connection with her, and in both moods was equally\ndispleased with Richard for pausing, and not going all lengths with her.\n\nMr. Wilmot was appealed to, and did his best to investigate, but the\nonly result was to discover that no one interrogated had any notion of\ntruth, except John Taylor, and he knew nothing of the matter. The mass\nof falsehood, spite, violence, and dishonesty, that became evident,\nwas perfectly appalling, and not a clue was to be found to the\ntruth--scarcely a hope that minds so lost to honourable feeling were\nopen to receive good impressions. It was a great distress to Ethel--it\nhaunted her night and day--she lay awake pondering on the vain hopes\nfor her poor children, and slept to dream of the angry faces and rude\naccusations. Margaret grew quite anxious about her, and her elders were\nseriously considering the propriety of her continuing her labours at\nCocksmoor.\n\nMr. Wilmot would not be at Stoneborough after Christmas. His father’s\ndeclining health made him be required at home, and since Richard was so\noften absent, it became matter of doubt whether the Misses May ought to\nbe allowed to persevere, unassisted by older heads, in such a locality.\n\nThis doubt put Ethel into an agony. Though she had lately been declaring\nthat it made her very unhappy to go--she could not bear the sight of\nMrs. Green, and that she knew all her efforts were vain while the poor\nchildren had such homes; she now only implored to be allowed to go on;\nshe said that the badness of the people only made it more needful to\ndo their utmost for them; there were no end to the arguments that she\npoured forth upon her ever kind listener, Margaret.\n\n“Yes, dear Ethel, yes, but pray be calm; I know papa and Mr. Wilmot\nwould not put a stop to it if they could possibly help it, but if it is\nnot proper--”\n\n“Proper! that is as bad as Miss Winter!”\n\n“Ethel, you and I cannot judge of these things--you must leave them to\nour elders--”\n\n“And men always are so fanciful about ladies--”\n\n“Indeed, if you speak in that way, I shall think it is really hurting\nyou.”\n\n“I did not mean it, dear Margaret,” said Ethel, “but if you knew what I\nfeel for poor Cocksmoor, you would not wonder that I cannot bear it.”\n\n“I do not wonder, dearest; but if this trial is sent you, perhaps it is\nto train you for better things.”\n\n“Perhaps it is for my fault,” said Ethel. “Oh, oh, if it be that I am\ntoo unworthy! And it is the only hope; no one will do anything to teach\nthese poor creatures if I give it up. What shall I do, Margaret?”\n\nMargaret drew her down close to her, and whispered, “Trust them Ethel,\ndear. The decision will be whatever is the will of God. If He thinks fit\nto give you the work, it will come; if not, He will give you some other,\nand provide for them.”\n\n“If I have been too neglectful of home, too vain of persevering when no\none but Richard would!” sighed Ethel.\n\n“I cannot see that you have, dearest,” said Margaret fondly, “but your\nown heart must tell you that. And now, only try to be calm and patient.\nGetting into these fits of despair is the very thing to make people\ndecide against you.”\n\n“I will! I will! I will try to be patient,” sobbed Ethel; “I know to be\nwayward and set on it would only hurt. I might only do more harm--I’ll\ntry. But oh, my poor children!”\n\nMargaret gave a little space for the struggle with herself, then advised\nher resolutely to fix her attention on something else. It was a Saturday\nmorning, and time was more free than usual, so Margaret was able to\npersuade her to continue a half-forgotten drawing, while listening to an\ninteresting article in a review, which opened to her that there were too\nmany Cocksmoors in the world.\n\nThe dinner-hour sounded too soon, and as she was crossing the hall to\nput away her drawing materials, the front door gave the click peculiar\nto Dr. May’s left-handed way of opening it. She paused, and saw him\nenter, flushed, and with a look that certified her that something had\nhappened.\n\n“Well, Ethel, he is come.”\n\n“Oh, papa, Mr. Ernes--”\n\nHe held up his finger, drew her into the study, and shut the door. The\nexpression of mystery and amusement gave way to sadness and gravity as\nhe sat down in his arm-chair, and sighed as if much fatigued. She was\nchecked and alarmed, but she could not help asking, “Is he here?”\n\n“At the Swan. He came last night, and watched for me this morning as\nI came out of the hospital. We have been walking over the meadows to\nFordholm.”\n\nNo wonder Dr. May was hot and tired.\n\n“But is he not coming?” asked Ethel.\n\n“Yes, poor fellow; but hush, stop, say nothing to the others. I must not\nhave her agitated till she has had her dinner in peace, and the house is\nquiet. You know she cannot run away to her room as you would.”\n\n“Then he is really come for that?” cried Ethel breathlessly; and,\nperceiving the affirmative, added, “But why did he wait so long?”\n\n“He wished to see his way through his affairs, and also wanted to hear\nof her from Harry. I am afraid poor July’s colours were too bright.”\n\n“And why did he come to the Swan instead of to us?”\n\n“That was his fine, noble feeling. He thought it right to see me first,\nthat if I thought the decision too trying for Margaret, in her present\nstate, or if I disapproved of the long engagement, I might spare her all\nknowledge of his coming.”\n\n“Oh, papa, you won’t!”\n\n“I don’t know but that I ought; but yet, the fact is, that I cannot.\nWith that fine young fellow so generously, fondly attached I cannot find\nit in my heart to send him away for four years without seeing her, and\nyet, poor things, it might be better for them both. Oh, Ethel, if your\nmother were but here!”\n\nHe rested his forehead on his hands, and Ethel stood aghast at his\nunexpected reception of the addresses for which she had so long hoped.\nShe did not venture to speak, and presently he roused himself as the\ndinner-bell rang. “One comfort is,” he said, “that Margaret has more\ncomposure than I. Do you go to Cocksmoor this afternoon?”\n\n“I wished it.”\n\n“Take them all with you. You may tell them why when you are out. I\nmust have the house quiet. I shall get Margaret out into the shade, and\nprepare her, as best I can, before he comes at three o’clock.”\n\nIt was not flattering to be thus cleared out of the way, especially when\nfull of excited curiosity, but any such sensation was quite overborne by\nsympathy in his great anxiety, and Ethel’s only question was, “Had not\nFlora better stay to keep off company?”\n\n“No, no,” said Dr. May impatiently, “the fewer the better;” and hastily\npassing her, he dashed up to his room, nearly running over the nursery\nprocession, and, in a very few seconds, was seated at table, eating and\nspeaking by snatches, and swallowing endless draughts of cold water.\n\n“You are going to Cocksmoor!” said he, as they were finishing.\n\n“It is the right day,” said Richard. “Are you coming, Flora?”\n\n“Not to-day, I have to call on Mrs. Hoxton.”\n\n“Never mind Mrs. Hoxton,” said the doctor; “you had better go to-day, a\nfine cool day for a walk.”\n\nHe did not look as if he had found it so.\n\n“Oh, yes, Flora, you must come,” said Ethel, “we want you.”\n\n“I have engagements at home,” replied Flora.\n\n“And it really is a trying walk,” said Miss Winter.\n\n“You must,” reiterated Ethel. “Come to our room, and I will tell you\nwhy.”\n\n“I do not mean to go to Cocksmoor till something positive is settled. I\ncannot have anything to do with that woman.”\n\n“If you would only come upstairs,” implored Ethel, at the door, “I have\nsomething to tell you alone.”\n\n“I shall come up in due time. I thought you had outgrown closetings and\nfoolish secrets,” said Flora.\n\nHer movements were quickened, however, by her father, who, finding her\nwith Margaret in the drawing-room, ordered her upstairs in a peremptory\nmanner, which she resented, as treating her like a child, and therefore\nproceeded in no amiable mood to the room, where Ethel awaited her in\nwild tumultuous impatience.\n\n“Well, Ethel, what is this grand secret?”\n\n“Oh, Flora! Mr. Ernescliffe is at the Swan! He has been speaking to papa\nabout Margaret.”\n\n“Proposing for her, do you mean?” said Flora.\n\n“Yes, he is coming to see her this afternoon, and that is the reason\nthat papa wants us to be all out of the way.”\n\n“Did papa tell you this?”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel, beginning to perceive the secret of her displeasure,\n“but only because I was the first person he met; and Norman guessed it\nlong ago. Do put on your things! I’ll tell you all I know when we are\nout. Papa is so anxious to have the coast clear.”\n\n“I understand,” said Flora; “but I shall not go with you. Do not be\nafraid of my interfering with any one. I shall sit here.”\n\n“But papa said you were to go.”\n\n“If he had done me the favour of speaking to me himself,” said Flora, “I\nshould have shown him that it is not right that Margaret should be left\nwithout any one at hand in case she should be overcome. He is of no use\nin such cases, only makes things worse. I should not feel justified\nin leaving Margaret with no one else, but he is in one of those\nhand-over-head moods, when it is not of the least use to say a word to\nhim.”\n\n“Flora, how can you, when he expressly ordered you?”\n\n“All he meant was, do not be in the way, and I shall not show myself\nunless I am needed, when he would be glad enough of me. I am not bound\nto obey the very letter, like Blanche or Mary.”\n\nEthel looked horrified by the assertion of independence, but Richard\ncalled her from below, and, with one more fruitless entreaty, she ran\ndownstairs.\n\nRichard had been hearing all from his father, and it was comfortable\nto talk the matter over with him, and hear explained the anxiety which\nfrightened her, while she scarcely comprehended it; how Dr. May could\nnot feel certain whether it was right or expedient to promote an\nengagement which must depend on health so uncertain as poor Margaret’s,\nand how he dreaded the effect on the happiness of both.\n\nEthel’s romance seemed to be turning to melancholy, and she walked on\ngravely and thoughtfully, though repeating that there could be no\ndoubt of Margaret’s perfect recovery by the time of the return from the\nvoyage.\n\nHer lessons were somewhat nervous and flurried, and even the sight of\ntwo very nice neat new scholars, of very different appearance from the\nrest, and of much superior attainments, only half interested her. Mary\nwas enchanted at them as a pair of prodigies, actually able to read! and\nhad made out their names, and their former abodes, and how they had been\nused to go to school, and had just come to live in the cottage deserted\nby the lamented Una.\n\nEthel thought it quite provoking in her brother to accede to Mary’s\nentreaties that they should go and call on this promising importation.\nEven the children’s information that they were taught now by “Sister\nCherry” failed to attract her; but Richard looked at his watch, and\ndecided that it was too soon to go home, and she had to submit to her\nfate.\n\nVery different was the aspect of the house from the wild Irish cabin\nappearance that it had in the M’Carthy days. It was the remains of\nan old farm-house that had seen better days, somewhat larger than the\ngeneral run of the Cocksmoor dwellings. Respectable furniture had taken\nup its abode against the walls, the kitchen was well arranged, and,\nin spite of the wretched flooring and broken windows, had an air of\ncomfort. A very tidy woman was bustling about, still trying to get rid\nof the relics of her former tenants, who might, she much feared, have\nleft a legacy of typhus fever. The more interesting person was, however,\na young woman of three or four and twenty, pale, and very lame, and with\nthe air of a respectable servant, her manners particularly pleasing.\nIt appeared that she was the daughter of a first wife, and, after the\nperiod of schooling, had been at service, but had been lamed by a fall\ndownstairs, and had been obliged to come home, just as scarcity of work\nhad caused her father to leave his native parish, and seek employment at\nother quarries. She had hoped to obtain plain work, but all the family\nwere dismayed and disappointed at the wild spot to which they had come,\nand anxiously availed themselves of this introduction to beg that the\nelder boy and girl might be admitted into the town school, distant as it\nwas. At another time, the thought of Charity Elwood would have engrossed\nEthel’s whole mind, now she could hardly attend, and kept looking\neagerly at Richard as he talked endlessly with the good mother. When,\nat last, they did set off, he would not let her gallop home like a\nsteam-engine, but made her take his arm, when he found that she could\nnot otherwise moderate her steps. At the long hill a figure appeared,\nand, as soon as Richard was certified of its identity, he let her fly,\nlike a bolt from a crossbow, and she stood by Dr. May’s side.\n\nA little ashamed, she blushed instead of speaking, and waited for\nRichard to come up and begin. Neither did he say anything, and they\npaused till, the silence disturbing her, she ventured a “Well, papa!”\n\n“Well, poor things. She was quite overcome when first I told her--said\nit would be hard on him, and begged me to tell him that he would be much\nhappier if he thought no more of her.”\n\n“Did Margaret?” cried Ethel. “Oh! could she mean it?”\n\n“She thought she meant it, poor dear, and repeated such things again and\nagain; but when I asked whether I should send him away without seeing\nher, she cried more than ever, and said, ‘You are tempting me! It would\nbe selfishness.’”\n\n“Oh, dear! she surely has seen him!”\n\n“I told her that I would be the last person to wish to tempt her to\nselfishness, but that I did not think that either could be easy in\nsettling such a matter through a third person.”\n\n“It would have been very unkind,” said Ethel; “I wonder she did not\nthink so.”\n\n“She did at last. I saw it could not be otherwise, and she said, poor\ndarling, that when he had seen her, he would know the impossibility; but\nshe was so agitated that I did not know how it could be.”\n\n“Has she?”\n\n“Ay, I told him not to stay too long, and left him under the tulip-tree\nwith her. I found her much more composed--he was so gentle and\nconsiderate. Ah! he is the very man! Besides, he has convinced her now\nthat affection brings him, not mere generosity, as she fancied.”\n\n“Oh, then it is settled!” cried Ethel joyously.\n\n“I wish it were! She has owned that if--if she were in health--but that\nis all, and he is transported with having gained so much! Poor fellow.\nSo far, I trust, it is better for them to know each other’s minds, but\nhow it is to be--”\n\n“But, papa, you know Sir Matthew Fleet said she was sure to get well;\nand in three years’ time--”\n\n“Yes, yes, that is the best chance. But it is a dreary lookout for two\nyoung things. That is in wiser hands, however! If only I saw what\nwas right to do! My miserable carelessness has undone you all!” he\nconcluded, almost inaudibly.\n\nIt was indeed, to him, a time of great distress and perplexity, wishing\nto act the part of father and mother both towards his daughter, acutely\nfeeling his want of calm decision, and torn to pieces at once by\nsympathy with the lovers, and by delicacy that held him back from\nseeming to bind the young man to an uncertain engagement, above all,\ntortured by self-reproach for the commencement of the attachment, and\nfor the misfortune that had rendered its prosperity doubtful.\n\nEthel could find no words of comfort in the bewildered glimpse at his\nsorrow and agitation. Richard spoke with calmness and good sense, and\nhis replies, though brief and commonplace, were not without effect in\nlessening the excitement and despondency which the poor doctor’s present\nmood had been aggravating.\n\nAt the door, Dr. May asked for Flora, and Ethel explained. If Flora had\nobtruded herself, he would have been irritated, but, as it was, he had\nno time to observe the disobedience, and saying that he hoped she was\nwith Margaret, sent Ethel into the drawing-room.\n\nFlora was not there, only Margaret lay on her sofa, and Ethel hesitated,\nshy, curious, and alarmed; but, as she approached, she was relieved to\nsee the blue eyes more serene even than usual, while a glow of colour\nspread over her face, making her like the blooming Margaret of old\ntimes; her expression was full of peace, but became somewhat amused\nat Ethel’s timid, awkward pauses, as she held out her hands, and said,\n“Come, dear Ethel.”\n\n“Oh, Margaret, Margaret!”\n\nAnd Ethel was drawn into her sister’s bosom. Presently she drew back,\ngazed at her sister inquiringly, and said in an odd, doubtful voice,\n“Then you are glad?”\n\nMargaret nearly laughed at the strange manner, but spoke with a\nsorrowful tone, “Glad in one way, dearest, almost too glad, and\ngrateful.”\n\n“Oh, I am so glad!” again said Ethel; “I thought it was making everybody\nunhappy.”\n\n“I don’t believe I could be that, now he has come, now I know;” and her\nvoice trembled. “There must be doubt and uncertainty,” she added, “but\nI cannot dwell on them just yet. They will settle what is right, I know,\nand, happen what may, I have always this to remember.”\n\n“Oh, that is right! Papa will be so relieved! He was afraid it had only\nbeen distress.”\n\n“Poor papa! Yes, I did not command myself at first; I was not sure\nwhether it was right to see him at all.”\n\n“Oh, Margaret, that was too bad!”\n\n“It did not seem right to encourage any such--such,” the word was lost,\n“to such a poor helpless thing as I am. I did not know what to do, and I\nam afraid I behaved like a silly child, and did not think of dear papa’s\nfeelings. But I will try to be good, and leave it all to them.”\n\n“And you are going to be happy?” said Ethel wistfully.\n\n“For the present, at least. I cannot help it,” said Margaret. “Oh, he\nis so kind, and so unselfish, and so beautifully gentle--and to think of\nhis still caring! But there, dear Ethel, I am not going to cry; do call\npapa, or he will think me foolish again. I want him to be quite at ease\nabout me before he comes.”\n\n“Then he is coming?”\n\n“Yes, at tea-time--so run, dear Ethel, and tell Jane to get his room\nready.”\n\nThe message quickened Ethel, and after giving it, and reporting\nconsolingly to her father, she went up to Flora, who had been a\nvoluntary prisoner upstairs all this time, and was not peculiarly\ngratified at such tidings coming only through the medium of Ethel. She\nhad before been sensible that, superior in discretion and effectiveness\nas she was acknowledged to be, she did not share so much of the\nconfidence and sympathy as some of the others, and she felt mortified\nand injured, though in this case it was entirely her own fault. The\nsense of alienation grew upon her.\n\nShe dressed quickly, and hurried down, that she might see Margaret\nalone; but the room was already prepared for tea, and the children were\nfast assembling. Ethel came down a few minutes after, and found Blanche\nclaiming Alan Ernescliffe as her lawful property, dancing round him,\nchattering, and looking injured if he addressed a word to any one else.\n\nHow did lovers look? was a speculation which had, more than once,\noccupied Ethel, and when she had satisfied herself that her father was\nat ease, she began to study it, as soon as a shamefaced consciousness\nwould allow her, after Alan’s warm shake of the hand.\n\nMargaret looked much as usual, only with more glow and brightness--Mr.\nErnescliffe, not far otherwise; he was as pale and slight as on his last\nvisit, with the same soft blue eyes, capable, however, of a peculiar,\nkeen, steady glance when he was listening, and which now seemed to be\nattending to Margaret’s every word or look, through all the delighted\nuproar which Aubrey, Blanche, and Mary kept up round him, or while\ntaking his share in the general conversation, telling of Harry’s\npopularity and good conduct on board the Alcestis, or listening to the\nhistory of Norman’s school adventures, which he had heard, in part, from\nHarry, and how young Jennings was entered in the flag-ship, as a boy,\nthough not yet to sail with his father.\n\nAfter the storm of the day the sky seemed quite clear, and Ethel\ncould not see that being lovers made much difference; to be sure papa\ndispleased Blanche, by calling her away to his side, when she would\nsqueeze her chair in between Alan’s and the sofa; and Alan took all the\nwaiting on Margaret exclusively to himself. Otherwise, there was nothing\nremarkable, and he was very much the same Mr. Ernescliffe whom they had\nreceived a year ago.\n\nIn truth, the next ten days were very happy. The future was left\nto rest, and Alan spent his mornings in the drawing-room alone with\nMargaret, and looked ever more brightly placid, while, with the rest, he\nwas more than the former kind playfellow, for he now took his place as\nthe affectionate elder brother, entering warmly into all their schemes\nand pleasures, and winning for himself a full measure of affection from\nall; even his little god-daughter began to know him, and smile at\nhis presence. Margaret and Ethel especially delighted in the look of\nenjoyment with which their father sat down to enter on the evening’s\nconversation after the day’s work; and Flora was well pleased that Mrs.\nHoxton should find Alan in the drawing-room, and ask afterwards about\nhis estate; and that Meta Rivers, after being certified that this was\ntheir Mr. Ernescliffe, pronounced that her papa thought him particularly\npleasing and gentlemanlike. There was something dignified in having a\nsister on the point of being engaged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\n\n     Sail forth into the sea, thou ship,\n       Through breeze and cloud, right onward steer;\n     The moistened eye, the trembling lip,\n       Are not the signs of doubt or fear!--LONGFELLOW.\n\n\nTranquility only lasted until Mr. Ernescliffe found it necessary to\nunderstand on what terms he was to stand. Every one was tender of\nconscience, anxious to do right, and desirous to yield to the opinion\nthat nobody could, or would give. While Alan begged for a positive\nengagement, Margaret scrupled to exchange promises that she might never\nbe able to fulfil, and both agreed to leave all to her father, who, in\nevery way, ought to have the best ability to judge whether there was\nunreasonable presumption in such a betrothal; but this very ability only\nserved to perplex the poor doctor more and more. It is far easier for a\nman to decide when he sees only one bearing of a case, than when, like\nDr. May, he not only sees them, but is rent by them in his inmost\nheart. Sympathising in turn with each lover, bitterly accusing his own\ncarelessness as the cause of all their troubles, his doubts contending\nwith his hopes, his conviction clashing with Sir Matthew Fleet’s\nopinion, his conscientious sincerity and delicacy conflicting with\nhis affection and eagerness, he was perfectly incapable of coming to a\ndecision, and suffered so cruelly, that Margaret was doubly distressed\nfor his sake, and Alan felt himself guilty of having rendered everybody\nmiserable.\n\nDr. May could not conceal his trouble, and rendered Ethel almost as\nunhappy as himself, after each conversation with her, though her hopes\nusually sprang up again, and she had a happy conviction that this was\nonly the second volume of the novel. Flora was not often called into his\ncouncils; confidence never came spontaneously from Dr. May to her; there\nwas something that did not draw it forth towards her, whether it resided\nin that half-sarcastic corner of her steady blue eye, or in the grave\ncommon-sense of her gentle voice. Her view of the case was known to be\nthat there was no need for so much perplexity--why should not Alan be\nthe best judge of his own happiness? If Margaret were to be delicate for\nlife, it would be better to have such a home to look to; and she soothed\nand comforted Margaret, and talked in a strain of unmixed hope and\nanticipation that often drew a smile from her sister, though she feared\nto trust to it.\n\nFlora’s tact and consideration in keeping the children away when the\nlovers could best be alone, and letting them in when the discussion was\nbecoming useless and harassing, her cheerful smiles, her evening music\nthat covered all sounds, her removal of all extra annoyances, were\ninvaluable, and Margaret appreciated them, as, indeed, Flora took care\nthat she should.\n\nMargaret begged to know her eldest brother’s judgment, but had great\ndifficulty in dragging it out. Diffidently as it was proposed, it\nwas clear and decided. He thought that his father had better send Sir\nMatthew Fleet a statement of Margaret’s present condition, and abide\nby his answer as to whether her progress warranted the hope of her\nrestoration.\n\nNever was Richard more surprised than by the gratitude with which his\nsuggestion was hailed, simple as it was, so that it seemed obvious\nthat others should have already thought of it. After the tossings of\nuncertainty, it was a positive relief to refer the question to some\nexternal voice, and only Ethel and Norman expressed strong dislike to\nSir Matthew becoming the arbiter of Margaret’s fate, and were scarcely\npacified by Dr. May’s assurance that he had not revealed the occasion of\nhis inquiry. The letter was sent, and repose returned, but hearts beat\nhigh on the morning when the answer was expected.\n\nDr. May watched the moment when his daughter was alone, carried the\nletter to her, and kissing her, said, with an oppressed voice, “I give\nyou joy, my dear.”\n\nShe read with suspended breath and palpitating heart. Sir Matthew\nthought her improvement sure, though slow, and had barely a doubt that,\nin a year, she would have regained her full strength and activity.\n\n“You will show it to Alan,” said Dr. May, as Margaret lifted her eyes to\nhis face inquiringly.\n\n“Will not you?” she said.\n\n“I cannot,” he answered. “I wish I was more helpful to you, my child,”\n he added wistfully, “but you will rest on him, and be happy together\nwhile he stays, will you not?”\n\n“Indeed I will, dear papa.”\n\nMr. Ernescliffe was with her as the doctor quitted her. She held the\nletter to him, “But,” she said slowly, “I see that papa does not believe\nit.”\n\n“You promised to abide by it!” he exclaimed, between entreaty and\nauthority.\n\n“I do; if you choose so to risk your hopes.”\n\n“But,” cried he, as he glanced hastily over the letter, “there can be\nno doubt! These words are as certain as language can make them. Why will\nyou not trust them?”\n\n“I see that papa does not.”\n\n“Despondency and self-reproach made him morbidly anxious. Believe so, my\nMargaret! You know he is no surgeon!”\n\n“His education included that line,” said Margaret. “I believe he has\nall but the manual dexterity. However, I would fain have faith in Sir\nMatthew,” she added, smiling, “and perhaps I am only swayed by the habit\nof thinking that papa must know best.”\n\n“He does in indifferent cases; but it is an old axiom, that a medical\nman should not prescribe for his own family; above all, in such a case,\nwhere it is but reasonable to believe an unprejudiced stranger, who\nalone is cool enough to be relied on. I absolutely depend on him!”\n\nMargaret absolutely depended on the bright cheerful look of conviction.\n“Yes,” she said, “we will try to make papa take pleasure in the\nprospect. Perhaps I could do more if I made the attempt.”\n\n“I am sure you could, if you would let me give you more support. If I\nwere but going to remain with you!”\n\n“Don’t let us be discontented,” said Margaret, smiling, “when so much\nmore has been granted than I dare to hope. Be it as it may, let us be\nhappy in what we have.”\n\n“It makes you happy?” said he, archly reading her face to draw out the\navowal, but he only made her hide it, with a mute caress of the hand\nthat held hers. She was glad enough to rest in the present, now that\neverything concurred to satisfy her conscience in so doing, and come\nwhat might, the days now spent together would be a possession of joy for\never.\n\nCaptain Gordon contrived to afford his lieutenant another fortnight’s\nleave, perhaps because he was in dread of losing him altogether, for\nAlan had some doubts, and many longings to remain. Had it been possible\nto marry at once, he would have quitted the navy immediately; and he\nwould have given worlds to linger beside Margaret’s couch, and claim her\nthe first moment possible, believing his care more availing than all. He\nwas, however, so pledged to Captain Gordon, that, without strong cause,\nhe would not have been justified in withdrawing; besides, Harry was\nunder his charge, and Dr. May and Margaret both thought, with the\ncaptain, that an active life would be a better occupation for him than\nwatching her. He would never be able to settle down at his new home\ncomfortably without her, and he would be more in the way of duty while\npursuing his profession, so Margaret nerved herself against using her\ninfluence to detain him, and he thanked her for it.\n\nThough hope and affection could not an once repair an injured spine,\nthey had wonderful powers in inciting Margaret to new efforts. Alan\nwas as tender and ready of hand as Richard, and more clever and\nenterprising; and her unfailing trust in him prevented all alarms and\nmisgivings, so that wonders were effected, and her father beheld her\nstanding with so little support, looking so healthful and so blithe,\nthat his forebodings melted away, and he talked joyously of the future.\n\nThe great achievement was taking her round the garden. She could not\nbear the motion of wheels, but Alan adopted the hammock principle, and,\nwith the aid of Richard and his crony, the carpenter, produced a machine\nin which no other power on earth could have prevailed on her to trust\nherself, but in which she was carried round the garden so successfully,\nthat there was even a talk of next Sunday, and of the Minster.\n\nIt was safely accomplished, and tired as she was, Margaret felt, as\nshe whispered to Alan, that he had now crowned all the joy that he had\nbrought to her.\n\nEthel used to watch them, and think how beautiful their countenances\nwere, and talk them over with her father, who was quite happy about them\nnow. She gave assistance, which Alan never once called unhandy, to all\nhis contrivances, and often floundered in upon his conferences with\nMargaret, in a way that would have been very provoking, if she had not\nalways blushed and looked so excessively discomfited, and they had only\nto laugh and reassure her.\n\nAlan was struck by finding that the casual words spoken on the way from\nCocksmoor had been so strenuously acted on, and he brought on himself\na whole torrent of Ethel’s confused narratives, which Richard and Flora\nwould fain have checked; but Margaret let them continue, as she saw him\na willing listener, and was grateful to him for comprehending the ardent\ngirl.\n\nHe declared himself to have a share in the matter, reminding Ethel of\nher appeal to him to bind himself to the service of Cocksmoor. He sent\na sovereign at once, to aid in a case of the sudden death of a pig; and\nwhen securely established in his brotherly right, he begged Ethel to\nlet him know what would help her most. She stood colouring, twisting\nher hands, and wondering what to say, whereupon he relieved her by a\nproposal to leave an order for ten pounds, to be yearly paid into her\nhands, as a fixed income for her school.\n\nA thousand a year could hardly have been so much to Ethel. “Thank you!\nOh, this is charming! We could set up a regular school! Cherry Elwood is\nthe very woman! Alan, you have made our fortune! Oh, Margaret, Margaret!\nI must go and tell Ritchie and Mary! This is the first real step to our\nchurch and all!”\n\n“May I do it?” said Alan, turning to Margaret, as Ethel frantically\nburst out of the room; “perhaps I should have asked leave?”\n\n“I was going to thank you,” said Margaret. “It is the very kindest thing\nyou could have done by dear Ethel! the greatest comfort to us. She will\nbe at peace now, when anything hinders her from going to Cocksmoor.”\n\n“I wonder,” said Alan, musing, “whether we shall ever be able to help\nher more substantially. I cannot do anything hastily, for you know\nMaplewood is still in the hands of the executors, and I cannot tell what\nclaims there may be upon me; but by-and-by, when I return, if I find no\nother pressing duty, might not a church at Cocksmoor be a thankoffering\nfor all I have found here?”\n\n“Oh, Alan, what joy it would be!”\n\n“It is a long way off,” he said sadly; “and perhaps her force of\nperseverance will have prevailed alone.”\n\n“I suppose I must not tell her, even as a vision.”\n\n“It is too uncertain; I do not know the wants of the Maplewood people,\nand I must provide for Hector. I would not let these vague dreams\ninterfere with her resolute work; but, Margaret, what a vision it is! I\ncan see you laying the first stone on that fine heathy brow.”\n\n“Oh, your godchild should lay the first stone!”\n\n“She shall, and you shall lead her. And there shall be Ethel’s sharp\nface full of indescribable things as she marshals her children, and\nRichard shall be curate, and read in his steady soft tone, and your\nfather shall look sunny with his boys around him, and you--”\n\n“Oh, Alan,” said Margaret, who had been listening with a smile, “it is,\nindeed, a long way off!”\n\n“I shall look to it as the haven where I would be,” said the sailor.\n\nThey often spoke together of this scheme, ever decking it in brighter\ncolours. The topic seemed to suit them better than their own future, for\nthere was no dwelling on that without an occasional misgiving, and\nthe more glad the anticipation, the deeper the sigh that followed on\nMargaret’s part, till Mr. Ernescliffe followed her lead, and they seldom\nspoke of these uncertainties, but outwardly smiled over the present,\ninwardly dwelt on the truly certain hopes. There were readings shared\ntogether, made more precious than all, by the conversations that ensued.\n\nThe hour for parting came at last. Ethel never knew what passed in the\ndrawing-room, whence every one was carefully excluded. Dr. May wandered\nabout, keeping guard over the door, and watching the clock, till, at the\nlast moment, he knocked, and called in a trembling voice, “Ernescliffe!\nAlan! it is past the quarter! You must not stay!”\n\nThe other farewells were hurried; Alan seemed voiceless, only nodding in\nreply to Mary’s vociferous messages to Harry, and huskily whispering to\nEthel, “Good luck to Cocksmoor!”\n\nThe next moment the door had shut on him, and Dr. May and Flora had gone\nto her sister, whom she found not tearful, but begging to be left alone.\n\nWhen they saw her again, she was cheerful; she kept up her composure and\nanimation without flagging, nor did she discontinue her new exertions,\nbut seemed decidedly the happier for all that had passed.\n\nLetters came every day for her, and presents to every one. Ethel had a\ngold chain and eyeglass, which, it was hoped, might cure her of frowning\nand stooping, though her various ways of dangling her new possession\ncaused her to be so much teased by Flora and Norman, that, but for\nregard to Margaret’s feelings, she would not have worn it for three\ndays.\n\nTo Mary was sent a daguerreotype of Harry, her glory and delight. Say,\nwho would, that it had pig’s eyes, a savage frown, a pudding chin,\nthere were his own tight rings of hair, his gold-banded cap, his bright\nbuttons, how could she prize it enough? She exhibited it to the little\nones ten times a day, she kissed it night and morning, and registered\nher vow always to sleep with it under her “pilow,” in a letter of\nthanks, which Margaret defended and despatched, in spite of Miss\nWinter’s horrors at its disregard of orthography.\n\nIt was nearly the last letter before the Alcestis was heard of at\nSpithead. Then she sailed; she sent in her letters to Plymouth, and her\nfinal greetings by a Falmouth cutter--poor Harry’s wild scrawl in pencil\nlooking very sea-sick.\n\n\n“Dear papa and all, good-bye. We are out of sight of land. Three years,\nand keep up a good heart. I shall soon be all right.\n\n                                       “Your H. MAY.”\n\n\nIt was enclosed in Mr. Ernescliffe’s envelope, and with it came\ntidings that Harry’s brave spirit was not failing, even under untoward\ncircumstances, but he had struggled on deck, and tried to write,\nwhen all his contemporaries had given in; in fact, he was a fine\nfellow--every one liked him, and Captain Gordon, though chary of\ncommendation, had held him up to the other youngsters as an example of\nknowing what a sailor was meant to be like.\n\nMargaret smiled, and cried over the news when she imparted it--but all\nserenely--and though she was glad to be alone, and wrote journals for\nAlan, when she could not send letters, she exerted herself to be the\nsame sister as usual to the rest of the household, and not to give way\nto her wandering musings.\n\nFrom one subject her attention never strayed. Ethel had never found any\nlack of sympathy in her for her Cocksmoor pursuits; but the change now\nshowed that, where once Margaret had been interested merely as a kind\nsister, she now had a personal concern, and she threw herself into all\nthat related to it as her own chief interest and pursuit--becoming the\nforemost in devising plans, and arranging the best means of using Mr.\nErnescliffe’s benefaction.\n\nThe Elwood family had grown in the good opinion of the Mays. Charity\nhad hobbled to church, leaning on her father’s arm, and being invited\nto dinner in the kitchen, the acquaintance had been improved, and nurse\nherself had pronounced her such a tidy, good sort of body, that it was\na pity she had met with such a misfortune. If Miss Ethel brought in\nnothing but the like of her, they should be welcome; poor thing, how\ntired she was!\n\nNurse’s opinions were apt to be sagacious, especially when in the face\nof her prejudices, and this gave Margaret confidence. Cherry proved to\nhave been carefully taught by a good clergyman and his wife, and to\nbe of very different stamp from the persons to whom the girls were\naccustomed. They were charmed with her, and eagerly offered to supply\nher with books--respecting her the more when they found that Mr.\nHazlewood had already lent her their chief favourites. Other and greater\nneeds they had no power to fill up.\n\n“It is so lone without the church bells, you see, miss,” said Mrs.\nElwood. “Our tower had a real fine peal, and my man was one of the\nringers. I seems quite lost without them, and there was Cherry, went\na’most every day with the children.”\n\n“Every day!” cried Mary, looking at her with respect.\n\n“It was so near,” said Cherry, “I could get there easy, and I got used\nto it when I was at school.”\n\n“Did it not take up a great deal of time?” said Ethel.\n\n“Why, you see, ma’am, it came morning and night, out of working times,\nand I can’t be stirring much.”\n\n“Then you miss it sadly?” said Ethel.\n\n“Yes, ma’am, it made the day go on well like, and settled a body’s mind,\nwhen I fretted for what could not be helped. But I try not to fret after\nit now, and Mr. Hazlewood said, if I did my best wherever I was, the\nLord would still join our prayers together.”\n\nMr. Hazlewood was recollected by Mr. Wilmot as an old college friend,\nand a correspondence with him fully confirmed the favourable estimate of\nthe Elwoods, and was decisive in determining that the day-school, with\nAlan’s ten pounds as salary, and a penny a week from each child, should\nbe offered to Cherry.\n\nMr. Hazlewood answered for her sound excellence, and aptitude for\nmanaging little children, though he did not promise genius, such as\nshould fulfil the requirements of modern days. With these Cocksmoor\ncould dispense at present; Cherry was humbly gratified, and her parents\ndelighted with the honour and profit; there was a kitchen which afforded\ngreat facilities, and Richard and his carpenter managed the fitting to\nadmiration; Margaret devised all manner of useful arrangements, settled\nmatters with great earnestness, saw Cherry frequently, discussed plans,\nand learned the history and character of each child, as thoroughly as\nEthel herself. Mr. Ramsden himself came to the opening of the school,\nand said so much of the obligations of Cocksmoor to the young ladies,\nthat Ethel would not have known which way to look, if Flora had not\nkindly borne the brunt of his compliments.\n\nEvery one was pleased, except Mrs. Green, who took upon herself to set\nabout various malicious reports of Cherry Elwood; but nobody cared for\nthem, except Mrs. Elwood, who flew into such passions, that Ethel was\nquite disappointed in her, though not in Cherry, who meekly tried to\nsilence her mother, begged the young ladies not to be vexed, and showed\na quiet dignity that soon made the shafts of slander fall inoffensively.\n\nAll went well; there was a school instead of a hubbub, clean faces\ninstead of dirty, shining hair instead of wild elf-locks, orderly\nchildren instead of little savages. The order and obedience that Ethel\ncould not gain in six months, seemed impressed in six days by Cherry;\nthe neat work made her popular with the mothers, her firm gentleness\nwon the hearts of the children, and the kitchen was filled not only with\nboys and girls from the quarry, but with some little ones from outlying\ncottages of Fordholm and Abbotstoke, and there was even a smart little\nfarmer, who had been unbearable at home.\n\nMargaret’s unsuccessful bath-chair was lent to Cherry, and in it her\nscholars drew her to Stoneborough every Sunday, and slowly began to\nredeem their character with the ladies, who began to lose the habit of\nshrinking out of their way--the Stoneborough children did so instead;\nand Flora and Ethel were always bringing home stories of injustice\nto their scholars, fancied or real, and of triumphs in their having\nexcelled any national school girl. The most stupid children at Cocksmoor\nalways seemed to them wise in comparison with the Stoneborough girls,\nand the Sunday-school might have become to Ethel a school of rivalry,\nif Richard had not opened her eyes by a quiet observation, that the town\ngirls seemed to fare as ill with her, as the Cocksmoor girls did with\nthe town ladies. Then she caught herself up, tried to be candid, and\nfound that she was not always impartial in her judgments. Why would\ncompetition mingle even in the best attempts?\n\nCherry did not so bring forward her scholars that Ethel could have many\ntriumphs of this dangerous kind. Indeed, Ethel was often vexed with\nher; for though she taught needlework admirably, and enforced correct\nreading, and reverent repetition, her strong provincial dialect was a\nstumbling-block; she could not put questions without book, and nothing\nwould teach her Ethel’s rational system of arithmetic. That she was a\ncapital dame, and made the children very good, was allowed; but now and\nthen, when mortified by hearing what was done at Stoneborough, Fordholm,\nor Abbotstoke, Ethel would make vigorous efforts, which resulted only in\nher coming home fuming at Cherry’s “outrageous dullness.”\n\nThese railings always hurt Margaret, who had made Cherry almost into a\nfriend, and generally liked to have a visit from her during the\nSunday, when she always dined with the servants. Then school questions,\nCocksmoor news, and the tempers of the children, were talked over, and\nCherry was now and then drawn into home reminiscences, and descriptions\nof the ways of her former school. There was no fear of spoiling\nher--notice from her superiors was natural to her, and she had the\nlady-likeness of womanly goodness, so as never to go beyond her own\nplace. She had had many trials too, and Margaret learned the true\nhistory of them, as she won Cherry’s confidence, and entered into them,\nfeeling their likeness, yet dissimilarity, to her own.\n\nCherry had been a brisk happy girl in a good place, resting in one of\nthe long engagements that often extend over half the life of a servant,\nenjoying the nod of her baker as he left his bread, and her walk from\nchurch with him on alternate Sundays. But poor Cherry had been exposed\nto the perils of window-cleaning; and, after a frightful fall, had\nwakened to find herself in a hospital, and her severe sufferings had\nleft her a cripple for life.\n\nAnd the baker had not been an Alan Ernescliffe! She did not complain of\nhim--he had come to see her, and had been much grieved, but she had\ntold him she could never be a useful wife; and, before she had used her\ncrutches, he was married to her pretty fellow-servant.\n\nCherry spoke very simply; she hoped it was better for Long, and believed\nSusan would make him a good wife. Ethel would have thought she did not\nfeel, but Margaret knew better.\n\nShe stroked the thin slight fingers, and gently said, “Poor Cherry!” and\nCherry wiped away a tear, and said, “Yes, ma’am, thank you, it is best\nfor him. I should not have wished him to grieve for what cannot be\nhelped.”\n\n“Resignation is the great comfort.”\n\n“Yes, ma’am. I have a great deal to be thankful for. I don’t blame no\none, but I do see how some, as are married, seem to get to think more of\nthis world; and now and then I fancy I can see how it is best for me as\nit is.”\n\nMargaret sighed, as she remembered certain thoughts before Alan’s\nreturn.\n\n“Then, ma’am, there has been such goodness! I did vex at being a poor\nhelpless thing, nothing but a burden on father; and when we had to go\nfrom home, and Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood and all, I can’t tell you how bad\nit was, ma’am.”\n\n“Then you are comforted now?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am,” said Cherry, brightening. “It seems as if He had given me\nsomething to do, and there are you, and Mr. Richard, and Miss Ethel,\nto help. I should like, please God, to be of some good to those poor\nchildren.”\n\n“I am sure you will, Cherry; I wish I could do as much.”\n\nCherry’s tears had come again. “Ah! ma’am, you--” and she stopped short,\nand rose to depart. Margaret held out her hand to wish her good-bye.\n“Please, miss, I was thinking how Mr. Hazlewood said that God fits our\nplace to us, and us to our place.”\n\n“Thank you, Cherry, you are leaving me something to remember.”\n\nAnd Margaret lay questioning with herself, whether the schoolmistress\nhad not been the most self-denying of the two; but withal gazing on the\nhoop of pearls which Alan had chosen as the ring of betrothal.\n\n“The pearl of great price,” murmured she to herself; “if we hold that,\nthe rest will soon matter but little. It remaineth that both they that\nhave wives, be as they that have none, and they that weep, as though\nthey wept not, and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not! If\never Alan and I have a home together upon earth, may all too confident\njoy be tempered by the fears that we have begun with! I hope this\nprobation may make me less likely to be taken up with the cares and\npleasures of his position than I might have been last year. He is one\nwho can best help the mind to go truly upward. But oh, that voyage!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\n\n     Heart affluence in household talk,\n     From social fountains never dry.--TENNYSON.\n\n\n“What a bore!”\n\n“What’s the matter now?”\n\n“Here has this old fellow asked me to dinner again!”\n\n“A fine pass we are come to!” cried Dr. May, half amused, half irate.\n“I should like to know what I should have said at your age if the\nhead-master had asked me to dinner.”\n\n“Papa is not so very fond of dining at Dr. Hoxton’s,” said Ethel. “A\nwhipper-snapper schoolboy, who might be thankful to dine anywhere!”\n continued Dr. May, while the girls burst out laughing, and Norman looked\ninjured.\n\n“It is very ungrateful of Norman,” said Flora; “I cannot see what he\nfinds to complain of.”\n\n“You would know,” said Norman, “if, instead of playing those perpetual\ntunes of yours, you had to sit it out in that perfumy drawing-room,\nwithout anything to listen to worth hearing. If I have looked over that\ncourt album once, I have a dozen times, and there is not another book in\nthe place.”\n\n“I am glad there is not,” said Flora. “I am quite ashamed to see you for\never turning over those old pictures. You cannot guess how stupid you\nlook. I wonder Mrs. Hoxton likes to have you,” she added, patting his\nshoulders between jest and earnest.\n\n“I wish she would not, then. It is only to escort you.”\n\n“Nonsense, Norman, you know better,” cried Ethel. “You know it is for\nyour own sake, and to make up for their injustice, that he invites you,\nor Flora either.”\n\n“Hush, Ethel! he gives himself quite airs enough already,” said the\ndoctor.\n\n“Papa!” said Ethel, in vexation, though he gave her a pinch to show it\nwas all in good humour, while he went on, “I am glad to hear they do\nleave him to himself in a corner. A very good thing too! Where else\nshould a great gawky schoolboy be?”\n\n“Safe at home, where I wish he would let me be,” muttered Norman, though\nhe contrived to smile, and followed Flora out of the room, without\nsubjecting himself to the imputation of offended dignity.\n\nEthel was displeased, and began her defence: “Papa, I wish--” and there\nshe checked herself.\n\n“Eh! Miss Ethel’s bristles up!” said her father, who seemed in a\nsomewhat mischievous mood of teasing.\n\n“How could you, papa?” cried she.\n\n“How could I what, Miss Etheldred?”\n\n“Plague Norman,”--the words would come. “Accuse him of airs.”\n\n“I hate to see young fellows above taking an honour from their elders,”\n said Dr. May.\n\n“Now, papa, papa, you know it is no such thing. Dr. Hoxton’s parties are\nvery dull--you know they are, and it is not fair on Norman. If he\nwas set up and delighted at going so often, then you would call him\nconceited.”\n\n“Conceit has a good many lurking-places,” said Dr. May. “It is harder to\ngo and be overlooked, than to stay at home.”\n\n“Now, papa, you are not to call Norman conceited,” cried Ethel. “You\ndon’t believe that he is any such thing.”\n\n“Why, not exactly,” said Dr. May, smiling. “The boy has missed it\nmarvellously; but, you see, he has everything that subtle imp would wish\nto feed upon, and it is no harm to give him a lick with the rough side\nof the tongue, as your canny Scots grandfather used to say.”\n\n“Ah! if you knew, papa--” began Ethel.\n\n“If I knew?”\n\n“No, no, I must not tell.”\n\n“What, a secret, is there?”\n\n“I wish it was not; I should like to tell you very much, but then, you\nsee, it is Norman’s, and you are to be surprised.”\n\n“Your surprise is likely to be very much like Blanche’s birthday\npresents, a stage aside.”\n\n“No, I am going to keep it to myself.”\n\nTwo or three days after, as Ethel was going to the schoolroom after\nbreakfast, Dr. May beckoned her back to the dining-room, and, with his\nmerry look of significance, said, “Well, ma’am, I have found out your\nmystery!”\n\n“About Norman? Oh, papa! Did he tell you?”\n\n“When I came home from the hospital last night, at an hour when all\nrespectable characters, except doctors and police, should be in their\nwarm beds, I beheld a light in Norman’s window, so methought I would see\nwhat Gravity was doing out of his bed at midnight--”\n\n“And you found him at his Greek--”\n\n“So that was the meaning of his looking so lank and careworn, just as he\ndid last year, and he the prince of the school! I could have found it in\nmy heart to fling the books at his head!”\n\n“But you consent, don’t you, to his going up for the scholarship?”\n\n“I consent to anything, as long as he keeps within due bounds, and does\nnot work himself to death. I am glad of knowing it, for now I can put a\nmoderate check upon it.”\n\n“And did he tell you all about it?”\n\n“He told me he felt as if he owed it to us to gain something for\nhimself, since I had given up the Randall to gratify him--a pretty sort\nof gratification.”\n\n“Yes, and he will be glad to get away from school. He says he knows it\nis bad for him--as it is uncomfortable to be singled out in the way Dr.\nHoxton does now. You know,” pleaded Ethel, “it is not ingratitude or\nelation, but it is, somehow, not nice to be treated as he is, set apart\nfrom the rest.”\n\n“True; Dr. Hoxton never had taste or judgment. If Norman were not a\nlusus naturae,” said Dr. May, hesitating for a word, “his head would\nhave been turned long ago. And he wants companions too--he has been\nforced out of boyhood too soon, poor fellow--and Harry gone too. He\ndoes not get anything like real relaxation, and he will be better among\nyouths than boys. Stoneborough will never be what it was in my time!”\n added the doctor mournfully. “I never thought to see the poor old place\ncome to this; but there--when all the better class send their sons to\nthe great public schools, and leave nothing but riff-raff here, one is\nforced, for a boy’s own sake, to do the same.”\n\n“Oh, I am so glad! Then you have consented to the rest of Norman’s\nscheme, and will not keep poor little Tom at school here without him?”\n\n“By what he tells me it would be downright ruin to the boy. I little\nthought to have to take a son of mine away from Stoneborough; but Norman\nis the best judge, and he is the only person who seems to have made\nany impression on Tom, so I shall let it be. In fact,” he added, half\nsmiling, “I don’t know what I could refuse old June.”\n\n“That’s right!” cried Ethel. “That is so nice! Then, if Norman gets the\nscholarship, Tom is to go to Mr. Wilmot first, and then to Eton!”\n\n“If Norman gains the scholarship, but that is an if,” said Dr. May, as\nthough hoping for a loop-hole to escape offending the shade of Bishop\nWhichcote.\n\n“Oh, papa, you cannot doubt of that!”\n\n“I cannot tell, Ethel. He is facile princeps here in his own world, but\nwe do not know how it may be when he is measured with public schoolmen,\nwho have had more first-rate tutorship than poor old Hoxton’s.”\n\n“Ah! he says so, but I thought that was all his humility.”\n\n“Better he should be prepared. If he had had all those advantages--but\nit may be as well after all. I always had a hankering to have sent him\nto Eton, but your dear mother used to say it was not fair on the others.\nAnd now, to see him striving in order to give the advantage of it to his\nlittle brother! I only hope Master Thomas is worthy of it--but it is a\nboy I can’t understand.”\n\n“Nor I,” said Ethel; “he never seems to say anything he can help, and\ngoes after Norman without talking to any one else.”\n\n“I give him up to Norman’s management,” said Dr. May. “He says the\nboy is very clever, but I have not seen it; and, as to more serious\nmatters--However, I must take it on Norman’s word that he is wishing to\nlearn truth. We made an utter mistake about him; I don’t know who is to\nblame for it.”\n\n“Have you told Margaret about Norman’s plan?” asked Ethel.\n\n“No; he desired me to say nothing. Indeed, I should not like Tom’s\nleaving school to be talked of beforehand.”\n\n“Norman said he did not want Flora to hear, because she is so much with\nthe Hoxton’s, and he said they would all watch him.”\n\n“Ay, ay, and we must keep his secret. What a boy it is! But it is not\nsafe to say conceited things. We shall have a fall yet, Ethel. Not\nseventeen, remember, and brought up at a mere grammar-school.”\n\n“But we shall still have the spirit that made him try,” said Ethel, “and\nthat is the thing.”\n\n“And, to tell the truth,” said the doctor, lingering, “for my own part,\nI don’t care a rush for it!” and he dashed off to his work, while Ethel\nstood laughing.\n\n“Papa was so very kind,” said Norman tremulously, when Ethel followed\nhim to his room, to congratulate him on having gained his father’s\nassent, of which he had been more in doubt than she.\n\n“And you see he quite approves of the scheme for Tom, except for\nthinking it disrespect to Bishop Whichcote. He said he only hoped Tom\nwas worthy of it.”\n\n“Tom!” cried Norman. “Take my word for it, Ethel, Tom will surprise you\nall. He will beat us all to nothing, I know!”\n\n“If only he can be cured of--”\n\n“He will,” said Norman, “when once he has outgrown his frights, and that\nhe may do at Mr. Wilmot’s, apart from those fellows. When I go up for\nthis scholarship, you must look after his lessons, and see if you are\nnot surprised at his construing!”\n\n“When you go. It will be in a month!”\n\n“He has told no one, I hope.”\n\n“No; but I hardly think he will bear not telling Margaret.”\n\n“Well--I hate a thing being out of one’s own keeping. I should not so\nmuch dislike Margaret’s knowing, but I won’t have Flora know--mind that,\nEthel,” he said, with disproportionate vehemence.\n\n“I only hope Flora will not be vexed. But oh, dear! how nice it will be\nwhen you have it, telling Meta Rivers, and all!”\n\n“And this is a fine way of getting it, standing talking here. Not that I\nshall--you little know what public schools can do! But that is no reason\nagainst trying.”\n\n“Good-night, then. Only one thing more. You mean that, till further\norders, Margaret should not know?”\n\n“Of course,” said Norman impatiently. “She won’t take any of Flora’s\nsilly affronts, and, what is more, she would not care half so much as\nbefore Alan Ernescliffe came.”\n\n“Oh, Norman, Norman! I’m sure--”\n\n“Why, it is what they always say. Everybody can’t be first, and\nErnescliffe has the biggest half of her, I can see.”\n\n“I am sure I did not,” said Ethel, in a mortified voice.\n\n“Why, of course, it always comes of people having lovers.”\n\n“Then I am sure I won’t!” exclaimed Ethel.\n\nNorman went into a fit of laughing.\n\n“You may laugh, Norman, but I will never let papa or any of you be\nsecond to any one!” she cried vehemently.\n\nA brotherly home-truth followed: “Nobody asked you, sir, she said!” was\nmuttered by Norman, still laughing heartily.\n\n“I know,” said Ethel, not in the least offended, “I am very ugly, and\nvery awkward, but I don’t care. There never can be anybody in all the\nworld that I shall like half as well as papa, and I am glad no one is\never likely to make me care less for him and Cocksmoor.”\n\n“Stay till you are tried,” said Norman.\n\nEthel squeezed up her eyes, curled up her nose, showed her teeth in\na horrible grimace, and made a sort of snarl: “Yah! That’s the face I\nshall make at them!” and then, with another good-night, ran to her own\nroom.\n\nNorman was, to a certain extent, right with regard to Margaret--her\nthoughts and interest had been chiefly engrossed by Alan Ernescliffe,\nand so far drawn away from her own family, that when the Alcestis was\nabsolutely gone beyond all reach of letters for the present, Margaret\ncould not help feeling somewhat of a void, and as if the home concerns\nwere not so entire an occupation for her mind as formerly.\n\nShe would fain have thrown herself into them again, but she became\nconscious that there was a difference. She was still the object of her\nfather’s intense tenderness and solicitude, indeed she could not be\notherwise, but it came over her sometimes that she was less necessary\nto him than in the first year. He was not conscious of any change, and,\nindeed, it hardly amounted to a change, and yet Margaret, lying inactive\nand thoughtful, began to observe that the fullness of his confidence was\npassing to Ethel. Now and then it would appear that he fancied he had\ntold Margaret little matters, when he had really told them to Ethel;\nand it was Ethel who would linger with him in the drawing-room after\nthe others had gone up at night, or who would be late at the morning’s\nreading, and disarm Miss Winter, by pleading that papa had been talking\nto her. The secret they shared together was, of course, the origin of\nmuch of this; but also Ethel was now more entirely the doctor’s own than\nMargaret could be after her engagement; and there was a likeness of mind\nbetween the father and daughter that could not but develop more in\nthis year, than in all Ethel’s life, when she had made the most rapid\nprogress. Perhaps, too, the doctor looked on Margaret rather as\nthe authority and mistress of his house, while Ethel was more of a\nplayfellow; and thus, without either having the least suspicion that\nthe one sister was taking the place of the other, and without any actual\nneglect of Margaret, Ethel was his chief companion.\n\n“How excited and anxious Norman looks!” said Margaret, one day, when he\nhad rushed in at the dinner-hour, asking for his father, and, when he\ncould not find him, shouting out for Ethel. “I hope there is nothing\namiss. He has looked thin and worn for some time, and yet his work at\nschool is very easy to him.”\n\n“I wish there maybe nothing wrong there again,” said Flora. “There!\nthere’s the front door banging! He is off! Ethel!--” stepping to the\ndoor, and calling in her sister, who came from the street door, her hair\nblowing about with the wind. “What did Norman want?”\n\n“Only to know whether papa had left a note for Dr. Hoxton,” said Ethel,\nlooking very confused and very merry.\n\n“That was not all,” said Flora. “Now don’t be absurd, Ethel--I hate\nmysteries.”\n\n“Last time I had a secret you would not believe it,” said Ethel,\nlaughing.\n\n“Come!” exclaimed Flora, “why cannot you tell us at once what is going\non?”\n\n“Because I was desired not,” said Ethel. “You will hear it soon enough,”\n and she capered a little.\n\n“Let her alone, Flora,” said Margaret. “I see there is nothing wrong.”\n\n“If she is desired to be silent, there is nothing to be said,” replied\nFlora, sitting down again, while Ethel ran away to guard her secret.\n\n“Absurd!” muttered Flora. “I cannot imagine why Ethel is always making\nmysteries!”\n\n“She cannot help other people having confidence in her,” said Margaret\ngently.\n\n“She need not be so important, then,” said Flora--“always having private\nconferences with papa! I do not think it is at all fair on the rest.”\n\n“Ethel is a very superior person,” said Margaret, with half a sigh.\n\nFlora might toss her head, but she attempted no denial in words. “And,”\n continued Margaret, “if papa does find her his best companion and friend\nwe ought to be glad of it.”\n\n“I do not call it just,” said Flora.\n\n“I do not think it can be helped,” said Margaret: “the best must be\npreferred.\n\n“As to that, Ethel is often very ridiculous and silly.”\n\n“She is improving every day; and you know dear mamma always thought her\nthe finest character amongst us.”\n\n“Then you are ready to be left out, and have your third sister always\nput before you?”\n\n“No, Flora, that is not the case. Neither she nor papa would ever be\nunfair; but, as she would say herself, what they can’t help, they can’t\nhelp; and, as she grows older, she must surpass me more and more.”\n\n“And you like it?”\n\n“I like it--when--when I think of papa, and of his dear, noble Ethel. I\ndo like it, when I am not selfish.”\n\nMargaret turned away her head, but presently looked up again.\n\n“Only, Flora,” she said, “pray do not say one word of this, on any\naccount, to Ethel. She is so happy with papa, and I would not for\nanything have her think I feel neglected, or had any jealousy.”\n\n“Ah,” thought Flora, “you can give up sweetly, but you have Alan to fall\nback upon. Now I, who certainly have the best right, and a great deal\nmore practical sense--”\n\nFlora took Margaret’s advice, and did not reproach Ethel, for a little\nreflection convinced her that she should make a silly figure in so\ndoing, and she did not like altercations.\n\nIt was the same evening that Norman came in from school with his hands\nfull of papers, and, with one voice, his father and Ethel exclaimed,\n“You have them?”\n\n“Yes;” and he gave the letter to his father, while Blanche, who had a\nvery inquisitive pair of eyes, began to read from a paper he placed on\nthe table.\n\n“‘Norman Walter, son of Richard and Margaret May, High Street, Doctor of\nMedicine, December 21st, 18--. Thomas Ramsden.’”\n\n“What is that for, Norman?” and, as he did not attend, she called Mary\nto share her speculations, and spell out the words.\n\n“Ha!” cried Dr. May, “this is capital! The old doctor seems not to know\nhow to say enough for you. Have you read it?”\n\n“No, he only told me he had said something in my favour, and wished me\nall success.”\n\n“Success!” cried Mary. “Oh, Norman, you are not going to sea too?”\n\n“No, no!” interposed Blanche knowingly--“he is going to be married.\nI heard nurse wish her brother success when he was going to marry the\nwasherwoman with a red face.”\n\n“No,” said Mary, “people never are married till they are twenty.”\n\n“But I tell you,” persisted Blanche, “people always write like this, in\na great book in church, when they are married. I know, for we always go\ninto church with Lucy and nurse when there is a wedding.”\n\n“Well, Norman, I wish you success with the bride you are to court,” said\nDr. May, much diverted with the young ladies’ conjectures.\n\n“But is it really?” said Mary, making her eyes as round as full moons.\n\n“Is it really?” repeated Blanche. “Oh, dear! is Norman going to be\nmarried? I wish it was to be Meta Rivers, for then I could always ride\nher dear little white pony.”\n\n“Tell them,” whispered Norman, a good deal out of countenance, as he\nleaned over Ethel, and quitted the room.\n\nEthel cried, “Now then!” and looked at her father, while Blanche and\nMary reiterated inquiries--marriage, and going to sea, being the only\nevents that, in their imagination, the world could furnish. Going to\ntry for a Balliol scholarship! It was a sad falling off, even if they\nunderstood what it meant. The doctor’s explanations to Margaret had a\ntone of apology for having kept her in ignorance, and Flora said few\nwords, but felt herself injured; she had nearly gone to Mrs. Hoxton that\nafternoon, and how strange it would have been if anything had been said\nto her of her own brother’s projects, when she was in ignorance.\n\nEthel slipped away to her brother, who was in his own room, surrounded\nwith books, flushed and anxious, and trying to glance over each subject\non which he felt himself weak.\n\n“I shall fail! I know I shall!” was his exclamation. “I wish I had never\nthought of it!”\n\n“What? did Dr. Hoxton think you not likely to succeed?” cried Ethel, in\nconsternation.\n\n“Oh! he said I was certain, but what is that? We Stoneborough men only\ncompare ourselves with each other. I shall break down to a certainty,\nand my father will be disappointed.”\n\n“You will do your best?”\n\n“I don’t know that. My best will all go away when it comes to the\npoint.”\n\n“Surely not. It did not go away last time you were examined, and why\nshould it now?”\n\n“I tell you, Ethel, you know nothing about it. I have not got up half\nwhat I meant to have done. Here, do take this book--try me whether I\nknow this properly.”\n\nSo they went on, Ethel doing her best to help and encourage, and Norman\nin an excited state of restless despair, which drove away half his\nsenses and recollection, and his ideas of the superior powers of public\nschoolboys magnifying every moment. They were summoned downstairs to\nprayers, but went up again at once, and more than an hour subsequently,\nwhen their father paid one of his domiciliary visits, there they still\nwere, with their Latin and Greek spread out, Norman trying to strengthen\nall doubtful points, but in a desperate desultory manner, that only\nconfused him more and more, till he was obliged to lay his head down on\nthe table, shut his eyes, and run his fingers through his hair, before\nhe could recollect the simplest matter; his renderings alternated with\ngroans, and, cold as was the room, his cheeks and brow were flushed and\nburning.\n\nThe doctor checked all this, by saying, gravely and sternly, “This is\nnot right, Norman. Where are all your resolutions?”\n\n“I shall never do it. I ought never to have thought of it! I shall never\nsucceed!”\n\n“What if you do not?” said Dr. May, laying his hand on his shoulder.\n\n“What? why, Tom’s chance lost--you will all be mortified,” said Norman,\nhesitating in some confusion.\n\n“I will take care of Tom,” said Dr. May.\n\n“And he will have been foiled!” said Ethel\n\n“If he is?”\n\nThe boy and girl were both silent.\n\n“Are you striving for mere victory’s sake, Norman?” continued his\nfather.\n\n“I thought not,” murmured Norman.\n\n“Successful or not, you will have done your utmost for us. You would\nnot lose one jot of affection or esteem, and Tom shall not suffer. Is it\nworth this agony?”\n\n“No, it is foolish,” said Norman, with trembling voice, almost as if he\ncould have burst into tears. He was quite unnerved by the anxiety\nand toil with which he had overtasked himself, beyond his father’s\nknowledge.\n\n“Oh, papa!” pleaded Ethel, who could not bear to see him pained.\n\n“It is foolish,” continued Dr. May, who felt it was the moment for\nbracing severity. “It is rendering you unmanly. It is wrong.”\n\nAgain Ethel made an exclamation of entreaty.\n\n“It is wrong, I know,” repeated Norman; “but you don’t know what it is\nto get into the spirit of the thing.”\n\n“Do you think I do not?” said the doctor; “I can tell exactly what you\nfeel now. If I had not been an idle dog, I should have gone through it\nall many more times.”\n\n“What shall I do?” asked Norman, in a worn-out voice.\n\n“Put all this out of your mind, sleep quietly, and don’t open another\nbook.”\n\nNorman moved his head, as if sleep were beyond his power.\n\n“I will read you something to calm your tone,” said Dr. May, and he took\nup a Prayer-book. “‘Know ye not, that they which run in a race, run all,\nbut one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain. And every man\nthat striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do\nit to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.’ And, Norman,\nthat is not the struggle where the race is not to the swift, nor the\nbattle to the strong; nor the contest, where the conqueror only wins\nvanity and vexation of spirit.”\n\nNorman had cast down his eyes, and hardly made answer, but the words\nhad evidently taken effect. The doctor only further bade him good-night,\nwith a whispered blessing, and, taking Ethel by the hand, drew her away.\nWhen they met the next morning, the excitement had passed from Norman’s\nmanner, but he looked dejected and resigned. He had made up his mind\nto lose, and was not grateful for good wishes; he ought never to have\nthought, he said, of competing with men from public schools, and he knew\nhis return of love of vain-glory deserved that he should fail. However,\nhe was now calm enough not to be likely to do himself injustice by\nnervousness, and Margaret hid hopes that Richard’s steady equable mind\nwould have a salutary influence. So, commending Tom’s lessons to Ethel,\nand hearing, but not marking, countless messages to Richard, he set\nforth upon his emprise, while his anxiety seemed to remain as a legacy\nfor those at home.\n\nPoor Dr. May confessed that his practice by no means agreed with his\nprecept, for he could think of nothing else, and was almost as bad as\nNorman, in his certainty that the boy would fail from mere nervousness.\nMargaret was the better companion for him now, attaching less intensity\nof interest to Norman’s success than did Ethel; she was the more able to\ncompose him, and cheer his hopes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\n\n     Weary soul, and burdened sore,\n       Labouring with thy secret load,\n     Fear not all thy griefs to pour\n       In this heart, love’s true abode.\n                                   Lyra Innocentium.\n\n\nTea had just been brought in on the eighth evening from Norman’s\ndeparture, when there was a ring at the bell. There was a start, and\nlook of expectation. “Only a patient,” said the doctor; but it surely\nwas not for that reason that he rose with so much alacrity and opened\nthe door, nor was “Well, old fellow?” the greeting for his patients--so\neverybody sprang after him, and beheld something tall taking off a coat,\nwhile a voice said, “I have got it.”\n\nThe mass of children rushed back to Margaret, screaming, “He has got\nit!” and then Aubrey trotted out into the hall again to see what Norman\nhad got.\n\n“A happy face at least,” said Margaret, as he came to her. And that was\nnot peculiar to Norman. The radiance had shone out upon every one\nin that moment, and it was one buzz of happy exclamation, query, and\nanswer--the only tone of regret when Mary spoke of Harry, and all\nat once took up the strain--how glad poor Harry would be. As to the\nexamination, that had been much less difficult than Norman had expected;\nin fact, he said, it was lucky for him that the very subjects had been\nchosen in which he was most up--luck which, as the doctor could not help\nobserving, generally did attend Norman. And Norman had been so happy\nwith Richard; the kind, wise elder brother had done exactly what was\nbest for him in soothing his anxiety, and had fully shared his feelings,\nand exulted in his success. Margaret had a most triumphant letter,\ndwelling on the abilities of the candidates whom Norman had outstripped,\nand the idea that every one had conceived of his talent. “Indeed,” wrote\nRichard, “I fancy the men had never believed that I could have a clever\nbrother. I am glad they have seen what Norman can do.”\n\nMargaret could not help reading this aloud, and it made Norman blush\nwith the compunction that Richard’s unselfish pride in him always\nexcited. He had much to tell of his ecstasy with Oxford. Stoneborough\nMinster had been a training in appreciation of its hoary beauty, but the\nessentially prosaic Richard had never prepared him for the impression\nthat the reverend old university made on him, and he was already, heart\nand soul, one of her most loyal and loving sons, speaking of his college\nand of the whole university as one who had a right of property in them,\nand looking, all the time, not elated, but contented, as if he had found\nhis sphere and was satisfied. He had seen Cheviot, too, and had been\nvery happy in the renewed friendship; and had been claimed as a cousin\nby a Balliol man, a certain Norman Ogilvie, a name well known among the\nMays. “And how has Tom been getting on?” he asked, when he returned to\nhome affairs.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know,” said Ethel. “He will not have my help.”\n\n“Not let you help him!” exclaimed Norman.\n\n“No. He says he wants no girls,” said Ethel, laughing.\n\n“Foolish fellow!” said Norman. “I wonder what sort of work he has made!”\n\n“Very funny, I should think,” said Ethel, “judging by the verses I could\nsee.”\n\nThe little, pale, rough-haired Tom, in his perpetual coating of dust,\nsoftly crept into the room, as if he only wanted to elude observation;\nbut Mary and Blanche were at once vociferating their news in his ears,\nthough with little encouragement--he only shook them off abruptly, and\nwould not answer when they required him to be glad.\n\nNorman stretched out his arm, intercepting him as he was making for his\nhiding-place behind Dr. May’s arm-chair.\n\n“Come, August, how have things gone on?”\n\n“Oh! I don’t know.”\n\n“What’s your place?”\n\n“Thirteenth!” muttered Tom in his throat, and well he might, for two\nor three voices cried out that was too bad, and that it was all his own\nfault, for not accepting Ethel’s help. He took little heed, but crept to\nhis corner without another word, and Mary knew she should be thumped if\nshe should torment him there.\n\nNorman left him alone, but the coldness of the little brother for whom\nhe had worked gave a greater chill to his pleasure than he could have\nsupposed possible. He would rather have had some cordiality on Tom’s\npart, than all the congratulations that met him the next day.\n\nHe could not rest contented while Tom continued to shrink from him, and\nhe was the more uneasy when, on Saturday morning, no calls from Mary\navailed to find the little boy, and bring him to the usual reading and\nCatechism.\n\nMargaret decided that they must begin without him, and poor Mary’s verse\nwas read, in consequence, with a most dolorous tone. As soon as the\nbooks were shut, she ran off, and a few words passed among the elder\nones about the truant--Flora opining that the Andersons had led him\naway; Ethel suggesting that his gloom must arise from his not being\nwell; and Margaret looking wistfully at Norman, and saying she feared\nthey had judged much amiss last spring. Norman heard in silence, and\nwalked thoughtfully into the garden. Presently he caught Mary’s voice in\nexpostulation: “How could you not come to read?”\n\n“Girls’ work!” growled another voice, out of sight.\n\n“But Norman, and Richard, and Harry, always come to the reading.\nEverybody ought.”\n\nNorman, who was going round the shrubs that concealed the speakers from\nhim, here lost their voices, but, as he emerged in front of the old\ntool-house, he heard a little scream from Mary, and, at the same moment,\nshe darted back, and fell over a heap of cabbage-stumps in front of the\nold tool-house. It was no small surprise to her to be raised by him, and\ntenderly asked whether she were hurt. She was not hurt, but she could\nnot speak without crying, and when Norman begged to hear what was the\nmatter, and where Tom was, she would only plead for him--that he did not\nintend to hurt her, and that she had been teasing him. What had he done\nto frighten her? Oh! he had only run at her with a hoe, because she was\ntroublesome; she did not mind it, and Norman must not--and she clung\nto him as if to keep him back, while he pursued his researches in the\ntool-house, where, nearly concealed by a great bushel-basket, lurked\nMaster Thomas, crouching down, with a volume of Gil Blas in his hand.\n\n“You here, Tom! What have you hidden yourself here for? What can make\nyou so savage to Mary?”\n\n“She should not bother me,” said Tom sulkily.\n\nNorman sent Mary away, pacifying her by promises that he would not\nrevenge her quarrel upon Tom, and then, turning the basket upside down,\nand perching himself astride on it, he began: “That is the kindest, most\nforgiving little sister I ever did see. What possesses you to treat her\nso ill?”\n\n“I wasn’t going to hurt her.”\n\n“But why drive her away? Why don’t you come to read?” No answer;\nand Norman, for a moment, felt as if Tom were really hopelessly\nill-conditioned and sullen, but he persevered in restraining his\ndesire to cuff the ill-humour out of him, and continued, “Come! there’s\nsomething wrong, and you will never be better till it is out. Tell\nme--don’t be afraid. Those fellows have been at you again?”\n\nHe took Tom by the arm to draw him nearer, but a cry and start of pain\nwere the result. “So they have licked you? Eh? What have they been\ndoing?”\n\n“They said they would spiflicate me if I told!” sighed Tom.\n\n“They shall never do anything to you;” and, by-and-by, a sobbing\nconfession was drawn forth, muttered at intervals, as low as if Tom\nexpected the strings of onions to hear and betray him to his foes.\nLooking on him as a deserter, these town-boys had taken advantage of his\nbrother’s absence to heap on him every misery they could inflict. There\nhad been a wager between Edward Anderson and Sam Axworthy as to what\nTom could be made to do, and his personal timidity made him a miserable\nvictim, not merely beaten and bruised, but forced to transgress every\nrule of right and wrong that had been enforced on his conscience.\nOn Sunday, they had profited by the absence of their dux to have a\njollification at a little public-house, not far from the playing-fields;\nand here had Tom been dragged in, forced to partake with them, and\nfrightened with threats that he had treated them all, and was liable\nto pay the whole bill, which, of course, he firmly believed, as well\nas that he should be at least half murdered if he gave his father any\nsuspicion that the whole had not been consumed by himself. Now, though\npoor Tom’s conscience had lost many scruples during the last spring,\nthe offence, into which he had been forced, was too heinous to a child\nbrought up as he had been to be palliated even in his own eyes. The\nprofanation of Sunday, and the carousal in a public-house, had combined\nto fill him with a sense of shame and degradation, which was the real\ncause that he felt himself unworthy to come and read with his sisters.\nHis grief and misery were extreme, and Norman’s indignation was such\nas could find no utterance. He sat silent, quivering with anger, and\nclenching his fingers over the handle of the hoe.\n\n“I knew it!” sighed Tom. “None of you will ever speak to me again!”\n\n“You! Why, August, man, I have better hopes of you than ever. You are\nmore really sorry now than ever you were before.”\n\n“I had never been at the Green Man before,” said poor Tom, feeling his\nfuture life stained.\n\n“You never will again!”\n\n“When you are gone--” and the poor victim’s voice died away.\n\n“Tom, you will not stay after me. It is settled that when I go to\nBalliol, you leave Stoneborough, and go to Mr. Wilmot as pupil. Those\nscamps shall never have you in their clutches again.”\n\nIt did not produce the ecstasy Norman had expected. The boy still sat\non the ground, staring at his brother, as if the good news hardly\npenetrated the gloom; and, after a disappointing silence, recurred to\nthe most immediate cause of distress: “Eight shillings and tenpence\nhalfpenny! Norman, if you would only lend it to me, you shall have all\nmy tin till I have made it up--sixpence a week, and half-a-crown on New\nYear’s Day.”\n\n“I am not going to pay Mr. Axworthy’s reckoning,” said Norman, rather\nangrily. “You will never be better till you have told my father the\nwhole.”\n\n“Do you think they will send in the bill to my father?” asked Tom, in\nalarm.\n\n“No, indeed! that is the last thing they will do,” said Norman; “but I\nwould not have you come to him only for such a sneaking reason.”\n\n“But the girls would hear it. Oh, if I thought Mary and Margaret would\never hear it--Norman, I can’t--”\n\nNorman assured him that there was not the slightest reason that these\npassages should ever come to the knowledge of his sisters. Tom was\nexcessively afraid of his father, but he could not well be more wretched\nthan he was already; and he was brought to assent when Norman showed\nhim that he had never been happy since the affair of the blotting-paper,\nwhen his father’s looks and tones had become objects of dread to his\nguilty conscience. Was not the only means of recovering a place in\npapa’s esteem to treat him with confidence?\n\nTom answered not, and would only shudder when his brother took upon him\nto declare that free confession would gain pardon even for the doings at\nthe Green Man.\n\nTom had grown stupefied and passive, and his sole dependence was on\nNorman, so, at last, he made no opposition when his brother offered to\nconduct him to his father and speak for him. The danger now was that\nDr. May should not be forthcoming, and the elder brother was as much\nrelieved, as the younger was dismayed, to see, through the drawing-room\nwindow, that he was standing beside Margaret.\n\n“Papa, can you come and speak to me,” said Norman, “at the door?”\n\n“Coming! What now?” said the doctor, entering the hall. “What, Tom, my\nboy, what is it?” as he saw the poor child, white, cold, almost sick\nwith apprehension, with every pulse throbbing, and looking positively\nill. He took the chilly, damp hand, which shook nervously, and would\nfain have withdrawn itself.\n\n“Come, my dear, let us see what is amiss;” and before Tom knew what he\nwas doing, he had seated him on his knee, in the arm-chair in the study,\nand was feeling his pulse. “There, rest your head! Has it not been\naching all day?”\n\n“I do not think he is ill,” said Norman; “but there is something he\nthinks I had better tell you.”\n\nTom would fain have been on his feet, yet the support of that shoulder\nwas inexpressibly comfortable to his aching temples, and he could not\nbut wait for the shock of being roughly shaken and put down. So, as his\nbrother related what had occurred, he crouched and trembled more and\nmore on his father’s breast, till, to his surprise, he found the other\narm passed round him in support, drawing him more tenderly close.\n\n“My poor little fellow!” said Dr. May, trying to look into the drooping\nface, “I grieve to have exposed you to such usage as this! I little\nthought it of Stoneborough fellows!”\n\n“He is very sorry,” said Norman, much distressed by the condition of the\nculprit.\n\n“I see it--I see it plainly,” said Dr. May. “Tommy, my boy, why should\nyou tremble when you are with me?”\n\n“He has been in great dread of your being displeased.”\n\n“My boy, do you not know how I forgive you?” Tom clung round his neck,\nas if to steady himself.\n\n“Oh, papa! I thought you would never--”\n\n“Nay, you need never have thought so, my boy! What have I done that you\nshould fear me?”\n\nTom did not speak, but nestled up to him with more confidence. “There!\nthat’s better! Poor child! what he must have suffered! He was not fit\nfor the place! I had thought him looking ill. Little did I guess the\ncause.”\n\n“He says his head has ached ever since Sunday,” said Norman; “and I\nbelieve he has hardly eaten or slept properly since.”\n\n“He shall never be under their power again! Thanks to you, Norman. Do\nyou hear that, Tommy?”\n\nThe answer was hardly audible. The little boy was already almost asleep,\nworn out with all he had undergone. Norman began to clear the sofa, that\nthey might lay him down, but his father would not hear of disturbing\nhim, and, sending Norman away, sat still for more than an hour, until\nthe child slowly awoke, and scarcely recalling what had happened, stood\nup between his father’s knees, rubbing his eyes, and looking bewildered.\n\n“You are better now, my boy?”\n\n“I thought you would be very angry,” slowly murmured Tom, as the past\nreturned on him.\n\n“Never, while you are sorry for your faults, and own them freely.”\n\n“I’m glad I did,” said the boy, still half asleep. “I did not know you\nwould be so kind.”\n\n“Ah! Tom, I fear it was as much my fault as yours that you did not know\nit. But, my dear, there is a pardon that can give you better peace than\nmine.”\n\n“I think,” muttered Tom, looking down--“I think I could say my prayers\nagain now, if--”\n\n“If what, my dear?”\n\n“If you would help me, as mamma used--”\n\nThere could be but one response to this speech.\n\nTom was still giddy and unwell, his whole frame affected by the troubles\nof the last week, and Dr. May arranged him on the sofa, and desired\nhim to be quiet, offering to send Mary to be his companion. Tom was\nlanguidly pleased, but renewed his entreaty, that his confession\nmight be a secret from his sisters. Dr. May promised, and Mary, quite\nsatisfied at being taken into favour, asked no questions, but spent\nthe rest of the morning in playing at draughts with him, and in having\ninflicted on her the history of the Bloody Fire King’s Ghost--a work\nof Tom’s imagination, which he was wont to extemporise, to the extreme\nterror of much enduring Mary.\n\nWhen Dr. May had called Mary, he next summoned Norman, who found him in\nthe hall, putting on his hat, and looking very stern and determined.\n\n“Norman!” said he hastily, “don’t say a word--it must be done--Hoxton\nmust hear of this.”\n\nNorman’s face expressed utter consternation.\n\n“It is not your doing. It is no concern of yours,” said Dr. May,\nwalking impetuously into the garden. “I find my boy ill, broken down,\nshattered--it is the usage of this crew of fellows--what right have I to\nconceal it--leave other people’s sons to be so served?”\n\n“I believe they did so to Tom out of ill-will to me,” said Norman, “and\nbecause they thought he had ratted.”\n\n“Hush! don’t argue against it,” said Dr. May, almost petulantly. “I have\nstood a great deal to oblige you, but I cannot stand this. When it is\na matter of corruption, base cruelty--no, Norman, it is not right--not\nanother word!”\n\nNorman’s words had not been many, but he felt a conviction that, in\nspite of the dismay and pain to himself, Dr. May ought to meet with\nsubmission to his judgment, and he acquiesced by silence.\n\n“Don’t you see,” continued the doctor, “if they act thus, when your back\nis turned, what is to happen next half? ‘Tis not for Tom’s sake, but how\ncould we justify it to ourselves, to expose other boys to this usage?”\n\n“Yes,” said Norman, not without a sigh. “I suppose it must be.”\n\n“That is right,” said Dr. May, as if much relieved. “I knew you must see\nit in that light. I do not mean to abuse your confidence.”\n\n“No, indeed,” answered Norman warmly.\n\n“But you see yourself, that where the welfare of so many is at stake,\nit would be wickedness--yes, wickedness--to be silent. Could I see\nthat little fellow prostrated, trembling in my arms, and think of those\nscamps inflicting the same on other helpless children--away from their\nhomes!”\n\n“I see, I see!” said Norman, carried along by the indignation and\ntenderness that agitated his father’s voice in his vehemence--“it is the\nonly thing to be done.”\n\n“It would be sharing the guilt to hide it,” said Dr. May.\n\n“Very well,” said Norman, still reluctantly. “What do you wish me to do?\nYou see, as dux, I know nothing about it. It happened while I was away.”\n\n“True, true,” said his father. “You have learned it as brother, not as\nsenior boy. Yes, we had better have you out of the matter. It is I who\ncomplain of their usage of my son.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Norman, with gratitude.\n\n“You have not told me the names of these fellows! No, I had best not\nknow them.”\n\n“I think it might make a difference,” hesitated Norman.\n\n“No, no, I will not hear them. It ought to make none. The fact is the\nsame, be they who they may.”\n\nThe doctor let himself out at the garden gate, and strode off at a rapid\npace, conscious perhaps, in secret, that if he did not at once yield\nto the impulse of resentment, good nature would overpower the sense of\njustice. His son returned to the house with a heavy sigh, yet honouring\nthe generosity that had respected his scruples, when merely his own\nworldly loss was involved, but set them aside when the good of others\nwas concerned. By-and-by Dr. May reappeared. The head-master had been\nthoroughly roused to anger, and had begged at once to examine May\njunior, for whom his father was now come.\n\nTom was quite unprepared for such formidable consequences of his\nconfession, and began by piteous tears and sobs, and when these had,\nwith some difficulty, been pacified, he proved to be really so unwell\nand exhausted, that his father could not take him to Minster Street, and\nwas obliged to leave him to his brother’s keeping, while he returned to\nthe school.\n\nUpon this, Dr. Hoxton came himself, and the sisters were extremely\nexcited and alarmed by the intelligence that he was in the study with\npapa and Tom.\n\nThen away went the gentlemen; and Mary was again called to comfort Tom,\nwho, broken down into the mere longing for sympathy, sobbed out all his\ntroubles to her, while her eyes expanded more and more in horror, and\nher soft heart giving way, she cried quite as pitifully, and a great\ndeal more loudly; and so the other sisters learned the whole, and\nMargaret was ready for her father when he came in, in the evening,\nharassed and sorrowful. His anger was all gone now, and he was\nexcessively grieved at finding that the ringleaders, Samuel Axworthy and\nEdward Anderson, could, in Dr. Hoxton’s opinion, receive no sentence but\nexpulsion, which was to be pronounced on them on Monday.\n\nSam Axworthy was the son of a low, uneducated man, and his best chance\nhad been the going to this school; but he was of a surly, obstinate\ntemper, and showed so little compunction, that even such superabundant\nkindness as Dr. May’s could not find compassion for him; especially\nsince it had appeared that Tom had been by no means the only victim, and\nthat he had often been the promoter of the like malpractices, which many\nboys were relieved to be forced to expose.\n\nFor Edward Anderson, however, or rather for his mother, Dr. May was very\nsorry, and had even interceded for his pardon; but Dr. Hoxton, though\nslow to be roused, was far less placable than the other doctor, and\nwould not hear of anything but the most rigorous justice.\n\n“Poor Mrs. Anderson, with her pride in her children!” Flora spoke it\nwith a shade of contemptuous pity, but it made her father groan.\n\n“I shall never be able to look in her face again! I shall never see that\nboy without feeling that I have ruined him!”\n\n“He needed nobody to do that for him,” said Flora.\n\n“With every disadvantage!” continued Dr. May; “unable even to remember\nhis father! Why could I not be more patient and forbearing?”\n\n“Oh, papa!” was the general cry--Norman’s voice giving decision to the\nsisters’ exclamation.\n\n“Perhaps,” said Margaret, “the shock may be the best thing for him.”\n\n“Right, Margaret,” said her father. “Sometimes such a thing is the first\nthat shows what a course of evil really is.”\n\n“They are an affectionate family too,” said Margaret, “and his mother’s\ngrief may have an effect on him.”\n\n“If she does not treat him as an injured hero,” said Flora; “besides, I\nsee no reason for regret. These are but two, and the school is not to be\nsacrificed to them.”\n\n“Yes,” said Norman; “I believe that Ashe will be able to keep much\nbetter order without Axworthy. It is much better as it is, but Harry\nwill be very sorry to hear it, and I wish this half was over.”\n\nPoor Mrs. Anderson! her shower of notes rent the heart of the one\ndoctor, but were tossed carelessly aside by the other. On that Sunday,\nNorman held various conversations with his probable successor, Ashe,\na gentle, well-disposed boy, hitherto in much dread of the post of\nauthority, but owning that, in Axworthy’s absence, the task would be\ncomparatively easy, and that Anderson would probably originate far less\nmischief.\n\nEdward Anderson himself fell in Norman’s way in the street, and was\nshrinking aside, when a word, of not unfriendly greeting, caused him to\nquicken his steps, and say, hesitatingly, “I say, how is August?”\n\n“Better, thank you; he will be all right in a day or two.”\n\n“I say, we would not have bullied him so, if he had not been in such a\nfright at nothing.”\n\n“I dare say not.”\n\n“I did not mean it all, but that sort of thing makes a fellow go on,”\n continued Edward, hanging down his head, very sorrowful and downcast.\n\n“If it had only been fair bullying; but to take him to that place--to\nteach him falsehood--” said Norman.\n\nEdward’s eyes were full of tears; he almost owned the whole. He had\nnot thought of such things, and then Axworthy--It was more evident from\nmanner than words that the boy did repent and was greatly overcome,\nboth by his own disgrace and his mother’s distress, wishing earnestly to\nredeem his character, and declaring, from the bottom of his heart, that\nhe would avoid his former offences. He was emboldened at last to say,\nwith hesitation, “Could not you speak to Dr. Hoxton for me?”\n\n“My father has said all he could in your behalf.”\n\nEdward’s eye glanced towards Norman in wonder, as he recollected that\nthe Mays must know that a word from him would have saved Norman\nfrom unjust punishment and the loss of the scholarship, and he said,\n“Good-night,” and turned aside to his own home, with a heavy sigh.\n\nNorman took another turn, looked up at the sky, twisted his hands\ntogether in perplexity, mumbled something about hating to do a thing\nwhen it was all for no use, and then marched off towards Minster Street,\nwith a pace like his father’s the day before.\n\nWhen he came forth again from Dr. Hoxton’s study, he did not believe\nthat his intercession had produced the least effect, and there was a\nsense of vexation at the position which he had assumed. He went home,\nand said nothing on the subject; but when, on Monday, the school was\nassembled, and the judgment announced, it was Axworthy alone whose\nfriends had been advised to remove him.\n\nAnderson received a severe punishment, as did all those who had shared\nin the revel at the Green Man. Even Tom, and another little boy, who had\nbeen likewise drawn in, were obliged to stay within narrow bounds, and\nto learn heavy impositions; and a stern reprimand and exhortation were\ngiven to the school collectively. Anderson, who had seen from the window\nthat turn towards Minster Street, drew his own conclusions, and was not\ninsensible to the generosity that had surpassed his hopes, though to his\nfaltering attempt at thanks, Norman replied that he did not believe\nit was owing to him, and never exposed himself to Flora’s wonder by\ndeclaring at home what he had done.\n\nSo the last weeks of the half-year passed away with the boys in a\nsubdued, but hopeful manner, and the reformation, under Norman’s\nauspices, progressed so well, that Ashe might fairly expect to reap the\nbenefit of the discipline, established at so much cost.\n\nMr. Wilmot had looked on, and given his help, but he was preparing to\nleave Stoneborough, and there was great concern at the parting with such\na friend. Ethel, especially, mourned the loss to Cocksmoor, and, for\nthough hers had been the executive part, his had been the head, and he\nwas almost equally grieved to go from the newly-begun work.\n\nMargaret lamented the loss of her kind counsellor, and the ready hearer\nof her anxieties for the children. Writing could ill supply the place of\ntheir conversations, and she feared likewise that her father would\nfeel the want of his companionship. The promise of visits, and\nthe intercourse kept up by Tom’s passing to and fro, was the best\nconsolation.\n\nPoor Margaret had begun to flag, both in strength and spirits, as winter\napproached, but there came a revival in the shape of “Ship Letters!”\n Alan wrote cheerfully and graphically, with excellent accounts of Harry,\nwho, on his side, sent very joyous and characteristic despatches, only\nwishing that he could present Mary with all the monkeys and parrots he\nhad seen at Rio, as well as the little ruby-crested humming-birds, that\nalways reminded him of Miss Rivers.\n\nWith the Christmas holidays, Hector Ernescliffe came from Eton, as to a\nhome, and was received by Margaret as a sort of especial charge. It was\npretty to see how he turned to her as something peculiarly his own,\nand would sit on a footstool by her, letting himself be drawn into\nconfidence, and dwelling on his brother’s past doings, and on future\nschemes for Maplewood. For the rest, he restored to the house the\natmosphere of boy, which had somewhat departed with Harry. Mary, who had\nbegun to be tamed down, ran more wild than ever, to the utter despair\nof Miss Winter; and Tom, now that his connection with the Whichcote\nfoundation was over, and he was no more cowed by the sight of his\ntyrants, came out in a new light. He put on his boy-nature, rioted\nlike the rest, acquired colour in his cheeks, divested his jacket of\nperpetual dust, had his hair cut, brushed up a crest on his head, and\nran about no longer a little abject, but a merry lad.\n\nEthel said it was a change from Horrid-locks to Harfagre; Margaret said\nlittle, but, like her father, she blessed Norman in her heart for having\ngiven back the boy to his father’s confidence, and saved him so far from\nthe terrible course of deceit and corruption. She could not much take\nto heart the mad exploits of the so-called boys, even though she spent\nthree hours in heart-beatings on Christmas Eve, when Hector, Mary, Tom,\nBlanche, and the dog Toby, were lost the whole day. However, they did\ncome back at six o’clock, having been deluded by an old myth of George\nLarkins, into starting for a common, three miles beyond Cocksmoor, in\nsearch of mistletoe, with scarlet berries, and yellow holly, with\nleaves like a porcupine! Failing these wonders, they had been contenting\nthemselves with scarlet holly, in the Drydale plantations, when a rough\nvoice exclaimed, “Who gave you leave to take that?” whereupon Tom had\nplunged into a thicket, and nearly “scratched out both his eyes”; but\nHector boldly standing his ground, with Blanche in his hand, the woodman\ndiscovered that here was the Miss Mary, of whom his little girls talked\nso much, thereupon cut down the choicest boughs, and promised to leave\na full supply at Dr. May’s. Margaret could have been angry at the taking\nthe young ladies on so mad a scheme, but then Mary was so happy, and as\nto Hector, how scold him, when he had lifted Blanche over every\nditch, and had carried her home one mile on his back, and another,\nqueen’s-cushion fashion, between him and Mary?\n\nFlora, meanwhile, went her own way. The desire of compensating for\nwhat had passed with Norman, led to great civilities from Dr. and Mrs.\nHoxton, which nobody was at liberty to receive except Flora. Pretty,\ngraceful, and pleasing, she was a valuable companion to a gentle little,\ninane lady, with more time and money than she knew what to do with; and\nMrs. Hoxton, who was of a superior grade to the Stoneborough ladies in\ngeneral, was such a chaperon as Flora was glad to secure. Dr. May’s old\nloyal feelings could not help regarding her notice of his daughter as a\nfavour and kindness, and Margaret could find no tangible objections, nor\nany precedent from her mother’s conduct, even had any one had the power\nto interfere with one so quiet, reasonable, and determined as Flora.\n\nSo the intimacy became closer and closer, and as the winter passed on,\nFlora gradually became established as the dear friend and assistant,\nwithout whom Mrs. Hoxton could give no party. Further, Flora took the\ngrand step of setting up a copper-plate and cards of “Miss Flora May,”\n went out frequently on morning calls with Mrs. Hoxton and her bay\nhorses, and when Dr. May refused his share of invitations to dinner with\nthe neighbours in the county, Flora generally found that she could go\nunder the Hoxtons’ guardianship.\n\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\n\n     Now have I then eke this condicion\n     That above all the flouris in the mede;\n     Then love I most these flouris white and rede,\n     Soche that men callin daisies in our town.\n     To them have I so great affection,\n     As I said erst, when comin is the Maie,\n     That in my bed there dawith me no daie\n     That I am up and walking in the mede,\n     To see this floure agenst the sunne sprede.--CHAUCER.\n\n\n“That is better!” said Margaret, contemplating a butterfly of the\npenwiper class, whose constitution her dexterous needle had been\nrendering less rickety than Blanche had left it.\n\nMargaret still lay on the sofa, and her complexion had assumed the dead\nwhite of habitual ill-health. There was more languor of manner, and her\ncountenance, when at rest, and not under the eye of her father, had\na sadness of expression, as if any hopes that she might once have\nentertained were fading away. The years of Alan Ernescliffe’s absence\nthat had elapsed had rather taken from her powers than added to them.\nNevertheless, the habit of cheerfulness and sympathy had not deserted\nher, and it was with a somewhat amused glance that she turned towards\nEthel, as she heard her answer by a sigh.\n\nThese years had dealt more kindly with Etheldred’s outward appearance.\nThey had rounded her angles, softened her features, and tinged\nher cheeks with a touch of red, that took off from the surrounding\nsallowness. She held herself better, had learned to keep her hair in\norder, and the more womanly dress, plain though it was, improved her\nfigure more than could have been hoped in the days of her lank,\ngawky girlhood. No one could call her pretty, but her countenance\nhad something more than ever pleasing in the animated and thoughtful\nexpression on those marked features. She was sitting near the window,\nwith a book, a dictionary, and pencil, as she replied to Margaret, with\nthe sigh that made her sister smile.\n\n“Poor Ethel! I condole with you.”\n\n“And I wonder at you!” said Ethel, “especially as Flora and Mrs. Hoxton\nsay it is all for your sake;” then, nettled by Margaret’s laugh, “Such a\nnice occupation for her, poor thing, as if you were Mrs. Hoxton, and had\nno resource but fancy-work.”\n\n“You know I am base enough to be so amused,” said Margaret; “but,\nseriously, Ethel dear, I cannot bear to see you so much hurt by it. I\ndid not know you were really grieved.”\n\n“Grieved! I am ashamed--sickened!” cried Ethel vehemently. “Poor\nCocksmoor! As soon as anything is done there, Flora must needs go\nabout implying that we have set some grand work in hand, and want only\nmeans--”\n\n“Stop, Ethel; Flora does not boast.”\n\n“No, she does not boast. I wish she did! That would be straightforward\nand simple; but she has too good taste for that--so she does worse--she\ntells a little, and makes that go a long way, as if she were keeping\nback a great deal! You don’t know how furious it makes me!”\n\n“Ethel!”\n\n“So,” said Ethel, disregarding, “she stirs up all Stoneborough to hear\nwhat the Miss Mays are doing at Cocksmoor. So the Ladies’ Committee must\nneeds have their finger in! Much they cared for the place when it was\nwild and neglected! But they go to inspect Cherry and her school--Mrs.\nLedwich and all--and, back they come, shocked--no system, no order, the\nmistress untrained, the school too small, with no apparatus! They all\nrun about in despair, as if we had ever asked them to help us. And so\nMrs. Hoxton, who cares for poor children no more than for puppy-dogs,\nbut who can’t live without useless work, and has filled her house as\nfull of it as it can hold, devises a bazaar--a field for her trumpery,\nand a show-off for all the young ladies; and Flora treats it like an\ninspiration! Off they trot, to the old Assembly Rooms. I trusted that\nthe smallness of them would have knocked it on the head; but, still\nworse, Flora’s talking of it makes Mr. Rivers think it our pet scheme;\nso, what does he do but offer his park, and so we are to have a\nregular fancy fair, and Cocksmoor School will be founded in vanity and\nfrivolity! But I believe you like it!”\n\n“I am not sure of my own feeling,” said Margaret. “It has been settled\nwithout our interposition, and I have never been able to talk it over\ncalmly with you. Papa does not seem to disapprove.”\n\n“No,” said Ethel. “He will only laugh, and say it will spare him a great\nmany of Mrs. Hoxton’s nervous attacks. He thinks of it nearly as I do,\nat the bottom, but I cannot get him to stop it, nor even to say he does\nnot wish Flora to sell.”\n\n“I did not understand that you really had such strong objections,” said\nMargaret. “I thought it was only as a piece of folly, and--”\n\n“And interference with my Cocksmoor?” said Ethel. “I had better own to\nwhat may be wrong personal feeling at first.”\n\n“I can hardly call it wrong,” said Margaret tenderly, “considering what\nCocksmoor is to you, and what the Ladies’ Committee is.”\n\n“Oh, Margaret, if the lawful authority--if a good clergyman would only\ncome, how willingly would I work under him! But Mrs. Ledwich and--it\nis like having all the Spaniards and savages spoiling Robinson Crusoe’s\ndesert island!”\n\n“It is not come to that yet,” said Margaret; “but about the fancy fair.\nWe all know that the school is very much wanted.”\n\n“Yes, but I hoped to wait in patience and perseverance, and do it at\nlast.”\n\n“All yourself?”\n\n“Now, Margaret! you know I was glad of Alan’s help.”\n\n“I should think so!” said Margaret. “You need not make a favour of\nthat!”\n\n“Yes, but, don’t you see, that came as almsgiving, in the way which\nbrings a blessing. We want nothing to make us give money and work to\nCocksmoor. We do all we can already; and I don’t want to get a fine bag\nor a ridiculous pincushion in exchange!”\n\n“Not you, but--”\n\n“Well, for the rest. If they like to offer their money, well and good,\nthe better for them; but why must they not give it to Cocksmoor--but for\nthat unnatural butterfly of Blanche’s, with black pins for horns, that\nthey will go and sell at an extortionate rate.”\n\n“The price will be given for Cocksmoor’s sake!”\n\n“Pooh! Margaret. Do you think it is for Cocksmoor’s sake that Lady\nLeonora Langdale and her fine daughter come down from London? Would Mrs.\nHoxton spend the time in making frocks for Cocksmoor children that\nshe does in cutting out paper, and stuffing glass bottles with it? Let\npeople be honest--alms, or pleasure, or vanity! let them say which they\nmean; but don’t make charity the excuse for the others; and, above all,\ndon’t make my poor Cocksmoor the victim of it.”\n\n“This is very severe,” said Margaret, pausing, almost confounded. “Do\nyou think no charity worth having but what is given on unmixed motives?\nWho, then, could give?”\n\n“Margaret--we see much evil arise in the best-planned institutions; nay,\nin what are not human. Don’t you think we ought to do our utmost to have\nno flaw in the foundation? Schools are not such perfect places that we\ncan build them without fear, and, if the means are to be raised by a\nbargain for amusement--if they are to come from frivolity instead of\nself-denial, I am afraid of them. I do not mean that Cocksmoor has not\nbeen the joy of my life, and of Mary’s, but that was not because we did\nit for pleasure.”\n\n“No!” said Margaret, sighing, “you found pleasure by the way. But why\ndid you not say all this to Flora?”\n\n“It is of no use to talk to Flora,” said Ethel; “she would say it was\nhigh-flown and visionary. Oh! she wants it for the bazaar’s own sake,\nand that is one reason why I hate it.”\n\n“Now, Ethel!”\n\n“I do believe it was very unfortunate for Flora that the Hoxtons took to\npatronising her, because Norman would not be patronised. Ever since\nit began, her mind has been full of visitings, and parties, and county\nfamilies, and she has left off the home usefulness she used to care\nabout.”\n\n“But you are old enough for that,” said Margaret. “It would be hard to\nkeep Flora at home, now that you can take her place, and do not care for\ngoing out. One of us must be the representative Miss May, you know, and\nkeep up the civilities; and you may think yourself lucky it is not you.”\n\n“If it was only that, I should not care, but I may as well tell you,\nMargaret, for it is a weight to me. It is not the mere pleasure in\ngaieties--Flora cares for them, in themselves, as little as I do--nor\nis it neighbourliness, as a duty to others, for, you may observe, she\nalways gets off any engagement to the Wards, or any of the town folk, to\nwhom it would be a gratification to have her--she either eludes them, or\nsends me. The thing is, that she is always trying to be with the great\npeople, the county set, and I don’t think that is the safe way of going\non.”\n\nMargaret mused sadly. “You frighten me, Ethel! I cannot say it is not\nso, and these are so like the latent faults that dear mamma’s letter\nspoke of--”\n\nEthel sat meditating, and at last said, “I wish I had not told you! I\ndon’t always believe it myself, and it is so unkind, and you will make\nyourself unhappy too. I ought not to have thought it of her! Think of\nher ever-ready kindness and helpfulness; her pretty courteous ways to\nthe very least; her obligingness and tact!”\n\n“Yes,” said Margaret, “she is one of the kindest people there is, and\nI am sure that she thought the gaining funds for Cocksmoor was the\nbest thing to be done, that you would be pleased, and a great deal of\npleasant occupation provided for us all.”\n\n“That is the bright side, the surface side,” said Ethel.\n\n“And not an untrue one,” said Margaret; “Meta will not be vain, and will\nwork the more happily for Cocksmoor’s sake. Mary and Blanche, poor Mrs.\nBoulder, and many good ladies who hitherto have not known how to help\nCocksmoor, will do so now with a good will, and though it is not what we\nshould have chosen, I think we had better take it in good part.”\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“Yes, indeed I do. If you go about with that dismal face and strong\ndisapproval, it will really seem as if it was the having your dominion\nmuddled with that you dislike. Besides, it is putting yourself forward\nto censure what is not absolutely wrong in itself, and that cannot be\ndesirable.”\n\n“No,” said Ethel, “but I cannot help being sorry for Cocksmoor. I\nthought patience would prepare the way, and the means be granted in good\ntime, without hastiness--only earnestness.”\n\n“You had made a picture for yourself,” said Margaret gently. “Yes, we\nall make pictures for ourselves, and we are the foremost figures in\nthem; but they are taken out of our hands, and we see others putting\nin rude touches, and spoiling our work, as it seems; but, by-and-by, we\nshall see that it is all guided.”\n\nEthel sighed. “Then having protested to my utmost against this concern,\nyou think I ought to be amiable about it.”\n\n“And to let poor Mary enjoy it. She would be so happy, if you would not\nbewilder her by your gloomy looks, and keep her to the hemming of your\nendless glazed calico bonnet strings.”\n\n“Poor old Mary! I thought that was by her own desire.”\n\n“Only her dutiful allegiance to you; and, as making pincushions is\nnearly her greatest delight, it is cruel to make her think it, in some\nmysterious way, wrong and displeasing to you.”\n\nEthel laughed, and said, “I did not think Mary was in such awe of me.\nI’ll set her free, then. But, Margaret, do you really think I ought to\ngive up my time to it?”\n\n“Could you not just let them have a few drawings, or a little bit of\nyour company work--just enough for you not to annoy every one, and seem\nto be testifying against them? You would not like to vex Meta.”\n\n“It will go hard, if I do not tell Meta my mind. I cannot bear to see\nher deluded.”\n\n“I don’t think she is,” said Margaret; “but she does not set her face\nagainst what others wish. As papa says of his dear little humming-bird,\nshe takes the honey, and leaves the poison.”\n\n“Yes; amid all that enjoyment, she is always choosing the good, and\nleaving the evil; always sacrificing something, and then being happy in\nthe sacrifice!”\n\n“No one would guess it was a sacrifice, it is so joyously done--least of\nall Meta herself.”\n\n“Her coming home from London was exactly a specimen of that\nsacrifice--and no sacrifice,” said Ethel.\n\n“What was that?” said Norman, who had come up to the window unobserved,\nand had been listening to their few last sentences.\n\n“Did not you hear of it? It was a sort of material turning away from\nvanity that made me respect the little rival Daisy, as much as I always\nadmired her.\n\n“Tell me,” said Norman. “When was it?”\n\n“Last spring. You know Mr. Rivers is always ill in London: indeed, papa\nsays it would be the death of him; but Lady Leonora Langdale thinks it\ndreadful that Meta should not go to all the gaieties; and last year,\nwhen Mrs. Larpent was gone, she insisted on her coming to stay with her\nfor the season. Now Meta thought it wrong to leave her father alone, and\nwanted not to have gone at all, but, to my surprise, Margaret advised\nher to yield, and go for some short fixed time.”\n\n“Yes,” said Margaret; “as all her elders thought it right, I did not\nthink we could advise her to refuse absolutely. Besides, it was a\npromise.”\n\n“She declared she would only stay three weeks, and the Langdales were\nsatisfied, thinking that, once in London, they should keep her. They\nlittle knew Meta, with her pretty ways of pretending that her resolution\nis only spoiled-child wilfulness. None of you quite trusted her, did\nyou, Margaret? Even papa was almost afraid, though he wanted her very\nmuch to be at home; for poor Mr. Rivers was so low and forlorn without\nher, though he would not let her know, because Lady Leonora had\npersuaded him to think it was all for her good.”\n\n“What did they do with her in London?” asked Norman.\n\n“They did their utmost,” said Ethel. “They made engagements for her, and\ntook her to parties and concerts--those she did enjoy very much and she\nhad lessons in drawing and music, but whenever she wanted to see any\nexhibitions, or do anything, they always said there was time to spare. I\nbelieve it was very charming, and she would have been very glad to stay,\nbut she never would promise, and she was always thinking of her positive\nduty at home. She seemed afterwards to think of her wishes to remain\nalmost as if they had been a sin; but she said--dear little Meta--that\nnothing had ever helped her so much as that she used to say to herself,\nwhenever she was going out, ‘I renounce the world.’ It came to a crisis\nat last, when Lady Leonora wanted her to be presented--the Drawing-Room\nwas after the end of her three weeks--and she held out against it;\nthough her aunt laughed at her, and treated her as if she was a silly,\nshy child. At last, what do you think Meta did? She went to her uncle,\nLord Cosham, and appealed to him to say whether there was the least\nnecessity for her to go to court.”\n\n“Then she gained the day?” said Norman.\n\n“He was delighted with that spirited, yet coaxing way of hers, and\nadmired her determination. He told papa so himself--for you must know,\nwhen he heard all Meta had to say, he called her a very good girl, and\nsaid he would take her home himself on the Saturday she had fixed, and\nspend Sunday at Abbotstoke. Oh! he was perfectly won by her sweet\nways. Was not it lucky? for before this Lady Leonora had written to Mr.\nRivers, and obtained from him a letter, which Meta had the next day,\ndesiring her to stay for the Drawing-Room. But Meta knew well enough how\nit was, and was not to be conquered that way; so she said she must go\nhome to entertain her uncle, and that if her papa really wished it, she\nwould return on Monday.”\n\n“Knowing well that Mr. Rivers would be only too glad to keep her.”\n\n“Just so. How happy they both did look, when they came in here on their\nway from the station where he had met her! How she danced in, and how\nshe sparkled with glee!” said Margaret, “and poor Mr. Rivers was quite\ntremulous with the joy of having her back, hardly able to keep from\nfondling her every minute, and coming again into the room after they had\ntaken leave, to tell me that his little girl had preferred her home, and\nher poor old father, to all the pleasures in London. Oh, I was so glad\nthey came! That was a sight that did one good! And then, I fancy Mr.\nRivers is a wee bit afraid of his brother-in-law, for he begged papa\nand Flora to come home and dine with them, but Flora was engaged to Mrs.\nHoxton.”\n\n“Ha! Flora!” said Norman, as if he rather enjoyed her losing something\nthrough her going to Mrs. Hoxton. “I suppose she would have given the\nworld to go!”\n\n“I was so sorry,” said Ethel; “but I had to go instead, and it was\ndelightful. Papa made great friends with Lord Cosham, while Mr. Rivers\nwent to sleep after dinner, and I had such a delightful wandering with\nMeta, listening to the nightingales, and hearing all about it. I never\nknew Meta so well before.”\n\n“And there was no more question of her going back?” said Norman.\n\n“No, indeed! She said, when her uncle asked in joke, on Monday morning,\nwhether she had packed up to return with him, Mr. Rivers was quite\nnervously alarmed the first moment, lest she should intend it.”\n\n“That little Meta,” said Margaret. “Her wishes for substantial use have\nbeen pretty well realised!”\n\n“Um!” said Ethel.\n\n“What do you mean?” said Norman sharply. “I should call her present\nposition the perfection of feminine usefulness.”\n\n“So perhaps it is,” said Ethel; “but though she does it beautifully,\nand is very valuable, to be the mistress of a great luxurious house like\nthat does not seem to me the subject of aspirations like Meta’s.”\n\n“Think of the contrast with what she used to be,” said Margaret gently,\n“the pretty, gentle, playful toy that her father brought her up to\nbe, living a life of mere accomplishments and self-indulgence; kind\ncertainly, but never so as to endure any disagreeables, or make any\nexertion. But as soon as she entered into the true spirit of our\ncalling, did she not begin to seek to live the sterner life, and train\nherself in duty? The quiet way she took always seemed to me the great\nbeauty of it. She makes duties of her accomplishments by making them\nloving obedience to her father.”\n\n“Not that they are not pleasant to her?” interposed Norman.\n\n“Certainly,” said Margaret, “but it gives them the zest, and confidence\nthat they are right, which one could not have in such things merely for\none’s own amusement.”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel, “she does more; she told me one day that one reason\nshe liked sketching was, that looking into nature always made psalms and\nhymns sing in her ears, and so with her music and her beautiful copies\nfrom the old Italian devotional pictures. She says our papa taught her\nto look at them so as to see more than the mere art and beauty.”\n\n“Think how diligently she measures out her day,” said Margaret; “getting\nup early, to be sure of time for reading her serious books, and working\nhard at her tough studies.”\n\n“And what I care for still more,” said Ethel, “her being bent on\nlearning plain needlework and doing it for her poor people. She is so\nuseful amongst the cottagers at Abbotstoke!”\n\n“And a famous little mistress of the house,” added Margaret. “When the\nold housekeeper went away two years ago, she thought she ought to know\nsomething about the government of the house; so she asked me about\nit, and proposed to her father that the new one should come to her for\norders, and that she should pay the wages and have the accounts in\nher hands. Mr. Rivers thought it was only a freak, but she has gone on\nsteadily; and I assure you, she has had some difficulties, for she has\ncome to me about them. Perhaps Ethel does not believe in them?”\n\n“No, I was only thinking how I should hate ordering those fanciful\ndinners for Mr. Rivers. I know what you mean, and how she had\ndifficulties about sending the maids to church, and in dealing with the\ncook, who did harm to the other servants, and yet sent up dinners that\nhe liked, and how puzzled she was to avoid annoying him. Oh! she has got\ninto a peck of troubles by making herself manager.”\n\n“And had she not been the Meta she is, she would either have fretted, or\nthrown it all up, instead of humming briskly through all. She never\nwas afraid to speak to any one,” said Margaret, “that is one thing; I\nbelieve every difficulty makes the spirit bound higher, till she springs\nover it, and finds it, as she says, only a pleasure.”\n\n“She need not be afraid to speak,” said Ethel, “for she always does it\nwell and winningly. I have seen her give a reproof in so firm and kind a\nway, and so bright in the instant of forgiveness.”\n\n“Yes,” said Margaret, “she does those disagreeable things as well as\nFlora does in her way.”\n\n“And yet,” said Ethel, “doing things well does not seem to be a snare to\nher.”\n\n“Because,” whispered Margaret, “she fulfils more than almost any\none--the--‘Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.’”\n\n“Do you know,” said Norman suddenly, “the derivation of Margarita?”\n\n“No further than those two pretty meanings, the pearl and the daisy,”\n said Ethel.\n\n“It is from the Persian Mervarid, child of light,” said Norman; and,\nwith a sudden flush of colour, he returned to the garden.\n\n“A fit meaning for one who carries sunshine with her,” said Margaret.\n“I feel in better tune for a whole day after her bright eyes have been\nsmiling on me.”\n\n“You want no one to put you in tune,” said Ethel fondly--“you, our own\npearl of light.”\n\n“No, call me only an old faded daisy,” said Margaret sadly.\n\n“Not a bit, only our moon, la gran Margarita” said Ethel.\n\n“I hear the real Daisy coming!” exclaimed Margaret, her face lighting up\nwith pleasure as the two youngest children entered, and, indeed, little\nGertrude’s golden hair, round open face, fresh red and white complexion,\nand innocent looks, had so much likeness to the flower, as to promote\nthe use of the pet name, though protests were often made in favour\nof her proper appellation. Her temper was daisy-like too, serene and\nloving, and able to bear a great deal of spoiling, and resolve as they\nmight, who was not her slave?\n\nMiss Winter no longer ruled the schoolroom. Her sway had been brought\nto a happy conclusion by a proposal from a widowed sister to keep house\nwith her; and Ethel had reason to rejoice that Margaret had kept her\nsubmissive under authority, which, if not always judicious, was both\nkind and conscientious.\n\nUpon the change, Ethel had thought that the lessons could easily\nbe managed by herself and Flora; while Flora was very anxious for a\nfinishing governess, who might impart singing to herself, graces to\nEthel, and accomplishments to Mary and Blanche.\n\nDr. May, however, took them both by surprise. He met with a family of\norphans, the eldest of whom had been qualifying herself for a governess,\nand needed nothing but age and finish; and in ten minutes after the\nproject had been conceived, he had begun to put it in execution, in\nspite of Flora’s prudent demurs.\n\nMiss Bracy was a gentle, pleasing young person, pretty to look at,\nwith her soft olive complexion, and languid pensive eyes, obliging and\nintelligent; and the change from the dry, authoritative Miss Winter was\nso delightful, that unedifying contrasts were continually being drawn.\nBlanche struck up a great friendship for her at once; Mary, always\ndocile, ceased to be piteous at her lessons, and Ethel moralised on the\nsatisfaction of having sympathy needed instead of repelled, and did her\nutmost to make Miss Bracy feel at home--and like a friend--in her new\nposition.\n\nFor herself, Ethel had drawn up a beautiful time-table, with all her\npursuits and duties most carefully balanced, after the pattern of that\nwhich Margaret Rivers had made by her advice, on the departure of Mrs.\nLarpent, who had been called away by the ill-health of her son. Meta had\nadhered to hers in an exemplary manner, but she was her own mistress in\na manner that could hardly be the lot of one of a large family.\n\nMargaret had become subject to languor and palpitations, and the head\nof the household had fallen entirely upon Flora, who, on the other hand,\nwas a person of multifarious occupations, and always had a great number\nof letters to write, or songs to copy and practise, which, together with\nher frequent visits to Mrs. Hoxton, made her glad to devolve, as much as\nshe could, upon her younger sister; and, “Oh, Ethel, you will not mind\njust doing this for me,” was said often enough to be a tax upon her\ntime.\n\nMoreover, Ethel perceived that Aubrey’s lessons were in an\nunsatisfactory state. Margaret could not always attend to them, and\nsuffered from them when she did; and he was bandied about between his\nsisters and Miss Bracy in a manner that made him neither attentive nor\nobedient.\n\nOn her own principle, that to embrace a task heartily renders it no\nlonger irksome, she called on herself to sacrifice her studies and\nher regularity, as far as was needful, to make her available for home\nrequirements. She made herself responsible for Aubrey, and, after a\nfew battles with his desultory habits, made him a very promising\npupil, inspiring so much of herself into him, that he was, if anything,\noverfull of her classical tastes. In fact, he had such an appetite for\nbooks, and dealt so much in precocious wisdom, that his father was heard\nto say, “Six years old! It is a comfort that he will soon forget the\nwhole.”\n\nGertrude was also Ethel’s pupil, but learning was not at all in her\nline; and the sight of “Cobwebs to catch Flies,” or of the venerated\n“Little Charles,” were the most serious clouds, that made the Daisy\npucker up her face, and infuse a whine into her voice.\n\nHowever, to-day, as usual, she was half dragged, half coaxed, through\nher day’s portion of the discipline of life, and then sent up for her\nsleep, while Aubrey’s two hours were spent in more agreeable work, such\nas Margaret could not but enjoy hearing--so spirited was Ethel’s mode of\nteaching--so eager was her scholar.\n\nHis play afterwards consisted in fighting o’er again the siege of Troy\non the floor, with wooden bricks, shells, and the survivors of a Noah’s\nark, while Ethel read to Margaret until Gertrude’s descent from the\nnursery, when the only means of preventing a dire confusion in Aubrey’s\ncamp was for her elder sisters to become her playfellows, and so spare\nAubrey’s temper. Ethel good-humouredly gave her own time, till their\nlittle tyrant trotted out to make Norman carry her round the garden on\nhis back.\n\nSo sped the morning till Flora came home, full of the intended bazaar,\nand Ethel would fain have taken refuge in puzzling out her Spanish, had\nshe not remembered her recent promise to be gracious.\n\nThe matter had been much as she had described it. Flora had a way of\nhinting at anything she thought creditable, and thus the Stoneborough\npublic had become aware of the exertions of the May family on behalf of\nCocksmoor.\n\nThe plan of a fancy fair was started. Mrs. Hoxton became more interested\nthan was her wont, and Flora was enchanted at the opening it gave for\npromoting the welfare of the forlorn district. She held a position which\nmade her hope to direct the whole. As she had once declared, with truth,\nit only had depended on themselves, whether she and her sisters should\nsink to the level of the Andersons and their set, or belong to the\ncounty society; and her tact had resulted in her being decidedly--as the\nlittle dressmaker’s apprentice amused Ethel by saying--“One of our most\ndistinguished patronesses”--a name that had stuck by her ever since.\n\nMargaret looked on passively, inclined to admire Flora in everything,\nyet now and then puzzled; and her father, in his simple-hearted way,\nfelt only gratitude and exultation in the kindness that his daughter\nmet with. As to the bazaar, if it had been started in his own family, he\nmight have weighed the objections, but, as it was not his daughter’s own\nconcern, he did not trouble himself about it, only regarding it as one\nof the many vagaries of the ladies of Stoneborough.\n\nSo the scheme had been further developed, till now Flora came in with\nmuch to tell. The number of stalls had been finally fixed. Mrs. Hoxton\nundertook one, with Flora as an aide-de-camp, and some nieces to assist;\nLady Leonora was to chaperon Miss Rivers; and a third, to Flora’s\nregret, had been allotted to Miss Cleveland, a good-natured, merry,\nelderly heiress, who would, Flora feared, bring on them the whole\n“Stoneborough crew.” And then she began to reckon up the present\nresources--drawings, bags, and pincushions. “That chip hat you plaited\nfor Daisy, Margaret, you must let us have that. It will be lovely,\ntrimmed with pink.”\n\n“Do you wish for this?” said Ethel, heaving up a mass of knitting.\n\n“Thank you,” said Flora; “so ornamental, especially the original\nperformance in the corner, which you would perpetrate, in spite of my\nbest efforts.”\n\n“I shall not be offended if you despise it. I only thought you might\nhave no more scruple in robbing Granny Hall than in robbing Daisy.”\n\n“Pray, send it. Papa will buy it as your unique performance.”\n\n“No; you shall tell me what I am to do.”\n\n“Does she mean it?” said Flora, turning to Margaret. “Have you converted\nher? Well done! Then, Ethel, we will get some pretty batiste, and you\nand Mary shall make some of those nice sun-bonnets, which you really do\nto perfection.”\n\n“Thank you. That is a more respectable task than I expected. People may\nhave something worth buying,” said Ethel, who, like all the world, felt\nthe influence of Flora’s tact.\n\n“I mean to study the useful,” said Flora. “The Cleveland set will be\nsure to deal in frippery, and I have been looking over Mrs. Hoxton’s\nstores, where I see quite enough for mere decoration. There are two\nsplendid vases in potichomanie, in an Etruscan pattern, which are coming\nfor me to finish.”\n\n“Mrs. Taylor, at Cocksmoor, could do that for you,” said Ethel. “Her two\nphials, stuffed with chintz patterns and flour, are quite as original\nand tasteful.”\n\n“Silly work,” said Flora, “but it makes a fair show.”\n\n“The essence of Vanity Fair,” said Ethel.\n\n“It won’t do to be satirical over much,” said Flora. “You won’t get on\nwithout humouring your neighbours’ follies.”\n\n“I don’t want to get on.”\n\n“But you want--or, at least, I want--Cocksmoor to get on.”\n\nEthel saw Margaret looking distressed, and, recalling her resolution\nshe said, “Well, Flora, I don’t mean to say any more about it. I see it\ncan’t be helped, and you all think you intend it for good; so there’s an\nend of the matter, and I’ll do anything for you in reason.”\n\n“Poor old King Ethel!” said Flora, smiling in an elder-sisterly\nmanner. “You will see, my dear, your views are very pretty, but very\nimpracticable, and it is a work-a-day world after all--even papa would\ntell you so. When Cocksmoor school is built, then you may thank me. I do\nnot look for it before.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\n\n     Knowledge is second, not the first;\n     A higher Hand must make her mild,\n     If all be not in vain, and guide\n     Her footsteps, moving side by side,\n     With wisdom; like the younger child,\n     For she is earthly of the mind,\n     But knowledge heavenly of the soul.--In Memoriam.\n\n\nEtheldred had not answered her sister, but she did not feel at all\nsecure that she should have anything to be thankful for, even if the\nschool were built.\n\nThe invasion of Cocksmoor was not only interference with her own field\nof action, but it was dangerous to the improvement of her scholars.\nSince the departure of Mr. Wilmot, matters at Stoneborough National\nSchool had not improved, though the Misses Anderson talked a great deal\nabout progress, science, and lectures.\n\nThe Ladies’ Committee were constantly at war with the mistresses, and\nthat one was a veteran who endured them, or whom they could endure\nbeyond her first half-year. No mistress had stayed a year within the\nmemory of any girl now at school. Perpetual change prevented any real\neducation, and, as each lady held different opinions and proscribed all\nbooks not agreeing thereto, everything “dogmatical” was excluded; and,\nas Ethel said, the children learned nothing but facts about lions and\nsteam-engines, while their doctrine varied with that of the visitor for\nthe week. If the ten generals could only have given up to Miltiades,\nbut, alas! there was no Miltiades. Mr. Ramsden’s health was failing,\nand his neglect told upon the parish in the dreadful evils reigning\nunchecked, and engulfing many a child whom more influential teaching\nmight have saved. Mental arithmetic, and the rivers of Africa, had\nlittle power to strengthen the soul against temptation.\n\nThe scanty attendance at the National School attested the indifference\nwith which it was regarded, and the borderers voluntarily patronised\nCherry Elwood, and thus had, perhaps, first aroused the emulation that\nled Mrs. Ledwich on a visit of inspection, to what she chose to consider\nas an offshoot of the National School.\n\nThe next day she called upon the Misses May. It was well that Ethel was\nnot at home. Margaret received the lady’s horrors at the sight of the\nmere crowded cottage kitchen, the stupid untrained mistress, without an\nidea of method, and that impertinent woman, her mother! Miss Flora and\nMiss Ethel must have had a great deal to undergo, and she would lose no\ntime in convening the Ladies’ Committee, and appointing a successor to\n“that Elwood,” as soon as a fit room could be erected for her use. If\nMargaret had not known that Mrs. Ledwich sometimes threatened more than\nshe could accomplish, she would have been in despair. She tried to say\na good word for Cherry, but was talked down, and had reason to believe\nthat Mrs. Elwood had mortally offended Mrs. Ledwich.\n\nThe sisters had heard the other side of the story at Cocksmoor. Mrs.\nElwood would not let them enter the school till she had heard how that\nthere Mrs. Ledwich had come in, and treated them all as if it was her\nown place--how she had found fault with Cherry before all the children,\nand as good as said she was not fit to keep a school. She had even laid\nhands on one of the books, and said that she should take it home, and\nsee whether it were a fit one for them to use; whereupon Mrs. Elwood had\nburst out in defence--it was Miss Ethel May’s book, and should not be\ntaken away--it was Miss Ethel as she looked to; and when it seemed that\nMrs. Ledwich had said something disparaging of Miss Ethel, either as\nto youth, judgment, or doctrine, Mrs. Elwood had fired up into a\ndeclaration that “Miss Ethel was a real lady--that she was! and that\nno real lady would ever come prying into other folk’s work and finding\nfault with what wasn’t no business of theirs,” with more of a personal\nnature, which Flora could not help enjoying, even while she regretted\nit.\n\nCherry was only too meek, as her mother declared. She had said not a\nword, except in quiet reply, and being equally terrified by the attack\nand defence, had probably seemed more dull than was her wont. Her real\nfeelings did not appear till the next Sunday, when, in her peaceful\nconference with Margaret, far from the sound of storms, she expressed\nthat she well knew that she was a poor scholar, and that she hoped the\nyoung ladies would not let her stand in the children’s light, when a\nbetter teacher could be found for them.\n\n“I am sure!” cried Ethel, as she heard of this, “it would be hard to\nfind such a teacher in humility! Cherry bears it so much better than I,\nthat it is a continual reproof!”\n\nAs to the dullness, against which Ethel used to rail, the attacks upon\nit had made her erect it into a positive merit; she was always comparing\nthe truth, honesty, and respectful demeanour of Cherry’s scholars with\nthe notorious faults of the National School girls, as if these defects\nhad been implanted either by Mrs. Ledwich, or by geography. It must be\nconfessed that the violence of partisanship did not make her a pleasant\ncompanion.\n\nHowever, the interest of the bazaar began somewhat to divert the current\nof the ladies’ thoughts, and Ethel found herself walking day after\nday to Cocksmoor, unmolested by further reports of Mrs. Ledwich’s\nproceedings. Richard was absent, preparing for ordination, but Norman\nhad just returned home for the Long Vacation, and, rather than lose the\nchance of a conversation with her, had joined her and Mary in a walk to\nCocksmoor.\n\nHis talk was chiefly of Settlesham, old Mr. Wilmot’s parish, where\nhe had been making a visit to his former tutor, and talking over the\nremoval to Eton of Tom, who had well responded to the care taken of him,\nand with his good principles confirmed, and his character strengthened,\nmight be, with less danger, exposed to trial.\n\nIt had been a visit such as to leave a deep impression on Norman’s mind.\nSixty years ago, old Mr. Wilmot had been what he now was himself--an\nenthusiastic and distinguished Balliol man, and he had kept up a\nwarm, clear-sighted interest in Oxford throughout his long life. His\nanecdotes, his recollections, and comments on present opinions had been\nlistened to with great eagerness, and Norman had felt it an infinite\nhonour to give the venerable old man his arm, as to be shown by him his\ncurious collection of books. His parish, carefully watched for so many\nyears, had been a study not lost upon Norman, who detailed particulars\nof the doings there, which made Ethel sigh to think of the contrast\nwith Stoneborough. In such conversation they came to the entrance of\nthe hamlet, and Mary, with a scream of joy, declared that she really\nbelieved that he was going to help them! He did not turn away.\n\n“Thank you!” said Ethel, in a low voice, from the bottom of her heart.\n\nShe used him mercifully, and made the lessons shorter than usual, but\nwhen they reached the open air again, he drew a long breath; and when\nMary eagerly tried for a compliment to their scholars, asked if they\ncould not be taught the use of eyelids.\n\n“Did they stare?” said Ethel. “That’s one advantage of being blind. No\none can stare me out of countenance.”\n\n“Why were you answering all your questions yourself?” asked Mary.\n\n“Because no one else would,” said Norman.\n\n“You used such hard words,” replied Ethel.\n\n“Indeed! I thought I was very simple.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Mary, “there were derive, and instruction, and implicate,\nand--oh, so many.”\n\n“Never mind,” said Ethel, seeing him disconcerted. “It is better for\nthem to be drawn up, and you will soon learn their language. If we only\nhad Una M’Carthy here!”\n\n“Then you don’t like it?” said Mary, disappointed.\n\n“It is time to learn not to be fastidious,” he answered. “So, if you\nwill help me--”\n\n“Norman, I am so glad!” said Ethel.\n\n“Yes,” said Norman, “I see now that these things that puff us up, and\nseem the whole world to us now, all end in nothing but such as this!\nThink of old Mr. Wilmot, once carrying all before him, but deeming all\nhis powers well bestowed in fifty years’ teaching of clowns!”\n\n“Yes,” replied Ethel, very low. “One soul is worth--” and she paused\nfrom the fullness of thought.\n\n“And these things, about which we are so elated, do not render us so fit\nto teach--as you, Mary, or as Richard.”\n\n“They do,” said Ethel. “The ten talents were doubled. Strength tells in\npower. The more learning, the fitter to teach the simplest thing.”\n\n“You remind me of old Mr. Wilmot saying that the first thing he learned\nat his parish was, how little his people knew; the second, how little he\nhimself knew.”\n\nSo Norman persevered in the homely discipline that he had chosen for\nhimself, which brought out his deficiency in practical work in a manner\nwhich lowered him in his own eyes, to a degree almost satisfactory\nto himself. He was not, indeed, without humility, but his nature was\nself-contemplative and self-conscious enough to perceive his superiority\nof talent, and it had been the struggle of his life to abase this\nperception, so that it was actually a relief not to be obliged to fight\nwith his own complacency in his powers. He had learned not to think too\nhighly of himself--he had yet to learn to “think soberly.” His aid was\nEthel’s chief pleasure through this somewhat trying summer, it might be\nher last peaceful one at Cocksmoor.\n\nThat bazaar! How wild it had driven the whole town, and even her own\nhome!\n\nMargaret herself, between good nature and feminine love of pretty\nthings, had become ardent in the cause. In her unvaried life, it was a\ngreat amusement to have so many bright elegant things exhibited to her,\nand Ethel was often mortified to find her excited about some new device,\nor drawn off from “rational employments,” to complete some trifle.\n\nMary and Blanche were far worse. From the time that consent had been\ngiven to the fancy-work being carried on in the schoolroom, all interest\nin study was over. Thenceforth, lessons were a necessary form, gone\nthrough without heart or diligence. These were reserved for paste-board\nboxes, beplastered with rice and sealing-wax, for alum baskets, dressed\ndolls, and every conceivable trumpery; and the governess was as eager as\nthe scholars.\n\nIf Ethel remonstrated, she hurt Miss Bracy’s feelings, and this was a\nvery serious matter to both parties.\n\nThe governess was one of those morbidly sensitive people, who cannot\nbe stopped when once they have begun arguing that they are injured.\nTwo women together, each with the last-word instinct, have no power\nto cease; and, when the words are spent in explaining--not in\nscolding--conscience is not called in to silence them, and nothing but\ndinner or a thunder-storm can check them. All Ethel’s good sense was of\nno avail; she could not stop Miss Bracy, and, though she might resolve\nwithin herself that real kindness would be to make one reasonable reply,\nand then quit the subject, yet, on each individual occasion, such a\nmeasure would have seemed mere impatience and cruelty. She found that if\nMiss Winter had been too dry, Miss Bracy went to the other extreme,\nand demanded a manifestation of sympathy, and return to her passionate\nattachment that perplexed Ethel’s undemonstrative nature. Poor good Miss\nBracy, she little imagined how often she added to the worries of her\ndear Miss Ethel, all for want of self-command.\n\nFinally, as the lessons were less and less attended to, and the needs\nof the stall became more urgent, Dr. May and Margaret concurred in a\ndecision, that it was better to yield to the mania, and give up the\nstudies till they could be pursued with a willing mind.\n\nEthel submitted, and only laughed with Norman at the display of\ntreasures, which the girls went over daily, like the “House that Jack\nbuilt,” always starting from “the box that Mary made.” Come when Dr. May\nwould into the drawing-room, there was always a line of penwipers laid\nout on the floor, bags pendent to all the table-drawers, antimacassars\nlaid out everywhere.\n\nEthel hoped that the holidays would create a diversion, but Mary was too\nold to be made into a boy, and Blanche drew Hector over to the feminine\nparty, setting him to gum, gild, and paste all the contrivances which,\nin their hands, were mere feeble gimcracks, but which now became fairly\nsound, or, at least, saleable.\n\nThe boys also constructed a beautiful little ship from a print of the\nAlcestis, so successfully, that the doctor promised to buy it; and Ethel\ngrudged the very sight of it to the bazaar.\n\nTom, who, in person, was growing like a little shadow or model of\nNorman, had, unlike him, a very dexterous pair of hands, and made\nhimself extremely useful in all such works. On the other hand, the\nCleveland stall seemed chiefly to rely for brilliance on the wit of\nHarvey Anderson, who was prospering at his college, and the pride of his\nfamily. A great talker, and extremely gallant, he was considered a far\ngreater acquisition to a Stoneborough drawing-room than was the silent,\nbashful Norman May, and rather looked down on his brother Edward, who,\nhaving gone steadily through the school, was in the attorney’s office,\nand went on quietly and well, colouring up gratefully whenever one of\nthe May family said a kind word to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n\n       Any silk, any thread,\n       Any toys for your head,\n     Of the newest and finest wear-a?\n       Come to the pedlar,\n       Money’s a medlar.\n     That doth utter all men’s ware-a.\n                                Winter’s Tale.\n\n\n“This one day and it will be over, and we shall be rational again,”\n thought Ethel, as she awoke.\n\nFlora was sleeping at the Grange, to be ready for action in the morning,\nand Ethel was to go early with Mary and Blanche, who were frantic to\nhave a share in the selling. Norman and the boys were to walk at their\nown time, and the children to be brought later by Miss Bracy. The doctor\nwould be bound by no rules.\n\nIt was a pattern day, bright, clear, warm, and not oppressive, perfect\nfor an out-of-doors fete; and Ethel had made up her mind to fulfil her\npromise to Margaret of enjoying herself. In the brilliant sunshine, and\nbetween two such happy sisters, it would have been surly, indeed, not to\nenter into the spirit of the day; and Ethel laughed gaily with them,\nand at their schemes and hopes; Blanche’s heart being especially set on\nknowing the fate of a watch-guard of her own construction.\n\nHearing that the ladies were in the gardens, they repaired thither at\nonce. The broad, smooth bowling-green lay before them; a marquee, almost\nconverted into a bower, bounding it on either side, while in the midst\narose, gorgeous and delicious, a pyramid of flowers--contributions from\nall the hot-houses in the neighbourhood--to be sold for the benefit of\nthe bazaar. Their freshness and fragrance gave a brightness to the whole\nscene, while shrinking from such light, as only the beauteous works of\nnature could bear, was the array accomplished by female fingers.\n\nUnder the wreathed canopies were the stalls, piled up with bright\ncolours, most artistically arranged. Ethel, with her over-minute\nknowledge of every article, could hardly believe that yonder glowing\nEastern pattern of scarlet, black, and blue, was, in fact, a judicious\nmosaic of penwipers that she remembered, as shreds begged from the\ntailor, that the delicate lace-work consisted of Miss Bracy’s perpetual\nantimacassars, and that the potichomanie could look so dignified and\nEtruscan.\n\n“Here you are!” cried Meta Rivers, springing to meet them. “Good girls,\nto come early. Where’s my little Daisy?”\n\n“Coming in good time,” said Ethel. “How pretty it all looks!”\n\n“But where’s Flora?--where’s my watch-guard?” anxiously asked Blanche.\n\n“She was here just now,” said Meta, looking round. “What a genius she\nis, Ethel! She worked wonders all yesterday, and let the Miss Hoxtons\nthink it was all their own doing, and she was out before six this\nmorning, putting finishing touches.”\n\n“Is this your stall?” said Ethel.\n\n“Yes, but it will not bear a comparison with hers. It has a lady’s-maid\nlook by the side of hers. In fact, Bellairs and my aunt’s maid did it\nchiefly, for papa was rather ailing yesterday, and I could not be out\nmuch.”\n\n“How is he now?”\n\n“Better; he will walk round by-and-by. I hope it will not be too much\nfor him.”\n\n“Oh, what beautiful things!” cried Mary, in ecstasy, at what she was\nforced to express by the vague substantive, for her imagination had\nnever stretched to the marvels she beheld.\n\n“Ay, we have been lazy, you see, and so Aunt Leonora brought down all\nthese smart concerns. It is rather like Howell and James’s, isn’t it?”\n\nIn fact, Lady Leonora’s marquee was filled with costly knick-knacks,\nwhich, as Meta justly said, had not half the grace and appropriate air\nthat reigned where Flora had arranged, and where Margaret had worked,\nwith the peculiar freshness and finish that distinguished everything to\nwhich she set her hand.\n\nMiss Cleveland’s counter was not ill set-out, but it wanted the air of\nease and simplicity, which was even more noticeable than the perfect\ntaste of Flora’s wares. If there had been nothing facetious, the effect\nwould have been better, but there was nothing to regret, and the whole\nwas very bright and gay.\n\nBlanche could hardly look; so anxious was she for Flora to tell her the\nlocality of her treasure.\n\n“There she is,” said Meta at last. “George is fixing that branch of\nevergreen for her.”\n\n“Flora! I did not know her,” cried each sister amazed; while Mary added,\n“Oh, how nice she looks!”\n\nIt was the first time of seeing her in the white muslin, and broad chip\nhat--which all the younger saleswomen of the bazaar had agreed to wear.\nIt was a most becoming dress, and she did, indeed, look strikingly\nelegant and well dressed. It occurred to Ethel, for the first time, that\nFlora was decidedly the reigning beauty of the bazaar--no one but Meta\nRivers could be compared to her, and that little lady was on so small\na scale of perfect finish, that she seemed fit to act the fairy, where\nFlora was the enchanted princess.\n\nFlora greeted her sisters eagerly, while Meta introduced her brother--a\ngreat contrast to herself, though not without a certain comeliness,\ntall and large, with ruddy complexion, deep lustreless black eyes, and\na heavy straight bush of black moustache, veiling rather thick lips.\nBlanche reiterated inquiries for her watch-guard.\n\n“I don’t know,”--said Flora. “Somewhere among the rest.”\n\nBlanche was in despair.\n\n“You may look for it,” said Flora, who, however hurried, never failed in\nkindness, “if you will touch nothing.”\n\nSo Blanche ran from place to place in restless dismay, that caused Mr.\nGeorge Rivers to ask what was the matter.\n\n“The guards! the guards!” cried Blanche; whereupon he fell into a fit of\nlaughter, which disconcerted her, because she could not understand him,\nand made Ethel take an aversion to him on the spot.\n\nHowever, he was very good-natured; he took Blanche’s reluctant hand, and\nconducted her all along the stall, even proceeding to lift her up where\nshe could not command a view of the whole, thus exciting her extreme\nindignation. She shook herself out when he set her down, surveyed her\ncrumpled muslin, and believed he took her for a little girl! She ought\nto have been flattered when the quest was successful, and he insisted\non knowing which was the guard, and declared that he should buy it. She\nbegged him to do no such thing, and he desired to know why--insisting\nthat he would give five shillings--fifteen--twenty-five for that one!\ntill she did not know whether he was in earnest, and she doing an injury\nto the bazaar.\n\nMeantime, the hour had struck, and Flora had placed Mrs. Hoxton in a\nsheltered spot, where she could take as much or as little trouble as she\npleased. Lady Leonora and Miss Langdale came from the house, and, with\nthe two ladies’-maids in the background, took up their station with\nMiss Rivers. Miss Cleveland called her party to order, and sounds of\ncarriages were heard approaching.\n\nMary and Blanche disbursed the first money spent in the “fancy fair;”\n Mary, on a blotting-book for Harry, to be placed among the presents, to\nwhich she added on every birthday, while Blanche bought a sixpenny gift\nfor every one, with more attention to the quantity than the quality.\nThen came a revival of her anxieties for the guards, and while Mary was\nsimply desirous of the fun of being a shopwoman, and was made happy by\nMeta Rivers asking her help, Blanche was in despair, till she had sidled\nup to their neighbourhood, and her piteous looks had caused good-natured\nMrs. Hoxton to invite her to assist, when she placed herself close to\nthe precious object.\n\nA great fluttering of heart went to that manoeuvre, but still felicity\ncould not be complete. That great troublesome Mr. George Rivers had\nactually threatened to buy nothing but that one watch-chain, and\nBlanche’s eye followed him everywhere with fear, lest he should come\nthat way. And there were many other gentlemen--what could they want but\nwatch-guards, and of them--what--save this paragon?\n\nPoor Blanche; what did she not undergo whenever any one cast his eye\nover her range of goods? and this was not seldom, for there was an\nattraction in the pretty little eager girl, glowing and smiling. One\nold gentleman actually stopped, handled the guards themselves, and asked\ntheir price.\n\n“Eighteen-pence,” said Blanche, colouring and faltering, as she held up\none in preference.\n\n“Eh! is not this the best?” said he, to the lady on his arm.\n\n“Oh! please, take that instead?” exclaimed Blanche, in extremity.\n\n“And why?” asked the gentleman, amused.\n\n“I made this,” she answered.\n\n“Is that the reason I must not have it?”\n\n“No, don’t tease her,” the lady said kindly; and the other was taken.\n\n“I wonder for what it is reserved!” the lady could not help saying, as\nshe walked away.\n\n“Let us watch her for a minute or two. What an embellishment\nchildren are! Ha! don’t you see--the little maid is fluttering and\nreddening--now! How pretty she looks! Ah! I see! here’s the favoured!\nDon’t you see that fine bronzed lad--Eton--one can see at a glance! It\nis a little drama. They are pretending to be strangers. He is turning\nover the goods with an air, she trying to look equally careless, but\nwhat a pretty carnation it is! Ha! ha! he has come to it--he has it! Now\nthe acting is over, and they are having their laugh out! How joyously!\nWhat next! Oh! she begs off from keeping shop--she darts out to him,\ngoes off in his hand--I declare that is the prettiest sight in the whole\nfair! I wonder who the little demoiselle can be?”\n\nThe great event of the day was over now with Blanche, and she greatly\nenjoyed wandering about with Hector and Tom. There was a post-office\nat Miss Cleveland’s stall, where, on paying sixpence, a letter could be\nobtained to the address of the inquirer. Blanche had been very anxious\nto try, but Flora had pronounced it nonsense; however, Hector declared\nthat Flora was not his master, tapped at the sliding panel, and charmed\nBlanche by what she thought a most witty parody of his name as Achilles\nLionsrock, Esquire. When the answer came from within, “Ship letter, sir,\ndouble postage,” they thought it almost uncanny; and Hector’s shilling\nwas requited by something so like a real ship letter, that they had\nsome idea that the real post had somehow transported itself thither. The\ninterior was decidedly oracular, consisting of this one line, “I counsel\nyou to persevere in your laudable undertaking.”\n\nHector said he wished he had any laudable undertaking, and Blanche tried\nto persuade Tom to try his fortune, but he pronounced that he did\nnot care to hear Harvey Anderson’s trash--he knew his writing, though\ndisguised, and had detected his shining boots below the counter. There\nMr. George Rivers came up, and began to tease Blanche about the guards,\nasking her to take his fifteen shillings--or five-and-twenty, and who\nhad got that one, which alone he wanted; till the poor child, after\nstanding perplexed for some moments, looked up with spirit, and said,\n“You have no business to ask,” and, running away, took refuge in the\nback of Mrs. Hoxton’s marquee, where she found Ethel packing up for Miss\nHoxton’s purchasers, and confiding to her that Mr. George Rivers was a\nhorrid man, she ventured no more from her protection. She did, indeed,\nemerge, when told that papa was coming with Aubrey and Daisy and Miss\nBracy, and she had the pleasure of selling to them some of her wares.\nDr. May bargaining with her to her infinite satisfaction; and little\nGertrude’s blue eyes opened to their full width, not understanding what\ncould have befallen her sisters.\n\n“And what is Ethel doing?” asked the doctor.\n\n“Packing up parcels, papa,” and Ethel’s face was raised, looking very\nmerry.\n\n“Packing parcels! How long will they last tied up?” said Dr. May,\nlaughing.\n\n“Lasting is the concern of nothing in the fair, papa,” answered she, in\nthe same tone.\n\nFor Ethel was noted as the worst packer in the house; but, having\noffered to wrap up a pincushion, sold by a hurried Miss Hoxton, she\nbecame involved in the office for the rest of the day--the same which\nBellairs and her companion performed at the Langdale counter. Flora was\ntoo ready and dexterous to need any such aid, but the Misses Hoxton\nwere glad to be spared the trouble; and Blanche, whose fingers were far\nneater than Ethel’s, made the task much easier, and was kept constant\nto it by her dread of the dark moustache, which was often visible near\ntheir tent, searching, she thought, for her.\n\nTheir humble employment was no sinecure; for this was the favourite\nstall with the purchasers of better style, since the articles were, in\ngeneral, tasteful, and fairly worth the moderate price set on them. At\nMiss Cleveland’s counter there was much noisy laughter--many jocular\ncheats--tricks for gaining money, and refusals to give change; and it\nseemed to be very popular with the Stoneborough people, and to carry\non a brisk trade. The only languor was in Lady Leonora’s quarter--the\narticles were too costly, and hung on hand; nor were the ladies\nsufficiently well known, nor active enough, to gain custom, excepting\nMeta, who drove a gay traffic at her end of the stall, which somewhat\nredeemed the general languor.\n\nHer eyes were, all the time, watching for her father, and, suddenly\nperceiving him, she left her trade in charge of the delighted and\nimportant Mary, and hastened to walk round with him, and show him the\nhumours of the fair.\n\nMary, in her absence, had the supreme happiness of obtaining Norman as\na customer. He wanted a picture for his rooms at Oxford, and\nwater-coloured drawings were, as Tom had observed, suitable staple\ncommodities for Miss Rivers. Mary tried to make him choose a\nbrightly-coloured pheasant, with a pencil background; and, then, a fine\nfoaming sea-piece, by some unknown Lady Adelaide, that much dazzled her\nimagination; but nothing would serve him but a sketch of an old cedar\ntree, with Stoneborough Minster in the distance, and the Welsh hills\nbeyond, which Mary thought a remarkable piece of bad taste, since--could\nhe not see all that any day of his life? and was it worth while to give\nfourteen shillings and sixpence for it? But he said it was all for the\ngood of Cocksmoor, and Mary was only too glad to add to her hoard of\ncoin; so she only marvelled at his extravagance, and offered to take\ncare of it for him; but, to this, he would not consent. He made her pack\nit up for him, and had just put the whitey-brown parcel under his arm,\nwhen Mr. Rivers and his daughter came up, before he was aware. Mary\nproudly advertised Meta that she had sold something for her.\n\n“Indeed! What was it?”\n\n“Your great picture of Stoneborough!” said Mary.\n\n“Is that gone? I am sorry you have parted with that, my dear; it was one\nof your best,” said Mr. Rivers, in his soft, sleepy, gentle tone.\n\n“Oh, papa, I can do another. But, I wonder! I put that extortionate\nprice on it, thinking no one would give it, and so that I should keep it\nfor you. Who has it, Mary?”\n\n“Norman, there. He would have it, though I told him it was very dear.”\n\nNorman, pressed near them by the crowd, had been unable to escape, and\nstood blushing, hesitating, and doubting whether he ought to restore the\nprize, which he had watched so long, and obtained so eagerly.\n\n“Oh! it is you?” said Mr. Rivers politely. “Oh, no, do not think of\nexchanging it. I am rejoiced that one should have it who can appreciate\nit. It was its falling into the hands of a stranger that I disliked. You\nthink with me, that it is one of her best drawings?”\n\n“Yes, I do,” said Norman, still rather hesitating. “She did that with\nC--, when he was here last year. He taught her very well. Have you that\nother here, that you took with him, my dear? The view from the gate, I\nmean.”\n\n“No, dear papa. You told me not to sell that.”\n\n“Ah! I remember; that is right. But there are some very pretty copies\nfrom Prout here.”\n\nWhile he was seeking them, Meta contrived to whisper, “If you could\npersuade him to go indoors--this confusion of people is so bad for him,\nand I must not come away. I was in hopes of Dr. May, but he is with the\nlittle ones.”\n\nNorman signed comprehension, and Meta said, “Those copies are not worth\nseeing, but you know, papa, you have the originals in the library.”\n\nMr. Rivers looked pleased, but was certain that Norman could not prefer\nthe sketches to this gay scene. However, it took very little persuasion\nto induce him to do what he wished, and he took Norman’s arm, crossed\nthe lawn, and arrived in his own study, where it was a great treat\nto him to catch any one who would admire his accumulation of prints,\ndrawings, coins, etc.; and his young friend was both very well amused\nand pleased to be setting Miss Rivers’s mind at ease on her father’s\naccount. It was not till half-past four that Dr. May knocked at the\ndoor, and stood surprised at finding his son there. Mr. Rivers spoke\nwarmly of the young Oxonian’s kindness in leaving the fair for an old\nman, and praised Norman’s taste in art. Norman rose to take leave, but\nstill thought it incumbent on him to offer to give up the picture,\nif Mr. Rivers set an especial value on it. But Mr. Rivers went to the\nlength of being very glad that it was in his possession, and added to\nit a very pretty drawing of the same size, by a noted master, which had\nbeen in the water-colour exhibition, and, while Norman walked away, well\npleased, Mr. Rivers began to extol him to his father, as a very superior\nand sensible young man, of great promise, and began to wish George had\nthe same turn.\n\nNorman, on returning to the fancy fair, found the world in all the\nardour of raffles. Lady Leonora’s contributions were the chief prizes,\nwhich attracted every one, and, of course, the result was delightfully\nincongruous. Poor Ethel, who had been persuaded to venture a shilling\nto please Blanche, who had spent all her own, obtained the two jars in\npotichomanie, and was regarding them with a face worth painting. Harvey\nAnderson had a doll, George Rivers a wooden monkey, that jumped over a\nstick; and, if Hector Ernescliffe was enchanted at winning a beautiful\nmother-of-pearl inlaid workbox, which he had vainly wished to buy for\nMargaret, Flora only gained a match-box of her own, well known always to\nmiss fire, but which had been decided to be good enough for the bazaar.\n\nBy fair means or foul, the commodities were cleared off, and, while the\nsunbeams faded from the trodden grass, the crowds disappeared, and\nthe vague compliment, “a very good bazaar,” was exchanged between the\nlingering sellers and their friends.\n\nFlora was again to sleep at the Grange, and return the next day, for\na committee to be held over the gains, which were not yet fully\nascertained. So Dr. May gathered his flock together, and packed them,\nboys and all, into the two conveyances, and Ethel bade Meta good-night,\nalmost wondering to hear her merry voice say, “It has been a delightful\nday, has it not? It was so kind of your brother to take care of papa.”\n\n“Oh, it was delightful!” echoed Mary, “and I took one pound fifteen and\nsixpence!”\n\n“I hope it will do great good to Cocksmoor,” added Meta, “but, if you\nwant real help, you know, you must come to us.”\n\nEthel smiled, but hurried her departure, for she saw Blanche again\ntormented by Mr. George Rivers, to know what had become of the guard,\ntelling her that, if she would not say, he should be furiously jealous.\n\nBlanche hid her face on Ethel’s arm, when they were in the carriage, and\nalmost cried with indignant “shamefastness.” That long-desired day had\nnot been one of unmixed happiness to her, poor child, and Ethel doubted\nwhether it had been so to any one, except, indeed, to Mary, whose\ndesires never soared so high but that they were easily fulfilled, and\nwhose placid content was not easily wounded. All she was wishing now\nwas, that Harry were at home to receive his paper-case.\n\nThe return to Margaret was real pleasure. The narration of all that had\npassed was an event to her. She was so charmed with her presents, of\nevery degree; things, unpleasant at the time, could, by drollery in the\nrelating, be made mirthful fun ever after; Dr. May and the boys were so\ncomical in their observations--Mary’s wonder and simplicity came in so\namazingly--and there was such merriment at Ethel’s two precious jars,\nthat she could hardly wish they had not come to her. On one head they\nwere all agreed, in dislike of George Rivers, whom Mary pronounced to be\na detestable man, and, when gently called to order by Margaret, defended\nit, by saying that Miss Bracy said it was better to detest than to\nhate, while Blanche coloured up to the ears, and hid herself behind\nthe arm-chair; and Dr. May qualified the censure by saying, he believed\nthere was no great harm in the youth, but that he was shallow-brained\nand extravagant, and, having been born in the days when Mr. Rivers had\nbeen working himself up in the world, had not had so good an education\nas his little half-sister.\n\n“Well, what are you thinking of?” said her father, laying his hand\non Ethel’s arm, as she was wearily and pensively putting together the\nscattered purchases before going up to bed.\n\n“I was thinking, papa, that there is a great deal of trouble taken in\nthis world for a very little pleasure.”\n\n“The trouble is the pleasure, in most cases, most misanthropical miss!”\n\n“Yes, that is true; but, if so, why cannot it be taken for some good?”\n\n“They meant it to be good,” said Dr. May. “Come, I cannot have you\nsevere and ungrateful.”\n\n“So I have been telling myself, papa, all along; but, now that the\nday has come, and I have seen what jealousies, and competitions, and\nvanities, and disappointments it has produced--not even poor little\nBlanche allowed any comfort--I am almost sick at heart with thinking\nCocksmoor was the excuse!”\n\n“Spectators are more philosophical than actors, Ethel. Others have not\nbeen tying parcels all day.”\n\n“I had rather do that than--But that is the ‘Fox and the Grapes,’” said\nEthel, smiling. “What I mean is, that the real gladness of life is not\nin these great occasions of pleasure, but in the little side delights\nthat come in the midst of one’s work, don’t they, papa? Why is it worth\nwhile to go and search for a day’s pleasuring?”\n\n“Ethel, my child! I don’t like to hear you talk so,” said Dr. May,\nlooking anxiously at her. “It may be too true, but it is not youthful\nnor hopeful. It is not as your mother or I felt in our young days, when\na treat was a treat to us, and gladdened our hearts long before and\nafter. I am afraid you have been too much saddened with loss and care--”\n\n“Oh, no, papa!” said Ethel, rousing herself, though speaking huskily.\n“You know I am your merry Ethel. You know I can be happy enough--only at\nhome--”\n\nAnd Ethel, though she had tried to be cheerful, leaned against his arm,\nand shed a few tears.\n\n“The fact is, she is tired out,” said Dr. May soothingly, yet half\nlaughing. “She is not a beauty or a grace, and she is thoughtful and\nquiet, and so she moralises, instead of enjoying, as the world goes by.\nI dare say a night’s rest will make all the difference in the world.”\n\n“Ah! but there is more to come. That Ladies’ Committee at Cocksmoor!”\n\n“They are not there yet, Ethel. Good-night, you tired little cynic.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n\n     Back then, complainer...\n     Go, to the world return, nor fear to cast\n     Thy bread upon the waters, sure at last\n        In joy to find it after many days.--Christian Year.\n\n\nThe next day Ethel had hoped for a return to reason, but behold, the\nworld was cross! The reaction of the long excitement was felt, Gertrude\nfretted, and was unwell; Aubrey was pettish at his lessons; and Mary and\nBlanche were weary, yawning and inattentive; every straw was a burden,\nand Miss Bracy had feelings.\n\nEthel had been holding an interminable conversation with her in the\nschoolroom, interrupted at last by a summons to speak to a Cocksmoor\nwoman at the back door, and she was returning from the kitchen, when the\ndoctor called her into his study.\n\n“Ethel! what is all this? Mary has found Miss Bracy in floods of tears\nin the schoolroom, because she says you told her she was ill-tempered.”\n\n“I am sure you will be quite as much surprised,” said Ethel, somewhat\nexasperated, “when you hear that you lacerated her feelings yesterday.”\n\n“I? Why, what did I do?” exclaimed Dr. May.\n\n“You showed your evident want of confidence in her.”\n\n“I? What can I have done?”\n\n“You met Aubrey and Gertrude in her charge, and you took them away at\nonce to walk with you.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Well, that was it. She saw you had no confidence in her.”\n\n“Ethel, what on earth can you mean? I saw the two children dragging on\nher, and I thought she would see nothing that was going on, and would be\nglad to be released; and I wanted them to go with me and see Meta’s gold\npheasants.”\n\n“That was the offence. She has been breaking her heart all this time,\nbecause she was sure, from your manner, that you were displeased to see\nthem alone with her--eating bon-bons, I believe, and therefore took them\naway.”\n\n“Daisy is the worse for her bon-bons, I believe, but the overdose of\nthem rests on my shoulders. I do not know how to believe you, Ethel. Of\ncourse you told her nothing of the kind crossed my mind, poor thing!”\n\n“I told her so, over and over again, as I have done forty times before\nbut her feelings are always being hurt.”\n\n“Poor thing, poor thing! no doubt it is a trying situation, and she is\nsensitive. Surely you are all forbearing with her?”\n\n“I hope we are,” said Ethel; “but how can we tell what vexes her?”\n\n“And what is this, of your telling her she was ill-tempered?” asked Dr.\nMay incredulously.\n\n“Well, papa,” said Ethel, softened, yet wounded by his thinking it\nso impossible. “I had often thought I ought to tell her that these\nsensitive feelings of hers were nothing but temper; and perhaps--indeed\nI know I do--I partake of the general fractiousness of the house to-day,\nand I did not bear it so patiently as usual. I did say that I thought it\nwrong to foster her fancies; for if she looked at them coolly, she would\nfind they were only a form of pride and temper.”\n\n“It did not come well from you, Ethel,” said the doctor, looking vexed.\n\n“No, I know it did not,” said Ethel meekly; “but oh! to have these\njanglings once a week, and to see no end to them!”\n\n“Once a week?”\n\n“It is really as often, or more often,” said Ethel. “If any of us\ncriticise anything the girls have done, if there is a change in any\narrangement, if she thinks herself neglected--I can’t tell you what\nlittle matters suffice; she will catch me, and argue with me, till--oh,\ntill we are both half dead, and yet cannot stop ourselves.”\n\n“Why do you argue?”\n\n“If I could only help it!”\n\n“Bad management,” said the doctor, in a low, musing tone. “You want a\nhead!” and he sighed.\n\n“Oh, papa, I did not mean to distress you. I would not have told you if\nI had remembered--but I am worried to-day, and off my guard--”\n\n“Ethel, I thought you were the one on whom I could depend for bearing\neverything.”\n\n“These were such nonsense!”\n\n“What may seem nonsense to you is not the same to her. You must\nbe forbearing, Ethel. Remember that dependence is prone to morbid\nsensitiveness, especially in those who have a humble estimate of\nthemselves.”\n\n“It seems to me that touchiness is more pride than humility,” said\nEthel, whose temper, already not in the smoothest state, found it hard\nthat, after having long borne patiently with these constant arguments,\nshe should find Miss Bracy made the chief object of compassion.\n\nDr. May’s chivalrous feeling caused him to take the part of the weak,\nand he answered, “You know nothing about it. Among our own kith and kin\nwe can afford to pass over slights, because we are sure the heart is\nright--we do not know what it is to be among strangers, uncertain of\nany claim to their esteem or kindness. Sad! sad!” he continued, as the\npicture wrought on him. “Each trifle seems a token one way or the other!\nI am very sorry I grieved the poor thing yesterday. I must go and tell\nher so at once.”\n\nHe put Ethel aside, and knocked at the schoolroom door, while Ethel\nstood, mortified. “He thinks I have been neglecting, or speaking harshly\nto her! For fifty times that I have borne with her maundering, I have,\nat last, once told her the truth; and for that I am accused of want of\nforbearance! Now he will go and make much of her, and pity her, till she\nwill think herself an injured heroine, and be worse than ever; and he\nwill do away with all the good of my advice, and want me to ask her\npardon for it--but that I never will. It was only the truth, and I will\nstick to it.”\n\n“Ethel!” cried Mary, running up to her, then slackening her pace, and\nwhispering, “you did not tell Miss Bracy she was ill-tempered.”\n\n“No--not exactly. How could you tell papa I did?”\n\n“She said so. She was crying, and I asked what was the matter, and she\nsaid my sister Ethel said she was ill-tempered.”\n\n“She made a great exaggeration then,” said Ethel.\n\n“I am sure she was very cross all day,” said Mary.\n\n“Well, that is no business of yours,” said Ethel pettishly. “What now?\nMary, don’t look out at the street window.”\n\n“It is Flora--the Grange carriage,” whispered Mary, as the two sisters\nmade a precipitate retreat into the drawing-room.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. May had been in the schoolroom. Miss Bracy had ceased her\ntears before he came--they had been her retort on Ethel, and she had not\nintended the world to know of them. Half disconcerted, half angry, she\nheard the doctor approach. She was a gentle, tearful woman, one of\nthose who are often called meek, under an erroneous idea that meekness\nconsists in making herself exceedingly miserable under every kind\nof grievance; and she now had a sort of melancholy satisfaction in\nbelieving that the young ladies had fabricated an exaggerated complaint\nof her temper, and that she was going to become injured innocence. To\nthink herself accused of a great wrong, excused her from perceiving\nherself guilty of a lesser one.\n\n“Miss Bracy,” said Dr. May, entering with his frank, sweet look, “I\nam concerned that I vexed you by taking the children to walk with me\nyesterday. I thought such little brats would be troublesome to any but\ntheir spoiling papa, but they would have been in safer hands with you.\nYou would not have been as weak as I was, in regard to sugar-plums.”\n Such amends as these confused Miss Bracy, who found it pleasanter to be\nlamentable with Ethel, than to receive a full apology for her imagined\noffence from the master of the house. Feeling both small and absurd,\nshe murmured something of “oh, no,” and “being sure,” and hoped he\nwas going, so that she might sit down to pity herself, for those girls\nhaving made her appear so ridiculous.\n\nNo such thing! Dr. May put a chair for her, and sat down himself,\nsaying, with a smile, “You see, you must trust us sometimes, and\noverlook it, if we are less considerate than we might be. We have rough,\ncareless habits with each other, and forget that all are not used to\nthem.”\n\nMiss Bracy exclaimed, “Oh, no, never, they were most kind.”\n\n“We wish to be,” said Dr. May, “but there are little neglects--or\nyou think there are. I will not say there are none, for that would be\nanswering too much for human nature, or that they are fanciful--for that\nwould be as little comfort as to tell a patient that the pain is only\nnervous--”\n\nMiss Bracy smiled, for she could remember instances when, after\nsuffering much at the time, she had found the affront imaginary.\n\nHe was glad of that smile, and proceeded. “You will let me speak to\nyou, as to one of my own girls? To them, I should say, use the only true\ncure. Don’t brood over vexations, small or great, but think of them as\ntrials that, borne bravely, become blessings.”\n\n“Oh! but Dr. May!” she exclaimed, shocked; “nothing in your house could\ncall for such feelings.”\n\n“I hope we are not very savage,” he said, smiling; “but, indeed, I still\nsay it is the safest rule. It would be the only one if you were really\namong unkind people; and, if you take so much to heart an unlucky\nneglect of mine, what would you do if the slight were a true one?”\n\n“You are right; but my feelings were always over-sensitive;” and this\nshe said with a sort of complacency.\n\n“Well, we must try to brace them,” said Dr. May, much as if prescribing\nfor her. “Will not you believe in our confidence and esteem, and harden\nyourself against any outward unintentional piece of incivility?”\n\nShe felt as if she could at that moment.\n\n“Or at least, try to forgive and forget them. Talking them over only\ndeepens the sense of them, and discussions do no good to any one. My\ndaughters are anxious to be your best friends, as I hope you know.”\n\n“Oh! they are most kind--”\n\n“But, you see, I must say this,” added Dr. May, somewhat hesitating, “as\nthey have no mother to--to spare all this,” and then, growing clearer,\nhe proceeded, “I must beg you to be forbearing with them, and not\nperplex yourself and them with arguing on what cannot be helped.\nThey have not the experience that could enable them to finish such a\ndiscussion without unkindness; and it can only waste the spirits, and\nraise fresh subjects of regret. I must leave you--I hear myself called.”\n\nMiss Bracy began to be sensible that she had somewhat abused\nEthel’s patience; and the unfortunate speech about the source of her\nsensitiveness did not appear to her so direfully cruel as at first.\nShe hoped every one would forget all about it, and resolved not to take\numbrage so easily another time, or else be silent about it, but she was\nnot a person of much resolution.\n\nThe doctor found that Meta Rivers and her brother had brought Flora\nhome, and were in the drawing-room, where Margaret was hearing another\nedition of the history of the fair, and a by-play was going on, of\nteasing Blanche about the chain.\n\nGeorge Rivers was trying to persuade her to make one for him; and her\nrefusal came out at last, in an almost passionate key, in the midst of\nthe other conversation--“No! I say-no!”\n\n“Another no, and that will be yes.”\n\n“No! I won’t! I don’t like you well enough!”\n\nMargaret gravely sent Blanche and the other children away to take their\nwalk, and the brother and sister soon after took leave, when Flora\ncalled Ethel to hasten to the Ladies’ Committee, that they might arrange\nthe disposal of the one hundred and fifty pounds, the amount of their\ngains.\n\n“To see the fate of Cocksmoor,” said Ethel.\n\n“Do you think I cannot manage the Stoneborough folk?” said Flora,\nlooking radiant with good humour, and conscious of power. “Poor Ethel!\nI am doing you good against your will! Never mind, here is wherewith to\nbuild the school, and the management will be too happy to fall into\nour hands. Do you think every one is as ready as you are, to walk three\nmiles and back continually?”\n\nThere was sense in this; there always was sense in what Flora said, but\nit jarred on Ethel; and it seemed almost unsympathising in her to be so\ngay, when the rest were wearied or perturbed. Ethel would have been very\nglad of a short space to recollect herself, and recover her good temper;\nbut it was late, and Flora hurried her to put on her bonnet, and come to\nthe committee. “I’ll take care of your interests,” she said, as they\nset out. “You look as doleful as if you thought you should be robbed of\nCocksmoor; but that is the last thing that will happen, you will see.”\n\n“It would not be acting fairly to let them build for us, and then for us\nto put them out of the management,” said Ethel.\n\n“My dear, they want importance, not action. They will leave the real\npower to us of themselves.”\n\n“You like to build Cocksmoor with such instruments,” said Ethel, whose\nruffled condition made her forget her resolution not to argue with\nFlora.\n\n“Bricks are made of clay!” said Flora. “There, that was said like Norman\nhimself! On your plan, we might have gone on for forty years, saving\nseven shillings a year, and spending six, whenever there was an illness\nin the place.”\n\n“You, who used to dislike these people more than even I did!” said\nEthel.\n\n“That was when I was an infant, my dear, and did not know how to deal\nwith them. I will take care--I will even save Cherry Elwood for you, if\nI can. Alan Ernescliffe’s ten pounds is a noble weapon.”\n\n“You always mean to manage everything, and then you have no time!” said\nEthel, sensible all the time of her own ill-humour, and of her sister’s\npatience and amiability, yet propelled to speak the unpleasant truths\nthat in her better moods were held back.\n\nStill Flora was good-tempered, though Ethel would almost have preferred\nher being provoked; “I know,” she said, “I have been using you ill, and\nleaving the world on your shoulders, but it was all in your service and\nCocksmoor’s; and now we shall begin to be reasonable and useful again.”\n\n“I hope so,” said Ethel.\n\n“Really, Ethel, to comfort you, I think I shall send you with Norman to\ndine at Abbotstoke Grange on Wednesday. Mr. Rivers begged us to come; he\nis so anxious to make it lively for his son.”\n\n“Thank you, I do not think Mr. George Rivers and I should be likely to\nget on together. What a bad style of wit! You heard what Mary said about\nhim? and Ethel repeated the doubt between hating and detesting.\n\n“Young men never know how to talk to little girls,” was Flora’s reply.\n\nAt this moment they came up with one of the Miss Andersons, and Flora\nbegan to exchange civilities, and talk over yesterday’s events with\ngreat animation. Her notice always gave pleasure, brightened as it was\nby the peculiarly engaging address which she had inherited from her\nfather, and which, therefore, was perfectly easy and natural. Fanny\nAnderson was flattered and gratified, rather by the manner than the\nwords, and, on excellent terms, they entered the committee-room, namely,\nthe schoolmistress’s parlour.\n\nThere were nine ladies on the committee--nine muses, as the doctor\ncalled them, because they produced anything but harmony. Mrs. Ledwich\nwas in the chair; Miss Rich was secretary, and had her pen and ink, and\naccount-book ready. Flora came in, smiling and greeting; Ethel, grave,\nearnest, and annoyed, behind her, trying to be perfectly civil, but not\nat all enjoying the congratulations on the successful bazaar. The ladies\nall talked and discussed their yesterday’s adventures, gathering in\nlittle knots, as they traced the fate of favourite achievements of their\nskill, while Ethel, lugubrious and impatient, beside Flora, the only\none not engaged, and, therefore, conscious of the hubbub of clacking\ntongues.\n\nAt last Mrs. Ledwich glanced at the mistress’s watch, in its pasteboard\ntower, in Gothic architecture, and insisted on proceeding to business.\nSo they all sat down round a circular table, with a very fine red, blue,\nand black oilcloth, whose pattern was inseparably connected, in Ethel’s\nmind, with absurdity, tedium, and annoyance.\n\nThe business was opened by the announcement of what they all knew\nbefore, that the proceeds of the fancy fair amounted to one hundred and\nforty-nine pounds fifteen shillings and tenpence.\n\nThen came a pause, and Mrs. Ledwich said that next they had to consider\nwhat was the best means of disposing of the sum gained in this most\ngratifying manner. Every one except Flora, Ethel, and quiet Mrs.\nWard, began to talk at once. There was a great deal about Elizabethan\narchitecture, crossed by much more, in which normal, industrial,\nand common things, most often met Ethel’s ear, with some stories,\nsecond-hand, from Harvey Anderson, of marvellous mistakes; and, on the\nopposite side of the table, there was Mrs. Ledwich, impressively saying\nsomething to the silent Mrs. Ward, marking her periods with emphatic\nbeats with her pencil, and each seemed to close with “Mrs. Perkinson’s\nniece,” whom Ethel knew to be Cherry’s intended supplanter. She looked\npiteously at Flora, who only smiled and made a sign with her hand to her\nto be patient. Ethel fretted inwardly at that serene sense of power; but\nshe could not but admire how well Flora knew how to bide her time, when,\nhaving waited till Mrs. Ledwich had nearly wound up her discourse on\nMrs. Elwood’s impudence, and Mrs. Perkinson’s niece, she leaned towards\nMiss Boulder, who sat between, and whispered to her, “Ask Mrs. Ledwich\nif we should not begin with some steps for getting the land.”\n\nMiss Boulder, having acted as conductor, the president exclaimed, “Just\nso, the land is the first consideration. We must at once take steps\nfor obtaining it.” Thereupon Mrs. Ledwich, who “always did things\nmethodically,” moved, and Miss Anderson seconded, that the land\nrequisite for the school must be obtained, and the nine ladies held up\ntheir hands, and resolved it.\n\nMiss Rich duly recorded the great resolution, and Miss Boulder suggested\nthat, perhaps, they might write to the National Society, or Government,\nor something; whereat Miss Rich began to flourish one of the very long\ngoose quills which stood in the inkstand before her, chiefly as insignia\nof office, for she always wrote with a small, stiff metal pen.\n\nFlora here threw in a query, whether the National Society, or\nGovernment, or something, would give them a grant, unless they had the\nland to build upon?\n\nThe ladies all started off hereupon, and all sorts of instances of\nhardness of heart were mentioned, the most relevant of which was, that\nthe Church Building Society would not give a grant to Mr. Holloway’s\nproprietary chapel at Whitford, when Mrs. Ledwich was suddenly struck\nwith the notion that dear Mr. Holloway might be prevailed on to come\nto Stoneborough to preach a sermon in the Minster, for the benefit of\nCocksmoor, when they would all hold plates at the door. Flora gave Ethel\na tranquillising pat, and, as Mrs. Ledwich turned to her, asking whether\nshe thought Dr. May, or Dr. Hoxton, would prevail on him to come, she\nsaid, with her winning look, “I think that consideration had better wait\ntill we have some more definite view. Had we not better turn to this\nland question?”\n\n“Quite true!” they all agreed, but to whom did the land belong?--and\nwhat a chorus arose! Miss Anderson thought it belonged to Mr. Nicolson,\nbecause the wagons of slate had James Nicolson on them, and, if so, they\nhad no chance, for he was an old miser--and six stories illustrative\nthereof ensued. Miss Rich was quite sure some Body held it, and\nBodies were slow of movement. Mrs. Ledwich remembered some question of\nenclosing, and thought all waste lands were under the Crown; she knew\nthat the Stoneborough people once had a right to pasture their cattle,\nbecause Mr. Southron’s cow had tumbled down a loam-pit when her mother\nwas a girl. No, that was on Far-view down, out the other way! Miss\nHarrison was positive that Sir Henry Walkinghame had some right there,\nand would not Dr. May apply to him? Mrs. Grey thought it ought to\nbe part of the Drydale estate, and Miss Boulder was certain that Mr.\nBramshaw knew all about it.\n\nFlora’s gentle voice carried conviction that she knew what she was\nsaying, when, at last, they left a moment for her to speak--(Ethel would\nhave done so long ago). “If I am not mistaken, the land is a copyhold of\nSir Henry Walkinghame, held under the manor of Drydale, which belongs to\nM---- College, and is underlet to Mr. Nicolson.”\n\nEverybody, being partially right, was delighted, and had known it all\nbefore; Miss Boulder agreed with Miss Anderson that Miss May had stated\nit as lucidly as Mr. Bramshaw could. The next question was, to whom to\napply? and, after as much as was expedient had been said in favour of\neach, it was decided that, as Sir Henry Walkinghame was abroad, no one\nknew exactly where, it would be best to go to the fountain-head, and\nwrite at once to the principal of the college. But who was to write?\nFlora proposed Mr. Ramsden as the fittest person, but this was\nnegatived. Every one declared that he would never take the trouble, and\nMiss Rich began to agitate her pens. By this time, however, Mrs. Ward,\nwho was opposite to the Gothic clock-tower, began to look uneasy, and\nsuggested, in a nervous manner, that it was half-past five, and she was\nafraid Mr. Ward would be kept waiting for his dinner. Mrs. Grey began\nto have like fears, that Mr. Grey would be come in from his ride after\nbanking hours. The other ladies began to think of tea, and the meeting\ndecided on adjourning till that day next week, when the committee would\nsit upon Miss Rich’s letter.\n\n“My dear Miss Flora!” began Miss Rich, adhering to her as they parted\nwith the rest at the end of the street, “how am I to write to a\nprincipal? Am I to begin Reverend Sir, or My Lord, or is he Venerable,\nlike an archdeacon? What is his name, and what am I to say?”\n\n“Why, it is not a correspondence much in my line,” said Flora, laughing.\n\n“Ah! but you are so intimate with Dr. Hoxton, and your brothers at\nOxford! You must know--”\n\n“I’ll take advice,” said Flora good-naturedly. “Shall I come, and call\nbefore Friday, and tell you the result?”\n\n“Oh, pray! It will be a real favour! Good-morning--”\n\n“There,” said Flora, as the sisters turned homewards, “Cherry is not\ngoing to be turned out just yet!”\n\n“How could you, Flora? Now they will have that man from Whitford, and\nyou said not a word against it!”\n\n“What was the use of adding to the hubbub? A little opposition would\nmake them determined on having him. You will see, Ethel, we shall get\nthe ground on our own terms, and then it will be time to settle about\nthe mistress. If the harvest holidays were not over, we would try to\nsend Cherry to a training-school, so as to leave them no excuse.”\n\n“I hate all this management and contrivance. It would be more honest to\nspeak our minds, and not pretend to agree with them.”\n\n“My dear Ethel! have I spoken a word contrary to my opinion? It is not\nfit for me, a girl of twenty, to go disputing and dragooning as you\nwould have me; but a little savoir faire, a grain of common sense,\nthrown in among the babble, always works. Don’t you remember how Mrs.\nWard’s sister told us that a whole crowd of tottering Chinese ladies\nwould lean on her, because they felt her firm support, though it was out\nof sight?”\n\nEthel did not answer; she had self-control enough left not to retort\nupon Flora’s estimate of herself, but the irritation was strong; she\nfelt as if her cherished views for Cocksmoor were insulted, as well as\nset aside, by the place being made the occasion of so much folly and\nvain prattle, the sanctity of her vision of self-devotion destroyed\nby such interference, and Flora’s promises did not reassure her. She\ndoubted Flora’s power, and had still more repugnance to the means\nby which her sister tried to govern; they did not seem to her\nstraightforward, and she could not endure Flora’s complacency in their\nsuccess. Had it not been for her real love for the place and people, as\nwell as the principle which prompted that love, she could have found\nit in her heart to throw up all concern with it, rather than become a\nfellow-worker with such a conclave.\n\nSuch were Ethel’s feelings as the pair walked down the street; the one\nsister bright and smiling with the good humour that had endured many\nshocks all that day, all good nature and triumph, looking forward to\nsuccess, great benefit to Cocksmoor, and plenty of management, with\ncredit and praise to herself; the other, downcast and irritable, with\nannoyance at the interference with her schemes, at the prospects of her\nschool, and at herself for being out of temper, prone to murmur or to\nreply tartly, and not able to recover from her mood, but only, as she\nneared the house, lapsing into her other trouble, and preparing to\nresist any misjudged, though kind attempt of her father, to make her\nunsay her rebuke to Miss Bracy. Pride and temper! Ah! Etheldred! where\nwere they now?\n\nDr. May was at his study door as his daughters entered the hall, and\nEthel expected the order which she meant to question; but, instead of\nthis, after a brief inquiry after the doings of the nine muses, which\nFlora answered, so as to make him laugh, he stopped Ethel, as she\nwas going upstairs, by saying, “I do not know whether this letter is\nintended for Richard, or for me. At any rate, it concerns you most.”\n\nThe envelope was addressed to the Reverend Richard May, D. D., Market\nStoneborough, and the letter began, “Reverend Sir.” So far Ethel saw,\nand exclaimed, with amusement, then, with a long-drawn “Ah!” and\nan interjection, “My poor dear Una!” she became absorbed, the large\ntears--yes, Ethel’s reluctant tears gathering slowly and dropping.\n\nThe letter was from a clergyman far away in the north of England, who\nsaid he could not, though a stranger, resist the desire to send to\nDr. May an account of a poor girl, who seemed to have received great\nbenefits from him, or from some of his family, especially as she had\nshown great eagerness on his proposing to write.\n\nHe said it was nearly a year since there had come into his parish a\ntroop of railwaymen and their families. For the most part, they were\ncompletely wild and rude, unused to any pastoral care; but, even on\nthe first Sunday, he had noticed a keen-looking, freckled, ragged,\nunmistakably Irish girl, creeping into church with a Prayer-book in her\nhand, and had afterwards found her hanging about the door of the school.\n“I never saw a more engaging, though droll, wild expression, than that\nwith which she looked up to me.” (Ethel’s cry of delight was at that\nsentence--she knew that look too well, and had yearned after it so\noften!) “I found her far better instructed than her appearance had led\nme to expect, and more truly impressed with the spirit of what she had\nlearned than it has often been my lot to find children. She was perfect\nin the New Testament history”--(“Ah! that she was not, when she went\naway!”)--“and was in the habit of constantly attending church, and using\nmorning and evening prayers.” (“Oh! how I longed, when she went away, to\nbeg her to keep them up! Dear Una.”) “On my questions, as to how she had\nbeen taught, she always replied, ‘Mr. Richard May,’ or ‘Miss Athel.’ You\nmust excuse me if I have not correctly caught the name from her Irish\npronunciation.” (“I am afraid he thinks my name is Athaliah! But oh!\nthis dear girl! How I have wished to hear of her!”) “Everything was\nanswered with ‘Mr. Richard,’ or ‘Miss Athel’; and, if I inquired\nfurther, her face would light up with a beam of gratitude, and she would\nrun on, as long as I could listen, with instances of their kindness. It\nwas the same with her mother, a wild, rude specimen of an Irishwoman,\nwhom I never could bring to church herself, but who ran on loudly with\ntheir praises, usually ending with ‘Heavens be their bed,’ and saying\nthat Una had been quite a different girl since the young ladies and\ngentleman found her out, and put them parables in her head.\n\n“For my own part, I can testify that, in the seven months that she\nattended my school, I never had a serious fault to find with her, but\nfar more often to admire the earnestness and devout spirit, as well as\nthe kindness and generosity apparent in all her conduct. Bad living, and\nan unwholesome locality, have occasioned a typhus fever among the poor\nstrangers in this place, and Una was one of the first victims. Her\nmother, almost from the first, gave her up, saying she knew she was one\nmarked for glory; and Una has been lying, day after day, in a sort\nof half-delirious state, constantly repeating hymns and psalms, and\ngenerally, apparently very happy, except when one distress occurred\nagain and again, whether delirious or sensible, namely, that she had\nnever gone to wish Miss May good-bye, and thank her; and that maybe she\nand Mr. Richard thought her ungrateful; and she would sometimes beg, in\nher phraseology, to go on her bare knees to Stoneborough, only to see\nMiss Athel again.\n\n“Her mother, I should say, told me the girl had been half mad at not\nbeing allowed to go and take leave of Miss May; and she had been sorry\nherself, but her husband had come home suddenly from the search for\nwork, and, having made his arrangements, removed them at once, early the\nnext morning--too early to go to the young lady; though, she said, Una\ndid--as they passed through Stoneborough--run down the street before she\nwas aware, and she found her sobbing, fit to break her heart, before the\nhouse.” (“Oh, why, why was I not up, and at the window! Oh, my Una! to\nthink of that!”) “When I spoke of writing to let Miss May hear how\nit was, the poor girl caught at the idea with the utmost delight. Her\nweakness was too great to allow her to utter many words distinctly,\nwhen I asked her what she would have me say, but these were as well as\nI could understand:--‘The blessing of one, that they have brought peace\nunto. Tell them I pray, and will pray, that they may walk in the robe\nof glory--and tell Mr. Richard that I mind what he said to me, of taking\nhold on the sure hope. God crown all their crosses unto them, and fulfil\nall their desires unto everlasting life.’ I feel that I am not rendering\nher words with all their fervour and beauty of Irish expression, but I\nwould that I could fully retain and transmit them, for those who have so\nled her must, indeed, be able to feel them precious. I never saw a\nmore peaceful frame of penitence and joy. She died last night, sleeping\nherself away, without more apparent suffering, and will be committed\nto the earth on Sunday next, all her fellow-scholars attending; and, I\nhope, profiting by the example she has left.\n\n“I have only to add my most earnest congratulations to those whose\nlabour of love has borne such blessed fruit; and, hoping you will pardon\nthe liberty, etc.”\n\nEtheldred finished the letter through blinding tears, while rising sobs\nalmost choked her. She ran away to her own room, bolted the door, and\nthrew herself on her knees, beside her bed--now confusedly giving thanks\nfor such results--now weeping bitterly over her own unworthiness. Oh!\nwhat was she in the sight of Heaven, compared with what this poor girl\nhad deemed her--with what this clergyman thought her? She, the teacher,\ntaught, trained, and guarded, from her infancy, by her wise mother, and\nby such a father! She, to have given way all day to pride, jealousy,\nanger, selfish love of her own will; when this poor girl had embraced,\nand held fast, the blessed hope, from the very crumbs they had brought\nher! Nothing could have so humbled the distrustful spirit that had been\nworking in Ethel, which had been scotched into silence--not killed--when\nshe endured the bazaar, and now had been indemnifying itself by repining\nat every stumbling-block. Her own scholar’s blessing was the rebuke that\nwent most home to her heart, for having doubted whether good could be\nworked in any way, save her own.\n\nShe was interrupted by Mary trying to open the door, and, admitting\nher, heard her wonder at the traces of her tears, and ask what there\nwas about Una. Ethel gave her the letter, and Mary’s tears showered very\nfast--they always came readily. “Oh, Ethel, how glad Richard will be!”\n\n“Yes; it is all Richard’s doing. So much more good, and wise, and\nhumble, as he is. No wonder his teaching--” and Ethel sat down and cried\nagain.\n\nMary pondered. “It makes me very glad,” she said; “and yet I don’t know\nwhy one cries. Ethel, do you think”--she came near, and whispered--“that\nUna has met dear mamma there?”\n\nEthel kissed her. It was almost the first time Mary had spoken of her\nmother; and she answered, “Dear Mary, we cannot tell--we may think. It\nis all one communion, you know.”\n\nMary was silent, and, next time she spoke, it was to hope that Ethel\nwould tell the Cocksmoor children about Una.\n\nEthel was obliged to dress, and go downstairs to tea. Her father seemed\nto have been watching for her, with his study door open, for he came\nto meet her, took her hand, and said, in a low voice, “My dear child, I\nwish you joy. This will be a pleasant message, to bid poor Ritchie good\nspeed for his ordination, will it not?”\n\n“That it will, papa--”\n\n“Why, Ethel, have you been crying over it all this time?” said he,\nstruck by the sadness of her voice.\n\n“Many other things, papa. I am so unworthy--but it was not our\ndoing--but the grace--”\n\n“No, but thankful you may be, to have been the means of awakening the\ngrace!”\n\nEthel’s lips trembled. “And oh, papa! coming to-day, when I have been\nbehaving so ill to you, and Miss Bracy, and Flora, and all.\n\n“Have you? I did not know you had behaved ill to me.”\n\n“About Miss Bracy--I thought wrong things, if I did not say them. To\nher, I believe, I said what was true, though it was harsh of me to say\nit, and--”\n\n“What? about pride and temper? It was true, and I hope it will do her\ngood. Cure a piping turkey with a peppercorn sometimes. I have spoken to\nher, and told her to pluck up a little spirit; not fancy affronts, and\nnot to pester you with them. Poor child! you have been sadly victimised\nto-day and yesterday. No wonder you were bored past patience, with that\nabsurd rabble of women!”\n\n“It was all my own selfish, distrustful temper, wanting to have\nCocksmoor taken care of in my own way, and angry at being interfered\nwith. I see it now--and here this poor girl, that I thought thrown\naway--”\n\n“Ay, Ethel, you will often see the like. The main object may fail or\nfall short, but the earnest painstaking will always be blessed some way\nor other, and where we thought it most wasted, some fresh green shoot\nwill spring up, to show it is not we that give the increase. I suppose\nyou will write to Richard with this?”\n\n“That I shall.”\n\n“Then you may send this with it. Tell him my arm is tired and stiff\nto-day, or I would have said more. He must answer the clergyman’s\nletter.”\n\nDr. May gave Ethel his sheet not folded. His written words were now so\nfew as to be cherished amongst his children.\n\n\n“Dear Richard,--\n\n“May all your ministerial works be as blessed as this, your first labour\nof love. I give you hearty joy of this strengthening blessing. Mine goes\nwith it--‘Only be strong and of a good courage!’\n\n                    “Your affectionate father,\n                             R. May.\n\n“PS.--Margaret does not gain ground this summer; you must soon come home\nand cheer her.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n\n     As late, engaged by fancy’s dream,\n     I lay beside a rapid stream,\n     I saw my first come gliding by,\n     Its airy form soon caught my eye;\n     Its texture frail, and colour various,\n     Like human hopes, and life precarious.\n     Sudden, my second caught my ear,\n     And filled my soul with constant fear;\n     I quickly rose, and home I ran,\n     My whole was hissing in the pan.--Riddle.\n\n\nFlora revised the letter to the principal, and the Ladies’ Committee\napproved, after having proposed seven amendments, all of which Flora\ncaused to topple over by their own weakness.\n\nAfter interval sufficient to render the nine ladies very anxious, the\nprincipal wrote from Scotland, where he was spending the Long Vacation,\nand informed them that their request should be laid before the next\ncollege meeting.\n\nAfter the committee had sat upon this letter, the two sisters walked\nhome in much greater harmony than after the former meeting. Etheldred\nhad recovered her candour, and was willing to own that it was not art,\nbut good sense, that gave her sister so much ascendancy. She began to be\nhopeful, and to declare that Flora might yet do something even with the\nladies. Flora was gratified by the approval that no one in the house\ncould help valuing; “Positively,” said Flora, “I believe I may in time.\nYou see there are different ways of acting, as an authority, or as an\nequal.”\n\n“The authority can move from without, the equal must from within,” said\nEthel.\n\n“Just so. We must circumvent their prejudices, instead of trying to beat\nthem down.”\n\n“If you only could have the proper catechising restored!”\n\n“Wait; you will see. Let me feel my ground.”\n\n“Or if we could only abdicate into the hands of the rightful power!”\n\n“The rightful power would not be much obliged to you.”\n\n“That is the worst of it,” said Ethel. “It is sad to hear the sick\npeople say that Dr. May is more to them than any parson; it shows that\nthey have so entirely lost the notion of what their clergyman should\nbe.”\n\n“Dr. May is the man most looked up to in this town,” said Flora, “and\nthat gives weight to us in the committee, but it is all in the using.”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel hesitatingly.\n\n“You see, we have the prestige of better birth, and better education,\nas well as of having the chief property in the town, and of being the\nlargest subscribers, added to his personal character,” said Flora;\n“so that everything conspires to render us leaders, and our age alone\nprevented us from assuming our post sooner.”\n\nThey were at home by this time, and entering the hall, perceived that\nthe whole party were in the lawn. The consolation of the children\nfor the departure of Hector and Tom, was a bowl of soap-suds and some\ntobacco pipes, and they had collected the house to admire and assist,\neven Margaret’s couch being drawn close to the window.\n\nBubbles is one of the most fascinating of sports. There is the soft\nfoamy mass, like driven snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche bends down\nto blow “a honeycomb,” holding the bowl of the pipe in the water; at her\ngurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger, clearer\nbubbles, each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow\ntints, until Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand,\nand Mary pronounces it stiff enough, and presents a pipe to little\nDaisy, who, drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it away with a\ngrimace, and declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands\nwith swelled cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity.\nOut pours a confused assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly\nexpands the little branching veins, flowing down on either side, bearing\nan enlarging miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree. Aubrey\npauses to exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary\ncalls it, a peacock, in blended pink and green, is this transparent\nsphere, reflecting and embellishing house, wall, and shrubs! It is\ntoo beautiful! It is gone! Mary undertakes to give a lesson, and\nblows deliberately without the slightest result. Again! She waves\nher disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach\nthemselves, and float off on the summer breeze, with a tardy, graceful,\nuncertain motion. Daisy rushes after them, catches at them, and looks\nat her empty fingers with a puzzled “All gone!” as plainly expressed by\nToby, who snaps at them, and shakes his head with offended dignity at\nthe shock of his meeting teeth, while the kitten frisks after them,\nstriking at them with her paw, amazed at meeting vacancy.\n\nEven the grave Norman is drawn in. He agrees with Mary that bubbles\nused to fly over the wall, and that one once went into Mrs. Richardson’s\ngarret window, when her housemaid tried to catch it with a pair of\ntongs, and then ran downstairs screaming that there was a ghost in her\nroom; but that was in Harry’s time, the heroic age of the May nursery.\n\nHe accepts a pipe, and his greater height raises it into a favourable\ncurrent of air--the glistening balloon sails off. It flies, it soars;\nno, it is coming down! The children shout at it, as if to drive it up,\nbut it wilfully descends--they rush beneath, they try to waft it on high\nwith their breath--there is a collision between Mary and Blanche--Aubrey\nperceives a taste of soapy water--the bubble is no more--it is vanished\nin his open mouth!\n\nPapa himself has taken a pipe, and the little ones are mounted on\nchairs, to be on a level with their tall elders. A painted globe is\nswimming along, hesitating at first, but the dancing motion is tending\nupwards, the rainbow tints glisten in the sunlight--all rush to assist\nit; if breath of the lips can uphold it, it should rise, indeed!\nUp! above the wall! over Mrs. Richardson’s elm, over the topmost\nbranch--hurrah! out of sight! Margaret adds her voice to the\nacclamations. Beat that if you can, Mary! That doubtful wind keeps yours\nsuspended in a graceful minuet; its pace is accelerated--but earthwards!\nit has committed self-destruction by running foul of a rose-bush. A\ngeneral blank!\n\n“You here, Ethel?” said Norman, as the elders laughed at each other’s\nbaffled faces.\n\n“I am more surprised to find you here,” she answered.\n\n“Excitement!” said Norman, smiling; “one cause is as good as another for\nit.”\n\n“Very pretty sport,” said Dr. May. “You should write a poem on it,\nNorman.”\n\n“It is an exhausted subject,” said Norman; “bubble and trouble are too\nobvious a rhyme.”\n\n“Ha! there it goes! It will be over the house! That’s right!” Every one\njoined in the outcry.\n\n“Whose is it?”\n\n“Blanche’s--”\n\n“Hurrah for Blanche! Well done, white Mayflower, there!” said the\ndoctor, “that is what I meant. See the applause gained by a proud bubble\nthat flies! Don’t we all bow down to it, and waft it up with the whole\nforce of our lungs, air as it is; and when it fairly goes out of sight,\nis there any exhilaration or applause that surpasses ours?”\n\n“The whole world being bent on making painted bubbles fly over the\nhouse,” said Norman, far more thoughtfully than his father. “It is a\nfair pattern of life and fame.”\n\n“I was thinking,” continued Dr. May, “what was the most unalloyed\nexultation I remember.”\n\n“Harry’s, when you were made dux,” whispered Ethel to her brother.\n\n“Not mine,” said Norman briefly.\n\n“I believe,” said Dr. May, “I never knew such glorification as when\nAubrey Spencer climbed the poor old market-cross. We all felt ourselves\nmade illustrious for ever in his person.”\n\n“Nay, papa, when you got that gold medal must have been the grandest\ntime?” said Blanche, who had been listening.\n\nDr. May laughed, and patted her. “I, Blanche? Why, I was excessively\namazed, that is all, not in Norman’s way, but I had been doing next to\nnothing to the very last, then fell into an agony, and worked like a\nhorse, thinking myself sure of failure, and that my mother and my uncle\nwould break their hearts.”\n\n“But when you heard that you had it?” persisted Blanche.\n\n“Why, then I found I must be a much cleverer fellow than I thought for!”\n said he, laughing; “but I was ashamed of myself, and of the authorities,\nfor choosing such an idle dog, and vexed that other plodding lads missed\nit, who deserved it more than I.”\n\n“Of course,” said Norman, in a low voice, “that is what one always\nfeels. I had rather blow soap-bubbles!”\n\n“Where was Dr. Spencer?” asked Ethel.\n\n“Not competing. He had been ready a year before, and had gained it, or\nI should have had no chance. Poor Spencer! what would I not give to see\nhim, or hear of him?”\n\n“The last was--how long ago?” said Ethel.\n\n“Six years, when he was setting off, to return from Poonshedagore,” said\nDr. May, sighing. “I gave him up; his health was broken, and there was\nno one to look after him. He was the sort of man to have a nameless\ngrave, and a name too blessed for fame.”\n\nEthel would have asked further of her father’s dear old friend, but\nthere were sounds, denoting an arrival, and Margaret beckoned to them\nas Miss Rivers and her brother were ushered into the drawing-room; and\nBlanche instantly fled away, with her basin, to hide herself in the\nschoolroom.\n\nMeta skipped out, and soon was established on the grass, an attraction\nto all the live creatures, as it seemed; for the kitten came, and was\ncaressed till her own graceful Nipen was ready to fight with the uncouth\nToby for the possession of a resting-place on the skirt of her habit,\nwhile Daisy nestled up to her, as claiming a privilege, and Aubrey kept\nguard over the dogs.\n\nMeta inquired after a huge doll--Dr. Hoxton’s gift to Daisy, at the\nbazaar.\n\n“She is in Margaret’s wardrobe,” was the answer, “because Aubrey tied\nher hands behind her, and was going to offer her up on the nursery\ngrate.”\n\n“Oh, Aubrey, that was too cruel!”\n\n“No,” returned Aubrey; “she was Iphigenia, going to be sacrificed.”\n\n“Mary unconsciously acted Diana,” said Ethel, “and bore the victim\naway.”\n\n“Pray, was Daisy a willing Clytemnestra?” asked Meta.\n\n“Oh, yes, she liked it,” said Aubrey, while Meta looked discomfited.\n\n“I never could get proper respect paid to dolls,” said Margaret; “we\ndeal too much in their natural enemies.”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel, “my only doll was like a heraldic lion, couped in all\nher parts.”\n\n“Harry and Tom once made a general execution,” said Flora; “there was a\ndoll hanging to every baluster--the number made up with rag.”\n\nGeorge Rivers burst out laughing--his first sign of life; and Meta\nlooked as if she had heard of so many murders.\n\n“I can’t help feeling for a doll!” she said. “They used to be like\nsisters to me. I feel as if they were wasted on children, that see no\ncharacter in them, and only call them Dolly.”\n\n“I agree with you,” said Margaret. “If there had been no live dolls,\nRichard and I should have reared our doll family as judiciously as\ntenderly. There are treasures of carpentry still extant, that he made\nfor them.”\n\n“Oh, I am so glad!” cried Meta, as if she had found another point of\nunion. “If I were to confess--there is a dear old Rose in the secret\nrecesses of my wardrobe. I could as soon throw away my sister--”\n\n“Ha!” cried her brother, laying hold of the child, “here, little Daisy,\nwill you give your doll to Meta?”\n\n“My name is Gertrude Margaret May,” said the little round mouth. The\nfat arm was drawn back, with all a baby’s dignity, and the rosy face was\nhidden in Dr. May’s breast, at the sound of George Rivers’s broad laugh\nand “Well done, little one!”\n\nDr. May put his arm round her, turned aside from him, and began talking\nto Meta about Mr. Rivers.\n\nFlora and Norman made conversation for the brother; and he presently\nasked Norman to go out shooting with him, but looked so amazed on\nhearing that Norman was no sportsman that Flora tried to save the family\ncredit by mentioning Hector’s love of a gun, which caused their guest to\nmake a general tender of sporting privileges; “Though,” added he, with a\ndrawl, “shooting is rather a nuisance, especially alone.”\n\nMeta told Ethel, a little apart, that he was so tired of going out\nalone, that he had brought her here, in search of a companion.\n\n“He comes in at eleven o’clock, poor fellow, quite tired with solitude,”\n said she, “and comes to me to be entertained.”\n\n“Indeed,” exclaimed Ethel. “What can you do?”\n\n“What I can,” said Meta, laughing. “Whatever is not ‘a horrid nuisance’\nto him.”\n\n“It would be a horrid nuisance to me,” said Ethel bluntly, “if my\nbrothers wanted me to amuse them all the morning.”\n\n“Your brothers, oh!” said Meta, as if that were very different;\n“besides, you have so much more to do. I am only too glad and grateful\nwhen George will come to me at all. You see I have always been too young\nto be his companion, or find out what suited him, and now he is so very\nkind and good-natured to me.”\n\n“But what becomes of your business?”\n\n“I get time, one way or another. There is the evening, very often, when\nI have sung both him and papa to sleep. I had two hours, all to myself,\nyesterday night,” said Meta, with a look of congratulation, “and I had a\nfamous reading of Thirlwall’s ‘Greece.’”\n\n“I should think that such evenings were as bad as the mornings.”\n\n“Come, Ethel, don’t make me naughty. Large families, like yours, may\nhave merry, sociable evenings; but, I do assure you, ours are very\npleasant. We are so pleased to have George at home; and we really\nhope that he is taking a fancy to the dear Grange. You can’t think how\ndelighted papa is to have him content to stay quietly with us so long. I\nmust call him to go back now, though, or papa will be kept waiting.”\n\nWhen Ethel had watched the tall, ponderous brother help the bright fairy\nsister to fly airily into her saddle, and her sparkling glance, and wave\nof the hand, as she cantered off, contrasting with his slow bend,\nand immobility of feature, she could not help saying that Meta’s life\ncertainly was not too charming, with her fanciful, valetudinarian\nfather, and that stupid, idealess brother.\n\n“He is very amiable and good-natured,” interposed Norman.\n\n“Ha! Norman, you are quite won by his invitation to shoot! How he\ndespised you for refusing--as much as you despised him.”\n\n“Speak for yourself,” said Norman. “You fancy no sensible man likes\nshooting, but you are all wrong. Some of our best men are capital\nsportsmen. Why, there is Ogilvie--you know what he is. When I bring him\ndown here, you will see that there is no sort of sport that he is not\nkeen after.”\n\n“This poor fellow will never be keen after anything,” said Dr. May. “I\npity him! Existence seems hard work to him!”\n\n“We shall have baby calling him ‘the detestable’ next,” said Ethel.\n“What a famous set down she gave him.”\n\n“She is a thorough lady, and allows no liberties,” said Dr. May.\n\n“Ah!” said Margaret, “it is a proof of what I want to impression you. We\nreally must leave off calling her Daisy when strangers are there.”\n\n“It is so much nicer,” pleaded Mary.\n\n“The very reason,” said Margaret, “fondling names should be kept for our\ninnermost selves, not spread abroad, and made common. I remember when I\nused to be called Peg-top--and Flora, Flossy--we were never allowed to\nuse the names when any visitor was near; and we were asked if we could\nnot be as fond of each other by our proper names. I think it was felt\nthat there was a want of reserve in publishing our pet words to other\npeople.”\n\n“Quite true,” said Dr. May; “baby-names never ought to go beyond home.\nIt is the fashion to use them now; and, besides the folly, it seems, to\nme, an absolute injury to a girl, to let her grow up, with a nickname\nattached to her.”\n\n“Ay!” chimed in Norman, “I hear men talking of Henny, and Loo, and the\nlike; and you can’t think how glad I have been that my sisters could not\nbe known by any absurd word!”\n\n“It is a case where self-respect would make others behave properly,”\n said Flora.\n\n“True,” said Dr. May; “but if girls won’t keep up their own dignity,\ntheir friends’ duty is to do it for them. The mischief is in the\nintimate friends, who blazon the words to every one.”\n\n“And then they call one formal, for trying to protect the right\nname,” said Flora. “It is, one-half of it, silliness, and, the other,\naffectation of intimacy.”\n\n“Now, I know,” said Mary, “why you are so careful to call Meta Miss\nRivers, to all the people here.”\n\n“I should hope so!” cried Norman indignantly.\n\n“Why, yes, Mary,” said Margaret, “I should hope lady-like feelings would\nprevent you from calling her Meta before--”\n\n“The Andersons!” cried Ethel, laughing. “Margaret was just going to\nsay it. We only want Harry, to exact the forfeit! Poor dear little\nhumming-bird! It gives one an oppression on the chest, to think of her\nhaving that great do-nothing brother on her hands all day.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Norman, “I shall know where I am not to look when I\nwant a sister.”\n\n“Ay,” said Ethel, “when you come yawning to me to find amusement for\nyou, you will see what I shall do!”\n\n“Stand over me with a stick while I print A B C for Cocksmoor, I\nsuppose,” said Norman.\n\n“Well! why not? People are much better doing something than nothing.”\n\n“What, you won’t even let me blow bubbles!” said Norman.\n\n“That is too intellectual, as papa makes it,” said Ethel. “By the bye,\nNorman,” she added, as she had now walked with him a little apart, “it\nalways was a bubble of mine that you should try for the Newdigate prize.\nHa!” as the colour rushed into his cheeks, “you really have begun!”\n\n“I could not help it, when I heard the subject given out for next year.\nOur old friend, Decius Mus.”\n\n“Have you finished?”\n\n“By no means, but it brought a world of notions into my head, such as I\ncould not but set down. Now, Ethel, do oblige me, do write another, as\nwe used in old times.”\n\n“I had better not,” said Ethel, standing thoughtful. “If I throw\nmyself into it, I shall hate everything else, and my wits will be\nwoolgathering. I have neither time nor poetry enough.”\n\n“You used to write English verse.”\n\n“I was cured of it.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“I wanted money for Cocksmoor, and after persuading papa, I got leave\nto send a ballad about a little girl and a white rose to that school\nmagazine. I don’t think papa liked it, but there were some verses that\ntouched him, and one had seen worse. It was actually inserted, and I was\nin high feather, till, oh, Norman! imagine Richard getting hold of this\nunlucky thing, without a notion where it came from! Margaret put it\nbefore him, to see what he would say to it.”\n\n“I am afraid it was not like a young lady’s anonymous composition in a\nstory.”\n\n“By no means. Imagine Ritchie picking my poor metaphors to pieces, and\nweighing every sentimental line! And all in his dear old simplicity,\nbecause he wanted to understand it, seeing that Margaret liked it. He\nhad not the least intention of hurting my feelings, but never was I\nso annihilated! I thought he was doing it on purpose, till I saw how\ndistressed he was when he found it out; and worse than all was, his\nsaying at the end that he supposed it was very fine, but he could not\nunderstand it.”\n\n“Let me see it.”\n\n“Some time or other; but let me see Decius.”\n\n“Did you give up verses because Richard could not understand them?”\n\n“No; because I had other fish to fry. And I have not given them up\naltogether. I do scrabble down things that tease me by running in my\nhead, when I want to clear my brains, and know what I mean; but I\ncan’t do it without sitting up at night, and that stupefies me before\nbreakfast. And as to making bubbles of them, Ritchie has cured me of\nthat!”\n\n“It is a pity!” said Norman.\n\n“Nonsense, let me see Decius. I know he is splendid.”\n\n“I wish you would have tried, for all my best ideas are stolen from\nyou.”\n\nEthel prevailed by following her brother to his room, and perching\nherself on the window-sill, while he read his performance from many\nslips of paper. The visions of those boyish days had not been forgotten,\nthe Vesuvius scenery was much as Ethel had once described it, but with\nfar more force and beauty; there was Decius’s impassioned address to the\nbeauteous land he was about to leave, and the remembrances of his Roman\nhearth, his farm, his children, whom he quitted for the pale shadows of\nan uncertain Elysium. There was a great hiatus in the middle, and Norman\nhad many more authorities to consult, but the summing-up was nearly\ncomplete, and Ethel thought the last lines grand, as they spoke of the\nnoble consul’s name living for evermore, added to the examples that\nnerve ardent souls to devote life, and all that is precious, to the call\nof duty. Fame is not their object. She may crown their pale brows, but\nfor the good of others, not their own, a beacon light to the world. Self\nis no object of theirs, and it is the casting self behind that wins--not\nalways the visible earthly strife, but the combat between good and evil.\nThey are the true victors, and, whether chronicled or forgotten, true\nglory rests on their heads, the sole true glory that man can attain,\nnamely, the reflected beams that crown them as shadowy types of Him whom\nDecius knew not--the Prince who gave Himself for His people, and thus\nrendered death, for Truth’s sake, the highest boon to mortal man.\n\n“Norman, you must finish it! When will it be given in?”\n\n“Next spring, if at all, but keep the secret, Ethel. I cannot have my\nfather’s hopes raised.”\n\n“I’ll tell you of a motto,” said Ethel. “Do you remember Mrs. Hemans’\nmention of a saying of Sir Walter Scott--‘Never let me hear that brave\nblood has been shed in vain. It sends a roaring voice down through all\ntime.’”\n\n“If,” said Norman, rather ashamed of the enthusiasm which, almost\napproaching to the so-called “funny state” of his younger days, had\ntrembled in his voice, and kindled his eye--“if you won’t let me put\n‘nascitur ridiculus mus.’”\n\n“Too obvious,” said Ethel. “Depend upon it, every undergraduate has\nthought of it already.”\n\nEthel was always very happy over Norman’s secrets, and went about\nsmiling over Decius, and comparing her brother with such a one as poor\nMeta was afflicted with; wasting some superfluous pity and contempt on\nthe weary weight that was inflicted on the Grange.\n\n“What do you think of me?” said Margaret, one afternoon. “I have had Mr.\nGeorge Rivers here for two hours.”\n\n“Alone! what could bring him here?”\n\n“I told him that every one was out, but he chose to sit down, and seemed\nto be waiting.”\n\n“How could you get on?”\n\n“Oh! we asked a few questions, and brought out remarks, with great\ndifficulty, at long intervals. He asked me if lying here was not a great\nnuisance, and, at last, he grew tired of twisting his moustache, and\nwent away.”\n\n“I trust it was a call to take leave.”\n\n“No, he thinks he shall sell out, for the army is a great nuisance.”\n\n“You seem to have got into his confidence.”\n\n“Yes, he said he wanted to settle down, but living with one’s father was\nsuch a nuisance.”\n\n“By the bye,” cried Ethel, laughing, “Margaret, it strikes me that this\nis a Dumbiedikes’ courtship!”\n\n“Of yourself?” said Margaret slyly.\n\n“No, of Flora. You know, she has often met him at the Grange and\nother places, and she does contrive to amuse him, and make him almost\nanimated. I should not think he found her a great nuisance.”\n\n“Poor man! I am sorry for him!” said Margaret.\n\n“Oh! rejection will be very good for him, and give him something to\nthink of.”\n\n“Flora will never let it come to that,” said Margaret. “But not one word\nabout it, Ethel!”\n\nMargaret and Etheldred kept their eyes open, and sometimes imagined,\nsometimes laughed at themselves for their speculations, and so October\nbegan; and Ethel laughed, as she questioned whether the Grange would\nfeel the Hussar’s return to his quarters, as much as home would the\ndeparture of their scholar for Balliol.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\n\n     So, Lady Flora, take my lay,\n       And if you find a meaning there,\n     Oh! whisper to your glass, and say,\n       What wonder, if he thinks me fair.--Tennyson.\n\n\nFlora and Norman were dining with one of their county acquaintance, and\nDr. May had undertaken to admit them on their return. The fire shone red\nand bright, as it sank calmly away, and the timepiece and clock on the\nstairs had begun their nightly duet of ticking, the crickets chirped in\nthe kitchen, and the doctor sat alone. His book lay with unturned pages,\nas he sat musing, with eyes fixed on the fire, living over again his own\nlife, the easy bright days of his youth, when, without much pains on his\nown part, the tendencies of his generous affectionate disposition,\nand the influences of a warm friendship, and an early attachment, had\nguarded him from evil--then the period when he had been perfectly happy,\nand the sobering power of his position had been gradually working\non him; but though always religious and highly principled, the very\ngoodness of his natural character preventing him from perceiving the\nneed of self-control, until the shock that changed the whole tenor\nof his life, and left him, for the first time, sensible of his own\nresponsibility, but with inveterate habits of heedlessness and hastiness\nthat love alone gave him force to combat. He was now a far gentler man.\nHis younger children had never seen, his elder had long since forgotten,\nhis occasional bursts of temper, but he suffered keenly from their\neffects, especially as regarded some of his children. Though Richard’s\ntimidity had been overcome, and Tom’s more serious failures had been\nremedied, he was not without anxiety, and had a strange unsatisfactory\nfeeling as regarded Flora. He could not feel that he fathomed her! She\nreminded him of his old Scottish father-in-law, Professor Mackenzie,\nwhom he had never understood, nor, if the truth were known, liked. Her\ndealings with the Ladies’ Committee were so like her grandfather’s canny\nways in a public meeting, that he laughed over them--but they were\nnot congenial to him. Flora was a most valuable person; all that she\nundertook prospered, and he depended entirely on her for household\naffairs, and for the care of Margaret; but, highly as he esteemed her,\nhe was a little afraid of her cool prudence; she never seemed to be\nin any need of him, nor to place any confidence in him, and seemed\naltogether so much older and wiser than he could feel himself--pretty\ngirl as she was--and very pretty were her fine blue eyes and clear skin,\nset off by her dark brown hair. There arose the vision of eyes as blue,\nskin as clear, but of light blonde locks, and shorter, rounder, more\ndove-like form, open, simple, loving face, and serene expression, that\nhad gone straight to his heart, when he first saw Maggie Mackenzie\nmaking tea.\n\nHe heard the wheels, and went out to unbolt the door. Those were a pair\nfor a father to be proud of--Norman, of fine stature and noble looks,\nwith his high brow, clear thoughtful eye, and grave intellectual eagle\nface, lighting into animation with his rare, sweet smile; and Flora, so\ntall and graceful, and in her white dress, picturesquely half concealed\nby her mantle, with flowers in her hair, and a deepened colour in her\ncheek, was a fair vision, as she came in from the darkness.\n\n“Well! was it a pleasant party?”\n\nNorman related the circumstances, while his sister remained silently\nleaning against the mantel-piece, looking into the fire, until he took\nup his candle, and bade them good-night. Dr. May was about to do the\nsame, when she held out her hand. “One moment, if you please, dear\npapa,” she said; “I think you ought to know it.”\n\n“What, my dear?”\n\n“Mr. George Rivers, papa--”\n\n“Ha!” said Dr. May, beginning to smile. “So that is what he is at, is\nit? But what an opportunity to take.”\n\n“It was in the conservatory,” said Flora, a little hurt, as her father\ndiscovered by her tone. “The music was going on, and I don’t know that\nthere could have been--”\n\n“A better opportunity, eh?” said Dr. May, laughing; “well, I should have\nthought it awkward; was he very much discomposed?”\n\n“I thought,” said Flora, looking down and hesitating, “that he had\nbetter come to you.”\n\n“Indeed! so you shifted the ungracious office to me. I am very glad to\nspare you, my dear; but it was hard on him to raise his hopes.”\n\n“I thought,” faltered Flora, “that you could not disapprove--”\n\n“Flora--” and he paused, completely confounded, while his daughter was\nno less surprised at the manner in which her news was received. Each\nwaited for the other to speak, and Flora turned away, resting her head\nagainst the mantel-piece.\n\n“Surely,” said he, laying his hand on her shoulder, “you do not mean\nthat you like this man?”\n\n“I did not think that you would be against it,” said Flora, in a choked\nvoice, her face still averted.\n\n“Heaven knows, I would not be against anything for your happiness, my\ndear,” he answered; “but have you considered what it would be to spend\nyour life with a man that has not three ideas! not a resource for\noccupying himself--a regular prey to ennui--one whom you could never\nrespect!” He had grown more and more vehement, and Flora put her\nhandkerchief to her eyes, for tears of actual disappointment were\nflowing.\n\n“Come, come,” he said, touched, but turning it off by a smile, “we will\nnot talk of it any more to-night. It is your first offer, and you are\nflattered, but we know\n\n             “‘Colours seen by candle-light,\n              Will not bear the light of day.’\n\n“There, good-night, Flora, my dear--we will have a-tete-a-tete in the\nstudy before breakfast, when you have had time to look into your own\nmind.”\n\nHe kissed her affectionately, and went upstairs with her, stopping at\nher door to give her another embrace, and to say “Bless you, my dear\nchild, and help you to come to a right decision--”\n\nFlora was disappointed. She had been too highly pleased at her conquest\nto make any clear estimation of the prize, individually considered. Her\nvanity magnified her achievement, and she had come home in a flutter of\npleasure, at having had such a position in society offered to her, and\nexpecting that her whole family would share her triumph. Gratified\nby George Rivers’s admiration, she regarded him with favour and\ncomplacency; and her habit of considering herself as the most sensible\nperson in her sphere made her so regard his appreciation of her, that\nshe was blinded to his inferiority. It must be allowed that he was less\ndull with her than with most others.\n\nAnd, in the midst of her glory, when she expected her father to be\ndelighted and grateful--to be received as a silly girl, ready to accept\nany proposal, her lover spoken of with scorn, and the advantages of the\nmatch utterly passed over, was almost beyond endurance. A physician,\nwith eleven children dependent on his practice, to despise an offer\nfrom the heir of such a fortune! But that was his customary romance!\nShe forgave him, when it occurred to her that she was too important, and\nvaluable, to be easily spared; and a tenderness thrilled through her,\nas she looked at the sleeping Margaret’s pale face, and thought of\nsurrendering her and little Daisy to Ethel’s keeping. And what would\nbecome of the housekeeping? She decided, however, that feelings must not\nsway her--out of six sisters some must marry, for the good of the rest.\nBlanche and Daisy should come and stay with her, to be formed by the\nbest society; and, as to poor dear Ethel, Mrs. Rivers would rule the\nLadies’ Committee for her with a high hand, and, perhaps, provide\nCocksmoor with a school at her sole expense. What a useful, admirable\nwoman she would be! The doctor would be the person to come to his senses\nin the morning, when he remembered Abbotstoke, Mr. Rivers, and Meta.\n\nSo Flora met her father, the next morning, with all her ordinary\ncomposure, in which he could not rival her, after his sleepless, anxious\nnight. His looks of affectionate solicitude disconcerted what she had\nintended to say, and she waited, with downcast eyes, for him to begin.\n\n“Well, Flora,” he said at last, “have you thought?”\n\n“Do you know any cause against it?” said Flora, still looking down.\n\n“I know almost nothing of him. I have never heard anything of his\ncharacter or conduct. Those would be a subject of inquiry, if you wish\nto carry this on--”\n\n“I see you are averse,” said Flora. “I would do nothing against your\nwishes--”\n\n“My wishes have nothing to do with it,” said Dr. May. “The point\nis--that I must do right, as far as I can, as well as try to secure your\nhappiness; and I want to be sure that you know what you are about.”\n\n“I know he is not clever,” said Flora; “but there may be many solid\nqualities without talent.”\n\n“I am the last person to deny it; but where are these solid qualities? I\ncannot see the recommendation!”\n\n“I place myself in your hands,” said Flora, in a submissive tone, which\nhad the effect of making him lose patience.\n\n“Flora, Flora! why will you talk as if I were sacrificing you to some\ndislike or prejudice of my own! Don’t you think I should only rejoice\nto have such a prosperous home offered to you, if only the man were\nworthy?”\n\n“If you do not think him so, of course there is an end of it,” said\nFlora, and her voice showed suppressed emotion.\n\n“It is not what I think, in the absence of proof, but what you think,\nFlora. What I want you to do is this--to consider the matter fairly.\nCompare him with--I’ll not say with Norman--but with Richard, Alan, Mr.\nWilmot. Do you think you could rely on him--come to him for advice?”\n (Flora never did come to any one for advice.) “Above all--do you think\nhim likely to be a help, or a hindrance, in doing right?”\n\n“I think you underrate him,” said Flora steadily; “but, of course, if\nyou dislike it--though, I think, you would change your mind if you knew\nhim better--”\n\n“Well,” he said, as if to himself, “it is not always the most worthy;”\n then continued, “I have no dislike to him. Perhaps I may find that you\nare right. Since your mind is made up, I will do this: first, we must be\nassured of his father’s consent, for they may very fairly object, since\nwhat I can give you is a mere nothing to them. Next, I shall find out\nwhat character he bears in his regiment, and watch him well myself; and,\nif nothing appear seriously amiss, I will not withhold my consent. But,\nFlora, you should still consider whether he shows such principle and\nright feeling as you can trust to.”\n\n“Thank you, papa. I know you will do all that is kind.”\n\n“Mind, you must not consider it an engagement, unless all be\nsatisfactory.”\n\n“I will do as you please.”\n\nEthel perceived that something was in agitation, but the fact did not\nbreak upon her till she came to Margaret, after the schoolroom reading,\nand heard Dr. May declaiming away in the vehement manner that always\nrelieved him.\n\n“Such a cub!” These were the words that met her ear; and she would have\ngone away, but he called her. “Come in, Ethel; Margaret says you guessed\nat this affair!”\n\n“At what affair!” exclaimed Ethel. “Oh, it is about Flora. Poor man; has\nhe done it?”\n\n“Poor! He is not the one to be pitied!” said her father.\n\n“You don’t mean that she likes him?”\n\n“She does though! A fellow with no more brains than a turnip lantern!”\n\n“She does not mean it?” said Ethel.\n\n“Yes, she does! Very submissive, and proper spoken, of course, but bent\non having him; so there is nothing left for me but to consent--provided\nMr. Rivers does, and he should turn out not to have done anything\noutrageous; but there’s no hope of that--he has not the energy. What can\npossess her? What can she see to admire?”\n\n“He is good-natured,” said Margaret, “and rather good-looking--”\n\n“Flora has more sense. What on earth can be the attraction?”\n\n“I am afraid it is partly the grandeur--” said Ethel. She broke off\nshort, quite dismayed at the emotion she had excited. Dr. May stepped\ntowards her, almost as if he could have shaken her.\n\n“Ethel,” he cried, “I won’t have such motives ascribed to your sister!”\n\nEthel tried to recollect what she had said that was so shocking, for the\nidea of Flora’s worldly motives was no novelty to her. They had appeared\nin too many instances; and, though frightened at his anger, she stood\nstill, without unsaying her words.\n\nMargaret began to explain away. “Ethel did not mean, dear papa--”\n\n“No,” said Dr. May, his passionate manner giving way to dejection. “The\ntruth is, that I have made home so dreary, that my girls are ready to\ntake the first means of escaping.”\n\nPoor Margaret’s tears sprang forth, and, looking up imploringly, she\nexclaimed, “Oh, papa, papa! it was no want of happiness! I could not\nhelp it. You know he had come before--”\n\nAny reproach to her had been entirely remote from his thoughts, and he\nwas at once on his knee beside her, soothing and caressing, begging\nher pardon, and recalling whatever she could thus have interpreted.\nMeanwhile, Ethel stood unnoticed and silent, making no outward\nprotestation, but with lips compressed, as in her heart of hearts she\npassed the resolution--that her father should never feel this pain on\nher account. Leave him who might, she would never forsake him;\nnothing but the will of Heaven should part them. It might be hasty and\nventuresome. She knew not what it might cost her; but, where Ethel had\ntreasured her resolve to work for Cocksmoor, there she also laid up her\nsecret vow--that no earthly object should be placed between her and her\nfather.\n\nThe ebullition of feeling seemed to have restored Dr. May’s calmness,\nand he rose, saying, “I must go to my work; the man is coming here this\nafternoon.”\n\n“Where shall you see him?” Margaret asked.\n\n“In my study, I suppose. I fear there is no chance of Flora’s changing\nher mind first. Or do you think one of you could talk to her, and get\nher fairly to contemplate the real bearings of the matter?” And, with\nthese words, he left the room.\n\nMargaret and Ethel glanced at each other; and both felt the\nimpenetrability of Flora’s nature, so smooth, that all thrusts glided\noff.\n\n“It will be of no use,” said Ethel; “and, what is more, she will not\nhave it done.”\n\n“Pray try; a few of your forcible words would set it in a new light.”\n\n“Why! Do you think she will attend to me, when she has not chosen to\nheed papa?” said Ethel, with an emphasis of incredulity. “No; whatever\nFlora does, is done deliberately, and unalterably.”\n\n“Still, I don’t know whether it is not our duty,” said Margaret.\n\n“More yours than mine,” said Ethel.\n\nMargaret flushed up. “Oh, no, I cannot!” she said, always timid, and\nslightly defective in moral courage. She looked so nervous and shaken by\nthe bare idea of a remonstrance with Flora, that Ethel could not press\nher; and, though convinced that her representation would be useless, she\nowned that her conscience would rest better after she had spoken. “But\nthere is Flora, walking in the garden with Norman,” she said. “No doubt\nhe is doing it.”\n\nSo Ethel let it rest, and attended to the children’s lessons, during\nwhich Flora came into the drawing-room, and practised her music, as if\nnothing had happened.\n\nBefore the morning was over, Ethel contrived to visit Norman in the\ndining-room, where he was wont to study, and asked him whether he had\nmade any impression on Flora.\n\n“What impression do you mean?”\n\n“Why, about this concern,” said Ethel; “this terrible man, that makes\npapa so unhappy.”\n\n“Papa unhappy! Why, what does he know against him? I thought the\nRiverses were his peculiar pets.”\n\n“The Riverses! As if, because one liked the sparkling stream, one must\nlike a muddy ditch.”\n\n“What harm do you know of him?” said Norman, with much surprise and\nanxiety, as if he feared that he had been doing wrong, in ignorance.\n\n“Harm! Is he not a regular oaf?”\n\n“My dear Ethel, if you wait to marry till you find some one as clever as\nyourself, you will wait long enough.”\n\n“I don’t think it right for a woman to marry a man decidedly her\ninferior.”\n\n“We have all learned to think much too highly of talent,” said Norman\ngravely.\n\n“I don’t care for mere talent--people are generally more sensible\nwithout it; but, one way or other, there ought to be superiority on the\nman’s side.”\n\n“Well, who says there is not?”\n\n“My dear Norman! Why, this George Rivers is really below the average!\nyou cannot deny that! Did you ever meet any one so stupid?”\n\n“Really!” said Norman, considering; and, speaking very innocently, “I\ncannot see why you think so. I do not see that he is at all less capable\nof sustaining a conversation than Richard.”\n\nEthel sat down, perfectly breathless with amazement and indignation.\n\nNorman saw that he had shocked her very much. “I do not mean,” he said,\n“that we have not much more to say to Richard; all I meant to say was,\nmerely as to the intellect.”\n\n“I tell you,” said Ethel, “it is not the intellect. Richard! why, you\nknow how we respect, and look up to him. Dear old Ritchie! with his\ngoodness, and earnestness, and right judgment--to compare him to that\nman! Norman, Norman, I never thought it of you!”\n\n“You do not understand me, Ethel. I only cited Richard, as a person who\nproves how little cleverness is needed to insure respect.”\n\n“And, I tell you, that cleverness is not the point.”\n\n“It is the only objection you have put forward.”\n\n“I did wrong,” said Ethel. “It is not the real one. It is earnest\ngoodness that one honours in Richard. Where do we find it in this man,\nwho has never done anything but yawn over his self indulgence?”\n\n“Now, Ethel, you are working yourself up into a state of foolish\nprejudice. You and papa have taken a dislike to him; and you are\noverlooking a great deal of good safe sense and right thinking. I\nknow his opinions are sound, and his motives right. He has been\nundereducated, we all see, and is not very brilliant or talkative; but I\nrespect Flora for perceiving his solid qualities.”\n\n“Very solid and weighty, indeed!” said Ethel ironically. “I wonder if\nshe would have seen them in a poor curate.”\n\n“Ethel, you are allowing yourself to be carried, by prejudice, a\ngreat deal too far. Are such imputations to be made, wherever there is\ninequality of means? It is very wrong! very unjust!”\n\n“So papa said,” replied Ethel, as she looked sorrowfully down. “He was\nvery angry with me for saying so. I wish I could help feeling as if that\nwere the temptation.”\n\n“You ought,” said Norman. “You will be sorry, if you set yourself, and\nhim, against it.”\n\n“I only wish you to know what I feel; and, I think, Margaret and papa\ndo,” said Ethel humbly; “and then you will not think us more unjust than\nwe are. We cannot see anything so agreeable or suitable in this man as\nto account for Flora’s liking, and we do not feel convinced of his being\ngood for much. That makes papa greatly averse to it, though he does not\nknow any positive reason for refusing; and we cannot feel certain that\nshe is doing quite right, or for her own happiness.”\n\n“You will be convinced,” said Norman cheerfully. “You will find out the\ngood that is under the surface when you have seen more of him. I have\nhad a good deal of talk with him.”\n\nA good deal of talk to him would have been more correct, if Norman\nhad but been aware of it. He had been at the chief expense of the\nconversation with George Rivers, and had taken the sounds of assent,\nwhich he obtained, as evidences of his appreciation of all his views.\nNorman had been struggling so long against his old habit of looking down\non Richard, and exalting intellect; and had seen, in his Oxford life, so\nmany ill-effects of the knowledge that puffeth up, that he had come\nto have a certain respect for dullness, per se, of which George Rivers\neasily reaped the benefit, when surrounded by the halo, which everything\nat Abbotstoke Grange bore in the eyes of Norman.\n\nHe was heartily delighted at the proposed connection, and his genuine\nsatisfaction not only gratified Flora, and restored the equanimity that\nhad been slightly disturbed by her father, but it also reassured Ethel\nand Margaret, who could not help trusting in his judgment, and began to\nhope that George might be all he thought him.\n\nEthel, finding that there were two ways of viewing the gentleman,\ndoubted whether she ought to express her opinion. It was Flora’s\ndisposition, and the advantages of the match, that weighed most upon\nher, and, in spite of her surmise having been treated as so injurious,\nshe could not rid herself of the burden.\n\nDr. May was not so much consoled by Norman’s opinion as Ethel expected.\nThe corners of his mouth curled up a little with diversion, and though\nhe tried to express himself glad, and confident in his son’s judgment,\nthere was the same sort of involuntary lurking misgiving with which he\nhad accepted Sir Matthew Fleet’s view of Margaret’s case.\n\nThere was no danger that Dr. May would not be kind and courteous to the\nyoung man himself. It was not his fault if he were a dunce, and Dr. May\nperceived that his love for Flora was real, though clumsily expressed.\nHe explained that he could not sanction the engagement till he should\nbe better informed of the young gentleman’s antecedents; this was, as\nGeorge expressed it, a great nuisance, but his father agreed that it\nwas quite right, in some doubt, perhaps, as to how Dr. May might be\nsatisfied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n\n     Ye cumbrous fashions, crowd not on my head.\n     Mine be the chip of purest white,\n     Swan-like; and, as her feathers light,\n     When on the still wave spread;\n     And let it wear the graceful dress\n     Of unadorned simpleness.\n                            Catherine Fanshaw’s ‘Parody on Grey’.\n\n\nNothing transpired to the discredit of Lieutenant Rivers. He had spent a\ngreat deal of money, but chiefly for want of something else to do,\nand, though he was not a subject for high praise, there was no vice\nin him--no more than in an old donkey--as Dr. May declared, in his\nconcluding paroxysm of despair, on finding that, though there was little\nto reconcile him to the engagement, there was no reasonable ground for\nthwarting his daughter’s wishes. He argued the matter once more with\nher, and, finding her purpose fixed, he notified his consent, and the\nrest of the family were admitted to a knowledge of the secret which they\nhad never suspected.\n\nEtheldred could not help being gratified with the indignation it\nexcited. With one voice, Mary and Blanche declared that they would\nnever give up the title of “the detestable,” and would not make him\nany presents; certainly not watch-chains! Miss Bracy, rather alarmed,\nlectured them just enough to make them worse; and Margaret, overhearing\nBlanche instructing Aubrey in her own impertinences, was obliged to call\nher to her sofa, and assure her that she was unkind to Flora, and that\nshe must consider Mr. George Rivers as her brother.\n\n“Never my brother like Harry!” exclaimed Mary indignantly.\n\n“No, indeed; nor like Alan!” exclaimed Blanche. “And I won’t call him\nGeorge, I am determined, if it is ever so!”\n\n“It will not matter to him what such little girls call him,” said\nMargaret.\n\nBlanche was so annihilated, that the sound of a carriage, and of the\ndoor bell, was a great satisfaction to her.\n\nMeta Rivers came flying into the room, her beautiful eyes dancing,\nand her cheeks glowing with pleasure, as, a little timidly, she kissed\nMargaret; while Ethel, in a confused way, received Mr. Rivers, in\npain for her own cold, abrupt manner, in contrast with his gentle,\ncongratulating politeness.\n\nMeta asked, blushing, and with a hesitating voice, for their dear Flora;\nMary offered to call her, but Meta begged to go herself, and thus was\nspared the awkwardness that ensued. Ethel was almost vexed with herself,\nas ungrateful, when she saw Mr. Rivers so mildly kind, and so delighted,\nwith the bland courtesy that seemed fully conscious of the favour that\nFlora had conferred on his son, and thankful to the Mays for accepting\nhim.\n\nMargaret answered with more expression of gratification than would have\nbeen sincere in Ethel; but it was a relief when Flora and Meta came in\ntogether, as pretty a contrast as could be seen; the little dark-eyed\nfairy, all radiant with joy, clinging to the slender waist of Flora,\nwhose quiet grace and maidenly dignity were never more conspicuous than\nas, with a soft red mantling in her fair cheek, her eyes cast down, but\nwith a simple, unaffected warmth of confidence and gratitude, she came\nforward to receive Mr. Rivers’s caressing affectionate greeting.\n\nStiffness was over when she came in, and Dr. May, who presently made his\nappearance, soon was much more at his ease than could have been hoped,\nafter his previous declarations that he should never be able to be\nmoderately civil about it to Mr. Rivers. People of ready sympathy, such\nas Dr. May and Margaret, have a great deal of difficulty with their\nsincerity spared them, by being carried along with the feelings of\nothers. Ethel could not feel the same, and was bent on avoiding any\nexpression of opinion; she hoped that Meta’s ecstasies would all be\nbestowed upon her future sister-in-law; but Meta was eager for an\ninterview with Ethel herself, and, as usual, gained her point.\n\n“Now then, you are property of my own!” she cried. “May I not take you\nall for sisters?”\n\nEthel had not thought of this as a convenience of the connection, and\nshe let Meta kiss her, and owned that it was very nice.\n\n“Ethel,” said Meta, “I see, and I wanted to talk to you. You don’t think\npoor George good enough for Flora.”\n\n“I never meant to show it,” said Ethel.\n\n“You need not mind,” said Meta, smiling. “I was very much surprised\nmyself, and thought it all a mistake. But I am so very glad, for I know\nit will make such a difference to him, poor fellow. I should like to\ntell you all about him, for no one else can very well, and you will like\nhim better, perhaps. You know my grandfather made his own fortune, and\nyou would think some of our relations very queer. My Aunt Dorothy once\ntold me all about it--papa was made to marry the partner’s daughter, and\nI fancy she could not have been much of a lady. I don’t think he could\nhave been very happy with her, but she soon died, and left him with this\none son, whom those odd old aunts brought up their own way. By and by,\nyou know, papa came to be in quite another line of society, but when he\nmarried again, poor George had been so spoiled by these aunts, and was\nso big, and old, that my mother did not know what to make of him.”\n\n“A great lubberly boy,” Ethel said, rather repenting the next moment.\n\n“He is thirteen years older than I am,” said Meta, “and you see it has\nbeen hard on him altogether; he had not the education that papa would\nhave given him if he had been born later: and he can’t remember his\nmother, and has always been at a loss when with clever people. I never\nunderstood it till within the last two or three years, nor knew\nhow trying it must be to see such a little chit as me made so much\nof--almost thrusting him aside. But you cannot think what a warm-hearted\ngood fellow he is--he has never been otherwise than so very kind to\nme, and he was so very fond of his old aunt. Hitherto, he has had such\ndisadvantages, and no real, sensible woman has taken him in hand; he\ndoes not care for papa’s tastes, and I am so much younger, that I never\ncould get on with him at all, till this time; but I do know that he has\na real good temper, and all sorts of good qualities, and that he only\nneeds to be led right, to go right. Oh! Flora may make anything of him,\nand we are so thankful to her for having found it out!”\n\n“Thank you for telling me,” said Ethel. “It is much more satisfactory to\nhave no shamming.”\n\nMeta laughed, for Ethel’s sham was not too successful; she continued,\n“Dear Dr. May, I thought he would think his beautiful Flora not exactly\nmatched--but tell him, Ethel, for if he once is sorry for poor George,\nhe will like him. And it will really be the making of George, to be\nthrown with him and your brothers. Oh! we are so glad! But I won’t tease\nyou to be so.”\n\n“I can like it better now,” said Ethel. “You know Norman thinks very\nhighly of your brother, and declares that it will all come out by and\nby.”\n\nMeta clapped her hands, and said that she should tell her father, and\nEthel parted with her, liking her, at least, better than ever. There\nwas a comical scene between her and the doctor, trying to define what\nrelations they should become to each other, which Ethel thought did a\ngood deal to mollify her father.\n\nThe history of George’s life did more; he took to pitying him, and pity\nwas, indeed, akin to love in the good doctor’s mind. In fact, George\nwas a man who could be liked, when once regarded as a belonging--a\nnecessity, not a choice; for it was quite true that there was no harm in\nhim, and a great deal of good nature. His constant kindness, and evident\nliking for Margaret, stood him in good stead; he made her a sort of\nconfidante, bestowing on her his immeasurable appreciation of Flora’s\nperfections, and telling her how well he was getting on with “the old\ngentleman”--a name under which she failed to recognise her father.\n\nAs to Tom, he wrote his congratulations to Ethel, that she might make\na wedding present of her Etruscan vases, the Cupids on which must have\nbeen put there by anticipation. Richard heard none of the doubts,\nand gave kind, warm congratulations, promising to return home for\nthe wedding; and Mary and Blanche no sooner heard a whisper about\nbride’s-maids than all their opposition faded away, in a manner that\nquite scandalised Ethel, while it set Margaret on reminiscences of\nher having been a six-year-old bride’s-maid to Flora’s godmother, Mrs.\nArnott.\n\nAs to the gossip in the town, Ethel quite dreaded the sight of every one\nwithout Flora to protect her, and certainly, Flora’s unaffected, quiet\nmanner was perfection, and kept off all too forward congratulations,\nwhile it gratified those whom she was willing to encourage.\n\nThere was no reason for waiting, and Mr. Rivers was as impatient as his\nson, so an understanding arose that the wedding, should take place near\nthe end of the Christmas holidays.\n\nFlora showed herself sensible and considerate. Always open-handed, her\nfather was inclined to do everything liberally, and laid no restrictions\non her preparations, but she had too much discretion to be profuse, and\nhad a real regard for the welfare of the rest. She laughed with Ethel at\nthe anticipations of the Stoneborough ladies that she must be going\nto London, and, at the requests, as a great favour, that they might be\nallowed the sight of her trousseau. Her wedding-dress, white silk,\nwith a white cashmere mantle, was, indeed, ordered from Meta’s London\ndressmaker; but, for the rest, she contented herself with an expedition\nto Whitford, accompanied by Miss Bracy and her two enchanted pupils,\nand there laid in a stock of purchases, unpretending and in good\ntaste, aiming only at what could be well done, and not attempting the\ndecorative wardrobe of a great lady. Ethel was highly amused when\nthe Misses Anderson came for their inspection, to see their concealed\ndisappointment at finding no under garments trimmed with Brussels lace,\nnor pocket-handkerchiefs all open-work, except a centre of the size of\na crown-piece, and the only thing remarkable was Margaret’s beautiful\nmarking in embroidery. There was some compensation in the costly wedding\npresents--Flora had reaped a whole harvest from friends of her own,\ngrateful patients of her father, and the whole Rivers and Langdale\nconnection; but, in spite of the brilliant uselessness of most of these,\nthe young ladies considered themselves ill-used, thought Dr. May never\nwould have been shabby, and were of opinion that when Miss Ward had\nmarried her father’s surgical pupil, her outfit had been a far more\nedifying spectacle.\n\nThe same moderation influenced Flora’s other arrangements. Dr. May was\nresigned to whatever might be thought most proper, stipulating only\nthat he should not have to make a speech; but Flora felt that, in their\nhouse, a grand breakfast would be an unsuccessful and melancholy affair.\nIf the bride had been any one else, she could have enjoyed making all\ngo off well, but, under present circumstances, it would be great pain to\nher father and Margaret, a misery to Ethel, and something she dared not\nthink of to the guests. She had no difficulty in having it dispensed\nwith. George was glad to avoid “a great nuisance.” Mr. Rivers feared the\nfatigue, and, with his daughter, admired Flora for her amiability, and,\nas to the home party, no words could express their gratitude to her for\nletting them off. Mary and Blanche did, indeed, look rather blank, but\nBlanche was consoled, by settling with Hector the splendours in store\nfor Alan and Margaret, and Mary cared the less, as there would be no\nHarry to enjoy the fun.\n\nThe bride-maiden’s glory was theirs by right, though Ethel was an\nunsatisfactory chief for such as desired splendour. She protested\nagainst anything incongruous with January, or that could not be useful\nafterwards, and Meta took her part, laughing at the cruel stroke they\nwere preparing for Bellairs. Ethel begged for dark silks and straw\nbonnets, and Flora said that she had expected to hear of brown stuff\nand gray duffle, but owned that they had better omit the ordinary muslin\ngarb in the heart of winter. The baby bride’s-maid was, at last, the\nchief consideration. Margaret suggested how pretty she and Blanche would\nlook in sky-blue merino, trimmed with swan’s-down. Meta was charmed with\nthe idea, and though Ethel stuck out her shoulder-blades and poked\nout her head, and said she should look like the ugly duckling, she was\nclamorously reminded that the ugly duckling ended by being a swan,\nand promised that she should be allowed a bonnet of a reasonable size,\ntrimmed with white, for Mr. Rivers’s good taste could endure, as little\nas Dr. May’s sense of propriety, the sight of a daughter without shade\nto her face, Ethel, finally, gave in, on being put in mind that her papa\nhad a penchant for swan’s-down, and on Margaret’s promising to wear a\ndress of the same as theirs.\n\nEthel was pleased and satisfied by Flora’s dislike of parade, and\nattention to the feelings of all. Passing over the one great fact,\nthe two sisters were more of one mind than usual, probably because all\nlatent jealousy of Ethel had ceased in Flora’s mind. Hitherto, she had\npreferred the being the only practically useful person in the family,\nand had encouraged the idea of Ethel’s gaucherie but now she desired to\nrender her sister able to take her place, and did all in her power to\nput her in good heart.\n\nFor Etheldred was terrified at the prospect of becoming responsible\nhousekeeper. Margaret could only serve as an occasional reference. Her\nmorning powers became too uncertain to be depended on for any regular,\nnecessary duty, and it would have oppressed her so much to order the\ndinners, which she never saw, that, though she offered to resume the\noffice, Flora would not hear of Ethel’s consenting. If it were her\nproper business, Ethel supposed she could do it, but another hour of her\nleisure was gone, and what would become of them all, with her, a proverb\nfor heedlessness, and ignorance of ordinary details. She did not know\nthat these were more proverbial than actual, and, having a bad name, she\nbelieved in it herself. However, Flora made it her business to persuade\nher that her powers were as good for household matters, as for books, or\nCocksmoor; instructed her in her own methodical plans, and made her\nkeep house for a fortnight, with so much success that she began to be\nhopeful.\n\nIn the attendance on Margaret, the other great charge, old nurse was\nthe security; and Ethel, who had felt her self much less unhandy\nthan before, was, to succeed to the abode, in her room--Blanche\nbeing promoted from the nursery to the old attic. “And,” said Flora\nconsolingly, “if dear Margaret ever should be ill, you may reckon on\nme.”\n\nMiss Flora May made her last appearance at the Ladies’ Committee to hear\nthe reply from the principal of the college. It was a civil letter,\nbut declined taking any steps in the matter without more certain\nintelligence of the wishes of the incumbent of the parish or of the\nholders of the land in question.\n\nThe ladies abused all colleges--as prejudiced old Bodies, and feared\nthat it would be impossible to ask Mrs. Perkinson’s niece to take the\nschool while there was neither room nor lodging. So Miss Rich recorded\nthe correspondence, and the vote of censure, by which it was to be hoped\nthe Ladies’ Committee of Market Stoneborough inflicted a severe blow on\nthe principal and fellows of M---- College.\n\n“Never mind, Ethel,” said Flora. “I shall meet Sir Henry Walkinghame in\nLondon, and will talk to him. We shall yet astonish the muses. If we can\nget the land without them, we shall be able to manage it our own way,\nwithout obligations.”\n\n“You forget the money!”\n\n“We will keep them from dissipating it--or that might be no harm! A\nhundred pounds will be easily found, and we should then have it in our\nown hands. Besides, you know, I don’t mean to give up. I shall write a\npolite note to Mrs. Ledwich, begging to subscribe on my own account, and\nto retain my seat! and you will see what we shall do.”\n\n“You mean to come down with the external authority,” said Ethel,\nsmiling.\n\n“True! and though my driving in with a pair of horses may make little\ndifference to you, Ethel, depend upon it, Mrs. Ledwich will be the more\namenable. Whenever I want to be particularly impressive, I shall bring\nin that smelling-bottle, with the diamond stopper that won’t come out,\nand you will find that carries all before it.”\n\n“A talisman!” said Ethel, laughing. “But I had rather they yielded to a\nsense of right!”\n\n“So had I,” said Flora. “Perhaps you will rule them that way?”\n\n“Not I!” cried Ethel, terrified.\n\n“Then you must come to me, and secondary motives. Seriously--I do mean\nthat George should do something for Stoneborough; and, in a position of\ninfluence, I hope to be able to be useful to my poor old town. Perhaps\nwe shall have the minster restored.”\n\nFlora did wish it. She did love Stoneborough, and was sincerely\ninterested for Cocksmoor. She thought she worked earnestly for them,\nand that her situation would be turned to their profit; but there was\nsomething for which she worked more earnestly. Had Flora never heard of\nthe two masters whom we cannot serve at the same time?\n\nRichard came home for “a parson’s week,” so as to include the wedding.\nHe looked very fresh and youthful; but his manner, though still gentle\nand retiring, had lost all that shrinking diffidence, and had, now, a\nvery suitable grave composure. Everybody was delighted to have him;\nand Ethel, more than any one, except Margaret. What floods of Cocksmoor\nhistories were poured upon him; and what comparing of notes about his\npresent school-children! He could not enter into the refinements of her\ndread of the Ladies’ Committee, and thought she might be thankful if\nthe school were built by any proper means; for, if Cherry Elwood\nwere retained, and the ladies prevented from doing harm, he did not\nunderstand why Ethel should wish to reject all assistance that did not\ncome in a manner she admired. He never would comprehend--so Ethel gave\nit up--feared she was again jealous and self-sufficient, and contented\nherself with the joy that his presence produced at Cocksmoor, where the\nchildren smiled, blushed, and tittered, with ecstasy, whenever he even\nlooked at one of them.\n\nRichard was not allowed to have a Sunday of rest. His father apologised\nfor having made an engagement for him--as Mr. Ramsden was unwell, and\nthe school clergy were all absent, so that he could do no otherwise than\nassist in the service. Richard coloured, and said that he had brought no\nsermon; and he was, in fact, deprived of much of his sister’s company,\nfor composition was not easy to him, and the quantity of time he spent\non it, quite alarmed Norman and Ethel, who both felt rather nervous on\nthe Sunday morning, but agreed that preaching was not everything.\n\nEthel could not see well as far as the reading-desk, but she saw her\nfather glance up, take off his spectacles, wipe them, and put them away;\nand she could not be displeased, though she looked reproof at Blanche’s\nbreathless whisper, “Oh, he looks so nice!” Those white folds did truly\nsuit well with the meek, serious expression of the young deacon’s fair\nface, and made him, as his sisters afterwards said, like one of the\nsolemnly peaceful angel-carvings of the earlier ages.\n\nHis voice was sweet and clear, and his reading full of quiet simplicity\nand devotion, such as was not often heard by that congregation, who were\ntoo much used either to carelessness or to pomposity. The sermon made\nhis brother and sister ashamed of their fears. It was an exposition of\nthe Gospel for the day, practical and earnest, going deep, and rising\nhigh, with a clearness and soberness, yet with a beauty and elevation,\nsuch as Norman and Ethel had certainly not expected--or, rather,\nthey forgot all their own expectations and Richard himself, and only\nrecollected their own hearts and the great future before them.\n\nEven Blanche and Aubrey told Margaret a great deal about it, and\ndeclared that, if Richard preached every Sunday, they should like going\nto church much better.\n\nWhen Dr. May came in, some time after, he was looking much pleased.\n“So, Mr. Ritchie,” he said, “you have made quite a sensation--every one\nshaking me by the hand, and thanking me for my son’s sermon. You will be\na popular preacher at last!”\n\nRichard blushed distressfully, and quoted the saying, that it would be\nthe true comfort to hear that people went home, thinking of themselves\nrather than of the sermon. This put an end to the subject; but the\ndoctor went over it again, most thoroughly, with his other children, who\nwere greatly delighted.\n\nFlora’s last home Sunday! She was pale and serious, evidently feeling\nmuch, though seeking no tete-a-tetes; and chiefly engrossed with waiting\non Margaret, or fondling little Gertrude. No one saw the inside of her\nmind--probably, she did not herself. On the outside was a very suitable\npensiveness, and affection for all that she was leaving. The only one in\nthe family to whom she talked much was Norman, who continued to see many\nperfections in George, and contrived, by the force of his belief, to\nimpress the same on the others, and to make them think his great\ntalent for silence such a proof of his discretion, that they were not\nstaggered, even by his shy blundering exclamation that his wedding would\nbe a great nuisance--a phrase which, as Dr. May observed, was, to him,\nwhat Est-il-possible was to his namesake of Denmark.\n\nNobody wished for any misgivings, so Richard was never told of any,\nthough there was a careful watch kept to see what were his first\nimpressions. None transpired, except something about good nature, but it\nwas shrewdly believed that Richard and George, being much alike in\nshy unwillingness to speak, had been highly satisfied with the little\ntrouble they had caused to each other, and so had come to a tacit\nesteem.\n\nThere was very little bustle of preparation. Excepting the packing,\neverything went on much as usual, till the Thursday morning, and then\nthe children were up early, refreshing the Christmas hollies, and\nworking up their excitement, only to have it damped by the suppressed\nagitation of their elders at the breakfast-table.\n\nDr. May did not seem to know what he was about; and Flora looked paler\nand paler. She went away before the meal was over, and when Ethel went\nto the bedroom, shortly after, she found that she had fairly broken\ndown, and was kneeling beside Margaret’s sofa, resting her head on her\nsister’s bosom, and sobbing--as Ethel had never seen her weep, except on\nthat dreadful night, after their mother’s death.\n\nIn a person ordinarily of such self-command as Flora, weeping was a\nterrible thing, and Margaret was much distressed and alarmed; but the\nworst had passed before Ethel came up, and Flora was able to speak. “Oh!\nMargaret! I cannot leave you! Oh! how happy we have been--”\n\n“You are going to be happier, we trust, dearest,” said Margaret fondly.\n\n“Oh! what have I done? It is not worth it!”\n\nEthel thought she caught those words, but no more. Mary’s step was\nheard, and Flora was on her feet, instantly, composing herself rapidly.\nShe shed no more tears, but her eyelids were very heavy, and her face\nsoftened, in a manner that, though she was less pretty than usual, was\nvery becoming under her bridal veil. She recovered calmness and even\ncheerfulness, while reversing the usual order of things, and dressing\nher bride’s-maids, who would never have turned out fit to be seen, but\nfor the exertions of herself, Margaret, and Miss Bracy. Ethel’s long\nScotch bones and Mary’s round, dumpy shapelessness were, in their\ndifferent ways, equally hard to overcome; and the one was swelled out\nwith a fabulous number of petticoats, and the other pinched in, till she\ngasped and screamed for mercy, while Blanche and Gertrude danced about,\nbeautiful to behold, under their shady hats; and presently, with a light\ntap at the door, Meta Rivers stepped in, looking so pretty, that all\nfelt that to try to attain to such an appearance was vain.\n\nTimid in her affection, she hardly dared to do more than kiss them, and\nwhisper her pretty caressing words to each. There was no more time--Dr.\nHoxton’s carriage was come to take up the bride.\n\nEthel did as she was told, without much volition of her own; and she\nquitted the carriage, and was drawn into her place by Norman, trusting\nthat Meta would not let her do wrong, and relieved that just in front\nof her were the little ones, over whose heads she could see her father,\nwith Flora’s veiled bending figure.\n\nThat pause while the procession was getting into order, the slow\nmovement up the centre aisle, the week-day atmosphere of the church,\nbrought back to her thoughts a very different time, and one of those\nstrange echoings on the mind repeated in her ears the words, “For man\nwalketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain--”\n\nThere was a little pause--George did not seem to be forthcoming, and\nMeta turned round, rather uneasily, and whispered something about his\nhaving been so nervous. However, there he was, looking exceedingly red,\nand very sheepish, and disposed to fall back on his best man, Norman,\nwhose countenance was at the brightest--and almost handsome.\n\nDr. Hoxton performed the ceremony, “assisted by” Richard. It had been\nFlora’s choice; and his loud sonorous voice was thought very impressive.\nBlanche stood the nearest, and looked happy and important, with Flora’s\nglove. Gertrude held Mary’s hand, and gazed straight up into the fretted\nroof, as if that were to her the chief marvel. Ethel stood and knelt,\nbut did not seem, to herself, to have the power of thinking or feeling.\nShe saw and heard--that was all; she could not realise.\n\nThey drew her forward, when it was over, to sign her name, as witness.\nShe took up the pen, looked at the Flora May, written for the last time,\nand found her hand so trembling, that she said, half smiling, that\nshe could not write. Mary was only too well pleased to supply the\ndeficiency. Dr. May looked at her anxiously, and asked whether she felt\novercome.\n\n“No, papa. I did not know my hand was shaky.”\n\nHe took it into his, and pressed it. Ethel knew, then, how much had been\nundeveloped in her own mind, catching it, as it were, from his touch\nand look. The thought of his past joy--the sad fading of hope for\nMargaret--the fear and doubt for their present bride--above all, the\nsense that the fashion of this world passeth away; and that it is not\nthe outward scene, but our bearing in it, that is to last for ever.\n\nThe bells struck up, each peal ending with a crash that gave Ethel\nsome vague idea of fatality; and they all came back to the house, where\nMargaret was ready, in the drawing-room, to receive them, looking\nvery pretty, in her soft blue dress, which especially became her fair\ncomplexion and light brown hair. Ethel did not quite like the pink\ncolour on her cheeks, and feared that she had been shaken by Flora’s\nagitation in the morning; but she was very calm and bright, in the\naffectionate greeting with which she held out her hands to the bride and\nbridegroom, as they came in.\n\nMr. Rivers and Meta were the only guests, and, while Meta was seized\nby the children, Margaret lay talking to Mr. Rivers, George standing\nupright and silent behind her sofa, like a sentinel. Flora was gone\nto change her dress, not giving way, but nervous and hurried, as she\nreiterated parting directions about household comforts to Ethel, who\nstood by the toilette-table, sticking a pin into the pincushion and\ndrawing it out again, as if solely intent on making it always fit into\nthe same hole, while Mary dressed Flora, packed, flew about, and was\nuseful.\n\nAs they came downstairs, Ethel found that Flora was trembling from head\nto foot, and leaning on her; Dr. May stood at the foot of the stairs,\nand folded his daughter in a long embrace; Flora gave herself up to it\nas if she would never bear to leave it. Did a flash come over her then,\nwhat the father was, whom she had held cheaply? what was the worth of\nthat for which she had exchanged such a home? She spoke not a word, she\nonly clung tightly--if her heart failed her--it was too late. “Bless\nyou! my child!” he said at last. “Only be what your mother was!”\n\nA coming tread warned them to part. There was a tray of luncheon for the\ntwo who were about to depart, and the great snow-white cake was waiting\nfor Flora to cut it. She smiled, accomplished that feat steadily, and\nNorman continuing the operation, Aubrey guided Gertrude in handing round\nthe slices. George did full justice thereto, as well as to the more\nsolid viands. Flora could taste nothing, but she contrived to smile and\nsay it was too early. She was in haste to have it over now, and, as soon\nas George had finished, she rose up, still composed and resolved, the\nlast kisses were given--Gertrude was lifted up to her, after she was in\nthe carriage for the very last, when George proposed to run away with\nher also, whereupon Daisy kicked and screamed, and was taken back in\nhaste. The door was shut, and they drove off, bound for the Continent,\nand then Mary, as if the contingency of losing Flora had only for the\nfirst time occurred to her as the consequence of the wedding, broke out\ninto a piteous fit of sobbing--rather too unrestrained, considering her\nfourteen years.\n\nPoor Mary, she was a very child still! They pulled her into the study,\nout of the way of Mr. Rivers, and Meta had no sooner said how Flora\nwould soon come home and live at the Grange, and talked of the grand\nschool-feast to which she was at once going to take her friends, than\nthe round rosy face drew out of its melancholy puckers into smiles, as\nMary began to tell the delight caused by the invitations which she\nhad conveyed. That was to be a feast indeed--all the Abbotstoke\nchildren--all Flora’s class at Stoneborough, and as many Cocksmoor\nscholars as could walk so far, were to dine on Christmas fare, at\none o’clock, at the Grange, and Meta was in haste to be at home to\nsuperintend the feast.\n\nMary, Blanche, and Aubrey, went with her, under the keeping of Miss\nBracy, the boys were to follow. She had hoped for Ethel, but on looking\nat her, ceased her coaxing importunity.\n\n“I see,” she said kindly; “even schoolchildren will not be so good for\nyou as peace.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Ethel, “I should like to be quiet till the evening, if\nyou will let me off. It is very kind in you.”\n\n“I ought to know how to pity you,” said Meta, “I who have gained what\nyou have lost.”\n\n“I want to think too,” said Ethel. “It is the beginning to me of a new\nlife, and I have not been able to look at it yet.”\n\n“Besides, Margaret will want you. Poor Margaret--has it been very trying\nto her?”\n\n“I fear so, but I shall keep out of her way, and leave her to a quiet\nafternoon with Richard. It will be the greatest treat to those two to be\ntogether.”\n\n“Very well, I will carry off the children, and leave the house quiet.”\n\nAnd quiet it was in another hour--Gertrude walking with the nurses, Dr.\nMay gone to his patients, and all the rest at Abbotstoke, except Richard\nand Margaret downstairs; and Ethel, who, while arranging her properties\nin her new room, had full leisure to lay out before herself the duties\nthat had devolved on her and to grapple with them. She recalled the\nmany counsels that she had received from Flora, and they sounded so\nbewildering that she wished it had been Conic sections, and then she\nlooked at a Hebrew grammar that Norman had given her, and gave a sigh as\nshe slipped it into the shelf of the seldom used. She looked about the\nroom, cleared out the last piece of brown paper, and burned the last\ntorn envelope, that no relic of packing and change might distress\nMargaret’s eyes for order; then feeling at once desolate and intrusive,\nshe sat down in Flora’s fireside chair, opened her desk, and took out\nher last time-table. She looked at it for some minutes, laid it aside,\nand rising, knelt down. Again seating herself, she resumed her paper,\ntook a blank one, ruled it, and wrote her rules for each hour of each\nday in the week. That first hour after breakfast, when hitherto she had\nbeen free, was one sacrifice; it must go now, to ordering dinner,\nseeing after stores, watching over the children’s clothes, and the\nother nondescripts, which, happily for her, Flora had already reduced to\nmethod. The other loss was the spare time between the walk and tea; she\nmust not spend that in her own room now, or there would be no one to sit\nwith Margaret, or keep the little ones from being troublesome to her.\nEthel had often had to give up this space before, when Flora went out in\nthe evening, and she had seldom felt otherwise than annoyed. Give it\nup for good! that was the cure for temper, but it had been valuable as\nsomething of her own. She would have been thankful could she have\nhoped to keep regularly to her own rules, but that she knew was utterly\nimprobable--boys, holidays, callers, engagements, Dr. May, would all\nconspire to turn half her days upside down, and Cocksmoor itself must\noften depend not only on the weather, but on home doings. Two or three\nnotes she wrote at the foot of her paper.\n\n\n  ‘N. B.  These are a standard--not a bed of Procrustes.\n   MUSTS--To be first consulted.--Mays--last.  Ethel May’s\n          last of all.\n          If I cannot do everything--omit the self-chosen.\n   MEM--  Neither hurry when it depends on myself,\n          nor fidget when it depends on others.\n   Keep a book going to pacify myself.’\n\n\nHer rules drawn up, Ethel knelt once more. Then she drew a long sigh,\nand wondered where Flora was; and next, as she was fairly fagged, mind\nand body, she threw herself back in the armchair, took up a railway\nnovel that Hector had brought home, and which they had hidden from the\nchildren, and repaired herself with the luxury of an idle reading.\n\nMargaret and Richard likewise spent a peaceful, though pensive\nafternoon. Margaret had portions of letters from Alan to read to him,\nand a consultation to hold. The hope of her full recovery had so melted\naway, that she had, in every letter, striven to prepare Mr. Ernescliffe\nfor the disappointment, and each that she received in return was so\nsanguine and affectionate, that the very fondness was as much grief as\njoy. She could not believe that he took in the true state of the case,\nor was prepared to perceive that she could never be his wife, and she\nwanted Richard to write one of his clear, dispassionate statements,\nsuch as carried full conviction, and to help to put a final end to the\nengagement.\n\n“But why,” said Richard--“why should you wish to distress him?”\n\n“Because I cannot bear that he should be deceived, and should feed on\nfalse hopes. Do you think it right, Richard?”\n\n“I will write to him, if you like,” said Richard; “but I think he\nmust pretty well know the truth from all the letters to Harry and to\nhimself.”\n\n“It would be so much better for him to settle his mind at once,” said\nMargaret.\n\n“Perhaps he would not think so--”\n\nThere was a pause, while Margaret saw that her brother was thinking. At\nlast he said, “Margaret, will you pardon me? I do think that this is a\nlittle restlessness. The truth has not been kept from him, and I do\nnot see that we are called to force it on him. He is sensible and\nreasonable, and will know how to judge when he comes home.”\n\n“It was to try to save him the pang,” murmured Margaret.\n\n“Yes; but it will be worse far away than near. I do not mean that we\nshould conceal the fact, but you have no right to give him up before he\ncomes home. The whole engagement was for the time of his voyage.”\n\n“Then you think I ought not to break it off before his return?”\n\n“Certainly not.”\n\n“It will be pain spared--unless it should be worse by and by.”\n\n“I do not suppose we ought to look to by and by,” said Richard.\n\n“How so?”\n\n“Do the clearly right thing for the present, I mean,” he said, “without\nanxiety for the rest. How do we--any of us--know what may be the case in\nanother year?”\n\n“Do not flatter me with hopes,” said Margaret, sadly smiling; “I have\nhad too many of them.”\n\n“No,” said Richard; “I do not think you will ever get well. But so much\nmay happen--”\n\n“I had rather have my mind made up once for all, and resign myself,”\n said Margaret.\n\n“His will is sometimes that we should be uncertain,” said Richard.\n\n“And that is the most trying,” said Margaret.\n\n“Just so--” and he paused tenderly.\n\n“I feel how much has been right,” said Margaret. “This wedding has\nbrought my real character before me. I feel what I should have been. You\nhave no notion how excited and elated I can get about a little bit of\ndress out of the common way for myself or others,” said she, smiling;\n“and then all the external show and things belonging to station--I\nnaturally care much more for them than even Flora does. Ethel would bear\nall those things as if they did not exist--I could not.”\n\n“They would be a temptation?”\n\n“They would once have been. Yes, they would now,” said Margaret. “And\ngovernment, and management, and influence--you would not guess what\ndreams I used to waste on them, and now here am I set aside from it all,\ngood for nothing but for all you dear ones to be kind to.”\n\n“They would not say so,” said Richard kindly.\n\n“Not say it, but I feel it. Papa and Ethel are all the world to each\nother--Richard, I may say it to you. There has been only one thing more\nhard to bear than that--don’t suppose there was a moment’s neglect or\ndisregard; but when first I understood that Ethel could be more to him\nthan I, then I could not always feel rightly. It was the punishment for\nalways wanting to be first.”\n\n“My father would be grieved that you had the notion. You should not keep\nit.”\n\n“He does not know it is so,” said Margaret; “I am his first care, I\nfear, his second grief; but it is not in the nature of things that Ethel\nshould not be more his comfort and companion. Oh! I am glad it was not\nshe who married! What shall we do when she goes?”\n\nThis came from Margaret’s heart, so as to show that if there had once\nbeen a jealous pang of mortification, it had been healed by overflowing,\nunselfish affection and humility.\n\nThey went off to praise Ethel, and thence to praise Norman, and the\nelder brother and sister, who might have had some jealousy of the\nsuperiority of their juniors, spent a good happy hour in dwelling on the\nshining qualities they loved so heartily.\n\nAnd Richard was drawn into talking of his own deeper thoughts, and\nMargaret had again the comfort of clerical counsel--and now from her own\nmost dear brother! So they sat till darkness closed in, when Ethel came\ndown, bringing Gertrude and her great favour, very full of chatter, only\nnot quite sure whether she had been bride, bride’s-maid, or bridegroom.\n\nThe schoolroom set, with Tom and Aubrey, came home soon after, and\ntongues went fast with stories of roast-beef, plum-pudding, and\nblind-man’s-buff. How the dear Meta had sent a cart to Cocksmoor to\nbring Cherry herself, and how many slices everybody had eaten, and how\nthe bride’s health had been drunk by the children in real wine, and how\nthey had all played, Norman and all, and how Hector had made Blanche\nbold enough to extract a raisin from the flaming snap-dragon. It was\nnot half told when Dr. May came home, and Ethel went up to dress for\nher dinner at Abbotstoke, Mary following to help her and continue her\nnarration, which bade fair to entertain Margaret the whole evening.\n\nDr. May, Richard, and Ethel had a comfortable dark drive to the Grange,\nand, on arriving, found Hector deep in ‘Wild Sports of the West’, while\nNorman and Meta were sitting over the fire talking, and Mr. Rivers was\nresting in his library.\n\nAnd when Ethel and Meta spent the time before the gentlemen came in\nfrom the dining-room, in a happy tete-a-tete, Ethel learned that the\nfire-light dialogue had been the pleasantest part of the whole day, and\nthat Meta had had confided to her the existence of Decius Mus--a secret\nwhich Ethel had hitherto considered as her own peculiar property, but\nshe supposed it was a pledge of the sisterhood, which Meta professed\nwith all the house of May.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n\n     The rest all accepted the kind invitation,\n     And much bustle it caused in the plumed creation;\n     Such ruffling of feathers, such pruning of coats,\n     Such chirping, such whistling, such clearing of throats,\n     Such polishing bills, and such oiling of pinions,\n     Had never been known in the biped dominions.\n                                       Peacock at Home.\n\n\nEtheldred was thankful for that confidence to Meta Rivers, for without\nit, she would hardly have succeeded in spurring Norman up to give the\nfinishing touches to Decius, and to send him in. If she talked of the\npoem as the devotion of Decius, he was willing enough, and worked with\nspirit, for he liked the ideas, and enjoyed the expressing them, and\ntrying to bring his lines to his notion of perfection, but if she called\nit the “Newdigate,” or the “Prize Poem,” and declared herself sure it\nwould be successful, he yawned, slackened, leaned back in his chair,\nand began to read other people’s poetry, which Ethel was disrespectful\nenough not to think nearly as good as his own.\n\nIt was completed at last, and Ethel stitched it up with a narrow red and\nwhite ribbon--the Balliol colours; and set Meta at him till a promise\nwas extorted that he would send it in.\n\nAnd, in due time, Ethel received the following note:\n\n\n“My Dear Ethel,--\n\n“My peacock bubble has flown over the house.\nTell them all about it.\n\nYour affectionate,\n                                          N. W. M.”\n\n\nThey were too much accustomed to Norman’s successes to be\nextraordinarily excited; Ethel would have been much mortified if the\nprize had been awarded to any one else, but, as it was, it came rather\nas a matter of course. The doctor was greatly pleased, and said he\nshould drive round by Abbotstoke to tell the news there, and then\nlaughed beyond measure to hear that Meta had been in the plot, saying\nhe should accuse the little humming-bird of being a magpie, stealing\nsecrets.\n\nBy this time the bride and bridegroom were writing that they thought of\nsoon returning; they had spent the early spring at Paris, had wandered\nabout in the south of France, and now were at Paris again. Flora’s\nletters were long, descriptive, and affectionate, and she was eager to\nbe kept fully informed of everything at home. As soon as she heard of\nNorman’s success, she wrote a whole budget of letters, declaring that\nshe and George would hear of no refusal; they were going to spend a\nfortnight at Oxford for the Commemoration, and must have Meta and Ethel\nwith them to hear Norman’s poem in the theatre.\n\nDr. May, who already had expressed a hankering to run up for the day and\ntake Ethel with him, was perfectly delighted at the proposal, and so was\nMr. Rivers, but the young ladies made many demurs. Ethel wanted Mary to\ngo in her stead, and had to be told that this would not be by any means\nthe same to the other parties--she could not bear to leave Margaret; it\nwas a long time since there had been letters from the Alcestis, and she\ndid not like to miss being at home when they should come; and Meta, on\nher side, was so unwilling to leave her father that, at last, Dr. May\nscolded them both for a pair of conceited, self-important damsels, who\nthought nothing could go on without them; and next, compared them to\nyoung birds, obliged to be shoved by force into flying.\n\nMeta consented first, on condition that Ethel would; and Ethel found\nthat her whole house would be greatly disappointed if she refused,\nso she proceeded to be grateful, and then discovered how extremely\ndelightful the plan was. Oxford, of which she had heard so much, and\nwhich she had always wished to see! And Norman’s glory--and Meta’s\ncompany--nay, the very holiday, and going from home, were charms enough\nfor a girl of eighteen, who had never been beyond Whitford in her life.\nBesides, to crown all, papa promised that, if his patients would behave\nwell, and not want him too much, he would come up for the one great day.\n\nMr. and Mrs. George Rivers came to Abbotstoke to collect their party.\nThey arrived by a railroad, whose station was nearer to Abbotstoke than\nto Stoneborough, therefore, instead of their visiting the High Street\nby the way, Dr. May, with Ethel and Mary, were invited to dine at the\nGrange, the first evening--a proposal, at least, as new and exciting to\nMary as was the journey to Oxford to her sister.\n\nThe two girls went early, as the travellers had intended to arrive\nbefore luncheon, and, though Ethel said few words, but let Mary rattle\non with a stream of conjectures and questions, her heart was full of\nlongings for her sister, as well as of strange doubts and fears, as to\nthe change that her new life might have made in her.\n\n“There! there!” cried Mary. “Yes! it is Flora! Only she has her hair\ndone in a funny way!”\n\nFlora and Meta were both standing on the steps before the conservatory,\nand Mary made but one bound before she was hugging Flora. Ethel kissed\nher without so much violence, and then saw that Flora was looking very\nwell and bright, more decidedly pretty and elegant than ever, and with\ncertainly no diminution of affection; it was warmer, though rather more\npatronising.\n\n“How natural you look!” was her first exclamation, as she held Mary’s\nhand, and drew Ethel’s arm into hers. “And how is Margaret?”\n\n“Pretty well-but the heat makes her languid--”\n\n“Is there any letter yet?”\n\n“No--”\n\n“I do not see any cause for alarm--letters are so often detained, but,\nof course, she will be anxious. Has she had pain in the back again?”\n\n“Sometimes, but summer always does her good--”\n\n“I shall see her to-morrow--and the Daisy. How do you all get on? Have\nyou broken down yet, Ethel?”\n\n“Oh! we do go on,” said Ethel, smiling; “the worst thing I have done was\nexpecting James to dress the salads with lamp-oil.”\n\n“A Greenland salad! But don’t talk of oil--I have the taste still in my\nmouth after the Pyrennean cookery! Oh! Ethel, you would have been wild\nwith delight in those places!”\n\n“Snowy mountains! Are they not like a fairy-dream to you now? You must\nhave felt at home, as a Scotchwoman’s daughter.”\n\n“Think of the peaks in the sunrise! Oh! I wanted you in the pass of\nRoncevalles, to hear the echo of Roland’s horn. And we saw the cleft\nmade by Roland’s sword in the rocks.”\n\n“Oh! how delightful--and Spain too!”\n\n“Ay, the Isle of Pheasants, where all the conferences took place.”\n\n“Where Louis XIV. met his bride, and Francois I. sealed his treason with\nhis empty flourish--”\n\n“Well, don’t let us fight about Francois I. now; I want to know how Tom\nlikes Eton.”\n\n“He gets on famously. I am so glad he is in the same house with Hector.”\n\n“Mr. Ramsden--how is he?”\n\n“No better; he has not done any duty for weeks. Tomkins and his set want\nto sell the next presentation, but papa hopes to stave that off, for\nthere is a better set than usual in the Town Council this year.”\n\n“Cocksmoor? And how are our friends the muses? I found a note from the\nsecretary telling me that I am elected again. How have they behaved?”\n\n“Pretty well,” said Ethel. “Mrs. Ledwich has been away, so we have had\nfew meetings, and have been pretty quiet, except for an uproar about\nthe mistress beating that Franklin’s girl--and what do you think I did,\nFlora? I made bold to say the woman should show her to papa, to see if\nshe had done her any harm, and he found that it was all a fabrication\nfrom one end to the other. So it ended in the poor girl being expelled,\nand Mary and I have her twice a week, to see if there is any grace in\nher.”\n\n“To reward her!” said Flora. “That is always your way--”\n\n“Why, one cannot give the poor thing quite up,” said Ethel.\n\n“You will manage the ladies at last!” cried Flora.\n\n“Not while Mrs. Ledwich is there!”\n\n“I’ll cope with her! But, come, I want you in my room--”\n\n“May not I come?” said Meta. “I must see when--”\n\nFlora held up her hand, and, while signing invitation, gave an arch look\nto Meta to be silent. Ethel here bethought herself of inquiring after\nMr. Rivers, and then for George.\n\nMr. Rivers was pretty well--George, quite well, and somewhere in the\ngarden; and Meta said that he had such a beard that they would hardly\nknow him; while Flora added that he was delighted with the Oxford\nscheme. Flora’s rooms had been, already, often shown to her sisters,\nwhen Mr. Rivers had been newly furnishing them, with every luxury and\nornament that taste could devise. Her dressing-room, with the large bay\nwindow, commanding a beautiful view of Stoneborough, and filled, but not\ncrowded, with every sort of choice article, was a perfect exhibition to\neyes unaccustomed to such varieties.\n\nMary could have been still amused by the hour, in studying the devices\nand ornaments on the shelves and chiffonieres; and Blanche had romanced\nabout it to the little ones, till they were erecting it into a mythical\npalace.\n\nAnd Flora, in her simple, well-chosen dress, looked, and moved, as if\nshe had been born and bred in the like.\n\nThere were signs of unpacking about the room-Flora’s dressing-case on\nthe table, and some dresses lying on the sofa and ottoman.\n\nMary ran up to them eagerly, and exclaimed at the beautiful shot blue\nand white silk.\n\n“Paris fashions?” said Ethel carelessly.\n\n“Yes; but I don’t parade my own dresses here,” said Flora.\n\n“Whose are they then? Your commissions, Meta?”\n\n“No!” and Meta laughed heartily.\n\n“Your French maid’s then?” said Ethel. “I dare say she dresses quite as\nwell; and the things are too really pretty and simple for an English\nmaid’s taste.”\n\n“I am glad you like them,” said Flora maliciously. “Now, please to be\ngood.”\n\n“Who are they for then?” said Ethel, beginning to be frightened.\n\n“For a young lady, whose brother has got the Newdigate prize, and who is\ngoing to Oxford.”\n\n“Me! Those! But I have not got four backs,” as Ethel saw Meta in fits\nof laughing, and Flora making affirmative signs. Mary gave a ponderous\nspring of ecstasy.\n\n“Come!” said Flora, “you may as well be quiet. Whatever you may like,\nI am not going to have the Newdigate prizeman shown as brother to a\nscarecrow. I knew what you would come to, without me to take care of\nyou. Look at yourself in the glass.”\n\n“I’m sure I see no harm in myself,” said Ethel, turning towards the\npier-glass, and surveying herself--in a white muslin, made high, a black\nsilk mantle, and a brown hat. She had felt very respectable when she set\nout, but she could not avoid a lurking conviction that, beside Flora and\nMeta, it had a scanty, schoolgirl effect. “And,” she continued quaintly,\n“besides, I have really got a new gown on purpose--a good useful silk,\nthat papa chose at Whitford--just the colour of a copper tea-kettle,\nwhere it turns purple.”\n\n“Ethel! you will kill me!” said Meta, sinking back on the sofa.\n\n“And I suppose,” continued Flora, “that you have sent it to\nMiss Broad’s, without any directions, and she will trim it with\nflame-coloured gimp, and glass buttons; and, unless Margaret catches\nyou, you will find yourself ready to set the Thames on fire. No, my dear\ntea-kettle, I take you to Oxford on my own terms, and you had better\nsubmit, without a fuss, and be thankful it is no worse. George wanted me\nto buy you a white brocade, with a perfect flower-garden on it, that you\ncould have examined with a microscope. I was obliged to let him buy that\nlace mantle, to make up to him. Now then, Meta, the scene opens, and\ndiscovers--”\n\nMeta opened the folding-doors into Flora’s bedroom, and thence came\nforward Bellairs and a little brisk Frenchwoman, whom Flora had acquired\nat Paris. The former, who was quite used to adorning Miss Ethel against\nher will, looked as amused as her mistresses; and, before Ethel knew\nwhat was going on, her muslin was stripped off her back, and that\ninstrument of torture, a half made body, was being tried upon her. She\nmade one of her most wonderful grimaces of despair, and stood still. The\ndresses were not so bad after all; they were more tasteful than costly,\nand neither in material nor ornament were otherwise than suitable to the\noccasion and the wearer. It was very kind and thoughtful of Flora--that\nshe could not but feel--nothing had been forgotten, but when Ethel saw\nthe mantles, the ribbons, the collars, the bonnet, all glistening with\nthe French air of freshness and grace, she began to feel doubts and\nhesitations, whether she ought to let her sister go to such an expense\non her account, and privately resolved that the accepting thanks should\nnot be spoken till she should have consulted her father.\n\nIn the meantime, she could only endure, be laughed at by her elders, and\nentertained by Mary’s extreme pleasure in her array. Good Mary--it\nwas more than any comedy to her; she had not one moment’s thought\nof herself, till, when Flora dived into her box, produced a pair of\nbracelets, and fastened them on her comfortable plump arms, her eyes\ngrew wide with wonder, and she felt, at least, two stages nearer\nwomanhood.\n\nFlora had omitted no one. There was a Paris present for every servant at\nhome, and a needle-case even for Cherry Elwood, for which Ethel thanked\nher with a fervency wanting in her own case.\n\nShe accomplished consulting her father on her scruples, and he set her\nmind at rest. He knew that the outlay was a mere trifle to the Riverses,\nand was greatly pleased and touched with the affection that Flora\nshowed; so he only smiled at Ethel’s doubts, and dwelt with heartfelt\ndelight on the beautiful print that she had brought him, from Ary\nScheffer’s picture of the Great Consoler.\n\nFlora was in her glory. To be able to bestow benefits on those whom she\nloved, had been always a favourite vision, and she had the full pleasure\nof feeling how much enjoyment she was causing. They had a very pleasant\nevening; she gave interesting accounts of their tour, and by her appeals\nto her husband, made him talk also. He was much more animated and\nagreeable than Ethel had ever seen him, and was actually laughing,\nand making Mary laugh heartily with his histories of the inns in the\nPyrennees. Old Mr. Rivers looked as proud and happy as possible, and\nwas quite young and gay, having evidently forgotten all his maladies, in\npaying elaborate attention to his daughter-in-law.\n\nEthel told Margaret, that night, that she was quite satisfied about\nFlora--she was glad to own that she had done her injustice, and that\nNorman was right in saying there was more in George Rivers than met the\neye.\n\nThe morning spent at home was equally charming. Flora came back, with\nlove strengthened by absence. She was devoted to Margaret--caressing to\nall; she sat in her old places; she fulfilled her former offices; she\ngratified Miss Bracy by visiting her in the schoolroom, and talking of\nFrench books; and won golden opinions, by taking Gertrude in her hand,\nand walking to Minster Street to call on Mrs. Hoxton, as in old times,\nand take her the newest foreign device of working to kill time.\n\nSo a few days passed merrily away, and the great journey commenced.\nEthel met the Abbotstoke party at the station, and, with a parting\ninjunction to her father, that he was to give all his patients a\nsleeping potion, that they might not miss him, she was carried away from\nStoneborough.\n\nMeta was in her gayest mood; Ethel full of glee and wonder, for once\nbeyond Whitford, the whole world was new to her; Flora more quiet, but\ngreatly enjoying their delight, and George not saying much, but smiling\nunder his beard, as if well pleased to be so well amused with so little\ntrouble.\n\nHe took exceeding care of them, and fed them with everything he could\nmake them eat at the Swindon Station, asking for impossible things, and\nwishing them so often to change for something better, that, if they had\nbeen submissive, they would have had no luncheon at all; and, as it was,\nFlora was obliged to whisk into the carriage with her last sandwich in\nher hand.\n\n“I am the more sorry,” said he, after grumbling at the allotted ten\nminutes, “as we shall dine so late. You desired Norman to bring any\nfriend he liked, did you not, Flora?”\n\n“Yes, and he spoke of bringing our old friend, Charles Cheviot, and Mr.\nOgilvie,” said Flora.\n\n“Mr. Ogilvie!” said Ethel, “the Master of Glenbracken! Oh! I am so glad!\nI have wanted so much to see him!”\n\n“Ah! he is a great hero of yours?” said Flora.\n\n“Do you know him?” said Meta.\n\n“No; but he is a great friend of Norman’s, and a Scottish cousin--Norman\nOgilvie. Norman has his name from the Ogilvies.”\n\n“Our grandmother, Mrs. Mackenzie, was a daughter of Lord Glenbracken,”\n said Flora.\n\n“This man might be called the Master of Glenbracken at home,” said\nEthel. “It is such a pretty title, and there is a beautiful history\nbelonging to them. There was a Master of Glenbracken who carried James\nIV.’s standard at Flodden, and would not yield, and was killed with it\nwrapped round his body, and the Lion was dyed with his blood. Mamma knew\nsome scraps of a ballad about him. Then they were out with Montrose,\nand had their castle burned by the Covenanters, and since that they have\nbeen Jacobites, and one barely escaped being beheaded at Carlisle! I\nwant to hear the rights of it. Norman is to go, some time or other, to\nstay at Glenbracken.”\n\n“Yes,” said Flora, “coming down to times present, this young heir seems\nworthy of his race. They are pattern people--have built a church, and\nhave all their tenantry in excellent order. This is the only son, and\nvery good and clever--he preferred going to Balliol, that he might work;\nbut he is a great sportsman, George,” added she; “you will get on with\nhim very well, about fishing, and grouse shooting, I dare say.”\n\nNorman met them at the station, and there was great excitement at seeing\nhis long nose under his college cap. He looked rather thin and worn, but\nbrightened at the sight of the party. After the question--whether\nthere had been any letters from Harry? he asked whether his father\nwere coming?--and Ethel thought he seemed nervous at the idea of this\naddition to his audience. He saw them to their hotel, and, promising\nthem his two guests, departed.\n\nEthel watched collegiate figures passing in the street, and recollected\nthe gray buildings, just glimpsed at in her drive--it was dreamy and\nconfused, and she stood musing, not discovering that it was time to\ndress, till Flora and her Frenchwoman came in, and laid violent hands on\nher.\n\nThe effect of their manipulations was very successful. Ethel was made to\nlook well-dressed, and, still more, distinguished. Her height told well,\nwhen her lankiness was overcome, and her hair was disposed so as to set\noff her features to advantage. The glow of amusement and pleasure did\nstill more for her; and Norman, who was in the parlour when the sisters\nappeared, quite started with surprise and satisfaction at her aspect.\n\n“Well done. Flora!” he said. “Why! I have been telling Ogilvie that one\nof my sisters was very plain!”\n\n“Then, I hope we have been preparing an agreeable surprise for him,”\n said Flora. “Ethel is very much obliged to you. By the bye,” she said,\nin her universal amity, “I must ask Harvey Anderson to dinner one of\nthese days?” Norman started, and his face said “Don’t.”\n\n“Oh, very well; it is as you please. I thought it would please\nStoneborough, and that Edward was a protege of yours. What has he been\ndoing? Did we not hear he had been distinguishing himself? Dr. Hoxton\nwas boasting of his two scholars.”\n\n“Ask him,” said Norman hurriedly. “At least,” said he, “do not let\nanything from me prevent you.”\n\n“Has he been doing anything wrong?” reiterated Flora.\n\n“Not that I know of,” was the blunt answer; and, at the same instant,\nMr. Ogilvie arrived. He was a pleasant, high-bred looking gentleman,\nbrown-complexioned, and dark-eyed, with a brisk and resolute cast\nof countenance, that, Ethel thought, might have suited the Norman of\nGlenbracken, who died on the ruddy Lion of Scotland, and speaking with\nthe very same slight degree of Scottish intonation as she remembered in\nher mother, making a most home-like sound in her ears.\n\nPresently, the rest of their own party came down, and, soon after,\nCharles Cheviot appeared, looking as quiet and tame, as he used to be in\nthe schoolboy days, when Norman would bring him home, and he used to be\ntoo shy to speak a word.\n\nHowever, he had learned the use of his tongue by this time, though it\nwas a very soft one; and he stood by Ethel, asking many questions about\nStoneborough, while something, apparently very spirited and amusing, was\ngoing on between the others.\n\nThe dinner went off well--there were few enough for the conversation to\nbe general. The young men began to strike out sparks of wit against each\nother--Flora put in a word or two--Ethel grew so much interested in the\ndiscussion, that her face lighted up, and she joined in it, as if it had\nbeen only between her father and brother--keen, clear, and droll. After\nthat, she had her full share in the conversation, and enjoyed it so much\nthat, when she left the dinner-table, she fetched her writing-case to\nsketch the colloquy for Margaret and her father.\n\nFlora exclaimed at her for never allowing any one to think of rest. Meta\nsaid she should like to do the same, but it was impossible now; she did\nnot know how she should ever settle down to write a letter. Ethel was\nsoon interrupted--the gentlemen entered, and Mr. Ogilvie came to the\nwindow, where she was sitting, and began to tell her how much obliged\nto her he and his college were, for having insisted on her brother’s\nsending in his poem. “Thanks are due, for our being spared an infliction\nnext week,” he said.\n\n“Have you seen it?” she asked, and she was amused by the quick negative\nmovement of his head.\n\n“I read my friend’s poems? But our lungs are prepared! Will you give\nme my cue--it is of no use to ask him when we are to deafen you. One\ngenerally knows the crack passages--something beginning with ‘Oh,\nwoman!’ but it is well to be in readiness--if you would only forewarn me\nof the telling hits?”\n\n“If they cannot tell themselves,” said Ethel, smiling, “I don’t think\nthey deserve the name.”\n\n“Perhaps you think what does tell on the undergraduates, collectively,\nis not always what ought to tell on them.”\n\n“I don’t know. I dare say the same would not be a favourite with them\nand with me.”\n\n“I should like to know which are your favourites. No doubt you have a\ncopy here--made by yourself;” and he looked towards her paper-case.\n\nThere was the copy, and she took it out, peering to see whether Norman\nwere looking.\n\n“Let me see,” he said, as she paused to open the MS., “he told me the\nthoughts were more yours than his own.”\n\n“Did he? That was not fair. One thought was an old one, long ago talked\nover between us; the rest is all his own.”\n\nHere Mr. Ogilvie took the paper, and Ethel saw his countenance show\nevident tokens of surprise and feeling.\n\n“Yes,” he said presently, “May goes deep--deeper than most men--though I\ndoubt whether they will applaud this.”\n\n“I should like it better if they did not,” said Ethel. “It is rather to\nbe felt than shouted at.”\n\n“And I don’t know how the world would go on if it were felt. Few men\nwould do much without the hope of fame,” said Norman Ogilvie.\n\n“Is it the question what they would do?” said Ethel.\n\n“So you call fame a low motive? I see where your brother’s philosophy\ncomes from.”\n\n“I do not call it a low motive--” Her pause was expressive.\n\n“Nor allow that the Non omnis moriar of Horace has in it something\ndivine?”\n\n“For a heathen--yes.”\n\n“And pray, what would you have the moving spring?”\n\n“Duty.”\n\n“Would not that end in ‘Mine be a cot, beside the rill’?” said he, with\nan intonation of absurd sentiment.\n\n“Well, and suppose an enemy came, would duty prompt not the Hay with the\njoke--or Winkelried on the spears?”\n\n“Nay, why not--‘It is my duty to take care of Lucy.’”\n\n“Then Lucy ought to be broken on her own wheel.”\n\n“Not at all! It is Lucy’s duty to keep her Colin from running into\ndanger.”\n\n“I hope there are not many Lucies who would think so.”\n\n“I agree with you. Most would rather have Colin killed than disgraced.”\n\n“To be sure!” then, perceiving a knowing twinkle, as if he thought she\nhad made an admission, she added, “but what is disgrace?”\n\n“Some say it is misfortune,” said Mr. Ogilvie.\n\n“Is it not failure in duty?” said Ethel.\n\n“Well!”\n\n“Colin’s first duty is to his king and country. If he fail in that, he\nis disgraced, in his own eyes, before Heaven and men. If he does it,\nthere is a reward, which seems to me a better, more powerful motive\nfor Lucy to set before him than ‘My dear, I hope you will distinguish\nyourself,’ when the fact is,\n\n\n                “‘England has forty thousand men,\n                   We trust, as good as he.’\n\n\n“‘Victory or Westminster Abbey!’ is a tolerable war-cry,” said Mr.\nOgilvie.\n\n“Not so good as ‘England expects every man to do his duty.’ That serves\nfor those who cannot look to Westminster Abbey.”\n\n“Ah! you are an English woman!”\n\n“Only by halves. I had rather have been the Master of Glenbracken at\nFlodden than King James, or”--for she grew rather ashamed of having\nbeen impelled to utter the personal allusion--“better to have been the\nSwinton or the Gordon at Homildon than all the rest put together.”\n\n“I always thought Swinton a pig-headed old fellow, and I have little\ndoubt that my ancestor was a young ruffian,” coolly answered the Master\nof Glenbracken.\n\n“Why?” was all that Ethel could say in her indignation.\n\n“It was the normal state of Scottish gentlemen,” he answered.\n\n“If I thought you were in earnest, I should say you did not deserve to\nbe a Scot.”\n\n“And so you wish to make me out a fause Scot!”\n\n“Ogilvie!” called Norman, “are you fighting Scottish and English battles\nwith Ethel there? We want you to tell us which will be the best day for\ngoing to Blenheim.”\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent in arranging the programme of their\nlionising, in which it appeared that the Scottish cousin intended to\ntake his full share. Ethel was not sorry, for he interested her much,\nwhile provoking her. She was obliged to put out her full strength in\nanswering him, and felt, at the same time, that he was not making any\neffort in using the arguments that puzzled her--she was in earnest,\nwhile he was at play; and, though there was something teasing in this,\nand she knew it partook of what her brothers called chaffing, it gave\nher that sense of power on his side, which is always attractive to\nwomen. With the knowledge that, through Norman, she had of his real\ncharacter, she understood that half, at least, of what he said was jest;\nand the other half was enough in earnest to make it exciting to argue\nwith him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\n\n     While I, thy dearest, sat apart,\n     And felt thy triumphs were as mine,\n     And lov’d them more than they were thine.\n                                            TENNYSON.\n\n\nThat was a week of weeks; the most memorable week in Ethel’s life, spent\nin indefatigable sight-seeing. College Chapels, Bodleian Library, Taylor\nGallery, the Museum, all were thoroughly studied, and, if Flora had not\ndragged the party on, in mercy to poor George’s patience, Ethel would\nnever have got through a day’s work.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Ogilvie, when annoyed at being hurried in going over\nMerton Chapel with her, was heard to whisper that he acted the part of\npoliceman, by a perpetual “move on”; and as Ethel recollected the portly\nform and wooden face of the superintendent at Stoneborough, she was\nafraid that the comparison would not soon be forgotten. Norman Ogilvie\nseemed to consider himself bound to their train as much as his namesake,\nor, as on the second morning, Norman reported his reasoning, it was that\na man must walk about with somebody on Commemoration week, and that it\nwas a comfort to do so with ladies who wore their bonnets upon their\nheads, instead of, like most of those he met, remind him of what Cock\nRobin said to Jenny Wren in that matrimonial quarrel, when\n\n\n             Robin, he grew angry,\n             Hopped upon a twig--\n\n\nFlora was extremely delighted, and, in matronly fashion, told her sister\nthat people were always respected and admired who had the strength of\nmind to resist unsuitable customs. Ethel laughed in answer, and said\nshe thought it would take a great deal more strength of mind to go about\nwith her whole visage exposed to the universal gaze; and, woman-like,\nthey had a thorough gossip over the evils of the “backsliding”\n head-gear.\n\nNorman had retreated from it into the window, when Flora returned to the\ncharge about Harvey Anderson. She had been questioning their old friend\nMr. Everard, and had learned from him that the cause of the hesitation\nwith which his name had been received was that he had become imbued with\nsome of the Rationalistic ideas current in some quarters. He seldom met\nNorman May without forcing on him debates, which were subjects of great\ninterest to the hearers, as the two young men were considered as the\nmost distinguished representatives of their respective causes, among\ntheir own immediate contemporaries. Norman’s powers of argument, his\neloquence, readiness, and clearness, were thought to rank very high,\nand, in the opinion of Mr. Everard, had been of great effect in\npreventing other youths from being carried away by the specious\nbrilliancy of his rival.\n\nEthel valued this testimony far above the Newdigate prize, and she was\nextremely surprised by hearing Flora declare her intention of still\nasking Mr. Anderson to dinner, only consulting her brother as to the\nday.\n\n“Why, Flora! ask him! Norman--”\n\nNorman had turned away with the simple answer, “any day.”\n\n“Norman is wiser than you are, Ethel,” said Flora. “He knows that\nStoneborough would be up in arms at any neglect from us to one of the\nAndersons, and, considering the rivalship, it is the more graceful, and\nbecoming.”\n\n“I do not think it right,” said Ethel stoutly; “I believe that a line\nought to be drawn, and that we ought not to associate with people who\nopenly tamper with their faith.”\n\n“Never fear,” smiled Flora; “I promise you that there shall be no\ndebates at my table.”\n\nEthel felt the force of the pronoun, and, as Flora walked out of the\nroom, she went up to Norman, who had been resting his brow against the\nwindow.\n\n“It is vain to argue with her,” she said; “but, Norman, do not you think\nit is clearly wrong to seek after men who desert and deny--”\n\nShe stopped short, frightened at his pale look.\n\nHe spoke in a low clear tone that seemed to thrill her with a sort of\nalarm. “If the secrets of men’s hearts were probed, who could cast the\nfirst stone?”\n\n“I don’t want to cast stones,” she began; but he made a gesture as if he\nwould not hear, and, at the same moment, Mr. Ogilvie entered the room.\n\nHad Ethel been at home, she would have pondered much over her brother’s\nmeaning--here she had no leisure. Not only was she fully occupied with\nthe new scenes around her, but her Scottish cousin took up every moment\nopen to conversation. He was older than Norman, and had just taken\nhis degree, and he talked with that superior aplomb, which a few years\nbestow at their time of life, without conceit, but more hopeful and\nambitious, and with higher spirits than his cousin.\n\nThough industrious and distinguished, he had not avoided society or\namusement, was a great cricketer and tennis-player, one of the “eight”\n whose success in the boat races was one of Norman’s prime interests,\nand he told stories of frolics that reminded Ethel of her father’s old\nCambridge adventures.\n\nHe was a new variety in her eyes, and entertained her greatly. Where the\nbounds of banter ended, was not easy to define, but whenever he tried\na little mystification, she either entered merrily into the humour, or\nthrew it over with keen wit that he kept constantly on the stretch. They\nwere always discovering odd, unexpected bits of knowledge in each other,\nand a great deal more accordance in views and opinions than appealed on\nthe surface, for his enthusiasm usually veiled itself in persiflage on\nhers, though he was too good and serious to carry it too far.\n\nAt Blenheim, perhaps he thought he had given an overdose of nonsense,\nand made her believe, as Meta really did, that the Duchess Sarah was\nhis model woman; for as they walked in the park in search of Phoebe\nMayflower’s well, he gathered a fern leaf, to show her the Glenbracken\nbadge, and talked to her of his home, his mother, and his sister\nMarjorie, and the little church in the rocky glen. He gave the history\nof the stolen meetings of the little knot of churchmen during the days\nof persecution, and showed a heart descended straight from the Ogilvie\nwho was “out with Montrose,” now that the upper structure of young\nEngland was for a little while put aside.\n\nAfter this, she took his jokes much more coolly, and made thrusts\nbeneath them, which he seemed to enjoy, and caused him to unfold himself\nthe more. She liked him all the better for finding that he thought\nNorman had been a very good friend to him, and that he admired her\nbrother heartily, watching tenderly over his tendencies to make himself\nunhappy. He confided to her that, much as he rejoiced in the defeats\nof Anderson, he feared that the reading and thought consequent on the\ndiscussions, had helped to overstrain Norman’s mind, and he was very\nanxious to carry him away from all study, and toil, and make his brains\nrest, and his eyes delight themselves upon Scottish mountains.\n\nThereupon came vivid descriptions of the scenery, especially his own\nglen with the ruined tower, and ardent wishes that his cousin Ethel\ncould see them also, and know Marjorie. She could quite echo the wish,\nEdinburgh and Loch Katrine had been the visions of her life, and now\nthat she had once taken the leap and left home, absence did not seem\nimpossible, and, with a start of delight, she hailed her own conviction\nthat he intended his mother to invite the party to Glenbracken.\n\nAfter Norman’s visit, Mr. Ogilvie declared that he must come home with\nhim and pay his long-promised visit to Stoneborough. He should have come\nlong ago. He had been coming last winter, but the wedding had prevented\nhim; he had always wished to know Dr. May, whom his father well\nremembered, and now nothing should keep him away!\n\nFlora looked on amused and pleased at Ethel’s development--her\nabruptness softened into piquancy, and her countenance so embellished,\nthat the irregularity only added to the expressiveness. There was no\nsaying what Ethel would come to! She had not said that she would not go\nto the intended ball, and her grimaces at the mention of it were growing\nfainter every day.\n\nThe discussion about Harvey Anderson was never revived; Flora sent\nthe invitation without another word--he came with half a dozen other\ngentlemen--Ethel made him a civil greeting, but her head was full of\nboats and the procession day, about which Mr. Ogilvie was telling her,\nand she thought of him no more.\n\n“A lucky step!” thought Flora. “A grand thing for Ethel--a capital\nconnection for us all. Lady Glenbracken will not come too much into my\nsphere either. Yes, I am doing well by my sisters.”\n\nIt would make stay-at-home people giddy to record how much pleasure,\nhow much conversation and laughter were crowded into those ten days, and\nwith much thought and feeling beside them, for these were not girls on\nwhom grave Oxford could leave no impression but one of gaiety.\n\nThe whole party was very full of merriment. Norman May, especially, on\nwhom Flora contrived to devolve that real leadership of conversation\nthat should rightly have belonged to George Rivers, kept up the ball\nwith wit and drollery far beyond what he usually put forth; enlivened\nGeorge into being almost an agreeable man, and drew out little Meta’s\nvivacity into sunny sparkles.\n\nMeta generally had Norman for her share, and seemed highly contented\nwith his lionisings, which were given much more quietly and copiously\nthan those which his cousin bestowed upon his sister. Or if there were\nanything enterprising to be done, any tower to be mounted, or anything\nwith the smallest spice of danger in it, Meta was charmed, and with her\nlightness and airiness of foot and figure, and perfectly feminine ways,\nshowed a spirit of adventure that added to the general diversion. But if\nshe were to be helped up or down anywhere, she certainly seemed to\nfind greater security in Norman May’s assistance, though it was but a\nfeather-like touch that she ever used to aid her bounding step.\n\nBoth as being diffident, and, in a manner at home, Norman was not as\nconstantly her cavalier as was Mr. Ogilvie to his sister; and, when\nsupplanted, his wont was either to pioneer for Flora, or, if she did not\nneed him, to walk alone, grave and abstracted. There was a weight on his\nbrow, when nothing was going on to drive it away, and whether it were\nnervousness as to the performance in store for him, anxiety about Harry,\nor, as Mr. Ogilvie said, too severe application; some burden hung upon\nhim, that was only lightened for the time by his participation in the\nenjoyment of the party.\n\nOn Sunday evening, when they had been entering into the almost\nvision-like delight of the choicest of music, and other accompaniments\nof church service, they went to walk in Christchurch Meadows. They\nhad begun altogether by comparing feelings--Ethel wondering whether\nStoneborough Minster would ever be used as it might be, and whether, if\nso, they should be practically the better for it; and proceeding with\nmetaphysics on her side, and satire on Norman Ogilvie’s, to speculate\nwhether that which is, is best, and the rights and wrongs of striving\nfor change and improvements, what should begin from above, and what from\nbeneath--with illustrations often laughter-moving, though they were\nmuch in earnest, as the young heir of Glenbracken looked into his future\nlife.\n\nFlora had diverged into wondering who would have the living after poor\nold Mr. Ramsden, and walked, keeping her husband amused with instances\nof his blunders.\n\nMeta, as with Norman she parted from the rest, thought her own dear\nAbbotstoke church, and Mr Charles Wilmot, great subjects for content and\nthanksgiving, though it was a wonderful treat to see and hear such as\nshe had enjoyed to-day; and she thought it was a joy, to carry away\nabidingly, to know that praise and worship, as near perfection as this\nearth could render them, were being offered up.\n\nNorman understood her thought, but responded by more of a sigh than was\nquite comfortable.\n\nMeta went on with her own thoughts, on the connection between worship\nand good works, how the one leads to the other, and how praise with pure\nlips is, after all, the great purpose of existence.--Her last thought\nshe spoke aloud.\n\n“I suppose everything, our own happiness and all, are given to us to\nturn into praise,” she said.\n\n“Yes--” echoed Norman; but as if his thoughts were not quite with hers,\nor rather in another part of the same subject; then recalling himself,\n“Happy such as can do so.”\n\n“If one only could--” said Meta.\n\n“You can--don’t say otherwise,” exclaimed Norman; “I know, at least,\nthat you and my father can.”\n\n“Dr. May does so, more than any one I know,” said Meta.\n\n“Yes,” said Norman again; “it is his secret of joy. To him, it is never,\nI am half sick of shadows.”\n\n“To him they are not shadows, but foretastes,” said Meta. Silence again;\nand when she spoke, she said, “I have always thought it must be such a\nhappiness to have power of any kind that can be used in direct service,\nor actual doing good.”\n\n“No,” said Norman. “Whatever becomes a profession, becomes an\nunreality.”\n\n“Surely not, in becoming a duty,” said Meta.\n\n“Not for all,” he answered; “but where the fabric erected by ourselves,\nin the sight of the world, is but an outer case, a shell of mere words,\nblown up for the occasion, strung together as mere language;\nthen, self-convicted, we shrink within the husk, and feel our own\nworthlessness and hypocrisy.”\n\n“As one feels in reproving the school children for behaving ill at\nchurch?” said Meta.\n\n“You never felt anything approaching to it!” said Norman. “To know\noneself to be such a deception, that everything else seems a delusion\ntoo!”\n\n“I don’t know whether that is metaphysical,” said Meta, “but I am sure\nI don’t understand it. One must know oneself to be worse than one knows\nany one else to be.”\n\n“I could not wish you to understand,” said Norman; and yet he seemed\nimpelled to go on; for, after a hesitating silence, he added, “When the\nwanderer in the desert fears that the spring is but a mirage; or when\nall that is held dear is made hazy or distorted by some enchanter, what\ndo you think are the feelings, Meta?”\n\n“It must be dreadful,” she said, rather bewildered; “but he may know\nit is a delusion, if he can but wake. Has he not always a spell, a\ncharm?--”\n\n“What is the spell?” eagerly said Norman, standing still.\n\n“Believe--” said Meta, hardly knowing how she came to choose the words.\n\n“I believe!” he repeated. “What--when we go beyond the province of\nreason--human, a thing of sense after all! How often have I so answered.\nBut Meta, when a man has been drawn, in self-sufficient security, to\nlook into a magic mirror, and cannot detach his eyes from the confused,\nmisty scene--where all that had his allegiance appears shattered,\noverthrown, like a broken image, or at least unable to endure\nexamination, then--”\n\n“Oh, Norman, is that the trial to any one here? I thought old Oxford was\nthe great guardian nurse of truth! I am sure she cannot deal in magic\nmirrors or such frightful things. Do you know you are talking like a\nvery horrible dream?”\n\n“I believe I am in one,” said Norman.\n\n“To be sure you are. Wake!” said Meta, looking up, smiling in his\nface. “You have read yourself into a maze, that’s all--what Mary calls,\nmuzzling your head; you don’t really think all this, and when you get\ninto the country, away from books, you will forget it. One look at our\ndear old purple Welsh hills will blow away all the mists!”\n\n“I ought not to have spoken in this manner,” said Norman sadly. “Forget\nit, Meta.”\n\n“Forget it! Of course I will. It is all nonsense, and meant to be\nforgotten,” said Meta, laughing. “You will own that it is by-and-by.”\n\nHe gave a deep sigh.\n\n“Don’t think I am unfeeling,” she said; “but I know it is all a fog\nup from books, books, books--I should like to drive it off with a good\nfresh gust of wind! Oh! I wish those yellow lilies would grow in our\nriver!”\n\nMeta talked away gaily for the rest of the walk. She was anything but\nunfeeling, but she had a confidence in Norman that forbade her to see\nanything here but one of his variations of spirits, which always sank in\nthe hour of triumph. She put forth her brightness to enliven him, and,\nin their subsequent tete-a-tetes, she avoided all that could lead to a\nrenewal of this conversation. Ethel would not have rested till it had\nbeen fought out. Meta thought it so imaginary, that it had better die\nfor want of the aliment of words; certainly, hers could not reach an\nintellect like his, and she would only soothe and amuse him. Dr. May,\nmind-curer as well as body-curer, would soon be here, to put the climax\nto the general joy and watch his own son.\n\nHe did arrive; quite prepared to enjoy, giving an excellent account of\nboth homes; Mr. Rivers very well, and the Wilmots taking care of him,\nand Margaret as comfortable as usual, Mary making a most important and\ncapable little housekeeper, Miss Bracy as good as possible. He talked\nas if they had all nourished the better for Ethel’s absence, but he had\nevidently missed her greatly, as he showed, without knowing it, by his\ninstant eagerness to have her to himself. Even Norman, prizeman as he\nwas, was less wanted. There was proud affection, eager congratulation,\nfor him, but it was Ethel to whom he wanted to tell everything that had\npassed during her absence--whom he treated as if they were meeting after\na tedious separation.\n\nThey dined rather early, and went out afterwards, to walk down the High\nStreet to Christchurch Meadow. Norman and Ethel had been anxious for\nthis; they thought it would give their father the best idea of the tout\nensemble of Oxford, and were not without hopes of beating him by his own\nconfession, in that standing fight between him and his sons, as to the\nbeauties of Oxford and Cambridge--a fight in which, hitherto, they had\nbeen equally matched--neither partisan having seen the rival University.\n\nFlora stayed at home; she owned herself fairly tired by her arduous\nduties of following the two young ladies about, and was very glad\nto give her father the keeping of them. Dr. May held out his arm to\nEthel--Norman secured his peculiar property. Ethel could have preferred\nthat it should be otherwise--Norman would have no companion but George\nRivers; how bored he would be!\n\nAll through the streets, while she was telling her father the names of\nthe buildings, she was not giving her whole attention; she was trying\nto guess, from the sounds behind, whether Mr. Ogilvie were accompanying\nthem. They entered the meadows--Norman turned round, with a laugh, to\ndefy the doctor to talk of the Cam, on the banks of the Isis. The\nparty stood still--the other two gentlemen came up. They amalgamated\nagain--all the Oxonians conspiring to say spiteful things of the Cam,\nand Dr. May making a spirited defence, in which Ethel found herself\nimpelled to join.\n\nIn the wide gravelled path, they proceeded in threes; George attached\nhimself to his sister and Norman. Mr. Ogilvie came to Ethel’s other\nside, and began to point out all the various notabilities. Ethel was\nhappy again; her father was so much pleased and amused, with him, and he\nwith her father, that it was a treat to look on.\n\nPresently Dr. May, as usual, always meeting with acquaintances, fell in\nwith a county neighbour, and Ethel had another pleasant aside, until her\nfather claimed her, and Mr. Ogilvie was absorbed among another party,\nand lost to her sight.\n\nHe came to tea, but, by that time, Dr. May had established himself in\nthe chair which had hitherto been appropriated to her cousin, a chair\nthat cut her nook off from the rest of the world, and made her the\nexclusive possession of the occupant. There was a most interesting\nhistory for her to hear, of a meeting with the Town Council, which\nshe had left pending, when Dr. May had been battling to save the next\npresentation of the living from being sold.\n\nFew subjects could affect Ethel more nearly, yet she caught herself\nmissing the thread of his discourse, in trying to hear what Mr. Ogilvie\nwas saying to Flora about a visit to Glenbracken.\n\nThe time came for the two Balliol men to take their leave. Norman May\nhad been sitting very silent all the evening, and Meta, who was near\nhim, respected his mood. When he said good-night, he drew Ethel outside\nthe door. “Ethel,” he said, “only one thing: do ask my father not to put\non his spectacles to-morrow.”\n\n“Very well,” said Ethel, half smiling; “Richard did not mind them.”\n\n“Richard has more humility--I shall break down if he looks at me! I wish\nyou were all at home.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nThe other Norman came out of the sitting-room at the moment, and heard\nthe last words.\n\n“Never mind,” said he to Ethel, “I’ll take care of him. He shall comport\nhimself as if you were all at Nova Zembla. A pretty fellow to talk of\ndespising fame, and then get a fit of stage-fright!”\n\n“Well, good-night,” said Norman, sighing. “It will be over to-morrow;\nonly remember the spectacles.”\n\nDr. May laughed a good deal at the request, and asked if the rest of\nthe party were to be blindfolded. Meta wondered that Ethel should have\nmentioned the request so publicly; she was a good deal touched by it,\nand she thought Dr. May ought to be so.\n\nGood-night was said, and Dr. May put his arm round Ethel, and gave her\nthe kiss that she had missed for seven nights. It was very homelike,\nand it brought a sudden flash of thought across Ethel! What had she been\ndoing? She had been impatient of her father’s monopoly of her!\n\nShe parted with Flora, and entered the room she shared with Meta, where\nBellairs waited to attend her little mistress. Few words passed between\nthe two girls, and those chiefly on the morrow’s dress. Meta had some\nfixed ideas--she should wear pink. Norman had said he liked her pink\nbonnet, and then she could put down her white veil, so that he could be\ncertain that she was not looking; Ethel vaguely believed Flora meant to\nwear--something--\n\nBellairs went away, and Meta gave expression to her eager hope that\nNorman would go through it well. If he would only read it as he did last\nEaster to her and Ethel.\n\n“He will,” said Ethel. “This nervousness always wears off when it comes\nto the point, and he warms with his subject.”\n\n“Oh! but think of all the eyes looking at him!”\n\n“Our’s are all that he really cares for, and he will think of none of\nthem, when he begins. No, Meta, you must not encourage him in it. Papa\nsays, if he did not think it half morbid--the result of the shock to his\nnerves--he should be angry with it as a sort of conceit!”\n\n“I should have thought that the last thing to be said of Norman!” said\nMeta, with a little suppressed indignation.\n\n“It was once in his nature,” said Ethel; “and I think it is the fault\nhe most beats down. There was a time, before you knew him, when he would\nhave been vain and ambitious.”\n\n“Then it is as they say, conquered faults grow to be the opposite\nvirtues!” said Meta. “How very good he is, Ethel; one sees it more when\nhe is with other people, and one hears all these young men’s stories!”\n\n“Everything Norman does not do, is not therefore wrong,” said Ethel,\nwith her usual lucidity of expression.\n\n“Don’t you like him the better for keeping out of all these follies?”\n\n“Norman does not call them so, I am sure.”\n\n“No, he is too good to condemn--”\n\n“It is not only that,” said Ethel. “I know papa thinks that the first\ngrief, coming at his age, and in the manner it did, checked and subdued\nhis spirits, so that he has little pleasure in those things. And he\nalways meant to be a clergyman, which acted as a sort of consecration on\nhim; but many things are innocent; and I do believe papa would like it\nbetter, if Norman were less grave.”\n\n“Yes,” said Meta, remembering the Sunday talk, “but still, he would not\nbe all he is--so different from others--”\n\n“Of course, I don’t mean less good, only, less grave,” said Ethel, “and\ncertainly less nervous. But, perhaps, it is a good thing; dear mamma\nthought his talents would have been a greater temptation than they seem\nto be, subdued as he has been. I only meant that you must not condemn\nall that Norman does not do. Now, goodnight.”\n\nVery different were the feelings with which those two young girls\nstretched themselves in their beds that night. Margaret Rivers’s\ninnocent, happy little heart was taken up in one contemplation.\nAdmiration, sympathy, and the exultation for him, which he would not\nfeel for himself, drew little Meta entirely out of herself--a self that\nnever held her much. She was proud of the slender thread of connection\nbetween them; she was confident that his vague fancies were but the\nscruples of a sensitive mind, and, as she fell sound asleep, she\nmurmured broken lines of Decius, mixed with promises not to look.\n\nEtheldred heard them, for there was no sleep for her. She had a parley\nto hold with herself, and to accuse her own feelings of having been\nunkind, ungrateful, undutiful towards her father. What had a fit of\nvanity brought her to? that she should have been teased by what would\nnaturally have been her greatest delight! her father’s pleasure in being\nwith her. Was this the girl who had lately vowed within herself that her\nfather should be her first earthly object?\n\nAt first, Ethel blamed herself for her secret impatience, but another\nconviction crossed her, and not an unpleasing one, though it made her\ncheeks tingle with maidenly shame, at having called it up. Throughout\nthis week, Norman Ogilvie had certainly sought her out. He had looked\ndisappointed this evening--there was no doubt that he was attracted by\nher--by her, plain, awkward Ethel! Such a perception assuredly never\ngave so much pleasure to a beauty as it did to Ethel, who had always\nbelieved herself far less good-looking than she really was. It was a\ngleam of delight, and, though she set herself to scold it down, the\nconviction was elastic, and always leaped up again.\n\nThat resolution came before her, but it had been unspoken; it could not\nbe binding, and, if her notion were really right, the misty brilliant\nfuture of mutual joy dazzled her! But there was another side: her father\noppressed and lonely, Margaret ill and pining, Mary, neither companion\nnor authority, the children running wild; and she, who had mentally\nvowed never to forsake her father, far away, enjoying her own happiness.\n“Ah! that resolve had seemed easy enough when it was made, when,”\n thought Ethel, “I fancied no one could care for me! Shame on me! Now is\nthe time to test it! I must go home with papa.”\n\nIt was a great struggle--on one side there was the deceitful guise of\nmodesty, telling her it was absurd to give so much importance to the\nkindness of the first cousin with whom she had ever been thrown; there\nwas the dislike to vex Flora to make a discussion, and break up the\nparty. There was the desire to hear the concert, to go to the breakfast\nat ---- College, to return round by Warwick Castle, and Kenilworth, as\ndesigned. Should she lose all this for a mere flattering fancy? She, who\nhad laughed at Miss Boulder, for imagining every one who spoke to\nher was smitten. What reason could she assign? It would be simply\nridiculous, and unkind--and it was so very pleasant. Mr. Ogilvie would\nbe too wise to think of so incongruous a connection, which would be so\nsure to displease his parents. It was more absurd than ever to think of\nit. The heir of Glenbracken, and a country physician’s daughter!\n\nThat was a candid heart which owned that its own repugnance to accept\nthis disparity as an objection, was an additional evidence that she\nought to flee from further intercourse. She believed that no harm was\ndone yet; she was sure that she loved her father better than anything\nelse in the world, and whilst she did so, it was best to preserve her\nheart for him. Widowed as he was, she knew that he would sorely miss\nher, and that for years to come, she should be necessary at home. She\nhad better come away while it would cost only a slight pang, for that it\nwas pain to leave Norman Ogilvie, was symptom enough of the need of not\nletting her own silly heart go further. However it might be with him,\nanother week would only make it worse with her.\n\n“I will go home with papa!” was the ultimatum reached by each chain of\nmental reasonings, and borne in after each short prayer for guidance, as\nEthel tossed about listening to the perpetual striking of all the Oxford\nclocks, until daylight had begun to shine in; when she fell asleep, and\nwas only waked by Meta, standing over her with a sponge, looking very\nmischievous, as she reminded her of their appointment with Dr. May, to\ngo to the early service in New College Chapel.\n\nThe world looked different that morning with Ethel, but the\ndetermination was fixed, and the service strengthened it. She was so\nsilent during the walk, that her companions rallied her, and they both\nsupposed she was anxious about Norman; but taking her opportunity, when\nMeta was gone to prepare for breakfast, she rushed, in her usual\nway, into the subject. “Papa! if you please, I should like to go home\nto-morrow with you.”\n\n“Eh?” said the doctor, amazed. “How is this? I told you that Miss Bracy\nand Mary are doing famously.”\n\n“Yes, but I had rather go back.”\n\n“Indeed!” and Dr. May looked at the door, and spoke low. “They make you\nwelcome, I hope--”\n\n“Oh, yes! nothing can be kinder.”\n\n“I am glad to hear it. This Rivers is such a lout, that I could not tell\nhow it might be. I did not look to see you turn homesick all at once.”\n\nEthel smiled. “Yes, I have been very happy; but please, papa, ask no\nquestions--only take me home.”\n\n“Come! it is all a homesick fit, Ethel--never fear the ball. Think of\nthe concert. If it were not for that poor baby of Mrs. Larkins, I should\nstay myself to hear Sonntag again. You won’t have such another chance.”\n\n“I know, but I think I ought to go--”\n\nGeorge came in, and they could say no more. Both were silent on the\nsubject at breakfast, but when afterwards Flora seized on Ethel, to\narray her for the theatre, she was able to say, “Flora, please don’t be\nangry with me--you have been very kind to me, but I mean to go home with\npapa to-morrow.”\n\n“I declare!” said Flora composedly, “you are as bad as the children\nat the infant school, crying to go home the instant they see their\nmothers!”\n\n“No, Flora, but I must go. Thank you for all this pleasure, but I shall\nhave heard Norman’s poem, and then I must go.”\n\nFlora turned her round, looked in her face kindly, kissed her, and said,\n“My dear, never mind, it will all come right again--only, don’t run\naway.”\n\n“What will come right?”\n\n“Any little misunderstanding with Norman Ogilvie.”\n\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Ethel, becoming scarlet.\n\n“My dear, you need not try to hide it. I see that you have got into a\nfright. You have made a discovery, but that is no reason for running\naway.”\n\n“Yes it is!” said Ethel firmly, not denying the charge, though reddening\nmore than ever at finding her impression confirmed.\n\n“Poor child! she is afraid!” said Flora tenderly; “but I will take care\nof you, Ethel. It is everything delightful. You are the very girl for\nsuch a heros de Roman, and it has embellished you more than all my Paris\nfineries.”\n\n“Hush, Flora! We ought not to talk in this way, as if--”\n\n“As if he had done more than walk with, and talk with, nobody else! How\nhe did hate papa last night. I had a great mind to call papa off, in\npity to him.”\n\n“Don’t, Flora. If there were anything in it, it would not be proper to\nthink of it, so I am going home to prevent it.” The words were spoken\nwith averted face and heaving breath.\n\n“Proper?” said Flora. “The Mays are a good old family, and our own\ngrandmother was an honourable Ogilvie herself. A Scottish baron, very\npoor too, has no right to look down--”\n\n“They shall not look down. Flora, it is of no use to talk. I cannot be\nspared from home, and I will not put myself in the way of being tempted\nto forsake them all.”\n\n“Tempted!” said Flora, laughing. “Is it such a wicked thing?”\n\n“Not in others, but it would be wrong in me, with such a state of things\nas there is at home.”\n\n“I do not suppose he would want you for some years to come. He is only\ntwo-and-twenty. Mary will grow older.”\n\n“Margaret will either be married, or want constant care. Flora, I will\nnot let myself be drawn from them.”\n\n“You may think so now; but it would be for their real good to relieve\npapa of any of us. If we were all to think as you do, how should we\nlive? I don’t know--for papa told me there will be barely ten thousand\npounds, besides the houses, and what will that be among ten? I am not\ntalking of yourself, but think of the others!”\n\n“I know papa will not be happy without me, and I will not leave him,”\n repeated Ethel, not answering the argument.\n\nFlora changed her ground, and laughed. “We are getting into the\nheroics,” she said, “when it would be very foolish to break up our\nplans, only because we have found a pleasant cousin. There is nothing\nserious in it, I dare say. How silly of us to argue on such an idea!”\n\nMeta came in before Flora could say more, but Ethel, with burning\ncheeks, repeated, “It will be safer!”\n\nEthel had, meantime, been dressed by her sister; and, as Bellairs came\nto adorn Meta, and she could have no solitude, she went downstairs,\nthinking she heard Norman’s step, and hoping to judge of his mood.\n\nShe entered the room with an exclamation, “Oh, Norman!”\n\n“At your service!” said the wrong Norman, looking merrily up from behind\na newspaper.\n\n“Oh, I beg your pardon; I thought--”\n\n“Your thoughts were quite right,” he said, smiling. “Your brother\ndesires me to present his respects to his honoured family, and to inform\nthem that his stock of assurance is likely to be diminished by the\npleasure of their company this morning.”\n\n“How is he?” asked Ethel anxiously.\n\n“Pretty fair. He has blue saucers round his eyes, as he had before he\nwent up for his little go.”\n\n“Oh, I know them,” said Ethel.\n\n“Very odd,” continued her cousin; “when the end always is, that he says\nhe has the luck of being set on in the very place he knows best. But I\nthink it has expended itself in a sleepless night, and I have no fears,\nwhen he comes to the point.”\n\n“What is he doing?”\n\n“Writing to his brother Harry. He said it was the day for the Pacific\nmail, and that Harry’s pleasure would be the best of it.”\n\n“Ah!” said Ethel, glancing towards the paper, “is there any naval\nintelligence?”\n\nHe looked; and while she was thinking whether she ought not to depart,\nhe exclaimed, in a tone that startled her, “Ha! No. Is your brother’s\nship the Alcestis?”\n\n“Yes! Oh, what?”\n\n“Nothing then, I assure you. See, it is merely this--she has not come\ninto Sydney so soon as expected, which you knew before. That is all.”\n\n“Let me see,” said the trembling Ethel.\n\nIt was no more than an echo of their unconfessed apprehensions, yet it\nseemed to give them a body; and Ethel’s thoughts flew to Margaret. Her\ngoing home would be absolutely necessary now. Mr. Ogilvie kindly began\nto talk away her alarm, saying that there was still no reason for\ndread, mentioning the many causes that might have delayed the ship, and\nreassuring her greatly.\n\n“But Norman!” she said.\n\n“Ah! true. Poor May! He will break down to a certainty if he hears it. I\nwill go at once, and keep guard over him, lest he should meet with this\npaper. But pray, don’t be alarmed. I assure you there is no cause. You\nwill have letters to-morrow.”\n\nEthel would fain have thrown off her finery and hurried home at once,\nbut no one regarded the matter as she did. Dr. May agreed with Flora\nthat it was no worse than before, and though they now thought Ethel’s\nreturn desirable, on Margaret’s account, it would be better not to add\nto the shock by a sudden arrival, especially as they took in no daily\npaper at home. So the theatre was not to be given up, nor any of the\nsubsequent plans, except so far as regarded Ethel; and, this agreed,\nthey started for the scene of action.\n\nThey were hardly in the street before they met the ubiquitous Mr.\nOgilvie, saying that Cheviot, Norman’s prompter, was aware of the\nreport, and was guarding him, while he came to escort the ladies,\nthrough what he expressively called “the bear fight.” Ethel resolutely\nadhered to her father, and her cousin took care of Meta, who had been\nclinging in a tiptoe manner to the point of her brother’s high elbow,\nlooking as if the crowd might easily brush off such a little fly,\nwithout his missing her.\n\nInch by inch, a step at a time, the ladies were landed in a crowd of\ntheir own sex, where Flora bravely pioneered; they emerged on their\nbenches, shook themselves out, and seated themselves. There was the\nswarm of gay ladies around them, and beneath the area, fast being paved\nwith heads, black, brown, gray, and bald, a surging living sea, where\nMeta soon pointed out Dr. May and George; the mere sight of such masses\nof people was curious and interesting, reminding Ethel of Cherry Elwood\nhaving once shocked her by saying the Whit-Monday club was the most\nbeautiful sight in the whole year. And above! that gallery of trampling\nundergraduates, and more than trampling! Ethel and Meta could, at first,\nhave found it in their hearts to be frightened at those thundering\nshouts, but the young ladies were usually of opinions so similar,\nthat the louder grew the cheers, the more they laughed and exulted, so\ncarried along that no cares could be remembered.\n\nMaking a way through the thronged area, behold the procession of\nscarlet doctors, advancing through the midst, till the red and black\nvice-chancellor sat enthroned in the centre, and the scarlet line became\na semicircle, dividing the flower-garden of ladies from the black mass\nbelow.\n\nThen came the introduction of the honorary doctors, one by one, with\nthe Latin speech, which Ethel’s companions unreasonably required her to\ntranslate to them, while she was using all her ears to catch a word or\ntwo, and her eyes to glimpse at the features of men of note.\n\nBy-and-by a youth made his appearance in the rostrum, and a good deal of\nLatin ensued, of which Flora hoped Ethel was less tired than she was.\nIn time, however, Meta saw the spectacles removed, and George looking\nstraight up, and she drew down her veil, and took hold of Flora’s hand,\nand Ethel flushed like a hot coal. Nevertheless, all contrived to see\na tall figure, with face much flushed, and hands moving nervously. The\nworld was tired, and people were departing, so that the first lines were\nlost, perhaps a satisfaction to Norman; but his voice soon cleared and\nbecame louder, his eyes lighted, and Ethel knew the “funny state” had\ncome to his relief--people’s attention was arrested--there was no more\ngoing away.\n\nIt was well that Norman was ignorant of the fears for Harry, for\nfour lines had been added since Ethel had seen the poem, saying how\nself-sacrifice sent forth the sailor-boy from home, to the lone watch,\nthe wave and storm, his spirit rising high, ere manhood braced his form.\n\nApplause did not come where Ethel had expected it, and, at first,\nthere was silence at the close, but suddenly the acclamations rose with\ndeafening loudness, though hardly what greets some poems with more to\ncatch the popular ear.\n\nEthel’s great excitement was over, and presently she found herself\noutside of the theatre, a shower falling, and an umbrella held over\nher by Mr. Ogilvie, who was asking her if it was not admirable, and\ndeclaring the poem might rank with Heber’s ‘Palestine’, or Milman’s\n‘Apollo’.\n\nThey were bound for a great luncheon at one of the colleges, where Ethel\nmight survey the Principal with whom Miss Rich had corresponded.\nMr. Ogilvie sat next to her, told her all the names, and quizzed the\ndignitaries, but she had a sense of depression, and did not wish to\nenter into the usual strain of banter. He dropped his lively tone,\nand drew her out about Harry, till she was telling eagerly of her dear\nsailor brother, and found him so sympathising and considerate, that she\ndid not like him less; though she felt her intercourse with him a sort\nof intoxication, that would only make it the worse for her by-and-by.\n\nDuring that whole luncheon, and their walk through the gardens, where\nthere was a beautiful horticultural show, something was always prompting\nher to say, while in this quasi-privacy, that she was on the eve of\ndeparture, but she kept her resolution against it--she thought it would\nhave been an unwarrantable experiment. When they returned to their inn\nthey found Norman looking fagged, but relieved, half asleep on the sofa,\nwith a novel in his hand. He roused himself as they came in, and, to\navoid any compliments on his own performance, began, “Well, Ethel, are\nyou ready for the ball?”\n\n“We shall spare her the ball,” said Dr. May; “there is a report about\nthe Alcestis in the newspaper that may make Margaret uncomfortable, and\nthis good sister will not stay away from her.”\n\nNorman started up crying, “What, papa?”\n\n“It is a mere nothing in reality,” said Dr. May, “only what we knew\nbefore;” and he showed his son the paragraph, which Norman read as a\ndeath warrant; the colour ebbed from his lips and cheeks; he trembled so\nthat he was obliged to sit down, and, without speaking, he kept his eyes\nfixed on the words, “Serious apprehensions are entertained with regard\nto H. M. S. Alcestis, Captain Gordon--”\n\n“If you had seen as many newspaper reports come to nothing, as I have,\nyou would not take this so much to heart,” said Dr. May. “I expect to\nhear that this very mail has brought letters.”\n\nAnd Meta added that, at luncheon, she had been seated next to one of the\nhonorary doctors--a naval captain--who had been making discoveries in\nthe South Sea, and that he had scouted the notion of harm befalling\nthe Alcestis, and given all manner of reassuring suppositions as to her\ndetention, adding besides, that no one believed the Australian paper\nwhence the report was taken. He had seen the Alcestis, knew Captain\nGordon, and spoke of him as one of the safest people in the world. Had\nhis acquaintance extended to lieutenants and midshipmen, it would have\nbeen perfect; as it was, the tidings brought back the blood to Norman’s\ncheek, and the light to his eye.\n\n“When do we set off?” was Norman’s question.\n\n“At five,” said Ethel. “You mean it, papa?”\n\n“I did intend it, if I had gone alone, but I shall not take you till\neight; nor you, Norman, at all.”\n\nNorman was bent on returning, but his father and Flora would not hear of\nit. Flora could not spare him, and Dr. May was afraid of the effect of\nanxiety on nerves and spirits so sensitive. While this was going on,\nMr. Ogilvie looked at Ethel in consternation, and said, “Are you really\ngoing home?”\n\n“Yes, my eldest sister must not be left alone when she hears this.”\n\nHe looked down--Ethel had the resolution to walk away. Flora could not\ngive up the ball, and Meta found that she must go; but both the Normans\nspent a quiet evening with Dr. May and Ethel. Norman May had a bad\nheadache, which he was allowed to have justly earned; Dr. May was very\nhappy reviving all his Scottish recollections, and talking to young\nOgilvie about Edinburgh. Once, there was a private consultation. Ethel\nwas provoked and ashamed at the throbs that it would excite. What! on a\nweek’s acquaintance?\n\nWhen alone with her father, she began to nerve herself for something\nheroic, and great was her shame when she heard only of her cousin’s kind\nconsideration for her brother, whom he wished to take home with him, and\nthence to see the Highlands, so as to divert his anxiety for Harry, as\nwell as to call him off from the studies with which he had this term\noverworked himself even more than usual. Dr. May had given most grateful\nconsent, and he spoke highly in praise of the youth; but there was no\nmore to come, and Ethel could have beaten herself for the moment of\nanticipation.\n\nMeta came home, apologising for wakening Ethel; but Ethel had not been\nasleep. The ball had not, it seemed, been as charming to her as most\nevents were, and Ethel heard a sigh as the little lady lay down in her\nbed.\n\nLate as it was when she went to rest, Meta rose to see the travellers\noff; she sent hosts of messages to her father, and wished she might go\nwith them. George and Flora were not visible, and Dr. May was leaving\nmessages for them, and for Norman, in her charge, when the two Balliol\nmen walked in.\n\nEthel had hoped it was over, yet she could not be sorry that the two\nyouths escorted them to the station, and, as Ethel was placed in\nthe carriage, she believed that she heard something of never\nforgetting--happiest week--but in the civilities which the other\noccupant of the carriage was offering for the accommodation of their\nlesser luggage, she lost the exact words, and the last she heard were,\n“Good-bye; I hope you will find letters at home.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\n\n     True to the kindred points of Heaven and home.\n                                             WORDSWORTH.\n\n\nEtheldred’s dream was over. She had wakened to the inside of a\nGreat Western carriage, her father beside her, and opposite a thin,\nforeign-looking gentleman. Her father, to whom her life was to be\ndevoted! She looked at his profile, defined against the window, and did\nnot repent. In a sort of impulse to do something for him, she took his\nhat from his hand, and was going to dispose of it in the roof, when he\nturned, smiling his thanks, but saying, “it was not worth while--this\ncarriage was a very transitory resting-place.”\n\nThe stranger at that moment sprang to his feet, exclaiming, “Dick\nhimself!”\n\n“Spencer, old fellow, is it you?” cried Dr. May, in a voice of equal\namazement and joy, holding out his hand, which was grasped and wrung\nwith a force that made Ethel shrink for the poor maimed arm.\n\n“Ha! what is amiss with your arm?” was the immediate question. Three\ntechnical words were spoken in a matter-of-fact way, as Dr. May replaced\nhis hand in his bosom, and then, with an eager smile, said, “Ethel,\nhere! You have heard of him!”\n\nEthel had indeed, and gave her hand cordially, surprised by the bow and\nair of deferential politeness with which it was received, like a favour,\nwhile Dr. Spencer asked her whether she had been staying in Oxford.\n\n“Ay; and what for, do you think?” said Dr. May joyously.\n\n“You don’t say that was your son who held forth yesterday! I thought his\nvoice had a trick of yours--but then I thought you would have held by\nold Cambridge.”\n\n“What could I do?” said Dr. May deprecatingly; “the boy would go and get\na Balliol scholarship--”\n\n“Why! the lad is a genius! a poet--no mistake about it! but I scarcely\nthought you could have one of such an age.”\n\n“Of his age! His brother is in Holy Orders--one of his sisters is\nmarried. There’s for you, Spencer!”\n\n“Bless me, Dick! I thought myself a young man!”\n\n“What! with hair of that colour?” said Dr. May, looking at his friend’s\nmilk-white locks.\n\n“Bleached by that frightful sickly season at Poonshedagore, when I\nthought I was done for. But you! you--the boy of the whole lot! You\nthink me very disrespectful to your father,” added he, turning to Ethel,\n“but you see what old times are.”\n\n“I know,” said Ethel, with a bright look.\n\n“So you were in the theatre yesterday,” continued Dr. May; “but there is\nno seeing any one in such a throng. How long have you been in England?”\n\n“A fortnight. I went at once to see my sister, at Malvern; there I fell\nin with Rudden, the man I was with in New Guinea. He was going up to be\nmade an honorary doctor, and made me come with him.”\n\n“And where are you bound for?” as the train showed signs of a halt.\n\n“For London. I meant to hunt up Mat. Fleet, and hear of you, and other\nold friends.”\n\n“Does he expect you?”\n\n“No one expects me. I am a regular vagabond.”\n\n“Come home with us,” said Dr. May, laying his hand on his arm. “I cannot\npart with you so soon. Come, find your luggage. Take your ticket for\nGloucester.”\n\n“So suddenly! Will it not be inconvenient?” said he, looking tempted,\nbut irresolute.\n\n“Oh, no, no; pray come!” said Ethel eagerly. “We shall be so glad.”\n\nHe looked his courteous thanks, and soon was with them en-route for\nStoneborough.\n\nEthel’s thoughts were diverted from all she had left at Oxford. She\ncould not but watch those two old friends. She knew enough of the\ntraveller to enter into her father’s happiness, and to have no fears is\nof another Sir Matthew.\n\nThey had been together at Stoneborough, at Cambridge, at Paris, at\nEdinburgh, always linked in the closest friendship; but, by Dr. May’s\nown account, his friend had been the diligent one of the pair, a bright\ncompound of principle and spirit, and highly distinguished in all his\nstudies, and Dr. May’s model of perfection. Their paths had since lain\nfar apart, and they had not seen each other since, twenty-six years ago,\nthey had parted in London--the one to settle at his native town, while\nthe other accepted a situation as travelling physician. On his return,\nhe had almost sacrificed his life, by self-devoted attendance on a\nfever-stricken emigrant-ship. He had afterwards received an appointment\nin India, and there the correspondence had died away, and Dr. May had\nlost traces of him, only knowing that, in a visitation of cholera, he\nhad again acted with the same carelessness of his own life, and a\nsevere illness, which had broken up his health, had occasioned him to\nrelinquish his post.\n\nIt now appeared that he had thought himself coming home ever since.\nHe had gone to recruit in the Himalayas, and had become engrossed in\nscientific observations on their altitudes, as well as investigations in\nnatural history. Going to Calcutta, he had fallen in with a party about\nto explore the Asiatic islands and he had accompanied them, as well\nas going on an expedition into the interior of Australia. He had been\nemployed in various sanitary arrangements there and in India, and\nhad finally worked his way slowly home, overland, visiting Egypt and\nPalestine, and refreshing his memory with every Italian, German, or\nFrench Cathedral, or work of art, that had delighted him in early days.\n\nHe was a slight small man, much sunburned, nearly bald, and his hair\nsnowy, but his eyes were beautiful, very dark, soft, and smiling,\nand yet their gaze peculiarly keen and steady, as if ready for any\nemergency, and his whole frame was full of alertness and vigour. His\nvoice was clear and sweet, and his manner most refined and polished,\nindeed, his courtesy to Ethel, whenever there was a change of carriage,\nwas so exemplary, that she understood it as the effect on a chivalrous\nmind, of living where a lady was a rare and precious article. It\nfrightened Ethel a little at first, but, before the end of the journey,\nshe had already begun to feel towards him like an old friend--one of\nthose inheritances who are so much valued and loved, like a sort of\nuncles-in-friendship. She had an especial grateful honour for the\ndelicate tact which asked no questions, as she saw his eye often falling\nanxiously on her father’s left hand, where the wedding ring shone upon\nthe little finger.\n\nThere was talk enough upon his travels, on public changes, and on\nold friends; but, after those first few words, home had never been\nmentioned.\n\nWhen, at five o’clock, the engine blew its whistle, at the old familiar\nstation, Dr. May had scarcely put his head out before Adams hastened up\nto him with a note.\n\n“All well at home?”\n\n“Yes, sir, Miss Margaret sent up the gig.”\n\n“I must go at once,” said Dr May hastily--“the Larkins’ child is worse.\nEthel, take care of him, and introduce him. Love to Margaret. I’ll be at\nhome before tea.”\n\nHe was driven off at speed, and Ethel proposed to walk home. Dr Spencer\ngave her his arm, and was silent, but presently said, in a low, anxious\nvoice, “My dear, you must forgive me, I have heard nothing for many\nyears. Your mother--”\n\n“It was an accident,” said Ethel looking straight before her. “It was\nwhen papa’s arm was hurt. The carriage was over-turned.”\n\n“And--” repeated Dr Spencer earnestly\n\n“She was killed on the spot,” said Ethel, speaking shortly, and\nabruptly. If she was to say it at all, she could not do so otherwise.\n\nHe was dreadfully shocked--she knew it by the shudder of his arm, and a\ntight suppressed groan. He did not speak, and Ethel, as if a relief from\nthe silence must be made, said what was not very consoling, and equally\nblunt. “Margaret had some harm done to her spine--she cannot walk.”\n\nHe did not seem to hear, but walked on, as in a dream, where Ethel\nguided him, and she would not interrupt him again.\n\nThey had just passed Mr Bramshaw’s office, when a voice was heard\nbehind, calling, “Miss Ethel! Miss Ethel!” and Edward Anderson, now\narticled to Mr. Bramshaw, burst out, pen in hand, and looking shabby and\ninky.\n\n“Miss Ethel!” he said breathlessly, “I beg your pardon, but have you\nheard from Harry?”\n\n“No!” said Ethel. “Have they had that paper at home?”\n\n“Not that I know of,” said Edward. “My mother wanted to send it, but I\nwould not take it--not while Dr. May was away.”\n\n“Thank you--that was very kind of you.”\n\n“And oh! Miss Ethel, do you think it is true?”\n\n“We hope not,” said Ethel kindly--“we saw a Captain at Oxford who\nthought it not at all to be depended on.”\n\n“I am so glad,” said Edward; and, shaking hands, he went back to his\nhigh stool, Ethel feeling that he deserved the pains that Norman\nhad taken to spare and befriend him. She spoke to her companion in\nexplanation. “We are very anxious for news of my next brother’s ship,\nAlcestis, in the Pacific--”\n\n“More!” exclaimed poor Dr. Spencer, almost overpowered; “Good Heavens! I\nthought May, at least, was happy!”\n\n“He is not unhappy,” said Ethel, not sorry that they had arrived at the\nback entrance of the shrubbery.\n\n“How long ago was this?” said he, standing still, as soon as they had\npassed into the garden.\n\n“Four years, next October. I assure you, his spirits are almost always\ngood.”\n\n“When I was at Adelaide, little thinking!” he sighed, then recollecting\nhimself. “Forgive me, I have given you pain.”\n\n“No,” she said, “or rather, I gave you more.”\n\n“I knew her--” and there he broke off, paused for a minute, then\ncollecting himself, seemed resolutely to turn away from the subject, and\nsaid, walking on, “This garden is not much altered.”\n\nAt that moment, a little shrill voice broke out in remonstrance among\nthe laurels--“But you know, Daisy, you are the captain of the forty\nthieves!”\n\n“A startling announcement!” said Dr. Spencer, looking at Ethel, and the\nnext two steps brought them in view of the play-place in the laurels,\nwhere Aubrey lay on the ground, feigning sleep, but keeping a watchful\neye over Blanche, who was dropping something into the holes of inverted\nflower-pots, Gertrude dancing about in a way that seemed to have called\nfor the reproof of the more earnest actors.\n\n“Ethel! Ethel!” screamed the children, with one voice, and, while the\ntwo girls stood in shyness at her companion, Aubrey had made a dart at\nher neck, and hung upon her, arms, legs, body, and all, like a wild cat.\n\n“That will do! that will do, old man--let go! Speak to Dr. Spencer, my\ndear.”\n\nBlanche did so demurely, and asked where was papa?\n\n“Coming, as soon as he has been to Mrs. Larkins’s poor baby.”\n\n“George Larkins has been here,” said Aubrey. “And I have finished\n‘Vipera et lima’, Ethel, but Margaret makes such false quantities!”\n\n“What is your name, youngster?” said Dr. Spencer, laying his hand on\nAubrey’s head.\n\n“Aubrey Spencer May,” was the answer.\n\n“Hey day! where did you steal my name?” exclaimed Dr. Spencer, while\nAubrey stood abashed at so mysterious an accusation.\n\n“Oh!” exclaimed Blanche, seizing on Ethel, and whispering, “is it really\nthe boy that climbed the market cross?”\n\n“You see your fame lives here,” said Ethel, smiling, as Dr. Spencer\nevidently heard.\n\n“He was a little boy!” said Aubrey indignantly, looking at the\ngray-haired man.\n\n“There!” said Ethel to Dr. Spencer.\n\n“The tables turned!” he said, laughing heartily. “But do not let me keep\nyou. You would wish to prepare your sister for a stranger, and I shall\nimprove my acquaintance here. Where are the forty thieves?”\n\n“I am all of them,” said the innocent, daisy-faced Gertrude; and Ethel\nhastened towards the house, glad of the permission granted by his true\ngood-breeding.\n\nThere was a shriek of welcome from Mary, who sat working beside\nMargaret. Ethel was certain that no evil tidings had come to her eldest\nsister, so joyous was her exclamation of wonder and rebuke to her\nhome-sick Ethel. “Naughty girl! running home at once! I did think you\nwould have been happy there!”\n\n“So I was,” said Ethel hastily; “but who do you think I have brought\nhome?” Margaret flushed with such a pink, that Ethel resolved never to\nset her guessing again, and hurried to explain; and having heard that\nall was well, and taken her housekeeping measures, she proceeded to\nfetch the guest; but Mary, who had been unusually silent all this time,\nran after her, and checked her.\n\n“Ethel, have you heard?” she said.\n\n“Have you?” said Ethel.\n\n“George Larkins rode in this morning to see when papa would come home,\nand he told me. He said I had better not tell Margaret, for he did not\nbelieve it.”\n\n“And you have not! That is very good of you, Mary.”\n\n“Oh! I am glad you are come! I could not have helped telling, if you had\nbeen away a whole week! But, Ethel, does papa believe it?” Poor Mary’s\nfull lip swelled, and her eyes swam, ready to laugh or weep, in full\nfaith in her sister’s answer.\n\nEthel told of Meta’s captain, and the smile predominated, and settled\ndown into Mary’s usual broad beamy look, like a benignant rising sun\non the sign of an inn, as Ethel praised her warmly for a fortitude and\nconsideration of which she had not thought her capable.\n\nDr. Spencer was discovered full in the midst of the comedy of the forty\nthieves, alternating, as required, between the robber-captain and the\nass, and the children in perfect ecstasies with him.\n\nThey all followed in his train to the drawing-room, and were so\nclamorous, that he could have no conversation with Margaret. He\ncertainly made them so, but Ethel, remembering what a blow her\ndisclosures had been, thought it would be only a kindness to send Aubrey\nto show him to his room, where he might have some peace.\n\nShe was not sorry to be very busy, so as to have little time to reply\nto the questions on the doings at Oxford, and the cause of her sudden\nreturn; and yet it would have been a comfort to be able to sit down\nto understand herself, and recall her confused thoughts. But solitary\nreflection was a thing only to be hoped for in that house in bed, and\nEthel was obliged to run up and down, and attend to everybody, under\nan undefined sense that she had come home to a dull, anxious world of\nturmoil.\n\nMargaret seemed to guess nothing, that was one comfort; she evidently\nthought that her return was fully accounted for by the fascination of\nher papa’s presence in a strange place. She gave Ethel no credit for\nthe sacrifice, naturally supposing that she could not enjoy herself\naway from home. Ethel did not know whether to be glad or not; she was\nrelieved, but it was flat. As to Norman Ogilvie, one or two inquiries\nwhether she liked him, and if Norman were going to Scotland with him,\nwere all that passed, and it was very provoking to be made so hot and\nconscious by them.\n\nShe could not begin to dress till late, and while she was unpacking, she\nheard her father come home, among the children’s loud welcomes, and\ngo to the drawing-room. He presently knocked at the door between their\nrooms.\n\n“So Margaret does not know?” he said.\n\n“No, Mary has been so very good;” and she told what had passed.\n\n“Well done, Mary, I must tell her so. She is a good girl on a pinch, you\nsee!”\n\n“And we don’t speak of it now? Or will it hurt Margaret more to think we\nkeep things from her?”\n\n“That is the worst risk of the two. I have seen great harm done in that\nway. Mention it, but without seeming to make too much of it.”\n\n“Won’t you, papa?”\n\n“You had better--it will seem of less importance. I think nothing of it\nmyself.”\n\nNevertheless, Ethel saw that he could not trust himself to broach the\nsubject to Margaret.\n\n“How was the Larkins’ baby?”\n\n“Doing better. What have you done with Spencer?”\n\n“I put him into Richard’s room. The children were eating him up! He is\nso kind to them.”\n\n“Ay! I say, Ethel, that was a happy consequence of your coming home with\nme.”\n\n“What a delightful person he is!”\n\n“Is he not? A true knight errant, as he always was! I could not tell you\nwhat I owed to him as a boy--all my life, I may say. Ethel,” he added\nsuddenly: “we must do our best to make him happy here. I know it now--I\nnever guessed it then, but one is very hard and selfish when one is\nhappy--”\n\n“What do you mean, papa?”\n\n“I see it now,” continued Dr. May incoherently; “the cause of his\nwandering life--advantages thrown aside. He! the most worthy. Things\nI little heeded at the time have come back on me! I understand why he\nbanished himself!”\n\n“Why?” asked Ethel bewildered.\n\n“She never had an idea of it; but I might have guessed from what fell\nfrom him unconsciously, for not a word would he have said--nor did he\nsay, to show how he sacrificed himself!”\n\n“Who was it? Aunt Flora?” said Ethel, beginning to collect his meaning.\n\n“No, Ethel, it was your own dear mother! You will think this another\nromantic fancy of mine, but I am sure of it.”\n\n“So am I,” said Ethel.\n\n“How--what? Ah! I remembered after we parted that he might know\nnothing--”\n\n“He asked me,” said Ethel.\n\n“And how did he bear it?”\n\nEthel told, and the tears filled her father’s eyes.\n\n“It was wrong and cruel in me to bring him home unprepared! and then to\nleave it to you. I always forget other people’s feelings. Poor Spencer!\nAnd now, Ethel, you see what manner of man we have here, and how we\nought to treat him.”\n\n“Indeed I do!”\n\n“The most unselfish--the most self-sacrificing--” continued Dr. May.\n“And to see what it all turned on! I happened to have this place open to\nme--the very cause, perhaps, of my having taken things easy--and so the\nold Professor threw opportunities in my way; while Aubrey Spencer, with\nevery recommendation that man could have, was set aside, and exiled\nhimself, leaving the station, and all he might so easily have gained.\nAh, Ethel, Sir Matthew Fleet never came near him in ability. But not one\nword to interfere with me would he say, and--how I have longed to meet\nhim again, after parting in my selfish, unfeeling gladness; and now I\nhave nothing to do for him, but show him how little I was to be trusted\nwith her.”\n\nEthel never knew how to deal with these occasional bursts of grief, but\nshe said that she thought Dr. Spencer was very much pleased to have met\nwith him, and delighted with the children.\n\n“Ah! well, you are her children,” said Dr. May, with his hand on Ethel’s\nshoulder.\n\nSo they went downstairs, and found Mary making tea; and Margaret,\nfearing Dr. Spencer was overwhelmed with his young admirers--for Aubrey\nand Gertrude were one on each knee, and Blanche standing beside him,\ninflicting on him a catalogue of the names and ages of all the eleven.\n\n“Ethel has introduced you, I see,” said Dr. May.\n\n“Ay, I assure you, it was an alarming introduction. No sooner do I enter\nyour garden, than I hear that I am in the midst of the Forty Thieves.\nI find a young lady putting the world to death, after the fashion of\nHamlet--and, looking about to find what I have lost, I find this urchin\nhas robbed me of my name--a property I supposed was always left to\nunfortunate travellers, however small they might be chopped themselves.”\n\n“Well, Aubrey boy, will you make restitution?”\n\n“It is my name,” said Aubrey positively; for, as his father added, “He\nis not without dread of the threat being fulfilled, and himself left to\nbe that Anon who, Blanche says, writes so much poetry.”\n\nAubrey privately went to Ethel, to ask her if this were possible; and\nshe had to reassure him, by telling him that they were “only in fun.”\n\nIt was fun with a much deeper current though; for Dr. Spencer was\nsaying, with a smile, between gratification and sadness, “I did not\nthink my name would have been remembered here so long.”\n\n“We had used up mine, and the grandfathers’, and the uncles’, and began\nto think we might look a little further a-field,” said Dr. May. “If I\nhad only known where you were, I would have asked you to be the varlet’s\ngodfather; but I was much afraid you were nowhere in the land of the\nliving.”\n\n“I have but one godson, and he is coffee-coloured! I ought to have\nwritten; but, you see, for seven years I thought I was coming home.”\n\nAubrey had recovered sufficiently to observe to Blanche, “That was\nalmost as bad as Ulysses,” which, being overheard and repeated, led to\nthe information that he was Ethel’s pupil, whereupon Dr. Spencer began\nto inquire after the school, and to exclaim at his friend for having\ndeserted it in the person of Tom. Dr. May looked convicted, but said it\nwas all Norman’s fault; and Dr. Spencer, shaking his head at Blanche,\nopined that the young gentleman was a great innovater, and that he was\nsure he was at the bottom of the pulling down the Market Cross, and the\nstopping up Randall’s Alley--iniquities of the “nasty people,” of which\nshe already had made him aware.\n\n“Poor Norman, he suffered enough anent Randall’s Alley,” said Dr. May;\n“but as to the Market Cross, that came down a year before he was born.”\n\n“It was the Town Council!” said Ethel.\n\n“One of the ordinary stultifications of Town Councils?”\n\n“Take care, Spencer,” said Dr. May. “I am a Town Council man my-self--”\n\n“You, Dick!” and he turned with a start of astonishment, and went into\na fit of laughing, re-echoed by all the young ones, who were especially\ntickled by hearing, from another, the abbreviation that had, hitherto,\nonly lived in the favourite expletive, “As sure as my name is Dick May.”\n\n“Of course,” said Dr. May. “‘Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou\nnot suspect my years? One that hath two gowns, and everything handsome\nabout him!’”\n\nHis friend laughed the more, and they betook themselves to the College\nstories, of which the quotation from Dogberry seemed to have reminded\nthem.\n\nThere was something curious and affecting in their manner to each other.\nOften it was the easy bantering familiarity of the two youths they had\nonce been together, with somewhat of elder brotherhood on Dr. Spencer’s\nside--and of looking up on Dr. May’s--and just as they had recurred to\nthese terms, some allusion would bring back to Dr. Spencer, that the\nheedless, high-spirited “Dick,” whom he had always had much ado to keep\nout of scrapes, was a householder, a man of weight and influence; a\nlight which would at first strike him as most ludicrous, and then mirth\nwould end in a sigh, for there was yet another aspect! After having\nthought of him so long as the happy husband of Margaret Mackenzie, he\nfound her place vacant, and the trace of deep grief apparent on the\ncountenance, once so gay--the oppression of anxiety marked on the brow,\nformerly so joyous, the merriment almost more touching than gravity\nwould have been, for the former nature seemed rather shattered than\naltered. In merging towards this side, there was a tender respect in\nDr. Spencer’s manner that was most beautiful, though this evening such\nsubjects were scrupulously kept at the utmost distance, by the constant\ninterchange of new and old jokes and stories.\n\nOnly when bed-time had come, and Margaret had been carried off--did a\nsilence fall on the two friends, unbroken till Dr. May rose and proposed\ngoing upstairs. When he gave his hand to wish good-night, Dr. Spencer\nheld it this time most carefully, and said, “Oh, May! I did not expect\nthis!”\n\n“I should have prepared you,” said his host, “but I never recollected\nthat you knew nothing--”\n\n“I had dwelt on your happiness!”\n\n“There never were two happier creatures for twenty-two years,” said Dr.\nMay, his voice low with emotion. “Sorrow spared her! Yes, think of her\nalways in undimmed brightness--always smiling as you remember her. She\nwas happy. She is,” he concluded. His friend had turned aside and hidden\nhis face with his hands, then looked up for a moment, “And you, Dick,”\n he said briefly.\n\n“Sorrow spared her,” was Dr. May’s first answer. “And hers are very good\nchildren!”\n\nThere was a silence again, ending in Dr. May’s saying, “What do you\nthink of my poor girl?”\n\nThey discussed the nature of the injury: Dr. Spencer could not feel\notherwise than that it was a very hopeless matter. Her father owned\nthat he had thought so from the first, and had wondered at Sir Matthew\nFleet’s opinion. His subdued tone of patience and resignation, struck\nhis guest above all, as changed from what he had once been.\n\n“You have been sorely tried,” he said, when they parted at his room\ndoor.\n\n“I have received much good!” simply answered Dr. May. “Goodnight! I am\nglad to have you here--if you can bear it.”\n\n“Bear it? Dick! how like that girl is to you! She is yourself!”\n\n“Such a self as I never was! Good-night.”\n\nEthel overcame the difficulty of giving the account of the newspaper\nalarm with tolerable success, by putting the story of Meta’s\nconversation foremost. Margaret did not take it to heart as much as she\nhad feared, nor did she appear to dwell on it afterwards. The truth was\nperhaps that Dr. Spencer’s visit was to every one more of an excitement\nand amusement than it was to Ethel. Not that she did not like him\nextremely, but after such a week as she had been spending, the\nhome-world seemed rather stale and unprofitable.\n\nMiss Bracy relapsed into a state of “feelings,” imagining that Ethel had\ndistrusted her capabilities, and therefore returned; or as Ethel herself\nsometimes feared, there might be irritability in her own manner that\ngave cause of annoyance. The children were inclined to be riotous with\ntheir new friend, who made much of them continually, and especially\npatronised Aubrey; Mary was proud of showing how much she had learned\nto do for Margaret in her sister’s absence; Dr. May was so much taken up\nwith his friend, that Ethel saw less of him than usual, and she began to\nbelieve that it had been all a mistake that every one was so dependent\non her, for, in fact, they did much better without her.\n\nMeantime, she heard of the gaieties which the others were enjoying, and\nshe could not feel heroic when they regretted her. At the end of a week,\nMeta Rivers was escorted home from Warwick by two servants, and came\nto Stoneborough, giving a lively description of all the concluding\npleasures, but declaring that Ethel’s departure had taken away the zest\nof the whole, and Mr. Ogilvie had been very disconsolate. Margaret\nhad not been prepared to hear that Mr. Ogilvie had been so constant a\ncompanion, and was struck by finding that Ethel had passed over one\nwho had evidently been so great an ingredient in the delights of the\nexpedition. Meta had, however observed nothing--she was a great deal too\nsimple and too much engrossed for such notions to have crossed her mind;\nbut Margaret inferred something, and hoped to learn more when she should\nsee Flora. This would not be immediately. George and his wife were gone\nto London, and thence intended to pay a round of visits; and Norman had\naccompanied his namesake to Glenbracken.\n\nEthel fought hard with her own petulance and sense of tedium at home,\nwhich was, as she felt, particularly uncalled for at present; when Dr.\nSpencer was enlivening them so much. He was never in the way, he was\nalways either busy in the dining-room in the morning with books and\npapers, or wandering about his old school-boy haunts in the town, or\ntaking Adam’s place, and driving out Dr. May, or sometimes joining the\nchildren in a walk, to their supreme delight. His sketches, for he\ndrew most beautifully, were an endless pleasure to Margaret, with his\nexplanations of them--she even tried to sit up to copy them, and he\nbegan to teach Blanche to draw. The evenings, when there was certain to\nbe some entertaining talk going on between the two doctors, were very\ncharming, and Margaret seemed quite revived by seeing her father so\nhappy with his friend. Ethel knew she ought to be happy also, and if\nattention could make her so, she had it, for kind and courteous as Dr.\nSpencer was to all, she seemed to have a double charm for him. It was\nas if he found united in her the quaint brusquerie, that he had loved\nin her father, with somewhat of her mother; for though Ethel had less\npersonal resemblance to Mrs. May than any other of the family, Dr.\nSpencer transferred to her much of the chivalrous distant devotion, with\nwhich he had regarded her mother. Ethel was very little conscious of it,\nbut he was certainly her sworn knight, and there was an eagerness in his\nmanner of performing every little service for her, a deference in his\nway of listening to her, over and above his ordinary polish of manner.\n\nEthel lighted up, and enjoyed herself when talking was going\non--her periods of ennui were when she had to set about any home\nemployment--when Aubrey’s lessons did not go well--when she wanted to\nspeak to her father, and could not catch him; and even when she had to\ngo to Cocksmoor.\n\nShe did not seem to make any progress there--the room was very full,\nand very close, the children were dull, and she began to believe she was\ndoing no good--it was all a weariness. But she was so heartily ashamed\nof her feelings, that she worked the more vehemently for them, and the\nutmost show that they outwardly made was, that Margaret thought her less\nvivacious than her wont, and she was a little too peremptory at times\nwith Mary and Blanche. She had so much disliked the display that Flora\nhad made about Cocksmoor, that she had imposed total silence on it\nupon her younger sisters, and Dr. Spencer had spent a fortnight at\nStoneborough without being aware of their occupation; when there\noccurred such an extremely sultry day, that Margaret remonstrated\nwith Ethel on her intention of broiling herself and Mary by walking to\nCocksmoor, when the quicksilver stood at 80° in the shade.\n\nEthel was much inclined to stay at home, but she did not know whether\nthis was from heat or from idleness, and her fretted spirits took the\nturn of determination--so she posted off at a galloping pace, that her\nbrothers called her “Cocksmoor speed,” and Mary panted by her side,\nhumbly petitioning for the plantation path, when she answered “that it\nwas as well to be hot in the sun as in the shade.”\n\nThe school-room was unusually full, all the haymaking mothers made it\nserve as an infant school, and though as much window was opened as there\ncould be, the effect was not coolness. Nevertheless, Ethel sat down and\ngathered her class round her, and she had just heard the chapter once\nread, when there was a little confusion, a frightened cry of “Ethel!”\n and before she could rise to her feet--a flump upon the floor--poor Mary\nhad absolutely fainted dead away.\n\nEthel was much terrified, and very angry with herself; Mary was no light\nweight, but Mrs. Elwood coming at their cry, helped Ethel to drag\nher into the outer room, where she soon began to recover, and to be\nexcessively puzzled as to what had happened to her. She said the sea was\nroaring, and where was Harry? and then she looked much surprised to\nfind herself lying on Mrs. Elwood’s damp flags--a circumstance extremely\ndistressing to Mrs. Elwood, who wanted to carry her upstairs into\nCherry’s room, very clean and very white, but with such a sun shining\nfull into it!\n\nEthel lavished all care, and reproached herself greatly, though to be\nsure nothing had ever been supposed capable of hurting Mary, and Mary\nherself protested that nothing at all had ailed her till the children’s\nvoices began to sound funny, and turned into the waves of the sea, and\ntherewith poor Mary burst into a great flood of tears, and asked whether\nHarry would ever come back. The tears did her a great deal of good,\nthough not so much as the being petted by Ethel, and she soon declared\nherself perfectly well; but Ethel could not think of letting her walk\nhome, and sent off a boy--who she trusted would not faint--with a note\nto Margaret, desiring her to send the gig, which fortunately was at home\nto-day.\n\nMary had partaken of some of Mrs. Elwood’s tea, which, though extremely\nbitter, seemed a great cordial, and was sitting, quite revived, in the\narbour at the door, when the gig stopped, and Dr. Spencer walked in.\n\n“Well, and how are you?”\n\n“Quite well now, thank you. Was Margaret frightened? Why did you come?”\n\n“I thought it would make her happier, as your father was not at home.\nHere, let me feel your pulse. Do you think no one is a doctor but your\npapa? There’s not much the matter with you, however. Where is Ethel?”\n\n“In the school,” and Mary opened the door. Dr. Spencer looked in, as\nEthel came out, and his face put her in mind of Norman’s look.\n\n“No wonder!” was all he said.\n\nEthel was soon satisfied that he did not think Mary ill. In fact, he\nsaid fainting was the most natural and justifiable measure, under the\ncircumstances. “How many human creatures do you keep there?” he asked.\n\n“Forty-seven to-day,” said Mary proudly.\n\n“I shall indict you for cruelty to animals! I think I have known it\nhotter at Poonshedagore, but there we had punkahs!”\n\n“It was very wrong of me,” said Ethel. “I should have thought of poor\nMary, in that sunny walk, but Mary never complains.”\n\n“Oh, never mind,” said Mary, “it did not hurt.”\n\n“I’m not thinking of Mary,” said Dr. Spencer, “but of the wretched\nbeings you are leaving shut up there. I wonder what the mercury would be\nthere.”\n\n“We cannot help it,” said Mary. “We cannot get the ground.”\n\nAnd Mary, having been voted into the seat of honour and comfort by his\nside in the carriage, told her version of Cocksmoor and the Committee;\nwhile Ethel sat up in the little narrow seat behind, severely\nreproaching herself for her want of consideration towards one so good\nand patient as Mary, who proved to have been suffering far more on\nHarry’s account than they had guessed, and who was so simple and\nthorough-going in doing her duty. This was not being a good elder\nsister, and, when they came home, she confessed it, and showed so much\nremorse that poor Mary was quite shocked, and cried so bitterly that it\nwas necessary to quit the subject.\n\n“Ethel, dearest,” said Margaret that night, after they were in bed, “is\nthere anything the matter?”\n\n“No, nothing, but that Oxford has spoiled me,” said Ethel, resolutely.\n“I am very cross and selfish!”\n\n“It will be better by-and-by,” said Margaret, “if only you are sure you\nhave nothing to make you unhappy.”\n\n“Nothing,” said Ethel. She was becoming too much ashamed of her fancy\nto breathe one word about it, and she had spoken the truth. Pleasure had\nspoiled her.\n\n“If only we could do something for Cocksmoor!” she sighed, presently,\n“with that one hundred and fifty pounds lying idle.”\n\nMargaret was very glad that her thoughts were taking this channel, but\nit was not a promising one, for there seemed to be nothing practicable,\npresent or future. The ground could not be had--the pig would not get\nover the stile--the old woman could not get home to-night. Cocksmoor\nmust put up with its present school, and Mary must not be walked to\ndeath.\n\nOr, as Ethel drew her own moral, sacrifice must not be selfish. One\ngreat resolution that has been costly, must not blunt us in the daily\ndetails of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\n\n  If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, Chapels had\n  been Churches, and poor men’s cottages, princes’ palaces.\n                                             MERCHANT OF VENICE.\n\n\n“Dick,” said Dr. Spencer, as the friends sat together in the evening,\nafter Mary’s swoon, “you seem to have found an expedient for making\nhavoc among your daughters.”\n\n“It does not hurt them,” said Dr. May carelessly.\n\n“Pretty well, after the specimen of to-day.”\n\n“That was chance.”\n\n“If you like it, I have no more to say; but I should like to make you\nsit for two hours in such a temperature. If they were mine--”\n\n“Very fine talking, but I would not take the responsibility of hindering\nthe only pains that have ever been taken with that unlucky place. You\ndon’t know that girl Ethel. She began at fifteen, entirely of her own\naccord, and has never faltered. If any of the children there are saved\nfrom perdition, it is owing to her, and I am not going to be the man to\nstop her. They are strong, healthy girls, and I cannot see that it does\nthem any harm--rather good.”\n\n“Have you any special predilection for a room eight feet by nine?”\n\n“Can’t be helped. What would you have said if you had seen the last?”\n\n“What is this about one hundred and fifty pounds in hand?”\n\n“The ladies here chose to have a fancy fair, the only result of which,\nhitherto, has been the taking away my Flora. There is the money, but the\nland can’t be had.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Tied up between the Drydale Estate and ---- College, and in the hands\nof the quarry master, Nicolson. There was an application made to the\nCollege, but they did not begin at the right end.”\n\n“Upon my word, Dick, you take it easy!” cried his friend, rather\nindignantly.\n\n“I own I have not stirred in the matter,” said Dr. May. “I knew nothing\nwould come to good under the pack of silly women that our schools\nare ridden with--” and, as he heard a sound a little like “pish!” he\ncontinued, “and that old Ramsden, it is absolutely useless to work with\nsuch a head--or no head. There’s nothing for it but to wait for better\ntimes, instead of setting up independent, insubordinate action.”\n\n“You are the man to leave venerable abuses undisturbed!”\n\n“The cure is worse than the disease!”\n\n“There spoke the Corporation!”\n\n“Ah! it was not the way you set to work in Poonshedagore.”\n\n“Why, really, when the venerable abuses consisted of Hindoos praying to\ntheir own three-legged stools, and keeping sacred monkeys in honour of\nthe ape Hanyuman, it was a question whether one could be a Christian\noneself, and suffer it undisturbed. It was coming it too strong, when\nI was requested to lend my own step-ladder for the convenience of an\nexhibition of a devotee swinging on hooks in his sides.”\n\nDr. Spencer had, in fact, never rested till he had established a mission\nin his former remote station; and his brown godson, once a Brahmin,\nnow an exemplary clergyman, traced his conversion to the friendship and\nexample of the English physician.\n\n“Well, I have lashed about me at abuses, in my time,” said Dr. May.\n\n“I dare say you have, Dick!” and they both laughed--the inconsiderate\nway was so well delineated.\n\n“Just so,” replied Dr. May; “and I made enemies enough to fetter me now.\nI do not mean that I have done right--I have not; but there is a good\ndeal on my hands, and I don’t write easily. I have been slower to take\nup new matters than I ought to have been.”\n\n“I see, I see!” said Dr. Spencer, rather sorry for his implied reproach,\n“but must Cocksmoor be left to its fate, and your gallant daughter to\nhers?”\n\n“The vicar won’t stir. He is indolent enough by nature, and worse with\ngout; and I do not see what good I could do. I once offended the tenant,\nNicolson, by fining him for cheating his unhappy labourers, on the\nabominable truck system; and he had rather poison me than do anything to\noblige me. And, as to the copyholder, he is a fine gentleman, who never\ncomes near the place, nor does anything for it.”\n\n“Who is he?”\n\n“Sir Henry Walkinghame.”\n\n“Sir Henry Walkinghame! I know the man. I found him in one of the caves\nat Thebes, among the mummies, laid up with a fever, nearly ready to be\na mummy himself! I remember bleeding him--irregular, was not it? but one\ndoes not stand on ceremony in Pharaoh’s tomb. I got him through with\nit; we came up the Nile together, and the last I saw of him was at\nAlexandria. He is your man! something might be done with him!”\n\n“I believe Flora promises to ask him if she should ever meet him in\nLondon, but he is always away. If ever we should be happy enough to get\nan active incumbent, we shall have a chance.”\n\nTwo days after, Ethel came down equipped for Cocksmoor. It was as hot as\never, and Mary was ordered to stay at home, being somewhat pacified by\na promise that she should go again as soon as the weather was fit for\nanything but a salamander.\n\nDr. Spencer was in the hall, with his bamboo, his great Panama hat, and\ngray loose coat, for he entirely avoided, except on Sundays, the medical\nsuit of black. He offered to relieve Ethel of her bag of books.\n\n“No thank you.” (He had them by this time). “But I am going to\nCocksmoor.”\n\n“Will you allow me to be your companion?”\n\n“I shall be very glad of the pleasure of your company, but I am not in\nthe least afraid of going alone,” said she, smiling, however, so as to\nshow she was glad of such pleasant company. “I forewarn you though that\nI have business there.”\n\n“I will find occupation.”\n\n“And you must promise not to turn against me. I have undergone a great\ndeal already about that place. Norman was always preaching against it,\nand now that he has become reasonable, I can’t have papa set against it\nagain--besides, he would mind you more.”\n\nDr. Spencer promised to do nothing but what was quite reasonable. Ethel\nbelieved that he accompanied her merely because his gallantry would not\nsuffer her to go unescorted, and she was not sorry, for it was too long\na walk for solitude to be very agreeable, when strange wagoners might be\non the road, though she had never let them be “lions in the path.”\n\nThe walk was as pleasant as a scorching sun would allow, and by the\ntime they arrived at the scattered cottages, Ethel had been drawn into\nexplaining many of her Cocksmoor perplexities.\n\n“If you could get the land granted, where should you choose to have it?”\n he asked. “You know it will not do to go and say, ‘Be pleased to give me\na piece of land,’ without specifying what, or you might chance to have\none at the Land’s End.”\n\n“I see, that was one of the blunders,” said Ethel. “But I had often\nthought of this nice little square place, between two gardens, and\nsheltered by the old quarry.”\n\n“Ha! hardly space enough, I should say,” replied Dr. Spencer, stepping\nit out. “No, that won’t do, so confined by the quarry. Let us look\nfarther.”\n\nA surmise crossed Ethel. Could he be going to take the work on himself,\nbut that was too wild a supposition--she knew he had nothing of his own,\nonly a moderate pension from the East India Company.\n\n“What do you think of this?” he said, coming to the slope of a knoll,\ncommanding a pretty view of the Abbotstoke woods, clear from houses, and\nyet not remote from the hamlet. She agreed that it would do well, and\nhe kicked up a bit of turf, and pryed into the soil, pronouncing it dry,\nand fit for a good foundation. Then he began to step it out, making\na circuit that amazed her, but he said, “It is of no use to do it at\ntwice. Your school can be only the first step towards a church, and you\nhad better have room--enough at once. It will serve as an endowment in\nthe meantime.”\n\nHe would not let her remain in the sun, and she went into school.\nShe found him, when she came out, sitting in the arbour smoking a\ncigar-rather a shock to her feelings, though he threw it away the\ninstant she appeared, and she excused him for his foreign habits.\n\nIn the evening, he brought down a traveller’s case of instruments, and\nproceeded to draw a beautiful little map of Cocksmoor, where it seemed\nthat he had taken all his measurements, whilst she was in school. He\nended by an imaginary plan and elevation for the school, with a pretty\noriel window and bell-gable, that made Ethel sigh with delight at the\nbare idea.\n\nNext day, he vanished after dinner, but this he often did; he used to\nsay he must go and have a holiday of smoking--he could not bear too much\ncivilised society. He came back for tea, however, and had not sat down\nlong before he said, “Now, I know all about it. I shall pack up my\ngoods, and be off for Vienna to-morrow.”\n\n“To Vienna!” was the general and dolorous outcry, and Gertrude laid hold\nof him and said he should not go.\n\n“I am coming back,” he said, “if you will have me. The college holds a\ncourt at Fordholm on the 3rd, and on the last of this month, I hope to\nreturn.”\n\n“College! Court! What are you going to do at Vienna? Where have you left\nyour senses?” asked Dr. May.\n\n“I find Sir Henry Walkinghame is there. I have been on an exploring\nexpedition to Drydale, found out his man of business, and where he is to\nbe written to. The college holds a court at Fordholm, and I hope to have\nour business settled.”\n\nEthel was too much confounded to speak. Her father was exclaiming on the\nshortness of the time.\n\n“Plenty of time,” said Dr. Spencer, demonstrating that he should be able\nto travel comfortably, and have four days to spare at Vienna--a journey\nwhich he seemed to think less of, than did Dr. May of going to London.\n\nAs to checking him, of that there was no possibility, nor, indeed,\nnotion, though Ethel did not quite know how to believe in it, nor that\nthe plan could come to good. Ethel was much better by this time: by her\nvigorous efforts, she had recovered her tone of mind and interest in\nwhat was passing; and though now and then Norman’s letters, carrying\nsentences of remembrance, made her glow a little, she was so steady\nto her resolution that she averted all traffic in messages through her\nbrother’s correspondence, and, in that fear, allowed it to lapse into\nMargaret’s hands more than she had ever done. Indeed, no one greatly\nliked writing from home, it was heartless work to say always, “No news\nfrom the Alcestis” and yet they all declared they were not anxious.\n\nHector Ernescliffe knelt a great while beside Margaret’s sofa, on the\nfirst evening of his holidays, and there was a long low-voiced talk\nbetween them. Ethel wished that she had warned him off, for Margaret\nlooked much more harassed and anxious, after having heard the outpouring\nof all that was on his mind.\n\nDr. Spencer thought her looking worse, when he came, as come he did, on\nthe appointed day. He had brought Sir Henry Walkinghame’s full consent\nto the surrender of the land; drawn up in such form as could be acted\nupon, and a letter to his man of business. But Nicolson! He was a worse\ndragon nearer home, hating all schools, especially hating Dr. May.\n\nHowever, said Dr. Spencer, in eastern form, “Have I encountered Rajahs,\nand smoked pipes with three-tailed Pachas, that I should dread the face\nof the father of quarrymen.”\n\nWhat he did with the father of quarrymen was not known, whether he\ntalked him over, or bought him off--Margaret hoped the former; Dr. May\nfeared the latter; the results were certain; Mr. Nicolson had agreed\nthat the land should be given up.\n\nThe triumphant Dr. Spencer sat down to write a statement to be shown to\nthe college authorities, when they should come to hold their court.\n\n“The land must be put into the hands of trustees,” he said. “The\nincumbent of course?”\n\n“Then yourself; and we must have another. Your son-in-law?”\n\n“You, I should think,” said Dr. May.\n\n“I! Why, I am going.”\n\n“Going, but not gone,” said his friend.\n\n“I must go! I tell you, Dick; I must have a place of my own to smoke my\npipe in.”\n\n“Is that all?” said Dr. May. “I think you might be accommodated here,\nunless you wished to be near your sister.”\n\n“My sister is always resorting to watering-places. My nieces do nothing\nbut play on the piano. No, I shall perhaps go off to America, the only\nplace I have not seen yet, and I more than half engaged to go and help\nat Poonshedagore.”\n\n“Better order your coffin then,” muttered Dr. May.\n\n“I shall try lodgings in London, near the old hospital, perhaps--and go\nand turn over the British Museum library.”\n\n“Look you here, Spencer, I have a much better plan. Do you know that\nscrap of a house of mine, by the back gate, just big enough for you\nand your pipe? Set up your staff there. Ethel will never get her school\nbuilt without you.”\n\n“Oh! that would be capital!” cried Ethel.\n\n“It would be the best speculation for me. You would pay rent, and the\nlast old woman never did,” continued Dr. May. “A garden the length of\nthis one--”\n\n“But I say--I want to be near the British Museum.”\n\n“Take a season-ticket, and run up once a week.”\n\n“I shall teach your boys to smoke!”\n\n“I’ll see to that!”\n\n“You have given Cocksmoor one lift,” said Ethel, “and it will never go\non without you.”\n\n“It is such a nice house!” added the children, in chorus; “it would be\nsuch fun to have you there.”\n\n“Daisy will never be able to spare her other doctor,” said Margaret,\nsmiling.\n\n“Run to Mrs. Adams, Tom, and get the key,” said Dr. May.\n\nThere was a putting on of hats and bonnets, and the whole party walked\ndown the garden to inspect the house--a matter of curiosity to some--for\nit was where the old lady had resided on whom Harry had played so many\ntricks, and the subject of many myths hatched between him and George\nLarkins.\n\nIt was an odd, little narrow slip of a house, four stories, of two rooms\nall the way up, each with a large window, with a marked white eyebrow.\nDr. May eagerly pointed out all the conveniences, parlour, museum,\nsmoking den, while Dr. Spencer listened, and answered doubtfully; and\nthe children’s clamorous anxiety seemed to render him the more silent.\n\nHector Ernescliffe discovered a jackdaw’s nest in the chimney, whereupon\nthe whole train rushed off to investigate, leaving the two doctors and\nEthel standing together in the empty parlour, Dr. May pressing, Dr.\nSpencer raising desultory objections; but so evidently against his own\nwishes, that Ethel said, “Now, indeed, you must not disappoint us all.”\n\n“No,” said Dr. May, “it is a settled thing.”\n\n“No, no, thanks, thanks to you all, but it cannot be. Let me go;” and he\nspoke with emotion. “You are very kind, but it is not to be thought of.”\n\n“Why not?” said Dr. May. “Spencer, stay with me;” and he spoke with a\npleading, almost dependent air. “Why should you go?”\n\n“It is of no use to talk about it. You are very kind, but it will not do\nto encumber you with a lone man, growing old.”\n\n“We have been young together,” said Dr. May.\n\n“And you must not leave papa,” added Ethel.\n\n“No,” said Dr. May. “Trouble may be at hand. Help us through with it.\nRemember, these children have no uncles.”\n\n“You will stay?” said Ethel.\n\nHe made a sign of assent--he could do no more, and just then Gertrude\ncame trotting back, so exceedingly smutty, as to call everybody’s\nattention. Hector had been shoving Tom half-way up the chimney, in\nhopes of reaching the nest; and the consequences of this amateur\nchimney-sweeping had been a plentiful bespattering of all the spectators\nwith soot, that so greatly distressed the young ladies, that Mary and\nBlanche had fled away from public view.\n\nDr. Spencer’s first act of possession was to threaten to pull Tom down\nby the heels for disturbing his jackdaws, whereupon there was a general\nacclamation; and Dr. May began to talk of marauding times, when the\njackdaws in the Minster tower had been harried.\n\n“Ah!” said Dr. Spencer, as Tom emerged, blacker than the outraged\njackdaws, and half choked, “what do you know about jackdaws’ nests? You\nthat are no Whichcote scholars.”\n\n“Don’t we?” cried Hector, “when there is a jackdaw’s nest in Eton\nChapel, twenty feet high.”\n\n“Old Grey made that!” said Tom, who usually acted the part of esprit\nfort to Hector’s credulity.\n\n“Why, there is a picture of it on Jesse’s book,” said Hector.\n\n“But may not we get up on the roof, to see if we can get at the nest,\npapa?” said Tom.\n\n“You must ask Dr. Spencer. It is his house.”\n\nDr. Spencer did not gainsay it, and proceeded even to show the old\nWhichcote spirit, by leading the assault, and promising to take care of\nAubrey, while Ethel retained Gertrude, and her father too; for Dr. May\nhad such a great inclination to scramble up the ladder after them, that\nshe, thinking it a dangerous experiment for so helpless an arm, was\nobliged to assure him that it would create a sensation among the\ngossiphood of Stoneborough, if their physician were seen disporting\nhimself on the top of the house.\n\n“Ah! I’m not a physician unattached, like him,” said Dr. May, laughing.\n“Hullo! have you got up, Tom? There’s a door up there. I’ll show you--”\n\n“No, don’t papa. Think of Mrs. Ledwich; and asking her to see two\ntrustees up there!” said Ethel.\n\n“Ah! Mrs. Ledwich; what is to be done with her, Ethel?”\n\n“I am sure I can’t tell. If Flora were but at home, she would manage\nit.”\n\n“Spencer can manage anything!” was the answer. “That was the happiest\nchance imaginable that you came home with me, and so we came to go by\nthe same train.”\n\nEthel was only afraid that time was being cruelly wasted; but the best\nmen, and it is emphatically the best that generally are so--have the\nboy strong enough on one side or other of their natures, to be a great\nprovocation to womankind; and Dr. Spencer did not rest from his pursuit\ntill the brood of the jackdaws had been discovered, and two gray-headed\nnestlings kidnapped, which were destined to a wicker cage and education.\nLittle Aubrey was beyond measure proud, and was suggesting all sorts of\noutrageous classical names for them, till politely told by Tom that he\nwould make them as great prigs as himself, and that their names should\nbe nothing but Jack and Jill.\n\n“There’s nothing for it but for Aubrey to go to school,” cried Tom,\nsententiously turning round to Ethel.\n\n“Ay, to Stoneborough,” said Dr. Spencer.\n\nTom coloured, as if sorry for his movement, and hastened away to make\nhimself sufficiently clean to go in quest of a prison for his captives.\n\nDr. Spencer began to bethink him of the paper that he had been so\neagerly drawing up, and looking at his own begrimed hands, asked Ethel\nwhether she would have him for a trustee.\n\n“Will the other eight ladies?” said Ethel, “that’s the point.”\n\n“Ha, Spencer! you did not know what you were undertaking. Do you wish to\nbe let off?” said Dr. May.\n\n“Not I,” said the undaunted doctor. “Come, Ethel, let us hear what\nshould be done.”\n\n“There’s no time,” said Ethel, bewildered. “The court will be only on\nthe day after to-morrow.”\n\n“Ample time!” said Dr. Spencer, who seemed ready to throw himself into\nit with all his might. “What we have to do is this. The ladies to be\npropitiated are--”\n\n“Nine Muses, to whom you will have to act Apollo,” said Dr. May, who,\nhaving put his friend into the situation, had a mischievous delight in\nlaughing at him, and watching what he would do.\n\n“One and two, Ethel, and Mrs. Rivers!”\n\n“Rather eight and nine,” said Ethel, “though Flora may be somebody now.”\n\n“Seven then,” said Dr. Spencer. “Well then, Ethel, suppose we set out\non our travels this afternoon. Visit these ladies, get them to call a\nmeeting to-morrow, and sanction their three trustees.”\n\n“You little know what a work it is to call a meeting, or how many notes\nMiss Rich sends out before one can be accomplished.”\n\n“Faint heart--you know the proverb, Ethel. Allons. I’ll call on Mrs.\nLedwich--”\n\n“Stay,” said Dr. May. “Let Ethel do that, and ask her to tea, and we\nwill show her your drawing of the school.”\n\nSo the remaining ladies were divided--Ethel was to visit Miss Anderson,\nMiss Boulder, and Mrs. Ledwich; Dr. Spencer, the rest, and a meeting, if\npossible, be appointed for the next day.\n\nEthel did as she was told, though rather against the grain, and her\nshort, abrupt manner was excused the more readily, that Dr. Spencer had\nbeen a subject of much mysterious speculation in Stoneborough, and to\ngain any intelligence respecting him, was a great object; so that she\nwas extremely welcome wherever she called.\n\nMrs. Ledwich promised to come to tea, and instantly prepared to walk\nto Miss Rich, and authorise her to send out the notes of summons to the\nmorrow’s meeting. Ethel offered to walk with her, and found Mrs. and\nMiss Rich in a flutter, after Dr. Spencer’s call; the daughter just\ngoing to put on her bonnet and consult Mrs. Ledwich, and both extremely\nenchanted with Dr. Spencer, who “would be such an acquisition.”\n\nThe hour was fixed and the notes sent out, and Ethel met Dr. Spencer at\nthe garden gate.\n\n“Well!” he said, smiling, “I think we have fixed them off--have not we?”\n\n“Yes; but is it not heartless that everything should be done through so\nmuch nonsense?”\n\n“Did you ever hear why the spire of Ulm Cathedral was never finished?”\n said Dr. Spencer.\n\n“No; why not?”\n\n“Because the citizens would accept no help from their neighbours.”\n\n“I am glad enough of help when it comes in the right way, and from good\nmotives.”\n\n“There are more good motives in the world than you give people credit\nfor, Ethel. You have a good father, good sense, and a good education;\nand you have some perception of the system by which things like this\nshould be done. Unfortunately, the system is in bad hands here, and\nthese good ladies have been left to work for themselves, and it is no\nwonder that there is plenty of little self-importance, nonsense, and the\nlike, among them; but for their own sakes we should rather show them the\nway, than throw them overboard.”\n\n“If they will be shown,” said Ethel.\n\n“I can’t say they seemed to me so very formidable,” said Dr. Spencer.\n“Gentle little women.”\n\n“Oh! it is only Mrs. Ledwich that stirs them up. I hope you are prepared\nfor that encounter.”\n\nMrs. Ledwich came to tea, sparkling with black bugles, and was very\npatronising and amiable. Her visits were generally subjects of great\ndread, for she talked unceasingly, laid down the law, and overwhelmed\nMargaret with remedies; but to-night Dr. Spencer took her in hand. It\nwas not that he went out of his ordinary self, he was always the same\nsimple-mannered, polished gentleman; but it was this that told--she was\nevidently somewhat in awe of him--the refinement kept her in check. She\nbehaved very quietly all the evening, admired the plans, consented to\neverything, and was scarcely Mrs. Ledwich!\n\n“You will get on now, Ethel,” said Dr. May afterwards. “Never fear but\nthat he will get the Ladies’ Committee well in hand.”\n\n“Why do you think so, papa?”\n\n“Never you fear.”\n\nThat was all she could extract from him, though he looked very arch. The\nLadies’ Committee accepted of their representatives with full consent;\nand the indefatigable Dr. Spencer next had to hunt up the fellow\ntrustee. He finally contrived to collect every one he wanted at\nFordholm, the case was laid before the College--the College was\npropitious, and by four o’clock in the evening, Dr. Spencer laid before\nEthel the promise of the piece of land.\n\nMary’s joy was unbounded, and Ethel blushed, and tried to thank. This\nwould have been the summit of felicity a year ago, and she was vexed\nwith herself for feeling that though land and money were both in such\nsafe hands, she could not care sufficiently to feel the ecstasy the\nattainment of her object would once have given to her. Then she would\nhave been frantic with excitement, and heedless of everything; now she\ntook it so composedly as to annoy herself.\n\n“To think of that one week at Oxford having so entirely turned this head\nof mine!”\n\nPerhaps it was the less at home, because she had just heard that George\nand Flora had accepted an invitation to Glenbracken, but though the zest\nof Cocksmoor might be somewhat gone, she called herself to order, and\ngave her full attention to all that was planned by her champion.\n\nNever did man plunge into business more thoroughly than he, when he\nhad once undertaken it. He was one of those men who, from gathering\nparticulars of every practical matter that comes under their notice, are\nable to accomplish well whatever they set their hand to; and building\nwas not new to him, though his former subjects--a church and mission\nstation in India--bore little remembrance to the present.\n\nHe bought a little round dumpling of a white pony, and trotted all over\nthe country in search of building materials and builders, he discovered\ntrees in distant timber-yards, he brought home specimens of stone, one\nin each pocket, to compare and analyse, he went to London to look at\nmodel schools, he drew plans each more neat and beautiful than the\nlast, he compared builders’ estimates, and wrote letters to the National\nSociety, so as to be able to begin in the spring.\n\nIn the meantime he was settling himself, furnishing his new house with\ngreat precision and taste. He would have no assistance in his choice,\neither of servants or furniture, but made numerous journeys of\ninspection to Whitford, to Malvern, and to London, and these seemed\nto make him the more content with Stoneborough. Sir Matthew Fleet had\nevidently chilled him, and as he found his own few remaining relations\nuncongenial, he became the more ready to find a resting-place in the\ngray old town, the scene of his school life, beside the friend of his\nyouth, and the children of her, for whose sake he had never sought a\nhome of his own. Though he now and then talked of seeing America, or\nof going back to India, in hopes of assisting his beloved mission at\nPoonshedagore, these plans were fast dying away, as he formed habits and\nattachments, and perceived the sphere of usefulness open to him.\n\nIt was a great step when his packages arrived, and his beautiful Indian\ncuriosities were arranged, making his drawing-room as pretty a room as\ncould anywhere be seen; in readiness, as he used to tell Ethel, for a\ngrand tea-party for all the Ladies’ Committee, when he should borrow\nher and the best silver teapot to preside. Moreover, he had a chemical\napparatus, a telescope, and microscope, of great power, wherewith he\ntried experiments that were the height of felicity to Tom and Ethel,\nand much interested their father. He made it his business to have full\noccupation for himself, with plans, books, or correspondence, so as not\nto be a charge on the hands of the May family, with whom he never spent\nan evening without special and earnest invitation.\n\nHe gave attendance at the hospital on alternate days, as well as taking\noff Dr. May’s hands such of his gratuitous patients as were not averse\nto quit their old doctor, and could believe in a physician in shepherd’s\nplaid, and Panama hat. Exceedingly sociable, he soon visited every one\nfar and wide, and went to every sort of party, from the grand dinners\nof the “county families,” to the tea-drinkings of the Stoneborough\nladies--a welcome guest at all, and enjoying each in his own way.\nEnglish life was so new to him that he entered into the little\naccessories with the zest of a youth; and there seemed to be a curious\nchange between the two old fellow students, the elder and more staid of\nformer days having come back with unencumbered freshness to enliven his\nfriend, just beginning to grow aged under the wear of care and sorrows.\n\nIt was very droll to hear Dr. May laughing at Dr. Spencer’s histories\nof his adventures, and at the new aspects in which his own well-trodden\ndistrict appeared to travelled eyes; and not less amusing was Dr.\nSpencer’s resolute defence of all the nine muses, generally and\nindividually.\n\nHe certainly had no reason to think ill of them. As one woman, they were\nled by him, and conformed their opinions. The only seceder was Louisa\nAnderson, who had her brother for her oracle; and, indeed, the more\nyouthful race, to whom Harvey was the glass of fashion, uttered\ndisrespectful opinions as to the doctor’s age, and would not accede to\nhis being, as Mrs. Ledwich declared, “much younger than Dr. May.”\n\nHarvey Anderson had first attempted patronage, then argument, with Dr.\nSpencer, but found him equally impervious to both. “Very clever, but an\nold world man,” said Harvey. “He has made up his bundle of prejudices.”\n\n“Clever sort of lad!” said Dr. Spencer, “a cool hand, but very\nshallow--”\n\nEthel wondered to hear thus lightly disposed of, the powers of argument\nthat had been thought fairly able to compete with Norman, and which\nhad taxed him so severely. She did not know how differently abstract\nquestions appear to a mature mind, confirmed in principle by practice;\nand to one young, struggling in self-formation, and more used to\ntheories than to realities.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\n\n     The heart may ache, but may not burst;\n     Heaven will not leave thee, nor forsake.\n                                     Christian Year.\n\n\nHector and Tom finished their holidays by a morning’s shooting at the\nGrange, Dr. May promising to meet them, and let them drive him home.\n\nMeta was out when he arrived; and, repairing to the library, he found\nMr. Rivers sitting by a fire, though it was early in September, with the\nnewspaper before him, but not reading. He looked depressed, and seemed\nmuch disappointed at having heard that George and Flora had accepted\nsome further invitations in Scotland, and did not intend to return for\nanother month. Dr. May spoke cheerfully of the hospitality and kindness\nthey had met, but failed to enliven him, and, as if trying to assign\nsome cause for his vexation, he lamented over fogs and frosts, and began\nto dread an October in Scotland for Flora, almost as if it were the\nArctic regions.\n\nHe grew somewhat more animated in praising Flora, and speaking of the\ngreat satisfaction he had in seeing his son married to so admirable a\nperson. He only wished it could be the same with his daughter.\n\n“You are a very unselfish father,” said Dr. May. “I cannot imagine you\nwithout your little fairy.”\n\n“It would be hard to part,” said Mr. Rivers, sighing; “yet I should be\nrelieved to see her in good hands, so pretty and engaging as she is, and\nsomething of an heiress. With our dear Flora, she is secure of a happy\nhome when I am gone, but still I should be glad to have seen--” and he\nbroke off thoughtfully.\n\n“She is so sensible, that we shall see her make a good choice,” said Dr.\nMay, smiling; “that is, if she choose at all, for I do not know who is\nworthy of her.”\n\n“I am quite indifferent as to fortune,” continued Mr. Rivers. “She will\nhave enough of her own.”\n\n“Enough not to be dependent, which is the point,” said Dr. May, “though\nI should have few fears for her any way.”\n\n“It would be a comfort,” harped on Mr. Rivers, dwelling on the subject,\nas if he wanted to say something, “if she were only safe with a man\nwho knew how to value her and make her happy. Such a young man as your\nNorman, now--I have often thought--”\n\nDr. May would not seem to hear, but he could not prevent himself from\nblushing as crimson as if he had been the very Norman, as he answered,\ngoing on with his own speech, as if Mr. Rivers’s had been unmade, “She\nis the brightest little creature under the sun, and the sparkle is down\nso deep within, that however it may turn out, I should never fear for\nher happiness.”\n\n“Flora is my great reliance,” proceeded Mr. Rivers. “Her aunt, Lady\nLeonora, is very kind, but somehow she does not seem to suit with Meta.”\n\n“Oh, ho,” thought the doctor, “have you made that discovery, my good\nfriend?”\n\nThe voices of the two boys were heard in the hall, explaining their\nachievements to Meta, and Dr. May took his departure, Hector driving\nhim, and embarking in a long discourse on his own affairs as if he\nhad quite forgotten that the doctor was not his father, and going on\nemphatically, in spite of the absence of mind now and then betrayed by\nhis auditor, who, at Dr. Spencer’s door, exclaimed, “Stop, Hector, let\nme out here--thank you;” and presently brought out his friend into the\ngarden, and sat down on the grass, talking low and earnestly over the\ndisease with which Mr. Rivers had been so long affected; for though Dr.\nMay could not perceive any positively unfavourable symptom, he had\nbeen rendered vaguely uneasy by the unusual heaviness and depression\nof manner. So long did they sit conversing, that Blanche was sent out,\nprimed with an impertinent message, that two such old doctors ought to\nbe ashamed of themselves for sitting so late in the dew.\n\nDr. Spencer was dragged in to drink tea, and the meal had just been\nmerrily concluded, when the door bell rang, and a message was brought\nin. “The carriage from the Grange, sir; Miss Rivers would be much\nobliged if you would come directly.”\n\n“There!” said Dr. May, looking at Dr. Spencer, as if to say, I told you\nso, in the first triumph of professional sagacity; but the next moment\nexclaiming, “Poor little Meta!” he hurried away.\n\nA gloom fell on those who remained, for, besides their sympathy for\nMeta, and their liking for her kind old father, there was that one\nunacknowledged heartache, which, though in general bravely combated,\nlay in wait always ready to prey on them. Hector stole round to sit by\nMargaret, and Dr. Spencer muttered, “This will never do,” and sent\nTom to fetch some papers lying on his table, whence he read them some\ncurious accounts that he had just received from his missionary friends\nin India.\n\nThey were interested, but in a listening mood, that caused a universal\nstart when the bell again sounded. This time, James reported that the\nservant from the Grange said his master was very ill--he had brought\na letter to post for Mr. George Rivers, and here was a note for Miss\nEthel. It was the only note Ethel had ever received from her father, and\ncontained these few words:\n\n\n“DEAR E.--,\n\n“I believe this attack will be the last. Come to Meta, and bring my\nthings.                                        R. M.”\n\n\nEthel put her hands to her forehead. It was as if she had been again\nplunged into the stunned dream of misery of four years ago, and her\nsensation was of equal bewilderment and uselessness; but it was but for\na moment--the next she was in a state of over-bustle and eagerness. She\nwanted to fly about and hasten to help Meta, and could hardly obey the\nword and gesture by which Margaret summoned her to her side.\n\n“Dear Ethel, you must calm yourself, or you will not be of use.”\n\n“I? I can’t be of any use! Oh, if you could go! If Flora were but here!\nBut I must go, Margaret.”\n\n“I will put up your father’s things,” said Dr. Spencer, in a soothing\ntone. “The carriage cannot be ready in a moment, so that there will be\nfull time.”\n\nMary and Miss Bracy prepared Ethel’s own goods, which she would\notherwise have forgotten; and Margaret, meanwhile, detained her by her\nside, trying to calm and encourage her with gentle words of counsel,\nthat might hinder her from giving way to the flurry of emotion that had\nseized her, and prevent her from thinking herself certain to be useless.\n\nAdams was to drive her thither in the gig, and it presently came to the\ndoor. Dr. Spencer wrapped her up well in cloaks and shawls, and spoke\nwords of kindly cheer in her ear as she set off. The fresh night air\nblew pleasantly on her, the stars glimmered in full glory overhead,\nand now and then her eye was caught by the rocket-like track of a\nshooting-star. Orion was rising slowly far in the east, and bringing to\nher mind the sailor-boy under the southern sky; if, indeed, he were\nnot where sun and stars no more are the light. It was strange that the\nthought came more as soothing than as acute pain; she could bear to\nthink of him thus in her present frame, as long as she had not to\ntalk of him. Under those solemn stars, the life everlasting seemed\nto overpower the sense of this mortal life, and Ethel’s agitation was\ncalmed away.\n\nThe old cedar-tree stood up in stately blackness against the sky, and\nthe lights in the house glanced behind it. The servants looked rather\nsurprised to see Ethel, as if she were not expected, and conducted her\nto the great drawing-room, which looked the more desolate and solitary,\nfrom the glare of lamplight, falling on the empty seats which Ethel\nhad lately seen filled with a glad home party. She was looking round,\nthinking whether to venture up to Meta’s room, and there summon\nBellairs, when Meta came gliding in, and threw her arms round her.\nEthel could not speak, but Meta’s voice was more cheerful than she had\nexpected. “How kind of you, dear Ethel!”\n\n“Papa sent for me,” said Ethel.\n\n“He is so kind! Can Margaret spare you?”\n\n“Oh, yes; but you must leave me. You must want to be with him.”\n\n“He never lets me come in when he has these attacks,” said Meta. “If he\nonly would! But will you come up to my room? That is nearer.”\n\n“Is papa with him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nMeta wound her arms round Ethel, and led her up to her sitting-room,\nwhere a book lay on the table. She said that her father had seemed weary\nand torpid, and had sat still until almost their late dinner-hour, when\nhe seemed to bethink himself of dressing, and had risen. She thought\nhe walked weakly, and rather tottering, and had run to make him lean on\nher, which he did, as far as his own room door. There he had kissed\nher, and thanked her, and murmured a word like blessing. She had not,\nhowever, been alarmed, until his servant had come to tell her that he\nhad another seizure.\n\nEthel asked whether she had seen Dr. May since he had been with her\nfather. She had; but Ethel was surprised to find that she had not taken\nin the extent of his fears. She had become so far accustomed to these\nattacks, that, though anxious and distressed, she did not apprehend more\nthan a few days’ weakness, and her chief longing was to be of use. She\nwas speaking cheerfully of beginning her nursing to-morrow, and of her\ngreat desire that her papa would allow her to sit up with him, when\nthere was a slow, reluctant movement of the lock of the door, and the\ntwo girls sprang to their feet, as Dr. May opened it; and Ethel read his\ncountenance at once.\n\nNot so Meta. “How is he? May I go to him?” cried she.\n\n“Not now, my dear,” said Dr. May, putting his hand on her shoulder, in\na gentle, detaining manner, that sent a thrill of trembling through her\nframe, though she did not otherwise move. She only clasped her hands\ntogether, and looked up into his face. He answered the look. “Yes, my\ndear, the struggle is over.”\n\nEthel came near, and put her arm round Meta’s waist, as if to strengthen\nher, as she stood quite passive and still.\n\nDr. May seemed to think it best that all should be told; but, though\nintently watching Meta, he directed his words to his own daughter.\n“Thank Heaven, it has been shorter, and less painful, than I had dared\nto hope.”\n\nMeta tried to speak, but could not bring out the words, and, with an\nimploring look at Ethel, as if to beg her to make them clear for her,\nshe inarticulately murmured, “Oh! why did you not call me?”\n\n“I could not. He would not let me. His last conscious word to me was not\nto let you see him suffer.”\n\nMeta wrung her clasped hands together in mute anguish. Dr. May signed to\nEthel to guide her back to the sofa, but the movement seemed so far to\nrouse her, that she said, “I should like to go to bed.”\n\n“Right--the best thing,” said Dr. May; and he whispered to Ethel, “Go\nwith her, but don’t try to rouse her--don’t talk to her. Come back to\nme, presently.”\n\nHe did not even shake hands with Meta, nor wish her good-night, as she\ndisappeared into her own room.\n\nBellairs undressed her, and Ethel stood watching, till the young head,\nunder the load of sorrow, so new to it, was laid on the pillow. Bellairs\nasked her if she would have a light.\n\n“No, no, thank you--the dark and alone. Good-night,” said Meta. Ethel\nwent back to the sitting-room, where her father was standing at the\nwindow, looking out into the night. He turned as she came in, folded her\nin his arms, and kissed her forehead. “And how is the poor little dear?”\n he asked.\n\n“The same,” said Ethel. “I can’t bear to leave her alone, and to have\nsaid nothing to comfort her.”\n\n“It is too soon as yet,” said Dr. May--“her mind has not taken it in. I\nhope she will sleep all night, and have more strength to look at it when\nshe wakens.”\n\n“She was utterly unprepared.”\n\n“I could not make her understand me,” said Dr. May.\n\n“And, oh, papa, what a pity she was not there!”\n\n“It was no sight for her, till the last few minutes; and his whole mind\nseemed bent on sparing her. What tenderness it has been.”\n\n“Must we leave her to herself all night?”\n\n“Better so,” said Dr. May. “She has been used to loneliness; and to\nthrust companionship on her would be only harassing.”\n\nEthel, who scarcely knew what it was to be alone, looked as if she did\nnot understand.\n\n“I used to try to force consolation on people,” said Dr. May, “but I\nknow, now, that it can only be done by following their bent.”\n\n“You have seen so many sorrows,” said Ethel.\n\n“I never understood till I felt,” said Dr. May. “Those few first days\nwere a lesson.”\n\n“I did not think you knew what was passing,” said Ethel.\n\n“I doubt whether any part of my life is more distinctly before me than\nthose two days,” said Dr. May. “Flora coming in and out, and poor Alan\nsitting by me; but I don’t believe I had any will. I could no more have\nmoved my mind than my broken arm; and I verily think, Ethel, that, but\nfor that merciful torpor, I should have been frantic. It taught me never\nto disturb grief.”\n\n“And what shall we do?”\n\n“You must stay with her till Flora comes. I will be here as much as I\ncan. She is our charge, till they come home. I told him, between the\nspasms, that I had sent for you, and he seemed pleased.”\n\n“If only I were anybody else!”\n\nDr. May again threw his arm round her, and looked into her face. He felt\nthat he had rather have her, such as she was, than anybody else; and,\ntogether, they sat down, and talked of what was to be done, and what\nwas best for Meta, and of the solemnity of being in the house of death.\nEthel felt and showed it so much, in her subdued, awe-struck manner,\nthat her father felt checked whenever he was about to return to his\nordinary manner, familiarised, as he necessarily was, with the like\nscenes. It drew him back to the thought of their own trouble, and their\nconversation recurred to those days, so that each gained a more full\nunderstanding of the other, and they at length separated, certainly with\nthe more peaceful and soft feelings for being in the abode of mourning.\n\nBellairs promised to call Ethel, to be with her young lady as early as\nmight be, reporting that she was sound asleep. And sleep continued to\nshield her till past her usual hour, so that Ethel was up, and had been\nwith Dr. May, before she was summoned to her, and then she found her\nhalf dressed, and hastening that she might not make Dr. May late for\nbreakfast, and in going to his patients. There was an elasticity in the\nhappily constituted young mind that could not be entirely struck down,\nnor deprived of power of taking thought for others. Yet her eyes looked\nwandering, and unlike themselves, and her words, now and then, faltered,\nas if she was not sure what she was doing or saying. Ethel told her not\nto mind--Dr. Spencer would take care of the patients; but she did not\nseem to recollect, at first, who Dr. Spencer was, nor to care for being\nreminded.\n\nBreakfast was laid out in the little sitting-room. Ethel wanted to take\nthe trouble off her hands, but she would not let her. She sat behind her\nurn, and asked about tea or coffee, quite accurately, in a low, subdued\nvoice, that nearly overcame Dr. May. When the meal was over, and she had\nrung the bell, and risen up, as if to her daily work, she turned\nround, with that piteous, perplexed air, and stood for a moment, as if\nconfused.\n\n“Cannot we help you?” said Ethel.\n\n“I don’t know. Thank you. But, Dr. May, I must not keep you from other\npeople--”\n\n“I have no one to go to this morning,” said Dr. May. “I am ready to stay\nwith you, my dear.”\n\nMeta came closer to him, and murmured, “Thank you!”\n\nThe breakfast things had, by this time, been taken away, and Meta,\nlooking to see that the door had shut for the last time, said, in a low\nvoice, “Now tell me--”\n\nDr. May drew her down to sit on the sofa beside him, and, in his soft,\nsweet voice, told her all that she wished to learn of her father’s last\nhours, and was glad to see showers of quiet, wholesome tears drop freely\ndown, but without violence, and she scarcely attempted to speak. There\nwas a pause at the end, and then she said gently, “Thank you, for it\nall. Dear papa!” And she rose up, and went back to her room.\n\n“She has learned to dwell apart,” said Dr. May, much moved.\n\n“How beautiful she bears up!” said Ethel.\n\n“It has been a life which, as she has used it, has taught her strength\nand self-dependence in the midst of prosperity.”\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel, “she has trained herself by her dread of\nself-indulgence, and seeking after work. But oh! what a break up it is\nfor her! I cannot think how she holds up. Shall I go to her?”\n\n“I think not. She knows the way to the only Comforter. I am not afraid\nof her after those blessed tears.”\n\nDr. May was right; Meta presently returned to them, in the same gentle\nsubdued sadness, enfolding her, indeed, as a flower weighed down by\nmist, but not crushing nor taking away her powers. It was as if she were\ntruly upheld; and thankful to her friends as she was, she did not throw\nherself on them in utter dependence or self-abandonment.\n\nShe wrote needful letters, shedding many tears over them, and often\nobliged to leave off to give the blinding weeping its course, but\nrefusing to impose any unnecessary task upon Dr. May’s lame arm. All\nthat was right, she strove to do; she saw Mr. Charles Wilmot, and\nwas refreshed by his reading to her; and when Dr. May desired it, she\nsubmissively put on her bonnet, and took several turns with Ethel in the\nshrubbery, though it made her cry heartily to look into the downstairs\nrooms. And she lay on the sofa at last, owning herself strangely tired,\nshe did not know why, and glad that Ethel should read to her. By and by,\nshe went to dress for the evening, and came back, full of the tidings\nthat one of the children in the village had been badly burned. It\noccupied her very much--she made Ethel promise to go and see about her\nto-morrow, and sent Bellairs at once with every comfort that she could\ndevise.\n\nOn the whole, those two days were to Ethel a peaceful and comfortable\ntime. She saw more than usual of her father, and had such conversations\nwith him as were seldom practicable at home, and that chimed in with the\nunavowed care which hung on their minds; while Meta was a most sweet and\nloving charge, without being a burden, and often saying such beautiful\nthings in her affectionate resignation, that Ethel could only admire\nand lay them up in her mind. Dr. May went backwards and forwards, and\nbrought good accounts of Margaret and fond messages; he slept at the\nGrange each night, and Meta used to sit in the corner of the sofa and\nwork, or not, as best suited her, while she listened to his talk with\nEthel, and now and then herself joined.\n\nGeorge Rivers’s absence was a serious inconvenience in all arrangements;\nbut his sister dreaded his grief as much as she wished for his return;\nand often were the posts and the journeys reckoned over, without a\nsatisfactory conclusion, as to when he could arrive from so remote a\npart of Scotland.\n\nAt last, as the two girls had finished their early dinner, the butler\nbrought in word that Mr. Norman May was there. Meta at once begged that\nhe would come in, and Ethel went into the hall to meet him. He looked\nvery wan, with the dark rings round his eyes a deeper purple than ever,\nand he could hardly find utterance to ask, “How is she?”\n\n“As good and sweet as she can be,” said Ethel warmly; but no more, for\nMeta herself had come to the dining-room door, and was holding out her\nhand. Norman took it in both his, but could not speak; Meta’s own soft\nvoice was the first. “I thought you would come--he was so fond of you.”\n\nPoor Norman quite gave way, and Meta was the one to speak gentle words\nof soothing. “There is so much to be thankful for,” she said. “He has\nbeen spared so much of the suffering Dr. May feared for him; and he was\nso happy about George.”\n\nNorman made a great effort to recover himself. Ethel asked for Flora and\nGeorge. It appeared that they had been on an excursion when the first\nletter arrived at Glenbracken, and thus had received both together in\nthe evening, on their return. George had been greatly overcome, and they\nhad wished to set off instantly; but Lady Glenbracken would not hear\nof Flora’s travelling night and day, and it had at length been arranged\nthat Norman Ogilvie should drive Norman across the country that evening,\nto catch the mail for Edinburgh, and he had been on the road ever since.\nGeorge was following with his wife more slowly, and would be at home\nto-morrow evening. Meantime, he sent full authority to his father-in-law\nto make arrangements.\n\nEthel went to see the burned child, leaving Meta to take her walk in the\ngarden under Norman’s charge. He waited on her with a sort of distant\nreverence for a form of grief, so unlike what he had dreaded for\nher, when the first shock of the tidings had brought back to him the\nshattered bewildered feelings to which he dared not recur.\n\nTo dwell on the details was, to her, a comfort, knowing his sympathy and\nthe affection there had been between him and her father; nor had they\nparted in such absolute brightness, as to make them unprepared for such\na meeting as the present. The cloud of suspense was brooding lower and\nlower over the May family, and the need of faith and submission was as\ngreat with them as with the young orphan herself. Norman said little,\nbut that little was so deep and fervent, that after a time Meta could\nnot help saying, when Ethel was seen in the distance, and their talk was\nnearly over, “Oh, Norman, these things are no mirage!”\n\n“It is the world that is the mirage,” he answered. Ethel came up, and\nDr. May also, in good time for the post. He was obliged to become very\nbusy, using Norman for his secretary, till he saw his son’s eyes so\nheavy, that he remembered the two nights that he had been up, and\nordered him to go home and go to bed as soon as tea was over.\n\n“May I come back to-morrow?”\n\n“Why--yes--I think you may. No, no,” he added, recollecting himself, “I\nthink you had better not,” and he did not relent, though Norman looked\ndisappointed.\n\nMeta had already expressed her belief that her father would be buried\nat the suburban church, where lay her mother; and Dr. May, having been\ndesired to seek out the will and open it, found it was so; and fixed\nthe day and hour with Meta, who was as submissive and reasonable as\npossible, though much grieved that he thought she could not be present.\n\nEthel, after going with Meta to her room at night, returned as usual to\ntalk matters over with him, and again say how good Meta was.\n\n“And I think Norman’s coming did her a great deal of good,” said Ethel.\n\n“Ha! yes,” said the doctor thoughtfully.\n\n“She thinks so much of Mr. Rivers having been fond of him.”\n\n“Yes,” said the doctor, “he was. I find, in glancing over the will,\nwhich was newly made on Flora’s marriage, that he has remembered\nNorman--left him £100 and his portfolio of prints by Raffaelle.”\n\n“Has he, indeed?--how very kind, how much Norman will value it.”\n\n“It is remarkable,” said Dr. May; and then, as if he could not help it,\ntold Ethel what Mr. Rivers had said of his wishes with regard to his\ndaughter. Ethel blushed and smiled, and looked so much touched and\ndelighted, that he grew alarmed and said, “You know, Ethel, this must be\nas if it never had been mentioned.”\n\n“What! you will not tell Norman?”\n\n“No, certainly not, unless I see strong cause. They are very fond of\neach other, certainly, but they don’t know, and I don’t know, whether it\nis not like brother and sister. I would not have either of them guess\nat this, or feel bound in any way. Why, Ethel, she has thirty thousand\npounds, and I don’t know how much more.”\n\n“Thirty thousand!” said Ethel, her tone one of astonishment, while his\nhad been almost of objection.\n\n“It would open a great prospect,” continued Dr. May complacently; “with\nNorman’s talents, and such a lift as that, he might be one of the first\nmen in England, provided he had nerve and hardness enough, which I\ndoubt.”\n\n“He would not care for it,” said Ethel.\n\n“No; but the field of usefulness; but what an old fool I am, after all\nmy resolutions not to be ambitious for that boy; to be set a-going by\nsuch a thing as this! Still Norman is something out of the common way. I\nwonder what Spencer thinks of him.”\n\n“And you never mean them to hear of it?”\n\n“If they settle it for themselves,” said Dr. May, “that sanction will\ncome in to give double value to mine; or if I should see poor Norman\nhesitating as to the inequality, I might smooth the way; but you see,\nEthel, this puts us in a most delicate situation towards this pretty\nlittle creature. What her father wanted was only to guard her from\nfortune-hunters, and if she should marry suitably elsewhere--why, we\nwill be contented.”\n\n“I don’t think I should be,” said Ethel.\n\n“She is the most winning of humming-birds, and what we see of her now,\ngives one double confidence in her. She is so far from the petted,\nhelpless girl that he, poor man, would fain have made her! And she has\na bright, brave temper and elastic spirits that would be the very thing\nfor him, poor boy, with that morbid sensitiveness--he would not hurt\nher, and she would brighten him. It would be a very pretty thing--but we\nmust never think about it again.”\n\n“If we can help it,” said Ethel.\n\n“Ah! I am sorry I have put it into your head too. We shall not so easily\nbe unconscious now, when they talk about each other in the innocent way\nthey do. We have had a lesson against being pleased at match-making!”\n But, turning away from the subject, “You shall not lose your Cocksmoor\nincome, Ethel--”\n\n“I had never thought of that. You have taken no fees here since we have\nbeen all one family.”\n\n“Well, he has been good enough to leave me £500, and Cocksmoor can have\nthe interest, if you like.”\n\n“Oh, thank you, papa.”\n\n“It is only its due, for I suppose that is for attendance. Personally,\nto myself, he has left that beautiful Claude which he knew I admired so\nmuch. He has been very kind! But, after all, we ought not to be talking\nof all this--I should not have known it, if I had not been forced to\nread the will. Well, so we are in Flora’s house, Ethel! I wonder how\npoor dear little Meta will feel the being a guest here, instead of the\nmistress. I wish that boy were three or four years older! I should\nlike to take her straight home with us--I should like to have her for a\ndaughter. I shall always look on her as one.”\n\n“As a Daisy!” said Ethel.\n\n“Don’t talk of it!” said Dr. May hastily; “this is no time for such\nthings. After all, I am glad that the funeral is not here--Flora and\nMeta might be rather overwhelmed with these three incongruous sets of\nrelations. By their letters, those Riverses must be quite as queer a\nlot as George’s relations. After all, if we have nothing else, Ethel, we\nhave the best of it, in regard to such relations as we have.”\n\n“There is Lord Cosham,” said Ethel.\n\n“Yes, he is Meta’s guardian, as well as her brother; but he could not\nhave her to live with him. She must depend upon Flora. But we shall\nsee.”\n\nEthel felt confident that Flora would be very kind to her little\nsister-in-law, and yet one of those gleams of doubt crossed her, whether\nFlora would not be somewhat jealous of her own authority.\n\nLate the next evening, the carriage drove to the door, and George and\nFlora appeared in the hall. Their sisters went out to meet them, and\nGeorge folded Meta in his arms, and kissing her again and again, called\nher his poor dear little sister, and wept bitterly, and even violently.\nFlora stood beside Ethel, and said, in a low voice, that poor George\nfelt it dreadfully; and then came forward, touched him gently, and told\nhim that he must not overset Meta; and, drawing her from him, kissed\nher, and said what a grievous time this had been for her, and how sorry\nthey had been to leave her so long, but they knew she was in the best\nhands.\n\n“Yes, I should have been so sorry you had been over-tired. I was quite\nwell off,” said Meta.\n\n“And you must look on us as your home,” added Flora.\n\n“How can she?” thought Ethel. “This is taking possession, and making\nMeta a guest already!”\n\nHowever, Meta did not seem so to feel it--she replied by caresses, and\nturned again to her brother. Poor George was by far the most struck down\nof all the mourners, and his whole demeanour gave his new relations\na much warmer feeling towards him than they could ever have hoped to\nentertain. His gentle refined father had softly impressed his duller\nnature; and his want of attention and many extravagances came back upon\nhim acutely now, in his changed home. He could hardly bear to look at\nhis little orphan sister, and lavished every mark of fondness upon her;\nnor could he endure to sit at the bottom of his table; but when they had\ngone in to dinner, he turned away from the chair and hid his face. He\nwas almost like a child in his want of self-restraint; and with all Dr.\nMay’s kind soothing manner, he could not bring him to attend to any of\nthe necessary questions as to arrangements, and was obliged to refer to\nFlora, whose composed good sense was never at fault.\n\nEthel was surprised to find that it would be a great distress to Meta\nto part with her until the funeral was over, though she would hardly\nexpress a wish lest Ethel should be needed at home. As soon as Flora\nperceived this, she begged her sister to stay, and again Ethel felt\nunpleasantly that Meta might have seen, if she had chosen, that Flora\ntook the invitation upon herself.\n\nSo, while Dr. May, with George, Norman, and Tom, went to London, she\nremained, though not exactly knowing what good she was doing, unless by\nmaking the numbers rather less scanty; but both sisters declared her to\nbe the greatest comfort possible; and when Meta shut herself up in her\nown room, where she had long learned to seek strength in still communing\nwith her own heart, Flora seemed to find it a relief to call her sister\nto hers, and talk over ordinary subjects, in a tone that struck on\nEthel’s ear as a little incongruous--but then Flora had not been here\nfrom the first, and the impression could not be as strong. She was very\nkind, and her manner, when with others, was perfect, from its complete\nabsence of affectation; but, alone with Ethel, there was a little\ncomplacency sometimes betrayed, and some curiosity whether her father\nhad read the will. Ethel allowed what she had heard of the contents to\nbe extracted from her, and it certainly did not diminish Flora’s secret\nsatisfaction in being ‘somebody’.\n\nShe told the whole history of her visits; first, how cordial Lady\nLeonora Langdale had been, and then, how happy she had been at\nGlenbracken. The old Lord and Lady, and Marjorie, all equally charming\nin their various ways; and Norman Ogilvie so good a son, and so highly\nthought of in his own country.\n\n“Did I tell you, Ethel, that he desired to be remembered to you?”\n\n“Yes, you said so.”\n\n“What has Coralie done with it?” continued Flora, seeking in her\ndressing-case. “She must have put it away with my brooches. Oh, no, here\nit is. I had been looking for Cairngorm specimens in a shop, saying I\nwanted a brooch that you would wear, when Norman Ogilvie came riding\nafter the carriage, looking quite hot and eager. He had been to some\nother place, and hunted this one up. Is it not a beauty?”\n\nIt was one of the round Bruce brooches, of dark pebble, with a silver\nfern-leaf lying across it, the dots of small Cairngorm stones. “The\nGlenbracken badge, you know,” continued Flora.\n\nEthel twisted it about in her fingers, and said, “Was not it meant for\nyou?”\n\n“It was to oblige me, if you choose so to regard it,” said Flora,\nsmiling. “He gave me no injunctions; but, you see, you must wear it now.\nI shall not wear coloured brooches for a year.”\n\nEthel sighed. She felt as if her black dress ought, perhaps, to be worn\nfor a nearer cause. She had a great desire to keep that Glenbracken\nbrooch; and surely it could not be wrong. To refuse it would be much\nworse, and would only lead to Flora’s keeping it, and not caring for it.\n\n“Then it is your present, Flora?”\n\n“If you like better to call it so, my dear. I find Norman Ogilvie is\ngoing abroad in a few months. I think we ought to ask him here on his\nway.”\n\n“Flora, I wish you would not talk about such things!”\n\n“Do you really and truly, Ethel?”\n\n“Certainly not, at such a time as this,” said Ethel.\n\nFlora was checked a little, and sat down to write to Marjorie Ogilvie.\n“Shall I say you like the brooch, Ethel?” she asked presently.\n\n“Say what is proper,” said Ethel impatiently. “You know what I mean, in\nthe fullest sense of the word.”\n\n“Do I?” said Flora.\n\n“I mean,” said Ethel, “that you may say, simply and rationally, that I\nlike the thing, but I won’t have it said as a message, or that I take it\nas his present.”\n\n“Very well,” said Flora, “the whole affair is simple enough, if you\nwould not be so conscious, my dear.”\n\n“Flora, I can’t stand your calling me my dear!”\n\n“I am very much obliged to you,” said Flora, laughing, more than she\nwould have liked to be seen, but recalled by her sister’s look. Ethel\nwas sorry at once.\n\n“Flora, I beg your pardon; I did not mean to be cross, only please don’t\nbegin about that; indeed, I think you had better leave out about the\nbrooch altogether. No one will wonder at your passing it over in such a\nreturn as this.”\n\n“You are right,” said Flora thoughtfully.\n\nEthel carried the brooch to her own room, and tried to keep herself\nfrom speculating what had been Mr. Ogllvie’s views in procuring it, and\nwhether he remembered showing her, at Woodstock, which sort of fern was\nhis badge, and how she had abstained from preserving the piece shut up\nin her guide-book.\n\nMeta’s patient sorrow was the best remedy for proneness to such musings.\nHow happy poor little Meta had been! The three sisters sat together that\nlong day, and Ethel read to the others, and by and by went to walk in\nthe garden with them, till, as Flora was going in, Meta asked, “Do you\nthink it would be wrong for me to cross the park to see that little\nburned girl, as Mr. Wilmot is away to-day, and she has no one to go to\nher?”\n\nFlora could see no reason against it, and Meta and Ethel left the\ngarden, and traversed the green park, in its quiet home beauty, not\ntalking much, except that Meta said, “Well! I think there is quite as\nmuch sweetness as sadness in this evening.”\n\n“Because of this calm autumn sunset beauty?” said Ethel. “Look at the\ngolden light coming in under the branches of the trees.”\n\n“Yes,” said Meta, “one cannot help thinking how much more beautiful it\nmust be--”\n\nThe two girls said no more, and came to the cottage, where so much\ngratitude was expressed at seeing Miss Rivers, that it was almost too\nmuch for her. She left Ethel to talk, and only said a few soft little\nwords to her sick scholar, who seemed to want her voice and smile to\nconvince her that the small mournful face, under all that black crape,\nbelonged to her own dear bright teacher.\n\n“It is odd,” said Meta, as they went back; “it is seeing other people\nthat makes one know it is all sad and altered--it seems so bewildering,\nthough they are so kind.”\n\n“I know what you mean,” said Ethel.\n\n“One ought not to wish it to go on, because there are other people and\nother duties,” said Meta, “but quietness is so peaceful. Do you know,\nEthel, I shall always think of those two first days, before anybody\ncame, with you and Dr. May, as something very--very--precious,” she said\nat last, with the tears rising.\n\n“I am sure I shall,” said Ethel.\n\n“I don’t know how it is, but there is something even in this affliction\nthat makes it like--a strange sort of happiness,” said Meta musingly.\n\n“I know what it is!” said Ethel.\n\n“That He is so very good?” said Meta reverently.\n\n“Yes,” said Ethel, almost rebuked for the first thought, namely, that it\nwas because Meta was so very good.\n\n“It does make one feel more confidence,” said Meta.\n\n“‘It is good for me to have been in trouble,’” repeated Ethel.\n\n“Yes,” said Meta. “I hope it is not wrong or unkind in me to feel it,\nfor I think dear papa would wish it; but I do not feel as if--miss him\nalways as I shall--the spring of life were gone from me. I don’t think\nit can, for I know no more pain or trouble can reach him, and there\nis--don’t you think, Ethel, that I may think so?--especial care for the\norphan, like a compensation. And there is hope, and work here. And I am\nvery thankful! How much worse it would have been, if George had not been\nmarried! Dear Flora! Will you tell her, Ethel, how really I do wish her\nto take the command of me? Tell her it will be the greatest kindness in\nthe world to make me useful to her.”\n\n“I will,” said Ethel.\n\n“And please tell her that I am afraid I may forget, and take upon me, as\nif I were still lady of the house. Tell her I do not mean it, and I hope\nthat she will check it.”\n\n“I think there is no fear of her forgetting that,” said Ethel,\nregretting the words before they were out of her mouth.\n\n“I hope I shall not,” said Meta. “If I do, I shall drive myself away to\nstay with Aunt Leonora, and I don’t want to do that at all. So please\nto make Flora understand that she is head, and I am ready to be hand and\nfoot;” and Meta’s bright smile shone out, with the pleasure of a fresh\nand loving service.\n\nEthel understood the force of her father’s words, that it was a brave,\nvigorous spirit.\n\nDr. May came back with George, and stayed to dinner, after which he\ntalked over business with Flora, whose sagacity continually amazed\nhim, and who undertook to make her husband understand, and do what was\nneeded.\n\nMeta meanwhile cross-questioned her brother on the pretty village by the\nThames, of which she had a fond, childish remembrance, and heard from\nhim of the numerous kind messages from all her relations. There were\nvarious invitations, but George repeated them unwillingly.\n\n“You won’t go, Meta,” he said. “It would be a horrid nuisance to part\nwith you.”\n\n“As long as you think so, dear George. When I am in your way, or\nFlora’s--”\n\n“That will never be! I say, Flora, will she ever be in our way?”\n\n“No, indeed! Meta and I understand that,” said Flora, looking up. “Well,\nI suppose Bruce can’t be trusted to value the books and prints.”\n\nDr. May thought it a great relief that Meta had a home with Flora, for,\nas he said to Ethel as they went home together, “Certainly, except Lord\nCosham, I never saw such an unpresentable crew as their relations. You\nshould have heard the boys afterwards! There was Master Tom turning up\nhis Eton nose at them, and pronouncing that there never were such a\nset of snobs, and Norman taking him to task as I never heard him do\nbefore--telling him that he would never have urged his going to Eton,\nif he had thought it would make him despise respectable folks, probably\nbetter than himself, and that this was the last time in the world for\nsuch observations--whereat poor Tommy was quite annihilated; for a word\nfrom Norman goes further with him than a lecture from any one else.”\n\n“Well, I think Norman was right as to the unfitness of the time.”\n\n“So he was. But we had a good deal of them, waiting in the inn parlour.\nPeople make incongruities when they will have such things done in state.\nIt could not be helped here, to be sure; but I always feel, at a grand\nundertaker’s display like this, that, except the service itself, there\nis little to give peace or soothing. I hate what makes a talk! Better be\nlittle folk.”\n\n“One would rather think of our own dear cloister, and those who cared so\nmuch,” said Ethel.\n\n“Ah! you were happy to be there!” said Dr. May. “But it all comes to the\nsame.” Pausing, he looked from the window, then signed to Ethel to do\nthe same--Orion glittered in the darkness.\n\n“One may sleep sound without the lullaby,” said Dr. May, “and the\nwaves--”\n\n“Oh! don’t, papa. You don’t give up hope!”\n\n“I believe we ought, Ethel. Don’t tell her, but I went to the Admirality\nto-day.”\n\n“And what did you hear there?”\n\n“Great cause for fear--but they do not give up. My poor Margaret! But\nthose stars tell us they are in the same Hand.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n\n     Shall I sit alone in my chamber,\n       And set the chairs by the wall,\n     While you sit with lords and princes,\n       Yet have not a thought at all?\n\n     Shall I sit alone in my chamber,\n       And duly the table lay,\n     Whilst you stand up in the diet,\n       And have not a word to say?--Old Danish Ballad.\n\n\n“Oh, Norman, are you come already?” exclaimed Margaret, as her brother\nopened the door, bringing in with him the crisp breath of December.\n\n“Yes, I came away directly after collections. How are you, Margaret?”\n\n“Pretty brave, thank you;” but the brother and sister both read on each\nother’s features that the additional three months of suspense had told.\nThere were traces of toil and study on Norman’s brow; the sunken look\nabout his eyes, and the dejected outline of his cheek, Margaret knew\nbetokened discouragement; and though her mild serenity was not changed,\nshe was almost transparently thin and pale. They had long ago left off\nasking whether there were tidings, and seldom was the subject adverted\nto, though the whole family seemed to be living beneath a dark shadow.\n\n“How is Flora?” he next asked.\n\n“Going on beautifully, except that papa thinks she does too much in\nevery way. She declares that she shall bring the baby to show me in\nanother week, but I don’t think it will be allowed.”\n\n“And the little lady prospers?”\n\n“Capitally, though I get rather contradictory reports of her. First,\npapa declared her something surpassing--exactly like Flora, and so I\nsuppose she is; but Ethel and Meta will say nothing for her beauty, and\nBlanche calls her a fright. But papa is her devoted admirer--he does so\nenjoy having a sort of property again in a baby!”\n\n“And George Rivers?” said Norman, smiling.\n\n“Poor George! he is very proud of her in his own way. He has just been\nhere with a note from Flora, and actually talked! Between her and the\nelection, he is wonderfully brilliant.”\n\n“The election? Has Mr. Esdaile resigned?”\n\n“Have you not heard? He intends it, and George himself is going to\nstand. The only danger is that Sir Henry Walkinghame should think of\nit.”\n\n“Rivers in Parliament! Well, sound men are wanted.”\n\n“Fancy Flora, our member’s wife. How well she will become her position.”\n\n“How soon is it likely to be?”\n\n“Quickly, I fancy. Dr. Spencer, who knows all kinds of news (papa says\nhe makes a scientific study of gossip, as a new branch of comparative\nanatomy), found out from the Clevelands that Mr. Esdaile meant to\nretire, and happened to mention it the last time that Flora came to see\nme. It was like firing a train. You would have wondered to see how it\nexcited her, who usually shows her feelings so little. She has been so\nmuch occupied with it, and so anxious that George should be ready to\ntake the field at once, that papa was afraid of its hurting her, and\nEthel comes home declaring that the election is more to her than her\nbaby.”\n\n“Ethel is apt to be a little hard on Flora. They are too unlike to\nunderstand each other.”\n\n“Ethel is to be godmother though, and Flora means to ask Mr. Ogilvie to\ncome and stand.”\n\n“I think he will be gone abroad, or I should have asked him to fulfil\nhis old promise of coming to us.”\n\n“I believe he must be lodged here, if he should come. Flora will have\nher house full, for Lady Leonora is coming. The baby is to be called\nafter her.”\n\n“Indeed!” exclaimed Norman.\n\n“Yes; I thought it unnecessary, as she is not George’s aunt, but Flora\nis grateful to her for much kindness, and she is coming to see Meta. I\nam afraid papa is a little hurt, that any name but one should have been\nchosen.”\n\n“Has Meta been comfortable?”\n\n“Dear little thing! Every one says how beautifully she has behaved. She\nbrought all her housekeeping books to Flora at once, and only begged to\nbe made helpful in whatever way might be most convenient. She explained,\nwhat we never knew before, how she had the young maids in to read with\nher, and asked leave to go on. Very few could have been set aside so\nsimply and sweetly in their own house.”\n\n“Flora was sensible of it, I hope.”\n\n“Oh, yes. She took the management of course, but Meta is charmed with\nher having the girls in from the village, in turn, to help in the\nscullery. They have begun family prayers too, and George makes the\nstablemen go to church--a matter which had been past Meta, as you may\nguess, though she had been a wonderful little manager, and Flora owned\nherself quite astonished.”\n\n“I wonder only at her being astonished.”\n\n“Meta owned to Ethel that what had been worst of all to her was the\nheart sinking, at finding herself able to choose her occupations, with\nno one to accommodate them to. But she would not give way--she set up\nmore work for herself at the school, and has been talking of giving\nsinging lessons at Cocksmoor; and she forced herself to read, though it\nwas an effort. She has been very happy lately in nursing Flora.”\n\n“Is Ethel there?”\n\n“No; she is, as usual, at Cocksmoor. There are great councils about\nsending Cherry to be trained for her new school.”\n\n“Would Flora be able to see me, if I were to ride over to the Grange?”\n\n“You may try; and, if papa is not there, I dare say she will.”\n\n“At least, I shall see Meta, and she may judge. I want to see Rivers\ntoo, so I will ask if the bay is to be had. Ah! you have the Claude, I\nsee.”\n\n“Yes, it is too large for this room; but papa put it here that I might\nenjoy it, and it is almost a companion. The sky improves so in the\nsunset light.”\n\nNorman was soon at Abbotstoke; and, as he drew his rein, Meta’s bright\nface nodded to him from Flora’s sitting-room window; and, as he passed\nthe conservatory, the little person met him, with a summons, at once, to\nhis sister.\n\nHe found Flora on the sofa, with a table beside her, covered with notes\nand papers. She was sitting up writing; and, though somewhat pale, was\nvery smiling and animated.\n\n“Norman, how kind to come to me the first thing!”\n\n“Margaret encouraged me to try whether you would be visible.”\n\n“They want to make a regular prisoner of me,” said Flora, laughing.\n“Papa is as bad as the old nurse! But he has not been here to-day, so I\nhave had my own way. Did you meet George?”\n\n“No; but Margaret said he had been with her.”\n\n“I wish he would come. We expect the second post to bring the news that\nMr. Esdaile has accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. If he found it so, he\nmeant to go and talk to Mr. Bramshaw; for, though he is so dull, we must\nmake him agent.”\n\n“Is there any danger of opposition?”\n\n“None at all, if we are soon enough in the field. Papa’s name will\nsecure us, and there is no one else on the right side to come forward,\nso that it is an absolute rescue of the seat.”\n\n“It is the very moment when men of principle are most wanted,” said\nNorman. “The questions of the day are no light matters; and it is an\nimmense point to save Stoneborough from being represented by one of the\nTomkins’ set.”\n\n“Exactly so,” said Flora. “I should feel it a crime to say one word to\ndeter George, at a time when every effort must be made to support the\nright cause. One must make sacrifices when the highest interests are at\nstake.”\n\nFlora seemed to thrive upon her sacrifice--she had never appeared more\nbrilliant and joyous. Her brother saw, in her, a Roman matron; and the\nambition that was inherent in his nature, began to find compensation for\nbeing crushed, as far as regarded himself, by soaring for another. He\neagerly answered that he fully agreed with her, and that she would never\nrepent urging her husband to take on himself the duties incumbent on all\nwho had the power.\n\nHighly gratified, she asked him to look at a copy of George’s intended\naddress, which was lying on the table. He approved of the tenor, but\nsaw a few phrases susceptible of a better point. “Give it,” she said,\nputting a pen into his hand; and he began to interline and erase her\nfair manuscript, talking earnestly, and working up himself and the\naddress at the same time, till it had grown into a composition far\nsuperior to the merely sensible affair it had been. Eloquence and\nthought were now in the language, and substance--and Flora was\ndelighted.\n\n“I have been very disrespectful to my niece all this time,” said Norman,\ndescending from the clouds of patriotism.\n\n“I do not mean to inflict her mercilessly on her relations,” said Flora,\n“but I should like you to see her. She is so like Blanche.”\n\nThe little girl was brought in, and Flora made a very pretty young\nmother, as she held her in her arms, with so much graceful pride. Norman\nwas perfectly entranced--he had never seen his sister so charming or so\nadmirable, between her delight in her infant, and her self-devotion to\nthe good of her husband and her country--acting so wisely, and speaking\nso considerately; and praising her dear Meta with so much warmth. He\nwould never have torn himself away, had not the nurse hinted that Mrs.\nRivers had had too much excitement and fatigue already to-day; and,\nbesides, he suspected that he might find Meta in the drawing-room, where\nhe might discuss the whole with her, and judge for himself of her state\nof spirits.\n\nFlora’s next visitor was her father, who came as the twilight was\nenhancing the comfortable red brightness of the fire. He was very happy\nin these visits--mother and child had both prospered so well, and it was\nquite a treat to be able to expend his tenderness on Flora. His little\ngrandchild seemed to renew his own happy days, and he delighted to take\nher from her mother and fondle her. No sooner was the baby in his arms\nthan Flora’s hands were busy among the papers, and she begged him to\nring for lights.\n\n“Not yet,” he said. “Why can’t you sit in the dark, and give yourself a\nlittle rest?”\n\n“I want you to hear George’s address. Norman has been looking at it, and\nI hope you will not think it too strong,” and she turned, so that the\nlight might fall on the paper.\n\n“Let me see,” said Dr. May, holding out his hand for it.\n\n“This is a rough copy, too much scratched for you to make out.”\n\nShe read it accordingly, and her father admired it exceedingly--Norman’s\ntouches, above all; and Flora’s reading had dovetailed all so neatly\ntogether that no one knew where the joins were. “I will copy it fairly,”\n she said, “if you will show it to Dr. Spencer, and ask whether he thinks\nit too strong. Mr. Dodsley too; he would be more gratified if he saw it\nfirst, in private, and thought himself consulted.”\n\nDr. May was dismayed at seeing her take up her pen, make a desk of her\nblotting-book, and begin her copy by firelight.\n\n“Flora, my dear,” he said, “this must not be. Have I not told you that\nyou must be content to rest?”\n\n“I did not get up till ten o’clock, and have been lying here ever\nsince.”\n\n“But what has this head of yours been doing? Has it been resting for ten\nminutes together? Now I know what I am saying, Flora--I warn you, that\nif you will not give yourself needful quiet now, you will suffer for it\nby and by.”\n\nFlora smiled, and said, “I thought I had been very good. But, what is to\nbe done when one’s wits will work, and there is work for them to do?”\n\n“Is not there work enough for them here?” said Dr. May, looking at the\nbabe. “Your mother used to value such a retirement from care.”\n\nFlora was silent for a minute, then said, “Mr. Esdaile should have\nput off his resignation to suit me. It is an unfortunate time for the\nelection.”\n\n“And you can’t let the election alone?”\n\nShe shook her head, and smiled a negative, as if she would, but that she\nwas under a necessity.\n\n“My dear, if the election cannot go on without you, it had better not go\non at all.”\n\nShe looked very much hurt, and turned away her head.\n\nHer father was grieved. “My dear,” he added, “I know you desire to be of\nuse, especially to George; but do you not believe that he would rather\nfail, than that you, or his child, should suffer?”\n\nNo answer.\n\n“Does he stand by his own wish, or yours, Flora?”\n\n“He wishes it. It is his duty,” said Flora, collecting her dignity.\n\n“I can say no more, except to beg him not to let you exert yourself.”\n\nAccordingly, when George came home, the doctor read him a lecture on his\nwife’s over-busy brain; and was listened to, as usual, with gratitude\nand deference. He professed that he only wished to do what was best for\nher, but she never would spare herself; and, going to her side, with his\nheavy, fond solicitude, he made her promise not to hurt herself, and she\nlaughed and consented.\n\nThe promise was easily given, for she did not believe she was hurting\nherself; and, as to giving up the election, or ceasing secretly to\nprompt George, that was absolutely out of the question. What could be a\ngreater duty than to incite her husband to usefulness?\n\nMoreover it was but proper to invite Meta’s aunt and cousin to see\nher, and to project a few select dinners for their amusement and the\ngratification of her neighbours. It was only grateful and cousinly\nlikewise, to ask the “Master of Glenbracken”; and as she saw the\nthrill of colour on Ethel’s cheeks, at the sight of the address to the\nHonourable Norman Ogilvie, she thought herself the best of sisters. She\neven talked of Ogilvie as a second Christian name, but Meta observed\nthat old Aunt Dorothy would call it Leonorar Rogilvie Rivers, and thus\naverted it, somewhat to Ethel’s satisfaction.\n\nEthel scolded herself many times for wondering whether Mr. Ogilvie would\ncome. What was it to her? Suppose he should; suppose the rest. What a\npredicament! How unreasonable and conceited, even to think of such a\nthing, when her mind was made up. What could result, save tossings to\nand fro, a passing gratification set against infinite pain, and strife\nwith her own heart and with her father’s unselfishness! Had he but come\nbefore Flora’s marriage! No; Ethel hated herself for the wish that arose\nfor the moment. Far better he should keep away, if, perhaps, without the\nslightest inclination towards her, his mere name could stir up such a\ntumult--all, it might be, founded in vanity. Rebellious feelings and\nsense of tedium had once been subdued--why should they be roused again?\n\nThe answer came. Norman Ogilvie was setting off for Italy, and regretted\nthat he could not take Abbotstoke on his way. He desired his kind\nremembrances and warm Christmas wishes to all his cousins.\n\nIf Ethel breathed more freely, there was a sense that tranquillity is\nuninteresting. It was, it must be confessed, a flat end to a romance,\nthat all the permanent present effect was a certain softening, and a\ndegree more attention to her appearance; and after all, this might, as\nFlora averred, be ascribed to the Paris outfit having taught her to wear\nclothes; as well as to that which had awakened the feminine element, and\nremoved that sense of not being like other women, which sometimes hangs\npainfully about girls who have learned to think themselves plain or\nawkward.\n\nThere were other causes why it should be a dreary winter to Ethel, under\nthe anxiety that strengthened by duration, and the strain of acting\ncheerfulness for Margaret’s sake. Even Mary was a care. Her round rosy\nchildhood had worn into height and sallowness, and her languor and\nindifference fretted Miss Bracy, and was hunted down by Ethel, till\nMargaret convinced her that it was a case for patience and tenderness,\nwhich, thenceforth, she heartily gave, even encountering a scene\nwith Miss Bracy, who was much injured by the suggestion that Mary was\noppressed by perspective. Poor Mary, no one guessed the tears nightly\nshed over Harry’s photograph.\n\nNor could Ethel quite fathom Norman. He wore the dispirited, burdened\nexpression that she knew too well, but he would not, as formerly, seek\nrelief in confidence to her, shunning the being alone with her, and far\ntoo much occupied to offer to walk to Cocksmoor. When the intelligence\ncame that good old Mr. Wilmot of Settlesham had peacefully gone to his\nrest, after a short and painless illness, Tom was a good deal affected,\nin his peculiar silent and ungracious fashion; but Norman did not seek\nto talk over the event, and the feelings he had entertained two years\nago--he avoided the subject, and threw himself into the election matters\nwith an excitement foreign to his nature.\n\nHe was almost always at Abbotstoke, or attending George Rivers at the\ncommittee-room at the Swan, talking, writing, or consulting, concocting\nsquibs, and perpetrating bons mots, that were the delight of friends and\nthe confusion of foes. Flora was delighted, George adored him, Meta’s\neyes danced whenever he came near, Dr. Spencer admired him, and Dr.\nHoxton prophesied great things of him; but Ethel did not feel as if he\nwere the veritable Norman, and had an undefined sensation of discomfort,\nwhen she heard his brilliant repartees, and the laughter with which he\naccompanied them, so unlike his natural rare and noiseless laugh. She\nknew it was false excitement, to drive away the suspense that none dared\nto avow, but which did not press on them the less heavily for being\nendured in silence. Indeed, Dr. May could not help now and then giving\nway to outbursts of despondency, of which his friend, Dr. Spencer, who\nmade it his special charge to try to lighten his troubles, was usually\nthe kind recipient.\n\nAnd though the bustle of the election was incongruous, and seemed to\nmake the leaden weight the more heavy, there was a compensation in\nthe tone of feeling that it elicited, which gave real and heartfelt\npleasure.\n\nDr. May had undergone numerous fluctuations of popularity. He had always\nbeen the same man, excellent in intention, though hasty in action, and\nheeding neither praise nor censure; and while the main tenor of his\ncourse never varied, making many deviations by flying to the reverse\nof the wrong, most immediately before him, still his personal character\ngained esteem every year; and though sometimes his merits, and sometimes\nhis failings, gave violent umbrage, he had steadily risen in the\nestimation of his fellow-townsmen, as much as his own inconsistencies\nand theirs would allow, and every now and then was the favourite with\nall, save with the few who abused him for tyranny, because he prevented\nthem from tyrannising.\n\nHe was just now on the top of the wave, and his son-in-law had nothing\nto do but to float in on the tide of his favour. The opposite faction\nattempted a contest, but only rendered the triumph more complete,\nand gave the gentlemen the pleasure of canvassing, and hearing, times\nwithout number, that the constituents only wished the candidate were\nDr. May himself. His sons and daughters were full of exultation--Dr.\nSpencer, much struck, rallied “Dick” on his influence--and Dr. May, the\ndrops of warm emotion trembling on his eyelashes, smiled, and bade his\nfriend see him making a church-rate.\n\nThe addresses and letters that came from the Grange were so admirable,\nthat Dr. May often embraced Norman’s steady opinion that George was\na very wise man. If Norman was unconscious how much he contributed\nto these compositions, he knew far less how much was Flora’s. In his\nardour, he crammed them both, and conducted George when Flora could not\nbe at his side. George himself was a personable man, wrote a good\nbold hand, would do as he was desired, and was not easily put out of\ncountenance; he seldom committed himself by talking; and when a speech\nwas required, was brief, and to the purpose. He made a very good figure,\nand in the glory of victory, Ethel herself began to grow proud of him,\nand the children’s great object in life was to make the jackdaws cry,\n“Rivers for ever!”\n\nFlora had always declared that she would be at Stoneborough for the\nnomination. No one believed her, until three days before, she presented\nherself and her daughter before the astonished Margaret, who was\ntoo much delighted to be able to scold. She had come away on her own\nresponsibility, and was full of triumph. To come home in this manner,\nafter having read “Rivers for ever!” on all the dead walls, might be\ncalled that for which she had lived. She made no stay--she had only\ncome to show her child, and establish a precedent for driving out, and\nMargaret had begun to believe the apparition a dream, when the others\ncame in, some from Cocksmoor, others from the committee-room at the\nSwan.\n\n“So she brought the baby,” exclaimed Ethel. “I should have thought she\nwould not have taken her out before her christening.”\n\n“Ethel,” said Dr. Spencer, “permit me to make a suggestion. When\nrelations live in the same neighbourhood, there is no phrase to be more\navoided than ‘I should have thought--’”\n\nThe nomination-day brought Flora, Meta, baby and all to be very quiet,\nas was said; but how could that be? when every boy in the house was\nfrantic, and the men scarcely less so. Aubrey and Gertrude, and the two\njackdaws, each had a huge blue and orange rosette, and the two former\nwent about roaring “Rivers for ever!” without the least consideration\nfor the baby, who would have been decked in the same manner, if Ethel\nwould have heard of it without indignation, at her wearing any colour\nbefore her christening white; as to Jack and Jill, though they could\nsay their lesson, they were too much distressed by their ornaments to do\nought but lurk in corners, and strive to peck them off.\n\nFlora comported herself in her usual quiet way, and tried to talk of\nother things, though a carnation spot in each cheek showed her anxiety\nand excitement. She went with her sisters to look out from Dr. Spencer’s\nwindows towards the Town Hall. Her husband gave her his arm as they\nwent down the garden, and Ethel saw her talking earnestly to him, and\npressing his arm with her other hand to enforce her words, but if she\ndid tutor him, it was hardly visible, and he was very glad of whatever\ncounsel she gave.\n\nShe spoke not a word after the ladies were left with Aubrey, who was in\ndespair at not being allowed to follow Hector and Tom, but was left, as\nhis prematurely classical mind expressed it, like the Gaulish women with\nthe impedimenta in the marshes--whereas Tom had added insult to injury,\nby a farewell to “Jack among the maidens.”\n\nMeta tried to console him, by persuading him that he was their\nprotector, and he began to think there was need of a guard, when a\nmighty cheer caused him to take refuge behind Ethel. Even when assured\nthat it was anything but terrific, he gravely declared that he thought\nMargaret would want him, but he could not cross the garden without Meta\nto protect him.\n\nShe would not allow any one else to relieve her from the doughty\nchampion, and thereby she missed the spectacle. It might be that she did\nnot regret it, for though it would have been unkind to refuse to come in\nwith her brother and sister, her wound was still too fresh for crowds,\nturmoil, and noisy rejoicing to be congenial. She did not withdraw her\nhand, which Aubrey squeezed harder at each resounding shout, nor object\nto his conducting her to see his museum in the dark corner of the\nattics, most remote from the tumult.\n\nThe loss was not great. The others could hear nothing distinctly, and\nsee only a wilderness of heads; but the triumph was complete. Dr. May\nhad been cheered enough to satisfy even Hector; George Rivers had made\na very fair speech, and hurrahs had covered all deficiencies; Hector had\nshouted till he was as hoarse as the jackdaws; the opposite candidate\nhad never come forward at all; Tomkins was hiding his diminished head;\nand the gentlemen had nothing to report but success, and were in the\nhighest spirits.\n\nBy and by Blanche was missing, and Ethel, going in quest of her, spied\na hem of blue merino peeping out under all the cloaks in the hall\ncupboard, and found the poor little girl sobbing in such distress, that\nit was long before any explanation could be extracted, but at last it\nwas revealed--when the door had been shut, and they stood in the dark,\nhalf stifled among the cloaks, that George’s spirits had taken his old\nfacetious style with Blanche, and in the very hearing of Hector!\nThe misery of such jokes to a sensitive child, conscious of not\ncomprehending their scope, is incalculable, and Blanche having been a\nbaby-coquette, was the more susceptible. She hid her face again from the\nvery sound of her own confession, and resisted Ethel’s attempts to draw\nher out of the musty cupboard, declaring that she could never see either\nof them again. Ethel, in vain, assured her that George was gone to the\ndinner at the Swan; nothing was effectual but being told that for her\nto notice what had passed was the sure way to call Hector’s attention\nthereto, when she bridled, emerged, and begged to know whether she\nlooked as if she had been crying. Poor child, she could never again\nbe unconscious, but, at least, she was rendered peculiarly afraid of a\nstyle of notice, that might otherwise have been a temptation.\n\nEthel privately begged Flora to hint to George to alter his style of\nwit, and the suggestion was received better than the blundering manner\ndeserved; Flora was too exulting to take offence, and her patronage of\nall the world was as full-blown as her ladylike nature allowed. Ethel,\nshe did not attempt to patronise, but she promised all the sights\nin London to the children, and masters to Mary and Blanche, and she\nperfectly overwhelmed Miss Bracy with orphan asylums for her sisters.\nShe would have liked nothing better than dispersing cards, with Mrs.\nRivers prominent among the recommenders of the case.\n\n“A fine coming-out for you, little lady,” said she to her baby, when\ntaking leave that evening. “If it was good luck for you to make your\nfirst step in life upwards, what is this?”\n\n“Excelsior?” said Ethel, and Flora smiled, well pleased, but she had not\ncaught half the meaning. “May it be the right excelsior” added Ethel, in\na low voice that no one heard, and she was glad they did not. They were\nall triumphant, and she could not tell why she had a sense of sadness,\nand thought of Flora’s story long ago, of the girl who ascended Mont\nBlanc, and for what?\n\nAll she had to do at present was to listen to Miss Bracy, who was sure\nthat Mrs. Rivers thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and was\nafraid she was ungrateful for all the intended kindness to her sister.\n\nEthel had more sympathy here, for she had thought that Flora was giving\nherself airs, and she laughed and said her sister was pleased to be in\na position to help her friends; and tried to turn it off, but ended\nby stumbling into allowing that prosperity was apt to make people\nover-lavish of offers of kindness.\n\n“Dear Miss Ethel, you understand so perfectly. There is no one like\nyou!” cried Miss Bracy, attempting to kiss her hand.\n\nIf Ethel had not spoken rightly of her sister, she was sufficiently\npunished.\n\nWhat she did was to burst into a laugh, and exclaim, “Miss Bracy! Miss\nBracy! I can’t have you sentimental. I am the worst person in the world\nfor it.”\n\n“I have offended. You cannot feel with me!”\n\n“Yes, I can, when it is sense; but please don’t treat me like a heroine.\nI am sure there is quite enough in the world that is worrying, without\npicking shades of manner to pieces. It is the sure way to make an old\ncrab of me, and so I am going off. Only, one parting piece of advice,\nMiss Bracy--read ‘Frank Fairlegh’, and put everybody out of your head.”\n\nAnd, thinking she had been savage about her hand, Ethel turned back, and\nkissed the little governess’s forehead, wished her goodnight, and ran\naway.\n\nShe had learned that, to be rough and merry, was the best way of doing\nMiss Bracy good in the end; and so she often gave herself the present\npain of knowing that she was being supposed careless and hard-hearted;\nbut the violent affection for her proved that the feeling did not last.\n\nEthel was glad to sit by the fire at bed-time, and think over the day,\noutwardly so gay, inwardly so fretting and perplexing.\n\nIt was the first time that she had seen much of her little niece. She\nwas no great baby-handler, nor had she any of the phrases adapted to the\ninfant mind; but that pretty little serene blue-eyed girl had been her\nchief thought all day, and she was abashed by recollecting how little\nshe had dwelt on her own duties as her sponsor, in the agitations\nexcited by the doubts about her coadjutor.\n\nShe took out her Prayer-book, and read the Service for Baptism,\nrecollecting the thoughts that had accompanied her youngest sister’s\norphaned christening, “The vain pomp and glory of the world, and all\ncovetous desires of the same.” They seemed far enough off then, and\nnow--poor little Leonora!\n\nEthel knew that she judged her sister hardly; yet she could not help\npicturing to herself the future--a young lady, trained for fashionable\nlife, serious teaching not omitted, but right made the means of\nrising in the world; taught to strive secretly, but not openly, for\nadmiration--a scheming for her marriage--a career like Flora’s own.\nEthel could scarcely feel that it would not be a mockery to declare, on\nher behalf, that she renounced the world. But, alas! where was not the\nworld? Ethel blushed at having censured others, when, so lately, she had\nherself been oblivious of the higher duty. She thought of the prayer,\nincluding every Christian in holy and loving intercession--“I pray not\nthat Thou wouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou wouldest\nkeep them from the evil.”\n\n“Keep her from the evil--that shall be my prayer for my poor little\nLeonora. His grace can save her, were the surrounding evil far worse\nthan ever it is likely to be. The intermixture with good is the trial,\nand is it not so everywhere--ever since the world and the Church have\nseemed fused together? But she will soon be the child of a Father who\nguards His own; and, at least, I can pray for her, and her dear mother.\nMay I only live better, that so I may pray better, and act better, if\never I should have to act.”\n\nThere was a happy family gathering on the New Year’s Day, and Flora, who\nhad kindly felt her way with Meta, finding her not yet ready to enjoy\na public festivity for the village, added a supplement to the Christmas\nbeef, that a second dinner might be eaten at home, in honour of Miss\nLeonora Rivers.\n\nLady Leonora was highly satisfied with her visit, which impressed her\nfar more in favour of the Abbotstoke neighbourhood than in the days\nof poor old Mr. Rivers. Flora knew every one, and gave little select\ndinner-parties, which, by her good management, even George, at the\nbottom of the table, could not make heavy. Dr. Spencer enjoyed them\ngreatly, and was an unfailing resource for conversation; and as to the\nHoxtons, Flora felt herself amply repaying the kindness she had received\nin her young lady days, when she walked down to the dining-room with\nthe portly headmaster, or saw his good lady sit serenely admiring\nthe handsome rooms. “A very superior person, extremely pleasing and\nagreeable,” was the universal verdict on Mrs. Rivers. Lady Leonora\nstruck up a great friendship with her, and was delighted that she meant\nto take Meta to London. The only fault that could be found with her was\nthat she had so many brothers; and Flora, recollecting that her ladyship\nmistrusted those brothers, avoided encouraging their presence at the\nGrange, and took every precaution against any opening for the suspicion\nthat she threw them in the way of her little sister-in-law.\n\nNor had Flora forgotten the Ladies’ Committee, or Cocksmoor. As to the\nmuses, they gave no trouble at all. Exemplary civilities about the chair\npassed between the Member’s lady and Mrs. Ledwich, ending in Flora’s\ninsisting that priority in office should prevail, feeling that she could\nwell afford to yield the post of honour, since anywhere she was the\nleader. She did not know how much more conformable the ladies had\nbeen ever since they had known Dr. Spencer’s opinion; and yet he only\nbelieved that they were grateful for good advice, and went about among\nthem, easy, good-natured, and utterly unconscious that for him sparkled\nMrs. Ledwich’s bugles, and for him waved every spinster’s ribbon, from\nMiss Rich down to Miss Boulder.\n\nThe point carried by their united influence was Charity Elwood’s being\nsent for six months’ finish at the Diocesan Training School; while a\nfavourite pupil-teacher from Abbotstoke took her place at Cocksmoor.\nDr. Spencer looked at the Training School, and talked Mrs. Ledwich into\nmagnanimous forgiveness of Mrs. Elwood. Cherry dreaded the ordeal, but\nshe was willing to do anything that was thought right, and likely to\nmake her fitter for her office.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n\n     ‘Twas a long doubt; we never heard\n       Exactly how the ship went down.--ARCHER GURNEY.\n\n\nThe tidings came at last, came when the heart-sickness of hope deferred\nhad faded into the worse heart-sickness of fear deferred, and when\nspirits had been fain to rebel, and declare that they would be almost\nglad to part with the hope that but kept alive despair.\n\nThe Christmas holidays had come to an end, and the home party were again\nalone, when early in the forenoon, there was a tap at the drawing-room\ndoor, and Dr. Spencer called, “Ethel, can you come and speak to me?”\n\nMargaret started as if those gentle tones had been a thunderclap. “Go!\ngo, Ethel,” she said, “don’t keep me waiting.”\n\nDr. Spencer stood in the hall with a newspaper in his hand. Ethel said,\n“Is it?” and he made a sorrowful gesture. “Both?” she asked.\n\n“Both,” he repeated. “The ship burned--the boat lost.”\n\n“Ethel, come!” hoarsely called Margaret.\n\n“Take it,” said Dr. Spencer, putting the paper into her hand; “I will\nwait.”\n\nShe obeyed. She could not speak, but kneeling down by her sister, they\nread the paragraph together; Ethel, with one eye on the words, the other\non Margaret.\n\nNo doubt was left. Captain Gordon had returned, and this was his\nofficial report. The names of the missing stood below, and the list\nbegan thus:--\n\n        Lieutenant A. H. Ernescliffe.\n        Mr. Charles Owen, Mate.\n        Mr. Harry May, Midshipman.\n\nThe Alcestis had taken fire on the 12th of April of the former year.\nThere had been much admirable conduct, and the intrepid coolness of Mr.\nErnescliffe was especially recorded. The boats had been put off without\nloss, but they were scantily provisioned, and the nearest land was far\ndistant. For five days the boats kept together, then followed a night\nof storms, and, when morning dawned, the second cutter, under command of\nMr. Ernescliffe, had disappeared. There could be no doubt that she had\nsunk, and the captain could only record his regrets for the loss the\nservice had experienced in the three brave young officers and their\ngallant seamen. After infinite toil and suffering, the captain, with the\nother boats’ crews, had reached Tahiti, whence they had made their way\nhome.\n\n“Oh, Margaret, Margaret!” cried Ethel.\n\nMargaret raised herself, and the colour came into her face.\n\n“I did not write the letter!” she said.\n\n“What letter?” said Ethel, alarmed.\n\n“Richard prevented me. The letter that would have parted us. Now all is\nwell.”\n\n“All is well, I know, if we could but feel it.”\n\n“He never had the pain. It is unbroken!” continued Margaret, her eyes\nbrightening, but her breath, in long-drawn gasps that terrified Ethel\ninto calling Dr. Spencer.\n\nMary was standing before him, with bloodless face and dilated eyes; but,\nas Ethel approached, she turned and rushed upstairs.\n\nDr. Spencer entered the drawing-room with Ethel, who tried to read his\nface as he saw Margaret--restored, as it seemed, to all her girlish\nbloom, and her eyes sparkling as they were lifted up, far beyond the\npresent scene. Ethel had a moment’s sense that his expression was as\nif he had seen a death-blow struck, but it was gone in a moment, as\nhe gently shook Margaret by the hand, and spoke a word of greeting, as\nthough to recall her.\n\n“Thank you,” she said, with her own grateful smile.\n\n“Where is your father?” he asked of Ethel.\n\n“Either at the hospital, or at Mr. Ramsden’s,” said Ethel, with a\nghastly suspicion that he thought Margaret in a state to require him.\n\n“Papa!” said Margaret. “If he were but here! But--ah! I had forgotten.”\n\nShe turned aside her head, and hid her face. Dr. Spencer signed Ethel\nnearer to him. “This is a more natural state,” he said. “Don’t be afraid\nfor her. I will find your father, and bring him home.” Pressing her hand\nhe departed.\n\nMargaret was weeping tranquilly--Ethel knelt down beside her, without\ndaring at first to speak, but sending up intense mental prayers to Him,\nwho alone could bear her or her dear father through their affliction.\nThen she ventured to take her hand, and Margaret returned the caress,\nbut began to blame herself for the momentary selfishness that had\nallowed her brother’s loss and her father’s grief to have been forgotten\nin her own. Ethel’s “oh! no! no!” did not console her for this which\nseemed the most present sorrow, but the flow of tears was so gentle,\nthat Ethel trusted that they were a relief. Ethel herself seemed only\nable to watch her, and to fear for her father, not to be able to think\nfor herself.\n\nThe front door opened, and they heard Dr. May’s step hesitating in the\nhall, as if he could not bear to come in.\n\n“Go to him!” cried Margaret, wiping off her tears. Ethel stood a moment\nin the doorway, then sprang to him, and was clasped in his arms.\n\n“You know it?” he whispered.\n\n“Dr. Spencer told us. Did not you meet him?”\n\n“No. I read it at Bramshaw’s office. How--” He could not say the words,\nbut he looked towards the room, and wrung the hand he held.\n\n“Quiet. Like herself. Come.”\n\nHe threw one arm round Ethel, and laid his hand on her head. “How much\nthere is to be thankful for!” he said, then advancing, he hung over\nMargaret, calling her his own poor darling.\n\n“Papa, you must forgive me. You said sending him to sea was giving him\nup.”\n\n“Did I. Well, Margaret, he did his duty. That is all we have to live\nfor. Our yellow-haired laddie made a gallant sailor, and--”\n\nTears choked his utterance--Margaret gently stroked his hand.\n\n“It falls hard on you, my poor girl,” he said.\n\n“No, papa,” said Margaret, “I am content and thankful. He is spared pain\nand perplexity.”\n\n“You are right, I believe,” said Dr. May. “He would have been grieved\nnot to find you better.”\n\n“I ought to grieve for my own selfishness,” said Margaret. “I cannot\nhelp it! I cannot be sorry the link is unbroken, and that he had not to\nturn to any one else.”\n\n“He never would!” cried Dr. May, almost angrily.\n\n“I tried to think he ought,” said Margaret. “His life would have been\ntoo dreary. But it is best as it is.”\n\n“It must be,” said the doctor. “Where are the rest, Ethel? Call them all\ndown.”\n\nPoor Mary, Ethel felt as if she had neglected her! She found her hanging\nover the nursery fire, alternating with old nurse in fond reminiscences\nof Harry’s old days, sometimes almost laughing at his pranks, then\ncrying again, while Aubrey sat between them, drinking in each word.\n\nBlanche and Gertrude came from the schoolroom, where Miss Bracy seemed\nto have been occupying them, with much kindness and judgment. She came\nto the door to ask Ethel anxiously for the doctor and Miss May, and\nlooked so affectionate and sympathising, that Ethel gave her a hearty\nkiss.\n\n“Dear Miss Ethel! if you can only let me help you.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Ethel with all her heart, and hurried away. Nothing\nwas more in favour of Miss Bracy, than that there should be a hurry.\nThen she could be warm, and not morbid.\n\nDr. May gathered his children round him, and took out the great\nPrayer-book. He read a psalm and a prayer from the Burial Service, and\nthe sentence for funerals at sea. Then he touched each of their heads,\nand, in short broken sentences, gave thanks for those still left to him,\nand for the blessed hope they could feel for those who were gone; and he\nprayed that they might so follow in their footsteps, as to come to the\nsame holy place, and in the meantime realise the Communion of Saints.\nThen they said the Lord’s Prayer, he blessed them, and they arose.\n\n“Mary, my dear,” he said, “you have a photograph.”\n\nShe put the case into his hands, and ran away.\n\nHe went to the study, where he found Dr. Spencer awaiting him.\n\n“I am only come to know where I shall go for you.”\n\n“Thank you, Spencer. Thank you for taking care of my poor girls.”\n\n“They took care of themselves. They have the secret of strength.”\n\n“They have--” He turned aside, and burst out, “Oh, Spencer! you have\nbeen spared a great deal. If you missed a great deal of joy, you have\nmissed almost as much sorrow!” And, covering his face, he let his grief\nhave a free course.\n\n“Dick! dear old Dick, you must bear up. Think what treasures you have\nleft.”\n\n“I do. I try to do so,” said poor Dr. May; “but, Spencer, you never saw\nmy yellow-haired laddie, with his lion look! He was the flower of them\nall! Not one of these other boys came near him in manliness, and with\nsuch a loving heart! An hour ago, I thought any certainty would be gain,\nbut now I would give a lifetime to have back the hope that I might see\nmy boy’s face again! Oh, Spencer! this is the first time I could rejoice\nthat his mother is not here!”\n\n“She would have been your comforter,” sighed his friend, as he felt his\ninability to contend with such grief.\n\n“There, I can be thankful,” Dr. May said, and he looked so. “She has\nhad her brave loving boy with her all this time, while we little\nthought--but there are others. My poor Margaret--”\n\n“Her patience must be blessed,” said Dr. Spencer. “I think she will be\nbetter. Now that the suspense no longer preys on her, there will be more\nrest.”\n\n“Rest,” repeated Dr. May, supporting his head on his hand; and, looking\nup dreamily--“there remaineth a rest--”\n\nThe large Bible lay beside him on the table, and Dr. Spencer thought\nthat he would find more rest there than in his words. Leaving him,\ntherefore, his friend went to undertake his day’s work, and learn, once\nmore, in the anxious inquiries and saddened countenances of the patients\nand their friends, how great an amount of love and sympathy that Dr. May\nhad won by his own warmth of heart. The patients seemed to forget their\ncomplaints in sighs for their kind doctor’s troubles; and the gouty\nMayor of Stoneborough kept Dr. Spencer half an hour to listen to his\nrecollections of the bright-faced boy’s droll tricks, and then to the\npraises of the whole May family, and especially of the mother.\n\nPoor Dr. Spencer! he heard her accident described so many times in the\ncourse of the day, that his visits were one course of shrinking and\nsuffering; and his only satisfaction was in knowing how his friend would\nbe cheered by hearing of the universal feeling for him and his children.\n\nEthel wrote letters to her brothers; and Dr. May added a few lines,\nbegging Richard to come home, if only for a few days. Margaret would\nnot be denied writing to Hector Ernescliffe, though she cried over her\nletter so much that her father could almost have taken her pen away; but\nshe said it did her good.\n\nWhen Flora came in the afternoon, Ethel was able to leave Margaret\nto her, and attend to Mary, with whom Miss Bracy’s kindness had been\ninefficacious. If she was cheered for a few minutes, some association,\neither with the past or the vanished future, soon set her off sobbing\nagain. “If I only knew where dear, dear Harry is lying,” she sobbed,\n“and that it had not been very bad indeed, I could bear it better.”\n\nThe ghastly uncertainty was too terrible for Ethel to have borne to\ncontemplate it. She knew that it would haunt their pillows, and she was\ntrying to nerve herself by faith.\n\n“Mary,” she said, “that is the worst; but, after all, God willed that\nwe should not know. We must bear it like His good children. It makes no\ndifferences to them now--”\n\n“I know,” said Mary, trying to check her sobs.\n\n“And, you know, we are all in the same keeping. The sea is a glorious\ngreat pure thing, you know, that man cannot hurt or defile. It seems to\nme,” said Ethel, looking up, “as if resting there was like being buried\nin our baptism-tide over again, till the great new birth. It must be the\nnext best place to a churchyard. Anywhere, they are as safe as among the\ndaisies in our own cloister.”\n\n“Say it again--what you said about the sea,” said Mary, more comforted\nthan if Ethel had been talking down to her.\n\nBy and by Ethel discovered that the sharpest trouble to the fond simple\ngirl was the deprivation of her precious photograph. It was like losing\nHarry over again, to go to bed without it, though she would not for the\nworld seem to grudge it to her father.\n\nEthel found an opportunity of telling him of this distress, and it\nalmost made him smile. “Poor Mary,” he said, “is she so fond of it? It\nis rather a libel than a likeness.”\n\n“Don’t say so to her, pray, papa. It is all the world to her. Three\nstrokes on paper would have been the same, if they had been called by\nhis name.”\n\n“Yes; a loving heart has eyes of its own, and she is a dear girl!”\n\nHe did not forget to restore the treasure with gratitude proportionate\nto what the loan had cost Mary. With a trembling voice, she proffered\nit to him for the whole day, and every day, if she might only have it at\nnight; and she even looked black when he did not accept the proposal.\n\n“It is exactly like--” said she.\n\n“It can’t help being so, in a certain sense,” he answered kindly, “but\nafter all, Mary dear, he did not pout out his chin in that way.”\n\nMary was somewhat mortified, but she valued her photograph more than\never, because no one else would admire it, except Daisy, whom she had\ntaught to regard it with unrivalled veneration.\n\nA letter soon arrived from Captain Gordon, giving a fuller account of\nthe loss of his ship, and of the conduct of his officers, speaking in\nthe highest terms of Alan Ernescliffe, for whom he said he mourned as\nfor his own son, and, with scarcely less warmth, of Harry, mentioning\nthe high esteem all had felt for the boy, and the good effect which\nthe influence of his high and truthful spirit had produced on the other\nyoungsters, who keenly regretted him.\n\nCaptain Gordon added that the will of the late Captain Ernescliffe had\nmade him guardian of his sons, and that he believed poor Alan had died\nintestate. He should therefore take upon himself the charge of young\nHector, and he warmly thanked Dr. May and his family for all the\nkindness that the lad had received.\n\nThough the loss of poor Hector’s visits was regretted, it was, on the\nwhole, a comforting letter, and would give still more comfort in future\ntime.\n\nRichard contrived to come home through Oxford and see Norman, whom he\nfound calm, and almost relieved by the cessation from suspense; not\ninclined, as his father had feared, to drown sorrow in labour,\nbut regarding his grief as an additional call to devote himself to\nministerial work. In fact, the blow had fallen when he first heard the\nrumour of danger, and could not recur with the same force.\n\nRichard was surprised to find that Margaret was less cast down than he\ncould have dared to hope. It did not seem like an affliction to her.\nHer countenance wore the same gentle smile, and she was as ready\nto participate in all that passed, finding sympathy for the little\npleasures of Aubrey and Gertrude, and delighting in Flora’s baby; as\nwell as going over Cocksmoor politics with a clearness and accuracy that\nastonished him, and asking questions about his parish and occupations,\nso as fully to enjoy his short visit, which she truly called the\ngreatest possible treat.\n\nIf it had not been for the momentary consternation that she had seen\nupon Dr. Spencer’s face, Ethel would have been perfectly satisfied;\nbut she could not help sometimes entertaining a dim fancy that this\ncomposure came from a sense that she was too near Alan to mourn for him.\nCould it be true that her frame was more wasted, that there was less\ncapability of exertion, that her hours became later in the morning, and\nthat her nights were more wakeful? Would she fade away? Ethel longed to\nknow what her father thought, but she could neither bear to inspire him\nwith the apprehension, nor to ask Dr. Spencer’s opinion, lest she should\nbe confirmed in her own.\n\nThe present affliction altered Dr. May more visibly than the death of\nhis wife, perhaps, because there was not the same need of exertion. If\nhe often rose high in faith and resignation, he would also sink very low\nunder the sense of bereavement and disappointment. Though Richard\nwas his stay, and Norman his pride, there was something in Harry more\ncongenial to his own temper, and he could not but be bowed down by the\nruin of such bright hopes. With all his real submission, he was weak,\nand gave way to outbursts of grief, for which he blamed himself as\nunthankful; and his whole demeanour was so saddened and depressed,\nthat Ethel and Dr. Spencer consulted mournfully over him, whenever they\nwalked to Cocksmoor together.\n\nThis was not as often as usual, though the walls of the school were\nrising, for Dr. Spencer had taken a large share of his friend’s work for\nthe present, and both physicians were much occupied by the condition of\nMr. Ramsden who was fast sinking, and, for some weeks, seemed only kept\nalive by their skill. The struggle ended at last, and his forty\nyears’ cure of Stoneborough was closed. It made Dr. May very sad--his\naffections had tendrils for anything that he had known from boyhood;\nand though he had often spoken strong words of the vicar, he now sat\nsorrowfully moralising and making excuses. “People in former times had\nnot so high an estimate of pastoral duty--poor Mr. Ramsden had not much\neducation--he was already old when better times came in--he might have\ndone better in a less difficult parish with better laity to support him,\netc.” Yet after all, he exclaimed with one of his impatient gestures,\n“Better have my Harry’s seventeen years than his sixty-seven!”\n\n“Better improve a talent than lay it by!” said Ethel.\n\n“Hush! Ethel. How do you know what he may have done? If he acted up to\nhis own standard, he did more than most of us.”\n\n“Which is best,” said Ethel, “a high standard, not acted up to, or a\nlower one fulfilled?”\n\n“I think it depends on the will,” said Margaret.\n\n“Some people are angry with those whose example would show that there is\na higher standard,” said Ethel.\n\n“And,” said Margaret, “some who have the high one set before them\ncontent themselves with knowing that it cannot be fully attained, and\nwill not try.”\n\n“The standard is the effect of early impression,” said Dr. May. “I\nshould be very sorry to think it could not be raised.”\n\n“Faithful in a little--” said Ethel. “I suppose all good people’s\nstandard is always going higher.”\n\n“As they comprehend more of absolute perfection,” said Margaret.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\n\n     The city’s golden spire it was,\n       When hope and health were strongest;\n     But now it is the churchyard grass,\n       We look upon the longest.--E. B. BROWNING.\n\n\nA disinclination for exertion or going into public hung upon Dr. May,\nbut he was obliged to rouse himself to attend the Town Council meeting,\nwhich was held a few days after the vicar’s funeral, to decide on the\nnext appointment. If it had depended on himself alone, his choice would\nhave been Mr. Edward Wilmot, whom the death of his good old father had\nuprooted from Settlesham; and the girls had much hope, but he was too\nmuch out of spirits to be sanguine. He said that he should only hear a\ngreat deal of offensive stuff from Tomkins the brewer; and that, in\nthe desire to displease nobody, the votes should settle down on some\nnonentity, was the best which was likely to happen. Thus, grumbling, he\nset off, and his daughters watched anxiously for his return. They saw\nhim come through the garden with a quick, light step, that made them\naugur well, and he entered the room with the corners of his mouth\nturning up. “I see,” said Ethel, “it is all right.”\n\n“They were going to have made a very absurd choice.”\n\n“But you prevented it? Who was it?”\n\n“Ah! I told you Master Ritchie was turning out a popular preacher.”\n\n“You don’t mean that they chose Richard!” cried Margaret breathlessly.\n\n“As sure as my name is Dick May, they did, every man of them, except\nTomkins, and even he held his tongue; I did not think it of them,” said\nthe doctor, almost overcome; “but there is much more goodness of heart\nin the world than one gives it credit for.”\n\nAnd good Dr. May was not one to give the least credit for all that was\nlike himself.\n\n“But it was Richard’s own doing,” he continued. “Those sermons made a\ngreat impression, and they love the boy, because he has grown up among\nthem. The old mayor waddled up to me, as I came in, telling me that they\nhad been talking it over, and they were unanimously agreed that they\ncould not have a parson they should like better than Mr. Richard.”\n\n“Good old Mr. Doddesley! I can see him!” cried Ethel.\n\n“I expected it so little, that I thought he meant some Richards; but no,\nhe said Mr. Richard May, if he had nothing better in view--they liked\nhim, and knew he was a very steady, good young gentleman, and if he took\nafter his fathers that went before him--and they thought we might like\nto have him settled near!”\n\n“How very kind!” said Margaret, as the tears came. “We shall love our\nown townsfolk better than ever!”\n\n“I always told you so, if you would but believe it. They have warm,\nsound hearts, every one of them! I declare, I did not know which way to\nlook, I was so sorry to disappoint them.”\n\n“Disappoint them!” cried Margaret, in consternation.\n\n“I was thinking,” said Ethel. “I do not believe Richard would think\nhimself equal to this place in such a state as it is. He is so\ndiffident.”\n\n“Yes,” said Dr. May, “if he were ten or twelve years older, it would be\nanother thing; but here, where everything is to be done, he would not\nbring weight or force enough. He would only work himself to death, for\nindividuals, without going to the root. Margaret, my darling, I am very\nsorry to have disappointed you so much--it would have been as great a\npleasure as we could have had in this world to have the lad here--”\n\n“And Cocksmoor,” sighed Ethel.\n\n“I shall be grateful all my life to those good people for thinking of\nit,” continued the doctor; “but look you here, it was my business to get\nthe best man chosen in my power and, though as to goodness, I\nbelieve the dear Ritchie has not many equals; I don’t think we can\nconscientiously say he would be, at present, the best vicar for\nStoneborough.”\n\nEthel would not say no, for fear she should pain Margaret.\n\n“Besides,” continued Dr. May, “after having staved off the sale of the\npresentation as a sin, it would hardly have been handsome to have let\nmy own son profit by it. It would have seemed as if we had our private\nends, when Richard helped poor old Mr. Ramsden.”\n\nMargaret owned this, and Ethel said Richard would be glad to be spared\nthe refusal.\n\n“I was sure of it. The poor fellow would have been perplexed between the\nright and consideration for us. A vicar here ought to carry things with\na high hand, and that is hardest to do at a man’s own home, especially\nfor a quiet lad like him.”\n\n“Yes, papa, it was quite right,” said Margaret, recovering herself; “it\nhas spared Richard a great deal.”\n\n“But are we to have Mr. Wilmot?” said Ethel. “Think of our not having\nheard!”\n\n“Ay. If they would not have had Wilmot, or a man of his calibre, perhaps\nI might have let them offer it to Richard. I almost wish I had. With\nhelp, and Ethel--”\n\n“No, no, papa,” said Margaret. “You are making me angry with myself for\nmy folly. It is much better for Richard himself, and for us all, as well\nas the town. Think how long we have wished for Mr. Wilmot!”\n\n“He will be in time for the opening of Cocksmoor school!” cried Ethel.\n“How did you manage it?”\n\n“I did not manage at all,” said the doctor. “I told them exactly my\nmind, that Richard was not old enough for such arduous work; and though\nno words could tell how obliged I was, if they asked me who was the best\nman for it I knew, I should say Edward Wilmot, and I thought he deserved\nsomething from us, for the work he did gratis, when he was second\nmaster. Tomkins growled a little, but, fortunately, no one was prepared\nwith another proposal, so they all came round, and the mayor is to write\nby this evening’s post, and so shall I. If we could only have given\nRichard a dozen more years!”\n\nMargaret was somewhat comforted to find that the sacrifice had cost her\nfather a good deal; she was always slightly jealous for Richard, and\nnow that Alan was gone, she clung to him more than ever. His soft calm\nmanner supported her more than any other human comforter, and she always\nyearned after him when absent, more than for all the other brothers; but\nher father’s decision had been too high-minded for her to dare to wish\nit recalled, and she could not but own that Richard would have had\nto undergo more toil and annoyance than perhaps his health would have\nendured.\n\nFlora had discontinued comments to her sisters on her father’s\nproceedings, finding that observations mortified Margaret, and did not\ntend to peace with Ethel; but she told her husband that she did not\nregret it much, for Richard would have exhausted his own income, and his\nfather’s likewise, in paying curates, and raising funds for charities.\nShe scarcely expected Mr. Edward Wilmot to accept the offer, aware as\nhe was, of the many disadvantages he should have to contend with, and\nunsuccessful as he had been in dealing with the Ladies’ Committee.\n\nHowever, Mr. Wilmot signified his thankful acceptance, and, in due time,\nhis familiar tap was heard at the drawing-room door, at tea-time, as if\nhe had just returned after the holidays. He was most gladly welcomed,\nand soon was installed in his own place, with his goddaughter, Mary,\nblushing with pleasure at pouring out his coffee.\n\n“Well, Ethel, how is Cocksmoor? How like old times!”\n\n“Oh,” cried Ethel, “we are so glad you will see the beginning of the\nschool!”\n\n“I hear you are finishing Cherry Elwood, too.”\n\n“Much against Ethel’s will,” said Margaret; “but we thought Cherry not\neasily spoiled. And Whitford school seems to be in very good order. Dr.\nSpencer went and had an inspection of it, and conferred with all the\nauthorities.”\n\n“Ah! we have a jewel of a parishioner for you,” said Dr. May. “I have\nsome hopes of Stoneborough now.”\n\nMr. Wilmot did not look too hopeful, but he smiled, and asked after\nGranny Hall, and the children.\n\n“Polly grew up quite civilised,” said Ethel. “She lives at Whitford,\nwith some very respectable people, and sends granny presents, which make\nher merrier than ever. Last time it was a bonnet, and Jenny persuaded\nher to go to church in it, though, she said, what she called the moon of\nit was too small.”\n\n“How do the people go on?”\n\n“I cannot say much for them. It is disheartening. We really have done\nnothing. So very few go to church regularly.”\n\n“None at all went in my time,” said Mr. Wilmot.\n\n“Elwood always goes,” said Mary, “and Taylor; yes, and Sam Hall, very\noften, and many of the women, in the evening, because they like to walk\nhome with the children.”\n\n“The children? the Sunday scholars?”\n\n“Oh, every one that is big enough comes to school now, here, on Sunday.\nIf only the teaching were better--”\n\n“Have you sent out any more pupils to service?”\n\n“Not many. There is Willie Brown, trying to be Dr. Spencer’s little\ngroom,” said Ethel.\n\n“But I am afraid it will take a great deal of the doctor’s patience to\ntrain him,” added Margaret.\n\n“It is hard,” said Dr. May. “He did it purely to oblige Ethel; and, I\ntell her, when he lames the pony, I shall expect her to buy another for\nhim, out of the Cocksmoor funds.”\n\nEthel and Mary broke out in a chorus of defence of Willie Brown.\n\n“There was Ben Wheeler,” said Mary, “who went to work in the quarries;\nand the men could not teach him to say bad words, because the young\nladies told him not.”\n\n“The young ladies have not quite done nothing,” said Dr. May, smiling.\n\n“These are only little stray things, and Cherry has done the chief of\nthem,” said Ethel. “Oh, it is grievously bad still,” she added,\nsighing. “Such want of truth, such ungoverned tongues and tempers, such\ngodlessness altogether! It is only surface-work, taming the children at\nschool, while they have such homes; and their parents, even if they do\ncome where they might learn better, are always liable to be upset, as\nthey call it--turned out of their places in church, and they will not\nrun the chance.”\n\n“The church must come to them,” said Mr. Wilmot. “Could the school be\nmade fit to be licensed for service.”\n\n“Ask our architect,” said Dr. May. “There can be little doubt.”\n\n“I have been settling that I must have a curate specially for\nCocksmoor,” said Mr. Wilmot. “Can you tell me of one, Ethel--or perhaps\nMargaret could?”\n\nMargaret could only smile faintly, for her heart was beating.\n\n“Seriously,” said Mr. Wilmot, turning to Dr. May, “do you think Richard\nwould come and help us here?”\n\n“This seems to be his destiny,” said the doctor, smiling, “only it\nwould not be fair to tell you, lest you should be jealous--that the Town\nCouncil had a great mind for him.”\n\nThe matter was explained, and Mr. Wilmot was a great deal more struck\nby Dr. May’s conduct than the good doctor thought it deserved. Every\none was only too glad that Richard should come as Cocksmoor curate; and,\nthough the stipend was very small--since Mr. Wilmot meant to have other\nassistance--yet, by living at home, it might be feasible.\n\nMargaret’s last words that night to Ethel were, “The last wish I had\ndared to make is granted!”\n\nMr. Wilmot wrote to Richard, who joyfully accepted his proposal,\nand engaged to come home as soon as his present rector could find a\nsubstitute.\n\nDr. Spencer was delighted, and, it appeared, had already had a view to\nsuch possibilities in designing the plan of the school.\n\nThe first good effect of Mr. Wilmot’s coming was, that Dr. Spencer\nwas cured of the vagrant habits of going to church at Abbotstoke or\nFordholm, that had greatly concerned his friend. Dr. May, who could\nnever get any answer from him except that he was not a Town Councillor,\nand, as to example, it was no way to set that to sleep through the\nsermon.\n\nTo say that Dr. May never slept under the new dynasty would be an\nover-statement, but slumber certainly prevailed in the minster to a far\nless degree than formerly. One cause might be that it was not shut up\nunaired from one Sunday to another, but that the chime of the bells\nwas no longer an extraordinary sound on a week-day. It was at first\npronounced that time could not be found for going to church on week-days\nwithout neglecting other things, but Mary, who had lately sat very loose\nto the schoolroom, began gradually to slip down to church whenever the\nservice was neither too early nor too late; and Gertrude was often found\ntrotting by her side--going to mamma, as the little Daisy called it,\nfrom some confusion between the church and the cloister, which Ethel was\nin no hurry to disturb.\n\nLectures in Lent filled the church a good deal, as much perhaps from the\nnovelty as from better motives, and altogether there was a renewal\nof energy in parish work. The poor had become so little accustomed to\npastoral care, that the doctors and the district visitors were obliged\nto report cases of sickness to the clergy, and vainly tried to rouse the\npeople to send of their own accord. However, the better leaven began\nto work, and, of course, there was a ferment, though less violent than\nEthel had expected.\n\nMr. Wilmot set more cautiously to work than he had done in his younger\ndays, and did not attack prejudices so openly, and he had an admirable\nassistant in Dr. Spencer. Every one respected the opinion of the\ntravelled doctor, and he had a courteous clever process of the reduction\nto the absurd, which seldom failed to tell, while it never gave offence.\nAs to the Ladies’ Committee, though there had been expressions of\ndismay, when the tidings of the appointment first went abroad, not one\nof the whole “Aonian choir” liked to dissent from Dr. Spencer, and he\ntalked them over, individually, into a most conformable state, merely by\ntaking their compliance for granted, and showing that he deemed it\nonly the natural state of things, that the vicar should reign over the\ncharities of the place.\n\nThe committee was not dissolved--that would have been an act of\nviolence--but it was henceforth subject to Mr. Wilmot, and he and his\ncurates undertook the religious instruction in the week, and chose the\nbooks--a state of affairs brought about with so much quietness, that\nEthel knew not whether Flora, Dr. Spencer, or Mr. Wilmot had been the\nchief mover.\n\nMrs. Ledwich was made treasurer of a new coal club, and Miss Rich keeper\nof the lending-library, occupations which delighted them greatly; and\nEthel was surprised to find how much unity of action was springing up,\nnow that the period was over, of each “doing right in her own eyes.”\n\n“In fact,” said Dr. Spencer, “when women have enough to do, they are\nperfectly tractable.”\n\nThe Cocksmoor accounts were Ethel’s chief anxiety. It seemed as if now\nthere might be a school-house, but with little income to depend upon,\nsince poor Alan Ernescliffe’s annual ten pounds was at an end. However,\nDr. May leaned over her as she was puzzling over her pounds, shillings,\nand pence, and laid a cheque upon her desk. She looked up in his face.\n“We must make Cocksmoor Harry’s heir,” he said.\n\nBy and by it appeared that Cocksmoor was not out of Hector Ernescliffe’s\nmind. The boy’s letters to Margaret had been brief, matter-of-fact, and\ndiscouraging, as long as the half-year lasted, and there was not much to\nbe gathered about him from Tom, on his return for the Easter holidays,\nbut soon poor Hector wrote a long dismal letter to Margaret.\n\nCaptain Gordon had taken him to Maplewood, where the recollection of his\nbrother, and the happy hopes with which they had taken possession, came\nthronging upon him. The house was forlorn, and the corner that had been\nunpacked for their reception, was as dreary a contrast to the bright\nhome at Stoneborough, as was the dry, stern captain, to the fatherly\nwarm-hearted doctor. Poor Hector had little or nothing to do, and the\npleasure of possession had not come yet; he had no companion of his own\nage, and bashfulness made him shrink with dislike from introduction to\nhis tenants and neighbours.\n\nThere was not an entertaining book in the house, he declared, and the\ncaptain snubbed him, if he bought anything he cared to read. The captain\nwas always at him to read musty old improving books, and talking about\nthe position he would occupy. The evenings were altogether unbearable,\nand if it were not for rabbit shooting now, and the half-year soon\nbeginning again, Hector declared he should be ready to cut and run, and\nleave Captain Gordon and Maplewood to each other--and very well matched\ntoo! He was nearly in a state of mind to imitate that unprecedented boy,\nwho wrote a letter to ‘The Times’, complaining of extra weeks.\n\nAs to Cocksmoor, Ethel must not think it forgotten; he had spoken to the\ncaptain about it, and the old wooden-head had gone and answered that it\nwas not incumbent on him, that Cocksmoor had no claims upon him, and he\ncould not make it up out of his allowance; for the old fellow would not\ngive him a farthing more than he had before, and had said that was too\nmuch.\n\nThere was a great blur over the words “wooden-head,” as if Hector had\nknown that Margaret would disapprove, and had tried to scratch it\nout. She wrote all the consolation in her power, and exhorted him\nto patience, apparently without much effect. She would not show his\nsubsequent letters, and the reading and answering them fatigued her so\nmuch, that Hector’s writing was an unwelcome sight at Stoneborough. Each\nletter, as Ethel said, seemed so much taken out of her, and she begged\nher not to think about them.\n\n“Nothing can do me much good or harm now,” said Margaret; and seeing\nEthel’s anxious looks, “Is it not my greatest comfort that Hector can\nstill treat me as his sister, or, if I can only be of any use in keeping\nhim patient? Only think of the danger of a boy, in his situation, being\nleft without sympathy!”\n\nThere was nothing more to be said. They all felt it was good for them\nthat the building at Cocksmoor gave full occupation to thoughts and\nconversation; indeed, Tom declared they never walked in any other\ndirection, nor talked of anything else, and that without Hector, or\nGeorge Rivers, he had nobody to speak to. However, he was a good deal\ntranquillised by an introduction to Dr. Spencer’s laboratory, where he\ncompounded mixtures that Dr. Spencer promised should do no more harm\nthan was reasonable to himself, or any one else. Ethel suspected that,\nif Tom had chanced to singe his eyebrows, his friend would not have\nregretted a blight to his nascent coxcombry, but he was far too careful\nof his own beauty to do any such thing.\n\nRichard was set at liberty just before Easter, and came home to his new\ncharge. He was aware of what had taken place, and heartily grateful for\nthe part his father had taken. To work at Cocksmoor, under Mr. Wilmot,\nand to live at home, was felicity; and he fitted at once into his old\nplace, and resumed all the little home services for which he had been\nalways famed. Ethel was certain that Margaret was content, when she saw\nher brother bending over her, and the sense of reliance and security\nthat the presence of the silent Richard imparted to the whole family was\nsomething very peculiar, especially as they were so much more active and\ndemonstrative than he was.\n\nMr. Wilmot put him at once in charge of the hamlet. The inhabitants were\nstill a hard, rude, unpromising race, and there were many flagrant\nevils amongst them, but the last few years had not been without some\neffect--some were less obdurate, a few really touched, and, almost all,\nglad of instruction for their children. If Ethel’s perseverance had\ndone nothing else, it had, at least, been a witness, and her immediate\nscholars showed the influence of her lessons.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\n\n   Then out into the world, my course I did determine;\n   Though, to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming.\n   My talents they were not the worst, nor yet my education;\n   Resolved was I, at least to try, to mend my situation.--BURNS.\n\n\nIn the meantime, the session of Parliament had begun, and the Rivers’\nparty had, since February, inhabited Park Lane. Meta had looked pale\nand pensive, as she bade her friends at Stoneborough good-bye; but only\nbetrayed that she had rather have stayed at home, by promising herself\ngreat enjoyment in meeting them again at Easter.\n\nFlora was, on the other hand, in the state of calm patronage that\nbetokened perfect satisfaction. She promised wonders for Miss Bracy’s\nsisters--talked of inviting Mary and Blanche to see sights and take\nlessons; and undertook to send all the apparatus needed by Cocksmoor\nschool; and she did, accordingly, send down so many wonderful articles,\nthat curate and schoolmistress were both frightened; Mrs. Taylor thought\nthe easels were new-fashioned instruments of torture; and Ethel found\nherself in a condition to be liberal to Stoneborough National School.\n\nFlora was a capital correspondent, and made it her business to keep\nMargaret amused, so that the home-party were well informed of the doings\nof each of her days--and very clever her descriptions were. She had\ngiven herself a dispensation from general society until after Easter;\nbut, in the meantime, both she and Meta seemed to find great enjoyment\nin country rides and drives, and in quiet little dinners at home, to\nGeorge’s agreeable political friends. With the help of two such ladies\nas Mrs. and Miss Rivers, Ethel could imagine George’s house pleasant\nenough to attract clever people; but she was surprised to find how full\nher sister’s letters were of political news.\n\nIt was a period when great interests were in agitation; and the details\nof London talk and opinions were extremely welcome. Dr. Spencer used to\ncome in to ask after “Mrs. Rivers’s Intelligencer”; and, when he heard\nthe lucid statements, would say, she ought to have been a “special\ncorrespondent.” And her father declared that her news made him twice\nas welcome to his patients; but her cleverest sentences always were\nprefaced with “George says,” or “George thinks,” in a manner that made\nher appear merely the dutiful echo of his sentiments.\n\nIn an early letter, Flora mentioned how she had been reminded of poor\nHarry, by finding Miss Walkinghame’s card. That lady lived with her\nmother at Richmond, and, on returning the visit, Flora was warmly\nwelcomed by the kind old Lady Walkinghame, who insisted on her bringing\nher baby and spending a long day. The sisters-in-law had been enchanted\nwith Miss Walkinghame, whose manners, wrote Flora, certainly merited\npapa’s encomium.\n\nOn the promised “long day,” they found an unexpected addition to the\nparty, Sir Henry Walkinghame, who had newly returned from the continent.\n“A fine-looking, agreeable man, about five-and-thirty,” Flora described\nhim, “very lively and entertaining. He talked a great deal of Dr.\nSpencer, and of the life in the caves at Thebes; and he asked me whether\nthat unfortunate place, Cocksmoor, did not owe a great deal to me, or to\none of my sisters. I left Meta to tell him that story, and they became\nvery sociable over it.”\n\nA day or two after--“Sir Henry Walkinghame has been dining with us. He\nhas a very good voice, and we had some delightful music in the evening.”\n\nBy and by Sir Henry was the second cavalier, when they went to an\noratorio, and Meta’s letter overflowed with the descriptions she had\nheard from him of Italian church music. He always went to Rome for\nEaster, and had been going as usual, this spring, but he lingered, and,\nfor once, remained in England, where he had only intended to spend a few\ndays on necessary business.\n\nThe Easter recess was not spent at the Grange, but at Lady Leonora’s\npretty house in Surrey. She had invited the party in so pressing a\nmanner that Flora did not think it right to decline. Meta expressed some\ndisappointment at missing Easter among her school-children, but she\nsaid a great deal about the primroses and the green corn-fields, and\nnightingales--all which Ethel would have set down to her trick of\nuniversal content, if it had not appeared that Sir Henry was there too,\nand shared in all the delicious rides.\n\n“What would Ethel say,” wrote Flora, “to have our little Meta as Lady\nof the Manor of Cocksmoor? He has begun to talk about Drydale, and there\nare various suspicious circumstances that Lady Leonora marks with the\neyes of a discreet dowager. It was edifying to see how, from smiles, we\ncame to looks, and by and by to confidential talks, which have made her\nentirely forgive me for having so many tall brothers. Poor dear old Mr.\nRivers! Lady Leonora owns that it was the best thing possible for that\nsweet girl that he did not live any longer to keep her in seclusion; it\nis so delightful to see her appreciated as she deserves, and with her\nbeauty and fortune, she might make any choice she pleases. In fact, I\nbelieve Lady Leonora would like to look still higher for her, but this\nwould be mere ambition, and we should be far better satisfied with such\na connection as this, founded on mutual and increasing esteem, with a\nman so well suited to her, and fixing her so close to us. You must not,\nhowever, launch out into an ocean of possibilities, for the good aunt\nhas only infected me with the castle-building propensities of chaperons,\nand Meta is perfectly unconscious, looking on him as too hopelessly\nmiddle-aged, to entertain any such evil designs, avowing freely that\nshe likes him, and treating him very nearly as she does papa. It is\nmy business to keep ‘our aunt,’ who, between ourselves, has, below the\nsurface, the vulgarity of nature that high-breeding cannot eradicate,\nfrom startling the little humming-bird, before the net has been properly\ntwined round her bright little heart. As far as I can see, he is much\nsmitten, but very cautious in his approaches, and he is wise.”\n\nMargaret did not know what dismay she conveyed, as she handed this\nletter to her sister. There was no rest for Ethel till she could be\nalone with her father. “Could nothing prevent it? Could not Flora be\ntold of Mr. Rivers’s wishes?” she asked.\n\n“His wishes would have lain this way.”\n\n“I do not know that.”\n\n“It is no concern of ours. There is nothing objectionable here, and\nthough I can’t say it is not a disappointment, it ought not to be. The\nlong and short of it is, that I never ought to have told you anything\nabout it.”\n\n“Poor Norman!”\n\n“Absurd! The lad is hardly one-and-twenty. Very few marry a first\nlove.” (Ah, Ethel!) “Poor old Rivers only mentioned it as a refuge from\nfortune-hunters, and it stands to reason that he would have preferred\nthis. Anyway, it is awkward for a man with empty pockets to marry an\nheiress, and it is wholesomer for him to work for his living. Better\nthat it should be out of his head at once, if it were there at all. I\ntrust it was all our fancy. I would not have him grieved now for worlds,\nwhen his heart is sore.”\n\n“Somehow,” said Ethel, “though he is depressed and silent, I like it\nbetter than I did last Christmas.”\n\n“Of course, when we were laughing out of the bitterness of our hearts,”\n said Dr. May, sighing. “It is a luxury to let oneself alone to be\nsorrowful.”\n\nEthel did not know whether she desired a tete-a-tete with Norman or not.\nShe was aware that he had seen Flora’s letter, and she did not believe\nthat he would ever mention the hopes that must have been dashed by it;\nor, if he should do so, how could she ever guard her father’s secret? At\nleast, she had the comfort of recognising the accustomed Norman in his\nmanner, low-spirited, indeed, and more than ever dreamy and melancholy,\nbut not in the unnatural and excited state that had made her unhappy\nabout him. She could not help telling Dr. Spencer that this was much\nmore the real brother.\n\n“I dare say,” was the answer, not quite satisfactory in tone.\n\n“I thought you would like it better.”\n\n“Truth is better than fiction, certainly. But I am afraid he has a\ntendency to morbid self-contemplation, and you ought to shake him out of\nit.”\n\n“What is the difference between self-contemplation and\nself-examination?”\n\n“The difference between your brother and yourself. Ah! you think that\nno answer. Will you have a medical simile? Self-examination notes the\nsymptoms and combats them; self-contemplation does as I did when I was\nunstrung by that illness at Poonshedagore, and was always feeling my\nown pulse. It dwells on them, and perpetually deplores itself. Oh,\ndear! this is no better--what a wretch I am. It is always studying its\ndeformities in a moral looking-glass.”\n\n“Yes, I think poor Norman does that, but I thought it right and humble.”\n\n“The humility of a self-conscious mind. It is the very reverse of your\nfather, who is the most really humble man in existence.”\n\n“Do you call self-consciousness a fault?”\n\n“No. I call it a misfortune. In the vain, it leads to prudent vanity; in\nthe good, to a painful effort of humility.”\n\n“I don’t think I quite understand what it is.”\n\n“No, and you have so much of your father in you, that you never will.\nBut take care of your brother, and don’t let his brains work.”\n\nHow Ethel was to take care of him she did not know; she could only\nkeep a heedful eye on him, and rejoice when he took Tom out for a long\nwalk--a companion certainly not likely to promote the working of the\nbrain--but though it was in the opposite direction to Cocksmoor, Tom\ncame home desperately cross, snubbed Gertrude, and fagged Aubrey; but,\nthen, as Blanche observed, perhaps that was only because his trousers\nwere splashed.\n\nIn her next solitary walk to Cocksmoor, Norman joined Ethel. She was\ngratified, but she could not think of one safe word worth saying to him,\nand for a mile they preserved an absolute silence, until he first began,\n“Ethel, I have been thinking--”\n\n“That you have!” said she, between hope and dread, and the thrill of\nbeing again treated as his friend.\n\n“I want to consult you. Don’t you think now that Richard is settled at\nhome, and if Tom will study medicine, that I could be spared.”\n\n“Spared!” exclaimed Ethel. “You are not much at home.”\n\n“I meant more than my present absences. It is my earnest wish--” he\npaused, and the continuation took her by surprise. “Do you think it\nwould give my father too much pain to part with me as a missionary to\nNew Zealand?”\n\nShe could only gaze at him in mute amazement.\n\n“Do you think he could bear it?” said Norman hastily.\n\n“He would consent,” she replied. “Oh, Norman, it is the most glorious\nthing man can do! How I wish I could go with you.”\n\n“Your mission is here,” said Norman affectionately.\n\n“I know it is--I am contented with it,” said Ethel; “but oh! Norman,\nafter all our talks about races and gifts, you have found the more\nexcellent way.”\n\n“Hush! Charity finds room at home, and mine are not such unmixed motives\nas yours.”\n\nShe made a sound of inquiry.\n\n“I cannot tell you all. Some you shall hear. I am weary of this feverish\nlife of competition and controversy--”\n\n“I thought you were so happy with your fellowship. I thought Oxford was\nyour delight.”\n\n“She will always be nearer my heart than any place, save this. It is not\nher fault that I am not like the simple and dutiful, who are not fretted\nor perplexed.”\n\n“Perplexed?” repeated Ethel.\n\n“It is not so now,” he replied. “God forbid! But where better men have\nbeen led astray, I have been bewildered; till, Ethel, I have felt as if\nthe ground were slipping from beneath my feet, and I have only been able\nto hide my eyes, and entreat that I might know the truth.”\n\n“You knew it!” said Ethel, looking pale, and gazing searchingly at him.\n\n“I did, I do; but it was a time of misery when, for my presumption, I\nsuppose, I was allowed to doubt whether it were the truth.”\n\nEthel recoiled, but came nearer, saying, very low, “It is past.”\n\n“Yes, thank Him who is Truth. You all saved me, though you did not know\nit.”\n\n“When was this?” she asked timidly.\n\n“The worst time was before the Long Vacation. They told me I ought\nto read this book and that. Harvey Anderson used to come primed with\narguments. I could always overthrow them, but when I came to glory in\ndoing so, perhaps I prayed less. Anyway, they left a sting. It might be\nthat I doubted my own sincerity, from knowing that I had got to argue,\nchiefly because I liked to be looked on as a champion.”\n\nEthel saw the truth of what her friend had said of the morbid habit of\nself-contemplation.\n\n“I read, and I mystified myself. The better I talked, the more my own\nconvictions failed me; and, by the time you came up to Oxford, I knew\nhow you would have shrunk from him who was your pride, if you could have\nseen into the secrets beneath.”\n\nEthel took hold of his hand. “You seemed bright,” she said.\n\n“It melted like a bad dream before--before the humming-bird, and with my\nfather. It was weeks ere I dared to face the subject again.”\n\n“How could you? Was it safe?”\n\n“I could not have gone on as I was. Sometimes the sight of my father, or\nthe mountains and lakes in Scotland, or--or--things at the Grange, would\nbring peace back; but there were dark hours, and I knew that there could\nbe no comfort till I had examined and fought it out.”\n\n“I suppose examination was right,” said Ethel, “for a man, and defender\nof the faith. I should only have tried to pray the terrible thought\naway. But I can’t tell how it feels.”\n\n“Worse than you have power to imagine,” said Norman, shuddering. “It is\nover now. I worked out their fallacies, and went over the reasoning on\nour side.”\n\n“And prayed--” said Ethel.\n\n“Indeed I did; and the confidence returned, firmer, I hope, than ever.\nIt had never gone for a whole day.”\n\nEthel breathed freely. “It was life or death,” she said, “and we never\nknew it!”\n\n“Perhaps not; but I know your prayers were angel-wings ever round me.\nAnd far more than argument, was the thought of my father’s heart-whole\nChristian love and strength.”\n\n“Norman, you believed, all the time, with your heart. This was only a\nbewilderment of your intellect.”\n\n“I think you are right,” said Norman. “To me the doubt was cruel\nagony--not the amusement it seems to some.”\n\n“Because our dear home has made the truth, our joy, our union,” said\nEthel. “And you are sure the cloud is gone, and for ever?” she still\nasked anxiously.\n\nHe stood still. “For ever, I trust,” he said. “I hold the faith of my\nchildhood in all its fullness as surely as--as ever I loved my mother\nand Harry.”\n\n“I know you do,” said Ethel. “It was only a bad dream.”\n\n“I hope I may be forgiven for it,” said Norman. “I do not know how\nfar it was sin. It was gone so far as that my mind was convinced last\nChristmas, but the shame and sting remained. I was not at peace again\ntill the news of this spring came, and brought, with the grief, this\ncompensation--that I could cast behind me and forget the criticisms and\ndoubts that those miserable debates had connected with sacred words.”\n\n“You will be the sounder for having fought the fight,” said Ethel.\n\n“I do not dread the like shocks,” said her brother, “but I long to leave\nthis world of argument and discussion. It is right that there should be\na constant defence and battle, but I am not fit for it. I argue for my\nown triumph, and, in heat and harassing, devotion is lost. Besides, the\ncomparison of intellectual power has been my bane all my life.”\n\n“I thought ‘praise was your penance here.’”\n\n“I would fain render it so, but--in short, I must be away from it all,\nand go to the simplest, hardest work, beginning from the rudiments, and\nforgetting subtle arguments.”\n\n“Forgetting yourself,” said Ethel.\n\n“Right. I want to have no leisure to think about myself,” said Norman.\n“I am never so happy as at such times.”\n\n“And you want to find work so far away?”\n\n“I cannot help feeling drawn towards those southern seas. I am glad you\ncan give me good-speed. But what do you think about my father?”\n\nEthel thought and thought. “I know he would not hinder you,” she\nrepeated.\n\n“But you dread the pain for him? I had talked to Tom about taking his\nprofession; but the poor boy thinks he dislikes it greatly, though, I\nbelieve, his real taste lies that way, and his aversion only arises a\nfew grand notions he has picked up, out of which I could soon talk him.”\n\n“Tom will not stand in your place,” said Ethel.\n\n“He will be more equable and more to be depended upon,” said Norman.\n“None of you appreciate Tom. However, you must hear my alternative. If\nyou think my going would be too much grief for papa, or if Tom be set\nagainst helping him in his practice, there is an evident leading of\nProvidence, showing that I am unworthy of this work. In that case I\nwould go abroad and throw myself, at once, with all my might, into the\nstudy of medicine, and get ready to give my father some rest. It is a\nshame that all his sons should turn away from his profession.”\n\n“I am more than ever amazed!” cried Ethel. “I thought you detested it. I\nthought papa never wished it for you. He said you had not nerve.”\n\n“He was always full of the tenderest consideration for me,” said Norman.\n“With Heaven to help him, a man may have nerve for whatever is his\nduty.”\n\n“How he would like to have you to watch and help. But New Zealand would\nbe so glorious!”\n\n“Glory is not for me,” said Norman. “Understand, Ethel, the choice is\nNew Zealand, or going at once--at once, mind--to study at Edinburgh or\nParis.”\n\n“New Zealand at once?” said Ethel.\n\n“I suppose I mast stay for divinity lectures, but my intention must\nbe avowed,” said Norman hastily. “And now, will you sound my father? I\ncannot.”\n\n“I can’t sound,” said Ethel. “I can only do things point-blank.”\n\n“Do then,” said Norman, “any way you can! Only let me know which is best\nfor him. You get all the disagreeable things to do, good old unready\none,” he added kindly. “I believe you are the one who would be shoved in\nfront, if we were obliged to face a basilisk.”\n\nThe brightness that had come over Norman, when he had discharged his\ncares upon her, was encouragement enough for Ethel. She only asked how\nmuch she was to repeat of their conversation.\n\n“Whatever you think best. I do not want to grieve him, but he must not\nthink it fine in me.”\n\nEthel privately thought that no power on earth could prevent him from\ndoing that.\n\nIt was not consistent with cautious sounding, that Norman was always\nlooking appealingly towards her; and, indeed, she could not wait long\nwith such a question on her mind. She remained with her father in the\ndrawing-room, when the rest were gone upstairs, and, plunging at once\ninto the matter, she said, “Papa, there is something that Norman cannot\nbear to say to you himself.”\n\n“Humming-birds to wit?” said Dr. May.\n\n“No, indeed, but he wants to be doing something at once. What should you\nthink of--of--there are two things; one is--going out as a missionary--”\n\n“Humming-birds in another shape,” said the doctor, startled, but\nsmiling, so as to pique her.\n\n“You mean to treat it as a boy’s fancy!” said she.\n\n“It is rather suspicious,” he said. “Well, what is the other of his two\nthings?”\n\n“The other is, to begin studying medicine at once, so as to help you.”\n\n“Heyday!” cried Dr. May, drawing up his tall vigorous figure, “does he\nthink me so very ancient and superannuated?”\n\nWhat could possess him to be so provoking and unsentimental to-night?\nWas it her own bad management? She longed to put an end to the\nconversation, and answered, “No, but he thinks it hard that none of your\nsons should be willing to relieve you.”\n\n“It won’t be Norman,” said Dr. May. “He is not made of the stuff. If\nhe survived the course of study, every patient he lost, he would bring\nhimself in guilty of murder, and there would soon be an end of him!”\n\n“He says that a man can force himself to anything that is his duty.”\n\n“This is not going to be his duty, if I can make it otherwise. What is\nthe meaning of all this? No, I need not ask, poor boy, it is what I was\nafraid of!”\n\n“It is far deeper,” said Ethel; and she related great part of what\nshe had heard in the afternoon. It was not easy to make her father\nlisten--his line was to be positively indignant, rather than\ncompassionate, when he heard of the doubts that had assailed poor\nNorman. “Foolish boy, what business had he to meddle with those accursed\nbooks, when he knew what they were made of--it was tasting poison,\nit was running into temptation! He had no right to expect to come out\nsafe--” and then he grasped tightly hold of Ethel’s hands, and, as if\nthe terror had suddenly flashed on him, asked her, with dilated eye and\ntrembling voice, whether she were sure that he was safe, and held the\nfaith.\n\nEthel repeated his asseveration, and her father covered his face with\nhis hands in thanksgiving.\n\nAfter this, he seemed somewhat inclined to hold poor Oxford in horror,\nonly, as he observed, it would be going out of the frying-pan into the\nfire, to take refuge at Paris--a recurrence to the notion of Norman’s\nmedical studies, that showed him rather enticed by the proposal.\n\nHe sent Ethel to bed, saying he should talk to Norman and find out what\nwas the meaning of it, and she walked upstairs, much ashamed of having\nso ill served her brother, as almost to have made him ridiculous.\n\nDr May and Norman never failed to come to an understanding, and after\nthey had had a long drive into the country together, Dr May told Ethel\nthat he was afraid, of what he ought not to be afraid of, that she was\nright, that the lad was very much in earnest now at any rate, and if he\nshould continue in the same mind, he hoped he should not be so weak as\nto hold him from a blessed work.\n\nFrom Norman, Ethel heard the warmest gratitude for his father’s\nkindness. Nothing could be done yet, he must wait patiently for the\npresent, but he was to write to his uncle, Mr. Arnott, in New Zealand,\nand, without pledging himself, to make inquiries as to the mission; and\nin the meantime, return to Oxford, where, to his other studies, he was\nto add a course of medical lectures, which, as Dr. May said, would do\nhim no harm, would occupy his mind, and might turn to use wherever he\nwas.\n\nEthel was surprised to find that Norman wrote to Flora an expression of\nhis resolution, that, if he found he could be spared from assisting his\nfather as a physician, he would give himself up to the mission in New\nZealand. Why should he tell any one so unsympathetic as Flora, who would\nthink him wasted in either case?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n\n     Do not fear: Heaven is as near,\n     By water, as by land.--LONGFELLOW.\n\n\nThe fifth of May was poor Harry’s eighteenth birthday, and, as usual,\nwas a holiday. Etheldred privately thought his memory more likely to be\nrespected, if Blanche and Aubrey were employed, than if they were left\nin idleness; but Mary would have been wretched had the celebration been\nomitted, and a leisure day was never unwelcome.\n\nDr. Spencer carried off Blanche and Aubrey for a walk, and Ethel found\nMary at her great resort--Harry’s cupboard--dusting and arranging his\nbooks, and the array of birthday gifts, to which, even to-day, she had\nnot failed to add the marker that had been in hand at Christmas. Ethel\nentreated her to come down, and Mary promised, and presently appeared,\nlooking so melancholy, that, as a sedative, Ethel set her down to\nthe basket of scraps to find materials for a tippet for some one at\nCocksmoor, intending, as soon as Margaret should be dressed, to resign\nher morning to the others, invite Miss Bracy to the drawing-room, and\nread aloud.\n\nGertrude was waiting for her walk, till nurse should have dressed\nMargaret, and was frisking about the lawn, sometimes looking in at the\ndrawing-room window at her sisters, sometimes chattering to Adams at his\nwork, or laughing to herself and the flowers, in that overflow of mirth,\nthat seemed always bubbling up within her.\n\nShe was standing in rapt contemplation of a pear-tree in full blossom,\nher hands tightly clasped behind the back, for greater safety from the\ntemptation, when, hearing the shrubbery gate open, she turned, expecting\nto see her papa, but was frightened at the sight of two strangers, and\nbegan to run off at full speed.\n\n“Stop! Blanche! Blanche, don’t you know me?” The voice was that tone of\nher brother’s, and she stood and looked, but it came from a tall, ruddy\nyouth, in a shabby rough blue coat, followed by a grizzled old seaman.\nShe was too much terrified and perplexed even to run.\n\n“What’s the matter! Blanche, it is I! Why, don’t you know me--Harry?”\n\n“Poor brother Harry is drowned,” she answered; and, with one bound, he\nwas beside her, and, snatching her up, devoured her with kisses.\n\n“Put me down--put me down, please,” was all she could say.\n\n“It is not Blanche! What? the little Daisy, I do believe!”\n\n“Yes, I am Gertrude, but please let me go;” and, at the same time, Adams\nhurried up, as if he thought her being kidnapped, but his aspect changed\nat the glad cry, “Ha! Adams’ how are you? Are they all well?”\n\n“‘Tisn’t never Master Harry! Bless me!” as Harry’s hand gave him\nsensible proof; “when we had given you up for lost!”\n\n“My father well?” Harry asked, hurrying the words one over the other.\n\n“Quite well, sir, but he never held up his head since he heard it, and\npoor Miss Mary has so moped about. If ever I thought to see the like--”\n\n“So they did not get my letter, but I can’t stop. Jennings will tell\nyou. Take care of him. Come, Daisy--” for he had kept her unwilling hand\nall the time. “But what’s that for?” pointing to the black ribbons, and,\nstopping short, startled.\n\n“Because of poor Harry,” said the bewildered child.\n\n“Oh, that’s right!” cried he, striding on, and dragging her in a\nbreathless run, as he threw open the well-known doors; and, she escaping\nfrom him, hid her face in Mary’s lap, screaming, “He says he is Harry!\nhe says he is not drowned!”\n\nAt the same moment Ethel was in his arms, and his voice was sobbing,\n“Ethel! Mary! home! Where’s papa?” One moment’s almost agonising joy in\nthe certainty of his identity! but ere she could look or think, he was\ncrying, “Mary! oh, Ethel, see--”\n\nMary had not moved, but sat as if turned to stone, with breath\nsuspended, wide-stretched eyes, and death-like cheeks--Ethel sprang to\nher, “Mary, Mary dear, it is Harry! It is himself! Don’t you see? Speak\nto her, Harry.”\n\nHe seemed almost afraid to do so, but, recovering himself, exclaimed,\n“Mary, dear old Polly, here I am! Oh, won’t you speak to me?” he added\npiteously, as he threw his arm round her and kissed her, startled at the\ncold touch of her cheek.\n\nThe spell seemed broken, and, with a wild hoarse shriek that rang\nthrough the house, she struggled to regain her breath, but it would only\ncome in painful, audible catches, as she held Harry’s hand convulsively.\n\n“What have I done?” he exclaimed, in distress.\n\n“What’s this! Who is this frightening my dear?” was old nurse’s\nexclamation, as she and James came at the outcry.\n\n“Oh, nurse, what have I done to her?” repeated Harry.\n\n“It is joy--it is sudden joy!” said Ethel. “See, she is better now--”\n\n“Master Harry! Well, I never!” and James, “with one wring of the hand,\nretreated, while old nurse was nearly hugged to death, declaring all the\ntime that he didn’t ought to have come in such a way, terrifying every\none out of their senses! and as for poor Miss May--\n\n“Where is she?” cried Harry, starting at the sight of the vacant sofa.\n\n“Only upstairs,” said Ethel; “but where’s Alan? Is not he come?”\n\n“Oh, Ethel, don’t you know?” His face told but too plainly.\n\n“Nurse! nurse, how shall we tell her?” said Ethel.\n\n“Poor dear!” exclaimed nurse, sounding her tongue on the roof of her\nmouth. “She’ll never abear it without her papa. Wait for him, I should\nsay. But bless me, Miss Mary, to see you go on like that, when Master\nHarry is come back such a bonny man!”\n\n“I’m better now,” said Mary, with an effort. “Oh, Harry! speak to me\nagain.”\n\n“But Margaret!” said Ethel, while the brother was holding Mary in\nhis embrace, and she lay tremulous with the new ecstasy upon his\nbreast--“but Margaret. Nurse, you must go up, or she will suspect. I’ll\ncome when I can; speak quietly. Oh! poor Margaret! If Richard would but\ncome in!”\n\nEthel walked up and down the room, divided between a tumult of joy,\ngrief, dread, and perplexity. At that moment a little voice said at the\ndoor, “Please, Margaret wants Harry to come up directly.”\n\nThey looked one upon another in consternation. They had never thought of\nthe child, who, of course, had flown up at once with the tidings.\n\n“Go up, Miss Ethel,” said nurse.\n\n“Oh! nurse, I can’t be the first. Come, Harry, come.”\n\nHand-in-hand, they silently ascended the stairs, and Ethel pushed open\nthe door. Margaret was on her couch, her whole form and face in one\nthrob of expectation.\n\nShe looked into Harry’s face--the eagerness flitted like sunshine on the\nhillside, before a cloud, and, without a word, she held out her arms.\n\nHe threw himself on his knees, and her fingers were clasped among his\nthick curls, while his frame heaved with suppressed sobs, “Oh, if he\ncould only have come back to you.”\n\n“Thank God,” she said; then slightly pushing him back, she lay holding\nhis hand in one of hers, and resting the other on his shoulder, and\ngazing in silence into his face. Each was still--she was gathering\nstrength--he dreaded word or look.\n\n“Tell me how and where;” she said at last.\n\n“It was in the Loyalty Isles; it was fever--the exertions for us. His\nhead was lying here,” and he pointed to his own breast. “He sent his\nlove to you--he bade me tell you there would be meeting by and by, in\nthe haven where he would be.--I laid his head in the grave--under the\ngreat palm--I said some of the prayers--there are Christians round it.”\n\nHe said this in short disconnected phrases, often pausing to gather\nvoice, but forced to resume, by her inquiring looks and pressure of his\nhand.\n\nShe asked no more. “Kiss me,” she said, and when he had done so, “Thank\nyou, go down, please, all of you. You have brought great relief. Thank\nyou. But I can’t talk yet. You shall tell me the rest by and by.”\n\nShe sent them all away, even Ethel, who would have lingered.\n\n“Go to him, dearest. Let me be alone. Don’t be uneasy. This is\npeace--but go.”\n\nEthel found Mary and Harry interlaced into one moving figure, and Harry\ngreedily asking for his father and Norman, as if famishing for the sight\nof them. He wanted to set out to seek the former in the town, but his\nmovements were too uncertain, and the girls clung to the newly-found,\nas if they could not trust him away from them. They wandered about,\nspeaking, all three at random, without power of attending to the\nanswers. It was enough to see him, and touch him; they could not yet\ncare where he had been.\n\nDr. May was in the midst of them ere they were aware. One look, and he\nflung his arms round his son, but, suddenly letting him go, he burst\naway, and banged his study door. Harry would have followed.\n\n“No, don’t,” said Ethel; then, seeing him disappointed, she came nearer,\nand murmured, “‘He entered into his chamber and--’”\n\nHarry silenced her with another embrace, but their father was with them\nagain, to verify that he had really seen his boy, and ask, alas! whether\nAlan were with Margaret. The brief sad answer sent him to see how it was\nwith her. She would not let him stay; she said it was infinite comfort,\nand joy was coming, but she would rather be still, and not come down\ntill evening.\n\nPerhaps others would fain have been still, could they have borne an\ninstant’s deprivation of the sight of their dear sailor, while greetings\ncame thickly on him. The children burst in, having heard a report in the\ntown, and Dr. Spencer waited at the door for the confirmation; but when\nEthel would have flown out to him, he waved his hand, shut the door, and\nhurried away, as if a word to her would have been an intrusion.\n\nThe brothers had been summoned by a headlong apparition of Will Adams in\nCocksmoor school, shouting that Master Harry was come home; and Norman’s\nlong legs out-speeding Richard, had brought him back, flushed, and too\nhappy for one word, while, “Well, Harry,” was Richard’s utmost, and his\ncare for Margaret seemed to overpower everything else, as he went up,\nand was not so soon sent away.\n\nWords were few downstairs. Blanche and Aubrey agreed that they\nthought people would have been much happier, but, in fact, the joy was\noppressive from very newness. Ethel roamed about, she could not sit\nstill without feeling giddy, in the strangeness of the revulsion. Her\nfather sat, as if a word would break the blest illusion; and Harry\nstood before each of them in turn, as if about to speak, but turned\nhis address into a sudden caress, or blow on the shoulder, and tried to\nlaugh. Little Gertrude, not understanding; the confusion, had taken up\nher station under the table, and peeped out from beneath the cover.\n\nThere was more composure as they sat at dinner, and yet there was very\nlittle talking or eating. Afterwards Dr. May and Norman exultingly\nwalked away, to show their Harry to Dr. Spencer and Mr. Wilmot; and\nEthel would gladly have tried to calm herself, and recover the balance\nof her mind, by giving thanks where they were due; but she did not know\nwhat to do with her sisters. Blanche was wild, and Mary still in so\nshaky a state of excitement, that she went off into mad laughing, when\nBlanche discovered that they were in mourning for Harry.\n\nNothing would satisfy Blanche but breaking in on Margaret, and climbing\nto the top of the great wardrobe to disinter the coloured raiment,\nbeseeching that each favourite might be at once put on, to do honour\nto Harry. Mary chimed in with her, in begging for the wedding\nmerinos--would not Margaret wear her beautiful blue?\n\n“No, my dear, I cannot,” said Margaret gently.\n\nMary looked at her and was again in a flood of tears, incoherently\nprotesting, together with Ethel, that they would not change.\n\n“No, dears,” said Margaret. “I had rather you did so. You must not be\nunkind to Harry. He will not think I do not welcome him. I am only too\nglad that Richard would not let my impatience take away my right to wear\nthis.”\n\nEthel knew that it was for life.\n\nMary could not check her tears, and would go on making heroic protests\nagainst leaving off her black, sobbing the more at each. Margaret’s\ngentle caresses seemed to make her worse, and Ethel, afraid that\nMargaret’s own composure would be overthrown, exclaimed, “How can you\nbe so silly? Come away!” and rather roughly pulled her out of the room,\nwhen she collapsed entirely at the top of the stairs, and sat crying\nhelplessly.\n\n“I can’t think what’s the use of Harry’s coming home,” Gertrude was\nheard saying to Richard. “It is very disagreeable;” whereat Mary\nrelapsed into a giggle, and Ethel felt frantic.\n\n“Richard! Richard! what is to be done with Mary? She can’t help it, I\nbelieve, but this is not the way to treat the mercy that--”\n\n“Mary had better go and lie down in her own room,” said Richard,\ntenderly and gravely.\n\n“Oh, please! please!” began Mary, “I shall not see him when he comes\nback!”\n\n“If you can’t behave properly when he does come,” said Richard, “there\nis no use in being there.”\n\n“Remember, Ritchie,” said Ethel, thinking him severe, “she has not been\nwell this long time.”\n\nMary began to plead, but, with his own pretty persuasive manner, he\ntook her by the hand, and drew her into his room; and when he came down,\nafter an interval, it was to check Blanche, who would have gone up to\ninterrupt her with queries about the perpetual blue merino. He sat down\nwith Blanche on the staircase window-seat, and did not let her go till\nhe had gently talked her out of flighty spirits into the soberness of\nthankfulness.\n\nEthel, meanwhile, had still done nothing but stray about, long for\nloneliness, find herself too unsteady to finish her letters to Flora\nand Tom; and, while she tried to make Gertrude think Harry a pleasant\nacquisition, she hated her own wild heart, that could not rejoice, nor\ngive thanks, aright.\n\nBy and by Mary came down, with her bonnet on, quite quiet now. “I am\ngoing to church with Ritchie,” she said. Ethel caught at the notion, and\nit spread through the house. Dr May, who just then came in with his two\nsons, looked at Harry, saying, “What do you think of it? Shall we go, my\nboy?” And Harry, as soon as he understood, declared that he should like\nnothing better. It seemed what they all needed, even Aubrey and Gertrude\nbegged to come, and, when the solemn old minster was above their\nheads, and the hallowed stillness around them, the tightened sense of\nhalf-realised joy began to find relief in the chant of glory. The voices\nof the sanctuary, ever uplifting notes of praise, seemed to gather\ntogether and soften their emotions; and agitation was soothed away, and\nall that was oppressive and tumultuous gave place to sweet peace and\nthankfulness. Ethel dimly remembered the like sense of relief, when her\nmother had hushed her wild ecstasy, while sympathising with her joy.\nRichard could not trust his voice, but Mr. Wilmot offered the special\nthanksgiving.\n\nHarry was, indeed, “at home,” and his tears fell fast over his book, as\nhe heard his father’s “Amen,” so fervent and so deep; and he gazed up\nand around, with fond and earnest looks, as thoughts and resolutions,\nformed there of old, came gathering thick upon him. And there little\nGertrude seemed first to accept him. She whispered to her papa, as they\nstood up to go away, that it was very good in God Almighty to have sent\nHarry home; and, as they left the cloister, she slipped into Harry’s\nhand a daisy from the grave, such a gift as she had never carried to any\none else, save her father and Margaret, and she shrank no longer from\nbeing lifted up in his arms, and carried home through the twilight\nstreet.\n\nHe hurried into the drawing-room, and was heard declaring that all was\nright, for Margaret was on the sofa; but he stopped short, grieved at\nher altered looks. She smiled as he stooped to kiss her, and then made\nhim stand erect, and measure himself against Norman, whose height he\nhad almost reached. The little curly midshipman had come back, as nurse\nsaid, “a fine-growed young man,” his rosy cheeks, brown and ruddy, and\nhis countenance--\n\n“You are much more like papa and Norman than I thought you would be,”\n said Margaret.\n\n“He has left his snub nose and yellow locks behind,” said his father;\n“though the shaggy mane seems to remain. I believe lions grow darker\nwith age. So there stand June and July together again!”\n\nDr. May walked backwards to look at them. It was good to see his face.\n\n“I shall see Flora and Tom to-morrow!” said Harry, after nodding with\nsatisfaction, as they all took their wonted places.\n\n“Going!” exclaimed Richard.\n\n“Why, don’t you know?” said Ethel; “it is current in the nursery that\nhe is going to be tried by court-martial for living with the King of the\nCannibal Islands.”\n\n“Aubrey says he had a desert island, with Jennings for his man Friday,”\n said Blanche.\n\n“Harry,” said little Gertrude, who had established herself on his knee,\n“did you really poke out the giant’s eye with the top of a fir-tree?”\n\n“Who told you so, Daisy?” was the general cry; but she became shy, and\nwould not answer more than by a whisper about Aubrey, who indignantly\ndeclared that he never said so, only Gertrude was so foolish that she\ndid not know Harry from Ulysses.\n\n“After all,” said Ethel, “I don’t think our notions are much more\ndefined. Papa and Norman may know more, but we have heard almost\nnothing. I have been waiting to hear more to close up my letters to\nFlora and Tom. What a shame that has not been done!”\n\n“I’ll finish,” said Mary, running to the side-table.\n\n“And tell her I’ll be there to-morrow,” said Harry. “I must report\nmyself; and what fun to see Flora a member of Parliament! Come with me,\nJune; I’ll be back next day. I wish you all would come.”\n\n“Yes, I must come with you,” said Norman. “I shall have to go to Oxford\non Thursday;” and very reluctant he looked. “Tell Flora I am coming,\nMary.”\n\n“How did you know that Flora was a married lady?” asked Blanche, in her\nwould-be grown-up manner.\n\n“I heard that from Aunt Flora. A famous lot of news I picked up there!”\n\n“Aunt Flora!”\n\n“Did you not know he had been at Auckland?” said Dr. May. “Aunt Flora\nhad to nurse him well after all he had undergone. Did you not think her\nvery like mamma, Harry?”\n\n“Mamma never looked half so old!” cried Harry indignantly.\n\n“Flora was five years younger!”\n\n“She has got her voice and way with her,” said Harry; “but you will soon\nsee. She is coming home soon.”\n\nThere was a great outcry of delight.\n\n“Yes, there is some money of Uncle Arnott’s that must be looked after,\nbut he does not like the voyage, and can’t leave his office, so perhaps\nAunt Flora may come alone. She had a great mind to come with me, but\nthere was no good berth for her in this schooner, and I could not wait\nfor another chance. I can’t think what possessed the letters not to\ncome! She would not write by the first packet, because I was so ill, but\nwe both wrote by the next, and I made sure you had them, or I would have\nwritten before I came.”\n\nThe words were not out of his mouth before the second post was brought\nin, and there were two letters from New Zealand! What would they not\nhave been yesterday? Harry would have burned his own, but the long\nclosely-written sheets were eagerly seized, as, affording the best hope\nof understanding his adventures, as it had been written at intervals\nfrom Auckland, and the papers, passing from one to the other, formed the\ntext for interrogations on further details, though much more was gleaned\nincidentally in tete-a-tetes, by Margaret, Norman, or his father, and no\none person ever heard the whole connectedly from Harry himself.\n\n“What was the first you knew of the fire, Harry?” asked Dr. May, looking\nup from the letter.\n\n“Owen shaking me awake; and I thought it was a hoax,” said Harry. “But\nit was true enough, and when we got on deck, there were clouds of smoke\ncoming up the main hatch-way.”\n\nMargaret’s eyes were upon him, and her lips formed the question, “And\nhe?”\n\n“He met us, and told us to be steady--but there was little need for\nthat! Every man there was as cool and collected as if it had been no\nmore than the cook’s stove--and we should have scorned to be otherwise!\nHe put his hand on my shoulder and said, ‘Keep by me,’ and I did.”\n\n“Then there was never much hope of extinguishing the fire?”\n\n“No; if you looked down below the forecastle it was like a furnace, and\nthough the pumps were at work, it was only to gain time while the boats\nwere lowered. The first lieutenant told off the men, and they went\ndown the side without one word, only shaking hands with those that were\nleft.”\n\n“Oh, Harry! what were you thinking of?” cried Blanche.\n\n“Of the powder,” said Harry.\n\nEthel thought there was more in that answer than met the ear, and that\nHarry, at least, had thought of the powder to-night at church.\n\n“Mr. Ernescliffe had the command of the second cutter. He asked to take\nme with him; I was glad enough; and Owen--he is mate, you know--went\nwith us.”\n\nAs to telling how he felt when he saw the good ship Alcestis blown to\nfragments, that was past Harry, and all but Blanche were wise enough not\nto ask. She had by way of answer, “Very glad to be safe out of her.”\n\nNor was Harry willing to dwell on the subsequent days, when the\nunclouded sun had been a cruel foe; and the insufficient stores of food\nand water did, indeed, sustain life, but a life of extreme suffering.\nWhat he told was of the kindness that strove to save him, as the\nyoungest, from all that could be spared him. “If I dropped asleep at the\nbottom of the boat, I was sure to find some one shading me from the sun.\nIf there was an extra drop of water, they wanted me to have it.”\n\n“Tell me their names, Harry!” cried Dr. May. “If ever I meet one of\nthem--”\n\n“But the storm, Harry, the storm?” asked Blanche. “Was that not\nterrible?”\n\n“Very comfortable at first, Blanche,” was the answer. “Oh, that rain!”\n\n“But when it grew so very bad?”\n\n“We did not reck much what happened to us,” said Harry. “It could not be\nworse than starving. When we missed the others in the morning, most of\nus thought them the best off.”\n\nMary could not help coming round to kiss him, as if eyes alone were not\nenough to satisfy her that here he was.\n\nDr. May shuddered, and went on reading, and Margaret drew Harry down to\nher, and once more by looks craved for more minute tidings.\n\n“All that you can think,” murmured Harry; “the very life and soul of us\nall--so kind, and yet discipline as perfect as on board. But don’t now,\nMargaret--”\n\nThe tone of the don’t, the reddening cheek, liquid eye, and heaving\nchest, told enough of what the lieutenant had been to one, at least, of\nthe desolate boat’s crew.\n\n“Oh, Harry, Harry! I can’t bear it!” exclaimed Mary. “How long did it\nlast? How did it end?”\n\n“Fifteen days,” said Harry. “It was time it should end, for all the\nwater we had caught in the storm was gone--we gave the last drop to\nJones, for we thought him dying; one’s tongue was like a dry sponge.”\n\n“How did it end?” repeated Mary, in an agony.\n\n“Jennings saw a sail. We thought it all a fancy of weakness, but ‘twas\ntrue enough, and they saw our signal of distress!”\n\nThe vessel proved to be an American whaler, which had just parted with\nher cargo to a homeward bound ship, and was going to refit, and take in\nprovisions and water at one of the Milanesian islands, before returning\nfor further captures. The master was a man of the shrewd, hard\nmoney-making cast; but, at the price of Mr. Ernescliffe’s chronometer,\nand of the services of the sailors, he undertook to convey them where\nthey might fall in with packets bound for Australia.\n\nThe distressed Alcestes at first thought themselves in paradise, but\nthe vessel, built with no view, save to whales, and, with a considerable\nreminiscence of the blubber lately parted with, proved no wholesome\nabode, when overcrowded, and in the tropics! Mr. Ernescliffe’s science,\nresolution, and constancy, had saved his men so far; but with the need\nfor exertion his powers gave way, and he fell a prey to a return of the\nfever which had been his introduction to Dr. May.\n\n“There he was,” said Harry, “laid up in a little bit of a stifling\ncabin, just like an oven, without the possibility of a breath of air!\nThe skin-flint skipper carried no medicine; the water--shocking stuff it\nwas--was getting so low, that there was only a pint a day served out to\neach, and though all of us Alcestes clubbed every drop we could spare\nfor him--it was bad work! Owen and I never were more glad in our lives\nthan when we heard we were to cast anchor at the Loyalty Isles! Such a\nplace as it was! You little know what it was to see anything green! And\nthere was this isle fringed down close to the sea with cocoa-nut trees!\nAnd the bay as clear!--you could see every shell, and wonderful fishes\nswimming in it! Well, every one was for going ashore, and some of the\nnatives swam out to us, and brought things in their canoes, but not\nmany; it is not encouraged by the mission, nor by David--for those\nYankee traders are not the most edifying society--and the crew vowed\nthey were cannibals, and had eaten a man three years ago, so they all\nwent ashore armed.”\n\n“You stayed with him,” said Margaret.\n\n“Ay, it was my turn, and I was glad enough to have some fresh fruit and\nwater for him, but he could not take any notice of it. Did not I want\nyou, papa? Well, by and by, Owen came back, in a perfect rapture\nwith the place and the people, and said it was the only hope for Mr.\nErnescliffe, to take him on shore--”\n\n“Then you did really go amongst the cannibals!” exclaimed Blanche.\n\n“That is all nonsense,” said Harry. “Some of them may once have been,\nand I fancy the heathens might not mind a bit of ‘long pig’ still; but\nthese have been converted by the Samoans.”\n\nThe Samoans, it was further explained, are the inhabitants of the\nNavigator Islands, who, having been converted by the Church Missionary\nSociety, have sent out great numbers of most active and admirable\nteachers among the scattered islands, braving martyrdom and disease,\nnever shrinking from their work, and, by teaching and example, preparing\nthe way for fuller doctrine than they can yet impart. A station of these\ndevoted men had for some years been settled in this island, and had\nsince been visited by the missions of Newcastle and New Zealand. The\nyoung chief, whom Harry called David, and another youth, had spent two\nsummers under instruction at New Zealand, and had been baptised. They\nwere spending the colder part of the year at home, and hoped shortly to\nbe called for by the mission-ship to return, and resume their course of\ninstruction.\n\nOwen had come to an understanding with the chief and the Samoans, and\nhad decided on landing his lieutenant, and it was accordingly done, with\nvery little consciousness on the patient’s part. Black figures, with\nwoolly mop-heads, and sometimes decorated with whitewash of lime,\ncrowded round to assist in the transport of the sick man through the\nsurf; and David himself, in a white European garb, met his guests,\nwith dignified manners that would have suited a prince of any land, and\nconducted them through the grove of palms, interspersed with white huts,\nto a beautiful house consisting of a central room, with many others\nopening from it, floored with white coral lime, and lined with soft\nshining mats of Samoan manufacture. This, Harry learned, had been\nerected by them in hopes of an English missionary taking up his abode\namongst them.\n\nThey were a kindly people, and had shown hospitality to other\nEnglishmen, who had less appreciated it than these young officers\ncould. They lavished every kindness in their power upon them, and\nMr. Ernescliffe, at first, revived so much, that he seemed likely to\nrecover.\n\nBut the ship had completed her repairs, and was ready to sail. The two\nmidshipmen thought it would be certain death to their lieutenant to\nbring him back to such an atmosphere; “and so,” continued Harry’s letter\nto his father, “I thought there was nothing for it but for me to stay\nwith him, and that you would say so. I got Owen to consent, after some\ntrouble, as we were sure to be fetched off one time or another. We said\nnot a word to Mr. Ernescliffe, for he was only sensible now and then, so\nthat Owen had the command. Owen made the skipper leave me a pistol and\nsome powder, but I was ashamed David should know it, and stowed it away.\nAs to the quarter-master, old Jennings, whose boy you remember we\npicked up at the Roman camp, he had not forgotten that, and when we were\nshaking hands and wishing good-bye, he leaped up, and vowed ‘he would\nnever leave the young gentleman that had befriended his boy, to be eaten\nup by them black savage niggers. If they made roast-pork of Mr. May, he\nwould be eaten first, though he reckoned they would find him a tougher\nmorsel.’ I don’t think Owen was sorry he volunteered, and no words can\ntell what a blessing the good old fellow was to us both.\n\n“So there we stayed, and, at first, Mr. Ernescliffe seemed mending. The\ndelirium went off, he could talk quite clearly and comfortably, and he\nused to lie listening, when David and I had our odd sort of talks. I\nbelieve, if you had been there, or we could have strengthened him any\nway, he might have got over it; but he never thought he should, and he\nused to talk to me about all of you, and said Stoneborough had been the\nmost blessed spot in his life; he had never had so much of a home, and\nthat sharing our grief, and knowing you, had done him great good, just\nwhen he might have been getting elated. I cannot recollect it all,\nthough I tried hard, for Margaret’s sake, but he said Hector would have\na great deal of temptation, and he hoped you would be a father to him,\nand Norman an elder brother. You would not think how much he talked of\nCocksmoor, about a church being built there, as Ethel wished, and little\nDaisy laying the first stone. I remember one night, I don’t know whether\nhe was quite himself, for he looked full at me with his eyes, that had\ngrown so large, till I did not know what was coming, and he said, ‘I\nhave seen a ship built by a sailor’s vow; the roof was like the timbers\nof a ship--that was right. Mind, it is so. That is the ship that bears\nthrough the waves; there is the anchor that enters within the veil.’ I\nbelieve that was what he said. I could not forget that--he looked at me\nso; but much more he said, that I dimly remember, and chiefly about poor\ndear Margaret. He bade me tell her--his own precious pearl, as he used\nto call her--that he was quite content, and believed it was best for her\nand him both, that all should be thus settled, for they did not part for\never, and he trusted--But I can’t write all that.” (There was a great\ntear-blot just here). “It is too good to recollect anywhere but at\nchurch. I have been there to-day, with my uncle and aunt, and I thought\nI could have told it when I came home, but I was too tired to write\nthen, and now I don’t seem as if it could be written anyhow. When I come\nhome, I will try to tell Margaret. The most part was about her; only\nwhat was better seemed to swallow that up.”\n\nThe narrative broke off here, but had been subsequently resumed.\n\n“For all Mr. Ernescliffe talked as I told you, he was so quiet and\nhappy, that I made sure he was getting well, but Jennings did not; and\nthere came an old heathen native once to see us, who asked why we did\nnot bury him alive, because he got no better, and gave trouble. At last,\none night--it was the third of August--he was very restless, and could\nnot breathe, nor lie easily; I lifted him up in my arms, for he was very\nlight and thin, and tried to make him more comfortable. But presently he\nsaid, ‘Is it you, Harry? God bless you;’ and, in a minute, I knew he was\ndead. You will tell Margaret all about it. I don’t think she can love\nhim more than I did; and she did not half know him, for she never saw\nhim on board, nor in all that dreadful time, nor in his illness. She\nwill never know what she has lost.”\n\nThere was another break here, and the story was continued.\n\n“We buried him the next day, where one could see the sea, close under\nthe great palm, where David hopes to have a church one of these days.\nDavid helped us, and said the Lord’s Prayer and the Glory with us there.\nI little thought, when I used to grumble at my two verses of the psalms\nevery day, when I should want the ninetieth, or how glad I should be to\nknow so many by heart, for they were such a comfort to Mr. Ernescliffe.\n\n“David got us a nice bit of wood, and Jennings carved the cross, and\nhis name, and all about him. I should have liked to have done it, but I\nknocked up after that. Jennings thinks I had a sun-stroke. I don’t know,\nbut my head was so bad, whenever I moved, that I thought only Jennings\nwould ever have come to tell you about it. Jennings looked after me as\nif I had been his own son; and there was David too, as kind as if he had\nbeen Richard himself--always sitting by, to bathe my forehead, or, when\nI was a little better, to talk to me, and ask me questions about his\nChristian teaching. You must not think of him like a savage, for he is\nmy friend, and a far more perfect gentleman than I ever saw any one,\nbut you, papa, holding the command over his people so easily and\ncourteously, and then coming to me with little easy first questions\nabout the Belief, and such things, like what we used to ask mamma. He\nliked nothing so well as for me to tell him about King David; and we had\nlearned a good deal of each other’s languages by that time. The notion\nof his heart--like Cocksmoor to Ethel--is to get a real English mission,\nand have all his people Christians. Ethel talked of good kings being\nDavids to their line; I think that is what he will be, if he lives; but\nthose islanders have been dying off since Europeans came among them.”\n\nBut Harry’s letter could not tell what he confessed, one night, to his\nfather, the next time he was out with him by starlight, how desolate he\nhad been, and how he had yearned after his home, and, one evening, he\nhad been utterly overcome by illness and loneliness, and had cried most\nbitterly and uncontrollably; and, though Jennings thought it was for\nhis friend’s death, it really was homesickness, and the thought of his\nfather and Mary. Jennings had helped him out to the entrance of the\nhut, that the cool night air might refresh his burning brow. Orion shone\nclear and bright, and brought back the night when they had chosen the\nstarry hunter as his friend. “It seemed,” he said, “as if you all\nwere looking at me, and smiling to me in the stars. And there was\nthe Southern Cross upright, which was like the minster to me; and\nI recollected it was Sunday morning at home, and knew you would be\nthinking about me. I was so glad you had let me be confirmed, and be\nwith you that last Sunday, papa, for it seemed to join me on so much the\nmore; and when I thought of the words in church, they seemed, somehow,\nto float on me so much more than ever before, and it was like the\nminster, and your voice. I should not have minded dying so much after\nthat.”\n\nAt last, Harry’s Black Prince had hurried into the hut with the tidings\nthat his English father’s ship was in the bay, and soon English voices\nagain sounded in his ears, bringing the forlorn boy such warmth of\nkindness that he could hardly believe himself a mere stranger. If Alan\ncould but have shared the joy with him!\n\nHe was carried down to the boat in the cool of the evening, and paused\non the way, for a last farewell to the lonely grave under the palm\ntree-one of the many sailors’ graves scattered from the tropics to\nthe poles, and which might be the first seed in a “God’s acre” to that\nisland, becoming what the graves of holy men of old are to us.\n\nA short space more of kind care from his new friends and his Christian\nchief, and Harry awoke from a feverish doze at sounds that seemed so\nlike a dream of home, that he was unwilling to break them by rousing\nhimself; but they approved themselves as real, and he found himself in\nthe embrace of his mother’s sister.\n\nAnd here Mrs. Arnott’s story began, of the note that reached her in the\nearly morning with tidings that her nephew had been picked up by the\nmission-ship, and how she and her husband had hastened at once on board.\n\n“They sent me below to see a hero,” she wrote. “What I saw was a\nscarecrow sort of likeness of you, dear Richard; but, when he opened his\neyes, there was our Maggie smiling at me. I suppose he would not forgive\nme for telling how he sobbed and cried, when he had his arms round my\nneck, and his poor aching head on my shoulder. Poor fellow, he was very\nweak, and I believe he felt, for the moment, as if he had found his\nmother.\n\n“We brought him home with us, but when the next mail went, the fever was\nstill so high, that I thought it would be only alarm to you to write,\nand I had not half a story either, though you may guess how proud I was\nof my nephew.”\n\nHarry’s troubles were all over from that time. He had thenceforth to\nrecover under his aunt’s motherly care, while talking endlessly over the\nhome that she loved almost as well as he did. He was well more quickly\nthan she had ventured to hope, and nothing could check his impatience to\nreach his home, not even the hopes of having his aunt for a companion.\nThe very happiness he enjoyed with her only made him long the more\nardently to be with his own family; and he had taken his leave of her,\nand of his dear David, and sailed by the first packet leaving Auckland.\n\n“I never knew what the old Great Bear was to me till I saw him again!”\n said Harry.\n\nIt was late when the elders had finished all that was to be heard at\npresent, and the clock reminded them that they must part.\n\n“And you go to-morrow?” sighed Margaret.\n\n“I must. Jennings has to go on to Portsmouth, and see after his son.”\n\n“Oh, let me see Jennings!” exclaimed Margaret. “May I not, papa?”\n\nRichard, who had been making friends with Jennings, whenever he had not\nbeen needed by his sisters that afternoon, went to fetch him from the\nkitchen, where all the servants, and all their particular friends,\nwere listening to the yarn that made them hold their heads higher, as\nbelonging to Master Harry.\n\nHarry stepped forward, met Jennings, and said, aside, “My sister,\nJennings; my sister that you have heard of.”\n\nDr. May had already seen the sailor, but he could not help addressing\nhim again. “Come in; come in, and see my boy among us all. Without you,\nwe never should have had him.”\n\n“Make him come to me,” said Margaret breathlessly, as the embarrassed\nsailor stood, sleeking down his hair; and, when he had advanced to her\ncouch, she looked up in his face, and put her hand into his great brown\none.\n\n“I could not help saying thank you,” she said.\n\n“Mr. May, sir!” cried Jennings, almost crying, and looking round for\nHarry, as a sort of protector--“tell them, sir, please, it was only my\nduty--I could not do no less, and you knows it, sir,” as if Harry had\nbeen making an accusation against him.\n\n“We know you could not,” said Margaret, “and that is what we would thank\nyou for, if we could. I know he--Mr. Ernescliffe--must have been much\nmore at rest for leaving my brother with so kind a friend, and--”\n\n“Please, miss, don’t say no more about it. Mr. Ernescliffe was as fine\nan officer as ever stepped a quarter-deck, and Mr. May here won’t fall\nshort of him; and was I to be after leaving the like of them to the\nmercy of the black fellows--that was not so bad neither? If it had only\npleased God that we had brought them both back to you, miss; but, you\nsee, a man can’t be everything at once, and Mr. Ernescliffe was not so\nstout as his heart.”\n\n“You did everything, we know--” began Dr. May.\n\n“‘Twas a real pleasure,” said Jennings hastily, “for two such real\ngentlemen as they was. Mr. May, sir, I beg your pardon if I say it to\nyour face, never flinched, nor spoke a word of complaint, through it\nall; and, as to the other--”\n\n“Margaret cannot bear this,” said Richard, coming near. “It is too\nmuch.”\n\nThe sailor shook his head, and was retreating, but Margaret signed him\nto come near again, and grasped his hand. Harry followed him out of the\nroom, to arrange their journey, and presently returned.\n\n“He says he is glad he has seen Margaret; he says she is the right sort\nof stuff for Mr. Ernescliffe.”\n\nHarry had not intended Margaret to hear, but she caught the words,\nsmiled radiantly, and whispered, “I wish I may be!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n\nMargaret had borne the meeting much too well for her own good, and a\nwakeful night of palpitation was the consequence; but she would not\nallow any one to take it to heart, and declared that she should be ready\nto enjoy Harry by the time he should return, and meantime, she should\ndwell on the delight of his meeting Flora.\n\nNo one had rested too soundly that night, and Dr. May had not been\nable to help looking in at his sleeping boy at five in the morning,\nto certify himself that he had not only figured his present bliss to\nhimself, in his ten minutes’ dream. And looking in again at half-past\nseven, he found Harry half dressed, with his arm round Mary; laughing,\nalmost sobbing, over the treasures in his cupboard, which he had newly\ndiscovered in their fresh order.\n\nDr. May looked like a new man that morning, with his brightened eye and\nbearing, as if there were a well-spring of joy within him, ready to brim\nover at once in tear and in smile, and finding an outlet in the praise\nand thanksgiving that his spirit chanted, and his face expressed, and in\nthat sunny genial benevolence that must make all share his joy.\n\nHe was going to run over half the town--every one would like to hear\nit from him; Ethel and Mary must go to the rest--the old women in the\nalmshouses, where lived an old cook who used to be fond of Harry--they\nshould have a feast; all who were well enough in the hospital should\nhave a tea-drinking; Dr. Hoxton had already granted a holiday to the\nschool; every boy with whom they had any connection should come to\ndinner, and Edward Anderson should be asked to meet Harry on his return,\nbecause, poor fellow, he was so improved.\n\nDr. May was in such a transport of kind-hearted schemes, that he was\nnot easily made to hear that Harry had not a sixpence wherewith to reach\nLondon.\n\nEthel, meanwhile, was standing beside her brother tendering to him some\ngold, as his last quarter.\n\n“How did you get it, Ethel? do you keep the purse?”\n\n“No, but papa took Cocksmoor in your stead, when--”\n\n“Nonsense, Ethel,” said Harry; “I don’t want it. Have I not all my\npay and allowance for the whole time I was dead? And as to robbing\nCocksmoor--”\n\n“Yes, keep it, Ethel,” said her father; “do you think I would take it\nnow, when if there were a thank-offering in the world.--And, by the bye,\nyour Cocksmoor children must have something to remember this by--”\n\nEvery one could have envied Norman, for travelling to London with Harry,\nbut that he must proceed to Oxford in two days, when Harry would return\nto them. The station-master, thinking he could not do enough for the\nreturned mariner, put the two brothers into the coupe, as if they had\nbeen a bridal couple, and they were very glad of the privacy, having, as\nyet, hardly spoken to each other, when Harry’s attention was dispersed\namong so many.\n\nNorman asked many questions about the mission work in the southern\nhemisphere, and ended by telling his brother of his design, which met\nwith Harry’s hearty approbation.\n\n“That’s right, old June. There’s nothing they want so much, as such as\nyou. How glad my aunt will be! Perhaps you will see David! Oh, if you\nwere to go out to the Loyalty group!”\n\n“Very possibly I might,” said Norman.\n\n“Tell them you are my brother, and how they will receive you! I can see\nthe mop-heads they will dress in honour of you, and what a feast of pork\nand yams you will have to eat! But there is plenty of work among the\nMaoris for you--they want a clergyman terribly at the next village to\nmy uncle’s place. I say, Norman, it will go hard if I don’t get a ship\nbound for the Pacific, and come and see you.”\n\n“I shall reckon on you. That is, if I have not to stay to help my\nfather.”\n\n“To be sure,” exclaimed Harry; “I thought you would have stayed at home,\nand married little Miss Rivers!”\n\nThus broadly and boyishly did he plunge into that most tender subject,\nmaking his brother start and wince, as if he had touched a wound.\n\n“Nonsense!” he cried, almost angrily.\n\n“Well! you used to seem very much smitten, but so, to be sure, were\nsome of the Alcestes with the young ladies at Valparaiso. How we used to\nroast Owen about that Spanish Donna, and he was as bad at Sydney about\nthe young lady whose father, we told him, was a convict, though he kept\nsuch a swell carriage. He had no peace about his father-in-law, the\nhouse-breaker! Don’t I remember how you pinched her hand the night you\nwere righted!”\n\n“You know nothing about it,” said Norman shortly. “She is far beyond my\nreach.”\n\n“A fine lady? Ha! Well, I should have thought you as good as Flora any\nday,” said Harry indignantly.\n\n“She is what she always was,” said Norman, anxious to silence him; “but\nit is unreasonable to think of it. She is all but engaged to Sir Henry\nWalkinghame.”\n\n“Walkinghame!” cried the volatile sailor. “I have half a mind to send in\nmy name to Flora as Miss Walkinghame!” and he laughed heartily over that\nadventure, ending, however, with a sigh, as he said, “It had nearly cost\nme a great deal! But tell me, Norman, how has that Meta, as they called\nher, turned out? I never saw anything prettier or nicer than she was\nthat day of the Roman encampment, and I should be sorry if that fine\nfashionable aunt of hers, had made her stuck-up and disdainful.”\n\n“No such thing,” said Norman.\n\n“Ha!” said Harry to himself, “I see how it is! She has gone and made\npoor old June unhappy, with her scornful airs--a little impertinent\npuss!--I wonder Flora does not teach her better manners.”\n\nNorman, meanwhile, as the train sped over roofs, and among chimneys, was\nreproaching himself for running into the fascination of her presence,\nand then recollecting that her situation, as well as his destiny, both\nguaranteed that they could meet only as friendly connections.\n\nNo carriage awaited them at the station, which surprised Norman, till\nhe recollected that the horses had probably been out all day, and it was\neight o’clock. Going to Park Lane in a cab, the brothers were further\nsurprised to find themselves evidently not expected. The butler came to\nspeak to them, saying that Mr. and Mrs. Rivers were gone out to dinner,\nbut would return, probably, at about eleven o’clock. He conducted\nthem upstairs, Harry following his brother, in towering vexation and\ndisappointment, trying to make him turn to hear that they would go\ndirectly--home--to Eton--anywhere--why would he go in at all?\n\nThe door was opened, Mr. May was announced, and they were in a\nsilk-lined boudoir, where a little slender figure in black started up,\nand came forward with outstretched hand.\n\n“Norman!” she cried, “how are you? Are you come on your way to Oxford?”\n\n“Has not Flora had Mary’s letter?”\n\n“Yes, she said she had one. She was keeping it till she had time to read\nit.”\n\nAs she spoke, Meta had given her hand to Harry, as it was evidently\nexpected; she raised her eyes to his face, and said, smiling’ and\nblushing, “I am sure I ought to know you, but I am afraid I don’t.”\n\n“Look again,” said Norman. “See if you have ever seen him before.”\n\nLaughing, glancing, and casting down her eyes, she raised them with a\nsudden start of joy, but colouring more deeply, said, “Indeed, I cannot\nremember. I dare say I ought.”\n\n“I think you see a likeness,” said Norman.\n\n“Oh, yes, I see,” she answered, faltering; but perceiving how bright\nwere the looks of both, “No? Impossible! Yes, it is!”\n\n“Yes, it is,” said both brothers with one voice. She clasped her hands,\nabsolutely bounded with transport, then grasped both Harry’s hands,\nand then Norman’s, her whole countenance radiant with joy and sympathy\nbeyond expression.\n\n“Dear, dear Dr. May!” was her first exclamation. “Oh, how happy you must\nall be! And Margaret?” She looked up at Norman, and came nearer. “Is not\nMr. Ernescliffe come?” she asked softly, and trembling.\n\n“No,” was the low answer, which Harry could not bear to hear, and\ntherefore walked to the window. “No, Meta, but Margaret is much\ncomforted about him. He died in great peace--in his arms”--as he signed\ntowards his brother. And as Harry continued to gaze out on the stars of\ngas on the opposite side of the park, he was able to add a few of the\nparticulars.\n\nMeta’s eyes glistened with tears, as she said, “Perhaps it would have\nbeen too perfect if he had come; but oh, Norman! how good she is to bear\nit so patiently! And how gloriously he behaved! How can we make enough\nof him! And Flora out! how sorry she will be!”\n\n“And she never opened Mary’s letter,” said Harry, coming back to them.\n\n“She little thought what it contained,” said Meta. “Mary’s letters are\napt to bear keeping, you know, and she was so busy, that she laid it\naside for a treat after the day’s work. But there! inhospitable wretch\nthat I am! you have had no dinner!”\n\nA refection of tea and cold meat was preferred, and in her own pretty\nmanner Meta lavished her welcomes, trying to cover any pain given by\nFlora’s neglect.\n\n“What makes her so busy?” asked Harry, looking round on the beautifully\nfurnished apartment, which, to many eyes besides those fresh from a\nMilanesian hut, might have seemed a paradise of luxurious ease.\n\n“You don’t know what an important lady you have for a sister,” said Meta\nmerrily.\n\n“But tell me, what can she have to do? I thought you London ladies\nhad nothing to do, but to sit with your hands before you entertaining\ncompany.”\n\nMeta laughed heartily. “Shall I begin at the beginning? I’ll describe\nto-day then, and you must understand that this is what Tom would call a\nmild specimen--only one evening engagement. Though, perhaps, I ought to\nstart from last night at twelve o’clock, when she was at the Austrian\nAmbassador’s ball, and came home at two; but she was up by eight--she\nalways manages to get through her housekeeping matters before breakfast.\nAt nine, breakfast, and baby--by the bye, you have never inquired for\nour niece.”\n\n“I have not come to believe in her yet,” said Harry.\n\n“Seeing is believing,” said Meta; “but no, I won’t take an unfair\nadvantage over her mamma; and she will be fast asleep; I never knew a\nchild sleep as she does. So to go on with our day. The papers come, and\nMiss Leonora is given over to me; for you must know we are wonderful\npoliticians. Flora studies all the debates till George finds out what\nhe has heard in the House, and baby and I profit. Baby goes out walking,\nand the post comes. Flora always goes to the study with George, and\nwrites, and does all sorts of things for him. She is the most useful\nwife in the world. At twelve, we had our singing lesson--”\n\n“Singing lesson!” exclaimed Harry.\n\n“Yes, you know she has a pretty voice, and she is glad to cultivate it.\nIt is very useful at parties, but it takes up a great deal of time,\nand with all I can do to save her in note-writing, the morning is gone\ndirectly. After luncheon, she had to ride with George, and came back in\na hurry to make some canvassing calls about the orphan asylum, and Miss\nBracy’s sister. If we get her in at all, it will be Flora’s diplomacy.\nAnd there was shopping to do, and when we came in hoping for time for\nour letters, there were the Walkinghames, who stayed a long time, so\nthat Flora could only despatch the most important notes, before George\ncame in and wanted her. She was reading something for him all the time\nshe was dressing, but, as I say, this is quite a quiet day.”\n\n“Stop!” cried Harry, with a gesture of oppression, “it sounds harder\nthan cleaning knives, like Aunt Flora! And what is an unquiet day like?”\n\n“You will see, for we have a great evening party to-morrow.”\n\n“Do you always stay at home?” asked Harry.\n\n“Not always, but I do not go to large parties or balls this year,” said\nMeta, glancing at her deep mourning; “I am very glad of a little time at\nhome.”\n\n“So you don’t like it.”\n\n“Oh, yes! it is very pleasant,” said Meta. “It is so entertaining when\nwe talk it over afterwards, and I like to hear how Flora is admired, and\ncalled the beauty of the season. I tell George, and we do so gloat over\nit together! There was an old French marquis the other night, a dear\nold man, quite of the ancien regime, who said she was exactly like the\nportraits of Madame de Maintenon, and produced a beautiful miniature on\na snuff-box, positively like that very pretty form of face of hers.\nThe old man even declared that Mistress Rivers was worthy to be a\nFrenchwoman.”\n\n“I should like to kick him!” amiably responded Harry.\n\n“I hope you won’t to-morrow! But don’t let us waste our time over this;\nI want so much to hear about New Zealand.”\n\nMeta was well read in Australasian literature, and drew out a great deal\nmore information from Harry than Norman had yet heard. She made him talk\nabout the Maori pah near his uncle’s farm, where the Sunday services\nwere conducted by an old gentleman tattooed elegantly in the face, but\ndressed like an English clergyman; and tell of his aunt’s troubles about\nthe younger generation, whom their elders, though Christians themselves,\ncould not educate, and who she feared would relapse into heathenism, for\nwant of instruction, though with excellent dispositions.\n\n“How glad you must be that you are likely to go!” exclaimed Meta to\nNorman, who had sat silently listening.\n\nThe sound of the door bell was the first intimation that Harry’s\nhistories had occupied them until long past twelve o’clock.\n\n“Now, then!” cried Meta, springing forward, as if intending to meet\nFlora with the tidings, but checking herself, as if she ought not to\nbe the first. There was a pause. Flora was hearing downstairs that Mr.\nNorman May and another gentleman had arrived, and, while vexed at her\nown omission, and annoyed at Norman’s bringing friends without waiting\nfor permission, she was yet prepared to be courteous and amiable. She\nentered in her rich black watered silk, deeply trimmed with lace,\nand with silver ornaments in her dark hair, so graceful and\ndistinguished-looking, that Harry stood suspended, hesitating, for an\ninstant, whether he beheld his own sister, especially as she made a\ndignified inclination towards him, offering her hand to Norman, as she\nsaid, “Meta has told you--” But there she broke off, exclaiming, “Ha! is\nit possible! No, surely it cannot be--”\n\n“Miss Walkinghame?” said the sailor, who had felt at home with her at\nthe first word, and she flew into his great rough arms.\n\n“Harry! this is dear Harry! our own dear sailor come back,” cried she,\nas her husband stood astonished; and, springing towards him, she put\nHarry’s hand into his, “My brother Harry! our dear lost one.”\n\n“Your--brother--Harry,” slowly pronounced George, as he instinctively\ngave the grasp of greeting--“your brother that was lost? Upon my word,”\n as the matter dawned fully on him, and he became eager, “I am very glad\nto see you. I never was more rejoiced in my life.”\n\n“When did you come? Have you been at home?” asked Flora.\n\n“I came home yesterday--Mary wrote to tell you.”\n\n“Poor dear old Mary! There’s a lesson against taking a letter on trust.\nI thought it would be all Cocksmoor, and would wait for a quiet moment!\nHow good to come to me so soon, you dear old shipwrecked mariner!”\n\n“I was forced to come to report myself,” said Harry, “or I could not\nhave come away from my father so soon.”\n\nThe usual questions and their sad answers ensued, and while Flora talked\nto Harry, fondly holding his hand, Norman and Meta explained the history\nto George, who no sooner comprehended it, that he opined it must have\nbeen a horrid nuisance, and that Harry was a gallant fellow; then\nstriking him over the shoulder, welcomed him home with all his kind\nheart, told him he was proud to receive him, and falling into a state of\nrapturous hospitality, rang the bell, and wanted to order all sorts\nof eatables and drinkables, but was sadly baffled to find him already\nsatisfied.\n\nThere was more open joy than even at home, and Flora was supremely happy\nas she sat between her brothers, listening and inquiring till far past\none o’clock, when she perceived poor George dozing off, awakened every\nnow and then by a great nod, and casting a wishful glance of resigned\nremonstrance, as if to appeal against sitting up all night.\n\nThe meeting at breakfast was a renewal of pleasure. Flora was proud and\nhappy in showing off her little girl, a model baby, as she called her,\na perfect doll for quietness, so that she could be brought in at family\nprayers; “and,” said Flora, “I am the more glad that she keeps no\none away, because we can only have evening prayers on Sunday. It is a\nserious thing to arrange for such a household.”\n\n“She is equal to anything,” said George.\n\nThe long file of servants marched in, George read sonorously, and Flora\nrose from her knees, highly satisfied at the impression produced upon\nher brothers.\n\n“I like to have the baby with us at breakfast,” she said; “it is the\nonly time of day when we can be sure of seeing anything of her, and I\nlike her nurse to have some respite. Do you think her grown, Norman?”\n\n“Not very much,” said Norman, who thought her more inanimate and like\na pretty little waxen toy, than when he had last seen her. “Is she not\nrather pale?”\n\n“London makes children pale. I shall soon take her home to acquire a\nlittle colour. You must know Sir Henry has bitten us with his yachting\ntastes, and as soon as we can leave London, we are going to spend six\nweeks with the Walkinghames at Ryde, and rival you, Harry. I think Miss\nLeonora will be better at home, so we must leave her there. Lodgings and\nirregularities don’t suit people of her age.”\n\n“Does home mean Stoneborough?” asked Norman.\n\n“No. Old nurse has one of her deadly prejudices against Preston, and I\nwould not be responsible for the consequences of shutting them up in the\nsame nursery. Margaret would be distracted between them. No, miss, you\nshall make her a visit every day, and be fondled by your grandpapa.”\n\nGeorge began a conversation with Harry on nautical matters, and Norman\ntried to discover how Meta liked the yachting project, and found her\nprepared to think it charming. Hopes were expressed that Harry might be\nat Portsmouth, and a quantity of gay scheming ensued, with reiterations\nof the name of Walkinghame; while Norman had a sense of being wrapped\nin some gray mist, excluding him from participation in their enjoyments,\nand condemned his own temper as frivolous for being thus excited to\ndiscontent.\n\nPresently, he heard George insisting that he and Harry should return in\ntime for the evening party; and, on beginning to refuse, was amazed to\nfind Harry’s only objection was on the score of lack of uniform.\n\n“I don’t want you in one, sir,” said Flora.\n\n“I have only one coat in the world, besides this,” continued Harry, “and\nthat is all over tar.”\n\n“George will see to that,” said Flora. “Don’t you think you would be\nwelcome in matting, with an orange cowry round your neck?”\n\nNorman, however, took a private opportunity of asking Harry if he was\naware of what he was undertaking, and what kind of people they should\nmeet.\n\n“All English people behave much the same in a room,” said Harry, as if\nall society, provided it was not cannibal, were alike to him.\n\n“I should have thought you would prefer finding out Forder in his\nchambers, or going to one of the theatres.”\n\n“As you please,” said Harry; “but Flora seems to want us, and I should\nrather like to see what sort of company she keeps.”\n\nSince Harry was impervious to shyness, Norman submitted, and George took\nthem to a wonder-worker in cloth, who undertook that full equipments\nshould await the young gentleman. Harry next despatched his business at\nthe Admiralty, and was made very happy by tidings of his friend Owen’s\nsafe arrival in America.\n\nThence the brothers went to Eton, where home letters had been more\nregarded; and Dr. May having written to secure a holiday for the objects\nof their visit, they were met at the station by the two boys. Hector’s\nred face and prominent light eyebrows were instantly recognised; but, as\nto Tom, Harry could hardly believe that the little, dusty, round-backed\ngrub be had left had been transformed into the well-made gentlemanlike\nlad before him, peculiarly trim and accurate in dress, even to the\nextent of as much foppery as Eton taste permitted.\n\nTen minutes had not passed before Tom, taking a survey of the newcomer,\nbegan to exclaim at Norman, for letting him go about such a figure; and,\nbefore they knew what was doing, they had all been conducted into the\nshop of the “only living man who knew how to cut hair.” Laughing and\ngood-natured, Harry believed his hair was “rather long,” allowed himself\nto be seated, and to be divested of a huge superfluous mass of sun-dried\ncurls, which Tom, particularly resenting that “rather long,” kept on\ntaking up, and unrolling from their tight rings, to measure the number\nof inches.\n\n“That is better,” said he, as they issued from the shop; “but, as to\nthat coat of yours, the rogue who made it should never make another.\nWhere could you have picked it up?”\n\n“At a shop at Auckland,” said Harry, much amused.\n\n“Kept by a savage?” said Tom, to whom it was no laughing matter. “See\nthat seam!”\n\n“Have done, May!” exclaimed Hector. “He will think you a tailor’s\napprentice!”\n\n“Or worse,” said Norman. “Rivers’s tailor kept all strictures to\nhimself.”\n\nTom muttered that he only wanted Harry to be fit to be seen by the\nfellows.\n\n“The fellows are not such asses as you!” cried Hector. “You don’t\ndeserve that he should come to see you. If my--”\n\nThere poor Hector broke off. If his own only brother had been walking\nbeside him, how would he not have felt? They had reached their tutor’s\nhouse, and, opening his own door, he made an imploring sign to Harry\nto enter with him. On the table lay a letter from Margaret, and another\nwhich Harry had written to him from Auckland.\n\n“Oh, Harry, you were with him,” he said; “tell me all about him.”\n\nAnd he established himself, with his face hidden on the table,\nuttering nothing, except, “Go on,” whenever Harry’s voice failed in the\nnarration. When something was said of “all for the best,” he burst out,\n“He might say so. I suppose one ought to think so. But is not it hard,\nwhen I had nobody but him? And there was Maplewood; and I might have\nbeen so happy there, with him and Margaret.”\n\n“They say nothing could have made Margaret well,” said Harry.\n\n“I don’t care; he would have married her all the same, and we should\nhave made her so happy at Maplewood. I hate the place! I wish it were at\nJericho!”\n\n“You are captain of the ship now,” said Harry, “and you must make the\nbest of it.”\n\n“I can’t. It will never be home. Home is with Margaret, and the rest of\nthem.”\n\n“So Alan said he hoped you would make it; and you are just like one of\nus, you know.”\n\n“What’s the use of that, when Captain Gordon will not let me go near\nyou. Taking me to that abominable Maplewood last Easter, with half the\nhouse shut up, and all horrid! And he is as dry as a stick!”\n\n“The captain!” cried Harry angrily. “There’s not a better captain to\nsail with in the whole navy, and your brother would be the first to tell\nyou so! I’m not discharged yet. Hector--you had better look out what you\nsay!”\n\n“Maybe he is the best to sail with, but that is not being the best to\nlive with,” said the heir of Maplewood disconsolately. “Alan himself\nalways said he never knew what home was, till he got to your father and\nMargaret.”\n\n“So will you,” said Harry; “why, my father is your master, or whatever\nyou may call it.”\n\n“No, Captain Gordon is my guardian.”\n\n“Eh! what’s become of the will then?”\n\n“What will?” cried Hector. “Did Alan make one after all?”\n\n“Ay. At Valparaiso, he had a touch of fever; I went ashore to nurse\nhim, to a merchant’s, who took us in for love of our Scottish blood. Mr.\nErnescliffe made a will there, and left it in his charge.”\n\n“Do you think he made Dr. May my guardian?”\n\n“He asked me whether I thought he would dislike it, and I told him, no.”\n\n“That’s right!” cried Hector. “That’s like dear old Alan! I shall\nget back to the doctor and Margaret after all. Mind you write to the\ncaptain, Harry!”\n\nHector was quite inspirited and ready to return to the others, but Harry\npaused to express a hope that he did not let Tom make such a fool of\nhimself as he had done to-day.\n\n“Not he,” said Hector. “He is liked as much as any one in the house--he\nhas been five times sent up for good. See there in the Eton list! He is\na real clever fellow.”\n\n“Ay, but what’s the good of all that, if you let him be a puppy?”\n\n“Oh, he’ll be cured. A fellow that has been a sloven always is a puppy\nfor a bit,” said Hector philosophically.\n\nNorman was meantime taking Tom to task for these same airs, and, hearing\nit was from the desire to see his brother respectable--Stoneborough men\nnever cared for what they looked like, and he must have Harry do himself\ncredit.\n\n“You need not fear,” said Norman. “He did not require Eton to make him a\ngentleman. How now? Why, Tom, old man, you are not taking that to heart?\nThat’s all over long ago.”\n\nFor that black spot in his life had never passed out of the lad’s\nmemory, and it might be from the lurking want of self-respect that there\nwas about him so much of self-assertion, in attention to trifles. He\nwas very reserved, and no one except Norman had ever found the way to\nanything like confidence, and Norman had vexed him by the proposal he\nhad made in the holidays.\n\nHe made no answer, but stood looking at Norman with an odd undecided\ngaze.\n\n“Well, what now, old fellow?” said Norman, half fearing “that” might not\nbe absolutely over. “One would think you were not glad to see Harry.”\n\n“I suppose he has made you all the more set upon that mad notion of\nyours,” said Tom.\n\n“So far as making me feel that that part of the world has a strong claim\non us,” replied Norman.\n\n“I’m sure you don’t look as if you found your pleasure in it,” cried\nTom.\n\n“Pleasure is not what I seek,” said Norman.\n\n“What is the matter with you?” said Tom. “You said I did not seem\nrejoiced--you look worse, I am sure.” Tom put his arm on Norman’s\nshoulder, and looked solicitously at him--demonstrations of affection\nvery rare with him.\n\n“I wonder which would really make you happiest, to have your own way,\nand go to these black villains--”\n\n“Remember, that but for others who have done so, Harry--”\n\n“Pshaw,” said Tom, rubbing some invisible dust from his coat sleeve. “If\nit would keep you at home, I would say I never would hear of doctoring.”\n\n“I thought you had said so.”\n\n“What’s the use of my coming here, if I’m to be a country doctor?”\n\n“I have told you I do not mean to victimise you. If you have a distaste\nto it, there’s an end of it--I am quite ready.”\n\nTom gave a great sigh. “No,” he said, “if I must, I must; I don’t mind\nthe part of it that you do. I only hate the name of it, and the being\ntied down to a country place like that, while you go out thousands of\nmiles off to these savages; but if it is the only thing to content you,\nI wont stand in your way. I can’t bear your looking disconsolate.”\n\n“Don’t think yourself bound, if you really dislike the profession.”\n\n“I don’t,” said Tom. “It is my free choice. If it were not for horrid\nsick people, I should like it.”\n\nPromising! it must be confessed!\n\nPerhaps Tom had expected Norman to brighten at once, but it was a\nfallacious hope. The gaining his point involved no pleasant prospect,\nand his young brother’s moody devotion to him suggested scruples whether\nhe ought to exact the sacrifice, though, in his own mind, convinced\nthat it was Tom’s vocation; and knowing that would give him many of the\nadvantages of an eldest son.\n\nEton fully justified Hector’s declaration that it would not regard the\ncut of Harry’s coat. The hero of a lost ship and savage isle was the\nobject of universal admiration and curiosity, and inestimable were the\nfavours conferred by Hector and Tom in giving introductions to him, till\nhe had shaken hands with half the school, and departed amid deafening\ncheers.\n\nIn spite of Harry, the day had been long and heavy to Norman, and though\nhe chid himself for his depression, he shrank from the sight of Meta and\nSir Henry Walkinghame together, and was ready to plead an aching head as\nan excuse for not appearing at the evening party; but, besides that this\nmight attract notice, he thought himself bound to take care of Harry in\nso new a world, where the boy must be at a great loss.\n\n“I say, old June,” cried a voice at his door, “are you ready?”\n\n“I have not begun dressing yet. Will you wait?”\n\n“Not I. The fun is beginning.”\n\nNorman heard the light foot scampering downstairs, and prepared to\nfollow, to assume the protection of him.\n\nMusic sounded as Norman left his room, and he turned aside to avoid the\nstream of company flowing up the flower-decked stairs, and made his way\ninto the rooms through Flora’s boudoir. He was almost dazzled by the\nbright lights, and the gay murmurs of the brilliant throng. Young ladies\nwith flowers and velvet streamers down their backs, old ladies portly\nand bejewelled, gentlemen looking civil, abounded wherever he turned his\neyes. He could see Flora’s graceful head bending as she received guest\nafter guest, and the smile with which she answered congratulations on\nher brother’s return; but Harry he did not so quickly perceive, and he\nwas trying to discover in what corner he might have hidden himself, when\nMeta stood beside him, asking whether their Eton journey had prospered,\nand how poor Hector was feeling at Harry’s return.\n\n“Where is Harry?” asked Norman. “Is he not rather out of his element?”\n\n“No, indeed,” said Meta, smiling. “Why, he is the lion of the night!”\n\n“Poor fellow, how he must hate it!”\n\n“Come this way, into the front room. There, look at him--is it not nice\nto see him, so perfectly simple and at his ease, neither shy nor elated?\nAnd what a fine-looking fellow he is!”\n\nMeta might well say so. The trim, well-knit, broad-chested form, the\nrosy embrowned honest face, the shining light-brown curly locks, the\ndancing well-opened blue eyes, and merry hearty smile showed to the best\nadvantage, in array that even Tom would not have spurned, put on with\nnaval neatness; and his attitude and manner were so full of manly ease,\nthat it was no wonder that every eye rested on him with pleasure. Norman\nsmiled at his own mistake, and asked who were the lady and gentleman\nconversing with him. Meta mentioned one of the most distinguished of\nEnglish names, and shared his amusement in seeing Harry talking to\nthem with the same frank unembarrassed ease as when he had that morning\nshaken hands with their son, in the capacity of Hector Ernescliffe’s\nfag. No one present inspired him with a tithe of the awe he felt for a\npost-captain--it was simply a pleasant assembly of good-natured folks,\nglad to welcome home a battered sailor, and of pretty girls, for whom he\nhad a sailor’s admiration, but without forwardness or presumption--all\nin happy grateful simplicity.\n\n“I suppose you cannot dance?” said Flora to him.\n\n“I!” was Harry’s interjection; and while she was looking round for a\npartner to whom to present him, he had turned to the young daughter of\nhis new acquaintance, and had her on his arm, unconscious that George\nhad been making his way to her.\n\nFlora was somewhat uneasy, but the mother was looking on smiling, and\nexpressed her delight in the young midshipman; and Mrs. Rivers, while\nlistening gladly to his praises, watched heedfully, and was reassured\nto see that dancing was as natural to him as everything else; his steps\nwere light as a feather, his movement all freedom and joy, without being\nboisterous, and his boyish chivalry as pretty a sight as any one could\nwish to see.\n\nIf the rest of the world enjoyed their dances a quarter as much as did\n“Mr. May,” they were enviable people, and he contributed not a little\nto their pleasure, if merely by the sight of his blithe freshness and\nspirited simplicity, as well as the general sympathy with his sister’s\njoy, and the interest in his adventures. He would have been a general\nfavourite, if he had been far less personally engaging; as it was, every\nyoung lady was in raptures at dancing with him, and he did his best to\ndance with them all; and to try to stir up Norman, who, after Meta\nhad been obliged to leave him, and go to act her share of the part of\nhostess, had disposed of himself against a wall, where he might live out\nthe night.\n\n“Ha! June! what makes you stand sentry there? Come and dance, and have\nsome of the fun! Some of these girls are the nicest partners in the\nworld. There’s that Lady Alice, something with the dangling things\nin her hair, sitting down now--famous at a polka. Come along, I’ll\nintroduce you. It will do you good.”\n\n“I know nothing of dancing,” said Norman, beginning to apprehend that he\nmight be dragged off, as often he had been to cricket or football, and\nby much the same means.\n\n“Comes by nature, when you hear the music. Ha! what a delicious polka!\nCome along, or I must be off! She will be waiting for me, and she is the\nsecond prettiest girl here! Come!”\n\n“I have been trying to make something of him, Harry,” said the\nubiquitous Flora, “but I don’t know whether it is mauvaise honte, or\nheadache.”\n\n“I see! Poor old June!” cried Harry. “I’ll get you an ice at once, old\nfellow! Nothing like one for setting a man going!”\n\nBefore Norman could protest, Harry had flown off.\n\n“Flora,” asked Norman, “is--are the Walkinghames here?”\n\n“Yes. Don’t you see Sir Henry. That fine-looking man with the black\nmoustache. I want you to know him. He is a great admirer of your prize\npoem and of Dr. Spencer.”\n\nHarry returning, administered his ice, and then darted off to excuse\nhimself to his partner, by explanations about his brother, whom\neverybody must have heard of, as he was the cleverest fellow living, and\nhad written the best prize poem ever heard at Oxford. He firmly believed\nNorman a much greater lion than himself.\n\nNorman was forced to leave his friendly corner to dispose of the glass\nof his ice, and thus encountered Miss Rivers, of whom Sir Henry was\nasking questions about a beautiful collection of cameos, which Flora had\nlaid out as a company trap.\n\n“Here is Norman May,” said Meta; “he knows them better than I do. Do you\nremember which of these is the head of Diana, Norman?”\n\nHaving set the two gentlemen to discuss them, she glided away on fresh\nhospitable duties, while Norman repeated the comments that he had so\nenjoyed hearing from poor Mr. Rivers, hoping he was, at least, sparing\nMeta some pain, and wondering that Flora should have risked hurting her\nfeelings by exposing these treasures to the general gaze.\n\nIf Norman were wearied by Sir Henry, it was his own fault, for the\nbaronet was a very agreeable person, who thought a first-class man worth\ncultivation, so that the last half-hour might have compensated for all\nthe rest, if conversation were always the test.\n\n“Why, Meta,” cried Harry, coming up to her, “you have not once danced!\nWe are a sort of brother and sister, to be sure, but that is no\nhindrance, is it?”\n\n“No,” said Meta, smiling, “thank you, Harry, but you must find some one\nmore worthy. I do not dance this season; at least, not in public. When\nwe get home, who knows what we may do?”\n\n“You don’t dance! Poor little Meta! And you don’t go out! What a pity!”\n\n“I had rather not work quite so hard,” said Meta. “Think what good\nfortune I had by staying at home last night!”\n\n“I declare!” exclaimed Harry, bewitched by the beaming congratulation\nof her look, “I can’t imagine why Norman had said you had turned into a\nfine lady! I can’t see a bit of it!”\n\n“Norman said I had turned into a fine lady!” repeated Meta. “Why?”\n\n“Never mind! I don’t think so; you are just like papa’s humming-bird, as\nyou always were, not a bit more of a fine lady than any girl here, and I\nam sure papa would say so. Only old June had got a bad headache, and is\nin one of his old dumps, such as I hoped he had left off. But he can’t\nhelp it, poor fellow, and he will come out of it, by and by--so never\nmind. Hallo! why people are going away already. There’s that girl\nwithout any one to hand her downstairs.”\n\nAway ran Harry, and presently the brothers and sisters gathered round\nthe fire--George declaring that he was glad that nuisance was so well\nover, and Harry exclaiming, “Well done, Flora! It was capital fun! I\nnever saw a lot of prettier or more good-natured people in my life. If\nI am at home for the Stoneborough ball, I wonder whether my father will\nlet me go to it.”\n\nThis result of Harry’s successful debut in high life struck his sister\nand Norman as so absurd that both laughed.\n\n“What’s the matter now?” asked Harry.\n\n“Your comparing Flora’s party to a Stoneborough ball,” said Norman.\n\n“It is all the same, isn’t it?” said Harry. “I’m sure you are equally\ndisgusted at both!”\n\n“Much you know about it,” said Flora, patting him gaily. “I’m not going\nto put conceit in that lion head of yours, but you were as good as an\nIndian prince to my party. Do you know to whom you have been talking so\ncoolly?”\n\n“Of course. You see, Norman, it is just as I told you. All civilised\npeople are just alike when they get into a drawing-room.”\n\n“Harry takes large views of the Genus homo,” Norman exerted himself to\nsay. “Being used to the black and brown species, he takes little heed of\nthe lesser varieties.”\n\n“It is enough for him that he does not furnish the entertainment in\nanother way,” said Flora. “But, good-night. Meta, you look tired.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\n\n    Let none, henceforward, shrink from daring dreams,\n    For earnest hearts shall find their dreams fulfilled.--FOUQUE.\n\n\n“I have it!” began Harry, as he came down to breakfast. “I don’t\nknow how I came to forget it. The will was to be sent home to Mr.\nMackintosh’s English partner. I’ll go and overhaul him this very\nmorning. They won’t mind my coming by a later train, when there is such\na reason.”\n\n“What is his name? Where shall you find him?” asked Flora.\n\n“I can’t be sure; but you’ve a navy list of that sort of cattle, have\nnot you, Flora? I’ll hunt him up.”\n\nFlora supposed he meant a directory; and all possible South American\nmerchants having been overlooked, and the Mackintoshes selected, he next\nrequired a chart of London, and wanted to attempt self-navigation, but\nwas forced to accept of George’s brougham and escort; Flora would not\ntrust him otherwise; and Norman was obliged to go to Oxford at once,\nhurrying off to his train before breakfast was over.\n\nFlora might have trusted Harry alone. George contributed no more than\nthe dignity of his presence; and, indeed, would have resigned the\npursuit at the first blunder about the firm; and still more when the\nright one had been found, but the partner proved crusty, and would not\nbelieve that any such document was in his hands. George was consenting\nto let it rest till Mr. Mackintosh could be written to; but Harry,\noutrunning his management, and regardless of rebuffs, fairly teased the\nold gentleman into a search, as the only means of getting rid of the\ntroublesome sailor.\n\nIn the midst of George’s civil regrets at the fruitless trouble they\nwere causing, forth came a bundle of papers, and forth from the bundle\nfell a packet, on which Harry pounced as he read, “Will of Alan Halliday\nErnescliffe, Esquire, of Maplewood, Yorkshire, Lieutenant in H. M.\nS. Alcestis,” and, in the corner, the executors’ names, Captain John\nGordon, of H. M. S. Alcestis; and Richard May, Esquire, M. D., Market\nStoneborough.\n\nAs if in revenge, the prudent merchant would not be induced to entrust\nhim with the document, saying he could not give it up till he had heard\nfrom the executors, and had been certified of the death of the testator.\nHe withstood both the angry gentlemen, who finally departed in a state\nof great resentment--Harry declaring that the old land-lubber would\nnot believe that he was his own father’s son; and Mr. Rivers, no less\nincensed, that the House of Commons had been insulted in his person,\nbecause he did not carry all before him.\n\nFlora laughed at their story, and told them that she suspected that the\nold gentleman was in the right; and she laid plans for having Harry to\nteach them yachting at Ryde, while Harry declared he would have nothing\nto do with such trumpery.\n\nHarry found his home in a sort of agony of expectation, for his\nnon-arrival at the time expected had made his first appearance seem like\nan unsubstantial illusion, though Dr. May, or Mary and Aubrey, had been\nat the station at the coming in of each train. Margaret had recovered\nthe effects of the first shock, and the welcome was far more joyous than\nthe first had been, with the mixed sensations that were now composed,\nand showed little, outwardly, but gladness.\n\nDr. May took Flora’s view of the case, and declared that, if Harry\nhad brought home the will, he should not have opened it without his\nco-executor. So he wrote to the captain, while Harry made the most of\nhis time in learning his sisters over again. He spent a short time alone\nwith Margaret every morning, patiently and gently allowing himself to\nbe recalled to the sad recollections that were all the world to her.\nHe kept Ethel and Mary merry with his droll desultory comments; he made\nBlanche keep up her dancing; and taught Gertrude to be a thorough little\nromp. As to Dr. May, his patients never were so well or so cheerful,\ntill Dr. Spencer and Ethel suspected that the very sight of his looks\nbrightened them--how could they help it? Dr. Spencer was as happy as a\nking in seeing his friend freed from the heavy weight on his spirits;\nand, truly, it was goodly to watch his perfect look of content, as he\nleaned on his lion-faced boy’s arm, and walked down to the minster,\nwhither it seemed to have become possible to go on most evenings. Good\nDr. May was no musician, but Mr. Wilmot could not regret certain tones\nthat now and then burst out in the chanting, from the very bottom of a\nheart that assuredly sang with the full melody of thankfulness, whatever\nthe voice might do.\n\nCaptain Gordon not only wrote but came to Stoneborough, whence Harry was\nto go with him to the court-martial at Portsmouth.\n\nThe girls wondered that, after writing with so much warmth and\naffection, both of and to Harry, he met him without any demonstration of\nfeeling; and his short peremptory manner removed all surprise that poor\nHector had been so forlorn with him at Maplewood, and turned, with all\nhis heart, to Dr. May. They were especially impressed at the immediate\nsubsidence of all Harry’s noise and nonsense, as if the drawing-room had\nbeen the quarter-deck of the Alcestis.\n\n“And yet,” said Margaret, “Harry will not hear a single word in\ndispraise of him. I do believe he loves him with all his heart.”\n\n“I think,” said Ethel, “that in a strong character, there is an exulting\nfear in looking up to a superior, in whose justice there is perfect\nreliance. It is a germ of the higher feeling.”\n\n“I believe you are right,” said Margaret; “but it is a serious thing\nfor a man to have so little sympathy with those below him. You see how\nHector feels it, and I now understand how it told upon Alan, and how\npapa’s warmth was like a surprise to him.”\n\n“Because Captain Gordon had to be a father to them, and that is more\nthan a captain. I should not wonder if there were more similarity and\nfellow-feeling between him and Harry than there could be with either of\nthem. Harry, though he has all papa’s tenderness, is of a rougher sort\nthat likes to feel itself mastered. Poor Hector! I wonder if he is to be\ngiven back to us.”\n\n“Do you know--when--whether they will find out this morning?” said\nMargaret, catching her dress nervously, as she was moving away.\n\n“Yes, I believe so. I was not to have told you, but--”\n\n“There is no reason that it should do me any harm,” said Margaret,\nalmost smiling, and looking as if she was putting a restraint on\nsomething she wished to say. “Go down, dear Ethel--Aubrey will be\nwaiting for you.”\n\nEthel went down to the difficult task of hearing Aubrey’s lessons, while\nHarry was pretending to write to Mrs. Arnott, but, in reality, teaching\nGertrude the parts of a ship, occasionally acting mast, for her to\nclimb.\n\nBy and by Dr. May came in. “Margaret not downstairs yet?” he said.\n\n“She is dressed, but will not come down till the evening,” said Ethel.\n\n“I’ll go to her. She will be pleased. Come up presently, Ethel. Or,\nwhere’s Richard?”\n\n“Gone out,” said Harry. “What, is it anything left to her?”\n\n“The best, the best!” said Dr. May. “Ethel, listen--twenty thousand, to\nbuild and endow a church for Cocksmoor!”\n\nNo need to bid Ethel listen. She gave a sort of leap in her chair, then\nlooked almost ready to faint.\n\n“My dear child,” said her father, “This is your wish. I give you joy,\nindeed I do!”\n\nEthel drew his arm round her, and leaned against him. “My wish! my\nwish!” she repeated, as if questioning the drift of the words.\n\n“I’m glad it is found!” cried Harry. “Now I know why he talked of\nCocksmoor, and seemed to rest in planning for it. You will mind the roof\nis as he said.”\n\n“You must talk to Dr. Spencer about that,” said Dr. May. “The captain\nmeans to leave it entirely in our hands.”\n\n“Dear Alan!” exclaimed Ethel. “My wish! Oh, yes, but how gained? Yet,\nCocksmoor with a church! I don’t know how to be glad enough, and yet--”\n\n“You shall read the sentence,” said Dr. May. “‘In testimony of\nthankfulness for mercy vouchsafed to him here--’ poor dear boy!”\n\n“What does the captain say?” asked Harry.\n\n“He is rather astounded, but he owns that the estate can bear it, for\nold Halliday had saved a great deal, and there will be more before\nHector comes of age.”\n\n“And Hector?”\n\n“Yes, we get him back. I am fellow-trustee with Captain Gordon, and as\nto personal guardianship, I fancy the captain found he could not make\nthe boy happy, and thinks you no bad specimen of our training.”\n\n“Famous!” cried Harry. “Hector will hurrah now! Is that all?”\n\n“Except legacies to Captain Gordon, and some Scottish relations. But\npoor Margaret ought to hear it. Ethel, don’t be long in coming.”\n\nWith all Ethel’s reputation for bluntness, it was remarkable how her\nforce of character made her always called for whenever there was the\nleast dread of a scene.\n\nShe turned abruptly from Harry; and, going outside the window, tried\nto realise and comprehend the tidings, but all she could have time to\ndiscover was that Alan’s memory was dearer to her than ever, and she was\nobliged to hasten upstairs.\n\nHer father quitted the room by one door, as she entered by the other;\nshe believed that it was to hide his emotion, but Margaret’s fair wan\nface was beaming with the sweetest of congratulating smiles.\n\n“I thought so,” she said, as Ethel came in. “Dear Ethel, are you not\nglad?”\n\n“I think I am,” said Ethel, putting her hands to her brow.\n\n“You think!” exclaimed Margaret, as if disappointed.\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Ethel, with quivering lip. “Dear Margaret, I\nam glad--don’t you believe I am, but somehow, it is harder to deal with\njoy than grief. It confuses one! Dear Alan--and then to have been set\non it so long--to have prayed so for it, and to have it come in this\nway--by your--”\n\n“Nay, Ethel, had he come home, it was his great wish to have done it.\nHe used to make projects when he was here, but he would not let me tell\nyou, lest he should find duties at Maplewood--whereas this would have\nbeen his pleasure.”\n\n“Dear Alan!” repeated Ethel. “If you are so kind, so dear as to be glad,\nMargaret, I think I shall be so presently.”\n\nMargaret almost grudged the lack of the girlish outbreak of rejoicing\nwhich would once have forgotten everything in the ecstasy of the\nfulfilled vision. It did not seem to be what Alan had intended; he had\nfigured to himself unmixed joy, and she wanted to see it, and something\nof the wayward impatience of weakness throbbed at her heart, as Ethel\npaced the room, and disappeared in her own curtained recess.\n\nPresently she came back saying, “You are sure you are glad?”\n\n“It would be strange if I were not,” said Margaret. “See, Ethel, here\nare blessings springing up from what I used to think had served for\nnothing but to bring him pain and grief. I am so thankful that he could\nexpress his desire, and so grateful to dear Harry for bringing it to\nlight. How much better it is than I ever thought it could be! He has\nbeen spared disappointment, and surely the good that he will have done\nwill follow him.”\n\n“And you?” said Ethel sadly.\n\n“I shall lie here and wait,” said Margaret. “I shall see the plans, and\nhear all about it, and oh!”--her eyes lighted up--“perhaps some day, I\nmay hear the bell.”\n\nRichard’s tap interrupted them. “Had he heard?”\n\n“I have.” The deepened colour in his cheek betrayed how much he felt, as\nhe cast an anxious glance towards Margaret--an inquiring one on Ethel.\n\n“She is so pleased,” was all Ethel could say.\n\n“I thought she would be,” said Richard, approaching. “Captain Gordon\nseemed quite vexed that no special token of remembrance was left to\nher.”\n\nMargaret smiled in a peculiar way. “If he only knew how glad I am there\nwas not.” And Ethel knew that the church was his token to Margaret, and\nthat any “fading frail memorial” would have lessened the force of the\nsignification.\n\nEthel could speak better to her brother than to her sister. “Oh,\nRichard! Richard! Richard!” she cried, and a most unusual thing with\nboth, she flung her arms round his neck. “It is come at last! If it\nhad not been for you, this would never have been. How little likely it\nseemed, that dirty day, when I talked wildly, and you checked me!”\n\n“You had faith and perseverance,” said Richard, “or--”\n\n“You are right,” said Margaret, as Ethel was about to disclaim. “It\nwas Ethel’s steadiness that brought it before Alan’s mind. If she had\nyielded when we almost wished it, in the time of the distress about Mrs.\nGreen, I do believe that all would have died away!”\n\n“I didn’t keep steady--I was only crazy. You and Ritchie and Mr.\nWilmot--” said Ethel, half crying; then, as if unable to stay, she\nexclaimed with a sort of petulance, “And there’s Harry playing all sorts\nof rigs with Aubrey! I shan’t get any more sense out of him to-day!”\n\nAnd away she rushed to the wayfaring dust of her life of labour, to find\nAubrey and Daisy half-way up the tulip tree, and Harry mischievously\nunwilling to help them down again, assuring her that such news deserved\na holiday, and that she was growing a worse tartar than Miss Winter. She\nhad better let the poor children alone, put on her bonnet, and come with\nhim to tell Mr. Wilmot.\n\nWhereat Ethel was demurring, when Dr. May came forth, and declared he\nshould take her himself.\n\nPoor Mr. Wilmot laboured under a great burden of gratitude, which no one\nwould receive from him. Dr. May and Ethel repudiated thanks almost with\nterror; and, when he tried them with the captain, he found very doubtful\napproval of the whole measure, so that Harry alone was a ready acceptant\nof a full meed of acknowledgments for his gallant extraction of the\nwill.\n\nNo one was more obliged to him than Hector Ernescliffe, who wrote to\nMargaret that it would be very jolly to come home again, and that he\nwas delighted that the captain could not hinder either that or Cocksmoor\nChurch. “And as to Maplewood, I shall not hate it so much, if that\nhappens which I hope will happen.” Of which oracular sentence, Margaret\ncould make nothing.\n\nThe house of May felt more at their ease when the uncongenial captain\nhad departed, although he carried off Harry with him. There was the\nbetter opportunity for a tea-drinking consultation with Dr. Spencer\nand Mr. Wilmot, when Margaret lay on her sofa, looking better than for\nmonths past, and taking the keenest interest in every arrangement.\n\nDr. Spencer, whose bright eyes glittered at every mention of the\nsubject, assumed that he was to be the architect, while Dr. May was\nassuring him that it was a maxim that no one unpaid could be trusted;\nand when he talked of beautiful German churches with pierced spires,\ndeclared that the building must not make too large a hole in the twenty\nthousand, at the expense of future curates, because Richard was the\nfirst.\n\n“I’ll be prudent, Dick,” said Dr. Spencer. “Trust me not to rival the\nminster.”\n\n“We shall find work next for you there,” said Mr. Wilmot.\n\n“Ay, we shall have May out of his family packing-box before many years\nare over his head.”\n\n“Don’t mention it,” said Dr. May; “I know what I exposed myself to in\nbringing Wilmot here.”\n\n“Yes,” said Dr. Spencer, “we shall put you in the van when we attack the\nCorporation pen.”\n\n“I shall hold by the good old cause. As if the galleries had not been\nthere before you were born!”\n\n“As if poor people had a right to sit in their own church!” said Ethel.\n\n“Sit, you may well say,” said Mr. Wilmot. “As if any one could do\notherwise, with those ingenious traps for hindering kneeling.”\n\n“Well, well, I know the people must have room,” said Dr. May, cutting\nshort several further attacks which he saw impending.\n\n“Yes, you would like to build another blue gallery, blocking up another\nwindow, and with Richard May and Christopher Tomkins, Churchwardens, on\nit, in orange-coloured letters--the Rivers’ colours. No disrespect to\nyour father, Miss May, but, as a general observation, it is a property\nof Town Councillors to be conservative only where they ought not.”\n\n“I brought you here to talk of building a church, not of pulling one to\npieces.”\n\nPoor Dr. May, he knew it was inevitable and quite right, but his\naffectionate heart and spirit of perpetuity, which had an association\nconnected with every marble cloud, green baize pew, and square-headed\npanel, anticipated tortures in the general sweep, for which his\necclesiastical taste and sense of propriety would not soon compensate.\n\nMargaret spared his feelings by bringing the Cocksmoor subject back\nagain; Dr. Spencer seemed to comprehend the ardour with which she\npressed it on, as if it were very near her heart that there should be no\ndelay. He said he could almost promise her that the first stone should\nbe laid before the end of the summer, and she thanked him in her own\nwarm sweet way, hoping that it would be while Hector and Harry were at\nhome.\n\nHarry soon returned, having gone through the court-martial with the\nutmost credit, been patronised by Captain Gordon in an unheard-of\nmanner, asked to dine with the admiral, and promised to be quickly\nafloat again. Ere many days had passed, he was appointed to one of the\nfinest vessels in the fleet, commanded by a captain to whom Captain\nGordon had introduced him, and who “seemed to have taken a fancy to\nhim,” as he said. The Bucephalus, now the object of his pride, was\nrefitting, and his sisters hoped to see a good deal of him before he\nshould again sail. Besides, Flora would be at Ryde before the end of\nJuly.\n\nIt was singular that Ethel’s vision should have been fulfilled\nsimultaneously with Flora’s having obtained a position so far beyond\nwhat could have been anticipated.\n\nShe was evidently extremely happy and valuable, much admired and\nrespected, and with full exercise for the energy and cleverness, which\nwere never more gratified than by finding scope for action. Her husband\nwas devotedly attached to her, and was entirely managed by her, and\nthough her good judgment kept her from appearing visibly in matters not\npertaining to her own sphere, she was, in fact, his understanding. She\nread, listened, and thought for him, imbued him with her own views, and\ncomposed his letters for him; ruling his affairs, both political and\nprivate, and undeniably making him fill a position which, without her,\nhe would have left vacant; nor was there any doubt that he was far\nhappier for finding himself of consequence, and being no longer left\na charge upon his own hands. He seemed fully to suffice to her as\na companion, although she was so far superior in power; for it was,\nperhaps, her nature to love best that which depended upon her, and gave\nher a sense of exercising protection; as she had always loved Margaret\nbetter than Ethel.\n\n“Mrs. Rivers was an admirable woman.” So every one felt, and her\nyouthful beauty and success in the fashionable world made her qualities,\nas a wife and mistress of a household, the more appreciated. She never\nset aside her religious habits or principles, was an active member\nof various charitable associations, and found her experience of the\nStoneborough Ladies’ Committee applicable among far greater names.\nIndeed, Lady Leonora thought dear Flora Rivers’s only fault, her\nover-strictness, which encouraged Meta in the same, but there were\npoints that Flora could not have yielded on any account, without failing\nin her own eyes.\n\nShe made time for everything, and though, between business and fashion,\nshe seemed to undertake more than mortal could accomplish, it was all\neffected, and excellently. She did, indeed, sigh over the briefness of\nthe time that she could bestow on her child or on home correspondence,\nand declared that she should rejoice in rest; but, at the same time, her\nachievements were a positive pleasure to her.\n\nMeta, in the meantime, had been living passively on the most\naffectionate terms with her brother and sister, and though often\nsecretly yearning after the dear old father, whose darling she had\nbeen, and longing for power of usefulness, she took it on trust that her\npresent lot had been ordered for her, and was thankful, like the bird\nof Dr. May’s fable, for the pleasures in her path--culling sweet morals,\nand precious thoughts out of book, painting or concert, occasions for\nChristian charities in each courtesy of society, and opportunities\nfor cheerful self-denial and submission, whenever any little wish was\nthwarted.\n\nSo Norman said she had turned into a fine lady! It was a sudden and\nsurprising intimation, and made a change in the usually bright and\ncalm current of her thoughts. She was not aware that there had been any\nalteration in herself, and it was a revelation that set her to examine\nwhere she had changed--poor little thing! She was not angry, she did\nnot resent the charge, she took it for granted that, coming from such a\nsource, it must be true and reasonable--and what did it mean? Did they\nthink her too gay, or neglectful of old friends? What had they been\nsaying to Harry about her?\n\n“Ah!” thought Meta, “I understand it. I am living a life of ease and\nuselessness, and with his higher aims and nobler purposes, he shrinks\nfrom the frivolities among which I am cast. I saw his saddened\ncountenance among our gaieties, and I know that to deep minds there is\nheaviness in the midst of display. He withdraws from the follies that\nhave no charms for him, and I--ought I to be able to help being amused?\nI don’t seek these things, but, perhaps, I ought to avoid them more than\nI do. If I could be quite clear what is right, I should not care what\neffort I made. But I was born to be one of those who have trial of\nriches, and such blessed tasks are not my portion. But if he sees the\nvanities creeping into my heart, I should be grateful for that warning.”\n\nSo meditated Meta, as she copied one of her own drawings of the Grange,\nfor her dear old governess, Mrs. Larpent, while each line and tint\nrecalled the comments of her fond amateur father, and the scenery\ncarried her home, in spite of the street sounds, and the scratching of\nFlora’s pen, coursing over note-paper. Presently Sir Henry Walkinghame\ncalled, bringing a beautiful bouquet.\n\n“Delicious,” cried Meta. “See, Flora, it is in good time, for those\nvases were sadly shabby.”\n\nShe began at once to arrange the flowers, a task that seemed what she\nwas born for, and the choice roses and geraniums acquired fresh grace\nas she placed them in the slender glasses and classic vases; but\nFlora’s discerning eyes perceived some mortification on the part of\nthe gentleman, and, on his departure, playfully reproached Meta for\ningratitude.\n\n“Did we not thank him? I thought I did them all due honour, actually\nusing the Dresden bowl.”\n\n“You little wretch! quite insensible to the sentiment of the thing.”\n\n“Sentiment! One would think you had been reading about the language of\nflowers!”\n\n“Whatever there was, poor Sir Henry did not mean it for the Dresden bowl\nor Bohemian glass.”\n\n“Flora! do pray tell me whether you are in fun?”\n\n“You ridiculous child!” said Flora, kissing her earnest forehead,\nringing the bell, and gathering up her papers, as she walked out of the\nroom, and gave her notes to the servant.\n\n“What does she mean? Is it play? Oh, no, a hint would be far more like\nher. But I hope it is nonsense. He is very kind and pleasant, and I\nshould not know what to do.”\n\nInstances of his complaisance towards herself rose before her, so as to\nexcite some warmth and gratitude. Her lonely heart thrilled at the idea\nof being again the best beloved, and her energetic spirit bounded at the\nthought of being no longer condemned to a life of idle ease. Still it\nwas too new a light to her to be readily accepted, after she had looked\non him so long, merely as a familiar of the house, attentive to her,\nbecause she fell to his share, when Flora was occupied. She liked him,\ndecidedly; she could possibly do more; but she was far more inclined\nto dread, than to desire, any disturbance of their present terms of\nintercourse.\n\n“However,” thought she, “I must see my way. If he should have any such\nthing in his head, to go on as we do now would be committing myself, and\nI will not do that, unless I am sure it is right. Oh, papa, you would\nsettle it for me! But I will have it out with Flora. She will find out\nwhat I cannot--how far he is a man for whom one ought to care. I do\nnot think Norman liked him, but then Norman has so keen a sense of\nthe world-touched. I suppose I am that! If any other life did but seem\nappointed for me, but one cannot tell what is thwarting providential\nleading, and if this be as good a man as--What would Ethel say? If I\ncould but talk to Dr. May! But Flora I will catch, before I see him\nagain, that I may know how to behave.”\n\nCatching Flora was not the easiest thing in the world, among her\nmultifarious occupations; but Meta was not the damsel to lose an\nopportunity for want of decision.\n\nFlora saw what was coming, and was annoyed with herself for having given\nthe alarm; but, after all, it must have come some time or other, though\nshe had rather that Meta had been more involved first.\n\nIt should be premised that Mrs. Rivers had no notion of the degree of\nattachment felt by her brother for Meta; she only knew that Lady Leonora\nhad a general distrust of her family, and she felt it a point of\nhonour to promote no dangerous meetings, and to encourage Sir Henry--a\nconnection who would be most valuable, both as conferring importance\nupon George in the county, and as being himself related to persons of\nhigh influence, whose interest might push on her brothers. Preferment\nfor Richard; promotion for Harry; nay, diplomatic appointments for\nTom, came floating before her imagination, even while she smiled at her\nAlnaschar visions.\n\nBut the tone of Meta, as she drew her almost forcibly into her room,\nshowed her that she had given a great shock to her basket.\n\n“Flora, if you would only give me a minute, and would tell me--”\n\n“What?” asked Flora, not inclined to spare her blushes.\n\n“Whether, whether you meant anything in earnest?”\n\n“My dear little goose, did no one ever make an innocent joke in their\nlives before?”\n\n“It was very silly of me,” said Meta; “but you gave me a terrible\nfright.”\n\n“Was it so very terrible, poor little bird?” said Flora, in\ncommiseration. “Well then, you may safely think of him as a man tame\nabout the house. It was much prettier of you not to appropriate the\nflowers, as any other damsel would have done.”\n\n“Do you really and truly think--” began Meta; but, from the colour of\nher cheek and the timid resolution of her tone, Flora thought it safest\nnot to hear the interrogation, and answered, “I know what he comes here\nfor--it is only as a refuge from his mother’s friend, old Lady Drummond,\nwho would give the world to catch him for her daughters--that’s all. Put\nmy nonsense out of your head, and be yourself, my sweet one.”\n\nFlora had never gone so near an untruth, as when she led Meta to believe\nthis was the sole reason. But, after all, what did Flora herself know to\nthe contrary?\n\nMeta recovered her ease, and Flora marked, as weeks passed on, that she\ngrew more accustomed to Sir Henry’s attentions. A little while, and she\nwould find herself so far bound by the encouragement she had given, that\nshe could not reject him.\n\n“My dear,” said George, “when do you think of going down to take the\nbaby to the Grange? She looks dull, I think.”\n\n“Really, I think it is hardly worth while to go down en masse,” said\nFlora. “These last debates may be important, and it is a bad time to\nquit one’s post. Don’t you think so?”\n\n“As you please--the train is a great bore.”\n\n“And we will send the baby down the last day before we go to Ryde, with\nPreston and Butts to take care of her. We can’t spare him to take them\ndown, till we shut up the house. It is so much easier for us to go to\nPortsmouth from hence.”\n\nThe lurking conviction was that one confidential talk with Ethel\nwould cause the humming-bird to break the toils that were being wound\ninvisibly round her. Ethel and her father knew nothing of the world, and\nwere so unreasonable in their requirements! Meta would consult them\nall, and all her scruples would awaken, and perhaps Dr. Spencer might\nbe interrogated on Sir Henry’s life abroad, where Flora had a suspicion\nthat gossip had best not be raked up.\n\nNot that she concealed anything positively known to her, or that she\nwas not acting just as she would have done by her own child. She found\nherself happily married to one whom home notions would have rejected,\nand she believed Meta would be perfectly happy with a man of decided\ntalent, honour, and unstained character, even though he should not come\nup to her father’s or Ethel’s standard.\n\nIf Meta were to marry as they would approve, she would have far to\nseek among “desirable connections.” Meantime, was not Flora acting with\nexemplary judgment and self-denial?\n\nSo she wrote that she could not come home; Margaret was much\ndisappointed, and so was Meta, who had looked to Ethel to unravel the\ntangles of her life.\n\n“No, no, little miss,” said Flora to herself; “you don’t talk to Ethel\ntill your fate is irrevocable. Why, if I had listened to her, I should\nbe thankful to be singing at Mrs. Hoxton’s parties at this minute!\nand, as for herself, look at Norman Ogilvie! No, no, after six weeks’\nyachting--moonlight, sea, and sympathy--I defy her to rob Sir Henry of\nhis prize! And, with Meta lady of Cocksmoor, even Ethel herself must be\ncharmed!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\n\n     We barter life for pottage, sell true bliss\n     For wealth or power, for pleasure or renown;\n     Thus, Esau-like, our Father’s blessing miss,\n     Then wash with fruitless tears our faded crown.\n                                          Christian Year.\n\n\n“Papa, here is a message from Flora for you,” said Margaret, holding up\na letter; “she wants to know whom to consult about the baby.”\n\n“Ha! what’s the matter?”\n\nMargaret read--“Will you ask papa whom I had better call in to see the\nbaby. There does not seem to be anything positively amiss, but I am\nnot happy about her. There is a sleepiness about her which I do not\nunderstand, and, when roused, she is fretful, and will not be amused.\nThere is a look in her eyes which I do not like, and I should wish to\nhave some advice for her. Lady Leonora recommends Mr.--, but I always\ndistrust people who are very much the rage, and I shall send for no one\nwithout papa’s advice.”\n\n“Let me see!” said Dr. May, startled, and holding out his hand for the\nletter. “A look about the eyes! I shall go up and see her myself. Why\nhas not she brought her home?”\n\n“It would have been far better,” said Margaret.\n\n“Sleepy and dull! She was as lively a child when they took her away as\nI ever saw. What! is there no more about her? The letter is crammed with\nsomebody’s fete--vote of want of confidence--debate last night. What is\nshe about? She fancies she knows everything, and, the fact is, she knows\nno more about infants--I could see that, when the poor little thing was\na day old!”\n\n“Do you think there is cause for fear?” said Margaret anxiously.\n\n“I can’t tell. With a first child, one can’t guess what may be mamma’s\nfancy, or what may be serious. But Flora is not too fanciful, and I must\nsee her for my own satisfaction. Let some one write, and say I will\ncome up to-morrow by the twelve o’clock train--and mind she opens the\nletter.”\n\nDr. May kept his word, and the letter had evidently not been neglected;\nfor George was watching for him at the station, and thanked him so\neagerly for coming, that Dr. May feared that he was indeed needed, and\ninquired anxiously.\n\n“Flora is uneasy about her--she seems heavy, and cries when she is\ndisturbed,” replied George. “Flora has not left her to-day, and hardly\nyesterday.”\n\n“Have you had no advice for her?”\n\n“Flora preferred waiting till you should come.”\n\nDr. May made an impatient movement, and thought the way long, till they\nwere set down in Park Lane. Meta came to meet them on the stairs, and\nsaid that the baby was just the same, and Flora was in the nursery, and\nthither they hastily ascended.\n\n“Oh, papa! I am so glad you are come!” said Flora, starting up from her\nlow seat, beside the cradle.\n\nDr. May hardly paused to embrace his daughter, and she anxiously led him\nto the cradle, and tried to read his expression, as his eyes fell on the\nlittle face, somewhat puffed, but of a waxy whiteness, and the breathing\nseeming to come from the lips.\n\n“How long has she been so?” he asked, in a rapid, professional manner.\n\n“For about two or three hours. She was very fretful before, but I did\nnot like to call in any one, as you were coming. Is it from her teeth?”\n said Flora, more and more alarmed by his manner. “Her complexion is\nalways like that--she cannot bear to be disturbed,” added she, as the\nchild feebly moaned, on Dr. May beginning to take her from her cradle;\nbut, without attending to the objection, he lifted her up, so that she\nlay as quietly as before, on his arm. Flora had trusted that hope and\nconfidence would come with him; but, on the contrary, every lurking\nmisgiving began to rush wildly over her, as she watched his countenance,\nwhile he carried his little granddaughter towards the light, studied\nher intently, raised her drooping eyelids, and looked into her eyes,\nscarcely eliciting another moan. Flora dared not ask a question, but\nlooked on with eyes open, as it were, stiffened.\n\n“This is the effect of opium,” were Dr. May’s first words, breaking\non all with startling suddenness; but, before any one could speak, he\nadded, “We must try some stimulant directly;” then looking round the\nroom, “What have you nearest?”\n\n“Godfrey’s Cordial, sir,” quickly suggested the nurse.\n\n“Ay--anything to save time--she is sinking for want of the drug that\nhas--” He broke off to apportion the dose, and to hold the child in a\nposition to administer it--Flora tried to give it--the nurse tried--in\nvain.\n\n“Do not torment her further,” said the doctor, as Flora would have\nrenewed the trial--“it cannot be done. What have you all been doing?”\n cried he, as, looking up, his face changed from the tender compassion\nwith which he had been regarding his little patient, into a look of\nstrong indignation, and one of his sentences of hasty condemnation broke\nfrom him, as it would not have done, had Flora been less externally\ncalm. “I tell you this child has been destroyed with opium!”\n\nThey all recoiled; the father turned fiercely round on the nurse, with a\nviolent exclamation, but Dr. May checked him. “Hush! This is no presence\nfor the wrath of man.” The solemn tone seemed to make George shrink\ninto an awestruck quiescence; he stood motionless and transfixed, as if\nindeed conscious of some overwhelming presence.\n\nFlora had come near, with an imploring gesture, to take the child in\nher own arms; but Dr. May, by a look of authority, prevented it; for,\nindeed, it would have been harassing and distressing the poor little\nsufferer again to move her, as she lay with feeble gasps on his arm.\n\nSo they remained, for what space no one knew--not one word was uttered,\nnot a limb moved, and the street noises sounded far off.\n\nDr. May stooped his head closer to the babe’s face, and seemed listening\nfor a breath, as he once more touched the little wrist; he took away his\nfinger, he ceased to listen, he looked up.\n\nFlora gave one cry--not loud, not sharp, but “an exceeding bitter\ncry”--she would have moved forward, but reeled, and her husband’s arms\nsupported her as she sank into a swoon.\n\n“Carry her to her room,” said Dr. May. “I will come;” and, when George\nhad borne her away, he kissed the lifeless cheek, and reverently placed\nthe little corpse in the cradle; but, as he rose from doing so, the\nsobbing nurse exclaimed, “Oh, sir! oh, sir! indeed, I never did--”\n\n“Never did what?” said Dr. May sternly.\n\n“I never gave the dear baby anything to do her harm,” cried Preston\nvehemently.\n\n“You gave her this,” said Dr. May, pointing to the bottle of Godfrey’s\nCordial.\n\nHe could say no more, for her master was hurrying back into the room.\nAnger was the first emotion that possessed him, and he hardly gave an\nanswer to Dr. May’s question about Flora. “Meta is with her! Where is\nthat woman? Have you given her up to the police?”\n\nPreston shrieked and sobbed, made incoherent exclamations, and was much\ndisposed to cling to the doctor.\n\n“Silence!” said Dr. May, lifting his hand, and assuming a tone and\nmanner that awed them both, by reminding them that death was present in\nthe chamber; and, taking his son-in-law out, and shutting the door, he\nsaid, in a low voice,\n\n“I believe this is no case for the police--have mercy on the poor\nwoman.”\n\n“Mercy--I’ll have no mercy on my child’s murderer! You said she had\ndestroyed my child.”\n\n“Ignorantly.”\n\n“I don’t care for ignorance! She destroyed her--I’ll have justice,” said\nGeorge doggedly.\n\n“You shall,” said Dr. May, laying his hand on his arm; “but it must be\ninvestigated, and you are in no state to investigate. Go downstairs--do\nnot do anything till I come to you.”\n\nHis peremptory manner imposed on George, who, nevertheless, turned round\nas he went, saying, with a fierce glare in his eyes, “You will not let\nher escape.”\n\n“No. Go down--be quiet.”\n\nDr. May returned to Preston, and had to assure her that Mr. Rivers was\nnot gone to call the police, before he could bring her to any degree of\ncoherence. She regarded him as her only friend, and soon undertook to\ntell the whole truth, and he perceived that it was, indeed, the truth.\nShe had not known that the cordial was injurious, deeming it a panacea\nagainst fretfulness, precious to nurses, but against which ladies always\nhad a prejudice, and, therefore, to be kept secret. Poor little Leonora\nhad been very fretful and uneasy when Flora’s many avocations had first\ncaused her to be set aside, and Preston had had recourse to the remedy\nwhich, lulling her successfully, was applied with less moderation and\njudgment than would have been shown by a more experienced person, till\ngradually the poor child became dependent on it for every hour of rest.\nWhen her mother, at last, became aware of her unsatisfactory condition,\nand spent her time in watching her, the nurse being prevented from\ncontinuing her drug, she was, of course, so miserable without it, that\nPreston had ventured on proposing it, to which Mrs. Rivers had replied\nwith displeasure sufficient to prevent her from declaring how much she\nhad previously given. Preston was in an agony of distress for her little\ncharge, as well as of fear for herself, and could hardly understand what\nher error had been. Dr. May soon saw that, though not highly principled,\nher sorrow was sincere, and that she still wept bitterly over the\nconsequences of her treatment, when he told her that she had nothing to\nfear from the law, and that he would protect her from Mr. Rivers.\n\nHer confession was hardly over when Meta knocked at the door, pale and\nfrightened. “Oh, Dr. May, do come to poor Flora! I don’t know what to\ndo, and George is in such a state!”\n\nDr. May made a sound of sorrow and perplexity, and Meta, as she went\ndown before him, asked, in a low, horror-stricken whisper, “Did Preston\nreally--”\n\n“Not knowingly,” said Dr. May. “It is the way many children have gone;\nbut I never thought--”\n\nThey had come to Flora’s dressing-room. Her bedroom door was open, and\nGeorge was pacing heavily up and down the length of both apartments,\nfiercely indignant. “Well!” said he, advancing eagerly on Dr. May, “has\nshe confessed?”\n\n“But Flora!” said Dr. May, instead of answering him. Flora lay on her\nbed, her face hidden on her pillow, only now and then moaning.\n\n“Flora, my poor, poor child!” said her father, bending down to raise\nher, and taking her hand.\n\nShe moved away, so as to bury her face more completely; but there was\nlife in the movement, and he was sufficiently reassured on her situation\nto be able to attend to George, who was only impatient to rush off\nto take his revenge. He led him into the outer room, where Meta was\nwaiting, and forced upon his unwilling conviction that it was no case\nfor the law. The child had not been killed by any one dose, but had\nrather sunk from the want of stimulus, to which she had been accustomed.\nAs to any pity for the woman, George would not hear of it. She was\nstill, in his eyes, the destroyer of his child; and, when he found the\nlaw would afford him no vengeance, he insisted that she should be turned\nout of his house at once.\n\n“George!” called a hollow voice from the next room, and hurrying back,\nthey saw Flora sitting up, and, as well as trembling limbs allowed,\nendeavouring to rise to her feet, while burning spots were in her\ncheeks.\n\n“George, turn me out of the house too! If Preston killed her, I did!”\n and she gave a ghastly laugh.\n\nGeorge threw his arms round her, and laid her on her bed again, with\nmany fond words, and strength which she had not power to withstand. Dr.\nMay, in the meantime, spoke quickly to Meta in the doorway. “She must\ngo. They cannot see her again; but has she any friends in London?”\n\n“I think not.”\n\n“Find out. She must not be sent adrift. Send her to the Grange, if\nnothing better offers. You must judge.”\n\nHe felt that he could confide in Meta’s discretion and promptitude, and\nreturned to the parents.\n\n“Is she gone?” said George, in a whisper, which he meant should be\nunheard by his wife, who had sunk her face in her pillows again.\n\n“Going. Meta is seeing to it.”\n\n“And that woman gets off free!” cried George, “while my poor little\ngirl--” and, no longer occupied by the hope of retribution, he gave way\nto an overpowering burst of grief.\n\nHis wife did not rouse herself to comfort him, but still lay motionless,\nexcepting for a convulsive movement that passed over her frame at each\nsound from him, and her father felt her pulse bound at the same time\nwith corresponding violence, as if each of his deep-drawn sobs were\na mortal thrust. Going to him, Dr. May endeavoured to repress his\nagitation, and lead him from the room; but he could not, at first,\nprevail on him to listen or understand, still less, to quit Flora. The\nattempt to force on him the perception that his uncontrolled sorrow\nwas injuring her, and that he ought to bear up for her sake, only did\nfurther harm; for, when he rose up and tried to caress her, there was\nthe same torpid, passive resistance, the same burying her face from the\nlight, and the only betrayal of consciousness in the agonised throbs of\nher pulse.\n\nHe became excessively distressed at being thus repelled, and, at last,\nyielded to the impatient signals of Dr. May, who drew him into the next\nroom, and, with brief, strong, though most affectionate and pitying\nwords, enforced on him that Flora’s brain--nay, her life, was risked,\nand that he must leave her alone to his care for the present. Meta\ncoming back at the same moment, Dr. May put him in her charge, with\nrenewed orders to impress on him how much depended on tranquillity.\n\nDr. May went back, with his soft, undisturbing, physician’s footfall,\nand stood at the side of the bed, in such intense anxiety as those only\ncan endure who know how to pray, and to pray in resignation and faith.\n\nAll was still in the darkening twilight; but the distant roar of the\nworld surged without, and a gaslight shone flickering through the\nbranches of the trees, and fell on the rich dress spread on the couch,\nand the ornaments on the toilet-table. There was a sense of oppression,\nand of being pursued by the incongruous world, and Dr. May sighed to\nsilence all around, and see his poor daughter in the calm of her own\ncountry air; but she had chosen for herself, and here she lay, stricken\ndown in the midst of the prosperity that she had sought.\n\nHe could hear every respiration, tightened and almost sobbing, and he\nwas hesitating whether to run the risk of addressing her; when, as if it\nhad occurred to her suddenly that she was alone and deserted, she raised\nup her head with a startled movement, but, as she saw him, she again hid\nher face, as if his presence were still more intolerable than solitude.\n\n“Flora! my own, my dearest--my poor child! you should not turn from me.\nDo I not carry with me the like self-reproachful conviction?”\n\nFlora let him turn her face towards him and kiss her forehead. It was\nburning, and he brought water and bathed it, now and then speaking a few\nfond, low, gentle words, which, though she did not respond, evidently\nhad some soothing effect; for she admitted his services, still, however,\nkeeping her eyes closed, and her face turned towards the darkest side of\nthe room. When he went towards the door, she murmured, “Papa!” as if to\ndetain him.\n\n“I am not going, darling. I only wanted to speak to George.”\n\n“Don’t let him come!” said Flora.\n\n“Not till you wish it, my dear.”\n\nGeorge’s step was heard; his hand was on the lock, and again Dr. May was\nconscious of the sudden rush of blood through all her veins. He\nquickly went forward, met him, and shut him out, persuading him, with\ndifficulty, to remain outside, and giving him the occupation of sending\nout for an anodyne--since the best hope, at present, lay in encouraging\nthe torpor that had benumbed her crushed faculties.\n\nHer father would not even venture to rouse her to be undressed; he gave\nher the medicine, and let her lie still, with as little movement as\npossible, standing by till her regular breathings showed that she had\nsunk into a sleep; when he went into the other room and found that\nGeorge had also forgotten his sorrows in slumber on the sofa, while Meta\nsat sadly presiding over the tea equipage.\n\nShe came up to meet him, her question expressed in her looks.\n\n“Asleep,” he said; “I hope the pulses are quieter. All depends on her\nwakening.”\n\n“Poor, poor Flora!” said Meta, wiping away her tears.\n\n“What have you done with the woman?”\n\n“I sent her to Mrs. Larpent’s. I knew she would receive her and keep\nher till she could write to her friends. Bellairs took her, but I could\nhardly speak to her--”\n\n“She did it ignorantly,” said Dr. May.\n\n“I could never be so merciful and forbearing as you,” said Meta.\n\n“Ah! my dear, you will never have the same cause!”\n\nThey could say no more, for George awoke, and the argument of his\nexclusion had to be gone through again. He could not enter into it by\nany means; and when Dr. May would have made him understand that poor\nFlora could not acquit herself of neglect, and that even his affection\nwas too painful for her in the present state; he broke into a vehement\nangry defence of her devotion to her child, treating Dr. May as if the\naccusation came from him; and when the doctor and Meta had persuaded him\nout of this, he next imagined that his father-in-law feared that he was\ngoing to reproach his wife, and there was no making him comprehend more\nthan that, if she were not kept quiet, she might have a serious illness.\n\nEven then he insisted on going to look at her, and Dr. May could not\nprevent him from pressing his lips to her forehead. She half opened her\neyes, and murmured “good-night,” and by this he was a little comforted;\nbut he would hear of nothing but sitting up, and Meta would have done\nthe same, but for an absolute decree of the doctor.\n\nIt was a relief to Dr. May that George’s vigil soon became a sound\nrepose on the sofa in the dressing-room; and he was left to read and\nmuse uninterruptedly.\n\nIt was far past two o’clock before there was any movement; then Flora\ndrew a long breath, stirred, and, as her father came and drew her hand\ninto his, before she was well awake, she gave a long, wondering whisper,\n“Oh, papa! papa!” then sitting up, and passing her hand over her eyes,\n“Is it all true?”\n\n“It is true, my own poor dear,” said Dr. May, supporting her, as she\nrested against his arm, and hid her face on his shoulder, while her\nbreath came short, and she shivered under the renewed perception--“she\nis gone to wait for you.”\n\n“Hush! Oh, don’t! papa!” said Flora, her voice shortened by anguish.\n“Oh, think why--”\n\n“Nay, Flora, do not, do not speak as if that should exclude peace\nor hope!” said Dr. May entreatingly. “Besides, it was no wilful\nneglect--you had other duties--”\n\n“You don’t know me, papa,” said Flora, drawing her hands away from him,\nand tightly clenching them in one another, as thoughts far too terrible\nfor words swept over her.\n\n“If I do not, the most Merciful Father does,” said Dr. May. Flora sat\nfor a minute or two, her hands locked together round her knees, her head\nbowed down, her lips compressed. Her father was so far satisfied that\nthe bodily dangers he had dreaded were averted; but the agony of mind\nwas far more terrible, especially in one who expressed so little, and in\nwhom it seemed, as it were, pent up.\n\n“Papa!” said Flora presently, with a resolution of tone as if she would\nprevent resistance; “I must see her!”\n\n“You shall, my dear,” said the doctor at once; and she seemed grateful\nnot to be opposed, speaking more gently, as she said, “May it be\nnow--while there is no daylight?”\n\n“If you wish it,” said Dr. May.\n\nThe dawn, and a yellow waning moon, gave sufficient light for moving\nabout, and Flora gained her feet; but she was weak and trembling, and\nneeded the support of her father’s arm, though hardly conscious of\nreceiving it, as she mounted the same stairs, that she had so often\nlightly ascended in the like doubtful morning light; for never, after\nany party, had she omitted her visit to the nursery.\n\nThe door was locked, and she looked piteously at her father as her weak\npush met the resistance, and he was somewhat slow in turning the key\nwith his left hand. The whitewashed, slightly furnished room reflected\nthe light, and the moonbeams showed the window-frame in pale and dim\nshades on the blinds, the dewy air breathed in coolly from the park,\nand there was a calm solemnity in the atmosphere--no light, no watcher\npresent to tend the babe. Little Leonora needed such no more; she was\nwith the Keeper, who shall neither slumber nor sleep.\n\nSo it thrilled across her grandfather, as he saw the little cradle\ndrawn into the middle of the room, and, on the coverlet, some pure white\nrosebuds and lilies of the valley, gathered in the morning by Mary\nand Blanche, little guessing the use that Meta would make of them ere\nnightfall.\n\nThe mother sank on her knees, her hands clasped over her breast, and\nrocking herself to and fro uneasily, with a low, irrepressible moaning.\n\n“Will you not see her face?” whispered Dr. May.\n\n“I may not touch her,” was the answer, in the hollow voice, and with the\nwild eye that had before alarmed him; but trusting to the soothing power\nof the mute face of the innocent, he drew back the covering.\n\nThe sight was such as he anticipated, sadly lovely, smiling and\ntranquil--all oppression and suffering fled away for ever.\n\nIt stilled the sounds of pain, and the restless motion; the compression\nof the hands became less tight, and he began to hope that the look was\npassing into her heart. He let her kneel on without interruption, only\nonce he said, “Of such is the kingdom of Heaven!”\n\nShe made no immediate answer, and he had had time to doubt whether he\nought to let her continue in that exhausting attitude any longer, when\nshe looked up and said, “You will all be with her there.”\n\n“She has flown on to point your aim more steadfastly,” said Dr. May.\n\nFlora shuddered, but spoke calmly--“No, I shall not meet her.”\n\n“My child!” he exclaimed, “do you know what you are saying?”\n\n“I know, I am not in the way,” said Flora, still in the same fearfully\nquiet, matter-of-fact tone. “I never have been”--and she bent over her\nchild, as if taking her leave for eternity.\n\nHis tongue almost clave to the roof of his mouth, as he heard the\nwords--words elicited by one of those hours of true reality that,\nlike death, rend aside every wilful cloak of self-deceit, and\nself-approbation. He had no power to speak at first; when he recovered\nit, his reply was not what his heart had, at first, prompted.\n\n“Flora! How has this dear child been saved?” he said. “What has released\nher from the guilt she inherited through you, through me, through all?\nIs not the Fountain open?”\n\n“She never wasted grace,” said Flora.\n\n“My child! my Flora!” he exclaimed, losing the calmness he had gained\nby such an effort; “you must not talk thus--it is wrong! Only your own\nmorbid feeling can treat this--this--as a charge against you, and if\nit were, indeed”--he sank his voice--“that such consequences destroyed\nhope, oh, Flora! where should I be?”\n\n“No,” said Flora, “this is not what I meant. It is that I have never\nset my heart right. I am not like you nor my sisters. I have seemed to\nmyself, and to you, to be trying to do right, but it was all hollow, for\nthe sake of praise and credit. I know it, now it is too late; and He\nhas let me destroy my child here, lest I should have destroyed her\neverlasting life, like my own.”\n\nThe most terrible part of this sentence was to Dr. May, that Flora spoke\nas if she knew it all as a certainty, and without apparent emotion, with\nall the calmness of despair. What she had never guessed before had\ncome clearly and fully upon her now, and without apparent novelty,\nor, perhaps, there had been misgivings in the midst of her complacent\nself-satisfaction. She did not even seem to perceive how dreadfully\nshe was shocking her father, whose sole comfort was in believing her\nlanguage the effect of exaggerated self-reproach. His profession had\nrendered him not new to the sight of despondency, and, dismayed as he\nwas, he was able at once to speak to the point.\n\n“If it were indeed so, her removal would be the greatest blessing.”\n\n“Yes,” said her mother, and her assent was in the same tone of resigned\ndespair, owning it best for her child to be spared a worldly education,\nand loving her truly enough to acquiesce.\n\n“I meant the greatest blessing to you,” continued Dr. May, “if it be\nsent to open your eyes, and raise your thoughts upwards. Oh, Flora, are\nnot afflictions tokens of infinite love?”\n\nShe could not accept the encouragement, and only formed, with her lips,\nthe words, “Mercy to her--wrath to me!”\n\nThe simplicity and hearty piety which, with all Dr. May’s faults, had\nalways been part of his character, and had borne him, in faith and\ntrust, through all his trials, had never belonged to her. Where he had\nbeen sincere, erring only from impulsiveness, she had been double-minded\nand calculating; and, now that her delusion had been broken down, she\nhad nothing to rest upon. Her whole religious life had been mechanical,\ndeceiving herself more than even others, and all seemed now swept away,\nexcept the sense of hypocrisy, and of having cut herself off, for ever,\nfrom her innocent child. Her father saw that it was vain to argue with\nher, and only said, “You will think otherwise by and by, my dear. Now\nshall I say a prayer before we go down?”\n\nAs she made no reply, he repeated the Lord’s Prayer, but she did not\njoin; and then he added a broken, hesitating intercession for the\nmourners, which caused her to bury her face deeper in her hands, but her\ndull wretchedness altered not.\n\nRising, he said authoritatively, “Come, Flora, you must go to bed. See,\nit is morning.”\n\n“You have sat up all night with me!” said Flora, with somewhat of her\nanxious, considerate self.\n\n“So has George. He had just dropped asleep on the sofa when you awoke.”\n\n“I thought he was in anger,” said she.\n\n“Not with you, dearest.”\n\n“No, I remember now, not where it was justly due. Papa,” she said,\npausing, as to recall her recollection, “what did I do? I must have done\nsomething very unkind to make him go away and leave me.”\n\n“I insisted on his leaving you, my dear. You seemed oppressed, and his\naffectionate ways were doing you harm; so I was hardhearted, and turned\nhim out, sadly against his will.”\n\n“Poor George!” said Flora, “has he been left to bear it alone all this\ntime? How much distressed he must have been. I must have vexed him\ngrievously. You don’t guess how fond he was of her. I must go to him at\nonce.”\n\n“That is right, my dear.”\n\n“Don’t praise me,” said she, as if she could not bear it. “All that is\nleft for me is to do what I can for him.”\n\nDr. May felt cheered. He was sure that hope must again rise out of\nunselfish love and duty.\n\nTheir return awoke George, who started, half sitting up, wondering why\nhe was spending the night in so unusual a manner, and why Flora looked\nso pale, in the morning light, with her loosened, drooping hair.\n\nShe went straight to him, and, kneeling by his side, said, “George,\nforgive!” The same moment he had caught her to his bosom; but so\nimpressed was his tardy mind with the peril of talking to her, that he\nheld her in his arms without a single word, till Dr. May had unclosed\nhis lips--a sign would not suffice--he must have a sentence to assure\nhim; and then it was such joy to have her restored, and his fondness\nand solicitude were so tender and eager in their clumsiness, that his\nfather-in-law was touched to the heart.\n\nFlora was quite herself again, in presence of mind and power of dealing\nwith him; and Dr. May left them to each other, and went to his own room,\nfor such rest as sorrow, sympathy, and the wakening city, would permit\nhim.\n\nWhen the house was astir in the morning, and the doctor had met Meta in\nthe breakfast-room, and held with her a sad, affectionate conversation,\nGeorge came down with a fair report of his wife, and took her father to\nsee her.\n\nThat night had been like an illness to her, and, though perfectly\ncomposed, she was feeble and crushed, keeping the room darkened, and\nreluctant to move or speak. Indeed, she did not seem able to give her\nattention to any one’s voice, except her husband’s. When Dr. May, or\nMeta, spoke to her, she would miss what they said, beg their pardon, and\nask them to repeat it; and sometimes, even then, become bewildered.\nThey tried reading to her, but she did not seem to listen, and her\nhalf-closed eye had the expression of listless dejection, that her\nfather knew betokened that, even as last night, her heart refused to\naccept promises of comfort as meant for her.\n\nFor George, however, her attention was always ready, and was perpetually\nclaimed. He was forlorn and at a loss without her, every moment; and,\nin the sorrow which he too felt most acutely, could not have a minute’s\npeace unless soothed by her presence; he was dependent on her to a\ndegree which amazed and almost provoked the doctor, who could not\nbear to have her continually harassed and disturbed, and yet was much\naffected by witnessing so much tenderness, especially in Flora, always\nthe cold utilitarian member of his family.\n\nIn the middle of the day she rose and dressed, because George was\nunhappy at having to sit without her, though only in the next room. She\nsat in the large arm-chair, turned away from the blinded windows, never\nspeaking nor moving, save when he came to her, to make her look at\nhis letters and notes, when she would, with the greatest patience and\nsweetness, revise them, suggest word or sentence, rouse herself to\nconsider each petty detail, and then sink back into her attitude of\nlistless dejection. To all besides, she appeared totally indifferent;\ngently courteous to Meta and to her father, when they addressed her, but\notherwise showing little consciousness whether they were in the room;\nand yet, when something was passing about her father’s staying or\nreturning, she rose from her seat, came up to him before he was aware,\nand said, “Papa! papa! you will not leave me!” in such an imploring\ntone, that if he had ever thought of quitting her, he could not have\ndone so.\n\nHe longed to see her left to perfect tranquillity, but such could not be\nin London. Though theirs was called a quiet house, the rushing stream\nof traffic wearied his country ears, the door bell seemed ceaselessly\nringing, and though Meta bore the brunt of the notes and messages, great\nnumbers necessarily came up to Mr. Rivers, and of these Flora was not\nspared one. Dr. May had his share too of messages and business, and\nfriends and relations, the Rivers’ kindred, always ready to take\noffence with their rich connections, and who would not be satisfied with\ninquiries, at the door, but must see Meta, and would have George fetched\ndown to them--old aunts, who wanted the whole story of the child’s\nillness, and came imagining there was something to be hushed up; Lady\nLeonora extremely polite, but extremely disgusted at the encounter with\nthem; George ready to be persuaded to take every one up to see his wife,\nand the prohibition to be made by Dr. May over and over again--it was\na most tedious, wearing afternoon, and at last, when the visitors had\ngone, and George had hurried back to his wife, Dr. May threw himself\ninto an arm-chair and said, “Oh, Meta, sorrow weighs more heavily in\ntown than in the country!”\n\n“Yes!” said Meta. “If one only could go out and look at the flowers, and\ntake poor Flora up a nosegay!”\n\n“I don’t think it would make much difference to her,” sighed the doctor.\n\n“Yes, I think it would,” said Meta; “it did to me. The sights there\nspeak of the better sights.”\n\n“The power to look must come from within,” said Dr. May, thinking of his\npoor daughter.\n\n“Ay,” said Meta, “as Mr. Ernescliffe said, ‘heaven is as near--!’ But\nthe skirts of heaven are more easily traced in our mountain view than\nhere, where, if I looked out of window, I should only see that giddy\nstring of carriages and people pursuing each other!”\n\n“Well, we shall get her home as soon as she is able to move, and I hope\nit may soothe her. What a turmoil it is! There has not been one moment\nwithout noise in the twenty-two hours I have been here!”\n\n“What would you say if you were in the city?”\n\n“Ah! there’s no talking of it; but if I had been a fashionable London\nphysician, as my father-in-law wanted to make me, I should have been\ndead long ago!”\n\n“No, I think you would have liked it very much.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Love’s a flower that will not die,” repeated Meta, half smiling. “You\nwould have found so much good to do--”\n\n“And so much misery to rend one’s heart,” said Dr. May. “But, after all,\nI suppose there is only a certain capacity of feeling.”\n\n“It is within, not without, as you said,” returned Meta.\n\n“Ha, there’s another!” cried Dr. May, almost petulant at the sound\nof the bell again, breaking into the conversation that was a great\nrefreshment.\n\n“It was Sir Henry Walkinghame’s ring,” said Meta. “It is always his time\nof day.”\n\nThe doctor did not like it the better.\n\nSir Henry sent up a message to ask whether he could see Mr. or Miss\nRivers.\n\n“I suppose we must,” said Meta, looking at the doctor. “Lady Walkinghame\nmust be anxious about Flora.”\n\nShe blushed greatly, fancying that Dr. May was putting his own\nconstruction on the heightened colour which she could not control.\nSir Henry came in, just what he ought to be, kindly anxious, but not\noverwhelming, and with a ready, pleased recognition of the doctor, as an\nold acquaintance of his boyhood. He did not stay many minutes; but there\nwas a perceptible difference between his real sympathy and friendly\nregard only afraid of obtruding, and the oppressive curiosity of their\nformer visitors. Dr. May felt it due, both from kindness and candour, to\nsay something in his praise when he was gone.\n\n“That is a sensible superior man,” he said. “He will be an acquisition\nwhen he takes up his abode at Drydale.”\n\n“Yes,” said Meta; a very simple yes, from which nothing could be\ngathered.\n\nThe funeral was fixed for Monday, the next day but one, at the church\nwhere Mr. Rivers had been buried. No one was invited to be present;\nEthel wrote that, much as she wished it, she could not leave Margaret,\nand, as the whole party were to return home on the following day, they\nshould soon see Flora.\n\nFlora had laid aside all privileges of illness after the first day; she\ncame downstairs to breakfast and dinner, and though looking wretchedly\nill, and speaking very low and feebly, she was as much as ever the\nmistress of her house. Her father could never draw her into conversation\nagain on the subject nearest his heart, and could only draw the sad\nconclusion that her state of mind was unchanged, from the dreary\nindifference with which she allowed every word of cheer to pass by\nunheeded, as if she could not bear to look beyond the grave. He had some\nhope in the funeral, which she was bent on attending, and more in the\ninfluence of Margaret, and the counsel of Richard, or of Mr. Wllmot.\n\nThe burial, however, failed to bring any peaceful comfort to the\nmourning mother. Meta’s tears flowed freely, as much for her father\nas for her little niece; and George’s sobs were deep and choking; but\nFlora, externally, only seemed absorbed in helping him to go through\nwith it; she, herself, never lost her fixed, composed, hopeless look.\n\nAfter her return, she went up to the nursery, and deliberately set\napart and locked up every possession of her child’s, then, coming down,\nstartled Meta by laying her hand on her shoulder and saying, “Meta,\ndear, Preston is in the housekeeper’s room. Will you go and speak to her\nfor a moment, to reassure her before I come?”\n\n“Oh, Flora!”\n\n“I sent for her,” said Flora, in answer. “I thought it would be a good\nopportunity while George is out. Will you be kind enough to prepare her,\nmy dear?”\n\nMeta wondered how Flora had known whither to send, but she could not but\nobey. Poor Preston was an ordinary sort of woman, kind-hearted, and not\nwithout a conscience; but her error had arisen from the want of any high\nreligious principle to teach her obedience, or sincerity. Her grief was\nextreme, and she had been so completely overcome by the forbearance and\nconsideration shown to her, that she was even more broken-hearted by the\nthought of them, than by the terrible calamity she had occasioned.\n\nKind-hearted Mrs. Larpent had tried to console her, as well as to turn\nthe misfortune to the best account, and Dr. May had once seen her, and\nstriven gently to point out the true evil of the course she had pursued.\nShe was now going to her home, and they augured better of her, that\nshe had been as yet too utterly downcast to say one word of that first\nthought with a servant, her character.\n\nMeta found her sobbing uncontrollably at the associations of her\nmaster’s house, and dreadfully frightened at hearing that she was to see\nMrs. Rivers; she began to entreat to the contrary with the vehemence of\na person unused to any self-government; but, in the midst, the low\ncalm tones were heard, and her mistress stood before her--her perfect\nstillness of demeanour far more effective in repressing agitation, than\nhad been Meta’s coaxing attempts to soothe.\n\n“You need not be afraid to see me, Preston,” said Flora kindly. “I am\nvery sorry for you--you knew no better, and I should not have left so\nmuch to you.”\n\n“Oh, ma’am--so kind--the dear, dear little darling--I shall never\nforgive myself.”\n\n“I know you did love her,” continued Flora. “I am sure you intended no\nharm, and it was my leaving her that made her fretful.”\n\nPreston tried to thank.\n\n“Only remember henceforth”--and the clear tone grew fainter than ever\nwith internal anguish, though still steady--“remember strict obedience\nand truth henceforth; the want of them will have worse results by and by\nthan even this. Now, Preston, I shall always wish you well. I ought not,\nI believe, to recommend you to the like place, without saying why you\nleft me, but for any other I will give you a fair character. I will see\nwhat I can do for you, and if you are ever in any distress, I hope you\nwill let me know. Have your wages been paid?”\n\nThere was a sound in the affirmative, but poor Preston could not speak.\n“Good-bye, then,” and Flora took her hand and shook it. “Mind you let me\nhear if you want help. Keep this.”\n\nMeta was a little disappointed to see sovereigns instead of a book.\nFlora turned to go, and put her hand out to lean on her sister as for\nsupport; she stood still to gather strength before ascending the stairs,\nand a groan of intense misery was wrung from her.\n\n“Dearest Flora, it has been too much!”\n\n“No,” said Flora gently.\n\n“Poor thing, I am glad for her sake. But might she not have a book--a\nBible?”\n\n“You may give her one, if you like. I could not.”\n\nFlora reached her own room, went in, and bolted the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\n\n     Oh, where dwell ye, my ain sweet bairns?\n       I’m woe and weary grown!\n     Oh, Lady, we live where woe never is,\n       In a land to flesh unknown.--ALLAN CUNNINGHAM.\n\n\nIt had been with a gentle sorrow that Etheldred had expected to go and\nlay in her resting-place, the little niece, who had been kept from the\nevil of the world, in a manner of which she had little dreamt. Poor\nFlora! she must be ennobled, she thought, by having a child where hers\nis, when she is able to feel anything but the first grief; and Ethel’s\nheart yearned to be trying, at least, to comfort her, and to be with her\nfather, who had loved his grandchild so fondly.\n\nIt was not to be. Margaret had borne so many shocks with such calmness,\nthat Ethel had no especial fears for her; but there are some persons who\nhave less fortitude for others than for themselves, and she was one of\nthese. Ethel had been her own companion-sister, and the baby had been\nthe sunbeam of her life, during the sad winter and spring.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Ethel knocked at Richard’s door. Margaret\nhad been seized with faintness, from which they could not bring her\nback; and, even when Richard had summoned Dr. Spencer, it was long ere\nhis remedies took effect; but, at last, she revived enough to thank\nthem, and say she was glad that papa was not there.\n\nDr. Spencer sent them all to bed, and the rest of the night was quiet;\nbut Margaret could not deny, in the morning, that she felt terribly\nshattered, and she was depressed in spirits to a degree such as they\nhad never seen in her before. Her whole heart was with Flora; she was\nunhappy at being at a distance from her, almost fretfully impatient for\nletters, and insisting vehemently on Ethel’s going to London.\n\nEthel had never felt so helpless and desolate, as with Margaret thus\nchanged and broken, and her father absent.\n\n“My dear,” said Dr. Spencer, “nothing can be better for both parties\nthan that he should be away. If he were here, he ought to leave all\nattendance to me, and she would suffer from the sight of his distress.”\n\n“I cannot think what he will do or feel!” sighed Ethel.\n\n“Leave it to me. I will write to him, and we shall see her better before\npost time.”\n\n“You will tell him exactly how it was, or I shall,” said Ethel abruptly,\nnot to say fiercely.\n\n“Ho! you don’t trust me?” said Dr. Spencer, smiling, so that she was\nashamed of her speech. “You shall speak for yourself, and I for myself;\nand I shall say that nothing would so much hurt her as to have others\nsacrificed to her.”\n\n“That is true,” said Ethel; “but she misses papa.”\n\n“Of course she does; but, depend on it, she would not have him leave\nyour sister, and she is under less restraint without him.”\n\n“I never saw her like this!”\n\n“The drop has made it overflow. She has repressed more than was good\nfor her, and now that her guard is broken down, she gives way under the\nwhole weight.”\n\n“Poor Margaret! I am pertinacious; but, if she is not better by post\ntime, papa will not bear to be away.”\n\n“I’ll tell you what I think of her by that time. Send up your brother\nRichard, if you wish to do her good. Richard would be a much better\nperson to write than yourself. I perceive that he is the reasonable\nmember of the family.”\n\n“Did not you know that before?”\n\n“All I knew of him, till last night, was, that no one could, by any\npossibility, call him Dick.”\n\nDr. Spencer was glad to have dismissed Ethel smiling; and she was the\nbetter able to bear with poor Margaret’s condition of petulance. She had\nnever before experienced the effects of bodily ailments on the temper,\nand she was slow to understand the change in one usually so patient and\nsubmissive. She was, by turns, displeased with her sister and with her\nown abruptness; but, though she knew it not, her bluntness had a bracing\neffect. She thought she had been cross in declaring it was nonsense to\nharp on her going to London; but it made Margaret feel that she had been\nunreasonable, and keep silence.\n\nRichard managed her much better, being gentle and firm, and less ready\nto speak than Ethel, and he succeeded in composing her into a sleep,\nwhich restored her balance, and so relieved Ethel, that she not only\nallowed Dr. Spencer to say what he pleased, but herself made light of\nthe whole attack, little knowing how perilous was any shock to that\ndelicate frame.\n\nMargaret’s whole purpose was to wind herself up for the first interview\nwith Flora; and though she had returned to her usual state, she would\nnot go downstairs on the evening the party were expected, believing\nit would be more grateful to her sister’s feelings to meet her without\nwitnesses.\n\nThe travellers arrived, and Dr. May hurried up to her. She barely\nreplied to his caresses and inquiries in her eagerness to hear of Flora,\nand to convince him that he must not forbid the meeting. Nor had he any\nmind so to do. “Surely,” said he, when he had seen the spiritualised\nlook of her glistening blue eyes, the flush on her transparent cheeks,\nand her hands clasped over her breast--“surely poor Flora must feel as\nthough an angel were waiting to comfort her.”\n\nFlora came, but there was sore disappointment. Fond and tender she\nwas as ever, but, neither by word or gesture, would she admit the most\nremote allusion to her grief. She withdrew her hand when Margaret’s\npressure became expressive; she avoided her eye, and spoke incessantly\nof different subjects. All the time, her voice was low and hollow, her\nface had a settled expression of wretchedness, and her glances wandered\ndrearily and restlessly anywhere but to Margaret’s face; but her\nsteadiness of manner was beyond her sister’s power to break, and her\nvisit was shortened on account of her husband. Poor George had quite\ngiven way at the sight of Gertrude, whom his little girl had been\nthought to resemble; and, though Dr. May had soothed him almost like\na child, no one put any trust in his self-control, and all sat round,\nfearing each word or look, till Flora came downstairs, and they\ndeparted.\n\nRichard and Ethel each offered to go with them; they could not bear to\nthink of their spending that first evening in their childless home; but\nFlora gently, but decidedly, refused; and Dr. May said that, much as he\nwished to be with them, he believed that Flora preferred having no one\nbut Meta. “I hope I have done Margaret no harm,” were Flora’s last words\nto him, and they seemed to explain her guarded manner; but he found\nMargaret weeping as she had never wept for herself, and palpitation and\nfaintness were the consequence.\n\nEthel looked on at Flora as a sad and perplexing mystery during the\nweeks that ensued. There were few opportunities of being alone together,\nand Flora shrank from such as they were--nay, she checked all expression\nof solicitude, and made her very kisses rapid and formal.\n\nThe sorrow that had fallen on the Grange seemed to have changed none of\nthe usual habits there--visiting, riding, driving, dinners, and music,\nwent on with little check. Flora was sure to be found the animated,\nattentive lady of the house, or else sharing her husband’s pursuits,\nhelping him with his business, or assisting him in seeking pleasure,\nspending whole afternoons at the coachmaker’s over a carriage that they\nwere building, and, it was reported, playing ecarte in the evening.\n\nHad grief come to be forgotten and cast aside without effecting any\nmission? Yet Ethel could not believe that the presence of the awful\nmessenger was unfelt, when she heard poor George’s heavy sigh, or when\nshe looked at Flora’s countenance, and heard the peculiar low, subdued\ntone of her voice, which, when her words were most cheerful, always\nseemed to Ethel the resigned accent of despair.\n\nEthel could not talk her over with Margaret, for all seemed to make it\na point that Margaret should believe the best. Dr. May turned from the\nsubject with a sort of shuddering grief, and said, “Don’t talk of her,\npoor child--only pray for her!”\n\nEthel, though shocked by the unwonted manner of his answer, was somewhat\nconsoled by perceiving that a double measure of tenderness had sprung\nup between her father and his poor daughter. If Flora had seemed, in her\ngirlhood, to rate him almost cheaply, this was at an end now; she met\nhim as if his embrace were peace, the gloom was lightened, the attention\nless strained, when he was beside her, and she could not part with him\nwithout pressing for a speedy meeting. Yet she treated him with the same\nreserve; since that one ghastly revelation of the secrets of her heart,\nthe veil had been closely drawn, and he could not guess whether it had\nbeen but a horrible thought, or were still an abiding impression. Ethel\ncould gather no more than that her father was very unhappy about Flora,\nand that Richard understood why; for Richard had told her that he had\nwritten to Flora, to try to persuade her to cease from this reserve, but\nthat he had no reply.\n\nNorman was not at home; he had undertaken the tutorship of two\nschoolboys for the holidays; and his father owned, with a sigh, that he\nwas doing wisely.\n\nAs to Meta, she was Ethel’s chief consolation, by the redoubled\nassurances, directed to Ethel’s unexpressed dread, lest Flora should be\nrejecting the chastening Hand. Meta had the most absolute certainty that\nFlora’s apparent cheerfulness was all for George’s sake, and that it was\na most painful exertion. “If Ethel could only see how she let herself\nsink together, as it were, and her whole countenance relax, as soon as\nhe was out of sight,” Meta said, “she could not doubt what misery these\nefforts were to her.”\n\n“Why does she go on with them?” said Ethel.\n\n“George,” said Meta. “What would become of him without her? If he misses\nher for ten minutes he roams about lost, and he cannot enjoy anything\nwithout her. I cannot think how he can help seeing what hard work it is,\nand how he can be contented with those dreadful sham smiles; but as long\nas she can give him pleasure, poor Flora will toil for him.”\n\n“It is very selfish,” Ethel caught herself saying.\n\n“No, no, it is not,” cried Meta. “It is not that he will not see, but\nthat he cannot see. Good honest fellow, he really thinks it does her\ngood and pleases her. I was so sorry one evening when I tried to take\nher place at that perpetual ecarte, and told him it teased her; he went\nso wistfully to her, and asked whether it did, and she exerted herself\ninto such painful enjoyment to persuade him to the contrary; and\nafterwards she said to me, ‘Let me alone, dearest--it is the only thing\nleft me.’”\n\n“There is something in being husband and wife that one cannot\nunderstand,” slowly said Ethel, so much in her quaint way that Meta\nlaughed.\n\nHad it not been for Norman’s absence, Ethel would, in the warm sympathy\nand accustomed manner of Meta Rivers, have forgotten all about the hopes\nand fears that, in brighter days, had centred on that small personage;\nuntil one day, as she came home from Cocksmoor, she found “Sir Henry\nWalkinghame’s” card on the drawing-room table. “I should like to bite\nyou! Coming here, are you?” was her amiable reflection.\n\nMeta, in her riding-habit, peeped out of Margaret’s room. “Oh, Ethel,\nthere you are! It is such a boon that you did not come home sooner, or\nwe should have had to ride home with him! I heard him asking for the\nMiss Mays! And now I am in hopes that he will go home without falling in\nwith Flora and George.”\n\n“I did not know he was in these parts.”\n\n“He came to Drydale last week, but the place is forlorn, and George gave\nhim a general invitation to the Grange.”\n\n“Do you like him?” said Ethel, while Margaret looked on, amazed at her\naudacity.\n\n“I liked him very much in London,” said Meta; “he is pleasant enough to\ntalk to, but somehow, he is not congruous here--if you understand me.\nAnd I think his coming oppresses Flora--she turned quite pale when he\nwas announced, and her voice was lower than ever when she spoke to him.”\n\n“Does he come often?” said Ethel.\n\n“I don’t think he has anything else to do,” returned Meta, “for our\nhouse cannot be as pleasant as it was; but he is very kind to George,\nand for that we must be grateful. One thing I am afraid of, that he will\npersuade us off to the yachting after all.”\n\n“Oh!” was the general exclamation.\n\n“Yes,” said Meta. “George seemed to like the plan, and I very much fear\nthat he is taking a dislike to the dear old Grange. I heard him say,\n‘Anything to get away.’”\n\n“Poor George, I know he is restless,” said Margaret.\n\n“At least,” said Ethel, “you can’t go till after your birthday, Miss\nHeiress.”\n\n“No, Uncle Cosham is coming,” said Meta. “Margaret, you must have your\nstone laid before we go!”\n\n“Dr. Spencer promises it before Hector’s holidays are over,” said\nMargaret, blushing, as she always did, with pleasure, when they talked\nof the church.\n\nHector Ernescliffe had revived Margaret wonderfully. She was seldom\ndownstairs before the evening, and Ethel thought his habit of making her\napartment his sitting-room must be as inconvenient to her as it was\nto herself; but Hector could not be de trop for Margaret. She exerted\nherself to fulfil for him all the little sisterly offices that, with her\nbrothers, had been transferred to Ethel and Mary; she threw herself into\nall his schemes, tried to make him endure Captain Gordon, and she\neven read his favourite book of Wild Sports, though her feelings were\nconstantly lacerated by the miseries of the slaughtered animals.\nHer couch was to him as a home, and he had awakened her bright soft\nliveliness which had been only dimmed for a time.\n\nThe church was her other great interest, and Dr. Spencer humoured her\nby showing her all his drawings, consulting her on every ornament,\nand making many a perspective elevation, merely that she might see the\neffect.\n\nRichard and Tom made it their recreation to construct a model of the\nchurch as a present for her, and Tom developed a genius for carving,\nwhich proved a beneficial interest to keep him from surliness. He had\nvoluntarily propounded his intended profession to his father, who had\nbeen so much pleased by his choice, that he could not but be gratified;\nthough now and then ambitious fancies, and discontent with Stoneborough,\ncombined to bring on his ordinary moody fits, the more, because his\nhabitual reserve prevented any one from knowing what was working in his\nmind.\n\nFinally the Rivers’ party announced their intention of going to the Isle\nof Wight as soon as Meta had come of age; and the council of Cocksmoor,\nmeeting at tea at Dr. May’s house, decided that the foundation stone\nof the church should be laid on the day after her birthday, when there\nwould be a gathering of the whole family, as Margaret wished. Dr.\nSpencer had worked incredibly hard to bring it forward, and Margaret’s\nsweet smiles, and liquid eyes, expressed how personally thankful she\nfelt.\n\n“What a blessing this church has been to that poor girl,” said Dr.\nSpencer, as he left the house with Mr. Wilmot. “How it beguiles her out\nof her grief! I am glad she has the pleasure of the foundation; I doubt\nif she will see the consecration.”\n\n“Indeed!” said Mr. Wilmot, shocked. “Was that attack so serious?”\n\n“That recumbent position and want of exercise were certain to produce\norganic disease, and suspense and sorrow have hastened it. The death of\nMrs. Rivers’s poor child was the blow that called it into activity, and,\nif it last more than a year, I shall be surprised.”\n\n“For such as she is, one cannot presume to wish, but her father--is he\naware of this?”\n\n“He knows there is extensive damage; I think he does not open his eyes\nto the result, but he will bear it. Never was there a man to whom it\ncame so naturally to live like the fowls of the air, or the lilies of\nthe field, as it does to dear Dick May,” said Dr. Spencer, his voice\nfaltering.\n\n“There is a strength of faith and love in him that carries him\nthrough all,” said Mr. Wilmot. “His childlike nature seems to have the\ntrustfulness that is, in itself, consolation. You said how Cocksmoor had\nbeen blessed to Margaret--I think it is the same with them all--not only\nEthel and Richard, who have been immediately concerned; but that one\nobject has been a centre and aim to elevate the whole family, and give\nforce and unity to their efforts. Even the good doctor, much as I\nalways looked up to him--much good as he did me in my young days--I must\nconfess that he was sometimes very provoking.”\n\n“If you had tried to be his keeper at Cambridge, you might say so!”\n rejoined Dr. Spencer.\n\n“He is so much less impetuous--more consistent--less desultory; I dare\nsay you understand me,” said Mr. Wilmot. “His good qualities do not\nentangle one another as they used to do.”\n\n“Exactly so. He was far more than I looked for when I came home, though\nI might have guessed that such a disposition, backed by such principles\nand such--could not but shake off all the dross.”\n\n“One thing was,” said Mr. Wilmot, smiling, “that a man must take himself\nin hand at some time in his life, and Dr. May only began to think\nhimself responsible for himself when he lost his wife, who was wise for\nboth. She was an admirable person, but not easy to know well. I think\nyou knew her at--”\n\n“I say,” interrupted Dr. Spencer, “it strikes me that we could not do\nbetter than get up our S. P. G. demonstration on the day of the stone--”\n\nHitherto the Stoneborough subscribers to the Society for the Propagation\nof the Gospel had been few and far between; but, under the new dynasty,\nthere was a talk of forming an association, and having a meeting to\nbring the subject forward. Dr. Spencer’s proposal, however, took the\nvicar by surprise.\n\n“Never could there be a better time,” he argued. “You have naturally\na gathering of clergy--people ought to be liberal on such an occasion,\nand, as Cocksmoor is provided for, why not give the benefit to the\nmissions, in their crying need!”\n\n“True, but there is no time to send for any one to make a speech.”\n\n“Husband your resources. What could you have better than young Harry and\nhis islanders?”\n\n“Harry would never make a speech.”\n\n“Let him cram Norman. Young Lake tells me Norman made a great sensation\nat the Union at Oxford, and if his heart is in the work, he must not\nshrink from the face of his townsmen.”\n\n“No doubt he had rather they were savages,” said the vicar. “And\nyourself--you will tell them of the Indian missions.”\n\n“With all my heart,” said Dr. Spencer. “When my Brahminhee godson--the\ndeacon I told you of, comes to pay me his promised visit, what doings we\nshall have! Seriously, I have just had letters from him and from others,\nthat speak of such need, that I could feel every moment wasted that is\nnot spent on their behalf.”\n\nMr. Wilmot was drawn into Dr. Spencer’s house, and heard the letters,\ntill his heart burned within him.\n\nThe meeting was at once decided upon, though Ethel could not see why\npeople could not give without speechifying, and her two younger brothers\ndeclared it was humbug--Tom saying, he wished all blackamoors were out\nof creation, and Harry, that he could not stand palaver about his friend\nDavid. Dr. May threatened him with being displayed on the platform as a\nliving instance of the effects of missions, at which he took alarm, and\nso seriously declared that he should join the Bucephalus at once, that\nthey pacified him by promising that he should do as he pleased.\n\nThe archdeacon promised a sermon, and the active Dr Spencer worked the\nnine muses and all the rest of the town and neighbourhood into a state\nof great enthusiasm and expectation. He went to the Grange, as he said,\nto collect his artillery; primed Flora that she might prime the M. P.;\nmade the willing Meta promise to entrap the uncle, who was noted for\nphilanthropical speeches; and himself captured Sir Henry Walkinghame,\nwho looked somewhat rueful at what he found incumbent on him as a\ncountry gentleman, though there might be some compensation in the\neagerness of Miss Rivers.\n\nNorman had hardly set foot in Stoneborough before he was told what was\nin store for him, and, to the general surprise, submitted as if it were\na very simple matter. As Dr. Spencer told him, it was only a foretaste\nof the penalty which every missionary has to pay for coming to England.\nNorman was altogether looking much better than when he had been last at\nhome, and his spirits were more even. He had turned his whole soul to\nthe career he had chosen, cast his disappointment behind him, or, more\ntruly, made it his offering, and gathered strength and calmness, with\nwhich to set out on tasks of working for others, with thoughts too much\nabsorbed on them, to give way to the propensity of making himself the\nprimary object of study and contemplation. The praise of God, and love\nof man, were the best cures for tendencies like his, and he had found it\nout. His calm, though grave cheerfulness, came as a refreshment to those\nwho had been uneasy about him, and mournfully watching poor Flora.\n\n“Yes,” said Dr. Spencer, “you have taken the best course for your own\nhappiness.”\n\nNorman coloured, as if he understood more than met the ear. Mary and\nBlanche were very busy preparing presents for Meta Rivers, and every one\nwas anxious to soften to her the thought of this first birthday without\nher father. Each of the family contributed some pretty little trifle,\nchoice in workmanship or kind in device, and each was sealed and marked\nwith the initials of the giver, and packed up by Mary, to be committed\nto Flora’s charge. Blanche had, however, much trouble in extracting a\ngift from Norman, and he only yielded at last, on finding that all his\nbrothers had sent something, so that his omission would be marked. Then\nhe dived into the recesses of his desk, and himself sealed up a little\nparcel, of which he would not allow his sisters to inspect the contents.\n\nEthel had a shrewd guess. She remembered his having, in the flush of\njoy at Margaret’s engagement, rather prematurely caused a seal to be\ncut with a daisy, and “Pearl of the meadow” as the motto; and his having\nsaid that he should keep it as a wedding present. She could understand\nthat he was willing to part with it without remark.\n\nFlora met Meta in her sitting-room, on the morning of the day, which\nrose somewhat sadly upon the young girl, as she thought of past\naffection and new responsibilities. If the fondness of a sister could\nhave compensated for what she had lost, Meta received it in no scanty\nmeasure from Flora, who begged to call George, because he would be\npleased to see the display of gifts.\n\nHis own was the only costly one--almost all the rest were homemade\ntreasures of the greater price, because the skill and fondness of\nthe maker were evident in their construction; and Meta took home the\nkindness as it was meant, and felt the affection that would not let her\nfeel herself lonely. She only wished to go and thank them all at once.\n\n“Do then,” said Flora. “If Lord Cosham will spare you, and your business\nshould be over in time, you could drive in, and try to bring papa home\nwith you.”\n\n“Oh, thank you, Flora. That is a kind treat, in case the morning should\nbe very awful!”\n\nMargaret Agatha Rivers signed her documents, listened to explanations,\nand was complimented by her uncle on not thinking it necessary to be\nsenseless on money matters, like her cousin, Agatha Langdale.\n\nStill she looked a little oppressed, as she locked up the tokens of her\nwealth, and the sunshine of her face did not beam out again till she\narrived at Stoneborough, and was dispensing her pretty thanks to the few\nshe found at home.\n\n“Ethel out and Norman? His seal is only too pretty--”\n\n“They are all helping Dr. Spencer at Cocksmoor.”\n\n“What a pity! But it is so very kind of him to treat me as a daisy. In\nsome ways I like his present for that the best of all,” said Meta.\n\n“I will tell him so,” said Mary.\n\n“Yes, no,” said Meta. “I am not pretending to be anything half so nice.”\n\nMary and Blanche fell upon her for calling herself anything but the\nnicest flower in the world; and she contended that she was nothing\nbetter than a parrot-tulip, stuck up in a parterre; and just as the\ndiscussion was becoming a game at romps, Dr. May came in, and the\nchildren shouted to him to say whether his humming-bird were a daisy or\na tulip.\n\n“That is as she comports herself,” he said playfully.\n\n“Which means that you don’t think her quite done for,” said Meta.\n\n“Not quite,” said the doctor, with a droll intonation; “but I have not\nseen what this morning may have done to her.”\n\n“Come and see, then,” said Meta. “Flora told me to bring you home--and\nit is my birthday, you know. Never mind waiting to tell Ethel. Margaret\nwill let her know that I’ll keep you out of mischief.”\n\nAs usual, Dr. May could not withstand her, and she carried him off in\ntriumph in her pony carriage.\n\n“Then you don’t give me up yet?” was the first thing she said, as they\nwere off the stones.\n\n“What have you been doing to make me?” said he.\n\n“Doing or not doing--one or the other,” she said. “But indeed I wanted\nto have you to myself. I am in a great puzzle!”\n\n“Sir Henry! I hope she won’t consult me!” thought Dr. May, as he\nanswered, “Well, my dear.”\n\n“I fear it is a lasting puzzle,” she said. “What shall I do with all\nthis money?”\n\n“Keep it in the bank, or buy railway shares!” said Dr. May, looking\narch.\n\n“Thank you. That’s a question for my cousins in the city. I want you to\nanswer me as no one else can do. I want to know what is my duty now that\nI have my means in my own hands?”\n\n“There is need enough around--”\n\n“I do not mean only giving a little here and there, but I want you to\nhear a few of my thoughts. Flora and George are kindness itself--but,\nyou see, I have no duties. They are obliged to live a gay sort of\nlife--it is their position; but I cannot make out whether it is mine. I\ndon’t see that I am like those girls who have to go out as a matter of\nobedience.”\n\nDr. May considered, but could only say, “You are very young.”\n\n“Too young to be independent,” sighed Meta. “I must grow old enough to\nbe trusted alone, and in the meantime--”\n\n“Probably an answer will be found,” said the doctor. “You and your means\nwill find their--their vocation.”\n\n“Marriage,” said Meta, calmly speaking the word that he had avoided. “I\nthink not.”\n\n“Why--” he began.\n\n“I do not think good men like heiresses.”\n\nHe became strongly interested in a corn-field, and she resumed,\n\n“Perhaps I should only do harm. It may be my duty to wait. All I wish to\nknow is, whether it is?”\n\n“I see you are not like girls who know their duty, and are restless,\nbecause it is not the duty they like.”\n\n“Oh! I like everything. It is my liking it so much that makes me\nafraid.”\n\n“Even going to Ryde?”\n\n“Don’t I like the sailing? and seeing Harry too? I don’t feel as if that\nwere waste, because I can sometimes spare poor Flora a little. We could\nnot let her go alone.”\n\n“You need never fear to be without a mission of comfort,” said Dr. May.\n“Your ‘spirit full of glee’ was given you for something. Your presence\nis far more to my poor Flora than you or she guess.”\n\n“I never meant to leave her now,” said Meta earnestly. “I only wished to\nbe clear whether I ought to seek for my work.”\n\n“It will seek you, when the time comes.”\n\n“And meantime I must do what comes to hand, and take it as humiliation\nthat it is not in the more obviously blessed tasks! A call might come,\nas Cocksmoor did to Ethel. But oh! my money! Ought it to be laid up for\nmyself?”\n\n“For your call, when it comes,” said Dr. May, smiling; then gravely,\n“There are but too many calls for the interest. The principal is your\ntrust, till the time comes.”\n\nMeta smiled, and was pleased to think that her first-fruits would be\noffered to-morrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\n\n“Oh, dear!” sighed Etheldred, as she fastened her white muslin, “I’m\nafraid it is my nature to hate my neighbour.”\n\n“My dear Ethel, what is coming next?” said Margaret.\n\n“I like my neighbour at home, and whom I have to work for, very much,”\n said Ethel, “but oh! my neighbour that I have to be civil to!”\n\n“Poor old King! I am afraid your day will be spoiled with all your toils\nas lady of the house. I wish I could help you.”\n\n“Let me have my grumble out, and you will!” said Ethel.\n\n“Indeed I am sorry you have this bustle, and so many to entertain, when\nI know you would rather have the peaceful feelings belonging to the day\nundisturbed. I should like to shelter you up here.”\n\n“It is very ungrateful of me,” said Ethel, “when Dr. Spencer works so\nhard for us, not to be willing to grant anything to him.”\n\n“And--but then I have none of the trouble of it--I can’t help liking the\nnotion of sending out the Church to the island whence the Church came\nhome to us.”\n\n“Yes--” said Ethel, “if we could do it without holding forth!”\n\n“Come, Ethel, it is much better than the bazaar--it is no field for\nvanity.”\n\n“Certainly not,” said Ethel. “What a mess every one will make! Oh, if I\ncould but stay away, like Harry! There will be Dr. Hoxton being sonorous\nand prosy, and Mr. Lake will stammer, and that will be nothing to the\nmisery of our own people’s work. George will flounder, and look at\nFlora, and she will sit with her eyes on the ground, and Dr. Spencer\nwill come out of his proper self, and be complimentary to people who\ndeserve it no more!--And Norman! I wish I could run away!”\n\n“Richard says we do not guess how well Norman speaks.”\n\n“Richard thinks Norman can do anything he can’t do himself! It is all\nchance--he may do very well, if he gets into his ‘funny state’, but he\nalways suffers for that, and he will certainly put one into an agony at\nthe outset. I wish Dr. Spencer would have let him alone! And then there\nwill be that Sir Henry, whom I can’t abide! Oh, I wish I were more\ncharitable, like Miss Bracy and Mary, who will think all so beautiful!”\n\n“So will you, when you come home,” said Margaret.\n\n“If I could only be talking to Cherry, and Dame Hall! I think the school\nchildren enter into it very nicely, Margaret. Did I tell you how nicely\nEllen Reid answered about the hymn, ‘From Greenland’s icy mountains’?\nShe did not seem to have made it a mere geographical lesson, like Fanny\nGrigg--”\n\nEthel’s misanthropy was happily conducted off via the Cocksmoor\nchildren, and any lingering remains were dissipated by her amusement at\nDr. Spencer’s ecstasy on seeing Dr. May assume his red robe of office,\nto go to the minster in state, with the Town Council. He walked round\nand round his friend, called him Nicholas Randall redivivus, quoted\nDogberry, and affronted Gertrude, who had a dim idea that he was making\ngame of papa.\n\nEthel was one of those to whom representation was such a penance, that\na festival, necessitating hospitality to guests of her own rank, was\nburden enough seriously to disturb the repose of thankfulness for the\nattainment of her object, and to render difficult the recueillement\nwhich she needed for the praise and prayer that she felt due from her,\nand which seemed to oppress her heart, by a sense of inadequacy of her\npartial expression. It was well for her that the day began with the calm\nservice in the minster, where it was her own fault if cares haunted her,\nand she could confess the sin of her irritated sensations, and wishes to\nhave all her own way, and then, as ever, be led aright into thanksgiving\nfor the unlooked-for crowning of her labours.\n\nThe archdeacon’s sermon amplified what Margaret had that morning\nexpressed, so as to carry on her sense of appropriateness in the\nofferings of the day being bestowed on distant lands.\n\nBut the ordeal was yet to come, and though blaming herself, she was\nanything but comfortable, as the world repaired to the Town Hall, the\nroom where the same faces so often met for such diverse purposes--now an\norrery displayed by a conceited lecturer, now a ball, now a magistrates’\nmeeting, a concert or a poultry show, where rival Hamburg and Dorking\nuplifted their voices in the places of Mario and Grisi, all beneath the\nbenignant portrait of Nicholas Randall, ruffed, robed, square-toed, his\nendowment of the scholarship in his hand, and a chequered pavement at\nhis feet.\n\nWho knows not an S. P. G. meeting?--the gaiety of the serious, and the\nfirst public spectacle to the young, who, like Blanche and Aubrey, gaze\nwith admiration at the rows of bonnets, and with awe at the black coats\non the platform, while the relations of the said black coats suffer,\nlike Ethel, from nervous dread of the public speaking of their best\nfriends.\n\nHer expectations were realised by the archdeacon’s speech, which went\nround in a circle, as if he could not find his way out of it. Lord\nCosham was fluent, but a great many words went to very small substance;\nand no wonder, thought Ethel, when all they had to propose and second\nwas the obvious fact that missions were very good things.\n\nDr. Hoxton pompously, Sir Henry Walkinghame creditably, assisted the\nladies and gentlemen to resolve that the S. P. G. wanted help; Mr. Lake\nmade a stammering, and Mr. Rivers, with his good-natured face, hearty\nmanner, and good voice, came in well after him with a straightforward,\nspeech, so brief, that Ethel gave Flora credit for the best she had yet\nheard.\n\nMr. Wilmot said something which the sharpest ears in the front row\nmight, perhaps, have heard, and which resulted in Dr. Spencer standing\nup. Ethel hardly would have known who was speaking had her eyes been\nshut. His voice was so different, when raised and pitched, so as to show\nits power and sweetness; the fine polish of his manner was redoubled,\nand every sentence had the most graceful turn. It was like listening to\na well-written book, so smooth and so fluent, and yet so earnest--his\npictures of Indian life so beautiful, and his strong affection for the\nconverts he described now and then making his eyes fill, and his voice\nfalter, as if losing the thread of his studied composition--a true and\ndignified work of art, that made Dr. May whisper to Flora, “You see\nwhat he can do. They would have given anything to have had him for a\nlecturer.”\n\nWith half a sigh, Ethel saw Norman rise, and step forward. He began,\nwith eyes fixed on the ground, and in a low modest tone, to speak of\nthe islands that Harry had visited; but gradually the poetic nature,\ninherent in him, gained the mastery; and though his language was\nstrikingly simple, in contrast with Dr. Spencer’s ornate periods, and\nfree from all trace of “the lamp,” it rose in beauty and fervour at\nevery sentence. The feelings that had decided his lot gave energy to his\ndiscourse, and repressed as they had been by reserve and diffidence, now\nflowed forth, and gave earnestness to natural gifts of eloquence of the\nhighest order. After his quiet, unobtrusive beginning, there was the\nmore wonder to find how he seemed to raise up the audience with him,\nin breathless attention, as to a strain of sweet music, carrying them\nwithout thought of the scene, or of the speaker, to the lovely isles,\nand the inhabitants of noble promise, but withering for lack of\nknowledge; and finally closing his speech, when they were wrought up to\nthe highest pitch, by an appeal that touched them all home; “for well\ndid he know,” said he, “that the universal brotherhood was drawn\nclosest in circles nearer home, that beneath the shadow of their own old\nminster, gladness and mourning floated alike for all; and that all those\nwho had shared in the welcome to one, given back as it were from\nthe grave, would own the same debt of gratitude to the hospitable\nislanders.”\n\nHe ceased. His father wiped his spectacles, and almost audibly murmured,\n“Bless him!” Ethel, who had sat like one enchanted, forgetting who\nspoke, forgetting all save the islanders, half turned, and met Richard’s\nsmiling eyes, and his whisper, “I told you so.”\n\nThe impress of a man of true genius and power had been made throughout\nthe whole assembly; the archdeacon put Norman out of countenance by\nthe thanks of the meeting for his admirable speech, and all the world,\nexcept the Oxford men, were in a state of as much surprise as pleasure.\n\n“Splendid speaker, Norman May, if he would oftener put himself out,”\n Harvey Anderson commented. “Pity he has so many of the good doctor’s\nprejudices!”\n\n“Well, to be sure!” quoth Mrs. Ledwich. “I knew Mr. Norman was very\nclever, but I declare I never thought of such as this! I will try my\npoor utmost for those interesting natives.”\n\n“That youth has first-rate talents,” said Lord Cosham. “Do you know what\nhe is designed for? I should like to bring him forward.”\n\n“Ah!” said Dr. Hoxton. “The year I sent off May and Anderson was the\nproudest year of my life!”\n\n“Upon my word!” declared Mrs. Elwood. “That Dr. Spencer is as good as a\nbook, but Mr. Norman--I say, father, we will go without the new clock,\nbut we’ll send somewhat to they men that built up the church, and has no\nminister.”\n\n“A good move that,” said Dr. Spencer. “Worth at least twenty pounds.\nThat boy has the temperament of an orator, if the morbid were but a\ngrain less.”\n\n“Oh, Margaret,” exclaimed Blanche. “Dr. Spencer made the finest speech\nyou ever heard, only it was rather tiresome; and Norman made everybody\ncry--and Mary worse than all!”\n\n“There is no speaking of it. One should live such things, not talk over\nthem,” said Meta Rivers.\n\nMargaret received the reports of the select few, who visited her\nupstairs, where she was kept quiet, and only heard the hum of the swarm,\nwhom Dr. May, in vehement hospitality, had brought home to luncheon, to\nEthel’s great dread, lest there should not be enough for them to eat.\n\nMargaret pitied her sisters, but heard that all was going well; that\nFlora was taking care of the elders, and Harry and Mary were making the\nyounger fry very merry at the table on the lawn. Dr. May had to start\nearly to see a sick gardener at Drydale before coming on to Cocksmoor,\nand came up to give his daughter a few minutes.\n\n“We get on famously,” he said. “Ethel does well when she is in for it,\nlike Norman. I had no notion what was in the lad. They are perfectly\namazed with his speech. It seems hard to give such as he is up to\nthose outlandish places; but there, his speech should have taught me\nbetter--one’s best--and, now and then, he seems my best.”\n\n“One comfort is,” said Margaret, smiling, “you would miss Ethel more.”\n\n“Gallant old King! I am glad she has had her wish. Good-bye, my\nMargaret, we will think of you. I wish--”\n\n“I am very happy,” was Margaret’s gentle reassurance. “The dear little\nDaisy looks just as her godfather imagined her;” and happy was her face\nwhen her father quitted her.\n\nMargaret’s next visitor was Meta, who came to reclaim her bonnet, and,\nwith a merry smile, to leave word that she was walking on to Cocksmoor.\nMargaret remonstrated on the heat.\n\n“Let me alone,” said she, making her pretty wilful gesture. “Ethel and\nMary ought to have a lift, and I have had no walking to-day.”\n\n“My dear, you don’t know how far it is. You can’t go alone.”\n\n“I am lying in wait for Miss Bracy, or something innocent,” said Meta.\n“In good time--here comes Tom.”\n\nTom entered, declaring that he had come to escape from the clack\ndownstairs.\n\n“I’ll promise not to clack if you will be so kind as to take care of me\nto Cocksmoor,” said Meta.\n\n“Do you intend to walk?”\n\n“If you will let me be your companion.”\n\n“I shall be most happy,” said Tom, colouring with gratification, such\nas he might not have felt, had he known that he was chosen for his\ninnocence.\n\nHe took a passing glimpse at his neck-tie, screwed up the nap of his\nglossy hat to the perfection of its central point, armed himself with\na knowing little stick, and hurried his fair companion out by the back\ndoor, as much afraid of losing the glory of being her sole protector as\nshe was of falling in with an escort of as much consequence, in other\neyes, as was Mr. Thomas in his own.\n\nShe knew him less than any of the rest, and her first amusement was\nkeeping silence to punish him for complaining of clack; but he explained\nthat he did not mean quiet, sensible conversation--he only referred to\nthose foolish women’s raptures over the gabble they had been hearing at\nthe Town Hall.\n\nShe exclaimed, whereupon he began to criticise the speakers with a good\ndeal of acuteness, exposing the weak points, but magnanimously owning\nthat it was tolerable for the style of thing, and might go down at\nStoneborough.\n\n“I wonder you did not stay away as Harry did.”\n\n“I thought it would be marked,” observed the thread-paper Tom, as if he\nhad been at least county member.\n\n“You did quite right,” said Meta, really thinking so.\n\n“I wished to hear Dr. Spencer, too,” said Tom. “There is a man who does\nknow how to speak! He has seen something of the world, and knows what he\nis talking of.”\n\n“But he did not come near Norman.”\n\n“I hated listening to Norman,” said Tom. “Why should he go and set his\nheart on those black savages?”\n\n“They are not savages in New Zealand.”\n\n“They are all niggers together,” said Tom vehemently. “I cannot think\nwhy Norman should care for them more than for his own brothers and\nsisters. All I know is, that if I were my father, I would never give my\nconsent.”\n\n“It is lucky you are not,” said Meta, smiling defiance, though a tear\nshone in her eye. “Dr. May makes the sacrifice with a free heart and\nwilling mind.”\n\n“Everybody goes and sacrifices somebody else,” grumbled Tom.\n\n“Who are the victims now?”\n\n“All of us. What are we to do without Norman? He is worth all of us\nput together; and I--” Meta was drawn to the boy as she had never been\nbefore, as he broke off short, his face full of emotion, that made him\nremind her of his father.\n\n“You might go out and follow in his steps,” said she, as the most\nconsoling hope she could suggest.\n\n“Not I. Don’t you know what is to happen to me? Ah! Flora has not told\nyou. I thought she would not think it grand enough. She talked about\ndiplomacy--”\n\n“But what?” asked Meta anxiously.\n\n“Only that I am to stick to the old shop,” said Tom. “Don’t tell any\none; I would not have the fellows know it.”\n\n“Do you mean your father’s profession?”\n\n“Ay!”\n\n“Oh, Tom! you don’t talk of that as if you despised it?”\n\n“If it is good enough for him, it is good enough for me, I suppose,”\n said Tom. “I hate everything when I think of my brothers going over the\nworld, while I, do what I will, must be tied down to this slow place all\nthe rest of my days.”\n\n“If you were away, you would be longing after it.”\n\n“Yes; but I can’t get away.”\n\n“Surely, if the notion is so unpleasant to you, Dr. May would never\ninsist?”\n\n“It is my free choice, and that’s the worst of it.”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“Don’t you see? Norman told me it would be a great relief to him if I\nwould turn my mind that way--and I can’t go against Norman. I found he\nthought he must if I did not; and, you know, he is fit for all sorts of\nthings that--Besides, he has a squeamishness about him, that makes him\nturn white, if one does but cut one’s finger, and how he would ever go\nthrough the hospitals--”\n\nMeta suspected that Tom was inclined to launch into horrors. “So you\nwanted to spare him,” she said.\n\n“Ay! and papa was so pleased by my offering that I can’t say a word of\nthe bore it is. If I were to back out, it would come upon Aubrey, and\nhe is weakly, and so young, that he could not help my father for many\nyears.”\n\nMeta was much struck at the motives that actuated the self-sacrifice,\nveiled by the sullen manner which she almost began to respect. “What is\ndone for such reasons must make you happy,” she said; “though there may\nbe much that is disagreeable.”\n\n“Not the study,” said Tom. “The science is famous work. I like what I\nsee of it in my father’s books, and there’s a splendid skeleton at the\nhospital that I long to be at. If it were not for Stoneborough, it\nwould be all very well; but, if I should get on ever so well at the\nexaminations, it all ends there! I must come back, and go racing about\nthis miserable circuit, just like your gold pheasant rampaging in his\ncage, seeing the same stupid people all my days.”\n\n“I think,” said Meta, in a low, heartfelt voice, “it is a noble,\nbeautiful thing to curb down your ambition for such causes. Tom, I like\nyou for it.”\n\nThe glance of those beautiful eyes was worth having. Tom coloured a\nlittle, but assumed his usual gruffness. “I can’t bear sick people,” he\nsaid.\n\n“It has always seemed to me,” said Meta, “that few lives could come up\nto Dr. May’s. Think of going about, always watched for with hope, often\nbringing gladness and relief; if nothing else, comfort and kindness, his\nwhole business doing good.”\n\n“One is paid for it,” said Tom.\n\n“Nothing could ever repay Dr. May,” said Meta. “Can any one feel the fee\nanything but a mere form? Besides, think of the numbers and numbers that\nhe takes nothing from; and oh! to how many he has brought the most real\ngood, when they would have shut their doors against it in any other\nform! Oh, Tom, I think none of you guess how every one feels about your\nfather. I recollect one poor woman saying, after he had attended her\nbrother, ‘He could not save his body, but, surely, ma’am, I think he was\nthe saving of his soul.’”\n\n“It is of no use to talk of my being like my father,” said Tom.\n\nMeta thought perhaps not, but she was full of admiration of his\ngenerosity, and said, “You will make it the same work of love, and\ncharity is the true glory.”\n\nAny inroad on Tom’s reserved and depressed nature was a benefit; and he\nwas of an age to be susceptible of the sympathy of one so pretty and\nso engaging. He had never been so much gratified or encouraged, and,\nwishing to prolong the tete-a-tete, he chose to take the short\ncut through the fir-plantations, unfrequented on account of the\nperpendicular, spiked railings that divided it from the lane.\n\nMeta was humming-bird enough to be undismayed. She put hand and foot\nwherever he desired, flattered him by letting him handily help her up,\nand bounded light as a feather down on the other side, congratulating\nherself on the change from the dusty lane to the whispering pine\nwoods, between which wound the dark path, bestrewn with brown slippery\nneedle-leaves, and edged with the delicate feathering ling and tufts of\nsoft grass.\n\nTom had miscalculated the chances of interruption. Meta was lingering\nto track the royal highway of some giant ants to their fir-leaf hillock,\nwhen they were hailed from behind, and her squire felt ferocious at the\nsight of Norman and Harry closing the perspective of fir-trunks.\n\n“Hallo! Tom, what a guide you are!” exclaimed Norman. “That fence which\neven Ethel and Mary avoid!”\n\n“Mary climbs like a cow, and Ethel like a father-long-legs,” said Tom.\n“Now Meta flies like a bird.”\n\n“And Tom helped me so cleverly,” said Meta. “It was an excellent move,\nto get into the shade and this delicious pine tree fragrance.”\n\n“Halt!” said Norman--“this is too fast for Meta.”\n\n“I cannot,” said Harry. “I must get there in time to set Dr. Spencer’s\ntackle to rights. He is tolerably knowing about knots, but there is a\ndodge beyond him. Come on, Tom.”\n\nHe drew on the reluctant Etonian, who looked repiningly back at the\nincreasing distance between him and the other pair, till a turn in the\npath cut off his view.\n\n“I am afraid you do not know what you have undertaken,” said Norman.\n\n“I am a capital walker. And I know, or do not know, how often Ethel\ntakes the same walk.”\n\n“Ethel is no rule.”\n\n“She ought to be,” said Meta. “To be like her has always been my\nambition.”\n\n“Circumstances have formed Ethel.”\n\n“Circumstances! What an ambiguous word! Either Providence pointing to\nduty, or the world drawing us from it.”\n\n“Stepping-stones, or stumbling-blocks.”\n\n“And, oh! the difficult question, when to bend them, or to bend to\nthem!”\n\n“There must be always some guiding,” said Norman.\n\n“I believe there is,” said Meta, “but when trumpet-peals are ringing\naround, it is hard to know whether one is really ‘waiting beside the\ntent,’ or only dawdling.”\n\n“It is great self-denial in the immovable square not to join the\ncharge,” said Norman.\n\n“Yes; but they, being shot at, are not deceiving themselves.”\n\n“I suppose self-deception on those points is very common.”\n\n“Especially among young ladies,” said Meta. “I hear so much of what\ngirls would do, if they might, or could, that I long to see them like\nEthel--do what they can. And then it strikes me that I am doing the\nsame, living wilfully in indulgence, and putting my trust in my own\nmisgivings and discontent.”\n\n“I should have thought that discontent had as little to do with you as\nwith any living creature.”\n\n“You don’t know how I could growl!” said Meta, laughing. “Though\nless from having anything to complain of, than from having nothing to\ncomplain of.”\n\n“You mean,” he said, pausing, with a seriousness and hesitation that\nstartled her--“do you mean that this is not the course of life that you\nwould choose?”\n\nA sort of bashfulness made her put her answer playfully--\n\n\n          “All play and no work makes Jack a mere toy.\n\n\n“Toys have a kindly mission, and I may be good for nothing else; but I\nwould have rather been a coffee-pot than a china shepherdess.”\n\nThe gaiety disconcerted him, and he seemed to try to be silent, or to\nreply in the same tone, but he could not help returning to the subject.\n“Then you find no charm in the refinements to which you have been\nbrought up?”\n\n“Only too much,” said Meta.\n\nHe was silent, and fearing to have added to his fine-lady impression,\nshe resumed. “I mean that I never could dislike anything, and kindness\ngives these things a soul; but, of course, I should be better satisfied,\nif I lived harder, and had work to do.”\n\n“Meta!” he exclaimed, “you tempt me very much! Would you?--No, it is too\nunreasonable. Would you share--share the work that I have undertaken?”\n\nHe turned aside and leaned against a tree, as if not daring to watch the\neffect of the agitated words that had broken from him. She had little\nimagined whither his last sayings had been tending, and stood still,\nbreathless with the surprise.\n\n“Forgive me,” he said hastily. “It was very wrong. I never meant to have\nvexed you by the betrayal of my vain affection.”\n\nHe seemed to be going, and this roused her. “Stay, Norman,” exclaimed\nshe. “Why should it vex me? I should like it very much indeed.”\n\nHe faced suddenly towards her--“Meta, Meta! is it possible? Do you know\nwhat you are saying?”\n\n“I think I do.”\n\n“You must understand me,” said Norman, striving to speak calmly. “You\nhave been--words will not express what you have been to me for years\npast, but I thought you too far beyond my hopes. I knew I ought to be\nremoved from you--I believed that those who are debarred from earthly\nhappiness are marked for especial tasks. I never intended you to know\nwhat actuated me, and now the work is undertaken, and--and I cannot turn\nback,” he added quickly, as if fearing himself.\n\n“No indeed,” was her steady reply.\n\n“Then I may believe it!” cried Norman. “You do--you will--you\ndeliberately choose to share it with me?”\n\n“I will try not to be a weight on you,” answered the young girl, with\na sweet mixture of resolution and humility. “It would be the greatest\npossible privilege. I really do not think I am a fine lady ingrain, and\nyou will teach me not to be too unworthy.”\n\n“I? Oh, Meta, you know not what I am! Yet with you, with you to inspire,\nto strengthen, to cheer--Meta, Meta, life is so much changed before me,\nthat I cannot understand it yet--after the long dreary hopelessness--”\n\n“I can’t think why--” Meta had half said, when feminine dignity checked\nthe words, consciousness and confusion suddenly assailed her, dyed her\ncheeks crimson, and stifled her voice.\n\nIt was the same with Norman, and bashfulness making a sudden prey of\nboth--on they went under its dominion, in a condition partaking equally\nof discomfort and felicity; dreading the sound of their own voices,\nafraid of each other’s faces, feeling they were treating each other very\nstrangely and ungratefully, yet without an idea what to say next, or the\npower of speaking first; and therefore pacing onwards, looking gravely\nstraight along the path, as if to prevent the rabbits and foxgloves from\nguessing that anything had been passing between them.\n\nDr. May had made his call at Drydale, and was driving up a rough lane,\nbetween furzy banks, leading to Cocksmoor, when he was aware of a tall\ngentleman on one side of the road and a little lady on the other,\nwith the whole space of the cart-track between them, advancing soberly\ntowards him.\n\n“Hallo! Why, Meta! Norman! what brings you here? Where are you going?”\n\nNorman perceived that he had turned to the left instead of to the right,\nand was covered with shame.\n\n“That is all your wits are good for. It is well I met you, or you would\nhave led poor Meta a pretty dance! You will know better than to trust\nyourself to the mercies of a scholar another time. Let me give you a\nlift.”\n\nThe courteous doctor sprang out to hand Meta in, but something made him\nsuddenly desire Adams to drive on, and then turning round to the two\nyoung people, he said, “Oh!”\n\n“Yes,” said Norman, taking her hand, and drawing her towards him.\n\n“What, Meta, my pretty one, is it really so? Is he to be happy after\nall? Are you to be a Daisy of my own?”\n\n“If you will let me,” murmured Meta, clinging to her kind old friend.\n\n“No flower on earth could come so naturally to us,” said Dr. May. “And,\ndear child, at last I may venture to tell you that you have a sanction\nthat you will value more than mine. Yes, my dear, on the last day of\nyour dear father’s life, when some foreboding hung upon him, he spoke\nto me of your prospects, and singled out this very Norman as such as he\nwould prefer.”\n\nMeta’s tears prevented all, save the two little words, “thank you;” but\nshe put out her hand to Norman, as she still rested on the doctor’s arm,\nmore as if he had been her mother than Norman’s father.\n\n“Did he?” from Norman, was equally inexpressive of the almost\nincredulous gratitude and tenderness of his feeling.\n\nIt would not bear talking over at that moment, and Dr. May presently\nbroke the silence in a playful tone. “So, Meta, good men don’t like\nheiresses?”\n\n“Quite true,” said Meta, “it was very much against me.”\n\n“Or it may be the other way,” said Norman.\n\n“Eh? Good men don’t like heiresses--here’s a man who likes an\nheiress--therefore here’s a man that is not good? Ah, ha! Meta, you can\nsee that is false logic, though I’ve forgotten mine. And pray, miss,\nwhat are we to say to your uncle?”\n\n“He cannot help it,” said Meta quickly.\n\n“Ha!” said the doctor, laughing, “we remember our twenty-one years, do\nwe?”\n\n“I did not mean--I hope I said nothing wrong,” said Meta, in blushing\ndistress. “Only after what you said, I can care for nothing else.”\n\n“If I could only thank him,” said Norman fervently.\n\n“I believe you know how to do that, my boy,” said Dr. May, looking\ntenderly at the fairy figure between them, and ending with a sigh,\nremembering, perhaps, the sense of protection with which he had felt\nanother Margaret lean on his arm.\n\nThe clatter of horses’ hoofs caused Meta to withdraw her hand, and\nNorman to retreat to his own side of the lane, as Sir Henry Walkinghame\nand his servant overtook them.\n\n“We will be in good time for the proceedings,” called out the doctor.\n“Tell them we are coming.”\n\n“I did not know you were walking,” said Sir Henry to Meta.\n\n“It is pleasant in the plantations,” Dr. May answered for her; “but I\nam afraid we are late, and our punctual friends will be in despair. Will\nyou kindly say we are at hand?”\n\nSir Henry rode on, finding that he was not to be allowed to walk his\nhorse with them, and that Miss Rivers had never looked up.\n\n“Poor Sir Henry!” said Dr. May.\n\n“He has no right to be surprised,” said Meta, very low.\n\n“And so you were marching right upon Drydale!” continued Dr. May, not\nable to help laughing. “It was a happy dispensation that I met you.”\n\n“Oh, I am so glad of it!” said Meta.\n\n“Though to be sure you were disarming suspicion by so cautiously keeping\nthe road between you. I should never have guessed what you had been at.”\n\nThere was a little pause, then Meta said, rather tremulously, “Please--I\nthink it should be known at once.”\n\n“Our idle deeds confessed without loss of time, miss?”\n\nNorman came across the path, saying, “Meta is right--it should be\nknown.”\n\n“I don’t think Uncle Cosham would object, especially hearing it while he\nis here,” said Meta--“and if he knew what you told us.”\n\n“He goes to-morrow, does he not?” said Dr. May.\n\nA silence of perplexity ensued. Meta, brave as she was, hardly knew her\nuncle enough to volunteer, and Norman was privately devising a beginning\nby the way of George, when Dr. May said, “Well, since it is not a case\nfor putting Ethel in the forefront, I must e’en get it over for you, I\nsuppose.”\n\n“Oh, thank you,” they cried both at once, feeling that he was the\nproper person in every way, and Norman added, “The sooner the better, if\nMeta--”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes, the sooner the better,” exclaimed Meta. “And let me tell\nFlora--poor dear Flora--she is always so kind.”\n\nA testimony that was welcome to Dr. May, who had once, at least, been\nunder the impression that Flora courted Sir Henry’s attentions to her\nsister-in-law.\n\nFurther consultation was hindered by Tom and Blanche bursting upon them\nfrom the common, both echoing Norman’s former reproach of “A pretty\nguide!” and while Blanche explained the sufferings of all the assembly\nat their tardiness, Tom, without knowing it, elucidated what had been a\nmystery to the doctor, namely, how they ever met, by his indignation at\nNorman’s having assumed the guidance for which he was so unfit.\n\n“A shocking leader; Meta will never trust him again,” said Dr. May.\n\nStill Blanche thought them not nearly sufficiently sensible of\ntheir enormities, and preached eagerly about their danger of losing\nstanding-room, when they emerged on the moor, and beheld a crowd,\nabove whose heads rose the apex of a triangle, formed by three poles,\nsustaining a rope and huge stone.\n\n“Here comes Dr. Spencer,” she said. “I hope he will scold you.”\n\nWhatever Dr. Spencer might have suffered, he was far too polite to\nscold, and a glance between the two physicians ended in a merry twinkle\nof his bright eyes.\n\n“This way,” he said; “we are all ready.”\n\n“But where’s my little Daisy?” said Dr. May.\n\n“You’ll see her in a minute. She is as good as gold.”\n\nHe drew them on up the bank--people making way for them--till he had\nstationed them among the others of their own party, beside the deep\ntrench that traced the foundation, around a space that seemed far too\nsmall.\n\nNearly at the same moment began the soft clear sound of chanting wafted\nupon the wind, then dying away--carried off by some eddying breeze, then\nclear, and coming nearer and nearer.\n\n\n             I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep,\n                Nor mine eye-lids to slumber:\n             Neither the temples of my head to take any rest;\n             Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord:\n             An habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.\n\n\nFew, who knew the history of Cocksmoor, could help glancing towards the\nslight girl, who stood, with bent head, her hand clasped over little\nAubrey’s; while, all that was not prayer and thanksgiving in her mind,\nwas applying the words to him, whose head rested in the Pacific isle,\nwhile, in the place which he had chosen, was laid the foundation of the\ntemple that he had given unto the Lord.\n\nThere came forth the procession: the minster choristers, Dr. Spencer as\narchitect, and, in her white dress, little Gertrude, led between Harry\nand Hector, Margaret’s special choice for the occasion, and followed by\nthe Stoneborough clergy.\n\n\n             Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness.\n\n\nIt came in well with the gentle, meek, steadfast face of the young\ncurate of Cocksmoor, as he moved on in his white robe, and the sunlight\nshone upon his fair hair, and calm brow, thankful for the past, and\nhoping, more than fearing, for the future.\n\nThe prayers were said, and there was a pause, while Dr. Spencer and the\nforeman advanced to the machine and adjusted it. The two youths then led\nforward the little girl, her innocent face and large blue eyes wearing\na look of childish obedient solemnity, only half understanding what she\ndid, yet knowing it was something great.\n\nIt was very pretty to see her in the midst of the little gathering round\nthe foundation, the sturdy workman smiling over his hod of mortar, Dr.\nSpencer’s silver locks touching her flaxen curls as he held the shining\ntrowel to her, and Harry’s bright head and hardy face, as he knelt on\none knee to guide the little soft hand, while Hector stood by, still and\nupright, his eyes fixed far away, as if his thoughts were roaming to the\nreal founder.\n\nThe Victoria coins were placed--Gertrude scooped up the mass of mortar,\nand spread it about with increasing satisfaction, as it went so smoothly\nand easily, prolonging the operation, till Harry drew her back, while,\nslowly down creaked the ponderous corner-stone into the bed that she had\nprepared for it, and, with a good will, she gave three taps on it with\nher trowel.\n\nHarry had taken her hand, when, at the sight of Dr. May, she broke from\nhim, and, as if taking sudden fright at her own unwonted part, ran, at\nfull speed, straight up to her father, and clung to him, hiding her face\nas he raised her in his arms and kissed her.\n\nMeanwhile the strain arose:\n\n\n             Thou heavenly, new Jerusalem,\n             Vision of peace, in Prophet’s dream;\n             With living stones, built up on high,\n             And rising to the starry sky--\n\n\nThe blessing of peace seemed to linger softly and gently in the fragrant\nsummer breeze, and there was a pause ere the sounds of voices awoke\nagain.\n\n“Etheldred--” Mr. Wilmot stood beside her, ere going to unrobe in the\nschool--“Etheldred, you must once let me say, God bless you for this.”\n\nAs she knelt beside her sister’s sofa, on her return home, Margaret\npressed something into her hand. “If you please, dearest, give this\nto Dr. Spencer, and ask him to let it be set round the stem of the\nchalice,” she whispered.\n\nEthel recognised Alan Ernescliffe’s pearl hoop, the betrothal ring, and\nlooked at her sister without a word.\n\n“I wish it,” said Margaret gently. “I shall like best to know it there.”\n\nSo Margaret joined in Alan’s offering, and Ethel dared say no more, as\nshe thought how the “relic of a frail love lost” was becoming the “token\nof endless love begun.” There was more true union in this, than in\nclinging to the mere tangible emblem--for broken and weak is all\naffection that is not knit together above in the One Infinite Love.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\n\n     Of lowly fields you think no scorn,\n     Yet gayest gardens would adorn,\n        And grace wherever set;\n     Home, seated in your lowly bower,\n     Or wedded, a transplanted flower,\n        I bless you, Margaret.--CHARLES LAMB.\n\n\nGeorge Rivers had an antipathy to ladies’ last words keeping the horses\nstanding, and his wife and sister dutifully seated themselves in the\ncarriage at once, without an attempt to linger.\n\nFour of the young gentlemen were to walk across to Abbotstoke and dine\nat the Grange; and Tom, who, reasoning from analogy, had sent on his\nblack tie and agate studs, was so dismally disconcerted on finding that\nNorman treated his own going as a matter of course, that Richard,\nwhose chief use of his right of primogeniture was to set himself aside,\ndiscovered that he was wanted at home, and that Tom would be much better\nat the Grange, offering, at the same time, to send Norman’s dressing\nthings by Dr. Spencer.\n\n“Which,” observed Thomas, “he would never have recollected for himself.”\n\n“Tom would have had to lend him the precious studs.”--“He would not have\nhad them; who would wear imitation?” “I say, Tom, what did you give\nfor them?” “Better ask what the Jew gave for them, that bought them at\nWindsor Fair; not a bad imitation, either--pity they weren’t Malachite;\nbut, no doubt, the Jew thought green would be personal.” “As if they had\nany business to talk, who didn’t know a respectable stud when they saw\nit--Harry, especially, with his hat set on the back of his head, like a\nsailor on the stage”--(a leap to set it to rights--a skirmish, knocking\nTom nearly into the ditch). “Fine experience of the stage--all came from\nWindsor Fair.” “Ay, Hector might talk, but didn’t he pay a shilling\nto see the Irish giant. He wouldn’t confess, but it was a famous take\nin--giant had potatoes in his shoes.” “Not he; he was seven feet\nten high.” “Ay, when he stood upon a stool--Hector would swallow\nanything--even the lady of a million postage stamps had not stuck in\nhis throat--he had made Margaret collect for her.” “And, had not\nTom, himself, got a bottle of ointment to get the red out of his\nhair?”--(great fury). “His hair wasn’t red--didn’t want to change the\ncolour--not half so red as Hector’s own.” “What was it then? lively\nauburn?” But for fear of Norman’s losing his bearings, Harry would fetch\na carrot, to compare. “Better colour than theirs could ever be.” “Then\nwhat was the ointment for? to produce whiskers? that was the reason Tom\noiled himself like a Loyalty islander--his hair was so shiny, that Harry\nrecommended a top-knot, like theirs, etc.”\n\nNorman was, like the others, in such towering glee, and took so full a\nshare of the witticisms, that were the more noisily applauded, the worse\nthey were, that Harry suggested that “old June had lost his way, and\nfound his spirits in Drydale--he must have met with a private grog-shop\nin the plantations--would not Tom confess”--“not he; it was all in\nprivate. He thought it was laughing-gas, or the reaction of being fried\nall the morning, holding forth in that Town Hall. He had longed to make\na speech himself--no end of the good it would have done the old stagers\nto come out with something to the purpose. What would old Hoxton have\nthought of it?\n\n\n  “They shall dive for alligators, catch the wild goats by the beard;\n  Whistle to the cockatoos, and mock the hairy-faced baboon;\n  Worship mighty Mumbo Jumbo in the mountains of the moon.\n  I myself, in far Timbuctoo, leopard’s blood shall daily quaff;\n  Ride a tiger hunting, mounted on a thoroughbred giraffe.”\n\n\n“Not you, Tom!” cried Hector.\n\n\n  “You, the swell, the Eton fellow!  You, to seek such horrid places.\n  You to haunt with squalid negroes, blubber lips, and monkey faces.\n  Fool, again the dream, the fancy; don’t I know the words are mad,\n  For you count the gray barbarian lower than the Brocas cad!”\n\n\n“Nay, it is the consequence of misanthropy at the detection of the\nfrauds of unsophisticated society,” said Norman.\n\n\n                    The edge of life is rusted;\n The agate studs and whisker ointment left him very much disgusted.\n\n\n“Perhaps it was Miss Rivers forsaking him. Was not that rather\nspider-hearted, Tom?”\n\n“Come, Harry, it is time to have done. We are getting into civilised\nsociety--here’s Abbotstoke.”\n\n“Poor Norman, he is very far gone! He takes that scarecrow for civilised\nsociety!”\n\n“Much better clothed than the society you have been accustomed to,\nJuly.” “What a prize his wardrobe would be to the Black Prince!” “Don’t\ninsult your betters!” “Which? The scarecrow, or the Black Prince?”\n\nNorman tried to call his companions to order, for they were close upon\nthe village, and he began to tax himself with unbecoming levity; the\neffect of spirits pitched rather low, which did not easily find their\nbalance, under unwonted exhilaration, but Harry’s antics were less\neasily repressed than excited, and if Tom had not heard the Grange clock\nstrike half-past six, and had not been afraid of not having time to\narray himself, and watch over Harry’s neckcloth, they would hardly have\narrived in reasonable time. Dr. May had gone home, and there was no one\nin the drawing-room; but, as Norman was following the boys upstairs,\nFlora opened her sitting-room door, and attracted his attention by\nsilently putting her cold fingers into his hand, and drawing him into\nthe room.\n\n“Dear Norman, this is pleasant,” she said affectionately; but in a voice\nso sunken, that all gladness seemed to be dead within, and the\neffect was far more mournful than if she had not attempted to smile\ncongratulation.\n\n“I will give you till Dr. Spencer comes,” she said. “Then Norman can\ndress, and you must be a good child, and come down to me.”\n\nThe playfulness ill suited the wan, worn face that seemed to have caught\na gray tint from her rich poplin, her full toilet making the contrast\nalmost more painful; and, as she closed the door, her brother could only\nexclaim, “Poor Flora!”\n\n“She is so kind,” said the voice of the white figure that moved towards\nhim. “Oh, if we could comfort her!”\n\n“I trust to her own kindness working comfort to her, at last,” said\nNorman. “But is she often thus?”\n\n“Whenever she is not bearing up for George’s sake,” said Meta. “She\nnever says anything when she is alone with me, only she does not\nstruggle with her looks.”\n\n“It must be very trying for you.”\n\n“Nay, I feel grateful to her for even so far relaxing the restraint. If\nI could but do her any good.”\n\n“You cannot help doing her good,” said Norman.\n\nMeta sighed, and shook her head slightly, as she said, “She is so gentle\nand considerate. I think this has been no fresh pain to her to-day, but\nI cannot tell. The whole day has been a strange intermixture.”\n\n“The two strands of joy and grief have been very closely twisted,” said\nNorman. “That rose is shedding its fragrant leaves in its glory, and\nthere is much that should have chastened the overflowing gladness of\nto-day.”\n\n“As I was thinking,” whispered Meta, venturing nearer to him, and\nlooking into his face with the sweet reliance of union in thought. She\nmeant him to proceed, but he paused, saying, “You were thinking-”\n\n“I had rather hear it from you.”\n\n“Was it not that we were taught to-day what is enduring, and gives\ntrue permanence and blessedness to such--to what there was between\nErnescliffe and Margaret?”\n\nHer dewy eyes, and face of deep emotion, owned that he had interpreted\nher thought.\n\n“Theirs would, indeed, be a disheartening example,” he said, “if it did\nnot show the strength and peace that distance, sickness, death, cannot\ndestroy.”\n\n“Yes. To see that church making Margaret happy as she lies smiling on\nher couch, is a lesson of lessons.”\n\n“That what is hallowed must be blest,” said Norman; “whatever the sundry\nand manifold changes.”\n\nEach was far too humble to deny aloud any inequality with the goodness\nof Alan and Margaret, knowing that it would be at once disputed,\ntrusting to time to prevent the over-estimate, and each believing the\nother was the one to bring the blessing.\n\n“But, Meta,” said Norman, “have you heard nothing of--of the elders?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” said Meta, smiling, “have not you?”\n\n“I have seen no one.”\n\n“I have!” said Meta merrily. “Uncle Cosham is delighted. That speech of\nyours has captivated him. He calls me a wise little woman to have found\nout your first-rate abilities. There’s for you, sir.”\n\n“I don’t understand it! Surely he must be aware of my intentions?”\n\n“He said nothing about them; but, of course, Dr. May must have mentioned\nthem.”\n\n“I should have thought so, but I cannot suppose--”\n\n“That he would be willing to let me go,” said Meta. “But then you know\nhe cannot help it,” added she, with a roguish look, at finding herself\nmaking one of her saucy independent speeches.\n\n“I believe you are taking a would-be missionary instead of Norman May!”\n he answered, with a sort of teasing sweetness.\n\n“All would-be missionaries did not make dear papa so fond of them,” said\nMeta, very low; “and you would not be Norman May without such purposes.”\n\n“The purpose was not inspired at first by the highest motive,” said\nNorman; “but it brought me peace, and, after the kind of dedication\nthat I inwardly made of myself in my time of trouble, it would take some\nweighty reason, amounting to a clear duty, or physical impossibility,\nto make me think I ought to turn back. I believe”--the tears rose to\nhis eyes, and he brought out the words with difficulty--“that, if this\ngreatest of all joys were likely to hinder me from my calling, I ought\nto seek strength to regard it as a temptation, and to forgo it.”\n\n“You ought, if it were so,” said Meta, nevertheless holding him tighter.\n“I could not bear to keep back a soldier. If this were last year, and\nI had any tie or duty here, it would be very hard. But no one needs me,\nand if the health I have always had be continued to me, I don’t think I\nshall be much in the way. There,”--drawing back a little, and trying to\nlaugh off her feeling--“only tell me at once if you think me still too\nmuch of a fine lady.”\n\n“I--you--a fine lady! Did anything ever give you the impression that I\ndid?”\n\n“I shall not get poor Harry into a scrape, shall I? He told me that you\nsaid so, last spring, and I feared you judged me too truly.”\n\nAfter a few exclamations of utter surprise, it flashed on Norman. “I\nknow, I know--Harry interpreted my words in his own blunt fashion!”\n\n“Then you did say something like it?”\n\n“No, but--but--In short, Meta, these sailors’ imaginations go to great\nlengths. Harry had guessed more than I knew myself, before he had\nsailed, and taxed me with it. It was a subject I could not bear then,\nand I answered that you were too far beyond my hopes.”\n\n“Six years ago!” said Meta slowly, blushing deeper and deeper. “Some\neyes saw it all that time, and you--and,” she added, laughing, though\nrather tearfully, “I should never have known it, if Tom had not taken me\nthrough the plantations!”\n\n“Not if I had not discovered that your preferences did not lie--”\n\n“Among boudoirs and balls?” said Meta. “Harry was right. You thought me\na fine lady after all.”\n\nThe gay taunt was cut short by a tap at the door, and Flora looked in.\n\n“Dr. Spencer has brought your things, Norman. I am sorry to disturb\nyou--but come down, Meta--I ran away very uncivilly to fetch you. I hope\nit is not too cruel,” as she drew Meta’s arm into her own, and added, “I\nhave not been able speak to George.”\n\nMeta suspected that, in the wish to spare her, Flora had abstained from\nseeking him.\n\nThe evening went off like any other evening--people ate and talked,\nthought Mrs. Rivers looking very ill, and Miss Rivers very pretty--Flora\nforced herself into being very friendly to Sir Henry, commiserating the\ndisappointment to which she had led him; and she hoped that he suspected\nthe state of affairs, though Tom, no longer supplanted by his elder\nbrother, pursued Meta into the sheltered nook, where Flora had favoured\nher seclusion, to apologise for having left her to the guidance of poor\nNorman, whose head was with the blackamoors. It was all Harry’s fault.\n\n“Nonsense, Tom,” said Harry; “don’t you think Norman is better company\nthan you any day?”\n\n“Then why did you not walk him off instead of me?” said Tom, turning\nround sharply.\n\n“Out of consideration for Meta. She will tell you that she was very much\nobliged to me--”\n\nHarry checked himself, for Meta was colouring so painfully that his own\nsunburned face caught the glow. He pushed Tom’s slight figure aside with\na commanding move of his broad hand, and said, “I beg your pardon, upon\nmy word, though I don’t know what for.”\n\n“Nor I,” said Meta, rallying herself, and smiling. “You have no pardon\nto beg. You will know it all to-morrow.”\n\n“Then I know it now,” said Harry, sheltering his face by leaning over\nthe back of a chair, and taming the hearty gaiety of his voice. “Well\ndone, Meta; there’s nothing like old June in all the world! You may take\nmy word for it, and I knew you would have the sense to find it out.”\n\nThey were well out of sight, and Meta only answered by a good tight\nsqueeze of his kind hand between both her own. Tom, suddenly recovering\nfrom his displeasure at being thrust aside, whisked round, dropped on a\nfootstool before Meta, looked up in her face, and said, “Hallo!” in\nsuch utter amazement that there was nothing for it but to laugh more\nuncontrollably than was convenient. “Come along, Tom,” said Harry,\npulling him up by force, “she does not want any of your nonsense. We\nwill not plague her now.”\n\n“Thank you, Harry,” said Meta. “I cannot talk rationally just yet. Don’t\nthink me unkind, Tom.”\n\nTom sat in a sort of trance all the rest of the evening.\n\nLord Cosham talked to Norman, who felt as if he were being patronised\non false pretences, drew into his shell, and displayed none of his\n“first-rate abilities.”\n\nDr. Spencer discussed his architecture with the archdeacon; but his\nblack eyes roamed heedfully after the young gentleman and lady, in the\nopposite corners of the room; and, as he drove home afterwards with\nthe youths, he hummed scraps of Scottish songs, and indulged in silent\nsmiles.\n\nThose at home had been far more demonstrative. Dr. May had arrived,\ndeclaring himself the proudest doctor in her Majesty’s dominions, and\nEthel needed nothing but his face to explain why, and tell her that dear\nold June’s troubles were over, and their pretty little Meta was their\nown--a joy little looked for to attend their foundation-stone.\n\nThe dreaded conference with Lord Cosham had proved highly gratifying.\nThere might be something in the fact that he could not help it,\nwhich assisted in his ready acquiescence, but he was also a sensible\nright-minded man, who thought that the largeness of Meta’s fortune was\nno reason that it should be doubled; considered that, in the matter of\nconnection, the May family had the advantage, and saw in Norman; a young\nman whom any one might have pleasure in bringing forward. Oxford had\nestablished confidence both in his character and talents, and his speech\nhad been such as to impress an experienced man, like Lord Cosham, with\nan opinion of his powers, that prepared a welcome for him, such as no\none could have dared to expect. His lordship thought his niece not only\nlikely to be happier, but to occupy a more distinguished position with\nsuch a man as Norman May, than with most persons of ready-made rank and\nfortune.\n\nThe blushing and delighted Dr. May had thought himself bound to speak of\nhis son’s designs, but he allowed that the project had been formed under\ngreat distress of mind, and when he saw it treated by so good a man,\nas a mere form of disappointed love, he felt himself reprieved from the\nhardest sacrifice that he had ever been called on to make, loved little\nMeta the better for restoring his son, and once more gave a free course\nto the aspirations that Norman’s brilliant boyhood had inspired. Richard\ntook the same view, and the evening passed away in an argument--as if\nany one had been disputing with them--the father reasoning loud, the son\nenforcing it low, that it had become Norman’s duty to stay at home to\ntake care of Meta, whose father would have been horrified at his taking\nher to the Antipodes. They saw mighty tasks for her fortune to effect\nin England, they enhanced each other’s anticipations of Norman’s career,\noverthrew abuses before him, heaped distinctions upon him, and had made\nhim Prime Minister and settled his policy, before ten o’clock brought\ntheir schemes to a close.\n\nMary gazed and believed; Margaret lay still and gently assented; Ethel\nwas silent at first, and only when the fabric became extremely airy and\nmagnificent, put in her word with a vehement dash at the present abuses,\nwhich grieved her spirit above all, and, whether vulnerable or not,\nNorman was to dispose of, like so many giants before Mr. Great-heart.\n\nShe went upstairs, unable to analyse her sentiments. To be spared\nthe separation would be infinite relief--all this prosperity made her\nexult--the fair girl at the Grange was the delight of her heart, and yet\nthere was a sense of falling off; she disliked herself for being either\nglad or sorry, and could have quarrelled with the lovers for perplexing\nher feelings so uncomfortably.\n\nThough she sat up till the party returned, she was inclined to be\nsupposed in bed, so as to put off the moment of meeting; but Margaret,\nwho she hoped was asleep, said from her pillow, “Ask dear Norman to let\nme give him one kiss.”\n\nShe ran down headlong, clutched Norman as he was taking off his\ngreatcoat, told him that Margaret wanted him, and dragged him up without\nletting him go, till she reached the first landing, where she stood\nstill, saying breathlessly, “New Zealand.”\n\n“If I wished to fail, she would keep me to it.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Ethel, claiming heartily his caress. “I was\nwrong to doubt either of you. Now, I know how to feel! But Margaret must\nnot wait.”\n\nThe happy youth, in the flush of love and joy, bent gently, almost\ntearfully, down in silence to the white form, half seen in the twilight,\nwhose hopes had fleeted away from earth, and who was calmly, softly\ngliding after them. Hardly a word was uttered, but of all the many\nheartfelt thoughts that had passed while the face was pressed into\nMargaret’s pillow, and her sympathising arms round the neck, surely none\nwas ever deeper, than was his prayer and vow that his affection should\nbe like hers, unearthly, and therefore enduring.\n\nThe embrace was all; Margaret must not be agitated, and, indeed, the\nevents of the day had been too much for her, and the ensuing morning\nbrought the fluttering of heart and prostration of strength, no longer\na novelty and occasion of immediate terror, but the token of the waning\npower of life.\n\nTill she was better, her father had no thoughts for aught else, but,\nas with many another invalid, the relief from present distress was as\ncheering as if it had been recovery, and ere night, her placid look\nof repose had returned, and she was devising pretty greetings for her\nnewest Daisy.\n\nPerhaps the sobering effect of these hours of anxiety was in Norman’s\nfavour, on entering into conversation with his father. Those visions,\nwhich had had their swing the night before, belonged to the earlier,\nmore untamed period of Dr. May’s life, and had melted away in the dim\nroom, made sacred by lingering mementos of his wife, and in the sound of\nthat panting breath and throbbing heart. His vehemence had been, after\nall, chiefly against his own misgivings, and when he heard of his son’s\nresolution, and Meta’s more than acquiescence, he was greatly touched,\nand recurred to his kind, sorrowful promise, that he would never be\na stumbling-block in the path of his children. Still he owned himself\ngreatly allured by the career proposed by Lord Cosham, and thought\nNorman should consider the opportunities of doing good in, perhaps, a\nstill more important and extensive field than that which he had chosen.\n\n“Time was that I should have grasped at such a prospect,” said Norman;\n“but I am not the man for it. I have too much ambition, and too little\nhumility. You know, father, how often you have had to come to my rescue,\nwhen I was running after success as my prime object.”\n\n“Vanity fair is a dangerous place, but you who have sound principles and\npure motives--”\n\n“How long would my motives be pure?” said Norman. “Rivalry and\nparty-spirit make me distrust my motives, and then my principles feel\nthe shock. Other men are marked by station for such trials, and may be\ncarried through them, but I am not.”\n\n“Yet some of these men are far from your equals.”\n\n“Not perhaps in speechifying,” said Norman, smiling; “but in steadiness\nof aim, in patience, in callousness, in seeing one side of the question\nat once.”\n\n“You judge rightly for your own peace; you will be the happier; I always\ndoubted whether you had nerve to make your wits available.”\n\n“It may be cowardice,” said Norman, “but I think not. I could burn for\nthe combat; and if I had no scruples, I could enjoy bearing down such\nas--”\n\nOf course Dr. May burst in with a political name, and--“I wish you were\nat him!”\n\n“Whether I could is another matter,” said Norman, laughing; “but the\nfact is, that I stand pledged; and if I embraced what to me would be\na worldly career, I should be running into temptation, and could not\nexpect to be shielded from it.”\n\n“Your old rule,” said Dr. May. “Seek to be less rather than more. But\nthere is another choice. Why not a parsonage at home?”\n\n“Pleasant parishes are not in the same need,” said Norman.\n\n“I wonder what poor old Rivers would say to you, if he knew what you\nwant to do with his daughter! Brought up as she has been--to expose her\nto the roughness of a colonial life, such as I should hesitate about for\nyour sisters.”\n\n“It is her own ardent desire.”\n\n“True, but are girlish enthusiasms to be trusted? Take care, Norman,\ntake care of her--she is a bit of the choicest porcelain of human kind,\nand not to be rudely dealt with.”\n\n“No, indeed, but she has the brave enterprising temper, to which I fully\nbelieve that actual work, in a good cause, is far preferable to what she\ncalls idleness. I do not believe that we are likely to meet with more\nhardship than she would gladly encounter, and would almost--nay, quite\nenjoy.”\n\n“You do not know what your aunt has had to go through.”\n\n“A few years make a great difference in a colony. Still, it may be right\nfor me to go out alone and judge for her; but we shall know more if my\naunt comes home.”\n\n“Yes, I could trust a good deal to her. She has much of your mother’s\nsense. Well, you must settle it as you can with Meta’s people! I do not\nthink they love the pretty creature better than I have done from the\nfirst minute we saw her--don’t you remember it, Norman?”\n\n“Remember it? Do I not? From the frosted cedar downwards! It was the\nfirst gem of spring in that dreary winter. What a Fairyland the Grange\nwas to me!”\n\n“You may nearly say the same of me,” confessed Dr. May, smiling; “the\nsight of that happy little sunny spirit, full of sympathy and sweetness,\nalways sent me brighter on my way. Wherever you may be, Norman, I am\nglad you have her, being one apt to need a pocket sunbeam.”\n\n“I hope my tendencies are in no danger of depressing her!” said Norman,\nstartled. “If so--”\n\n“No such thing--she will make a different man of you. You have been\ndepressed by--that early shock, and the gap at our own fireside--all\nthat we have shared together, Norman. To see you begin on a new score,\nwith a bright home of your own, is the best in this world that I could\nwish for you, though I shall live over my own twenty-two years in\nthinking of you, and that sweet little fairy. But now go, Norman--she\nwill be watching for you and news of Margaret. Give her all sorts of\nlove from me.”\n\nNorman fared better with the uncle than he had expected. Lord Cosham, as\na philanthropist, could not, with any consistency, set his face against\nmissions, even when the cost came so near home; and he knew that\nopposition made the like intentions assume a heroic aspect that\nmaintained them in greater force. He therefore went over the subject\nin a calm dispassionate manner, which exacted full and grateful\nconsideration from the young man.\n\nThe final compromise was, that nothing should be settled for a year,\nduring which Norman would complete his course of study, and the matter\nmight be more fully weighed. Mrs. Arnott would probably return, and\nbring experience and judgment, which would, or ought to, decide the\nquestion--though Meta had a secret fear that it might render it more\ncomplicated than ever. However, the engagement and the mission views had\nboth been treated so much more favourably than could have been hoped,\nthat they felt themselves bound to be patient and forbearing. As Meta\nsaid, “If they showed themselves wilful children, they certainly did not\ndeserve to be trusted anywhere.”\n\nLord Cosham made his niece listen to a kind exhortation not to press her\ninfluence towards a decision that might be repented, when too late to be\nrepaired, without a degrading sense of failure--putting her in mind of\nthe privations that would lose romance by their pettiness, and which\nmoney could not remedy; and very sensibly representing that the effect\nof these on temper and health was to be duly considered as a serious\nimpediment to usefulness.\n\n“It would be worse for him alone,” said Meta.\n\n“That is not certain,” said her uncle. “A broken-down wife is a terrible\ndrag.”\n\n“I know it is so,” said Meta firmly, “but risks must be run, and he is\nwilling to take the chance. I do not think it can be presumption, for,\nyou know, I am strong; and Dr. May would say if he could not warrant me.\nI fancy household work would be more satisfactory and less tiring than\ndoing a season thoroughly, and I mean to go through a course of Finchley\nmanuals in preparation.”\n\n“I hope you know what you are doing,” sighed her uncle. “You see it all\ncouleur de rose.”\n\n“I think not. It is because it is not couleur de rose that I am so much\nbent upon it. I have had plenty of that all my life. I expect much that\nwill be very disagreeable and not at all heroic; but if I can only make\nNorman think it fun, that will be one purpose answered. I do believe he\nwill do his work better for having me, and, at least, I shall pay his\npassage.”\n\nHer uncle shook his head, but did not try to say any more. George\nhad begun by loud exclamations against the project, in which he was\nvehemently abetted by Tom, who primed him with all sorts of outrageous\nabuse of the niggers and cannibals, who would make Norman’s coats out of\nall shape, and devour little Meta at a mouthful--predictions which Meta\naccepted most merrily, talking of herself so resignedly, as bound upon\na spit, and calling out to be roasted slower and faster, that she safely\nconducted off their opposition by way of a standing joke. As to Norman’s\ncoats, she threatened to make them herself, and silenced Tom for ever\nby supposing, in malicious simplicity, that he must be able to teach her\nthe most unexceptional cut.\n\nFlora kept her opinions to herself. Only once, when urged to\nremonstrate, she said, “I could not--I would not.”\n\nShe was gently and touchingly considerate towards the lovers, silently\nbut unobtrusively obviating all that could jar on their feelings, and\nemploying her exquisite tact in the kindest manner.\n\nShe released Meta from the expedition to Ryde, silencing scruples on\nthe one hand, by a suggestion of “poor Sir Henry,” and, on the other,\nby offering to exchange her for Mary. The first proposal made Mary take\nsuch a spring in her chair, with eyes so round, and cheeks so red, and\nsuch a shriek about Harry and the Bucephalus, that no one could have\nborne to say one word in opposition, even if it had not been the opinion\nof the Council that sea air would best repair Mary’s strength.\n\nEthel had some private fears of a scene, since it was one of Miss\nBracy’s idiosyncrasies to be hurt whenever Mary was taken out of her\nhands; and she went to announce the design, in dread lest this shock\nshould destroy the harmony that had prevailed for many months; nay, she\nalmost believed, since the loss of the Alcestis had been known.\n\nShe was agreeably surprised. Miss Bracy thought Mary in need of the\nchange, and discussed both her and Blanche in so pleasant and sensible\na manner, that Ethel was quite relieved. She partook in Mary’s\nanticipations of pleasure, forwarded her preparations, and was delighted\nwith her promise of letters--promises that Mary bestowed so largely,\nin the fullness of her heart, that there were fears lest her whole time\nshould be spent in writing.\n\nHer soft heart indulged in a shower of tears when she wished them all\ngood-bye; and Ethel and Blanche found the house was very empty without\nher; but that was only till Meta came in from a walk with Norman, and,\nunder the plea of trying to supply Mary’s place, did the work of five\nMaries, and a great deal besides.\n\nNothing could be happier than Meta’s visit, brightening the house so\nthat the Mays thought they had never known half her charms, helping\nwhatever was going on, yet ready to play with Daisy, tell stories to\nAubrey, hear Tom’s confidences, talk to Margaret, read with Norman, and\nteach Richard singing for his school children. The only vexation was,\nthat every one could not always engross her entirely; and Dr. May used\nto threaten that they should never spare her to that long-legged fellow,\nNorman.\n\nShe had persuaded Bellairs to go and take care of Flora and Mary,\ninstead of the French maid--a plan which greatly satisfied Margaret, who\nhad never liked the looks of Coralie, and which Meta held to be a grand\nemancipation. She persuaded old nurse to teach her to be useful, and\nMargaret used to declare that she witnessed scenes as good as a play in\nher room, where the little dexterous scholar, apparently in jest, but\nreally in sober, earnest, wiled instruction from the old woman; and made\nher experiments, between smiles and blushes, and merrily glorying in\nresults that promised that she would be a notable housewife. Whether\nit were novelty or not, she certainly had an aptitude and delight in\ndomestic details, such as Ethel never could attain; and, as Dr. May\nsaid, the one performed by a little finger what the other laboured at\nwith a great mind.\n\nIn the schoolroom, Meta was as highly appreciated. She found an hour\nfor helping Blanche in her music, and for giving, what was still more\nuseful, an interest and spirit to studies, where, it must be owned, poor\ngood Mary had been a dead weight. She enlivened Miss Bracy so much, and\nso often contrived a walk or a talk with her, that the saucy Blanche\ntold Hector that she thought Ethel would be quite second-fiddle with\nMiss Bracy.\n\nNo such thing. Miss Bracy’s great delight was in having a listener\nfor her enthusiasm about Miss Ethel. She had been lately having a\ncorrespondence with a former school-fellow, who was governess in a\nfamily less considerate than the Mays, and who poured out, in her\nletters, feelings much like those with which Miss Bracy had begun.\n\nNothing could be more salutary than to find herself repeating all\nEthel’s pieces of advice; and, one day, when her friend had been more\ndistressed than usual, she called Ethel herself, to consult on her\nanswer, owning how much she was reminded of herself.\n\n“Indeed,” she added, “I am afraid it would only tease you to hear how\nmuch I am indebted to your decision and kindness--”\n\n“Nay,” said Ethel, laughing her awkward laugh. “You have often had to\nforget my savage ways.”\n\n“Pray don’t say that--”\n\n“I think,” said Ethel, breaking in, “the philosophy is this: I believe\nthat it is a trying life. I know teaching takes a great deal out of\none; and loneliness may cause tendencies to dwell on fancied slights in\ntrifles, that might otherwise be hurried over. But I think the thing\nis, to pass them over, and make a conscience of turning one’s mind to\nsomething fresh--”\n\n“As you made me do, when you brought me amusing books, and taught me\nbotany--”\n\n“And, still more, when you took to working for the infant school. Yes, I\nthink the way to be happy and useful is to get up many interests, so as\nto be fresh and vigorous, and think not at all of personalities. There’s\na truism!”\n\n“Very true, though,” said Miss Bracy. “Indeed, all your kindness and\nconsideration would never have done me half the good they have, dear\nMiss Ethel, if you had not taught me that referring all to one’s own\nfeelings and self is the way to be unhappy.”\n\n“Just so,” said Ethel. “It is the surest way for any one to be\nmiserable.”\n\n“If I could only persuade poor dear Ellen to think that even if a slight\nwere real, it ought to be borne forgivingly, and not brooded over. Ah!\nyou are laughing; perhaps you have said the same about me.”\n\n“You would forgive it now, I think,” said Ethel.\n\n“I never thought I did not forgive. I did not see that brooding over\nvexations was not pardoning them. I have told her so now; and, oh! if\nshe could but have seen how true sorrows are borne here, she would be\ncured, like me, of making imaginary ones.”\n\n“None could help being better for living with papa,” said Ethel.\n\nEthel made Miss Bracy happy by a kiss before she left her. It was a\ncheering belief that, whatever the future trials of her life might\nbe, the gentle little lady would meet them with a healthier mind, more\nvigorous in overlooking troubles and without punctilious sensitiveness\non the lookout for affronts. “Believing all things, bearing all things,\nhoping all things, enduring all things,” would be to her the true secret\nof serenity of spirits.\n\nEthel might not have been blameless or consistent in her dealings in\nthis difficult intercourse, but her kind heart, upright intention, and\nforce of character, had influence far beyond her own perception. Indeed,\nshe knew not that she had personal influence at all, but went on in her\nown straightforward humility.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\n\n     “Enough of foresight sad, too much\n      Of retrospect have I;\n     And well for me, that I, sometimes,\n      Can put those feelings by.\n\n     There speaks the man we knew of yore,\n      Well pleased, I hear them say;\n     Such was he, in his lighter moods,\n      Before our heads were gray.\n\n     Buoyant he was in spirit, quick\n      Of fancy, light of heart;\n     And care, and time, and change have left\n      Untouch’d his better part.”--SOUTHEY.\n\n\nEtheldred May and Meta Rivers were together in the drawing-room. The\ntimepiece pointed towards ten o’clock, but the tea-things were on the\ntable, prepared for a meal, the lamp shone with a sort of consciousness,\nand Ethel moved restlessly about, sometimes settling her tea equipage,\nsometimes putting away a stray book, or resorting by turns to her book,\nor to work a red and gold scroll on coarse canvas, on the other end of\nwhich Meta was employed.\n\n“Nervous, Ethel?” said Meta, looking up with a merry provoking smile,\nknowing how much the word would displease.\n\n“That is for you,” retorted Ethel, preferring to carry the war into the\nenemy’s quarters. “What, don’t you know that prudent people say that\nyour fate depends on her report?”\n\n“At least,” said Meta, laughing; “she is a living instance that every\none is not eaten up, and we shall see if she fulfils Tom’s prediction\nof being tattooed, or of having a slice out of the fattest part of her\ncheek.”\n\n“I know very well,” said Ethel, “the worst she said it would be, the\nmore you would go.”\n\n“Not quite that,” said Meta, blushing, and looking down.\n\n“Come, don’t be deceitful!” said Ethel. “You know very well that you are\nstill more bent on it than you were last year.”\n\n“To be sure I am!” said Meta, looking up with a sudden beamy flash of\nher dark eyes. “Norman and I know each other so much better now,” she\nadded, rather falteringly.\n\n“Ay! I know you are ready to go through thick and thin, and that is\nwhy I give my consent and approbation. You are not to be stopped for\nnonsense.”\n\n“Not for nonsense, certainly,” said Meta, “but”--and her voice became\ntremulous--“if Dr. May deliberately said it would be wrong, and that I\nshould be an encumbrance and perplexity, I am making up my mind to the\nchance.”\n\n“But what would you do?” asked Ethel.\n\n“I don’t know. You should not ask such questions, Ethel.”\n\n“Well! it won’t happen, so it is no use to talk about it,” said Ethel.\n“Fancy my having made you cry.”\n\n“Very silly of me,” said Meta, brightening and laughing, but sighing. “I\nam only afraid Mrs. Arnott may think me individually unfit for the kind\nof life, as if I could not do what other women can. Do I look so?”\n\n“You look as if you were meant to be put under a glass case!” said\nEthel, surveying the little elegant figure, whose great characteristic\nwas a look of exquisite finish, not only in the features and colouring,\nthe turn of the head, and the shape of the small rosy-tipped fingers,\nbut in everything she wore, from the braids of black silk hair, to the\nlittle shoe on her foot, and even in the very lightness and gaiety of\nher movements.\n\n“Oh, Ethel!” cried Meta, springing up in dismay, and looking at herself\nin the glass. “What is the matter with me? Do tell me!”\n\n“You’ll never get rid of it,” said Ethel, “unless you get yourself\ntattooed! Even separation from Bellairs hasn’t answered. And, after all,\nI don’t think it would be any satisfaction to Norman or papa. I assure\nyou, Meta, whatever you may think of it, it is not so much bother to be\nprettier than needful, as it is to be uglier than needful.”\n\n“What is needful?” said Meta, much amused.\n\n“I suppose to be like Mary, so that nobody should take notice of one,\nbut that one’s own people may have the satisfaction of saying, ‘she\nis pleasing,’ or ‘she is in good looks.’ I think Gertrude will come to\nthat. That’s one comfort.”\n\n“That is your own case, Ethel. I have heard those very things said of\nyou.”\n\n“Of my hatchet face!” said Ethel contemptuously. “Some one must have\nbeen desperately bent on flattering the Member’s family.”\n\n“I could repeat more,” said Meta, “if I were to go back to the\nCommemoration, and to the day you went home.”\n\nEthel crimsoned, and made a sign with her hand, exclaiming, “Hark!”\n\n“It went past.”\n\n“It was the omnibus. She must be walking down!” Ethel breathed short,\nand wandered aimlessly about; Meta put her arm round her waist.\n\n“I did not think this would be so much to you,” she said.\n\n“Oh, Meta, it seems like dear mamma coming to see how we have been going\non. And then papa! I wish I had gone up to the station with him.”\n\n“He has Richard.”\n\n“Ay, but I am afraid Margaret is listening and will be restless, and\nhave a palpitation; and I can’t go and see, or I shall disturb her. Oh,\nI wish it were over.”\n\nMeta stroked her, and soothed her, and assured her that all would do\nwell, and presently they heard the click of the door. Ethel flew into\nthe hall, where she stopped short, her heart beating high at the sound\nof overpoweringly familiar accents.\n\nShe was almost relieved by detecting otherwise little resemblance; the\nheight was nearly the same, but there was not the plump softness of\noutline. Mrs. Arnott was small, thin, brisk and active, with a vivacious\ncountenance, once evidently very fair and pretty, but aged and worn by\ntoil, not trouble, for the furrows were the traces of smiles around her\nmerry mouth, and beautiful blue eyes, that had a tendency lo laugh and\ncry both at once. Dr. May who had led her into the light, seemed to be\nlooking her all over, while Richard was taking the wraps from her, and\nEthel tried to encourage herself to go forward.\n\n“Ay!” said the doctor, kissing her. “I see you, Flora, now. I have found\nyou again.”\n\n“I found you as soon as I heard your voice, Richard,” said she. “And now\nfor the bairnies.”\n\n“Here is one, but there is but a poor show forthcoming to-night. Do you\nknow her?”\n\nThere was an unspeakable joy in being pressed in Aunt Flora’s arms, like\na returning beam from the sunshine of seven years ago.\n\n“This must be Ethel! My dear, how you tower above me--you that I left in\narms! And,” as she advanced into the drawing-room--“why, surely this is\nnot Margaret!”\n\n“A Margaret--not the Margaret. I wish I were,” said Meta, as Mrs. Arnott\nstood with an arm on her shoulder, in the midst of an embrace, Dr. May\nenjoying her perplexity and Meta’s blushes. “See, Flora, these black\nlocks never belonged to Calton Hill daisies, yet a daisy of my own she\nis. Can’t you guess?”\n\n“Miss Rivers!” exclaimed Mrs. Arnott; and though she kissed her\ncordially, Meta suspected a little doubt and disappointment.\n\n“Yes,” said Dr. May. “We change Mary for this little woman as Flora’s\nlady-in-waiting, when she and her husband go out yachting and shooting.”\n\n“Flora and her husband! There’s a marvellous sound! Where are they?”\n\n“They are staying at Eccleswood Castle,” said Ethel; “and Mary with\nthem. They would have been at home to receive you, but your note\nyesterday took us all by surprise. Norman is away too, at a college\nmeeting.”\n\n“And Margaret--my Margaret! Does not she come downstairs?”\n\n“Ah! poor dear,” said Dr. May, “she has not been in this room since that\nsultry day in July.”\n\n“The eighteenth,” said Richard; the precision of the date marking but\ntoo well the consciousness that it was an epoch.\n\n“We can keep her quieter upstairs,” said Dr. May; “but you must not see\nher to-night. She will enjoy you very much to-morrow; but excitement at\nnight always does her harm, so we put her to bed, and told her to think\nabout no one.”\n\nMrs. Arnott looked at him as if longing, but dreading, to ask further,\nand allowed her nephew and niece to seat her at the table, and attend to\nher wants, before she spoke again. “Then the babies.”\n\n“We don’t keep babies, Gertrude would tell you,” said Dr. May. “There\nare three great creatures, whom Ethel barbarously ordered off to bed.\nEthel is master here, you must know, Flora--we all mind what she says.”\n\n“Oh, papa,” pleaded Ethel, distressed, “you know it was because I\nthought numbers might be oppressive.”\n\n“I never dispute,” said Dr. May. “We bow to a beneficial despotism, and\nnever rebel, do we, Meta?”\n\nSeeing that Ethel took the imputation to heart, Meta rejoined, “You are\nmaking Mrs. Arnott think her the strong-minded woman of the family, who\nwinds up the clock and cuts the bread.”\n\n“No; that she makes you do, when the boys are away.”\n\n“Of course,” said Ethel, “I can’t be vituperated about hunches of bread.\nI have quite enough to bear on the score of tea.”\n\n“Your tea is very good,” said Richard.\n\n“See how they propitiate her,” maliciously observed the doctor.\n\n“Not at all; it is Richard standing up for his pupil,” said Ethel. “It\nis all very well now, with people who know the capacities of mortal tea;\nbut the boys expect it to last from seven o’clock to ten, through an\nunlimited number of cups, till I have announced that a teapot must\nbe carved on my tombstone, with an epitaph, ‘Died of unreasonable\nrequirements.’”\n\nMrs. Arnott looked from one to the other, amused, observant, and\nperceiving that they were all under that form of shyness which brings up\nfamily wit to hide embarrassment or emotion.\n\n“Is Harry one of these unreasonable boys?” she asked. “My dear Harry--I\npresume Ethel has not sent him to bed. Is there any hope of my seeing\nhim?”\n\n“Great hope,” said Dr. May. “He has been in the Baltic fleet, a pretty\nlittle summer trip, from which we expect him to return any day. My old\nLion! I am glad you had him for a little while, Flora.\n\n“Dear fellow! his only fault was being homesick, and making me catch the\ninfection.”\n\n“I am glad you did not put off your coming,” said Dr. May gravely.\n\n“You are in time for the consecration,” said Richard.\n\n“Ah! Cocksmoor! When will it take place?”\n\n“On St. Andrew’s Day. It is St. Andrew’s Church, and the bishop\nfixed the day, otherwise it is a disappointment that Hector cannot be\npresent.”\n\n“Hector?”\n\n“Hector Ernescliffe--poor Alan’s brother, whom we don’t well know from\nourselves.”\n\n“And you are curate, Ritchie?” said his aunt--“if I may still call you\nso. You are not a bit altered from the mouse you used to be.”\n\n“Church mouse to Cocksmoor,” said Dr. May, “nearly as poor. We are to\ninvest his patrimony in a parsonage as soon as our architect in ordinary\ncan find time for it. Spencer--you remember him?”\n\n“I remember how you and he used to be inseparable! And he has settled\ndown, at last, by your side?”\n\n“The two old doctors hope to bolster each other up till Mr. Tom\ncomes down with modern science in full force. That boy will do great\nthings--he has as clear a head as I ever knew.”\n\n“And more--” said Ethel.\n\n“Ay, as sound a heart. I must find you his tutor’s letter, Flora. They\nhave had a row in his tutor’s house at Eton, and our boys made a gallant\nstand for the right, Tom especially, guarding the little fellows in a\nway that does one good to hear of.”\n\n“‘I must express my strong sense of gratitude for his truth,\nuprightness, and moral courage,’” quoted Meta.\n\n“Ah, ha! you have learned it by heart! I know you copied it out for\nNorman, who has the best right to rejoice.”\n\n“You have a set of children to be proud of, Richard!” exclaimed Mrs.\nArnott.\n\n“To be surprised at--to be thankful for,” said Dr. May, almost\ninarticulately.\n\nTo see her father so happy with Mrs. Arnott necessarily drew Ethel’s\nheart towards her; and, when they had bidden him goodnight, the aunt\ninstantly assumed a caressing confidence towards Ethel, particularly\ncomfortable to one consciously backward and awkward, and making her feel\nas intimate as if the whole space of her rational life had not elapsed\nsince their last meeting.\n\n“Must you go, my dear?” said her aunt, detaining her over her fire.\n“I can’t tell how to spare you. I want to hear of your dear father. He\nlooks aged and thin, Ethel, and yet that sweet expression is the same as\never. Is he very anxious about poor Margaret?”\n\n“Not exactly anxious,” said Ethel mournfully--“there is not much room\nfor that.”\n\n“My dear Ethel--you don’t mean?--I thought--”\n\n“I suppose we ought to have written more fully,” said Ethel; “but it has\nbeen very gradual, and we never say it to ourselves. She is as bright,\nand happy, and comfortable as ever, in general, and, perhaps, may be so\nfor a long time yet, but each attack weakens her.”\n\n“What kind of attack?”\n\n“Faintness-sinking. It is suspended action of the heart. The injury\nto the spine deranged the system, and then the long suspense, and the\nshock--It is not one thing more than another, but it must go on. Dr.\nSpencer will tell you. You won’t ask papa too much about it?”\n\n“No, indeed. And he bears it--”\n\n“He bears everything. Strength comes up out of his great lovingness.\nBut, oh! I sometimes long that he may never have any more sorrows.”\n\n“My poor child!” said Mrs. Arnott, putting her arm round her niece’s\nwaist.\n\nEthel rested her head on her shoulder. “Aunt Flora! Aunt Flora! If any\nwords could tell what Margaret has been ever since we were left. Oh,\ndon’t make me talk or think of ourselves without her. It is wrong to\nwish. And when you see her, that dear face of hers will make you happy\nin the present. Then,” added Ethel, not able to leave off with such a\nsubject, “you have our Norman to see.”\n\n“Ah! Norman’s project is too delightful to us; but I fear what it may be\nto your father.”\n\n“He gives dear Norman, as his most precious gift, the flower and pride\nof us all.”\n\n“But, Ethel, I am quite frightened at Miss Rivers’s looks. Is it\npossible that--”\n\n“Aunt Flora,” broke in Ethel, “don’t say a word against it. The choicest\ngoods wear the best; and whatever woman can do, Meta Rivers can. Norman\nis a great tall fellow, as clever as possible, but perfectly feckless.\nIf you had him there alone, he would be a bee without a queen.”\n\n“Well, but--”\n\n“Listen,” continued Ethel. “Meta is a concentration of spirit and\nenergy, delights in practical matters, is twice the housewife I am, and\ndoes all like an accomplishment. Between them, they will make a noble\nmissionary--”\n\n“But she looks--”\n\n“Hush,” continued the niece. “You will think me domineering; but please\ndon’t give any judgment without seeing; for they look to you as an\narbitrator, and casual words will weigh.”\n\n“Thank you, Ethel; perhaps you are right. When does he think of coming\nout?”\n\n“When he is ordained--some time next year.”\n\n“Does she live with you?”\n\n“I suppose she lives with Flora; but we always manage to get her when\nNorman is at home.”\n\n“You have told me nothing of Flora or Mary.”\n\n“I have little real to tell. Good old Mary! I dare say Harry talked\nto you plentifully of her. She is a--a nice old darling,” said Ethel\nfondly. “We want her again very much, and did not quite bargain for the\nsuccession of smart visits that she has been paying.”\n\n“With Flora?”\n\n“Yes. Unluckily George Rivers has taken an aversion to the Grange, and I\nhave not seen Flora this whole year.”\n\nEthel stopped short, and said that she must not keep Margaret expecting\nher. Perhaps her aunt guessed that she had touched the true chord of\nanxiety.\n\nThe morning brought a cheering account of Margaret; and Mrs. Arnott was\nto see her directly after breakfast. In the meantime, the firm limbs,\nblue eyes, and rosy face of Gertrude seemed a fair representation of the\nlittle bride’s-maid, whom she remembered.\n\nA very different niece did she find upstairs, though the smiling,\noverflowing eyes, and the fond, eager look of recognition, as if\nasking to be taken to her bosom, had in them all the familiarity of old\ntenderness. “Auntie! dear auntie! that you should have come back to me\nagain!”\n\nMrs. Arnott fondly caressed her, but could not speak at first, for\neven her conversation with Ethel had not prepared her for so wasted and\nbroken an appearance. Dr. May spoke briskly of Margaret’s having behaved\nvery well and slept like a good child, told Margaret where he had to\ngo that morning, and pointed out to Mrs. Arnott some relics of herself\nstill remaining; but the nervous tremulousness of manner did not much\ncomfort her, although Margaret answered cheerfully. Nothing was so\neffectual in composing the aunt as Aubrey’s coming headlong in to\nannounce the gig, and to explain to Margaret his last design for a\ncathedral--drawing plans being just now his favourite sport.\n\n“Architecture is all our rage at present,” said Margaret, as her father\nhurried away.\n\n“I am so glad to have come in time for the consecration!” said Mrs.\nArnott, following her niece’s lead. “Is that a model of the church?”\n\n“Oh, yes!” cried Margaret, lighting up. “Richard made it for me.”\n\n“May I show it to Aunt Flora?” said Aubrey.\n\n“Bring it here, if you can lift it,” said Margaret; and, Aunt Flora\nhelping, the great cumbersome thing was placed beside her, whilst she\nsmiled and welcomed it like a child, and began an eager exhibition. Was\nit not a beautiful little pierced spire?--that was an extravagance of\nDr. Spencer’s own. Papa said he could not ask Captain Gordon to sanction\nit--the model did it no justice, but it was so very beautiful in the\nrich creamy stone rising up on the moor, and the blue sky looking\nthrough, and it caught the sunset lights so beautifully. So animated was\nher description, that Mrs. Arnott could not help asking, “Why, my dear,\nwhen have you seen it?”\n\n“Never,” said Margaret, with her sweet smile. “I have never seen\nCocksmoor; but Dr. Spencer and Meta are always sketching it for me, and\nEthel would not let an effect pass without telling me. I shall hear how\nit strikes you next.”\n\n“I hope to see it by and by. What a comfortable deep porch! If we could\nbuild such churches in the colonies, Margaret!”\n\n“See what little Meta will do for you! Yes, we had the porch deep for a\nshelter--that is copied from the west door of the minster, and is it\nnot a fine high-pitched roof? John Taylor, who is to be clerk, could not\nunderstand its being open; he said, when he saw the timbers, that a man\nand his family might live up among them. They are noble oak beams; we\nwould not have any sham--here, Aubrey, take off the roof, and auntie\nwill see the shape.”\n\n“Like the ribs of a ship,” explained Aubrey, unconscious that the\nmeaning was deeper than his sister could express, and he continued:\n“Such fine oak beams! I rode with Dr. Spencer one day last year to\nchoose them. It is a two-aisled church, you see, that a third may be\nadded.”\n\nEthel came up as Aubrey began to absorb the conversation. “Lessons,\nAubrey,” she said. “So, Margaret, you are over your dear model?”\n\n“Not forestalling you too much I hope, Ethel dear,” said Margaret; “as\nyou will show her the church itself.”\n\n“You have the best right,” said Ethel; “but come, Aubrey, we must not\ndawdle.”\n\n“I will show you the stones I laid myself, Aunt Flora,” said Aubrey,\nrunning off without much reluctance.\n\n“Ethel has him in excellent order,” said Mrs. Arnott.\n\n“That she has; she brings him on beautifully, and makes him enjoy it.\nShe teaches him arithmetic in some wonderful scientific way that nobody\ncan understand but Norman, and he not the details; but he says it is all\ncoming right, and will make him a capital mathematical scholar, though\nhe cannot add up pounds, shillings, and pence.”\n\n“I expected to be struck with Ethel,” said Mrs. Arnott; “and--”\n\n“Well,” said Margaret, waiting.\n\n“Yes, she does exceed my expectations. There is something curiously\nwinning in that quaint, quick, decisive manner of hers. There is so much\nsoul in the least thing she does, as if she could not be indifferent for\na moment.”\n\n“Exactly--exactly so,” said Margaret, delighted. “It is really doing\neverything with all her might. Little, simple, everyday matters did not\ncome naturally to her as to other people, and the having had to make\nthem duties has taught her to do them with that earnest manner, as\nif there were a right and a wrong to her in each little mechanical\nhousehold office.”\n\n“Harry described her to me thus,” said Mrs. Arnott, smiling: “‘As to\nEthel, she is an odd fish; but Cocksmoor will make a woman of her after\nall.’”\n\n“Quite true!” cried Margaret. “I should not have thought Harry had so\nmuch discernment in those days. Cocksmoor gave the stimulus, and made\nEthel what she is. Look there--over the mantelpiece, are the designs for\nthe painted glass, all gifts, except the east window. That one of St.\nAndrew introducing the lad with the loaves and fishes is Ethel’s window.\nIt is the produce of the hoard she began this time seven years, when\nshe had but one sovereign in the world. She kept steadily on with it,\nspending nothing on herself that she could avoid, always intending it\nfor the church, and it was just enough to pay for this window.”\n\n“Most suitable,” said Mrs. Arnott.\n\n“Yes; Mr. Wilmot and I persuaded her into it; but I do not think she\nwould have allowed it, if she had seen the application we made of\nit--the gift of her girlhood blessed and extended. Dear King Etheldred,\nit is the only time I ever cheated her.”\n\n“This is a beautiful east window. And this little one--St. Margaret I\nsee.”\n\n“Ah! papa would not be denied choosing that for his subject. We\nreproached him with legendary saints, and overwhelmed him with\nantiquarianism, to show that the Margaret of the dragon was not the\nMargaret of the daisy; but he would have it; and said we might thank him\nfor not setting his heart on St. Etheldreda.”\n\n“This one?”\n\n“That is mine,” said Margaret, very low; and her aunt abstained from\nremark, though unable to look, without tears, at the ship of the\nApostles, the calming of the storm, and the scroll, with the verse:\n\n\n         He bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.\n\n\nBeneath were the initials, “A. H. E.,” and the date of the year, the\nonly memorials of the founder.\n\nMargaret next drew attention to St. Andrew with his cross--Meta’s gift.\n“And, besides,” she said, “George Rivers made us a beautiful present,\nwhich Meta hunted up. Old Mr. Rivers, knowing no better, once bought all\nthe beautiful carved fittings of a chapel in France, meaning to fit up\na library with them; but, happily, he never did, and a happy notion came\ninto Meta’s head, so she found them out, and Dr. Spencer has adapted\nthem, and set them all to rights; and they are most exquisite. You never\nsaw such foliage.”\n\nThus Margaret proceeded with the description of everything in the\nchurch, and all the little adventures of the building, as if she could\nnot turn away from the subject; and her aunt listened and wondered, and,\nwhen called away, that Margaret might rest before nurse came to dress\nher, she expressed her wonder to Meta.\n\n“Yes,” was the answer; “it is her chief occupation and interest. I do\nnot mean that she has not always her own dear full sympathy for every\none’s concerns, but Cocksmoor is her concern, almost more than even\nEthel’s. I think she could chronicle every stage in the building better\nthan Dr. Spencer himself, and it is her daily delight to hear his\nhistories of his progress. And not only with the church but the people;\nshe knows all about every family; Richard and Ethel tell her all their\nnews; she talks over the school with the mistress every Sunday, and\nyou cannot think what a feeling there is for her at Cocksmoor. A kind\nmessage from Miss May has an effect that the active workers cannot\nalways produce.”\n\nMrs. Arnott saw that Meta was right, when, in the afternoon, she walked\nwith her nieces to see Cocksmoor. It was not a desolate sight as in\nold times, for the fair edifice, rising on the slope, gave an air of\nprotection to the cottages, which seemed now to have a centre of unity,\ninstead of lying forlorn and scattered. Nor were they as wretched in\nthemselves, for the impulse of civilisation had caused windows to be\nmended and railings to be tidied, and Richard promoted, to the utmost,\ncottage gardening, so that, though there was an air of poverty, there\nwas no longer an appearance of reckless destitution and hopeless\nneglect.\n\nIn the cottages, Mrs. Taylor had not entirely ceased to speak with a\npiteous voice, even though she told of the well-doing of her girls at\nservice; but Granny Hall’s merry content had in it something now of\nprinciple, and Sam had married a young Fordholm wife, who promised to\nbe a pattern for Cocksmoor. Every one asked after Miss May, with a\ntenderness and affection that Mrs. Arnott well appreciated; and when\nthey went into the large fresh school, where Richard was hearing a\nclass, Cherry Elwood looked quite cheered and enlivened by hearing\nthat she had been able to enjoy seeing her aunt. Mrs. Arnott was set to\nenlighten the children about the little brown girls whom she was wont\nto teach, and came away with a more brilliant impression of their\nintelligence than she might have had, if she had not come to them fresh\nfrom the Antipodes.\n\nShe had to tell Margaret all her impressions on her return, and very\npretty smiles repaid her commendations. She understood better the\nconstant dwelling on the subject, as she perceived how little capable\nMargaret was of any employment. The book, the writing materials, and\nwork-basket were indeed placed by her side, but very seldom did the\nfeeble fingers engage in any of the occupations once so familiar--now\nand then a pencilled note would be sent to Flora, or to Hector\nErnescliffe, or a few stitches be set in her work, or a page or two\nturned of a book, but she was far more often perfectly still, living,\nassuredly in no ordinary sphere of human life, but never otherwise than\ncheerful, and open to the various tidings and interests which, as Ethel\nhad formerly said, shifted before her like scenes in a magic lantern,\nand, perhaps, with less of substance than in those earlier days, when\nher work among them was not yet done, and she was not, as it were, set\naside from them. They were now little more than shadows reflected from\nthe world whence she was passing.\n\nYet her home was not sad. When Dr. Spencer came in the evening, and\nold Edinburgh stories were discussed, Dr. May talked with spirit, and\nlaughed with the merry note that Mrs. Amott so well remembered, and Meta\nRivers chimed in with her gay, saucy repartees, nor, though Richard was\nalways silent, and Ethel’s brow seemed to bear a weight of thought, did\nit seem as if their spirits were depressed; while there was certainly no\nrestraint on the glee of Blanche, Aubrey, and Gertrude, who were running\ninto Margaret’s room, and making as much noise there as they chose.\n\nMrs. Arnott was at home with the whole family from the first, and in\nevery one’s confidence; but what she enjoyed above all was, the\nsitting in Margaret’s room in the morning, when there was no danger\nof interruption, the three children being all safe captives to their\nlessons, and Meta, in Richard’s workshop, illuminating texts on zinc\nscrolls for the church.\n\nMargaret came out more in these interviews. It had been a kind of\nshyness that made her talk so exclusively of the church at the first\nmeeting; she had now felt her way, and knew again--and realised--the\nsame kind aunt with whom she had parted in her childhood, and now far\ndearer, since she herself was better able to appreciate her, and with\na certain resemblance to her mother, that was unspeakably precious and\nsoothing to one deprived, as Margaret had been, at the commencement of\nher illness and anxiety.\n\nShe could hardly see her aunt come near her, without thanking her for\nhaving come home, and saying how every time she awoke it was with the\nsense that something was comfortable, then remembering it was Aunt\nFlora’s being in the house. She seemed to have a feeling, as if telling\neverything to her aunt were like rendering up her account to her mother,\nand, at different times, she related the whole, looking back on the\nvarious decisions she had had to make or to influence, and reviewing\nher own judgments, though often with self-blame, not with acuteness\nof distress, but rather with a humble trust in the Infinite Mercy that\nwould atone for all shortcomings and infirmities, truly sorrowed for.\n\nOn the whole it was a peaceful and grateful retrospect; the brothers all\ndoing so well in their several ways, and such a comfort to their father.\nTom, concerning whom she had made the greatest mistake, might be looked\nupon as rescued by Norman. Aubrey, Margaret said, smiling, was Ethel’s\nchild, and had long been off her mind; Hector, to her quite a brother,\nwould miss her almost more than her own brothers, but good honest\nfellow, he had a home here; and, whispered Margaret, smiling and glowing\na little, “don’t tell any one, for it is a secret of secrets. Hector\ntold me one evening that, if he could be very steady, he hoped he might\nyet have Blanche at Maplewood. Poor little White Mayflower, it won’t\nbe for want of liking on her part, and she so blushes and watches\nwhen Hector comes near, that I sometimes think that he might have said\nsomething like it to her.”\n\nMrs. Arnott gave no opinion on the plan for Norman and Meta; but\nMargaret, however, took all for granted, and expressed warm hopes for\ntheir sakes, that they would go out with Mrs. Arnott; then, when the\nsuggestion seemed to astonish her aunt, who thought they were waiting\nfor his ordination, she said, “The fact is, that he would like to be\nordained where he is to work; but I believe they do not like to say\nanything about the wedding because of me. Now, of all persons, I must\nchiefly rejoice in what may help to teach in those islands. I cannot\nbear to be a hindrance. Whatever happens, Aunt Flora, will you take care\nthat they know this?”\n\nAs to her father, Margaret was at rest. He had much more calmness than\nwhen he was more new to grief, and could bear far more patiently and\nhopefully than at first. He lived more on his affections above, and\nmuch as he loved those below, he did not rest in them as once, and could\nbetter afford to have been removed. “Besides,” said Margaret serenely,\n“it has been good for him to have been gradually weaned from depending\non me, so that it is Ethel who is really necessary to him.”\n\nFor herself, Margaret was perfectly content and happy. She knew the\ntemptation of her character had been to be the ruler and manager of\neverything, and she saw it had been well for her to have been thus\nassigned the part of Mary rather than of Martha. She remembered with\nthankful joy the engagement with Alan Ernescliffe, and though she still\nwore tokens of mourning for him, it was with a kind of pleasure in them.\nThere had been so little promise of happiness from the first, that there\nwas far more peace in thinking of him as sinking into rest in Harry’s\narms, than as returning to grieve over her decline; and that last gift\nof his, the church, had afforded her continual delight, and above all\nother earthly pursuits, smoothed away the languor and weariness of\ndisease, as she slowly sank to join him. Now that her aunt had come to\nbring back a sunbeam of her childhood, Margaret declared that she had no\nmore grief or care, except one, and that a very deep and sad one--namely\npoor Flora.\n\nMrs. Arnott had at first been inclined to fear that her goddaughter was\nneglecting her own family, since she had not been at home this whole\nyear, but the slightest betrayal of this suspicion roused Margaret to\nan eager defence. She had not a doubt that Flora would gladly have been\nwith her, but she believed that she was not acting by her own choice,\nor more truly, that her husband was so devoted to her, that she felt the\nmore bound to follow his slightest wishes, however contrary to her own.\nThe season had been spent in the same whirl that had, last year,\nbeen almost beyond human power, even when stimulated by enjoyment\nand success; and now, when her spirits were lowered, and her health\nweakened, Meta had watched and trembled for her, though never able\nto obtain an avowal that it was an overstrain, and while treated most\naffectionately, never admitted within her barrier of reserve.\n\n“If I could see poor Flora comforted, or if even she would only let me\nenter into her troubles,” Margaret said, sighing, “I should be content.”\n\nThe consecration day came near, and the travellers began to return. Meta\nwas in a state of restlessness, which in her was very pretty, under the\ndisguise of a great desire to be useful. She fluttered about the house,\nvisited Margaret, played with Gertrude, set the drawing-room ornaments\nto rights--a task which Ethel was very glad to depute to her, and made\na great many expeditions into the garden to put together autumn nosegays\nfor the vases--finally discovering that Ethel’s potichomanie vases on\nthe staircase window must have some red and brown leaves.\n\nShe did not come back quite so soon with them, and Mrs. Arnott, slyly\nlooking out of window, reported, “Ha! he is come then! At least, I see\nthe little thing has found--”\n\n“Something extremely unlike itself,” said Dr. May, laughing. “Something\nI could easily set down as a student at Edinburgh; thirty years ago.\nThat’s the very smile! I remember dear Maggie being more angry than I\never saw her before, because Mr. Fleet said that you smiled to show your\nwhite teeth.”\n\n“That is the best shadow of Maggie I ever saw,” said Dr. May. “She has\ntaught the lad to smile. That is what I call a pretty sight!”\n\n“Come, Richard, it is a shame for old folks like us to stand spying\nthem!”\n\n“They care very little for me,” said Dr. May, “but I shall have them\nin. Cold winds blowing about that little head! Ah! here they are. Fine\nleaves you gather, miss! Very red and brown.”\n\nMeta rather liked, than otherwise, those pretty teasings of Dr. May,\nbut they always made Norman colour extremely, and he parried them by\nannouncing news. “No, not the Bucephalus, a marriage in high life, a\nrelation.”\n\n“Not poor Mary!” cried Ethel.\n\n“Mary! what could make you think of her?”\n\n“As a hen thinks of her ducklings when they go into waters beyond her\nken,” said Ethel. “Well, as long as it is not Mary, I don’t care!”\n\n“High life!” repeated Meta. “Oh, it can be only Agatha Langdale.”\n\n“There’s only Lord Cosham further to guess,” said Ethel.\n\n“Eh! why not young Ogilvie?” said Dr. May. “I am right, I see. Well, who\nis the lady?”\n\n“A Miss Dunbar--a nice girl that I met at Glenbracken. Her property fits\nin with theirs, and I believe his father has been wishing it for a long\ntime.”\n\n“It does not sound too romantic,” said Meta.\n\n“He writes as if he had the sense of having been extremely dutiful,”\n said Norman.\n\n“No doubt thinking it needful in addressing a namesake, who has had an\neye to the main chance,” said the doctor. “Don’t throw stones, young\npeople.”\n\n“Well!” exclaimed Meta; “he did not look as if he would go and do such a\nstupid thing as that!”\n\n“Probably, it is anything but a stupid thing,” said Dr. May.\n\n“You are using him very ill among you,” said Norman eagerly. “I believe\nher to be excellent in every way; he has known her from childhood;\nhe writes as if he were perfectly contented, and saw every chance of\nhappiness.”\n\n“None the less for having followed his father’s wishes--I am glad he\ndid,” said Ethel, coming to her brother’s side.\n\n“I dare say you are right,” was Meta’s answer; “but I am disappointed in\nhim. He always promised to come and stay with you, and made such friends\nat Oxford, and he never came.”\n\n“I fancy there was a good deal to hinder him,” said Norman; and, as Mrs.\nArnott proceeded to inquiries after the Ogilvies in general, the master\nof Glenbracken was allowed to drop.\n\nMeta, however, renewed the subject when walking to the minster that\nevening with Norman.\n\n“You may defend Mr. Ogilvie, Norman, but it is not what I should have\nexpected from him. Why did he make promises, and then neglect his\nrelations?”\n\n“I believe that conscientiously he did not dare to come,” said Norman.\n“I know that he was greatly struck with Ethel at the time of the\nCommemoration, and therefore I could never again press him to come\nhere.”\n\n“Oh, Norman, you hard-hearted monster! What a bad conductor!”\n\n“I do not wish to be a conductor,” said Norman. “If you had seen\nGlenbracken and the old people, you would perceive that it would not\nhave been suitable on our part to promote anything of the kind.”\n\n“Would they have been so violent?”\n\n“Not violent, but it would have been a severe struggle. They are good,\nkind people, but with strong prejudices; and, though I have no doubt\nthey would have yielded to steady attachment on their son’s part,\nand such conduct as Ethel’s would have been, I could not lead in that\ndirection.”\n\n“Is that pride, Norman?”\n\n“I hope not.”\n\n“It is doing by others as you were doing by yourself,” half whispered\nMeta; “but, after all, if he had no constancy, Ethel had an escape.”\n\n“I was afraid that she had been rather touched, but I am glad to find\nmyself mistaken.”\n\n“If you thought so, how could you make such a public announcement?”\n\nHe laughed. “I had made myself so nervous as to the effect, that,\nin desperation, I took her own way, and came out at once with it as\nunconsciously as I could.”\n\n“Very naturally you acted unconsciousness! It was better than insulting\nher by seeming to condole. Not that I do, though, for she deserves more\nsteadiness than he has shown! If a man could appreciate her at all, I\nshould have thought that it would have been once and for ever.”\n\n“Remember, he had barely known her a fortnight, and probably had no\nreason to believe that he had made any impression on her. He knew how\nsuch an attachment would grieve his parents, and, surely, he was acting\ndutifully, and with self-denial and consideration, in not putting\nhimself in the way of being further attracted.”\n\n“Umph! You make a good defence, Norman, but I cannot forgive him for\nmarrying somebody else, who cannot be Ethel’s equal.”\n\n“She is a good little girl; he will form her, and be very happy; perhaps\nmore so than with a great soul and strong nature like Ethel’s.”\n\n“Only he is a canny Scot, and not a Dr. Spencer!”\n\n“Too short acquaintance! besides, there were the parents. Moreover, what\nwould become of home without Ethel?”\n\n“The unanswerable argument to make one contented,” said Meta. “And,\ncertainly, to be wife to a Member of Parliament is not so very\ndelightful that one would covet it for her.”\n\n“Any more than she does for herself.”\n\nNorman was right in his view of his friend’s motives, as well as of\nEthel’s present feelings. If there had ever been any disappointment\nabout Norman Ogilvie, it had long since faded away. She had never given\naway the depths of her heart, though the upper surface had been stirred.\nAll had long subsided, and she could think freely of him as an\nagreeable cousin, in whose brilliant public career she should always be\ninterested, without either a wish to partake it, or a sense of injury\nor neglect. She had her vocation, in her father, Margaret, the children,\nhome, and Cocksmoor; her mind and affections were occupied, and she\nnever thought of wishing herself elsewhere.\n\nThe new church and the expected return of her sisters engrossed many\nmore of her thoughts than did anything relating to Glenbracken.\n\nShe could not bear to talk of Flora, though almost as uneasy as was\nMargaret; and not able to lay aside misgivings, lest even her good\nsimple Mary might have had her head turned by gaiety.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Rivers arrived on the Saturday before the Tuesday fixed\nfor the consecration, and stopped on their way, that they might see\nMargaret, deposit Mary, and resume Meta.\n\nIt was a short visit, and all that Ethel could discover was, that Flora\nwas looking very ill, no longer able to conceal the worn and fagged\nexpression of her countenance, and evidently dreadfully shocked by the\nsight of the havoc made by disease on Margaret’s frame. Yet she talked\nwith composure of indifferent subjects--the yacht, the visits, the\nBucephalus, the church, and the arrangements for St. Andrew’s Day. She\nowned herself overworked, and in need of rest, and, as she was not well\nenough to venture on being present at the consecration, she undertook\nto spend the day with Margaret, thus setting the others at liberty. This\nsettled, she took her leave, for the journey had fatigued her greatly.\n\nDuring the short visit, Mary had moved and spoken so quietly, and looked\nso well-dressed and young-lady-like, that, in spite of her comfortable\nplump cheeks, Ethel felt quite afraid!\n\nBut the instant the carriage had driven off, there was a skipping, a\nhugging, a screaming, “Oh, it is so nice to be at home again!”--and\nEthel knew she had her own Mary. It was only a much better looking\nand more mannerly Mary, in the full bloom of seventeen, open and\nhonest-faced, her profuse light hair prettily disposed, her hands and\narms more civilised, and her powers of conversation and self-possession\ndeveloped. Mary-like were her caresses of Gertrude, Mary-like her\ninquiries for Cocksmoor, Mary-like her insisting on bringing her boxes\ninto Margaret’s room, her exulting exhibition of all the pretty things\nthat Flora and George had given to her, and the still more joyous\nbestowal of presents upon everybody.\n\nHer tastes were not a whit altered, nor her simplicity diminished. If\nshe was pleased by joining a large dinner-party, her satisfaction was\nin the amusement of seeing well-dressed people, and a grand table; her\nknowledge of the world only reached to pronouncing everything unlike\nhome, “so funny;” she had relished most freshly and innocently every\npleasure that she could understand, she had learned every variety of\nfancy work to teach Blanche and Miss Bracy, had been the delight\nof every schoolroom and nursery, had struck up numberless eternal\nfriendships, and correspondences with girls younger and shyer than\nherself, and her chief vexations seemed to have been first, that Flora\ninsisted on her being called Miss May, secondly, that all her delights\ncould not be shared by every one at home, and thirdly, that poor Flora\ncould not bear to look at little children.\n\nGrievous complaints were preferred by the dwellers in the attics the\nnext morning, that Mary and Blanche had talked to an unmentionable hour\nof the night; but, on the whole, Blanche was rather doubtful whether\nMary had made the most of her opportunities of observation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\n\n     Behold, with pearls they glittering stand,\n     Thy peaceful gates to all expand,\n     By grace and strength divinely shed,\n     Each mortal thither may be led;\n     Who, kindled by Christ’s love, will dare\n     All earthly sufferings now to bear.\n\n     By many a salutary stroke,\n     By many a weary blow, that broke,\n     Or polished, with a workman’s skill,\n     The stones that form that glorious pile;\n     They all are fitly framed to lie\n     In their appointed place on high.\n             Ancient Hymn for the Dedication of a Church.\n\n\nThe thirtieth of November dawned with the grave brightness of an autumn\nday, as the sun slowly mounted from the golden east, drinking up the\nmists that rose tardily, leaving the grass thickly bedewed.\n\nThe bells of Stoneborough Minster were ringing gladsome peals, and the\nsunshine had newly touched the lime trees, whose last bright yellow\nleaves were gently floating down, as the carriage, from the Grange, drew\nup at Dr. May’s door.\n\nNorman opened it, to claim Meta at once for the walk; Mrs. Arnott and\nMary had gone on to assist Richard in his final arrangements, but even\nbefore Cocksmoor, with Ethel, was now the care of Margaret; and she had\nwaited with her father to keep all bustle from her room, and to commit\nher into the charge of Flora and of nurse. Ethel seemed quite unwilling\nto go. There was that strange oppressed feeling on her as if the\nattainment of her wishes were joy too great to be real--as if she would\nfain hold off from it at the climax, and linger with the sister who\nhad shared all with her, and to whom that church was even more than\nto herself. She came back, and back again, with fresh injunctions,\nsometimes forgetting the very purpose of her return, as if it had been\nonly an excuse for looking at Margaret’s countenance, and drinking in\nher sympathy from her face; but she was to go in George’s carriage,\nand he was not a man to allow of loitering. He became so impatient of\nEthel’s delays, that she perceived that he could bear them no longer,\ngave her final kiss, and whispered, “In spirit with us!” then ran down\nand was seized on by George, who had already packed in the children and\nMiss Bracy, and was whirled away.\n\n“Flora dear,” said Margaret, “do you dislike having the window opened?”\n\nFlora threw it up, protesting, in reply to her sister’s scruples, that\nshe liked the air. “You always spoiled me,” said Margaret fondly. “Come\nand lie down by me. It is very nice to have you here,” she added, as\nFlora complied; and she took her hand and fondled it, “It is like the\nold times to have you here taking care of me.”\n\n“Very unlike them in some ways,” said Flora.\n\n“It has been a great renewal of still older times,” said Margaret, “to\nhave Aunt Flora here. I hope you will get to know her, Flora, it is\nso like having mamma here,” and she looked in her sister’s face as she\nspoke.\n\nFlora did not reply, but she lay quite still, as if there were a charm\nin the perfect rest of being alone with Margaret, making no effort, and\nbeing able to be silent. Time passed on, how long they knew not, but,\nsuddenly, a thrill shot through Margaret’s frame; she raised her hand\nand lifted her head, with an eager “Hark!”\n\nFlora could hear nothing.\n\n“The bells--his bells!” said Margaret, all one radiant look of\nlistening, as Flora opened the window further, and the breeze wafted in\nthe chime, softened by distance. The carnation tinted those thin white\ncheeks, eyes and smile beamed with joy, and uplifted finger and parted\nlips seemed marking every note of the cadence.\n\nIt ceased. “Alan! Alan!” said she. “It is enough! I am ready!”\n\nThe somewhat alarmed look on Flora’s face recalled her, and, smiling,\nshe held out her hands for the consecration books, saying, “Let us\nfollow the service. It will be best for us both.”\n\nSlowly, softly, and rather monotonously, Flora read on, till she had\ncome more than half through the first lesson. Her voice grew husky, and\nshe sometimes paused as if she could not easily proceed. Margaret begged\nher to stop, but she would not cease, and went on reading, though almost\nwhispering, till she came to, “If they return to Thee with all their\nheart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither\nthey have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which Thou\ngavest unto their fathers, and toward the City which Thou hast chosen,\nand toward the House which I have built for Thy Name; then hearing from\nthe Heavens, even from Thy dwelling-place--”\n\nFlora could go no further; she strove, but one of her tearless sobs\ncut her short. She turned her face aside, and, as Margaret began to say\nsomething tender, she exclaimed, with low, hasty utterance, “Margaret!\nMargaret! pray for me, for it is a hard captivity, and my heart is very,\nvery sore. Oh! pray for me, that it may all be forgiven me--and that I\nmay see my child again!”\n\n“My Flora; my own poor, dear Flora! do I not pray? Oh! look up, look up.\nThink how He loves you. If I love you so much, how much more does not\nHe? Come near me, Flora. Be patient, and I know peace will come!”\n\nThe words had burst from Flora uncontrollably. She was aware, the next\ninstant, that she had given way to harmful agitation, and, resuming her\nquiescence, partly by her own will, partly from the soothing effect of\nMargaret’s words and tone, she allowed herself to be drawn close to\nher sister, and hid her face in the pillow, while Margaret’s hands were\nfolded over her, and words of blessing and prayer were whispered with a\nfervency that made them broken.\n\nEthel, meanwhile, stood between Aubrey and Gertrude, hardly able to\nbelieve it was not a dream, as she beheld the procession enter the\naisle, and heard the psalm that called on those doors to lift up\ntheir heads for Him who should enter. There was an almost bewildered\nfeeling--could it indeed be true, as she followed the earlier part\nof the service, which set apart that building as a temple for ever,\nseparate from all common uses. She had imagined the scene so often\nthat she could almost have supposed the present, one of her many\nimaginations; but, by and by, the strangeness passed off, and she was\nable to enter into, not merely to follow, the prayers, and to feel the\ndeep thanksgiving that such had been the crown of her feeble efforts.\nMargaret was in her mind the whole time, woven, as it were, into\nevery supplication and every note of praise; and when there came the\nintercession for those in sickness and suffering, flowing into the\ncommemoration of those departed in faith and fear, Ethel’s spirit sank\nfor a moment at the conviction that soon Margaret, like him, whom all\nmust bear in mind on that day, might be included in that thanksgiving;\nyet, as the service proceeded, leaving more and more of earth behind,\nand the voices joined with angel and archangel, Ethel could lose the\npresent grief, and only retain the certainty that, come what might,\nthere was joy and union amid those who sung that hymn of praise. Never\nhad Ethel been so happy--not in the sense of the finished work--no, she\nhad lost all that, but in being more carried out of herself than ever\nshe had been before, the free spirit of praise so bearing up her heart\nthat the cry of glory came from her with such an exultant gladness, as\nmight surely be reckoned as one of those foretastes of our everlasting\nlife, not often vouchsafed even to the faithful, and usually sent to\nprepare strength for what may be in store.\n\nThe blessing brought the sense of peace, which hung on her even while\nthe sounds of movement began, and the congregation were emerging. As\nshe came out, greetings, sentences of admiration of the church, and of\ninquiry for her absent sisters, were crowded upon her, as people moved\ntowards the school, where a luncheon was provided for them, to pass away\nthe interval until evening service. The half-dozen oldest Cocksmoorites\nwere, meantime, to have a dinner in the former schoolroom, at the\nElwoods’ house, and Ethel was anxious so see that all was right there;\nso, while the rest of her party were doing civil things, she gave her\narm to Cherry, whose limping walk showed her to be very tired.\n\n“Oh, Miss Ethel!” said Cherry, “if Miss May could only have been here!”\n\n“Her heart is,” said Ethel.\n\n“Well, ma’am, I believe it is. You would not think, ma’am, how all the\nchildren take heed to anything about her. If I only begin to say ‘Miss\nMay told me--’ they are all like mice.”\n\n“She has done more for the real good of Cocksmoor than any one else,”\n said Ethel.\n\nMore might have been said, but they perceived that they were being\novertaken by the body of clergy, who had been unrobing in the vestry.\nEthel hastened to retreat within Mrs. Elwood’s wicket gate, but she was\narrested by Richard, and found herself being presented to the bishop,\nand the bishop shaking hands with her, and saying that he had much\nwished to be introduced to her.\n\nOf course, that was because she was her father’s daughter, and by way\nof something to say. She mentioned what was going on at the cottage,\nwhereupon the bishop wished to go in and see the old people; and,\nentering, they found the very comfortable-looking party just sitting\ndown to roast-beef and goose. John Taylor, in a new black coat, on\naccount of his clerkship, presiding at one end, and Mr. Elwood at the\nother, and Dame Hall finding conversation for the whole assembly; while\nBlanche, Aubrey, Gertrude, the little Larkinses, and the Abbotstoke\nWilmots were ready to act as waiters with infinite delight. Not a bit\ndaunted by the bishop, who was much entertained by her merry manner, old\ngranny told him “she had never seen nothing like it since the Jubilee,\nwhen the squire roasted an ox whole, and there wasn’t none of it fit to\neat; and when her poor father got his head broken. Well, to be sure,\nwho would have thought what would come of Sam’s bringing in the young\ngentleman and lady to see her the day her back was so bad!”\n\nThe bishop said grace, and left granny to the goose, while he gave Ethel\nhis arm, which she would have thought an unaccountable proceeding if she\nhad not recollected that Richard might be considered as host, and that\nshe was his eldest sister forthcoming.\n\n\nNo sooner, however, had they come beyond the wicket than she saw her\nfather speaking to Will Adams, and there was that in the air of both\nwhich made it no surprise when Dr. May came up, saying, “Ethel, I must\ncarry you away;” and, in explanation to the bishop, “my poor girl at\nhome is not so well.”\n\nAll was inquiry and sympathy. Ethel was frantic to be at home, and would\nhave rushed off at once, if Richard had not held her fast, asking what\ngood she would do by hurrying in, breathless and exhausted, so as to add\nto Flora’s fright and distress, the anxiety which was most upon their\nminds, since she had never before witnessed one of the seizures, that\nwere only too ordinary matters in the eyes of the home party. No one but\nDr. May and Ethel should go. Richard undertook to tell the rest, and the\ngig making its appearance, Ethel felt that the peculiarly kind manner\nwith which the bishop pressed her hand, and gave them all good wishes,\nwas like a continuation of his blessing to aid her in her home scene of\ntrial.\n\nPerhaps, it was well for her that her part in the consecration\nfestivities should end here; at least so thought Mr. Wilmot, who, though\nvery sorry for the cause, could not wish her to have been present at the\nluncheon. She had not thought of self hitherto, the church was the gift\nof Alan and Margaret, the work of preparing the people belonged to all\nalike, and she did not guess that, in the sight of others, she was not\nthe nobody that she believed herself. Her share in the work at Cocksmoor\nwas pretty well known, and Dr. Hoxton could not allow a public occasion\nto pass without speeches, such as must either have been very painful,\nor very hurtful to her. The absence of herself and her father, however,\npermitted a more free utterance to the general feeling; and things were\nsaid, that did indeed make the rest of the family extremely hot and\nuncomfortable, but which gave them extreme pleasure. Norman was obliged\nto spare Richard the answer, and said exactly what he ought, and so\nbeautifully, that Meta could not find it in her heart to echo the\nfervent wish, which he whispered as he sat down, that speechifying could\nbe abolished by Act of Parliament.\n\nMrs. Arnott began to perceive that her nephew was something to be proud\nof, and to understand how much was sacrificed, while George Rivers\nexpressed his opinion to her that Norman would be a crack speaker in the\nHouse, and he hoped she would say everything to hinder his going out,\nfor it was a regular shame to waste him on the niggers.\n\nOwing to George having constituted himself her squire, Mrs. Arnott had\nnot arrived at an understanding of the state of affairs at home; but,\nas soon as they rose up from luncheon, and she learned the truth from\nRichard and Mary, nothing would hinder her from walking home at once to\nsee whether she could be useful. Mary was easily persuaded to remain,\nfor she was accustomed to Margaret’s having these attacks, and had\nalways been kept out of her room the while, so she had little uneasiness\nto prevent her from being very happy, in receiving in her own simple,\ngood-humoured way all the attentions that lapsed upon her in the place\nof her elder sisters.\n\n“Cocksmoor really has a church!” was note enough of joy for her, and\nno one could look at her round face without seeing perfect happiness.\nMoreover, when after evening service, the November mist turned into\ndecided rain, she was as happy as a queen in her foresight, which had\nprovided what seemed an unlimited supply of cloaks and umbrellas. She\nappeared to have an original genius for making the right people give a\nlift in their carriages to the distressed; and, regarding the Abbotstoke\nbritska as her own, packed in Mrs. Anderson and Fanny, in addition\nto all their own little ones, Meta thrusting Miss Bracy into the\ndemi-corner destined for herself at the last minute, and, remaining with\nMary, the only ladies obliged to walk back to Stoneborough. So delighted\nwere they “at the fun,” that it might have been thought the most\ncharming of adventures, and they laughed all the more at the lack\nof umbrellas. They went to Mrs. Elwood’s, divested themselves of all\npossible finery, and tucked up the rest; Meta was rolled up from head to\nfoot in a great old plaid shawl of Mrs. Elwood’s, and Mary had a cloak\nof Richard’s, the one took Norman’s arm, the other Dr. Spencer’s, and\nthey trudged home through the darkness and the mud in the highest glee,\nquite sorry when the carriage met them half-way.\n\nIt was the last mirth that they enjoyed for many weeks. When they\nreached home, a sense of self-reproach for their glee thrilled over\nthem, when they found a sort of hush pervading the drawing-room, and saw\nthe faces of awe and consternation, worn by Blanche and George Rivers.\n\n“It was a much worse attack than usual, and it did not go off,” was\nall that Blanche knew, but her father had desired to be told when Dr.\nSpencer came home, and she went up with the tidings.\n\nThis brought Flora down, looking dreadfully pale, and with her voice\nsunk away as it had been when she lost her child. Her husband started\nup, exclaiming at her aspect; she let him support her to the sofa, and\ngave the few particulars. Margaret had been as placid and comfortable as\nusual, till nurse came to dress her, but the first move had brought on\nthe faintness and loss of breath. It did not yield to remedies, and\nshe had neither looked nor spoken since, only moaned. Flora thought her\nfather much alarmed; and then, after an interval, she began to entreat\nthat they might stay there, sending Miss Bracy and the children to the\nGrange to make room.\n\nMeantime, Dr. Spencer had come to the sick-room, but he could only\nsuggest remedies that were already in course of application to the\ninsensible sufferer. Mrs. Arnott and Ethel were watching, and trying\neverything to relieve her, but with little effect, and Ethel presently\nstood by the fire with her father, as Dr. Spencer turned towards him,\nand he said, in a very low, but calm voice, “It won’t do--I believe it\nis the death-stroke.”\n\n“Not immediate,” said Dr. Spencer.\n\n“No,” said Dr. May; and he quietly spoke of what the disease had\neffected, and what yet remained for it to do, ere the silver bowl should\nbe broken.\n\nDr. Spencer put in a word of agreement.\n\n“Will there be no rally?” said Ethel, in the same tone.\n\n“Probably not,” said Dr. May; “the brain is generally reached at this\nstage. I have seen it coming for a long time. The thing was done seven\nyears ago. There was a rally for a time when youth was strong; but\nsuspense and sorrow accelerated what began from the injury to the\nspine.”\n\nDr. Spencer bowed his head, and looked at him anxiously, saying, “I do\nnot think there will be much acute suffering.”\n\n“I fear it may be as trying,” said Dr. May, sighing; and then turning to\nEthel, and throwing his arm round her, “May God make it easy to her, and\ngrant us ‘patient hearts.’ We will not grudge her to all that she loves\nbest, my Ethel.”\n\nEthel clung to him, as if to derive strength from him. But the strength\nthat was in them then did not come from earth. Dr. Spencer wrung his\nhand, and stepped back to the bed to try another resource. Vain again,\nthey only seemed to be tormenting her, and the silent helplessness\nprevailed again. Then Dr. May went down to Flora, told her the true\nstate of the case, and urged on her to give up her plan of remaining.\nGeorge joined with him, and she yielded submissively, but would not be\nrefused going up once again and kissing her sister, standing beside her\ngazing at her, till her father came softly and drew her away. “I shall\nbe here to-morrow,” she said to Ethel, and went.\n\nThe morrow, however, brought no Flora. The agitation and distress of\nthat day had broken her down completely, and she was so ill as to be\nunable to move. Her aunt went at once to see her, and finding that her\npresence at the Grange relieved some of Dr. May’s anxieties, chiefly\ndevoted herself to her. Flora was grateful and gentle, but as silent\nand impenetrable as ever, while day after day she lay on her couch,\nuncomplaining and undemonstrative, visited by her father, and watched\nover by her aunt and sister-in-law, who began to know each other much\nbetter, though Flora less than ever, in that deep fixed grief. She only\nroused herself to return her husband’s affection, or to listen to the\ndaily reports of Margaret. Poor George, he was very forlorn, though Meta\ndid her best to wait on him, and he rode over twice a day to inquire at\nStoneborough.\n\nThe doctors were right, and the consecration morning was her last of\nfull consciousness. From the hour when she had heard the sound of Alan’s\nbells, her ears were closed to earthly sounds. There was very little\npower of intercourse with her, as she lingered on the borders of the\nland very far away, where skill and tenderness could not either reach\nbody or spirit. Often the watchers could not tell whether she was\nconscious, or only incapacitated from expression, by the fearful weight\non her breath, which caused a restlessness most piteous in the exhausted\nhelpless frame, wasted till the softest touch was anguish. Now and\nthen came precious gleams when a familiar voice, or some momentary\nalleviation would gain a smile, or thanks, and they thought her less\nrestless when Richard read prayers beside her, but words were very rare,\nonly now and then a name, and when in most distress, “it will be soon\nover,” “it will soon be over,” occurred so often, that they began to\nthink it once her solace, and now repeated habitually without a meaning.\n\nThey could not follow her into the valley of the shadow of death, but\ncould only watch the frail earthly prison-house being broken down, as if\nthe doom of sin must be borne, though faith could trust that it was but\nher full share in the Cross. Calmly did those days pass. Ethel, Richard,\nand Mary divided between them the watching and the household cares,\nand their father bore up bravely in the fullness of his love and faith,\nresigning her daughter to the Hands which were bearing her whither her\njoys had long since departed.\n\nHector Ernescliffe arrived when the holidays began; and his agony of\nsorrow, when she failed to recognise him, moved Dr. May to exert himself\nearnestly for his consolation; and, at the same time, Tom, in a gentle,\nalmost humble manner, paid a sort of daughter-like attention to the\nsmallest services for his father, as if already accepting him as his\nespecial charge.\n\nIt was midnight, on the longest night of the year; Ethel was lying on\nher bed, and had fallen into a brief slumber, when her father’s low,\nclear voice summoned her: “Ethel, she is going!”\n\nThere was a change on the face, and the breath came in labouring gasps.\nRichard lifted her head, and her eyes once more opened; she smiled once\nmore.\n\n“Papa!” she said, “dear papa!”\n\nHe threw himself on his knees beside her, but she looked beyond him,\n“Mamma! Alan! oh, there they are! More! more!” and, as though the\nunspeakable dawned on her, she gasped for utterance, then looked, with\na consoling smile, on her father. “Over now!” she said--and the last\nstruggle was ended. That which Richard laid down was no longer Margaret\nMay.\n\nOver now! The twenty-five years’ life, the seven years’ captivity on her\ncouch, the anxious headship of the motherless household, the hopeless\nbetrothal, the long suspense, the efforts for resignation, the widowed\naffections, the slow decay, the tardy, painful death agony--all was\nover; nothing left, save what they had rendered the undying spirit, and\nthe impress her example had left on those around her.\n\nThe long continuance of the last suffering had softened the actual\nparting; and it was with thankfulness for the cessation of her pain that\nthey turned away, and bade each other good-night.\n\nEthel would not have believed that her first wakening to the knowledge\nthat Margaret was gone could have been more fraught with relief than\nwith misery. And, for her father, it seemed as if it were a home-like,\ncomfortable thought to him, that her mother had one of her children with\nher. He called her the first link of his Daisy Chain drawn up out of\nsight; and, during the quiet days that ensued, he seemed as it were to\nbe lifted above grief, dwelling upon hope. His calmness impressed the\nsame on his children, as they moved about in the solemn stillness of the\nhouse; and when Harry, pale, and shocked at the blow to him so sudden,\ncame home, the grave silence soothed his violence of grief; and he sat\nbeside his, father or Mary, speaking in undertones of what Margaret had\nloved to hear from him, of Alan Ernescliffe’s last moments.\n\nMary gave way to a burst of weeping when she sought, in vain, for\ndaisies in the wintry garden; but Hector Ernescliffe went down to the\ncloisters, and brought back the lingering blossoms to be placed on\nMargaret’s bosom.\n\nThe dog Toby had followed him, unseen, to the cloister; and he was\nentering the garden, when he was struck by seeing the animal\nbounding, in irrepressible ecstasy, round a lad, whose tarpaulin hat,\nblue-bordered collar, and dark blue dress, showed him to be a sailor,\nas well as the broad-shouldered, grizzled, elderly man, who stood beside\nhim.\n\n“I say, sir,” said the latter, as Hector’s hand was on the door, “do you\nbelong to Dr. May?”\n\nHector unhesitatingly answered that he did.\n\n“Then, maybe, sir, you have heard of one Bill Jennings.”\n\nHector was all in one flush, almost choking, as he told that he was Mr.\nErnescliffe’s brother, and gave his hand to the sailor. “What could he\ndo for him?”\n\nJennings had heard from one of the crew of the Bucephalus that Mr. May\nhad been met, on his return to Portsmouth, by the news of his sister’s\ndeath. The Mays had helped his boy; he had been with Mr. May in the\nisland; he had laid Mr. Ernescliffe in his grave; and some notion had\ncrossed the sailor that he must be at Miss Margaret’s funeral--it might\nbe they would let him lend a hand--and, in this expedition, he was\nspending his time on shore.\n\nHow he was welcomed need not be told, nor how the tears came forth from\nfull hearts, as Dr. May granted his wish, and thanked him for doing what\nMargaret herself would indeed have chosen; and, in his blue sailor garb,\nwas Jennings added to the bearers, their own men, and two Cocksmoor\nlabourers, who, early on Christmas Eve, carried her to the minster. Last\ntime she had been there, Alan Ernescliffe had supported her. Now, what\nwas mortal of him lay beneath the palm tree, beneath the glowing summer\nsky, while the first snow-flakes hung like pearls on her pall. But\nas they laid her by her mother’s side, who could doubt that they were\ntogether?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n\n     At length I got unto the gladsome hill,\n             Where lay my hope;\n       Where lay my heart; and, climbing still,\n       When I had gained the brow and top,\n     A lake of brackish waters on the ground,\n             Was all I found.\n                           --GEORGE HERBERT.\n\n\nLate in the evening of the same snowy 24th of December, a little\ndaughter awoke to life at Abbotstoke Grange, and, not long after, Mrs.\nArnott came to summon Dr May from the anxious vigil in the sitting-room.\n“Come and see if you can do anything to soothe her,” she said, with much\nalarm. “The first sight of the baby has put her into such a state of\nagitation, that we do not know what to do with her.”\n\nIt was so, when he came to her bedside; that fixed stony look of despair\nwas gone; the source of tears, so long dried up, had opened again; and\nthere she lay, weeping quietly indeed, but profusely, and with deep\nheaving sobs. To speak, or to leave her alone, seemed equally perilous,\nbut he chose the first--he kissed and blessed her, and gave her joy. She\nlooked up at him as if his blessing once more brought peace, and said\nfaintly, “Now it is pardon--now I can die!”\n\n“The cloud is gone! Thanks for that above all!” said Dr. May fervently.\n“Now, my dear, rest in thankful gladness--you are too weak to talk or\nthink.”\n\n“I am weak--I am tired of it all,” said Flora. “I am glad to be going\nwhile I am so happy--there are Margaret--my own darling--rest--peace--”\n\n“You are not going, dearest,” said her father; “at least, I trust not,\nif you will not give way; here is a darling given to you, instead of the\nfirst, who needs you more.”\n\nHe would have taken the infant from the nurse and held her to her\nmother, but, recollecting how little Leonora had drawn her last breath\nin his arms, he feared the association, and signed to Mrs. Arnott to\nshow her the child; but she seemed as yet only able to feel that it was\nnot Leonora, and the long sealed-up grief would have its way. The tears\nburst out again. “Tell Ethel she will be the best mother to her. Name\nher Margaret--make her a Daisy of your own--don’t call her after me,”\n she said, with such passionate caresses, that Mrs. Arnott was glad to\ntake the babe away.\n\nDr. May’s next expedient was to speak to her of her husband, who needed\nher more than all, and to call him in. There seemed to be something\ntranquillising in his wistful manner of repeating, “Don’t cry, Flora;”\n and she was at last reduced, by her extreme exhaustion, to stillness;\nbut there were still many fears for her.\n\nDr. May’s prediction was accomplished--that she would suffer for having\nover-exerted herself. Her constitution had been severely tried by the\ngrief and despondency that she had so long endured in silence, and the\nfresh sorrow for her favourite sister coming at such a crisis. There\nwas a weariness of life, and an unwillingness to resume her ordinary\nroutine, that made her almost welcome her weakness and sinking; and now\nthat the black terror had cleared away from the future, she seemed to\nlong to follow Margaret at once, and to yearn after her lost child;\nwhile appeals to the affection that surrounded her often seemed to\noppress her, as if there were nothing but weariness and toil in store.\n\nThe state of her mind made her father very anxious, though it was but\ntoo well accounted for. Poor Flora had voluntarily assumed the trammels\nthat galled her; worldly motives had prompted her marriage, and though\nshe faithfully loved her husband, he was a heavy weight on her hands,\nand she had made it more onerous by thrusting him into a position for\nwhich he was not calculated, and inspiring him with a self-consequence\nthat would not recede from it. The shock of her child’s death had taken\naway the zest and energy which had rejoiced in her chosen way of life,\nand opened her eyes to see what Master she had been serving; and the\nperception of the hollowness of all that had been apparently good in\nher, had filled her with remorse and despair. Her sufferings had been\nthe more bitter because she had not parted with her proud reserve. She\nhad refused council, and denied her confidence to those who could have\nguided her repentance. Her natural good sense, and the sound principle\nin which she had been brought up, had taught her to distrust her gloomy\nfeelings as possibly morbid; and she had prayed, keeping her hold of\nfaith in the Infinite Mercy, though she could not feel her own part in\nit; and thus that faith was beginning at last to clear her path.\n\nIt was the harder to deal with her, because her hysterical agitation was\nso easily excited, that her father hardly dared to let a word be spoken\nto her; and she was allowed to see no one else except her aunt and the\ndear old nurse, whose tears for her child Margaret had been checked by\nthe urgent requirements of another of her nurslings; and whom George\nRivers would have paid with her weight in gold, for taking care of his\nnew daughter, regarding her as the only woman in the world that could be\ntrusted.\n\nThose were heavy days with every one, though each brought some shade of\nimprovement. They were harder to bear than the peaceful days that had\nimmediately followed the loss of Margaret; and Ethel was especially\nunhappy and forlorn under the new anxiety, where she could be of no\nservice; and with her precious occupation gone; her father absent,\ninstead of resting upon her; and her room deserted. She was grieved\nwith herself, because her feelings were unable to soar at the Christmas\nFeast, as erst on St. Andrew’s Day; and she was bewildered and\ndistressed by the fear that she had then been only uplifted by vanity\nand elation.\n\nShe told Richard so, and he said, kindly, that he thought a good deal of\nthat she complained of arose from bodily weariness.\n\nThis hurt her a little; but when he said, “I think that the blessings of\nSt. Andrew’s Day helped us through what was to follow,” she owned that\nit had indeed been so, and added, “I am going to work again! Tell me\nwhat will be most useful to you at Cocksmoor.”\n\nSick at heart as she was, she bravely set herself to appropriate the\nhours now left vacant; and manfully walked with Richard and Harry to\nchurch at Cocksmoor on St. Stephen’s Day; but the church brought back\nthe sense of contrast. Next, she insisted on fulfilling their\nintention of coming home by Abbotstoke to hear how Flora was, when the\nunfavourable account only added lead to the burden that weighed her\ndown. Though they were sent home in the carriage, she was so completely\nspent, that the effect of returning home to her room, without its dear\ninhabitant, was quite overwhelming, and she sat on her bed for half\nan hour, struggling with repinings. She came downstairs without having\ngained the victory, and was so physically overcome with lassitude, that\nRichard insisted on her lying on the sofa, and leaving everything to him\nand Mary.\n\nRichard seemed to make her his object in life, and was an unspeakable\nhelp and comforter to her, not only by taking every care for her for her\nsake, but by turning to her as his own friend and confidante, the best\nable to replace what they had lost. There were many plans to be put in\noperation for Cocksmoor, on which much consultation was needed, though\nevery word reminded them sadly of Margaret’s ever ready interest in\nthose schemes. It was very unlike Ethel’s vision of the first weeks\nof St. Andrew’s Church; but it might be safer for her than that aught\nshould tempt her to say, “See what my perseverance has wrought!”\n Perhaps her Margaret had begun to admire her too much to be her safest\nconfidante--at any rate, it was good still to sow in tears, rather than\non earth to reap in confident joy.\n\nNorman was as brotherly and kind as possible; but it was one of the\ndreary feelings of those days, that Ethel then first became aware of\nthe difference that his engagement had made, and saw that he resorted\nelsewhere for sympathy. She was not jealous, and acquiesced submissively\nand resolutely; but they had been so much to each other, that it was\na trial, especially at such a time as this, when freshly deprived of\nMargaret.\n\nNorman’s own prospect was not cheerful. He had received a letter\nfrom New Zealand, begging him to hasten his coming out, as there was\neducational work much wanting him, and, according to his original wish,\nhe could be ordained there in the autumnal Ember Week.\n\nHe was in much perplexity, since, according to this request, he ought to\nsail with his aunt in the last week of February, and he knew not how to\nreconcile the conflicting claims.\n\nMeta was not long in finding out the whole of his trouble, as they paced\nup and down the terrace together on a frosty afternoon.\n\n“You will go!” was her first exclamation.\n\n“I ought,” said Norman, “I believe I ought, and if it had only been at\nany other time, it would have been easy. My aunt’s company would have\nbeen such a comfort for you.”\n\n“It cannot be helped,” said Meta.\n\n“Considering the circumstances,” began Norman, with lingering looks at\nthe little humming-bird on his arm, “I believe I should be justified\nin waiting till such time as you could go with me. I could see what Mr.\nWilmot thinks.”\n\n“You don’t think so yourself,” said Meta. “Nobody else can give a\njudgment. In a thing like this, asking is, what you once called, seeking\nopinions as Balaam inquired.”\n\n“Turning my words against me?” said Norman, smiling. “Still, Meta,\nperhaps older heads would be fitter to judge what would be right for a\nlittle person not far off.”\n\n“She can be the best judge of that herself,” said Meta. “Norman,” and\nher dark eyes were steadfastly fixed, “I always resolved that, with\nGod’s help, I would not be a stumbling-block in the way of your call\nto your work. I will not. Go out now--perhaps you will be freer for it\nwithout me, and I suppose I have a longer apprenticeship to serve to all\nsorts of things before I come to help you.”\n\n“Oh, Meta, you are a rebuke to me!”\n\n“What? when I am going to stay by my own fireside?” said Meta, trying\nto laugh, but not very successfully. “Seriously, I have much to do here.\nWhen poor Flora gets well, she must be spared all exertion for a long\ntime to come; and I flatter myself that they want me at Stoneborough\nsometimes. If your father can bear to spare you, there is no doubt that\nyou ought to go.”\n\n“My father is as unselfish as you are, Meta. But I cannot speak to\nhim until he is more easy about Flora. We always think the required\nsacrifice the hardest, but I must own that I could not grieve if he laid\nhis commands on me to wait till the autumn.”\n\n“Oh, that would make it a duty and all easy,” said Meta, smiling; “but\nI don’t think he will; and Aunt Flora will be only too glad to carry you\nout without encumbrance.”\n\n“Has not Aunt Flora come to her senses about you?”\n\n“I believe she would rather I belonged to any of her nephews but\nyou. She is such a dear, sincere, kind-hearted person, and we are so\ncomfortable together, that it will be quite like home to come out to\nher! I mean there, to convince her that I can be of something like use.”\n\nMeta talked so as to brighten and invigorate Norman when they were\ntogether, but they both grew low-spirited when apart. The humming-bird\nhad hardly ever been so downcast as at present--that is, whenever she\nwas not engaged in waiting on her brother, or in cheering up Dr. May, or\nin any of the many gentle offices that she was ever fulfilling. She was\ngreatly disappointed, and full of fears for Norman, and dread of the\nseparation, but she would not give way; and only now and then, when off\nher guard, would the sadness reign on her face without an effort. Alone,\nshe fought and prayed for resignation for herself, and protection and\nstrength for him, and chid herself for the foolish feeling that he would\nbe safer with her.\n\nShe told Aunt Flora how it was one evening, as they sat over the fire\ntogether, speaking with a would-be tone of congratulation.\n\n“Indeed!” exclaimed Mrs. Arnott. “But that is a great pity!”\n\nMeta looked quite brightened by her saying so. “I thought you would be\nglad,” she rejoined.\n\n“Did you think me so hard-hearted?”\n\n“I thought you believed he would be better without me.”\n\n“My dear, we have not kept house and nursed together for a month for\nnothing,” said Mrs. Arnott, smiling.\n\n“Thank you,” said Meta, trying to answer the smile. “You have taken a\nload off me!”\n\n“I don’t like it at all,” said Mrs. Arnott. “It is a very uncomfortable\nplan for every one. And yet when I know how great is the want of him out\nthere, I can say nothing against it without high treason. Well, my dear,\nI’ll take all the care I can of Norman, and when you come, I shall be\nalmost as glad as if we were coming home for good. Poor Flora! she is\none person who will not regret the arrangement.”\n\n“Poor Flora!--you think her really better this evening?”\n\n“Much better, indeed; if we could only raise her spirits, I think she\nwould recover very well; but she is so sadly depressed. I must try to\ntalk to Ethel--she may better understand her.”\n\n“I have never understood Flora,” said Meta. “She has been as kind to\nme as possible, and I very soon came to a certain point with her, but\nI never have known her thoroughly. I doubt whether any one did but dear\nMargaret.”\n\nFlora was, however, much softened and less reserved than she had been.\nShe found great repose in her aunt’s attendance, retracing, as it\ndid, her mother’s presence, and she responded to her tenderness with\nincreasing reliance and comfort; while as her strength began to revive,\nand there was more disposition to talk, she became gradually drawn into\ngreater confidence.\n\nThe seeing of Ethel was one of the difficult questions. Flora had begun\nto wish it very much, and yet the bare idea threw her into a nervous\ntremor, that caused it to be put off again and again. Her aunt found her\none day almost faint with agitation--she had heard Ethel’s voice in the\nnext room, and had been winding up her expectations, and now was as much\ngrieved as relieved, to find that she had been there seeing the baby,\nbut was now gone.\n\n“How does the dear Ethel look?” asked Flora presently.\n\n“She is looking better to-day; she has looked very worn and harassed,\nbut I thought her brighter to-day. She walked over by Aubrey on his\npony, and I think it did her good.”\n\n“Dear old Ethel! Aunt, it is a thing that no one has told me yet. Can\nyou tell me how she bore the news of Norman Ogilvie’s engagement?”\n\n“Do you mean--” and Mrs. Arnott stopped short in her interrogation.\n\n“Yes,” said Flora, answering the pause.\n\n“But I thought young Ogilvie a most unexceptionable person.”\n\n“So he is,” said Flora. “I was much annoyed at the time, but she was\nresolute.”\n\n“In rejecting him?”\n\n“In running away as soon as she found what was likely to happen;” and\nFlora, in a few words, told what had passed at Oxford.\n\n“Then it was entirely out of devotion to your father?”\n\n“Entirely,” said Flora. “No one could look at her without seeing that\nshe liked him. I had left her to be the only effective one at home, and\nshe sacrificed herself.”\n\n“I am glad that I have seen her,” said Mrs. Arnott. “I should never have\nunderstood her by description. I always said that I must come home to\nset my correspondence going rightly.”\n\n“Aunt Flora,” said her niece, “do you remember my dear mother’s\nunfinished letter to you?”\n\n“To be sure I do, my dear.”\n\n“Nothing ever was more true,” said Flora. “I read it over some little\ntime ago, when I set my papers in order, and understood it then. I never\ndid before. I used to think it very good for the others.”\n\n“It is what one generally does with good advice.”\n\n“Do you recollect the comparison between Norman, Ethel, and me? It is\nso curious. Norman, who was ambitious and loved praise, but now dreads\nnothing so much; Ethel, who never cared for anything of the kind, but\nwent straight on her own brave way; and oh! Aunt Flora--me--”\n\n“Indeed, my dear, I should have thought you had her most full\napprobation.”\n\n“Ah! don’t you see the tone, as if she were not fully satisfied, as if\nshe only could not see surface faults in me,” said Flora; “and how she\nsaid she dreaded my love of praise, and of being liked. I wonder how\nit would have been if she had lived. I have looked back so often in the\npast year, and I think the hollowness began from that time. It might\nhave been there before, but I am not so sure. You see, at that dreadful\ntime, after the accident, I was the eldest who was able to be efficient,\nand much more useful than poor Ethel. I think the credit I gained made\nme think myself perfection, and I never did anything afterwards but seek\nmy own honour.”\n\nMrs. Arnott began better to understand Flora’s continued depression, but\nshe thought her self-reproach exaggerated, and said something at once\nsoothing and calculated to encourage her to undraw the curtain of\nreserve.\n\n“You do not know,” continued Flora, “how greedy I was of credit and\naffection. It made me jealous of Ethel herself, as long as we were in\nthe same sphere; and when I felt that she was more to papa than I could\nbe, I looked beyond home for praise. I don’t think the things I did were\nbad in themselves--brought up as I have been, they could hardly be so. I\nknew what merits praise and blame too well for that--but oh! the motive.\nI do believe I cared very much for Cocksmoor. I thought it would be a\ngrand thing to bring about; but, you see, as it has turned out, all\nI thought I had done for it was in vain; and Ethel has been the real\nperson and does not know it. I used to think Ethel so inferior to me.\nI left her all my work at home. If it had not been for that, she might\nhave been happy with Norman Ogilvie--for never were two people better\nmatched, and now she has done what I never thought to have left to\nanother--watched over our own Margaret. Oh! how shall I ever bear to see\nher?”\n\n“My dear, I am sure nothing can be more affectionate than Ethel. She\ndoes not think these things.”\n\n“She does,” said Flora. “She always knew me better than I did myself.\nHer straightforward words should often have been rebukes to me. I shall\nsee in every look and tone the opinion I have deserved. I have shrunk\nfrom her steadfast looks ever since I myself learned what I was. I could\nnot bear them now--and yet--oh, aunt, you must bring her! Ethel! my\ndear, dear old King--my darling’s godmother--the last who was with\nMargaret!”\n\nShe had fallen into one of those fits of weeping when it was impossible\nto attempt anything but soothing her; but, though she was so much\nexhausted that Mrs. Arnott expected to be in great disgrace with Dr. May\nfor having let her talk herself into this condition, she found that\nhe was satisfied to find that she had so far relieved her mind, and\ndeclared that she would be better now.\n\nThe effect of the conversation was, that the next day, the last of the\ntwelve Christmas days, when Ethel, whose yearning after her sister was\nalmost equally divided between dread and eagerness--eagerness for her\nembrace, and dread of the chill of her reserve, came once again in\nhopes of an interview. Dr. May called her at once. “I shall take you\nin without any preparation,” he said, “that she may not have time to be\nflurried. Only, be quiet and natural.”\n\nDid he know what a mountain there was in her throat when he seemed to\nthink it so easy to be natural?\n\nShe found him leading her into a darkened room, and heard his cheerful\ntones saying, “I have brought Ethel to you!”\n\n“Ethel! oh!” said a low, weak voice, with a sound as of expecting a\ntreat, and Ethel was within a curtain, where she began, in the dimness,\nto see something white moving, and her hands were clasped by two long\nthin ones. “There!” said Dr. May, “now, if you will be good, I will\nleave you alone. Nurse is by to look after you, and you know she always\nseparates naughty children.”\n\nEither the recurrence to nursery language, or the mere sisterly touch\nafter long separation, seemed to annihilate all the imaginary mutual\ndread, and, as Ethel bent lower and lower, and Flora’s arms were round\nher, the only feeling was of being together again, and both at once made\nthe childish gesture of affection, and murmured the old pet names of\n“Flossy,” and “King,” that belonged to almost forgotten days, when they\nwere baby sisters, then kissed each other again.\n\n“I can’t see you,” said Ethel, drawing herself up a little. “Why, Flora,\nyou look like a little white shadow!”\n\n“I have had such weak eyes,” said Flora, “and this dim light is\ncomfortable. I see your old sharp face quite plain.”\n\n“But what can you do here?”\n\n“Do? Oh, dear Ethel, I have not had much of doing. Papa says I have\nthree years’ rest to make up.”\n\n“Poor Flora!” said Ethel; “but I should have thought it tiresome,\nespecially for you.”\n\n“I have only now been able to think again,” said Flora; “and you will\nsay I am taking to quoting poetry. Do you remember some lines in that\ndrama that Norman admired so much?”\n\n“Philip von Artevelde?”\n\n“Yes. I can’t recollect them now, though they used to be always running\nin my head--something about time to mend and time to mourn.”\n\n“These?” said Ethel--\n\n\n              “He that lacks time to mourn, lacks time to mend.\n               Eternity mourns that.”\n\n\n“I never had time before for either,” said Flora. “You cannot think\nhow I used to be haunted by those, when I was chased from one thing to\nanother, all these long, long eighteen months. I am in no haste to take\nup work again.”\n\n“Mending as well as mourning,” said Ethel thoughtfully.\n\nFlora sighed.\n\n“And now you have that dear little Christmas gift to--” Ethel paused.\n\n“She is not nearly so fine and healthy as her sister was,” said Flora,\n“poor little dear. You know, Ethel, even now, I shall have very little\ntime with her in that London life. Her papa wants me so much, and I must\nleave her to--to the nurses.” Flora’s voice trembled again.\n\n“Our own dear old nurse,” said Ethel.\n\n“Oh! I wanted to thank you all for sparing her to us,” said Flora.\n“George wished it so much. But how does poor little Daisy bear it?”\n\n“Very magnanimously,” said Ethel, smiling. “In fact, nurse has had but\nlittle to do with Daisy of late, and would have been very forlorn at\nhome. It is better for Aubrey and for her, not to return to be babies\nto comfort poor nurse. I have been breaking up the nursery, and taking\nGertrude to live with me.”\n\n“Have you gone back there again?”\n\n“It would not have been better for waiting,” said Ethel; “and Gertrude\nwas so proud to come to me. I could not have done it without her, but\npapa must not have vacancy next to him.”\n\n“It has been hard on you for me to engross him,” said Flora; “but oh,\nEthel, I could not spare him. I don’t think even you can tell what papa\nis.”\n\n“You have found it out,” said Ethel, in an odd, dry manner; which in\nsound, though not in feeling, was a contrast to the soft, whispering,\ntearful murmurs of her sister.\n\n“And my aunt!” continued Flora--“that I should have taken up such a\ngreat piece of her short visit!”\n\n“Ah! it is coming to an end very fast,” said Ethel, sighing; “but you\nhad the best right to her, and she and Meta have seen so much of each\nother. She tells me she is quite satisfied about Meta now.”\n\n“I am sorry to see Meta looking out of spirits,” said Flora. “I almost\nmade her cry by saying something about Norman. Is there anything going\nwrong?”\n\nEthel, as usual, blundered into the subject. “Only about Norman’s going\nout.”\n\nFlora asked further questions, and she was obliged to explain. It roused\nFlora’s energies at once.\n\n“This will never do!” she said. “They must marry, and go with my aunt.”\n\nEthel was aghast. “They would not hear of it now!”\n\n“They must. It is the only reasonable thing. Why, Norman would be\nmiserable, and as to Meta--Imagine his going out and returning--a year’s\nwork, such an expense and loss of time, besides the missing Aunt Flora.”\n\n“If it were not wrong--”\n\n“The waste would be the wrong thing. Besides--” and she told of\nMargaret’s wishes.\n\n“But, Flora, think--the last week in February--and you so ill!”\n\n“I am not to marry them,” said Flora, smiling. “If it could be in a\nfortnight, they could go and get their outfit afterwards, and come\nback to us when I am stronger. Let me see--there need be no fuss about\nsettlements--Mr. Rivers’s will arranges everything for her.”\n\n“It would be a good thing to get rid of a fine wedding,” said Ethel;\n“but they will never consent!”\n\n“Yes, they will, and be grateful.”\n\n“Papa would be happier about Norman,” said Ethel; “but I cannot fancy\nhis liking it. And you--you can’t spare Meta, for Aunt Flora must go to\nthe Arnotts’ in a week or two more.”\n\n“Suppose papa was to let me have you,” said Flora. “If he wants you, he\nmust come after you.”\n\nEthel gasped at the thought that her occupation at home was gone, but\nshe said, “If I am not too awkward for you, dear Flora. You will miss\nMeta terribly.”\n\n“I can’t keep the humming-bird caged, with her heart far away,” said\nFlora.\n\nDr. May came in to break up the conversation, and Ethel quickly guessed\nfrom his manner that Norman had been talking to him. Flora told him that\nshe had been agreeing with Ethel that Meta had much better not miss this\nopportunity. He was far less startled than Ethel had expected; indeed,\nthe proposal was rather a relief to his mind, and his chief objection\nwas the fear that Flora would be fatigued by the extra bustle; but she\npromised not to trouble herself about it, otherwise than that if Norman\ncould not persuade Meta, she would. The sisters parted, much more\ncomfortable than before. Ethel felt as if she had found something like a\ndim reflection of Margaret, and Flora’s fear of Ethel had fled away from\nthe mere force of sisterhood.\n\nAs to Norman, he declared that he had not the audacity to make the\nproposal to Meta, though he was only too grateful; so his father carried\nit to the humming-bird; and, as soon as she found that it was\nnot improper, nor would hurt any one’s feelings, she gave ready\nconsent--only begging that it might be as best suited every one,\nespecially Flora; and ending by a whisper to her dear fatherly friend,\nowning that she was “very glad--she meant she was very glad there would\nbe nobody there.”\n\nSo Norman and Meta settled their plans as they walked home together from\nevening service, after listening to the prophecies of the blessings to\nbe spread into the waste and desolate places, which should yet become\nthe heritage of the Chosen, and with the evening star shining on them,\nlike a faint reflex of the Star of the East, Who came to be a Light to\nlighten the Gentiles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\n\n  Euna delle facolta singolari ed incommunicabili della religione\n  Cristiana questa, di poter dare indirizzo e quiete a chiunoque, in\n  qualsivoglia congiuntura, a qualsivoglia termine, ricorra ad essa.\n  Se al passato v’e rimedio, essa lo prescrive, lo somministra, presta\n  lume e vigore per metterlo in opera a qualunque costo; se non v’e,\n  essa da il, modo di fare realmento e in effeto, cio che 1’ uom dice\n  in proverbio, della necessita virtu.  Insegna a continuare con\n  sapienza cio che e stato intrapreso per leggerezza, piega l’animo ad\n  abbracciare con propensione cio che e stato imposto dalla prepotenza,\n  e da ad un elezione che fu temeraria, ma che e irrevocabile, tutta la\n  santita, tutto il consiglio, diciamolo pur francamenta, tutte le\n  gioje della vocazione.--MANZONI.\n\n\nThe wedding-day was fixed for the 20th of January, since it was less\nrisk to Flora as an absolute invalid, than as convalescent enough to\ntake any share in the doings.\n\nMeta managed her correspondence with her own relatives, and obtained her\nuncle’s kind approval, since he saw there could be nothing else; while\nher aunt treated her as an infatuated victim, but wished, for her\nmother’s sake, to meet her in London before she sailed.\n\nThe worst stroke of all was to Bellairs, who had never chosen to believe\nthat her mistress could move without her, and though mortally afraid in\ncrossing to the Isle of Wight, and utterly abhorring all “natives,” went\ninto hysterics on finding that her young lady would take out no maid but\na little hard-working village girl; and though transferred in the most\nflattering manner to Mrs. Rivers’s service, shed a tear for every stitch\nshe set in the trousseau, and assured her betrothed butler that, if Miss\nRivers would only have heard reason, she would have followed her to the\nworld’s end, rather than that her beautiful hair should never look like\nanything again.\n\nSo the wedding-day came, and grass and trees wore a fitting suit of\ncrisp hoariness. Nothing could be quieter. Meta was arrayed by the\nsobbing Bellairs in her simple bridal white, wrapped herself in a large\nshawl, took her brother’s arm, and walked down the frosty path with him\nand Mrs. Arnott, as if going merely to the daily service.\n\nThe time had not been made known, and there was hardly an addition to\nthe ordinary congregation, except the May family and Dr. Spencer; but\nthe Christmas evergreens still adorned aisle and chancel, and over the\naltar stood the motto that Meta herself had woven of holly, on that\nChristmas Eve of grief and anxiety, without knowing how it would speak\nto her.\n\n\n  Fear not, for behold I bring unto you glad tidings of great joy,\n  that shall be unto you and to all people.\n\n\nFear not, for length of voyage, for distance from kindred, for hardship,\nprivation, misunderstanding, disappointment. The glad tidings are to all\npeople, even to the utmost parts of the earth. Ye have your portion in\nthe great joy--ye have freely cast in your lot with those, whose feet\nare beautiful on the mountains, who bear the good tidings. Fear not, for\nHe is with you, who will never forsake.\n\nThus Dr. May read the words with swelling heart, as he looked at his\nson’s clear, grave, manful look, even as it had been when he made his\nConfirmation vow--his natural nervous excitability quelled by a spirit\nnot his own, and chastened into strong purpose; and the bride, her young\nface the more lovely for the depth of enthusiasm restrained by awe and\nhumility, as she stood without trembling or faltering, the strength of\ninnocence expressed in the whole bearing of her slight figure in her\nwhite drapery. Around were the four sisterly bride’s-maids, their black\ndresses showing that these were still the twilight days of mourning, and\nthat none would forget her, whose prayers might still bless their labour\nof love.\n\nWhen Margaret Agatha May, on her husband’s arm, turned for a last look\nat the altar of her own church, “Fear not,” in evergreen letters, was\nthe greeting she bore away.\n\nEthel was left at the Grange for the ensuing fortnight--a time of\nunusual leisure both to her and to Flora, which they both prized highly,\nfor it taught them to know each other as they had never done before.\nFlora’s confidence to her aunt had been a good thing for her, though\nso partial; it opened the way for further unreserve to one who knew\nthe circumstances better, and, as to dread of Ethel, that could seldom\nprevail in her presence, partly from long habit, partly from her\ndeficiency of manner, and still more from her true humility and\naffection. Gradually she arrived at the perception of the history of her\nsister’s mind; understood what gloom had once overshadowed it; and how,\nsince light had once shone upon her, she shrank not merely from the\ntasks that had become wearisome to her, but from the dread of losing\namong them her present peace.\n\n“They are your duty,” argued Ethel. “Duty brings peace.”\n\n“They were not,” said Flora.\n\n“They are now,” said Ethel.\n\n“Dinners and parties, empty talk and vain show,” said Flora languidly.\n“Are you come to their defence, Ethel? If you could guess how sick one\ngets of them, and how much worse it is for them not to be hateful!\nAnd to think of bringing my poor little girl up to the like, if she is\nspared!”\n\n“If they are not duties, I would not do them,” said Ethel.\n\n“Ethel,” cried her sister, raising herself from her couch eagerly, “I\nwill say it to you! What should you think of George resigning his seat,\nand living in peace here?”\n\n“Would he?” said Ethel.\n\n“If I wished it.”\n\n“But what would he do with himself?” said Ethel, not in too\ncomplimentary a strain.\n\n“Yachting, farming, Cochin-Chinese--or something,” said Flora. “Anything\nnot so wearing as this!”\n\n“That abominable candidate of Tomkins’s would come in!” exclaimed Ethel.\n“Oh, Flora, that would be horrid!”\n\n“That might be guarded against,” said Flora. “Perhaps Sir Henry--But oh!\nlet us leave politics in peace while we can. I thought we should do some\ngreat good, but it is all a maze of confusion. It is so hard to know\nprinciples from parties, and everything goes wrong! It is of no use to\ncontend with it!”\n\n“It is never vain to contend with evil,” said Ethel.\n\n“We are not generalising,” said Flora. “There is evil nearer home\nthan the state of parties, and I can’t see that George’s being in\nParliament--being what he is--is anything like the benefit to things\nin general--that it is temptation and plague to me, besides the risk of\nLondon life for the baby, now and hereafter.”\n\n“I can’t say that I think it is,” said Ethel. “How nice it would be to\nhave you here! I am so glad you are willing to give it up.”\n\n“It would have been better to have given it up untasted--like Norman,”\n sighed Flora. “I will talk to George.”\n\n“But, Flora,” said Ethel, a little startled, “you ought not to do such a\nthing without advice.”\n\n“There will be worry enough before it is done!” sighed Flora. “No fear\nof that!”\n\n“Stop a minute,” said Ethel, as if poor Flora could have done anything\nbut lie still on her sofa. “I think you ought to consider well before\nyou set it going.”\n\n“Have not I longed for it day and night? It is an escape from peril for\nourselves and our child.”\n\n“I can’t be sure!” said Ethel. “It may be more wrong to make George\ndesert the post which--”\n\n“Which I thrust him into,” said Flora. “My father told me as much.”\n\n“I did not mean you to say that! But it is a puzzle. It seems as if it\nwere right to give up such things; yet, when I recollect the difficulty\nof carrying an election right at Stoneborough, I think papa would be\nvery sorry. I don’t think his interest would bring in any sound man but\nhis son-in-law; and George himself seems to like his parliamentary life\nbetter than anything else.”\n\n“Yes,” said Flora hesitatingly; for she knew it was true--he liked to\nthink himself important, and it gave him something to think of, and\nregular occupation--not too active or onerous; but she could not tell\nEthel what she herself felt; that all she could do for him could not\nprevent him from being held cheap by the men among whom she had placed\nhim.\n\n“Then,” said Ethel, as she heard her affirmative, “I don’t think it is\nfor his dignity, for you to put him into Parliament to please you and\nthen take him out to please you.”\n\n“I’ll take care of his dignity,” said Flora shortly.\n\n“I know you would do it well--”\n\n“I am sick of doing things well!” said poor Flora. “You little know how\nI dread reading up all I must read presently! I shall lose all I have\nscarcely gained. I cannot find peace any way, but by throwing down the\nload I gave my peace for.”\n\n“Whether this is truth or fancy,” said Ethel thoughtfully. “If you would\nask some one competent.”\n\n“Don’t you know there are some things one cannot ask?” said Flora. “I\ndon’t know why I spoke to you! Ah! come in! Why, George, that is a finer\negg than ever,” as he entered with a Shanghai egg in each hand, for her\nto mark with the date when it had been laid. Poultry was a new hobby,\nand Ethel had been hearing, in her tete-a-tete dinners with George,\na great deal about the perfections of the hideous monsters that\nhad obtained fabulous prices. They had been the best resource for\nconversation; but she watched, with something between vexation and\nsoftness, how Flora roused herself to give her full attention and\ninterest to his prosing about his pets, really pleased as it seemed;\nand, at last, encouraging him actually to fetch his favourite cock to\nshow her; when she went through the points of perfection of the ungainly\nmass of feathers, and did not at all allow Ethel to laugh at the\nunearthly sounds of disapproval which handling elicited.\n\n“And this is our senator!” thought Ethel. “I wonder whether Honorius’s\nhen was a Shanghai! Poor Flora is right--it is poor work to make a silk\npurse out of a sow’s ear! but, putting him into the place is one thing,\ntaking him out another. I wish she would take advice; but I never knew\nher do that, except as a civil way of communicating her intentions.\nHowever, she is not quite what she was! Poor dear! Aunt Flora will never\nbelieve what a beautiful creature she used to be! It seems wrong to\nthink of her going back to that horrid London; but I can’t judge. For\nmy part, I’d rather do work, than no work for George, and he is a good,\nkind-hearted fellow after all! I won’t be a crab!”\n\nSo Ethel did her best, and said the cock had a bright eye--all she could\nsay for him--and George instructed her to admire the awkward legs, and\ninvited her to a poultry show, at Whitford, in two days’ time--and they\nsent him away to continue his consultations with the poultry woman,\nwhich pullets should be preferred as candidates for a prize.\n\n“Meta set him upon this,” said Flora. “I hope you will go, Ethel. You\nsee he can be very happy here.”\n\n“Still,” said Ethel, “the more I think, the more sure I am that you\nought to ask advice.”\n\n“I have asked yours,” said Flora, as if it were a great effort. “You\ndon’t know what to say--I shall do what I see to be the only way to\nrest.”\n\n“I do know what to say,” said Ethel; “and that is, do as the Prayer-book\ntells you, in any perplexity.”\n\n“I am not perplexed,” said Flora.\n\n“Don’t say so. This is either the station to which God has called you,\nor it is not.”\n\n“He never called me to it.”\n\n“But you don’t know whether you ought to leave it. If you ought not, you\nwould be ten times more miserable. Go to Richard, Flora--he belongs to\nyou as much as I--he has authority besides.”\n\n“Richard!”\n\n“He is the clearest of us all in practical matters,” said Ethel,\npreventing what she feared would be disparaging. “I don’t mean only that\nyou should ask him about this Parliament matter alone; but I am sure\nyou would be happier and more settled if you talked things over with him\nbefore--before you go to church.”\n\n“You don’t know what you propose.”\n\n“I do,” said Ethel, growing bolder. “You have been going all this time\nby feeling. You have never cleared up, and got to the bottom of, your\ntroubles.”\n\n“I could not talk to any one.”\n\n“Not to any one but a clergyman. Now, to enter on such a thing is most\naverse to your nature; and I do believe that, for that very reason, it\nwould be what would do you most good. You say you have recovered sense\nof--Oh, Flora! I can’t talk of what you have gone through; but if you\nhave only a vague feeling that seems as if lying still would be the only\nway to keep it, I don’t think it can be altogether sound, or the ‘quiet\nconscience’ that is meant.”\n\n“Oh, Ethel! Ethel! I have never told you what I have undergone, since I\nknew my former quietness of conscience was but sleep! I have gone on in\nagony, with the sense of hypocrisy and despair, because I was afraid,\nfor George’s sake, to do otherwise.”\n\nEthel felt herself utterly powerless to advise; and, after a kind sound\nof sympathy, sat shocked, pondering on what none could answer; whether\nthis were, indeed, what poor Flora imagined, or whether it had been a\nholding-fast to the thread through the darkness. The proud reserve was\nthe true evil, and Ethel prayed and trusted it might give way.\n\nShe went very amiably to Whitford with George, and gained great credit\nwith him, for admiring the prettiest speckled Hamburgh present; indeed,\nGeorge was becoming very fond of “poor Ethel,” as he still called her,\nand sometimes predicted that she would turn out a fine figure of a woman\nafter all.\n\nEthel heard, on her return, that Richard had been there; and three days\nafter, when Flora was making arrangements for going to church, a moment\nof confidence came over her, and she said, “I did it, Ethel! I have\nspoken to Richard.”\n\n“I am so glad!”\n\n“You were right. He is as clear as he is kind,” said Flora; “he showed\nme that, for George’s sake, I must bear with my present life, and do the\nbest I can with it, unless some leading comes for an escape; and that\nthe glare, and weariness, and being spoken well of, must be taken as\npunishment for having sought after these things.”\n\n“I was afraid he would say so,” said Ethel. “But you will find happiness\nagain, Flora dear.”\n\n“Scarcely--before I come to Margaret and to my child,” sighed Flora. “I\nsuppose it was Mercy that would not let me follow when I wished it. I\nmust work till the time of rest comes!”\n\n“And your own little Margaret will cheer you!” said Ethel, more\nhopefully, as she saw Flora bend over her baby with a face that might\none day be bright.\n\nShe trusted that patient continuance in well-doing would one day win\npeace and joy, even in the dreary world that poor Flora had chosen.\n\nFor her own part, Ethel found Flora’s practical good sense and sympathy\nvery useful, in her present need of the counsel she had always had from\nMargaret.\n\nThe visit to Flora lasted a fortnight, and Ethel was much benefited by\nthe leisure for reading and the repose after the long nursing; though,\nbefore the end, her refreshed energies began to pine for Daisy and her\nhymns, for Aubrey and his Virgil, for Cherry and her scholars, and,\nabove all, for her father; for, come as often as he would, it was not\npapa at home.\n\nOn the other hand, Mary was at a loss for Ethel every hour; Richard\nwas putting off his affairs till Ethel should come home; Miss Bracy\nand Blanche longed for her to relieve the schoolroom from the children;\nAubrey could not perform a lesson in comfort with any one else--never\nended a sum without groaning for Ethel, and sometimes rode to Abbotstoke\nfor the mere purpose of appealing to her; in short, no one could get on\nwithout her, and the doctor least of all.\n\nDr. Spencer, and Mr. Wilmot, and all his sons and daughters, had done\ntheir best for him; but, in spite of his satisfaction at seeing the two\nsisters so happy together, he could not help missing Ethel every minute,\nas the very light of his home; and when, at last, Flora brought her\nback, she was received with uproarious joy by Aubrey and Daisy, while\nthe rest of the household felt a revival and refreshment of spirits--the\nfirst drawing aside of the cloud that had hung over the winter.\nThe pearl of their home might be missed every hour, but they could\nthankfully rest in the trust that she was a jewel stored up in safety\nand peace, to shine as a star for evermore.\n\nA few weeks more, and there were other partings, sad indeed, yet cheery.\nDr. May told Mrs. Arnott that, though he grieved that so much of sorrow\nhad come to dim her visit, he could not but own that it was the very\ntime when her coming could be most comforting; and this, as she truly\nsaid, was satisfaction enough for her, besides that she could not\nrejoice enough that her arrival had been in time to see their dear\nMargaret. She should carry away most precious recollections; and she\nfurther told Dr. Spencer that she was far more comfortable about\nher brother-in-law, than if she had only known him in his youthful\ncharacter, which had seemed so little calculated to bear sorrow or care.\nShe looked at him now only to wonder at, and reverence the change that\nhad been gradually wrought by the affections placed above.\n\nNorman and his wife went with her--the one grave but hopeful, the other\ntrying to wile away the pain of parting, by her tearful mirth--making\nall sorts of odd promises and touching requests, between jest and\nearnest, and clinging to the last to her dear father-in-law, as if the\nseparation from him were the hardest of all.\n\n“Well, humming-birds must be let fly!” said he at last. “Ah! ha! Meta,\nare they of no use?”\n\n“Stay till you hear!” said Meta archly--then turning back once more.\n“Oh! how I have thanked you, Ethel, for those first hints you gave me\nhow to make my life real. If I had only sat still and wished, instead of\ntrying what could be done as I was, how unhappy I should have been!”\n\n“Come, take your sprite away, Norman, if you don’t want me to keep her\nfor good! God bless you, my dear children! Good-bye! Who knows but when\nDoctor Tom sets up in my place, Ethel and I may come out and pay you a\nvisit?”\n\nIt had all been over for some weeks, and the home-party had settled down\nagain into what was likely to be their usual course, excepting in the\nholidays, to which the doctor looked forward with redoubled interest, as\nTom was fast becoming a very agreeable and sensible companion; for his\nmoodiness had been charmed away by Meta, and principle was teaching\nhim true command of temper. He seemed to take his father as a special\ncharge, bequeathed to him by Norman, and had already acquired that\nvalue and importance at home which comes of the laying aside of all\nself-importance.\n\nIt was a clear evening in March, full of promise of spring, and Ethel\nwas standing in the church porch at Cocksmoor, after making some visits\nin the parish, waiting for Richard, while the bell was ringing for the\nWednesday evening service, and the pearly tints of a cloudless sunset\nwere fading into the western sky.\n\nEthel began to wonder where Norman might be looking at the sun dipping\ninto the western sea, and thence arose before her the visions of her\ngirlhood, when she had first dreamt of a church on Cocksmoor, and of\nRichard ministering before a willing congregation. So strange did the\naccomplishment seem, that she even touched the stone to assure herself\nof the reality; and therewith came intense thanksgiving that the work\nhad been taken out of her hands, to be the more fully blessed and\naccomplished--that is, as far as the building went; as to the people,\nthere was far more labour in store, and the same Hand must be looked to\nfor the increase.\n\nFor herself, Ethel looked back and looked on. Norman Ogilvie’s marriage\nseemed to her to have fixed her lot in life, and what was that lot? Home\nand Cocksmoor had been her choice, and they were before her. Home! but\nher eyes had been opened to see that earthly homes may not endure, nor\nfill the heart. Her dear father might, indeed, claim her full-hearted\ndevotion, but, to him, she was only one of many. Norman was no longer\nsolely hers; and she had begun to understand that the unmarried woman\nmust not seek undivided return of affection, and must not set her love,\nwith exclusive eagerness, on aught below, but must be ready to cease in\nturn to be first with any. Ethel was truly a mother to the younger ones;\nbut she faced the probability that they would find others to whom she\nwould have the second place. To love each heartily, to do her utmost for\neach in turn, and to be grateful for their fondness, was her call; but\nnever to count on their affection as her sole right and inalienable\npossession. She felt that this was the probable course, and that\nshe might look to becoming comparatively solitary in the course of\nyears--then tried to realise what her lonely life might be, but broke\noff smiling at herself, “What is that to me? What will it be when it is\nover? My course and aim are straight on, and He will direct my paths.\nI don’t know that I shall be alone, and I shall have the memory--the\ncommunion with them, if not their presence. Some one there must be to be\nloved and helped, and the poor for certain. Only I must have my treasure\nabove, and when I think what is there, and of--Oh! that bliss of being\nperfectly able to praise--with no bad old self to mar the full joy of\ngiving thanks, and blessing, and honour, and power! Need I dread a few\nshort years?--and they have not begun yet--perhaps they won’t--Oh! here\nis actually papa coming home this way! how delightful! Papa, are you\ncoming to church here?”\n\n“Ay, Ethel. That weathercock of Spencer’s is a magnet, I believe! It\ndraws me from all parts of the country to hear Richard in St. Andrew’s\nChurch.”\n",
