  "content": "Leila at Home\nAnn Fraser Tytler\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nIt was the intention of the writer of the following pages to have bid a\nlast farewell to Leila, but some of her young readers have said “No;”\nand she feels too grateful for the kindness they have shown her, not to\nmake the attempt to meet their wishes. Circumstances have so long\nprevented her fulfilling this intention, that it may be necessary to\nremind them that they took leave of Leila when she had just set off for\nWoodlands, (near Richmond,) a property Mr. Howard had purchased near the\nresidence of her uncle, Mr. Stanley; that Leila was in all the joy of\nher cousin, Selina Stanley, having recovered her speech; that Selina’s\nsister, Matilda, was continuing to make many good resolutions, and too\noften to break them again; and that their brother, little Alfred, was\nlittle Alfred still, and not over wise.\n\n\n\n\n                            LEILA AT HOME.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nThe wooded banks of Richmond were in all the soft green of early spring,\nwhen they were first seen by Leila. A few months had passed; the trees\nwere now half stripped of their leaves, and the autumn tints were fast\nfading into sombre gray as she a second time caught sight of its wooded\nheights; but how different were now her feelings, how much more\nbeautiful did the whole scene appear to her with Selina by her side!\nSelina was spring, summer, sunshine, and all to Leila, and she had not a\nsigh to give to the falling leaves or the moaning wind.\n\nAs the carriage drew up before the same low, picturesque-looking house,\nwhich she had before visited, Matilda and Alfred (who with their papa\nand mamma had preceded them but a few minutes) stood holding the\nhouse-door open, ready to give them welcome. Little Alfred bustled out\nto assist in letting down the steps, and Matilda, in her eagerness to\nhelp them to alight, had well nigh brought them to the ground.\n\n“Softly, softly,” Mr. Howard exclaimed, as he endeavoured to catch hold\nof Leila’s frock; but Matilda had succeeded in extricating both the\nlittle girls from the carriage.\n\n“Oh, what a day of joy!” she cried; “Cousin Leila still to be with us\nfor a whole month, and Selina as able to talk to her now as I am;\nSelina, do you remember when you went away?”\n\nSelina did remember: she coloured, her eyes filled with tears, and\nthrowing her arms first round her sister’s neck, and then round Leila’s,\nshe darted from their side.\n\n“Why does she do that? where has she gone?” Leila anxiously inquired.\n\n“I think I know,” Matilda answered; and pointing to a door on the\nopposite side of the passage, she flew back to the carriage to assist in\ngetting out the parcels.\n\nLeila crossed the passage, and softly opened the door; Selina was on her\nknees by the side of her little bed; she timidly advanced, and lifting\nthe white muslin curtain which partly concealed Selina’s slight figure,\nshe knelt by her side. As the two little girls rose from their knees,\ntheir eyes met eyes so full of gratitude to heaven, as almost made\nSelina’s half-whispered explanation, “Leila, I could not wait till\nnight, unnecessary;” “and now,” she continued, “I must go to dear\nmamma.”\n\nWhen Selina returned soon after, she found Leila and Matilda, assisted\nby Amy, arranging the smaller parcels, and carrying them to the\ndifferent rooms. Matilda looked eagerly in Selina’s eyes.\n\n“I see what you have been doing,” she said, reproachfully: “but I think\nit is I that should cry: when we were here before, I had to speak both\nfor you and myself. Oh, it was so nice; no, no, Selina, I don’t mean\nthat, I don’t indeed; I am so glad you can speak, oh, so very glad; I\nsaid it only to make you laugh, and now I am near crying myself, but I\nwon’t; this is not a day to weep, the very happiest day of all our\nlives. Come, let us go and visit the school-room; not to say lessons,\nyou know, but just to enjoy ourselves.”\n\n“Yes, that will be an excellent plan,” Leila answered; “and perhaps in\nthe bread-basket we shall still find the head of the doll, which would\nhave been so pretty a doll for my Sally, if it had not been so hardly\ndealt with.”\n\nMatilda laughed; “How funny you are,” she said, turning to Leila, and\npassing her arm round her waist; “you have put away my sorrow in a\nminute.”\n\nThe three little girls proceeded to the school-room.\n\n“How very nice it looks!” Leila exclaimed; “how bright, how\ncheerful-looking; so different from what it was before.”\n\n“And were you very melancholy when you were here before, and did not\nfind us?” Matilda inquired.\n\n“Oh, so melancholy when I saw the flowerpots,” Leila answered; “and I\ncried so when I saw the paper with ‘Custom commonly makes things easy.’\nYes, ‘Custom commonly’ was the worst of all.”\n\n“But that is all over now,” Matilda observed; “so we need not speak\nabout it, for now we are all three as happy as can be; don’t you think\nso, Selina?”\n\n“Indeed I do, Matilda; but it is such a deep joy I cannot find words to\nutter it; it does not make me merry, but do not think it is because I am\nsad. If you are happy and think it a joyful day, what must it be to me?\nI had given up all hope of ever being able to speak again; I was telling\nLeila so that very day, and making her promise not to pray for it any\nmore. Then so many changes have come upon me. When I saw Leila on the\nground, when I thought her dead,--oh, I must not think of it; and when\nshe opened her eyes again, and said, ‘Who spoke? what has happened?’ and\nwhen she knew God had opened my lips, what a moment that was! Leila’s\njoy, and my joy too, and to be able to tell her how much I loved her.\nYou do not know how I used to struggle before, and what it was for me\nnot to be able to speak.”\n\n“Indeed I do know very well,” Matilda answered; “for when mamma often\nsays to me, ‘Matilda, I must beg you to be silent, you distract my\nhead,’ I am more anxious to speak than ever; and so vexed, I would\nrather she had given me a good slap.”\n\n“A good _slap_!” Leila exclaimed. “Oh, Matilda, if my papa were ever to\nslap me, I would--” she covered her face with her hands and shuddered.\n\n“What would you do?” Matilda anxiously inquired, as she pulled down\nLeila’s hands, and tried to get a sight of her face.\n\n“I would die,” Leila answered, in a voice so low that the words were\nscarcely audible.\n\nBut Matilda caught them. “Oh dear,” she cried, “how I have shocked you;\nwhat a shocked face you have; well, I am always saying something wrong,\nand I dare say I shall never be better; for these kind of things come\nout before I know what I am saying. Selina, do you think it was so very\nwrong, and was Leila right to say she would----? You know what I mean.\nYou always tell me we should take trials patiently.”\n\nSelina coloured. “I think you were both a little wrong,” she said,\ntimidly. “You were wrong to talk in that way of dear mamma, who is\nalways so patient and gentle with you; and very wrong to say you would\nnever be better, when you know God will give you strength if you pray\nfor it with all your heart; but not if you say wandering prayers, and do\nnot really wish it;” and she looked anxiously at Matilda.\n\n“And cousin Leila?” Matilda inquired.\n\nSelina proceeded. “Yes; Leila I thought was a little wrong to express\nherself so strongly; you know Uncle Howard always says she must try to\ncommand her feelings more,--you are not angry with me, Leila, for saying\nthis?”\n\n“Angry? Oh! no, no. I love you even more when you tell me I have not\ndone right; for I feel that you are so true, and you say it so gently,\njust as my papa does.”\n\n“Well to be sure!” Matilda said; “to _like_ to be told that one is not\ngood, I can never get up to that; I don’t like at all to be told I am\nnot good; I would rather say it of myself than that others should say\nit; indeed, it comforts me sometimes to say it all out. Selina, do you\nknow that at this very moment I am not good?”\n\n“Yes, I do know,--you were glad when I said Leila had been wrong too.”\n\n“And is that all?” Matilda inquired.\n\n“No, not quite all; you were disappointed when you found it was so small\na fault.”\n\n“Oh, Selina! it is too bad in you to say that; you are glad when you\nfind people are good, and like yourself, and I cannot help being rather\nglad also, when I find people a little like myself, though I am not\ngood; but you are getting into a way of seeing me through and through;\nyou must not do that, or you will see a great many things to frighten\nyou; at least, please don’t begin to-day, when we were to have been so\nmerry; but do you know what I think is going to happen; something that\nwon’t make us merry at all,--and yet I shall be so curious to see her.”\n\n“See _whom_?” both the others exclaimed; “what do you mean, Matilda?”\n\n“I mean that we are going to get a governess; that is, that I think,\nperhaps, we are to get one.”\n\n“And why do you think so?” Selina asked.\n\n“Because when I went into the drawing-room with one of the parcels,\n(mamma’s blotting-book, you know,) I heard Uncle Howard say, ‘Yes, I\ncertainly do see the advantage of having a governess; _but_----’ and\nthen I put down the parcel very slowly, that I might hear more; but\nmamma said, ‘Matilda, don’t linger in the room, for we are engaged at\npresent, and wish to be alone.’ So, you know, I was obliged to be off\nvery quick; do you think you will like it Selina?--to be sure, it won’t\nbe so bad for you, but it will be bad enough for poor me, with all my\nscrapes; and yet I should like to see what sort of a face she has got,\nthough I am quite sure I shall not like it.”\n\n“But perhaps the governess is for _me_,” Leila said, in a sorrowful\ntone; then added, “and I shall never be alone with my papa any more.”\n\n“No, no,” Matilda eagerly exclaimed; “don’t vex yourself, Leila. Don’t\nput on that sorrowful face; I am sure the governess is for us; for once\nbefore I heard mamma say something about it to papa,--it was one day\nwhen she said I was unmanageable, and you know you are never\nunmanageable.”\n\n“If you mean that I never am very bad, you are mistaken; you don’t know\nall the things I do sometimes, and wish to do.”\n\n“Well, well,” Matilda answered, “don’t tell me about them, for I don’t\nwant to hear; it is too bad that to-day, when we have no lessons, and\nare so happy to be home again, we do nothing but speak about faults,\nand make each other melancholy. See, the sun is out--it is quite fair\nnow--let us go into the garden and have a nice race.”\n\nLeila’s face brightened. “It will be delightful,” she said, as they all\nthree ran off together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nMatilda’s faults and Leila’s fears seemed alike forgotten. They talked,\nand laughed, and ran races, till fatigue at last made a quieter mode of\namusement desirable, even to Matilda. The arbour, which was in a\nsheltered spot at one end of the garden, was still almost in summer\nbeauty,--the china-roses and many of the autumn flowers were yet in rich\nluxuriance, and the bright beams of the sun brought back the feeling of\nsummer with all its gladness. As they seated themselves in the arbour, a\nrobin flew down from a neighbouring tree, and timidly advanced within\nthe entrance, then paused and seemed to fix its clear bright eye on\nLeila; she softly raised her hand, and pointed to her lips to enjoin\nsilence; but Matilda made a sudden movement, and the next moment the\nrobin was gone. Leila sighed.\n\n“Are you sorry I frightened it away?” Matilda inquired.\n\n“No,” Leila answered, cheerfully; “it was not that; you know the robin\ndid not know us, it would have flown away the moment any of us had\nmoved, and we could not have sat all day quite still; so never mind,\nMatilda, only it made me think----” she stopped and coloured.\n\n“What did it make you think of? Do tell me.”\n\n“It made me think that in the island the birds never were afraid of me;\nthey never flew away, at least a great many of them did not; they knew\nme quite well there.”\n\n“And you are wishing to be back to the island,” Matilda exclaimed,\nreproachfully, “because the birds know you there; and you would leave\nSelina and me, who know you, I am sure, far better than the birds, and\nlove you better too; I am sure I wish that--_that_ island----”\n\nSelina placed her hands before Matilda’s mouth. “Hush, hush, Matilda,\ndon’t say it. You are working yourself up to be angry; you will be sorry\nafterwards; indeed, you will be sorry now;” and she pointed to Leila,\nwho stood covering her face with her hands, while the tears trickled\ndown between her fingers.\n\nMatilda flew to her; she tried to remove her hands, and kissed her\nrepeatedly. “There, you see, I am off again, and worse than ever. Oh,\nthis badness! will it never leave me? and, Cousin Leila, perhaps you\nwill begin to hate me now!”\n\nLeila removed her hands from her face, and hastily brushed away her\ntears; then, throwing her arms round Matilda’s neck, she said,--“Oh,\nMatilda! never, never say that again, for I love you very much.”\n\n“You are so kind and good,” Matilda was beginning to say.\n\nLeila stopped her. “No, Matilda, no; I am not good. I was not crying now\nbecause I was sorry about the island, but because I was angry at you for\nspeaking of it in that way,--and now let me tell you all that is in my\nheart. I am happy here, quite, quite happy; I like living in the world\nexceedingly, I think the world is delightful, and the trials that papa\nspoke about I think are not coming to me, at least, not the great ones;\nfor you know it is a little trial when you are angry with me, and I\nshould bear it better, I know; but it is about the island I wished to\nspeak,--I do not wish to go back to it to live. No, I could not leave--”\nshe fixed her eyes fondly on Selina,--“nor you either, Matilda,” she\nadded; “I could not leave you, I do love you very much, though sometimes\nyou make me angry; but I love the island very much also. God placed me\nthere when he snatched me from the dashing waves. It was my home, my\nhappy home; I had my papa all to myself then; he used to call me his\nlittle friend, and he was such a friend to me, always keeping me right.\nYou know I was alone there with my papa, and with God; and it was so\nmuch easier to be good there. I thought more of God in the island, for\nevery thing seemed so full of his love, and all so beautiful. The island\nwas God’s garden, the flowers always springing, so bright and beautiful,\nthe trees so green, and nobody to take care of them but God; the birds\nalways singing to Him, the fountain making that sweet sound, and the\neverlasting hills.--Oh! Matilda, it was comforting to live amongst God’s\nworks, every thing to make me love Him, and nothing to make me forget;\nhere I am happy, too happy sometimes, for it is a kind of happiness\nwhich makes me forget, and then afterwards comes the sorrow.”\n\n“And what do you do then?” Matilda anxiously inquired.\n\n“I often try to put it off, and I dash about, and try to be merry; but I\nam not merry; I get more sorrowful; then I remember that it is\nconscience that is speaking to me, and that papa says _conscience_ is\nthe voice of God, and if I do not listen, _He_ will turn away from me;\nthen I get frightened as well as sorrowful, and I go away by myself,\nsometimes into my room, sometimes into the garden, and there I\nthink”---- She hesitated, then continued,--“I think of Jesus Christ, and\nof all he did for us, and how he loved little children, and took them in\nhis arms, and blessed them: and I pray to Him in my heart to love me and\nto bless me also. Do you remember how he raised the little daughter of\ntwelve years old from the dead? I always think how good she must have\nbeen after that, and how she must have loved Jesus Christ, and yet it\nshould be the same with us; He keeps us alive every moment, and\npreserves us from every danger, and I forget Him often, though twice he\nhas saved my life, in the stormy sea, you know, and from the\nfrightful----” She stopped and shuddered.\n\n“Don’t, don’t think of it,” Matilda exclaimed; “don’t work yourself up\nin that way, Leila.”\n\n“But it does me good, Matilda, to think of it, and beside it was such a\nday of happiness also,”--and she looked fondly at Selina.\n\n“Yes, yes, I know what you mean,” Matilda said, hastily; “and I am sure\nit was a day of happiness to me too; but we won’t think any more about\nit now, for I do tire a little if you speak too much about goodness; but\nwhat with you being so good, and Selina being so good, I surely shall\nget better in time; indeed, I am a little better already, I assure you\nI am--I am almost always sorry now when I do wrong.”\n\nSelina looked up and smiled. “Yes, indeed, you are better, Matilda. I\nthink there has been a great improvement in you since Leila came to stay\nwith us, and now I hope that you will not take to Lydia Mildmay again so\nmuch, or allow her to have such influence over you as she used to\nhave,--she did you no good.”\n\n“Why do you always say that?” Matilda exclaimed, colouring violently; “I\ndo wish, Selina, you would just tell me at once why you don’t like\nLydia. I am sure it is very ungrateful in you, and I think that you need\nnot be so sorry that she should praise me sometimes, she praises you\nalso a great deal.”\n\n“Yes,” Selina answered, “she does; but I don’t like her praise, and I\nwould rather she did not.”\n\n“And why do you not like her praise?”\n\n“Because I cannot help thinking it is not sincere.”\n\n“Now, Selina, that is too bad in you. Mamma often says, ‘Give me a proof\nof it, Matilda;’ so I say to you, give me a proof of it, Selina.”\n\n“No, I cannot give you a proof of it now; some other time we will talk\nof it again. I wish to go to mamma now--I dare say I can help her to\narrange something--you know there must be a great deal to arrange on\nour first coming home.”\n\n“And let me go with you also,” Leila eagerly said; “for I dare say I\ncould do some good. When we arrived in the cave, I remember I assisted\npapa to arrange a good deal. I unpacked the canteen, and put out all the\ncups and saucers, and helped nurse to arrange the pans, and when papa\nput up the shelves, I put the clothes upon them, and his boots and shoes\nall in a row; but in this country there is not so much to be done; I\nsometimes think it is stupid to have so many people making places for\nevery thing, I used to like so much making plans and contrivances.”\n\n“Well,” Matilda said, “if you are both going to be such busy bees, I\nwill go to Alfred for a little; I see him down the middle walk, and we\ncan romp together; for you know this is to be a holiday, mamma said so;\nso I need not work, unless I like it myself.” She was off in a moment.\n\n“Why,” inquired Leila, as they entered the house together, “would you\nnot give Matilda a proof of why you did not like Lydia?”\n\n“Better not,” Selina answered; “it does not do with Matilda to talk to\nher too much on subjects she does not like; if I had gone on, in a few\nminutes more she would have been angry. Did you not observe how her\ncolour was rising?”\n\n“Yes, I did; and I am never very sure when I am talking to Matilda how\nshe is to take it; she gets red very often,--but I need not wonder at\nthat, for it is just the same with me--I am sure to get red very often\ntoo.”\n\n“Yes,” Selina answered, “you do; you colour very often, but then it is\nnot with anger.”\n\n“You don’t know, Selina; you think that because you love me; but very\noften it is with anger,--not so much when papa tells me I am wrong, for\nhe speaks so gently to me, and always seems so sorry himself, that it\nmakes me very grieved, and I always wish to be better, and say to\nmyself, that I will try never to displease him again; but it is quite\nanother thing with Nurse. I often feel my cheeks get as hot as fire when\nshe scolds me; but it is with anger then; for she sometimes teases the\nvery life out of me. Not often though, for I know she loves me; but then\nshe is always saying, ‘Oh! Miss Leila, you are a heartbreak to me; if\nyou would but sit to your work like a rational being,--you are not to\ntrust to Amy mending your things,--you know your papa says you are not.\nYou are far too much taken up with your music and your histories; and\nwhat sort of a pocket-hole is that for a young lady to have?’ I am\nlaughing now, Selina, while I am telling it to you; but though\nsometimes I can bear it pretty well, and try to please her by beginning\nto mend my pocket-hole as quick as possible, at other times I get quite\ninto a passion, and can’t bear to put in a single stitch; but we must\nmake haste now, or every thing will be put in order, and we shall have\nno work to do. I like that kind of work very much, don’t you, Selina?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nMatilda’s idea, that their having a governess was a point determined on,\nproved more correct than her hasty conclusions generally did. Mr. Howard\nhad been for some time aware that the mode of life which he must pursue\nin England would prevent him giving that undivided attention to Leila\nwhich his island home had afforded him, and which every day was becoming\nmore necessary in the formation of her inquiring mind and impetuous\ncharacter. He felt that Nurse, with all her fond affection, in her\nattempts to rule, was only fostering in his child a spirit of opposition\nand self-will; and that Leila was beginning to think in many things she\nknew better than Nurse, and that she did right to reject counsel, which,\nthough always well intended, was often not judiciously given. Though\nresolved not to yield to the feeling, he had been too long accustomed to\nthe exclusive society of his child, not to be aware that there would be\nmany occasions in which the presence of a third person would prove\nirksome to him, and it was therefore with real gratitude that he\nlistened to Mrs. Stanley’s proposal, that the intended governess should\nreside under their roof, yet still have the joint charge of the cousins.\n“The distance was so short,” she observed, “not two miles, it would only\nbe healthful exercise for Leila to walk when the day was fine, and in\nbad weather she could easily be sent to them in the carriage. She should\ntake care that Leila was always at home to dine with her papa when he\nwas alone, and to read and sing to him in the evenings, as she had been\naccustomed to do.”\n\nWhen Mr. Howard sent for Leila next day to communicate this\nintelligence, she entered his room with an unusually grave expression;\nthe dreaded idea of a governess had been haunting her imagination the\nwhole morning, and gaining strength every minute. She advanced slowly,\nand taking her papa’s hand in hers, she looked up anxiously into his\neyes:--“Is it a governess, papa?” she said, “is it? Oh, tell me quick.”\n\n“My dear child,” Mr. Howard answered, as he stooped down and kissed her\nforehead, “my dear, dear child, what is all this? Why do you look at me\nin this piteous manner? Indeed you must not agitate yourself in this\nway; you must not let your imagination get the better of you; it\ncertainly was on this subject I wished to talk to you; but is the idea\nof a governess so very frightful to you?”\n\n“No, papa; perhaps she is not frightful, but you know I never saw one;\nperhaps she is like other ladies, but then you know she will be always\nthere, always sticking to me; Matilda said something which made me know\nthat; always _sticking_, papa; and then I shall never be alone with you.\nNo more nice chats with your little friend.” Her voice failed, she could\nnot continue.\n\nMr. Howard looked at her anxiously; “Leila, my dear child, you distress\nme; if you allow yourself to get into this way of anticipating imaginary\nevils, you will enervate your mind, and unfit yourself to bear as you\nought to do the real trials of life; remember who says, ‘Sufficient unto\nthe day is the evil thereof.’ Now listen to me; I can see that Matilda\nhas made you aware that you are to have a governess, and all the morning\nyou have probably been working yourself up with the idea of suffering\nfrom what I trust may prove the greatest blessing to you. I cannot now\ndevote my mornings to you as I did in the island; I must frequently be\nabsent, and you are now of an age to require superior instruction to\nthat of your faithful and affectionate nurse; but you will still be my\nlittle friend; in the evenings you will sing and read to me as you used\nto do, and we shall always dine together.”\n\nLeila’s face brightened. “O, what a comfort!” she exclaimed: then added,\n“but I don’t know that I shall be quite comfortable. My governess won’t\nlike dining by herself; she will be melancholy.”\n\n“Now, dear child, you are again running on before the point, though I am\nglad that now it is that you are anxious for your governess’ comfort:\nbut she is not to be exclusively your governess, Leila, and she is not\nto reside at Woodlands. Your aunt has most kindly proposed that you\nshould spend the mornings with your cousins, and be educated with them.\nWe are to breakfast together early as we used to do; when fine, you are\nto walk there immediately after breakfast, or be sent in the carriage\nwhen the weather is bad; and by five o’clock you are to be home to dine\nwith your papa. I give you a general invitation to dinner, Miss Leila\nHoward, and pray give me a favourable answer.”\n\n“Papa, papa, how delightful you are to me,” Leila exclaimed; “all my\nfears, all my sorrows; where are they? You are like the sun to me, papa;\nthe sun chasing away the clouds, and now there is nothing but the blue\nsky and my beautiful governess.”\n\nMr. Howard smiled; “And who told you she was to be beautiful?” he\ninquired.\n\n“Nobody, papa; but I think she will be, and I am sure I shall like her\nso much.”\n\n“I hope indeed that you will like her, my love; for if your aunt\nsucceeds in the application she is about to make, your governess is\nlikely to prove a very estimable person; but I don’t suppose she ever\nwas beautiful, and she can’t be very young now.”\n\nLeila’s countenance fell. “As old as the hills, I reckon,” she\nejaculated, in a very low voice.\n\nBut her papa caught the words: “‘As old as the hills, I _reckon_,’” he\nrepeated; “Leila, from whom have you caught up that phrase?”\n\n“From Peggy Dobie,” she replied.\n\n“From Peggy Dobie; but, my love, have I not told you that I do not wish\nyou to acquire Peggy Dobie’s mode of expressing yourself? I shall regret\nmy promise of allowing Peggy to remove to Woodlands, if you are to adopt\nher phrases, and try to imitate her mode of speaking.”\n\n“But, papa, I promise you I will not, and I dare say our governess would\nnot like me to speak in that way either. I hope she will come to us very\nsoon; how soon do you think, papa? in a few days?--our governess, I\nmean. I know Peggy Dobie cannot be here so soon, or my pets either: how\ndelightful it will be when they all arrive, what a world of happiness it\nwill be then!”\n\n“My dear Leila, I have already told you that I hope this lady, if we\nsucceed in engaging her, may prove a real blessing and advantage to you;\nbut you must not allow your imagination to run away with you in this\nway, or suppose that you are immediately to find her in every way\ndelightful; she is a person who has experienced severe trials; her\nhusband lost a large fortune by the failure of a bank with which he was\nconnected; he died soon after, leaving her and one little girl totally\nunprovided for. Her sister has taken this little girl to be educated\nwith her own children, and Mrs. Roberts has for some time past been\nlooking out for a situation as governess. Your aunt has a high idea of\nher principles, and was much struck by the truly Christian way in which\nshe has borne up under her misfortunes; and having resided several years\nabroad, she speaks both French and Italian with facility, and is besides\nan excellent musician. All this makes her a most desirable person, but\nthe sorrows she has gone through may probably make her graver than you\nmay at first think agreeable; and you must remember, besides, that a\ngoverness has an arduous task to perform, and many difficulties to\ncombat.”\n\n“What difficulties, papa?”\n\n“The difficulties, my love, of having three little girls to correct, to\ncontrol, and to instruct.”\n\nLeila repeated the word _correct_.\n\n“Yes, my love,” Mr. Howard continued, “Mrs. Roberts would be unworthy of\nour confidence, and neglectful of her duty, if she did not correct your\nfaults.”\n\n“But, papa, she would only have two to correct: Selina is quite perfect;\ndon’t you think so, papa?”\n\n“No, my love; I know no one in this world who is perfect, and Selina,\nthough several years older than you are, is still very young, and\nrequires much care and instruction to form her character; but she has\nfewer faults than any other little girl I know--she is indeed singularly\nadmirable; Mrs. Roberts, I have no doubt, will think herself very\nfortunate to have such a pupil.”\n\n“And what will she think about me, papa?” she anxiously inquired.\n\n“Why, she will probably think that she has got rather an impetuous\nlittle woman to manage, one who often allows her imagination to get the\nbetter of her.” But seeing Leila’s downcast face, he added,--“yet I feel\nsure also that she will not be long of loving my little girl, though she\nis not _perfect_; and now Leila,” he continued, “have you any idea of\nwhat is to be done to-day?”\n\n“No, papa, I have no idea. Are we to begin our lessons again? Oh, no! I\nsee you have a plan--I see it in your face. Do tell me: I am sure you\nhave something pleasant to tell.”\n\n“Yes,” Mr. Howard answered, “I think you will like the arrangement for\nthis forenoon. I have just been proposing to your aunt that we should\nvisit Woodlands, that you should see your future home, my child; and we\nhave settled that you young folks are to walk there with Nurse and Amy,\nand I have ordered the open carriage to drive your uncle and aunt; we\nshall probably be there first to receive you.”\n\n“Papa, how delightful! May I run and tell Selina and Matilda the good\nnews? and Alfred, may he go too?”\n\n“Certainly, my love.”\n\n“Well then, I am off--how delightful to have so much to tell; and I may\nspeak about our governess also, papa, may I not?”\n\n“Yes, my love, you may; but your aunt has probably by this time\nmentioned the subject to your cousins; I know she intended doing so this\nmorning.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nWhen Leila entered the school-room Selina was reading, but Matilda stood\ngazing out at the window with rather a disturbed expression of\ncountenance. “Well, Cousin Leila,” she said, “we have news for you, and\nnot very good news either. Now all the day long it will be,--‘Hold up\nyour head, Miss Leila,’ ‘Why do you walk in that awkward way, Miss\nMatilda?’ ‘How troublesome you are; I wish you would take example by\nyour elder sister--one awkward trick after another--I really must\ncomplain of you to Mrs. Stanley.’ Yes, Selina, you need not shake your\nhead at me and look so grave; Leila will look grave also when she knows\nthe truth. Yes, Leila, I was quite right, it is all settled, we are to\nhave a governess; so no more pleasant days for us. Botheration,\nbotheration.”\n\nLeila had not been able to resist laughing at first; but she checked\nherself, and remained silent.\n\nSelina spoke. “Oh, Matilda! how can you speak in this way, and after all\nmamma has been just saying? and you seemed to feel it so.”\n\n“Yes, I know I am wrong; and when mamma was speaking to me I felt very\nsorry, and I resolved I would try to please this Mrs. Roberts, or rather\nmamma, for I would rather please mamma than any one in the whole world;\nbut, Leila, you looked when you came in as if you had something joyful\nto say; if you have, please to say it, for we need good news very much\nto-day.”\n\nBut no sooner had Leila communicated the pleasant intelligence of the\nproposed visit to Woodlands, than all traces of sorrow were banished\nfrom Matilda’s face; she was in ecstasies, and, flying across the room,\nshe dashed the book from Selina’s hands, and throwing her arms round her\nneck, she exclaimed,--“Now no more reading to-day, if you please, _Mrs.\nDemure_; this is what I call the right kind of a holiday--how merry we\nshall be! Well, I do think Uncle Howard makes most delightful plans; how\ndo you manage, Leila, to get him to do so many nice things?”\n\n“I don’t manage,” Leila answered; “he is always thinking of doing kind\nthings to me and every body, and he has told me all about our governess,\nand made me like having one more than I did at first; I will tell you\nabout it as we go along, for we are to walk, you know, and we must make\nhaste and get ready, that papa and uncle and aunt may not be there long\nbefore us.”\n\nThe walk proved every way delightful. The sky so brightly blue, the\nsunshine splendid, and the woods, now tinted with the glowing hues of\nautumn, gave additional beauty to the scene. Here and there a solitary\nunprotected tree, standing out from the others, might have given warning\nto more contemplative minds that winter and its storms were approaching;\nbut there was no winter in their young hearts--all was fresh, gay, and\ngreen, and withered leaves brought to them no memory of blighted hopes,\nand of a world of many sorrows.\n\nThe distance could not be two miles, they all agreed, though Matilda and\nAlfred did their best to lengthen it, by continuing, during every few\nyards of their progress, to run up a little bank by the side of the road\nand down again, assuring the others that it was by far the quickest way\nof getting on, but Leila greatly preferred walking quietly straight\nforward with Selina; it was always a particular pleasure to her to have\nSelina entirely to herself. She now related to her all her papa had told\nher of Mrs. Roberts, and many were the good resolutions made by both,\nthat they would do all they could to make her situation pleasant to her.\nAs they came in sight of a pretty-looking house, standing in a small\ngarden, Leila stopped.\n\n“Look, Selina,” she said, “I think that must be Woodlands, had we not\nbetter ask some one if it is?”\n\nA countryman came up to them at that moment, walking very quickly, and\nwas about to pass on before. Leila ran forward.\n\n“Pray do stop,” she said, “if you are not very busy, and tell us if that\nis Woodlands?”\n\nThe man turned back and looked at her with astonishment.\n\n“Dear heart, young lady, but you must be a stranger in these parts--that\nWoodlands, _that_? It would be but a humble post indeed to open the park\ngates to them good people, a very decent family too, I mean to say\nnothing disrespectful, but Woodlands, bless your heart, Woodlands is one\nof the _principalest_ houses in the whole countryside. Do you see that\nbeautiful great house standing on the height there, with the broad\nterrace and the pleasure-grounds sloping down to the river, and them\ngrand woods on each side, shutting out the summer’s sun and the winter’s\nblasts?--_that’s_ Woodlands, and it’s not every day you will see its\nlike; but you are pleasant-looking young ladies to my mind, and if you\nhave a fancy to see Woodlands, though it’s not to every one I would say\nas much, I have no objections to unlock the gates for you, for once and\naway.”\n\n“And are the gates always locked?” Leila timidly inquired; then added,\n“papa told us to go there.”\n\n“No, no, my young lady; it’s not papas or mammas either that can give\nthat permission. As long as my head’s above ground, there shall no\npromiscuous company enter there; but never vex your sweet heart,” he\ncontinued, more mildly, (observing Leila’s expression of blank dismay,)\n“never vex your heart; you shall see the place for all that;” then added\nwith a sigh, “but Woodlands has gotten a new master, one Squire Howard,\nthey tell me--a fine man from the Indies. Heaven send he may be a kind\none; but they tell queer stories about him too. It was I that showed the\ntwo gentlemen that came to settle about it all over the place, and they\nsaid something of his having lived in a desert island, a Robinson Crusoe\nsort of an affair that I could not make out at all; but if we are to\nhave a master from a desert island, I hope he will keep more company\nabout him than his man Friday, or Woodlands will be a changed place.”\n\n“My papa had no man Friday with him in the island,” Leila meekly\nanswered; “but we do not live there now. We came into the world last\nMay, and our man-servant’s name is John; in the island we had only\nNurse--look, she is coming up to us now, and she is to be my papa’s\nhousekeeper at Woodlands.”\n\nThe ruddy face of the countryman became actually pale, as he pulled off\nhis hat, and stood immovable before Leila.\n\n“My master’s daughter; it’s not possible. Surely----”\n\nMatilda, who from the moment she had joined them, had continued walking\nwith the others, and had hitherto remained wonderfully silent, could now\nno longer restrain herself.\n\n“You may indeed look surprised,” she said, “for you have made a fine\nmistake. Yes, it is quite true: you have all this time been speaking to\nMiss Howard. She is the young mistress of Woodlands. And now will you\nopen the gates?”\n\n“Don’t, Matilda, pray don’t,” Leila exclaimed in a voice of entreaty;\n“do you not see how sorry he looks?” then turning with a smile to the\npoor man, who still remained uncovered before them, “Do put on your\nhat,” she said; “the sun is hurting your eyes, and you need not be the\nleast sorry for what you have said. I dare say you were told to take\ncare of it; that was just the way Nurse used to watch over every thing\nin the island, only there we had no gates to lock.”\n\nIn a few minutes longer they had reached the lodge, a pretty small\nthatched house in the cottage style, with a profusion of China roses and\nhoneysuckles on its white walls. Leila instantly thought how\ndelightfully it would have suited Peggy Dobie, but she did not say so.\nThe gates were no longer shut, they stood most invitingly open; a tidy,\npleasant-looking young woman seemed to have been watching for them at\nthe door of the cottage.\n\n“Oh, Bill, Bill,” she exclaimed, “you have been long, and to have been\naway to-day of all days in the year, and a fine lady and gentleman away\nup the approach in the carriage, and the squire himself, and a kind,\ncivil-spoken gentleman he seems to be.”\n\nBut the young people were too impatient to listen to further details;\nthe moment they entered the gates they bounded forward. The windings of\nthe approach, though calculated to show the finest trees on the\nproperty, they thought much too long, and by the time they reached the\nhouse they were breathless with impatience. Mr. Howard, who had been\nwatching them from the window, was at the door to meet them. “Welcome to\nall of you,” he said, and he stooped down and kissed Leila repeatedly;\n“welcome to your future home, my Leila; may it be a happy home to you,\nmy dearest child.”\n\nLeila seemed at first quite bewildered; the entrance hall seemed to be\nso large, the drawing-room larger _still_. The windows of the\ndrawing-room opened on a trellised balcony, festooned with creeping\nplants, and filled with rare and beautiful flowers; a broad flight of\nsteps, with stone balustrades on each side, and large vases, scarlet\npomegranate and pink oleander in full bloom, led from this balcony to\nthe terrace below; and beyond this terrace the velvet turf, interspersed\nwith beds of gay and fragrant flowers, sloped down to the edge of the\nbroad river, on which many little boats were gliding up and down;\nhappily no steamboat being in sight on this first-favoured moment.\n\nAll were loud in their expressions of admiration; they had never seen\nany thing more beautiful; but though Leila admired, she seemed still\nbewildered, and almost more oppressed than pleased.\n\n“It is very beautiful; but how shall I ever be able to manage such a\nhouse as this?”\n\nSelina whispered, “Don’t distress yourself, Leila, it is not till you\nare grown up that you will have to manage; your papa will do it now, and\nmy mamma will help him.”\n\nLeila brightened a little, but still looked anxiously around the room:\n“Surely it is very large,” she said.\n\nIt was Matilda’s observation, “Young mistress of Woodlands,” that had\ndone all this; poor Leila was weighed down to the ground with a sudden\nsense of her responsibilities; to common observers she was a simple\nchild, young, even for her years; but there was often a deep\nunder-current of thought about her, to be discovered only in the changes\nof her expressive countenance, and in the hesitating, varied tones of\nher voice.\n\nMr. Howard understood her: “We will manage all for you very nicely,” he\nsaid; “so, my dear Leila, do not be afraid; and this room will not look\nso large when it is furnished, and we have sofas, and chairs, and large\ntables, and little tables, and all sorts of pretty things in it; and it\ncertainly will not be too large if we succeed in having all the kind\nfriends around us at Christmas whom I hope we shall have. Your aunt,\nuncle, and cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Herbert, and Maria, and perhaps the\nSelbys, with Louisa, who knows?”\n\nLeila, from the moment of entering the house, had been working herself\nup, and struggling against comfort; but comfort, in the shape of such a\nChristmas party as this, who could resist? She quickly gave herself up\nto all its happy influences, and when her papa led her into the\nadjoining breakfast-room, which was small, and leading into a spacious\nconservatory, she was in ecstasies.\n\n“My birds, my birds,” she exclaimed, “my turtle-doves, my parrots, how\nthey will enjoy it. They will think this more beautiful than their green\nparlour.”\n\nAll was sunshine to her again; it was a moment of exquisite happiness,\nsuch happiness as is only to be felt in very early life, before the sad\nmemories of the past, “and the shadows of coming evils, have dimmed its\nbrightness.”\n\nThe young people returned home in high spirits; Leila forgetting every\ncare in the remembrance of the beautiful conservatory, and in the\nanticipation of the enjoyment of her birds in taking possession of it;\nand Matilda far too much excited to allow any of them to rest, even for\na moment.\n\n“Come,” she said, “we will act a play now;” and flying into the passage,\nshe seized her papa’s hat, placed it on one side on her head, tied over\nher dress a green linen pinafore of Alfred’s to imitate a blouse, and\nreturning into the room, “Now,” she said, “I will be Bill; you, Cousin\nLeila, are to be talking very gravely with Selina, consulting her how\nyou are to order the dinner at Woodlands when I come up to you; and\nyou, Alfred, are to be the pit, and stamp with your feet, and call out\nvery loud.”\n\n“But why,” Leila exclaimed, “should poor Alfred be in the pit? I don’t\nlike that, it puts me in mind of such melancholy things,--Joseph and his\nwicked brothers, you know,--and he called out and they would not listen;\nand the cruel thing we did ourselves; we put the poor goats into the\npit; but papa said that was a necessary evil.”\n\nMatilda laughed: “You are so odd,” she said; “it is not that sort of a\npit at all. I never saw it myself, but Lydia told me about it,--it is a\nplace where all the gentlemen sit in rows to see the play, and they\nstamp very loud with their feet, and call out encore; encore means--say\nit again; don’t forget that, Alfred.”\n\nLeila was quite relieved and satisfied, and the play proceeded; and so\nadmirably did Matilda imitate Bill’s voice and manner, and so complete\nwas the picture when she drew off the hat, and stood with a face of mute\ndismay before them, that Selina and Leila were convulsed with laughter;\nas to little Alfred, he stamped so loud, and called _encore_ so often,\nthat even Matilda, with all her love of amusement, was fairly exhausted.\n\n“Now,” she said, “we have had enough of this; let us play at Nurse’s\nplay now, let us play at being rational beings, and sit down quietly to\nour work; now there’s a proposal for you, Selina, what do you say to\nthat? I am going to turn over an entirely new leaf, and I will begin\nwith putting back this hat into its right place, and folding up this\ncrumpled pinafore so very nicely that Nurse will say it is fresh out of\nthe fold. Now it is all done, and I declare you have got out your work\nalready; well, here is mine, and we can sit down comfortably and\nconverse about our future lives.”\n\n“Yes,” Leila said, “that will be a delightful subject.”\n\n“I don’t know that,” Matilda replied; “you are forgetting about the\ngoverness; she is to be here very soon, if she can come. Mamma wrote to\nher this morning; she bid me hold the taper when she was sealing the\nletter, and I could not help thinking how nice it would be if I could\ngive a little push and set the letter on fire.”\n\n“Oh, Matilda,” Selina exclaimed, “how sorry you make me; why do you talk\nin this way and why should your future life not be happy because we are\nto have a governess to save mamma trouble; you know she is not very\nstrong, and she is not able to manage us herself.”\n\n“To manage _me_, you should say, Selina; but how can my future life be\nhappy, when she will be for ever finding fault with me?”\n\n“But why do you think so? It is quite in your own power to go on happily\nwith her; she will not find fault with you unless you deserve it, and\nsurely you would not wish to grow up in your faults; you could not have\na happy future life if you are not good, for you have a conscience,\nMatilda, and after a little you are always sorry when you do wrong.”\n\n“I am, Selina; you know me very well; but then I am so often bad, and so\noften sorry, that there is no great happiness about my life after all,\neven though I have not a governess. Well, we shall see if she makes this\ngreat change.”\n\n“She cannot make the _change_, Matilda, she can only tell you what is\nright; and you cannot do it either, of yourself. You must pray for the\nSpirit of God to come into your heart, and to make you really sorry for\nyour faults, and really anxious to do what is right.”\n\n“But I am really anxious,” Matilda answered; “and I am always wishing I\ncould be as good as you are.”\n\n“I wish you would not say that so often; I am not good.”\n\n“Oh, if _you_ are not good, and you expect me to be better than you are,\nit is a bad business! I need not try.”\n\n“Why do you talk in that way? You do not know all the foolish things I\nthink of and wish to do; but remember, Matilda, the lesson I have had,\nand the great blessing God has given me. Before I had made up my mind to\nbe always dumb, I used often to pray to Him, and promise that if He\nwould open my lips, I would try to be more and more His child, and\npraise Him with my life as well as with my heart; and when I read of\nJesus Christ opening the eyes of the blind, and making the dumb to\nspeak, I used to have such deep sorrow, that sometimes I could scarcely\nbear it; I used to shut myself up alone and say to myself, Why did I not\nlive then? Surely if I had asked Him myself, and He had seen my sorrow,\nHe would have listened. Oh, it was a sinful thought.”\n\n“But why was it sinful?” Matilda asked.\n\n“It was sinful, because it was doubting His wisdom, for He knew what was\nbest for me; it was also doubting his power, for in heaven He equally\nhears our prayers and sees our sorrows; and the miracles He worked on\nearth are not greater than those which are every where around us. The\nspring and summer coming again, and bringing up the flowers, and making\nthe dead earth so green and beautiful, are miracles of His power; and\nthe very miracle I asked for was granted--granted in a moment--my lips\nwere opened; from that time I made my resolution----” She stopped and\ncoloured.\n\n“What resolution?” Matilda eagerly asked.\n\n“The resolution that I would try to think of Him more than I had ever\ndone before; that I would be part of every day alone, not to ask for\nmore worldly blessings, but to thank Him for giving me more than I ever\ncan deserve.”\n\n“And so this is the reason,” Matilda said, “why you go away in the\nforenoon and lock your door. I never could find out what you were doing;\nonce I thought I would look through the keyhole, and I went on tip-toe,\nbut then I remembered mamma saying that was a mean, low habit, and I did\nnot. But you do another thing, Selina, which you never used to do\nbefore; in the morning, after you have read the Bible, you turn over and\nover the pages, as if you were looking for something. What are you doing\nthen, for you cannot be reading?”\n\n“I am finding out texts. Every day I search for a text, and an answer to\nit, and I get them by heart; it helps to keep good thoughts in my mind\nduring the day.”\n\n“And you never told me a word of all this,” Matilda said, reproachfully;\n“and if you had, it might have made me better, and I could have learned\ntexts also. Why did you not tell me?”\n\nSelina looked distressed, and coloured. “I believe I was wrong, but I\nalways feel ashamed to talk on those subjects before any one; I fear it\nis a false shame.”\n\n“No, Selina, no,” Leila said quickly: “my papa explained to me about\nthat; to be sure, to Matilda or to me you might have said it, for he\ntold me that with a very dear friend it was a delightful subject, but\nthat in the world I must not talk about God as I used to do in the\nisland; I must try to think of Him constantly just the same, and always\nask myself how He would wish me to act, but I must not say so before\nindifferent people (that means worldly people). He says before worldly\npeople it may do harm, for their minds may not be in a good frame at the\nmoment, and it might make them worse, and might make them turn away; and\neven before good people I should not talk in this way, for good people\nmay be shocked, and think it too sacred a subject to be talked of before\nmany; but, Selina, I would like to do all that you have been telling me\nyou do; I would like to find out texts also, and try to keep them in my\nmind, for it is not so easy to be good here as in the island, so many\nnew things come into my mind here. What was the text you found out for\nto-day?”\n\n“It was from the Psalms: ‘Blessed be God which hath not turned away my\nprayer, nor his mercy from me.’”\n\n“And what answer did you find?” Leila inquired.\n\n“My answer was also from the Psalms: ‘I sought the Lord and he heard me,\nand delivered me from all my fears.’”\n\n“And it was an excellent answer,” Leila observed, “and very comforting.\nI am so glad, Selina, you have told me of this plan. I know a great many\ntexts, for you know in the island I had no other book to read but the\nBible, but I never thought of this plan; I wish I had.”\n\nTears stood in Matilda’s eyes: “I do not know the Bible by heart as\nLeila does,” she said; “but you, Selina, will find out a text to suit\nme, and I will learn it,” and she rose and left the room.\n\n“I must go to her,” Selina said; “she is a dear, kind sister to me, and\nalways so sorry when she does wrong.”\n\nLeila was left alone. “Such a happy home preparing for me, and so many\nto love,” she whispered to herself; and clasping her hands together, she\nlooked up for a moment, then left the room to seek her father.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nNearly a month had passed rapidly away: Mr. Howard had been much in\nLondon during the mornings, selecting furniture for Woodlands, and\ngiving many necessary orders for their future comfort; and Mrs. Stanley\nhad been well pleased to find that the joint example of Selina and Leila\nappeared to have a beneficial effect on Matilda; the daily lessons went\non smoothly and well. Matilda now learned her texts regularly, and after\nthe first few days, had always selected them for herself; and these\ntexts generally evinced, not only a knowledge of her own faults, but a\nsincere desire to get the better of them: the text for that morning had\nbeen, “Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:\naccording to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness’ sake, O\nLord.”\n\nAnd the answer she had selected was, “I have blotted out as a thick\ncloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins: return unto me, for I\nhave redeemed thee.”\n\nDuring this period Woodlands had been frequently visited. Leila had\nbecome more and more pleased with the grounds, and the beautiful walks\nwith which it abounded.\n\nMr. Howard had selected a pretty little cottage, near the poultry-yard,\nfor Peggy Dobie, and Leila had had much delight in seeing the China\nroses, and several pretty creepers, trained on its white walls, and the\nlittle garden put in nice order, and well stocked with useful winter\nvegetables. She had asked the gardener to put up a green turf seat in a\nwarm corner of the garden; he had humbly proposed that it should be in\nthe shade, but Leila said no--that Peggy Dobie always sat in the sun\nwhen she watched her bees, and that she said, “The sun was gude baith\nfor bees and bodies, and gladdened her auld heart.”\n\nPeggy had been allowed time to visit her friends before leaving her\ncountry, but the period was now approaching for her arrival, and Leila’s\ngay spirits were in full flow. Selina, the cat, and one solitary parrot,\nhad been poor substitutes for the loss of all the other favourites;\nabove all, the absence of Dash had been particularly felt and mourned\nover. “Now,” she said, “I have but a few days to wait, and I can scarce\ncount up all the pleasures that are coming upon me;--Woodlands, and all\nthe Christmas party, with all the friends that I love; and Dash, and\nPeggy Dobie, and all my birds and turtle-doves again,--joy, nothing but\njoy.”\n\nThe morning in which Peggy Dobie was to embark with her precious cargo\nrose calm and bright. The wind, which had been threatening to rise the\nday before, was completely lulled, and Leila had been rejoicing in the\nbrightness of the day, and had watched the sun go down in golden\nsplendour. Later in the evening, however, the wind began to rise again,\nbut not so as at all to alarm her, and Leila’s tranquil sleep was\nunbroken by the coming storm, the loud howling of the blast amidst the\ntrees, and the sound of distant thunder--it was a fearful night. Mr.\nHoward had more than once left his bed to look out upon the scene of\ndesolation, for the ground was strewed with branches from the trees, and\nthe clouds were driving before the wind with unceasing velocity. It\nrecalled to his mind that dreadful night when he seemed about to part\nwith all most dear to him, and though deeply grateful for the present\nsafety of one so loved, he yet felt painfully anxious for those that\nmight now be in similar circumstances. The good old woman too, whom he\nhad been the means of removing from her quiet home, he thought what\nLeila’s grief would be, and his own regrets, if aught of ill befell\nher. Of all this threatened danger Leila was in ignorance till awakened\nnext morning by Nurse: her face of dismay Leila was too sleepy to\nobserve, but her words were startling.\n\n“Oh, Miss Leila!” she exclaimed, “poor, _poor_ Peggy Dobie, and our\nvaluable Dash, and all the poor dumb animals.”\n\n“What is it, Nurse?” Leila cried, starting up and rubbing her eyes; “are\nthey arrived?--but no; that is not possible; they cannot arrive for two\ndays yet. What has happened? why do you look so? Oh, tell me!”\n\n“Calm yourself, my dear Miss Leila. It was not like my usual prudence to\nfrighten you in this way; but did you not hear the awful wind in the\nnight? listen to it now, how it roars.”\n\nLeila was out of bed in a moment, and gazing from the window. The lawn\nwas strewed with leaves and branches from the trees; one branch lay\nacross the doorway, so very large, it seemed an entire tree. She\nshuddered. Mr. Howard entered the room at this moment, and lifting her\nin his arms, he replaced her in bed, and sat down beside her.\n\nLeila’s long dark eyelashes were wet with tears; her cheeks were very\npale, and she trembled violently. Mr. Howard stooped down and kissed her\nforehead.\n\n“You were wrong to leave your bed, my child, you are very cold--and\ncold also, I fear, from excessive agitation. Now, dear Leila, give me a\nproof this day that you are endeavouring to gain more command over your\nfeelings, and let me see that you do not give way to what are, I trust,\nunnecessary fears.”\n\n“Unnecessary?” she replied, in a low voice. “Papa, do you remember\nClara?”\n\n“Yes, my dear child, I do remember; but I remember also that there is\n_One_ whose arm is mighty to save. He can say to the angry waves, ‘Be\nstill;’ and without his knowledge ‘not a sparrow falls to the ground.’\nHe took Clara to Himself, and He saved us from further trial. He willed\nit so--let us trust to Him entirely. He alone, who knows the end from\nthe beginning, can make all work together for good.”\n\nLeila hastily brushed the tears from her eyes, and laid her little hand\non her papa’s. Mr. Howard started, it was so very cold; but she\nstruggled for composure, and said in a calm voice,----“Yes, papa, I will\ntry to think of all this, and my text for to-day shall be, ‘The waves of\nthe sea are mighty and rage horribly, but yet the Lord who dwelleth on\nhigh is mightier: for He maketh the storm to cease, so that the waves\nthereof are still.’ Now kiss me, papa, and please send Amy to help me to\ndress, and when I have been to your room to say my prayers and to read\nto you, I am sure I shall feel quite comforted again, and you shall see\nthat I am getting command, papa.”\n\nLeila kept her promise. Not a moment did she give way to outward\nemotion, but during that day many an anxious expression passed over her\nsweet face, for the storm continued to rage fearfully, and the party\nwere constantly startled from their seats by the crashing sound of some\nlarge branch from the surrounding trees. These creaking and crashing\nsounds constantly brought a frightful moment to Leila’s imagination, and\nno one was without anxiety, for it was impossible to believe but that\nsuch a storm must bring disastrous consequences to many an anxious\nheart. Selina seldom left Leila’s side for a moment, and made constant\nefforts to draw her into conversation; and Matilda, as every fresh gust\nof wind arose, exerted herself in every way she could think of to\ndistract her attention from the scene without. Later in the day it began\nto rain heavily, and the wind fell, and towards evening the sky cleared,\nand the moon shone out so bright, so calm, its mild rays shed instant\npeace and hope into Leila’s young heart, and she lay down to sleep with\nmany bright anticipations of the morrow.\n\nThe morrow came, the lawn looked fresh and green, all traces of the\nstorm had been removed, and every surrounding object seemed rejoicing\nin the sunshine. Leila proposed that after the lessons they should walk\nwith Nurse and Amy to Woodlands to see if all was in order in Peggy\nDobie’s cottage for her reception in the evening.\n\n“I am sorry,” she said, “that she is not to arrive here at first with my\npets, for we cannot know the very moment, and it will take some time for\nBill to send us the message. How nice it would be if we had a\ncarrier-pigeon, papa, then it could fly to us in a moment; when we are\nstaying at Woodlands, perhaps you will allow me to teach a\ncarrier-pigeon, then I can send letters to Selina and Matilda whenever I\nwish to tell them any thing. Eh, papa? is not this a nice little plan?\nBut you have not answered me yet if we may go to Woodlands.”\n\n“Why, my dear child, so many nice little plans from you come popping\nout, one after another, that it is not easy to answer them all; but I\nhave no objections to your going to Woodlands, only remember, Leila,\nthat it is not at all certain that Peggy will arrive this evening; the\nsteamboat will probably have been detained by the storm.”\n\n“Well, papa, I will try to be very patient; but I don’t think it will be\ndetained; I think that perhaps the wind will have blown it on much\nquicker; so we must be quick also. You know, papa, you say we must not\nanticipate evils, or give way to imaginary fears, eh, papa?”\n\n“Get along, little woman,” was all Mr. Howard’s answer, as he patted her\nhead, and the next moment she was gone.\n\nAs soon as the lessons were over, the young party proceeded merrily on\ntheir way to Woodlands. They soon reached the lodge, and found Bill at\nhis post, who opened the gates, and gave them entrance with the greatest\nalacrity; and when informed of their intention to visit Peggy Dobie’s\ncottage, took down a large key that hung behind his own door, and\nprepared to lead the way. He would not hear of Nurse’s proposal to save\nhim that trouble. “What!” he said, “was he not proud to do that small\nservice for his master’s daughter, or any of her friends--he hoped to do\nmany a greater service than that for the family ere long.”\n\nThey were all much pleased with the perfect order in which they found\nevery thing around the cottage, and still more delighted with all\nwithin. Mr. Howard had indeed done his part; the little bed-room looked\nso comfortable, with its nice tidy bed in one corner, its chest of\ndrawers, its white deal table, with basin, ewer, &c., all, in short, was\ncomplete. And then the kitchen--the kitchen was a picture indeed; there\nstood the pretty chairs, and the small round table of walnut-tree,\nlooking so bright, which Leila had entreated her papa to procure for\nPeggy. In a corner next the latticed window, was a small cupboard with a\nglass door, showing such pretty cups, saucers, and glasses within, as\ncould not fail soon to become the pride of Peggy’s heart. Above the\nsmall dresser there were shelves with plates, and dishes, and bowls, and\nmugs innumerable, and close by the door a cuckoo clock was ticking\ncheerily. They all looked round in perfect ecstasies.\n\n“It is most delightful,” Leila exclaimed; “there is just one thing that\ncould be better, this arm-chair for Peggy should be turned round to the\nhearth, a cat should be lying before it, and a nice fire burning. Were\nyou able to find peats in this country?” she said, turning to Bill; “you\nknow I begged you to try.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” Matilda said, “he did find them--I saw them in a box behind\nthe door.” She was off in a moment, and returned with a couple in her\nhand.\n\n“Now, Nurse, dear Nurse,” Leila said, coaxingly, “do let me light\nPeggy’s first fire myself--you know how very kind she was to me; now\nthere’s a good Nurse, I see you are going to let me--you have your\ngood-natured face on, though you are shaking your head; but I know what\nyou mean by shaking it--you think I shall dirty my hands, and that is\nnot a young lady’s work; but peats don’t dirty the hands--I am only\ngoing to put on peats and wood, you know.”\n\n“Oh, Miss Leila, Miss Leila, you have such a way with me.”\n\n“But, Nurse, you know you say yourself that I should not have useless\nhands and be a fine lady. There, now I see it is yes by your eyes.\nMatilda, give me that match-box from the chimney-piece.” She was on her\nknees on the hearth, and had struck a light in a moment.\n\n“Now, Selina, take the bellows, and blow very gently while I am\ncrumbling down a little of the peat; that’s it. Oh, how nice! See what a\nblaze already--now for the wood; we must put the wood behind, and more\npeats in the front--how it burns! is not this charming?”\n\nBill stood looking on in mute astonishment. “Well,” he said at last,\n“desert island, or _no desert island_, you are a handy little miss; see\nwhen a London young lady would have kindled a fire in such a\nfashion,--but you seem all of one stamp. Heaven be praised for such a\nfamily.”\n\n“There is still one thing wanting,” Leila said, “still the cat. Peggy\nwill not think herself at home without a cat upon the hearth. You are so\ngood-natured,” she continued, looking up in Bill’s face, “perhaps you\nwould be so very kind as to give us your cat, just for one day, till\nPeggy has time to unpack her own.”\n\nBill smiled. “There is nothing in my house that I would not give,” he\nreplied, “to pleasure my young mistress; but, bless your heart, the cats\nin our country would never abide on a strange hearth. Our cat would be\nthrough the window in no time, I am afeared.”\n\n“It was very foolish in me to propose this,” Leila answered, “for I dare\nsay all cats are the same, and our Selina almost mewed her heart out\nwhen she was first put into the ship--she can’t bear strange places\neither.”\n\nOnce more she looked around the room to see if all was perfect; the\nsmall latticed window with the China-roses clustering in about it, she\nwas sure would delight Peggy, for Peggy was so fond of flowers; might\nthey not gather a few and make a nosegay for the middle of the table.\nThe next moment they were all in the little garden--the flowers were\nquickly gathered and arranged, and after giving Bill many injunctions to\nbe so very kind as to step up frequently and put more wood on the fire,\nand also to be quite sure to send off a quick messenger the very moment\nPeggy and the pets entered the gates, they left the cottage.\n\nThey had not time to enter the house at Woodlands, where all with regard\nto furnishing had been going on prosperously, but they had seen what had\nbeen done there more than once. Leila had thought it all beautiful, but\nshe had a simple taste; she really did not like fine things, and her\nonly request with regard to the furnishing had been, “Nothing fine in my\nroom, papa--please, nothing fine; just a nice little bed with white\ndimity curtains, and a large sea-grass mat under my little\nwashhand-stand, for I don’t like to wash and dash and splash on a\nBrussels carpet.”\n\nThe rest of the day passed in pleasant expectation, but towards evening\nthe young people got very restless indeed, and little Alfred was\nperpetually popping out at the door and running a little way down the\ngravel walk, in the hope of meeting some one from Woodlands, and\nbringing the first intelligence; but no carrier-pigeon or swift\nmessenger of any kind arrived; and at a later hour than usual the young\npeople retired to rest, disappointed, but not alarmed. To-morrow was a\nnew day, and to-morrow would bring all they wished. But to-morrow came;\nit was a long trying day of expectation, and still no tidings were\nreceived. It was with great difficulty that they could attend at all to\ntheir lessons; but Mrs. Stanley was very indulgent, and repeated most of\nthem herself; and the moment they were over, she despatched them all to\ncount over their clothes, and to put their drawers in order; to be busy\nand active was what she particularly required of them on that long, long\nday. It came to an end at last, and they went early to bed; but Mr.\nHoward had now become seriously uneasy, and next morning, as soon as\nbreakfast was over, went to London to inquire at the steamboat office if\nthey had received any intelligence with regard to the “Victoria.”\n\nLeila’s face quite brightened as she saw him depart; the very idea that\nhe would bring back intelligence quite raised her spirits; she never for\na moment dreaded that this intelligence might not be favourable.\n\nMr. Howard returned sooner than was expected, but he had learned\nnothing. Neither the Victoria, nor the other steamboat which had sailed\non the same day, had come in, and the owners were in much anxiety, as\nthere were reports of several wrecks on the coast. This last part of the\nintelligence received, Mr. Howard did not communicate to Leila, but he\nlooked anxious, and she knew his face too well not to feel considerable\nalarm. Next day he again went to London. Mrs. Stanley saw it would be\ntoo much to ask any of them to attend to their lessons; Leila was\nbeginning to have a pale, exhausted look, she therefore gave Selina a\nbook of natural history to read to them aloud, while the other two\nworked by the window. Poor Leila, she did not listen much. She worked\nvery little, and looked out a great deal; after some hours horses’ hoofs\nwere heard on the gravel walk; she saw her papa alight at the door; her\nheart beat violently; she felt unable to move; he looked up and smiled;\nshe could not read that smile; it was sweet as usual, for when was his\nsmile ever otherwise when it rested on her? But it was a melancholy\nsmile. He entered the room, they all clustered round him.\n\n“The Victoria has come in,” he said.\n\nLeila clapped her hands. “My pets, my pets,” she cried; “and Dash, and\nPeggy Dobie--all--ALL safe!”\n\n“Dear child,” Mr. Howard continued, looking anxiously at her, “dear\nchild, your pets are safe, but Dash and Peggy--” he stopped.\n\n“What of them, papa? Oh tell me, tell me quick--why do you look so\ngrieved?”\n\nMr. Howard drew her towards him. “Try to calm yourself, my beloved\nchild, for you have much to bear. Peggy and Dash are not in the\nVictoria; they have not been seen since the night of the storm.”\n\n“But how is that possible, papa? It cannot be, they were in the\nship--oh, yes they were. I cannot understand what you mean. I am not\nvery frightened; say it all out quick.”\n\nMr. Howard then went on to say that he had not been able to see the\ncaptain, and had got but a confused account from two of the sailors, but\nthat both agreed in the same story. The storm had been most fearful;\nthey had anchored that dreadful night off Scarborough, but with little\nhope of being able to keep their anchor. They expected every moment to\nbe driven on the shore. The passengers in the fore cabin were too much\nfrightened to keep below as they were advised and entreated to do. A\nheavy sea had swept the deck, and several of them were swept overboard.\nPeggy, with Dash by her side, had been seen on deck the moment before by\nboth these sailors. The night was frightfully dark, the sea running\nmountain high; to save any of them was impossible. Next morning both\nPeggy and Dash were amongst those missing.\n\nLeila for a moment did not utter a word, she grew deadly pale, then\nthrowing her arms round her papa’s neck, she cried, “Lost to me, lost to\nme for ever! Oh, poor Peggy, and my dear, dear Dash--my dearest\nfriend--” but seeing her papa’s look of distress, she stopped, then\ncontinued, “I am wrong, very, very wrong; I am vexing you. Peggy herself\nsaid, if the dearest was left, if she had him to love and him to listen\nto--and have I not you, papa, and are you not my dearest one, and so\nmany besides to love?” and she drew Selina towards her, and with her\npocket-handkerchief she wiped Selina’s eyes, then went on, “and it is\nbad in me to be so sorry for Dash--for poor Peggy is a human being--but\nDash, my own Dash, and twice he saved my life.” She covered her face\nwith her hands and sobbed violently.\n\nMr. Howard did not attempt to console her or to stop her tears; he\nlifted her gently in his arms, and laying her on the sofa, sat down\nbeside her, clasping her hand in his.\n\nAfter some time she became more calm; she lifted his hand to her lips\nand kissed it, then shutting her eyes she in a few minutes dropped\nasleep; it was but a troubled sleep, but all were thankful that it had\nbrought forgetfulness for the present. After some time she awoke with a\nsudden start, slowly she remembered all. Sad memories they were which\nclouded her sweet face, and tears again filled her eyes, but brushing\nthem hastily away, she said, in a low voice, “The great trial has come\nto me at last, and I must bear it, but God will help me.” Then rising\nfrom the sofa she slowly left the room.\n\nMatilda sprang up to follow her, but Selina held her back, and whispered\nin her ear, “You had better not, Matilda: I am sure Leila has gone to\nher own room to pray.”\n\nAnxious to see the captain of the Victoria, and if possible to obtain\nmore intelligence, Mr. Howard, on the following morning, again went to\nLondon, but to his disappointment found that the vessel had sailed on\nher downward passage a few hours before. A gentleman came into the\noffice while he was there to inquire for one of his trunks which was\nmissing, and Mr. Howard found he had been a passenger in the Victoria.\nHe said he had been much at sea, but had only once before been out in a\nsimilar storm; that their escape had been most providential, as several\nvessels near them had been driven on shore. The frightful accident which\nhad taken place had thrown a heavy gloom on all; their being unable to\nrender any assistance had been heart-rending; it was a moment, he said,\nhe never could forget, but the darkness of the night and the violence of\nthe storm had rendered all attempts impossible. Not half an hour after\nthe wind had fallen in some degree for a short time, and a boat had put\noff from the shore; some of the passengers had taken advantage of this,\nand had left the vessel; but it seemed to him as if no boat could live\nin such a sea, and he had, after some hesitation, resolved to abide by\nthe ship.\n\nLeila listened in breathless agitation. “And Peggy, papa, and Dash? did\nhe say nothing of them?”\n\n“He spoke of Dash, my love, with much regret; he said he was a most\nnoble animal. He seemed not to be aware to whom it belonged.”\n\nLeila sighed heavily. “A most noble animal; yes, he was noble, every\nbody loved Dash.” Then taking her papa’s hand, she looked anxiously up\nin his face, and said, “Dash could swim so well; do you think, papa,\nthere is any----” She stopped.\n\n“Any hope, you would say, my love; I fear, Leila, we must not trust to\nit, but the same idea struck me, and before I left town I wrote an\nadvertisement, fully describing Dash, and giving our address; and this I\nsent to the ‘Times’ newspaper office.”\n\n“Oh, thank you, thank you, dear papa,” and she hastily walked to the\nwindow and looked out. She was determined not again to give way.\n\nLeila’s naturally buoyant spirits did not long remain much depressed;\nstill the sudden shock, after all her bright anticipations, had been so\ngreat, that it left evident traces in her appearance, and when any\naccidental circumstance recalled the late events, a pang of such acute\nsorrow shot through her frame as it greatly pained Mr. Howard to\nwitness, and he was not sorry that neither Mr. and Mrs. Herbert nor the\nSelbys had accepted his invitation for Christmas; the Selbys had a\nfamily party that day, and the Herberts were on a tour of visits; both\nparties, however, promised to be at Woodlands soon after Christmas, and\nMr. Herbert added, that if Mr. Howard would allow him, he would be glad\nto introduce to him his son, who would be at home for the holidays.\nChristmas-day, therefore, would be spent in a manner more congenial to\nthe tone of their present feelings; and Mr. Howard arranged that they\nshould not remove to Woodlands till a few days before, when Leila could\nhave the comfort of having her uncle and aunt and her cousins with her.\n\nThe meeting with her pets again had been very trying to Leila, and still\nmore so was her first visit to Peggy Dobie’s cottage; Susan, Bill’s\nwife, had been employed to take charge of her pets for the present, till\nsome one could be found to fill the situation, and the cottage had\ncontinued locked up. Matilda had in vain tried to dissuade Leila from\nmaking this visit, but she said she felt sure she would feel better when\nit was over, and she thought of it so much; and Selina seemed to be of\nthe same opinion. It appeared as yesterday when she had been there\nbefore, but with what different feelings! there stood the glass with the\nwithered flowers, on the little table, and the wood-ashes lay cold upon\nthe hearth. Leila gazed earnestly on every object which before had given\nher such delight; the tears ran silently down her cheeks, there was no\nviolent emotion. She turned Peggy’s own chair from the hearth, and\nplaced it against the wall, then left the cottage followed by Selina and\nMatilda. She was certainly better after all this was over, yet there\nwere feelings which did not soon leave her; she could not help\nremembering, with self-accusation, that her papa had only yielded to\nPeggy’s removal to England in consequence of her entreaties; he had at\nfirst represented to her that at Peggy’s time of life it were wiser to\nleave her in her own country, and probably more for her happiness to do\nso; but Leila had been carried away too much by her own wishes in this\ninstance to practise the lesson of self-sacrifice which her papa so\noften inculcated; she now felt this deeply, and it was a lesson not lost\nupon her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe day had now arrived when Mrs. Roberts was expected; the young people\nwere all assembled in the school-room busy with their different tasks;\nSelina and Leila were seated silently at their writing-desks,\ntranslating English into French; Alfred quietly in a corner, drawing\nbirds and animals on a slate, his favourite employment. Matilda alone\nwas restless and unquiet; she kept constantly running from the table to\nthe window, holding a book of French dialogues in her hand, and looking\nout on the approach, while she rhymed the same phrase over and over\nagain: “Il faudra faire comme nous pourrons, il faudra faire comme nous\npourrons, il faudra faire comme nous pourrons; now surely this is\nknocked into my brains.”\n\nSelina shook her head.\n\n“Well, Selina,” she continued, “you need not shake your head; il faudra\nfaire comme nous pourrons, and I am sure I am doing the best I can.”\n\n“Are you?” Selina quickly said, and went on with her writing.\n\n“How provoking you are, Selina; there do you two sit as quietly as if\nnothing were going to happen, and as if Mrs. Roberts might not arrive\nevery moment.”\n\n“But will running to the window and shaking the whole room make her come\nany sooner?” Selina inquired.\n\n“To be sure it will, that is, I shall see her sooner. Alfred, do run\ndown and listen if you hear a carriage,” and she snatched the slate from\nhis hand; “there’s a good boy, run down and do like Fine-ear, you know;\nstoop down and put your ear to the ground, there’s a man,” and she\npushed him out at the door.\n\nAlfred returned again almost immediately. “I could not play at fine-ear,\nMatilda,” he said, “for I saw the carriage at a little distance the\nmoment I went out; listen, it is stopping at the door now.”\n\nAll the three young girls jumped up and ran instantly to the window. The\nsteps of the carriage were let down, a ladylike person, rather slender,\nand rather above the middle height, stepped out, her bonnet entirely\nconcealing her face. Mr. Stanley came forward, he seemed to welcome her\nkindly; they entered the house together. The next moment they heard the\ndrawing-room door close. Matilda glided from the room.\n\nSelina looked anxiously after her; in a few minutes she returned.\n\n“I have seen her trunks,” she said; “I don’t like them.”\n\nSelina looked distressed.\n\n“Well, Selina, why do you put on that sorrowful face? I did not say I\ndid not like her. Come, cheer up, I will do the best I can.”\n\nThe drawing-room bell rang; in a few minutes Amy tapped at the\nschool-room door to say the young ladies were wanted in the\ndrawing-room. They all went down.\n\nMrs. Roberts seemed talking earnestly to their mamma when they entered;\nbut she stopped, and as Mrs. Stanley introduced them, said a few kind\nwords to each. Her face was not pretty till she smiled; her smile was\nvery pleasing, and her voice was low and sweet. Leila felt she should\nlike her; both she and Selina, when addressed, said something in return,\nand probably just what they ought to say, though no one heard it;\nMatilda said nothing. Almost immediately after Mrs. Stanley told them\nthey might return to the school-room, that Mrs. Roberts was probably a\nlittle tired with her journey, but if she felt inclined by and by for a\nwalk, they might join them in the garden.\n\nIt was all over in a moment. “Well,” Matilda exclaimed, as they entered\nthe school-room again, “how do you like her?”\n\nBoth answered, “Very much, we like her very much.”\n\n“Very much,” Matilda repeated; “well, I don’t. I don’t like her at all.”\n\n“And why, Matilda? why do you not like her?” Selina anxiously inquired.\n\n“I don’t like her nose.”\n\n“Don’t like her nose!”\n\n“No, I don’t; she has a pinched nose, and don’t you see it droops?”\n\nSelina saw that at this moment it was a hopeless case; she did not even\nattempt the vindication of the nose.\n\nMrs. Stanley was not disappointed in her expectations with regard to\nMrs. Roberts; she proved to be a highly principled, amiable,\naccomplished woman, and with a gentle steadiness about her which\npeculiarly fitted her for the task she had undertaken. With Selina and\nLeila she had comparatively little trouble, and they soon became fond of\nher, and anxious to give her satisfaction, but with Matilda she had a\nfar more difficult task; besides having strong prejudices to combat, she\nhad to struggle not only with careless inattentive habits, but often\nwith an obstinate determination not to overcome them, for Matilda’s\ngoodness as yet only came by fits and starts; there was no very steady\nimprovement, and the arrival of Mrs. Roberts seemed rather to have\nthrown her back. She had fancied that she would not like her, and she\nseemed too often to have a wish to act up to the opinion she had formed.\nMrs. Roberts’ patience with her was wonderful; indifferent observers\nmight have fancied that Matilda was her favourite; she spoke more to her\nthan to the others, often conversing cheerfully with her on interesting\nsubjects, and trying to draw out her feelings and sentiments; and\nMatilda, though she gave her much trouble, was not quite insensible to\nthis. There were times when she acknowledged that Mrs. Roberts was\nrather a kind person, though her nose did droop.\n\nThe removal to Woodlands now took place, and the following morning Mrs.\nRoberts granted a holiday to the young people, that every room in the\nhouse might be visited and properly admired, and also that Leila might\nhave time to settle with Susan as to a convenient arrangement for\nseveral of her pets, while, with the assistance of her cousins, she hung\nthe cages with the parrots and the smaller birds up in the conservatory.\nShe had for some time been bringing up a pair of turtle-doves as a gift\nto Mina, and teaching a young parrot to speak, which she intended for\nLouisa. The turtle-doves were now at a very interesting age, just\nbeginning to be independent, and to coo to each other in a most\nmelodious manner, and the parrot gave proof of fine abilities, and could\nalready say, “I am Louisa’s pretty bird.”\n\nThe house was most comfortably though simply furnished; but the\nconservatory delighted Leila more than any part of it: the flowers so\nfragrant, so bright and beautiful, and the birds so happy, they were\nalready singing in the branches. Once more she walked about amongst the\nbirds and flowers, and felt that but for one sad thought she would not\nhave had a wish ungratified. She quite longed to give her papa an\naccount of all her arrangements, and went in search of him. She found\nMr. Howard reading in his library, but he answered her little tap at his\ndoor with his usual kind voice.\n\n“Come in, I think I know who is there; what have you got to tell me,\nlove?” and the book was thrown aside, and she, seated on a low stool at\nhis knee, kept looking up in his face, and pouring out her little\nhistory, he entering into all her arrangements with all the attention\nand satisfaction her heart could desire. “And now, papa,” she continued,\n“you know I am of a great age now, I am eleven, and I want to talk to\nyou a little about my responsibilities.”\n\n“Your responsibilities, my love!--that is a very fine word for you;\nwhere did you pick up that word, Leila?”\n\n“I think it is a very nice word, papa, and I understand it; and you must\nknow I have responsibilities in my new home, for I heard Aunt Stanley\nsay to Mrs. Roberts the other day, that Miss Palmer had gone now to keep\nher father’s house, and would have many responsibilities; that besides\nthe regulating the house, and attending in every way to his comfort, she\nwould also have the school to attend to, and the poor people to visit,\nand it was a large parish. I could not find out what a large parish\nmeant, but I understood all the rest; and don’t you think, papa, I\nshould have a school, also, and visit the poor people?”\n\n“No, dear Leila; I think you are too young to have a school at present;\nbut don’t look so disappointed, my love; let us talk this matter over\nquietly. Miss Palmer is a great many years older than you are, she is a\ngrown-up young lady, and it is quite right that she should in every way\nimitate her excellent mother’s example, and endeavour to make up as much\nas lies in her power for the loss they have sustained in Mrs. Palmer’s\ndeath: but you, my love, are still a child, and requiring too much\ninstruction yourself to be able to instruct others; yet you, dear\nLeila, also have your responsibilities.”\n\n“I am so glad of that papa,”--and her countenance brightened again.\n\n“Yes,” Mr. Howard continued, “you are responsible for the talents God\nhas entrusted to you, for the employment of your time, for the\ncultivation of the abilities He has given you; for the use you make of\nthe religious instruction you receive in correcting your faults; you are\nby nature ardent and impetuous, you must struggle for the mastery over\nyourself; for more self-denial, in rejecting the sudden impulses by\nwhich you are governed; you must try to check that excessive sensibility\nwhich, if indulged in, must unfit you for the necessary exertion for the\nwelfare of others which is so high a duty, and without which you would\nsoon become a useless, selfish being--turning away from the misery of\nothers, from the fear of what you yourself must feel in witnessing it.”\n\n“But, papa, if I am not to teach a school or visit the poor, and only to\ncultivate abilities, is not that turning away from others, is not that\nbeing selfish?”\n\n“But, my dear Leila, it is by no means my wish that you should turn away\nfrom others; though you are as yet too young to teach a school yourself,\nyou are not too young to accompany your Aunt Stanley when she goes to\nvisit the school, in which she takes so much interest. Selina often\naccompanies her; I shall ask her to allow you to do so also; and in this\nway you will become acquainted with the duties you will, I trust, one\nday fulfil yourself. You will, also, accompany me in visiting the poor;\nyou have now a weekly allowance, which, though not much, will still\nenable you, by practising self-denial in some of your own desires, to\nsave a little each week for the benefit of others: with this you can\nsometimes buy materials which may be useful to poor children; and by\nemploying some part of your time in making them up, you can bestow a\ndouble benefit; for remember, Leila, it is not real charity to give of\nyour superfluity only.”\n\n“I know it, papa; I know that you are thinking now of the rich man\nthrowing into the treasury, and the widow’s mite, and I will try to be\nthe widow’s mite. Am I staying too long, papa?” she continued; “must I\ngo now? perhaps you wish to have your book again?”\n\n“No, my dear child, I am in no hurry to resume my book; I am quite\npleased to have a little talk with you; besides, if I had not heard your\nlittle tap at the door just then, I meant to have sent for you--I have\ngot something to show you.”\n\n“To show me, papa?”\n\n“Yes, my love; something which will interest you, but will also bring to\nyour mind sorrowful recollections.”\n\nLeila looked up anxiously in her papa’s face. “Is it about Dash?” she\nsaid; “has any one answered the advertisement? or Peggy?--but no, about\nPeggy, that is impossible; poor Peggy!”\n\nMr. Howard smiled mournfully as he answered. “No, my child, I have heard\nnothing of them.”\n\nLeila continued: “I have tried to bear it, papa, and not to give way;\nand I have prayed to God, and He has strengthened me, and often I feel\nquite comforted, sometimes I feel quite happy, just as if it had never\nbeen; but often when I am talking and laughing I am not really happy--I\nam only pretending, for Selina and Matilda always look so distressed\nwhen I am sorrowful; but night is the worst--I always think of Peggy at\nnight;--and how kind she was to me; and there is nobody to be made\nsorrowful then, and so I often cry very much; but I won’t talk of it any\nmore, and I am forgetting you had something to show me;” and she hastily\nbrushed the tears from her eyes.\n\nHer papa carefully unfolded a small paper which he took from his\npocket-book, and showed Leila a very few small seeds.\n\n“Flower-seeds?” she asked, inquiringly; “are they not, papa?”\n\n“Yes, my love, they are the seeds of Clara’s flower.”\n\nShe started. “Of Clara’s flowers! Who has been to visit her lonely\ngrave? Who, papa?”\n\n“No, one, my love; I gathered those seeds the day we left the island;\nbut I did not mention it to you, because I thought I had lost them, and\nthat they had dropped from my pocket-book. This morning I found that\nthis paper had fallen within another, and that the seeds were still\nthere; there are only seven of them, but I don’t think there ever were\nmore, for I remember I had difficulty in finding even these.”\n\nLeila gazed at them earnestly. “I also tried to find seeds that day, and\ncould get none--how interesting they will be to me. I will plant them\ninstantly, and when they spring up, I will have some of Clara’s flower\nto give to her mamma.”\n\n“But, my dear Leila,” Mr. Howard said, “had you not better wait till\nspring? I fear this is not a good time to sow flower-seeds;” but seeing\nher look of distress, he added,--“at least, it would be more prudent to\nsow only part now, and the others in spring, this will give you the best\nchance of securing some of the plants.”\n\n“Well, papa, I will do that, and three I think will be prudent;” and\nselecting three of the seeds, she folded them into another paper. “You\nhad better keep these, papa, that I may not be tempted; and I will go\nnow to the gardener--he is very good-natured--he will give me a\nflower-pot and the proper earth, and I will plant them this moment and\nput them into the conservatory. In the conservatory it will be the same\nfor them as in the island, for it is always so warm there; so you see,\npapa, I am very prudent about them, for I did not mean to put them out\nin the cold. Every day I shall watch for their coming up. You could not\nhave given me any thing, papa, so very interesting to me--I will come\nback and tell you when they are planted;” and she darted off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nOld David, who had been many years at Woodlands, was indeed very\ngood-natured, and from the day when Leila had evinced so much anxiety to\nhave poor Peggy’s garden put in nice order, had taken quite a fancy to\nhis young mistress. He stood over her while she sprinkled the earth\ngently upon the seeds, having given her a flower-pot of the proper size\nto put them in, and he seemed much interested as to their coming up, but\ncould give no positive opinion when that event might take place. “Some\nvery small seeds,” he remarked, “came up very quickly, while others of\nequal size required to lie in the ground a long time; he would not\ndespair,” he said, “though they did not make their appearance for a\nmonth; besides, who could tell what might be the nature of flower-seeds\nfrom that outlandish country,” for Leila had told him they came from the\nisland, though he had no idea of the other circumstances which made them\nso precious in her\n\n\neyes. The residence of the squire on a desert island had for some time\npast been a favourite subject of discussion both in David’s cottage and\nat the lodge, and the wonderful histories related by Nurse had been\nlistened to with the most profound attention and astonishment, and had\nserved to throw a sort of romantic interest around both Mr. Howard and\nhis child. Old David had remarked, “that it was easy to see their young\nmistress was something by common, something sae gleesome, and springing\nabout her as if her foot had been used to the hill-side and the heather\nbrae. She remembered him muckle of the highland lassies of his own dear\ncountry; for though he had been long enough in England to have forgotten\nhis Scotch tongue, (and the more the pity,) yet he had not been long\nenough to forget their ways, and he was still a highlander in his heart,\nevery inch of him.”\n\nBut to return to Leila. She had just completed sowing the precious seeds\nwhen Alfred ran into the conservatory.\n\n“I cannot find Selina,” he said; “but, Cousin Leila, you are always so\ngood-natured, perhaps you will go with me to Mrs. Roberts,--I have done\na cruel thing, though I did not mean to be cruel, and I would like to\nhave some one with me when I tell it.”\n\nLeila, having placed the flower-pot in what David pronounced to be the\nmost favoured spot in the conservatory, proceeded immediately with\nAlfred to seek Mrs. Roberts. They found Selina and Matilda with her.\n\n“Mrs. Roberts,” Alfred began, in a hesitating manner, as they entered\nthe room, “you told me not to be cruel, and I promised, and indeed I was\nnot cruel; but I have brought the body to you to see if you can bring it\nalive again;” and he placed a little bit of paper, crumpled up, before\nMrs. Roberts.\n\nMatilda jumped up. “What is the boy saying? the _body_! what body?” and\nshe was about to seize the paper, but Alfred spread his hands over it.\n\n“Matilda, you are not to touch that paper,” Mrs. Roberts said gently;\nand, turning to Alfred, she continued,--“and now, my little man, compose\nyourself, and tell me distinctly what has happened.”\n\nAlfred then proceeded to say that he had been playing in the garden, and\non lifting up a stone, a number of spiders had run out from below it,\nthat one was very large and beautifully spotted, that he did not mean to\nkill it or even to catch it, only to touch it very gently with his\nfinger; but on his doing so, immediately all its legs fell off, and it\ndropped down dead; that he instantly looked for its legs, but could not\nsee them, they had quite melted away. And Alfred was so overcome by the\nrecital of this sad catastrophe, that he dissolved into tears.\n\n“Crying for such a thing as that?” Matilda exclaimed; “foolish Alfred.”\n\n“But, Matilda, it had eight legs.”\n\n“And so,” Matilda continued, “because its eight legs melted away you\nmust melt away also. Take care, Alfred, we shall be looking for _you_\nnext on the carpet, and not be able to find you.”\n\nAlfred now did not know whether to laugh or cry, but unfolding the\npaper, he carefully laid before Mrs. Roberts what appeared to be a very\nsmall, shapeless particle of brown earth--it certainly had no\nresemblance to a spider.\n\n“That is the body,” he said, in a mysterious whisper, intended only for\nthe ears of Mrs. Roberts; “and now,” he continued aloud, “do you think I\ncan do any thing to revive it? If I were to put it into a cup of warm\nwater, perhaps----”\n\nMatilda laughed. “Perhaps its legs would grow on again, you mean. Well,\nAlfred, this certainly would be a wonderful water-cure; you should set\nup an establishment and call it the warm water-cure for making legs and\narms grow on again. You would make a fortune; for I heard mamma say the\nother day, that this seemed to be the age for believing in every sort of\nwonderful cure that could be invented, the more improbable the better.”\n\n“How you run on, Matilda,” Mrs. Roberts said; “you should be aware\nAlfred cannot enter into all this sort of thing--you forget the\ndifference of age between you;” then turning to Alfred, she\ncontinued,--“No, Alfred, it would not do to put this spider into water.\nThis is what is called a wolf-spider, and were you to put it into warm\nwater, you would certainly kill it; at present I do not think it is\ndead.”\n\nAlfred’s countenance brightened.\n\nMrs. Roberts continued,--“Give me that sheet of white paper.” She placed\nthe paper on a small work-table in a sunny corner of the room, and laid\nthe spider upon it.\n\n“Now keep quiet, all of you,” she said, “and we shall see what it does.”\nIn a few minutes the spider unfolded its legs, and running across the\npaper to the edge of the table, it shot out a slender thread from its\nbody, by which it swiftly descended to the ground.\n\nAlfred clapped his hands, exclaiming,--“Alive, and I did not kill it,\nand it has got all its legs again; how very wonderful! But where did the\nthread come from by which it got down so very quick? Mrs. Roberts, do\ntell me!”\n\n“It spun the thread from a sort of gluey substance which is contained in\nthe flasks in its body. Each spider has four of those flasks or bags of\ngum, and from each tube communicates with what is called its spinneret,\nand with the gluey substance which passes through these tubes, it spins\nits thread with these spinnerets; it is very wonderful, but too\ndifficult for you to understand at present. That thread which appeared\nto you so fine is composed of many finer threads, which make it\nstronger; just as in cords of equal thickness, those which are composed\nof many smaller ones united are greatly stronger than those which are\nspun at once; but where has the spider gone to now, Alfred? Yes, I see\nit; don’t touch it;” and Mrs. Roberts took a cup in which she carefully\ncaught the spider without touching it, and having placed this cup in a\nsaucer full of water, she desired them to watch its further proceedings.\nThe spider ran repeatedly to the brim of the cup descending on the other\nside, but was always stopped by the water which surrounded it. Sadly\nperplexed by this unexpected obstacle, after having ran round and round\nby the edge of the water several times, it stood still, and raised its\ntwo fore-legs in the air.\n\n“It is trying,” Mrs. Roberts said, “to ascertain from which side there\nis a current of air to carry its thread to some object to support it,\nthe opposite rim of the saucer, for instance.”\n\n“Oh, how very curious!” they all exclaimed. But this world of waters\nseemed quite overwhelming to the poor spider, who could feel no current\nof air, and it was returning hopelessly into the cup when Mrs. Roberts\nsaid,--“Now you shall see it throw its little silken bridge across, and\nget free from this sad imprisonment;” and she blew very gently in the\ndesired direction.\n\nThe spider instantly descended again to the edge of the water, and shot\nout a thread, which it fixed to the cup at one end, while the other end\nfloating in the air, also became fixed to the brim of the saucer. It\nfirst pulled this thread with its fore-feet, as if to ascertain its\nstrength, then passed swiftly along it, spinning another floating thread\nas it went, lest the first should not be sufficiently secure to ensure\nits safety, and arriving safely on the brim of the saucer, descended the\nother side, and once more scampered off.\n\n“Well done, you clever creature,” Matilda exclaimed; “how I wish I could\nsometimes escape from the school-room as cleverly.”\n\nLeila glanced towards Mrs. Roberts half afraid.\n\nBut Mrs. Roberts only smiled. “You are a sad girl, Matilda,” she said;\n“there is much folly bound up in your little heart, but I don’t despair\nof you; the time will come, and I trust ere long, when you will not find\nthe school-room such an imprisonment.”\n\nMatilda looked gratefully at Mrs. Roberts, and sudden in all her\nimpulses, she jumped up, and kissed her hand; then turning round, she\nsaid,--“But, Leila, you have expressed no surprise at all those\nwonderful things! I do believe you knew about them before, though you\ndid not say a word.”\n\n“Yes,” Leila answered, quietly; “papa told me a good deal about spiders\nin the island.”\n\n“Out with it, then,” Matilda said, impatiently; “do, Leila, tell us\nevery thing you know; how odd you are; when I know any thing I am dying\nto tell it. What more did your papa say about them?”\n\n“He showed me a water-spider, sailing in its curious little raft, and\nwatching for its prey; and a mason-spider, living in a beautiful nest,\nlined with a sort of orange-coloured silk, which it had spun itself, and\nwith a little door to its nest with a spring hinge, which shuts of\nitself when the spider goes in. And he did a curious thing about the\neggs of the wolf-spider; he took away the bag of eggs, and then the\nlittle spider carried off the bag belonging to the large spider; and\nthey had such a fight about it.”\n\n“Oh! do tell us more about that,” Matilda said, eagerly. “I should like\nso to hear about the fight; and so the little spider carried off the bag\nof eggs belonging to the big spider--that was most excellent!”\n\n“And most just,” Selina observed.\n\n“Now, Selina, that is so like you; how can you expect a spider to have a\nsense of justice, and it is natural for spiders to fight, I dare say;\nindeed it is natural for other people also sometimes, and just because\nthey have a sense of justice. But, Leila, do tell us all about it.”\n\nLeila coloured; “Mrs. Roberts could explain it much better,” she said.\n\n“No, my dear, I don’t think I could; you will do it more simply, because\nyou will tell only what you understand yourself; but stay, did you not\nsay, Alfred, that you saw a great many spiders under the stones in the\ngarden? perhaps, Leila, you might find some with a bag of eggs--take\nthis tumbler to catch them in--bring two, if you can find them, a larger\nand a smaller, and put this paper over the glass, that they may not\nescape. Matilda, I see you are eager to go also--you may accompany\nLeila; but allow her to catch the spiders--great care must be taken not\nto injure the bags.”\n\nThey were off in a moment, and soon returned with two spiders in the\ntumbler.\n\n“Now we shall see it all,” Matilda said, “you can’t think how cleverly\nLeila caught them; she is an excellent spider hunter. Now, Leila, begin;\ndo try to make them fight.”\n\nLeila lifted the smaller of the two spiders very gently, and took up a\nneedle.\n\n“Stop, stop,” Matilda exclaimed; “are you going to stick a needle in its\nbody? I don’t want to see that.”\n\n“No, no,” Leila answered; “don’t be afraid; I am only going to take off\nthe bag, and the bag is not a part of its body, though it looks like\nit--it will easily come off; the spider glues it on, and it can easily\ndo so again, after we have seen them fight.”\n\nShe then very dexterously disengaged the bag of eggs without breaking\nit, and put it on the table. The spider, instead of running away, as it\notherwise would have done, showed the greatest anxiety to regain it. She\nslowly wandered over every corner of the table, crawling over books,\nwork-boxes, &c., &c., as if in search of something; then, having at last\ndiscovered the lost bag behind Selina’s work-box, she suddenly made a\nrush towards it, and having seized it with her upper pair of jaws, she\nran off with it, carrying it as a cat often does its kitten.\n\n“O look!” Matilda exclaimed, “she is stopping behind your writing-desk,\nLeila; she thinks she has got into a cunning hole, where no one will see\nher--what is she about now?--she is pushing the bag between her legs,\nand I do believe she is glueing it in--yes, indeed, for there she is\nscampering off again, and with her bag just as it was before; she will\nbe off the table in a moment.”\n\nBut Leila caught the spider, and taking the bag from her again, she put\nher under the tumbler where the larger spider was:--“Now,” she said, “if\nthey are the same as the spiders in the island, she will fancy the bag\nof eggs of the other spider to be her own, and she will fight for it;”\nand hardly had she spoken, when both spiders were struggling and\nfighting violently for the possession of the bag--they reared themselves\nup, extending their front legs in a threatening attitude, and showing\ntheir angry feelings in the most evident manner. In the struggle the\nother bag of eggs became detached from the larger spider, and the little\none, after making the most violent efforts to seize it, finally\nsucceeded; the larger spider having rolled over, the other one scampered\noff with the bag, and Leila having raised the tumbler to permit its\nescape, it was presently again on the table--it passed its own bag of\neggs on its way to the window, but took no notice, seemingly quite\nsatisfied with its stolen treasure. The other spider was now also set at\nliberty, and having, after running about some time, discovered the other\nbag of eggs, it was making a dart towards it, when Mrs. Roberts took the\nbag up, and having pricked it with a needle, instantly a multitude of\nyoung ones ran out, and climbing up on the old spider, almost covered\nher--she remained quite still, apparently overwhelmed (as well she might\nbe) with the burden of such a family.\n\n“Poor thing!” Selina observed; “she will never be able to manage so many\nlittle ones.”\n\n“Oh, she will get a governess,” Matilda said; “and I only hope she may\nget as good a one as Mrs. Roberts.”\n\nMrs. Roberts shook her head but could not help being amused:--“You are\nan odd girl, Matilda,” she replied; “but you had better take the spider\ndown into the garden again, it will be more likely to find a governess\nthere, who will understand the nature of the charge.” She gently lifted\nthe spider, placed it in the glass, and gave it to Matilda--then added,\n“You will be the better, all of you, for a little fresh air in the\ngarden: I have a letter to write, which has been too long delayed, but I\nshall join you there as soon as I have finished.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nChristmas had now passed: on the morning of that day they had all\nattended church, then walked to a pretty, small village on the property,\nto visit several of the cottagers; Mr. Howard having, the day before,\nsent money and a supply of blankets and of coats to those that required\nsuch assistance. In the evening a mutual exchange of gifts took place at\nWoodlands, which greatly interested the young people; but the day was on\nthe whole a trying one to Leila; she had not regained her former\nspirits, and it seemed as if those particular days to which she had\nlooked forward with the most pleasure, seemed still more to recall the\nmemory of her late trial. A short time after Christmas, the expected\nparty assembled at Woodlands. The Selbys were the first to arrive.\nCaptain Selby was delighted to see again his little fairy queen, as he\ncalled Leila. Louisa seemed improved, taller, and with more animation of\nmanner; and the meeting between Leila and her was most affectionate on\nboth sides. Louisa was soon taken to the conservatory, followed by\nSelina and Matilda; Louisa stealing many a look at Selina, who had long\nbeen a subject of much interest to her, though not unmixed with dread,\nlest she should too entirely usurp her former place with Leila; but the\nkind reception she met with greatly reassured her. She struggled with\nher natural timidity, and Matilda did much to establish something like\nease between the parties: she eagerly introduced Louisa to all her\nformer favourites amongst the pets; and seemed most anxious to draw her\nattention to one of the parrots in particular.\n\n“How this one must have grown,” Louisa observed; “I scarcely remember\nit: what a pretty bird!”\n\nThe parrot instantly flew to the side of its cage, exclaiming, “I am\nLouisa’s pretty bird, take me home--pray take me home!”\n\nMatilda clapped her hands. “That is just what I wanted it to do--yes, it\nis for you; Leila has taught it to say that--it is to be your parrot.”\n\nLouisa was still holding Leila’s hand, and trying to thank her, when\nLeila was called away. The Herberts had arrived. She found Mina eagerly\nwatching for her at the drawing-room door, all her usual shyness having\ngiven way before the interest of the moment. The meeting between them\nwas of the most affectionate nature; but no one till that moment had\nsuspected the depth of feeling with which Leila had looked forward to\nseeing Mrs. Herbert again. “Mamma, mamma!” she exclaimed, as clasped in\nMrs. Herbert’s arms, she hid her face on her shoulder, and struggled to\nretain her tears. Mrs. Herbert was much affected, and no real mother\ncould have more fondly returned her caresses; but seeing the struggle\nLeila was making to restrain her emotion, she called her son Charles to\nher side, and putting Leila’s hand in his, she said with a cheerful\nvoice,--\n\n“I must not forget my dear child has also a brother to receive, who\nlongs to know her.”\n\nBut Leila was disappointed; Charles was not such as she had expected to\nhave seen, and looking up in his face she said hastily, “You are too\ntall to be my brother.”\n\nThe bright, sparkling look of pleasure with which he had approached to\nmeet her, faded before this reception; he too was disappointed, but he\nonly said with much gentleness, “That is a fault I cannot change; I can\nonly try to make you forget it.”\n\nAnd he did manage to do so in a wonderfully short space of time, for he\nhad a good deal to overcome. Leila had expected to have seen a little\nboy such as Alfred, and had been thinking a great deal of her little\nbrother, and how she would watch over him, and keep him out of scrapes;\nshe was quite bewildered when she saw before her a youth apparently\nabout sixteen, and it was not in the first moments of disappointment,\nthat his slight graceful figure, his beaming countenance, and deep blue\neyes, so full of sweetness and animation, had any charm for her; but\nbefore the day was over she had told Mina in strict confidence, that she\ndid not think Charles nearly so tall as she had done at first, and that\nshe did not know why it was, but she was not half so frightened for him\nas she expected she would have been; and the pleasant surprise of next\nmorning still further promoted intimacy between them. Leila was called\nto the window by Selina to admire a beautiful small Arabian pony, which\nCharles was leading up the approach towards the house; the side-saddle\nand embroidered saddle-cloth seemed to say it was intended for a lady’s\nuse; and what was Leila’s astonishment and delight, when she found it\nwas a present from Mr. and Mrs. Herbert to herself; the beautiful\nsaddle-cloth the work of Mrs. Herbert and Mina. Leila had no words to\nexpress what she felt; for to learn to ride, to have a pony of her own,\nto accompany her papa in his rides, had long been the earnest wish of\nher heart. Charles was immediately constituted riding-master to the\nwhole of the young party; a busy time he had, and with strict\nimpartiality did he fulfil his appointed duty; one point of difference\nonly did he insist on, he particularly requested that Leila alone was to\nspeak to the pony and caress it, and it was only to be from her hand it\nwas to receive a piece of bread on the commencement of its daily\nlabours, and also at their close. Selina had communicated to Charles the\nsad story of Peggy Dobie and the faithful Dash; of all Leila had\nsuffered, and was still suffering, from their loss; and he felt that\ncould she become attached to a new object, it might in some degree\ninterest her mind: but though Leila soon became fond of her pretty\nSelim, no new favourite could fill Dash’s place to her; _he_ could never\nbe forgotten.\n\nMany days passed pleasantly away, varied by rides, and walks, and\nreading aloud. In the evening there generally was music. Mrs. Herbert\nhad a fine voice, which had been much cultivated, and Charles and Mina\ndid great credit to her instructions; the young people thought there\ncould be nothing more beautiful than the trios Charles and Mina sang\nwith their mamma Mrs. Herbert had proposed to have a singing class, and\nto instruct the whole group; but Leila alone had become her pupil.\nLouisa had very little genius for music; so little, that her mamma did\nnot wish her to give much time to its cultivation. Selina had been\nforbidden to attempt singing for some years, her voice, even in\nspeaking, being still weak; and Matilda, Mrs. Stanley said, was, from\nher habits of inattention, too far back in more necessary studies to be\nallowed this indulgence.\n\nLeila made considerable progress; from her having practised the guitar\nso much during her residence on the island, she had acquired rather\nunusual proficiency on that instrument, and her voice and taste being\nnaturally good, Mrs. Herbert found her both a willing and a successful\npupil. Matilda had often entreated her mamma to allow her also to learn\nthe guitar, for Matilda was ever eager for something new, always sure\nthat what she had no knowledge of would be much more easily acquired\nthan that which she was then studying; but Mrs. Stanley had always\nsteadily refused this request, though, at the same time, assuring\nMatilda that, as soon as by steady and continued application, she had\nmade that progress in her other studies which her years and natural good\nabilities admitted of, she should have every indulgence in the\ncultivation of her musical taste. It had been quite a trial to Matilda\nwhen first told that she was not to be allowed to take advantage of Mrs.\nHerbert’s kind offer of instruction; and her temper had been on the\npoint of giving way, but a look of entreaty from Selina had arrested the\nangry words upon her lips; she had hastily quitted the room, and in a\nvery few minutes had returned with all her usual liveliness and\ngood-humour.\n\nMrs. Herbert had considerably regained her health and spirits, and with\nthe tranquil gentleness of past sorrow there was a warmth of affection\nand winning sweetness of manner which each day endeared her more and\nmore to Leila, who never was happier than when, with her own transparent\nopenness of character, she was pouring all her thoughts, feelings, and\nwishes into Mrs. Herbert’s willing ear.\n\n“I have never told you,” she said one morning, as they sat alone\ntogether, (she on a low stool looking up into Mrs. Herbert’s face,) “I\nhave never told you how very sorry I was afterwards for having made that\nrude speech to Charles when I first saw him; but I was so very much\ndisappointed, I could not help saying it; I had been thinking so much of\nhaving a little brother, and of how kind I should be to him, and how he\nwould grow up to love me. And when I saw that tall Charles, I could\nscarcely keep from crying, for since my great trial of poor Peggy Dobie,\nand my dear, dear Dash, I don’t know why it is, but so often I am ready\nto cry when any thing like another trial comes to me--but this has not\nturned out a trial after all.”\n\n“So you are getting reconciled then, my love, to Charles being tall, and\ndon’t wish so much now that you had a little brother rather?”\n\n“No, indeed I don’t--I like it much better; for Charles is so kind, and\ntakes such care of me, and he is so fond of Mina; he is an excellent\nbrother; and don’t you think he is an excellent son too? He often looks\nat you just as I do at my papa. I am sure he is thinking then that you\nnever can know how much he loves you. I dare say Charles never does any\nthing very wrong; only a little wrong, I suppose, for papa always says\nno one is quite perfect.”\n\nMrs. Herbert smiled. “No, my dear Leila, I do not say Charles is by any\nmeans perfect; he has faults, still I may say that he is one who has\nnever yet given us cause for serious uneasiness.\"\n\n“I was sure of that,” Leila answered, “for he always looks as if he\ncould not bear to vex any one; I often wish to ask him to forgive me for\nwhat I said: but I don’t know why, I often feel a little shy with\nCharles, though I like so much to talk to him. I hope it will go off in\ntime, for I should like to be able to tell him every thing I think, just\nas I do to you; if he had been a little boy I would not have cared to do\nthis, I would only have said little things to make him laugh and to\namuse him; so, as Nurse always says, every thing in this world turns out\nfor the best, if we would only remember this, and not fret. But,” she\ncontinued, “when I said just now that I told you every thing, I forgot\nthat there is one thing I cannot tell you.”\n\n“And what is that?” Mrs. Herbert inquired. “Why should you be afraid to\ntell me every thing?”\n\n“I am not afraid,” Leila answered; “but it is not the right time yet to\ntell. Perhaps I shall be disappointed myself, and then I need not tell\nyou, for it would only make you sorry; but if it comes up it is for you.\nNow I must go to the conservatory; I go there every morning alone, but\ndon’t ask me why I go.”\n\nLeila stood in the conservatory, earnestly contemplating a flower-pot\nshe held in her hand, till startled by a voice behind her.\n\n“How now, lady bright, gazing on brown earth, and so many beautiful\nblooming flowers around you?”\n\nShe looked up; it was Charles who had entered the conservatory\nunobserved, and was bending over her shoulder.\n\n“Oh, Charles,” she said, “I am so happy, so very happy; so thankful.”\n\n“Thankful,” he replied; “thankful for small things indeed, for I can see\nnothing.”\n\n“Nothing! look again, Charles; only look here--don’t you see?”\n\n“No, I see nothing, and unluckily I have not got my spectacles at hand.”\nBut observing Leila’s heightened colour, and the expression of her face,\nhe added in quite a different tone, “Yes, I do see two tiny little green\nleaves just peeping above the brown earth; but they will require all\nyour tender care to rear them. Why are they so precious to you, Leila?\nBut do not tell me if you would rather not.”\n\nShe lifted her eyes to his face. “Yes, I should like to tell you--” she\nhesitated, then continued in an agitated voice, “it is seeds from the\nflower I planted on Clara’s grave, and perhaps more will spring.”\n\nCharles’s colour mounted to his forehead; he took her hand. “Oh, Leila,”\nhe said, “dear Leila, how I have longed for this moment, how I have\nwished you to talk to me of Clara. Clara, my own sweet sister, my lost\nClara; I seem to see her still, how lovely she was!”\n\n“You knew her then,” Leila said eagerly; “you remember her; but\nhow--were you not in England?”\n\n“No; from our being up the country and in a good climate, I was nearly\nten years old before it was thought necessary to send me to England;\nnever can I forget the first time I saw Clara. I was taken into the room\nwhere mamma was lying on her bed, so pale, so beautiful, only the\nslightest tinge of colour in her cheek. Clara and Mina lay on each side\nof her; she took my hand, a bright flush came into her face for a\nmoment, ‘My little son,’ she said, ‘may God watch over you and preserve\nyou to be a protector to your sisters; if these dear ones live to be\nsent home to England, you will be already there. Promise me that when\nyou are together, you will watch over them, and always endeavour by your\nown example to teach them to love and serve their heavenly Father. May\nyou never, dear Charles, forget this moment; may my earnest request be\nalways remembered, when you yourself are tempted to do what is wrong.”\n\n“And were you sent away from them immediately?” Leila inquired. “How\nmelancholy this must have been for you!”\n\n“Oh no, not immediately; Clara and Mina were three years old before I\nleft India. They could talk and run about. In the cool season I used to\nmake them run races in the garden with each other. They often laughed so\nat my constantly mistaking one for the other, for I never could\ndistinguish them, till mamma put a small gold chain round Clara’s neck.”\n\n“Was it this?” Leila said, as she took a chain from the folds of her\ndress, and gave it into his hand.\n\n“Yes, the very same; but there was no locket suspended from it.”\n\nLeila touched the spring, it opened.\n\n“My own mamma,” he said, “and how beautiful! and those laughing\neyes--yes, I remember how she used to look in that way, when she was\nplaying with us all. And this was Clara’s locket--my own dear sister,\nand now, alas! only one remains to me.”\n\nLeila coloured. “Then you will not have me for a sister,” she said, in a\nlow-toned voice.\n\nCharles’s countenance brightened, as in his usual lively manner he said,\n“I thought I was too tall to be your brother.”\n\n“Oh, don’t, don’t say that,” Leila exclaimed; “you don’t know how sorry\nI was afterwards, and how often I have wished to ask you to forgive me.\nWill you?” and she put her hand into his. “Yes, I see you will, I see it\nin your eyes. I always know when people are loving me again by their\neyes.” Selina’s voice was heard calling her; she ran off, but returned\nfor a moment to say, “Do not tell mamma about the seeds; it is to be a\nsurprise to her. I have planted four, and if more spring, I should like\nso much to give you one also.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nTo pay frequent visits to the village had of late been a great interest\nto the young people; they had become acquainted with many of the\ncottagers, and Leila had already begun to have a lively interest in\ntheir children. As the party were now to leave Woodlands in a few days,\nshe proposed one morning that, as the weather was uncommonly fine, they\nshould cross the fields, under Charles’s escort, and pay a sort of\nfarewell visit to some of the cottagers. The cold had been so severe in\nthe night, that the grass still felt crisp under their feet, though the\nsunbeams glanced brightly on the scarlet berries of the holly, and on\nthe slender branches of the forest trees, feathered white by the\nhoar-frost. At the village they were welcomed by old and young, for the\nkind, frank manners of the young people had made them general\nfavourites; many of the children ran forward to meet them, but they\nmissed one little girl whom they had in former visits particularly\ndistinguished. Her mother’s cottage stood at the end of the village,\nand they found Dame Burton standing at her door, looking anxiously in\nthe direction of the road. She invited them as usual to enter, but\nadded, “I am rather out of sorts, young ladies, at this moment, for I am\nfearing my little Lizzy is getting into idle ways. Not a sight can I see\nof her, all the other children in the village home from the school, and\nshe still loitering on the road. If I had not had the dinner to get\nready, I would have been off to seek her myself, and would have sent her\nhome in a hurry; but her father will be in to his dinner, and she will\nget it from him I am thinking.”\n\nLeila instantly proposed that they should return by the road; “As\nCharles is with us, I don’t think papa will be displeased,” she said,\n“and we can tell him why.” Then turning to Dame Burton, she added, “We\nshall be sure of meeting your little Lizzy if we go by the road, and we\nshall send her home to you very quick; but I hope you won’t be angry\nwith her this time, for you know when it is an interesting play\nsometimes one forgets. I forget very often myself, though I am so much\nolder than Lizzy.”\n\nThe young people proceeded on their way, talking and laughing merrily;\nCharles protesting “that if they met the little truant, the unworthy\nlittle Lizzy, he would send her home in a hurry; he would give it her,\nher father’s anger would be a joke to his.”\n\nLeila looked up in his face in astonishment.\n\n“Never mind him,” Mina exclaimed, observing Leila’s face of perplexity;\n“never mind him--don’t believe a word of it, he’s only saying it in fun;\nCharles is not the least bit ill-natured. If we meet Lizzy I know the\nsort of thing he will do, he will tap her kindly on the back, and say,\n‘Now there’s a good girl, run home as quick as you can.’ That’s the sort\nof way he will scold.”\n\n“Is it, my little wise sister?” Charles replied, laughing. “Well, well,\nyou will soon see the contrary; you don’t know what an angry man I can\nbe; Leila has never yet seen me in one of my right towering passions, it\nwill frighten her out of her wits.”\n\n“How merry we all are,” Mina said, “and how happy we have all been, and\nnow in three more days it will all be over!”\n\n“Oh, Mina!” Louisa exclaimed, “do not speak of it; I have been thinking\nof it all the time, though I have been trying to laugh. I have never\nbeen so happy before, and now I may never see you all again. You will\nall be meeting often, but I shall be far away. You know in two months\nwe are going abroad. I used to like the thoughts of it so much; now I\ncannot bear it. And you, Leila, you will be growing up, and so many to\nlove you, you will forget me.”\n\n“Never, Louisa, never; you were my first friend, you will always----”\nShe was interrupted at this moment by the loud screams of a child; they\nseemed to proceed from a lane, which, a few yards further on, branched\noff from the road. The screams were continued with increased violence.\nThey caught sight of a little girl struggling to get free from a large\ndog, which seemed dragging her along by her clothes.\n\nLeila sprang forward. “Don’t be frightened, Lizzy, don’t; we shall\nprotect you.”\n\nAt the sound of her voice the dog let go its hold with a joyful bark of\nrecognition, and the next moment was leaping upon Leila with frantic\njoy.\n\n“Dash, my own Dash!” she cried, as throwing her arms round his neck, she\nalmost stifled the faithful animal with her caresses. “But how is this?\nIs it my Dash? is it really true? how did it happen? Lizzy, what is the\nmeaning of this? how did he come here? where did you find him? Oh! tell\nme; but how thin you are, my Dash; how changed--oh, he has been\nstarved! how dreadful! But, Lizzy, run home to your mother; don’t delay\na moment longer--she is sorry you have been so long away; and let us get\nhome also as quick as we can, that we may get food for my dear Dash.\nWhat joyful news for papa, and for Nurse, and Amy. Poor Peggy! Oh, if\nDash could speak!” She turned to regain the road, but Dash would not\nallow this; he began to pull Leila up the lane by her clothes, in the\nsame way he had been doing to the little girl.\n\n“Don’t oppose him,” Charles said; “there is something under all this, we\nhad better follow as he leads.” They quickened their pace, but saw\nnothing. Dash now frequently ran on a little way before them, returned\nagain and took hold of Leila’s dress as before, looking up in her face,\nas if encouraging her to go on. A sudden thought seized her; she darted\nforwards--she ran on a considerable way--suddenly she saw a figure lying\nstretched on a bank by the side of the lane; in the next moment she was\nkneeling by Peggy Dobie’s side!\n\nThe others came up. They found Leila clasping Peggy’s hands and sobbing\nviolently.\n\n“Her eyes are shut,” she said; “she does not hear me; oh, Charles, tell\nme, is she dead? Can we do nothing?”\n\nDash began at this moment to lick Peggy’s face, she opened her eyes.\n“Am I dreaming,” she said, in a low faint voice, “and am I still in the\nland of the living? surely it is the faces of my own dear bairns that I\nsee; but it canna be. Na, na, it is a vision o’ the night, and it will\nleave me with the light o’ morning as it has ever done afore; but it’s\nmorning now. Where am I? how has all this come about? oh! for a drop o’\nwater and a morsel o’----” Her eyes closed again--the momentary exertion\nwas too much.\n\nCharles, who had been rubbing her cold hands, sprang to his feet. “It is\nfood she requires,” he said; “she is starving. I see a house near, I\nwill be back in a moment.”\n\nHe flew off. He returned, followed by the farmer to whom the house\nbelonged. Charles held a bowl of milk to Peggy’s lips--she seemed unable\nto swallow.\n\n“No, no, mister, that won’t do; this is a bad job; there has been both\ncold and hunger here; it’s brandy she must have, and that instantly.\nHeaven grant it may not be too late; I have my doubts.”\n\n“No,” Leila cried, “don’t say it; we have found her again--she must not\ndie!”\n\nBut the farmer was gone. He returned again in a few minutes with the\nbrandy and a thick blanket. With Charles’s assistance he poured a little\nbrandy and water down Peggy’s throat, and wrapped her in the warm\nblanket. “These poor thin rags,” he said, “are not for such cold as\nthis, the poor creature is half frozen; but she is coming about again,\nher lips are not just so white; she will do yet; and, by good luck, I\nsee one of my carts coming from the field; we shall have her into it and\nhome in a jiffy. Hollo, there! Joe, my man, here’s a bye-job for you.”\n\nPeggy was lifted into the cart, Selina and Leila also getting in and\nsupporting her in their arms. It was in vain Charles insisted on taking\nthis office on himself, they would not hear of it; it seemed as if it\nwere quite necessary for them to hold Peggy fast, as well as see her, to\nconvince them that the scene before them was not a joyful dream. But\nDash also appeared resolved to make one of the party in the cart--he\nleaped in, stretched himself on Peggy’s feet, and to move him was\nimpossible.\n\n“Let him lie there, he will do much good,” the farmer said; “he is a\nwise animal, and I am thinking it is to his good offices that there is\nthe breath of life in this poor creature. Where is she bound for, young\nladies?”\n\n“To Woodlands,” Leila answered.\n\nThe cart proceeded, followed by the others; when they arrived at the\nlodge, Bill’s astonishment was great, and his joy also, when he heard\nthe wonderful news, for he had taken the greatest interest in Leila’s\ndistress; he called instantly to Susan to accompany them, and taking the\nkey, which was still in his charge, they took their way to Peggy’s\ncottage, Charles having been sent on to the house to request the\nattendance of Nurse. “Her papa,” Leila said, “had gone to London with\nher Aunt Stanley; but Nurse, she was sure, would be of great use, and\nmight bring with her whatever she thought necessary for Peggy,” who\nstill remained in a state of stupor.\n\nThe fire was kindled, and Peggy laid upon her bed when Nurse arrived,\nwho, after giving her a small portion of nourishment, stood by the\nbed-side holding her hand and gazing anxiously upon her.\n\n“How wonderful are the ways of Providence,” she said. “To think of Peggy\nbeing restored to us again, she that we mourned as sleeping under the\nsalt wave!”\n\nPeggy opened her eyes. “And wherefore did ye pit me there?” she said,\nwith a faint smile. “Na, na, it was nae just sae bad as that, though\nit’s been out o’ perils by sea and perils by land that the Lord has\ndelivered me, praise be to His holy name; but, oh! it’s a deliverance\npast my weak comprehension, I canna make it out; but it’s all His\nblessed work, and it’s a reality--it’s no’ a dream.”\n\n“No, Peggy, it’s not a dream,” Matilda said, eagerly. “See, we are all\naround you, and now Cousin Leila will be happy again, and merry as she\nwas before.”\n\n“And did the dear bairn grieve sae for me? Oh! what it is to hear the\nvoices of ye all again, and to see your faces glinting down on me like\nthe blessed sunbeams on my withered heart; it was for this I prayed and\nfor this I toiled, as my puir blistered feet can testify; but it is a\nstrength that I have nought to do with that has brought me to see this\nday; and now that the life seems in me again, in a measure, I would fain\nken where I am. Is it your house, Mistress Nurse, that they have brought\nme to, and I making sae free, lying in your ain bed, wi’ thae bonnie\ngenty white curtains, and all sae clean and comfortable about me, and\nnever sae much as a word o’ thanks? you will think I hae left my manners\nin the sea--but we will no speak o’ that awfu’ element.”\n\n“But, Peggy,” Selina whispered, “it’s not Nurse’s house--it is your own;\nand Cousin Leila told her papa every thing she thought you would like.”\n\n“Yes,” Matilda added, “and there are peats in a box behind the door;\nand you have not seen the kitchen yet, with the walnut-tree table, and\ncupboard, and the cuckoo clock--all is for you--it is your own house.”\n\n“My own house,” Peggy repeated, as clasping her hands together in deep\nemotion, she added, “O what am I, that such blessings should be showered\nupon me, when He whom I serve ‘had not where to lay His head!’ O my\nbairns! help me to praise Him, who has brought me out o’ much\ntribulation, for my mind’s weak and head sair confused. Could you no’\ntak’ the book--it’s the Psalms o’ David that could speak weel for me at\nsic a moment.”\n\n“No, Peggy,” Nurse said; “that must not be: God looks to the heart. He\nknows all your gratitude to Him--but you are more exhausted than I ever\nsaw mortal being, and it’s peace and quietness you want; you must try to\nsleep, and the young ladies will be gude bairns, (as you call them,) and\ngo quietly home--they will come to see you again to-morrow, when you\nwill be more able to speak to them of your mercies, for, surely, it has\nbeen a great deliverance.”\n\n“And may I not stay with Peggy?” Leila said.\n\n“No, Miss Leila, no; Peggy will be better alone with me; and as she will\nrequire a little nourishment now and then, and it will need my\nexperience to know how much, I will watch by her till the evening; I am\nsure my master will spare me on such an occasion; and you may say, that\nif it is his pleasure to allow Amy to step down when I leave, and stay\nthis first night with Peggy, I think it is all she will require.”\n\nOn the young people getting up to take leave, a painful struggle took\nplace in Dash’s upright mind, and for some moments he stood irresolute.\nBetween the dear young companion of his palmy days and the friend of\nlate misfortunes the line of duty was difficult to discern;--but this\nfriend was no longer perishing with hunger and cold, she was now in the\nland of plenty and almost smothered with blankets; so Dash wagged his\ntail to Peggy and darted after Leila. It was not easy to say which was\nmost light of foot, as they bounded along--Dash capering and frisking in\nrenewed health and spirits, and Leila as if she trod on air, so\nimpatient was she to tell all to her papa; but Mr. Howard was already in\npossession of the joyful intelligence, as immediately on his return from\nLondon, he had been informed by Charles of all that had taken place, and\nof Nurse having been sent for, and they now met both on their way to\nPeggy’s cottage; but on hearing Leila’s account, Mr. Howard thought it\nbetter to delay his visit till the next morning, and retraced his steps\nwith the rest of the party.\n\nAs they entered the house, Leila lingered behind for a moment.\n“Charles,” she whispered, in an agitated voice, “if you had not told us\nto follow Dash, Peggy would have died. Charles, if you had been a little\nboy, you would not have said that.” The bright colour which before had\nanimated her face had faded, she was pale and trembling; Charles was\nalarmed.\n\n“You are ill, Leila!” he exclaimed; “the agitation of all this has been\ntoo much for you.”\n\n“No, I am not ill,” she said quickly; “but I must go to papa.” She\npassed him hastily, and entered the library. Mr. Howard looked up--her\nappearance alarmed him.\n\n“Has any thing happened?” he inquired; “Leila, my child, why are you so\npale?”\n\nLeila threw herself into her papa’s arms. “Nothing more has happened,\npapa; but I don’t know what is the matter with me; it is joy--but it is\ntoo much happiness--how can I ever thank God enough for all that He has\ndone for me!--He has given me so many blessings. He sent me the trial,\nbut He has taken it away from me again, and gives me more than ever\njoy--tenfold joy, papa--what can I say to Him--what can I do?--surely, I\nam most ungrateful--my heart is very full, but I feel as if I could do\nnothing.”\n\n“You can give your heart more entirely, my love, to Him, who has given\nso much for you; you can think of Him, love Him, walk with Him, and make\nHim more and more to you an all-sufficient Saviour.”\n\n“But, papa, what frightens me is this; I have more blessings here than I\nhad in the island--friends, and beautiful rooms, and fortune, and every\nthing I could wish for--but it does not make me give my heart more to\nGod. I used to think of God more in the island, when I saw His beautiful\nworld all around me; here it is beautiful also, but so many pleasures,\nand so many people to love, take up my heart; perhaps it would be better\nfor me if I had trials.”\n\n“My dear Leila, you must beware of the error of believing, that were\nyour situation different, you would be better than you are now; the\nfault is in yourself, not in the circumstances which surround you. You\nthink it would be better for you if you had trials; you have a trial at\nthis very moment--the trial of prosperity, and it has often been found\nmore difficult to bear than the heaviest misfortunes. Remember the words\nof your blessed Saviour, that ‘it is easier for a camel to go through\nthe eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.’\nThe possession of riches often tends to increase pride and\nself-indulgence; they expose you to flattery and to many temptations to\npleasure, which make the self-denying principles of Christ more\ndifficult to follow; it is not money alone, that is here meant, but all\nthe sinful vanities of a worldly life.”\n\n“Well, papa, and is not this just what frightens me? Would it not be\nbetter for me to have no money, and to live in some quiet place like the\nisland, where we should have nothing to tempt us off?”\n\n“No, my dear child, had it been so, we should have been continued there;\nbut the Bible does not tell us to renounce the world, but to overcome\nthe world. We are to live in it, but not to be led by it. If we have the\nadvantages of fortune and station in life, we have also greater\nresponsibilities--we are responsible for the example we set to those who\nlook up to us, and for the use we make of those riches which are\nintrusted to us, and for which, as faithful servants, we must one day\ngive an account.”\n\n“Then, papa, this is what you mean when you say, this world is a state\nof trial; for it is not only a trial when we are poor and miserable, but\nwhen we are rich and happy--I never thought of that before, but then we\ncan never be at peace, papa, nor enjoy being happy.”\n\n“Yes, my child, we can be so, by endeavouring to bring eternity more\nconstantly before us, and by giving to things present only their proper\nvalue: this will not prevent our enjoying them where consistent with\nduty, but will prevent our feeling as if all were lost when they are\ntaken away; for God has promised to ‘keep him in perfect peace, whose\nmind is stayed on Him.’ If we could only keep constantly in mind, that\nevery event, whether happy or mournful, if properly received, will work\ntogether for our everlasting good, we should indeed enjoy ‘that peace\nwhich passeth all understanding.’ Go then, my dear child, and enjoy the\nmany blessings which surround you, with a grateful heart.”\n\n“Yes, papa, I will go to Charles, and tell him you have made me well\nagain: he thinks I am ill, which will make him sorry, for you don’t know\nwhat a kind brother he is to me, and I like him so very much; he is one\nof my blessings, and I think he will work for good, for he always tells\nme what is right--good-bye, papa.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe young people were all impatience next morning to visit Peggy Dobie’s\ncottage. They met Mr. Howard returning from it, who told them they would\nfind Peggy much recovered. He had found her up, sitting by the fire\nreading her Bible, and full of gratitude and thanksgiving for the\nblessings which surrounded her.\n\n“My bairns,” she said as they entered, and she closed her Bible and laid\naside her spectacles, “you have come at the right moment--I hae been\ngiving praise to Him that has lifted me out o’ my sair tribulations, and\nit is here I hae found the words, and noo may He put into my heart what\nI should say to you; how can I ever thank you enough for all I see about\nme, for all you have done for me?”\n\n“You need not thank us, Peggy,” Leila answered; “for we are as happy as\nyou are; and it is so joyful that you should be alive, and so wonderful,\nthat we can scarce believe it;--and so you like your house?”\n\n“Like it, Miss Leila! ’deed that’s no’ the word to testify my wonderment\nat all I see around me. I hae been looking at that cupboard, wi’ all the\ntumblers and glasses sparkling and shining like a leddy dressed out in\nher diamonds, and praying that my auld head may not be turned all the\ngether wi’ the vanities o’ life; but to feel that I hae come to sic a\nhaven o’ rest, to lie down on that bed last night, and to think it was\nmy ain; to think that I am no longer a wanderer on the face o’ the\nearth, without a covering to my auld head, or a friend to speak the word\no’ comfort to my crushed spirit--no, it’s no’ just at ance that I can\nget into a measure o’ composedness for sic a change as this. I am in a\nbewilderment o’ joy and gratitude--and there’s Dash, bonnie man, wagging\nhis tail, and aye looking in my face; he is telling me we are in the\nland o’ Canaan noo. O let me ever thank God for all his mercies; and let\nme thank you also, my dear bairns, for all your kindness to me; for\nnever did I think to have seen your bit canty faces again in the land o’\nthe living, for it’s out o’ the swellings o’ Jordan that puir auld Peggy\nhas been delivered by an arm o’ strength.”\n\n“It is so nice to hear you speaking Scotch again,” Matilda said; “I like\nit so much. That word canty is such a nice word, and it is so nice to\nhave you back again when we thought you dead; but how did it all happen?\nWere you not washed overboard in the storm? You must tell us all about\nit. How were you saved?”\n\n“Yes,” Leila said, “it will be such an interesting story, and so long;\nfor you must tell us every thing from the very beginning. But you are\nnot to tell it all in one day, for that would tire you. You are very,\nvery thin, Peggy,” and Leila took Peggy’s withered hand in hers; “can we\ndo nothing to make you better? If it will tire you to speak, we will\nwait for the story till another day.”\n\n“No, my dear bairn, it will no tire me; and it’s weel my part to do all\nI can to pleasure you or yours, though I will not just say but what I\nmay feel a wee thought ashamed to tell sic a lang tale afore all the\nyoung ladies, and this fine young gentleman.”\n\n“But Peggy,” Leila said eagerly, “he is not a fine young gentleman; he\nis so kind and good-natured, he will like to hear the history of all\nthat has happened to you very much; and if he does not understand all\nthe Scotch words, I will explain them to him afterwards; he is my\nbrother Charles now, you need not be afraid of him.”\n\n“Your brother, is he? Weel, weel, sae let it be for the present, my\nbonnie lamb. And noo where am I to begin in this lang tale?”\n\n“At the very beginning,” Leila and Matilda both exclaimed at once; “at\nthe very beginning, Peggy, when you first embarked with all the pets.”\n\n“Ay, ay, and to think I hae no had the grace to ask after the puir dumb\nthings; but I am sair bewildered, and I kent they needs be safe, for\nthere’s my cat that was amang them, just lying afore the fire quite\ncontented, and no ways strange, puir thing. That civil gentleman, Master\nBill, (I think they call him,) brought it up to me this morning, and my\ntrunk too with my big Bible, and all the bits o’ things that are sae\nvaluable to me.”\n\n“But the story, the story, Peggy,” Matilda exclaimed, rather\nemphatically.\n\n“Yes, my bairn, that’s true, I was forgetting, and it’s aye the story,\nthe story, wi’ you young things. Weel then, to begin at the very\nbeginning, as you say. We got into the ship, (that is, the pets, as Miss\nLeila calls them, and me,) and it was a bonnie day, and the sea\nsparkling like diamonds, and wi’ a most deceitfu’ and canny look; but it\nwas all put on; no a word o’ truth in it, for it’s a most unchancy and\nawfu’ element, and in no ways to be trusted by a Christian woman. Weel,\nmy first discomfiture was when I was telt that I was by no means to go\nnear the pets, or to take any charge, for they would have better care\nthan mine; deed, and I was in no ways weel pleased, forbye that I had\nbeen thinking the parrots would have been gude company, and that I could\nhae given them some gude instruction maybe, puir things, and got them\ninto a manner o’ more sensible discourse than aye crying, ‘pretty poll,’\nand the like o’ thae vain and silly things. But it was no to be, so I\nturned my mind to some wee helpless bairns that were aye wailing and\nwearying for something; for ye ken Peggy must aye be doing. They had\nlost their mother, puir things, and the father o’ them was sadly put\nabout when night came, and all their bits o’ clothes to take off, and\nthe strings o’ them aye getting into knots, and he wi’ no manner o’\nskill or judgment to gang to work in the right manner; so I took them\nall in my ain hands, and got them into their bits o’ cribs wi’ a kind o’\ncomfort, and the wee thing who was but a babby clinging round my neck in\nthe dark, and saying, ‘Mamma was come back again, and she was no to gang\naway ony more.’ Deed it was just a moving scene, and minded me sae o’ my\nain bonnie flowers; and John, for that was his name, was sae gratified,\nand could no’ say enough for the little I could do. And so we got on\nwi’ a measure o’ comfort all the next day, till the wind began to roar\nlike a demented creature, wi’ no manner o’ discretion, ranting and\ntearing wi’ the steadfast resolution no to leave a hale rag in the ship;\nand there were the bairns, puir things, wailing and tumbling about on\nthe floor, and nae marvel either, seeing that them that had come to the\nyears o’ discretion could na keep their feet; and the captain, there was\nhe crying to put in the dead lights, which was no just civil to say the\nleast, and we wi’ the breath o’ life still in our bodies. Waes me, but\nit was an unco’ dispensation for him to be making preparations for a\ndead wake afore the living folk. He might hae thought, the ungodly man,\nthat there was an arm o’ strength that could lift us out o’ the deepest\npit of our tribulation.--But where was I? for ’deed I am sair bewildered\nwi’ all that happened.”\n\n“You were telling about the storm, Peggy,” Matilda said, eagerly. “Oh,\ndo go on, it is so very interesting.”\n\n“Ay, that’s true, I was telling about the storm; but waes me, words are\nweak to tell o’ that awfu’ scene. Weel, naething would serve me but I\nmaun be upon deck to see the warst o’ it; and there I stood, clinging\naye to John, and Dash at my side, wi’ the sense o’ a man o’ fifty,\nholding me fast by the gown; but it was na waves I saw, but mountains\nrising to the black heavens, and the white foam o’ them looking ghastly\nwhite in the darkness o’ the night, and every now and then a flash o’\nfire like a curtain o’ flame in the sky, and a sound like guns mingling\nwi’ the roar o’ the awfu’ blast; and there was the captain again, wi’ a\nlang thing like a trumpet in his mouth, and he thinking, wi’ his puir\nfeckless breath, to lift his voice above the anger o’ Heaven. I could na\nstand that, so I turned down to the cabin again; but oh, my bairns,\nnever while the breath o’ life is in my body will I forget the sound\nthat ere I was at the foot o’ the stairs met my ear. I canna speak o’\nit, I dare na think o’ it. Them that had stood at my side the minute\nafore in life and strength, sent to their last account, and without the\npower o’ a hand being stretched out to save them. I am no clear in my\nmind o’ what happened for a while after that; but then there was a cry\nthat the wind was no just sae strong, and that a boat had come off from\nthe shore for the passengers for Scarborough; it was for Scarborough\nJohn was bound, to take up his abode wi’ a sister, a widow-woman weel to\ndo in the world, and he was loath to part wi’ me, and leave me in sic\ntribulation; and the bairns they aye cried that mammy maun gang too,\nand I was down the side o’ the ship, and in the boat wi’ the wee babby\nin my arms afore I kent where I was, and Dash holding on again by my\ngown as he did afore; and how we e’er reached the shore was the gracious\nprovidence of God, for man had nought to do wi’ it; and we were up in\nthe air the one minute, and in the watery pit o’ destruction the next,\nand no a dry stitch upon us when we were lifted out wi’ scarce the\nbreath o’ life in our bodies; but all but gratitude to Heaven was\nforgotten when we sat that night in quietness and in comfort by that\nwidow-woman’s cheerful fire-side. And to see the bairns round the table\nat their tea, wi’ their bit blythe faces, and ilk are wi’ a jolly piece\nin its hand, for, as I said afore, she was well to do in the world that\nwidow-woman, and had all things in a superior way. ’Deed it was a scene\nto lift the heart wi’ gratitude and joy, and at night when I found\nmyself in a quiet comfortable bed, and nae mair heizing up and down wi’\nall thae outlandish sounds in my ear, ’deed I could na sleep wi’ very\npleasure, so I took to musing on the uses o’ the sea, and I could na\nmake it weel out at all; it seemed to me as if it was a fearfu’ scourge,\naye ready to be let loose on our sinfu’ heads, and made for naething but\nour destruction; but then I minded me o’ the fine caller haddys, and\nthae herrings at ten a penny, sic a blessing for the puir, and then I\nthought that there might be a measure o’ comfort in it after all, so wi’\nthat I fell asleep. The next morning I thought to hae gone on my way,\nbut they would nae hear o’ it, and the bairns they aye clung to me, and\nsaid I was to stay and be their mamma. ’Deed, auld as I was, I could nae\nbut think o’ sic a proposal afore John’s very face; and he, honest man,\nno ways willing. The day after that John set out wi’ me to put me on my\nroad, and he wrote me out a paper o’ all the towns I was to gang\nthrough, and sae we parted, and I gaed on my way, thinking it wad be but\na pleasant walk; but waes me, I had little thought or comprehension o’\nwhat was afore me. But I am thinking I have said enough for this present\ntime; you will be weary wi’ sic a lang tale.”\n\n“Oh no, Peggy,” Leila exclaimed, “I am quite sure none of us are weary.\nDo go on, for we wish so much to hear how you got here at last.”\n\n“And ’deed, my bairn, that’s no easy to tell, for I have but a confused\nthought o’ all that happened. Every day I walked on and on, and when I\ncame to the towns, I sleeped at big houses that they call houses o’\nentertainment: but ’deed it was no diversion to me, the money they aye\nasked frae me in the mornings; so I took to sleeping at farm-houses,\nand that answered better. To be sure sometimes I had but the barn or the\nhay-loft, and but a short word o’ welcome; but others that were mair\ncivil let me sleep in the big chair by the kitchen fire-side; and clean\nand comfortable mony o’ the kitchens were, dishes and platters on the\nwalls shining like silver, and big hams hanging from the roof, wi’ the\ngreatest plenty to eat and drink, and blythe bairns running about,\nlooking sae like their meat, that it did my heart good to see them. I\nwas aye happy when I got to a farm-house at night; but sometimes I was\nnot just sae lucky; and what wi’ paying for a night’s lodgings, and for\na ride in a wagon or a cart now and then, and for a loaf o’ bread and a\ndraught o’ beer, my money was fast melting away, and my heart no that\nlight; for aye when I asked if I was near London yet, they said it was a\nweary way, and ower far for sic an auld woman as me to compass. But it\nwas only when the days were fast shortening, and the long nights setting\nin, that the like o’ thae reflections crushed my spirit; yet the\nmorning’s sun made all right again and warmed my auld heart, and I felt\nthere was a Providence abune that could make the roughest way plain and\nthe langest way short to me. I was aye fond o’ the song o’ the robin,\nand whiles I would sit down by the side o’ a hedge and hearken to them\nin the trees abune my head, and then I would throw them some crumbs frae\nmy loaf o’ bread to pleasure them puir things; and the bonnie creatures\nwould come down to the ground and look up in my face, as if I had been a\nkent friend. And Dash, the wise animal, he would keep his distance, and\nlie as if the breath o’ life was out of his body, till they had ta’en\ntheir breakfast wi’ comfort and discretion. From all that I hae\nexperienced in my lang travel, I think the robins are o’ the same nature\nas in my ain land, just as frank and as kindly. But oh, my bairns! sic a\ndifference in the rivers; instead of the clear bonnie Esk that I had\nbeen used to, wi’ the sand lying at the bottom sparkling like diamonds\nin some parts, and in others springing over the big stones like bairns\nlet loose frae the school, there I came to rivers as quiet and lazy as\nmill-ponds, and looking as black and drumlie as if they had washed all\nthe dishes in thae big towns in them; but ’deed it’s no wise discreet in\nme to be making thae reflections; for if their waters are no just sae\nclear, surely I am come to a land flowing with milk and honey, and need\nna mind. But I am wandering from my road again.”\n\n“Yes, Peggy,” Matilda said, “you are forgetting to tell us how your\nmoney lasted, and what you did when it was done. Oh! it must have been\nso dreadful when you began to be starved to death.”\n\n“‘Deed, and it was no ways pleasant; but it was no just sae bad as that;\nand I aye keepit a thought on Him who feedeth the fowls o’ the air, and\nwas no that down-hearted; still it was a serious thought, and I was at\nmy last shilling when the pedlar was graciously sent to me.”\n\n“The pedlar, Peggy, how was that?”\n\n“You see, Miss Matilda, I was sitting by the road-side one morning,\ntaking counsel wi’ my ain thoughts and looking at the shilling, and\nturning it round and round in my hand wi’ a serious countenance, nae\ndoubt, when an honest man wi’ a pack upon his back came up to me.\n‘Mistress,’ he said, ‘you are looking at that shilling as if there\nwerena mony ahint it, and you were loath to part company.’ ‘’Deed,’ I\nsaid, ‘you hae made a gude guess and are no far wrong; for it’s the very\nlast shilling I hae in the world, and a long journey, I reckon, is still\nafore me.’ Wi’ that we fell into discourse, and I telt him all my story;\nfor he was frae my ain country, and my heart warmed to him. He said that\nfor that day and the next our road lay in the same direction, and that\nhe would be blythe o’ my company. Was I to refuse sic a civil\ninvitation?--by no means. So we gaed on our way thegither, and had\nmuckle pleasant discourse; for he was far travelled, and had great\nlearning and experience o’ the world, and was, forbye, a God-fearing and\ncivil man, and had but one fault that I could discern, he was ower fond\no’ beer; preserve me, but I would hae sleepit sound, and ower sound, as\nhe, puir man, found that night, if I had ta’en all he offered me, for he\nwas no ways niggardly; and when I spoke o’ asking up-pitting for the\nnight at a farm-house, he would na hear it; he would treat me, he said,\nbaith to a supper and a bed, and be blythe to do so. Weel, when night\ncame on, we turned into a comfortable-looking house by the road-side,\nwhere they selt the beer he was ower fond o’; and it was a canty scene\nthat big kitchen, that lifted the very heart o’ me. There was the\nmistress frying bacon on the warm red fire, and mair than one hungry man\nsitting on low stools, listening wi’ delight to the hissing sound o’ it;\nand a wee baby in a cradle, no thinking o’ sleep, but lying so pleased,\nwi’ the great een o’ it wide open, and staring at its brothers and\nsisters, dancing in a corner o’ the room to the music o’ a blind\nfiddler; they were near to a table where some men were drinking, and\nthere was a man sat there wi’ a face I could no get out o’ my mind at\nall. He had a down look and an ill look to my thought; and I noticed\nthat though he had his tankard o’ beer afore him like the rest, when he\nthought nae body was looking that way, he lifted the tankard that had\nbeen put down afore the puir blind fiddler, and took a lang pull out o’\nit. I would na hae been that sorry if it had choked him, and I felt in\nmy mind that the man would surely come to shame and want. Aweel, when\nthe mistress showed me the room I was to sleep in, I could na get this\nman’s ill face out o’ my mind, and I asked her if the men that were\ndrinking at the table were to bide all night. ‘Some of them might,’ she\nsaid, ‘and some might not; but I need not be frightened, for my friend\nthe pedlar was to sleep in the next room to me, and there was a door\nthrough frae my room to his. You see,’ she said, ‘there is only a latch\nto it, for the key has been lost; but as he is an honest man nae doubt,\nand your friend, you will no mind that; but this is a decent house, and\nyou need fear no disturbance;’ and wi’ that she left me. I had not been\nlong in bed afore I heard the pedlar, honest man, snoring soundly. I was\nweary, weary, and yet for a lang time I could no get to sleep, for the\nfiddle seemed aye sounding in my ears, and the bit bairnies dancing\nafore me, and that man’s ill face aye taking anither look at me, but\nafter a time I heard steps passing up the stairs, and the front door was\nbarred in, and quietness fell upon the house; and then, though it was\nno just sleep that came over me, it was a kind o’ a dover, and how lang\nit lasted I canna tell, but suddenly it seemed to me as if I heard a\nstep in the passage and some one stopping at my door,--I started up in\nmy bed and listened; a lock turned, but it was na in my room, but in the\nnext; and then I saw a light under the door that had the latch. I sprang\nup and looked through the key-hole; the ill face o’ that awfu’ man\nseemed glaring on me, I could scarcely breathe, for I felt sure he saw\nme, but he turned away and went straight up to the bed; he seemed to\nlisten for a moment, bending over it, then softly lifting up a worsted\nplaid that was lying over a chair by the bed-side, he seized the pack\nwhich the plaid was covering, and turned to the door again. He had his\nback to me then; I lifted the latch and sprang in, and the next moment I\nhad him by the throat, the ill rascal, wi’ a scream that wakened the\nwhole house. He let fall the pack, shook me off as if I had been a\nfeather, and darted along the passage. He took me for a ghaist, nae\ndoubt; for, for decency’s sake, I had put the white sheet about me.\nAweel, we looked for him all over the house, but saw naething but a\nwindow wide open, and doubtless out o’ that window the ill-conditioned\ncreature had gone on his evil way. It was na muckle sleep that either\nthe pedlar or me got that night, I reckon, for I heard nae mair\nsnoring.”\n\n“Oh, Peggy!” more than one voice exclaimed, “how frightful and how\ninteresting; but go on, go on, tell us more.”\n\n“Aweel, in the morning he could na be grateful enough, honest man, for\nwhat I had done for him. ‘For himself,’ he said, ‘he did na’ fancy\nriding much, but it would be a rest to me; so all that day we rode\nthegither in a wagon like ladies and gentlemen, he treating me to the\nbest o’ every thing, and himsel’ no taking just sae muckle o’ the beer.\nThe next morning after that, when we parted, he would force upon me twa\nbonnie white half-crowns, and telt me aye to ride when I could, for that\nhe did not think I was that strong for sic an undertaking as I had still\nbefore me. I would fain hae refused the money, for it seemed to me like\ntaking payment for doing only what was natural to do; but I thought also\nthat pride might have something to do wi’ refusing, and pride was na’\nfor a Christian woman, so I took the siller. I took his advice too, for\nI felt that I was not that strong; so I aye rode when I could get a cart\nor a wagon, but it took mair money than I could weel spare. Many o’ the\nwagoners and carters spoke a language I could na’ weel make out, but\nthey aye contrived to make it plain to me that they wanted siller.\nEvery day my pocket got lighter and lighter, and my heart heavier; for I\ncame to my last penny, and still a lang way lay afore me. I need na’ vex\nyour hearts wi’ all I suffered wi’ want and lang travel. Some of the\nfolk were kind to me, and some were not; I dinna weel mind all that\nhappened, I ken only that aye when I was at my last extremity, He that I\nserve had pity upon me; and I aye remembered that ‘He had not where to\nlay His head,’ and took courage. One night I came to a farm-house, the\ndoor was shut, but I looked through the kitchen window, and, oh! but it\nwas a cheerfu’ canty scene. There was a cat as big and as sleek as a fat\nlamb lying afore the warm fire, and the mistress and the gudeman, and\nthe bairns, and the farm servants, all round a big table at their\nsupper, and the greatest plenty o’ every thing, and sic a smoke from the\nbig dishes o’ meat and o’ potatoes, and sic a speaking and laughing,\nthat I had to tap many a time afore they heard me; but at last the\nmistress hersel’ came to the door, and wi’ her a bonnie wee lassie at\nher side. I was all in a tremble, and I telt her my story, and asked for\na night’s lodging; but the pleasant face o’ her entirely changed. ‘And\nhow am I to know,’ she said, ‘that there is a word of truth in all this?\nalways the story that they have lost their way, or lost their money, or\nsome such thing. It was but last night that I gave lodging to an old\nwoman, who looked as respectable as you do, and she was off this morning\nby daybreak with two of my best night-caps that were drying before the\nfire. No, no, you must take the road again, and be thankful you have a\nclear moon above your head.’ ‘Oh, mother, mother!’ I heard the wee thing\nsay, but she shut the door in my face. I was weary, and I was faint wi’\nhunger too, for I had tasted little that day; to gang on my way was no\npossible, for the very life seemed sinking out o’ me; so I crept round\nby the back o’ the house to seek some sheltered nook to lie down in, no\nwishing ever to rise again. All my desire was to lay myself down in a\nquiet corner and there to be found dead in the morning. I was leaning\nagainst a wall sair spent, and Dash keeping close at my side, as he aye\ndid, striving, puir thing, to keep me warm, when a mist came afore my\neyes--it cleared away, and I seemed to see my ain bonnie bairns wi’ the\nfaces o’ angels beckoning to me, and I heard my husband’s voice speaking\nwords o’ comfort, and then a door at the back of the house softly\nopened, and the bonnie lamb I had seen afore stepped out into the\nmoonlight; she looked about her for a moment on every side, and when the\nlight fell on the face o’ her, it seemed to me as if she too was a kind\nspirit frae anither world. She was passing to the front o’ the house\nwhen she saw me, and, oh!--but it was a sweet voice that sounded in my\near when she took my hand, and said,--‘There is a sixpence and a penny\nfor you, it is all the money I have, but maybe it will get you a bed at\na house you will soon come to on the road-side; and here is some bread\nand cheese for your supper, for I am sure you are hungry.’ I was trying\nto say something, when a voice cried out, ‘Alice, Alice, where are you?’\nand the mistress hersel’ came up to where we were standing. ‘Oh,\nmother!’ the dear bairn said, ‘do not put her away for she looks so\nsorrowful and she can scarcely walk; do let her sit at the kitchen fire\nall night--I am sure she is an honest woman.’ The mistress looked in my\nface. ‘Well,’ she said, I may have judged you wrongfully, so I will take\nAlice’s word for it; for it’s not my usual custom to turn my face from\nthe poor of the land, so come in, old woman, and you shall have some\nsupper.’ She took me into the warm kitchen, and seated me at the fire,\nand the best o’ every thing was set afore me, and bonnie wee Alice took\na low stool and set herself down at my feet, and she aye looked up in my\nface wi’ her kindly smile, and seemed to enjoy every morsel I put in my\nmouth; and she could na make enough o’ Dash, and was sae pleased when\nthe mistress hersel’ set a plate o’ bones afore him that might have\nserved a king. Aweel, we took our supper wi’ thanksgiving, and in a\ncloset off the kitchen I had a clean comfortable bed to lie down on,\nwhich was a great refreshment. The mistress took to me in an uncommon\nway. I telt her where I was going, and all about it; and in the morning\nshe gave me my breakfast and a white shilling out o’ her ain pocket. I\nwas fain to gie little Alice back her sixpence and the penny, but she\nwas affronted and would na hear tell o’ it; so I laid them down on the\nwee pillow o’ her bed when she was looking anither way.”\n\nThe tears were in Leila’s eyes: “Oh, Peggy,” she said, “what a dear\nlittle girl Alice must have been! how I wish I could thank her for being\nso very kind to you; but you are not to stop yet, you have more to tell\nus.”\n\n“Not much more, Miss Leila, for mony o’ the days after that seem to have\npassed out o’ my mind. I think it was but twice after that that I had\nonything like a decent bed to lie down on; it was getting darkish one\nday when I was passing through a village, a heap o’ bairns came running\npast just out o’ school, and a wild laddie had something tied up in a\nnapkin, and he aye cried he was going to drown it, and they maun come\nand see. My mind misgave me that it was a kitten, puir thing, so I\nfollowed on to a pond that I saw afore me, and just as I got near I\nheard sic a wild screech, and there was a wee lassie struggling in the\nwater; I cried loud to Dash, and he was into the pond in no time, and\nafore anither minute was over, the puir half-drowned thing was laid at\nmy feet. Aweel, I took it up in my arms and turned back to the village.\nThe mother o’ it was like to go out o’ her judgment wi’ fright and wi’\njoy; I stayed to help to put the bairn into a warm bed, the puir lamb\nwould nae be comforted. Aye when we thought that she was dropping over\nto sleep she started up again in an unco tremble, and crying out, ‘No,\nno, mother, don’t be angry, I will never, never go near the pond again;’\nand when Dash came up to the bed wagging his tail, and trying to make\nacquaintance wi’ her, she was like to go out o’ her judgment, wi’ no\nmanner o’ knowledge or gratitude for what he had done for her. Aweel,\nshe fell into a sleep at last; ‘Oh, my darling,’ the mother said,\n‘many’s the time I have told her to keep away from those wicked boys,\nand by no means to go near that ugly pond, for my mind misgave me that\nsomething might happen; but she has been punished enough, poor thing,\nshe will not again forget my warning;’ and she leaned over the dear\nbairn wi’ sic joy and thankfulness, and kissed her over and over again.\nThough it was getting late, I thought now to have gone on my way again,\nbut though she was but a widow woman, and seemed to have naught to\nspare, she would na hear of it, so I stayed wi’ her that night, and she\ndid all she could to make me comfortable. The next circumstance that I\nremember was when I found myself in a town, and sae spent wi’ hunger I\ncould scarcely walk; I had parted wi’ my warm cloak afore, and I think\nshame to tell you how many salt tears that had cost me, (but it was a\npresent from my gudeman,) and I was thinking if there was onything else\nI could sell, and holding by the rails, for I could scarcely stand, when\na decent-looking young woman, wi’ a most pleasant face, came up to me.\n‘What is the matter, poor woman,’ she said, in a kindly voice, ‘you are\nsurely ill?’ I telt her I was starving. ‘Waes me,’ she said, ‘and I have\nno money to give you, for I have just been disappointed myself: but come\nwith me, you shall have something to eat at least.’ She took me by the\narm and helped me on, and we entered a big house, where a great mony\npeople seemed to be living, for I heard voices o’ men and women, and\nbairns, some crying and some laughing. ‘My sister and I have a room\nhere,’ she said, as we gaed up the stairs; then taking me by the hand\nalong a dark passage, she opened a door, and I saw a young woman\nsitting close to the window working busily, though it was getting dark.\n‘Jessie,’ she said, ‘you will have thought me long away, and after all I\nhave come back without the money for the shirts, for Mrs. Churchill was\nnot at home.’ ‘Without the money,’ Jessie repeated, ‘and not a morsel in\nthe house beyond our night’s supper, and not a farthing to buy more! Oh,\nEllen, this is sorrowful news. But who is this you have got with you?’\nEllen told her how she had fallen in wi’ me, and it was beautiful to see\nthe kindness o’ baith the sisters. There was but a small fire, but they\ngathered up the cinders, and made me sit close to it, and they rubbed my\nhands and spoke words o’ comfort to me; and Ellen brought some bread and\ncheese out of a cupboard, and set it afore me, and baith o’ them pressed\nme to eat. Just then there was a tap at the door. ‘That will be the\nnurse,’ Ellen said, jumping up; ‘I forgot to tell you that she said she\nmight perhaps be able to bring the money if her mistress came home in\ntime.’ It was the nurse sure enough, and oh, sic joy as it was to the\nkind-hearted creatures when the nurse counted down ten bonnie shillings\non the table. ‘Put on the tea-kettle,’ Ellen said, ‘and I will be back\nin a moment with some tea and sugar; and, Mistress Nurse, perhaps you\nwill stay and take a cup of tea, you have always been such a kind\nfriend to us.’ But Mistress Nurse said she could by no means stay, for\nher lady might want her; and she was just going away when she noticed\nDash. ‘Bless me,’ she said, ‘what a fine animal, but how thin he is; he\nlooks half-starved; my heart is sore for the creature, tea is not just\nthe thing for him, but if I can get hold of the stable-boy when I go\nhome, I will send him up with a plate of scraps; he will like that\nbetter.’ And she was as good as her word; Dash had such a supper as he\nhad not seen for many a day. And how the sisters were pleased and\ndiverted when the creature picked out the largest bone he could find in\nall the platter, and laid it at my feet. Aweel, we had our tea in\ncomfort, and the best o’ butter, which Ellen said was a treat by\nordinar, and muckle pleasant discourse; and I telt them about you, Miss\nSelina, getting your speech again, and about Miss Leila in the island.\nThey said it was like a fairy tale, and that they had naething to tell\nme about themselves sae romantic. They had lost baith father and mother,\nand they worked for their bread, and had come through great straits;\nsometimes they had plenty to do, and were comfortable enough, and\nsometimes they were sair put about, and at their last penny; but their\nmother had been a God-fearing woman, and had given them the best o’\ncounsel, and they aye kept up their hearts, for there was a Providence\nabune, they said, that kent what was best for them. The room was clean\nand neat, though the furniture was scant. There was but one bed, but\nthey borrowed a mattress from a kind neighbour, and I lay baith warm and\ncomfortable on it. In the morning I had a sair struggle, for they would\nhae me to take one o’ their hard-earned shillings; but I would by no\nmeans hear o’ it, and I was the more positive as they had telt me that I\nwas but a day’s journey or so frae Richmond, and need na gang through\nthat awfu’ London, which was a great ease to my mind. So I took only\nsome small change Ellen had gotten in from the tea, and gaed on my way.\nIt was a clear bright day, but it was hard frost when night came on, and\nI was stiff wi’ cold, and weary, weary; and I could get naething better\nthan a barn to lie down in, for I had but a penny to offer, and they\njeered at me, and said a barn was ower good for sic payment. The next\nmorning seems all like a confused kind o’ dream, I remember naething but\nthat I crawled on and on, often stopping and feeling unco’ sleepy, but\naye feared to lie down lest I should ne’er waken again; but though I\nkent Richmond could na be far off now, I was but the mair sorrowful, for\nI could bear it no longer; I could na move anither step, but sunk down\nby the road-side. A mist came afore my eyes, I ken naething mair, but\nthat I seemed to waken in Heaven, for when I opened my eyes again, your\ndear faces were all around me.” Peggy ceased speaking, and clasped her\nhands together as if in prayer. There were tears in most eyes; even\nCharles, who seemed to think it unmanly to give way, had to struggle\nhard with his emotion.\n\n“Leila,” he said, as they returned home, “I can well understand what\nyour grief must have been in thinking Peggy lost to you. I am going to\nwrite all her story down, it is so interesting, and it will be my first\nlesson in the Scotch language; I would not have missed hearing her tell\nit for the world.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nA few days more, and solitude and silence seemed to have fallen on\nWoodlands. The whole party had dispersed. Mrs. Roberts had come back\nfrom paying a visit to her sister, and even the Stanleys had returned\nhome. Leila had felt the parting with so many kind friends a good deal,\nand the holidays seemed to her now as but one bright day too quickly\npast. But there were alleviations; Sherborne Park, the residence of Mr.\nHerbert, was but an hour’s ride from Woodlands; Leila could now manage\nSelim with ease; Charles was still to be one week more at home, and on\nthe first Saturday after the breaking up of the party, he promised to be\nearly at Woodlands on his pony, to escort Mr. Howard and Leila to\nSherborne Park: besides this, her joy and thankfulness at having\nrecovered Peggy and her dear Dash, bid defiance to all approaches to any\ndepression of spirits. She was buoyant as ever, and each morning, on her\nway to her Aunt Stanley’s, she stopped for a few moments at Peggy’s\ncottage to say a few kind words to her, and bring joy and sunshine to\nthe old woman’s heart.\n\nMost of the neighbouring families had called at Woodlands; amongst\nothers, Mr. and Mrs. Mildmay, with their daughter Lydia. Leila liked\nLydia’s appearance; she was a pretty looking girl, remarkably well\ndressed, with a beautiful complexion, fine hair, and a very animated\nexpression of face; she praised every thing she saw, was delighted with\nthe pets, said they were happy creatures to have such a dear, pretty\nlittle mistress, and kissed Leila twice at parting, and hoped they would\nalways be great friends. Leila was much gratified, and was tempted for\nthe first time to think Selina might be wrong, and too hasty in her\njudgments. She was made very happy a few days after, by her Aunt Stanley\ntelling her she had obtained her papa’s consent to her remaining to\ndinner, as Mr. Mildmay, having county business with Mr. Stanley was,\nwith his wife and daughter, to dine with them that day.\n\nIt was a very agreeable day to Leila; she liked Lydia more and more. She\nhad now quite made up her mind to think Selina’s character of her a\nmistaken one. Lydia seemed full of heart and affection for all of them,\nbut apparently to prefer Selina to the others; always listening when\nshe spoke, and always declaring that she must know best, and in all\ntheir little discussions coming over to her way of thinking. But Leila\nwould have been the first to retract the too favourable opinion she had\nformed, had she been present at a conversation which took place in the\nschool-room before tea. Lydia and Matilda were alone together, they had\nbeen talking of Leila. “Yes,” Lydia said, “I don’t wonder you like her,\nshe took my fancy very much; there is some life and spirit in her. I am\nsure I hope Selina will not make her as prim as she is herself, for she\nseems to have taken quite a passion for that dear sister of yours.”\n\nMatilda’s colour mounted to her forehead. “I thought you were very fond\nof Selina,” she said, in an offended tone of voice; “I am sure you\nalways talk to her as if you were.”\n\n“And who tells you I am not?”\n\n“You yourself do; you would not talk in that way of one you really\nliked. Ah, Lydia, that is not being sincere.” Selina’s warning came\nforcibly into her mind at that moment; but she was sorry she had said so\nmuch, for Lydia seemed extremely angry; looking very red, she said,\n\n“Matilda, that idea would never have entered your head; I know who\nhas----” She stopped, and with a changed expression of look and tone\nshe continued, “But this is quite foolish, we are getting angry with\neach other for no reason whatever, for we are quite of the same opinion\non this subject; I am sure you cannot have a higher opinion of Selina\nthan I have. I only wish I could be more like her,” and she sighed\nheavily; “but still you must not be angry if I love my own little\nMatilda even more,” and she drew Matilda towards her, and kissed her\ncheek.\n\nMatilda felt at this moment she would rather that she had not done so,\nbut still she was gratified and flattered that one generally allowed to\nbe so clever and accomplished as Lydia, and who was several years older\nthan herself, should make quite a friend of her, and even often\ncondescend to ask her advice. Had Matilda reflected further, she would\nhave been aware that though she did so, she seldom or ever followed it.\nLydia, in fact, always ended by taking her own way in every thing,\nthough apparently yielding to the judgment of others. She now, as if to\nchange the subject, observed, “What nice-looking books you have got on\nthose shelves; your school-room always looks so cheerful and so\ncomfortable. What a pretty book that seems to be at the top there; I\nshould like to see it.”\n\n“Oh, that is a beautiful book,” Matilda answered; “but it belongs to\nMrs. Roberts. There are sketches in it which were drawn by her husband;\nshe has the greatest value for it, and she shows it to us sometimes; but\nshe has forbidden us ever to touch it when she is not by.”\n\n“Oh, she is afraid, I suppose, of Alfred’s dirty little hands, for you\nknow he is for ever grubbing in the earth, hunting after snails or\nspiders, or some such creatures; but a young lady’s hands are very\ndifferent,” and she drew off her nice kid glove, and displayed her\npretty little white hand, on which a beautiful ring sparkled which had\noften been Matilda’s admiration. “You cannot suppose,” she continued,\n“that she would have any objections to my looking at the book; and as\nshe is so very obliging and good-natured, she will be quite gratified, I\nam sure, that I should admire her book.” She drew a chair towards her\nand was mounting upon it.\n\nMatilda held her back. “Oh pray don’t,” she said; “I don’t wish to\ndisobey Mrs. Roberts, and I promised not to touch or look at it when she\nwas not by.”\n\n“Well, don’t touch it, my little pattern miss,” Lydia said; “don’t touch\nit; put your hands behind your back, and then you can swear you did not;\nyou need not even look at it; shut your eyes and turn your back, my\npretty dear, and I will describe, to you the beautiful scenes as I turn\nover the pages; for I have no pleasure when it is not shared.” Then\nchanging her tone of raillery, she continued: “But what has come over my\nlittle Matilda? I scarcely know her again--she that used to be so\nobliging and so affectionate towards me--have I indeed lost my little\nfriend?”\n\n“Oh, no, no!” Matilda exclaimed, and tears were in her eyes. “I am still\nyour little friend; don’t be angry with me. You will love me again,\nwon’t you?”\n\nLydia’s smile was that of triumph; but Matilda did not see it--she was\nnow covering her eyes with her hands.\n\nLydia jumped up on the chair and took down the book; then gently\nremoving Matilda’s hands, she said,--“Come, darling, don’t be foolish;\nlet me see my sweet Matilda again; let us be friends as we have ever\nbeen.”\n\nPoor Matilda! all her sense of what was right, all her good resolutions,\nvanished before Lydia’s bland smile. Selina’s repeated warnings, and yet\nmore, the texts of the morning, had been entirely forgotten.--“Show me\nthy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.” And the answer: “Trust in the\nLord with all thy heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding; in\nall thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.” Alas! had\nshe asked in sincerity to be shown His ways, to be guided in His paths?\nhad she not leant to her own understanding, and listened to the voice of\nthe tempter? how then could she expect that God would direct her ways\nwhen God was not in all her thoughts? She turned over the pages of the\nbook for Lydia, she explained the sketches, and praised them\nextravagantly, with a confused idea that she was atoning to Mrs. Roberts\nin some degree by doing so, and she gave herself completely up to the\nenjoyment of the moment.\n\n“Well,” Lydia said, as she turned the last page, “now we have finished;\nwe have had our pleasure, and what the worse, I should like to know, is\nthe pretty book of our admiration? Come, let us put it up again in the\nbook-case.”\n\nMatilda jumped up to assist her, and in her haste overturned an\nink-glass on the table, which she herself had neglected to put into the\ninkstand again; a small portion of the ink fell on the beautiful binding\nof the book; Matilda was horror-struck.\n\n“Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?” she exclaimed, as she stood in\nhelpless distress gazing upon it.\n\nBut Lydia did not lose her presence of mind for a moment; tearing out a\nsheet of blotting-paper from a book which lay before them, she quickly\nsoaked up the ink, then seizing a sponge which Selina had been using for\nher drawing, she dipped it in a tumbler of water, and dexterously\neffaced almost every trace of the stain. The book was bound in white\nvellum, highly glazed, so that the ink had not sunk in, scarcely a trace\nof it was discernible.\n\n“Now is not this well and cleverly done?” Lydia said. “Come, cheer up,\nMatilda, don’t think of it another moment; it was awkward enough in you,\nto be sure; but _mum’s the word_, and it never will be perceived; I must\nput it in the book-case again, and as far back as I can.” She was\njumping up on the chair, but Matilda took the book from her hand and\nlooked at it earnestly for a moment.\n\n“Oh! you need not be afraid, and look so dismal; I really don’t think it\npossible it can be found out.”\n\nMatilda still retained the book in her hand, and rose as if about to\nleave the room.\n\n“Where are you going?” Lydia impatiently asked.\n\n“To show this to Mrs. Roberts,” Matilda answered, timidly.\n\n“To show it to Mrs. Roberts! Are you mad, Matilda? Surely you would not\nbe such a fool--oh! I beg your pardon for calling you so; how mamma\nwould be shocked if she heard me talking in this vulgar manner--there\nis nothing she dislikes so much as vulgarity. I beg your pardon, but you\ndid put me in such a passion.” Then changing her tone from that of\nanger, she continued, mournfully,--“And so you would bring me into this\nscrape and get me punished, I who have ever loved you, ever been your\nfriend--I who would have stood by you till the last moment! Oh, Matilda!\nbut go--go and leave me.”\n\nMatilda stood irresolute. She covered her face with her hands, the tears\ntrickled down between her fingers, but she softly repeated to herself,\n“Trust in the Lord with all thy heart, and He shall direct thy path.”\nShe removed her hands, she looked up, and in a firm voice she\nsaid,--“Lydia, it was I who overturned the ink, and it is I who shall\nbear the punishment;” and she left the room.\n\nShe found Selina and Leila with Mrs. Roberts; the expression of her face\ninstantly arrested their attention. “What has happened, Matilda?” they\nboth exclaimed; “what is the matter?”\n\nShe put them back with her hand, and steadily advancing to the table\nwhere Mrs. Roberts sat, she laid the book before her, and pointing to\nwhere the stain had been, she said,--“Mrs. Roberts, I spilt the ink upon\nyour book; I am very sorry----” She tried to say more, she could not,\nshe was weeping.\n\nMrs. Roberts looked much distressed. “Matilda,” she said, “it is not on\naccount of any injury my book has sustained that I am so distressed--and\nindeed I do not think I should have observed it--but you have disobeyed\nmy express command, and you have also broken your promise to me; for it\nwas yourself who voluntarily gave that promise--I did not ask it of\nyou.”\n\n“Oh! yes; I remember that quite well; I have been very, very wrong; I\ndeserve to be punished, and I will try to bear it well.”\n\nSelina looked earnestly at her; then throwing her arms round her neck,\nshe whispered,--“Tell me, dear Matilda, did Lydia ask you to show her\nthat book?”\n\nMatilda made no answer; she kissed Selina fondly, then turning round,\nshe said,--“Mrs. Roberts, I know I must be punished, what do I deserve?”\n\n“Not a very severe punishment, Matilda; for you have already lessened\nyour fault by confessing it to me; and you will still further, I am\nsure, atone for it by confessing it to God and imploring His\nforgiveness. I see that you feel it deeply and are really penitent; I\nshall, therefore, leave your punishment with yourself. Say, then, what\nit shall be.”\n\nMatilda stood for some moments looking on the ground, her colour varying\nat every moment. “I had rather that you should have punished me,” she\nsaid. “But if I do not come into the room to-morrow, or next day, or the\nnext, when you read aloud to us, will that be enough, do you think? I\nassure you it will be a great punishment to me.”\n\nMrs. Roberts was in the habit of reading out some interesting story to\nthem for an hour every day while they were employed in working for the\npoor. Matilda used to call it her happy hour, and the tears again filled\nher eyes at the thoughts of such a banishment. Mrs. Roberts saw it would\nindeed be punishment enough. She assented, and taking Matilda in her\narms and kissing her, she said,--“You have my forgiveness, my child; now\ngo to your room and ask forgiveness of your heavenly Father for your\nSaviour’s sake, and strength from the Holy Spirit to walk more and more\nin His blessed ways.”\n\nWhen Matilda returned to the school-room a short time afterwards, to\ninvite Lydia to go to tea, her countenance was quite cheerful again.\nLydia looked at her attentively. “Well,” she said, “I see you have got\nit over, and well over; I only hope you have not committed me; what did\nyou say, Matilda? how much did you tell?”\n\n“I told only that I had spilt the ink on the book.”\n\n“And you did not mention my name?”\n\n“No, I did not.”\n\nBut Lydia seemed to understand the tone and manner in which those few\nwords were said, and hastened to efface the bad impression she had made.\n“You are a generous, noble girl, Matilda,” she said, “and though\nyounger, far better than I am; you must teach me to be like you;” she\ntwined her arms fondly round her waist, and they left the room together.\n\nAs Matilda finished reading the Bible that evening, she closed the book,\nand sat for some minutes in deep thought. “Am I a noble, generous girl?”\nshe asked herself; “and does Lydia really think so? perhaps she only\nsaid it to flatter me; I wish I really knew; I wish I could ask\nSelina,--that would be betraying Lydia. No, I am not a noble girl--I\noften do wrong things; I wish I had not liked the praise so much, or\nbelieved Lydia. I wish I did not like her so; perhaps she does me no\ngood; but it is not kind to Lydia to think so.” She knelt down and said\nher prayers, and fervently she asked to be forgiven for her disobedience\nand for having broken her promise. She asked also to have the love of\npraise more taken out of her heart; to be meek and lowly like Him she\nwas taught to serve; and she got into bed more peaceful, almost happy,\nand soon fell asleep.\n\nSaturday came, and Charles was faithful to his appointment. It was a\nbright morning, every thing looked gay in the sunshine, the ground\nsparkled with a light frost; but Selim was the most sure-footed of\nponies. Leila rode between her papa and Charles--how could she be\nafraid? She was in high spirits, it was her first ride of any\nconsiderable length; she was quite elated by the dignity of her\nsituation, and every now and then she touched Selim lightly with her\nwhip, and sprang on a few yards before the others, and then looked back\nand laughed at their grave looks. By degrees she became more bold, more\nanxious to show off before Charles, and to prove to him that she had\nbecome quite an excellent horsewoman. She touched Selim less gently--he\nsprang forward, and from a brisk canter was soon at full gallop, Leila’s\nlight figure seeming as if raised every moment into mid air.\n\nThe others held back; they knew the danger of following too closely.\n“Oh, my child! my child!” Mr. Howard repeatedly exclaimed. It was to\nboth a moment of extreme agitation, for a turn in the road now hid Leila\nfrom their sight. But Leila, though much frightened at first, did not\nlose her presence of mind. She allowed Selim to proceed for some time\nwithout opposition, then gently checked him as Charles had instructed\nher to do, the obedient animal first slackened his pace, and then stood\nentirely still. Her papa and Charles came up, both looking much alarmed.\nCharles did not speak, he was extremely pale. Leila looked at them both\nand burst into tears. “Oh! how I have frightened and distressed you,”\nshe said; “I have been so wrong, so silly; do forgive me papa--do not be\nangry--I am so sorry.”\n\n“You have indeed been wrong, and very imprudent,” Mr. Howard answered;\n“and you have much reason to be grateful for the escape you have made.\nYou are far too ignorant a horsewoman to be aware of the danger you\nexposed yourself to; but don’t let us talk of it any more at present;\nyou have now got a lesson which I am sure you will not forget; keep\nclose to us, my dear child, for you are still far too inexperienced to\nbe trusted for a moment alone.”\n\nThey now proceeded without further interruption. Mina was watching for\nthem at the park gate, and ran by their side all up the approach, they\nwalking their horses that they might keep pace with her, and Leila\nchatting to her as gaily as ever. Mrs. Herbert’s reception of them was\nall that was kind and affectionate, as she welcomed Leila to her second\nhome; and in rambling with Charles and Mina all over the grounds, the\nday was passed in much enjoyment. The place was extensive and kept in\nthe most beautiful order. Leila, however, did not admire it quite so\nmuch as Woodlands; but what interested her greatly was a small\npicturesque-looking church which stood in the grounds and its adjoining\nparsonage. With this scene she was delighted; and when Charles told her\nthe parsonage would probably one day be his future home, as he wished to\ntake holy orders, and the living was in his father’s gift, she thought\nshe had never seen any thing so charming.\n\n“And it looks so comfortable,” she said, “so much nicer than a large\nhouse. How I wish Woodlands were no bigger than this parsonage!--how\nhappy will you be, Charles, when you have such a house, and when I come\nto visit here--you will often ask Mina and me to come to tea, and you\nwill let us make tea for you, time about, won’t you?--But, Charles,” she\ncontinued, “you are not so merry as you used to be, and you don’t say\nyou would be happy to see us to tea--ah! I know what it is; you are\nangry with me.”\n\n“Angry with you, Leila?--oh, no! how can you think so?”\n\n“Yes, because I know I deserve it; it was so foolish of me to wish you\nto admire me, and to think you would.”\n\n“And do you think that would be so difficult, Leila?” he asked.\n\n“I don’t know; I don’t understand about that; but I know you should\nnot--you should not admire any thing vain, and I should not wish it; and\nif you are to be a clergyman, you know, you should teach me to be meek\nand lowly in heart. I am sure my papa will be so glad when I tell him\nyou are to be a clergyman; for he will think, as you grow taller and\nolder, you will help him to make me better. But if you are not angry\nwith me, Charles, why are you so grave?--you have not told me that; what\ncan you be thinking about?--do tell us!”\n\n“I am thinking,” he answered, “how delightful all this is!” he\ncontinued; “and on Monday how the scene will be changed!”\n\n“And why changed?” she inquired.\n\n“Because on Monday I return to school, and there, instead of having you\nand Mina to talk to, I shall be surrounded by a parcel of such noisy\nfellows.”\n\n“And you don’t like them, then?”\n\n“O yes, I do; that is to say, some of them--some of them are excellent\nfellows and I like them very much; but don’t let us talk of them now,\nlet us enjoy the present; Easter will come in time, and then I shall be\nhome again. You won’t forget me, Leila? will you promise me that?”\n\n“To be sure I will not, but it is needless to promise; do you think I\ncould forget the only brother I have in the world? You know I have\nalready told you, that now I do not think you too tall to be my brother;\nso you may grow as tall as ever you choose, and you will still always be\nmy brother.”\n\nWhen Leila was alone with her papa that evening, she immediately\nrecurred to what had taken place during the ride.\n\n“Papa,” she said, “I must have frightened you very much.”\n\n“You did, indeed, my love; I was extremely alarmed. You were not aware\nof what the fatal consequences might have been, and very rash indeed to\nurge on Selim as you did.”\n\n“Yes, and you will be more sorry, papa, when I tell you why--it was what\nyou call the foot of pride--it entered into me, papa, and I did it all\non purpose--yes, I whipped Selim on, that I might show off before\nCharles, and that he might admire my riding, and say how well I kept my\nseat: once I heard him say, that Selina kept her seat so well, and I\nwished him so much to say the same of me; you did not know this, papa?”\n\n“Yes, my love, I was aware of your motive, and you may therefore suppose\nwhat my feelings must have been, when I thought my child’s life might\nfall a sacrifice to her vanity and love of admiration.”\n\n“My life, papa?”\n\n“Yes, my dear Leila, you might not be aware of all the risk you ran, but\nit was God’s goodness alone that saved you; for you braved the danger,\nand it was great.”\n\n“O papa, how wrong I have been, and God might have punished me--He might\neven have taken my life, and He did not; yet He saw into my heart, and\nknew how vain and foolish I was--how can He love me, how can He forgive\nme?”\n\n“My Leila, God cannot love the sin, yet has He compassion on the sinner.\nDo you remember what St. John says--‘So God loved the world, that He\ngave His only-begotten Son, to the end that all that believe in Him\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life!’ and in the fourth\nchapter, he says, ‘Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He\nloved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.’ Yes,\nmy child, it is the righteousness of One who has never sinned, that is\nthis propitiation, which has been procured for us. In our own strength\nwe cannot walk; it is clad in the righteousness of our Saviour Jesus\nChrist alone, that we can stand in the presence of a pure and holy God;\nand we are also told, that ‘We have not an High Priest, which cannot be\ntouched with a feeling of our infirmities; but was, in all points,\ntempted like as we are, yet without sin.’ You may meet with those who\nwill tell you that vanity and pride are but trifling faults, mere human\nweaknesses; but do not listen to them--think often to what in your own\ncase they might have led; and, above all, try to keep ever in your mind\nthe example of Him whom you love and serve; think of His deep humility,\nHis meekness, His lowliness of heart; for our blessed Saviour not only\ndied for us, but He lived for us--He left the glory of His Father’s\nkingdom, to take our nature upon Him; that we might learn of Him; He has\ncompassion on our weaknesses, for He knew them all, and it is His\nexample that should ever dwell in our minds, as His sacrifice should\never dwell in our inmost hearts.”\n\n“But, papa, I know this--I know that our Saviour Jesus Christ was humble\nand meek, and I know He can see into my heart, and yet I have been\nfoolish and vain--it is so difficult--and then I am but a little child,\nhow can I follow so great an example?”\n\n“You can only do so by praying constantly for the grace of God to give\nyou strength; He can make the hardest duty easy to you; and for your\nencouragement you should think also of how your blessed Saviour loved\nlittle children. Do you remember that when the disciples were disputing\ntogether who should be the greatest, our Lord set a child before them as\nan example of the simplicity and humility of which He approved, and\nwhich He wished them to imitate? Strive then, my dearest Leila, to\nbecome a meek and humble child, such as your Saviour loves; kneel before\nHim in all your weakness, and from Him you will receive strength to help\nin time of need.”\n\nLeila threw her arms round her father’s neck, and softly whispered, “I\nwill try, papa, and you will also pray for me.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\n“Now there is only one day more,” Matilda exclaimed, as she darted into\nthe school-room, (which Mrs. Roberts had just left,) and clasped Selina\nround the neck so tightly as almost to choke her; “only one day more, my\nsweet sister _Demure_, and my punishment will be ended, and you will be,\nI do believe, as happy as I am; for I know you have not half enjoyed the\nstories without me, nor you either, Leila--now tell me, have you not\nmissed me very much?”\n\nBoth assured her that they had.\n\n“I knew it,” she continued, “for you are so tender-hearted; but I hope\nMrs. Roberts has been tender-hearted also, and that she has not begun to\nread to you the account of Lavalette’s escape yet: you know she said she\nwould abridge it for us, and last night, when I saw her writing, I was\nso afraid she would read it to you to-day--it would be very cruel of her\nif she has done so.”\n\n“But she was not cruel,” Leila answered quickly; “I think she stopped on\npurpose that you might be with us--to-day she only read to us some\nanecdotes of cats.”\n\n“Of cats! O I don’t care so much about cats; what could put that into\nMrs. Roberts’s head?”\n\n“I had been telling her of the sad fright Selina gave me last night,\nthat made her think of cats.”\n\n“And you did not tell me about Selina,” Matilda said, reproachfully;\n“though I don’t care much for other people’s cats, you know I always do\nfor yours--I like every thing that you like, Leila.”\n\n“Yes, I know you do; and you are not to look vexed now, for I don’t like\nthat; the reason I did not like to tell you was, that we began lessons\nthe moment I arrived, for I was later than usual to-day, because I staid\nto talk to Peggy Dobie about a bee-hive; I am going to get her a\nbee-hive; I have money for it now, and it will be ready for spring. She\nis so fond of bees; she says they are the best of company, an example to\nold and young, and the very hum of them is pleasant to her heart, and\nbrings back her thoughts to her own land, and to days long gone by.”\n\n“But what about Selina?” Matilda inquired.\n\n“O yes, I was almost forgetting to tell you. She gave me such a fright.\nYou know I am taming a linnet, for I read a story once about a little\nboy having tamed a linnet, and taught it to call persons by their names,\nand to imitate sounds, and whistle like nightingales and larks; and this\nlinnet lived for forty years, and was only killed by an accident; so I\nthought if my linnet lived for forty years, it would be a comfort to me\nin my old age; and now I daresay it will be, for you can’t think how\ntame it is getting since you saw it, and it seems to love me more and\nmore every day. Whenever I go into my room it flies to the side of the\ncage, and puts up its bill to kiss me, and then it hops down to the\ndoor, and stands watching till I open it and let it out. Yesterday,\nafter I had let it out, I put a saucer of water on the table, that it\nmight wash itself, for it likes so much to splash about in the water;\nand then I went into the drawing-room for a book. I staid a little, for\nI had opened the book at an interesting place, and I began to read, and\nforgot my dear little Mimi. Suddenly I heard something rush past me--it\nwas Selina with my bird in her mouth. She darted under the sofa quite\nout of sight; I did not dare to lift up the cover of the sofa, for I\nthought I should see Mimi torn to pieces. I covered my face with my\nhands, and was trembling to hear it scream. Oh, I was so frightened!\nand so dreadfully angry, if I had had a stick, I believe I could have\nkilled Selina. Think only if I had done it! My own Selina! I looked up\nand saw a strange cat with large eyes glaring at me: I flew at it, and\ndashed it out of the room in a great rage, and then Selina came softly\nout from below the sofa, and gently laid down Mimi quite safe at my\nfeet. It was to save it from this strange cat that Selina had run away\nwith it.”[A]\n\n [A] A fact.\n\n“Oh, what a dear creature!” Matilda exclaimed; “I do think no cat in the\nwhole world can be so delightful as Selina. What a comfort that you did\nnot hurt her. I was wishing so for a stick when you were telling it, I\nwould have dashed her to pieces in a moment; and even if I had not had\none, I think I would have trailed her out from below the sofa in some\nway or other. What a dreadful thing it would have been if I had killed\nher. But you see, Cousin Leila, we are a little like in some things, we\nboth wished for sticks.”\n\n“Yes, indeed, that is quite true; and I am sure you need never call me\ngood. Only the day before yesterday I almost lost my life, because I was\nfoolish and vain, and yesterday I might have killed a cat.”\n\n“But you did not.”\n\n“No, I did not; but I made papa very grieved, and he spoke to me a great\ndeal about it, and said that when these fits of anger were not\nrestrained in youth, they often led to the most dreadful crimes. He put\nme in mind of how I snatched my work out of Nurse’s hands, and danced\nupon it; and he said it grieved him to see that the same spirit of anger\noften possessed me, that though I was so much older now----”\n\n“Well, don’t let us talk about that,” Matilda said. “Did Mrs. Roberts\nread to you any thing interesting about cats, any thing worth telling?\nSelina, you have such a good memory, I daresay you can remember\nsomething worth telling me.”\n\n“Yes, she read us several anecdotes that I think you would have liked.\nShe read to us about a favourite cat that belonged to a Madame\nHelvetius. It never touched the birds which she kept, almost constantly\nlay at her feet, and seemed to be always watching over her, and would\nnever take any food but what she gave it. When Madame Helvetius died,\nthe poor cat was removed from her chamber, but it made its way there\nnext morning, got upon her bed, then upon her chair, slowly and\nmournfully passed over her toilet, and cried most piteously, as if\nlamenting her poor mistress; it refused all food, and after the funeral\nit was found stretched out on the grave quite dead.”\n\n“Oh, dear, what a melancholy story; I don’t think I would have cared\nmuch to hear that. Did Mrs. Roberts read you nothing better than that?\nnothing merry about cats?”\n\n“She read us also an anecdote which we thought interesting. A lady went\nto visit a friend in the country, and this friend had a favourite cat\nand dog; they were very fond of each other, ate together from the same\nplate, and slept on the same rug. Puss had kittens while the lady was\nstaying with her friend, and Pincher went regularly every day to visit\nthe kittens, whose nursery was at the top of the house. One morning\nthere was a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning; Pincher was in\nthe drawing-room, and the cat was watching her little family in the\ngarret. Pincher seemed quite frightened by the bright flashes of\nlightning, and trembled all over; and just as he had crept close to the\nvisitor, and laid himself down at her feet, (as if for protection,) some\none came into the drawing-room, followed by puss, who walked in with a\nmost disturbed air, and mewing with all her might, came up to Pincher,\nrubbed her face against his cheek, touched him gently with her paw, and\nthen walked to the door, stopped, looked back, mewed again, and seemed\nto say, as plainly as words could have done, ‘Do come with me, Pincher;’\nbut Pincher was too much frightened himself to give any comfort to poor\npuss, and took not the least notice of her invitation. She came back and\nrenewed her request with increased mewing. But the hard-hearted Pincher\nwas immovable, though he seemed perfectly to understand her meaning, for\nhe turned away his head with a conscious guilty look, and crept still\ncloser to the lady; and pussy, finding all her entreaties useless, left\nthe room. But soon after her mewing became so very piteous, that the\nlady could no longer resist going to see what was the matter. She met\nthe cat at the top of the stairs, close to her bed-room; she ran to her,\nrubbed herself against her, and then went into the room, and crept under\nthe wardrobe. A mewing was then heard as if from two voices, and the\nlady discovered that she had brought down one of her kittens and hidden\nit there for safety; but her mind being in an unhappy state of anxiety\nfor the kittens above, and this little one below, she had wished Pincher\nto have the kindness to watch by this one while she went for the others.\nShe seemed to trust, however, to having now found a better friend, for\nshe came out from below the wardrobe and hastily left the room. The\nlady followed, carrying with her the kitten, placed it with the others,\nand moved their little bed further from the window, through which the\nlightning had flashed so brightly as to alarm poor pussy, who then lay\ndown beside them quite happy, and the lady remained in the room till the\nsun shone out again, and all was quite calm. Next morning, to the lady’s\nsurprise, she found pussy waiting for her at the door of her bed-room;\nshe went down with her, sat by her, and caressed her in every possible\nway. Before that she had always been in the habit of going down to\nbreakfast with the lady of the house, but on this morning she had\nresisted all her coaxing, and would not move a step with her. As soon as\nbreakfast was over, she returned to her family in the garret; and she\nnever did this again. She seemed to think she had shown her gratitude\nand done her duty. But for a long time after she took very little notice\nof Pincher, and always looked distant and huffy when he came near her.”\n\n“Well,” Matilda said, “this anecdote is interesting; I should have liked\nvery much to hear Mrs. Roberts read it. But I am glad it is only about\nanimals that she is reading to you now, for it interests me much more to\nhear about men and women, and, above all, about children, especially\nwhen they get into scrapes.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nIt was a beautiful morning; Selina and Matilda had been allowed to\nbreakfast at Woodlands, and were to return to Elmgrove with Leila after\na visit to Peggy Dobie’s cottage, for the old gardener had promised to\nbe there by ten o’clock with the bee-hive, and he was faithful to his\nword, for, as they reached the cottage, they found Peggy opening the\nlittle wicket-gate leading to the garden, to admit him and his precious\nburden; the hive was safely placed in a sunny, sheltered corner, close\nto the green turf seat which Leila had erected for Peggy, and to witness\nher joy with the whole arrangement was delightful. She placed herself on\nthe turf seat, and with her hands clasped firmly together on her knees,\nshe kept gazing on the hive in a perfect ecstasy of delight.\n\n“Weel, my bairns,” she exclaimed, “you hae surely entered into a compact\nto spoil the auld woman all thegither. If there was a wish in my heart,\namang all the grand things, and the wonderfu’ blessings that surround\nme, it was for a bee’s skep; it is no’ to be told the love I hae for\nthae creatures, they will be friends to me, and company to me, and\nexample too, for they are a weel principled, upright set, never leaving\ntheir ain house, but for the useful work o’ the day; and sae blythe and\ncontented, for a constant singing that bonnie sang amang the flowers,\nthat’s just music to my ears. Can ony mortal man, or woman either, hae a\npleasanter employment than just to sit down afore a bee’s skep, and tak\nobservation o’ their wonderfu’ ways? and is there nae honourable mention\nmade o’ the work o’ their hands in the very Bible itsel’, Deuteronomy\nthirty-second chapter, thirteenth verse: ‘He made him ride on the high\nplaces of the earth, that he might eat the incense of the fields, and he\nmade him to suck honey out of the rock.’ And in the eighty-second Psalm,\nsixteenth verse: ‘He should have fed them also with the finest of wheat,\nand with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.’ Na, na,\nit’s no thae jams and jellies, and sic articles o’ man’s contrivance,\nthat ye hear tell o’ them, but it’s the handiwork o’ thae wonderfu’\ncreatures that’s had in honour; and I maun just end, as I began, and say\nto you, my dear bairns, that you could na hae given me a greater\ncompliment than this bonnie bee’s skep.”\n\n“But, Peggy,” Matilda observed, “we did not give it you, it was Cousin\nLeila; she saved up her money to buy it for you; we only came to see\nyour joy.”\n\n“Oh, but it is a dear bairn,” Peggy said, looking fondly at Leila, “and\nsae generous, and sae thoughtfu’ for her years. Weel, I am no just the\nwoman I was, for my head’s often unco confused now, and my memory’s no\no’ the best since that fearfu’ journey; but surely I’ll forget my\nainsel, afore I forget all she has done for me.”\n\n“Don’t say that,” Leila said anxiously, “don’t say you are not just the\nsame; you are looking as well as you ever did now, and you must be quite\nhappy and cheery,--I don’t like to see you look grave. We have never\nbeen grave since you came back, every day as merry and cheery as can be;\nand you have never told us yet if you saw all your friends in comfort\nbefore you came away from Scotland, and if you enjoyed yourself with\nthem very much.”\n\n“And did I no’, Miss Leila? ’Deed, ’tis no possible to say the pleasant\ntea drinkings I had afore I came away; but the very pleasantest of all\nwas the last night but ane afore I got into the awfu’ ship. It was at my\ncousin, Mrs Brown’s, and nae strangers but my ain kith and kind. There\nwas, forby hersel, just four o’ us. There was mysel, that’s ane; and\nthere was the twa Dobies, that’s twa; and there was Johnny, man, that’s\nthree; tuts, but there was four o’ us. There was Johnny, man, that’s\nane; and there was the twa Dobies, that’s twa; and there was mysel,\nthat’s three,--but there _was_ four o’ us; weel, I’ll begin wi’ mysel\nthis time. There was mysel, that’s ane; and the twa Dobies, that’s twa;\nand Johnny, man, that’s three; preserve me, for I am clean stupid all\nthegither! There was Johnny, man, that’s ane; and there was the twa\nDobies, that’s twa; and there was mysel, that’s three,--and if I am no\nat mysel again. Weel, and I maun gie it up all thegither; but I am\nmorally certain there was just four of us.”\n\nThe young people were in such fits of laughter that they could give\nPeggy no assistance whatever in this mysterious calculation; and Peggy\nherself joined heartily in the laugh, only remarking that they might see\nnow that sometimes she was no just sae clear as she used to be, but that\nony way it was a most pleasant party, and that there _was just four o’\nthem_.\n\nThey could have remained for ever talking with her, and, as Matilda\nobserved, had received most useful instruction in arithmetic, a far\nbetter way of adding up than she had been taught; but there were other\nlessons to be attended to, and most unwillingly they bid good-bye to\nPeggy, and proceeded on their way home. Leila, however, observed that it\nwould be almost as near to return by the village; she wished, so much,\nshe said, to ask Dame Burton how Lizzy was going on, and it was so\npleasant to see the little things running to meet them; besides, she\nadded, as they had a half holiday, they would still be home in time--so\nto the village they went. By the time they reached Dame Burton’s cottage\nthey had quite a little troop of rosy, laughing children following them,\nquite eager to be talked to and noticed; but Lizzy was not among them,\nnor did they see her with her mother on entering the house. Leila\ninquired for her, and hoped she had been going on well. Dame Burton\nshook her head. “Oh, Miss Howard,” she said, “Lizzy gives me much\nvexation of spirit, and I don’t know what course to take with that\nchild. I have a kind neighbour, who did much for me in a long illness,\nand it’s well my part to be kind to her now; she has an old mother, who\nis not able to get up very early, and at times, when this friend of mine\nhas any work to do which takes her out of her house, I send in Lizzy to\nhelp the old woman on with her clothes, and to be company to her; I will\nnot say that she is a very kindly old woman, she may give a sharp\nenough answer now and then to the children, but is that an excuse for\nwhat Lizzy did, and for the sight I saw?”\n\n“But what did you see?” Matilda eagerly inquired. “You have not told\nus.”\n\n“What did I see, miss? I saw the poor old woman sitting shaking on her\nchair with indignation and rage, her flannel petticoat tied round her\nneck, she neither able to stir hand or foot, and Lizzy off to her play!”\n\nThey all felt this act to be of a most atrocious nature, but the picture\nof the old woman tied up, as it were, in a flannel bag was too much, and\nthe difficulty of restraining their laughter was very great; Leila\nstruggled hard for composure: “It was very dreadful,” she said; “but\nwhere is Lizzy now?”\n\n“She is not far off,” Dame Burton answered, in a loud tone, as if she\nwished to be overheard by some one; “not far off, young ladies, and she\nis experiencing (as you shall see) a little of what she made other\npeople suffer; but she is young, I tell her, and better able to bear\nit.” She threw open the door of the adjoining room, and there sat little\nLizzy, propped up on a high stool in the middle of the floor, her little\nflannel petticoat tied round her neck, and her little face no longer\ndimpled with its accustomed smiles, but swelled with weeping; her look\nof shame and helpless distress, when she saw them enter, was too much;\nLeila could not stand it, she covered her face with her hands.\n\nSelina spoke aside for a few minutes to Dame Burton; “You will not\nforget to send her to Elmgrove,” they heard her say.\n\n“No, Miss Stanley; and I hope you may be able to make more impression on\nher than I can,” was her answer. Selina, then turning round to where the\nlittle culprit sat, undid the string of the little flannel petticoat,\ntook it off, wiped Lizzy’s eyes gently with her pocket-handkerchief, and\nlifting her down from the high stool, led her to her mother. The poor\nchild was weeping bitterly. She appeared most penitent, and as it seemed\nbetter that she should at that moment be left alone with her mother, the\nyoung people quitted the cottage.\n\nIn giving her old nurse an account of her day, which was Leila’s general\ncustom, she mentioned what had taken place with regard to Lizzy, and\nAmy, who was present, almost started off her chair with astonishment and\nindignation. “And is it possible,” she said, “that she could treat an\nold woman in that way? Oh, how very dreadful!”\n\n“Yes,” Nurse answered, “you may well be surprised and shocked, Amy, for\nit would be long before you would act in such a manner. You have always\nhad a becoming respect for your elders, and shown a quietness and\ndiscretion above your years. And now, Miss Leila, this should be an\nawful warning to you; you see to what the love of play may lead, and\nmust understand now why I always tried to root the evil out of your\nheart, and to settle you down to your work with serious reflection; and\nyou are far from what I could wish yet, you still give me many an\nanxious thought. There it was but the other day, when I gave you that\ncollar to trim; any well brought up young lady would have taken an\ninterest in having such a beautiful edging to sew on, and would have\narranged it properly in quarters, and pinned it before her hand, but\nthere were you rumpling it on as if it were a rag, putting all the\nfulness in the middle, not a thought of how you were to turn the\ncorners. Did it ever strike you that _that_ collar never could have been\nironed? Oh, Miss Leila, try to think more deeply of those things, before\nit is too late.”\n\n“But, Nurse,” Leila said, in a deprecating tone of voice, “though I am\nnot very fond of work, I am sure I never would have tied you up in a\nflannel _bag_!”\n\nNurse drew up her little fat round figure in a dignified manner. “Look\nat me, Miss Leila, am I the sort of person to be tied up in a flannel\nbag?”\n\nLeila thought it would be difficult.\n\nNurse continued,--“No, Miss Leila, I have always brought you up in\nproper habits of respect; but it was not of flannel bags we were\ntalking, but of that want of serious reflection when you take a piece of\nwork into your hands; there, about that _very_ collar, you had been\nquiet for a time, and I thought had settled down to it, when you\nsuddenly broke out with--‘Oh, Nurse! look at those clouds; did you ever\nsee any thing so beautiful? they are like magnificent mountains, bathed\nin golden light.’ What sort of nonsense was that, Miss Leila, to be\nseeing mountains in the clouds, instead of the work that was before you;\nand do you remember when I made you turn your back to the window, and\nsit with your face opposite to me, how you kept tapping your foot on the\nground with anger and indignation? but I am not wishing to vex you at\nthis moment, for I am sure the awful lesson of this day will make a\nproper impression; so sit down and let me see how quickly and how nicely\nyou will stitch round this pocket that I have cut out for you, for you\nknow I have no opinion of the new fangled way of bringing up young\nladies not to wear pockets, and with every thing belonging to them to be\nhunted for all over the house.”\n\n“Yes, Nurse,” Leila answered, “give it me, and you shall see how nicely\nI will do it; but when I told Lydia Mildmay that to wear a pocket was\nhighly respectable, she laughed at me very much.”\n\n“And did she really, Miss Leila? then I am sure she is a most improper\nand dangerous companion for you; and, indeed, I thought as much that day\nI saw her sailing about, sweeping all the carpets with those long\nflounces of hers. Now here is your work; sit down, and let me see how\nbusy you can be.”\n\nLeila seated herself. After a few minutes’ silence, she said, rather\ndoubtingly,--“But, Nurse, would not bags be better?”\n\n“Bags!” Nurse repeated in a displeased tone; “bags, Miss Leila, seem to\nrun strangely in your head to-day. And why should bags be better?”\n\n“Because,” Leila answered, “long ago they made use of bags.”\n\n“_They?_ of whom are you speaking. _Who_ made use of bags?”\n\n“The people of Nineveh. I saw them--they were little square bags; it was\nmore than three thousand years ago.”\n\nNurse looked up with a startled expression. “Saw the people of Nineveh!\nthree thousand years ago! Oh, Miss Leila! speak to me again; what are\nyou talking of? Do you feel any thing particular? what is the matter\nwith you?”\n\nLeila burst into a fit of laughter. “Why should I feel any thing\nparticular because I saw the people of Nineveh and they had bags? I saw\nthem on the bas reliefs.”\n\n“Bas leaf!” Nurse repeated, still more frightened. “Oh, Amy! she is not\nspeaking English! What has come over the dear child?”\n\nLeila struggled hard to regain her composure, for she saw her good old\nnurse was really getting seriously alarmed. “Nurse,” she said, “don’t be\nfrightened; I know quite well what I am saying. I saw the figures of the\npeople of Nineveh, carved on stones, at the British Museum. You know\npapa took me there, and he told me these stones had lain in the earth\nmore than three thousand years. You know Nineveh was overthrown. Do you\nremember the prophecy in the Bible? it says, ‘Nineveh is laid waste, who\nwill bemoan her?’ And it was laid waste--it was overthrown--they are\ndigging it up again now.”\n\n“Well, Miss Leila, I may not be a good judge of such matters, but I\nthink they had better let that alone, and not be bringing their evil\ndeeds to light again. You know the Bible also says,--‘Woe to the bloody\ncity, it is full of lies and robbery;’ and we are told to flee from it.”\n\n“Then I am afraid you will not like to go there and see those wonderful\nthings, and I asked papa if you might take Amy there.”\n\n“No, Miss Leila, I would rather not; and I can’t help thinking that the\nless she knows of the people of Nineveh the better; she can learn no\ngood lesson from them.”\n\n“But, Nurse, there are a great many other things to be seen at the\nMuseum besides--I am sure you would like to see the wild beasts and the\nbirds. Oh! the birds are so beautiful; how Amy would admire the little\nhumming-birds--they are scarcely bigger than the wild bees we had in the\nisland; they have such lovely feathers, purple, and green, and scarlet,\nand all beautiful bright colours. Papa says that when they are flitting\nabout amongst the flowers, they are quite splendid and dazzling to the\neye; and they shoot those dear little birds with little guns loaded with\nwater; the water does not injure their feathers by wounding them, it\nonly frightens them, and then they fall down and die. There were no\nhumming-birds in the island. I wish there had been--I would not have\nshot them, even with water, but I would have tried to catch them in some\nway without hurting them, and would have tamed them as I did my other\nbirds; I do hope you will go to the Museum, Nurse, and take Amy, she\nwill be so surprised, for I don’t think there is a bird in the whole\nworld that is not there; and I am sure you would like to see the owls,\nfor you like wise birds, and they look so wise; there were large owls,\nand little owls, and every kind, and one little owl near the corner of\nthe glass case had such a pretty face. Then there were beautiful\npheasants--and the argus-pheasant with its thousand eyes; oh! you must\ngo; Amy, would not you like it so much?”\n\n“Yes, Miss Leila, I would like it; but a bird with a thousand eyes, I\nthink it would frighten me.”\n\n“No, it would not,” Leila answered, smiling; “for it has not really a\nthousand eyes, it has only spots on its feathers; but it is a poetical\nway of speaking that----”\n\nNurse looked very grave. “How often have I told you, Miss Leila, that I\ndo not like a poetical way of speaking, and now you see the bad effects\nof it; from my experience, I knew that no bird had a thousand eyes, but\nAmy did not; you should speak to her in a way she can understand; but\nyou do run on so. Is there no possibility of making you think of what\nyou are about? I see clearly that pocket never will be finished.”\n\nLeila was silent for a moment, then jumping up from her seat, she held\nthe pocket up in the air in a triumphant manner, exclaiming,--“Now,\nNurse, look if I cannot both talk and stitch; see, it is quite finished,\nand beautifully done; and now I must go and sing to papa.”\n\n“She is a dear child,” Nurse observed, as she looked up for a moment\nfrom her work and followed Leila’s light steps with affectionate\ninterest; “and she is far from being a bad needle-woman either, though I\nshould like well to see her more steady, and taking a greater interest\nin it; but, Amy, though Miss Leila in most things sets you a most\nsuperior example, you must never talk as she does sometimes--you must\nnever be what she calls poetical. I would rather that she were not so\neither; but that is a matter for her papa to decide, not me.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nWeeks and months glided on. Spring, with its soft, tender, green, and\nmany blossoms, was spreading life and gladness over the earth, and Leila\nthought Woodlands a second Eden. The conservatory bloomed with plants of\nthe richest fragrance, and the balcony was gay with flowers of the\nbrightest hue; various beautiful creepers, with the sweet-scented\nhoneysuckle, forming arches over head; and Leila herself looked as fresh\nand blooming as the flowers, and as joyful as the skylark, as it soared\nwith its glad song into the blue vault of Heaven. She was never weary of\nadmiring the beautiful scenery by which she was surrounded, for early\nhabit had made the beauties of nature to her as a continual feast.\nSeveral of her birds were now in full song, and she spent many of her\nspare minutes in the conservatory. The precious seeds had come up all\nbut one, and she had now three thriving plants of Clara’s flower.\nCharles had not returned at Easter to mark their progress--he had gone\ninto a distant country to visit an uncle, a brother of Mr. Herbert’s,\nbut by Midsummer he would surely visit home, and she hoped they would be\nin full flower by that time, which would be for him a still greater\npleasure. Leila had, besides all this, other interests to occupy her.\nShe frequently visited the school with her Aunt Stanley and her cousins,\nand assisted the younger girls in the preparation of their tasks, and\nshe paid frequent visits to Peggy Dobie’s cottage, and to the village,\nwhere she made herself acquainted with all the wishes and wants of its\nvarious inmates. The Saturdays were generally spent by Selina and\nMatilda at Woodlands, when, during part of the morning, they assisted\nLeila in giving instruction to many of the village children in church\nmusic, for though Selina’s voice was not yet strong, her knowledge in\nmusic made her a most useful assistant. They also now took daily walks\nwith Mrs. Roberts in the fields, and generally returned loaded with wild\nflowers. Leila had become most successful in drying flowers so as to\npreserve their bright colours. The field flowers, assisted by her papa,\nshe arranged in books in botanical order; but with the flowers from the\nconservatory and the garden she often ornamented screens, producing a\nwonderfully fine effect, superior to any painting, fixing them on with\ngum, and grouping them together in a most beautiful manner. Matilda\noften tried to imitate Leila in this, but she did not succeed, her\nflowers always lost their bright tints, they grew white, or they grew\nblack, but they never grew beautiful; the stalks never would bend\ngracefully, they would always stick straight up; the gum would always go\non in patches, never smoothly, and she complained that though she put on\na great deal of gum, some of the leaves would not stick at all, so she\ngenerally ended by getting into a rage, and dashing her hair pencil all\nover the paper.\n\n“Do tell me, Leila, how you manage so well,” she said one morning, as\nshe stood admiring a couple of fine screens which Leila had just\nfinished for Mrs. Herbert. “Those different coloured geraniums seem to\nme to look brighter even than when they were in the conservatory; and\nhow gracefully the stalks are bent, and the flowers hanging down so\nnicely, just as if they were still growing; and those leaves and ferns\nare of such a beautiful green, and look so well mixed with the bright\ncolour of the flowers. My green leaves always turn a dull yellow, or\nbrown, or something abominable; and as to the blue convolvulus, that\nprovokes me more than any thing. Look at yours, they are as bright as\nwhen they grew in the garden, and when I try to dry them, the colour\ngoes away altogether, and they get to be a dirty white. I cannot get any\nthing to do well but yellow buttercups, and that is such a common\nflower. All this provokes me so, I have no patience for it. No one will\never give me a sovereign for the poor,[B] for a couple of screens, as\nthey did to you, and I wish so much that they would.”\n\n [B] A fact.\n\n“But you know,” Leila answered, “that was only because it was a sale of\nladies’ work for the poor. My screens were not worth that.”\n\n“I don’t know; they were most beautiful, and I heard every one saying\nso, for I stood near the counter where they were that I might hear them\npraised; and when that gentleman with the nice face took them up and the\nlady told them they were done by a little girl, he said that little girl\ndeserved to be encouraged, and he paid down the sovereign in a minute.\nOh! I was so glad; but though I cannot earn a sovereign, I might earn\nsomething if you would only tell me what I must do to dry them as you\ndo.”\n\n“Yes, I will tell you every thing I can; but I think the great matter is\nbeing very patient.”\n\n“But, Cousin Leila, I am sure you are not very patient.”\n\n“Yes, I know that; papa often says I am too impetuous.”\n\n“Well,” Matilda observed, “and does not that just mean that you have no\npatience?”\n\nLeila coloured. “I suppose it does,” she said; “but in some things I\nhave patience, I am always very patient about flowers; to be sure, that\nis not wonderful, for in the island they were like friends to me. I used\nto visit them two or three times in the day to see how they were getting\non, and to talk to them, as if they were alive, and I often knew the\nhour of the day by their opening and shutting.”\n\n“And do any of the flowers here open and shut at certain hours?” Matilda\ninquired.\n\n“Yes, some of them do; but I don’t know the flowers here so well; one\nkind of evening primrose opens its flowers every day a quarter of an\nhour before sunset; and the chickweed, which you see me so often\ngathering for my birds, seems to me to open both leaves and flowers\nevery morning at nine o’clock, and closes its flowers again for some\ntime at twelve, and will not open them at all if it rains; then in the\nevening it always seems to be making itself comfortable for the night,\nfor the leaves all down the stalk shut up to cover the young shoots,\njust as if it were putting a great many night-caps on them to keep them\nwarm.”\n\n“How very curious,” Matilda said; “but, Leila, we are forgetting that\nyou were to tell me more about drying flowers. I know I need never try\nto gain a sovereign like you; but if I could even gain half-a-crown or\neven a shilling sometimes, it would be such a comfort, for I am always\ngetting into such scrapes about my money for the poor; somehow it always\nmelts away; both you and Selina contrive to save a little every week.”\n\n“But I have more pocket-money than you have.”\n\n“Yes, you have; but still I know I ought to save something, and often I\ncannot; it is all the fault of those trumpery shops. When I go to\nRichmond there are so many pretty things which I wish for; and then I am\nso often hungry and must have some bunns, you know,--how do you manage\nso well?”\n\n“I don’t manage very well--I often buy bunns also; but when I wish for\npretty things which cost much, I remember that Nurse says ‘I should turn\naway mine eyes from beholding vanity,’ and then I try not to look at\nthem, but very often I do. You know the other day when I saw that\nbeautiful basket I did not turn away. I looked at it so long, and then I\ntook it in my hand and turned it round and round, and thought it so\nbeautiful, that I could not resist buying it. And now I don’t like it at\nall; for it cost so much that I shall not be able to save any of my\npocket-money this week.”\n\n“Well, that was wrong, to be sure, and just what I should have done\nmyself; but don’t be melancholy about it now, for you have always money\nbeforehand, so it does not much signify for one week; so do tell me how\nI am to earn half-a-crown, and how I am to dry flowers in a most\nbeautiful manner; you say patience is the chief thing. Will patience\nmake them keep their colour? now do tell me that.”\n\n“Yes,” Leila answered, “it will; and I will tell you how. Very often\nwhen it clears up after rain, and the flowers look very bright, you wish\nto gather them for drying--I always tell you that it is a bad time, but\nstill you often try to do it--and they get quite dim and discoloured,\nand you are obliged to throw them away. Now when I wish to dry them, I\nwait till it has been quite fair for several days, and when it is bright\nand sunny, and there is no damp in the air, I gather the flowers. I\nalways choose those that are very bright and fully blown, but before\nthey have begun to fade in the slightest degree. If they have a decayed\nspeck no bigger than the head of a pin, do not gather them, for they\nwill not be bright when dried.”\n\n“And what more do you do?”\n\n“I put them between folds of close smooth writing-paper, never into\nblotting-paper.”\n\n“But Lydia told me it should be blotting-paper.”\n\n“No, I have tried that; but the blotting-paper seems to suck the colour\nout of them. Well, I place those papers between the leaves of a book,\nand tie it tight up with a ribbon, and put it under a weight; if it is a\nvery tender flower, such as the blue convolvulus, for instance, then you\nmust not put a very heavy weight, the weight must be in proportion to\nthe tenderness of the flower. Next day I change the papers that there\nmay be no damp about them, for nothing spoils their colour so much as\ndamp. Now all this, you see, takes patience; for sometimes I have to\nchange the papers more than once.”\n\n“Yes,” Matilda observed, “and such patience, that I am sure I shall\nnever be able to do it. And this is all then?”\n\n“No; in putting the flowers into dry bits of paper you must do it very\ngently, that they may lie quite smooth; for much of their beauty depends\non their looking smooth, and not shrivelled up in any way; and I forgot\nto tell you that sometimes before putting them in at all, I bend the\nstalks a little to make them lie gracefully. The stalks of the geraniums\nare so stiff and straight, that I am obliged to take off the\nflower-heads, and put them in papers by themselves, and then I flatten\nthe stalks and bend them a little before I begin to dry them. The ferns,\nwhich you like so much, grow so gracefully, that I seldom have to bend\nthem at all, but just to lay them on paper as they grow. The young ferns\nof a bright tender green do best: indeed, all green leaves should be\ndried when they first come out, before they have got to be a deep\ncolour, for green is a very difficult colour to dry well; most yellow\nflowers do very well, the yellow crocus keeps very bright; indeed, some\nscarlet and rose-coloured geraniums dry beautifully, and other scarlets\nwon’t dry at all,--you must just get acquainted with those that do well,\nand with those that don’t.”\n\nMatilda groaned. “My hopes are quite dying away; half-a-crown!--I don’t\nthink I shall be able to earn sixpence even;--but it is sunny and bright\nnow, we might go into the garden, and you could gather some of the\nflowers which do best, and show me how you lay them on the paper--I\nthink I have seen you working away with a long pin; but if I were to\ntake a pin in my hand, I should be sure to run it through the flowers\nif they would not lie the right way, for I should be so provoked.\n\n“Well, that is why I say that the chief thing is patience; you would\nquite spoil the flower if you even scratched it with the pin. I take the\npin to help me to guide the leaves to lie right; for sometimes when I\nlay down the branch on the paper, all the leaves get crowded together,\nand I have to separate them, and sometimes to pluck off one or two.”\n\n“It is most horribly difficult, I can see that; however, let us go into\nthe garden; perhaps, if I see you do it, I might still try.”\n\n“But, Matilda, it won’t do to gather flowers to dry to-day; you forget\nthat it rained in the night, and that this morning even there was a\nslight shower.”\n\nMatilda shrugged her shoulders. “What a business! better give it up\naltogether, and especially if I am to bear in mind every time it rains.\nWhen the rain is over, I am too glad to forget it,--who ever thinks of\nrain when the sun is shining? not _I_--I always feel sure it is never to\nrain again; and so all my little plans for goodness must be given up,\nand I must just go on buying bunns till I am older, and then perhaps I\nshall not be so hungry, and shall not care for them so much.”\n\nLeila smiled but shook her head. “Now don’t talk in that way, Matilda,\nfor you know very well it is not right, and you do not mean to go on\nspending all your money on bunns; you could not be happy if you did; you\nonly say so to make me laugh; but come, let us go into the garden, and I\ncan show you what flowers do best for drying, and then when it is fine\nwe can gather them, and I will help you to put them in paper. I am sure\n_you_ also could make money by it.”\n\n“Oh, you are a darling!” Matilda exclaimed; “and again my hopes are\nrising, _rising_--sixpence--a shilling--half-a-crown. Oh! there will be\nno counting the money I shall make. I shall have quite too much for the\npoor, and be able to treat you all with bunns into the bargain; now that\nis what I call generous.”\n\nThey found Mrs. Roberts and Alfred in the garden, Alfred flying at full\nspeed as if in pursuit of something. “Don’t stop me, Matilda, don’t. Now\nit is going to settle on that rosebush--no, it is not--yes, it is\nhovering--now don’t move, don’t make a noise; now I have him;”--and he\nheld up a large dragon-fly between his fingers.\n\nMatilda screamed. “Oh! let him go, Alfred--do let him go--he will sting\nyou; only see how he is putting out that long frightful sting. I see his\nsting quite plain.”\n\n“No, Matilda, you need not be afraid, he cannot hurt me, for he has no\nsting. Mrs. Roberts told me that was a vulgar error.”\n\n“Did you tell Alfred that?” Matilda inquired, turning to Mrs. Roberts;\n“but how can that be when I see it? and he is pushing it out every\nmoment in a most frightful manner; only look, Mrs. Roberts.”\n\n“Yes, I see what you mean, Matilda; but that movement in its body is\nonly the effort the poor dragon-fly is making to escape; it is a\nperfectly harmless insect, for it has no instrument with which it can\nsting.”\n\n“Then if you are quite sure of that,” Matilda said, eagerly, “I should\nlike to look at him nearer. Stop, Alfred, and let me see. Oh! what a\nbeautiful creature he is, and with four such lovely wings; when the sun\nshines upon them they seem to change colour like mother-of-pearl. Now\nthat I know he has no sting I think him a perfect beauty, and before I\nused to run away from a dragon-fly as if it had been a wild beast; and\nthey do look rather fierce though they are beautiful, for they have such\na way of darting down so suddenly. Sometimes I have watched them flying\nacross the pond at the bottom of the garden, and they dart down so low,\nthey seem as if they were dropping into the water.”\n\n“Yes,” Mrs. Roberts observed, “that is because they chiefly live upon\nwater insects; with those large eyes they can discern their prey at a\ngreat distance, and then dart down upon it; but it is a bold insect and\na voracious one also, and I have seen it sometimes attack a butterfly\nfully as large as itself and tear it to pieces. It lives, however,\nchiefly on small water insects, and seizes upon them as they skim along\nthe surface of the water; but another reason why one so often sees\ndragon-flies in the neighbourhood of ponds and ditches is, that the\ndragon-fly itself passes its young state in the water, and those small\nones which you have often seen near ponds are those which have just left\ntheir former state and become winged insects.”\n\n“Yes, I know all about that,” Alfred said; “Mrs. Roberts told me about\nthe larva and about the pupa skin, like a little box, that they crawl\nout of, and then fly off; it was very interesting. Now I will let this\none fly away, and show you what she has made for me, I hid it behind\nthat big flower-pot till I required it again; see, it is a little net of\ncoarse muslin, sewed round this circle of wire, and I fixed the pole to\nit myself; it is for fishing in the pond for larva. Mrs. Roberts, might\nwe go now and try for some, and then you could tell Cousin Leila and\nMatilda more about it?”\n\n\nMrs. Roberts gave a willing assent, and to the pond they all proceeded.\n\n“Now, Alfred,” Matilda said, “do give me the net; I daresay you have had\nit for a long time to-day, and I should like so much to fish for larva,\nfor I want so much to know what larva is.”\n\nAlfred looked a little disappointed, but yielded up the net, saying\nonly, “Now, Matilda, do take care of it, please, for it will be easily\nbroken.”\n\n“Never fear, little man, you are so easily frightened; do you think I\ndon’t know how to take care of a fishing-net? Now stand aside a little\nand you shall see.” She plunged it vigorously into the pond, the net\nfilled with mud, she could scarcely draw it out again; little Alfred\nbecame very red, and was near getting into a passion, but a look from\nMrs. Roberts, as she pronounced his name, restrained him; he took the\nnet from Matilda, and having washed it out carefully, put it into\nLeila’s hands, saying, “Now it is your turn, Cousin Leila, to try for\nlarva.”\n\nLeila did try, but she was not much more successful than Matilda, the\nnet still came up half filled with mud, for she plunged it down too\nhastily; besides, the water had been much disturbed.\n\nMatilda clapped her hands. “How glad I am!” she exclaimed.\n\nMrs. Roberts looked towards her; but a look, however impressive, was\nseldom sufficient for Matilda.\n\n“Yes,” she continued, “I am glad; for it is a comfort to me that though\nCousin Leila is so patient about flowers, she is not in the least\npatient about larva.”\n\nLeila coloured, but said nothing.\n\nMatilda looked at her for a moment, then throwing her arms round her\nneck, she said,--“Oh! I am a wretch to vex you, and just at the very\nmoment too when you have been so kind to me about the flowers; but kiss\nme, Leila, and don’t let us think any more about it; there, Alfred, do\nyou wash out the net again, and dip it in the right way, and let us see\nthe larva and talk about it.”\n\nAlfred obeyed, and having gone to the other side of the pond where the\nwater had not been disturbed, he dipped the net very gently in, and soon\nbrought up a large muddy-looking insect.\n\nMrs. Roberts looked at it attentively. “You have been in good luck,\nAlfred,” she said, “for you have got the larva of the great dragon-fly,\nthe very same species you caught in the garden. This species is fond of\nconcealing itself in the mud, and lies in wait there till it pounces on\nany insect that comes in its way.”\n\n“But it seems to move so slowly,” Matilda observed, “that I should think\nthat if the other insects were the least bit clever, they could easily\nget out of its way. They must stand still, silly things, to be\ndevoured.”\n\n“No, Matilda, you are deciding too hastily. The poor insects are in much\ngreater danger than you are aware of. This slow-looking gentleman has a\nmost curious apparatus at his command that you are not yet acquainted\nwith. He has very large jaws which are covered with a kind of mask. Look\nat this horny substance which covers its face.”\n\n“So much the better that it does cover its face,” Matilda said; “for I\nam sure it must be a frightfully ugly one. But what more does it do?”\n\n“When it pleases it can let down this mask, which has claws at the end,\nsimilar, though on so small a scale, to the claws of a lobster. When it\nsees its prey within reach, it darts out these claws, and in a moment\nconveys the poor insect to its mouth. Then it has a way of bringing the\ninsects nearer to itself. Do you see those five sharp little points at\nthe tail? it has the power of drawing in and pushing out the water by\nopening and shutting them; this produces a slight current in the water,\nwhich floats the small insects within its reach.”\n\n“It is a cunning, cruel wretch,” Matilda said, “and I don’t understand\nhow such a horrid creature as that can ever become that beautiful\nharmless dragon-fly; but did you ever see it in its pupa state? does it\nbegin to grow good then?”\n\n“Why, as to that, Matilda, it moves and eats in its pupa state just as\nit does now. I am afraid you would not think there was much improvement;\nbut it is from instinct, not cruelty, that it makes use of those means\nto procure food. You forget that we too take the life of many animals to\nprocure our food, and often, I am afraid, in an unjustifiably cruel\nmanner. But you ask me if I have ever seen the dragon-fly in its pupa\nstate. I did once, and it was very curious indeed.”\n\n“Do tell us about it; how I wish I could see it too. I hope it was not\nso ugly as this larva creature.”\n\n“It certainly was more curious than beautiful; it was attached to the\nbranch of a shrub, and at first it seemed to me as an insect with two\nbodies, with the head and eyes of a dragon-fly.”\n\n“What a monster,” Matilda exclaimed, “worse even than the larva.”\n\n“No; on looking at it more attentively, I saw it was on the point of\nescaping from its pupa case, so I sat down and watched it for some time.\nIts wings were folded up on its back in a wonderfully small space. At\nfirst they looked quite short, but as it cleared itself from its pupa\nskin, the wings gradually expanded; it seemed, however, too weak to fly.\nIt slowly crawled to another branch of the shrub, and there remained, as\nif resting from its labours.”\n\n“And did you not see it fly?”\n\n“No; I was obliged soon after to leave the garden, and when I returned\nit was gone, probably enjoying in the air its new state of existence.\nThe pupa case alone remained, and was not the least broken or injured by\nthe dragon-fly having made its escape. It looked quite transparent; on\ntrying to remove it, I found it was attached to the branch by two little\nclaws which projected from that part of the case which covered each\nleg.”\n\n“Oh, how beautiful, and how wonderful!” Leila exclaimed, her whole\ncountenance beaming with intelligence.\n\nMatilda, while Mrs. Roberts was giving them this account, had looked at\nLeila once or twice with some anxiety; their eyes now met; Leila’s sunny\nsmile quite reassured Matilda, and she whispered in her ear, “You dear\none, you are more beautiful to me than a hundred dragon-flies; and I am\nso glad that you have not wings, and that you cannot fly away from me.”\n\n“Now, Alfred,” Mrs. Roberts said, “put by your net carefully.”\n\n“May I not fish just once more, and try for the larva of the gnats and\ncaddis worms which you promised to tell me about?”\n\n“No, not to-day; at another time you shall do so.”\n\nMrs. Roberts took Alfred by the hand and turned towards the house, while\nLeila and Matilda took their way to the flower beds; Matilda with most\nsanguine anticipations of the money she was about to make.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nOn the following Saturday, Nurse, having some commissions to execute in\nRichmond, and the weather being uncommonly fine, Leila and her cousins\nwere allowed to accompany her. Matilda had for some days before been\npursuing most actively her new method of drying flowers, and had already\ntied up and placed in all sorts of odd corners half the books in her\npossession filled with them; and as they had all received that morning\ntheir weekly allowance of pocket-money, she felt quite elated, not only\nby the riches of which she was in actual possession, but by the\ncountless sums she now felt sure of acquiring.\n\nIn this dangerous state of mind poor Matilda was ill prepared for the\ntrial which awaited her, for some of Nurse’s commissions were to be\nexecuted in the very shop which had so often proved a scene of\ntemptation to her. She entered it with many good resolutions. Reels of\ncotton were wanted by the whole party, and reels of cotton _only_\nMatilda was determined to buy. Leila and Selina each selected a pretty\nlittle box filled with them; but Matilda’s eyes wandered all over the\ncounter. Alas! that so many bright little eyes should so often wander\nover forbidden ground. A most tempting, and a much more beautiful box\nthan those selected stood open before Matilda; in addition to reels of\ncotton it had also scissors and a thimble. It was not at all too large,\nand it was not at all dear; indeed, she thought it most wonderfully\ncheap, and she opened and shut it again several times in great\nadmiration.\n\nSelina whispered, “You had better put it away, Matilda; you know it is\nonly reels of cotton you require.”\n\n“No, Selina,” she said, “you are quite mistaken; you forget that I could\nnot find my thimble this morning; I looked every where for it, and lost\nso much of my time; and see only how I have hurt my finger with sewing\nwithout one, it is quite red; you would not wish me to do that again, I\nam sure; so I must buy a thimble, and it is only the scissors in\naddition, you know.”\n\n“But, Matilda, your thimble is only mislaid; it will be found I am sure.\nI saw it on your finger yesterday.”\n\n“But you did not see it to-day, Selina, and I tell you it is quite\nlost; I looked a long time for it.”\n\n“But do consider, Matilda,” Selina said, very gently; “to buy this\nwork-box will require almost all the money you have. Only twopence will\nremain.”\n\nMatilda coloured. Only twopence. She seemed to hesitate, and pushed the\nbox a little way from her; but suddenly brightening up, and drawing it\ntowards her again, she said, “Selina, you quite forget the money I am\nnow quite sure of making, for I dare say I have now near a hundred\nflowers, which I know quite well will be beautiful.”\n\n“But you cannot be sure, Matilda, that you will be able to make money in\nthat way.”\n\n“And why should I not be sure? You are so prudent, Selina, that it just\nprovokes me. Why should I not be able to make money as well as Leila, if\nmy flowers are beautiful? I am sure I have taken trouble enough with\nthem, and patience too; you might praise me, I think, a little for that,\ninstead of wishing to take all my pleasures from me in this way; and it\nis such a useful thing to buy, and when I tell you too that I have lost\nmy thimble; but don’t say any more about it, for I am determined to buy\nit. It is not as if I were buying a foolish thing; this box will be most\nuseful to me.” She took it up as she spoke, and moved to another corner\nof the shop.\n\nThe work-box was soon carefully wrapped up in paper and paid for, and\nthey all proceeded on their way. Having executed several other\ncommissions, Nurse proposed that they should rest for a little in a\nbaker’s shop, where each might have a bunn, as the hour of luncheon\nwould have passed before they could return home. This they all thought\nan excellent plan.\n\nThey were soon seated and enjoying their bunns, and Matilda had just\ndeclared that she meant to be prudent now, and though she was very\nhungry indeed, she would only allow herself one bunn, and would keep the\nother penny in case of accidents, when a little girl, carrying a basket\ntied over with a napkin, entered the shop. She looked very pale and\nthin, and her clothes, though neither dirty nor ragged, were scanty and\nmuch patched. As the baker was at the moment serving a customer, she\nrested the basket on the ground as if much fatigued, and stood silently\nwaiting by the counter. A broken piece of roll lay upon it. She gathered\nup a few stray crumbs, which she put in her mouth, and they saw her then\nstretch out her thin little hand as if to take the roll also, but she\ndid _not_; on the contrary, she pushed it further from her and turned\naway. The baker seemed to have perceived the action, for he said,\npushing it towards her, “You may have that piece of roll if you are\nhungry.”\n\nThe child’s eyes glistened, she seized the roll and began eagerly to eat\nit; suddenly she stopped, and looked anxiously at what remained, and put\nit in her pocket. By this time Leila’s attention was much excited. The\nchild, pointing to the basket, spoke aside to the baker, who was now\ndisengaged, but in so low a tone she could not make out what she said.\nThe man shook his head as he replied, though also in a low tone, as if\nunwilling to be overheard by them, “No, no, we never buy cats; take it\naway; it is out of the question.”\n\nThe child spoke again, and with a look of much entreaty; Leila thought\nshe could distinguish the words, _loaf_--starving.\n\n“Well,” the man said, “I don’t know as to a loaf; let me see, its skin\nmight be worth that;” and he put out his hand as if to take the basket.\n\nThe child shuddered violently, and snatching it hastily up, she\nproceeded towards the door. She stopped, hesitated, and turning back,\nshe pushed the basket towards him, saying in an excited voice, “Take it\nout, don’t let me see it; its legs are tied, give me the loaf.” She\nturned from him, covered her face with her hands, and burst into tears.\n\nThe young people all rose, and in a moment were around her. Matilda\npushed aside the napkin which covered the basket, and there lay a\nbeautiful large cat, with its legs tied together in a most pitiable\nmanner.\n\n“Oh, how cruel,” Leila exclaimed, “to tie its legs!--and why, little\ngirl, did you wish to sell your cat?--who did you say was starving?”\n\nThe child made no answer; she was sobbing violently.\n\n“Poor little girl,” Leila said, in her soothing, gentle voice, “compose\nyourself! Don’t cry; we are not angry with you; we are sure you have\ndone nothing wrong--do speak to us;--who did you say was starving?”\n\n“My mother and all of us,” she gasped out; “we have not a morsel of food\nin the house; we have had no breakfast; oh, give me the loaf, and let me\ngo home!”\n\nLeila looked at her with a distressed and agitated countenance; “I have\nfrightened her,” she said; “I spoke harshly to her. What can we do for\nher, Selina?--do tell me!”\n\nThey spoke together aside for a few minutes. “Yes,” Leila continued,\nturning towards the little girl again, “I am sure that is the best thing\nto be done; Nurse always says tea is so refreshing. Don’t cry, little\ngirl, pray don’t!--your cat is not to be sold, and your mother and all\nof you are to have a nice breakfast; we are going to buy tea, and sugar,\nand butter, and everything that is good; and the baker will give us two\nlarge loaves; we have plenty of money to pay for every thing.”\n\nWhile this conversation was going on, Matilda had stood beside the\nlittle girl, feeding her with what remained of her own bunn; stuffing\npiece after piece into her mouth, and almost choking her.\n\n“And this is all I can do,” she said; “and I cannot help you, Leila and\nSelina, in buying butter, and tea, and sugar; I have nothing left but\nthis abominable penny;”--and she threw it on the ground in uncontrolled\ndistress--“oh, what a hard-hearted, extravagant, sinful, wretched,\nhorrid girl I have been!”\n\nLeila lifted the poor rejected penny from the ground, and whispered in\nher ear, “Don’t be in such a state, Matilda; try to bear it; you know I\ndid just the same about the basket. We have both been very wrong, but we\ncan both repent. You know that is the right thing to do. And this penny\ncan still do a little good; take it, Matilda; you might buy a bunn with\nit for the mother; I am sure she would like a bunn better than the\nbread.”\n\nBut Matilda was not to be comforted; she bought the bunn, and wrapped it\ncarefully up in paper; but as she got into the street, she entreated\nNurse to go back with her to the shop where she had purchased the\nwork-box. She wished, she said, to ask the man to take it again, and\ngive her back the money. Nurse thought it very doubtful that this would\nbe agreed to; but she yielded to Matilda’s entreaties, and they went\nback to the shop. The master was very civil; he said they never took\nback goods that had been paid for, they were obliged to make a rule not\nto do so; he seemed, however, in this instance, to be inclined to yield,\nand Matilda’s eyes sparkled with joy, when he took the work-box from her\nhand, and undid the paper; but on seeing it he shook his head--“I was\nanxious to oblige you, young lady,” he said, “but in this case it is\nimpossible--this work-box has been injured, it has got a fall.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” Nurse answered, (for poor Matilda was now unable to speak,)\n“it did get a fall; I told Miss Matilda she had better not undo the\npaper in the street, but we cannot expect young people to be wise all at\nonce; but I am quite sure of one thing, she did not know it had been\ninjured, for we both examined it, and were not aware it had been\nscratched at all.”\n\n“No, of course not; no need of an apology, madam;” and as he spoke, he\ncarefully wrapped the unfortunate box up in a fresh piece of paper,\nand, with a low bow, put it into Matilda’s hands.\n\nPoor Matilda, she could scarcely articulate, as turning from the shop\nshe said,--“And it was my own fault, I would take it out of the paper;\noh, what a day of misfortunes, surely no one was ever so unfortunate as\nI am!”\n\nLeila whispered, “You forget, Matilda, about Rosamond and the purple\njar.”\n\n“Oh, but that was not half so bad, don’t say it was, Cousin Leila; she\nhad only holes in her shoes to vex her; she had not a whole houseful of\nstarving people--no, no,--no one was ever so unfortunate as I am; don’t\ntry to comfort me, it makes me much worse.”\n\nThe scene which presented itself on entering the house to which the\nlittle girl conducted them, was certainly not calculated to lessen her\nsorrow. All within the house bore the marks of extreme poverty. A pale,\nemaciated woman was seated on a low stool, endeavouring to lull to sleep\na sickly-looking infant; a girl, apparently some years older than the\nchild who accompanied them, sat on the side of a miserable-looking bed,\n(the only one the room contained,) knitting busily: her features were\npretty, but she kept her eyes cast down; and though she seemed to listen\neagerly to what was said, she took no further notice of their entrance.\nThe woman had risen, and was endeavouring to silence three clamorous\nlittle urchins, who all ran towards the door when it opened, loudly\nexclaiming, “Why did you take away Tiny--what have you done with\nher?--have you brought no bread as you promised? we have had no\nbreakfast yet!” They shrank back on seeing the strangers.\n\nNurse gave a glance around the room; its contents were not numerous. A\nsmall tea-kettle stood by the almost empty grate, in which a few sparks\nof fire still lingered. She went out, taking the eldest of the little\nboys with her, and soon returned with a supply of wood. A fire was\nkindled, and in a wonderfully short space of time, (for Leila and her\ncousins assisted,) a few cups and bowls were collected together, and the\nchildren were all assembled round a small table, devouring bread and\nbutter as fast as it could be prepared for them, and anticipating the\ndelight of having warm tea. The eldest girl was also seated at the\ntable, but still kept her eyes cast down. The mother, observing the\ninquiring glances which were cast towards her, explained that she was\nblind; but she added, “My poor Susan is of the greatest assistance to\nme; ever since her father’s death, she has worked late and early; her\nknitting has been our chief support, and when I can get a day’s work at\na time, she keeps the poor baby: but she is sorely changed, her health\nis suffering; she is not like the same girl she was when times were\nbetter with us, for we were well to do in the world, till the fever came\namongst us, and he that was always help and comfort to us all, was taken\naway.”\n\n“And was poor Susan always blind?” Leila inquired.\n\n“No, my young lady; your own eyes were not brighter than hers were for\nthe first seven years of her life; but she took the small-pox--for,\nalas! I had neglected to have her vaccinated--indeed I had a prejudice\nagainst it, and many and many a bitter thought that prejudice has cost\nme.”\n\nThe tears were running down poor Susan’s face, as her mother gave this\nrecital. They all looked at her with much interest; suddenly their\nattention was arrested by one of the little boys sliding down from his\nstool, and exclaiming, as he ran round the table and took the hand of\neach of them in succession, “Thank you, good ladies, for our nice\nbreakfast;”--but as he approached Matilda, she pushed him from her--“O\nno, no,” she said, “do not thank me; I can bear it no longer!”--and she\nran out of the room. Selina followed her.\n\nIn a few minutes they both returned, Matilda looking quite composed,\nthough sorrowful: she went up to the blind girl, and, in a low voice,\ntried to enter into conversation with her; but it was the greatest\npossible relief to Matilda, when, soon after, Nurse said it was time to\nreturn home; assuring the poor woman, at the same time, she would speak\nto her master about her, and she was sure he would give her some\nassistance.\n\nOn entering the house, on their return, Matilda followed Leila to her\nroom. “Leila,” she said, “you must keep this work-box for me, and put it\nout of my sight, for I cannot bear to look at it. This has been a sad\nday for me; I don’t think I ever was so unhappy before, as when I saw\nthat blind girl knitting so fast with her poor thin fingers, and looking\nso starved: and when I thought I had given all my money for this\nwork-box, and bought it though Selina so often told me not to do it, and\nthat I would repent--O I am a monster!--don’t you think so, Leila?”\n\n“No, Matilda; don’t say so; a monster is a wild beast--you are not the\nleast like one--and you are repenting; you cannot do more now than that,\nand you should be thankful you are not a wild beast, for then you could\nnot repent.”\n\n“And then to eat that bunn in such good spirits, what do you say to\nthat?”\n\n“But you did not eat in very good spirits; you were sorrowful before the\nend, and gave half away.”\n\n“Yes, half; but what is that, and a whole houseful of people\nstarving--six children and a mother, you know. O don’t try to comfort\nme, it makes me much worse: I would rather you had said I had been as\nbad as possible.”\n\n“No, Matilda, I cannot say that, though you have been very wrong; but\nhow can I blame you even for that, when I was as bad? You are forgetting\nabout my buying this basket,” and she pointed to a small table on which\nthe basket was placed; “a little girl might have come with a cat to\nsell, and then it would have been just the same thing.”\n\n“No, not the same thing; for you had more money which you had saved, so\nyou could spare it;--but I must say one thing, Cousin Leila, I do wonder\nhow you can put this basket on the table before your very eyes; I can’t\nbear even to look at this box, I am so sorry; and you said we had both\ndone wrong, and should both repent. I don’t think this looks very like\nrepenting.”\n\nLeila coloured, and the tears came into her eyes as she said in a very\nlow voice, “I did it to make me repent.”\n\n“To make you repent, I don’t understand what you mean; you liked the\nbasket, I suppose?”\n\n“No, I did not; I could not bear it; I felt just the same as you did;\nand at first I hid it in the corner behind that high chair; but then I\nthought it would be my punishment if I saw it always before me, and that\nit would keep me in mind not to buy useless things again.”\n\n“And I have been thinking you wrong,” Matilda exclaimed, “when all the\ntime you were most excellent; oh, Leila, I never can be like you--no,\nnot a hope of it; I do believe I am turning out quite worthless;--first,\nI would spend all my money for my own pleasure; then I would open the\nparcel, and let it fall; and after all this, I tried to think you as bad\nas I am; but I know what you are thinking now, and I can at least do\nthat--you are thinking that I should take home this work-box, and put it\non a table before my eyes; and I _will_ do it.” She tore the paper from\nthe work-box as she spoke, and looked at it steadily. “O yes, abominable\nbox,” she said, “I just hate you!--but no, it is not the work-box that\nis wrong,”--and she shook her head;--“but we won’t talk any more about\nit now; let us go into the conservatory, and see the dear little birds,\nthey are singing so cheerily, and they don’t know any thing about\nrepentance, or what I have been doing.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nMany weeks now passed on tranquilly and without any marked event. The\npoor widow Barlow and her family had been frequently visited. Mr. Howard\nhad been liberal in rendering her assistance, and Leila and her cousins\nhad employed many of their leisure hours in working for the children,\nwho were now comfortably clothed, and the elder ones put to school.\nMatilda had most cheerfully contributed her share, both in money and in\nwork, and Mrs. Roberts gave a favourable report of her general\nimprovement; her constant association with Selina and Leila was\ncertainly producing a favourable effect on her character, but she was\nstill easily misled by bad example, and often unprepared to meet the\nhour of trial; present gratification was generally yielded to, and\nthough in most cases deep repentance followed, her feelings were as yet\nstronger than her principles, and the many good resolutions made in the\nhour of sorrow too often gave way before fresh temptation.\n\nIt was now nearly Midsummer; the precious seeds had not only sprung up\ninto three healthy plants, but each plant presented flower-buds of\npromising appearance. The old gardener, however, would not hear of their\nbeing transplanted into separate pots till the autumn, assuring Leila\nthat were he to do so sooner it would prevent the flower-buds from\nopening, and in every way retard the growth of the plant. This was a\ndisappointment; but she consoled herself by having the flower-pot\nremoved into her own room and placed on a flower-stand before the\nwindow, that she might watch the opening of the blossoms, having\nresolved to gather the first-blown flower for Mrs. Herbert.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Stanley, with Selina and Matilda, were now passing a few\ndays at Woodlands, and Leila had obtained permission from her papa to\ninvite Lydia Mildmay to spend the following day with them, as it was\nMatilda’s birthday, and she knew it would give her pleasure.\n\nA brilliant sun awoke the sisters at an early hour, yet they found that\nLeila must have already visited them, for their pretty white bed was\nstrewed with fresh flowers. The dew of the morning was still upon them,\nand Matilda thought no flowers before had ever smelt so sweet; she\nsprang up to rush into Leila’s room to thank her, when her steps were\narrested by seeing a little table placed by her bed-side, over which a\ncovering of embroidered muslin was thrown.\n\n“This is Cousin Leila again,” she exclaimed, as she hastily lifted the\nwhite drapery, which proved to be an embroidered apron, worked by Leila\nfor this happy occasion. On the table was placed a pretty little\nwriting-desk, a present from her papa and mamma, a case in\nmother-of-pearl, with pens, pencil, sealing-wax, &c., from her Uncle\nHerbert, and a beautiful purse worked by Selina. Matilda was in\necstasies; how she got dressed she never very well knew; she had no\ndistinct remembrance but of being half smothered with heat from being\nclosely wrapped up in a shawl and carried back to her room by Nurse, who\nlooked unutterable things. How she longed for twelve o’clock, the hour\nat which her friend was to arrive; for to show all those beauties to\nLydia Mildmay would be such a renewal of her pleasure!\n\nTwelve o’clock came at last; but Matilda was disappointed when Lydia saw\nher pretty bed, (for Matilda had carefully preserved the flowers upon\nit,) she only shrugged her shoulders, exclaiming, “How vastly poetical\nwe are.” And though she said all that was civil when she saw the\npresents, her admiration fell far short of what had been expected; and\nall, that but the moment before had appeared so beautiful in Matilda’s\neyes, fell considerably in her estimation, when Lydia, with an affected\nair of indifference, observed, “This seems a day for showing presents,\nso perhaps you would like to see a little trifle which my godmother\npresented to me some little time ago; at first I thought it rather\npretty, though now I don’t think much of it;” and she took from her\nreticule a beautiful little _etui_ of the most finished workmanship. It\nwas a walnut-shell, bound and lined with gold, containing scissors,\nbodkin, and thimble, with small tablets of mother-of-pearl, and a gold\npencil-case with an amethyst top. Matilda gazed in speechless\nadmiration. If Lydia’s intention was to mortify her, she might have been\nsatisfied with the look with which Matilda now contemplated all that had\nbefore given her so much pleasure; but after a little time she rallied\nagain, and whispering to Leila that if her presents were not quite so\nbeautiful, they were at least far more useful, she quite brightened up,\nand proposed that they should go into the conservatory to visit the\nparrots, and then into the garden.\n\nThe day seemed to pass very pleasantly to all; for though Lydia and\nMatilda were always going off by themselves, the hours never seemed long\nwhen Selina and Leila were together. Immediately after dinner the\ncarriage was sent for. Lydia, to convey her home, as there was a large\ndinner party, and her mamma wished her to be present in the\ndrawing-room. Matilda seemed quite unhappy in parting with her; indeed,\nhaving this intelligence communicated to her just as they were sitting\ndown to dinner seemed quite to overset her. She held her hand at\nparting, and looked anxiously up in her face, then followed her a few\nsteps as she was leaving the room, and for some minutes they whispered\ntogether. When Matilda returned, Leila observed that her eyes were full\nof tears. She went up to her, and took her kindly by the hand, but\nMatilda hastily pushed her away, and ran out of the room.\n\n“What can be the matter with Matilda?” Leila inquired; “did you observe,\nSelina, she appeared quite angry with me? Do you think it is only that\nshe is sorry Lydia has gone away, or have I done any thing to offend\nher? Should I go and ask her, do you think?”\n\n“No, Leila, I think you had better not. You have done nothing to make\nher angry. I am sure it is not that. Matilda is never the better of\nbeing alone with Lydia Mildmay; I am quite sorry now we left them so\nmuch together; but I so dislike appearing to watch them; I fear\nsomething has happened, for I know the expression of Matilda’s face so\nwell--it was not only at the moment of parting she was so much overset.\nDid you not observe her at dinner?”\n\n“No, I did not look at her much, but I think she was in good spirits\nthen; I remember now she laughed two or three times.”\n\n“Yes, she tried to laugh; but she looked very unhappy; and it was only\nwhen she saw me looking at her that she laughed. At one time she kept\ncrumbling all her bread down on the carpet, as if she did not know what\nshe was about, and once or twice she could scarcely swallow. Then mamma\nsaid something to her, and she grew very red, and seemed to wish to hide\nher hands under the table.”\n\n“O I can tell you what made her grow red then. I heard Aunt Stanley tell\nher that she must have forgotten to wash her hands before dinner; and,\nto be sure, her nails were quite as black as if she had been grubbing in\nthe earth like little Alfred.”\n\nSelina shook her head. “I don’t understand it,” she said; “but I fear\nMatilda has done something wrong.”\n\n“Then I am sure it must be Lydia’s fault if she has,” Leila said\neagerly: “for Mrs. Roberts says she improved so much of late. I am so\nsorry I invited Lydia, and papa advised me not; he said he thought we\nthree would be quite happy together. I wish he had said steadily, ‘No,\nLeila, I don’t wish it;’ but he very seldom now tells me I am not to do\na thing, as he used to do in the island; he says now that I am older I\nshould learn to govern myself, and that in most cases he wishes only to\nadvise. So it is my fault also if Matilda has done wrong, for I invited\nLydia.”\n\n“But, Leila, we must not blame Lydia without knowing. How can we\nbut----” She was interrupted by Matilda looking into the room, she drew\nhastily back, but on Selina calling to her, she advanced a few steps,\nhesitated, and looking anxiously in Leila’s face for a moment, again\nleft the room. They both observed that her eyes were swoln with weeping,\nand Selina, now seriously alarmed, said she must go into the\ndrawing-room, and find out if her mamma was aware if any thing was\nwrong. She thought now she should speak to her mamma, and she would come\nup into Leila’s room and tell her what she had heard.\n\nSelina had not been in the drawing-room many minutes when the door\nopened, and Leila darted in, exclaiming, “Oh! Selina, my flowers, my\nprecious flowers! Clara’s flowers are dying.”\n\nThey all followed her into her room--every thing seemed in perfect\norder, and the flower-pot stood exactly where Leila had placed it; but\ntwo of the plants seemed withered, and when Mrs. Stanley touched them\nthey fell from her hand on the carpet, they evidently had been broken\noff and carefully stuck into the earth again.\n\n“Who can have done this?” Mrs. Stanley exclaimed, and her eyes fell upon\nSelina, who had become very pale. “Selina,” she said, “do you know any\nthing of this?”\n\n“No, mamma, I do not.”\n\n“But I see you suspect,” Mrs. Stanley said. “Where is Matilda?”\n\nAt that moment Amy entered the room, but seeing it occupied was\nretreating again, when Mrs. Stanley called to her. “Amy,” she said,\n“come here. Do you know any thing of this? did you overturn that\nflower-pot?”\n\n“Miss Leila’s favourite flowers! O no, no, I did not. I was not aware it\nhad been overturned.”\n\nHer look of perfect truthfulness it was impossible to doubt.\n\nWhen the flowers fell to the ground, Leila had hidden her face on her\npapa’s shoulder, and was struggling with her emotion; she now looked up,\nand turning to Mrs. Stanley, she said, “Aunt, there is still one plant\nleft, and it must have been an accident. O don’t say any thing more\nabout it.”\n\nBut Mrs. Stanley would not yield to this. “No, my love,” she said, “it\nis quite necessary that I should endeavour to discover the truth. The\noverturning of the flower-pot might have been an accident, but the\nattempt to deceive, the replanting the flowers in the earth, could not\nhave been accidental. Now, Amy, recollect yourself, and tell me if you\nhave seen any one leaving this room lately?”\n\nAmy was silent.\n\n“I insist upon knowing,” Mrs. Stanley said.\n\n“I saw Miss Matilda come out of the room, ma’am,” Amy answered in a\ntrembling voice.\n\n“Was it before Miss Mildmay went home, or after?” Mrs. Stanley inquired.\n\n“It was after, ma’am.”\n\n“And did you observe any thing particular in Miss Matilda’s appearance?\nDid she look distressed?”\n\nAmy was again silent.\n\n“Speak out, Amy, I desire you,” Mrs. Stanley said.\n\n“Miss Matilda was crying, ma’am.”\n\n“You may go, Amy, and send Miss Matilda to me.”\n\nAmy left the room. Mr. Howard also rose and quitted the room just as\nMatilda was entering it; she came in trembling excessively, and looking\nvery pale, but the moment Mrs. Stanley placed the flower-pot before her\nand said, “Matilda, do you know any thing of this?” the deepest colour\nsuffused her face, and mounted to her temples. She remained silent.\n\n“You were in your cousin’s room after dinner, were you not?” Mrs.\nStanley inquired.\n\n“Yes, mamma.” The words were scarcely audible.\n\nMrs. Stanley fixed her eyes upon her face. “Matilda,” she said, “I\nhappened to be in your cousin’s room immediately before dinner; I went\nto look for a book. The flowers then looked perfectly fresh; you must\nhave overturned the flower-pot when Amy saw you coming out of the room\nthis evening.”\n\nMatilda’s agitation increased; she tried to speak, but Mrs. Stanley with\ndifficulty could make out the words, “No, mamma.”\n\nMrs. Stanley herself now became much agitated. “Oh, Matilda,” she said,\n“I conjure you to speak out, and tell me clearly what did happen; do not\nlet me have the pain of feeling that my child has not only shown\nduplicity in the attempt to conceal what at first was probably only an\naccident, but is now adding falsehood to her fault; tell me distinctly,\ndid you or did you not overthrow that flower-pot and break those\nflowers?”\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nLeila went up to her and whispered, “Matilda, dear Matilda, speak the\ntruth, don’t be afraid; I am not angry, I don’t care now for the\nflowers, that is, I don’t care very much, I am not so sorry for them\nnow, indeed I am not. But say you did it, O do say it; don’t make God\nangry with you. O pray that this temptation may be taken from you; He\nwill give you strength.”\n\nMatilda was still silent, but the piteous look she cast on Leila was\nheart-rending.\n\nMrs. Stanley again spoke. “Matilda,” she said, “I see it is vain to\nprolong this scene. Go to your room, and on your knees pray earnestly to\nyour heavenly Father to touch your sinful heart; when you have asked\nforgiveness of Him, and have resolved to make a full and free confession\nof your fault, send for me, I will be ready to come to you at any\nmoment.”\n\nMatilda left the room; Mrs. Stanley soon after followed. Selina and\nLeila were left alone; Selina was silently weeping. Neither of them\nspoke for several minutes. Leila then said, “Selina, we cannot be quite\ncertain that Matilda is deceiving us; Lydia may have done this.”\n\nSelina shook her head. “O that I could think so, but I cannot. I know\nthe expression of Matilda’s face too well. I always know when she has\ndone wrong; and you forget, Leila, that mamma saw the flowers just\nbefore dinner, and they looked quite fresh then; and Lydia was not in\nyour room after dinner, you know we were all with her till the moment\nshe went away. When did you last observe them yourself? You must have\nbeen in the room when you were changing your dress for dinner.”\n\nLeila looked much distressed as she answered, “Yes, I saw them, and they\ndid look fresh; I remember it, because I observed drops of water on the\nleaves, and the earth looked wet, and I knew that Amy must have watered\nthem--she often does so when the day has been warm; Amy was very fond of\nmy poor flowers.” She had no sooner uttered the words than she coloured.\n“It was very wrong in me to say this, and to make you more sorry, for\nindeed it is not the flowers I am thinking most of now: and you know,\nSelina, I have still three more seeds to sow. How wise it was of papa to\nadvise me to keep them in case of accidents, and not to risk all at\nonce. O if I would always take papa’s advice, every thing would be well;\nif I had taken his advice about Lydia, and had not invited her, Matilda\nwould have been with us as usual during the whole time, and this would\nnot have happened. And yet papa says I must learn to judge for myself, I\nmust not lean too much on others; how difficult all this is. Do you\nthink we should go to Matilda now?”\n\n“No, I think mamma wished her to be alone.”\n\n“Then let us go into the garden, I feel so unhappy; I don’t like sitting\nstill.”\n\nThe door of Matilda’s room they saw was not entirely shut as they\npassed.\n\n“Perhaps she might speak to me,” Selina said. She advanced a few steps\ninto the room; Matilda had thrown herself upon the bed. The flowers with\nwhich it had been so lately decked now lay scattered on the floor.\nMatilda evidently saw her, for she looked up for a moment, but she did\nnot speak, and they passed on to the garden.\n\nThe whole evening wore slowly away, and no message came from Matilda;\nevery time the drawing-room door opened, Selina and Leila were in\nanxious expectation--but still no message came. The young people went\nearly to bed: how brightly had the morning dawned upon them, and now all\nwas turned to sorrow. The first thing which struck Leila on entering her\nroom was the muslin apron which she had embroidered for Matilda folded\nup and laid upon her bed; had she looked into her aunt’s room, she would\nhave seen the writing-desk also returned, and placed upon the table.\nHad Matilda done this? had she felt that she was unworthy of retaining\nthose gifts which had been given her as marks of love and affection?\nLeila prayed earnestly for Matilda, but it was long before she could\ncompose herself to sleep; the piteous look which Matilda had cast upon\nher haunted her imagination.\n\nMeanwhile poor Selina was not less unhappy. On entering the bed-room,\nshe found Matilda seated at the table writing a letter. She looked much\nfluttered when Selina entered, and hastily threw her pocket-handkerchief\nover something on the table. Selina felt almost certain it was the\n_etui_ which Matilda had admired so much. Matilda seemed unwilling to\nbegin to undress; after a short time she said, making a visible effort\nto speak calmly, “Selina, do go to bed, and go quickly. I can’t come\njust yet; don’t ask me why.”\n\nSelina began to undress. She then took her Bible to read as usual before\nsaying her prayers. “Matilda,” she said, after a few minutes, “may I\nread you this text which I have turned up?”\n\nThere seemed a silent assent.\n\nSelina read, “There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common\nto man; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above\nthat you are able, but will with the temptation make a way to escape,\nthat you may be able to bear it.” “Yes,” Selina said, “and it is by\npraying to God that we shall obtain His assistance,” and she knelt down\nby the side of her bed.\n\nFor some time after she had lain down, all was still in the room. Selina\nhad turned her face from her sister, that she might not seem to watch\nher. After some time Matilda rose; she stood for a moment by the bed,\nthen put something very gently below the pillow; she started when Selina\nsaid, “Matilda, I am not asleep;” but she knelt down, said her prayers,\nand then got into bed.\n\n“How very cold you are, dear Matilda,” Selina said; “and how you\ntremble. O why will you not tell me all?”\n\nMatilda pressed her hand. “Good night, dearest; try to sleep.”\n\nMatilda seemed more composed; Selina felt comfort, she knew not why.\nAfter a considerable time Selina did sleep. She was awakened early by\nthe bright morning sun, but when she opened her eyes she saw Matilda was\nnot there. She called to her, there was no answer. Much alarmed, she\nsprang out of bed and flew to the window. She saw Matilda fully dressed,\nstanding below a tree speaking to the gardener’s boy; she put a small\npacket into his hand, and pointed across the lawn in the direction of\nMr. Mildmay’s. The packet was larger than a letter, Selina felt sure it\nwas the _etui_. She retreated from the window, and when Matilda\nreturned, took no notice of what she had seen. At the breakfast-table\nthere was no Matilda with her smiling face. All the morning she\ncontinued in her room, seated by the window; she had her work in her\nhand, but was generally looking out along the approach as if she\nexpected some one. About the middle of the day a servant in livery was\nseen approaching; he held a letter in his hand; as he stopped below her\nwindow, she strained her eyes to catch the address, but could not. Poor\nMatilda! how her heart beat, and how her colour went and came; but no\none entered her room--the letter then could not have been for her. She\ncalled to Amy, who said she believed the servant had brought a letter\nfor Mrs. Stanley. At that moment Selina came running in. “Matilda,” she\nsaid, “Mrs. Mildmay has written to say that Lydia has lost her ruby\nring, and she begs it may be carefully looked for; she returned home,\nshe says, with only one glove, and Mrs. Mildmay thinks she may have\npulled it off in the glove, and trusts we may be able to find it.”\n\nSelina looked earnestly at Matilda, but her expression she could not\nmake out; she had brightened up considerably at first, but now there\nwas only agitation visible, and she made no effort to assist in looking\nfor the lost glove. It was not to be found in Matilda’s room; the\ndrawing-room and dining-room had already been searched. They now\nproceeded to Leila’s apartment. Here they were equally unsuccessful:\nunder the bed, under every chair, they searched in vain. Suddenly it\nstruck Selina that it was at dinner, while Lydia was still there, that\nher mamma had observed that Matilda’s nails were black. There was a\nsmall window in one corner of Leila’s room which looked out upon the\ncourt; she threw open this window and gazed eagerly out; she saw\nsomething lying which might be a glove. Amy ran down into the court, and\nreturned with the glove in her hand. The ring was sticking in one of the\nfingers, but the pale kid glove was much stained with earth, and could\nnot have been used again. A new light seemed to dawn on Mrs. Stanley;\n“Amy,” she said, “go to the coachman, and tell him I shall require the\ncarriage as quickly as possible, I must drive over to Mrs. Mildmay’s.”\nThen turning to Selina, she whispered, “I wish Matilda to return to her\nroom, and let no one question her.”\n\nThe hour of Mrs. Stanley’s absence was an anxious hour to all. Selina\nand Leila were both with Matilda when the carriage was seen returning;\nwhen it stopped before the door Matilda seemed scarcely able to breathe.\nMrs. Stanley entered and took her in her arms. “My poor child,” she\nsaid, “you have been very, very wrong; but, thank God, you have not told\nan untruth. O Matilda, how you have been injured by bad example, and how\nfar the evil might have spread, had I not discovered Lydia’s artful\ncharacter! Mrs. Mildmay told me she suspected something was wrong when\nshe found you had written to Lydia, and sent back her _etui_; and even\nbefore I went she had extracted from her a sort of half confession.\nUnhappy girl! but she now seems completely penitent.” Then turning to\nLeila and Selina, she continued, “She seemed anxious to tell me all; she\nsaid that she had insisted on going into Leila’s room, as she wished to\nsee her books and some pretty ornaments she had observed on the\nmantel-piece; that when she overturned the flower-stand, Matilda had\nwished her immediately to confess it, but she would not; that she had\nstuck the flowers into the earth and watered them, in the hope of\nkeeping them fresh as long as she remained, and that she had bribed\nMatilda to perfect silence by offering her the _etui_; that Matilda at\nfirst refused, but afterwards yielded, and that Lydia had made her\npromise that she was to answer no questions, that she was not on any\naccount to say she had not done it. Alas! my child, how you grieved the\nHoly Spirit when you took that wicked bribe; but deeply have you\nsuffered, and I will inflict no further punishment upon you, than that\nyou should remain in your room during the day. Think deeply of all that\nhas passed, and of the misery you have endured, and pray earnestly to\nGod for his forgiveness, and for strength to resist future temptation.\nAlso you must give me your promise to give up all intimacy with Lydia\nMildmay, and never to trust yourself alone with her again, unless in\nafter years I give you leave to do so.”\n\nMatilda threw herself again into her mamma’s arms, but she could not\nspeak. She then slowly left the room.\n\n“Selina,” she said, when soon after she was alone with her sister, “you\ncan never know how unhappy I have been. I cannot tell it you. O it was\nso dreadful when mamma questioned me, and I dared not tell! And when I\nthought you all believed I was telling untruths, and that you could\nnever love me again, I thought my heart would break. I did not know what\nwas right and what was wrong, and for a long time I could not pray. But\nthen I did, and God seemed to put it into my heart to send back the\n_etui_, and ask leave to tell; and I was a little happier after that.\nBut when you took my hand in bed, and asked me again to tell, I grew\nworse again. I could not sleep; (only now and then a little;) my best\ntime was when I stood under the tree, and saw the gardener’s boy running\nacross the lawn with my letter, the air was so fresh, and the birds were\nsinging, and the sun made every thing so beautiful. I felt quite happy\nthen.”\n\nThe tears were running down Selina’s cheeks.\n\n“I am making you sorry,” she continued; “I will not tell you any more.\nYou know I am happy now, O so happy! and I will not forget this time, I\nam sure--no, I never, never will forget. Now go, dearest, to Leila, for\nI think mamma wishes me to be alone; but come in sometimes, with cousin\nLeila, and just kiss me and go away again.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nFrom this time the improvement in Matilda’s character was much more\nsteady; her warm affection for her sister and Leila daily increased, and\nshe seemed now to have no wish beyond the enjoyment of their society.\nThey were a most happy little trio; but days of trial were at hand, and\nsorrow about to visit their young hearts in an unexpected form. Charles\nwas now at home for the Midsummer holidays, and had come over to pass\nthe Saturday at Woodlands; he certainly was somewhat taller than before,\nbut Leila seemed rather to think it an improvement, and she met him with\nall the frank gladness of her happy age. There was so little of the\nrough school-boy in Charles, and so much of the gentle kind friend, that\nLeila had learnt to look up to him with a feeling of happy security; he\nnever flattered her in asking advice; she was always sure of hearing the\ntruth from him unbiassed by any previous opinion expressed on her side.\nShe told him that an accident had happened to the precious plant\nintended for him; but she entered into no details, and he promised to be\npatient, and to await the coming up of the other seeds. They had not\nbeen long together when he inquired for his friend Peggy Dobie, and\nLeila proposed that they should cross the lawn together and visit her at\nher cottage; they were sure of finding her in her garden, she said, for\nPeggy had told her that her bees were about to swarm, and that she must\nwatch them closely.\n\nNever had Leila looked more joyous than when she tied on her bonnet to\naccompany Charles; her cheeks were glowing with health, her eyes bright\nwith intelligence, and the feelings of hopeful, trusting, happy youth\nwere visible in every expression of her sweet countenance.\n\nIt had been the loveliest of summer mornings, and at first so elastic\nwas Leila’s step, that she seemed to tread on air; she proposed to\nlengthen their walk by first mounting one of the high fields from which\nthe view was particularly fine; but by the time they had gained the\nheight, they felt the heat of the sun overcoming, and in descending were\nglad to avail themselves of the shelter of the wood. The bright\nsunshine, however, which they had wished to avoid, now suddenly gave way\nto dark lurid clouds; the air became very close and oppressive; there\nwas a dull moaning sound amongst the trees, as if the wind were about to\nrise, and as they entered the wood the sweet singing of the birds was\nhushed; they were darting rapidly to and fro amongst the branches in\nconstant uneasy motion, as if danger were at hand. Charles looked\nanxiously at the great masses of fiery-looking clouds which were now\ndriven along by a strong current of upper air. Leila caught the anxious\nexpression of his face.\n\n“Why do you look so frightened, Charles?” she said. “I like these sudden\nchanges, they are very good; don’t walk so quick,--let us stop for a\nmoment and watch those magnificent clouds.”\n\n“No, Leila, no; let us hasten home; I fear we shall have a storm.”\n\n“A storm!” she repeated; “O do then let us make haste. I am not\nfrightened--that is, I am not much frightened, though a storm always\nmakes me think of melancholy things; but papa, I know, will be anxious\nabout us; let us walk very quick.”\n\nThey hastened on, but Leila suddenly paused for a moment to listen to\nthe sound of distant thunder. “The storm has begun,” she said, in a tone\nof alarm; “that is thunder;” then quickening her steps, she proceeded\nmore rapidly than before. A second and louder peal succeeded to the\nfirst; again and again it lightened, and the thunder seemed every moment\nto be approaching nearer. Leila trembled all over, and clung to Charles\nin speechless terror.\n\n“Let us get out of the wood,” Charles hastily exclaimed, “we shall be\nsafer in the open field,” and seizing her arm he hurried her forward.\n\nAt that moment the whole wood seemed lighted up as if on fire; the\nlightning ran along the ground, a great branch from a tree fell with a\nloud crash at their feet, and Leila screamed, “Charles, where are you,\nCharles? I cannot see you--I am blind!”\n\nO that moment of inexpressible agony, as he stooped and gazed into her\ndear face! It was unscathed, but the eyes were shut. “Open your eyes,\ndear, dear Leila; O do not say you cannot open them. Merciful God, it\ncannot be!”\n\nAlas! it was too true. She tried in vain to raise her eyelids.\n\n“I shall never see my papa again,” she almost shrieked out, as she sank\nupon the ground at Charles’s feet. He lifted her gently in his arms, her\nhead fell upon his shoulder; she became still, he thought she had\nfainted, but soon he heard her whisper, “It is God who has done it. He\nloves me, I am His child, and He can comfort my dear, dear papa.”\n\nCharles continued to carry her in his arms, but his knees trembled so\nmuch he could scarcely get along, and Leila felt a tear drop upon her\ncheek.\n\n“Charles,” she said, “you are weeping. O do not weep for me; God can\ncomfort me, and he _does_. I cannot tell you what I feel now, it seems\nas if angels were whispering to me.” Then after a little she said again,\n“But it is for my papa, my own papa. Charles, do not carry me to him at\nfirst; carry me to my own room.”\n\nShe was obeyed. He stole up stairs unperceived by any one, and Leila\nknelt down by the side of her bed and prayed earnestly.\n\n“Now take me to my papa,” she said, as she arose from her knees. “Where\nare you, Charles?” she exclaimed, as she tried to grasp the empty air.\n\nCharles had been watching at the door; he too had offered up a silent\nearnest prayer; he was now by her side in a moment, and led her to her\npapa’s room. She tapped at his door.\n\n“Come in, my little woman,” Mr. Howard said, in a glad voice, but\nwithout raising his eyes from his book. “I am so relieved to hear your\nlittle tap; I have been seeking you, Leila. Where have you been during\nthis frightful storm? Why don’t you come in, love?”\n\n\n“Come to the door, dear papa, but do not open it, till I speak to you.”\n\nMr. Howard rose. “What pleasant little surprise are you preparing for\nme, my child?” he said, as he stood with his hand upon the lock.\n\n“Papa, dear papa, it is not a pleasant surprise; but you will try to\nbear it.”\n\nThe sound of her voice startled him, and Mr. Howard opened the door in\nthe greatest alarm. Leila fell into his arms.\n\n“Papa,” she said, as she clung to him and repeatedly kissed his cheek,\n“papa, you will bear it; God has done it. He knows best. He has struck\nme blind!”\n\nMr. Howard groaned aloud; he clasped Leila more closely in his arms--he\nlooked upon her face--he could not speak.\n\nCharles, in a trembling voice, related all that had taken place.\n\nMr. Howard rallied, and seemed to regain his usual firmness; he turned\nto Charles,--“Send immediately to Richmond,” he said, “for Dr. B----,\nand let the coachman get ready to ride to London, I will give him a\nnote. Leila, my own heroic child, I must leave you a moment with Nurse.”\n\nThe poor woman and Amy were already in the room, both sobbing bitterly;\nbut upon Mr. Howard speaking aside to Nurse, and telling her of the\nnecessity there was for self-command for Leila’s sake, she made a\nwonderful effort for composure, and seating herself on the couch, she\ntook Leila in her arms, and laid her head gently upon her shoulder, as\nshe used to do when she was a little child. Amy stood by her side, her\nhands clasped together, and with an expression of the deepest woe, while\ntears still ran silently down her cheeks.\n\nLeila was now quite composed. They heard her whisper, “The worst is over\nnow, my papa knows it all;” and she pressed Nurse’s hand repeatedly, and\nsaid she felt better, then drawing Amy towards her, she whispered very\nlow in her ear,--“You will be a good girl, Amy, and not cry, and you\nwill be a great comfort to me--you will lead me every where.”\n\nCharles had himself gone off to Richmond on Leila’s pony, but returned\nunsuccessful; both Dr. B.---- and another to whom he applied were from\nhome. The agony of suspense to all was very great; and though Charles\nstrove hard to restrain his emotion, the tones of his voice betrayed his\nfeelings to Leila every time he tried to address her.\n\nMr. Howard spoke to him aside--he thought it better he should return\nhome. It was a great trial to him, but he instantly obeyed, and stole\nout of the room without even a word of adieu, he felt that all\nadditional agitation must be carefully avoided.\n\nAs he went out Leila raised her head and listened. “Some one has left\nthe room,” she said, “it must be Charles. Where has he gone to?”\n\nMr. Howard explained that he had returned home, he thought it better he\nshould do so.\n\n“Ah, papa, I know why: it is because I agitate myself so much. I know it\nis very wrong, and I will try to be quite calm, and to comfort you more,\npapa; but I cannot always do it, though sometimes for a moment it seems\nquite easy, and I only feel that God has done it for my good, and has\nsent me this great trial because he loves me and wishes to make me\nbetter, and that perhaps he has shut my eyes on the world that I may\nthink more of my beautiful home in heaven; for, papa, do you not know\nhow much I had begun to love the world; the love of it was creeping into\nme, and you did not know it; ever since we came into it I have loved it\nevery day more and more--the people, the flowers, this house, every\nthing. Yes, I have loved the world better than the island, where I\nthought so much more of God. And I used to like so much to hear Bill and\nSusan call me their little mistress,--all this was very wrong, and I\ndare say this is why God has shut it all out, the trees, the green\nfields, the beautiful flowing river, and even your face, my own\npapa--and for _ever_!--oh, that is the part I cannot bear.”\n\n“Hush, my child, my own Leila;--do not say there is any thing you cannot\nbear. He who has sent the trial will give you strength. Remember, we are\ntold, that ‘If we endure chastening, God dealeth with us as with sons,\nfor what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not?’--and though for the\npresent it is very grievous to you, He will, when His own righteous\npurposes have been fulfilled, bring to your heart that sweet peace\n‘which the world cannot know;’--but, my child, you are exciting yourself\nin talking too much, and I am most anxious that you should keep very\nquiet now, and try to get a little sleep.”\n\n“Well, papa, I will. Do you remember that day, papa, when you said to\nme, ‘Leila, remember, duties are ours, but events are in the hands of\nGod?’ I am glad I have thought of this now, for it comforts me--it tells\nme it is my duty to be patient and to trust it all to God--now I will\ntry to sleep.”\n\nShe did try, but soon she started up again, and clasped her papa’s hand\nmore tightly. “Papa,” she said, “there is something I wish to say to\nyou; and then I think I could sleep;--will you write to Aunt Stanley,\nand tell her every thing, and beg her to come here to-day as soon as\npossible, and bring them all with her. I shall be better when I have\nseen them all”--(she stopped and shuddered)--“I shall be better when\nthey are here, I mean; and bid aunt tell Selina not to be very sorry,\nand to remember how God comforted her when she was dumb, and gave her\nstrength to bear it; and He is giving me strength also, dear papa.”\n\nMr. Howard seated himself at the table and began to write, and before he\nhad finished his note Leila was asleep--it seemed a troubled sleep, she\nstarted often, and called out repeatedly, as if in extreme terror, for\nthe shock on her nervous system had been severe; but before she awoke to\nperfect consciousness again, her uncle, aunt, and all of them, stood\ngazing upon her. They all struggled hard to control their sorrow, but it\nwas Matilda’s and Alfred’s sobs that awakened Leila. I will not further\ndistress my young readers by dwelling on this scene. Leila herself was\nthe first to obtain composure, and after some time she was able to\nconverse calmly with Selina.\n\nShe showed so much unwillingness to part with them again, that Mr.\nHoward arranged that they should all come over for some weeks to\nWoodlands, Leila having promised that she would be satisfied with\nexactly as much of the society of her cousins as was thought good for\nher; but the knowledge that they were in the house, she said, would be\nthe greatest comfort to her; and it was further arranged that Selina was\nnot to go home that evening, but remain till the others joined her.\n\nThis mournful day wore heavily on, and still Dr. B---- had not arrived.\nIt were difficult to say what they all expected would be the result of\nhis anxiously expected visit; but when at last the sound of horses’\nhoofs was heard upon the gravel, the agitation of the whole party was\nextreme. Mr. Howard became very pale, and withdrew his hand from Leila’s\nthat she might not be aware how he trembled; but she had heard the\nsound, and seemed aware of his motive, for she said, “Do not be afraid\nof me, papa; I know what Dr. B---- will say, and I can bear it; hold my\nhand again, it makes me feel strong.”\n\nDr. B---- entered; the look he cast on all around was full of deep\nsympathy, for Charles’s note had made him aware of what had happened.\nHis eyes rested mournfully on Leila, who lay on the sofa looking pale\nand agitated; but as he approached, she hastily brushed a tear from her\nlong, dark eyelashes, and the brightest colour dyed her cheeks. He\npaused in evident emotion; then seating himself by her, he looked at\nher attentively, took the hand Mr. Howard had been holding, and felt her\npulse; her hand was deadly cold; again all colour had now left her\ncheek, and she lay like a bruised lily, shrinking from his touch.\n\n“Try to compose yourself, my dear young lady,” he said gently; “I am not\ngoing to hurt you; but it is necessary that I should examine your eyes\nmore closely.” As he spoke, he turned her face more fully to the light.\nMr. Howard was bending over her. Dr. B---- gently raised one of her\neyelids, and Leila, in a voice of rapture, exclaimed, “My papa, I see\nhim?”\n\nWho can express Mr. Howard’s feelings at that moment. “Thank God!” the\nkind-hearted physician exclaimed, “the sight of the eye in this dear\nchild is not destroyed;” and on examining the other, the result was\nequally satisfactory. “This is not so bad as we dreaded,” he said; but\nhe whispered something to Mr. Howard, and seemed about to quit the room.\nHe had asked to speak to him alone.\n\nLeila had not caught the words, but she suspected something; and\nspringing up she said, “Do let him tell me every thing, papa, I am quite\nable to bear it. Does Dr. B---- think I shall still be blind?--do let\nhim speak out the truth.”\n\nMr. Howard assented. The good doctor was much affected. “My dear young\nlady,” he said, “I hope and trust that you will not always be blind; but\nI am not prepared to say that you certainly will recover the power of\nraising your eyelids--there have been frequent instances of the nerves\nnever recovering their powers; but you are young, and in good health;\nyour well-turned mind, and your power of commanding your feelings, (and\nI am sure from the highest motives,) is much in your favour, and with\nGod nothing is impossible. And now I will take my leave for to-day. I\nhave only one caution to give, and I address it to all,--agitation of\nevery kind must as much as possible be avoided.”\n\nIt was no unnecessary caution, for the lively joy expressed by Matilda\nand Alfred when Dr. B---- pronounced his opinion, Leila felt more\ndifficult to bear than their former sorrow; and Mr. Howard now expressed\na wish, which was immediately complied with, that Leila should be left\nalone with him for the rest of the evening.\n\nBefore night the oculist from London also arrived. He confirmed all that\nthe physician had said; he could pronounce nothing positive as to\nLeila’s recovering her sight, but he had hope; and he enforced still\nmore strictly, if possible, that every thing should be done to\nstrengthen her general health, and agitation and excitement of every\nkind carefully avoided. “Don’t let any one be with her,” he said, “who\nis likely to agitate her; there is an old woman in the passage in such a\nstate of distress; she is clamorous for admittance, but it must not be\nyielded to.” This was spoken aside to Mr. Howard, but Leila caught the\nwords, “old woman.” “It is Peggy Dobie,” she said, “my dear Peggy; oh,\npapa, let her come in for a moment, only one moment, papa, and then I\nshall keep myself quite still, and not be agitated again.”\n\nMr. Howard thought she ought to be gratified; he knew better than the\noculist the command which Leila could maintain over herself: he spoke to\nPeggy himself--she came in, knelt down by Leila’s bed, took her hand,\nand with a voice which trembled with emotion, she said, “My dear, dear\nbairn, your poor old Peggy will pray for you, and there is a merciful\nGod above.” Her voice sank to a whisper; she seemed unable to add\nanother word; but Leila seemed calmed and comforted. Poor Peggy left the\nroom, but she lingered till a late hour in the house, and was back again\nin the first dawn of the morning.\n\nThe sad news had spread rapidly through the village: Leila was so\nbeloved by old and young, that the inquiries during the whole day had\nbeen numerous. The children of the village, as well as her little\nscholars, came in troops, and Amy had many a sorrowful scene to go\nthrough with them. Nurse sat by Leila’s side during the whole night, and\nMr. Howard visited her every hour. Her sleep was very broken, and next\nday she was so feverish that no one but her papa and Nurse were allowed\nto see her--not even Selina; but by another day, the feverish symptoms\nentirely left her; she felt weak and easily fluttered, but was generally\nquite calm, and at times even cheerful. For some days Matilda, though in\nthe house, was only allowed to come into the room at short intervals.\nMatilda had not sufficient control over her feelings, and the warm\nexpression of an affection, which was now greater than ever, was too\nmuch for poor Leila. She was desired to be as much as possible in the\nopen air, and she was carried out every day into the garden, and sat for\nhours in the shade, taking a little turn now and then, leaning upon her\npapa. The first time she went out was a great trial to her, and for some\ntime she wept silently; then taking her papa’s hand as they sat together\nunder a tree in the garden, she said:--\n\n“Papa, I have made you more sorry, but it is over now; it was just at\nfirst--indeed I could not help it, for the air brought to me the sweet\nsmell of the flowers which I can no longer see, and from the feeling on\nmy eyelids I know the sun must be shining gloriously. O, how I used to\nlike to gaze on the rising sun, and to watch the soft grey of the\nmorning fading before his golden light! and it brought grand feelings to\nmy mind, and good feelings too, papa, for it made me think of Him who is\nmore glorious than the sun.”\n\n“Yes, my child, but that feeling can still be yours, and even in a\nhigher degree, for this trial may lead you to raise your mind more\nconstantly to Him in whose presence there is everlasting light.”\n\n“Yes, papa, I know it, and I will pray for this. Do you remember the\ntext in Isaiah which says, ‘I will bring the blind by a way that they\nknow not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known; I will\nmake darkness light before them, and crooked things straight; these\nthings will I do unto them, and not forsake them.’ And God may do this\nto me, papa; He may open the eyes of my mind, and make it all more light\nto me. And I have many pleasures yet, you know: I have you, papa; and\nthat is more than a pleasure, it is my happiness. O you don’t know what\nI feel when you are near me; I am not melancholy then; indeed I am never\nso melancholy as I thought I should be; I know when it is light and\nwhen it is dark quite well; and once you know I saw your face for a\nmoment; I think I should be quite happy if I got leave to see you for a\nmoment every day, but Dr. B---- says I must not--why, papa?”\n\n“Because, my love, nothing must be done to increase the injury on the\nnerves; therefore you must not try to force your eyelids up.”\n\n“Well, papa, I will try to be patient; but I may hope not to be always\nblind. You know Jesus Christ opened the eyes of many that were blind: He\nwas full of pity, and I may pray to Him to open my eyes,--that is, if He\nthinks it good for me.”\n\n“Yes, my child, such prayers, leaving all to Him, cannot fail to be\nacceptable in His sight. He has loved you, Leila, from your birth, with\nmore than an earthly love; and never more, I feel sure, than at this\nmoment, when you are bowing meekly to His will. His deathless love is\naround, and above you, even now; He can wipe all tears from your eyes\nwith a hand that never comforted in vain; He can give you happy dreams\nof green pastures and still waters, and brighter and brighter hopes of\nthat dear home, where no darkness, no grief, no fear can enter; only the\neternal shining of a light divine, and joy unspeakable! Now, sweet one,\nwe must walk a little, I must not talk to you too much.”\n\n“But, papa, such talk as this!”\n\n“No, not even such talk as this; I must not strain your mind in any way,\nmy Leila.”\n\n“Then, papa, take me to the bee-hives, I think I should like to hear the\nbees humming.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nMore than a fortnight had passed away, and Leila’s general health was\ngreatly strengthened, though she had had many agitating scenes to go\nthrough. The meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Herbert and Mina had at first\naffected her much, but she had now great pleasure in their society, and\nthey came frequently, and spent the whole day, for Leila clung more to\nMrs. Herbert than ever. It was a great pleasure to her to lie on the\nsofa with her knitting, and to listen to general conversation; and Mr.\nHoward was most desirous in every way to promote her cheerfulness.\nCharles’s visits had been almost daily; though he had been permitted to\nsee Leila only for a few minutes at a time. He was now, however,\nfrequently allowed to lead her on Selim for a short ride, and Leila\nassured her papa that each time she felt her courage increase so much,\nthat she was sure before long she should be able to ride out with him as\nusual.\n\n“Yes, papa,” she said, “you must not be melancholy about me, for I am\nnot unhappy. Nurse sometimes thinks I am, but indeed I am not; she\nfancies it, I believe, because I do not speak so much now; I like to\nthink and be still; you know, papa, my world is more within me now--I do\nnot see its beautiful sunsets, its woods, its flowers; its broad river\nwith its green banks, which I used to love so much; and so I picture\nthem in my own mind, and seem to dream of them, though I am awake. It is\nthat which makes me often still, papa; and I like those dreams, they\nmake me happy now.”\n\n“Yes, my own Leila, I can understand all this; but those day-dreams must\nnot be too much indulged in; there might be danger then of your finding\nyour pleasures in life more in reverie, than in useful exertion and in\nactive duty; for you must not fancy, my dear child, that you have not\nthe same duties to perform now as you formerly had; as your health\nstrengthens, I should wish you to return as much as possible to your\nformer habits.”\n\n“But, papa, I can do so little now.”\n\n“Not so, my love; in a very short time you will be surprised to find how\nmuch you can do, and how independent you have become. Do you remember,\nat first you were afraid to move across the room, and now you seem to\nwalk fearlessly over almost every part of the house.”\n\n“Yes, papa, I am not the least afraid now, and since I have been blind,\nGod seems to have opened my ears more and more; before, I always knew\nyour footstep, and it made me glad; but now, I know the step of every\none in the house, and yours though ever so far off; and when you are\nquite still, I know your breathing, and I like to listen to it so much.\nO, I have many pleasures--why do you sigh, papa?--you must not do that,\nit makes me sorry; Selina often sighs when I talk to her, and even\nMatilda; and sometimes when Matilda begins to laugh, she stops herself\nquite suddenly--I wish she would not, I like to hear her laugh. Papa, I\nhave never heard you laugh since _that day_; my own papa, you must\ntry--you must be merry with me again;”--and she held out her hand.\n\nMr. Howard pressed it fondly. “My Leila, my precious one!” was all he\ncould say.\n\n“Yes, your precious one; how I like you to call me that! Come, let me\nsing to you; now don’t say, ‘Another day, Leila, not now,’--for it is\nnot to be another day, I am quite able for it now--so let your precious\none have her guitar again.”\n\nShe rose to search for it in its accustomed corner: Mr. Howard had had\nit removed, but he placed it in her hands again, and she seated herself\nby his side, and began to sing one of his most favourite airs. At first\nher voice was weak and tremulous; but gradually it acquired more\nfirmness, though there was so much of unusual melancholy in its rich and\nliquid tones, that filled Mr. Howard’s eyes with tears. She evidently\nfound it a great effort to continue, and her next choice was a more\nlively air.\n\n“Now, papa,” she said, as the second song was ended, “I hope I have\ncheered you again; I should not have tried to sing that melancholy\nsong.”\n\nAlas! dear child, she could not see that her second attempt had only\nincreased Mr. Howard’s agitation; but hastily brushing his hand across\nhis eyes, he said, in a steady and even cheerful voice, “No more at\npresent, my sweet child; but now every day you shall sing to your papa\nas usual, and cheer him as you have ever done; but what does Amy\nwant?--this is the second time she has looked into the room.”\n\n“Oh, I know,” Leila answered. “Yes, Amy, I am coming presently--I know,\npapa, what she wants; at this hour she always takes me to visit my pets,\nand they are getting quite fond of me again, which makes me so happy. At\nfirst they did not like me so much, because I was blind; they fluttered\nabout, and seemed afraid of me--not Dash nor Selina, they were always\nkind; Selina seems getting quite young again, for she frisks about me\nalways, jumps up when I am passing by, and purs so loud, that I am\nafraid she will make herself quite hoarse; and as to Dash, you don’t\nknow what a dog he is--wherever I am now, he lies outside the door, and\nthe moment I go out he follows; he does not think it is enough that I\nshould be alone with Amy, and looks at her she says quite\nsuspiciously;--when you are there he does not follow me quite so close,\nbut when I am alone with her he is touching me the whole time. Yesterday\nhe pulled me aside by my dress; Amy said it was because there was a\nstone in my path, and he was afraid I might strike my foot against it;\nand another day he seized a large branch of a tree in his mouth, (which\nhad fallen down,) and threw it aside with such indignation, and looked\nat her quite angrily, as if she were leading me into danger. Poor Dash,\nhe does not know how very kind Amy is to me, papa; I cannot persuade her\nyet to return to her own room at night; she still lies on that little\nhard mattress at the foot of my bed, and when I tell her not to do it,\nit makes her sorry.”\n\n“Yes, my child, I know she does; and I am sure she prefers doing so.”\n\n“I think so too, papa, and for many days I am sure she never slept, for\nalways when I awoke I found her standing by my bed, ready to give me my\nlemonade, or to rub my feet, or do whatever I wished, to make me sleep\nagain. Papa, if this trial had not come to me, I never should have known\nthe love that is in many hearts for me; I cannot speak about Selina, I\ncannot tell you what she is to me; and Matilda, so gentle to me and so\nkind; and Mrs. Roberts also; then Mrs. Herbert, Charles, and Mina; but\nit would take me all the day to tell you of all the kindnesses to\nme,--and I am forgetting that Amy is waiting, for I could chat away with\nyou, papa, for ever; but now I must go and chat a little to my parrots,\nor they will be quite jealous. And then Amy has to give me my lesson of\nflowers; she is teaching me to know them all by the touch, for you know\nit is better to be prepared for what _may be_. I hope you are not\nlooking melancholy because I am saying this. Good-bye, dear papa.” She\nwas gone, or a long and deep-drawn sigh would have reached her ear.\n\nWeeks and months passed on, and though Leila had no fixed complaint, her\nhealth was not what it had been before, and the prospect of her\nrecovering her sight seemed gradually to be becoming more uncertain. It\nwas well for her, dear child, that she could not see the mournful looks\nwith which her papa often now regarded her, as she, with increased\nanxiety to acquire habits of independence, performed her daily duties.\n\nIt was evident that Leila was preparing her mind to meet, not only with\nresignation, but with cheerfulness, what but a few short months before\nwould have weighed her to the ground. How deeply had she felt poor\nSusan’s state; how often had she looked at the sightless eyes of the\nblind girl, and said to herself, “How can she bear it? O any trial but\nthis!” And this trial was now hers; it came upon her in a moment.\nSuddenly was the whole face of nature shut out from her sight; yet,\nafter the first natural anguish was over, there came also to her young\nheart that faith, that reliance, which shed peace and light on her\ndarkest moments.\n\nHer little scholars now came to her as usual; they daily read the Bible\nto her, and also other books suited to their age, and in this occupation\nshe took much interest. Susan also came frequently, and either Selina or\nMatilda read to her while Leila listened.\n\n“I wish Susan were nearer us,” she said one morning to Selina, as Susan\nleft the room; “how kind in you both to take such pains with her; she\nsays it is her happiest time when she is with us; and do you know what I\nhave been wishing for a long time, and making a little plan in my own\nmind about? I have been wishing that we could find a house in our\nvillage for Susan’s mother, and then poor Susan would come oftener, for\nshe would not have so far to walk; and yesterday I spoke to papa about\nit; he said he did not quite see how it could be managed, but that he\nwould turn it in his mind. When papa says he will turn it in his mind,\nhe is sure to turn and twist it into the right thing.”\n\n“But how,” Matilda inquired, “can Uncle Howard twist Susan’s mother and\nall her five brothers and sisters into a house in the village, when\nthere is not one empty, and all the people quite healthy, not the least\nlikely to die? He must twist them out first, and that would not be\ncivil.”\n\n“I don’t know, Matilda, but I am sure my papa will not do any thing\nunkind, and yet I think he will manage it; I knew by the sound of his\nvoice that he thought it possible, and I have been thinking a great deal\nof all I could do for Susan to make her happier; for she has not all my\ncomforts and pleasures, and she has not a Selina and a Matilda to be\neyes to her, and to make every thing cheerful to her, and even light;\nfor when I am with you, I scarcely feel that I am blind at all.”\n\nSelina sighed deeply, but did not answer.\n\n“Now, why do you sigh, Selina? that must not be. Do not pity me; you\nmust get reconciled as I am doing--you must, both of you, help me to be\ncheerful; and you, Matilda, must try to laugh a great deal more than you\ndo now, for I like so much to hear you merry. And look, Selina, what a\npretty nosegay I am tying up for you; is it not very well arranged for a\nlittle blind girl? Amy says I am improving every day now; you see I\narrange the green leaves and the different colours of the flowers, so as\nto have a grand effect. At first they used to be all higgledy piggledy,\nas Peggie Dobie would say. What excellent words Peggie Dobie has; don’t\nyou think _higgledy piggledy_ delightful? I am sure any one must know it\nmeans confusion. And I shall teach Susan to make nosegays, for I hope\nthere will be a garden to the cottage.”\n\n“And what would Susan do with so many nosegays?” Matilda inquired.\n\n“Perhaps she might sell the nosegays at Richmond, and make a little more\nmoney for her mother, which would make her so happy. She might sit under\nthe trees on the terrace early in the mornings before she came to us,\nand she could knit all the time, and be as busy as if she were at home.\nI daresay every one would like to buy nosegays from a blind girl, I am\nsure I should; and I think Nurse would perhaps allow me to give her my\nsecond best bonnet, to keep the hot sun off her eyelids; I am sure it\nmust be looking very old now, though I am afraid Nurse does not think\nso, for she makes me stretch out the strings every day, and says it is\nwonderful how long things will look respectable with proper management.”\n\n“Yes,” Matilda said, “and you are so terribly conscientious, Leila, and\nstretch away so every morning, that I am afraid your strings never will\nlook disrespectable; if I were you I would begin to crumple them a\nlittle now. Do begin to-morrow.”\n\nSelina looked up. “How you talk, Matilda; you know very well you would\nnot do so now.”\n\n“Then you do think me a little improved, Selina?”\n\n“Not a little, but a great deal improved.”\n\n“O, I am so glad; and you, Cousin Leila, should be glad also, for it is\nall owing to you. When I saw you so good and patient, and trying always\nto bear your trial so well, I prayed a great deal to be made good and\npatient too, for you know I have my little trials; always the holding up\nmy head, and the never putting my elbows on the table, or being the\nleast comfortable, all those hundred little botherations that used to\nput me wild; I do think I bear them a little better now. But you will be\nrewarded for bearing your great trials as you do, for I am sure God\nmust love you so much; that very soon now He will open your eyes, and\nyou will see as well as we do. O what joy then--what joy!”\n\n“Hush! Matilda, hush! do not say it,” Leila hastily answered. “God does\nlove me, I feel He does, for He gives me sweet, peaceful feelings now,\nand makes me happy; but His ways are different. He does what is best for\nme, and I am making up my mind, for I feel as if I were to be always\nblind. Selina knows it, for I have told her; and now that I have told\nyou, I shall be happier. I wish I could speak about it to papa too, but\nI can’t just yet. Don’t cry, Matilda, don’t, my own dear Matilda.” She\nthrew her arms round her and kissed her fondly. “Now there is a dear\none; you will be good, you will be patient, and say it is all quite,\nquite right. You know, Matilda it must be so.” Her soft soothing voice\nwas silent; she gently disengaged herself from Matilda, and left the\nroom.\n\nAnd it was really so; Leila had struggled hard with herself, and had all\nbut conquered. She now strongly felt that entire dependence on her\nheavenly Father’s love which she had so fervently prayed for; the idea\nthat she was to be for ever blind had taken strong possession of her,\nand she was resigned. Yet one earthly wish was still unsubdued: it was\nto gaze once more upon her father’s face. “Yes,” she said to herself,\n“once, only once again, and then I feel I shall be able to say from my\nvery heart, ‘Thy will be done.’”\n\nBut how was this to be accomplished? She felt she could never tell her\nfather that she wished to see him for the last time; she could never\ngive him that bitter pang. And there were other difficulties. She could\nsee him only when looking down upon him; how was this to be managed? She\nthought of it constantly; no way presented itself. Yet time pressed, for\nshe felt as if every day her eyelids were getting more stiff and\ndepressed; in fact, the struggle in her mind was affecting her general\nhealth. Circumstances, however, favoured her unexpectedly. Mr. Howard\nhad spent a whole forenoon in London; Leila had for hours expected him,\nand he returned fatigued and dispirited. He had been to arrange a\nconsultation for the following day with regard to Leila’s health, which\nwas now daily giving him much uneasiness. Leila immediately became aware\nthat he was out of spirits.\n\n“Dear papa,” she said, “I am sure you are feeling unwell, you have\nover-fatigued yourself. Do let me take care of you and make you better.\nYou shall lie down on the sofa, and I will sing you to sleep. Sleep is\nthe very thing you want. Now, there is a dear papa, stretch yourself\nout; now then let me arrange the pillows comfortably.” She passed her\nlittle hand below her papa’s head, and raised it gently, “There\nnow,--so; is not that comfortable? Now I shall take my guitar, and sing\nyou a sweet lullaby; but you must shut your dear eyes first. Are you\nshutting them, papa?” She passed her hand across Mr. Howard’s eyes. “O\nyou naughty papa, they are wide open.”\n\nThey were indeed open, they were earnestly fixed upon the pale\ncountenance of his child. Softly drawing down his eyelids, she drew a\nchair close to the sofa, and striking a few chords, she began to sing in\na sweet low voice, and after a little while Mr. Howard dropped asleep.\nLeila was immediately aware of this; she continued singing for a few\nminutes, as she watched his regular breathing; by degrees her voice sunk\nto the lowest whisper, then altogether ceased. For a moment she bent\nover him and listened. “Now is the time,” she said; and mounting upon\nthe chair on which she had been seated, she gently raised her eyelids,\nand stood gazing down upon him.\n\nWas she looking upon that much loved face for the last time? She felt as\nif it were so. “O my Father in Heaven,” she said, “give me of thy\nstrength! I thought I had been resigned; O pardon a poor weak child, and\nmake me strong!”\n\nA deep sigh awoke Mr. Howard; he opened his eyes. Was it a deep spirit\nfrom a world unseen, who stood gazing upon him with a look of more than\nearthly love, or was it indeed his child? He started up, and Leila threw\nherself into his arms.\n\n“Forgive me, dearest papa,” she said, “I could not help it; once more to\nsee your face, papa, only once more;” then gradually becoming more calm,\nshe entered fully on the subject, and poured out all that had been so\nlong struggling in her heart. “And now, papa, I feel that God will\nstrengthen me to be resigned. You know He says,--‘When thou passest\nthrough the waters I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they\nshall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt\nnot be burned, neither shall the fire kindle upon thee.’ And has it not\ncome true with me, papa? He saved me in the waters, and in the fire; and\nshall I not trust in Him? I feel now as if He did not mean to open my\neyes, but it must be right.”\n\nMr. Howard did not attempt to conceal from Leila that of late he too had\nfelt less sanguine as to her recovering her eyesight, but still he said\nthat he felt it a duty to employ every human means; and he informed her\nof the meeting he had appointed for next day. She struggled to conceal\nher emotion from him; but it was evident that this intelligence made the\neffort still more difficult.\n\nThe consultation took place as had been appointed, and the result was\nmore favourable than either Mr. Howard or Leila had dared to hope. The\nphysicians by no means despaired of Leila recovering the power of\nraising her eyelids. They thought that the weakened state of her general\nhealth, and the excitement of her too sensitive mind in the continual\neffort she had made to conceal her feelings, had probably hitherto\nretarded her recovery. They recommended her instantly being removed to\nBrighton, with only her papa and Selina, and that sea-baths and\ngalvanism should be tried. Poor Matilda! what a trial was this\nseparation to her. How often did she resolve to bear it heroically, and\nhow often did her good resolutions give way to tears and lamentations!\nIn vain Selina reminded her that she had resolved to bear her trials\nwell. “My little trials,” she answered, “but a great trial like this!\nNo, no, Selina; how can you be so unreasonable? I said nothing about a\ngreat one, and I am not like Leila, or you, I must cry, and I should.”\n\nYet even in her most sorrowful moments Matilda kept constantly saying\nshe felt sure Leila would get quite well. She had always thought so, and\nnow she saw those excellent wise physicians thought so too, and Leila\nwould return to them seeing as well as she ever had done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nMatilda’s bright anticipations were realized. We pass over many weary\nweeks and months, for Leila’s recovery was tedious, and there were many\nfluctuations, but she did recover; and towards the end of April she\nreturned to Woodlands in all the joy of restored sight, and once more\ndid she lift her eyes to the rising sun stealing over the glad earth\nwith steps of light, awakening all nature with the spirit of gladness\nand of life! How more than ever beautiful was the soft fresh green of\nspring to her delighted eyes! One universal garden seemed to bloom\nbeneath her feet; one universal hymn of praise was in the song of the\nbird, in the murmur of the stream, and, above all, in her own grateful,\ndevoted heart. And what was Matilda’s joy, what was the joy of Charles\nand Mina, and of all those many friends of high and low degree who loved\nher dearly? for all were there to welcome her return. Peggy Dobie\npressing forward amongst the first to bless her dear, dear bairn, with\na glow upon her cheeks which made her look young again.\n\nMatilda, capering around her at one moment, in the next holding her in\nher arms, looking into her eyes with tearful joy, and exclaiming,--“Your\ndear one, you more than darling! and with your eyes so bright, so\nopen--only at times the slightest little beautiful droop, just to remind\nus of what has been. Did I not tell you how it would be? did I not say\nyou would again see better than any of us?”\n\nAnd Charles, what did he say? _Nothing._ He stood gazing into Leila’s\neyes as if he could have looked into them for ever, then raising her\nhand, he pressed it to his lips.\n\n“Charles,” she said, “how strange you are. Amy does that sometimes to\nme; she says it is from love and respect; it is from love and respect,\neh, Charles?”\n\nThe happiness of this happy day seemed every hour to increase. In the\nevening they all walked to the village, and what did Leila see just\nbefore entering it? A pretty cottage in a lovely little garden, blooming\nwith flowers, roses and honeysuckles trained on its white walls, a green\nturf seat by the side of its little porch, and a bee-hive in a sheltered\ncorner. And this was Mr. Howard’s glad surprise for Leila; this was a\ncottage he had directed should be built during their absence for\nSusan’s mother, and in two days, on the first of May, she was to take\npossession of it.\n\nThere were others who looked forward to May-day with eager expectation;\nfor an old custom was to be revived, a youthful queen was to be chosen.\nLeila herself, though at a distance, had for some time been all anxiety\non this subject, revolving in her mind the different merits of her\nlittle scholars, and scarcely knowing which most to wish should obtain\nthe promised honour. And she had returned to witness this; returned able\nto _see_ and to enjoy it all. What happiness, what deep gratitude was\nhers!\n\nNext day all was joyful bustle and activity. The village children were\nup with the sun, and while the dew still lay upon the grass, the crystal\ndrops sparkled on every tree and shrub, their merry voices mingled with\nthe song of the skylark, and, like the bee, they were darting from\nflower to flower, wandering far and wide amidst banks of primroses,\nlilies of the valley, and dark blue harebells. Long did they pursue\ntheir pleasant toil, and in the evening they returned to it again, and\nnot till twilight shades had fallen on the lovely valley, and the silver\nmoon had risen to guide them on their way, were they to be seen trooping\nhomewards, laden with green boughs and heaps of blooming flowers. It\nwas but a short repose that lulled any of them to forgetfulness that\nnight; they were up by the first streak of day to weave the garlands for\ntheir youthful queen, and the morning rose fair and bright upon their\npleasant labours. Matilda for some time past had been giving them\ninstructions in the art of weaving garlands, and many of them did great\ncredit to their little mistress. She had a few days before constructed\nfor them a crown which they were to imitate, and so well did they now\nsucceed, that it seemed an equal grief to old and young that any thing\nso beautiful should ever fade.\n\nSelina had returned to her own home; but it had been arranged that\nMatilda and she were to be early at Woodlands on May morning, to\naccompany Leila to the village, that they might all be there when the\nqueen was chosen. Leila’s own repose was also somewhat broken on the eve\nof this eventful day, and having risen early, dressed herself and\noffered up her prayer and grateful praise, she seated herself at the\nopen window to watch for the expected summons. The morning breeze blew\nsoftly on her blooming cheek, her whole heart was full of sweet\nemotions; again there was joy to her in every rural sight and sound.\nOften she listened eagerly, and fancied she could hear the joyful hum\nof many voices from the distant village. Again she listened; was it the\nsound of distant music she heard? It went, and came again, and she could\nnow hear distinctly a chorus of youthful voices rising on the passing\nbreeze, and could distinguish at intervals, wending their way through\nthe wood, a group of the village children, dressed in white, carrying\ngarlands and green boughs. As they emerged into the open lawn, the group\ndivided, and she saw, surrounded by this youthful band, her beautiful\nSelim, led by Charles, and followed by Mina, Selina, and Matilda. Selim\nwas decked with flowers, and on the pretty saddle-cloth was placed the\ncrown. They all advanced, still singing; and, in breathless surprise,\nLeila listened to the following words:--\n\n    “The sun has risen on high\n      With bright and cheerful ray,\n    To greet with loving eye\n      Our Leila, queen of May!\n\n    “The little birds of air\n      Join in our simple lay,\n    To greet thee, lady fair,\n      Our gentle queen of May!\n\n    “The sweetest flowers of spring\n      Bloom round thy path to-day,\n    A woodland wreath we bring,\n      To crown thee queen of May!\n\n    “Bright sun, gay birds, fair flowers,\n      Speak not alone to-day,\n    From these full hearts of ours,\n      We hail thee, queen of May!”\n\nYes, with the universal assent of all their loving hearts, Leila was\nchosen queen of the May! Wreathed with garlands, she was soon seated on\nher beautiful favourite, and the procession wound its way, the children\nsinging and scattering flowers, to the village green; there, all unknown\nto her, her papa, and all the elders of the party were assembled, and\nunder the Maypole was placed the throne, where, amidst all she loved,\nand cheers from old and young, was Leila crowned and proclaimed Queen of\nthe May!\n\n“Did I no’ aye tell ye that peerless jewel o’ a bairn was fit to grace a\ncrown?” was Peggy Dobie’s observation.\n\n                               THE END.\n",
