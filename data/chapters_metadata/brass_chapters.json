HORACE VENTIMORE RECEIVES A COMMISSION\n\n\n\"This day six weeks--just six weeks ago!\" Horace Ventimore said, half\naloud, to himself, and pulled out his watch. \"Half-past twelve--what was\nI doing at half-past twelve?\"\n\nAs he sat at the window of his office in Great Cloister Street,\nWestminster, he made his thoughts travel back to a certain glorious\nmorning in August which now seemed so remote and irrecoverable. At this\nprecise time he was waiting on the balcony of the Hôtel de la Plage--the\nsole hostelry of St. Luc-en-Port, the tiny Normandy watering-place upon\nwhich, by some happy inspiration, he had lighted during a solitary\ncycling tour--waiting until She should appear.\n\nHe could see the whole scene: the tiny cove, with the violet shadow of\nthe cliff sleeping on the green water; the swell of the waves lazily\nlapping against the diving-board from which he had plunged half an hour\nbefore; he remembered the long swim out to the buoy; the exhilarated\nanticipation with which he had dressed and climbed the steep path to the\nhotel terrace.\n\nFor was he not to pass the whole remainder of that blissful day in\nSylvia Futvoye's society? Were they not to cycle together (there were,\nof course, others of the party--but they did not count), to cycle over\nto Veulettes, to picnic there under the cliff, and ride back--always\ntogether--in the sweet-scented dusk, over the slopes, between the\npoplars or the cornfields glowing golden against a sky of warm purple?\n\nNow he saw himself going round to the gravelled courtyard in front of\nthe hotel with a sudden dread of missing her. There was nothing there\nbut the little low cart, with its canvas tilt which was to convey\nProfessor Futvoye and his wife to the place of _rendezvous_.\n\nThere was Sylvia at last, distractingly fair and fresh in her cool pink\nblouse and cream-coloured skirt; how gracious and friendly and generally\ndelightful she had been throughout that unforgettable day, which was\nsupreme amongst others only a little less perfect, and all now fled for\never!\n\nThey had had drawbacks, it was true. Old Futvoye was perhaps the least\nbit of a bore at times, with his interminable disquisitions on Egyptian\nart and ancient Oriental character-writing, in which he seemed convinced\nthat Horace must feel a perfervid interest, as, indeed, he thought it\npolitic to affect. The Professor was a most learned archæologist, and\npositively bulged with information on his favourite subjects; but it is\njust possible that Horace might have been less curious concerning the\ndistinction between Cuneiform and Aramæan or Kufic and Arabic\ninscriptions if his informant had happened to be the father of anybody\nelse. However, such insincerities as these are but so many evidences of\nsincerity.\n\nSo with self-tormenting ingenuity Horace conjured up various pictures\nfrom that Norman holiday of his: the little half-timbered cottages with\ntheir faded blue shutters and the rushes growing out of their thatch\nroofs; the spires of village churches gleaming above the bronze-green\nbeeches; the bold headlands, their ochre and yellow cliffs contrasting\ngrimly with the soft ridges of the turf above them; the tethered\nblack-and-white cattle grazing peacefully against a background of lapis\nlazuli and malachite sea, and in every scene the sensation of Sylvia's\nnear presence, the sound of her voice in his ears. And now?... He looked\nup from the papers and tracing-cloth on his desk, and round the small\npanelled room which served him as an office, at the framed plans and\nphotographs, the set squares and T squares on the walls, and felt a dull\nresentment against his surroundings. From his window he commanded a\ncheerful view of a tall, mouldering wall, once part of the Abbey\nboundaries, surmounted by _chevaux-de-frise_, above whose\nrust-attenuated spikes some plane trees stretched their yellowing\nbranches.\n\n\"She would have come to care for me,\" Horace's thoughts ran on,\ndisjointedly. \"I could have sworn that that last day of all--and her\npeople didn't seem to object to me. Her mother asked me cordially enough\nto call on them when they were back in town. When I did----\"\n\nWhen he had called, there had been a difference--not an unusual sequel\nto an acquaintanceship begun in a Continental watering-place. It was\ndifficult to define, but unmistakable--a certain formality and\nconstraint on Mrs. Futvoye's part, and even on Sylvia's, which seemed\nintended to warn him that it is not every friendship that survives the\nChannel passage. So he had gone away sore at heart, but fully\nrecognising that any advances in future must come from their side. They\nmight ask him to dinner, or at least to call again; but more than a\nmonth had passed, and they had made no sign. No, it was all over; he\nmust consider himself dropped.\n\n\"After all,\" he told himself, with a short and anything but mirthful\nlaugh, \"it's natural enough. Mrs. Futvoye has probably been making\ninquiries about my professional prospects. It's better as it is. What\nearthly chance have I got of marrying unless I can get work of my own?\nIt's all I can do to keep myself decently. I've no right to dream of\nasking any one--to say nothing of Sylvia--to marry me. I should only be\nrushing into temptation if I saw any more of her. She's not for a poor\nbeggar like me, who was born unlucky. Well, whining won't do any\ngood--let's have a look at Beevor's latest performance.\"\n\nHe spread out a large coloured plan, in a corner of which appeared the\nname of \"William Beevor, Architect,\" and began to study it in a spirit\nof anything but appreciation.\n\n\"Beevor gets on,\" he said to himself. \"Heaven knows that I don't grudge\nhim his success. He's a good fellow--though he _does_ build\narchitectural atrocities, and seem to like 'em. Who am I to give myself\nairs? He's successful--I'm not. Yet if I only had his opportunities,\nwhat wouldn't I make of them!\"\n\nLet it be said here that this was not the ordinary self-delusion of an\nincompetent. Ventimore really had talent above the average, with ideals\nand ambitions which might under better conditions have attained\nrecognition and fulfilment before this.\n\nBut he was not quite energetic enough, besides being too proud, to push\nhimself into notice, and hitherto he had met with persistent ill-luck.\n\nSo Horace had no other occupation now but to give Beevor, whose offices\nand clerk he shared, such slight assistance as he might require, and it\nwas by no means cheering to feel that every year of this enforced\nsemi-idleness left him further handicapped in the race for wealth and\nfame, for he had already passed his twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nIf Miss Sylvia Futvoye had indeed felt attracted towards him at one time\nit was not altogether incomprehensible. Horace Ventimore was not a model\nof manly beauty--models of manly beauty are rare out of novels, and\nseldom interesting in them; but his clear-cut, clean-shaven face\npossessed a certain distinction, and if there were faint satirical lines\nabout the mouth, they were redeemed by the expression of the grey-blue\neyes, which were remarkably frank and pleasant. He was well made, and\ntall enough to escape all danger of being described as short;\nfair-haired and pale, without being unhealthily pallid, in complexion,\nand he gave the impression of being a man who took life as it came, and\nwhose sense of humour would serve as a lining for most clouds that might\ndarken his horizon.\n\nThere was a rap at the door which communicated with Beevor's office, and\nBeevor himself, a florid, thick-set man, with small side-whiskers, burst\nin.\n\n\"I say, Ventimore, you didn't run off with the plans for that house I'm\nbuilding at Larchmere, did you? Because--ah, I see you're looking over\nthem. Sorry to deprive you, but----\"\n\n\"Thanks, old fellow, take them, by all means. I've seen all I wanted to\nsee.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm just off to Larchmere now. Want to be there to check the\nquantities, and there's my other house at Fittlesdon. I must go on\nafterwards and set it out, so I shall probably be away some days. I'm\ntaking Harrison down, too. You won't be wanting him, eh?\"\n\nVentimore laughed. \"I can manage to do nothing without a clerk to help\nme. Your necessity is greater than mine. Here are the plans.\"\n\n\"I'm rather pleased with 'em myself, you know,\" said Beevor; \"that roof\nought to look well, eh? Good idea of mine lightening the slate with that\nornamental tile-work along the top. You saw I put in one of your windows\nwith just a trifling addition. I was almost inclined to keep both gables\nalike, as you suggested, but it struck me a little variety--one red\nbrick and the other 'parged'--would be more out-of-the-way.\"\n\n\"Oh, much,\" agreed Ventimore, knowing that to disagree was useless.\n\n\"Not, mind you,\" continued Beevor, \"that I believe in going in for too\nmuch originality in domestic architecture. The average client no more\nwants an original house than he wants an original hat; he wants\nsomething he won't feel a fool in. I've often thought, old man, that\nperhaps the reason why you haven't got on----you don't mind my speaking\ncandidly, do you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said Ventimore, cheerfully. \"Candour's the cement of\nfriendship. Dab it on.\"\n\n\"Well, I was only going to say that you do yourself no good by all those\nconfoundedly unconventional ideas of yours. If you had your chance\nto-morrow, it's my belief you'd throw it away by insisting on some\nfantastic fad or other.\"\n\n\"These speculations are a trifle premature, considering that there\ndoesn't seem the remotest prospect of my ever getting a chance at all.\"\n\n\"I got mine before I'd set up six months,\" said Beevor. \"The great\nthing, however,\" he went on, with a flavour of personal application, \"is\nto know how to use it when it _does_ come. Well, I must be off if I mean\nto catch that one o'clock from Waterloo. You'll see to anything that may\ncome in for me while I'm away, won't you, and let me know? Oh, by the\nway, the quantity surveyor has just sent in the quantities for that\nschoolroom at Woodford--do you mind running through them and seeing\nthey're right? And there's the specification for the new wing at\nTusculum Lodge--you might draft that some time when you've nothing else\nto do. You'll find all the papers on my desk. Thanks awfully, old chap.\"\n\nAnd Beevor hurried back to his own room, where for the next few minutes\nhe could be heard bustling Harrison, the clerk, to make haste; then a\nhansom was whistled for, there were footsteps down the old stairs, the\nsounds of a departing vehicle on the uneven stones, and after that\nsilence and solitude.\n\nIt was not in Nature to avoid feeling a little envious. Beevor had work\nto do in the world: even if it chiefly consisted in profaning sylvan\nretreats by smug or pretentious villas, it was still work which\nentitled him to consideration and respect in the eyes of all\nright-minded persons.\n\nAnd nobody believed in Horace; as yet he had never known the\nsatisfaction of seeing the work of his brain realised in stone and brick\nand mortar; no building stood anywhere to bear testimony to his\nexistence and capability long after he himself should have passed away.\n\nIt was not a profitable train of thought, and, to escape from it, he\nwent into Beevor's room and fetched the documents he had mentioned--at\nleast they would keep him occupied until it was time to go to his club\nand lunch. He had no sooner settled down to his calculations, however,\nwhen he heard a shuffling step on the landing, followed by a knock at\nBeevor's office-door. \"More work for Beevor,\" he thought; \"what luck the\nfellow has! I'd better go in and explain that he's just left town on\nbusiness.\"\n\nBut on entering the adjoining room he heard the knocking repeated--this\ntime at his own door; and hastening back to put an end to this somewhat\nundignified form of hide-and-seek, he discovered that this visitor at\nleast was legitimately his, and was, in fact, no other than Professor\nAnthony Futvoye himself.\n\nThe Professor was standing in the doorway peering short-sightedly\nthrough his convex glasses, his head protruded from his loosely-fitting\ngreat-coat with an irresistible suggestion of an inquiring tortoise. To\nHorace his appearance was more welcome than that of the wealthiest\nclient--for why should Sylvia's father take the trouble to pay him this\nvisit unless he still wished to continue the acquaintanceship? It might\neven be that he was the bearer of some message or invitation.\n\nSo, although to an impartial eye the Professor might not seem the kind\nof elderly gentleman whose society would produce any wild degree of\nexhilaration, Horace was unfeignedly delighted to see him.\n\n\"Extremely kind of you to come and see me like this, sir,\" he said\nwarmly, after establishing him in the solitary armchair reserved for\nhypothetical clients.\n\n\"Not at all. I'm afraid your visit to Cottesmore Gardens some time ago\nwas somewhat of a disappointment.\"\n\n\"A disappointment?\" echoed Horace, at a loss to know what was coming\nnext.\n\n\"I refer to the fact--which possibly, however, escaped your\nnotice\"--explained the Professor, scratching his scanty patch of\ngrizzled whisker with a touch of irascibility, \"that I myself was not at\nhome on that occasion.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I was greatly disappointed,\" said Horace, \"though of course I\nknow how much you are engaged. It's all the more good of you to spare\ntime to drop in for a chat just now.\"\n\n\"I've not come to chat, Mr. Ventimore. I never chat. I wanted to see you\nabout a matter which I thought you might be so obliging as to---- But I\nobserve you are busy--probably too busy to attend to such a small\naffair.\"\n\nIt was clear enough now; the Professor was going to build, and had\ndecided--could it be at Sylvia's suggestion?--to entrust the work to\nhim! But he contrived to subdue any self-betraying eagerness, and reply\n(as he could with perfect truth) that he had nothing on hand just then\nwhich he could not lay aside, and that if the Professor would let him\nknow what he required, he would take it up at once.\n\n\"So much the better,\" said the Professor; \"so much the better. Both my\nwife and daughter declared that it was making far too great a demand\nupon your good nature; but, as I told them, 'I am much mistaken,' I\nsaid, 'if Mr. Ventimore's practice is so extensive that he cannot leave\nit for one afternoon----'\"\n\nEvidently it was not a house. Could he be needed to escort them\nsomewhere that afternoon? Even that was more than he had hoped for a few\nminutes since. He hastened to repeat that he was perfectly free that\nafternoon.\n\n\"In that case,\" said the Professor, beginning to fumble in all his\npockets--was he searching for a note in Sylvia's handwriting?--\"in that\ncase, you will be conferring a real favour on me if you can make it\nconvenient to attend a sale at Hammond's Auction Rooms in Covent Garden,\nand just bid for one or two articles on my behalf.\"\n\nWhatever disappointment Ventimore felt, it may be said to his credit\nthat he allowed no sign of it to appear. \"Of course I'll go, with\npleasure,\" he said, \"if I can be of any use.\"\n\n\"I knew I shouldn't come to you in vain,\" said the Professor. \"I\nremembered your wonderful good nature, sir, in accompanying my wife and\ndaughter on all sorts of expeditions in the blazing hot weather we had\nat St. Luc--when you might have remained quietly at the hotel with me.\nNot that I should trouble you now, only I have to lunch at the Oriental\nClub, and I've an appointment afterwards to examine and report on a\nrecently-discovered inscribed cylinder for the Museum, which will fully\noccupy the rest of the afternoon, so that it's physically impossible for\nme to go to Hammond's myself, and I strongly object to employing a\nbroker when I can avoid it. Where did I put that catalogue?... Ah, here\nit is. This was sent to me by the executors of my old friend, General\nCollingham, who died the other day. I met him at Nakada when I was out\nexcavating some years ago. He was something of a collector in his way,\nthough he knew very little about it, and, of course, was taken in right\nand left. Most of his things are downright rubbish, but there are just a\nfew lots that are worth securing, at a reasonable figure, by some one\nwho knew what he was about.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Professor,\" remonstrated Horace, not relishing this\nresponsibility, \"I'm afraid I'm as likely as not to pick up some of the\nrubbish. I've no special knowledge of Oriental curios.\"\n\n\"At St. Luc,\" said the Professor, \"you impressed me as having, for an\namateur, an exceptionally accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with\nEgyptian and Arabian art from the earliest period.\" (If this were so,\nHorace could only feel with shame what a fearful humbug he must have\nbeen.) \"However, I've no wish to lay too heavy a burden on you, and, as\nyou will see from this catalogue, I have ticked off the lots in which I\nam chiefly interested, and made a note of the limit to which I am\nprepared to bid, so you'll have no difficulty.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Horace; \"I'll go straight to Covent Garden, and slip\nout and get some lunch later on.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps, if you don't mind. The lots I have marked seem to come\non at rather frequent intervals, but don't let that consideration deter\nyou from getting your lunch, and if you _should_ miss anything by not\nbeing on the spot, why, it's of no consequence, though I don't say it\nmightn't be a pity. In any case, you won't forget to mark what each lot\nfetches, and perhaps you wouldn't mind dropping me a line when you\nreturn the catalogue--or stay, could you look in some time after dinner\nthis evening, and let me know how you got on?--that would be better.\"\n\nHorace thought it would be decidedly better, and undertook to call and\nrender an account of his stewardship that evening. There remained the\nquestion of a deposit, should one or more of the lots be knocked down to\nhim; and, as he was obliged to own that he had not so much as ten pounds\nabout him at that particular moment, the Professor extracted a note for\nthat amount from his case, and handed it to him with the air of a\nbenevolent person relieving a deserving object. \"Don't exceed my\nlimits,\" he said, \"for I can't afford more just now; and mind you give\nHammond your own name, not mine. If the dealers get to know I'm after\nthe things, they'll run you up. And now, I don't think I need detain you\nany longer, especially as time is running on. I'm sure I can trust you\nto do the best you can for me. Till this evening, then.\"\n\nA few minutes later Horace was driving up to Covent Garden behind the\nbest-looking horse he could pick out.\n\nThe Professor might have required from him rather more than was strictly\njustified by their acquaintanceship, and taken his acquiescence too much\nas a matter of course--but what of that? After all, he was Sylvia's\nparent.\n\n\"Even with _my_ luck,\" he was thinking, \"I ought to succeed in getting\nat least one or two of the lots he's marked; and if I can only please\nhim, something may come of it.\"\n\nAnd in this sanguine mood Horace entered Messrs. Hammond's well-known\nauction rooms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A CHEAP LOT\n\n\nIn spite of the fact that it was the luncheon hour when Ventimore\nreached Hammond's Auction Rooms, he found the big, skylighted gallery\nwhere the sale of the furniture and effects of the late General\nCollingham was proceeding crowded to a degree which showed that the\ndeceased officer had some reputation as a _connoisseur_.\n\nThe narrow green baize tables below the auctioneer's rostrum were\noccupied by professional dealers, one or two of them women, who sat,\npaper and pencil in hand, with much the same air of apparent apathy and\nreal vigilance that may be noticed in the Casino at Monte Carlo. Around\nthem stood a decorous and businesslike crowd, mostly dealers, of various\ntypes. On a magisterial-looking bench sat the auctioneer, conducting the\nsale with a judicial impartiality and dignity which forbade him, even in\nhis most laudatory comments, the faintest accent of enthusiasm.\n\nThe October sunshine, striking through the glazed roof, re-gilded the\ntarnished gas-stars, and suffused the dusty atmosphere with palest gold.\nBut somehow the utter absence of excitement in the crowd, the calm,\nmethodical tone of the auctioneer, and the occasional mournful cry of\n\"Lot here, gentlemen!\" from the porter when any article was too large to\nmove, all served to depress Ventimore's usually mercurial spirits.\n\nFor all Horace knew, the collection as a whole might be of little value,\nbut it very soon became clear that others besides Professor Futvoye had\nsingled out such gems as there were, also that the Professor had\nconsiderably under-rated the prices they were likely to fetch.\n\nVentimore made his bids with all possible discretion, but time after\ntime he found the competition for some perforated mosque lantern,\nengraved ewer, or ancient porcelain tile so great that his limit was\nsoon reached, and his sole consolation was that the article eventually\nchanged hands for sums which were very nearly double the Professor's\nestimate.\n\nSeveral dealers and brokers, despairing of a bargain that day, left,\nmurmuring profanities; most of those who remained ceased to take a\nserious interest in the proceedings, and consoled themselves with cheap\nwitticisms at every favourable occasion.\n\nThe sale dragged slowly on, and, what with continual disappointment and\nwant of food, Horace began to feel so weary that he was glad, as the\ncrowd thinned, to get a seat at one of the green baize tables, by which\ntime the skylights had already changed from livid grey to slate colour\nin the deepening dusk.\n\nA couple of meek Burmese Buddhas had just been put up, and bore the\nindignity of being knocked down for nine-and-sixpence the pair with\ndreamy, inscrutable simpers; Horace only waited for the final lot marked\nby the Professor--an old Persian copper bowl, inlaid with silver and\nengraved round the rim with an inscription from Hafiz.\n\nThe limit to which he was authorised to go was two pounds ten; but, so\ndesperately anxious was Ventimore not to return empty-handed, that he\nhad made up his mind to bid an extra sovereign if necessary, and say\nnothing about it.\n\nHowever, the bowl was put up, and the bidding soon rose to three pounds\nten, four pounds, four pounds ten, five pounds, five guineas, for which\nlast sum it was acquired by a bearded man on Horace's right, who\nimmediately began to regard his purchase with a more indulgent eye.\n\nVentimore had done his best, and failed; there was no reason now why he\nshould stay a moment longer--and yet he sat on, from sheer fatigue and\ndisinclination to move.\n\n\"Now we come to Lot 254, gentlemen,\" he heard the auctioneer saying,\nmechanically; \"a capital Egyptian mummy-case in fine con---- No, I beg\npardon, I'm wrong. This is an article which by some mistake has been\nomitted from the catalogue, though it ought to have been in it.\nEverything on sale to-day, gentlemen, belonged to the late General\nCollingham. We'll call this No. 253_a_. Antique brass bottle. Very\ncurious.\"\n\nOne of the porters carried the bottle in between the tables, and set it\ndown before the dealers at the farther end with a tired nonchalance.\n\nIt was an old, squat, pot-bellied vessel, about two feet high, with a\nlong thick neck, the mouth of which was closed by a sort of metal\nstopper or cap; there was no visible decoration on its sides, which were\nrough and pitted by some incrustation that had formed on them, and been\npartially scraped off. As a piece of _bric-à-brac_ it certainly\npossessed few attractions, and there was a marked tendency to \"guy\" it\namong the more frivolous brethren.\n\n\"What do you call this, sir?\" inquired one of the auctioneer, with the\nmanner of a cheeky boy trying to get a rise out of his form-master. \"Is\nit as 'unique' as the others?\"\n\n\"You're as well able to judge as I am,\" was the guarded reply. \"Any one\ncan see for himself it's not modern rubbish.\"\n\n\"Make a pretty little ornament for the mantelpiece!\" remarked a wag.\n\n\"Is the top made to unscrew, or what, sir?\" asked a third. \"Seems fixed\non pretty tight.\"\n\n\"I can't say. Probably it has not been removed for some time.\"\n\n\"It's a goodish weight,\" said the chief humorist, after handling it.\n\"What's inside of it, sir--sardines?\"\n\n\"I don't represent it as having anything inside it,\" said the\nauctioneer. \"If you want to know my opinion, I think there's money in\nit.\"\n\n\"'Ow much?\"\n\n\"Don't misunderstand me, gentlemen. When I say I consider there's money\nin it, I'm not alluding to its contents. I've no reason to believe that\nit contains anything. I'm merely suggesting the thing itself may be\nworth more than it looks.\"\n\n\"Ah, it might be _that_ without 'urting itself!\"\n\n\"Well, well, don't let us waste time. Look upon it as a pure\nspeculation, and make me an offer for it, some of you. Come.\"\n\n\"Tuppence-'ap'ny!\" cried the comic man, affecting to brace himself for a\nmighty effort.\n\n\"Pray be serious, gentlemen. We want to get on, you know. Anything to\nmake a start. Five shillings? It's not the value of the metal, but I'll\ntake the bid. Six. Look at it well. It's not an article you come across\nevery day of your lives.\"\n\nThe bottle was still being passed round with disrespectful raps and\nslaps, and it had now come to Ventimore's right-hand neighbour, who\nscrutinised it carefully, but made no bid.\n\n\"That's all _right_, you know,\" he whispered in Horace's ear. \"That's\ngood stuff, that is. If I was you, I'd _'ave_ that.\"\n\n\"Seven shillings--eight--nine bid for it over there in the corner,\" said\nthe auctioneer.\n\n\"If you think it's so good, why don't you have it yourself?\" Horace\nasked his neighbour.\n\n\"Me? Oh, well, it ain't exactly in my line, and getting this last lot\npretty near cleaned me out. I've done for to-day, I 'ave. All the same,\nit is a curiosity; dunno as I've seen a brass vawse just that shape\nbefore, and it's genuine old, though all these fellers are too ignorant\nto know the value of it. So I don't mind giving you the tip.\"\n\nHorace rose, the better to examine the top. As far as he could make out\nin the flickering light of one of the gas-stars, which the auctioneer\nhad just ordered to be lit, there were half-erased scratches and\ntriangular marks on the cap that might possibly be an inscription. If\nso, might there not be the means here of regaining the Professor's\nfavour, which he felt that, as it was, he should probably forfeit,\njustly or not, by his ill-success?\n\nHe could hardly spend the Professor's money on it, since it was not in\nthe catalogue, and he had no authority to bid for it, but he had a few\nshillings of his own to spare. Why not bid for it on his own account as\nlong as he could afford to do so? If he were outbid, as usual, it would\nnot particularly matter.\n\n\"Thirteen shillings,\" the auctioneer was saying, in his dispassionate\ntones. Horace caught his eye, and slightly raised his catalogue, while\nanother man nodded at the same time. \"Fourteen in two places.\" Horace\nraised his catalogue again. \"I won't go beyond fifteen,\" he thought.\n\n\"Fifteen. It's _against_ you, sir. Any advance on fifteen? Sixteen--this\nvery quaint old Oriental bottle going for only sixteen shillings.\n\n\"After all,\" thought Horace, \"I don't mind anything under a pound for\nit.\" And he bid seventeen shillings. \"Eighteen,\" cried his rival, a\nshort, cheery, cherub-faced little dealer, whose neighbours adjured him\nto \"sit quiet like a good little boy and not waste his pocket-money.\"\n\n\"Nineteen!\" said Horace. \"Pound!\" answered the cherubic man.\n\n\"A pound only bid for this grand brass vessel,\" said the auctioneer,\nindifferently. \"All done at a pound?\"\n\nHorace thought another shilling or two would not ruin him, and nodded.\n\n\"A guinea. For the last time. You'll _lose_ it, sir,\" said the\nauctioneer to the little man.\n\n\"Go on, Tommy. Don't you be beat. Spring another bob on it, Tommy,\" his\nfriends advised him ironically; but Tommy shook his head, with the air\nof a man who knows when to draw the line. \"One guinea--and that's not\nhalf its value! Gentleman on my left,\" said the auctioneer, more in\nsorrow than in anger--and the brass bottle became Ventimore's property.\n\nHe paid for it, and, since he could hardly walk home nursing a large\nmetal bottle without attracting an inconvenient amount of attention,\ndirected that it should be sent to his lodgings at Vincent Square.\n\nBut when he was out in the fresh air, walking westward to his club, he\nfound himself wondering more and more what could have possessed him to\nthrow away a guinea--when he had few enough for legitimate expenses--on\nan article of such exceedingly problematical value.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. AN UNEXPECTED OPENING\n\n\nVentimore made his way to Cottesmore Gardens that evening in a highly\ninconsistent, not to say chaotic, state of mind. The thought that he\nwould presently see Sylvia again made his blood course quicker, while he\nwas fully determined to say no more to her than civility demanded.\n\nAt one moment he was blessing Professor Futvoye for his happy thought in\nmaking use of him; at another he was bitterly recognising that it would\nhave been better for his peace of mind if he had been left alone. Sylvia\nand her mother had no desire to see more of him; if they had, they would\nhave asked him to come before this. No doubt they would tolerate him now\nfor the Professor's sake; but who would not rather be ignored than\ntolerated?\n\nThe more often he saw Sylvia the more she would make his heart ache with\nvain longing--whereas he was getting almost reconciled to her\nindifference; he would very soon be cured if he didn't see her.\n\nWhy _should_ he see her? He need not go in at all. He had merely to\nleave the catalogue with his compliments, and the Professor would learn\nall he wanted to know.\n\nOn second thoughts he must go in--if only to return the bank-note. But\nhe would ask to see the Professor in private. Most probably he would not\nbe invited to join his wife and daughter, but if he were, he could make\nsome excuse. They might think it a little odd--a little discourteous,\nperhaps; but they would be too relieved to care much about that.\n\nWhen he got to Cottesmore Gardens, and was actually at the door of the\nFutvoyes' house, one of the neatest and demurest in that retired and\nirreproachable quarter, he began to feel a craven hope that the\nProfessor might be out, in which case he need only leave the catalogue\nand write a letter when he got home, reporting his non-success at the\nsale, and returning the note.\n\nAnd, as it happened, the Professor _was_ out, and Horace was not so glad\nas he thought he should be. The maid told him that the ladies were in\nthe drawing-room, and seemed to take it for granted that he was coming\nin, so he had himself announced. He would not stay long--just long\nenough to explain his business there, and make it clear that he had no\nwish to force his acquaintance upon them. He found Mrs. Futvoye in the\nfarther part of the pretty double drawing-room, writing letters, and\nSylvia, more dazzlingly fair than ever in some sort of gauzy black frock\nwith a heliotrope sash and a bunch of Parma violets on her breast, was\ncomfortably established with a book in the front room, and seemed\nsurprised, if not resentful, at having to disturb herself.\n\n\"I must apologise,\" he began, with an involuntary stiffness, \"for\ncalling at this very unceremonious time; but the fact is, the\nProfessor----\"\n\n\"I know all about it,\" interrupted Mrs. Futvoye, brusquely, while her\nshrewd, light-grey eyes took him in with a cool stare that was\nhumorously observant without being aggressive. \"We heard how shamefully\nmy husband abused your good-nature. Really, it was too bad of him to ask\na busy man like you to put aside his work and go and spend a whole day\nat that stupid auction!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd nothing particular to do. I can't call myself a busy\nman--unfortunately,\" said Horace, with that frankness which scorns to\nconceal what other people know perfectly well already.\n\n\"Ah, well, it's very nice of you to make light of it; but he ought not\nto have done it--after so short an acquaintance, too. And to make it\nworse, he has had to go out unexpectedly this evening, but he'll be back\nbefore very long if you don't mind waiting.\"\n\n\"There's really no need to wait,\" said Horace, \"because this catalogue\nwill tell him everything, and, as the particular things he wanted went\nfor much more than he thought, I wasn't able to get any of them.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm very glad of it,\" said Mrs. Futvoye, \"for his study is\ncrammed with odds and ends as it is, and I don't want the whole house to\nlook like a museum or an antiquity shop. I'd all the trouble in the\nworld to persuade him that a great gaudy gilded mummy-case was not quite\nthe thing for a drawing-room. But, please sit down, Mr. Ventimore.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" stammered Horace, \"but--but I mustn't stay. If you will tell\nthe Professor how sorry I was to miss him, and--and give him back this\nnote which he left with me to cover any deposit, I--I won't interrupt\nyou any longer.\"\n\nHe was, as a rule, imperturbable in most social emergencies, but just\nnow he was seized with a wild desire to escape, which, to his infinite\nmortification, made him behave like a shy schoolboy.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Mrs. Futvoye; \"I am sure my husband would be most\nannoyed if we didn't keep you till he came.\"\n\n\"I really ought to go,\" he declared, wistfully enough.\n\n\"We mustn't tease Mr. Ventimore to stay, mother, when he so evidently\nwants to go,\" said Sylvia, cruelly.\n\n\"Well, I won't detain you--at least, not long. I wonder if you would\nmind posting a letter for me as you pass the pillar-box? I've almost\nfinished it, and it ought to go to-night, and my maid Jessie has such a\nbad cold I really don't like sending her out with it.\"\n\nIt would have been impossible to refuse to stay after that--even if he\nhad wished. It would only be for a few minutes. Sylvia might spare him\nthat much of her time. He should not trouble her again. So Mrs. Futvoye\nwent back to her bureau, and Sylvia and he were practically alone.\n\nShe had taken a seat not far from his, and made a few constrained\nremarks, obviously out of sheer civility. He returned mechanical\nreplies, with a dreary wonder whether this could really be the girl who\nhad talked to him with such charming friendliness and confidence only a\nfew weeks ago in Normandy.\n\nAnd the worst of it was, she was looking more bewitching than ever; her\nslim arms gleaming through the black lace of her sleeves, and the gold\nthreads in her soft masses of chestnut hair sparkling in the light of\nthe shaded lamp behind her. The slight contraction of her eyebrows and\nthe mutinous downward curve of her mouth seemed expressive of boredom.\n\n\"What a dreadfully long time mamma is over that letter!\" she said at\nlast. \"I think I'd better go and hurry her up.\"\n\n\"Please don't--unless you are particularly anxious to get rid of me.\"\n\n\"I thought you seemed particularly anxious to escape,\" she said coldly.\n\"And, as a family, we have certainly taken up quite enough of your time\nfor one day.\"\n\n\"That is not the way you used to talk at St. Luc!\" he said.\n\n\"At St. Luc? Perhaps not. But in London everything is so different, you\nsee.\"\n\n\"Very different.\"\n\n\"When one meets people abroad who--who seem at all inclined to be\nsociable,\" she continued, \"one is so apt to think them pleasanter than\nthey really are. Then one meets them again, and--and wonders what one\never saw to like in them. And it's no use pretending one feels the same,\nbecause they generally understand sooner or later. Don't you find that?\"\n\n\"I do, indeed,\" he said, wincing, \"though I don't know what I've done to\ndeserve that you should tell me so!\"\n\n\"Oh, I was not blaming you. You have been most angelic. I can't think\nhow papa could have expected you to take all that trouble for\nhim--still, you did, though you must have simply hated it.\"\n\n\"But, good heavens! don't you know I should be only too delighted to be\nof the least service to him--or to any of you?\"\n\n\"You looked anything but delighted when you came in just now; you looked\nas if your one idea was to get it over as soon as you could. You know\nperfectly well you're longing now for mother to finish her letter and\nset you free. Do you really think I can't see that?\"\n\n\"If all that is true, or partly true,\" said Horace, \"can't you guess\nwhy?\"\n\n\"I guessed how it was when you called here first that afternoon. Mamma\nhad asked you to, and you thought you might as well be civil; perhaps\nyou really did think it would be pleasant to see us again--but it wasn't\nthe same thing. Oh, I saw it in your face directly--you became\nconventional and distant and horrid, and it made me horrid too; and you\nwent away determined that you wouldn't see any more of us than you could\nhelp. That's why I was so furious when I heard that papa had been to see\nyou, and with such an object.\"\n\nAll this was so near the truth, and yet missed it with such perverse\ningenuity, that Horace felt bound to put himself right.\n\n\"Perhaps I ought to leave things as they are,\" he said, \"but I can't.\nIt's no earthly use, I know; but may I tell you why it really was\npainful to me to meet you again? I thought _you_ were changed, that you\nwished to forget, and wished me to forget--only I can't--that we had\nbeen friends for a short time. And though I never blamed you--it was\nnatural enough--it hit me pretty hard--so hard that I didn't feel\nanxious to repeat the experience.\"\n\n\"Did it hit you hard?\" said Sylvia, softly. \"Perhaps I minded too, just\na very little. However,\" she added, with a sudden smile, that made two\nenchanting dimples in her cheeks, \"it only shows how much more sensible\nit is to have things out. _Now_ perhaps you won't persist in keeping\naway from us?\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said Horace, gloomily, still determined not to let any\ndirect avowal pass his lips, \"it would be best that I _should_ keep\naway.\"\n\nHer half-closed eyes shone through their long lashes; the violets on her\nbreast rose and fell. \"I don't think I understand,\" she said, in a tone\nthat was both hurt and offended.\n\nThere is a pleasure in yielding to some temptations that more than\ncompensates for the pain of any previous resistance. Come what might, he\nwas not going to be misunderstood any longer.\n\n\"If I must tell you,\" he said, \"I've fallen desperately, hopelessly, in\nlove with you. Now you know the reason.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem a very good reason for wanting to go away and never see\nme again. _Does_ it?\"\n\n\"Not when I've no right to speak to you of love?\"\n\n\"But you've done that!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said penitently; \"I couldn't help it. But I never meant to.\nIt slipped out. I quite understand how hopeless it is.\"\n\n\"Of course, if you are so sure as all that, you are quite right not to\ntry.\"\n\n\"Sylvia! You can't mean that--that you do care, after all?\"\n\n\"Didn't you really see?\" she said, with a low, happy laugh. \"How stupid\nof you! And how dear!\"\n\nHe caught her hand, which she allowed to rest contentedly in his. \"Oh,\nSylvia! Then you do--you do! But, my God, what a selfish brute I am! For\nwe can't marry. It may be years before I can ask you to come to me. You\nfather and mother wouldn't hear of your being engaged to me.\"\n\n\"_Need_ they hear of it just yet, Horace?\"\n\n\"Yes, they must. I should feel a cur if I didn't tell your mother, at\nall events.\"\n\n\"Then you shan't feel a cur, for we'll go and tell her together.\" And\nSylvia rose and went into the farther room, and put her arms round her\nmother's neck. \"Mother darling,\" she said, in a half whisper, \"it's\nreally all your fault for writing such very long letters, but--but--we\ndon't exactly know how we came to do it--but Horace and I have got\nengaged somehow. You aren't _very_ angry, are you?\"\n\n\"I think you're both extremely foolish,\" said Mrs. Futvoye, as she\nextricated herself from Sylvia's arms and turned to face Horace. \"From\nall I hear, Mr. Ventimore, you're not in a position to marry at\npresent.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, no\" said Horace; \"I'm making nothing as yet. But my\nchance must come some day. I don't ask you to give me Sylvia till then.\"\n\n\"And you know you like Horace, mother!\" pleaded Sylvia. \"And I'm ready\nto wait for him, any time. Nothing will induce me to give him up, and I\nshall never, never care for anybody else. So you see you may just as\nwell give us your consent!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I've been to blame,\" said Mrs. Futvoye. \"I ought to have\nforeseen this at St. Luc. Sylvia is our only child, Mr. Ventimore, and I\nwould far rather see her happily married than making what is called a\n'grand match.' Still, this really does seem _rather_ hopeless. I am\nquite sure her father would never approve of it. Indeed, it must not be\nmentioned to him--he would only be irritated.\"\n\n\"So long as you are not against us,\" said Horace, \"you won't forbid me\nto see her?\"\n\n\"I believe I ought to,\" said Mrs. Futvoye; \"but I don't object to your\ncoming here occasionally, as an ordinary visitor. Only understand\nthis--until you can prove to my husband's satisfaction that you are able\nto support Sylvia in the manner she has been accustomed to, there must\nbe no formal engagement. I think I am entitled to ask _that_ of you.\"\n\nShe was so clearly within her rights, and so much more indulgent than\nHorace had expected--for he had always considered her an unsentimental\nand rather worldly woman--that he accepted her conditions almost\ngratefully. After all, it was enough for him that Sylvia returned his\nlove, and that he should be allowed to see her from time to time.\n\n\"It's rather a pity,\" said Sylvia, meditatively, a little later, when\nher mother had gone back to her letter-writing, and she and Horace were\ndiscussing the future; \"it's rather a pity that you didn't manage to get\n_something_ at that sale. It might have helped you with papa.\"\n\n\"Well, I did get something on my own account,\" he said, \"though I don't\nknow whether it is likely to do me any good with your father.\" And he\ntold her how he had come to acquire the brass bottle.\n\n\"And you actually gave a guinea for it?\" said Sylvia, \"when you could\nprobably get exactly the same thing, only better, at Liberty's for about\nseven-and-sixpence! Nothing of that sort has any charms for papa, unless\nit's dirty and dingy and centuries old.\"\n\n\"This looks all that. I only bought it because, though it wasn't down on\nthe catalogue, I had a fancy that it might interest the Professor.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Sylvia, clasping her pretty hands, \"if only it does, Horace!\nIf it turns out to be tremendously rare and valuable! I do believe dad\nwould be so delighted that he'd consent to anything. Ah, that's his step\noutside ... he's letting himself in. Now mind you don't forget to tell\nhim about that bottle.\"\n\nThe Professor did not seem in the sweetest of humours as he entered the\ndrawing-room. \"Sorry I was obliged to be from home, and there was nobody\nbut my wife and daughter here to entertain you. But I am glad you\nstayed--yes, I'm rather glad you stayed.\"\n\n\"So am I, sir,\" said Horace, and proceeded to give his account of the\nsale, which did not serve to improve the Professor's temper. He thrust\nout his under lip at certain items in the catalogue. \"I wish I'd gone\nmyself,\" he said; \"that bowl, a really fine example of sixteenth-century\nPersian work, going for only five guineas! I'd willingly have given ten\nfor it. There, there, I thought I could have depended on you to use your\njudgment better than that!\"\n\n\"If you remember, sir, you strictly limited me to the sums you marked.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" said the Professor, testily; \"my marginal notes\nwere merely intended as indications, no more. You might have known that\nif you had secured one of the things at any price I should have\napproved.\"\n\nHorace had no grounds for knowing anything of the kind, and much reason\nfor believing the contrary, but he saw no use in arguing the matter\nfurther, and merely said he was sorry to have misunderstood.\n\n\"No doubt the fault was mine,\" said the Professor, in a tone that\nimplied the opposite. \"Still, making every allowance for inexperience in\nthese matters, I should have thought it impossible for any one to spend\na whole day bidding at a place like Hammond's without even securing a\nsingle article.\"\n\n\"But, dad,\" put in Sylvia, \"Mr. Ventimore did get _one_ thing--on his\nown account. It's a brass bottle, not down in the catalogue, but he\nthinks it may be worth something perhaps. And he'd very much like to\nhave your opinion.\"\n\n\"Tchah!\" said the Professor. \"Some modern bazaar work, most probably.\nHe'd better have kept his money. What was this bottle of yours like,\nnow, eh?\"\n\nHorace described it.\n\n\"H'm. Seems to be what the Arabs call a 'kum-kum,' probably used as a\nsprinkler, or to hold rose-water. Hundreds of 'em about,\" commented the\nProfessor, crustily.\n\n\"It had a lid, riveted or soldered on,\" said Horace; \"the general shape\nwas something like this ...\" And he made a rapid sketch from memory,\nwhich the Professor took reluctantly, and then adjusted his glasses with\nsome increase of interest.\n\n\"Ha--the form is antique, certainly. And the top hermetically fastened,\neh? That looks as if it might contain something.\"\n\n\"You don't think it has a genie inside, like the sealed jar the\nfisherman found in the 'Arabian Nights'?\" cried Sylvia. \"What fun if it\nhad!\"\n\n\"By genie, I presume you mean a _Jinnee_, which is the more correct and\nscholarly term,\" said the Professor. \"Female, _Jinneeyeh_, and plural\n_Jinn_. No, I do _not_ contemplate that as a probable contingency. But\nit is not quite impossible that a vessel closed as Mr. Ventimore\ndescribes may have been designed as a receptacle for papyri or other\nrecords of archæological interest, which may be still in preservation. I\nshould recommend you, sir, to use the greatest precaution in removing\nthe lid--don't expose the documents, if any, too suddenly to the outer\nair, and it would be better if you did not handle them yourself. I shall\nbe rather curious to hear whether it really does contain anything, and\nif so, what.\"\n\n\"I will open it as carefully as possible,\" said Horace, \"and whatever it\nmay contain, you may rely upon my letting you know at once.\"\n\nHe left shortly afterwards, encouraged by the radiant trust in Sylvia's\neyes, and thrilled by the secret pressure of her hand at parting.\n\nHe had been amply repaid for all the hours he had spent in the close\nsale-room. His luck had turned at last: he was going to succeed; he felt\nit in the air, as if he were already fanned by Fortune's pinions.\n\nStill thinking of Sylvia, he let himself into the semi-detached,\nold-fashioned house on the north side of Vincent Square, where he had\nlodged for some years. It was nearly twelve o'clock, and his landlady,\nMrs. Rapkin, and her husband had already gone to bed.\n\nVentimore went up to his sitting-room, a comfortable apartment with two\nlong windows opening on to a trellised verandah and balcony--a room\nwhich, as he had furnished and decorated it himself to suit his own\ntastes, had none of the depressing ugliness of typical lodgings.\n\nIt was quite dark, for the season was too mild for a fire, and he had to\ngrope for the matches before he could light his lamp. After he had done\nso and turned up the wicks, the first object he saw was the bulbous,\nlong-necked jar which he had bought that afternoon, and which now stood\non the stained boards near the mantelpiece. It had been delivered with\nunusual promptitude!\n\nSomehow he felt a sort of repulsion at the sight of it. \"It's a\nbeastlier-looking object than I thought,\" he said to himself\ndisgustedly. \"A chimney-pot would be about as decorative and appropriate\nin my room. What a thundering ass I was to waste a guinea on it! I\nwonder if there really is anything inside it. It is so infernally ugly\nthat it _ought_ to be useful. The Professor seemed to fancy it might\nhold documents, and he ought to know. Anyway, I'll find out before I\nturn in.\"\n\nHe grasped it by its long, thick neck, and tried to twist the cap off;\nbut it remained firm, which was not surprising, seeing that it was\nthickly coated with a lava-like crust.\n\n\"I must get some of that off first, and then try again,\" he decided; and\nafter foraging downstairs, he returned with a hammer and chisel, with\nwhich he chipped away the crust till the line of the cap was revealed,\nand an uncouth metal knob that seemed to be a catch.\n\nThis he tapped sharply for some time, and again attempted to wrench off\nthe lid. Then he gripped the vessel between his knees and put forth all\nhis strength, while the bottle seemed to rock and heave under him in\nsympathy. The cap was beginning to give way, very slightly; one last\nwrench--and it came off in his hand with such suddenness that he was\nflung violently backwards, and hit the back of his head smartly against\nan angle of the wainscot.\n\nHe had a vague impression of the bottle lying on its side, with dense\nvolumes of hissing, black smoke pouring out of its mouth and towering up\nin a gigantic column to the ceiling; he was conscious, too, of a pungent\nand peculiarly overpowering perfume. \"I've got hold of some sort of\ninfernal machine,\" he thought, \"and I shall be all over the square in\nless than a second!\" And, just as he arrived at this cheerful\nconclusion, he lost consciousness altogether.\n\nHe could not have been unconscious for more than a few seconds, for when\nhe opened his eyes the room was still thick with smoke, through which he\ndimly discerned the figure of a stranger, who seemed of abnormal and\nalmost colossal height. But this must have been an optical illusion\ncaused by the magnifying effects of the smoke; for, as it cleared, his\nvisitor proved to be of no more than ordinary stature. He was elderly,\nand, indeed, venerable of appearance, and wore an Eastern robe and\nhead-dress of a dark-green hue. He stood there with uplifted hands,\nuttering something in a loud tone and a language unknown to Horace.\n\nVentimore, being still somewhat dazed, felt no surprise at seeing him.\nMrs. Rapkin must have let her second floor at last--to some Oriental. He\nwould have preferred an Englishman as a fellow-lodger, but this\nforeigner must have noticed the smoke and rushed in to offer assistance,\nwhich was both neighbourly and plucky of him.\n\n\"Awfully good of you to come in, sir,\" he said, as he scrambled to his\nfeet. \"I don't know what's happened exactly, but there's no harm done.\nI'm only a trifle shaken, that's all. By the way, I suppose you can\nspeak English?\"\n\n\"Assuredly I can speak so as to be understood by all whom I address,\"\nanswered the stranger.\n\n\"Dost thou not understand my speech?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, now,\" said Horace. \"But you made a remark just now which I\ndidn't follow--would you mind repeating it?\"\n\n\"I said: 'Repentance, O Prophet of God! I will not return to the like\nconduct ever.'\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Horace. \"I dare say you _were_ rather startled. So was I when\nI opened that bottle.\"\n\n\"Tell me--was it indeed thy hand that removed the seal, O young man of\nkindness and good works?\"\n\n\"I certainly did open it,\" said Ventimore, \"though I don't know where\nthe kindness comes in--for I've no notion what was inside the thing.\"\n\n\"I was inside it,\" said the stranger, calmly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. AT LARGE\n\n\n\"So _you_ were inside that bottle, were you?\" said Horace, blandly. \"How\nsingular!\" He began to realise that he had to deal with an Oriental\nlunatic, and must humour him to some extent. Fortunately he did not seem\nat all dangerous, though undeniably eccentric-looking. His hair fell in\ndisorderly profusion from under his high turban about his cheeks, which\nwere of a uniform pale rhubarb tint; his grey beard streamed out in\nthree thin strands, and his long, narrow eyes, opal in hue, and set\nrather wide apart and at a slight angle, had a curious expression, part\nslyness and part childlike simplicity.\n\n\"Dost thou doubt that I speak truth? I tell thee that I have been\nconfined in that accursed vessel for countless centuries--how long, I\nknow not, for it is beyond calculation.\"\n\n\"I should hardly have thought from your appearance, sir, that you had\nbeen so many years in bottle as all that,\" said Horace, politely, \"but\nit's certainly time you had a change. May I, if it isn't indiscreet, ask\nhow you came into such a very uncomfortable position? But probably you\nhave forgotten by this time.\"\n\n\"Forgotten!\" said the other, with a sombre red glow in his opal eyes.\n\"Wisely was it written: 'Let him that desireth oblivion confer\nbenefits--but the memory of an injury endureth for ever.' _I_ forget\nneither benefits nor injuries.\"\n\n\"An old gentleman with a grievance,\" thought Ventimore. \"And mad into\nthe bargain. Nice person to have staying in the same house with one!\"\n\n\"Know, O best of mankind,\" continued the stranger, \"that he who now\naddresses thee is Fakrash-el-Aamash, one of the Green Jinn. And I dwelt\nin the Palace of the Mountain of the Clouds above the City of Babel in\nthe Garden of Irem, which thou doubtless knowest by repute?\"\n\n\"I fancy I _have_ heard of it,\" said Horace, as if it were an address in\nthe Court Directory. \"Delightful neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"I had a kinswoman, Bedeea-el-Jemal, who possessed incomparable beauty\nand manifold accomplishments. And seeing that, though a Jinneeyeh, she\nwas of the believing Jinn, I despatched messengers to Suleyman the\nGreat, the son of Daood, offering him her hand in marriage. But a\ncertain Jarjarees, the son of Rejmoos, the son of Iblees--may he be for\never accursed!--looked with favour upon the maiden, and, going secretly\nunto Suleyman, persuaded him that I was preparing a crafty snare for the\nKing's undoing.\"\n\n\"And, of course, _you_ never thought of such a thing?\" said Ventimore.\n\n\"By a venomous tongue the fairest motives may be rendered foul,\" was the\nsomewhat evasive reply. \"Thus it came to pass that Suleyman--on whom be\npeace!--listened unto the voice of Jarjarees and refused to receive the\nmaiden. Moreover, he commanded that I should be seized and imprisoned in\na bottle of brass and cast into the Sea of El-Karkar, there to abide the\nDay of Doom.\"\n\n\"Too bad--really too bad!\" murmured Horace, in a tone that he could only\nhope was sufficiently sympathetic.\n\n\"But now, by thy means, O thou of noble ancestors and gentle\ndisposition, my deliverance hath been accomplished; and if I were to\nserve thee for a thousand years, regarding nothing else, even thus could\nI not requite thee, and my so doing would be a small thing according to\nthy desserts!\"\n\n\"Pray don't mention it,\" said Horace; \"only too pleased if I've been of\nany use to you.\"\n\n\"In the sky it is written upon the pages of the air: 'He who doth kind\nactions shall experience the like.' Am I not an Efreet of the Jinn?\nDemand, therefore, and thou shalt receive.\"\n\n\"Poor old chap!\" thought Horace, \"he's very cracked indeed. He'll be\nwanting to give me a present of some sort soon--and of course I can't\nhave that.... My dear Mr. Fakrash,\" he said aloud, \"I've done\nnothing--nothing at all--and if I had, I couldn't possibly accept any\nreward for it.\"\n\n\"What are thy names, and what calling dost thou follow?\"\n\n\"I ought to have introduced myself before--let me give you my card;\" and\nVentimore gave him one, which the other took and placed in his girdle.\n\"That's my business address. I'm an architect, if you know what that\nis--a man who builds houses and churches--mosques, you know--in fact,\nanything, when he can get it to build.\"\n\n\"A useful calling indeed--and one to be rewarded with fine gold.\"\n\n\"In my case,\" Horace confessed, \"the reward has been too fine to be\nperceived. In other words, I've never _been_ rewarded, because I've\nnever yet had the luck to get a client.\"\n\n\"And what is this client of whom thou speakest?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, some well-to-do merchant who wants a house built for him and\ndoesn't care how much he spends on it. There must be lots of them\nabout--but they never seem to come in _my_ direction.\"\n\n\"Grant me a period of delay, and, if it be possible, I will procure thee\nsuch a client.\"\n\nHorace could not help thinking that any recommendation from such a\nquarter would hardly carry much weight; but, as the poor old man\nevidently imagined himself under an obligation, which he was anxious to\ndischarge, it would have been unkind to throw cold water on his good\nintentions.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" he said lightly, \"if you _should_ come across that\nparticular type of client, and can contrive to impress him with the\nbelief that I'm just the architect he's looking out for--which, between\nourselves, I am, though nobody's discovered it yet--if you can get him\nto come to me, you will do me the very greatest service I could ever\nhope for. But don't give yourself any trouble over it.\"\n\n\"It will be one of the easiest things that can be,\" said his visitor,\n\"that is\" (and here a shade of rather pathetic doubt crossed his face)\n\"provided that anything of my former power yet remains unto me.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind, sir,\" said Horace; \"if you can't, I shall take the\nwill for the deed.\"\n\n\"First of all, it will be prudent to learn where Suleyman is, that I may\nhumble myself before him and make my peace.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Horace, gently, \"I would. I should make a point of that,\nsir. Not _now_, you know. He might be in bed. To-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"This is a strange place that I am in, and I know not yet in what\ndirection I should seek him. But till I have found him, and justified\nmyself in his sight, and had my revenge upon Jarjarees, mine enemy, I\nshall know no rest.\"\n\n\"Well, but go to bed now, like a sensible old chap,\" said Horace,\nsoothingly, anxious to prevent this poor demented Asiatic from falling\ninto the hands of the police. \"Plenty of time to go and call on Suleyman\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"I will search for him, even unto the uttermost ends of the earth!\"\n\n\"That's right--you're sure to find him in one of them. Only, don't you\nsee, it's no use starting to-night--the last trains have gone long ago.\"\nAs he spoke, the night wind bore across the square the sound of Big Ben\nstriking the quarters in Westminster Clock Tower, and then, after a\npause, the solemn boom that announced the first of the small hours.\n\"To-morrow,\" thought Ventimore, \"I'll speak to Mrs. Rapkin, and get her\nto send for a doctor and have him put under proper care--the poor old\nboy really isn't fit to go about alone!\"\n\n\"I will start now--at once,\" insisted the stranger \"for there is no time\nto be lost.\"\n\n\"Oh, come!\" said Horace, \"after so many thousand years, a few hours more\nor less won't make any serious difference. And you _can't_ go out\nnow--they've shut up the house. Do let me take you upstairs to your\nroom, sir.\"\n\n\"Not so, for I must leave thee for a season, O young man of kind\nconduct. But may thy days be fortunate, and the gate never cease to be\nrepaired, and the nose of him that envieth thee be rubbed in the dust,\nfor love for thee hath entered into my heart, and if it be permitted\nunto me, I will cover thee with the veils of my protection!\"\n\nAs he finished this harangue the speaker seemed, to Ventimore's\nspeechless amazement, to slip through the wall behind him. At all\nevents, he had left the room somehow--and Horace found himself alone.\n\nHe rubbed the back of his head, which began to be painful. \"He can't\nreally have vanished through the wall,\" he said to himself. \"That's too\nabsurd. The fact is, I'm over-excited this evening--and no wonder, after\nall that's happened. The best thing I can do is to go to bed at once.\"\n\nWhich he accordingly proceeded to do.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. CARTE BLANCHE\n\n\nWhen Ventimore woke next morning his headache had gone, and with it the\nrecollection of everything but the wondrous and delightful fact that\nSylvia loved him and had promised to be his some day. Her mother, too,\nwas on his side; why should he despair of anything after that? There was\nthe Professor, to be sure--but even he might be brought to consent to an\nengagement, especially if it turned out that the brass bottle ... and\nhere Horace began to recall an extraordinary dream in connection with\nthat extremely speculative purchase of his. He had dreamed that he had\nforced the bottle open, and that it proved to contain, not manuscripts,\nbut an elderly Jinnee who alleged that he had been imprisoned there by\nthe order of King Solomon!\n\nWhat, he wondered, could have put so grotesque a fancy into his head?\nand then he smiled as he traced it to Sylvia's playful suggestion that\nthe bottle might contain a \"genie,\" as did the famous jar in the\n\"Arabian Nights,\" and to her father's pedantic correction of the word to\n\"Jinnee.\" Upon that slight foundation his sleeping brain had built up\nall that elaborate fabric--a scene so vivid and a story so\ncircumstantial and plausible that, in spite of its extravagance, he\ncould hardly even now persuade himself that it was entirely imaginary.\nThe psychology of dreams is a subject which has a fascinating mystery,\neven for the least serious student.\n\nAs he entered the sitting-room, where his breakfast awaited him, he\nlooked round, half expecting to find the bottle lying with its lid off\nin the corner, as he had last seen it in his dream.\n\nOf course, it was not there, and he felt an odd relief. The\nauction-room people had not delivered it yet, and so much the better,\nfor he had still to ascertain if it had anything inside it; and who knew\nthat it might not contain something more to his advantage than a\nmaundering old Jinnee with a grievance several thousands of years old?\n\nBreakfast over, he rang for his landlady, who presently appeared. Mrs.\nRapkin was a superior type of her much-abused class. She was\nscrupulously clean and neat in her person; her sandy hair was so smooth\nand tightly knotted that it gave her head the colour and shape of a\nBarcelona nut; she had sharp, beady eyes, nostrils that seemed to smell\nbattle afar off, a wide, thin mouth that apparently closed with a snap,\nand a dry, whity-brown complexion suggestive of bran.\n\nBut if somewhat grim of aspect, she was a good soul and devoted to\nHorace, in whom she took almost a maternal interest, while regretting\nthat he was not what she called \"serious-minded enough\" to get on in the\nworld. Rapkin had wooed and married her when they were both in service,\nand he still took occasional jobs as an outdoor butler, though Horace\nsuspected that his more staple form of industry was the consumption of\ngin-and-water and remarkably full-flavoured cigars in the basement\nparlour.\n\n\"Shall you be dining in this evening, sir?\" inquired Mrs. Rapkin.\n\n\"I don't know. Don't get anything in for me; I shall most probably dine\nat the club,\" said Horace; and Mrs. Rapkin, who had a confirmed belief\nthat all clubs were hotbeds of vice and extravagance, sniffed\ndisapproval. \"By the way,\" he added, \"if a kind of brass pot is sent\nhere, it's all right. I bought it at a sale yesterday. Be careful how\nyou handle it--it's rather old.\"\n\n\"There _was_ a vawse come late last night, sir; I don't know if it's\nthat, it's old-fashioned enough.\"\n\n\"Then will you bring it up at once, please? I want to see it.\"\n\nMrs. Rapkin retired, to reappear presently with the brass bottle. \"I\nthought you'd have noticed it when you come in last night, sir,\" she\nexplained, \"for I stood it in the corner, and when I see it this morning\nit was layin' o' one side and looking that dirty and disrespectable I\ntook it down to give it a good clean, which it wanted it.\"\n\nIt certainly looked rather the better for it, and the marks or scratches\non the cap were more distinguishable, but Horace was somewhat\ndisconcerted to find that part of his dream was true--the bottle had\nbeen there.\n\n\"I hope I've done nothing wrong,\" said Mrs. Rapkin, observing his\nexpression; \"I only used a little warm ale to it, which is a capital\nthing for brass-work, and gave it a scrub with 'Vitrolia' soap--but it\nwould take more than that to get all the muck off of it.\"\n\n\"It is all right, so long as you didn't try to get the top off,\" said\nHorace.\n\n\"Why, the top _was_ off it, sir. I thought you'd done it with the 'ammer\nand chisel when you got 'ome,\" said his landlady, staring. \"I found them\n'ere on the carpet.\"\n\nHorace started. Then _that_ part was true, too! \"Oh, ah,\" he said, \"I\nbelieve I did. I'd forgotten. That reminds me. Haven't you let the room\nabove to--to an Oriental gentleman--a native, you know--wears a green\nturban?\"\n\n\"That I most certainly 'ave _not_, Mr. Ventimore,\" said Mrs. Rapkin,\nwith emphasis, \"nor wouldn't. Not if his turbin was all the colours of\nthe rainbow--for I don't 'old with such. Why, there was Rapkin's own\nsister-in-law let her parlour floor to a Horiental--a Parsee _he_ was,\nor _one_ o' them Hafrican tribes--and reason she 'ad to repent of it,\nfor all his gold spectacles! Whatever made you fancy I should let to a\nblackamoor?\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought I saw somebody about--er--answering that description,\nand I wondered if----\"\n\n\"Never in _this_ 'ouse, sir. Mrs. Steggars, next door but one, might let\nto such, for all I can say to the contrary, not being what you might\ncall particular, and her rooms more suitable to savage notions--but I've\nenough on _my_ hands, Mr. Ventimore, attending to you--not keeping a\ngirl to do the waiting, as why should I while I'm well able to do it\nbetter myself?\"\n\nAs soon as she relieved him of her presence, he examined the bottle:\nthere was nothing whatever inside it, which disposed of all the hopes he\nhad entertained from that quarter.\n\nIt was not difficult to account for the visionary Oriental as an\nhallucination probably inspired by the heavy fumes (for he now believed\nin the fumes) which had doubtless resulted from the rapid decomposition\nof some long-buried spices or similar substances suddenly exposed to the\nair.\n\nIf any further explanation were needed, the accidental blow to the back\nof his head, together with the latent suggestion from the \"Arabian\nNights,\" would amply provide it.\n\nSo, having settled these points to his entire satisfaction, he went to\nhis office in Great Cloister Street, which he now had entirely to\nhimself, and was soon engaged in drafting the specification for Beevor\non which he had been working when so fortunately interrupted the day\nbefore by the Professor.\n\nThe work was more or less mechanical, and could bring him no credit and\nlittle thanks, but Horace had the happy faculty of doing thoroughly\nwhatever he undertook, and as he sat there by his wide-open window he\nsoon became entirely oblivious of all but the task before him.\n\nSo much so that, even when the light became obscured for a moment, as if\nby some large and opaque body in passing, he did not look up\nimmediately, and, when he did, was surprised to find the only armchair\noccupied by a portly person, who seemed to be trying to recover his\nbreath.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Ventimore; \"I never heard you come in.\"\n\nHis visitor could only wave his head in courteous deprecation, under\nwhich there seemed a suspicion of bewildered embarrassment. He was a\nrosy-gilled, spotlessly clean, elderly gentleman, with white whiskers;\nhis eyes, just then slightly protuberant, were shrewd, but genial; he\nhad a wide, jolly mouth and a double chin. He was dressed like a man who\nis above disguising his prosperity; he wore a large, pear-shaped pearl\nin his crimson scarf, and had probably only lately discarded his summer\nwhite hat and white waistcoat.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" he began, in a rich, throaty voice, as soon as he could\nspeak; \"my dear sir, you must think this is a most unceremonious way\nof--ah!--dropping in on you--of invading your privacy.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Horace, wondering whether he could possibly intend\nhim to understand that he had come in by the window. \"I'm afraid there\nwas no one to show you in--my clerk is away just now.\"\n\n\"No matter, sir, no matter. I found my way up, as you perceive. The\nimportant, I may say the essential, fact is that I _am_ here.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Horace, \"and may I ask what brought you?\"\n\n\"What brought----\" The stranger's eyes grew fish-like for the moment.\n\"Allow me, I--I shall come to that--in good time. I am still a\nlittle--as you can see.\" He glanced round the room. \"You are, I think,\nan architect, Mr. ah--Mr. um----?\"\n\n\"Ventimore is my name,\" said Horace, \"and I _am_ an architect.\"\n\n\"Ventimore, to be sure!\" he put his hand in his pocket and produced a\ncard: \"Yes, it's all quite correct: I see I have the name here. And an\narchitect, Mr. Ventimore, so I--I am given to understand, of immense\nability.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't claim to be that,\" said Horace, \"but I may call\nmyself fairly competent.\"\n\n\"Competent? Why, of _course_ you're competent. Do you suppose, sir, that\nI, a practical business man, should come to any one who was _not_\ncompetent?\" he said, with exactly the air of a man trying to convince\nhimself--against his own judgment--that he was acting with the utmost\nprudence.\n\n\"Am I to understand that some one has been good enough to recommend me\nto you?\" inquired Horace.\n\n\"Certainly not, sir, certainly not. _I_ need no recommendation but my\nown judgment. I--ah--have a tolerable acquaintance with all that is\ngoing on in the art world, and I have come to the conclusion,\nMr.--eh--ah--Ventimore, I repeat, the deliberate and unassisted\nconclusion, that you are the one man living who can do what I want.\"\n\n\"Delighted to hear it,\" said Horace, genuinely gratified. \"When did you\nsee any of my designs?\"\n\n\"Never mind, sir. I don't decide without very good grounds. It\ndoesn't take me long to make up my mind, and when my mind is made\nup, I act, sir, I act. And, to come to the point, I have a small\ncommission--unworthy, I am quite aware, of your--ah--distinguished\ntalent--which I should like to put in your hands.\"\n\n\"Is _he_ going to ask me to attend a sale for him?\" thought Horace. \"I'm\nhanged if I do.\"\n\n\"I'm rather busy at present,\" he said dubiously, \"as you may see. I'm\nnot sure whether----\"\n\n\"I'll put the matter in a nutshell, sir--in a nutshell. My name is\nWackerbath, Samuel Wackerbath--tolerably well known, if I may say so, in\nCity circles.\" Horace, of course, concealed the fact that his visitor's\nname and fame were unfamiliar to him. \"I've lately bought a few acres on\nthe Hampshire border, near the house I'm living in just now; and I've\nbeen thinking--as I was saying to a friend only just now, as we were\ncrossing Westminster Bridge--I've been thinking of building myself a\nlittle place there, just a humble, unpretentious home, where I could run\ndown for the weekend and entertain a friend or two in a quiet way, and\nperhaps live some part of the year. Hitherto I've rented places as I\nwanted 'em--old family seats and ancestral mansions and so forth: very\nnice in their way, but I want to feel under a roof of my own. I want to\nsurround myself with the simple comforts, the--ah--unassuming elegance\nof an English country home. And you're the man--I feel more convinced of\nit with every word you say--you're the man to do the job in\nstyle--ah--to execute the work as it should be done.\"\n\nHere was the long-wished-for client at last! And it was satisfactory to\nfeel that he had arrived in the most ordinary and commonplace course,\nfor no one could look at Mr. Samuel Wackerbath and believe for a moment\nthat he was capable of floating through an upper window; he was not in\nthe least that kind of person.\n\n\"I shall be happy to do my best,\" said Horace, with a calmness that\nsurprised himself. \"Could you give me some idea of the amount you are\nprepared to spend?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm no Croesus--though I won't say I'm a pauper precisely--and,\nas I remarked before, I prefer comfort to splendour. I don't think I\nshould be justified in going beyond--well, say sixty thousand.\"\n\n\"Sixty thousand!\" exclaimed Horace, who had expected about a tenth of\nthat sum. \"Oh, not _more_ than sixty thousand? I see.\"\n\n\"I mean, on the house itself,\" explained Mr. Wackerbath; \"there will be\noutbuildings, lodges, cottages, and so forth, and then some of the rooms\nI should want specially decorated. Altogether, before we are finished,\nit may work out at about a hundred thousand. I take it that, with such a\nmargin, you could--ah--run me up something that in a modest way would\ntake the shine out of--I mean to say eclipse--anything in the adjoining\ncounties?\"\n\n\"I certainly think,\" said Horace, \"that for such a sum as that I can\nundertake that you shall have a home which will satisfy you.\" And he\nproceeded to put the usual questions as to site, soil, available\nbuilding materials, the accommodation that would be required, and so on.\n\n\"You're young, sir,\" said Mr. Wackerbath, at the end of the interview,\n\"but I perceive you are up to all the tricks of the--I _should_ say,\nversed in the _minutiæ_ of your profession. You would like to run down\nand look at the ground, eh? Well, that's only reasonable; and my wife\nand daughters will want to have _their_ say in the matter--no getting on\nwithout pleasing the ladies, hey? Now, let me see. To-morrow's Sunday.\nWhy not come down by the 8.45 a.m. to Lipsfield? I'll have a trap, or a\nbrougham and pair, or something, waiting for you--take you over the\nground myself, bring you back to lunch with us at Oriel Court, and talk\nthe whole thing thoroughly over. Then we'll send you up to town in the\nevening, and you can start work the first thing on Monday. That suit\nyou? Very well, then. We'll expect you to-morrow.\"\n\nWith this Mr. Wackerbath departed, leaving Horace, as may be imagined,\nabsolutely overwhelmed by the suddenness and completeness of his good\nfortune. He was no longer one of the unemployed: he had work to do, and,\nbetter still, work that would interest him, give him all the scope and\nopportunity he could wish for. With a client who seemed tractable, and\nto whom money was clearly no object, he might carry out some of his most\nambitious ideas.\n\nMoreover, he would now be in a position to speak to Sylvia's father\nwithout fear of a repulse. His commission on £60,000 would be £3,000,\nand that on the decorations and other work at least as much\nagain--probably more. In a year he could marry without imprudence; in\ntwo or three years he might be making a handsome income, for he felt\nconfident that, with such a start, he would soon have as much work as he\ncould undertake.\n\nHe was ashamed of himself for ever having lost heart. What were the last\nfew years of weary waiting but probation and preparation for this\nsplendid chance, which had come just when he really needed it, and in\nthe most simple and natural manner?\n\nHe loyally completed the work he had promised to do for Beevor, who\nwould have to dispense with his assistance in future, and then he felt\ntoo excited and restless to stay in the office, and, after lunching at\nhis club as usual, he promised himself the pleasure of going to\nCottesmore Gardens and telling Sylvia his good news.\n\nIt was still early, and he walked the whole way, as some vent for his\nhigh spirits, enjoying everything with a new zest--the dappled grey and\nsalmon sky before him, the amber, russet, and yellow of the scanty\nfoliage in Kensington Gardens, the pungent scent of fallen chestnuts and\nacorns and burning leaves, the blue-grey mist stealing between the\ndistant tree-trunks, and then the cheery bustle and brilliancy of the\nHigh Street. Finally came the joy of finding Sylvia all alone, and\nwitnessing her frank delight at what he had come to tell her, of feeling\nher hands on his shoulders, and holding her in his arms, as their lips\nmet for the first time. If on that Saturday afternoon there was a\nhappier man than Horace Ventimore, he would have done well to dissemble\nhis felicity, for fear of incurring the jealousy of the high gods.\n\nWhen Mrs. Futvoye returned, as she did only too soon, to find her\ndaughter and Horace seated on the same sofa, she did not pretend to be\ngratified. \"This is taking a most unfair advantage of what I was weak\nenough to say last night, Mr. Ventimore,\" she began. \"I thought I could\nhave trusted you!\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have come so soon,\" he said, \"if my position were what it\nwas only yesterday. But it's changed since then, and I venture to hope\nthat even the Professor won't object now to our being regularly\nengaged.\" And he told her of the sudden alteration in his prospects.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Futvoye, \"you had better speak to my husband about\nit.\"\n\nThe Professor came in shortly afterwards, and Horace immediately\nrequested a few minutes' conversation with him in the study, which was\nreadily granted.\n\nThe study to which the Professor led the way was built out at the back\nof the house, and crowded with Oriental curios of every age and kind;\nthe furniture had been made by Cairene cabinet-makers, and along the\ncornices of the book-cases were texts from the Koran, while every chair\nbore the Arabic for \"Welcome\" in a gilded firework on its leather back;\nthe lamp was a perforated mosque lantern with long pendent glass tubes\nlike hyacinth glasses; a mummy-case smiled from a corner with laboured\n_bonhomie_.\n\n\"Well,\" began the Professor, as soon as they were seated, \"so I was not\nmistaken--there was something in the brass bottle after all, then? Let's\nhave a look at it, whatever it is.\"\n\nFor the moment Horace had almost forgotten the bottle. \"Oh!\" he said,\n\"I--I got it open; but there was nothing in it.\"\n\n\"Just as I anticipated, sir,\" said the Professor. \"I told you there\ncouldn't be anything in a bottle of that description; it was simply\nthrowing money away to buy it.\"\n\n\"I dare say it was, but I wished to speak to you on a much more\nimportant matter;\" and Horace briefly explained his object.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said the Professor, rubbing up his hair irritably, \"dear me!\nI'd no idea of this--no idea at all. I was under the impression that you\nvolunteered to act as escort to my wife and daughter at St. Luc purely\nout of good nature to relieve me from what--to a man of my habits in\nthat extreme heat--would have been an arduous and distasteful duty.\"\n\n\"I was not wholly unselfish, I admit,\" said Horace. \"I fell in love with\nyour daughter, sir, the first day I met her--only I felt I had no right,\nas a poor man with no prospects, to speak to her or you at that time.\"\n\n\"A very creditable feeling--but I've yet to learn why you should have\novercome it.\"\n\nSo, for the third time, Ventimore told the story of the sudden turn in\nhis fortunes.\n\n\"I know this Mr. Samuel Wackerbath by name,\" said the Professor; \"one of\nthe chief partners in the firm of Akers and Coverdale, the great estate\nagents--a most influential man, if you can only succeed in satisfying\nhim.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't feel any misgivings about that, sir,\" said Horace. \"I mean\nto build him a house that will be beyond his wildest expectations, and\nyou see that in a year I shall have earned several thousands, and I need\nnot say that I will make any settlement you think proper when I\nmarry----\"\n\n\"When you are in possession of those thousands,\" remarked the Professor,\ndryly, \"it will be time enough to talk of marrying and making\nsettlements. Meanwhile, if you and Sylvia choose to consider yourselves\nengaged, I won't object--only I must insist on having your promise that\nyou won't persuade her to marry you without her mother's and my\nconsent.\"\n\nVentimore gave this undertaking willingly enough, and they returned to\nthe drawing-room. Mrs. Futvoye could hardly avoid asking Horace, in his\nnew character of _fiancé_, to stay and dine, which it need not be said\nhe was only too delighted to do.\n\n\"There is one thing, my dear--er--Horace,\" said the Professor, solemnly,\nafter dinner, when the neat parlourmaid had left them at dessert, \"one\nthing on which I think it my duty to caution you. If you are to justify\nthe confidence we have shown in sanctioning your engagement to Sylvia,\nyou must curb this propensity of yours to needless extravagance.\"\n\n\"Papa!\" cried Sylvia. \"What _could_ have made you think Horace\nextravagant?\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Horace, \"I shouldn't have called myself particularly so.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever _does_ call himself particularly extravagant,\" retorted the\nProfessor; \"but I observed at St. Luc that you habitually gave fifty\ncentimes as a _pourboire_ when twopence, or even a penny, would have\nbeen handsome. And no one with any regard for the value of money would\nhave given a guinea for a worthless brass vessel on the bare chance that\nit might contain manuscripts, which (as any one could have foreseen) it\ndid not.\"\n\n\"But it's not a bad sort of bottle, sir,\" pleaded Horace. \"If you\nremember, you said yourself the shape was unusual. Why shouldn't it be\nworth all the money, and more?\"\n\n\"To a collector, perhaps,\" said the Professor, with his wonted\namiability, \"which you are not. No, I can only call it a senseless and\nreprehensible waste of money.\"\n\n\"Well, the truth is,\" said Horace, \"I bought it with some idea that it\nmight interest _you_.\"\n\n\"Then you were mistaken, sir. It does _not_ interest me. Why should I be\ninterested in a metal jar which, for anything that appears to the\ncontrary, may have been cast the other day at Birmingham?\"\n\n\"But there _is_ something,\" said Horace; \"a seal or inscription of some\nsort engraved on the cap. Didn't I mention it?\"\n\n\"You said nothing about an inscription before,\" replied the Professor,\nwith rather more interest. \"What is the character--Arabic? Persian?\nKufic?\"\n\n\"I really couldn't say--it's almost rubbed out--queer little triangular\nmarks, something like birds' footprints.\"\n\n\"That sounds like Cuneiform,\" said the Professor, \"which would seem to\npoint to a Phoenician origin. And, as I am acquainted with no Oriental\nbrass earlier than the ninth century of our era, I should regard your\ndescription as, _à priori_, distinctly unlikely. However, I should\ncertainly like to have an opportunity of examining the bottle for myself\nsome day.\"\n\n\"Whenever you please, Professor. When can you come?\"\n\n\"Why, I'm so much occupied all day that I can't say for certain when I\ncan get up to your office again.\"\n\n\"My own days will be fairly full now,\" said Horace; \"and the thing's not\nat the office, but in my rooms at Vincent Square. Why shouldn't you all\ncome and dine quietly there some evening next week, and then you could\nexamine the inscription comfortably afterwards, you know, Professor, and\nfind out what it really is? Do say you will.\" He was eager to have the\nprivilege of entertaining Sylvia in his own rooms for the first time.\n\n\"No, no,\" said the Professor; \"I see no reason why you should be\ntroubled with the entire family. I may drop in alone some evening and\ntake the luck of the pot, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank you, papa,\" put in Sylvia; \"but _I_ should like to come too,\nplease, and hear what you think of Horace's bottle. And I'm dying to see\nhis rooms. I believe they're fearfully luxurious.\"\n\n\"I trust,\" observed her father, \"that they are far indeed from answering\nthat description. If they did, I should consider it a most\nunsatisfactory indication of Horace's character.\"\n\n\"There's nothing magnificent about them, I assure you,\" said Horace.\n\"Though it's true I've had them done up, and all that sort of thing, at\nmy own expense--but quite simply. I couldn't afford to spend much on\nthem. But do come and see them. I must have a little dinner, to\ncelebrate my good fortune--it will be so jolly if you'll all three\ncome.\"\n\n\"If we do come,\" stipulated the Professor, \"it must be on the distinct\nunderstanding that you don't provide an elaborate banquet. Plain,\nsimple, wholesome food, well cooked, such as we have had this evening,\nis all that is necessary. More would be ostentatious.\"\n\n\"My _dear_ dad!\" protested Sylvia, in distress at this somewhat\ndictatorial speech. \"Surely you can leave all that to Horace!\"\n\n\"Horace, my dear, understands that, in speaking as I did, I was simply\ntreating him as a potential member of my family.\" Here Sylvia made a\nprivate little grimace. \"No young man who contemplates marrying should\nallow himself to launch into extravagance on the strength of prospects\nwhich, for all he can tell,\" said the Professor, genially, \"may prove\nfallacious. On the contrary, if his affection is sincere, he will incur\nas little expense as possible, put by every penny he can save, rather\nthan subject the girl he professes to love to the ordeal of a long\nengagement. In other words, the truest lover is the best economist.\"\n\n\"I quite understand, sir,\" said Horace, good-temperedly; \"it would be\nfoolish of me to attempt any ambitious form of entertainment--especially\nas my landlady, though an excellent plain cook, is not exactly a _cordon\nbleu_. So you can come to my modest board without misgivings.\"\n\nBefore he left, a provisional date for the dinner was fixed for an\nevening towards the end of the next week, and Horace walked home,\ntreading on air rather than hard paving-stones, and \"striking the stars\nwith his uplifted head.\"\n\nThe next day he went down to Lipsfield and made the acquaintance of the\nwhole Wackerbath family, who were all enthusiastic about the proposed\ncountry house. The site was everything that the most exacting architect\ncould desire, and he came back to town the same evening, having spent a\npleasant day and learnt enough of his client's requirements, and--what\nwas even more important--those of his client's wife and daughters, to\nenable him to begin work upon the sketch-plans the next morning.\n\nHe had not been long in his rooms at Vincent Square, and was still\nagreeably engaged in recalling the docility and ready appreciation with\nwhich the Wackerbaths had received his suggestions and rough sketches,\ntheir compliments and absolute confidence in his skill, when he had a\nshock which was as disagreeable as it was certainly unexpected.\n\nFor the wall before him parted like a film, and through it stepped,\nsmiling benignantly, the green-robed figure of Fakrash-el-Aamash, the\nJinnee.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. EMBARRAS DE RICHESSES\n\n\nVentimore had so thoroughly convinced himself that the released Jinnee\nwas purely a creature of his own imagination, that he rubbed his eyes\nwith a start, hoping that they had deceived him.\n\n\"Stroke thy head, O merciful and meritorious one,\" said his visitor,\n\"and recover thy faculties to receive good tidings. For it is indeed\nI--Fakrash-el-Aamash--whom thou beholdest.\"\n\n\"I--I'm delighted to see you,\" said Horace, as cordially as he could.\n\"Is there anything I can do for you?\"\n\n\"Nay, for hast thou not done me the greatest of all services by setting\nme free? To escape out of a bottle is pleasant. And to thee I owe my\ndeliverance.\"\n\nIt was all true, then: he had really let an imprisoned Genius or Jinnee,\nor whatever it was, out of that bottle! He knew he could not be dreaming\nnow--he only wished he were. However, since it was done, his best course\nseemed to be to put a good face on it, and persuade this uncanny being\nsomehow to go away and leave him in peace for the future.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, my dear sir,\" he said, \"don't think any more\nabout it. I--I rather understood you to say that you were starting on a\njourney in search of Solomon?\"\n\n\"I have been, and returned. For I visited sundry cities in his\ndominions, hoping that by chance I might hear news of him, but I\nrefrained from asking directly lest thereby I should engender suspicion,\nand so Suleyman should learn of my escape before I could obtain an\naudience of him and implore justice.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shouldn't think that was likely,\" said Horace. \"If I were you, I\nshould go straight back and go on travelling till I _did_ find\nSuleyman.\"\n\n\"Well was it said: 'Pass not any door without knocking, lest haply that\nwhich thou seekest should be behind it.'\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Horace. \"Do each city thoroughly, house by house, and\ndon't neglect the smallest clue. 'If at first you don't succeed, try,\ntry, try, again!' as one of our own poets teaches.\"\n\n\"'Try, try, try again,'\" echoed the Jinnee, with an admiration that was\nalmost fatuous. \"Divinely gifted truly was he who composed such a\nverse!\"\n\n\"He has a great reputation as a sage,\" said Horace, \"and the maxim is\nconsidered one of his happiest efforts. Don't you think that, as the\nEast is rather thickly populated, the less time you lose in following\nthe poet's recommendation the better?\"\n\n\"It may be as thou sayest. But know this, O my son, that wheresoever I\nmay wander, I shall never cease to study how I may most fitly reward\nthee for thy kindness towards me. For nobly it was said: 'If I be\npossessed of wealth and be not liberal, may my head never be extended!'\"\n\n\"My good sir,\" said Horace, \"do please understand that if you were to\noffer me any reward for--for a very ordinary act of courtesy, I should\nbe obliged to decline it.\"\n\n\"But didst thou not say that thou wast sorely in need of a client?\"\n\n\"That was so at the time,\" said Horace; \"but since I last had the\npleasure of seeing you, I have met with one who is all I could possibly\nwish for.\"\n\n\"I am indeed rejoiced to hear it,\" returned the Jinnee, \"for thou\nshowest me that I have succeeded in performing the first service which\nthou hast demanded of me.\"\n\nHorace staggered under this severe blow to his pride; for the moment he\ncould only gasp: \"You--_you_ sent him to me?\"\n\n\"I, and no other,\" said the Jinnee, beaming with satisfaction; \"for\nwhile, unseen of men, I was circling in air, resolved to attend to thy\naffair before beginning my search for Suleyman (on whom be peace!), it\nchanced that I overheard a human being of prosperous appearance say\naloud upon a bridge that he desired to erect for himself a palace if he\ncould but find an architect. So, perceiving thee afar off seated at an\nopen casement, I immediately transported him to the place and delivered\nhim into thy hands.\"\n\n\"But he knew my name--he had my card in his pocket,\" said Horace.\n\n\"I furnished him with the paper containing thy names and abode, lest he\nshould be ignorant of them.\"\n\n\"Well, look here, Mr. Fakrash,\" said the unfortunate Horace, \"I know you\nmeant well--but _never_ do a thing like that again! If my\nbrother-architects came to know of it I should be accused of most\nunprofessional behaviour. I'd no idea you would take that way of\nintroducing a client to me, or I should have stopped it at once!\"\n\n\"It was an error,\" said Fakrash. \"No matter. I will undo this affair,\nand devise some other and better means of serving thee.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he said, \"for Heaven's sake, leave things alone--you'll only\nmake them worse. Forgive me, my dear Mr. Fakrash, I'm afraid I must seem\nmost ungrateful; but--but I was so taken by surprise. And really, I am\nextremely obliged to you. For, though the means you took were----were a\nlittle irregular, you have done me a very great service.\"\n\n\"It is naught,\" said the Jinnee, \"compared to those I hope to render so\ngreat a benefactor.\"\n\n\"But, indeed, you mustn't think of trying to do any more for me,\" urged\nHorace, who felt the absolute necessity of expelling any scheme of\nfurther benevolence from the Jinnee's head once and for all. \"You have\ndone enough. Why, thanks to you, I am engaged to build a palace that\nwill keep me hard at work and happy for ever so long.\"\n\n\"Are human beings, then, so enamoured of hard labour?\" asked Fakrash, in\nwonder. \"It is not thus with the Jinn.\"\n\n\"I love my work for its own sake,\" said Horace, \"and then, when I have\nfinished it, I shall have earned a very fair amount of money--which is\nparticularly important to me just now.\"\n\n\"And why, my son, art thou so desirous of obtaining riches?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Horace, \"unless a man is tolerably well off in these\ndays he cannot hope to marry.\"\n\nFakrash smiled with indulgent compassion. \"How excellent is the saying\nof one of old: 'He that adventureth upon matrimony is like unto one who\nthrusteth his hand into a sack containing many thousands of serpents and\none eel. Yet, if Fate so decree, he _may_ draw forth the eel.' And thou\nart comely, and of an age when it is natural to desire the love of a\nmaiden. Therefore be of good heart and a cheerful eye, and it may be\nthat, when I am more at leisure, I shall find thee a helpmate who shall\nrejoice thy soul.\"\n\n\"Please don't trouble to find me anything of the sort!\" said Horace,\nhastily, with a mental vision of some helpless and scandalised stranger\nbeing shot into his dwelling like coals. \"I assure you I would much\nrather win a wife for myself in the ordinary way--as, thanks to your\nkindness, I have every hope of doing before long.\"\n\n\"Is there already some damsel for whom thy heart pineth? If so, fear not\nto tell me her names and dwelling place, and I will assuredly obtain her\nfor thee.\"\n\nBut Ventimore had seen enough of the Jinnee's Oriental methods to doubt\nhis tact and discretion where Sylvia was concerned. \"No, no; of course\nnot. I spoke generally,\" he said. \"It's exceedingly kind of you--but I\n_do_ wish I could make you understand that I am overpaid as it is. You\nhave put me in the way to make a name and fortune for myself. If I fail,\nit will be my own fault. And, at all events, I want nothing more from\nyou. If you mean to find Suleyman (on whom be peace!) you must go and\nlive in the East altogether--for he certainly isn't over here; you must\ngive up your whole time to it, keep as quiet as possible, and don't be\ndiscouraged by any reports you may hear. Above all, never trouble your\nhead about me or my affairs again!\"\n\n\"O thou of wisdom and eloquence,\" said Fakrash, \"this is most excellent\nadvice. I will go, then; but may I drink the cup of perdition if I\nbecome unmindful of thy benevolence!\"\n\nAnd, raising his joined hands above his head as he spoke, he sank, feet\nforemost, through the carpet and was gone.\n\n\"Thank Heaven,\" thought Ventimore, \"he's taken the hint at last. I don't\nthink I'm likely to see any more of him. I feel an ungrateful brute for\nsaying so, but I can't help it. I can _not_ stand being under any\nobligation to a Jinnee who's been shut up in a beastly brass bottle ever\nsince the days of Solomon, who probably had very good reasons for\nputting him there.\"\n\nHorace next asked himself whether he was bound in honour to disclose the\nfacts to Mr. Wackerbath, and give him the opportunity of withdrawing\nfrom the agreement if he thought fit.\n\nOn the whole, he saw no necessity for telling him anything; the only\npossible result would be to make his client suspect his sanity; and who\nwould care to employ an insane architect? Then, if he retired from the\nundertaking without any explanations, what could he say to Sylvia? What\nwould Sylvia's father say to _him_? There would certainly be an end to\nhis engagement.\n\nAfter all, he had not been to blame; the Wackerbaths were quite\nsatisfied. He felt perfectly sure that he could justify their selection\nof him; he would wrong nobody by accepting the commission, while he\nwould only offend them, injure himself irretrievably, and lose all hope\nof gaining Sylvia if he made any attempt to undeceive them.\n\nAnd Fakrash was gone, never to return. So, on all these considerations,\nHorace decided that silence was his only possible policy, and, though\nsome moralists may condemn his conduct as disingenuous and wanting in\ntrue moral courage, I venture to doubt whether any reader, however\nindependent, straightforward, and indifferent to notoriety and ridicule,\nwould have behaved otherwise in Ventimore's extremely delicate and\ndifficult position.\n\nSome days passed, every working hour of which was spent by Horace in the\nrapture of creation. To every man with the soul of an artist in him\nthere comes at times--only too seldom in most cases--a revelation of\nlatent power that he had not dared to hope for. And now with Ventimore\nyears of study and theorising which he had often been tempted to think\nwasted began to bear golden fruit. He designed and drew with a rapidity\nand originality, a sense of perfect mastery of the various problems to\nbe dealt with, and a delight in the working out of mass and detail, so\nintoxicating that he almost dreaded lest he should be the victim of some\nself-delusion.\n\nHis evenings were of course spent with the Futvoyes, in discovering\nSylvia in some new and yet more adorable aspect. Altogether, he was very\nmuch in love, very happy, and very busy--three states not invariably\nfound in combination.\n\nAnd, as he had foreseen, he had effectually got rid of Fakrash, who was\nevidently too engrossed in the pursuit of Solomon to think of anything\nelse. And there seemed no reason why he should abandon his search for a\ngeneration or two, for it would probably take all that time to convince\nhim that that mighty monarch was no longer on the throne.\n\n\"It would have been too brutal to tell him myself,\" thought Horace,\n\"when he was so keen on having his case reheard. And it gives him an\nobject, poor old buffer, and keeps him from interfering in my affairs,\nso it's best for both of us.\"\n\nHorace's little dinner-party had been twice postponed, till he had begun\nto have a superstitious fear that it would never come off; but at length\nthe Professor had been induced to give an absolute promise for a certain\nevening.\n\nOn the day before, after breakfast, Horace had summoned his landlady to\na consultation on the _menu_. \"Nothing elaborate, you know, Mrs.\nRapkin,\" said Horace, who, though he would have liked to provide a feast\nof all procurable delicacies for Sylvia's refection, was obliged to\nrespect her father's prejudices. \"Just a simple dinner, thoroughly well\ncooked, and nicely served--as you know so well how to do it.\"\n\n\"I suppose, sir, you would require Rapkin to wait?\"\n\nAs the ex-butler was liable to trances on these occasions during which\nhe could do nothing but smile and bow with speechless politeness as he\ndropped sauce-boats and plates, Horace replied that he thought of having\nsomeone in to avoid troubling Mr. Rapkin; but his wife expressed such\nconfidence in her husband's proving equal to all emergencies, that\nVentimore waived the point, and left it to her to hire extra help if she\nthought fit.\n\n\"Now, what soup can you give us?\" he inquired, as Mrs. Rapkin stood at\nattention and quite unmollified.\n\nAfter protracted mental conflict, she grudgingly suggested gravy\nsoup--which Horace thought too unenterprising, and rejected in favour of\nmock turtle. \"Well then, fish?\" he continued; \"how about fish?\"\n\nMrs. Rapkin dragged the depths of her culinary resources for several\nseconds, and finally brought to the surface what she called \"a nice\nfried sole.\" Horace would not hear of it, and urged her to aspire to\nsalmon; she substituted smelts, which he opposed by a happy inspiration\nof turbot and lobster sauce. The sauce, however, presented insuperable\ndifficulties to her mind, and she offered a compromise in the form of\ncod--which he finally accepted as a fish which the Professor could\nhardly censure for ostentation.\n\nNext came the no less difficult questions of _entrée_ or no _entrée_, of\njoint and bird. \"What's in season just now?\" said Horace; \"let me\nsee\"--and glanced out of the window as he spoke, as though in search of\nsome outside suggestion.... \"Camels, by Jove!\" he suddenly exclaimed.\n\n\"_Camels_, Mr. Ventimore, sir?\" repeated Mrs. Rapkin, in some\nbewilderment; and then, remembering that he was given to untimely\nflippancy, she gave a tolerant little cough.\n\n\"I'll be shot if they _aren't_ camels!\" said Horace. \"What do _you_ make\nof 'em, Mrs. Rapkin?\"\n\nOut of the faint mist which hung over the farther end of the square\nadvanced a procession of tall, dust-coloured animals, with long,\ndelicately poised necks and a mincing gait. Even Mrs. Rapkin could not\nsucceed in making anything of them except camels.\n\n\"What the deuce does a caravan of camels want in Vincent Square?\" said\nHorace, with a sudden qualm for which he could not account.\n\n\"Most likely they belong to the Barnum Show, sir,\" suggested his\nlandlady. \"I did hear they were coming to Olympia again this year.\"\n\n\"Why, of course,\" cried Horace, intensely relieved. \"It's on their way\nfrom the Docks--at least, it isn't _out_ of their way. Or probably the\nmain road's up for repairs. That's it--they'll turn off to the left at\nthe corner. See, they've got Arab drivers with them. Wonderful how the\nfellows manage them.\"\n\n\"It seems to me, sir,\" said Mrs. Rapkin, \"that they're coming _our_\nway--they seem to be stopping outside.\"\n\n\"Don't talk such infernal---- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Rapkin; but why\non earth should Barnum and Bailey's camels come out of their way to call\non _me_? It's ridiculous, you know!\" said Horace, irritably.\n\n\"Ridicklous it _may_ be, sir,\" she retorted, \"but they're all layin'\ndown on the road opposite our door, as you can see--and them niggers is\nmaking signs to you to come out and speak to 'em.\"\n\nIt was true enough. One by one the camels, which were apparently of the\npurest breed, folded themselves up in a row like campstools at a sign\nfrom their attendants, who were now making profound salaams towards the\nwindow where Ventimore was standing.\n\n\"I suppose I'd better go down and see what they want,\" he said, with\nrather a sickly smile. \"They may have lost the way to Olympia.... I only\nhope Fakrash isn't at the bottom of this,\" he thought, as he went\ndownstairs. \"But he'd come himself--at all events, he wouldn't send me a\nmessage on such a lot of camels!\" As he appeared on the doorstep, all\nthe drivers flopped down and rubbed their flat, black noses on the\ncurbstone.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake get up!\" said Horace angrily. \"This isn't\nHammersmith. Turn to the left, into the Vauxhall Bridge Road, and ask a\npoliceman the nearest way to Olympia.\"\n\n\"Be not angry with thy slaves!\" said the head driver, in excellent\nEnglish. \"We are here by command of Fakrash-el-Aamash, our lord, whom we\nare bound to obey. And we have brought thee these as gifts.\"\n\n\"My compliments to your master,\" said Horace, between his teeth, \"and\ntell him that a London architect has no sort of occasion for camels. Say\nthat I am extremely obliged--but am compelled to decline them.\"\n\n\"O highly born one,\" explained the driver, \"the camels are not a\ngift--but the loads which are upon the camels. Suffer us, therefore,\nsince we dare not disobey our lord's commands, to carry these trifling\ntokens of his good will into thy dwelling and depart in peace.\"\n\nHorace had not noticed till then that every camel bore a heavy burden,\nwhich the attendants were now unloading. \"Oh, if you _must_!\" he said,\nnot too graciously; \"only do look sharp about it--there's a crowd\ncollecting already, and I don't want to have a constable here.\"\n\nHe returned to his rooms, where he found Mrs. Rapkin paralysed with\namazement. \"It's--it's all right,\" he said; \"I'd forgotten--it's only a\nfew Oriental things from the place where that brass bottle came from,\nyou know. They've left them here--on approval.\"\n\n\"Seems funny their sending their goods 'ome on camels, sir, doesn't it?\"\nsaid Mrs. Rapkin.\n\n\"Not at all funny!\" said Horace; \"they--they're an enterprising\nfirm--their way of advertising.\"\n\nOne after another, a train of dusky attendants entered, each of whom\ndeposited his load on the floor with a guttural grunt and returned\nbackward, until the sitting-room was blocked with piles of sacks, and\nbales, and chests, whereupon the head driver appeared and intimated that\nthe tale of gifts was complete.\n\n\"I wonder what sort of tip this fellow expects,\" thought Horace; \"a\nsovereign seems shabby--but it's all I can run to. I'll try him with\nthat.\"\n\nBut the overseer repudiated all idea of a gratuity with stately dignity,\nand as Horace saw him to the gate, he found a stolid constable by the\nrailings.\n\n\"This won't _do_, you know,\" said the constable; \"these 'ere camels must\nmove on--or I shall 'ave to interfere.\"\n\n\"It's all right, constable,\" said Horace, pressing into his hand the\nsovereign the head driver had rejected; \"they're going to move on now.\nThey've brought me a few presents from--from a friend of mine in the\nEast.\"\n\nBy this time the attendants had mounted the kneeling camels, which rose\nwith them, and swung off round the square in a long, swaying trot that\nsoon left the crowd far behind, staring blankly after the caravan as\ncamel after camel disappeared into the haze.\n\n\"I shouldn't mind knowin' that friend o' yours, sir,\" said the\nconstable; \"open-hearted sort o' gentleman, I should think?\"\n\n\"Very!\" said Horace, savagely, and returned to his room, which Mrs.\nRapkin had now left.\n\nHis hands shook, though not with joy, as he untied some of the sacks and\nbales and forced open the outlandish-looking chests, the contents of\nwhich almost took away his breath.\n\nFor in the bales were carpets and tissues which he saw at a glance must\nbe of fabulous antiquity and beyond all price; the sacks held golden\newers and vessels of strange workmanship and pantomimic proportions; the\nchests were full of jewels--ropes of creamy-pink pearls as large as\naverage onions, strings of uncut rubies and emeralds, the smallest of\nwhich would have been a tight fit in an ordinary collar-box, and\ndiamonds, roughly facetted and polished, each the size of a coconut, in\nwhose hearts quivered a liquid and prismatic radiance.\n\nOn the most moderate computation, the total value of these gifts could\nhardly be less than several hundred millions; never probably in the\nworld's history had any treasury contained so rich a store.\n\nIt would have been difficult for anybody, on suddenly finding himself\nthe possessor of this immense incalculable wealth, to make any comment\nquite worthy of the situation, but, surely, none could have been more\ninadequate and indeed inappropriate than Horace's--which, heartfelt as\nit was, was couched in the simple monosyllable--\"Damn!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. \"GRATITUDE--A LIVELY SENSE OF FAVOURS TO COME\"\n\n\nMost men on suddenly finding themselves in possession of such enormous\nwealth would have felt some elation. Ventimore, as we have seen, was\nmerely exasperated. And, although this attitude of his may strike the\nreader as incomprehensible or absolutely wrong-headed, he had more\nreason on his side than might appear at a first view.\n\nIt was undoubtedly the fact that, with the money these treasures\nrepresented, he would be in a position to convulse the money markets of\nEurope and America, bring society to his feet, make and unmake\nkingdoms--dominate, in short, the entire world.\n\n\"But, then,\" as Horace told himself with a groan, \"it wouldn't amuse me\nin the least to convulse money markets. Do I want to see the smartest\npeople in London grovelling for anything they think they're likely to\nget out of me? As I should be perfectly well aware that their homage was\nnot paid to any personal merit of mine, I could hardly consider it\nflattering. And why should I make kingdoms? The only thing I understand\nand care about is making houses. Then, am I likely to be a better hand\nat dominating the world than all the others who have tried the\nexperiment? I doubt it.\"\n\nHe called to mind all the millionaires he had ever read or heard of;\nthey didn't seem to get much fun out of their riches. The majority of\nthem were martyrs to dyspepsia. They were often weighed down by the\ncares and responsibilities of their position; the only people who were\nunable to obtain an audience of them at any time were their friends;\nthey lived in a glare of publicity, and every post brought them\nhundreds of begging letters, and a few threats; their children were in\nconstant danger from kidnappers, and they themselves, after knowing no\nrest in life, could not be certain that even their tombs would be\nundisturbed. Whether they were extravagant or thrifty, they were equally\nmaligned, and, whatever the fortune they left behind them, they could be\nabsolutely certain that, in a couple of generations, it would be\nentirely dissipated.\n\n\"And the biggest millionaire living,\" concluded Horace, \"is a pauper\ncompared with me!\"\n\nBut there was another consideration--how was he to realise all this\nwealth? He knew enough about precious stones to be aware that a ruby,\nfor instance, of the true \"pigeon's blood\" colour and the size of a\nmelon, as most of these rubies were, would be worth, even when cut,\nconsiderably over a million; but who would buy it?\n\n\"I think I see myself,\" he reflected grimly, \"calling on some diamond\nmerchant in Hatton Garden with half a dozen assorted jewels in a\nGladstone bag. If he believed they were genuine, he'd probably have a\nfit; but most likely he'd think I'd invented some dodge for\nmanufacturing them, and had been fool enough to overdo the size. Anyhow,\nhe'd want to know how they came into my possession, and what could I\nsay? That they were part of a little present made to me by a Jinnee in\ngrateful acknowledgment of my having relieved him from a brass bottle in\nwhich he'd been shut up for nearly three thousand years? Look at it how\nyou will, it's _not_ convincing. I fancy I can guess what he'd say. And\nwhat an ass I should look! Then suppose the thing got into the papers?\"\n\nGot into the papers? Why, of course it would get into the papers. As if\nit were possible in these days for a young and hitherto unemployed\narchitect suddenly to surround himself with wondrous carpets, and gold\nvessels, and gigantic jewels without attracting the notice of some\nenterprising journalist. He would be interviewed; the story of his\ncuriously acquired riches would go the round of the papers; he would\nfind himself the object of incredulity, suspicion, ridicule. In\nimagination he could already see the headlines on the news-sheets:\n\n\n            BOTTLED BILLIONS\n\n    AMAZING ARABESQUES BY AN ARCHITECT\n\n    HE SAYS THE JAR CONTAINED A JINNEE\n\n            SENSATIONAL STORY\n\n            DIVERTING DETAILS\n\n\nAnd so on, through every phrase of alliterative ingenuity. He ground his\nteeth at the mere thought of it. Then Sylvia would come to hear of it,\nand what would _she_ think? She would naturally be repelled, as any\nnice-minded girl would be, by the idea that her lover was in secret\nalliance with a supernatural being. And her father and mother--would\nthey allow her to marry a man, however rich, whose wealth came from such\na questionable source? No one would believe that he had not made some\nunholy bargain before consenting to set this incarcerated spirit\nfree--he, who had acted in absolute ignorance, who had persistently\ndeclined all reward after realising what he had done!\n\nNo, it was too much. Try as he might to do justice to the Jinnee's\ngratitude and generosity, he could not restrain a bitter resentment at\nthe utter want of consideration shown in overloading him with gifts so\nuseless and so compromising. No Jinnee--however old, however unfamiliar\nwith the world as it is now--had any right to be such a fool!\n\nAnd at this, above the ramparts of sacks and bales, which occupied all\nthe available space in the room, appeared Mrs. Rapkin's face.\n\n\"I was going to ask you, sir, before them parcels came,\" she began,\nwith a dry cough of disapproval, \"what you would like in the way of\nongtray to-morrow night. I thought if I could find a sweetbread at all\nreasonable----\"\n\nTo Horace--surrounded as he was by incalculable riches--sweetbreads\nseemed incongruous just then; the transition of thought was too violent.\n\n\"I can't bother about that now, Mrs. Rapkin,\" he said; \"we'll settle it\nto-morrow. I'm too busy.\"\n\n\"I suppose most of these things will have to go back, sir, if they're\nonly sent on approval like?\"\n\nIf he only knew where and how he could send them back! \"I--I'm not\nsure,\" he said; \"I may have to keep them.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, bargain or none, I wouldn't have 'em as a gift myself, being\nso dirty and fusty; they can't be no use to anybody, not to mention\nthere being no room to move with them blocking up all the place. I'd\nbetter tell Rapkin to carry 'em all upstairs out of people's way.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Horace, sharply, by no means anxious for the\nRapkins to discover the real nature of his treasures. \"Don't touch them,\neither of you. Leave them exactly as they are, do you understand?\"\n\n\"As you please, Mr. Ventimore, sir; only, if they're not to be\ninterfered with, I don't see myself how you're going to set your friends\ndown to dinner to-morrow, that's all.\"\n\nAnd, indeed, considering that the table and every available chair, and\neven the floor, were heaped so high with valuables that Horace himself\ncould only just squeeze his way between the piles, it seemed as if his\nguests might find themselves inconveniently cramped.\n\n\"It will be all right,\" he said, with an optimism he was very far from\nfeeling; \"we'll manage somehow--leave it to me.\"\n\nBefore he left for his office he took the precaution to baffle any\ninquisitiveness on the part of his landlady by locking his sitting-room\ndoor and carrying away the key, but it was in a very different mood from\nhis former light-hearted confidence that he sat down to his\ndrawing-board in Great Cloister Street that morning. He could not\nconcentrate his mind; his enthusiasm and his ideas had alike deserted\nhim.\n\nHe flung down the dividers he had been using and pushed away the nest of\nsaucers of Indian ink and colours in a fit of petulance. \"It's no good,\"\nhe exclaimed aloud; \"I feel a perfect duffer this morning. I couldn't\neven design a decent dog-kennel!\"\n\nEven as he spoke he became conscious of a presence in the room, and,\nlooking round, saw Fakrash the Jinnee standing at his elbow, smiling\ndown on him more benevolently than ever, and with a serene expectation\nof being warmly welcomed and thanked, which made Horace rather ashamed\nof his own inability to meet it.\n\n\"He's a thoroughly good-natured old chap,\" he thought,\nself-reproachfully. \"He means well, and I'm a beast not to feel more\nglad to see him. And yet, hang it all! I can't have him popping in and\nout of the office like a rabbit whenever the fancy takes him!\"\n\n\"Peace be upon thee,\" said Fakrash. \"Moderate the trouble of thy heart,\nand impart thy difficulties to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're nothing, thanks,\" said Horace, feeling decidedly\nembarrassed. \"I got stuck over my work for the moment, and it worried me\na little--that's all.\"\n\n\"Then thou hast not yet received the gifts which I commanded should be\ndelivered at thy dwelling-place?\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed I have!\" replied Horace; \"and--and I really don't know how\nto thank you for them.\"\n\n\"A few trifling presents,\" answered the Jinnee, \"and by no means suited\nto thy dignity--yet the best in my power to bestow upon thee for the\ntime being.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, they simply overwhelm me with their magnificence! They're\nbeyond all price, and--and I've no idea what to do with such a\nsuperabundance.\"\n\n\"A superfluity of good things is good,\" was the Jinnee's sententious\nreply.\n\n\"Not in my particular case. I--I quite feel your goodness and\ngenerosity; but, indeed, as I told you before, it's really impossible\nfor me to accept any such reward.\"\n\nFakrash's brows contracted slightly. \"How sayest thou that it is\nimpossible--seeing that these things are already in thy possession?\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Horace; \"but--you won't be offended if I speak quite\nplainly?\"\n\n\"Art thou not even as a son to me, and can I be angered at any words of\nthine?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, with sudden hope, \"honestly, then, I would very\nmuch rather--if you're sure you don't mind--that you would take them all\nback again.\"\n\n\"What? Dost thou demand that I, Fakrash-el-Aamash, should consent to\nreceive back the gifts I have bestowed? Are they, then, of so little\nvalue in thy sight?\"\n\n\"They're of too much value. If I took such a reward for--for a very\nordinary service, I should never be able to respect myself again.\"\n\n\"This is not the reasoning of an intelligent person,\" said the Jinnee,\ncoldly.\n\n\"If you think me a fool, I can't help it. I'm not an ungrateful fool, at\nall events. But I feel very strongly that I can't keep these gifts of\nyours.\"\n\n\"So thou wouldst have me break the oath which I swore to reward thee\nfitly for thy kind action?\"\n\n\"But you _have_ rewarded me already,\" said Horace, \"by contriving that a\nwealthy merchant should engage me to build him a residence. And--forgive\nmy plain speaking--if you truly desire my happiness (as I am sure you\ndo) you will relieve me of all these precious gems and merchandise,\nbecause, to be frank, they will _not_ make me happy. On the contrary,\nthey are making me extremely uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"In the days of old,\" said Fakrash, \"all men pursued wealth; nor could\nany amass enough to satisfy his desires. Have riches, then, become so\ncontemptible in mortal eyes that thou findest them but an encumbrance?\nExplain the matter.\"\n\nHorace felt a natural delicacy in giving his real reasons. \"I can't\nanswer for other men,\" he said. \"All I know is that I've never been\naccustomed to being rich, and I'd rather get used to it gradually, and\nbe able to feel that I owed it, as far as possible, to my own exertions.\nFor, as I needn't tell _you_, Mr. Fakrash, riches alone don't make any\nfellow happy. You must have observed that they're apt to--well, to land\nhim in all kinds of messes and worries.... I'm talking like a confounded\ncopybook,\" he thought, \"but I don't care how priggish I am if I can only\nget my way!\"\n\nFakrash was deeply impressed. \"O young man of marvellous moderation!\" he\ncried. \"Thy sentiments are not inferior to those of the Great Suleyman\nhimself (on whom be peace!). Yet even he doth not utterly despise them,\nfor he hath gold and ivory and precious stones in abundance. Nor\nhitherto have I ever met a human being capable of rejecting them when\noffered. But, since thou seemest sincere in holding that my poor and\npaltry gifts will not advance thy welfare, and since I would do thee\ngood and not evil--be it even as thou wouldst. For excellently was it\nsaid: 'The worth of a present depends not on itself, nor on the giver,\nbut on the receiver alone.'\"\n\nHorace could hardly believe that he had really prevailed. \"It's\nextremely good of you, sir,\" he said, \"to take it so well. And if you\n_could_ let that caravan call for them as soon as possible, it would be\na great convenience to me. I mean--er--the fact is, I'm expecting a few\nfriends to dine with me to-morrow, and, as my rooms are rather small at\nthe best of times, I don't quite know how I can manage to entertain\nthem at all unless something is done.\"\n\n\"It will be the easiest of actions,\" replied Fakrash; \"therefore, have\nno fear that, when the time cometh, thou wilt not be able to entertain\nthy friends in a fitting manner. And for the caravan, it shall set out\nwithout delay.\"\n\n\"By Jove, though, I'd forgotten one thing,\" said Horace: \"I've locked up\nthe room where your presents are--they won't be able to get in without\nthe key.\"\n\n\"Against the servants of the Jinn neither bolts nor bars can prevail.\nThey shall enter therein and remove all that they brought thee, since it\nis thy desire.\"\n\n\"Very many thanks,\" said Horace. \"And you do _really_ understand that\nI'm every bit as grateful as if I could keep the things? You see, I want\nall my time and all my energies to complete the designs for this\nbuilding, which,\" he added gracefully, \"I should never be in a position\nto do at all, but for your assistance.\"\n\n\"On my arrival,\" said Fakrash, \"I heard thee lamenting the difficulties\nof the task; wherein do they consist?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Horace, \"it's a little difficult to please all the different\npeople concerned, and myself too. I want to make something of it that I\nshall be proud of, and that will give me a reputation. It's a large\nhouse, and there will be a good deal of work in it; but I shall manage\nit all right.\"\n\n\"This is a great undertaking indeed,\" remarked the Jinnee, after he had\nasked various by no means unintelligent questions and received the\nanswers. \"But be persuaded that it shall all turn out most fortunately\nand thou shalt obtain great renown. And now,\" he concluded, \"I am\ncompelled to take leave of thee, for I am still without any certain\ntidings of Suleyman.\"\n\n\"You mustn't let me keep you,\" said Horace, who had been on thorns for\nsome minutes lest Beevor should return and find him with his mysterious\nvisitor. \"You see,\" he added instructively, \"so long as you _will_\nneglect your own much more important affairs to look after mine, you can\nhardly expect to make _much_ progress, can you?\"\n\n\"How excellent is the saying,\" replied the Jinnee: \"'The time which is\nspent in doing kindnesses, call it not wasted.'\"\n\n\"Yes, that's very good,\" said Horace, feeling driven to silence this\nmaxim, if possible, with one of his own invention. \"But _we_ have a\nsaying too--how does it go? Ah, I remember. 'It is possible for a\nkindness to be more inconvenient than an injury.'\"\n\n\"Marvellously gifted was he who discovered such a saying!\" cried\nFakrash.\n\n\"I imagine,\" said Horace, \"he learnt it from his own experience. By the\nway, what place were you thinking of drawing--I mean trying--next for\nSuleyman?\"\n\n\"I purpose to repair to Nineveh, and inquire there.\"\n\n\"Capital,\" said Ventimore, with hearty approval, for he hoped that this\nwould take the Jinnee some little time. \"Wonderful city, Nineveh, from\nall I've heard--though not quite what it used to be, perhaps. Then\nthere's Babylon--you might go on there. And if you shouldn't hear of him\nthere, why not strike down into Central Africa, and do that thoroughly?\nOr South America; it's a pity to lose any chance--you've never been to\nSouth America yet?\"\n\n\"I have not so much as heard of such a country, and how should Suleyman\nbe there?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, I didn't say he _was_ there. All I meant to convey was, that\nhe's quite as likely to be there as anywhere else. But if you're going\nto Nineveh first, you'd better lose no more time, for I've always\nunderstood that it's rather an awkward place to get at--though probably\n_you_ won't find it very difficult.\"\n\n\"I care not,\" said Fakrash, \"though the search be long, for in travel\nthere are five advantages----\"\n\n\"I know,\" interrupted Horace, \"so don't stop to describe them now. I\nshould like to see you fairly started, and you really mustn't think it\nnecessary to break off your search again on my account, because, thanks\nto you, I shall get on splendidly alone for the future--if you'll kindly\nsee that that merchandise is removed.\"\n\n\"Thine abode shall not be encumbered with it for another hour,\" said the\nJinnee. \"O thou judicious one, in whose estimation wealth is of no\nvalue, know that I have never encountered a mortal who pleased me as\nthou hast; and moreover, be assured that such magnanimity as thine shall\nnot go without a recompense!\"\n\n\"How often must I tell you,\" said Horace, in a glow of impatience, \"that\nI am already much more than recompensed? Now, my kind, generous old\nfriend,\" he added, with an emotion that was not wholly insincere, \"the\ntime has come to bid you farewell--for ever. Let me picture you as\nrevisiting your former haunts, penetrating to quarters of the globe\n(for, whether you are aware of it or not, this earth of ours _is_ a\nglobe) hitherto unknown to you, refreshing your mind by foreign travel\nand the study of mankind--but never, never for a moment losing sight of\nyour main object, the eventual discovery of and reconciliation with\nSuleyman (on whom be peace!). That is the greatest, the only happiness\nyou can give me now. Good-bye, and _bon voyage_!\"\n\n\"May Allah never deprive thy friends of thy presence!\" returned the\nJinnee, who was apparently touched by this exordium, \"for truly thou art\na most excellent young man!\"\n\nAnd stepping back into the fireplace, he was gone in an instant.\n\nVentimore sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief. He had begun to\nfear that the Jinnee never would take himself off, but he had gone at\nlast--and for good.\n\nHe was half ashamed of himself for feeling so glad, for Fakrash was a\ngood-natured old thing enough in his way. Only he _would_ overdo things:\nhe had no sense of proportion. \"Why,\" thought Horace, \"if a fellow\nexpressed a modest wish for a canary in a cage he's just the sort of old\nJinnee to bring him a whole covey of rocs in an aviary about ten times\nthe size of the Crystal Palace. However, he _does_ understand now that I\ncan't take anything more from him, and he isn't offended either, so\n_that's_ all settled. Now I can set to work and knock off these plans in\npeace and quietness.\"\n\nBut he had not done much before he heard sounds in the next room which\ntold him that Beevor had returned at last. He had been expected back\nfrom the country for the last day or two, and it was fortunate that he\nhad delayed so long, thought Ventimore, as he went in to see him and to\ntell him the unexpected piece of good fortune that he himself had met\nwith since they last met. It is needless to say that, in giving his\naccount, he abstained from any mention of the brass bottle or the\nJinnee, as unessential elements in his story.\n\nBeevor's congratulations were quite as cordial as could be expected, as\nsoon as he fully understood that no hoax was intended. \"Well, old man,\"\nhe said, \"I _am_ glad. I really am, you know. To think of a prize like\nthat coming to you the very first time! And you don't even know how this\nMr. Wackerbath came to hear of you--just happened to see your name up\noutside and came in, I expect. Why, I dare say, if I hadn't chanced to\ngo away as I did--and about a couple of paltry two thousand pound\nhouses, too! Ah, well, I don't grudge you your luck, though it _does_\nseem rather---- It was worth waiting for; you'll be cutting _me_ out\nbefore long--if you don't make a mess of this job. I mean, you know, old\nchap, if you don't go and give your City man a Gothic castle when what\nhe wants is something with plenty of plate-glass windows and a\nCorinthian portico. That's the rock I see ahead of _you_. You mustn't\nmind my giving you a word of warning!\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Ventimore; \"but I shan't give him either a Gothic castle\nor plenty of plate-glass. I venture to think he'll be pleased with the\ngeneral idea as I'm working it out.\"\n\n\"Let's hope so,\" said Beevor. \"If you get into any difficulty, you\nknow,\" he added, with a touch of patronage, \"just you come to me.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Horace, \"I will. But I'm getting on very fairly at\npresent.\"\n\n\"I should rather like to see what you've made of it. I might be able to\ngive you a wrinkle here and there.\"\n\n\"It's awfully good of you, but I think I'd rather you didn't see the\nplans till they're quite finished,\" said Horace. The truth was that he\nwas perfectly aware that the other would not be in sympathy with his\nideas; and Horace, who had just been suffering from a cold fit of\ndepression about his work, rather shrank from any kind of criticism.\n\n\"Oh, just as you please!\" said Beevor, a little stiffly; \"you always\n_were_ an obstinate beggar. I've had a certain amount of experience, you\nknow, in my poor little pottering way, and I thought I might possibly\nhave saved you a cropper or two. But if you think you can manage better\nalone--only don't get bolted with by one of those architectural hobbies\nof yours, that's all.\"\n\n\"All right, old fellow. I'll ride my hobby on the curb,\" said Horace,\nlaughing, as he went back to his own office, where he found that all his\nformer certainty and enjoyment of his work had returned to him, and by\nthe end of the day he had made so much progress that his designs needed\nonly a few finishing touches to be complete enough for his client's\ninspection.\n\nBetter still, on returning to his rooms that evening to change before\ngoing to Kensington, he found that the admirable Fakrash had kept his\npromise--every chest, sack, and bale had been cleared away.\n\n\"Them camels come back for the things this afternoon, sir,\" said Mrs.\nRapkin, \"and it put me in a fluster at first, for I made sure you'd\nlocked your door and took the key. But I must have been\nmistook--leastways, them Arabs got in somehow. I hope you meant\neverything to go back?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Horace; \"I saw the--the person who sent them this morning,\nand told him there was nothing I cared for enough to keep.\"\n\n\"And like his impidence sending you a lot o' rubbish like that on\napproval--and on camels, too!\" declared Mrs. Rapkin. \"I'm sure I don't\nknow what them advertising firms will try next--pushing, _I_ call it.\"\n\nNow that everything was gone, Horace felt a little natural regret and\ndoubt whether he need have been quite so uncompromising in his refusal\nof the treasures. \"I might have kept some of those tissues and things\nfor Sylvia,\" he thought; \"and she loves pearls. And a prayer-carpet\nwould have pleased the Professor tremendously. But no, after all, it\nwouldn't have done. Sylvia couldn't go about in pearls the size of new\npotatoes, and the Professor would only have ragged me for more reckless\nextravagance. Besides, if I'd taken any of the Jinnee's gifts, he might\nkeep on pouring more in, till I should be just where I was before--or\nworse off, really, because I couldn't decently refuse them, then. So\nit's best as it is.\"\n\nAnd really, considering his temperament and the peculiar nature of his\nposition, it is not easy to see how he could have arrived at any other\nconclusion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. BACHELOR'S QUARTERS\n\n\nHorace was feeling particularly happy as he walked back the next evening\nto Vincent Square. He had the consciousness of having done a good day's\nwork, for the sketch-plans for Mr. Wackerbath's mansion were actually\ncompleted and despatched to his business address, while Ventimore now\nfelt a comfortable assurance that his designs would more than satisfy\nhis client.\n\nBut it was not that which made him so light of heart. That night his\nrooms were to be honoured for the first time by Sylvia's presence. She\nwould tread upon his carpet, sit in his chairs, comment upon, and\nperhaps even handle, his books and ornaments--and all of them would\nretain something of her charm for ever after. If she only came! For even\nnow he could not quite believe that she really would; that some untoward\nevent would not make a point of happening to prevent her, as he\nsometimes doubted whether his engagement was not too sweet and wonderful\nto be true--or, at all events, to last.\n\nAs to the dinner, his mind was tolerably easy, for he had settled the\nremaining details of the _menu_ with his landlady that morning, and he\ncould hope that without being so sumptuous as to excite the Professor's\nwrath, it would still be not altogether unworthy--and what goods could\nbe rare and dainty enough?--to be set before Sylvia.\n\nHe would have liked to provide champagne, but he knew that wine would\nsavour of ostentation in the Professor's judgment, so he had contented\nhimself instead with claret, a sound vintage which he knew he could\ndepend upon. Flowers, he thought, were clearly permissible, and he had\ncalled at a florist's on his way and got some chrysanthemums of palest\nyellow and deepest terra-cotta, the finest he could see. Some of them\nwould look well on the centre of the table in an old Nankin\nblue-and-white bowl he had; the rest he could arrange about the room:\nthere would just be time to see to all that before dressing.\n\nOccupied with these thoughts, he turned into Vincent Square, which\nlooked vaster than ever with the murky haze, enclosed by its high\nrailings, and under a wide expanse of steel-blue sky, across which the\nclouds were driving fast like ships in full sail scudding for harbour\nbefore a storm. Against the mist below, the young and nearly leafless\ntrees showed flat, black profiles as of pressed seaweed, and the sky\nimmediately above the house-tops was tinged with a sullen red from miles\nof lighted streets; from the river came the long-drawn tooting of tugs,\nmingled with the more distant wail and hysterical shrieks of railway\nengines on the Lambeth lines.\n\nAnd now he reached the old semi-detached house in which he lodged, and\nnoticed for the first time how the trellis-work of the veranda made,\nwith the bared creepers and hanging baskets, a kind of decorative\npattern against the windows, which were suffused with a roseate glow\nthat looked warm and comfortable and hospitable. He wondered whether\nSylvia would notice it when she arrived.\n\nHe passed under the old wrought-iron arch that once held an oil-lamp,\nand up a short but rather steep flight of steps, which led to a brick\nporch built out at the side. Then he let himself in, and stood\nspellbound with perplexed amazement,--for he was in a strange house.\n\nIn place of the modest passage with the yellow marble wall-paper, the\nmahogany hat-stand, and the elderly barometer in a state of chronic\ndepression which he knew so well, he found an arched octagonal\nentrance-hall with arabesques of blue, crimson, and gold, and\nrichly-embroidered hangings; the floor was marble, and from a shallow\nbasin of alabaster in the centre a perfumed fountain rose and fell with\na lulling patter.\n\n\"I must have mistaken the number,\" he thought, quite forgetting that his\nlatch-key had fitted, and he was just about to retreat before his\nintrusion was discovered, when the hangings parted, and Mrs. Rapkin\npresented herself, making so deplorably incongruous a figure in such\nsurroundings, and looking so bewildered and woebegone, that Horace, in\nspite of his own increasing uneasiness, had some difficulty in keeping\nhis gravity.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Ventimore, sir,\" she lamented; \"whatever _will_ you go and do\nnext, I wonder? To think of your going and having the whole place done\nup and altered out of knowledge like this, without a word of warning! If\nany halterations were required, I _do_ think as me and Rapkin had the\nright to be consulted.\"\n\nHorace let all his chrysanthemums drop unheeded into the fountain. He\nunderstood now: indeed, he seemed in some way to have understood almost\nfrom the first, only he would not admit it even to himself.\n\nThe irrepressible Jinnee was at the bottom of this, of course. He\nremembered now having made that unfortunate remark the day before about\nthe limited accommodation his rooms afforded.\n\nClearly Fakrash must have taken a mental note of it, and, with that\ninsatiable munificence which was one of his worst failings, had\ndetermined, by way of a pleasant surprise, to entirely refurnish and\nredecorate the apartments according to his own ideas.\n\nIt was extremely kind of him; it showed a truly grateful\ndisposition--\"but, oh!\" as Horace thought, in the bitterness of his\nsoul, \"if he would only learn to let well alone and mind his own\nbusiness!\"\n\nHowever, the thing was done now, and he must accept the responsibility\nfor it, since he could hardly disclose the truth. \"Didn't I mention I\nwas having some alterations made?\" he said carelessly. \"They've got the\nwork done rather sooner than I expected. Were--were they long over it?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can't tell you, sir, having stepped out to get some things I\nwanted in for to-night; and Rapkin, he was round the corner at his\nreading-room; and when I come back it was all done and the workmen gone\n'ome; and how they could have finished such a job in the time beats me\naltogether, for when we 'ad the men in to do the back kitchen they took\nten days over it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, evading this point, \"however they've done this,\nthey've done it remarkably well--you'll admit that, Mrs. Rapkin?\"\n\n\"That's as may be sir,\" said Mrs. Rapkin, with a sniff, \"but it ain't\n_my_ taste, nor yet I don't think it will be Rapkin's taste when he\ncomes to see it.\"\n\nIt was not Ventimore's taste either, though he was not going to confess\nit. \"Sorry for that, Mrs. Rapkin,\" he said, \"but I've no time to talk\nabout it now. I must rush upstairs and dress.\"\n\n\"Begging your pardon, sir, but that's a total unpossibility--for they've\nbeen and took away the staircase.'\n\n\"Taken away the staircase? Nonsense!\" cried Horace.\n\n\"So _I_ think, Mr. Ventimore--but it's what them men have done, and if\nyou don't believe me, come and see for yourself!\"\n\nShe drew the hangings aside, and revealed to Ventimore's astonished gaze\na vast pillared hall with a lofty domed roof, from which hung several\nlamps, diffusing a subdued radiance. High up in the wall, on his left,\nwere the two windows which he judged to have formerly belonged to his\nsitting-room (for either from delicacy or inability, or simply because\nit had not occurred to him, the Jinnee had not interfered with the\nexternal structure), but the windows were now masked by a perforated\nand gilded lattice, which accounted for the pattern Horace had noticed\nfrom without. The walls were covered with blue-and-white Oriental tiles,\nand a raised platform of alabaster on which were divans ran round two\nsides of the hall, while the side opposite to him was pierced with\nhorseshoe-shaped arches, apparently leading to other apartments. The\ncentre of the marble floor was spread with costly rugs and piles of\ncushions, their rich hues glowing through the gold with which they were\nintricately embroidered.\n\n\"Well,\" said the unhappy Horace, scarcely knowing what he was saying,\n\"it--it all looks very _cosy_, Mrs. Rapkin.\"\n\n\"It's not for me to say, sir; but I should like to know where you\nthought of dining?\"\n\n\"Where?\" said Horace. \"Why, here, of course. There's plenty of room.\"\n\n\"There isn't a table left in the house,\" said Mrs. Rapkin; \"so, unless\nyou'd wish the cloth laid on the floor----\"\n\n\"Oh, there must be a table somewhere,\" said Horace, impatiently, \"or you\ncan borrow one. Don't _make_ difficulties, Mrs. Rapkin. Rig up anything\nyou like.... Now I must be off and dress.\"\n\nHe got rid of her, and, on entering one of the archways, discovered a\nsmaller room, in cedar-wood encrusted with ivory and mother-o'-pearl,\nwhich was evidently his bedroom. A gorgeous robe, stiff with gold and\nglittering with ancient gems, was laid out for him--for the Jinnee had\nthought of everything--but Ventimore, naturally, preferred his own\nevening clothes.\n\n\"Mr. Rapkin!\" he shouted, going to another arch that seemed to\ncommunicate with the basement.\n\n\"Sir?\" replied his landlord, who had just returned from his\n\"reading-room,\" and now appeared, without a tie and in his\nshirt-sleeves, looking pale and wild, as was, perhaps, intelligible in\nthe circumstances. As he entered his unfamiliar marble halls he\nstaggered, and his red eyes rolled and his mouth gaped in a cod-like\nfashion. \"They've been at it 'ere, too, seemin'ly,\" he remarked huskily.\n\n\"There have been a few changes,\" said Horace, quietly, \"as you can see.\nYou don't happen to know where they've put my dress-clothes, do you?\"\n\n\"I don't 'appen to know where they've put nothink. Your dress clothes?\nWhy, I dunno where they've bin and put our little parler where me and\nMaria 'ave set of a hevenin' all these years regular. I dunno where\nthey've put the pantry, nor yet the bath-room, with 'ot and cold water\nlaid on at my own expense. And you arsk me to find your hevenin' soot! I\nconsider, sir, I consider that a unwall--that a most unwarrant-terrible\nliberty have bin took at my expense.\"\n\n\"My good man, don't talk rubbish!\" said Horace.\n\n\"I'm talking to you about what _I know_, and I assert that an\nEnglishman's 'ome is his cashle, and nobody's got the right when his\nbacksh turned to go and make a 'Ummums of it. Not _nobody_ 'asn't!\"\n\n\"Make a _what_ of it?\" cried Ventimore.\n\n\"A 'Ummums--that's English, ain't it? A bloomin' Turkish baths! Who do\nyou suppose is goin' to take apartments furnished in this 'ere\nridic'loush style? What am I goin' to say to my landlord? It'll about\nruing me, this will; and after you bein' a lodger 'ere for five year and\nmore, and regarded by me and Maria in the light of one of the family.\nIt's 'ard--it's damned 'ard!\"\n\n\"Now, look here,\" said Ventimore, sharply--for it was obvious that Mr.\nRapkin's studies had been lightened by copious refreshment--\"pull\nyourself together, man, and listen to me.\"\n\n\"I respeckfully decline to pull myshelf togerrer f'r anybody livin',\"\nsaid Mr. Rapkin, with a noble air. \"I shtan' 'ere upon my dignity as a\nman, sir. I shay, I shtand 'ere upon----\" Here he waved his hand, and\nsat down suddenly upon the marble floor.\n\n\"You can stand on anything you like--or can,\" said Horace; \"but hear\nwhat I've got to say. The--the people who made all these alterations\nwent beyond my instructions. I never wanted the house interfered with\nlike this. Still, if your landlord doesn't see that its value is\nimmensely improved, he's a fool, that's all. Anyway, I'll take care\n_you_ shan't suffer. If I have to put everything back in its former\nstate, I will, at my own expense. So don't bother any more about\n_that_.\"\n\n\"You're a gen'l'man, Mr. Ventimore,\" said Rapkin, cautiously regaining\nhis feet. \"There's no mishtaking a gen'l'man. _I'm_ a gen'l'man.\"\n\n\"Of course you are,\" said Horace genially, \"and I'll tell you how you're\ngoing to show it. You're going straight downstairs to get your good wife\nto pour some cold water over your head; and then you will finish\ndressing, see what you can do to get a table of some sort and lay it for\ndinner, and be ready to announce my friends when they arrive, and wait\nafterwards. Do you see?\"\n\n\"That will be all ri', Mr. Ventimore,\" said Rapkin, who was not far gone\nenough to be beyond understanding or obeying. \"You leave it entirely to\nme. I'll unnertake that your friends shall be made comforrable, perfelly\ncomforrable. I've lived as butler in the besht, the mosht ecxlu--most\narishto--you know the sort o' fam'lies I'm tryin' to r'member--and--and\neverything was always all ri', and _I_ shall be all ri' in a few\nminutes.\"\n\nWith this assurance he stumbled downstairs, leaving Horace relieved to\nsome extent. Rapkin would be sober enough after his head had been under\nthe tap for a few minutes, and in any case there would be the hired\nwaiter to rely upon.\n\nIf he could only find out where his evening clothes were! He returned to\nhis room and made another frantic search--but they were nowhere to be\nfound; and as he could not bring himself to receive his guests in his\nordinary morning costume--which the Professor would probably construe as\na deliberate slight, and which would certainly seem a solecism in Mrs.\nFutvoye's eyes, if not in her daughter's--he decided to put on the\nEastern robes, with the exception of a turban, which he could not manage\nto wind round his head.\n\nThus arrayed he re-entered the domed hall, where he was annoyed to find\nthat no attempt had been made as yet to prepare a dinner-table, and he\nwas just looking forlornly round for a bell when Rapkin appeared. He had\napparently followed Horace's advice, for his hair looked wet and sleek,\nand he was comparatively sober.\n\n\"This is too bad!\" cried Horace; \"my friends may be here at any moment\nnow--and nothing done. You don't propose to wait at table like that, do\nyou?\" he added, as he noted the man's overcoat and the comforter round\nhis throat.\n\n\"I do not propose to wait in any garments whatsoever,\" said Rapkin; \"I'm\na-goin' out, I am.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Horace; \"then send the waiter up--I suppose he's\ncome?\"\n\n\"He come--but he went away again--I told him as he wouldn't be\nrequired.\"\n\n\"You told him that!\" Horace said angrily, and then controlled himself.\n\"Come, Rapkin, be reasonable. You can't really mean to leave your wife\nto cook the dinner, and serve it too!\"\n\n\"She ain't intending to do neither; she've left the house already.\"\n\n\"You must fetch her back,\" cried Horace. \"Good heavens, man, _can't_ you\nsee what a fix you're leaving me in? My friends have started long\nago--it's too late to wire to them, or make any other arrangements.\"\n\nThere was a knock, as he spoke, at the front door; and odd enough was\nthe familiar sound of the cast-iron knocker in that Arabian hall.\n\n\"There they are!\" he said, and the idea of meeting them at the door and\nproposing an instant adjournment to a restaurant occurred to him--till\nhe suddenly recollected that he would have to change and try to find\nsome money, even for that. \"For the last time, Rapkin,\" he cried in\ndespair, \"do you mean to tell me there's no dinner ready?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Rapkin, \"there's dinner right enough, and a lot o' barbarious\nfurriners downstairs a cookin' of it--that's what broke Maria's 'art--to\nsee it all took out of her 'ands, after the trouble she'd gone to.\"\n\n\"But I must have somebody to wait,\" exclaimed Horace.\n\n\"You've got waiters enough, as far as that goes. But if you expect a\nhordinary Christian man to wait along of a lot o' narsty niggers, and be\nat their beck and call, you're mistook, sir, for I'm going to sleep the\nnight at my brother-in-law's and take his advice, he bein' a doorkeeper\nat a solicitor's orfice and knowing the law, about this 'ere business,\nand so I wish you a good hevening, and 'oping your dinner will be to\nyour liking and satisfaction.\"\n\nHe went out by the farther archway, while from the entrance-hall Horace\ncould hear voices he knew only too well. The Futvoyes had come; well, at\nall events, it seemed that there would be something for them to eat,\nsince Fakrash, in his anxiety to do the thing thoroughly, had furnished\nboth the feast and attendance himself--but who was there to announce the\nguests? Where were these waiters Rapkin had spoken of? Ought he to go\nand bring in his visitors himself?\n\nThese questions answered themselves the next instant, for, as he stood\nthere under the dome, the curtains of the central arch were drawn with a\nrattle, and disclosed a double line of tall slaves in rich raiment,\ntheir onyx eyes rolling and their teeth flashing in their chocolate-hued\ncountenances, as they salaamed.\n\nBetween this double line stood Professor and Mrs. Futvoye and Sylvia,\nwho had just removed their wraps and were gazing in undisguised\nastonishment on the splendours which met their view.\n\nHorace advanced to receive them; he felt he was in for it now, and the\nonly course left him was to put as good a face as he could on the\nmatter, and trust to luck to pull him through without discovery or\ndisaster.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. \"PERSICOS ODI, PUER, APPARATUS\"\n\n\n\"So you've found your way here at last?\" said Horace, as he shook hands\nheartily with the Professor and Mrs. Futvoye. \"I can't tell you how\ndelighted I am to see you.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, he was very far from being at ease, which made him\nrather over-effusive, but he was determined that, if he could help it,\nhe would not betray the slightest consciousness of anything _bizarre_ or\nunusual in his domestic arrangements.\n\n\"And these,\" said Mrs. Futvoye, who was extremely stately in black,\nwith old lace and steel embroidery--\"these are the bachelor lodgings you\nwere so modest about! Really,\" she added, with a humorous twinkle in her\nshrewd eyes, \"you young men seem to understand how to make yourselves\ncomfortable--don't they, Anthony?\"\n\n\"They do, indeed,\" said the Professor, dryly, though it manifestly cost\nhim some effort to conceal his appreciation. \"To produce such results as\nthese must, if I mistake not, have entailed infinite research--and\nconsiderable expense.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Horace, \"no. You--you'd be surprised if you knew how little.\"\n\n\"I should have imagined,\" retorted the Professor, \"that _any_ outlay on\napartments which I presume you do not contemplate occupying for an\nextended period must be money thrown away. But, doubtless, you know\nbest.\"\n\n\"But your rooms are quite wonderful, Horace!\" cried Sylvia, her charming\neyes dilating with admiration. \"And where, _where_ did you get that\nmagnificent dressing-gown? I never saw anything so lovely in my life!\"\n\nShe herself was lovely enough in a billowy, shimmering frock of a\ndelicate apple-green hue, her only ornament a deep-blue Egyptian scarab\nwith spread wings, which was suspended from her neck by a slender gold\nchain.\n\n\"I--I ought to apologise for receiving you in this costume,\" said\nHorace, with embarrassment; \"but the fact is, I couldn't find my evening\nclothes anywhere, so--so I put on the first things that came to hand.\"\n\n\"It is hardly necessary,\" said the Professor, conscious of being\ncorrectly clad, and unconscious that his shirt-front was bulging and his\nlong-eared white tie beginning to work up towards his left jaw--\"hardly\nnecessary to offer any apology for the simplicity of your costume--which\nis entirely in keeping with the--ah--strictly Oriental character of your\ninterior.\"\n\n\"_I_ feel dreadfully out of keeping!\" said Sylvia, \"for there's nothing\nin the least Oriental about _me_--unless it's my scarab--and he's I\ndon't know how many centuries behind the time, poor dear!\"\n\n\"If you said 'thousands of years,' my dear,\" corrected the Professor,\n\"you would be more accurate. That scarab was taken out of a tomb of the\nthirteenth dynasty.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure he'd rather be where he is,\" said Sylvia, and Ventimore\nentirely agreed with her. \"Horace, I _must_ look at everything. How\nclever and original of you to transform an ordinary London house into\nthis!\"\n\n\"Oh, well, you see,\" explained Horace, \"it--it wasn't exactly done by\nme.\"\n\n\"Whoever did it,\" said the Professor, \"must have devoted considerable\nstudy to Eastern art and architecture. May I ask the name of the firm\nwho executed the alterations?\"\n\n\"I really couldn't tell you, sir,\" answered Horace, who was beginning\nto understand how very bad a _mauvais quart d'heure_ can be.\n\n\"You can't tell me!\" exclaimed the Professor. \"You order these\nextensive, and _I_ should say expensive, decorations, and you don't know\nthe firm you selected to carry them out!\"\n\n\"Of course I _know_,\" said Horace, \"only I don't happen to remember at\nthis moment. Let me see, now. Was it Liberty? No, I'm almost certain it\nwasn't Liberty. It might have been Maple, but I'm not sure. Whoever did\ndo it, they were marvellously cheap.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" said the Professor, in his most unpleasant tone.\n\"Where is your dining-room?\"\n\n\"Why, I rather think,\" said Horace, helplessly, as he saw a train of\nattendants laying a round cloth on the floor, \"I rather think _this_ is\nthe dining-room.\"\n\n\"You appear to be in some doubt?\" said the Professor.\n\n\"I leave it to them--it depends where they choose to lay the cloth,\"\nsaid Horace. \"Sometimes in one place; sometimes in another. There's a\ngreat charm in uncertainty,\" he faltered.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said the Professor.\n\nBy this time two of the slaves, under the direction of a tall and\nturbaned black, had set a low ebony stool, inlaid with silver and\ntortoiseshell in strange devices, on the round carpet, when other\nattendants followed with a circular silver tray containing covered\ndishes, which they placed on the stool and salaamed.\n\n\"Your--ah--groom of the chambers,\" said the Professor, \"seems to have\ndecided that we should dine here. I observe they are making signs to you\nthat the food is on the table.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Ventimore. \"Shall we sit down?\"\n\n\"But, my dear Horace,\" said Mrs. Futvoye, \"your butler has forgotten the\nchairs.\"\n\n\"You don't appear to realise, my dear,\" said the Professor, \"that in\nsuch an interior as this chairs would be hopelessly incongruous.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid there aren't any,\" said Horace, for there was nothing but\nfour fat cushions. \"Let's sit down on these,\" he proposed. \"It--it's\nmore fun!\"\n\n\"At my time of life,\" said the Professor, irritably, as he let himself\ndown on the plumpest cushion, \"such fun as may be derived from eating\none's meals on the floor fails to appeal to my sense of humour. However,\nI admit that it is thoroughly Oriental.\"\n\n\"_I_ think it's delightful,\" said Sylvia; \"ever so much nicer than a\nstiff, conventional dinner-party.\"\n\n\"One may be unconventional,\" remarked her father, \"without escaping the\npenalty of stiffness. Go away, sir! go away!\" he added snappishly, to\none of the slaves, who was attempting to pour water over his hands.\n\"Your servant, Ventimore, appears to imagine that I go out to dinner\nwithout taking the trouble to wash my hands previously. This, I may\nmention, is _not_ the case.\"\n\n\"It's only an Eastern ceremony, Professor,\" said Horace.\n\n\"I am perfectly well aware of what is customary in the East,\" retorted\nthe Professor; \"it does not follow that such--ah--hygienic precautions\nare either necessary or desirable at a Western table.\"\n\nHorace made no reply; he was too much occupied in gazing blankly at the\nsilver dish-covers and wondering what in the world might be underneath;\nnor was his perplexity relieved when the covers were removed, for he was\nquite at a loss to guess how he was supposed to help the contents\nwithout so much as a fork.\n\nThe chief attendant, however, solved that difficulty by intimating in\npantomime that the guests were expected to use their fingers.\n\nSylvia accomplished this daintily and with intense amusement, but her\nfather and mother made no secret of their repugnance. \"If I were dining\nin the desert with a Sheik, sir,\" observed the Professor, \"I should, I\nhope, know how to conform to his habits and prejudices. Here, in the\nheart of London, I confess all this strikes me as a piece of needless\npedantry.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry,\" said Horace; \"I'd have some knives and forks if I\ncould--but I'm afraid these fellows don't even understand what they are,\nso it's useless to order any. We--we must rough it a little, that's all.\nI hope that--er--fish is all right, Professor?\"\n\nHe did not know precisely what kind of fish it was, but it was fried in\noil of sesame and flavoured with a mixture of cinnamon and ginger, and\nthe Professor did not appear to be making much progress with it.\nVentimore himself would have infinitely preferred the original cod and\noyster sauce, but that could not be helped now.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Professor, \"it is curious--but characteristic. Not\n_any_ more, thank you.\"\n\nHorace could only trust that the next course would be more of a success.\nIt was a dish of mutton, stewed with peaches, jujubes and sugar, which\nSylvia declared was delicious. Her parents made no comment.\n\n\"Might I ask for something to drink?\" said the Professor, presently;\nwhereupon a cupbearer poured him a goblet of iced sherbet perfumed with\nconserve of violets.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, my dear fellow,\" he said, after sipping it, \"but if I\ndrink this I shall be ill all next day. If I might have a glass of\nwine----\"\n\nAnother slave instantly handed him a cup of wine, which he tasted and\nset down with a wry face and a shudder. Horace tried some afterwards,\nand was not surprised. It was a strong, harsh wine, in which goatskin\nand resin struggled for predominance.\n\n\"It's an old and, I make no doubt, a fine wine,\" observed the Professor,\nwith studied politeness, \"but I fancy it must have suffered in\ntransportation. I really think that, with my gouty tendency, a little\nwhisky and Apollinaris would be better for me--if you keep such\noccidental fluids in the house?\"\n\nHorace felt convinced that it would be useless to order the slaves to\nbring whisky or Apollinaris, which were of course, unknown in the\nJinnee's time, so he could do nothing but apologise for their absence.\n\n\"No matter,\" said the Professor; \"I am not so thirsty that I cannot wait\ntill I get home.\"\n\nIt was some consolation that both Sylvia and her mother commended the\nsherbet, and even appreciated--or were so obliging as to say they\nappreciated--the _entrée_, which consisted of rice and mincemeat wrapped\nin vine-leaves, and certainly was not appetising in appearance, besides\nbeing difficult to dispose of gracefully.\n\nIt was followed by a whole lamb fried in oil, stuffed with pounded\npistachio nuts, pepper, nutmeg, and coriander seeds, and liberally\nbesprinkled with rose-water and musk.\n\nOnly Horace had sufficient courage to attack the lamb--and he found\nreason to regret it. Afterwards came fowls stuffed with raisins,\nparsley, and crumbled bread, and the banquet ended with pastry of weird\nforms and repellent aspect.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Horace, anxiously, \"you don't find this Eastern cookery\nvery--er--unpalatable?\"--he himself was feeling distinctly unwell: \"it's\nrather a change from the ordinary routine.\"\n\n\"I have made a truly wonderful dinner, thank you,\" replied the\nProfessor, not, it is to be feared, without intention. \"Even in the East\nI have eaten nothing approaching this.\"\n\n\"But where did your landlady pick up this extraordinary cooking, my dear\nHorace?\" said Mrs. Futvoye. \"I thought you said she was merely a plain\ncook. Has she ever lived in the East?\"\n\n\"Not exactly _in_ the East,\" exclaimed Horace; \"not what you would call\n_living_ there. The fact is,\" he continued, feeling that he was in\ndanger of drivelling, and that he had better be as candid as he could,\n\"this dinner _wasn't_ cooked by her. She--she was obliged to go away\nquite suddenly. So the dinner was all sent in by--by a sort of\ncontractor, you know. He supplies the whole thing, waiters and all.\"\n\n\"I was thinking,\" said the Professor, \"that for a bachelor--an _engaged_\nbachelor--you seemed to maintain rather a large establishment.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're only here for the evening, sir,\" said Horace. \"Capital\nfellows--more picturesque than the local greengrocer--and they don't\nbreathe on the top of your head.\"\n\n\"They're perfect dears, Horace,\" remarked Sylvia; \"only--well, just a\n_little_ creepy-crawly to look at!\"\n\n\"It would ill become me to criticise the style and method of our\nentertainment,\" put in the Professor, acidly, \"otherwise I might be\ntempted to observe that it scarcely showed that regard for economy which\nI should have----\"\n\n\"Now, Anthony,\" put in his wife, \"don't let us have any fault-finding.\nI'm sure Horace has done it all delightfully--yes, delightfully; and\neven if he _has_ been just a little extravagant, it's not as if he was\nobliged to be as economical _now_, you know!\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said the Professor, \"I have yet to learn that the prospect of\nan increased income in the remote future is any justification for\nreckless profusion in the present.\"\n\n\"If you only knew,\" said Horace, \"you wouldn't call it profusion.\nIt--it's not at all the dinner I meant it to be, and I'm afraid it\nwasn't particularly nice--but it's certainly not expensive.\"\n\n\"Expensive is, of course, a very relative term. But I think I have the\nright to ask whether this is the footing on which you propose to begin\nyour married life?\"\n\nIt was an extremely awkward question, as the reader will perceive. If\nVentimore replied--as he might with truth--that he had no intention\nwhatever of maintaining his wife in luxury such as that, he stood\nconvicted of selfish indulgence as a bachelor; if, on the other hand, he\ndeclared that he _did_ propose to maintain his wife in the same\nfantastic and exaggerated splendour as the present, it would certainly\nconfirm her father's disbelief in his prudence and economy.\n\nAnd it was that egregious old ass of a Jinnee, as Horace thought, with\nsuppressed rage, who had let him in for all this, and who was now far\nbeyond all remonstrance or reproach!\n\nBefore he could bring himself to answer the question, the attendants had\nnoiselessly removed the tray and stool, and were handing round rosewater\nin a silver ewer and basin, the character of which, luckily or\notherwise, turned the Professor's inquisitiveness into a different\nchannel.\n\n\"These are not bad--really not bad at all,\" he said, inspecting the\ndesign. \"Where did you manage to pick them up?\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" said Horace; \"they're provided by the--the person who\nsupplies the dinner.\"\n\n\"Can you give me his address?\" said the Professor, scenting a bargain;\n\"because really, you know, these things are probably antiques--much too\ngood to be used for business purposes.\"\n\n\"I'm wrong,\" said Horace, lamely; \"these particular things are--are lent\nby an eccentric Oriental gentleman, as a great favour.\"\n\n\"Do I know him? Is he a collector of such things?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have met him; he--he's lived a very retired life of late.\"\n\n\"I should very much like to see his collection. If you could give me a\nletter of introduction----\"\n\n\"No,\" said Horace, in a state of prickly heat; \"it wouldn't be any use.\nHis collection is never shown. He--he's a most peculiar man. And just\nnow he's abroad.\"\n\n\"Ah! pardon me if I've been indiscreet; but I concluded from what you\nsaid that this--ah--banquet was furnished by a professional caterer.\"\n\n\"Oh, the banquet? Yes, _that_ came from the Stores,\" said Horace,\nmendaciously. \"The--the Oriental Cookery Department. They've just\nstarted it, you know; so--so I thought I'd give them a trial. But it's\nnot what I call properly organised yet.\"\n\nThe slaves were now, with low obeisances, inviting them to seat\nthemselves on the divan which lined part of the hall.\n\n\"Ha!\" said the Professor, as he rose from his cushion, cracking audibly,\n\"so we're to have our coffee and what not over there, hey?... Well, my\nboy, I shan't be sorry, I confess, to have something to lean my back\nagainst--and a cigar, a mild cigar, will--ah--aid digestion. You _do_\nsmoke here?\"\n\n\"Smoke?\" said Horace, \"Why, of course! All over the place. Here,\" he\nsaid, clapping his hands, which brought an obsequious slave instantly to\nhis side; \"just bring coffee and cigars, will you?\"\n\nThe slave rolled his brandy-ball eyes in obvious perplexity.\n\n\"Coffee,\" said Horace; \"you must know what coffee is. And cigarettes.\nWell, _chibouks_, then--'hubble-bubbles'--if that's what you call them.\"\n\nBut the slave clearly did not understand, and it suddenly struck Horace\nthat, since 'tobacco and coffee were not introduced, even in the East,\ntill long after the Jinnee's time, he, as the founder of the feast,\nwould naturally be unaware how indispensable they had become at the\npresent day.\n\n\"I'm really awfully sorry,\" he said; \"but they don't seem to have\nprovided any. I shall speak to the manager about it. And, unfortunately,\nI don't know where my own cigars are.\"\n\n\"It's of no consequence,\" said the Professor, with the sort of stoicism\nthat minds very much. \"I am a moderate smoker at best, and Turkish\ncoffee, though delicious, is apt to keep me awake. But if you could let\nme have a look at that brass bottle you got at poor Collingham's sale, I\nshould be obliged to you.\"\n\nHorace had no idea where it was then, nor could he, until the Professor\ncame to the rescue with a few words of Arabic, manage to make the slaves\ncomprehend what he wished them to find.\n\nAt length, however, two of them appeared, bearing the brass bottle with\nevery sign of awe, and depositing it at Ventimore's feet.\n\nProfessor Futvoye, after wiping and adjusting his glasses, proceeded to\nexamine the vessel. \"It certainly is a most unusual type of brassware,\"\nhe said, \"as unique in its way as the silver ewer and basin; and, as you\nthought, there does seem to be something resembling an inscription on\nthe cap, though in this dim light it is almost impossible to be sure.\"\n\nWhile he was poring over it, Horace seated himself on the divan by\nSylvia's side, hoping for one of the whispered conversations permitted\nto affianced lovers; he had pulled through the banquet somehow, and on\nthe whole he felt thankful things had not gone off worse. The noiseless\nand uncanny attendants, whom he did not know whether to regard as\nEfreets, or demons, or simply illusions, but whose services he had no\nwish to retain, had all withdrawn. Mrs. Futvoye was peacefully\nslumbering, and her husband was in a better humour than he had been all\nthe evening.\n\nSuddenly from behind the hangings of one of the archways came strange,\ndiscordant sounds, barbaric janglings and thumpings, varied by yowls as\nof impassioned cats.\n\nSylvia drew involuntarily closer to Horace; her mother woke with a\nstart, and the Professor looked up from the brass bottle with returning\nirritation.\n\n\"What's this? What's this?\" he demanded; \"some fresh surprise in store\nfor us?\"\n\nIt was quite as much of a surprise for Horace, but he was spared the\nhumiliation of owning it by the entrance of some half-dozen dusky\nmusicians swathed in white and carrying various strangely fashioned\ninstruments, with which they squatted down in a semi-circle by the\nopposite wall, and began to twang, and drub, and squall with the\ncomplacent cacophony of an Eastern orchestra. Clearly Fakrash was\ndetermined that nothing should be wanting to make the entertainment a\ncomplete success.\n\n\"What a very extraordinary noise!\" said Mrs. Futvoye; \"surely they can't\nmean it for music?\"\n\n\"Yes, they do,\" said Horace; \"it--it's really more harmonious than it\nsounds--you have to get accustomed to the--er--notation. When you do,\nit's rather soothing than otherwise.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" said the poor lady. \"And do _they_ come from the Stores,\ntoo?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Horace, with a fine assumption of candour, \"they don't; they\ncome from--the Arab Encampment at Earl's Court--parties and _fêtes_\nattended, you know. But they play _here_ for nothing; they--they want to\nget their name known, you see; very deserving and respectable set of\nfellows.\"\n\n\"My dear Horace!\" remarked Mrs. Futvoye, \"if they expect to get\nengagements for parties and so on, they really ought to try and learn a\ntune of _some_ sort.\"\n\n\"I understand, Horace,\" whispered Sylvia, \"it's very naughty of you to\nhave gone to all this trouble and expense (for, of course, it _has_ cost\nyou a lot) just to please us; but, whatever, dad may say, I love you all\nthe better for doing it!\"\n\nAnd her hand stole softly into his, and he felt that he could forgive\nFakrash everything, even--even the orchestra.\n\nBut there was something unpleasantly spectral about their shadowy forms,\nwhich showed in grotesquely baggy and bulgy shapes in the uncertain\nlight. Some of them wore immense and curious white head-dresses, which\ngave them the appearance of poulticed thumbs; and they all went on\nscraping and twiddling and caterwauling with a doleful monotony that\nHorace felt must be getting on his guests' nerves, as it certainly was\non his own.\n\nHe did not know how to get rid of them, but he sketched a kind of\ngesture in the air, intended to intimate that, while their efforts had\nafforded the keenest pleasure to the company generally, they were\nunwilling to monopolise them any longer, and the artists were at liberty\nto retire.\n\nPerhaps there is no art more liable to misconstruction than pantomime;\ncertainly, Ventimore's efforts in this direction were misunderstood, for\nthe music became wilder, louder, more aggressively and abominably out of\ntune--and then a worse thing happened.\n\nFor the curtains separated, and, heralded by sharp yelps from the\nperformers, a female figure floated into the hall and began to dance\nwith a slow and sinuous grace.\n\nHer beauty, though of a pronounced Oriental type, was unmistakable, even\nin the subdued light which fell on her; her diaphanous robe indicated a\nfaultless form; her dark tresses were braided with sequins; she had the\nlong, lustrous eyes, the dusky cheeks artificially whitened, and the\nfixed scarlet smile of the Eastern dancing-girl of all time.\n\nAnd she paced the floor with her tinkling feet, writhing and undulating\nlike some beautiful cobra, while the players worked themselves up to yet\nhigher and higher stages of frenzy.\n\nVentimore, as he sat there looking helplessly on, felt a return of his\nresentment against the Jinnee. It was really too bad of him; he ought,\nat his age, to have known better!\n\nNot that there was anything objectionable in the performance itself; but\nstill, it was _not_ the kind of entertainment for such an occasion.\nHorace wished now he had mentioned to Fakrash who the guests were whom\nhe expected, and then perhaps even the Jinnee would have exercised more\ntact in his arrangements.\n\n\"And does this girl come from Earl's Court?\" inquired Mrs. Futvoye, who\nwas now thoroughly awake.\n\n\"Oh dear, no,\" said Horace; \"I engaged _her_ at--at Harrod's--the\nEntertainment Bureau. They told me there she was rather good--struck out\na line of her own, don't you know. But perfectly correct; she--she only\ndoes this to support an invalid aunt.\"\n\nThese statements were, as he felt even in making them, not only\ngratuitous, but utterly unconvincing, but he had arrived at that\ncondition in which a man discovers with terror the unsuspected amount of\nmendacity latent in his system.\n\n\"I should have thought there were other ways of supporting invalid\naunts,\" remarked Mrs. Futvoye. \"What is this young lady's name?\"\n\n\"Tinkler,\" said Horace, on the spur of the moment. \"Miss Clementine\nTinkler.\"\n\n\"But surely she is a foreigner?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, I ought to have said. And Tinkla--with an 'a,' you know.\nI believe her mother was of Arabian extraction--but I really don't\nknow,\" explained Horace, conscious that Sylvia had withdrawn her hand\nfrom his, and was regarding him with covert anxiety.\n\n\"I really _must_ put a stop to this,\" he thought.\n\n\"You're getting bored by all this, darling,\" he said aloud; \"so am I.\nI'll tell them to go.\" And he rose and held out his hand as a sign that\nthe dance should cease.\n\nIt ceased at once; but, to his unspeakable horror, the dancer crossed\nthe floor with a swift jingling rush, and sank in a gauzy heap at his\nfeet, seizing his hand in both hers and covering it with kisses, while\nshe murmured speeches in some tongue unknown to him.\n\n\"Is this a usual feature in Miss Tinkla's entertainments, may I ask?\"\nsaid Mrs. Futvoye, bristling with not unnatural indignation.\n\n\"I really don't know,\" said the unhappy Horace; \"I can't make out what\nshe's saying.\"\n\n\"If I understand her rightly,\" said the Professor, \"she is addressing\nyou as the 'light of her eyes and the vital spirit of her heart.'\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Horace, \"she's quite mistaken, you know. It--it's the\nemotional artist temperament--they don't _mean_ anything by it. My--my\ndear young lady,\" he added, \"you've danced most delightfully, and I'm\nsure we're all most deeply indebted to you; but we won't detain you any\nlonger. Professor,\" he added, as she made no offer to rise, \"_will_ you\nkindly explain to them in Arabic that I should be obliged by their going\nat once?\"\n\nThe Professor said a few words, which had the desired effect. The girl\ngave a little scream and scudded through the archway, and the musicians\nseized their instruments and scuttled after her.\n\n\"I am so sorry,\" said Horace, whose evening seemed to him to have been\nchiefly spent in apologies; \"it's not at all the kind of entertainment\none would expect from a place like Whiteley's.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" agreed the Professor; \"but I understood you to say Miss\nTinkla was recommended to you by Harrod's?\"\n\n\"Very likely, sir,\" said Horace; \"but that doesn't affect the case. I\nshouldn't expect it from _them_.\"\n\n\"Probably they don't know how shamelessly that young person conducts\nherself,\" said Mrs. Futvoye. \"And I think it only right that they should\nbe told.\"\n\n\"I shall complain, of course,\" said Horace. \"I shall put it very\nstrongly.\"\n\n\"A protest would have more weight coming from a woman,\" said Mrs.\nFutvoye; \"and, as a shareholder in the company, I shall feel bound----\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't,\" said Horace; \"in fact, you mustn't. For, now I come to\nthink of it, she didn't come from Harrod's, after all, or Whiteley's\neither.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you will be good enough to inform us where she _did_ come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"I would if I knew,\" said Horace; \"but I don't.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the Professor, sharply, \"do you mean to say you can't\naccount for the existence of a dancing-girl who--in my daughter's\npresence--kisses your hand and addresses you by endearing epithets?\"\n\n\"Oriental metaphor!\" said Horace. \"She was a little overstrung. Of\ncourse, if I had had any idea she would make such a scene as that----\nSylvia,\" he broke off, \"_you_ don't doubt me?\"\n\n\"No, Horace,\" said Sylvia, simply, \"I'm sure you must have _some_\nexplanation--only I do think it would be better if you gave it.\"\n\n\"If I _told_ you the truth,\" said Horace, slowly, \"you would none of you\nbelieve me!\"\n\n\"Then you admit,\" put in the Professor, \"that hitherto you have _not_\nbeen telling the truth?\"\n\n\"Not as invariably as I could have wished,\" Horace confessed.\n\n\"So I suspected. Then, unless you can bring yourself to be perfectly\ncandid, you can hardly wonder at our asking you to consider your\nengagement as broken off?\"\n\n\"Broken off!\" echoed Horace. \"Sylvia, you won't give me up! You _know_ I\nwouldn't do anything unworthy of you!\"\n\n\"I'm certain that you can't have done anything which would make me love\nyou one bit the less if I knew it. So why not be quite open with us?\"\n\n\"Because, darling,\" said Horace, \"I'm in such a fix that it would only\nmake matters worse.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the Professor, \"and as it is already rather late,\nperhaps you will allow one of your numerous retinue to call a\nfour-wheeler?\"\n\nHorace clapped his hands, but no one answered the summons, and he could\nnot find any of the slaves in the antechamber.\n\n\"I'm afraid all the servants have left,\" he explained; and it is to be\nfeared he would have added that they were all obliged to return to the\ncontractor by eleven, only he caught the Professor's eye and decided\nthat he had better refrain. \"If you will wait here, I'll go out and\nfetch a cab,\" he added.\n\n\"There is no occasion to trouble you,\" said the Professor; \"my wife and\ndaughter have already got their things on, and we will walk until we\nfind a cab. Now, Mr. Ventimore, we will bid you good-night and good-bye.\nFor, after what has happened, you will, I trust, have the good taste to\ndiscontinue your visits and make no attempt to see Sylvia again.\"\n\n\"Upon my honour,\" protested Horace, \"I have done nothing to warrant you\nin shutting your doors against me.\"\n\n\"I am unable to agree with you. I have never thoroughly approved of your\nengagement, because, as I told you at the time, I suspected you of\nrecklessness in money matters. Even in accepting your invitation\nto-night I warned you, as you may remember, not to make the occasion an\nexcuse for foolish extravagance. I come here, and find you in apartments\nfurnished and decorated (as you informed us) by yourself, and on a scale\nwhich would be prodigal in a millionaire. You have a suite of retainers\nwhich (except for their nationality and imperfect discipline) a prince\nmight envy. You provide a banquet of--hem!--delicacies which must have\ncost you infinite trouble and unlimited expense--this, after I had\nexpressly stipulated for a quiet family dinner! Not content with that,\nyou procure for our diversion Arab music and dancing of a--of a highly\nrecondite character. I should be unworthy of the name of father, sir,\nif I were to entrust my only daughter's happiness to a young man with so\nlittle common sense, so little self-restraint. And she will understand\nmy motives and obey my wishes.\"\n\n\"You're right, Professor, according to your lights,\" admitted Horace.\n\"And yet--confound it all!--you're utterly wrong, too!\"\n\n\"Oh, Horace,\" cried Sylvia; \"if you had only listened to dad, and not\ngone to all this foolish, foolish expense, we might have been so happy!\"\n\n\"But I have gone to no expense. All this hasn't cost me a penny!\"\n\n\"Ah, there _is_ some mystery! Horace, if you love me, you will\nexplain--here, now, before it's too late!\"\n\n\"My darling,\" groaned Horace, \"I would, like a shot, if I thought it\nwould be of the least use!\"\n\n\"Hitherto,\" said the Professor, \"you cannot be said to have been happy\nin your explanations--and I should advise you not to venture on any\nmore. Good-night, once more. I only wish it were possible, without\nneedless irony, to make the customary acknowledgments for a pleasant\nevening.\"\n\nMrs. Futvoye had already hurried her daughter away, and, though she had\nleft her husband to express his sentiments unaided, she made it\nsufficiently clear that she entirely agreed with them.\n\nHorace stood in the outer hall by the fountain, in which his drowned\nchrysanthemums were still floating, and gazed in stupefied despair after\nhis guests as they went down the path to the gate. He knew only too well\nthat they would never cross his threshold, nor he theirs, again.\n\nSuddenly he came to himself with a start. \"I'll try it!\" he cried. \"I\ncan't and won't stand this!\" And he rushed after them bareheaded.\n\n\"Professor!\" he said breathlessly, as he caught him up, \"one moment. On\nsecond thoughts, I _will_ tell you my secret, if you will promise me a\npatient hearing.\"\n\n\"The pavement is hardly the place for confidences,\" replied the\nProfessor, \"and, if it were, your costume is calculated to attract more\nremark than is desirable. My wife and daughter have gone on--if you will\npermit me, I will overtake them--I shall be at home to-morrow morning,\nshould you wish to see me.\"\n\n\"No--to-night, to-night!\" urged Horace. \"I can't sleep in that infernal\nplace with this on my mind. Put Mrs. Futvoye and Sylvia into a cab,\nProfessor, and come back. It's not late, and I won't keep you long--but\nfor Heaven's sake, let me tell you my story at once.\"\n\nProbably the Professor was not without some curiosity on the subject; at\nall events he yielded. \"Very well,\" he said, \"go into the house and I\nwill rejoin you presently. Only remember,\" he added, \"that I shall\naccept no statement without the fullest proof. Otherwise you will merely\nbe wasting your time and mine.\"\n\n\"Proof!\" thought Horace, gloomily, as he returned to his Arabian halls,\n\"The only decent proof I could produce would be old Fakrash, and he's\nnot likely to turn up again--especially now I want him.\"\n\nA little later the Professor returned, having found a cab and despatched\nhis women-folk home. \"Now, young man,\" he said, as he unwound his\nwrapper and seated himself on the divan by Horace's side, \"I can give\nyou just ten minutes to tell your story in, so let me beg you to make it\nas brief and as comprehensible as you can.\"\n\nIt was not exactly an encouraging invitation in the circumstances, but\nHorace took his courage in both hands and told him everything, just as\nit had happened.\n\n\"And that's your story?\" said the Professor, after listening to the\nnarrative with the utmost attention, when Horace came to the end.\n\n\"That's my story, sir,\" said Horace. \"And I hope it has altered your\nopinion of me.\"\n\n\"It has,\" replied the Professor, in an altered tone; \"it has indeed.\nYours is a sad case--a very sad case.\"\n\n\"It's rather awkward, isn't it? But I don't mind so long as you\nunderstand. And you'll tell Sylvia--as much as you think proper?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes; I must tell Sylvia.\"\n\n\"And I may go on seeing her as usual?\"\n\n\"Well--will you be guided by my advice--the advice of one who has lived\nmore than double your years?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Horace.\n\n\"Then, if I were you, I should go away at once, for a complete change of\nair and scene.\"\n\n\"That's impossible, sir--you forget my work!\"\n\n\"Never mind your work, my boy: leave it for a while, try a sea-voyage,\ngo round the world, get quite away from these associations.\"\n\n\"But I might come across the Jinnee again,\" objected Horace; \"_he's_\ntravelling, as I told you.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, to be sure. Still, I should go away. Consult any doctor, and\nhe'll tell you the same thing.\"\n\n\"Consult any---- Good God!\" cried Horace; \"I see what it is--you think\nI'm mad!\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear boy,\" said the Professor, soothingly, \"not mad--nothing\nof the sort; perhaps your mental equilibrium is just a trifle--it's\nquite intelligible. You see, the sudden turn in your professional\nprospects, coupled with your engagement to Sylvia--I've known stronger\nminds than yours thrown off their balance--temporarily, of course, quite\ntemporarily--by less than that.\"\n\n\"You believe I am suffering from delusions?\"\n\n\"I don't say that. I think you may see ordinary things in a distorted\nlight.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, you don't believe there really was a Jinnee inside that\nbottle?\"\n\n\"Remember, you yourself assured me at the time you opened it that you\nfound nothing whatever inside it. Isn't it more credible that you were\nright then than that you should be right now?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, \"you saw all those black slaves; you ate, or tried\nto eat, that unutterably beastly banquet; you heard that music--and then\nthere was the dancing-girl. And this hall we're in, this robe I've got\non--are _they_ delusions? Because if they are, I'm afraid you will have\nto admit that _you're_ mad too.\"\n\n\"Ingeniously put,\" said the Professor. \"I fear it is unwise to argue\nwith you. Still, I will venture to assert that a strong imagination like\nyours, over-heated and saturated with Oriental ideas--to which I fear I\nmay have contributed--is not incapable of unconsciously assisting in its\nown deception. In other words, I think that you may have provided all\nthis yourself from various quarters without any clear recollection of\nthe fact.\"\n\n\"That's very scientific and satisfactory as far as it goes, my dear\nProfessor,\" said Horace; \"but there's one piece of evidence which may\nupset your theory--and that's this brass bottle.\"\n\n\"If your reasoning powers were in their normal condition,\" said the\nProfessor, compassionately, \"you would see that the mere production of\nan empty bottle can be no proof of what it contained--or, for that\nmatter, that it ever contained anything at all!\"\n\n\"Oh, I see _that_,\" said Horace; \"but _this_ bottle has a stopper with\nwhat you yourself admit to be an inscription of some sort. Suppose that\ninscription confirms my story--what then? All I ask you to do is to make\nit out for yourself before you decide that I'm either a liar or a\nlunatic.\"\n\n\"I warn you,\" said the Professor, \"that if you are trusting to my being\nunable to decipher the inscription, you are deceiving yourself. You\nrepresent that this bottle belongs to the period of Solomon--that is,\nabout a thousand years B.C. Probably you are not aware that the earliest\nspecimens of Oriental metal-work in existence are not older than the\ntenth century of our era. But, granting that it is as old as you allege,\nI shall certainly be able to read any inscription there may be on it. I\nhave made out clay tablets in Cuneiform which were certainly written a\nthousand years before Solomon's time.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Horace. \"I'm as certain as I can be that,\nwhatever is written on that lid--whether it's Phoenician, or Cuneiform,\nor anything else--must have some reference to a Jinnee confined in the\nbottle, or at least bear the seal of Solomon. But there the thing\nis--examine it for yourself.\"\n\n\"Not now,\" said the Professor; \"it's too late, and the light here is not\nstrong enough. But I'll tell you what I will do. I'll take this stopper\nthing home with me, and examine it carefully to-morrow--on one\ncondition.\"\n\n\"You have only to name it,\" said Horace.\n\n\"My condition is, that if I, and one or two other Orientalists to whom I\nmay submit it, come to the conclusion that there is no real inscription\nat all--or, if any, that a date and meaning must be assigned to it\ntotally inconsistent with your story--you will accept our finding and\nacknowledge that you have been under a delusion, and dismiss the whole\naffair from your mind.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind agreeing to _that_,\" said Horace, \"particularly as\nit's my only chance.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said the Professor, as he removed the metal cap and\nput it in his pocket; \"you may depend upon hearing from me in a day or\ntwo. Meantime, my boy,\" he continued, almost affectionately, \"why not\ntry a short bicycle tour somewhere, hey? You're a cyclist, I\nknow--anything but allow yourself to dwell on Oriental subjects.\"\n\n\"It's not so easy to avoid dwelling on them as you think!\" said Horace,\nwith rather a dreary laugh. \"And I fancy, Professor, that--whether you\nlike it or not--you'll have to believe in that Jinnee of mine sooner or\nlater.\"\n\n\"I can scarcely conceive,\" replied the Professor, who was by this time\nat the outer door, \"any degree of evidence which could succeed in\nconvincing me that your brass bottle had ever contained an Arabian\nJinnee. However, I shall endeavour to preserve an open mind on the\nsubject. Good evening to you.\"\n\nAs soon as he was alone, Horace paced up and down his deserted halls in\na state of simmering rage as he thought how eagerly he had looked\nforward to his little dinner-party; how intimate and delightful it might\nhave been, and what a monstrous and prolonged nightmare it had actually\nproved. And at the end of it there he was--in a fantastic, impossible\ndwelling, deserted by every one, his chances of setting himself right\nwith Sylvia hanging on the slenderest thread; unknown difficulties and\ncomplications threatening him from every side!\n\nHe owed all this to Fakrash. Yes, that incorrigibly grateful Jinnee,\nwith his antiquated notions and his high-flown professions, had\ncontrived to ruin him more disastrously than if he had been his\nbitterest foe! Ah! if he could be face to face with him once more--if\nonly for five minutes--he would be restrained by no false delicacy: he\nwould tell him fairly and plainly what a meddling, blundering old fool\nhe was. But Fakrash had taken his flight for ever: there were no means\nof calling him back--nothing to be done now but go to bed and sleep--if\nhe could!\n\nExasperated by the sense of his utter helplessness, Ventimore went to\nthe arch which led to his bed-chamber and drew the curtain back with a\nfurious pull. And just within the archway, standing erect with folded\narms and the smile of fatuous benignity which Ventimore was beginning to\nknow and dread, was the form of Fakrash-el-Aamash, the Jinnee!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. NO PLACE LIKE HOME!\n\n\n\"May thy head long survive!\" said Fakrash, by way of salutation, as he\nstepped through the archway.\n\n\"You're very good,\" said Horace, whose anger had almost evaporated in\nthe relief of the Jinnee's unexpected return, \"but I don't think any\nhead can survive this sort of thing long.\"\n\n\"Art thou content with this dwelling I have provided for thee?\" inquired\nthe Jinnee, glancing around the stately hall with perceptible\ncomplacency.\n\nIt would have been positively brutal to say how very far from contented\nhe felt, so Horace could only mumble that he had never been lodged like\nthat before in all his life.\n\n\"It is far below thy deserts,\" Fakrash observed graciously. \"And were\nthy friends amazed at the manner of their entertainment?\"\n\n\"They were,\" said Horace.\n\n\"A sure method of preserving friends is to feast them with liberality,\"\nremarked the Jinnee.\n\nThis was rather more than Horace's temper could stand. \"You were kind\nenough to provide my friends with such a feast,\" he said, \"that they'll\nnever come _here_ again.\"\n\n\"How so? Were not the meats choice and abounding in fatness? Was not the\nwine sweet, and the sherbet like unto perfumed snow?\"\n\n\"Oh, everything was--er--as nice as possible,\" said Horace. \"Couldn't\nhave been better.\"\n\n\"Yet thou sayest that thy friends will return no more--for what reason?\"\n\n\"Well, you see,\" explained Horace, reluctantly, \"there's such a thing\nas doing people _too_ well. I mean, it isn't everybody that appreciates\nArabian cooking. But they might have stood that. It was the dancing-girl\nthat did for me.\"\n\n\"I commanded that a houri, lovelier than the full moon, and graceful as\na young gazelle, should appear for the delight of thy guests.\"\n\n\"She came,\" said Horace, gloomily.\n\n\"Acquaint me with that which hath occurred--for I perceive plainly that\nsomething hath fallen out contrary to thy desires.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, \"if it had been a bachelor party, there would have\nbeen no harm in the houri; but, as it happened, two of my guests were\nladies, and they--well, they not unnaturally put a wrong construction on\nit all.\"\n\n\"Verily,\" exclaimed the Jinnee, \"thy words are totally incomprehensible\nto me.\"\n\n\"I don't know what the custom may be in Arabia,\" said Horace, \"but with\nus it is not usual for a man to engage a houri to dance after dinner to\namuse the lady he is proposing to marry. It's the kind of attention\nshe'd be most unlikely to appreciate.\n\n\"Then was one of thy guests the damsel whom thou art seeking to marry?\"\n\n\"She was,\" said Horace, \"and the other two were her father and mother.\nFrom which you may imagine that it was not altogether agreeable for me\nwhen your gazelle threw herself at my feet and hugged my knees and\ndeclared that I was the light of her eyes. Of course, it all meant\nnothing--it's probably the conventional behaviour for a gazelle, and I'm\nnot reflecting upon her in the least. But, in the circumstances, it\n_was_ compromising.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" said Fakrash, \"that thou assuredst me that thou wast not\ncontracted to any damsel?\"\n\n\"I think I only said that there was no one whom I would trouble you to\nprocure as a wife for me,\" replied Horace; \"I certainly was\nengaged--though, after this evening, my engagement is at an end--unless\n... that reminds me, do you happen to know whether there really _was_ an\ninscription on the seal of your bottle, and what it said?\"\n\n\"I know naught of any inscription,\" said the Jinnee; \"bring me the seal\nthat I may see it.\"\n\n\"I haven't got it by me at this moment,\" said Horace; \"I lent it to my\nfriend--the father of this young lady I told you of. You see, Mr.\nFakrash, you got me into--I mean, I was in such a hole over this affair\nthat I was obliged to make a clean breast of it to him. And he wouldn't\nbelieve it, so it struck me that there might be an inscription of some\nsort on the seal, saying who you were, and why Solomon had you confined\nin the bottle. Then the Professor would be obliged to admit that there's\nsomething in my story.\"\n\n\"Truly, I wonder at thee and at the smallness of thy penetration,\" the\nJinnee commented; \"for if there were indeed any writing upon this seal,\nit is not possible that one of thy race should be able to decipher it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" said Horace; \"Professor Futvoye is an Oriental\nscholar; he can make out any inscription, no matter how many thousands\nof years old it may be. If anything's there, he'll decipher it. The\nquestion is whether anything _is_ there.\"\n\nThe effect of this speech on Fakrash was as unexpected as it was\ninexplicable: the Jinnee's features, usually so mild, began to work\nconvulsively until they became terrible to look at, and suddenly, with a\nfierce howl, he shot up to nearly double his ordinary stature.\n\n\"O thou of little sense and breeding!\" he cried, in a loud voice; \"how\ncamest thou to deliver the bottle in which I was confined into the hands\nof this learned man?\"\n\nVentimore, startled as he was, did not lose his self-possession. \"My\ndear sir,\" he said, \"I did not suppose you could have any further use\nfor it. And, as a matter of fact, I didn't give Professor Futvoye the\nbottle--which is over there in the corner--but merely the stopper. I\nwish you wouldn't tower over me like that--it gives me a crick in the\nneck to talk to you. Why on earth should you make such a fuss about my\nlending the seal; what possible difference can it make to you even if it\ndoes confirm my story? And it's of immense importance to _me_ that the\nProfessor should believe I told the truth.\"\n\n\"I spoke in haste,\" said the Jinnee, slowly resuming his normal size,\nand looking slightly ashamed of his recent outburst as well as\nuncommonly foolish. \"The bottle truly is of no value; and as for the\nstopper, since it is but lent, it is no great matter. If there be any\nlegend upon the seal, perchance this learned man of whom thou speakest\nwill by this time have deciphered it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Horace, \"he won't tackle it till to-morrow. And it's as\nlikely as not that when he does he won't find any reference to\n_you_--and I shall be up a taller tree than ever!\"\n\n\"Art thou so desirous that he should receive proof that thy story is\ntrue?\"\n\n\"Why, of course I am! Haven't I been saying so all this time?\"\n\n\"Who can satisfy him so surely as I?\"\n\n\"You!\" cried Horace. \"Do you mean to say you really would? Mr. Fakrash,\nyou _are_ an old brick! That would be the very thing!\"\n\n\"There is naught,\" said the Jinnee, smiling indulgently, \"that I would\nnot do to promote thy welfare, for thou hast rendered me inestimable\nservice. Acquaint me therefore with the abode of this sage, and I will\npresent myself before him, and if haply he should find no inscription\nupon the seal, or its purport should be hidden from him, then will I\nconvince him that thou hast spoken the truth and no lie.\"\n\nHorace very willingly gave him the Professor's address. \"Only don't\ndrop in on him to-night, you know,\" he thought it prudent to add, \"or\nyou might startle him. Call any time after breakfast to-morrow, and\nyou'll find him in.\"\n\n\"To-night,\" said Fakrash, \"I return to pursue my search after Suleyman\n(on whom be peace!). For not yet have I found him.\"\n\n\"If you _will_ try to do so many things at once,\" said Horace, \"I don't\nsee how you can expect much result.\"\n\n\"At Nineveh they knew him not--for where I left a city I found but a\nheap of ruins, tenanted by owls and bats.\"\n\n\"_They say the lion and the lizard keep the Courts_----\" murmured\nHorace, half to himself. \"I was afraid you might be disappointed with\nNineveh myself. Why not run over to Sheba? You might hear of him there.\"\n\n\"Seba of El-Yemen--the country of Bilkees, the Queen beloved of\nSuleyman,\" said the Jinnee. \"It is an excellent suggestion, and I will\nfollow it without delay.\"\n\n\"But you won't forget to look in on Professor Futvoye to-morrow, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Assuredly I will not. And now, ere I depart, tell me if there be any\nother service I may render thee.\"\n\nHorace hesitated. \"There _is_ just one,\" he said, \"only I'm afraid\nyou'll be offended if I mention it.\"\n\n\"On the head and the eye be thy commands!\" said the Jinnee; \"for\nwhatsoever thou desirest shall be accomplished, provided that it lie\nwithin my power to perform it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, \"if you're sure you don't mind, I'll tell you.\nYou've transformed this house into a wonderful place, more like the\nAlhambra--I don't mean the one in Leicester Square--than a London\nlodging-house. But then I am only a lodger here, and the people the\nhouse belongs to--excellent people in their way--would very much rather\nhave the house as it was. They have a sort of idea that they won't be\nable to let these rooms as easily as the others.\"\n\n\"Base and sordid dogs!\" said the Jinnee, with contempt.\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Horace, \"it's narrow-minded of them--but that's the way\nthey look at it. They've actually left rather than stay here. And it's\n_their_ house--not mine.\"\n\n\"If they abandon this dwelling, thou wilt remain in the more secure\npossession.\"\n\n\"Oh, _shall_ I, though? They'll go to law and have me turned out, and I\nshall have to pay ruinous damages into the bargain. So, you see, what\nyou intended as a kindness will only bring me bad luck.\"\n\n\"Come--without more words--to the statement of thy request,\" said\nFakrash, \"for I am in haste.\"\n\n\"All I want you to do,\" replied Horace, in some anxiety as to what the\neffect of his request would be, \"is to put everything here back to what\nit was before. It won't take you a minute.\"\n\n\"Of a truth,\" exclaimed Fakrash, \"to bestow a favour upon thee is but a\nthankless undertaking, for not once, but twice, hast thou rejected my\nbenefits--and now, behold, I am at a loss to devise means to gratify\nthee!\"\n\n\"I know I've abused your good nature,\" said Horace; \"but if you'll only\ndo this, and then convince the Professor that my story is true, I shall\nbe more than satisfied. I'll never ask another favour of you!\"\n\n\"My benevolence towards thee hath no bounds--as thou shalt see; and I\ncan deny thee nothing, for truly thou art a worthy and temperate young\nman. Farewell, then, and be it according to thy desire.\"\n\nHe raised his arms above his head, and shot up like a rocket towards the\nlofty dome, which split asunder to let him pass. Horace, as he gazed\nafter him, had a momentary glimpse of deep blue sky, with a star or two\nthat seemed to be hurrying through the transparent opal scud, before\nthe roof closed in once more.\n\nThen came a low, rumbling sound, with a shock like a mild earthquake:\nthe slender pillars swayed under their horseshoe arches; the big\nhanging-lanterns went out; the walls narrowed, and the floor heaved and\nrose--till Ventimore found himself up in his own familiar sitting-room\nonce more, in the dark. Outside he could see the great square still\nshrouded in grey haze--the street lamps flickering in the wind; a\nbelated reveller was beguiling his homeward way by rattling his stick\nagainst the railings as he passed.\n\nInside the room everything was exactly as before, and Horace found it\ndifficult to believe that a few minutes earlier he had been standing on\nthat same site, but twenty feet or so below his present level, in a\nspacious blue-tiled hall, with a domed ceiling and gaudy pillared\narches.\n\nBut he was very far from regretting his short-lived splendour; he burnt\nwith shame and resentment whenever he thought of that nightmare banquet,\nwhich was so unlike the quiet, unpretentious little dinner he had looked\nforward to.\n\nHowever, it was over now, and it was useless to worry himself about what\ncould not be helped. Besides, fortunately, there was no great harm done;\nthe Jinnee had been brought to see his mistake, and, to do him justice,\nhad shown himself willing enough to put it right. He had promised to go\nand see the Professor next day, and the result of the interview could\nnot fail to be satisfactory. And after this, Ventimore thought, Fakrash\nwould have the sense and good feeling not to interfere in his affairs\nagain.\n\nMeanwhile he could sleep now with a mind free from his worst anxieties,\nand he went to his room in a spirit of intense thankfulness that he had\na Christian bed to sleep in. He took off his gorgeous robes--the only\nthings that remained to prove to him that the events of that evening had\nbeen no delusion--and locked them in his wardrobe with a sense of\nrelief that he would never be required to wear them again, and his last\nconscious thought before he fell asleep was the comforting reflection\nthat, if there were any barrier between Sylvia and himself, it would be\nremoved in the course of a very few more hours.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. A FOOL'S PARADISE\n\n\nVentimore found next morning that his bath and shaving-water had been\nbrought up, from which he inferred, quite correctly, that his landlady\nmust have returned.\n\nSecretly he was by no means looking forward to his next interview with\nher, but she appeared with his bacon and coffee in a spirit so evidently\nchastened that he saw that he would have no difficulty so far as she was\nconcerned.\n\n\"I'm sure, Mr. Ventimore, sir,\" she began, apologetically, \"I don't know\nwhat you must have thought of me and Rapkin last night, leaving the\nhouse like we did!\"\n\n\"It was extremely inconvenient,\" said Horace, \"and not at all what I\nshould have expected from you. But possibly you had some reason for it?\"\n\n\"Why, sir,\" said Mrs. Rapkin, running her hand nervously along the back\nof a chair, \"the fact is, something come over me, and come over Rapkin,\nas we couldn't stop here another minute not if it was ever so.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Horace, raising his eyebrows, \"restlessness--eh, Mrs. Rapkin?\nAwkward that it should come on just then, though, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"It was the look of the place, somehow,\" said Mrs. Rapkin. \"If you'll\nbelieve me, sir, it was all changed like--nothing in it the same from\ntop to bottom!\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Horace. \"I don't notice any difference myself.\"\n\n\"No more don't I, sir, not by daylight; but last night it was all domes\nand harches and marble fountings let into the floor, with parties\nmoving about downstairs all silent and as black as your hat--which\nRapkin saw them as well as what I did.\"\n\n\"From the state your husband was in last night,\" said Horace, \"I should\nsay he was capable of seeing anything--and double of most things.\"\n\n\"I won't deny, sir, that Rapkin mayn't have been quite hisself, as a\nvery little upsets him after he's spent an afternoon studying the papers\nand what-not at the libery. But I see the niggers too, Mr. Ventimore,\nand no one can say _I_ ever take more than is good for me.\"\n\n\"I don't suggest that for a moment, Mrs. Rapkin,\" said Horace; \"only, if\nthe house was as you describe last night, how do you account for its\nbeing all right this morning?\"\n\nMrs. Rapkin in her embarrassment was reduced to folding her apron into\nsmall pleats. \"It's not for me to say, sir,\" she replied, \"but, if I was\nto give my opinion, it would be as them parties as called 'ere on camels\nthe other day was at the bottom of it.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if you were right, Mrs. Rapkin,\" said Horace\nblandly; \"you see, you had been exerting yourself over the cooking, and\nno doubt were in an over-excited state, and, as you say, those camels\nhad taken hold of your imagination until you were ready to see anything\nthat Rapkin saw, and _he_ was ready to see anything _you_ did. It's not\nat all uncommon. Scientific people, I believe, call it 'Collective\nHallucination.'\"\n\n\"Law, sir!\" said the good woman, considerably impressed by this\ndiagnosis, \"you don't mean to say I had _that_? I was always fanciful\nfrom a girl, and could see things in coffee-grounds as nobody else\ncould--but I never was took like that before. And to think of me leaving\nmy dinner half cooked, and you expecting your young lady and her pa and\nma! Well, _there_, now, I _am_ sorry. Whatever did you do, sir?\"\n\n\"We managed to get food of sorts from somewhere,\" said Horace, \"but it\nwas most uncomfortable for me, and I trust, Mrs. Rapkin--I sincerely\ntrust that it will not occur again.\"\n\n\"That I'll answer for it shan't, sir. And you won't take no notice to\nRapkin, sir, will you? Though it was his seein' the niggers and that as\nput it into my 'ed; but I 'ave spoke to him pretty severe already, and\nhe's truly sorry and ashamed for forgetting hisself as he did.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mrs. Rapkin,\" said Horace; \"we will understand that last\nnight's--hem--rather painful experience is not to be alluded to\nagain--on either side.\"\n\nHe felt sincerely thankful to have got out of it so easily, for it was\nimpossible to say what gossip might not have been set on foot if the\nRapkins had not been brought to see the advisability of reticence on the\nsubject.\n\n\"There's one more thing, sir, I wished for to speak to you about,\" said\nMrs. Rapkin; \"that great brass vawse as you bought at an oction some\ntime back. I dunno if you remember it?\"\n\n\"I remember it,\" said Horace. \"Well, what about it?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, I found it in the coal-cellar this morning, and I thought I'd\nask if that was where you wished it kep' in future. For, though no\namount o' polish could make it what I call a tasty thing, it's neither\nhorniment nor yet useful where it is at present.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Horace, rather relieved, for he had an ill-defined dread from\nher opening words that the bottle might have been misbehaving itself in\nsome way. \"Put it wherever you please, Mrs. Rapkin; do whatever you like\nwith it--so long as I don't see the thing again!\"\n\n\"Very good, sir; I on'y thought I'd ask the question,\" said Mrs. Rapkin,\nas she closed the door upon herself.\n\nAltogether, Horace walked to Great Cloister Street that morning in a\nfairly cheerful mood and amiably disposed, even towards the Jinnee. With\nall his many faults, he was a thoroughly good-natured old devil--very\nsuperior in every way to the one the Arabian Nights fisherman found in\n_his_ bottle.\n\n\"Ninety-nine Jinn out of a hundred,\" thought Horace, \"would have turned\nnasty on finding benefit after benefit 'declined with thanks.' But one\ngood point in Fakrash is that he _does_ take a hint in good part, and,\nas soon as he can be made to see where he's wrong, he's always ready to\nset things right. And he thoroughly understands now that these Oriental\ndodges of his won't do nowadays, and that when people see a penniless\nman suddenly wallowing in riches they naturally want to know how he came\nby them. I don't suppose he will trouble me much in future. If he should\nlook in now and then, I must put up with it. Perhaps, if I suggested it,\nhe wouldn't mind coming in some form that would look less outlandish. If\nhe would get himself up as a banker, or a bishop--the Bishop of Bagdad,\nsay--I shouldn't care how often he called. Only, I can't have him coming\ndown the chimney in either capacity. But he'll see that himself. And\nhe's done me one real service--I mustn't let myself forget that. He sent\nme old Wackerbath. By the way, I wonder if he's seen my designs yet, and\nwhat he thinks of them.\"\n\nHe was at his table, engaged in jotting down some rough ideas for the\ndecoration of the reception-rooms in the projected house, when Beevor\ncame in.\n\n\"I've got nothing doing just now,\" he said; \"so I thought I'd come in\nand have a squint at those plans of yours, if they're forward enough to\nbe seen yet.\"\n\nVentimore had to explain that even the imperfect method of examination\nproposed was not possible, as he had despatched the drawings to his\nclient the night before.\n\n\"Phew!\" said Beevor; \"that's sharp work, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I've been sticking hard at it for over a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Well, you might have given me a chance of seeing what you've made of\nit. I let you see all _my_ work!\"\n\n\"To tell you the honest truth, old fellow, I wasn't at all sure you'd\nlike it, and I was afraid you'd put me out of conceit with what I'd\ndone, and Wackerbath was in a frantic hurry to have the plans--so there\nit was.\"\n\n\"And do you think he'll be satisfied with them?\"\n\n\"He ought to be. I don't like to be cock-sure, but I believe--I really\ndo believe--that I've given him rather more than he expected. It's going\nto be a devilish good house, though I say it myself.\"\n\n\"Something new-fangled and fantastic, eh? Well, he mayn't care about it,\nyou know. When you've had my experience, you'll realise that a client is\na rum bird to satisfy.\"\n\n\"I shall satisfy _my_ old bird,\" said Horace, gaily. \"He'll have a cage\nhe can hop about in to his heart's content.\"\n\n\"You're a clever chap enough,\" said Beevor; \"but to carry a big job like\nthis through you want one thing--and that's ballast.\"\n\n\"Not while you heave yours at my head! Come, old fellow, you aren't\nreally riled because I sent off those plans without showing them to you?\nI shall soon have them back, and then you can pitch into 'em as much as\nyou please. Seriously, though, I shall want all the help you can spare\nwhen I come to the completed designs.\"\n\n\"'Um,\" said Beevor, \"you've got along very well alone so far--at least,\nby your own account; so I dare say you'll be able to manage without me\nto the end. Only, you know,\" he added, as he left the room, \"you haven't\nwon your spurs yet. A fellow isn't necessarily a Gilbert Scott, or a\nNorman Shaw, or a Waterhouse just because he happens to get a\nsixty-thousand pound job the first go off!\"\n\n\"Poor old Beevor!\" thought Horace, repentantly, \"I've put his back up.\nI might just as well have shown him the plans, after all; it wouldn't\nhave hurt me and it would have pleased _him_. Never mind, I'll make my\npeace with him after lunch. I'll ask him to give me his idea for a--no,\nhang it all, even friendship has its limits!\"\n\nHe returned from lunch to hear what sounded like an altercation of some\nsort in his office, in which, as he neared his door, Beevor's voice was\ndistinctly audible.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" he was saying, \"I have already told you that it is no\naffair of mine.\"\n\n\"But I ask you, sir, as a brother architect,\" said another voice,\n\"whether you consider it professional or reasonable----?\"\n\n\"As a brother architect,\" replied Beevor, as Ventimore opened the door,\n\"I would rather be excused from giving an opinion.... Ah, here is Mr.\nVentimore himself.\"\n\nHorace entered, to find himself confronted by Mr. Wackerbath, whose face\nwas purple and whose white whiskers were bristling with rage. \"So, sir!\"\nhe began. \"So, sir!----\" and choked ignominiously.\n\n\"There appears to have been some misunderstanding, my dear Ventimore,\"\nexplained Beevor, with a studious correctness which was only a shade\nless offensive than open triumph. \"I think I'd better leave you and this\ngentleman to talk it over quietly.\"\n\n\"Quietly?\" exclaimed Mr. Wackerbath, with an apoplectic snort;\n\"_quietly!!_\"\n\n\"I've no idea what you are so excited about, sir,\" said Horace. \"Perhaps\nyou will explain?\"\n\n\"Explain!\" Mr. Wackerbath gasped; \"why--no, if I speak just now, I shall\nbe ill: _you_ tell him,\" he added, waving a plump hand in Beevor's\ndirection.\n\n\"I'm not in possession of all the facts,\" said Beevor, smoothly; \"but,\nso far as I can gather, this gentleman thinks that, considering the\nimportance of the work he intrusted to your hands, you have given less\ntime to it than he might have expected. As I have told him, that is a\nmatter which does not concern me, and which he must discuss with you.\"\n\nSo saying, Beevor retired to his own room, and shut the door with the\nsame irreproachable discretion, which conveyed that he was not in the\nleast surprised, but was too much of a gentleman to show it.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Wackerbath,\" began Horace, when they were alone, \"so you're\ndisappointed with the house?\"\n\n\"Disappointed!\" said Mr. Wackerbath, furiously. \"I am disgusted, sir,\ndisgusted!\"\n\nHorace's heart sank lower still; had he deceived himself after all,\nthen? Had he been nothing but a conceited fool, and--most galling\nthought of all--had Beevor judged him only too accurately? And yet, no,\nhe could not believe it--he _knew_ his work was good!\n\n\"This is plain speaking with a vengeance,\" he said; \"I'm sorry you're\ndissatisfied. I did my best to carry out your instructions.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did?\" sputtered Mr. Wackerbath. \"That's what you call--but go\non, sir, _go_ on!\"\n\n\"I got it done as quickly as possible,\" continued Horace, \"because I\nunderstood you wished no time to be lost.\"\n\n\"No one can accuse you of dawdling over it. What I should like to know\nis how the devil you managed to get it done in the time?\"\n\n\"I worked incessantly all day and every day,\" said Horace. \"That's how I\nmanaged it--and this is all the thanks I get for it!\"\n\n\"Thanks?\" Mr. Wackerbath well-nigh howled. \"You--you insolent young\ncharlatan; you expect thanks!\"\n\n\"Now look here, Mr. Wackerbath,\" said Horace, whose own temper was\ngetting a little frayed. \"I'm not accustomed to being treated like this,\nand I don't intend to submit to it. Just tell me--in as moderate\nlanguage as you can command--what you object to?\"\n\n\"I object to the whole damned thing, sir! I mean, I repudiate the entire\nconcern. It's the work of a raving lunatic--a place that no English\ngentleman, sir, with any self-respect or--ah!--consideration for his\nreputation and position in the county, could consent to occupy for a\nsingle hour!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Horace, feeling deathly sick, \"in that case it is useless, of\ncourse, to suggest any modifications.\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\" said Mr. Wackerbath.\n\n\"Very well, then; there's no more to be said,\" replied Horace. \"You will\nhave no difficulty in finding an architect who will be more successful\nin realising your intentions. Mr. Beevor, the gentleman you met just\nnow,\" he added, with a touch of bitterness, \"would probably be just your\nman. Of course I retire altogether. And really, if any one is the\nsufferer over this, I fancy it's myself. I can't see how you are any the\nworse.\"\n\n\"Not any the worse?\" cried Mr. Wackerbath, \"when the infernal place is\nbuilt!\"\n\n\"Built!\" echoed Horace feebly.\n\n\"I tell you, sir, I saw it with my own eyes driving to the station this\nmorning; my coachman and footman saw it; my wife saw it--damn it, sir,\nwe _all_ saw it!\"\n\nThen Horace understood. His indefatigable Jinnee had been at work again!\nOf course, for Fakrash it must have been what he would term \"the easiest\nof affairs\"--especially after a glance at the plans (and Ventimore\nremembered that the Jinnee had surprised him at work upon them, and even\nrequested to have them explained to him)--to dispense with contractors\nand bricklayers and carpenters, and construct the entire building in the\ncourse of a single night.\n\nIt was a generous and spirited action--but, particularly now that the\noriginal designs had been found faulty and rejected, it placed the\nunfortunate architect in a most invidious position.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Wackerbath, with elaborate irony, \"I presume it\nis you whom I have to thank for improving my land by erecting this\nprecious palace on it?\"\n\n\"I--I----\" began Horace, utterly broken down; and then he saw, with\nemotions that may be imagined, the Jinnee himself, in his green robes,\nstanding immediately behind Mr. Wackerbath.\n\n\"Greeting to you,\" said Fakrash, coming forward with his smile of\namiable cunning. \"If I mistake not,\" he added, addressing the startled\nestate agent, who had jumped visibly, \"thou art the merchant for whom my\nson here,\" and he laid a hand on Horace's shrinking shoulder, \"undertook\nto construct a mansion?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Mr. Wackerbath, in some mystification. \"Have I the pleasure\nof addressing Mr. Ventimore, senior?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" put in Horace; \"no relation. He's a sort of informal partner.\"\n\n\"Hast thou not found him an architect of divine gifts?\" inquired the\nJinnee, beaming with pride. \"Is not the palace that he hath raised for\nthee by his transcendent accomplishments a marvel of beauty and\nstateliness, and one that Sultans might envy?\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" shouted the infuriated Mr. Wackerbath; \"since you ask my\nopinion, it's nothing of the sort! It's a ridiculous tom-fool cross\nbetween the palm-house at Kew and the Brighton Pavilion! There's no\nbilliard-room, and not a decent bedroom in the house. I've been all over\nit, so I ought to know; and as for drainage, there isn't a sign of it.\nAnd he has the brass--ah, I should say, the unblushing effrontery--to\ncall that a country house!\"\n\nHorace's dismay was curiously shot with relief. The Jinnee, who was\ncertainly very far from being a genius except by courtesy, had taken it\nupon himself to erect the palace according to his own notions of Arabian\ndomestic luxury--and Horace, taught by bitter experience, could\nsympathise to some extent with his unfortunate client. On the other\nhand, it was balm to his smarting self-respect to find that it was not\nhis own plans, after all, which had been found so preposterous; and, by\nsome obscure mental process, which I do not propose to explain, he\nbecame reconciled, and almost grateful, to the officious Fakrash. And\nthen, too, he was _his_ Jinnee, and Horace had no intention of letting\nhim be bullied by an outsider.\n\n\"Let me explain, Mr. Wackerbath,\" he said. \"Personally I've had nothing\nto do with this. This gentleman, wishing to spare me the trouble, has\ntaken upon himself to build your house for you, without consulting\neither of us, and, from what I know of his powers in the direction, I've\nno doubt that--that it's a devilish fine place, in its way. Anyhow, we\nmake no charge for it--he presents it to you as a free gift. Why not\naccept it as such and make the best of it?\"\n\n\"Make the best of it?\" stormed Mr. Wackerbath. \"Stand by and see the\nbest site in three counties defaced by a jimcrack Moorish nightmare like\nthat! Why, they'll call it 'Wackerbath's Folly,' sir. I shall be the\nlaughing-stock of the neighbourhood. I can't live in the beastly\nbuilding. I couldn't afford to keep it up, and I won't have it cumbering\nmy land. Do you hear? _I won't!_ I'll go to law, cost me what it may,\nand compel you and your Arabian friends there to pull the thing down.\nI'll take the case up to the House of Lords, if necessary, and fight you\nas long as I can stand!\"\n\n\"As long as thou canst stand!\" repeated Fakrash, gently. \"That is a long\ntime truly, O thou litigious one!... On all fours, ungrateful dog that\nthou art!\" he cried, with an abrupt and entire change of manner, \"and\ncrawl henceforth for the remainder of thy days. I, Fakrash-el-Aamash,\ncommand thee!\"\n\nIt was both painful and grotesque to see the portly and intensely\nrespectable Mr. Wackerbath suddenly drop forward on his hands while\ndesperately striving to preserve his dignity. \"How dare you, sir?\" he\nalmost barked, \"how _dare_ you, I say? Are you aware that I could summon\nyou for this? Let me up. I _insist_ upon getting up!\"\n\n\"O contemptible in aspect!\" replied the Jinnee, throwing open the door.\n\"Begone to thy kennel.\"\n\n\"I won't! I can't!\" whimpered the unhappy man. \"How do you expect\nme--me!--to cross Westminster Bridge on all fours? What will the\nofficials think at Waterloo, where I have been known and respected for\nyears? How am I to face my family in--in this position? Do, for mercy's\nsake, let me get up!\"\n\nHorace had been too shocked and startled to speak before, but now\nhumanity, coupled with disgust for the Jinnee's high-handed methods,\ncompelled him to interfere. \"Mr. Fakrash,\" he said, \"this has gone far\nenough. Unless you stop tormenting this unfortunate gentleman, I've done\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Fakrash. \"He hath dared to abuse my palace, which is far\ntoo sumptuous a dwelling for such a son of a burnt dog as he. Therefore,\nI will make his abode to be in the dust for ever.\"\n\n\"But I _don't_ find fault,\" yelped poor Mr. Wackerbath. \"You--you\nentirely misunderstood the--the few comments I ventured to make. It's a\ncapital mansion, handsome, and yet 'homey,' too. I'll never say another\nword against it. I'll--yes, I'll _live_ in it--if only you'll let me\nup?\"\n\n\"Do as he asks you,\" said Horace to the Jinnee, \"or I swear I'll never\nspeak to you again.\"\n\n\"Thou art the arbiter of this matter,\" was the reply. \"And if I yield,\nit is at thy intercession, and not his. Rise then,\" he said to the\nhumiliated client; \"depart, and show us the breadth of thy shoulders.\"\n\nIt was this precise moment which Beevor, who was probably unable to\nrestrain his curiosity any longer, chose to re-enter the room. \"Oh,\nVentimore,\" he began, \"did I leave my----?... I beg your pardon. I\nthought you were alone again.\"\n\n\"Don't go, sir,\" said Mr. Wackerbath, as he scrambled awkwardly to his\nfeet, his usually florid face mottled in grey and lilac. \"I--I should\nlike you to know that, after talking things quietly over with your\nfriend Mr. Ventimore and his partner here, I am thoroughly convinced\nthat my objections were quite untenable. I retract all I said.\nThe house is--ah--admirably planned: _most_ convenient, roomy,\nand--ah--unconventional. The--the entire freedom from all sanitary\nappliances is a particular recommendation. In short, I am more than\nsatisfied. Pray forget anything I may have said which might be taken to\nimply the contrary.... Gentlemen, good afternoon!\"\n\nHe bowed himself past the Jinnee in a state of deference and\napprehension, and was heard stumbling down the staircase. Horace hardly\ndared to meet Beevor's eyes, which were fixed upon the green-turbaned\nJinnee, as he stood apart in dreamy abstraction, smiling placidly to\nhimself.\n\n\"I say,\" Beevor said to Horace, at last, in an undertone, \"you never\ntold me you had gone into partnership.\"\n\n\"He's not a regular partner,\" whispered Ventimore; \"he does odd things\nfor me occasionally, that's all.\"\n\n\"He soon managed to smooth your client down,\" remarked Beevor.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Horace; \"he's an Oriental, you see, and, he has a--a very\npersuasive manner. Would you like to be introduced?\"\n\n\"If it's all the same to you,\" replied Beevor, still below his voice,\n\"I'd rather be excused. To tell you the truth, old fellow, I don't\naltogether fancy the looks of him, and it's my opinion,\" he added, \"that\nthe less you have to do with him the better. He strikes me as a\nwrong'un, old man.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Horace; \"eccentric, that's all--you don't understand\nhim.\"\n\n\"Receive news!\" began the Jinnee, after Beevor, with suspicion and\ndisapproval evident even on his back and shoulders, had retreated to\nhis own room, \"Suleyman, the son of Daood, sleeps with his fathers.\"\n\n\"I know,\" retorted Horace, whose nerves were unequal to much reference\nto Solomon just then. \"So does Queen Anne.\"\n\n\"I have not heard of her. But art thou not astounded, then, by my\ntidings?\"\n\n\"I have matters nearer home to think about,\" said Horace, dryly. \"I must\nsay, Mr. Fakrash, you have landed me in a pretty mess!\"\n\n\"Explain thyself more fully, for I comprehend thee not.\"\n\n\"Why on earth,\" Horace groaned, \"couldn't you let me build that house my\nown way?\"\n\n\"Did I not hear thee with my own ears lament thy inability to perform\nthe task? Thereupon, I determined that no disgrace should fall upon thee\nby reason of such incompetence, since I myself would erect a palace so\nsplendid that it should cause thy name to live for ever. And, behold, it\nis done.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Horace. \"And so am I. I don't want to reproach you. I\nquite feel that you have acted with the best intentions; but, oh, hang\nit all! _can't_ you see that you've absolutely wrecked my career as an\narchitect?\"\n\n\"That is a thing that cannot be,\" returned the Jinnee, \"seeing that thou\nhast all the credit.\"\n\n\"The credit! This is England, not Arabia. What credit can I gain from\nbeing supposed to be the architect of an Oriental pavilion, which might\nbe all very well for Haroun-al-Raschid, but I can assure you is\npreposterous as a home for an average Briton?\"\n\n\"Yet that overfed hound,\" remarked the Jinnee, \"expressed much\ngratification therewith.\"\n\n\"Naturally, after he had found that he could not give a candid opinion\nexcept on all-fours. A valuable testimonial, that! And how do you\nsuppose I can take his money? No, Mr. Fakrash, if I have to go on\nall-fours myself for it, I must say, and I will say, that you've made a\nmost frightful muddle of it!\"\n\n\"Acquaint me with thy wishes,\" said Fakrash, a little abashed, \"for thou\nknowest that I can refuse thee naught.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Horace, boldly, \"couldn't you remove that palace--dissipate\nit into space or something?\"\n\n\"Verily,\" said the Jinnee, in an aggravated tone, \"to do good acts unto\nsuch as thee is but wasted time, for thou givest me no peace till they\nare undone!\"\n\n\"This is the last time,\" urged Horace; \"I promise never to ask you for\nanything again.\"\n\n\"Not for the first time hast thou made such a promise,\" said Fakrash.\n\"And save for the magnitude of thy service unto me, I would not hearken\nto this caprice of thine, nor wilt thou find me so indulgent on another\noccasion. But for this once\"--and he muttered some words and made a\nsweeping gesture with his right hand--\"thy desire is granted unto thee.\nOf the palace and all that is therein there remaineth no trace!\"\n\n\"Another surprise for poor old Wackerbath,\" thought Horace, \"but a\npleasant one this time. My dear Mr. Fakrash,\" he said aloud, \"I really\ncan't say how grateful I am to you. And now--I hate bothering you like\nthis, but if you _could_ manage to look in on Professor Futvoye----\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the Jinnee, \"yet another request? Already!\"\n\n\"Well, you promised you'd do that before, you know!\" said Horace.\n\n\"For that matter,\" remarked Fakrash, \"I have already fulfilled my\npromise.\"\n\n\"You have?\" Horace exclaimed. \"And does he believe now that it's all\ntrue about that bottle?\"\n\n\"When I left him,\" answered the Jinnee, \"all his doubts were removed.\"\n\n\"By Jove, you _are_ a trump!\" cried Horace, only too glad to be able to\ncommend with sincerity. \"And do you think, if I went to him now, I\nshould find him the same as usual?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Fakrash, with his weak and yet inscrutable smile, \"that is\nmore than I can promise thee.\"\n\n\"But why?\" asked Horace, \"if he knows all?\"\n\nThere was the oddest expression in the Jinnee's furtive eyes: a kind of\nelfin mischief combined with a sense of wrong-doing, like a naughty\nchild whose palate is still reminiscent of illicit jam. \"Because,\" he\nreplied, with a sound between a giggle and a chuckle, \"because, in order\nto overcome his unbelief, it was necessary to transform him into a\none-eyed mule of hideous appearance.\"\n\n\"_What!_\" cried Horace. But, whether to avoid thanks or explanations,\nthe Jinnee had disappeared with his customary abruptness.\n\n\"Fakrash!\" shouted Horace, \"Mr. Fakrash! Come back! Do you hear? I\n_must_ speak to you!\" There was no answer; the Jinnee might be well on\nhis way to Lake Chad, or Jericho, by that time--he was certainly far\nenough from Great Cloister Street.\n\nHorace sat down at his drawing-table, and, his head buried in his hands,\ntried to think out this latest complication. Fakrash had transformed\nProfessor Futvoye into a one-eyed mule. It would have seemed incredible,\nalmost unthinkable, once, but so many impossibilities had happened to\nHorace of late that one more made little or no strain upon his\ncredulity.\n\nWhat he felt chiefly was the new barrier that this event must raise\nbetween himself and Sylvia; to do him justice, the mere fact that the\nfather of his _fiancée_ was a mule did not lessen his ardour in the\nslightest. Even if he had felt no personal responsibility for the\ncalamity, he loved Sylvia far too well to be deterred by it, and few\nfamily cupboards are without a skeleton of some sort.\n\nWith courage and the determination to look only on the bright side of\nthings, almost any domestic drawback can be lived down.\n\nBut the real point, as he instantly recognised, was whether in the\nchanged condition of circumstances Sylvia would consent to marry _him_.\nMight she not, after the experiences of that abominable dinner of his\nthe night before, connect him in some way with her poor father's\ntransformation? She might even suspect him of employing this means of\ncompelling the Professor to renew their engagement; and, indeed, Horace\nwas by no means certain himself that the Jinnee might not have acted\nfrom some muddle-headed motive of this kind. It was likely enough that\nthe Professor, after learning the truth, should have refused to allow\nhis daughter to marry the _protégé_ of so dubious a patron, and that\nFakrash had then resorted to pressure.\n\nIn any case, Ventimore knew Sylvia well enough to feel sure that pride\nwould steel her heart against him so long as this obstacle remained.\n\nIt would be unseemly to set down here all that Horace said and thought\nof the person who had brought all this upon them, but after some wild\nand futile raving he became calm enough to recognise that his proper\nplace was by Sylvia's side. Perhaps he ought to have told her at first,\nand then she would have been less unprepared for this--and yet how could\nhe trouble her mind so long as he could cling to the hope that the\nJinnee would cease to interfere?\n\nBut now he could be silent no longer; naturally the prospect of calling\nat Cottesmore Gardens just then was anything but agreeable, but he felt\nit would be cowardly to keep away.\n\nBesides, he could cheer them up; he could bring with him a message of\nhope. No doubt they believed that the Professor's transformation would\nbe permanent--a harrowing prospect for so united a family; but,\nfortunately, Horace would be able to reassure them on this point.\n\nFakrash had always revoked his previous performances as soon as he could\nbe brought to understand their fatuity--and Ventimore would take good\ncare that he revoked this.\n\nNevertheless, it was with a sinking heart and an unsteady hand that he\npulled the visitors' bell at the Futvoyes' house that afternoon, for he\nneither knew in what state he should find that afflicted family, nor how\nthey would regard his intrusion at such a time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE MESSENGER OF HOPE\n\n\nJessie, the neat and pretty parlour-maid, opened the door with a smile\nof welcome which Horace found reassuring. No girl, he thought, whose\nmaster had suddenly been transformed into a mule could possibly smile\nlike that. The Professor, she told him, was not at home, which again was\ncomforting. For a _savant_, however careless about his personal\nappearance, would scarcely venture to brave public opinion in the\nsemblance of a quadruped.\n\n\"Is the Professor out?\" he inquired, to make sure.\n\n\"Not exactly out, sir,\" said the maid, \"but particularly engaged,\nworking hard in his study, and not to be disturbed on no account.\"\n\nThis was encouraging, too, since a mule could hardly engage in literary\nlabour of any kind. Evidently the Jinnee must either have overrated his\nsupernatural powers, or else have been deliberately amusing himself at\nHorace's expense.\n\n\"Then I will see Miss Futvoye,\" he said.\n\n\"Miss Sylvia is with the master, sir,\" said the girl; \"but if you'll\ncome into the drawing-room I'll let Mrs. Futvoye know you are here.\"\n\nHe had not been in the drawing-room long before Mrs. Futvoye appeared,\nand one glance at her face confirmed Ventimore's worst fears. Outwardly\nshe was calm enough, but it was only too obvious that her calmness was\nthe result of severe self-repression; her eyes, usually so shrewdly and\nplacidly observant, had a haggard and hunted look; her ears seemed on\nthe strain to catch some distant sound.\n\n\"I hardly thought we should see you to-day,\" she began, in a tone of\nstudied reserve; \"but perhaps you came to offer some explanation of the\nextraordinary manner in which you thought fit to entertain us last\nnight? If so----\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Horace, looking into his hat, \"I came because I was\nrather anxious about the Professor.\n\n\"About my husband?\" said the poor lady, with a really heroic effort to\nappear surprised. \"He is--as well as could be expected. Why should you\nsuppose otherwise?\" she asked, with a flash of suspicion.\n\n\"I fancied perhaps that--that he mightn't be quite himself to-day,\" said\nHorace, with his eyes on the carpet.\n\n\"I see,\" said Mrs. Futvoye, regaining her composure; \"you were afraid\nthat all those foreign dishes might not have agreed with him.\nBut--except that he is a little irritable this afternoon--he is much as\nusual.\"\n\n\"I'm delighted to hear it,\" said Horace, with reviving hope. \"Do you\nthink he would see me for a moment?\"\n\n\"Great heavens, no!\" cried Mrs. Futvoye, with an irrepressible start; \"I\nmean,\" she explained, \"that, after what took place last night,\nAnthony--my husband--very properly feels that an interview would be too\npainful.\"\n\n\"But when we parted he was perfectly friendly.\"\n\n\"I can only say,\" replied the courageous woman, \"that you would find him\nconsiderably altered now.\"\n\nHorace had no difficulty in believing it.\n\n\"At least, I may see Sylvia?\" he pleaded.\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Futvoye; \"I really can't have Sylvia disturbed just now.\nShe is very busy, helping her father. Anthony has to read a paper at one\nof his societies to-morrow night, and she is writing it out from his\ndictation.\"\n\nIf any departure from strict truth can ever be excusable, this surely\nwas one; unfortunately, just then Sylvia herself burst into the room.\n\n\"Mother,\" she cried, without seeing Horace in her agitation, \"do come\nto papa, quick! He has just begun kicking again, and I can't manage him\nalone.... Oh, _you_ here?\" she broke off, as she saw who was in the\nroom. \"Why do you come here now, Horace? Please, _please_ go away! Papa\nis rather unwell--nothing serious, only--oh, _do_ go away!\"\n\n\"Darling!\" said Horace, going to her and taking both her hands, \"I know\nall--do you understand?--_all_!\"\n\n\"Mamma!\" cried Sylvia, reproachfully, \"have you told him--already? When\nwe settled that even Horace wasn't to know till--till papa recovers!\"\n\n\"I have told him nothing, my dear,\" replied her mother. \"He can't\npossibly know, unless--but no, that isn't possible. And, after all,\" she\nadded, with a warning glance at her daughter, \"I don't know why we\nshould make any mystery about a mere attack of gout. But I had better go\nand see if your father wants anything.\" And she hurried out of the room.\n\nSylvia sat down and gazed silently into the fire. \"I dare say you don't\nknow how dreadfully people kick when they've got gout,\" she remarked\npresently.\n\n\"Oh yes, I do,\" said Horace, sympathetically; \"at least, I can guess.\"\n\n\"Especially when it's in both legs,\" continued Sylvia.\n\n\"Or,\" said Horace gently, \"in all four.\"\n\n\"Ah, you _do_ know!\" cried Sylvia. \"Then it's all the more horrid of you\nto come!\"\n\n\"Dearest,\" said Horace, \"is not this just the time when my place should\nbe near you--and him?\"\n\n\"Not near papa, Horace!\" she put in anxiously; \"it wouldn't be at all\nsafe.\"\n\n\"Do you really think I have any fear for myself?\"\n\n\"Are you sure you quite know--what he is like now?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Horace, trying to put it as considerately as\npossible, \"that a casual observer, who didn't know your father, might\nmistake him, at first sight, for--for some sort of quadruped.\"\n\n\"He's a mule,\" sobbed Sylvia, breaking down entirely. \"I could bear it\nbetter if he had been a _nice_ mule.... B--but he isn't!\"\n\n\"Whatever he may be,\" declared Horace, as he knelt by her chair\nendeavouring to comfort her, \"nothing can alter my profound respect for\nhim. And you must let me see him, Sylvia; because I fully believe I\nshall be able to cheer him up.\"\n\n\"If you imagine you can persuade him to--to laugh it off!\" said Sylvia,\ntearfully.\n\n\"I wasn't proposing to try to make him see the humorous side of his\nsituation,\" Horace mildly explained. \"I trust I have more tact than\nthat. But he may be glad to know that, at the worst, it is only a\ntemporary inconvenience. I'll take care that he's all right again before\nvery long.\"\n\nShe started up and looked at him, her eyes widened with dawning dread\nand mistrust.\n\n\"If you can speak like that,\" she said, \"it must have been _you_\nwho--no, I can't believe it--that would be too horrible!\"\n\n\"I who did _what_, Sylvia? Weren't you there when--when it happened?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"I was only told of it afterwards. Mother heard papa\ntalking loudly in his study this morning, as if he was angry with\nsomebody, and at last she grew so uneasy she couldn't bear it any\nlonger, and went in to see what was the matter with him. Dad was quite\nalone and looked as usual, only a little excited; and then, without the\nslightest warning, just as she entered the room, he--he changed slowly\ninto a mule before her eyes! Anybody but mamma would have lost her head\nand roused the whole house.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven she didn't!\" said Horace, fervently. \"That was what I was\nmost afraid of.\"\n\n\"Then--oh, Horace, it _was_ you! It's no use denying it. I feel more\ncertain of it every moment!\"\n\n\"Now, Sylvia!\" he protested, still anxious, if possible, to keep the\nworst from her, \"what could have put such an idea as that into your\nhead?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said slowly. \"Several things last night. No one who\nwas really nice, and like everybody else, would live in such queer rooms\nlike those, and dine on cushions, with dreadful black slaves, and--and\ndancing-girls and things. You pretended you were quite poor.\"\n\n\"So I am, darling. And as for my rooms, and--and the rest, they're all\ngone, Sylvia. If you went to Vincent Square to-day, you wouldn't find a\ntrace of them!\"\n\n\"That only shows!\" said Sylvia. \"But why should you play such a cruel,\nand--and ungentlemanly trick on poor dad? If you had ever really loved\nme----!\"\n\n\"But I do, Sylvia, you can't really believe me capable of such an\noutrage! Look at me and tell me so.\"\n\n\"No, Horace,\" said Sylvia frankly. \"I don't believe _you_ did it. But I\nbelieve you know who _did_. And you had better tell me at once!\"\n\n\"If you're quite sure you can stand it,\" he replied, \"I'll tell you\neverything.\" And, as briefly as possible, he told her how he had\nunsealed the brass bottle, and all that had come of it.\n\nShe bore it, on the whole, better than he had expected; perhaps, being a\nwoman, it was some consolation to her to remind him that she had\nforetold something of this kind from the very first.\n\n\"But, of course, I never really thought it would be so awful as this!\"\nshe said. \"Horace, how _could_ you be so careless as to let a great\nwicked thing like that escape out of its bottle?\"\n\n\"I had a notion it was a manuscript,\" said Horace--\"till he came out.\nBut he isn't a great wicked thing, Sylvia. He's an amiable old Jinnee\nenough. And he'd do anything for me. Nobody could be more grateful and\ngenerous than he has been.\"\n\n\"Do you call it generous to change the poor, dear dad into a mule?\"\ninquired Sylvia, with a little curl of her upper lip.\n\n\"That was an oversight,\" said Horace; \"he meant no harm by it. In Arabia\nthey do these things--or used to in his day. Not that that's much excuse\nfor him. Still, he's not so young as he was, and besides, being bottled\nup for all those centuries must have narrowed him rather. You must try\nand make allowances for him, darling.\"\n\n\"I shan't,\" said Sylvia, \"unless he apologises to poor father, and puts\nhim right at once.\"\n\n\"Why, of course, he'll do that,\" Horace answered confidently. \"I'll see\nthat he does. I don't mean to stand any more of his nonsense. I'm afraid\nI've been just a little too slack for fear of hurting his feelings; but\nthis time he's gone too far, and I shall talk to him like a Dutch uncle.\nHe's always ready to do the right thing when he's once shown where he\nhas gone wrong--only he takes such a lot of showing, poor old chap!\"\n\n\"But when do you think he'll--do the right thing?\"\n\n\"Oh, as soon as I see him again.\"\n\n\"Yes; but when _will_ you see him again?\"\n\n\"That's more than I can say. He's away just now--in China, or Peru, or\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"Horace! Then he won't be back for months and months!\"\n\n\"Oh yes, he will. He can do the whole trip, _aller et retour_, you know,\nin a few hours. He's an active old beggar for his age. In the meantime,\ndearest, the chief thing is to keep up your father's spirits. So I think\nI'd better---- I was just telling Sylvia, Mrs. Futvoye,\" he said, as\nthat lady re-entered the room, \"that I should like to see the Professor\nat once.\"\n\n\"It's quite, _quite_ impossible!\" was the nervous reply. \"He's in such a\nstate that he's unable to see any one. You don't know how fractious gout\nmakes him!\"\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Futvoye,\" said Horace, \"believe me, I know more than you\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Yes, mother, dear,\" put in Sylvia, \"he knows everything--_really_\neverything. And perhaps it might do dad good to see him.\"\n\nMrs. Futvoye sank helplessly down on a settee. \"Oh, dear me!\" she said.\n\"I don't know _what_ to say. I really don't. If you had seen him plunge\nat the mere suggestion of a doctor!\"\n\nPrivately, though naturally he could not say so, Horace thought a vet.\nmight be more appropriate, but eventually he persuaded Mrs. Futvoye to\nconduct him to her husband's study.\n\n\"Anthony, love,\" she said, as she knocked gently at the door, \"I've\nbrought Horace Ventimore to see you for a few moments, if he may.\"\n\nIt seemed from the sounds of furious snorting and stamping within, that\nthe Professor resented this intrusion on his privacy. \"My dear Anthony,\"\nsaid his devoted wife, as she unlocked the door and turned the key on\nthe inside after admitting Horace, \"try to be calm. Think of the\nservants downstairs. Horace is _so_ anxious to help.\"\n\nAs for Ventimore, he was speechless--so inexpressibly shocked was he by\nthe alteration in the Professor's appearance. He had never seen a mule\nin sorrier condition or in so vicious a temper. Most of the lighter\nfurniture had been already reduced to matchwood; the glass doors of the\nbookcase were starred or shivered; precious Egyptian pottery and glass\nwere strewn in fragments on the carpets, and even the mummy, though it\nstill smiled with the same enigmatic cheerfulness, seemed to have\nsuffered severely from the Professorial hoofs.\n\nHorace instinctively felt that any words of conventional sympathy would\njar here; indeed, the Professor's attitude and expression reminded him\nirresistibly of a certain \"Blondin Donkey\" he had seen enacted by\nmusic-hall artists, at the point where it becomes sullen and defiant.\nOnly, he had laughed helplessly at the Blondin Donkey, and somehow he\nfelt no inclination to laugh now.\n\n\"Believe me, sir,\" he began, \"I would not disturb you like this\nunless--steady there, for Heaven's sake Professor, don't kick till\nyou've heard me out!\" For, the mule, in a clumsy, shambling way which\nbetrayed the novice, was slowly revolving on his own axis so as to bring\nhis hind-quarters into action, while still keeping his only serviceable\neye upon his unwelcome visitor.\n\n\"Listen to me, sir,\" said Horace, manoeuvring in his turn. \"I'm not to\nblame for this, and if you brain me, as you seem to be endeavouring to\ndo, you'll simply destroy the only living man who can get you out of\nthis.\"\n\nThe mule appeared impressed by this, and backed cumbrously into a\ncorner, from which he regarded Horace with a mistrustful, but attentive,\neye. \"If, as I imagine, sir,\" continued Horace, \"you are, though\ntemporarily deprived of speech, perfectly capable of following an\nargument, will you kindly signify it by raising your right ear?\" The\nmule's right ear rose with a sharp twitch.\n\n\"Now we can get on,\" said Horace. \"First let me tell you that I\nrepudiate all responsibility for the proceedings of that infernal\nJinnee.... I wouldn't stamp like that--you might go through the floor,\nyou know.... Now, if you will only exercise a little patience----\"\n\nAt this the exasperated animal made a sudden run at him with his mouth\nopen, which obliged Horace to shelter himself behind a large leather\narm-chair. \"You really _must_ keep cool, sir,\" he remonstrated; \"your\nnerves are naturally upset. If I might suggest a little champagne--you\ncould manage it in--in a bucket, and it would help you to pull yourself\ntogether. A whisk of your--er--tail would imply consent.\" The\nProfessor's tail instantly swept some rare Arabian glass lamps and vases\nfrom a shelf at his rear, whereupon Mrs. Futvoye went out, and returned\npresently with a bottle of champagne and a large china _jardinière_, as\nthe best substitute she could find for a bucket.\n\nWhen the mule had drained the flower-pot greedily and appeared\nrefreshed, Horace proceeded: \"I have every hope, sir,\" he said, \"that\nbefore many hours you will be smiling--pray don't prance like that, I\nmean what I say--smiling over what now seems to you, very justly, a most\nannoying and serious catastrophe. I shall speak seriously to Fakrash\n(the Jinnee, you know), and I am sure that, as soon as he realises what\na frightful blunder he has made, he will be the first to offer you every\nreparation in his power. For, old foozle as he is, he's thoroughly\ngood-hearted.\"\n\nThe Professor drooped his ears at this, and shook his head with a\ndoleful incredulity that made him look more like the Pantomime Donkey\nthan ever.\n\n\"I think I understand him fairly well by this time, sir,\" said Horace,\n\"and I'll answer for it that there's no real harm in him. I give you my\nword of honour that, if you'll only remain quiet and leave everything to\nme, you shall very soon be released from this absurd position. That's\nall I came to tell you, and now I won't trouble you any longer. If you\n_could_ bring yourself, as a sign that you bear me no ill-feeling, to\ngive me your--your off-foreleg at parting, I----\"\n\nBut the Professor turned his back in so pointed and ominous a manner\nthat Horace judged it better to withdraw without insisting further. \"I'm\nafraid,\" he said to Mrs. Futvoye, after they had rejoined Sylvia in the\ndrawing-room--\"I'm afraid your husband is still a little sore with me\nabout this miserable business.\"\n\n\"I don't know what else you can expect,\" replied the lady, rather\ntartly; \"he can't help feeling--as we all must and do, after what you\nsaid just now--that, but for you, this would never have happened!\"\n\n\"If you mean it was all through my attending that sale,\" said Horace,\n\"you might remember that I only went there at the Professor's request.\nYou know that, Sylvia.\"\n\n\"Yes, Horace,\" said Sylvia; \"but papa never asked you to buy a hideous\nbrass bottle with a nasty Genius in it. And any one with ordinary common\nsense would have kept it properly corked!\"\n\n\"What, you against me too, Sylvia!\" cried Horace, cut to the quick.\n\n\"No, Horace, never against you. I didn't mean to say what I did. Only it\n_is_ such a relief to put the blame on somebody. I know, I _know_ you\nfeel it almost as much as we do. But so long as poor, dear papa remains\nas he is, we can never be anything to one another. You must see that,\nHorace!\"\n\n\"Yes, I see that,\" he said; \"but trust me, Sylvia, he shall _not_ remain\nas he is. I swear he shall not. In another day or two, at the outside,\nyou will see him his own self once more. And then--oh, darling, darling,\nyou won't let anything or anybody separate us? Promise me that!\"\n\nHe would have held her in his arms, but she kept him at a distance.\n\"When papa is himself again,\" she said, \"I shall know better what to\nsay. I can't promise anything now, Horace.\"\n\nHorace recognised that no appeal would draw a more definite answer from\nher just then; so he took his leave, with the feeling that, after all,\nmatters must improve before very long, and in the meantime he must bear\nthe suspense with patience.\n\nHe got through dinner as well as he could in his own rooms, for he did\nnot like to go to his club lest the Jinnee should suddenly return during\nhis absence.\n\n\"If he wants me he'd be quite equal to coming on to the club after me,\"\nhe reflected, \"for he has about as much sense of the fitness of things\nas Mary's lamb. I shouldn't care about seeing him suddenly bursting\nthrough the floor of the smoking-room. Nor would the committee.\"\n\nHe sat up late, in the hope that Fakrash would appear; but the Jinnee\nmade no sign, and Horace began to get uneasy. \"I wish there was some\nway of ringing him up,\" he thought. \"If he were only the slave of a ring\nor a lamp, I'd rub it; but it wouldn't be any use to rub that\nbottle--and, besides, he isn't a slave. Probably he has a suspicion that\nhe has not exactly distinguished himself over his latest feat, and\nthinks it prudent to keep out of my way for the present. But if he\nfancies he'll make things any better for himself by that he'll find\nhimself mistaken.\"\n\nIt was maddening to think of the unhappy Professor still fretting away\nhour after hour in the uncongenial form of a mule, waiting impatiently\nfor the relief that never came. If it lingered much longer, he might\nactually starve, unless his family thought of getting in some oats for\nhim, and he could be prevailed upon to touch them. And how much longer\ncould they succeed in concealing the nature of his affliction? How long\nbefore all Kensington, and the whole civilised world, would know that\none of the leading Orientalists in Europe was restlessly prancing on\nfour legs around his study in Cottesmore Gardens?\n\nRacked by speculations such as these, Ventimore lay awake till well into\nthe small hours, when he dropped off into troubled dreams that, wild as\nthey were, could not be more grotesquely fantastic than the realities to\nwhich they were the alternative.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. A CHOICE OF EVILS\n\n\nNot even his morning tub could brace Ventimore's spirits to their usual\ncheerfulness. After sending away his breakfast almost untasted he stood\nat his window, looking drearily out over the crude green turf of Vincent\nSquare at the indigo masses of the Abbey and the Victoria Tower and the\nhuge gasometers to the right which loomed faintly through a dun-coloured\nhaze.\n\nHe felt a positive loathing for his office, to which he had gone with\nsuch high hopes and enthusiasm of late. There was no work for him to do\nthere any longer, and the sight of his drawing-table and materials\nwould, he knew, be intolerable in their mute mockery.\n\nNor could he with any decency present himself again at Cottesmore\nGardens while the situation still remained unchanged, as it must do\nuntil he had seen Fakrash.\n\nWhen would the Jinnee return, or--horrible suspicion!--did he never\nintend to return at all?\n\n\"Fakrash!\" he groaned aloud, \"you _can't_ really mean to leave me in\nsuch a regular deuce of a hole as this?\"\n\n\"At thy service!\" said a well-known voice behind him, and he turned to\nsee the Jinnee standing smiling on the hearthrug--and at this\naccomplishment of his dearest desire all his indignation surged back.\n\n\"Oh, _there_ you are!\" he said irritably. \"Where on earth have you been\nall this time?\"\n\n\"Nowhere on earth,\" was the bland reply; \"but in the regions of the air,\nseeking to promote thy welfare.\"\n\n\"If you have been as brilliantly successful up there as you have down\nhere,\" retorted Horace, \"I have much to thank you for.\"\n\n\"I am more than repaid,\" answered the Jinnee, who, like many highly\nestimable persons, was almost impervious to irony, \"by such assurances\nof thy gratitude.\"\n\n\"I'm _not_ grateful,\" said Horace, fuming. \"I'm devilish annoyed!\"\n\n\"Well hath it been written,\" replied the Jinnee:--\n\n\n    \"'Be disregardful of thine affairs, and commit them to the course\n      of Fate,\n    For often a thing that enrages thee may eventually be to thee\n      pleasing.'\"\n\n\n\"I don't see the remotest chance of that, in my case,\" said Horace.\n\n\"Why is thy countenance thus troubled, and what new complaint hast thou\nagainst me?\"\n\n\"What the devil do you mean by turning a distinguished and perfectly\ninoffensive scholar into a wall-eyed mule?\" Horace broke out. \"If that\nis your idea of a practical joke----!\"\n\n\"It is one of the easiest affairs possible,\" said the Jinnee,\ncomplacently running his fingers through the thin strands of his beard.\n\"I have accomplished such transformations on several occasions.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself, that's all. The question is\nnow--how do you propose to restore him again?\"\n\n\"Far from undoing be that which is accomplished!\" was the sententious\nanswer.\n\n\"What?\" cried Horace, hardly believing his ears; \"you surely don't mean\nto allow that unhappy Professor to remain like that for ever, do you?\"\n\n\"None can alter what is predestined.\"\n\n\"Very likely not. But it wasn't decreed that a learned man should be\nsuddenly degraded to a beastly mule for the rest of his life. Destiny\nwouldn't be such a fool!\"\n\n\"Despise not mules, for they are useful and valuable animals in the\nhousehold.\"\n\n\"But, confound it all, have you no imagination? Can't you enter\nat all into the feelings of a man--a man of wide learning and\nreputation--suddenly plunged into such a humiliating condition?\"\n\n\"Upon his own head be it,\" said Fakrash, coldly. \"For he hath brought\nthis fate upon himself.\"\n\n\"Well, how do you suppose that you have helped _me_ by this performance?\nWill it make him any the more disposed to consent to my marrying his\ndaughter? Is that all you know of the world?\"\n\n\"It is not my intention that thou shouldst take his daughter to wife.\"\n\n\"Whether you approve or not, it's my intention to marry her.\"\n\n\"Assuredly she will not marry thee so long as her father remaineth a\nmule.\"\n\n\"There I agree with you. But is that your notion of doing me a good\nturn?\"\n\n\"I did not consider thy interest in this matter.\"\n\n\"Then will you be good enough to consider it now? I have pledged my word\nthat he shall be restored to his original form. Not only my happiness is\nat stake, but my honour.\"\n\n\"By failure to perform the impossible none can lose honour. And this is\na thing that cannot be undone.\"\n\n\"Cannot be undone?\" repeated Horace, feeling a cold clutch at his heart.\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said the Jinnee, sullenly, \"I have forgotten the way.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" retorted Horace; \"I don't believe it. Why,\" he urged,\ndescending to flattery, \"you're such a clever old Johnny--I beg your\npardon, I meant such a clever old _Jinnee_--you can do anything, if you\nonly give your mind to it. Just look at the way you changed this house\nback again to what it was. Marvellous!\"\n\n\"That was the veriest trifle,\" said Fakrash, though he was obviously\npleased by this tribute to his talent; \"this would be a different affair\naltogether.\"\n\n\"But child's play to _you_!\" insinuated Horace. \"Come, you know very\nwell you can do it if you only choose.\"\n\n\"It may be as thou sayest. But I do not choose.\"\n\n\"Then I think,\" said Horace, \"that, considering the obligation you admit\nyourself you are under to me, I have a right to know the reason--the\n_real_ reason--why you refuse.\"\n\n\"Thy claim is not without justice,\" answered the Jinnee, after a pause,\n\"nor can I decline to gratify thee.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" cried Horace; \"I knew you'd see it in the proper light\nwhen it was once put to you. Now, don't lose any more time, but restore\nthat unfortunate man at once, as you've promised.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said the Jinnee; \"I promised thee a reason for my refusal--and\nthat thou shalt have. Know then, O my son, that this indiscreet one had,\nby some vile and unhallowed arts, divined the hidden meaning of what was\nwritten upon the seal of the bottle wherein I was confined, and was\npreparing to reveal the same unto all men.\"\n\n\"What would it matter to you if he did?\"\n\n\"Much--for the writing contained a false and lying record of my\nactions.\"\n\n\"If it is all lies, it can't do you any harm. Why not treat them with\nthe contempt they deserve?\"\n\n\"They are not _all_ lies,\" the Jinnee admitted reluctantly.\n\n\"Well, never mind. Whatever you've done, you've expiated it by this\ntime.\"\n\n\"Now that Suleyman is no more, it is my desire to seek out my kinsmen of\nthe Green Jinn, and live out my days in amity and honour. How can that\nbe if they hear my name execrated by all mortals?\"\n\n\"Nobody would think of execrating you about an affair three thousand\nyears old. It's too stale a scandal.\"\n\n\"Thou speakest without understanding. I tell thee that if men knew but\nthe half of my misdoings,\" said Fakrash, in a tone not altogether free\nfrom a kind of sombre complacency, \"the noise of them would rise even\nunto the uppermost regions, and scorn and loathing would be my portion.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not so bad as all that,\" said Horace, who had a private\nimpression that the Jinnee's \"past\" would probably turn out to be\nchiefly made up of peccadilloes. \"But, anyway, I'm sure the Professor\nwill readily agree to keep silence about it; and, as you have of course,\ngot the seal in your own possession again----\"\n\n\"Nay; the seal is still in his possession, and it is naught to me where\nit is deposited,\" said Fakrash, \"since the only mortal who hath\ndeciphered it is now a dumb animal.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Horace. \"There are several friends of his who could\ndecipher that inscription quite as easily as he did.\"\n\n\"Is this the truth?\" said the Jinnee, in visible alarm.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Horace. \"Within the last quarter of a century\narchæology has made great strides. Our learned men can now read\nBabylonian bricks and Chaldean tablets as easily as if they were\nadvertisements on galvanised iron. You may think you've been extremely\nclever in turning the Professor into an animal, but you'll probably find\nyou've only made another mistake.\"\n\n\"How so?\" inquired Fakrash.\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, seeing his advantage, and pushing it\nunscrupulously, \"now, that, in your infinite wisdom, you have ordained\nthat he should be a mule, he naturally can't possess property. Therefore\nall his effects will have to be sold, and amongst them will be that seal\nof yours, which, like many other things in his collection, will probably\nbe bought up by the British Museum, where it will be examined and\ncommented upon by every Orientalist in Europe. I suppose you've thought\nof all that?\"\n\n\"O young man of marvellous sagacity!\" said the Jinnee; \"truly I had\nomitted to consider these things, and thou hast opened my eyes in time.\nFor I will present myself unto this man-mule and adjure him to reveal\nwhere he hath bestowed this seal, so that I may regain it.\"\n\n\"He can't do that, you know, so long as he remains a mule.\"\n\n\"I will endow him with speech for the purpose.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you this,\" said Horace: \"he's in a very nasty temper just\nnow, naturally enough, and you won't get anything out of him until you\nhave restored him to human form. If you do that, he'll agree to\nanything.\"\n\n\"Whether I restore him or not will depend not on me, but on the damsel\nwho is his daughter, and to whom thou art contracted in marriage. For\nfirst of all I must speak with her.\"\n\n\"So long as I am present and you promise not to play any tricks,\" said\nHorace, \"I've no objection, for I believe, if you once saw her and heard\nher plead for her poor father, you wouldn't have the heart to hold out\nany longer. But you must give me your word that you'll behave yourself.\"\n\n\"Thou hast it,\" said the Jinnee; \"I do but desire to see her on thine\naccount.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" agreed Horace; \"but I really can't introduce you in that\nturban--she'd be terrified. Couldn't you contrive to get yourself up in\ncommonplace English clothes, just for once--something that wouldn't\nattract so much attention?\"\n\n\"Will this satisfy thee?\" inquired the Jinnee, as his green turban and\nflowing robes suddenly resolved themselves into the conventional\nchimney-pot hat, frock-coat, and trousers of modern civilisation.\n\nHe bore a painful resemblance in them to the kind of elderly gentleman\nwho comes on in the harlequinade to be bonneted by the clown; but Horace\nwas in no mood to be critical just then.\n\n\"That's better,\" he said encouragingly; \"much better. Now,\" he added, as\nhe led the way to the hall and put on his own hat and overcoat, \"we'll\ngo out and find a hansom and be at Kensington in less than twenty\nminutes.\"\n\n\"We shall be there in less than twenty seconds,\" said the Jinnee,\nseizing him by the arm above the elbow; and Horace found himself\nsuddenly carried up into the air and set down, gasping with surprise and\nwant of breath, on the pavement opposite the Futvoyes' door.\n\n\"I should just like to observe,\" he said, as soon as he could speak,\n\"that if we've been seen, we shall probably cause a sensation. Londoners\nare not accustomed to seeing people skimming over the chimney-pots like\namateur rooks.\"\n\n\"Trouble not for that,\" said Fakrash, \"for no mortal eyes are capable of\nfollowing our flight.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Horace, \"or I shall lose any reputation I have left.\nI think,\" he added, \"I'd better go in alone first and prepare them, if\nyou don't mind waiting outside. I'll come to the window and wave my\npocket-handkerchief when they're ready. And _do_ come in by the door\nlike an ordinary person, and ask the maidservant if you may see me.\"\n\n\"I will bear it in mind,\" answered the Jinnee, and suddenly sank, or\nseemed to sink, through a chink in the pavement.\n\nHorace, after ringing at the Futvoyes' door, was admitted and shown into\nthe drawing-room, where Sylvia presently came to him, looking as lovely\nas ever, in spite of the pallor due to sleeplessness and anxiety. \"It is\nkind of you to call and inquire,\" she said, with the unnatural calm of\nsuppressed hysteria. \"Dad is much the same this morning. He had a fairly\ngood night, and was able to take part of a carrot for breakfast--but\nI'm afraid he has just remembered that he has to read a paper on\n'Oriental Occultism' before the Asiatic Society this evening, and it's\nworrying him a little.... Oh, Horace,\" she broke out, unexpectedly, \"how\nperfectly awful all this is! How _are_ we to bear it?\"\n\n\"Don't give way, darling!\" said Horace; \"you will not have to bear it\nmuch longer.\"\n\n\"It's all very well, Horace, but unless something is done _soon_ it will\nbe too late. We can't go _on_ keeping a mule in the study without the\nservants suspecting something, and where are we to put poor, dear papa?\nIt's too ghastly to think of his having to be sent away to--to a Home of\nRest for Horses--and yet what _is_ to be done with him?... Why do you\ncome if you can't do anything?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be here unless I could bring you good news. You remember\nwhat I told you about the Jinnee?\"\n\n\"Remember!\" cried Sylvia. \"As if I could forget! Has he really come\nback, Horace?\"\n\n\"Yes. I think I have brought him to see that he has made a foolish\nmistake in enchanting your unfortunate father, and he seems willing to\nundo it on certain conditions. He is somewhere within call at this\nmoment, and will come in whenever I give the signal. But he wishes to\nspeak to you first.\"\n\n\"To _me_? Oh, no, Horace!\" exclaimed Sylvia, recoiling. \"I'd so much\nrather not. I don't like things that have come out of brass bottles. I\nshouldn't know what to say, and it would frighten me horribly.\"\n\n\"You must be brave, darling!\" said Horace. \"Remember that it depends on\nyou whether the Professor is to be restored or not. And there's nothing\nalarming about old Fakrash, either, I've got him to put on ordinary\nthings, and he really doesn't look so bad in them. He's quite a mild,\namiable old noodle, and he'll do anything for you, if you'll only stroke\nhim down the right way. You _will_ see him, won't you, for your father's\nsake?\"\n\n\"If I must,\" said Sylvia, with a shudder, \"I--I'll be as nice to him as\nI can.\"\n\nHorace went to the window and gave the signal, though there was no one\nin sight. However, it was evidently seen, for the next moment there was\na resounding blow at the front door, and a little later Jessie, the\nparlour-maid, announced \"Mr. Fatrasher Larmash--to see Mr. Ventimore,\"\nand the Jinnee stalked gravely in, with his tall hat on his head.\n\n\"You are probably not aware of it, sir,\" said Horace, \"but it is the\ncustom here to uncover in the presence of a lady.\" The Jinnee removed\nhis hat with both hands, and stood silent and impassive.\n\n\"Let me present you to Miss Sylvia Futvoye,\" Ventimore continued, \"the\nlady whose name you have already heard.\"\n\nThere was a momentary gleam in Fakrash's odd, slanting eyes as they\nlighted on Sylvia's shrinking figure, but he made no acknowledgment of\nthe introduction.\n\n\"The damsel is not without comeliness,\" he remarked to Horace; \"but\nthere are lovelier far than she.\"\n\n\"I didn't ask you for either criticisms or comparisons,\" said Ventimore,\nsharply; \"there is nobody in the world equal to Miss Futvoye, in my\nopinion, and you will be good enough to remember that fact. She is\nexceedingly distressed (as any dutiful daughter would be) by the cruel\nand senseless trick you have played her father, and she begs that you\nwill rectify it at once. Don't you, Sylvia?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\" said Sylvia, almost in a whisper, \"if--if it isn't\ntroubling you too much!\"\n\n\"I have been turning over thy words in my mind,\" said Fakrash to Horace,\nstill ignoring Sylvia, \"and I am convinced that thou art right. Even if\nthe contents of the seal were known of all men, they would raise no\nclamour about affairs that concern them not. Therefore it is nothing to\nme in whose hands the seal may be. Dost thou not agree with me in this?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" said Horace. \"And it naturally follows that----\"\n\n\"It naturally follows, as thou sayest,\" said the Jinnee, with a cunning\nassumption of indifference, \"that I have naught to gain by demanding\nback the seal as the price of restoring this damsel's father to his\noriginal form. Wherefore, so far as I am concerned, let him remain a\nmule for ever; unless, indeed, thou art ready to comply with my\nconditions.\"\n\n\"Conditions!\" cried Horace, utterly unprepared for this conclusion.\n\"What can you possibly want from me? But state them. I'll agree to\nanything, in reason!\"\n\n\"I demand that thou shouldst renounce the hand of this damsel.\"\n\n\"That's out of all reason,\" said Horace, \"and you know it. I will never\ngive her up, so long as she is willing to keep me.\"\n\n\"Maiden,\" said the Jinnee, addressing Sylvia for the first time, \"the\nmatter rests with thee. Wilt thou release this my son from his contract,\nsince thou art no fit wife for such as he?\"\n\n\"How can I,\" cried Sylvia, \"when I love him and he loves me? What a\nwicked tyrannical old thing you must be to expect it! I _can't_ give him\nup.\"\n\n\"It is but giving up what can never be thine,\" said Fakrash. \"And be not\nanxious for him, for I will reward and console him a thousandfold for\nthe loss of thy society. A little while, and he shall remember thee no\nmore.\"\n\n\"Don't believe him, darling,\" said Horace; \"you know me better than\nthat.\"\n\n\"Remember,\" said the Jinnee, \"that by thy refusal thou wilt condemn thy\nparent to remain a mule throughout all his days. Art thou so unnatural\nand hard-hearted a daughter as to do this thing?\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't!\" cried Sylvia. \"I can't let poor father remain a mule\nall his life when one word--and yet what _am_ I to do? Horace, what\nshall I say? Advise me.... Advise me!\"\n\n\"Heaven help us both!\" groaned Ventimore. \"If I could only see the\nright thing to do. Look here, Mr. Fakrash,\" he added, \"this is a matter\nthat requires consideration. Will you relieve us of your presence for a\nshort time, while we talk it over?\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the Jinnee, in the most obliging manner in the\nworld, and vanished instantly.\n\n\"Now, darling,\" began Horace, after he had gone, \"if that unspeakable\nold scoundrel is really in earnest, there's no denying that he's got us\nin an extremely tight place. But I can't bring myself to believe that he\n_does_ mean it. I fancy he's only trying us. And what I want you to do\nis not to consider me in the matter at all.\"\n\n\"How can I help it?\" said poor Sylvia. \"Horace, you--you don't _want_ to\nbe released, do you?\"\n\n\"I?\" said Horace, \"when you are all I have in the world! That's so\nlikely, Sylvia! But we are bound to look facts in the face. To begin\nwith, even if this hadn't happened, your people wouldn't let our\nengagement continue. For my prospects have changed again, dearest. I'm\neven worse off than when we first met, for that confounded Jinnee has\ncontrived to lose my first and only client for me--the one thing worth\nhaving he ever gave me.\" And he told her the story of the mushroom\npalace and Mr. Wackerbath's withdrawal. \"So you see, darling,\" he\nconcluded, \"I haven't even a home to offer you; and if I had, it would\nbe miserably uncomfortable for you with that old Marplot continually\ndropping in on us--especially if, as I'm afraid he has, he's taken some\nunreasonable dislike to you.\"\n\n\"But surely you can talk him over?\" said Sylvia; \"you said you could do\nanything you liked with him.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to find,\" he replied, ruefully enough, \"that he's not so\neasily managed as I thought. And for the present, I'm afraid, if we are\nto get the Professor out of this, that there's nothing for it but to\nhumour old Fakrash.\"\n\n\"Then you actually advise me to--to break it off?\" she cried; \"I never\nthought you would do that!\"\n\n\"For your own sake,\" said Horace; \"for your father's sake. If _you_\nwon't, Sylvia, I _must_. And you will spare me that? Let us both agree\nto part and--and trust that we shall be united some day.\"\n\n\"Don't try to deceive me or yourself, Horace,\" she said; \"if we part\nnow, it will be for ever.\"\n\nHe had a dismal conviction that she was right. \"We must hope for the\nbest,\" he said drearily; \"Fakrash may have some motive in all this we\ndon't understand. Or he may relent. But part we must, for the present.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she said. \"If he restores dad, I will give you up. But not\nunless.\"\n\n\"Hath the damsel decided?\" asked the Jinnee, suddenly re-appearing; \"for\nthe period of deliberation is past.\"\n\n\"Miss Futvoye and I,\" Horace answered for her, \"are willing to consider\nour engagement at an end, until you approve of its renewal, on condition\nthat you restore her father at once.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\" said Fakrash. \"Conduct me to him, and we will arrange the\nmatter without delay.\"\n\nOutside they met Mrs. Futvoye on her way from the study. \"You here,\nHorace?\" she exclaimed. \"And who is this--gentleman?\"\n\n\"This,\" said Horace, \"is the--er--author of the Professor's misfortunes,\nand he had come here at my request to undo his work.\"\n\n\"It _would_ be so kind of him!\" exclaimed the distressed lady, who was\nby this time far beyond either surprise or resentment. \"I'm sure, if he\nknew all we have gone through----!\" and she led the way to her husband's\nroom.\n\nAs soon as the door was opened the Professor seemed to recognise his\ntormentor in spite of his changed raiment, and was so powerfully\nagitated that he actually reeled on his four legs, and \"stood over\" in\na lamentable fashion.\n\n\"O man of distinguished attainments!\" began the Jinnee, \"whom I have\ncaused, for reasons that are known unto thee, to assume the shape of a\nmule, speak, I adjure thee, and tell me where thou hast deposited the\ninscribed seal which is in thy possession.\"\n\nThe Professor spoke; and the effect of articulate speech proceeding from\nthe mouth of what was to all outward seeming an ordinary mule was\nstrange beyond description. \"I'll see you damned first,\" he said\nsullenly. \"You can't do worse to me than you've done already!\"\n\n\"As thou wilt,\" said Fakrash; \"but unless I regain it, I will not\nrestore thee to what thou wast.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the mule, savagely, \"you'll find it in the top\nright-hand drawer of my writing-table: the key is in that diorite bowl\non the mantelpiece.\"\n\nThe Jinnee unlocked the drawer, and took out the metal cap, which he\nplaced in the breast pocket of his incongruous frock-coat. \"So far,\nwell,\" he said; \"next thou must deliver up to me the transcription thou\nhast made, and swear to preserve an inviolable secrecy regarding the\nmeaning thereof.\"\n\n\"Do you know what you're asking, sir?\" said the mule, laying back his\nears viciously. \"Do you think that to oblige you I'm going to suppress\none of the most remarkable discoveries of my whole scientific career?\nNever, sir--never!\"\n\n\"Since if thou refusest I shall assuredly deprive thee of speech once\nmore and leave thee a mule, as thou art now, of hideous appearance,\"\nsaid the Jinnee, \"thou art like to gain little by a discovery which thou\nwilt be unable to impart. However, the choice rests with thee.\"\n\nThe mule rolled his one eye, and showed all his teeth in a vicious\nsnarl. \"You've got the whip-hand of me,\" he said, \"and I may as well\ngive in. There's a transcript inside my blotting-case--it's the only\ncopy I've made.\"\n\nFakrash found the paper, which he rubbed into invisibility between his\npalms, as any ordinary conjurer might do.\n\n\"Now raise thy right forefoot,\" he said, \"and swear by all thou holdest\nsacred never to divulge what thou hast learnt\"--which oath the\nProfessor, in the vilest of tempers, took, clumsily enough.\n\n\"Good,\" said the Jinnee, with a grim smile. \"Now let one of thy women\nbring me a cup of fair water.\"\n\nSylvia went out, and came back with a cup of water. \"It's filtered,\" she\nsaid anxiously; \"I don't know if that will do?\"\n\n\"It will suffice,\" said Fakrash. \"Let both the women withdraw.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" remonstrated Mrs. Futvoye, \"you don't mean to turn his wife\nand daughter out of the room at such a moment as this? We shall be\nperfectly quiet, and we may even be of some help.\"\n\n\"Do as you're told, my dear!\" snapped the ungrateful mule; \"do as you're\ntold. You'll only be in the way here. Do you suppose he doesn't know his\nown beastly business?\"\n\nThey left accordingly; whereupon Fakrash took the cup--an ordinary\nbreakfast cup with a Greek key-border pattern in pale blue round the\ntop--and, drenching the mule with the contents, exclaimed, \"Quit this\nform and return to the form in which thou wast!\"\n\nFor a dreadful moment or two it seemed as if no effect was to be\nproduced; the animal simply stood and shivered, and Ventimore began to\nfeel an agonising suspicion that the Jinnee really had, as he had first\nasserted, forgotten how to perform this particular incantation.\n\nAll at once the mule reared, and began to beat the air frantically with\nhis fore-hoofs; after which he fell heavily backward into the nearest\narmchair (which was, fortunately, a solid and capacious piece of\nfurniture) with his fore-legs hanging limply at his side, in a\nsemi-human fashion. There was a brief convulsion, and then, by some\ngradual process unspeakably impressive to witness, the man seemed to\nbreak through the mule, the mule became merged in the man--and Professor\nFutvoye, restored to his own natural form and habit, sat gasping and\ntrembling in the chair before them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. \"SINCE THERE'S NO HELP, COME, LET US KISS AND PART!\"\n\n\nAs soon as the Professor seemed to have regained his faculties, Horace\nopened the door and called in Sylvia and her mother, who were, as was\nonly to be expected, overcome with joy on seeing the head of the family\nreleased from his ignoble condition of a singularly ill-favoured\nquadruped.\n\n\"There, there,\" said the Professor, as he submitted to their embraces\nand incoherent congratulations, \"it's nothing to make a fuss about. I'm\nquite myself again, as you can see. And,\" he added, with an unreasonable\noutburst of ill-temper, \"if one of you had only had the common sense to\nthink of such a simple remedy as sprinkling a little cold water over me\nwhen I was first taken like that, I should have been spared a great deal\nof unnecessary inconvenience. But that's always the way with women--lose\ntheir heads the moment anything goes wrong! If I had not kept perfectly\ncool myself--\"\n\n\"It was very, very stupid of us not to think of it, papa,\" said Sylvia,\ntactfully ignoring the fact that there was scarcely an undamaged article\nin the room; \"still, you know, if _we_ had thrown the water it mightn't\nhave had the same effect.\"\n\n\"I'm not in a condition to argue now,\" said her father; \"you didn't\ntrouble to try it, and there's no more to be said.\"\n\n\"No more to be said!\" exclaimed Fakrash. \"O thou monster of ingratitude,\nhast thou no thanks for him who hath delivered thee from thy\npredicament?\"\n\n\"As I am already indebted to you, sir,\" said the Professor, \"for about\ntwenty-four hours of the most poignant and humiliating mental and bodily\nanguish a human being can endure, inflicted for no valid reason that I\ncan discover, except the wanton indulgence of your unholy powers, I can\nonly say that any gratitude of which I am conscious is of a very\nqualified description. As for you, Ventimore,\" he added, turning to\nHorace, \"I don't know--I can only guess at--the part you have played in\nthis wretched business; but in any case you will understand, once for\nall, that all relations between us must cease.\"\n\n\"Papa,\" said Sylvia, tremulously, \"Horace and I have already agreed\nthat--that we must separate.\"\n\n\"At my bidding,\" explained Fakrash, suavely; \"for such an alliance would\nbe totally unworthy of his merits and condition.\"\n\nThis frankness was rather too much for the Professor, whose temper had\nnot been improved by his recent trials.\n\n\"Nobody asked for your opinion, sir!\" he snapped. \"A person who has only\nrecently been released from a term of long and, from all I have been\nable to ascertain, well-deserved imprisonment, is scarcely entitled to\npose as an authority on social rank. Have the decency not to interfere\nagain with my domestic affairs.\"\n\n\"Excellent is the saying,\" remarked the imperturbable Jinnee, \"'Let the\nrat that is between the paws of the leopard observe rigidly all the\nrules of politeness and refrain from words of provocation.' For to\nreturn thee to the form of a mule once more would be no difficult\nundertaking.\"\n\n\"I think I failed to make myself clear,\" the Professor hastened to\nobserve--\"failed to make myself clear. I--I merely meant to congratulate\nyou on your fortunate escape from the consequences of what I--I don't\ndoubt was an error of justice. I--I am sure that, in the future, you\nwill employ your--your very remarkable abilities to better purpose, and\nI would suggest that the greatest service you can do this unfortunate\nyoung man here is to abstain from any further attempts to promote his\ninterests.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" Horace could not help throwing in, though in so discreet\nan undertone that it was inaudible.\n\n\"Far be this from me,\" replied Fakrash. \"For he has become unto me even\nas a favourite son, whom I design to place upon the golden pinnacle of\nfelicity. Therefore, I have chosen for him a wife, who is unto this\ndamsel of thine as the full moon to the glow-worm, and as the bird of\nParadise to an unfledged sparrow. And the nuptials shall be celebrated\nbefore many hours.\"\n\n\"Horace!\" cried Sylvia, justly incensed, \"why--_why_ didn't you tell me\nthis before?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said the unhappy Horace, \"this is the very first I've heard\nof it. He's always springing some fresh surprise on me,\" he added, in a\nwhisper--\"but they never come to anything much. And he can't marry me\nagainst my will, you know.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Sylvia, biting her lip. \"I never supposed he could do that,\nHorace.\"\n\n\"I'll settle this at once,\" he replied. \"Now, look here, Mr. Jinnee,\" he\nadded, \"I don't know what new scheme you have got in your head--but if\nyou are proposing to marry me to anybody in particular----\"\n\n\"Have I not informed thee that I have it in contemplation to obtain for\nthee the hand of a King's daughter of marvellous beauty and\naccomplishments?\"\n\n\"You know perfectly well you never mentioned it before,\" said Horace,\nwhile Sylvia gave a little low cry.\n\n\"Repine not, O damsel,\" counselled the Jinnee, \"since it is for his\nwelfare. For, though as yet he believeth it not, when he beholds the\nresplendent beauty of her countenance he will swoon away with delight\nand forget thy very existence.\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the sort,\" said Horace, savagely. \"Just\nunderstand that I don't intend to marry any Princess. You may prevent\nme--in fact, you _have_--from marrying this lady, but you can't force me\nto marry anybody else. I defy you!\"\n\n\"When thou hast seen thy bride's perfections thou wilt need no\ncompulsion,\" said Fakrash. \"And if thou shouldst refuse, know this: that\nthou wilt be exposing those who are dear to thee in this household to\ncalamities of the most unfortunate description.\"\n\nThe awful vagueness of this threat completely crushed Horace; he could\nnot think, he did not even dare to imagine, what consequences he might\nbring upon his beloved Sylvia and her helpless parents by persisting in\nhis refusal.\n\n\"Give me time,\" he said heavily; \"I want to talk this over with you.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Ventimore,\" said the Professor, with acidulous politeness;\n\"but, interesting as the discussion of your matrimonial arrangements is\nto you and your--a--protector, I should greatly prefer that you choose\nsome more fitting place for arriving at a decision which is in the\ncircumstances a foregone conclusion. I am rather tired and upset, and I\nshould be obliged if you and this gentleman could bring this most trying\ninterview to a close as soon as you conveniently can.\"\n\n\"You hear, Mr. Fakrash?\" said Horace, between his teeth, \"it is quite\ntime we left. If you go at once, I will follow you very shortly.\"\n\n\"Thou wilt find me awaiting thee,\" answered the Jinnee, and, to Mrs.\nFutvoye's and Sylvia's alarm, disappeared through one of the bookcases.\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, gloomily, \"you see how I'm situated? That obstinate\nold devil has cornered me. I'm done for!\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" said the Professor; \"you appear to be on the eve of a\nmost brilliant alliance, in which I am sure you have our best\nwishes--the best wishes of us all,\" he added pointedly.\n\n\"Sylvia,\" said Horace, still lingering, \"before I go, tell me that,\nwhatever I may have to do, you will understand that--that it will be for\nyour sake!\"\n\n\"Please don't talk like that,\" she said. \"We may never see one another\nagain. Don't let my last recollection of you be of--of a hypocrite,\nHorace!\"\n\n\"A hypocrite!\" he cried. \"Sylvia, this is too much! What have I said or\ndone to make you think me that?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not so simple as you suppose, Horace,\" she replied. \"I see now\nwhy all this has happened: why poor dad was tormented; why you insisted\non my setting you free. But I would have released you without _that_!\nIndeed, all this elaborate artifice wasn't in the least necessary!\"\n\n\"You believe I was an accomplice in that old fool's plot?\" he said. \"You\nbelieve me such a cur as that?\"\n\n\"I don't blame you,\" she said. \"I don't believe you could help yourself.\nHe can make you do whatever he chooses. And then, you are so rich now,\nit is natural that you should want to marry some one--some one more\nsuited to you--like this lovely Princess of yours.\"\n\n\"Of mine!\" groaned the exasperated Horace. \"When I tell you I've never\neven seen her! As if any Princess in the world would marry me to please\na Jinnee out of a brass bottle! And if she did, Sylvia, you can't\nbelieve that any Princess would make me forget you!\"\n\n\"It depends so very much on the Princess,\" was all Sylvia could be\ninduced to say.\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, \"if that's all the faith you have in me, I suppose\nit's useless to say any more. Good-bye, Mrs. Futvoye; good-bye,\nProfessor. I wish I could tell you how deeply I regret all the trouble I\nhave brought on you by my own folly. All I can say is, that I will bear\nanything in future rather than expose you or any of you to the smallest\nrisk.\"\n\n\"I trust, indeed,\" said the Professor, stiffly, \"that you will use all\nthe influence at your command to secure me from any repetition of an\nexperience that might well have unmanned a less equable temperament than\nmy own.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Horace,\" said Mrs. Futvoye, more kindly. \"I believe you are\nmore to be pitied than blamed, whatever others may think. And _I_ don't\nforget--if Anthony does--that, but for you, he might, instead of sitting\nthere comfortably in his armchair, be lashing out with his hind legs and\nkicking everything to pieces at this very moment!\"\n\n\"I deny that I lashed out!\" said the Professor. \"My--a--hind quarters\nmay have been under imperfect control--but I never lost my reasoning\npowers or my good humour for a single instant. I can say that\ntruthfully.\"\n\nIf the Professor could say that truthfully amidst the general wreck in\nwhich he sat, like another Marius, he had little to learn in the gentle\nart of self-deception; but there was nothing to gain by contradicting\nhim then.\n\n\"Good-bye, Sylvia,\" said Horace, and held out his hand.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said, without offering to take it or look at him--and,\nafter a miserable pause, he left the study. But before he had reached\nthe front door he heard a swish and swirl of drapery behind him, and\nfelt her light hand on his arm. \"Ah, no!\" she said, clinging to him, \"I\ncan't let you go like this. I didn't mean all the things I said just\nnow. I _do_ believe in you, Horace--at least, I'll try hard to.... And I\nshall always, _always_ love you, Horace.... I shan't care--very\nmuch--even if you do forget me, so long as you are happy.... Only don't\nbe _too_ happy. Think of me sometimes!\"\n\n\"I shall _not_ be too happy,\" he said, as he held her close to his heart\nand kissed her pathetically drawn mouth and flushed cheeks. \"And I shall\nthink of you always.\"\n\n\"And you won't fall in love with your Princess?\" entreated Sylvia, at\nthe end of her altruism. \"Promise!\"\n\n\"If I am ever provided with one,\" he replied, \"I shall loathe her--for\nnot being you. But don't let us lose heart, darling. There must be some\nway of talking that old idiot out of this nonsense and bringing him\nround to common sense. I'm not going to give in just yet!\"\n\nThese were brave words--but, as they both felt, the situation had little\nenough to warrant them, and, after one last long embrace, they parted,\nand he was no sooner on the steps than he felt himself caught up as\nbefore and borne through the air with breathless speed, till he was set\ndown, he could not have well said how, in a chair in his own\nsitting-room at Vincent Square.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, looking at the Jinnee, who was standing opposite with a\nsmile of intolerable complacency, \"I suppose you feel satisfied with\nyourself over this business?\"\n\n\"It hath indeed been brought to a favourable conclusion,\" said Fakrash.\n\"Well hath the poet written----\"\n\n\"I don't think I can stand any more 'Elegant Extracts' this afternoon,\"\ninterrupted Horace. \"Let us come to business. You seem,\" he went on,\nwith a strong effort to keep himself in hand, \"to have formed some plan\nfor marrying me to a King's daughter. May I ask you for full\nparticulars?\"\n\n\"No honour and advancement can be in excess of thy deserts,\" answered\nthe Jinnee.\n\n\"Very kind of you to say so--but you are probably unaware that, as\nsociety is constituted at the present time, the objections to such an\nalliance would be quite insuperable.\"\n\n\"For me,\" said the Jinnee, \"few obstacles are insuperable. But speak thy\nmind freely.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Horace. \"To begin with, no European Princess of the Blood\nRoyal would entertain the idea for a moment. And if she did, she would\nforfeit her rank and cease to be a Princess, and I should probably be\nimprisoned in a fortress for _lèse majesté_ or something.\"\n\n\"Dismiss thy fears, for I do not propose to unite thee to any Princess\nthat is born of mortals. The bride I intend for thee is a Jinneeyeh; the\npeerless Bedeea-el-Jemal, daughter of my kinsman Shahyal, the Ruler of\nthe Blue Jann.\"\n\n\"Oh, is she, though?\" said Horace, blankly. \"I'm exceedingly obliged,\nbut, whatever may be the lady's attractions----\"\n\n\"Her nose,\" recited the Jinnee, with enthusiasm, \"is like unto the keen\nedge of a polished sword; her hair resembleth jewels, and her cheeks are\nruddy as wine. She hath heavy lips, and when she looketh aside she\nputteth to shame the wild cows....\"\n\n\"My good, excellent friend,\" said Horace, by no means impressed by this\ncatalogue of charms, \"one doesn't marry to mortify wild cows.\"\n\n\"When she walketh with a vacillating gait,\" continued Fakrash, as though\nhe had not been interrupted, \"the willow branch itself turneth green\nwith envy.\"\n\n\"Personally,\" said Horace, \"a waddle doesn't strike me as particularly\nfascinating--it's quite a matter of taste. Do you happen to have seen\nthis enchantress lately?\"\n\n\"My eyes have not been refreshed by her manifold beauties since I was\nenclosed by Suleyman--whose name be accursed--in the brass bottle of\nwhich thou knowest. Why dost thou ask?\"\n\n\"Merely because it occurred to me that, after very nearly three thousand\nyears, your charming kinswoman may--well, to put it as mildly as\npossible, not have altogether escaped the usual effects of Time. I mean,\nshe must be getting on, you know!\"\n\n\"O, silly-bearded one!\" said the Jinnee, in half-scornful rebuke; \"art\nthou, then, ignorant that we of the Jinn are not as mortals, that we\nshould feel the ravages of age?\"\n\n\"Forgive me if I'm personal,\" said Horace; \"but surely your own hair\nand beard might be described as rather inclining to grey.\"\n\n\"Not from age,\" said Fakrash, \"This cometh from long confinement.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Horace. \"Like the Prisoner of Chillon. Well, assuming that\nthe lady in question is still in the bloom of early youth, I see one\nfatal difficulty to becoming her suitor.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said the Jinnee, \"thou art referring to Jarjarees, the son\nof Rejmoos, the son of Iblees?\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't,\" said Horace; \"because, you see, I don't remember having\never heard of him. However, he's _another_ fatal difficulty. That makes\ntwo of them.\"\n\n\"Surely I have spoken of him to thee as my deadliest foe? It is true\nthat he is a powerful and vindictive Efreet, who hath long persecuted\nthe beauteous Bedeea with hateful attentions. Yet it may be possible, by\ngood fortune, to overthrow him.\"\n\n\"Then I gather that any suitor for Bedeea's hand would be looked upon as\na rival by the amiable Jarjarees?\"\n\n\"Far is he from being of an amiable disposition,\" answered the Jinnee,\nsimply, \"and he would be so transported by rage and jealousy that he\nwould certainly challenge thee to mortal combat.\"\n\n\"Then that settles it,\" said Horace. \"I don't think any one can fairly\ncall me a coward, but I do draw the line at fighting an Efreet for the\nhand of a lady I've never seen. How do I know he'll fight fair?\"\n\n\"He would probably appear unto thee first in the form of a lion, and if\nhe could not thus prevail against thee, transform himself into a\nserpent, and then into a buffalo or some other wild beast.\"\n\n\"And I should have to tackle the entire menagerie?\" said Horace. \"Why,\nmy dear sir, I should never get beyond the lion!\"\n\n\"I would assist thee to assume similar transformations,\" said the\nJinnee, \"and thus thou mayst be enabled to defeat him. For I burn with\ndesire to behold mine enemy reduced to cinders.\"\n\n\"It's much more likely that you would have to sweep _me_ up!\" said\nHorace, who had a strong conviction that anything in which the Jinnee\nwas concerned would be bungled somehow. \"And if you're so anxious to\ndestroy this Jarjarees, why don't you challenge him to meet you in some\nquiet place in the desert and settle him yourself? It's much more in\nyour line than it is in mine!\"\n\nHe was not without hopes that Fakrash might act on this suggestion, and\nthat so he would be relieved of him in the simplest and most\nsatisfactory way; but any such hopes were as usual doomed to\ndisappointment.\n\n\"It would be of no avail,\" said the Jinnee, \"for it hath been written of\nold that Jarjarees shall not perish save by the hand of a mortal. And I\nam persuaded that thou wilt turn out to be that mortal, since thou art\nboth strong and fearless, and, moreover, it is also predestined that\nBedeea shall wed one of the sons of men.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Horace, feeling that this line of defence must be\nabandoned, \"I fall back on objection number one. Even if Jarjarees were\nobliging enough to retire in my favour, I should still decline to become\nthe--a--consort of a Jinneeyeh whom I've never seen, and don't love.\"\n\n\"Thou hast heard of her incomparable charms, and verily the ear may love\nbefore the eye.\"\n\n\"It may,\" admitted Horace, \"but neither of _my_ ears is the least in\nlove at present.\"\n\n\"These reasons are of no value,\" said Fakrash, \"and if thou hast none\nbetter----\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ventimore, \"I think I have. You profess to be anxious\nto--to requite the trifling service I rendered you, though hitherto,\nyou'll admit yourself, you haven't made a very brilliant success of it.\nBut, putting the past aside,\" he continued, with a sudden dryness in his\nthroat; \"putting the past aside, I ask you to consider what possible\nbenefit or happiness such a match as this--I'm afraid I'm not so\nfortunate as to secure your attention?\" he broke off, as he observed the\nJinnee's eyes beginning to film over in the disagreeable manner\ncharacteristic of certain birds.\n\n\"Proceed,\" said Fakrash, unskinning his eyes for a second; \"I am\nhearkening unto thee.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" stammered Horace, inconsequently enough, \"that all\nthat time inside a bottle--well, you can't call it _experience_ exactly;\nand possibly in the interval you've forgotten all you knew about\nfeminine nature. I think you _must_ have.\"\n\n\"It is not possible that such knowledge should be forgotten,\" said the\nJinnee, resenting this imputation in quite a human way. \"Thy words\nappear to me to lack sense. Interpret them, I pray thee.\"\n\n\"Why,\" explained Horace, \"you don't mean to tell me that this young and\nlovely relation of yours, a kind of immortal, and--and with the devil's\nown pride, would be gratified by your proposal to bestow her hand upon\nan insignificant and unsuccessful London architect? She'd turn up that\nsharp and polished nose of hers at the mere idea of so unequal a match!\"\n\n\"An excellent rank is that conferred by wealth,\" remarked the Jinnee.\n\n\"But I'm _not_ rich, and I've already declined any riches from you,\"\nsaid Horace. \"And, what's more to the point, I'm perfectly and\nhopelessly obscure. If you had the slightest sense of humour--which I\nfear you have not--you would at once perceive the absurdity of proposing\nto unite a radiant, ethereal, superhuman being to a commonplace\nprofessional nonentity in a morning coat and a tall hat. It's really too\nridiculous!\"\n\n\"What thou hast just said is not altogether without wisdom,\" said\nFakrash, to whom this was evidently a new point of view. \"Art thou,\nindeed, so utterly unknown?\"\n\n\"Unknown?\" repeated Horace; \"I should rather think I was! I'm simply an\ninconsiderable unit in the population of the vastest city in the world;\nor, rather, not a unit--a cipher. And, don't you see, a man to be worthy\nof your exalted kinswoman ought to be a celebrity. There are plenty of\nthem about.\"\n\n\"What meanest thou by a celebrity?\" inquired Fakrash, falling into the\ntrap more readily than Horace had ventured to hope.\n\n\"Oh, well, a distinguished person, whose name is on everybody's lips,\nwho is honoured and praised by all his fellow-citizens. Now, _that_ kind\nof man no Jinneeyeh could look down upon.\"\n\n\"I perceive,\" said Fakrash, thoughtfully. \"Yes, I was in danger of\ncommitting a rash action. How do men honour such distinguished\nindividuals in these days?\"\n\n\"They generally overfeed them,\" said Horace. \"In London the highest\nhonour a hero can be paid is to receive the freedom of the City, which\nis only conferred in very exceptional cases, and for some notable\nservice. But, of course, there are other sorts of celebrities, as you\ncould see if you glanced through the society papers.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe that thou, who seemest a gracious and talented young\nman, can be indeed so obscure as thou hast represented.\"\n\n\"My good sir, any of the flowers that blush unseen in the desert air, or\nthe gems concealed in ocean caves, so excellently described by one of\nour poets, could give me points and a beating in the matter of\nnotoriety. I'll make you a sporting offer. There are over five million\ninhabitants in this London of ours. If you go out into the streets and\nask the first five hundred you meet whether they know me, I don't mind\nbetting you--what shall I say? a new hat--that you won't find half a\ndozen who've ever even heard of my existence. Why not go out and see for\nyourself?\"\n\nTo his surprise and gratification the Jinnee took this seriously. \"I\nwill go forth and make inquiry,\" he said, \"for I desire further\nenlightenment concerning thy statements. But, remember,\" he added:\n\"should I still require thee to wed the matchless Bedeea-el-Jemal, and\nthou shouldst disobey me, thou wilt bring disaster, not on thine own\nhead, but on those thou art most desirous of protecting.\"\n\n\"Yes, so you told me before,\" said Horace, brusquely. \"Good evening.\"\nBut Fakrash was already gone. In spite of all he had gone through and\nthe unknown difficulties before him, Ventimore was seized with what\nUncle Remus calls \"a spell of the dry grins\" at the thought of the\nprobable replies that the Jinnee would meet with in the course of his\ninquiries. \"I'm afraid he won't be particularly impressed by the\npoliteness of a London crowd,\" he thought; \"but at least they'll\nconvince him that I am not exactly a prominent citizen. Then he'll give\nup this idiotic match of his--I don't know, though. He's such a\npig-headed old fool that he may stick to it all the same. I may find\nmyself encumbered with a Jinneeyeh bride several centuries my senior\nbefore I know where I am. No, I forget; there's the jealous Jarjarees to\nbe polished off first. I seem to remember something about a quick-change\ncombat with an Efreet in the \"Arabian Nights.\" I may as well look it up,\nand see what may be in store for me.\"\n\nAnd after dinner he went to his shelves and took down Lane's\nthree-volume edition of \"The Arabian Nights,\" which he set himself to\nstudy with a new interest. It was long since he had looked into these\nwondrous tales, old beyond all human calculation, and fresher, even now,\nthan the most modern of successful romances. After all, he was tempted\nto think, they might possess quite as much historical value as many\nworks with graver pretentions to accuracy.\n\nHe found a full account of the combat with the Efreet in \"The Story of\nthe Second Royal Mendicant\" in the first volume, and was unpleasantly\nsurprised to discover that the Efreet's name was actually given as\n\"Jarjarees, the son of Rejmoos, the son of Iblees\"--evidently the same\nperson to whom Fakrash had referred as his bitterest foe. He was\ndescribed as \"of hideous aspect,\" and had, it seemed, not only carried\noff the daughter of the Lord of the Ebony Island on her wedding night,\nbut, on discovering her in the society of the Royal Mendicant, had\nrevenged himself by striking off her hands, her feet, and her head, and\ntransforming his human rival into an ape. \"Between this fellow and old\nFakrash,\" he reflected ruefully, at this point, \"I seem likely to have a\nfairly lively time of it!\"\n\nHe read on till he reached the memorable encounter between the King's\ndaughter and Jarjarees, who presented himself \"in a most hideous shape,\nwith hands like winnowing forks, and legs like masts, and eyes like\nburning torches\"--which was calculated to unnerve the stoutest novice.\nThe Efreet began by transforming himself from a lion to a scorpion, upon\nwhich the Princess became a serpent; then he changed to an eagle, and\nshe to a vulture; he to a black cat, and she to a cock; he to a fish,\nand she to a larger fish still.\n\n\"If Fakrash can shove me through all that without a fatal hitch\nsomewhere,\" Ventimore told himself, \"I shall be agreeably disappointed\nin him,\" But, after reading a few more lines, he cheered up. For the\nEfreet finished as a flame, and the Princess as a \"body of fire.\" \"And\nwhen we looked towards him,\" continued the narrator, \"we perceived that\nhe had become a heap of ashes.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Horace to himself, \"that puts Jarjarees out of action, any\nway! The odd thing is that Fakrash should never have heard of it.\"\n\nBut, as he saw on reflection, it was not so very odd, after all, as the\nincident had probably happened after the Jinnee had been consigned to\nhis brass bottle, where intelligence of any kind would be most unlikely\nto reach him.\n\nHe worked steadily through the whole of the second volume and part of\nthe third; but, although he picked up a certain amount of information\nupon Oriental habits and modes of thought and speech which might come in\nuseful later, it was not until he arrived at the 24th Chapter of the\nthird volume that his interest really revived.\n\nFor the 24th Chapter contained \"The Story of Seyf-el-Mulook and\nBedeea-el-Jemal,\" and it was only natural that he should be anxious to\nknow all that there was to know concerning the antecedents of one who\nmight be his _fiancée_ before long. He read eagerly.\n\nBedeea, it appeared, was the lovely daughter of Shahyal, one of the\nKings of the Believing Jann; her father--not Fakrash himself, as the\nJinnee had incorrectly represented--had offered her in marriage to no\nless a personage than King Solomon himself, who, however, had preferred\nthe Queen of Sheba. Seyf, the son of the King of Egypt, afterwards fell\ndesperately in love with Bedeea, but she and her grandmother both\ndeclared that between mankind and the Jann there could be no agreement.\n\n\"And Seyf was a King's son!\" commented Horace. \"I needn't alarm myself.\nShe wouldn't be likely to have anything to say to _me_. It's just as I\ntold Fakrash.\"\n\nHis heart grew lighter still as he came to the end, for he learnt that,\nafter many adventures which need not be mentioned here, the devoted Seyf\ndid actually succeed in gaining the proud Bedeea as his wife. \"Even\nFakrash could not propose to marry me to some one who has a husband\nalready,\" he thought. \"Still, she _may_ be a widow!\"\n\nTo his relief, however, the conclusion ran thus; \"Seyf-el-Mulook lived\nwith Bedeea-el-Jemal a most pleasant and agreeable life ... until they\nwere visited by the terminator of delights and the separator of\ncompanions.\"\n\n\"If that means anything at all,\" he reasoned, \"it means that Seyf and\nBedeea are both deceased. Even Jinneeyeh seem to be mortal. Or perhaps\nshe became so by marrying a mortal; I dare say that Fakrash himself\nwouldn't have lasted all this time if he hadn't been bottled, like a\ntinned tomato. But I'm glad I found this out, because Fakrash is\nevidently unaware of it, and, if he _should_ persist in any more of this\nnonsense, I think I see my way now to getting the better of him.\"\n\nSo, with renewed hope and in vastly improved spirits, he went to bed and\nwas soon sound asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. BLUSHING HONOURS\n\n\nIt was rather late the next morning when Ventimore opened his eyes, to\ndiscover the Jinnee standing by the foot of his bed. \"Oh, it's _you_, is\nit?\" he said sleepily. \"How did you--a--get on last night?\"\n\n\"I gained such information as I desired,\" said Fakrash, guardedly; \"and\nnow, for the last time, I am come to ask thee whether thou wilt still\npersist in refusing to wed the illustrious Bedeea-el-Jemal? And have a\ncare how thou answerest.\"\n\n\"So you haven't given up the idea?\" said Horace. \"Well, since you make\nsuch a point of it, I'll meet you as far as this. If you produce the\nlady, and she consents to marry me, I won't decline the honour. But\nthere's one condition I really _must_ insist on.\"\n\n\"It is not for thee to make stipulations. Still, yet this once I will\nhear thee.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you'll see that it's only fair. Supposing, for any reason, you\ncan't persuade the Princess to meet me within a reasonable time--shall\nwe say a week?----\"\n\n\"Thou shalt be admitted to her presence within twenty-four hours,\" said\nthe Jinnee.\n\n\"That's better still. Then, if I don't see her within twenty-four hours,\nI am to be at liberty to infer that the negotiations are off, and I may\nmarry anybody else I please, without any opposition from you? Is that\nunderstood?\"\n\n\"It is agreed,\" said Fakrash, \"for I am confident that Bedeea will\naccept thee joyfully.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Horace. \"But it might be as well if you went and\nprepared her a little. I suppose you know where to find her--and you've\nonly twenty-four hours, you know.\"\n\n\"More than is needed,\" answered the Jinnee, with such childlike\nconfidence, that Horace felt almost ashamed of so easy a victory. \"But\nthe sun is already high. Arise, my son, put on these robes\"--and with\nthis he flung on the bed the magnificent raiment which Ventimore had\nlast worn on the night of his disastrous entertainment--\"and when thou\nhast broken thy fast, prepare to accompany me.\"\n\n\"Before I agree to that,\" said Horace, sitting up in bed, \"I should like\nto know where you're taking me to.\"\n\n\"Obey me without demur,\" said Fakrash, \"or thou knowest the\nconsequences.\"\n\nIt seemed to Horace that it was as well to humour him, and he got up\naccordingly, washed and shaved, and, putting on his dazzling robe of\ncloth-of-gold thickly sewn with gems, he joined Fakrash--who, by the\nway, was similarly, if less gorgeously, arrayed--in the sitting-room, in\na state of some mystification.\n\n\"Eat quickly,\" commanded the Jinnee, \"for the time is short.\" And\nHorace, after hastily disposing of a cold poached egg and a cup of\ncoffee, happened to go to the windows.\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" he cried. \"What does all this mean?\"\n\nHe might well ask. On the opposite side of the road, by the railings of\nthe square, a large crowd had collected, all staring at the house in\neager expectation. As they caught sight of him they raised a cheer,\nwhich caused him to retreat in confusion, but not before he had seen a\ngreat golden chariot with six magnificent coal-black horses, and a suite\nof swarthy attendants in barbaric liveries, standing by the pavement\nbelow. \"Whose carriage is that?\" he asked.\n\n\"It belongs to thee,\" said the Jinnee; \"descend then, and make thy\nprogress in it through the City.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" said Horace. \"Even to oblige you I simply can't drive\nalong the streets in a thing like the band-chariot of a travelling\ncircus.\"\n\n\"It is necessary,\" declared Fakrash. \"Must I again recall to thee the\npenalty of disobedience?\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Horace, irritably. \"If you insist on my making a\nfool of myself, I suppose I must. But where am I to drive, and why?\"\n\n\"That,\" replied Fakrash, \"thou shalt discover at the fitting moment.\"\nAnd so, amidst the shouts of the spectators, Ventimore climbed up into\nthe strange-looking vehicle, while the Jinnee took his seat by his side.\nHorace had a parting glimpse of Mr. and Mrs. Rapkin's respective noses\nflattened against the basement window, and then two dusky slaves mounted\nto a seat at the back of the chariot, and the horses started off at a\nstately trot in the direction of Rochester Row.\n\n\"I think you might tell me what all this means,\" he said. \"You've no\nconception what an ass I feel, stuck up here like this!\"\n\n\"Dismiss bashfulness from thee, since all this is designed to render\nthee more acceptable in the eyes of the Princess Bedeea,\" said the\nJinnee.\n\nHorace said no more, though he could not but think that this parade\nwould be thrown away.\n\nBut as they turned into Victoria Street and seemed to be heading\nstraight for the Abbey, a horrible thought occurred to him. After all,\nhis only authority for the marriage and decease of Bedeea was the\n\"Arabian Nights,\" which was not unimpeachable evidence. What if she were\nalive and waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom? No one but Fakrash\nwould have conceived such an idea as marrying him to a Jinneeyeh in\nWestminster Abbey; but he was capable of any extravagance, and there\nwere apparently no limits to his power.\n\n\"Mr. Fakrash,\" he said hoarsely, \"surely this isn't my--my wedding day?\nYou're not going to have the ceremony _there_?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Jinnee, \"be not impatient. For this edifice would be\ntotally unfitted for the celebration of such nuptials as thine.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the chariot left the Abbey on the right and turned down the\nEmbankment. The relief was so intense that Horace's spirits rose\nirrepressibly. It was absurd to suppose that even Fakrash could have\narranged the ceremony in so short a time. He was merely being taken for\na drive, and fortunately his best friends could not recognise him in his\nOriental disguise. And it was a glorious morning, with a touch of frost\nin the air and a sky of streaky turquoise and pale golden clouds; the\nbroad river glittered in the sunshine; the pavements were lined with\nadmiring crowds, and the carriage rolled on amidst frantic enthusiasm,\nlike some triumphal car.\n\n\"How they're cheering us!\" said Horace. \"Why, they couldn't make more\nrow for the Lord Mayor himself.\"\n\n\"What is this Lord Mayor of whom thou speakest?\" inquired Fakrash.\n\n\"The Lord Mayor?\" said Horace. \"Oh, he's unique. There's nobody in the\nworld quite like him. He administers the law, and if there's any\ndistress in any part of the earth he relieves it. He entertains monarchs\nand Princes and all kinds of potentates at his banquets, and altogether\nhe's a tremendous swell.\"\n\n\"Hath he dominion over the earth and the air and all that is therein?\"\n\n\"Within his own precincts, I believe he has,\" said Horace, rather\nlazily, \"but I really don't know precisely how wide his powers are.\" He\nwas vainly trying to recollect whether such matters as sky-signs,\ntelephones, and telegraphs in the City were within the Lord Mayor's\njurisdiction or the County Council's.\n\nFakrash remained silent just as they were driving underneath Charing\nCross Railway Bridge, when he started perceptibly at the thunder of the\ntrains overhead and the piercing whistles of the engines. \"Tell me,\" he\nsaid, clutching Horace by the arm, \"what meaneth this?\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say,\" said Horace, \"that you have been about London\nall these days, and never noticed things like these before?\"\n\n\"Till now,\" said the Jinnee, \"I have had no leisure to observe them and\ndiscover their nature.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, anxious to let the Jinnee see that he had not the\nmonopoly of miracles, \"since your days we have discovered how to tame or\nchain the great forces of Nature and compel them to do our will. We\ncontrol the Spirits of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, and make them give\nus light and heat, carry our messages, fight our quarrels for us,\ntransport us wherever we wish to go, with a certainty and precision that\nthrow even your performances, my dear sir, entirely into the shade.\"\n\nConsidering what a very large majority of civilised persons would be as\npowerless to construct the most elementary machine as to create the\nhumblest kind of horse, it is not a little odd how complacently we\ncredit ourselves with all the latest achievements of our generation.\nMost of us accept the amazement of the simple-minded barbarian on his\nfirst introduction to modern inventions as a gratifying personal\ntribute: we feel a certain superiority, even if we magnanimously refrain\nfrom boastfulness. And yet our own particular share in these discoveries\nis limited to making use of them under expert guidance, which any\nbarbarian, after overcoming his first terror, is quite as competent to\ndo as we are.\n\nIt is a harmless vanity enough, and especially pardonable in Ventimore's\ncase, when it was so desirable to correct any tendency to \"uppishness\"\non the part of the Jinnee.\n\n\"And doth the Lord Mayor dispose of these forces at his will?\" inquired\nFakrash, on whom Ventimore's explanation had evidently produced some\nimpression.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Horace; \"whenever he has occasion.\"\n\nThe Jinnee seemed engrossed in his own thoughts, for he said no more\njust then.\n\nThey were now nearing St. Paul's Cathedral, and Horace's first suspicion\nreturned with double force.\n\n\"Mr. Fakrash, answer me,\" he said. \"Is this my wedding day or not? If it\nis, it's time I was told!\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said the Jinnee, enigmatically, and indeed it proved to be\nanother false alarm, for they turned down Cannon Street and towards the\nMansion House.\n\n\"Perhaps you can tell me why we're going through Victoria Street, and\nwhat all this crowd has come out for?\" asked Ventimore. For the throng\nwas denser than ever; the people surged and swayed in serried ranks\nbehind the City police, and gazed with a wonder and awe that for once\nseemed to have entirely silenced the Cockney instinct of _persiflage_.\n\n\"For what else but to do thee honour?\" answered Fakrash.\n\n\"What bosh!\" said Horace. \"They mistake me for the Shah or somebody--and\nno wonder, in this get-up.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said the Jinnee. \"Thy names are familiar to them.\"\n\nHorace glanced up at the hastily improvised decorations; on one large\nstrip of bunting which spanned the street he read: \"Welcome to the\nCity's most distinguished guest!\" \"They can't mean me,\" he thought; and\nthen another legend caught his eye: \"Well done, Ventimore!\" And an\nenthusiastic householder next door had burst into poetry and displayed\nthe couplet--\n\n\n    \"Would we had twenty more\n    Like Horace Ventimore!\"\n\n\n\"They _do_ mean me!\" he exclaimed. \"Now, Mr. Fakrash, _will_ you kindly\nexplain what tomfoolery you've been up to now? I know you're at the\nbottom of this business.\"\n\nIt struck him that the Jinnee was slightly embarrassed. \"Didst thou not\nsay,\" he replied, \"that he who should receive the freedom of the City\nfrom his fellow-men would be worthy of Bedeea-el-Jemal?\"\n\n\"I may have said something of the sort. But, good heavens! you don't\nmean that you have contrived that _I_ should receive the freedom of the\nCity?\"\n\n\"It was the easiest affair possible,\" said the Jinnee, but he did not\nattempt to meet Horace's eye.\n\n\"Was it, though?\" said Horace, in a white rage. \"I don't want to be\ninquisitive, but I should like to know what I've done to deserve it?\"\n\n\"Why trouble thyself with the reason? Let it suffice thee that such\nhonour is bestowed upon thee.\"\n\nBy this time the chariot had crossed Cheapside and was entering King\nStreet.\n\n\"This really won't do!\" urged Horace. \"It's not fair to me. Either I've\ndone something, or you must have made the Corporation _believe_ I've\ndone something, to be received like this. And, as we shall be in the\nGuildhall in a very few seconds, you may as well tell me what it is!\"\n\n\"Regarding that matter,\" replied the Jinnee, in some confusion, \"I am\ntruly as ignorant as thyself.\"\n\nAs he spoke they drove through some temporary wooden gates into the\ncourtyard, where the Honourable Artillery Company presented arms to\nthem, and the carriage drew up before a large marquee decorated with\nshields and clustered banners.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Fakrash,\" said Horace, with suppressed fury, as he alighted,\n\"you have surpassed yourself this time. You've got me into a nice\nscrape, and you'll have to pull me through it as well as you can.\"\n\n\"Have no uneasiness,\" said the Jinnee, as he accompanied his _protégé_\ninto the marquee, which was brilliant with pretty women in smart frocks,\nofficers in scarlet tunics and plumed hats, and servants in State\nliveries.\n\nTheir entrance was greeted by a politely-subdued buzz of applause and\nadmiration, and an official, who introduced himself as the Prime Warden\nof the Candlestick-makers' Company, advanced to meet them. \"The Lord\nMayor will receive you in the library,\" he said. \"If you will have the\nkindness to follow me----\"\n\nHorace followed him mechanically. \"I'm in for it now,\" he thought,\n\"whatever it is. If I can only trust Fakrash to back me up--but I'm\nhanged if I don't believe he's more nervous than I am!\"\n\nAs they came into the noble Library of the Guildhall a fine string band\nstruck up, and Horace, with the Jinnee in his rear, made his way through\na lane of distinguished spectators towards a dais, on the steps of\nwhich, in his gold-trimmed robes and black-feather hat, stood the Lord\nMayor, with his sword and mace-bearers on either hand, and behind him a\nrow of beaming sheriffs.\n\nA truly stately and imposing figure did the Chief Magistrate for that\nparticular year present: tall, dignified, with a lofty forehead whose\npolished temples reflected the light, an aquiline nose, and piercing\nblack eyes under heavy white eyebrows, a frosty pink in his wrinkled\ncheeks, and a flowing silver beard with a touch of gold still lingering\nunder the lower lip: he seemed, as he stood there, a worthy\nrepresentative of the greatest and richest city in the world.\n\nHorace approached the steps with an unpleasant sensation of weakness at\nthe knees, and no sort of idea what he was expected to do or say when he\narrived.\n\nAnd, in his perplexity, he turned for support and guidance to his\nself-constituted mentor--only to discover that the Jinnee, whose\nshort-sightedness and ignorance had planted him in this present false\nposition, had mysteriously and perfidiously disappeared, and left him to\ngrapple with the situation single-handed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. A KILLING FROST\n\n\nFortunately for Ventimore, the momentary dismay he had felt on\nfinding himself deserted by his unfathomable Jinnee at the very\noutset of the ceremony passed unnoticed, as the Prime Warden of the\nCandlestick-makers' Company immediately came to his rescue by briefly\nintroducing him to the Lord Mayor, who, with dignified courtesy, had\ndescended to the lowest step of the dais to receive him.\n\n\"Mr. Ventimore,\" said the Chief Magistrate, cordially, as he pressed\nHorace's hand, \"you must allow me to say that I consider this one of the\ngreatest privileges--if not _the_ greatest privilege--that have fallen\nto my lot during a term of office in which I have had the honour of\nwelcoming more than the usual number of illustrious visitors.\"\n\n\"My Lord Mayor,\" said Horace, with absolute sincerity, \"you really\noverwhelm me. I--I only wish I could feel that I had done anything to\ndeserve this--this magnificent compliment!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" replied the Lord Mayor, in a paternally rallying tone. \"Modest, my\ndear sir, I perceive. Like all truly great men! A most admirable trait!\nPermit me to present you to the Sheriffs.\"\n\nThe Sheriffs appeared highly delighted. Horace shook hands with both of\nthem; indeed, in the flurry of the moment he very nearly offered to do\nso with the Sword and Mace bearers as well, but their hands were, as it\nhappened, otherwise engaged.\n\n\"The actual presentation,\" said the Lord Mayor, \"takes place in the\nGreat Hall, as you are doubtless aware.\"\n\n\"I--I have been given to understand so,\" said Horace, with a sinking\nheart--for he had begun to hope that the worst was over.\n\n\"But before we adjourn,\" said his host, \"you will let me tempt you to\npartake of some slight refreshment--just a snack?\"\n\nHorace was not hungry, but it occurred to him that he might get through\nthe ceremony with more credit after a glass of champagne; so he accepted\nthe invitation, and was conducted to an extemporised buffet at one end\nof the Library, where he fortified himself for the impending ordeal with\na _caviare_ sandwich and a bumper of the driest champagne in the\nCorporation cellars.\n\n\"They talk of abolishing us,\" said the Lord Mayor, as he took an anchovy\non toast; \"but I maintain, Mr. Ventimore--I maintain that we, with our\nancient customs, our time-honoured traditions, form a link with the\npast, which a wise statesman will preserve, if I may employ a somewhat\nvulgar term, untinkered with.\"\n\nHorace agreed, remembering a link with a far more ancient past with\nwhich he devoutly wished he had refrained from tinkering.\n\n\"Talking of ancient customs,\" the Lord Mayor continued, with an odd\nblend of pride and apology, \"you will shortly have an illustration of\nour antiquated procedure, which may impress you as quaint.\"\n\nHorace, feeling absolutely idiotic, murmured that he felt sure it would\ndo that.\n\n\"Before presenting you for the freedom, the Prime Warden and five\nofficials of the Candlestick-makers' Company will give their testimony\nas compurgators in your favour, making oath that you are 'a man of good\nname and fame,' and that (you will be amused at this, Mr.\nVentimore)--that you 'do desire the freedom of this city, whereby to\ndefraud the Queen or the City.' Ha, ha! Curious way of putting it, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Very,\" said Horace, guiltily, and not a little concerned on the\nofficial's account.\n\n\"A mere form!\" said the Lord Mayor; \"but I for one, Mr. Ventimore--I for\none should be sorry to see the picturesque old practices die out. To my\nmind,\" he added, as he finished a _pâté de foie gras_ sandwich, \"the\nmodern impatience to sweep away all the ancient landmarks (whether they\nbe superannuated or not) is one of the most disquieting symptoms of the\nage. You won't have any more champagne? Then I think we had better be\nmaking our way to the Great Hall for the Event of the Day.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Horace, with a sudden consciousness of his\nincongruously Oriental attire--\"I'm afraid this is not quite the sort of\ndress for such a ceremony. If I had known----\"\n\n\"Now, don't say another word!\" said the Lord Mayor. \"Your costume is\nvery nice--very nice indeed, and--and most appropriate, I am sure. But I\nsee the City Marshal is waiting for us to head the procession. Shall we\nlead the way?\"\n\nThe band struck up the March of the Priests from _Athalie_, and Horace,\nhis head in a whirl, walked with his host, followed by the City Lands\nCommittee, the Sheriffs, and other dignitaries, through the Art Gallery\nand into the Great Hall, where their entrance was heralded by a flourish\nof trumpets.\n\nThe Hall was crowded, and Ventimore found himself the object of a\npopular demonstration which would have filled him with joy and pride if\nhe could only have felt that he had done anything whatever to justify\nit, for it was ridiculous to suppose that he had rendered himself a\npublic benefactor by restoring a convicted Jinnee to freedom and society\ngenerally.\n\nHis only consolation was that the English are a race not given to\neffusiveness without very good reason, and that before the ceremony was\nover he would be enabled to gather what were the particular services\nwhich had excited such unbounded enthusiasm.\n\nMeanwhile he stood there on the crimson-draped and flower-bedecked dais,\nbowing repeatedly, and trusting that he did not look so forlornly\nfoolish as he felt. A long shaft of sunlight struck down between the\nGothic rafters, and dappled the brown stone walls with patches of gold;\nthe electric lights in the big hooped chandeliers showed pale and feeble\nagainst the subdued glow of the stained glass; the air was heavy with\nthe scent of flowers and essences. Then there was a rustle of\nexpectation in the audience, and a pause, in which it seemed to Horace\nthat everybody on the dais was almost as nervous and at a loss what to\ndo next as he was himself. He wished with all his soul that they would\nhurry the ceremony through, anyhow, and let him go.\n\nAt length the proceedings began by a sort of solemn affectation of\nhaving merely met there for the ordinary business of the day, which to\nHorace just then seemed childish in the extreme; it was resolved that\n\"items 1 to 4 on the agenda need not be discussed,\" which brought them\nto item 5.\n\nItem 5 was a resolution, read by the Town Clerk, that \"the freedom of\nthe City should be presented to Horace Ventimore, Esq., Citizen and\nCandlestick-maker\" (which last Horace was not aware of being, but\nsupposed vaguely that it had been somehow managed while he was at the\nbuffet in the Library), \"in recognition of his services\"--the resolution\nran, and Horace listened with all his ears--\"especially in connection\nwith ...\" It was most unfortunate--but at this precise point the\nofficial was seized with an attack of coughing, in which all was lost\nbut the conclusion of the sentence, \" ... that have justly entitled him\nto the gratitude and admiration of his fellow-countrymen.\"\n\nThen the six compurgators came forward and vouched for Ventimore's\nfitness to receive the freedom. He had painful doubts whether they\naltogether understood what a responsibility they were undertaking--but\nit was too late to warn them and he could only trust that they knew more\nof their business than he did.\n\nAfter this the City Chamberlain read him an address, to which Horace\nlistened in resigned bewilderment. The Chamberlain referred to the\nunanimity and enthusiasm with which the resolution had been carried, and\nsaid that it was his pleasing and honourable duty, as the mouthpiece of\nthat ancient City, to address what he described with some inadequacy as\n\"a few words\" to one by adding whose name to their roll of freemen the\nCorporation honoured rather themselves than the recipient of their\nhomage.\n\nIt was flattering, but to Horace's ear the phrases sounded excessive,\nalmost fulsome--though, of course, that depended very much on what he\nhad done, which he had still to ascertain. The orator proceeded to read\nhim the \"Illustrious List of London's Roll of Fame,\" a recital which\nmade Horace shiver with apprehension. For what names they were! What\nglorious deeds they had performed! How was it possible that he--plain\nHorace Ventimore, a struggling architect who had missed his one great\nchance--could have achieved (especially without even being aware of it)\nanything that would not seem ludicrously insignificant by comparison?\n\nHe had a morbid fancy that the marble goddesses, or whoever they were,\nat the base of Nelson's monument opposite, were regarding him with stony\ndisdain and indignation; that the statue of Wellington knew him for an\narrant impostor, and averted his head with cold contempt; and that the\neffigy of Lord Mayor Beckford on the right of the dais would come to\nlife and denounce him in another moment.\n\n\"Turning now to your own distinguished services,\" he suddenly heard the\nCity Chamberlain resuming, \"you are probably aware, sir, that it is\ncustomary on these occasions to mention specifically the particular\nmerit which had been deemed worthy of civic recognition.\"\n\nHorace was greatly relieved to hear it, for it struck him as a most\nsensible and, in his own particular case, essential formality.\n\n\"But, on the present occasion, sir,\" proceeded the speaker, \"I feel, as\nall present must feel, that it would be unnecessary--nay, almost\nimpertinent--were I to weary the public ear by a halting recapitulation\nof deeds with which it is already so appreciatively familiar.\" At this\nhe was interrupted by deafening and long-continued applause, at the end\nof which he continued: \"I have only therefore, to greet you in the name\nof the Corporation, and to offer you the right hand of fellowship as a\nFreeman, and Citizen, and Candlestick-maker of London.\"\n\nAs he shook hands he presented Horace with a copy of the Oath of\nAllegiance, intimating that he was to read it aloud. Naturally,\nVentimore had not the least objection to swear to be good and true to\nour Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria, or to be obedient to the Lord Mayor,\nand warn him of any conspiracies against the Queen's peace which might\nchance to come under his observation; so he took the oath cheerfully\nenough, and hoped that this was really the end of the ceremony.\n\nHowever, to his great chagrin and apprehension, the Lord Mayor rose with\nthe evident intention of making a speech. He said that the conclusion of\nthe City to bestow the highest honour in their gift upon Mr. Horace\nVentimore had been--here he hesitated--somewhat hastily arrived at.\nPersonally, he would have liked a longer time to prepare, to make the\ndisplay less inadequate to, and worthier of, this exceptional occasion.\nHe thought that was the general feeling. (It evidently was, judging from\nthe loud and unanimous cheering). However, for reasons which--for\nreasons with which they were as well acquainted as himself, the notice\nhad been short. The Corporation had yielded (as they always did, as it\nwould always be their pride and pleasure to yield) to popular pressure\nwhich was practically irresistible, and had done the best they could in\nthe limited--he might almost say the unprecedentedly limited--period\nallowed them. The proudest leaf in Mr. Ventimore's chaplet of laurels\nto-day was, he would venture to assert, the sight of the extraordinary\nenthusiasm and assemblage, not only in that noble hall, but in the\nthoroughfares of this mighty Metropolis. Under the circumstances, this\nwas a marvellous tribute to the admiration and affection which Mr.\nVentimore had succeeded in inspiring in the great heart of the people,\nrich and poor, high and low. He would not detain his hearers any longer;\nall that remained for him to do was to ask Mr. Ventimore's acceptance of\na golden casket containing the roll of freedom, and he felt sure that\ntheir distinguished guest, before proceeding to inscribe his name on the\nregister, would oblige them all by some account from his own lips of--of\nthe events in which he had figured so prominently and so creditably.\n\nHorace received the casket mechanically; there was a universal cry of\n\"Speech!\" from the audience, to which he replied by shaking his head in\nhelpless deprecation--but in vain; he found himself irresistibly pressed\ntowards the rail in front of the dais, and the roar of applause which\ngreeted him saved him from all necessity of attempting to speak for\nnearly two minutes.\n\nDuring that interval he had time to clear his brain and think what he\nhad better do or say in his present unenviable dilemma. For some time\npast a suspicion had been growing in his mind, until it had now almost\nswollen into certainty. He felt that, before he compromised himself, or\nallowed his too generous entertainers to compromise themselves\nirretrievably, it was absolutely necessary to ascertain his real\nposition, and, to do that, he must make some sort of speech. With this\nresolve, all his nervousness and embarrassment and indecision melted\naway; he faced the assembly coolly and gallantly, convinced that his\nbest alternative now lay in perfect candour.\n\n\"My Lord Mayor, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,\" he began, in a clear\nvoice which penetrated to the farthest gallery and commanded instant\nattention. \"If you expect to hear from me any description of what I've\ndone to be received like this, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. For\nmy own belief is that I've done nothing whatever.\"\n\nThere was a general outcry of \"No, no!\" at this, and a fervid murmur of\nprotest.\n\n\"It's all very well to say 'No, no,'\" said Horace, \"and I am extremely\ngrateful to you all for the interruption. Still, I can only repeat that\nI am absolutely unaware of having ever rendered my Country, or this\ngreat City, a single service deserving of the slightest acknowledgment.\nI wish I could feel I had--but the truth is that, if I have, the fact\nhas entirely slipped from my memory.\"\n\nAgain there were murmurs, this time with a certain under-current of\nirritation; and he could hear the Lord Mayor behind him remarking to the\nCity Chamberlain that this was not at all the kind of speech for the\noccasion.\n\n\"I know what you're thinking,\" said Horace. \"You're thinking this is\nmock modesty on my part. But it's nothing of the sort. _I_ don't know\nwhat I've done--but I presume you are all better informed. Because the\nCorporation wouldn't have given me that very charming casket--you\nwouldn't all of you be here like this--unless you were under a strong\nimpression that I'd done _something_ to deserve it.\" At this there was a\nfresh outburst of applause. \"Just so,\" said Horace, calmly. \"Well, now,\nwill any of you be kind enough to tell me, in a few words, _what_ you\nsuppose I've done?\"\n\nThere was a dead silence, in which every one looked at his or her\nneighbour and smiled feebly.\n\n\"My Lord Mayor,\" continued Horace, \"I appeal to you to tell me and this\ndistinguished assembly why on earth we're all here!\"\n\nThe Lord Mayor rose. \"I think it sufficient to say,\" he announced with\ndignity, \"that the Corporation and myself were unanimously of opinion\nthat this distinction should be awarded--for reasons which it is\nunnecessary and--hum--ha--invidious to enter into here.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" persisted Horace, \"but I must press your lordship for\nthose reasons. I have an object.... Will the City Chamberlain oblige me,\nthen?... No? Well, then, the Town Clerk?... No?--it's just as I\nsuspected: none of you can give me your reasons, and shall I tell you\nwhy? Because there _aren't_ any.... Now, do bear with me for a moment.\nI'm quite aware this is very embarrassing for all of you--but remember\nthat it's infinitely more awkward for _me_! I really cannot accept the\nfreedom of the City under any suspicion of false pretences. It would be\na poor reward for your hospitality, and base and unpatriotic into the\nbargain, to depreciate the value of so great a distinction by permitting\nit to be conferred unworthily. If, after you've heard what I am going to\ntell you, you still insist on my accepting such an honour, of course I\nwill not be so ungracious as to refuse it. But I really don't feel that\nit would be right to inscribe my name on your Roll of Fame without some\nsort of explanation. If I did, I might, for anything I know,\ninvoluntarily be signing the death-warrant of the Corporation!\"\n\nThere was a breathless hush upon this; the silence grew so intense that\nto borrow a slightly involved metaphor from a distinguished friend of\nthe writer's, you might have picked up a pin in it! Horace leaned\nsideways against the rail in an easy attitude, so as to face the Lord\nMayor, as well as a portion of his audience.\n\n\"Before I go any farther,\" he said, \"will your lordship pardon me if I\nsuggest that it might be as well to direct that all reporters present\nshould immediately withdraw?\"\n\nThe reporters' table was instantly in a stir of anger, and many of the\nguests expressed some dissatisfaction. \"We, at least,\" said the Lord\nMayor, rising, flushed with annoyance, \"have no reason to dread\npublicity. I decline to make a hole-and-corner affair of this. I shall\ngive no such orders.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Horace, when the chorus of approval had subsided. \"My\nsuggestion was made quite as much in the Corporation's interests as\nmine. I merely thought that, when you all clearly understood how grossly\nyou've been deluded, you might prefer to have the details kept out of\nthe newspapers if possible. But if you particularly want them published\nover the whole world, why, of course----\"\n\nAn uproar followed here, under cover of which the Lord Mayor contrived\nto give orders to have the doors fastened till further directions.\n\n\"Don't make this more difficult and disagreeable for me than it is\nalready!\" said Horace, as soon as he could obtain a hearing again. \"You\ndon't suppose that I should have come here in this Tom-fool's dress,\nimposing myself on the hospitality of this great City, if I could have\nhelped it! If you've been brought here under false pretences, so have I.\nIf you've been made to look rather foolish, what is _your_ situation to\nmine? The fact is, I am the victim of a headstrong force which I am\nutterly unable to control....\"\n\nUpon this a fresh uproar arose, and prevented him from continuing for\nsome time. \"I only ask for fair play and a patient hearing!\" he pleaded.\n\"Give me that, and I will undertake to restore you all to good humour\nbefore I have done.\"\n\nThey calmed down at this appeal, and he was able to proceed. \"My case is\nsimply this,\" he said. \"A little time ago I happened to go to an auction\nand buy a large brass bottle....\"\n\nFor some inexplicable reason his last words roused the audience to\nabsolute frenzy; they would not hear anything about the brass bottle.\nEvery time he attempted to mention it they howled him down, they hissed,\nthey groaned, they shook their fists; the din was positively deafening.\n\nNor was the demonstration confined to the male portion of the assembly.\nOne lady, indeed, who is a prominent leader in society, but whose name\nshall not be divulged here, was so carried away by her feelings as to\nhurl a heavy cut-glass bottle of smelling-salts at Horace's offending\nhead. Fortunately for him, it missed him and only caught one of the\nofficials (Horace was not in a mood to notice details very accurately,\nbut he had a notion that it was the City Remembrancer) somewhere about\nthe region of the watch-pocket.\n\n\"_Will_ you hear me out?\" Ventimore shouted. \"I'm not trifling. I\nhaven't told you yet what was inside the bottle. When I opened it, I\nfound ...\"\n\nHe got no farther--for, as the words left his lips, he felt himself\nseized by the collar of his robe and lifted off his feet by an agency he\nwas powerless to resist.\n\nUp and up he was carried, past the great chandeliers, between the carved\nand gilded rafters, pursued by a universal shriek of dismay and horror.\nDown below he could see the throng of pale, upturned faces, and hear the\nwild screams and laughter of several ladies of great distinction in\nviolent hysterics. And the next moment he was in the glass lantern, and\nthe latticed panes gave way like tissue paper as he broke through into\nthe open air, causing the pigeons on the roof to whirr up in a flutter\nof alarm.\n\nOf course, he knew that it was the Jinnee who was abducting him in this\nsensational manner, and he was rather relieved than alarmed by Fakrash's\nsummary proceeding, for he seemed, for once, to have hit upon the best\nway out of a situation that was rapidly becoming impossible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. HIGH WORDS\n\n\nOnce outside in the open air, the Jinnee \"towered\" like a pheasant shot\nthrough the breast, and Horace closed his eyes with a combined\nswing-switchback-and-Channel-passage sensation during a flight which\napparently continued for hours, although in reality it probably did not\noccupy more than a very few seconds. His uneasiness was still further\nincreased by his inability to guess where he was being taken to--for he\nfelt instinctively that they were not travelling in the direction of\nhome.\n\nAt last he felt himself set down on some hard, firm surface, and\nventured to open his eyes once more. When he realised where he actually\nwas, his knees gave way under him, and he was seized with a sudden\ngiddiness that very nearly made him lose his balance. For he found\nhimself standing on a sort of narrow ledge or cornice immediately under\nthe ball at the top of St. Paul's.\n\nMany feet beneath him spread the dull, leaden summit of the dome, its\nraised ridges stretching, like huge serpents over the curve, beyond\nwhich was a glimpse of the green roof of the nave and the two west\ntowers, with their grey columns and urn-topped buttresses and gilded\npineapples, which shone ruddily in the sun.\n\nHe had an impression of Ludgate Hill and Fleet Street as a deep, winding\nravine, steeped in partial shadow; of long sierras of roofs and\nchimney-pots, showing their sharp outlines above mouse-coloured\nsmoke-wreaths; of the broad, pearl-tinted river, with oily ripples and a\ngolden glitter where the sunlight touched it; of the gleaming slope of\nmud under the wharves and warehouses on the Surrey side; of barges and\nsteamers moored in black clusters; of a small tug fussing noisily down\nthe river, leaving a broadening arrow-head in its wake.\n\nCautiously he moved round towards the east, where the houses formed a\nblurred mosaic of cream, slate, indigo, and dull reds and browns, above\nwhich slender rose-flushed spires and towers pierced the haze, stained\nin countless places by pillars of black, grey, and amber smoke, and\nlightened by plumes and jets of silvery steam, till all blended by\nimperceptible gradations into a sky of tenderest gold slashed with\ntranslucent blue.\n\nIt was a magnificent view, and none the less so because the\nindistinctness of all beyond a limited radius made the huge City seem\nnot only mystical, but absolutely boundless in extent. But although\nVentimore was distinctly conscious of all this, he was scarcely in a\nstate to appreciate its grandeur just then. He was much too concerned\nwith wondering why Fakrash had chosen to plant him up there in so\ninsecure a position, and how he was ever to be rescued from it, since\nthe Jinnee had apparently disappeared.\n\nHe was not far off, however, for presently Horace saw him stalk round\nthe narrow cornice with an air of being perfectly at home on it.\n\n\"So there you are!\" said Ventimore; \"I thought you'd deserted me again.\nWhat have you brought me up here for?\"\n\n\"Because I desired to have speech with thee in private,\" replied the\nJinnee.\n\n\"We're not likely to be intruded on here, certainly,\" said Horace. \"But\nisn't it rather exposed, rather public? If we're seen up here, you know,\nit will cause a decided sensation.\"\n\n\"I have laid a spell on all below that they should not raise their\neyes. Be seated, therefore, and hear my words.\"\n\nHorace lowered himself carefully to a sitting position, so that his legs\ndangled in space, and Fakrash took a seat by his side. \"O, most\nindiscreet of mankind!\" he began, in an aggrieved tone; \"thou hast been\nnear the committal of a great blunder, and doing ill to thyself and to\nme!\"\n\n\"Well, I _do_ like that!\" retorted Horace; \"when you let me in for all\nthat freedom of the City business, and then sneaked off, leaving me to\nget out of it the best way I could, and only came back just as I was\nabout to explain matters, and carried me up through the roof like a sack\nof flour. Do you consider that tactful on your part?\"\n\n\"Thou hadst drunk wine and permitted it to creep as far as the place of\nsecrets.\"\n\n\"Only one glass,\" said Horace; \"and I wanted it, I can assure you. I was\nobliged to make a speech to them, and, thanks to you, I was in such a\nhole that I saw nothing for it but to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"Veracity, as thou wilt learn,\" answered the Jinnee, \"is not invariably\nthe Ship of Safety. Thou wert about to betray the benefactor who\nprocured for thee such glory and honour as might well cause the\ngall-bladder of lions to burst with envy!\"\n\n\"If any lion with the least sense of humour could have witnessed the\nproceedings,\" said Ventimore, \"he might have burst with\nlaughter--certainly not envy. Good Lord! Fakrash,\" he cried, in his\nindignation, \"I've never felt such an absolute ass in my whole life! If\nnothing would satisfy you but my receiving the freedom of the City, you\nmight at least have contrived some decent excuse for it! But you left\nout the only point there was in the whole thing--and all for what?\"\n\n\"What doth it signify why the whole populace should come forth to\nacclaim thee and do thee honour, so long as they did so?\" said Fakrash,\nsullenly. \"For the report of thy fame would reach Bedeea-el-Jemal.\"\n\n\"That's just where you're mistaken,\" said Horace. \"If you had not been\nin too desperate a hurry to make a few inquiries, you would have found\nout that you were taking all this trouble for nothing.\"\n\n\"How sayest thou?\"\n\n\"Well, you would have discovered that the Princess is spared all\ntemptation to marry beneath her by the fact that she became the bride of\nsomebody else about thirty centuries ago. She married a mortal, one\nSeyf-el-Mulook, a King's son, and they've both been dead a considerable\ntime--another obstacle to your plans.\"\n\n\"It is a lie,\" declared Fakrash.\n\n\"If you will take me back to Vincent Square, I shall be happy to show\nyou the evidence in your national records,\" said Horace. \"And you may be\nglad to know that your old enemy, Mr. Jarjarees, came to a violent end,\nafter a very sporting encounter with a King's daughter, who, though\nproficient in advanced magic, unfortunately perished herself, poor lady,\nin the final round.\"\n\n\"I had intended _thee_ to accomplish his downfall,\" said Fakrash.\n\n\"I know,\" said Horace. \"It was most thoughtful of you. But I doubt if I\nshould have done it half as well--and it would have probably cost me an\neye, at the very least. It's better as it is.\"\n\n\"And how long hast thou known of these things?\"\n\n\"Only since last night.\"\n\n\"Since last night? And thou didst not unfold them unto me till this\ninstant?\"\n\n\"I've had such a busy morning, you see,\" explained Horace. \"There's been\nno time.\"\n\n\"Silly-bearded fool that I was to bring this misbegotten dog into the\naugust presence of the great Lord Mayor himself (on whom be peace!),\"\ncried the Jinnee.\n\n\"I object to being referred to as a misbegotten dog,\" said Horace, \"but\nwith the rest of your remark I entirely concur. I'm afraid the Lord\nMayor is very far from being at peace just now.\" He pointed to the steep\nroof of the Guildhall, with its dormers and fretted pinnacles, and the\nslender lantern through which he had so lately made his inglorious exit.\n\"There's the devil of a row going on under that lantern just now, Mr.\nFakrash, you may depend upon that. They've locked the doors till they\ncan decide what to do next--which will take them some time. And it's all\nyour fault!\"\n\n\"It was thy doing. Why didst thou dare to inform the Lord Mayor that he\nwas deceived?\"\n\n\"Why? Because I thought he ought to know. Because I was bound,\nparticularly after my oath of allegiance, to warn him of any conspiracy\nagainst him. Because I was in such a hat. He'll understand all that--he\nwon't blame _me_ for this business.\"\n\n\"It is fortunate,\" observed the Jinnee, \"that I flew away with thee\nbefore thou couldst pronounce my name.\"\n\n\"You gave yourself away,\" said Horace. \"They all saw you, you know. You\nweren't flying so particularly fast. They'll recognise you again. If you\n_will_ carry off a man from under the Lord Mayor's very nose, and shoot\nup through the roof like a rocket with him, you can't expect to escape\nsome notice. You see, you happen to be the only unbottled Jinnee in this\nCity.\"\n\nFakrash shifted his seat on the cornice. \"I have committed no act of\ndisrespect unto the Lord Mayor,\" he said, \"therefore he can have no just\ncause of anger against me.\"\n\nHorace perceived that the Jinnee was not altogether at ease, and pushed\nhis advantage accordingly.\n\n\"My dear good old friend,\" he said, \"you don't seem to realise yet what\nan awful thing you've done. For your own mistaken purposes, you have\ncompelled the Chief Magistrate and the Corporation of the greatest City\nin the world to make themselves hopelessly ridiculous. They'll never\nhear the last of this affair. Just look at the crowds waiting patiently\nbelow there. Look at the flags. Think of that gorgeous conveyance of\nyours standing outside the Guildhall. Think of the assembly inside--all\nthe most aristocratic, noble, and distinguished personages in the land,\"\ncontinued Horace, piling it on as he proceeded; \"all collected for what?\nTo be made fools of by a Jinnee out of a brass bottle!\"\n\n\"For their own sakes they will preserve silence,\" said Fakrash, with a\ngleam of unwonted shrewdness.\n\n\"Probably they would hush it up, if they only could,\" conceded Horace.\n\"But how _can_ they? What are they to say? What plausible explanation\ncan they give? Besides, there's the Press: you don't know what the Press\nis; but I assure you its power is tremendous--it's simply impossible to\nkeep anything secret from it nowadays. It has eyes and ears everywhere,\nand a thousand tongues. Five minutes after the doors in that hall are\nunlocked (and they can't keep them locked _much_ longer) the reporters\nwill be handing in their special descriptions of you and your latest\nvagaries to their respective journals. Within half an hour bills will be\ncarried through every quarter of London--bills with enormous letters:\n'Extraordinary Scene at the Guildhall.' 'Strange End to a Civic\nFunction.' 'Startling Appearance of an Oriental Genie in the City.'\n'Abduction of a Guest of the Lord Mayor.' 'Intense Excitement.' 'Full\nParticulars!' And by that time the story will have flashed round the\nwhole world. 'Keep silence,' indeed! Do you imagine for a moment that\nthe Lord Mayor, or anybody else concerned, however remotely, will ever\nforget, or be allowed to forget, such an outrageous incident as this? If\nyou do, believe me, you're mistaken.\"\n\n\"Truly, it would be a terrible thing to incur the wrath of the Lord\nMayor,\" said the Jinnee, in troubled accents.\n\n\"Awful!\" said Horace. \"But you seem to have managed it.\"\n\n\"He weareth round his neck a magic jewel, which giveth him dominion\nover devils--is it not so?\"\n\n\"You know best,\" said Horace.\n\n\"It was the splendour of that jewel and the majesty of his countenance\nthat rendered me afraid to enter his presence, lest he should recognise\nme for what I am and command me to obey him, for verily his might is\ngreater even than Suleyman's, and his hand heavier upon such of the Jinn\nas fall into his power!\"\n\n\"If that's so,\" said Horace, \"I should strongly advise you to find some\nway of putting things straight before it's too late--you've no time to\nlose.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest well,\" said Fakrash, springing to his feet, and turning his\nface towards Cheapside. Horace shuffled himself along the ledge in a\nseated position after the Jinnee, and, looking down between his feet,\ncould just see the tops of the thin and rusty trees in the churchyard,\nthe black and serried swarms of foreshortened people in the street, and\nthe scarlet-rimmed mouths of chimney-pots on the tiled roofs below.\n\n\"There is but one remedy I know,\" said the Jinnee, \"and it may be that I\nhave lost power to perform it. Yet will I make the endeavour.\" And,\nstretching forth his right hand towards the east, he muttered some kind\nof command or invocation.\n\nHorace almost fell off the cornice with apprehension of what might\nfollow. Would it be a thunderbolt, a plague, some frightful convulsion\nof Nature? He felt sure that Fakrash would hesitate at no means, however\nviolent, of burying all traces of his blunder in oblivion, and very\nlittle hope that, whatever he did, it would prove anything but some\nworse indiscretion than his previous performances.\n\nHappily none of these extreme measures seemed to have occurred to the\nJinnee, though what followed was strange and striking enough.\n\nFor presently, as if in obedience to the Jinnee's weird gesticulations,\na lurid belt of fog came rolling up from the direction of the Royal\nExchange, swallowing up building after building in its rapid course; one\nby one the Guildhall, Bow Church, Cheapside itself, and the churchyard\ndisappeared, and Horace, turning his head to the left, saw the murky\ntide sweeping on westward, blotting out Ludgate Hill, the Strand,\nCharing Cross, and Westminster--till at last he and Fakrash were alone\nabove a limitless plain of bituminous cloud, the only living beings\nleft, as it seemed, in a blank and silent universe.\n\n\"Look again!\" said Fakrash, and Horace, looking eastward, saw the spire\nof Bow Church, rosy once more, the Guildhall standing clear and intact,\nand the streets and house-tops gradually reappearing. Only the flags,\nwith their unrestful shiver and ripple of colour, had disappeared, and,\nwith them, the waiting crowds and the mounted constables. The ordinary\ntraffic of vans, omnibuses, and cabs was proceeding as though it had\nnever been interrupted--the clank and jingle of harness chains, the\ncries and whip-crackings of drivers, rose with curious distinctness\nabove the incessant trampling roar which is the ground-swell of the\nhuman ocean.\n\n\"That cloud which thou sawest,\" said Fakrash, \"hath swept away with it\nall memory of this affair from the minds of every mortal assembled to do\nthee honour. See, they go about their several businesses, and all the\npast incidents are to them as though they had never been.\"\n\nIt was not often that Horace could honestly commend any performance of\nthe Jinnee's, but at this he could not restrain his admiration. \"By\nJove!\" he said, \"that certainly gets the Lord Mayor and everybody else\nout of the mess as neatly as possible. I must say, Mr. Fakrash, it's\nmuch the best thing I've seen you do yet.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said the Jinnee, \"for presently thou shalt see me perform a yet\nmore excellent thing.\"\n\nThere was a most unpleasant green glow in his eyes and a bristle in his\nthin beard as he spoke, which suddenly made Horace feel uncomfortable.\nHe did not like the look of the Jinnee at all.\n\n\"I really think you've done enough for to-day,\" he said. \"And this wind\nup here is rather searching. I shan't be sorry to find myself on the\nground again.\"\n\n\"That,\" replied the Jinnee, \"thou shalt assuredly do before long, O\nimpudent and deceitful wretch!\" And he laid a long, lean hand on\nHorace's shoulder.\n\n\"He _is_ put out about something!\" thought Ventimore. \"But what?\" \"My\ndear sir,\" he said aloud, \"I don't understand this tone of yours. What\nhave I done to offend you?\"\n\n\"Divinely gifted was he who said: 'Beware of losing hearts in\nconsequence of injury, for the bringing them back after flight is\ndifficult.'\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said Horace. \"But I don't quite see the application.\"\n\n\"The application,\" explained the Jinnee, \"is that I am determined to\ncast thee down from here with my own hand!\"\n\nHorace turned faint and dizzy for a moment. Then, by a strong effort of\nwill, he pulled himself together. \"Oh, come now,\" he said, \"you don't\nreally mean that, you know. After all your kindness! You're much too\ngood-natured to be capable of anything so atrocious.\"\n\n\"All pity hath been eradicated from my heart,\" returned Fakrash.\n\"Therefore prepare to die, for thou art presently about to perish in the\nmost unfortunate manner.\"\n\nVentimore could not repress a shudder. Hitherto he had never been able\nto take Fakrash quite seriously, in spite of all his supernatural\npowers; he had treated him with a half-kindly, half-contemptuous\ntolerance, as a well-meaning, but hopelessly incompetent, old foozle.\nThat the Jinnee should ever become malevolent towards him had never\nentered his head till now--and yet he undoubtedly had. How was he to\ncajole and disarm this formidable being? He must keep cool and act\npromptly, or he would never see Sylvia again.\n\nAs he sat there on the narrow ledge, with a faint and not unpleasant\nsmell of hops saluting his nostrils from some distant brewery, he tried\nhard to collect his thoughts, but could not. He found himself, instead,\nidly watching the busy, jostling crowd below, who were all unconscious\nof the impending drama so high above them. Just over the rim of the dome\nhe could see the opaque white top of a lamp on a shelter, where a pigmy\nconstable stood, directing the traffic.\n\nWould he look up if Horace called for help? Even if he could, what help\ncould he render? All he could do would be to keep the crowd back and\nsend for a covered stretcher. No, he would _not_ dwell on these horrors;\nhe _must_ fix his mind on some way of circumventing Fakrash.\n\nHow did the people in \"The Arabian Nights\" manage? The fisherman, for\ninstance? He persuaded _his_ Jinnee to return to the bottle by\npretending to doubt whether he had ever really been inside it.\n\nBut Fakrash, though simple enough in some respects, was not quite such a\nfool as that. Sometimes the Jinn could be mollified and induced to grant\na reprieve by being told stories, one inside the other, like a nest of\nOriental boxes. Unfortunately Fakrash did not seem in the humour for\nlistening to apologues, and, even if he were, Horace could not think of\nor improvise any just then. \"Besides,\" he thought, \"I can't sit up here\ntelling him anecdotes for ever. I'd almost sooner die!\" Still, he\nremembered that it was generally possible to draw an Arabian Efreet into\ndiscussion: they all loved argument, and had a rough conception of\njustice.\n\n\"I think, Mr. Fakrash,\" he said, \"that, in common fairness, I have a\nright to know what offence I have committed.\"\n\n\"To recite thy misdeeds,\" replied the Jinnee, \"would occupy much time.\"\n\n\"I don't mind that,\" said Horace, affably. \"I can give you as long as\nyou like. I'm in no sort of a hurry.\"\n\n\"With me it is otherwise,\" retorted Fakrash, making a stride towards\nhim. \"Therefore court not life, for thy death hath become unavoidable.'\n\n\"Before we part,\" said Horace, \"you won't refuse to answer one or two\nquestions?\"\n\n\"Didst thou not undertake never to ask any further favour of me?\nMoreover, it will avail thee nought. For I am positively determined to\nslay thee.\"\n\n\"I demand it,\" said Horace, \"in the most great name of the Lord Mayor\n(on whom be peace!)\"\n\nIt was a desperate shot--but it took effect. The Jinnee quailed visibly.\n\n\"Ask, then,\" he said; \"but briefly, for the time groweth short.\"\n\nHorace determined to make one last appeal to Fakrash's sense of\ngratitude, since it had always seemed the dominant trait in his\ncharacter.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"but for me, wouldn't you be still in that brass\nbottle?\"\n\n\"That,\" replied the Jinnee, \"is the very reason why I purpose to destroy\nthee!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" was all Horace could find to say at this most unlooked-for answer.\nHis sheet anchor, in which he had trusted implicitly, had suddenly\ndragged--and he was drifting fast to destruction.\n\n\"Are there any other questions which thou wouldst ask?\" inquired the\nJinnee, with grim indulgence; \"or wilt thou encounter thy doom without\nfurther procrastination?\"\n\nHorace was determined not to give in just yet; he had a very bad hand,\nbut he might as well play the game out and trust to luck to gain a stray\ntrick.\n\n\"I haven't nearly done yet,\" he said. \"And, remember, you've promised to\nanswer me--in the name of the Lord Mayor!\"\n\n\"I will answer one other question, and no more,\" said the Jinnee, in an\ninflexible tone; and Ventimore realised that his fate would depend upon\nwhat he said next.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. A GAME OF BLUFF\n\n\n\"Thy second question, O pertinacious one?\" said the Jinnee, impatiently.\nHe was standing with folded arms looking down on Horace, who was still\nseated on the narrow cornice, not daring to glance below again, lest he\nshould lose his head altogether.\n\n\"I'm coming to it,\" said Ventimore; \"I want to know why you should\npropose to dash me to pieces in this barbarous way as a return for\nletting you out of that bottle. Were you so comfortable in it as all\nthat?\"\n\n\"In the bottle I was at least suffered to rest, and none molested me.\nBut in releasing me thou didst perfidiously conceal from me that\nSuleyman was dead and gone, and that there reigneth one in his stead\nmightier a thousand-fold, who afflicteth our race with labours and\ntortures exceeding all the punishments of Suleyman.\"\n\n\"What on earth have you got into your head now? You can't mean the Lord\nMayor?\"\n\n\"Whom else?\" said the Jinnee, solemnly. \"And though, for this once, by a\ndevice I have evaded his vengeance, yet do I know full well that either\nby virtue of the magic jewel upon his breast, or through that malignant\nmonster with the myriad ears and eyes and tongues, which thou callest\n'The Press,' I shall inevitably fall into his power before long.\"\n\nFor the life of him, in spite of his desperate plight, Horace could not\nhelp laughing. \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Fakrash,\" he said, as soon as he\ncould speak, \"but--the Lord Mayor! It's really too absurd. Why, he\nwouldn't hurt a hair on a fly's head!\"\n\n\"Seek not to deceive me further!\" said Fakrash, furiously. \"Didst thou\nnot inform me with thy own mouth that the spirits of Earth, Air, Water,\nand Fire were subject to his will? Have I no eyes? Do I not behold from\nhere the labours of my captive brethren? What are those on yonder\nbridges but enslaved Jinn, shrieking and groaning in clanking fetters,\nand snorting forth steam, as they drag their wheeled burdens behind\nthem? Are there not others toiling, with panting efforts, through the\nsluggish waters; others again, imprisoned in lofty pillars, from which\nthe smoke of their breath ascendeth even unto Heaven? Doth not the air\nthrob and quiver with their restless struggles as they writhe below in\ndarkness and torment? And thou hast the shamelessness to pretend that\nthese things are done in the Lord Mayor's own realms without his\nknowledge! Verily thou must take me for a fool!\"\n\n\"After all,\" reflected Ventimore, \"if he chooses to consider that\nrailway engines and steamers, and machinery generally, are inhabited by\nso many Jinn 'doing time,' it's not to my interest to undeceive\nhim--indeed, it's quite the contrary!\"\n\n\"I wasn't aware the Lord Mayor had so much power as all that,\" he said;\n\"but very likely you're right. And if you're so anxious to keep in\nfavour with him, it would be a great mistake to kill me. That _would_\nannoy him.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said the Jinnee, \"for I should declare that thou hadst spoken\nslightingly of him in my hearing, and that I had slain thee on that\naccount.\"\n\n\"Your proper course,\" said Horace, \"would be to hand me over to him, and\nlet _him_ deal with the case. Much more regular.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" said Fakrash; \"but I have conceived so bitter a hatred to\nthee by reason of thy insolence and treachery, that I cannot forego the\ndelight of slaying thee with my own hand.\"\n\n\"Can't you really?\" said Horace, on the verge of despair. \"And _then_,\nwhat will you do?\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied the Jinnee, \"I shall flee away to Arabia, where I shall\nbe safe.\"\n\n\"Don't you be too sure of that!\" said Horace. \"You see all those wires\nstretched on poles down there? Those are the pathways of certain Jinn\nknown as electric currents, and the Lord Mayor could send a message\nalong them which would be at Baghdad before you had flown farther than\nFolkestone. And I may mention that Arabia is now more or less under\nBritish jurisdiction.\"\n\nHe was bluffing, of course, for he knew perfectly well that, even if any\nextradition treaty could be put in force, the arrest of a Jinnee would\nbe no easy matter.\n\n\"Thou art of opinion, then, that I should be no safer in mine own\ncountry?\" inquired Fakrash.\n\n\"I swear by the name of the Lord Mayor (to whom be all reverence!)\" said\nHorace, \"that there is no land you could fly to where you would be any\nsafer than you are here.\"\n\n\"If I were but sealed up in my bottle once more,\" said the Jinnee,\n\"would not even the Lord Mayor have respect unto the seal of Suleyman,\nand forbear to disturb me?\"\n\n\"Why, of course he would!\" cried Horace, hardly daring to believe his\nears. \"That's really a brilliant idea of yours, my dear Mr. Fakrash.\"\n\n\"And in the bottle I should not be compelled to work,\" continued the\nJinnee. \"For labour of all kinds hath ever been abhorrent unto me.\"\n\n\"I can quite understand that,\" said Horace, sympathetically. \"Just\nimagine your having to drag an excursion train to the seaside on a Bank\nHoliday, or being condemned to print off a cheap comic paper, or even\nthe _War Cry_, when you might be leading a snug and idle existence in\nyour bottle. If I were you, I should go and get inside it at once.\nSuppose we go back to Vincent Square and find it?\"\n\n\"I shall return to the bottle, since in that alone there is safety,\"\nsaid the Jinnee. \"But I shall return alone.\"\n\n\"Alone!\" cried Horace. \"You're not going to leave me stuck up here all\nby myself?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said the Jinnee. \"Have I not said that I am about to cast\nthee to perdition? Too long have I delayed in the accomplishment of this\nduty.\"\n\nOnce more Horace gave himself up for lost; which was doubly bitter, just\nwhen he had begun to consider that the danger was past. But even then,\nhe was determined to fight to the last.\n\n\"One moment,\" he said. \"Of course, if you've set your heart on pitching\nme over, you must. Only--I may be quite mistaken--but I don't quite see\nhow you are going to manage the rest of your programme without me,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"O deficient in intelligence!\" cried the Jinnee. \"What assistance canst\nthou render me?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Horace, \"of course, you can get into the bottle\nalone--that's simple enough. But the difficulty I see is this: Are you\nquite sure you can put the cap on yourself--from the _inside_, you\nknow?\" If he can, he thought, \"I'm done for!\"\n\n\"That,\" began the Jinnee, with his usual confidence \"will be the easiest\nof--nay,\" he corrected himself, \"there be things that not even the Jinn\nthemselves can accomplish, and one of them is to seal a vessel while\nremaining in it. I am indebted to thee for reminding me thereof.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Ventimore. \"I shall be delighted to come and seal you\nup comfortably myself.\"\n\n\"Again thou speakest folly,\" exclaimed the Jinnee. \"How canst thou seal\nme up after I have dashed thee into a thousand pieces?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Horace, with all the urbanity he could command, \"is\nprecisely the difficulty I was trying to convey.\"\n\n\"There will be no difficulty, for as soon as I am in the bottle I shall\nsummon certain inferior Efreets, and they will replace the seal.\"\n\n\"When you are once in the bottle,\" said Horace, at a venture, \"you\nprobably won't be in a position to summon anybody.\"\n\n\"_Before_ I get into the bottle, then!\" said the Jinnee, impatiently.\n\"Thou dost but juggle with words!\"\n\n\"But about those Efreets,\" persisted Horace. \"You know what Efreets\n_are_! How can you be sure that, when they've got you in the bottle,\nthey won't hand you over to the Lord Mayor? I shouldn't trust them\nmyself--but, of course, you know best!\"\n\n\"Whom shall I trust, then?\" said Fakrash, frowning.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know. It's rather a pity you're so determined to\ndestroy me, because, as it happens, I'm just the one person living who\ncould be depended on to seal you up and keep your secret. However,\nthat's your affair. After all, why should I care what becomes of you? I\nshan't be there!\"\n\n\"Even at this hour,\" said the Jinnee, undecidedly, \"I might find it in\nmy heart to spare thee, were I but sure that thou wouldst be faithful\nunto me!\"\n\n\"I should have thought I was more to be trusted than one of your beastly\nEfreets!\" said Horace, with well-assumed indifference. \"But never mind,\nI don't know that I care, after all. I've nothing particular to live for\nnow. You've ruined me pretty thoroughly, and you may as well finish your\nwork. I've a good mind to jump over, and save you the trouble. Perhaps,\nwhen you see me bouncing down that dome, you'll be sorry!\"\n\n\"Refrain from rashness!\" said the Jinnee, hastily, without suspecting\nthat Ventimore had no serious intention of carrying out his threat. \"If\nthou wilt do as thou art bidden, I will not only pardon thee, but grant\nthee all that thou desirest.\"\n\n\"Take me back to Vincent Square first,\" said Horace. \"This is not the\nplace to discuss business.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest rightly,\" replied the Jinnee; \"hold fast to my sleeve, and\nI will transport thee to thine abode.\"\n\n\"Not till you promise to play fair,\" said Horace, pausing on the brink\nof the ledge. \"Remember, if you let me go now you drop the only friend\nyou've got in the world!\"\n\n\"May I be thy ransom!\" replied Fakrash. \"There shall not be harmed a\nhair of thy head!\"\n\nEven then Horace had his misgivings; but as there was no other way of\ngetting off that cornice, he decided to take the risk. And, as it\nproved, he acted judiciously, for the Jinnee flew to Vincent Square with\nhonourable precision, and dropped him neatly into the armchair in which\nhe had little hoped ever to find himself again.\n\n\"I have brought thee hither,\" said Fakrash, \"and yet I am persuaded that\nthou art even now devising treachery against me, and wilt betray me if\nthou canst.\"\n\nHorace was about to assure him once more that no one could be more\nanxious than himself to see him safely back in his bottle, when he\nrecollected that it was impolitic to appear too eager.\n\n\"After the way you've behaved,\" he said, \"I'm not at all sure that I\nought to help you. Still, I said I would, on certain conditions, and\nI'll keep my word.\"\n\n\"Conditions!\" thundered the Jinnee. \"Wilt thou bargain with me yet\nfurther?\"\n\n\"My excellent friend,\" said Horace quietly, \"you know perfectly well\nthat you can't get yourself safely sealed up again in that bottle\nwithout my assistance. If you don't like my terms, and prefer to take\nyour chance of finding an Efreet who is willing to brave the Lord Mayor,\nwell, you've only to say so.\"\n\n\"I have loaded thee with all manner of riches and favours, and I will\nbestow no more upon thee,\" said the Jinnee, sullenly. \"Nay, in token of\nmy displeasure, I will deprive thee even of such gifts as thou hast\nretained.\" He pointed his grey forefinger at Ventimore, whose turban\nand jewelled robes instantly shrivelled into cobwebs and tinder, and\nfluttered to the carpet in filmy shreds, leaving him in nothing but his\nunderclothing.\n\n\"That only shows what a nasty temper you're in,\" said Horace, blandly,\n\"and doesn't annoy me in the least. If you'll excuse me, I'll go and put\non some things I can feel more at home in; and perhaps by the time I\nreturn you'll have cooled down.\"\n\nHe slipped on some clothes hurriedly and re-entered the sitting-room.\n\"Now, Mr. Fakrash,\" he said, \"we'll have this out. You talk of having\nloaded me with benefits. You seem to consider I ought to be grateful to\nyou. In Heaven's name, for what? I've been as forbearing as possible all\nthis time, because I gave you credit for meaning well. Now, I'll speak\nplainly. I told you from the first, and I tell you now, that I want no\nriches nor honours from you. The one real good turn you did me was\nbringing me that client, and you spoilt that because you would insist on\nbuilding the palace yourself, instead of leaving it to me! As for the\nrest--here am I, a ruined and discredited man, with a client who\nprobably supposes I'm in league with the Devil; with the girl I love,\nand might have married, believing that I have left her to marry a\nPrincess; and her father, unable ever to forgive me for having seen him\nas a one-eyed mule. In short, I'm in such a mess all round that I don't\ncare two straws whether I live or die!\"\n\n\"What is all this to me?\" said the Jinnee.\n\n\"Only this--that unless you can see your way to putting things straight\nfor me, I'm hanged if I take the trouble to seal you up in that bottle!\"\n\n\"How am _I_ to put things straight for thee?\" cried Fakrash, peevishly.\n\n\"If you could make all those people entirely forget that affair in the\nGuildhall, you can make my friends forget the brass bottle and\neverything connected with it, can't you?\"\n\n\"There would be no difficulty in that,\" Fakrash admitted.\n\n\"Well, do it--and I'll swear to seal you up in the bottle exactly as if\nyou had never been out of it, and pitch you into the deepest part of the\nThames, where no one will ever disturb you.\"\n\n\"First produce the bottle, then,\" said Fakrash, \"for I cannot believe\nbut that thou hast some lurking guile in thy heart.\"\n\n\"I'll ring for my landlady and have the bottle brought up,\" said Horace.\n\"Perhaps that will satisfy you? Stay, you'd better not let her see you.\"\n\n\"I will render myself invisible,\" said the Jinnee, suiting the action to\nhis words. \"But beware lest thou play me false,\" his voice continued,\n\"for I shall hear thee!\"\n\n\"So you've come in, Mr. Ventimore?\" said Mrs. Rapkin, as she entered.\n\"And without the furrin gentleman? I _was_ surprised, and so was Rapkin\nthe same, to see you ridin' off this morning in the gorgious chariot and\n'osses, and dressed up that lovely! 'Depend upon it,' I says to Rapkin,\nI says, 'depend upon it, Mr. Ventimore'll be sent for to Buckinham\nPallis, if it ain't Windsor Castle!'\"\n\n\"Never mind that now,\" said Horace, impatiently; \"I want that brass\nbottle I bought the other day. Bring it up at once, please.\"\n\n\"I thought you said the other day you never wanted to set eyes on it\nagain, and I was to do as I pleased with it, sir?\"\n\n\"Well, I've changed my mind, so let me have it, quick.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm very sorry, sir, but that you can't, because Rapkin, not\nwishful to have the place lumbered up with rubbish, disposed of it on'y\nlast night to a gentleman as keeps a rag and bone emporium off the\nBridge Road, and 'alf-a-crown was the most he'd give for it, sir.\"\n\n\"Give me his name,\" said Horace.\n\n\"Dilger, sir--Emanuel Dilger. When Rapkin comes in I'm sure he'd go\nround with pleasure, and see about it, if required.\"\n\n\"I'll go round myself,\" said Horace. \"It's all right, Mrs. Rapkin, quite\na natural mistake on your part, but--but I happen to want the bottle\nagain. You needn't stay.\"\n\n\"O thou smooth-faced and double-tongued one!\" said the Jinnee, after she\nhad gone, as he reappeared to view. \"Did I not foresee that thou wouldst\ndeal crookedly? Restore unto me my bottle!\"\n\n\"I'll go and get it at once,\" said Horace; \"I shan't be five minutes.\"\nAnd he prepared to go.\n\n\"Thou shalt not leave this house,\" cried Fakrash, \"for I perceive\nplainly that this is but a device of thine to escape and betray me to\nthe Press Devil!\"\n\n\"If you can't see,\" said Horace, angrily, \"that I'm quite as anxious to\nsee you safely back in that confounded bottle as ever you can be to get\nthere, you must be pretty dense! _Can't_ you understand? The bottle's\nsold, and I can't buy it back without going out. Don't be so infernally\nunreasonable!\"\n\n\"Go, then,\" said the Jinnee, \"and I will await thy return here. But know\nthis: that if thou delayest long or returnest without my bottle, I shall\nknow that thou art a traitor, and will visit thee and those who are dear\nto thee with the most unpleasant punishments!\"\n\n\"I'll be back in half an hour, at most,\" said Horace, feeling that this\nwould allow him ample margin, and thankful that it did not occur to\nFakrash to go in person.\n\nHe put on his hat, and hurried off in the gathering dusk. He had some\nlittle trouble in finding Mr. Dilger's establishment, which was a dirty,\ndusty little place in a back street, with a few deplorable old chairs,\nrickety washstands, and rusty fenders outside, and the interior almost\ncompletely blocked by piles of dingy mattresses, empty clock-cases,\ntarnished and cracked mirrors, broken lamps, damaged picture-frames, and\neverything else which one would imagine could have no possible value\nfor any human being. But in all this collection of worthless curios the\nbrass bottle was nowhere to be seen.\n\nVentimore went in and found a youth of about thirteen straining his eyes\nin the fading light over one of those halfpenny humorous journals which,\nthanks to an improved system of education, at least eighty per cent. of\nour juvenile population are now enabled to appreciate.\n\n\"I want to see Mr. Dilger,\" he began.\n\n\"You can't,\" said the youth. \"'Cause he ain't in. He's attending of an\nauction.\"\n\n\"When _will_ he be in, do you know?\"\n\n\"Might be back to his tea--but I wasn't to expect him not before\nsupper.\"\n\n\"You don't happen to have any old metal bottles--copper or--or brass\nwould do--for sale?\"\n\n\"You don't git at me like that! Bottles is made o' glorss.\"\n\n\"Well, a jar, then--a big brass pot--anything of that kind?\"\n\n\"Don't keep 'em,\" said the boy, and buried himself once more in his copy\nof \"Spicy Sniggers.\"\n\n\"I'll just look round,\" said Horace, and began to poke about with a\nsinking heart, and a horrid dread that he might have come to the wrong\nshop, for the big pot-bellied vessel certainly did not seem to be there.\nAt last, to his unspeakable joy, he discovered it under a piece of\ntattered drugget. \"Why, this is the sort of thing I meant,\" he said,\nfeeling in his pocket and discovering that he had exactly a sovereign.\n\"How much do you want for it?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" said the boy.\n\n\"I don't mind three shillings,\" said Horace, who did not wish to appear\ntoo keen at first.\n\n\"I'll tell the guv'nor when he comes in,\" was the reply, \"and you can\nlook in later.\"\n\n\"I want it at once,\" insisted Horace. \"Come, I'll give you three-and-six\nfor it.\"\n\n\"It's more than it's wurf,\" replied the candid youth.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Horace, \"but I'm rather pressed for time. If you'll\nchange this sovereign, I'll take the bottle away with me.\"\n\n\"You seem uncommon anxious to get 'old on it, mister!\" said the boy,\nwith sudden suspicion.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Horace. \"I live close by, and I thought I might as well\ntake it, that's all.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that's all, you can wait till the guv'nor's in.\"\n\n\"I--I mayn't be passing this way again for some time,\" said Horace.\n\n\"Bound to be, if you live close by,\" and the provoking youth returned to\nhis \"Sniggers.\"\n\n\"Do you call this attending to your master's business?\" said Horace.\n\"Listen to me, you young rascal. I'll give you five shillings for it.\nYou're not going to be fool enough to refuse an offer like that?\"\n\n\"I ain't goin' to be fool enough to refuse it--nor yet I ain't goin' to\nbe fool enough to take it, 'cause I'm only 'ere to see as nobody don't\ncome in and sneak fings. I ain't got no authority to sell anyfink, and I\ndon't know the proice o' nuffink, so there you _'ave_ it.\"\n\n\"Take the five shillings,\" said Horace, \"and if it's too little I'll\ncome round and settle with your master later.\"\n\n\"I thought you said you wasn't likely to be porsin' again? No, mister,\nyou don't kid me that way!\"\n\nHorace had a mad impulse to snatch up the precious bottle then and there\nand make off with it, and might have yielded to the temptation, with\ndisastrous consequences, had not an elderly man entered the shop at that\nmoment. He was bent, and wore rather more fluff and flue upon his person\nthan most well-dressed people would consider necessary, but he came in\nwith a certain air of authority, nevertheless.\n\n\"Mr. Dilger, sir,\" piped the youth, \"'ere's a gent took a fancy to this\n'ere brass pot o' yours. Says he _must_ 'ave it. Five shillings he'd got\nto, but I told him he'd 'ave to wait till you come in.\"\n\n\"Quite right, my lad!\" said Mr. Dilger, cocking a watery but sharp old\neye at Horace. \"Five shillings! Ah, sir, you can't know much about these\nhold brass antiquities to make an orfer like that.\"\n\n\"I know as much as most people,\" said Horace. \"But let us say six\nshillings.\"\n\n\"Couldn't be done, sir; couldn't indeed. Why, I give a pound for it\nmyself at Christie's, as sure as I'm standin' 'ere in the presence o' my\nMaker, and you a sinner!\" he declared impressively, if rather\nambiguously.\n\n\"Your memory is not quite accurate,\" said Horace. \"You bought it last\nnight from a man of the name of Rapkin, who lets lodgings in Vincent\nSquare, and you paid exactly half a crown for it.\"\n\n\"If you say so I dare say it's correct, sir,\" said Mr. Dilger, without\nexhibiting the least confusion. \"And if I did buy it off Mr. Rapkin,\nhe's a respectable party, and ain't likely to have come by it\ndishonest.\"\n\n\"I never said he did. What will you take for the thing?\"\n\n\"Well, just look at the work in it. They don't turn out the like o' that\nnowadays. Dutch, that is; what they used for to put their milk and\nsuch-like in.\"\n\n\"Damn it!\" said Horace, completely losing his temper. \"_I_ know what it\nwas used for. _Will_ you tell me what you want for it?\"\n\n\"I couldn't let a curiosity like that go a penny under thirty\nshillings,\" said Mr. Dilger, affectionately. \"It would be robbin'\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a sovereign for it--there,\" said Horace. \"You know best\nwhat profit that represents. That's my last word.\"\n\n\"_My_ last word to that, sir, is good hevenin',\" said the worthy man.\n\n\"Good evening, then,\" said Horace, and walked out of the shop; rather to\nbring Mr. Dilger to terms than because he really meant to abandon the\nbottle, for he dared not go back without it, and he had nothing about\nhim just then on which he could raise the extra ten shillings, supposing\nthe dealer refused to trust him for the balance--and the time was\ngrowing dangerously short.\n\nFortunately the well-worn ruse succeeded, for Mr. Dilger ran out after\nhim and laid an unwashed claw upon his coat-sleeve. \"Don't go, mister,\"\nhe said; \"I like to do business if I can; though, 'pon my word and\nhonour, a sovereign for a work o' art like that! Well, just for luck and\nbein' my birthday, we'll call it a deal.\"\n\nHorace handed over the coin, which left him with a few pence. \"There\nought to be a lid or stopper of some sort,\" he said suddenly. \"What have\nyou done with that?\"\n\n\"No, sir, there you're mistook, you are, indeed. I do assure you you\nnever see a pot of this partickler pattern with a lid to it. Never!\"\n\n\"Oh, don't you, though?\" said Horace. \"I know better. Never mind,\" he\nsaid, as he recollected that the seal was in Fakrash's possession. \"I'll\ntake it as it is. Don't trouble to wrap it up. I'm in rather a hurry.\"\n\nIt was almost dark when he got back to his rooms, where he found the\nJinnee shaking with mingled rage and apprehension.\n\n\"No welcome to thee!\" he cried. \"Dilatory dog that thou art! Hadst thou\ndelayed another minute, I would have called down some calamity upon\nthee.\"\n\n\"Well, you need not trouble yourself to do that now,\" returned\nVentimore. \"Here's your bottle, and you can creep into it as soon as you\nplease.\"\n\n\"But the seal!\" shrieked the Jinnee. \"What hast thou done with the seal\nwhich was upon the bottle?\"\n\n\"Why, you've got it yourself, of course,\" said Horace, \"in one of your\npockets.\"\n\n\"O thou of base antecedents!\" howled Fakrash, shaking out his flowing\ndraperies. \"How should _I_ have the seal? This is but a fresh device of\nthine to undo me!\"\n\n\"Don't talk rubbish!\" retorted Horace. \"You made the Professor give it\nup to you yesterday. You must have lost it somewhere or other. Never\nmind! I'll get a large cork or bung, which will do just as well. And\nI've lots of sealing-wax.\"\n\n\"I will have no seal but the seal of Suleyman!\" declared the Jinnee.\n\"For with no other will there be security. Verily I believe that that\naccursed sage, thy friend, hath contrived by some cunning to get the\nseal once more into his hands. I will go at once to his abode and compel\nhim to restore it.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't,\" said Horace, feeling extremely uneasy, for it was\nevidently a much simpler thing to let a Jinnee out of a bottle than to\nget him in again. \"He's quite incapable of taking it. And if you go out\nnow you'll only make a fuss and attract the attention of the Press,\nwhich I thought you rather wanted to avoid.\"\n\n\"I shall attire myself in the garments of a mortal--even those I assumed\non a former occasion,\" said Fakrash, and as he spoke his outer robes\nmodernised into a frock-coat. \"Thus shall I escape attention.\"\n\n\"Wait one moment,\" said Horace. \"What is that bulge in your\nbreast-pocket?\"\n\n\"Of a truth,\" said the Jinnee, looking relieved but not a little foolish\nas he extracted the object, \"it is indeed the seal.\"\n\n\"You're in such a hurry to think the worst of everybody, you see!\" said\nHorace. \"Now, _do_ try to carry away with you into your seclusion a\nbetter opinion of human nature.\"\n\n\"Perdition to all the people of this age!\" cried Fakrash, re-assuming\nhis green robe and turban, \"for I now put no faith in human beings and\nwould afflict them all, were not the Lord Mayor (on whom be peace!)\nmightier than I. Therefore, while it is yet time, take thou the stopper,\nand swear that, after I am in this bottle, thou wilt seal it as before\nand cast it into deep waters, where no eye will look upon it more!\"\n\n\"With all the pleasure in the world!\" said Horace; \"only you must keep\n_your_ part of the bargain first. You will kindly obliterate all\nrecollection of yourself and the brass bottle from the minds of every\nhuman being who has had anything to do with you or it.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" objected the Jinnee, \"for thus wouldst thou forget thy\ncompact.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, leave _me_ out, then,\" said Horace. \"Not that anything\ncould make me forget _you_!\"\n\nFakrash swept his right hand round in a half circle. \"It is\naccomplished,\" he said. \"All recollection of myself and yonder bottle is\nnow erased from the memories of every one but thyself.\"\n\n\"But how about my client?\" said Horace. \"I can't afford to lose _him_,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"He shall return unto thee,\" said the Jinnee, trembling with impatience.\n\"Now perform thy share.\"\n\nHorace had triumphed. It had been a long and desperate duel with this\nsingular being, who was at once so crafty and so childlike, so credulous\nand so suspicious, so benevolent and so malign. Again and again he had\ndespaired of victory, but he had won at last. In another minute or so\nthis formidable Jinnee would be safely bottled once more, and powerless\nto intermeddle and plague him for the future.\n\nAnd yet, in the very moment of triumph, quixotic as such scruples may\nseem to some, Ventimore's conscience smote him. He could not help a\ncertain pity for the old creature, who was shaking there convulsively\nprepared to re-enter his bottle-prison rather than incur a wholly\nimaginary doom. Fakrash had aged visibly within the last hour; now he\nlooked even older than his three thousand and odd years. True, he had\nled Horace a fearful life of late, but at first, at least, his\nintentions had been good. His gratitude, if mistaken in its form, was\nthe sign of a generous disposition. Not every Jinnee, surely, would\nhave endeavoured to press untold millions and honours and dignities of\nall kinds upon him, in return for a service which most mortals would\nhave considered amply repaid by a brace of birds and an invitation to an\nevening party.\n\nAnd how was Horace treating _him_? He was taking what, in his heart, he\nfelt to be a rather mean advantage of the Jinnee's ignorance of modern\nlife to cajole him into returning to his captivity. Why not suffer him\nto live out the brief remainder of his years (for he could hardly last\nmore than another century or two at most) in freedom? Fakrash had learnt\nhis lesson: he was not likely to interfere again in human affairs; he\nmight find his way back to the Palace of the Mountain of the Clouds and\nend his days there, in peaceful enjoyment of the society of such of the\nJinn as might still survive unbottled.\n\nSo, obeying--against his own interests--some kindlier impulse, Horace\nmade an effort to deter the Jinnee, who was already hovering in air\nabove the neck of the bottle in a swirl of revolving draperies, like\nsome blundering old bee vainly endeavouring to hit the opening into his\nhive.\n\n\"Mr. Fakrash,\" he cried, \"before you go any farther, listen to me.\nThere's no real necessity, after all, for you to go back to your bottle.\nIf you'll only wait a little----\"\n\nBut the Jinnee, who had now swelled to gigantic proportions, and whose\nform and features were only dimly recognisable through the wreaths of\nblack vapour in which he was involved, answered him from his pillar of\nsmoke in a terrible voice. \"Wouldst thou still persuade me to linger?\"\nhe cried. \"Hold thy peace and be ready to fulfil thine undertaking.\"\n\n\"But, look here,\" persisted Horace. \"I should feel such a brute if I\nsealed you up without telling you----\" The whirling and roaring column,\nin shape like an inverted cone, was being fast sucked down into the\nvessel, till only a semi-materialised but highly infuriated head was\nleft above the neck of the bottle.\n\n\"Must I tarry,\" it cried, \"till the Lord Mayor arrive with his Memlooks,\nand the hour of safety is expired? By my head, if thou delayest another\ninstant, I will put no more faith in thee! And I will come forth once\nmore, and afflict thee and thy friends--ay, and all the dwellers in this\naccursed city--with the most painful and unheard-of calamities.\"\n\nAnd, with these words, the head sank into the bottle with a loud clap\nresembling thunder.\n\nHorace hesitated no longer. The Jinnee himself had absolved him from all\nfurther scruples; to imperil Sylvia and her parents--not to mention all\nLondon--out of consideration for one obstinate and obnoxious old demon,\nwould clearly be carrying sentiment much too far.\n\nAccordingly, he made a rush for the jar and slipped the metal cover over\nthe mouth of the neck, which was so hot that it blistered his fingers,\nand, seizing the poker, he hammered down the secret catch until the lid\nfitted as closely as Suleyman himself could have required.\n\nThen he stuffed the bottle into a kit-bag, adding a few coals to give it\nextra weight, and toiled off with it to the nearest steamboat pier,\nwhere he spent his remaining pence in purchasing a ticket to the Temple.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext day the following paragraph appeared in one of the evening papers,\nwhich probably had more space than usual at its disposal:\n\n\n    \"SINGULAR OCCURRENCE ON A PENNY\n                STEAMER\n\n\"A gentleman on board one of the Thames steamboats (so we are informed\nby an eye-witness) met with a somewhat ludicrous mishap yesterday\nevening. It appears that he had with him a small portmanteau, or large\nhand-bag, which he was supporting on the rail of the stern bulwark. Just\nas the vessel was opposite the Savoy Hotel he incautiously raised his\nhand to the brim of his hat, thereby releasing hold of the bag, which\noverbalanced itself and fell into the deepest part of the river, where\nit instantly sank. The owner (whose carelessness occasioned considerable\namusement to passengers in his immediate vicinity) appeared no little\ndisconcerted by the oversight, and was not unnaturally reticent as to\nthe amount of his loss, though he was understood to state that the bag\ncontained nothing of any great value. However this may be, he has\nprobably learnt a lesson which will render him more careful in future.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE EPILOGUE\n\n\nOn a certain evening in May Horace Ventimore dined in a private room at\nthe Savoy, as one of the guests of Mr. Samuel Wackerbath. In fact, he\nmight almost be said to be the guest of the evening, as the dinner was\ngiven by way of celebrating the completion of the host's new country\nhouse at Lipsfield, of which Horace was the architect, and also to\ncongratulate him on his approaching marriage (which was fixed to take\nplace early in the following month) with Miss Sylvia Futvoye.\n\n\"Quite a small and friendly party!\" said Mr. Wackerbath, looking round\non his numerous sons and daughters, as he greeted Horace in the\nreception-room. \"Only ourselves, you see, Miss Futvoye, a young lady\nwith whom you are fairly well acquainted, and her people, and an old\nschoolfellow of mine and his wife, who are not yet arrived. He's a man\nof considerable eminence,\" he added, with a roll of reflected importance\nin his voice; \"quite worth your cultivating. Sir Lawrence Pountney, his\nname is. I don't know if you remember him, but he discharged the onerous\nduties of Lord Mayor of London the year before last, and acquitted\nhimself very creditably--in fact, he got a baronetcy for it.\"\n\nAs the year before last was the year in which Horace had paid his\ninvoluntary visit to the Guildhall, he was able to reply with truth that\nhe _did_ remember Sir Lawrence.\n\nHe was not altogether comfortable when the ex-Lord-Mayor was announced,\nfor it would have been more than awkward if Sir Lawrence had chanced to\nremember _him_. Fortunately, he gave no sign that he did so, though his\nmanner was graciousness itself. \"Delighted, my dear Mr. Ventimore,\" he\nsaid pressing Horace's hand almost as warmly as he had done that October\nday of the dais, \"most delighted to make your acquaintance! I am always\nglad to meet a rising young man, and I hear that the house you have\ndesigned for my old friend here is a perfect palace--a marvel, sir!\"\n\n\"I knew he was my man,\" declared Mr. Wackerbath, as Horace modestly\ndisclaimed Sir Lawrence's compliment. \"You remember, Pountney, my dear\nfellow, that day when we were crossing Westminster Bridge together, and\nI was telling you I thought of building? 'Go to one of the leading\nmen--an R.A. and all that sort of thing,' you said, 'then you'll be sure\nof getting your money's worth.' But I said, 'No, I like to choose for\nmyself; to--ah--exercise my own judgment in these matters. And there's a\nyoung fellow I have in my eye who'll beat 'em all, if he's given the\nchance. I'm off to see him now.' And off I went to Great Cloister Street\n(for he hadn't those palatial offices of his in Victoria Street at that\ntime) without losing another instant, and dropped in on him with my\nlittle commission. Didn't I, Ventimore?\"\n\n\"You did indeed,\" said Horace, wondering how far these reminiscences\nwould go.\n\n\"And,\" continued Mr. Wackerbath, patting Horace on the shoulder, \"from\nthat day to this I've never had a moment's reason to regret it. We've\nworked in perfect sympathy. His ideas coincided with mine. I think he\nfound that I met him, so to speak, on all fours.\"\n\nVentimore assented, though it struck him that a happier expression\nmight, and would, have been employed if his client had remembered one\nparticular interview in which he had not figured to advantage.\n\nThey went in to dinner, in a room sumptuously decorated with panels of\ngrey-green brocade and softly shaded lamps, and screens of gilded\nleather; through the centre of the table rose a tall palm, its boughs\nhung with small electric globes like magic fruits.\n\n\"This palm,\" said the Professor, who was in high good humour, \"really\ngives quite an Oriental look to the table. Personally, I think we might\nreproduce the Arabian style of decoration and arrangement generally in\nour homes with great advantage. I often wonder it never occurred to my\nfuture son-in-law there to turn his talents in that direction and design\nan Oriental interior for himself. Nothing more comfortable and\nluxurious--for a bachelor's purposes.\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" said his wife, \"Horace managed to make himself quite\ncomfortable enough as it was. He has the most delightful rooms in\nVincent Square.\" Ventimore heard her remark to Sir Lawrence: \"I shall\nnever forget the first time we dined there, just after my daughter and\nhe were engaged. I was quite astonished: everything was so\nperfect--quite simple, you know, but _so_ ingeniously arranged, and his\nlandlady such an excellent cook, too! Still, of course, in many ways, it\nwill be nicer for him to have a home of his own.\"\n\n\"With such a beautiful and charming companion to share it with,\" said\nSir Lawrence, in his most florid manner, \"the--ah--poorest home would\nprove a Paradise indeed! And I suppose now, my dear young lady,\" he\nadded, raising his voice to address Sylvia, \"you are busy making your\nfuture abode as exquisite as taste and research can render it,\nransacking all the furniture shops in London for treasures, and going\nabout to auctions--or do you--ah--delegate that department to Mr.\nVentimore?\"\n\n\"I do go about to old furniture shops, Sir Lawrence,\" she said, \"but not\nauctions. I'm afraid I should only get just the thing I didn't want if I\ntried to bid.... And,\" she added, in a lower voice, turning to Horace,\n\"I don't believe _you_ would be a bit more successful, Horace!\"\n\n\"What makes you say that, Sylvia?\" he asked, with a start.\n\n\"Why, do you mean to say you've forgotten how you went to that auction\nfor papa, and came away without having managed to get a single thing?\"\nshe said. \"What a short memory you must have!\"\n\nThere was only tender mockery in her eyes; absolutely no recollection of\nthe sinister purchase he had made at that sale, or how nearly it had\nseparated them for ever. So he hastened to admit that perhaps he had\n_not_ been particularly successful at the auction in question.\n\nSir Lawrence next addressed him across the table. \"I was just telling\nMrs. Futvoye,\" he said, \"how much I regretted that I had not the\nprivilege of your acquaintance during my year of office. A Lord Mayor,\nas you doubtless know, has exceptional facilities for exercising\nhospitality, and it would have afforded me real pleasure if your first\nvisit to the Guildhall could have been paid under my--hm--ha--auspices.\"\n\n\"You are very kind,\" said Horace, very much on his guard; \"I could not\nwish to pay it under better.\"\n\n\"I flatter myself,\" said the ex-Lord Mayor, \"that, while in office, I\ndid my humble best to maintain the traditions of the City, and I was\nfortunate enough to have the honour of receiving more than the average\nnumber of celebrities as guests. But I had one great disappointment, I\nmust tell you. It had always been a dream of mine that it might fall to\nmy lot to present some distinguished fellow-countryman with the freedom\nof the City. By some curious chance, when the opportunity seemed about\nto occur, the thing was put off and I missed it--missed it by the\nnearest hair-breadth!\"\n\n\"Ah, well, Sir Lawrence,\" said Ventimore, \"one can't have _everything_!\"\n\n\"For my part,\" put in Lady Pountney, who had only caught a word or two\nof her husband's remarks, \"what _I_ miss most is having the sentinels\npresent arms whenever I went out for a drive. They did it so nicely and\nrespectfully. I confess I enjoyed that. My husband never cared much for\nit. Indeed, he wouldn't even use the State coach unless he was\nabsolutely obliged. He was as obstinate as a mule about it!\"\n\n\"I see, Lady Pountney,\" the Professor put in, \"that you share the common\nprejudice against mules. It's quite a mistaken one. The mule has never\nbeen properly appreciated in this country. He is really the gentlest and\nmost docile of creatures!\"\n\n\"I can't say I like them myself,\" said Lady Pountney; \"such a mongrel\nsort of animal--neither one thing nor the other!\"\n\n\"And they're hideous too, Anthony,\" added his wife. \"And not at all\nclever!\"\n\n\"There you're mistaken, my dear,\" said the Professor; \"they are capable\nof almost human intelligence. I have had considerable personal\nexperience of what a mule can do,\" he informed Lady Pountney, who seemed\nstill incredulous. \"More than most people indeed, and I can assure you,\nmy dear Lady Pountney, that they readily adapt themselves to almost any\nenvironment, and will endure the greatest hardships without exhibiting\nany signs of distress. I see by your expression, Ventimore, that you\ndon't agree with me, eh?\"\n\nHorace had to set his teeth hard for a moment, lest he should disgrace\nhimself by a peal of untimely mirth--but by a strong effort of will he\nmanaged to command his muscles.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" he said, \"I've only chanced to come into close contact with\none mule in my life, and, frankly, I've no desire to repeat the\nexperience.\"\n\n\"You happened to come upon an unfavourable specimen, that's all,\" said\nthe Professor. \"There are exceptions to every rule.\"\n\n\"This animal,\" Horace said, \"was certainly exceptional enough in every\nway.\"\n\n\"Do tell us all about it,\" pleaded one of the Miss Wackerbaths, and all\nthe ladies joined in the entreaty until Horace found himself under the\nnecessity of improvising a story, which, it must be confessed, fell\nexceedingly flat.\n\nThis final ordeal past, he grew silent and thoughtful, as he sat there\nby Sylvia's side, looking out through the glazed gallery outside upon\nthe spring foliage along the Embankment, the opaline river, and the shot\ntowers and buildings on the opposite bank glowing warm brown against an\nevening sky of silvery blue.\n\nNot for the first time did it seem strange, incredible almost, to him\nthat all these people should be so utterly without any recollection of\nevents which surely might have been expected to leave some trace upon\nthe least retentive memory--and yet it only proved once more how\nthoroughly and honourably the old Jinnee, now slumbering placidly in his\nbottle deep down in unfathomable mud, opposite the very spot where they\nwere dining, had fulfilled his last undertaking.\n\nFakrash, the brass bottle, and all the fantastic and embarrassing\nperformances were indeed as totally forgotten as though they had never\nbeen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd it is but too probable that even this modest and veracious account\nof them will prove to have been included in the general act of\noblivion--though the author will trust as long as possible that\nFakrash-el-Aamash may have neglected to provide for this particular\ncase, and that the history of the Brass Bottle may thus be permitted to\nlinger awhile in the memories of some at least of its readers.\n",
