  "content": "Feats on the Fiord\nHarriet Martineau\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nMiss Martineau's Norwegian romance won its way long since into the\nhearts of children in this country.  The unhackneyed setting to the\nincidents of the tale distinguish it from thousands of more ordinary\nchildren's stories; nor is there any other tale so well-known having\nits scenes laid in the land of the fiords.  It is quite safe to add\nthat perhaps no other author has felt so strongly and communicated so\nconvincingly the mystic charm of these northern lagoons with their\nstill depths and reflections, their inaccessible walls of rock and\ntheir teeming wild-fowl life.\n\nThis mystic charm is deepened in the book by the thread of popular\nsuperstition which runs throughout the episodes and, in fact, gives\nrise to them.  Miss Martineau's _d√©nouements_ were calculated to\nshatter the follies of belief in Nipen and other supernatural agents;\nbut her own crusading traffic in them rather endears them to the\nimagination of the reader and certainly supplies a fascination which\nthe most sceptical of young readers would be sorry to miss.\n\nThe author also brings home to the youthful mind the wonder of the\nphysiographical peculiarities of northern latitudes.  The book opens\nwith the long nights and ends with the long days.  The midnight sun and\nthe northern lights play their parts, whilst the beautiful simplicity\nof farm-life in the Arctic circle is unfolded with authoritative\ninterest.\n\nAs for the hero, young Oddo, he is a prince among dauntless boys, yet\nhe never oversteps the bounds of true boyishness.  He would be a hero\nanywhere; but as a leading character in this romance, combined with all\nthe charm of natural effect in which he moves, he makes _Feats on the\nFiord_ a book to be classed among the few best of its kind.\n\nF. C. TILNEY.\n\n\nBOOK 1.\n\n\nEvery one who has looked at the map of Norway must have been struck\nwith the singular character of its coast.  On the map it looks so\njagged; a strange mixture of land and sea.  On the spot, however, this\ncoast is very sublime.  The long straggling promontories are\nmountainous, towering ridges of rock, springing up in precipices from\nthe water; while the bays between them, instead of being rounded with\nshelving sandy shores, on which the sea tumbles its waves, as in bays\nof our coast, are, in fact, long narrow valleys, filled with sea,\ninstead of being laid out in fields and meadows.  The high rocky banks\nshelter these deep bays (called fiords) from almost every wind; so that\ntheir waters are usually as still as those of a lake.  For days and\nweeks together, they reflect each separate tree-top of the pine-forests\nwhich clothe the mountain sides, the mirror being broken only by the\nleap of some sportive fish, or the oars of the boatman as he goes to\ninspect the sea-fowl from islet to islet of the fiord, or carries out\nhis nets or his rod to catch the sea-trout, or char, or cod, or\nherrings, which abound, in their seasons, on the coast of Norway.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether these fiords are the most beautiful in\nsummer or in winter.  In summer, they glitter with golden sunshine; and\npurple and green shadows from the mountain and forest lie on them; and\nthese may be more lovely than the faint light of the winter noons of\nthose latitudes, and the snowy pictures of frozen peaks which then show\nthemselves on the surface: but before the day is half over, out come\nthe stars--the glorious stars, which shine like nothing that we have\never seen.  There the planets cast a faint shadow, as the young moon\ndoes with us; and these planets and the constellations of the sky, as\nthey silently glide over from peak to peak of these rocky passes, are\nimaged on the waters so clearly that the fisherman, as he unmoors his\nboat for his evening task, feels as if he were about to shoot forth his\nvessel into another heaven, and to cleave his way among the stars.\n\nStill as everything is to the eye, sometimes for a hundred miles\ntogether along these deep sea-valleys, there is rarely silence.  The\near is kept awake by a thousand voices.  In the summer, there are\ncataracts leaping from ledge to ledge of the rocks; and there is the\nbleating of the kids that browse there, and the flap of the great\neagle's wings, as it dashes abroad from its eyrie, and the cries of\nwhole clouds of sea-birds which inhabit the islets; and all these\nsounds are mingled and multiplied by the strong echoes, till they\nbecome a din as loud as that of a city.  Even at night, when the flocks\nare in the fold, and the birds at roost, and the echoes themselves seem\nto be asleep, there is occasionally a sweet music heard, too soft for\neven the listening ear to catch by day.  There is the rumble of some\navalanche, as, after a drifting storm, a mass of snow too heavy to keep\nits place slides and tumbles from the mountain peak.  Wherever there is\na nook between the rocks on the shore, where a man may build a house,\nand clear a field or two;--wherever there is a platform beside the\ncataract where the sawyer may plant his mill, and make a path from it\nto join some great road, there is a human habitation, and the sounds\nthat belong to it.  Thence, in winter nights, come music and laughter,\nand the tread of dancers, and the hum of many voices.  The Norwegians\nare a social and hospitable people, and they hold their gay meetings in\ndefiance of their Arctic climate, through every season of the year.\n\nOn a January night, a hundred years ago, there was great merriment in\nthe house of a farmer who had fixed his abode within the Arctic circle,\nin Nordland, not far from the foot of Sulitelma, the highest mountain\nin Norway.  This dwelling, with its few fields about it, was in a\nrecess between the rocks, on the shore of the fiord, about five miles\nfrom Saltdalen, and two miles from the junction of the Salten's Elv\n(river) with the fiord.  The occasion, on the particular January day\nmentioned above, was the betrothment of one of the house-maidens to a\nyoung farm servant of the establishment.  It was merely an engagement\nto be married; but this engagement is a much more formal and public\naffair in Norway (and indeed wherever the people belong to the Lutheran\nchurch) than with us.  According to the rites of the Lutheran church,\nthere are two ceremonies--one when a couple become engaged, and another\nwhen they are married.\n\nAs Madame Erlingsen had two daughters growing up, and they were no less\nactive than the girls of a Norwegian household usually are, she had\noccasion for only two maidens to assist in the business of the dwelling\nand the dairy.\n\nOf these two, the younger, Erica, was the maiden betrothed to-day.  No\none perhaps rejoiced so much at the event as her mistress, both for\nErica's sake, and on account of her own two young daughters.  Erica was\nnot the best companion for them; and the servants of a Norwegian farmer\nare necessarily the companions of the daughters of the house.  There\nwas nothing wrong in Erica's conduct or temper towards the family.  But\nshe had sustained a shock which hurt her spirits, and increased a\nweakness which she owed to her mother.  Her mother, a widow, had\nbrought up her child in all the superstitions of the country, some of\nwhich remain in full strength even to this day, and were then very\npowerful; and the poor woman's death at last confirmed the lessons of\nher life.  She had stayed too long, one autumn day, at the Erlingsen's\nand, being benighted on her return, and suddenly seized and bewildered\nby the cold, had wandered from the road, and was found frozen to death\nin a recess of the forest which it was surprising that she should have\nreached.  Erica never believed that she did reach this spot of her own\naccord.  Having had some fears before of the Wood-Demon having been\noffended by one of the family, Erica regarded this accident as a token\nof his vengeance.  She said this when she first heard of her mother's\ndeath; and no reasonings from the zealous pastor of the district, no\nsoothing from her mistress, could shake her persuasion.  She listened\nwith submission, wiping away her quiet tears as they discoursed; but no\none could ever get her to say that she doubted whether there was a\nWood-Demon, or that she was not afraid of what he would do if offended.\n\nErlingsen and his wife always treated her superstition as a weakness;\nand when she was not present, they ridiculed it.  Yet they saw that it\nhad its effect on their daughters.  Erica most strictly obeyed their\nwish that she should not talk about the spirits of the region with Orga\nand Frolich; but the girls found plenty of people to tell them what\nthey could not learn from Erica.  Besides what everybody knows who\nlives in the rural districts of Norway--about Nipen, the spirit that is\nalways so busy after everybody's affairs--about the Water-Sprite, an\nacquaintance of every one who lives beside a river or lake--and about\nthe Mountain-Demon, familiar to all who lived so near Sulitelma;\nbesides these common spirits, the girls used to hear of a multitude of\nothers from old Peder, the blind houseman, and from all the\nfarm-people, down to Oddo, the herd-boy.  Their parents hoped that this\ntaste of theirs might die away if once Erica, with her sad, serious\nface and subdued voice, were removed to a house of her own, where they\nwould see her supported by her husband's unfearing mind, and occupied\nwith domestic business more entirely than in her mistress's house.  So\nMadame Erlingsen was well pleased that Erica was betrothed.\n\nFor this marrying, however, the young people must wait.  There was no\nhouse, or houseman's place, vacant for them at present.  The old\nhouseman Peder, who had served Erlingsen's father and Erlingsen himself\nfor fifty-eight years, could now no longer do the weekly work on the\nfarm which was his rent for his house, field, and cow.  He was blind\nand old.  His aged wife Ulla could not leave the house; and it was the\nmost she could do to keep the dwelling in order, with occasional help\nfrom one and another.  Houseman who make this sort of contract with\nfarmers in Norway are never turned out.  They have their dwelling and\nfield for their own life and that of their wives.  What they do, when\ndisabled, is to take in a deserving young man to do their work for the\nfarmer, on the understanding that he succeeds to the houseman's place\non the death of the old people.  Peder and Ulla had made this agreement\nwith Erica's lover, Rolf; and it was understood that his marriage with\nErica should take place whenever the old people should die.\n\nIt was impossible for Erica herself to fear that Nipen was offended, at\nthe outset of this festival day.  If he had chosen to send a wind, the\nguests could not have come; for no human frame can endure travelling in\na wind in Nordland on a January day.  Happily, the air was so calm that\na flake of snow, or a lock of eider-down, would have fallen straight to\nthe ground.  At two o'clock, when the short daylight was gone, the\nstars were shining so brightly, that the company who came by the fiord\nwould be sure to have an easy voyage.  Erlingsen and some of his\nservants went out to the porch, on hearing music from the water, and\nstood with lighted pine-torches to receive their guests when,\napproaching from behind, they heard the sound of the sleigh-bells, and\nfound that company was arriving both by sea and land.\n\nGlad had the visitors been, whether they came by land or water, to\narrive in sight of the lighted dwelling, whose windows looked like rows\nof yellow stars, contrasting with the blue ones overhead; and more glad\nstill were they to be ushered into the great room, where all was so\nlight, so warm, so cheerful.  Warm it was to the farthest corner; and\ntoo warm near the roaring and crackling fires, for the fires were of\npine wood.  Rows upon rows of candles were fastened against the walls\nabove the heads of the company: the floor was strewn with juniper\ntwigs, and the spinning-wheels, the carding-boards, every token of\nhousehold labour was removed except a loom, which remained in one\ncorner.  In another corner was a welcome sight, a platform of rough\nboards two feet from the floor, and on it two stools.  This was a token\nthat there was to be dancing; and indeed, Oddo, the herd-boy, old\nPeder's grandson, was seen to have his clarionet in his belt, as he ran\nin and out on the arrival of fresh parties.\n\n[In the porch she found Oddo.]\n\nThe whole company walked about the large room, sipping their strong\ncoffee, and helping one another to the good things on the trays which\nwere carried round.  When these trays disappeared, Oddo was seen to\nreach the platform with a hop, skip, and jump, followed by a\ndull-looking young man with a violin.  The oldest men lighted their\npipes, and sat down to talk, two or three together.  Others withdrew to\na smaller room, where card-tables were sets out, while the younger men\nselected their partners.  The dance was led by the blushing Erica,\nwhose master was her partner.  It had never occurred to her that she\nwas not to take her usual place; and she was greatly embarrassed, not\nthe less so that she knew that her mistress was immediately behind,\nwith Rolf for her partner.  All the women in Norway dance well, being\npractised in it from their infancy.  Every woman present danced well;\nbut none better than Erica.\n\n\"Very well! very pretty! very good!\" observed the pastor, M. Kollsen,\nas he sat, with his pipe in his mouth, looking on.  \"There are many\nyouths in Tronyem that would be glad of so pretty a partner as M.\nErlingsen has, if she would not look so frightened.\"\n\n\"Did you say she looks frightened, sir?\" asked Peder.\n\n\"Yes.  When does she not?  Some ghost from the grave has scared her, I\nsuppose.  It is her great fault that she has so little faith.  I never\nmet with such a case; I hardly know how to conduct it.  I must begin\nwith the people about her--abolish their superstitions--and then there\nmay be a chance for her.\"\n\n\"Pray, sir, who plays the violin at this moment?\" said Peder.\n\n\"A fellow who looks as if he did not like this business.  He is\nfrowning with his red brows, as if he would frown out the lights.\"\n\n\"His red brows!  Oh, then it is Hund.  I was thinking it would be hard\nupon him, poor fellow, if he had to play to-night.  Yet not so hard as\nif he had to dance.  It is weary work dancing with the heels when the\nheart is too heavy to move.  You may have heard, sir, for every one\nknows it, that Hund wanted to have young Rolf's place; and, some say,\nErica herself.  Is she dancing, sir, if I may ask?\"\n\n\"Yes, with Rolf.  What sort of a man is Rolf--with regard to these\nsuperstitions, I mean?  Is he as foolish as Erica--always frightened\nabout something?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.  It is to be wished that Rolf was not so light as he is,\nso inconsiderate about these matters.  Rolf has his troubles and his\nfaults, but they are not of that kind.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said M. Kollsen with a voice of authority.  \"I rejoice to\nhear that he is superior to the popular delusions.  As to his troubles\nand his faults, they may be left for me to discover, all in good time.\"\n\n\"With all my heart, sir.  They are nobody's business but his own; and,\nmay be, Erica's.\"\n\n\"How goes it, Rolf?\" said his master, who, having done his duty in the\ndancing-room, was now making his way to the card-tables, in another\napartment, to see how his guests there were entertained.  Thinking that\nRolf looked very absent as he stood, in the pause of the dance, in\nsilence by Erica's side, Erlingsen clapped him on the shoulder and\nsaid, \"How goes it?  Make your friends merry.\"\n\nRolf bowed and smiled, and his master passed on.\n\n\"How goes it?\" repeated Rolf to Erica, as he looked earnestly into her\nface.  \"Is all going on well, Erica?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  I suppose so.  Why not?\" she replied.  \"If you see\nanything wrong--anything omitted, be sure and tell me.  Madame\nErlingsen would be very sorry.  Is there anything forgotten, Rolf?\"\n\n\"I think you have forgotten what to-day is, that is all.  Nobody that\nlooked at you, love, would fancy it to be your own day.  You look\nanything but merry.  O Erica!  I wish you would trust me.  I could take\ncare of you, and make you quite happy, if you would only believe it.\nNothing in the universe shall touch you to your hurt, while----\"\n\n\"Oh, hush! hush!\" said Erica, turning pale and red at the presumption\nof this speech.  \"See, they are waiting for us.  One more round before\nsupper.\"\n\nAnd in the whirl of the waltz she tried to forget the last words Rolf\nhad spoken; but they rang in her ears; and before her eyes were images\nof Nipen overhearing this defiance--and the Water-Sprite planning\nvengeance in its palace under the ice--and the Mountain-Demon laughing\nin scorn, till the echoes shouted again--and the Wood-Demon waiting\nonly for summer to see how he could beguile the rash lover.\n\nLong was the supper, and hearty was the mirth round the table.  People\nin Norway have universally a hearty appetite--such an appetite as we\nEnglish have no idea of.\n\nAt last appeared the final dish of the long feast, the sweet cake, with\nwhich dinner and supper in Norway usually conclude.\n\nIt is the custom in the country regions of Norway to give the spirit\nNipen a share at festival times.  His Christmas cake is richer than\nthat prepared for the guests, and before the feast is finished it is\nlaid in some place out of doors, where, as might be expected, it is\nnever to be found in the morning.  Everybody knew, therefore, why Rolf\nrose from his seat, though some were too far off to hear him say that\nhe would carry out the treat for old Nipen.\n\n\"Now, pray do not speak so; do not call him those names,\" said Erica\nanxiously.  \"It is quite as easy to speak so as not to offend him.\nPray, Rolf, to please me, do speak respectfully.  And promise me to\nplay no tricks, but just set the things down, and come straight in, and\ndo not look behind you.  Promise me, Rolf.\"\n\nRolf did promise, but he was stopped by two voices calling upon him.\nOddo, the herd-boy, came running to claim the office of carrying out\nNipen's cake.  Erica eagerly put an ale-can into his hand, and the cake\nunder his arm; and Oddo was going out, when his blind grandfather,\nhearing that he was to be the messenger, observed that he should be\nbetter pleased if it were somebody else; for Oddo, though a good boy,\nwas inquisitive, and apt to get into mischief by looking too closely\ninto everything, having never a thought of fear.  Everybody knew this\nto be true; though Oddo himself declared that he was as frightened as\nanybody sometimes.  Moreover, he asked what there was to pry into, on\nthe present occasion, in the middle of the night; and appealed to the\ncompany whether Nipen was not best pleased to be served by the youngest\nof a party.  This was allowed; and he was permitted to go, when Peder's\nconsent was obtained.\n\nThe place where Nipen liked to find his offerings was at the end of the\nbarn, below the gallery which ran round the outside of the building.\nThere, in the summer, lay a plot of green grass; and, in the winter, a\nsheet of pure frozen snow.  Thither Oddo shuffled on, over the slippery\nsurface of the yard.  He looked more like a prowling cub then a boy,\nwrapped as he was in his wolf-skin coat, and his fox-skin cap doubled\ndown over his ears.\n\nThe cake steamed up in the frosty air under his nose, so warm and spicy\nand rich, that Oddo began to wonder what so very superior a cake could\nbe like.  He had never tasted any cake so rich as this; nor had any one\nin the house tasted such, for Nipen would be offended if his cake was\nnot richer than anybody's else.  He broke a piece off and ate it, and\nthen wondered whether Nipen would mind his cake being just a little\nsmaller than usual.  After a few steps more the wonder was how far\nNipen's charity would go for the cake was now a great deal smaller; and\nOddo next wondered whether anybody could stop eating such a cake when\nit was once tasted.  He was surprised to see when he came out into the\nstarlight, at the end of the barn, how small a piece was left.  He\nstood listening whether Nipen was coming in a gust of wind; and when he\nheard no breeze stirring, he looked about for a cloud where Nipen might\nbe.  There was no cloud, as far as he could see.  The moon had set; but\nthe stars were so bright as to throw a faint shadow from Oddo's form\nupon the snow.  There was no sign of any spirit being angry at present;\nbut Oddo thought Nipen would certainly be angry at finding so very\nsmall a piece of cake.  It might be better to let the ale stand by\nitself, and Nipen would perhaps suppose that Madame Erlingsen's stock\nof groceries had fallen short, at least that it was in some way\ninconvenient to make the cake on the present occasion.  So putting down\nhis can upon the snow, and holding the last fragment of the cake\nbetween his teeth, he seized a birch pole which hung down from the\ngallery, and by its help climbed one of the posts and got over the\nrails into the gallery, whence he could watch what would happen.  To\nremain on the very spot where Nipen was expected was a little more than\nhe was equal to; but he thought he could stand in the gallery, in the\nshadow of the broad eaves of the barn, and wait for a little while.  He\nwas so very curious to see Nipen, and to learn how it liked its ale!\n\nThere he stood in the shadow, growing more and more impatient as the\nminutes passed on, and he was aware that he was wanted in the house.\nOnce or twice he walked slowly away, looking behind him, and then\nturned again, unwilling to miss this opportunity of seeing Nipen.  Then\nhe called the spirit--actually begged it to appear.  His first call was\nalmost a whisper; but he called louder and louder till he was suddenly\nstopped by hearing an answer.\n\nThe call he heard was soft and sweet.  There was nothing terrible in\nthe sound itself; yet Oddo grasped the rail of the gallery with all his\nstrength as he heard it.  The strangest thing was, it was not a single\ncry: others followed it, all soft and sweet; but Oddo thought that\nNipen must have many companions, and he had not prepared himself to see\nmore spirits than one.  As usual, however, his curiosity grew more\nintense from the little he had heard, and he presently called again.\nAgain he was answered by four or five voices in succession.\n\n\"Was ever anybody so stupid!\" cried the boy, now stamping with\nvexation.  \"It is the echo, after all.  As if there was not always an\necho here opposite the rock.  It is not Nipen at all.  I will just wait\nanother minute, however.\"\n\nHe leaned in silence on his folded arms, and had not so waited for many\nseconds before he saw something moving on the snow at a little\ndistance.  It came nearer and nearer, and at last quite up to the can\nof ale.\n\n\"I am glad I stayed,\" thought Oddo.  \"Now I can say I have seen Nipen.\nIt is much less terrible then I expected.  Grandfather told me that it\nsometimes came like an enormous elephant or hippopotamus, and never\nsmaller than a large bear.  But this is no bigger then--let me see--I\nthink it is most like a fox.  I should like to make it speak to me.\nThey would think so much of me at home if I had talked with Nipen.\"\n\nSo he began gently--\"Is that Nipen?\"\n\nThe thing moved its bushy tail, but did not answer.\n\n\"There is no cake for you to-night, Nipen.  I hope the ale will do.  Is\nthe ale good, Nipen?\"\n\nOff went the dark creature without a word, as quick as it could go.\n\n\"It is offended?\" thought Oddo; \"or is it really what it looks like, a\nfox?  If it does not come back, I will go down presently and see\nwhether it is only a fox.\"\n\nHe presently let himself down to the ground by the way he had come up,\nand eagerly laid hold of the ale can.  It would not stir.  It was as\nfast on the ground as if it was enchanted, which Oddo did not doubt was\nthe case; and he started back with more fear than he had yet had.  The\ncold he felt on this exposed spot soon reminded him, however, that the\ncan was probably frozen to the snow, which it might well be, after\nbeing brought warm from the fireside.  It was so.  The vessel had sunk\nan inch into the snow, and was there fixed by the frost.\n\nNone of the ale seemed to have been drunk; and so cold was Oddo by this\ntime, that he longed for a sup of it.  He took first a sup and then a\ndraught; and then he remembered that the rest would be entirely spoiled\nby the frost if it stood another hour.  This would be a pity, he\nthought; so he finished it, saying to himself that he did not believe\nNipen would come that night.\n\nAt that very moment he heard a cry so dreadful that it shot, like\nsudden pain, through every nerve of his body.  It was not a shout of\nanger: it was something between a shriek and a wail--like what he\nfancied would be the cry of a person in the act of being murdered.\nThat Nipen was here now, he could not doubt; and, at length, Oddo fled.\nHe fled the faster, at first, for hearing the rustle of wings; but the\ncuriosity of the boy even now got the better of his terror, and he\nlooked up at the barn where the wings were rustling.  There he saw in\nthe starlight the glitter of two enormous round eyes, shining down upon\nhim from the ridge of the roof.  But it struck him at once that he had\nseen those eyes before.  He checked his speed, stopped, went back a\nlittle, sprang up once more into the gallery, hissed, waved his cap,\nand clapped his hands, till the echoes were all awake again; and, as he\nhad hoped, the great white owl spread its wings, sprang off from the\nridge, and sailed away over the fiord.\n\nOddo tossed up his cap, cold as the night was, so delighted was he to\nhave scared away the bird which had, for a moment, scared him.  He\nhushed his mirth, however, when he perceived that lights were wandering\nin the yard, and that there were voices approaching.  He saw that the\nhousehold were alarmed about him, and were coming forth to search for\nhim.  Curious to see what they would do, Oddo crouched down in the\ndarkest corner of the gallery to watch and listen.\n\nFirst came Rolf and his master, carrying torches, with which they\nlighted up the whole expanse of snow as they came.  They looked round\nthem without any fear, and Oddo heard Rolf say--\n\n\"If it were not for that cry, sir, I should think nothing of it.  But\nmy fear is that some beast has got him.\"\n\n\"Search first the place where the cake and ale ought to be,\" said\nErlingsen.  \"Till I see blood, I shall hope the best.\"\n\n\"You will not see that,\" said Hund, who followed; his gloomy\ncountenance, now distorted by fear, looking ghastly in the yellow light\nof the torch he carried.  \"You will see no blood.  Nipen does not draw\nblood.\"\n\n\"Never tell me that any one that was not wounded and torn could send\nout such a cry as that,\" said Rolf.  \"Some wild brute seized him, no\ndoubt, at the very moment that Erica and I were standing at the door\nlistening.\"\n\nOddo repented of his prank when he saw, in the flickering light behind\nthe crowd of guests, who seemed to hang together like a bunch of\ngrapes, the figures of his grandfather and Erica.  The old man had come\nout in the cold for his sake; and Erica, who looked as white as the\nsnow, had no doubt come forth because the old man wanted a guide.  Oddo\nnow wished himself out of the scrape.  Sorry as he was, he could not\nhelp being amused, and keeping himself hidden a little longer, when he\nsaw Rolf discover the round hole in the snow where the can had sunk,\nand heard the different opinions of the company as to what this\nportended.  Most were convinced that his curiosity had been his\ndestruction, as they had always prophesied.  What could be clearer, by\nthis hole, than that the ale had stood there, and been carried off with\nthe cake; and Oddo with it, because he chose to stay and witness what\nis forbidden to mortals?\n\n\"I wonder where he is now,\" said a shivering youth, the gayest dancer\nof the evening.\n\n\"Oh, there is no doubt about that; any one can tell you that,\" replied\nthe elderly and experienced M. Holberg.  \"He is chained upon a wind,\npoor fellow, like all Nipen's victims.  He will have to be shut up in a\ncave all the hot summer through, when it is pleasantest to be abroad;\nand when the frost and snow come again, he will be driven out, with a\nlash of Nipen's whip, and he must go flying wherever the wind flies,\nwithout resting, or stopping to warm himself at any fire in the\ncountry.\"\n\nOddo had thus far kept his laughter to himself; but now he could\ncontain himself no longer.  He laughed aloud--and then louder and\nlouder as he heard the echoes all laughing with him.  The faces below,\ntoo, were so very ridiculous--some of the people staring up in the air;\nand others at the rock where the echo came from; some having their\nmouths wide open, others their eyes starting, and all looking unlike\nthemselves in the torchlight.  His mirth was stopped by his master.\n\n\"Come down, sir,\" cried Erlingsen, looking up at the gallery.  \"Come\ndown this moment.  We shall make you remember this night, as well\nperhaps as Nipen could do.  Come down, and bring my can, and the ale\nand the cake.  The more pranks you play the more you will repent it.\"\n\nMost of the company thought Erlingsen very bold to talk in this way;\nbut he was presently justified by Oddo's appearance on the balustrade.\nHis master seized him as he touched the ground, while the others stood\naloof.\n\n\"Where is my ale can?\" said Erlingsen.\n\n\"Here, sir;\" and Oddo held it up dangling by the handle.\n\n\"And the cake--I bade you bring it down with you.\"\n\n\"So I did, sir.\"\n\nAnd to his master's look of inquiry, the boy answered by pointing down\nhis throat with one finger, and laying the other hand upon his stomach.\n\"It is all here, sir.\"\n\n\"And the ale in the same place?\"\n\nOddo bowed, and Erlingsen turned away without speaking.  He could not\nhave spoken without laughing.\n\n\"Bring this gentleman home,\" said Erlingsen presently to Rolf; \"and do\nnot let him out of your hands.  Let no one ask him any questions till\nhe is in the house.\"  Rolf grasped the boy's arm, and Erlingsen went\nforward to relieve Peder, though it was not very clear to him at the\nmoment whether such a grandchild was better safe or missing.  The old\nman made no such question, but hastened back with many expressions of\nthanksgiving.\n\nAs the search-party crowded in among the women, and pushed all before\nthem into the large warm room, M. Kollsen was seen standing on the\nstair-head, wrapped in the bear-skin coverlid.\n\n\"Is the boy there?\" he inquired.\n\nOddo showed himself.\n\n\"How much have you seen of Nipen, hey?\"\n\n\"Nobody ever had a better sight of it, sir.  It was as plain as I see\nyou now, and no farther off.\"\n\n\"Nonsense--it is a lie,\" said M. Kollsen.  \"Do not believe a word he\nsays,\" advised the pastor.\n\nOddo bowed, and proceeded to the great room, where he took up his\nclarionet, as if it was a matter of course that the dancing was to\nbegin again immediately.  He blew upon his fingers, however, observing\nthat they were too stiff with cold to do their duty well.  And when he\nturned towards the fire, every one made way for him, in a very\ndifferent manner from what they would have dreamed of three hours\nbefore.  Oddo had his curiosity gratified as to how they would regard\none who was believed to have seen something supernatural.\n\nWhen seriously questioned, Oddo had no wish to say anything but the\ntruth; and he admitted the whole--that he had eaten the entire cake,\ndrunk all the ale, seen a fox and an owl, and heard the echoes, in\nanswer to himself.  As he finished his story, Hund, who was perhaps the\nmost eager listener of all, leaped thrice upon the floor, snapping his\nfingers, as if in a passion of delight.  He met Erlingsen's eye, full\nof severity, and was quiet; but his countenance still glowed with\nexultation.\n\nThe rest of the company were greatly shocked at these daring insults to\nNipen: and none more so than Peder.  The old man's features worked with\nemotion, as he said in a low voice that he should be very thankful if\nall the mischief that might follow upon this adventure might be borne\nby the kin of him who had provoked it.  If it should fall upon those\nwho were innocent, never surely had boy been so miserable as his poor\nlad would then be.  Oddo's eyes filled with tears as he heard this; and\nhe looked up at his master and mistress, as if to ask whether they had\nno word of comfort to say.\n\n\"Neighbour,\" said Madame Erlingsen to Peder, \"is there any one here who\ndoes not believe that God is over all, and that He protects the\ninnocent?\"\n\n\"Is there any one who does not feel,\" added Erlingsen, \"that the\ninnocent should be gay, safe as they are in the goodwill of God and\nman?  Come, neighbours--to your dancing again!  You have lost too much\ntime already.  Now, Oddo, play your best--and you, Hund.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Oddo, \"that, if any mischief is to come, it will fall\nupon me.  We'll see how I shall bear it.\"\n\n\nWhen M. Kollsen appeared the next morning, the household had so much of\nits usual air that no stranger would have imagined how it had been\noccupied the day before.  The large room was fresh strewn with\nevergreen sprigs; the breakfast-table stood at one end, where each took\nbreakfast, standing, immediately on coming downstairs.  At the bottom\nof the room was a busy group.  Peder was twisting strips of leather,\nthin and narrow, into whips.  Rolf and Hund were silently intent upon a\nsort of work which the Norwegian peasant delights in--carving wood.\nThey spoke only to answer Peder's questions about the progress of the\nwork.  Peder loved to hear about their carving, and to feel it; for he\nhad been remarkable for his skill in the art, as long as his sight\nlasted.\n\nThe whole party rose when M. Kollsen entered the room.  He talked\npolitics a little with his host, by the fireside; in the midst of which\nconversation Erlingsen managed to intimate that nothing would be heard\nof Nipen to-day, if the subject was let alone by themselves: a hint\nwhich the clergyman was willing to take, as he supposed it meant in\ndeference to his views.\n\nErica heard M. Kollsen inquiring of Peder about his old wife, so she\nstarted up from her work, and said she must run and prepare Ulla for\nthe pastor's visit.  Poor Ulla would think herself forgotten this\nmorning, it was growing so late, and nobody had been over to see her.\n\nUlla, however, was far from having any such thoughts.  There sat the\nold woman, propped up in bed, knitting as fast as fingers could move,\nand singing, with her soul in her song, though her voice was weak and\nunsteady.\n\n\"I thought you would come,\" said Ulla.  \"I knew you would come, and\ntake my blessing on your betrothment.  I must not say that I hope to\nsee you crowned; for we all know--and nobody so well as I--that it is I\nthat stand between you and your crown.  I often think of it, my\ndear----\"\n\n\"Then I wish you would not, Ulla--you know that.\"\n\n\"I do know it, my dear; and I would not be for hastening God's\nappointments.  Let all be in His own time.\"\n\n\"There was news this morning,\" said Erica, \"of a lodgment of logs at\nthe top of the foss;[1] and they were all going, except Peder, to slide\nthem down the gully to the fiord.  The gully is frozen so slippery,\nthat the work will not take long.  They will make a raft of the logs in\nthe fiord; and either Rolf or Hund will carry them out to the islands\nwhen the tide ebbs.\"\n\n\n\n[1] Waterfall.  Pine-trunks felled in the forest are drawn over the\nfrozen snow to the banks of a river, or to the top of a waterfall,\nwhence they may be either slid down over the ice, or left to be carried\ndown by the floods, at the melting of the snows in the spring.\n\n\n\n\"Will it be Rolf, do you think, or Hund, dear?\"\n\n\"I wish it may be Hund.  If it be Rolf, I shall go with him.  O Ulla!\nI cannot lose sight of him, after what happened last night.  Did you\nhear?  I do wish Oddo would grow wiser.\"\n\nUlla shook her head.  \"How did Hund conduct himself yesterday?  Did you\nmark his countenance, dear?\"\n\n\"Indeed there was no helping it, any more than one can help watching a\nstorm-cloud as it comes up.\"\n\n\"So it was dark and wrathful, was it, that ugly face of his?\"  There\nwas a knock, and before Erica could reach the door, Frolich burst in.\n\n\"Such news!\" she cried--\"You never heard such news.\"\n\n\"Good or bad?\" inquired Ulla.\n\n\"Oh, bad--very bad,\" declared Frolich; \"there is a pirate vessel among\nthe islands.  She was seen off Soroe some time ago, but she is much\nnearer to us now.  There was a farmhouse seen burning on Alten fiord\nlast week, and as the family are all gone and nothing but ruins left,\nthere is little doubt the pirates lit the torch that did it.  And the\ncod has been carried off from the beach in the few places where any has\nbeen caught yet.\"\n\n\"They have not found out our fiord yet?\" inquired Ulla.\n\n\"Oh dear!  I hope not.  But they may, any day.  And father says the\ncoast must be raised, from Hammerfest to Tronyem, and a watch set till\nthis wicked vessel can be taken or driven away.  He was going to send a\nrunning message both ways, but there is something else to be done\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Another misfortune?\" asked Erica faintly.\n\n\"No; they say it is a piece of very good fortune--at least for those\nwho like bears' feet for dinner.  Somebody or other has lighted upon\nthe great bear that got away in the summer, and poked her out of her\nden on the fjelde.  She is certainly abroad with her two last year's\ncubs, and their traces have been found just above, near the foss.  Oddo\nhas come running home to tell us, and father says he must get up a hunt\nbefore more snow falls and we lose the tracks, or the family may\nestablish themselves among us and make away with our first calves.\"\n\n\"Does he expect to kill them all?\"\n\n\"I tell you we are all to grow stout on bears' feet.  For my part I\nlike bears' feet best on the other side of Tronyem.\"\n\n\"You will change your mind, Miss Frolich, when you see them on the\ntable,\" observed Ulla.\n\n\"That is just what father said.  And he asked how I thought Erica and\nStiorna would like to have a den in their neighbourhood when they got\nup to the mountain for the summer.\"\n\nErica with a sigh rose to return to the house.  In the porch she found\nOddo.\n\nWooden dwellings resound so much as to be inconvenient for those who\nhave secrets to tell.  In the porch of Peder's house Oddo had heard all\nthat passed within.\n\n\"Dear Erica,\" said he, \"I want you to do a very kind thing for me.  Do\nget leave for me to go with Rolf after the bears.  If I get one stroke\nat them--if I can but wound one of them, I shall have a paw for my\nshare, and I will lay it out for Nipen.  You will, will not you?\"\n\n\"It must be as Erlingsen chooses, Oddo, but I fancy you will not be\nallowed to go just now.\"\n\nThe establishment was now in a great hurry and bustle for an hour,\nafter which time it promised to be unusually quiet.\n\nM. Kollsen began to be anxious to be on the other side of the fiord.\nIt was rather inconvenient, as the two men were wanted to go in\ndifferent directions, while their master took a third, to rouse the\nfarmers for the bear-hunt.  The hunters were all to arrive before night\nwithin a certain distance of the thickets where the bears were now\nbelieved to be.  On calm nights it was no great hardship to spend the\ndark hours in the bivouac of the country.  Each party was to shelter\nitself under a bank of snow, or in a pit dug out of it, an enormous\nfire blazing in the midst, and brandy and tobacco being plentifully\ndistributed on such occasions.  Early in the morning the director of\nthe hunt was to go his rounds, and arrange the hunters in a ring\nenclosing the hiding-place of the bears, so that all might be prepared,\nand no waste made of the few hours of daylight which the season\nafforded.  As soon as it was light enough to see distinctly among the\ntrees, or bushes, or holes of the rocks where the bears might be\ncouched, they were to be driven from their retreat and disposed of as\nquickly as possible.  Such was the plan, well understood in such cases\nthroughout the country.  On the present occasion it might be expected\nthat the peasantry would be ready at the first summons.  Yet the more\nmessengers and helpers the better, and Erlingsen was rather vexed to\nsee Hund go with alacrity to unmoor the boat and offer officiously to\nrow the pastor across the fiord.  His daughters knew what he was\nthinking about, and, after a moment's consultation, Frolich asked\nwhether she and the maid Stiorna might not be the rowers.\n\nNobody would have objected if Hund had not.  The girls could row,\nthough they could not hunt bears, and the weather was fair enough; but\nHund shook his head, and went on preparing the boat.  His master spoke\nto him, but Hund was not remarkable for giving up his own way.  He\nwould only say that there would be plenty of time for both affairs, and\nthat he could follow the hunt when he returned, and across the lake he\nwent.\n\nErlingsen and Rolf presently departed.  The women and Peder were left\nbehind.\n\nThey occupied themselves, to keep away anxious thoughts.  Old Peder\nsang to them, too.  Hour after hour they looked for Hund.  His news of\nhis voyage, and the sending him after his master, would be something to\ndo and to think of; but Hund did not come.  Stiorna at last let fall\nthat she did not think he would come yet, for that he meant to catch\nsome cod before his return.  He had taken tackle with him for that\npurpose, she knew, and she should not wonder if he did not appear till\nthe morning.\n\nEvery one was surprised and Madame Erlingsen highly displeased.  At the\ntime when her husband would be wanting every strong arm that could be\nmustered, his servant chose to be out fishing, instead of obeying\norders.  The girls pronounced him a coward, and Peder observed that to\na coward, as well as a sluggard, there was ever a lion in the path.\nErica doubted whether this act of disobedience arose from cowardice,\nfor there were dangers in the fiord for such as went out as far as the\ncod.  She supposed Hund had heard----\n\nShe stopped short, as a sudden flash of suspicion crossed her mind.\nShe had seen Hund inquiring of Olaf about the pirates, and his strange\nobstinacy about this day's boating looked much as if he meant to learn\nmore.\n\n\"Danger in the fiord!\" repeated Orga; \"oh, you mean the pirates.  They\nare far enough from our fiord, I suppose.  If ever they do come, I wish\nthey would catch Hund and carry him off, I am sure we could spare them\nnothing they would be so welcome to.\"\n\n\"Did not you see M. Kollsen in the boat with Hund?\" Madame Erlingsen\ninquired of Oddo when he came in.\n\n\"No, Hund was quite alone, pulling with all his might down the fiord.\nThe tide was with him, so that he shot along like a fish.\"\n\n\"How do you know it was Hund that you saw?\"\n\n\"Don't I know our boat?  And don't I know his pull?  It is no more like\nRolf's then Rolf's is like master's.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he was making for the best fishing-ground as fast as he could.\"\n\n\"We shall see that by the fish he brings home.\"\n\n\"True.  By supper-time we shall know.\"\n\n\"Hund will not be home by supper-time,\" said Oddo decidedly,\n\n\"Why not?  Come, say out what you mean.\"\n\n\"Well, I will tell you what I saw, I watched him rowing as fast as his\narm and the tide would carry him.  It was so plain that there was a\nplan in his head, that I followed on from point to point, catching a\nsight now and then, till I had gone a good stretch beyond Salten\nheights.  I was just going to turn back when I took one more look, and\nhe was then pulling in for the land.\"\n\n\"On the north shore or south?\" asked Peder.\n\n\"The north--just at the narrow part of the fiord, where one can see\ninto the holes of the rocks opposite.\"\n\n\"The fiord takes a wide sweep below there,\" observed Peder.\n\n\"Yes; and that was why he landed,\" replied Oddo.  \"He was then but a\nlittle way from the fishing-ground, if he had wanted fish.  But he\ndrove up the boat into a little cove, a narrow dark creek, where it\nwill lie safe enough, I have no doubt, till he comes back--if he means\nto come back.\"\n\n[And that vessel, he knew, was the pirate schooner.]\n\n\"Why, where should he go?  What should he do but come back?\" asked\nMadame Erlingsen.\n\n\"He is now gone over the ridge to the north.  I saw him moor the boat,\nand begin to climb; and I watched his dark figure on the white snow,\nhigher and higher, till it was a speck, and I could not make it out.\"\n\n\"What do you think of this story, Peder?\" asked his mistress.\n\n\"I think Hund has taken the short cut over the promontory, on business\nof his own at the islands.  He is not on any business of yours, depend\nupon it, madame.\"\n\n\"And what business can he have among the islands?\"\n\n\"I could say that with more certainty if I knew exactly where the\npirate vessel is.\"\n\n\"That is your idea, Erica,\" said her mistress.  \"I saw what your\nthoughts were an hour ago, before we knew all this.\"\n\n\"I was thinking then, madame, that if Hund was gone to join the\npirates, Nipen would be very ready to give them a wind just now.  A\nbaffling wind would be our only defence; and we cannot expect that much\nfrom Nipen to-day.\"\n\n\"I will do anything in the world,\" cried Oddo eagerly.  \"Send me\nanywhere.  Do think of something that I can do.\"\n\n\"What must be done, Peder?\" asked his mistress.\n\n\"There is quite enough to fear, Erica, without a word of Nipen.\nPirates on the coast, and one farmhouse seen burning already.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what you must let me do, madame,\" said Erica.  \"Indeed\nyou must not oppose me.  My mind is quite set upon going for the\nboat--immediately--this very minute.  That will give us time, it will\ngive us safety for this night.  Hund might bring seven or eight men\nupon us over the promontory; but if they find no boat, I think they can\nhardly work up the windings of the fiord in their own vessel to-night;\nunless, indeed,\" she added with a sigh, \"they have a most favourable\nwind.\"\n\n\"All this is true enough,\" said her mistress; \"but how will you go?\nWill you swim?\"\n\n\"The raft, madame.\"\n\n\"And there is the old skiff on Thor islet,\" said Oddo.  \"It is a\nrickety little thing, hardly big enough for two; but it will carry down\nErica and me, if we go before the tide turns.\"\n\n\"But how will you get to Thor islet?\" inquired Madame Erlingsen.  \"I\nwish the scheme were not such a wild one.\"\n\n\"A wild one must serve at such a time, madame,\" replied Erica.  \"Rolf\nhad lashed several logs before he went.  I am sure we can get over to\nthe islet.  See, madame, the fiord is as smooth as a pond.\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" said Peder.  \"She will never repent.\"\n\n\"Then come back, I charge you, if you find the least danger,\" said her\nmistress.  \"No one is safer at the oar than you; but if there is a\nripple in the water, or a gust on the heights, or a cloud in the sky,\ncome back.  Such is my command, Erica.\"\n\n\"Wife,\" said Peder, \"give her your pelisse.  That will save her seeing\nthe girls before she goes.  And she shall have my cap, and then there\nis not an eye along that fiord that can tell whether she is man or\nwoman.\"\n\nUlla lent her deer-skin pelisse willingly enough; but she entreated\nthat Oddo might be kept at home.  She folded her arms about the boy\nwith tears; but Peder decided the matter with the words--\n\n\"Let him go.  It is the least he can do to make up for last night.\nEquip, Oddo.\"\n\nOddo equipped willingly enough.  In two minutes he and his companion\nlooked like two walking bundles of fur.  Oddo carried a frail basket,\ncontaining rye-bread, salt fish, and a flask of corn-brandy; for in\nNorway no one goes on the shortest expedition without carrying\nprovisions.\n\n\"Surely it must be dusk by this time,\" said Peder.\n\nIt was dusk; and this was well, as the pair could steal down to the\nshore without being perceived from the house.  Madame Erlingsen gave\nthem her blessing, saying that if the enterprise saved them from\nnothing worse than Hund's company this night, it would be a great good.\nThere could be no more comfort in having Hund for an inmate; for some\nimproper secret he certainly had.  Her hope was that, finding the boat\ngone, he would never show himself again.\n\n\nErica now profited by her lover's industry in the morning.  He had so\nfar advanced with the raft that, though no one would have thought of\ntaking it in its present state to the mouth of the fiord for shipment,\nit would serve as a conveyance in still water for a short distance\nsafely enough.\n\nAnd still indeed the waters were.  As Erica and Oddo were busily and\nsilently employed in tying moss round their oars to muffle their sound,\nthe ripple of the tide upon the white sand could scarcely be heard; and\nit appeared to the eye as if the lingering remains of the daylight\nbrooded on the fiord, unwilling to depart.  The stars had, however,\nbeen showing themselves for some time; and they might now be seen\ntwinkling below almost as clearly and steadily as overhead.  As Erica\nand Oddo put their little raft off from the shore, and then waited with\ntheir oars suspended, to observe whether the tide carried them towards\nthe islet they must reach, it seemed as if some invisible hand was\npushing them forth, to shiver the bright pavement of constellations as\nit lay.  Star after star was shivered, and its bright fragments danced\nin their wake; and those fragments reunited and became a star again, as\nthe waters closed over the path of the raft, and subsided into perfect\nstillness.\n\nThe tide favoured Erica's object.  A few strokes of the oar brought the\nraft to the right point for landing on the islet.  They stepped ashore,\nand towed the raft along till they came to the skiff, and then they\nfastened the raft with the boat-hook, which had been fixed there for\nthe skiff.  This done, Oddo ran to turn over the little boat and\nexamine its condition, but he found he could not move it.  It was\nfrozen fast to the ground.  It was scarcely possible to get a firm hold\nof it, it was so slippery with ice; and all pulling and pushing of the\ntwo together was in vain, though the boat was so light that either of\nthem could have lifted and carried it in a time of thaw.\n\nThis circumstance caused a great deal of delay; and what was worse, it\nobliged them to make some noise.  They struck at the ice with sharp\nstones, but it was long before they could make any visible impression,\nand Erica proposed again and again that they should proceed on the\nraft.  Oddo was unwilling.  The skiff would go so incomparably faster,\nthat it was worth spending some time upon it; and the fears he had had\nof its leaking were removed, now that he found what a sheet of ice it\nwas covered with--ice which would not melt to admit a drop of water\nwhile they were in it.  So he knocked and knocked away, wishing that\nthe echoes would be quiet for once, and then laughing as he imagined\nthe ghost stories that would spring up all round the fiord to-morrow,\nfrom the noise he was then making.\n\nErica worked hard too; and one advantage of their labour was that they\nwere well warmed before they put off again.  The boat's icy fastenings\nwere all broken at last, and it was launched; but all was not yet\nready.  The skiff had lain in a direction east and west; and its north\nside had so much thicker a coating of ice than the other, that its\nbalance was destroyed.  It hung so low on one side as to promise to\nupset with a touch.\n\n\"We must clear off more of the ice,\" said Erica.  \"But how late it is\ngrowing!\"\n\n\"No more knocking, I say,\" replied Oddo.  \"There is a quieter way of\ntrimming the boat.\"\n\nHe fastened a few stones to the gunwale on the lighter side, and took\nin a few more for the purpose of shifting the weight if necessary,\nwhile they were on their way.\n\nThey did not leave quiet behind them when they departed.  They had\nroused the multitude of eider ducks and other sea-fowl which thronged\nthe islet, and which now, being roused, began their night-feeding and\nflying, though at an earlier hour than usual.  When their discordant\ncries were left so far behind as to be softened by distance, the\nflapping of wings and swash of water, as the fowl plunged in, still\nmade the air busy all around.\n\nThe rowers were so occupied with the management of their dangerous\ncraft, that they had not spoken since they left the islet.  The skiff\nwould have been unmanageable by any maiden and boy in our country; but\non the coast of Norway, it is as natural to persons of all ages and\ndegrees to guide a boat as to walk.  Swiftly but cautiously they shot\nthrough the water.\n\n\"Are you sure you know the cove?\" asked Erica.\n\n\"Quite sure.  I wish I was as sure that Hund would not find it again\nbefore me.  Pull away.\"\n\n\"How much farther is it?\"\n\n\"Farther than I like to think of.  I doubt your arm holding out; I wish\nRolf was here.\"\n\nErica did not wish the same thing.  She thought that Rolf was, on the\nwhole, safer waging war with bears than with pirates, especially if\nHund was among them.  She pulled her oar cheerfully, observing that\nthere was no fatigue at present; and that when they were once afloat in\nthe heavier boat, and had cleared the cove, there need be no\nhurry--unless indeed they should see something of the pirate schooner\non the way; and of this she had no expectation, as the booty that might\nbe had where the fishery was beginning was worth more than anything\nthat could be found higher up the fiords, to say nothing of the danger\nof running up into the country so far as that getting away again\ndepended upon one particular wind.\n\nYet Erica looked behind her after every few strokes of her oar; and\nonce, when she saw something, her start was felt like a start of the\nskiff itself.  There was a fire glancing and gleaming and quivering\nover the water, some way down the fiord.\n\n\"Some people night-fishing,\" observed Oddo.  \"What sport they will\nhave!  I wish I was with them.  How fast we go!  How you can row when\nyou choose!  I can see the man that is holding the torch.  Cannot you\nsee his black figure?  And the spearman--see how he stands at the\nbow--now going to cast his spear!  I wish I was there.\"\n\n\"We must get farther away--into the shadow somewhere, or wait,\"\nobserved Erica.  \"I had rather not wait, it is growing so late.  We\nmight creep along under that promontory, in the shadow, if you would be\nquiet.  I wonder whether you can be silent in the sight of\nnight-fishing.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Oddo, disposed to be angry, and only kept from it by\nthe thought of last night.  He helped to bring the skiff into the\nshadow of the overhanging rocks, and only spoke once more, to whisper\nthat the fishing-boat was drifting down with the tide, and that he\nthought their cove lay between them and the fishing-party.\n\nIt was so.  As the skiff rounded the point of the promontory, Oddo\npointed out what appeared like a mere dark chasm in the high\nperpendicular wall of rock that bounded the waters.  This chasm still\nlooked so narrow on approaching it, that Erica hesitated to push her\nskiff into it, till certain that there was no one there.  Oddo was so\nclear that she might safely do this, so noiseless was their rowing, and\nit was so plain that there was no footing on the rocks by which he\nmight enter to explore, that in a sort of desperation, and seeing\nnothing else to be done, Erica agreed.  She wished it had been summer,\nwhen either of them might have learned what they wanted by swimming.\nThis was now out of the question; and stealthily therefore she pulled\nher little craft into the deepest shadow, and crept into the cove.\n\nAt a little distance from the entrance it widened, but it was a wonder\nto Erica that even Oddo's eyes should have seen Hund moor his boat here\nfrom the other side of the fiord; though the fiord was not more than a\ngunshot over in this part.  Oddo himself wondered, till he recalled how\nthe sun was shining down into the chasm at the time.  By starlight, the\noutline of all that the cove contained might be seen, the outline of\nthe boat among other things.  There she lay!  But there was something\nabout her which was unpleasant enough.  There were three men in her.\n\nWhat was to be done now?  Here was the very worst danger that Erica had\nfeared--worse than finding the boat gone--worse than meeting it in the\nwide fiord.  What was to be done?\n\nThere was nothing for it but to do nothing--to lie perfectly still in\nthe shadow, ready, however, to push out on the first movement of the\nboat to leave the cove; for, though the canoe might remain unnoticed at\npresent, it was impossible that anybody could pass out of the cove\nwithout seeing her.  In such a case there would be nothing for it but a\nrace--a race for which Erica and Oddo held themselves prepared without\nany mutual explanation, for they dared not speak.  The faintest whisper\nwould have crept over the smooth water to the ears in the larger boat.\n\nOne thing was certain--that something must happen presently.  It is\nimpossible for the hardiest men to sit inactive in a boat for any\nlength of time in a January night in Norway.  In the calmest nights the\ncold is only to be sustained by means of the glow from strong exercise.\nIt was certain that these three men could not have been long in their\nplaces, and that they would not sit many moments more without some\nchange in their arrangements.\n\nThey did not seem to be talking, for Oddo, who was the best listener in\nthe world, could not discover that a sound issued from their boat.  He\nfancied they were drowsy, and, being aware what were the consequences\nof yielding to drowsiness in severe cold, the boy began to entertain\nhigh hopes of taking these three men prisoners.  The whole country\nwould ring with such a feat performed by Erica and himself.\n\nThe men were too much awake to be made prisoners of at present.  One\nwas seen to drink from a flask, and the hoarse voice of another was\nheard grumbling, as far as the listeners could make out, at being kept\nwaiting.  The third then rose to look about him, and Erica trembled\nfrom head to foot.  He only looked upon the land, however, declared he\nsaw nothing of those he was expecting, and began to warm himself as he\nstood, by repeatedly clapping his arms across his breast.  This was\nHund.  He could not have been known by his figure, for all persons look\nalike in wolf-skin pelisses, but the voice and the action were his.\nOddo saw how Erica shuddered.  He put his finger on his lips, but Erica\nneeded no reminding of the necessity of quietness.\n\nThe other two men then rose, and after a consultation, the words of\nwhich could not be heard, all stepped ashore, one after another, and\nclimbed a rocky pathway.\n\n\"Now, now!\" whispered Erica.  \"Now we can get away.\"\n\n\"Not without the boat,\" said Oddo.  \"You would not leave them the boat?\"\n\n\"No--not if--but they will be back in a moment.  They are only gone to\nhasten their companions.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Oddo.  \"Now two strokes forward!\"\n\nWhile she gave these two strokes, which brought the skiff to the stern\nof the boat, Erica saw that Oddo had taken out a knife which gleamed in\nthe starlight.  It was for cutting the thong by which the boat was\nfastened to a birch-pole, the other end of which was hooked on shore.\nThis was to save his going ashore to unhook the pole.  It was well for\nhim that boat chains were not in use, owing to the scarcity of metal in\nthat region.  The clink of a chain would certainly have been heard.\n\nQuickly and silently he entered the boat and tied the skiff to its\nstern, and he and Erica took their places where the men had sat one\nminute before.  They used their own muffled oars to turn the boat\nround, till Oddo observed that the boat oars were muffled too.  Then\nvoices were heard again.  The men were returning.  Strongly did the two\ncompanions draw their strokes till a good breadth of water lay between\nthem and the shore, and then till they had again entered the deep\nshadow which shrouded the mouth of the cove.  There they paused.\n\n\"In with you!\" some loud voice said, as man after man was seen in\noutline coming down the pathway.  \"In with you!  We have lost time\nenough already.\"\n\n\"Where is she?  I can't see the boat,\" answered the foremost man.\n\n\"You can't miss her,\" said one behind, \"unless the brandy has got into\nyour eyes.\"\n\n\"So I should have said; but I do miss her.\"\n\nOddo shook with stifled laughter as he partly saw and partly overheard\nthe perplexity of these men.  At last one gave a deep groan, and\nanother declared that the spirits of the fiord were against them, and\nthere was no doubt that their boat was now lying twenty fathoms deep at\nthe bottom of the creek, drawn down by the strong hand of an angry\nwater-sprite.  Oddo squeezed Erica's little hand as he heard this.  If\nit had been light enough, he would have seen that even she was smiling.\n\nOne of the men mourned their having no other boat, so that they must\ngive up their plan.  Another said that if they had a dozen boats he\nwould not set foot in one after what had happened.  He should go\nstraight back, the way he came, to their own vessel.  Another said he\nwould not go till he had looked abroad over the fiord for some chance\nof seeing the boat.  This he persisted in, though told by the rest that\nit was absurd to suppose that the boat had loosed itself and gone out\ninto the fiord in the course of the two minutes that they had been\nabsent.  He showed the fragment of the cut thong in proof of the boat\nnot having loosed itself, and set off for a point on the heights which\nhe said overlooked the fiord.  One or two went with him, the rest\nreturning up the narrow pathway at some speed--such speed that Erica\nthought they were afraid of the hindmost being caught by the same enemy\nthat had taken their boat.  Oddo observed this too, and he quickened\ntheir pace by setting up very loud the mournful cry with which he was\naccustomed to call out to the plovers on the mountain-side on sporting\ndays.  No sound can be more melancholy; and now, as it rang from the\nrocks, it was so unsuitable to the place, and so terrible to the\nalready frightened men, that they ran on as fast as the slipperiness of\nthe rocks would allow, till they were all out of sight over the ridge.\n\n\"Now for it, before the other two come out above us there!\" said Oddo,\nand in another minute they were again in the fiord, keeping as much in\nthe shadow as they could, however, till they must strike over to the\nislet.\n\n\"Thank God that we came!\" exclaimed Erica.  \"We shall never forget what\nwe owe you, Oddo.  You shall see, by the care we take of your\ngrandfather and Ulla, that we do not forget what you have done this\nnight.  If Nipen will only forgive, for the sake of this----\"\n\n\"We were just in the nick of time,\" observed Oddo.  \"It was better than\nif we had been earlier.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Erica.  \"Here are their brandy-bottles, and many\nthings besides.  I had rather not have had to bring these away.\"\n\n\"But if we had been earlier they would not have had their fright.  That\nis the best part of it.  Depend upon it, some that have not said their\nprayers for long will say them to-night.\"\n\n\"That will be good.  But I do not like carrying home these things that\nare not ours.  If they are seen at Erlingsen's they may bring the\npirates down upon us.  I would leave them on the islet but that the\nskiff has to be left there too, and that would explain our trick.\"\n\nErica would not consent to throw the property overboard.  This would be\nrobbing those who had not actually injured her, whatever their\nintentions might have been.  She thought that if the goods were left\nupon some barren, uninhabited part of the shore, the pirates would\nprobably be the first to find them; and that, if not, the rumour of\nsuch an extraordinary fact, spread by the simple country people, would\nbe sure to reach them.  So Oddo carried on shore, at the first stretch\nof white beach they came to, the brandy-flasks, the bear-skins, the\ntobacco-pouch, the muskets and powder-horns, and the tinder-box.  He\nscattered these about, just above high-water mark, laughing to think\nhow report would tell of the sprites' care in placing all these\narticles out of reach of injury from the water.\n\nOddo did not want for light while doing this.  When he returned, he\nfound Erica gazing up over the towering precipices at the Northern\nLights, which had now unfurled their broad yellow blaze.  She was glad\nthat they had not appeared sooner to spoil the adventure of the night,\nbut she was thankful to have the way home thus illumined now that the\nbusiness was done.  She answered with so much alacrity to Oddo's\nquestion whether she was not very weary, that he ventured to say two\nthings which had before been upon his tongue without his having the\ncourage to utter them.\n\n\"You will not be so afraid of Nipen any more,\" observed he, glancing at\nher face, of which he could see every feature by the quivering light.\n\"You see how well everything has turned out.\"\n\n\"Oh, hush!  It is too soon yet to speak so.  It is never right to speak\nso.  Pray do not speak any more, Oddo.\"\n\n\"Well, not about that.  But what was it exactly that you thought Hund\nwould do with this boat and those people?  Did you think,\" he\ncontinued, after a short pause, \"that they would come up to Erlingsen's\nto rob the place?\"\n\n\"Not for the object of robbing the place, because there is very little\nthat is worth their taking; far less than at the fishing-grounds.  Not\nbut they might have robbed us, if they took a fancy to anything we\nhave.  No; I thought, and I still think, that they would have carried\noff Rolf, led on by Hund----\"\n\n\"Oh, ho! carried off Rolf!  So here is the secret of your wonderful\ncourage to-night, you who durst not look round at your own shadow last\nnight!  This is the secret of your not being tired, you who are out of\nbreath with rowing a mile sometimes!\"\n\n\"That is in summer,\" pleaded Erica.  \"However, you have my secret, as\nyou say, a thing which is no secret at home.  We all think that Hund\nbears such a grudge against Rolf, for having got the houseman's\nplace----\"\n\n\"And for nothing else?\"\n\n\"That,\" continued Erica, \"he would be glad to--to----\"\n\n\"To get rid of Rolf, and be a houseman, and get betrothed instead of\nhim.  Well; Hund is baulked for this time.  Rolf must look to himself\nafter to-day.\"\n\nErica sighed deeply.  She did not believe that Rolf would attend to his\nown safety; and the future looked very dark, all shrouded by her fears.\n\nBy the time the skiff was deposited where it had been found, both the\nrowers were so weary that they gave up the idea of taking the raft in\ntow, as for full security they ought to do.  They doubted whether they\ncould get home, if they had more weight to draw than their own boat.\nIt was well that they left this encumbrance behind, for there was quite\nperil and difficulty enough without it; and Erica's strength and\nspirits failed the more the farther the enemy was left behind.\n\nA breath of wind seemed to bring a sudden darkening of the friendly\nlights which had blazed up higher and brighter, from their first\nappearance till now.  Both rowers looked down the fiord, and uttered an\nexclamation at the same moment.\n\n\"See the fog!\" cried Oddo, putting fresh strength into his oar.\n\n\"O Nippen!  Nipen!\" mournfully exclaimed Erica.  \"Here it is, Oddo, the\nwest wind!\"\n\nThe west wind is, in winter, the great foe of the fishermen of the\nfiords; it brings in the fog from the sea, and the fogs of the Arctic\nCircle are no trifling enemy.  If Nipen really had the charge of the\nwinds, he could not more emphatically show his displeasure towards any\nunhappy boatman than by overtaking him with the west wind and fog.\n\n\"The wind must have just changed,\" said Oddo, pulling exhausting\nstrokes, as the fog marched towards them over the water, like a solid\nand immeasurably lofty wall.  \"The wind must have gone right round in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"To be sure, since you said what you did of Nipen,\" replied Erica\nbitterly.\n\nOddo made no answer; but he did what he could.  Erica had to tell him\nnot to wear himself out too quickly, as there was no saying now how\nlong they should be on the water.\n\nHow long they had been on the water, how far they had deviated from\ntheir right course, they could not at all tell, when, at last more by\naccident than skill, they touched the shore near home, and heard\nfriendly voices, and saw the light of torches-through the thick air.\nThe fog had wrapped them round so that they could not even see the\nwater, or each other.  They had rowed mechanically, sometimes touching\nthe rock, sometimes grazing upon the sand, but never knowing where they\nwere till the ringing of a bell, which they recognised as the farm\nbell, roused hope in their hearts, and strengthened them to throw off\nthe fatal drowsiness caused by cold and fatigue.  They made towards the\nbell; and then heard Peder's shouts, and next saw the dull light of two\ntorches which looked as if they could not burn in the fog.  The old man\nlent a strong hand to pull up the boat upon the beach, and to lift out\nthe benumbed rowers; and they were presently revived by having their\nlimbs chafed, and by a strong dose of the universal\nmedicine--corn-brandy and camphor--which, in Norway, neither man nor\nwoman, young nor old, sick nor well, thinks of refusing upon occasion.\n\nWhen Erica was in bed, warm beneath an eider-down coverlid, her\nmistress bent over her and whispered--\n\n\"You saw and heard Hund himself?\"\n\n\"Hund himself, madame.\"\n\n\"What shall we do if he comes back before my husband is home from the\nbear-hunt?\"\n\n\"If he comes, it will be in fear and penitence, thinking that all the\npowers are against him.  But oh, madame, let him never know how it\nreally was!\"\n\n\"Leave that to me, and go to sleep now, Erica.  You ought to rest well;\nfor there is no saying what you and Oddo have saved us from.  I could\nnot have asked such a service.  My husband and I must see how we can\nreward it.\"  And her kind and grateful mistress kissed Erica's cheek,\nthough Erica tried to explain that she was thinking most of some one\nelse, when she undertook this expedition.\n\n\nGreat was Stiorna's consternation at Hund's non-appearance the next\nday, seeing us she did with her own eyes that the boat was safe in its\nproper place.  She saw that no one wished him back.  He was rarely\nspoken of, and then it was with dislike or fear; and when she wept over\nthe idea of his being drowned, or carried off by hostile spirits, the\nonly comfort offered her was that she need not fear his being dead, or\nthat he could not come back if he chose.  She was indeed obliged to\nsuppose, at last, that it was his choice to keep away; for amidst the\nflying rumours that amused the inhabitants of the district for the rest\nof the winter--rumours of the movements of the pirate vessel, and of\nthe pranks of the spirits of the region--there were some such clear\nnotices of the appearance of Hund, so many eyes had seen him in one\nplace or another, by land and water, by day and night, that Stiorna\ncould not doubt of his being alive, and free to come home or stay away\nas he pleased.  She could not conceal from herself that he had probably\njoined the pirates.\n\nErlingsen and Rolf came home sooner than might reasonably have been\nexpected, and well laden with bears' flesh.  The whole family of bears\nhad been found and shot.\n\n[He sometimes hammered at his skiff.]\n\nErlingsen kept a keen and constant look-out upon the fiord.  His wife's\naccount of the adventures of the day of his absence made him anxious;\nand he never went a mile out of sight of home, so vivid in his\nimagination was the vision of his house burning, and his family at the\nmercy of pirates.\n\nSo came on and passed away the spring of this year at Erlingsen's farm.\nIt soon passed, for spring in Nordland lasts only a month.  About the\nbridges which spanned the falls were little groups of the peasants\ngathered, mending such as had burst with the floods, or strengthening\nsuch as did not seem secure enough for the passage of the herds to the\nmountain.\n\nDuring the one busy month of spring, a slight shade of sadness was\nthrown over the household within by the decline of old Ulla.  It was\nhardly sadness, it was little more than gravity; for Ulla herself was\nglad to go.  Peder knew that he should soon follow, and every one else\nwas reconciled to one who had suffered so long going to her rest.\n\nOne day Rolf led Erica to the grave when they knew that no one was\nthere.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"you know what she who lies there would like us to be\nsettling.  She herself said her burial-day would soon be over, and then\nwould come our wedding-day.\"\n\n\"When everything is ready,\" replied Erica, \"we will fix; but not now.\nThere is much to be done--there are many uncertainties.\"\n\n\"What uncertainties?  It is often an uncertainty to me, Erica, after\nall that has happened, whether you mean to marry me at all.  There are\nso many doubts, and so many considerations, and so many fears!\"\n\nErica quietly observed that they had enemies--one deadly enemy not very\nfar off, if nothing were to be said of any but human foes.  Rolf\ndeclared that he had rather have Hund for a declared enemy than for a\ncompanion.  Erica understood this very well, but she could not forget\nthat Hund wanted to be houseman in Rolf's stead, and that he desired to\nprevent their marriage.\n\n\"That is the very reason,\" said Rolf, \"why we should marry as soon as\nwe can.  Why not fix the day, and engage the pastor while he is here?\"\n\n\"Because it would hurt Peder's feelings.  There will be no difficulty\nin sending for the pastor when everything is ready.  But now, Rolf,\nthat all may go well, do promise not to run into needless danger.\"\n\n\"According to you,\" said Rolf, smiling, \"one can never get out of\ndanger.  Where is the use of taking care, if all the powers of earth\nand air are against us?\"\n\n\"I am not speaking of Nipen now--(not because I do not think of it)--I\nam speaking of Hund.  Do promise me not to go more than four miles down\nthe fiord.  After that, there is a long stretch of precipices, without\na single dwelling.  There is not a boat that could put off, there is\nnot an eye or an ear that could bear witness what had become of you if\nyou and Hund should meet there.\"\n\n\"I will promise you not to go farther down, while alone, than Vogel\nislet, unless it is quite certain that Hund and the pirates are far\nenough off in another direction.  I partly think as you do, and as\nErlingsen does, that they meant to come for me the night you carried\noff their boat; so I will be on the watch, and go no farther than where\nthey cannot hurt me.\"\n\n\"Then why say Vogel islet?  It is out of all reasonable distance.\"\n\n\"Not to those who know the fiord as I do.  I have my reasons, Erica,\nfor fixing that distance and no other; and that far I intend to go,\nwhether my friends think me able to take care of myself or not.\"\n\n\"At least,\" pleaded Erica, \"let me go with you.\"\n\n\"Not for the world, my love.\"  And Erica saw, by his look of horror at\nthe idea of her going, that he felt anything but secure from the\npirates.  He took her hand, and kissed it again and again, as he said\nthat there was plenty for that little hand to do at home, instead of\npulling the oar in the hot sun.  \"I shall think of you all while I am\nfishing,\" he went on.  \"I shall fancy you making ready for the\nseater.[2]  How happy we shall be, Erica, when we once get to the\nseater!\"\n\n\n\n[2] The mountain pasture belonging to a farm is called its seater.\n\n\n\nErica sighed, and pressed her lover's hand as he held hers.\n\n\nWho was ever happier than Rolf, when abroad in his skiff, on one of the\nmost glorious days of the year!  He found his angling tolerably\nsuccessful near home; but the farther he went the more the herrings\nabounded, and he therefore dropped down the fiord with the tide,\nfishing as he receded, till all home objects had disappeared.  When he\ncame to the narrow part of the fiord, near the creek which had been the\nscene of Erica's exploit, Rolf laid aside his rod, with the bright hook\nthat herrings so much admire, to guide his canoe through the currents\ncaused by the approach of the rocks and contraction of the passage; and\nhe then wished he had brought Erica with him, so lovely was the scene.\nHere and there a clump of dark pines overhung some busy cataract,\nwhich, itself overshadowed, sent forth its little clouds of spray,\ndancing and glittering in the sunlight.  A pair of fishing eagles were\nperched on a high ledge of rock, screaming to the echoes.  On went\nRolf, beyond the bounds of prudence, as many have done before him.  He\nsoon found himself in a still and somewhat dreary region, where there\nwas no motion but of the sea-birds, and of the air which appeared to\nquiver before the eye, from the evaporation caused by the heat of the\nsun.  Leisurely and softly did Rolf cast his net; and then steadily did\nhe draw it in, so rich in fish, that when they lay in the bottom of the\nboat, they at once sank it deeper in the water, and checked its speed\nby their weight.\n\nRolf then rested awhile.  There lay Vogel islet looming in the heated\natmosphere.  He was roused at length by a shout, and looked towards the\npoint from which it came; and there, in a little harbour of the fiord,\na recess which now actually lay behind him--between him and home--lay a\nvessel; and that vessel he knew, by a second glance, was the\npirate-schooner.\n\nOf the schooner itself he had no fear, for there was so little wind\nthat it could not have come out in time to annoy him; but there was the\nschooner's boat, with five men in it--four rowing and one\nsteering--already in full pursuit of him.  He knew, by the general air\nand native dress of the man at the helm, that it was Hund; and he\nfancied he heard Hund's malicious voice in the shout which came rushing\nover the water from their boat to his.  How fast they seemed to be\ncoming!  How the spray from their oars glittered in the sun; and how\ntheir wake lengthened with every stroke!  No spectator from the shore\n(if there had been any) could have doubted that the boat was in pursuit\nof the skiff, and would snap it up presently.  Rolf saw that he had\nfive determined foes, gaining upon him every instant; and yet he was\nnot alarmed.  He had had his reasons for thinking himself safe near\nVogel islet; and, calculating for a moment the time of the tide, he was\nquite at his ease.  As he took his oars he smiled at the hot haste of\nhis pursuers, and at the thought of the amazement they would feel when\nhe slipped through their fingers; and then he began to row.\n\nRolf did not over-heat himself with too much exertion.  He permitted\nhis foes to gain a little upon him.\n\nWhen very near the islet, however, he became more active, and his skiff\ndisappeared behind its southern point while the enemy's boat was still\ntwo furlongs off.  The steersman looked for the reappearance of the\ncanoe beyond the islet; but he looked in vain.  He thought, and his\ncompanions agreed with him, that it was foolish of Rolf to land upon\nthe islet, where they could lay hands on him in a moment; but they\ncould only suppose he had done this, and prepared to do the same.  They\nrowed quite round the islet; but, to their amazement, they could not\nonly perceive no place to land at, but there was no trace of the canoe.\nIt seemed to them as if those calm and clear waters had swallowed up\nthe skiff and Rolf, in a few minutes after they had lost sight of him.\nHund thought the case was accounted for, when he recalled Nipen's\ndispleasure.\n\nThe rowers wondered, questioned, uttered shouts, spoke all together,\nand then looked at Hund in silence, struck by his countenance; and\nfinished by rowing two or three times round the islet, slowly, and\nlooking up its bare rocky sides, which rose like walls from the water;\nbut nothing could they see or hear.  When tired of their fruitless\nsearch they returned to the schooner, ready to report to the master\nthat the fiord was enchanted.\n\nMeantime, Rolf had heard every splash of their oars, and every tone of\ntheir voices, as they rowed round his place of refuge.  He was not on\nthe islet, but in it.  This was such an island as Swein, the sea-king\nof former days, took refuge in; and Rolf was only following his\nexample.  Long before, he had discovered a curious cleft in the rock,\nvery narrow, and all but invisible at high water, even if a bush of\ndwarf ash and birch had not hung down over it.  At high water, nothing\nlarger than a bird could go in and out beneath the low arch; but there\nwas a cavern within, whose sandy floor sloped up to some distance above\nhigh-water mark.  In this cavern was Rolf.  He had thrust his little\nskiff between the walls of rock, crushing in its sides as he did so.\nThe bushes drooped behind him, hanging naturally over the entrance as\nbefore.  Rolf pulled up his broken vessel upon the little sandy beach\nwithin the cave; saved a pile of his fish, and returned a good many to\nthe water; and then sat down upon the sea-weeds to listen.  There was\nno light but a little which found its way through the bushy screen, and\nup from the green water; and the sounds--the tones of the pirates'\nvoices, and the splash of the waters against the rocky walls of his\nsingular prison--came deadened and changed to his ear.  Yet he heard\nenough to be aware how long his enemies remained, and when they were\nreally gone.\n\nIt was a prison indeed, as Rolf reflected when he looked upon his\nbroken skiff.  He could not imagine how he was to get away; for his\nfriends would certainly never think of coming to look for him here; but\nhe put off the consideration of this point for the present, and turned\naway from the image of Erica's distress when he should fail to return.\nHe amused himself now with imagining Hund's disappointment, and the\nreports which would arise from it; and he found this so very\nentertaining that he laughed aloud; and then the echo of his laughter\nsounded so very merry that it set him laughing again.  This, in its\nturn, seemed to rouse the eider-ducks that thronged the island and\ntheir clatter and commotion was so great overhead, that any spectator\nmight have been excused for believing that Vogel islet was indeed\nbewitched.\n\n\nRolf turned his boat about and about, and shook his head over every\nbruise, hole, or crack that he found, till he finished with a nod of\ndecision that nothing could be done with it.  He was a good swimmer;\nbut the nearest point of the shore was so far off that it would be all\nhe could do to reach it when the waters were in their most favourable\nstate.  At present, they were so chilled with the melted snows that\nwere pouring down from every steep along the fiord, that he doubted the\nsafety of attempting to swim at all.  What chance of release had he\nthen?\n\nIf he could by any means climb upon the rocks, in whose recesses he was\nnow hidden, he might possibly fall in with some fishing-boat which\nwould fetch him off; but, besides that the pirates were more likely to\nsee him than anybody else, he believed there was no way by which he\ncould climb upon the islet.  It had always been considered the\nexclusive property of the aquatic birds with which it swarmed, because\nits sides rose so abruptly from the water, so like the smooth stone\nwalls of a lofty building that there was no hold for foot or hand, and\nthe summit seemed unattainable by anything that had not wings.  Rolf\nremembered, however, having heard Peder say that when he was young,\nthere might be seen hanging down one part of the precipice the remains\nof a birchen ladder, which must have been made and placed there by\nhuman hands.  Rolf determined that he would try the point.  He would\nwait till the tide was flowing in, as the waters from the open sea were\nsomewhat less chilled than when returning from the head of the\nfiord:--he would take the waters at their warmest, and try and try\nagain to make a footing upon the islet.\n\nHis cave was really a very pretty place.  The golden light which\nblesses the high and low places of the earth did not disdain to cheer\nand adorn even this humble chamber, which the waters had patiently\nscooped out of the hard rock.  As the sun drew to its setting, near the\nmiddle of the Nordland summer night, it levelled its golden rays\nthrough the cleft, and made the place far more brilliant than at noon.\nThe beach suddenly appeared of a more dazzling white, and the waters of\na deeper green, while, by their motion, they cast quivering circles of\nreflected light upon the roof, which had before been invisible.  Rolf\nhad supposed, from the pleasant freshness of the air, that the cave was\nlofty; and he now saw that the roof did indeed spring up to a vast\nheight.  He saw also that there was a great deal of driftwood\naccumulated; and some of it thrown into such distant corners as to\nprove that the waves could dash up to a much higher water-line, in\nstormy weather, than he had supposed.  No matter!  He hoped to be gone\nbefore there were any more storms.  Tired and sleepy as he was, so near\nmidnight, he made an exertion, while there was plenty of light, to\nclear away the sea-weeds from a space on the sand where he must\nto-morrow make his fire and broil his fish.  The smell of the smallest\nquantity of burnt weed would be intolerable in so confined a place; so\nhe cleared away every sprout of it, and laid some of the drift-wood on\na spot above high-water mark, picking out the driest pieces of firewood\nhe could find for kindling a flame.\n\nWhen this was done, he made haste to heap up a bed of fine dry sand in\na corner; and here he lay down as the twilight darkened.  For this one\nnight he could rest without any very painful thoughts of poor Erica;\nfor she was prepared for his remaining out till the middle of the next\nday, at least.\n\nWhen he awoke in the morning, the scene was marvellously changed.  His\ncave was so dim that he could scarcely distinguish its white floor from\nits rocky sides.  The water was low, and the cleft therefore enlarged;\nso that he saw at once that now was the time for making his fire--now\nwhen there was the freest access for the air.  Yet he could not help\npausing to admire what he saw.  He could see now a long strip of the\nfiord--a perspective of waters and of shores, ending in a lofty peak\nstill capped with snow, and glittering in the sunlight.  He began to\nsing, while rubbing together, with all his might, the dry sticks of fir\nwith which his fire was to be kindled.  First they smoked, and then, by\na skilful breath of air, they blazed, and set fire to the heap; and by\nthe time the herrings were ready for broiling, the cave was so filled\nwith smoke that Rolf's singing was turned to coughing.\n\nSome of the smoke hung in soot on the roof and walls of the cave,\ncurling up so well at first that Rolf almost thought there must be some\nopening in the lofty roof which served as a chimney.  But there was\nnot; and some of the smoke came down again, issuing at last from the\nmouth of the cave.  Rolf observed this; and, seeing the danger of his\nplace of retreat being thus discovered, he made haste to finish his\ncookery, resolving that, if he had to remain here for any length of\ntime, he would always make his fire in the night.  He presently threw\nwater over his burning brands, and hoped that nothing had been seen of\nthe process of preparing his breakfast.\n\nThe smoke had been seen, however, and by several people; but in such a\nway as to lead to no discovery of the cave.  From the schooner, Hund\nkept his eyes fixed on the islet, at every moment he had to spare.\nEither he was the murderer of his fellow-servant, or the islet was\nbewitched; and if Rolf was under the protection and favour of the\npowers of the region, he, Hund, was out of favour, and might expect bad\nconsequences.  Whichever might be the case, Hund was very uneasy; and\nhe could think of nothing but the islet, and look no other way.  His\ncompanions had at first joked him about his luck in getting rid of his\nenemies; but, being themselves superstitious, they caught the infection\nof his gravity, and watched the spot almost as carefully as he.\n\nAs their vessel lay higher up in the fiord than the islet, they were on\nthe opposite side from the crevice, and could not see from whence the\nsmoke issued.  But they saw it in the form of a light cloud hanging\nover the place.  Hund's eyes were fixed upon it, when one of his\ncomrades touched him on the shoulder.  Hund started.\n\n\"You see there,\" said the man, pointing.\n\n\"To be sure I do.  What else was I looking at?\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" inquired the man.  \"Has your friend got a\nvisitor--come a great way this morning?  They say the mountain-sprite\ntravels in mist.  If so, it is now going.  See, there it sails\noff--melts away.  It is as like common smoke as anything that ever I\nsaw.  What say you to taking the boat, and trying again whether there\nis no place where your friend might not land, and be now making a fire\namong the birds' nests?\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" cried Hund.  \"What became of the skiff, then?\"\n\n\"True,\" said the man; and, shaking his head, he passed on, and spoke to\nthe master.\n\nIn his own secret mind, the master of the schooner did not quite like\nhis present situation.  After hearing the words dropped by his crew, he\ndid not relish being stationed between the bewitched islet and the head\nof the fiord, where all the residents were, of course, enemies.  As\nthere was now a light wind, enough to take his vessel down, he gave\norders accordingly.\n\nSlowly, and at some distance, the schooner passed the islet, and all on\nboard crowded together to see what they could see.  None saw anything\nremarkable; but all heard something.  There was a faint muffled sound\nof knocks--blows such as were never heard in a mere haunt of sea-birds.\nIt was evident that the birds were disturbed by it.  They rose and\nfell, made short flights and came back again, fluttered, and sometimes\nscreamed.  But if they were quiet for a minute, the knock, knock, was\nheard again, with great regularity, and every knock went to Hund's\nheart.\n\nThe fact was that, after breakfast, Rolf soon became tired of having\nnothing to do.  The water was so very cold that he deferred till noon\nthe attempt to swim round the islet.  He thought he had better try to\nmend his little craft than do nothing.  After collecting from the wood\nin the cave all the nails that happened to be sticking in it, and all\nthe pieces that were sound enough to patch a boat with, he made a stone\nserve him for a hammer, straightened his nails upon another stone, and\ntried to fasten on a piece of wood over a hole.  It was discouraging\nwork enough; but it helped to pass the hours till the restless waters\nreached their highest mark in the cave, when he knew that it was noon,\nand time for his little expedition.\n\nIt was too cold by far for safe swimming.  All the snows of Sulitelma\ncould hardly have made the waters more chilly to the swimmer than they\nfelt at the first plunge.  But Rolf would not retreat for this reason.\nHe thought of the sunshine outside, and of the free open view he should\nenjoy, dived beneath the almost closed entrance, and came up on the\nother side.  The first thing he saw was the schooner, now lying below\nhis island, and the next thing was a small boat between him and it,\nevidently making towards him.  When convinced that Hund was one of the\nthree men in it, he saw that he must go back, or make haste to finish\nhis expedition.  He made haste, swam round so close as to touch the\nwarm rock in many places, and could not discover, any more than before,\nany trace of a footing by which a man might climb to the summit.  There\nwas a crevice or two, however, from which vegetation hung, still left\nunsearched.  He could not search them now, for he must make haste home.\n\nThe boat was indeed so near when he had reached the point he set out\nfrom, that he used every effort to conceal himself; and it seemed that\nhe could only have escaped by the eyes of his enemies being fixed on\nthe summit of the rock.  When once more in the cave he rather enjoyed\nhearing them come nearer and nearer, so that the bushes which hung down\nbetween him and them shook with the wind of their oars, and dipped into\nthe waves.  He laughed silently when he heard one of them swear that he\nwould not leave the spot till he had seen something, upon which another\nrebuked his presumption.  Presently a voice, which he knew to be\nHund's, called upon his name, at first gently, and then more and more\nloudly, as if taking courage at not being answered.\n\n\"I will wait till he rounds the point,\" thought Rolf, \"and then give\nhim such an answer as may send a guilty man away quicker than he came.\"\n\nHe waited till they were on the opposite side, so that his voice might\nappear to come from the summit of the islet, and then began with the\nmelancholy sound used to lure the plover on the moors.  The men in the\nboat instantly observed that this was the same sound used when\nErlingsen's boat was spirited away from them.  It was rather singular\nthat Rolf and Oddo should have used the same sound; but they probably\nchose it as the most mournful they knew.  Rolf moaned louder and\nlouder, till the sound resembled the bellowing of a tormented spirit\nenclosed in the rock; and the consequence was, as he had said, that his\nenemies retreated faster than they came.\n\nFor the next few days Rolf kept a close watch upon the proceedings of\nthe pirates, and saw enough of their thievery to be able to lay\ninformation against them, if ever he should again make his way to a\ntown or village, and see the face of a magistrate.  The worst of it was\nthat the season for boating was nearly at an end.  The inhabitants were\nday by day driving their cattle up the mountains, there to remain for\nthe summer; and the heads of families remained in the farmhouses almost\nalone, and little likely to put out so far into the fiord as to pass\nnear him.  To drive off thoughts of his poor distressed Erica, he\nsometimes hammered a little at his skiff; but it was too plain that no\nbotching that he could perform in the cave would render the broken\ncraft safe to float in.\n\nOne sunny day, when the tide was flowing in warmer than usual, Rolf\namused himself with more evolutions in bathing than he had hitherto\nindulged in.  He forgot his troubles and his foes in diving, floating,\nand swimming.  As he dashed round a point of a rock, he saw something,\nand was certain he was seen.  Hund appeared at least as much bewitched\nas the islet itself, for he could not keep away from it.  He seemed\nirresistibly drawn to the scene of his guilt and terror.  Here he was\nnow, with one other man, in the schooner's smallest boat.  Rolf had to\ndetermine in an instant what to do; for they were within a hundred\nyards, and Hund's starting eyes showed that he saw what he took for the\nghost of his fellow-servant.  Rolf raised himself as high as he could\nout of the water, throwing his arms up above his head, fixed his eyes\non Hund, uttered a shrill cry, and dived, hoping to rise to the surface\nat some point out of sight.  Hund looked no more.  After one shriek of\nterror and remorse had burst from his white lips, he sank his head upon\nhis knee and let his comrade take all the trouble of rowing home again.\n\nThis vision decided Hund's proceedings.  Half-crazed with remorse, he\nleft the pirates that night.  After long consideration where to go, he\ndecided upon returning to Erlingsen's.  He did not know to what extent\nthey suspected him; he was pretty sure that they held no proofs against\nhim.  He felt irresistibly drawn towards poor Erica, now that no rival\nwas there; and if mixed with all these considerations there were some\nthoughts of the situation of houseman being vacant, and needing much to\nbe filled up, it is no wonder that such a mingling of motives took\nplace in a mind so selfish as Hund's.\n\nHund performed his journey by night.  He did not for a moment think of\ngoing by the fiord.  Laboriously and diligently therefore he overcame\nthe difficulties of the path, crossing ravines, wading through swamps,\nscaling rocks, leaping across water-courses, and only now and then\nthrowing himself down on some tempting slope of grass, to wipe his\nbrows, and to moisten his parched throat with the wild strawberries\nwhich were fast ripening in the sheltered nooks of the hills.  It was\nnow so near midsummer, and the nights were so fast melting into the\ndays, that Hund could at the latest scarcely see a star, though there\nwas not a fleece of cloud in the whole circle of the heavens.  While\nyet the sun was sparkling on the fiord, and glittering on every\nfarmhouse window that fronted the west, all around was as still as if\nthe deepest darkness had settled down.  Hund knew as he passed one\ndwelling after another--knew as well as if he had looked in at the\nwindows--that the inhabitants were all asleep, even with the sunshine\nlying across their very faces.\n\nEvery few minutes he observed how his shadow lengthened, and he longed\nfor the brief twilight which would now soon be coming on.  There were a\nfew extremely faint stars--a very few--for only the brightest could now\nshow themselves in the sky where daylight lingered so as never quite to\ndepart.  A pale green hue remained where the sun had disappeared, and a\ndeep red glow was even now beginning to kindle where he was soon to\nrise.  But man must have rest, be the sun high or sunk beneath the\nhorizon; so that Hund saw no face, and heard no human voice, before he\nfound himself standing at the top of the steep rocky pathway which led\ndown to Erlingsen's abode.\n\nHe found everything in a different state from that in which he had left\nthe place.  The stable-doors stood wide, and there was no trace of\nmilk-pails.  The hurdles of the fold were piled upon one another in a\ncorner of the yard.  It was plain that herd, flock, and dairy-women\nwere gone to the mountain; and though Hund dreaded meeting Erica, it\nstruck upon his heart to think that she was not here.  He felt now how\nmuch it was for her sake that he had come back.\n\nHis eye fell upon the boat which lay gently rocking with the receding\ntide in its tiny cove; and he resolved to lie down in it and rest,\nwhile considering what to do next.  He went down, stepping gently over\nthe pebbles of the beach lest his tread should reach and waken any ear\nthrough the open windows, lay down at the bottom of the boat, and fell\nasleep.\n\nOddo was the first to come forth, to water the one horse that remained\nat the farm, and to give a turn and a shake to the two or three little\ncocks of hay which had been mown behind the house.  His quick eye noted\nthe deep marks of a man's feet in the sand and pebbles below high-water\nmark proving that some one had been on the premises during the night.\nHe followed these marks to the boat, where he was amazed to find the\nenemy (as he called Hund) fast asleep.  Oddo was in a great hurry to\ntell his grandfather (Erlingsen being on the mountain); but he thought\nit only proper caution to secure his prize from escaping in his absence.\n\nHe summoned his companion, the dog which had warned him of many dangers\nabroad, and helped him faithfully with his work at home; and nothing\ncould be clearer to Skorro than that he was to crouch on the thwarts of\nthe boat, with his nose close to Hund's face, and not to let Hund stir\ntill Oddo came back.  Then Oddo ran, and wakened his grandfather, who\nmade all haste to rise and dress.  Erica now lived in Peder's house.\nHearing Oddo's story, she rushed out, and her voice was soon heard in\npassionate entreaty, above the bark of the dog, which was trying to\nprevent the prisoner from rising.\n\n\"Only tell me,\" Erica was heard to say, \"only tell me where and how he\ndied.  I know he is dead--I knew he would die; from that terrible night\nwhen we were betrothed.  Tell me who did it--for I am sure you know.\nWas it Nipen?  O Hund, speak!  Say only where his body is, and I will\ntry--I will try never to speak to you again--never to----\"\n\n[No other than the Mountain-Demon.]\n\nHund looked miserable; he moved his lips, but no sound was heard\nmingling with Erica's rapid speech.\n\nMadame Erlingsen, who, with Orga, had by this time reached the spot,\nlaid her hand on Erica's arm, to beg for a moment's silence, made Oddo\ncall his dog out of the boat, and then spoke, in a severe tone, to Hund.\n\n\"Why do you shake your head, Hund, and speak no word?  Say what you\nknow, for the sake of those whom, we grievously suspect, you have\ndeeply injured.  Say what you know, Hund.\"\n\n\"What I say is, that I do not know,\" replied Hund in a hoarse and\nagitated voice.  \"I only know that we live in an enchanted place, here\nby this fiord, and that the spirits try to make us answer for their\ndoings.  The very first night after I went forth, this very boat was\nspirited away from me, so that I could not come home.  Nipen had a\nspite against me there--to make you all suspect me.  I declare to you\nthat the boat was gone, in a twinkling, by magic, and I heard the cry\nof the spirit that took it.\"\n\n\"What was the cry like?\" asked Oddo gravely.\n\n\"Where were you, that you were not spirited away with the boat?\" asked\nhis mistress.\n\n\"I was tumbled out upon the shore, I don't know how,\" declared Hund;\n\"found myself sprawling on a rock, while the creature's cries brought\nmy heart into my mouth as I lay.\"\n\n\"Alone?  Were you alone?\" asked his mistress.\n\n\"I had landed the pastor some hours before, madame; and I took nobody\nelse with me, as Stiorna can tell, for she saw me go.\"\n\n\"Stiorna is at the mountain,\" observed madame coolly.\n\n\"But, Hund,\" said Oddo, \"how did Nipen take hold of you when it laid\nyou sprawling on the rock?  Neck and heels?  Or did it bid you go and\nhearken whether the pirates were coming, and whip away the boat before\nyou came back?  Are you quite sure that you sprawled on the rock at all\nbefore you ran away from the horrible cry you speak of?  Our rocks are\nvery slippery when Nipen is at one's heels.\"\n\nHund stared at Oddo, and his voice was yet hoarser when he said that he\nhad long thought that boy was a favourite with Nipen, and he was sure\nof it now.\n\nErica had thrown herself down on the sand hiding her face on her hands,\non the edge of the boat, as if in despair of her misery being attended\nto--her questions answered.  Old Peder stood beside her, stroking her\nhair tenderly, and he now spoke the things she could not.\n\n\"Attend to me, Hund,\" said Peder, in the grave, quiet tone which every\none regarded.  \"Hear my words; and for your own sake answer them.  We\nsuspect you of being in communication with the pirates yonder; we\nsuspect that you went to meet them when you refused to go hunting the\nbears.  We know that you have long felt ill-will towards Rolf--envy of\nhim--jealousy of him--and----\"\n\nHere Erica looked up, pale as ashes, and said: \"Do not question him\nfurther.  There is no truth in his answers.  He spoke falsehood even\nnow.\"\n\nPeder knew how Hund shrank under this, and thought the present the\nmoment to get truth out of him, if he ever could speak it.  He\ntherefore went on to say--\n\n\"We suspect you of having done something to keep your rival out of the\nway, in order that you might obtain the house and situation--and\nperhaps something else that you wish.\"\n\n\"Have you killed him?\" asked Erica abruptly, looking full in his face.\n\n\"No,\" returned Hund firmly.  From his manner everybody believed this\nmuch.\n\n\"Do you know that anybody else has killed him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you know whether he is alive or dead?\"\n\nTo this Hund could, in the confusion of his ideas about Rolf's fate and\ncondition, fairly say \"No;\" as also to the question, \"Do you know where\nhe is?\"\n\nThen they all cried out--\n\n\"Tell us what you do know about him.\"\n\n\"Ay, there you come,\" said Hund, resuming some courage, and putting on\nthe appearance of more than he had.  \"You load me with foul\naccusations, and when you find yourselves all in the wrong, you alter\nyour tone, and put yourselves under obligation to me for what I will\ntell.  I will treat you better than you treat me, and I will tell you\nplainly why.  I repent of my feelings towards my fellow-servant, now\nthat evil has befallen him----\"\n\n\"What?  Oh, what?\" cried Erica.\n\n\"He was seen fishing on the fiord in that poor little worn-out skiff.\nI myself saw him.  And when I looked next for the skiff, it was gone.\"\n\n\"And where were you?\"\n\n\"Never mind where I was.  I was about my own business.  And I tell you,\nI no more laid a finger on him than any one of you.\"\n\n\"Where was it?\"\n\n\"Close by Vogel islet.\"\n\nErica started, and in one moment's flush of hope told that Rolf had\nsaid he should be safe at any time near Vogel islet.  Hund caught at\nher words so eagerly as to make a favourable impression on all, who\nsaw, what was indeed the truth, that he would have been glad to know\nthat Rolf was alive.\n\n\"I believe some of the things you have told.  I believe that you did\nnot lay hands on Rolf.\"\n\n\"Bless you!  Bless you for that!\" interrupted Hund, almost forgetting\nhow far he really was guilty.\n\n\"Tell me then,\" proceeded Erica, \"how you believe he really perished.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" whispered Hund, \"that the strong hand pulled him\ndown--down to the bottom.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" said Erica, turning away.\n\n\"Erica--one word,\" exclaimed Hund.  \"I must stay here--I am very\nmiserable, and I must stay here and work, and work till I get some\ncomfort.  But you must tell me how you think of me--you must say that\nyou do not hate me----\"\n\n\"I do hate you,\" said Erica with disgust, as her suspicions of his\nwanting to fill Rolf's place were renewed, \"I mistrust you, Hund, more\ndeeply than I can tell.\"\n\n\"Will no penitence change your feelings, Erica?  I tell you I am as\nmiserable as you.\"\n\n\"That is false, like everything else that you say,\" cried Erica.  \"I\nwish you would go--go and seek Rolf under the waters.\"\n\nHund shuddered at the thought, as it recalled what he had seen and\nheard at the islet.  Erica saw this, and sternly repeated--\n\n\"Go and bring back Rolf from the deeps, and then I will cease to hate\nyou.\"\n\nAs Erica slowly returned into Peder's house, Oddo ran past, and was\nthere before her.  He closed the door when she had entered, put his\nhand within hers, and said--\n\n\"Did Rolf really tell you that he should be safe anywhere near Vogel\nislet?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Erica, \"safe from the pirates.  That was his answer when\nI begged him not to go so far down the fiord; but Rolf always had an\nanswer when one asked him not to go into danger.\"\n\n\"Erica, you went one trip with me, and I know you are brave.  Will you\ngo another?  Will you go to the islet and see what Rolf could have\nmeant about being safe there?\"\n\nErica brightened for a moment, and perhaps would have agreed to go; but\nPeder came in, and Peder said he knew the islet well, and that it was\nuniversally considered that it was now inaccessible to human foot, and\nthat that was the reason why the fowl flourished there as they did in\nno other place.  Erica must not be permitted to go so far down among\nthe haunts of the pirates.  Instead of this, her mistress had just\ndecided that, as there were no present means of getting rid of Hund,\nand as Erica could not be expected to remain just now in his presence,\nshe should set off immediately for the mountain, and request Erlingsen\nto come home.\n\nUnder Peder's urgency she made up her bundle of clothes, took in her\nhand her lure,[3] with which to call home the cattle in the evenings,\nbade her mistress farewell privately, and stole away without Hund's\nknowledge.\n\n\n\n[3] The lure is a wooden trumpet, nearly five feet long, made of two\nhollow pieces of birch-wood, bound together throughout the whole length\nwith slips of willow.  It is used to call the cattle together on a wide\npasture.\n\n\n\nWandering with unwilling steps farther and farther from the spot where\nshe had last seen Rolf, Erica dashed the tears from her eyes, and\nlooked behind her at the entrance of a ravine which would hide from her\nthe fiord and the dwelling she had left.  Thor islet lay like a\nfragment of the leafy forest cast into the blue waters, but Vogel islet\ncould not be seen.  It was not too far down to be seen from an\nelevation like this, but it was hidden behind the promontories by which\nthe fiord was contracted.  She looked behind her no more, but made her\nway rapidly through the ravine; the more rapidly because she had seen a\nman ascending by the same path at no great distance, and she had little\ninclination to be joined by a party of wandering Laplanders, still less\nby any neighbour from the fiord who might think civility required that\nhe should escort her to the seater.  This wayfarer was walking at a\npace so much faster than hers that he would soon pass, and she would\nhide among the rocks beside the tarn at the head of the ravine till he\nhad gone by.\n\nThrough the rich pasture Erica waded till she reached the tarn which\nfed the stream that gambolled down the ravine.  The death-cold\nunfathomed waters lay calm and still under the shelter of the rocks\nwhich nearly surrounded them.\n\nIn the shadow of one of these rocks, Erica sank down into the long\ngrass.  Here she would remain long enough to let the other wayfarer\nhave a good start up the mountain, and by that time she should be cool\nand tranquillised.  She hid her face in the fragrant grass, and did not\nlook up again till the grief of her soul was stilled.  Then her eye and\nher heart were open to the beauty of the place which she had made her\ntemple of worship, and she gazed around till she saw something that\nsurprised her.\n\nThe traveller, who she had hoped was now some way up the mountain, was\nstanding on the margin of the tarn, immediately opposite to her.\n\nShe sat up, and took her bundle and her lure, believing now that she\nmust accept the unwelcome civility of an escort for the whole of the\nrest of the way, and thinking that she might as well make haste and get\nit over.  The man approached and took his seat on the huge stone beside\nher, crossed his arms, made no greeting, but looked her full in the\nface.\n\nShe did not know the face, nor was it like any that she had ever seen.\nThere was such long hair, and so much beard, that the eyes seemed the\nonly feature which made any distinct impression.  Erica's heart now\nbegan to beat violently.  Though wishing to be alone, she had not\ndreamed of being afraid till now; but now it occurred to her that she\nwas seeing the rarest of sights--one not seen twice in a century, no\nother than the mountain-demon.\n\nShe sprang to her feet, and began to wade back through the high grass\nto the pathway, almost expecting to be seized by a strong hand and cast\ninto the unfathomable tarn, whose waters were said to well up from the\ncentre of the earth.  Her companion, however, merely walked by her\nside.  As he did not offer to carry her bundle, he could be no\ncountryman of hers.\n\nThey walked quietly on till the tarn was left some way behind.  Erica\nfound she was not to die that way.  Presently after, she came in sight\nof a settlement of Lapps--a cluster of low and dirty tents, round which\nsome tame reindeer were feeding.  Erica was not sorry to see these,\nthough no one knew better than she the helpless cowardice of these\npeople; and it was not easy to say what assistance they could afford\nagainst the mountain-demon.  Yet they were human beings, and would\nappear in answer to a cry.  She involuntarily shifted her lure, to be\nready to utter a call.  The stranger stopped to look at the distant\ntents, and Erica went on at the same pace.  He presently overtook her,\nand pointed towards the Lapps with an inquiring look.  Erica only\nnodded.\n\n\"Why you no speak?\" growled the stranger in broken language.\n\n\"Because I have nothing to say,\" declared Erica, in the sudden vivacity\ninspired by the discovery that this was probably no demon.  Her doubts\nwere renewed, however, by the next question.\n\n\"Is the bishop coming?\"\n\nNow, none were supposed to have a deeper interest in the holy bishop's\ntravels than the evil spirits of any region through which he was to\npass.\n\n\"Yes, he is coming,\" replied Erica.  \"Are you afraid of him?\"\n\nThe stranger burst into a loud laugh at her question: and very like a\nmocking fiend he looked, as his thick beard parted to show his wide\nmouth, with its two ranges of teeth.  When he finished laughing, he\nsaid, \"No, no--we no fear bishop.\"\n\n\"'We!'\" repeated Erica to herself.  \"He speaks for his tribe as well as\nhimself.\"\n\n\"We no fear bishop,\" said the stranger, still laughing.  \"You no\nfear----\" and he pointed to the long stretch of path--the prodigious\nascent before them.\n\nErica said there was nothing to fear on the mountain for those who did\ntheir duty to the powers, as it was her intention to do.  Her first\nGammel cheese was to be for him whose due it was, and it should be the\nbest she could make.\n\nThis speech she thought would suit, whatever might be the nature of her\ncompanion.  If it was the demon, she could do no more to please him\nthan promise him his cheese.\n\nHer companion seemed not to understand or attend to what she said.\n\nWhen Erica saw that she had no demon for a companion, but only a\nforeigner, she was so much relieved as not to be afraid at all.\n\nThe stranger pointed to the tiny cove in which Erlingsen's farm might\nbe seen, looking no bigger than an infant's toy, and said--\n\n\"Do you leave an enemy there, or is Hund now your friend?\"\n\n\"Hund is nobody's friend, unless he happens to be yours,\" Erica\nreplied, perceiving at once that her companion belonged to the pirates.\n\"Hund is everybody's enemy; and, above all, he is an enemy to himself.\nHe is a wretched man.\"\n\n\"The bishop will cure that,\" said the stranger.  \"He is coward enough\nto call in the bishop to cure all.  When comes the bishop?\"\n\n\"Next week.\"\n\n\"What day, and what hour?\"\n\nErica did not choose to gratify so close a curiosity as this.  She did\nnot reply; and while silent, was not sorry to hear the distant sound of\ncattle-bells--and Erlingsen's cattle-bells too.  The stranger did not\nseem to notice the sound, even though quickening his pace to suit\nErica's, who pressed on faster when she believed protection was at\nhand.  And yet the next thing the stranger said brought her to a full\nstop.  He said he thought a part of Hund's business with the bishop\nwould be to get him to disenchant the fiord, so that boats might not be\nspirited away almost before men's eyes, and that a rower and his skiff\nmight not sink like lead one day, and the man may be heard the second\nday, and seen the third, so that there was no satisfactory knowledge as\nto whether he was really dead.  Erica stopped, and her eager looks made\nthe inquiry which her lips could not speak.  Her eagerness put her\ncompanion on his guard, and he would explain no further than by saying\nthat the fiord was certainly enchanted, and that strange tales were\ncirculating all round its shores, very striking to a stranger; a\nstranger had nothing more to do with the wonders of a country than to\nlisten to them.  He wanted to turn the conversation back to Hund.\nHaving found out that he was at Erlingsen's, he next tried to discover\nwhat he had said and done since his arrival.  Erica told the little\nthere was to tell--that he seemed full of sorrow and remorse.  She told\nthis in hope of a further explanation about drowned men being seen\nalive, but the stranger stopped when the bells were heard again, and a\nwoman's voice singing, nearer still.  He complimented Erica on her\ncourage, and turned to go back the way he came, and walked away rapidly.\n\nThe only thing now to be done was to run forwards.  Erica forgot heat,\nweariness, and the safety of her property, and ran on towards the\nsinging voice.  In five minutes she found the singer, Frolich, lying\nalong the ground and picking cloud-berries, with which she was filling\nher basket for supper.\n\n\"Where is Erlingsen?--quick--quick!\" cried Erica.\n\n\"My father?  You may just see him with your good eyes--up there.\"\n\nAnd Frolich pointed to a patch of verdure on a slope high up the\nmountain, where the gazer might just discern that there were haycocks\nstanding, and two or three moving figures beside them.\n\n\"Stiorna is there to-day, besides Jan.  They hope to finish this\nevening,\" said Frolich; \"and so here I am, all alone; and I am glad you\nhave come to help me to have a good supper ready for them.  Their\nhunger will beat all my berry-gathering.\"\n\n\"You are alone!\" said Erica, discovering that it was well that the\npirate had turned back when he did.  \"You alone, and gathering berries,\ninstead of having an eye on the cattle!\"\n\n\"But why are your hands empty?\" asked Frolich.  \"Who is to lend you\nclothes?  And what will the cows say to your leaving your lure behind,\nwhen you know they like it so much better than Stiorna's?\"\n\nErica returned for her bundle and lure; and then proceeded to an\neminence where two or three of her cows were grazing, and there sounded\nher lure.  She put her whole strength to it, in hope that others\nbesides the cattle might appear in answer, for she was really anxious\nto see her master.\n\nThe peculiar and far from musical sounds spread wide over the pastures\nand up the slopes, and through the distant woods, so that the cattle of\nanother seater stood to listen, and her own cows began to move, leaving\nthe sweetest tufts of grass and rising up from their couches in the\nrichest herbage, to converge towards the point whence she called.  The\nfar-off herdsman observed to his fellow that there was a new call among\nthe pastures; and Erlingsen, on the upland, desired Jan and Stiorna to\nfinish cocking the hay, and began his descent to his seater, to learn\nwhether Erica had brought any news from home.\n\nLong before he could appear, Frolich threw herself down at Erica's feet.\n\n\"You want news,\" said Erica, avoiding as usual all conversation about\nher superstitions.  \"How will it please you that the bishop is coming?\"\n\n\"Very much, if we had any chance of seeing him.  Very much, whether we\nsee him or not, if he can give any help--any advice.  My poor Erica, I\ndo not like to ask; but you have had no good news, I fear.\"\n\nErica shook her head.\n\n\"I saw that in your face in a moment.  Do not speak about it till you\ntell my father.  He may help you, I cannot; so do not tell me anything.\"\n\nErica was glad to take her at her word.  She kissed Frolich's hand,\nwhich lay on her knee, in token of thanks, and then inquired whether\nany Gammel cheese was made yet.\n\n\"No,\" said Frolich, inwardly sighing for news.  \"We have the whey, but\nnot sweet cream enough till after this evening's milking.  So you are\njust in time.\"\n\nErica was glad, as she could not otherwise have been sure of the demon\nhaving his due.\n\n\"There is your father,\" said Erica.  \"Now do go and gather more\nberries, Frolich.  There are not half enough.\"\n\n\nIt may be supposed that Erlingsen was anxious to be at home when he had\nheard Erica's story.  He was not to be detained by any promise of\nberries and cream for supper.  He put away the thought even of his hay,\nyet unfinished on the upland, and would hear nothing that Frolich had\nto say of his fatigue at the end of a long working day.  He took some\nprovision with him, drank off a glass of corn-brandy, and set off at a\ngood pace down the mountain.\n\nScarcely a word was spoken (though the mountain-dairies have the\nreputation of being the merriest places in the world), till Erica and\nFrolich were about their cheese-making the next morning.  Erica had\nrather have kept the cattle; but Frolich so earnestly begged that she\nwould let Stiorna do that, as she could not destroy the cattle in her\nill-humour, while she might easily spoil the cheese, that Erica put\naway her knitting, tied on her apron, tucked up her sleeves, and\nprepared for the great work.\n\n\"Frolich,\" said Erica, \"is the cream good?\"\n\n\"Stiorna would say that the demon will smack his lips over it.  Come\nand taste.\"\n\n\"Do not speak so, dear.\"\n\n\"I was only quoting Stiorna----\"\n\n\"What are you saying about me?\" inquired Stiorna, appearing at the\ndoor.  \"Only talking about the cream and the cheese?  Are you sure of\nthat?  Bless me! what a smell of the yellow flowers!  It will be a\nprime cheese.\"\n\n\"How can you leave the cattle, Stiorna?\" cried Erica.  \"If they are all\ngone when you get back----\"\n\n\"Well, come then, and see the sight.  I get scolded either way always.\nYou would have scolded me finely to-night if I had not called you to\nsee the sight.\"\n\n\"What sight?\"\n\n\"Why, there is such a procession of boats on the fiord that you would\nsuppose there were three weddings happening at once.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\" exclaimed Frolich, dolefully looking at the cream,\nwhich had reached such a point that the stirring could not cease for a\nminute without risk of spoiling the cheese.\n\nErica took the long wooden spoon from Frolich's hand, and bade her run\nand see where the bishop (for no doubt it was the bishop) was going to\nland.  The cream should not spoil while she was absent.\n\nFrolich bounded away over the grass, declaring that if it was the\nbishop going to her father's, she could not possibly stay on the\nmountain for all the cheeses in Nordland.  Erica remained alone,\npatiently stirring the cream, and hardly heeding the heat of the fire,\nwhile planning how the bishop would be told her story, and how he would\nexamine Hund, and perhaps be able to give some news of the pirates, and\ncertainly be ready with his advice.  Some degree of hope arose within\nher as she thought of the esteem in which all Norway held the wisdom\nand kindness of the Bishop of Tronyem, and then again she felt it hard\nto be absent during the visit of the only person to whom she looked for\ncomfort.\n\nFrolich returned after a long while to defer her hopes a little.  The\nboats had all drawn to shore on the northern side of the fiord, where,\nno doubt, the bishop had a visit to pay before proceeding to\nErlingsen's.  The cheese-making might yet be done in time, even if\nFrolich should be sent for from home to see and be seen by the good\nbishop.\n\n\nThe day after Erica's departure to the dairy, Peder was sitting alone\nin his house weaving a frail basket.  He sighed to think how empty and\nsilent the house appeared.  Erica's light, active step was gone.\nRolf's hearty laugh was silent, perhaps for ever.  Oddo was an inmate\nstill, but Oddo was much altered of late; and who could wonder?\n\nFrom the hour of Hund's return, the boy had hardly been heard to speak.\nAll these thoughts were too melancholy for old Peder; and, to break the\nsilence, he began to sing as he wove his basket.\n\nHe had nearly got through a ballad of a hundred and five stanzas when\nhe heard a footstep on the floor.\n\n\"Oddo, my boy,\" said he, \"surely you are in early.  Can it be\ndinner-time yet?\"\n\n\"No, not this hour,\" replied Oddo in a low voice, which sank to a\nwhisper as he said, \"I have left Hund laying the troughs to water the\nmeadow;[4] and if he misses me I don't care.  I could not stay; I could\nnot help coming; and if he kills me for telling you, he may, for tell\nyou I must.\"\n\n\n\n[4] The strips of meadow which lie between high rocks in Norway would\nbe parched by the reflection of the long summer sunshine, and\nunproductive, if the inhabitants did not use great industry in the\nirrigation of their lands.  They conduct water from the spring-heads by\nmeans of hollow trunks of trees laid end to end, through which water\nflows in the directions in which It is wanted, sometimes for an extent\nof fifty miles from one spring.\n\n\n\nAnd Oddo went to close and fasten the door; and then he sat down on the\nground, rested his arms on his grandfather's knees, and told his story\nin such a low tone that no \"little bird\" under the eaves could \"carry\nthe matter.\"\n\n\"O grandfather, what a mind that fellow has!  He will go crazy with\nhorror soon.  I am not sure that he is not crazy now.\"\n\n\"He has murdered Rolf, has he?\"\n\n\"I can't be sure.  He is like one bewitched, that cannot hold his\ntongue.  While I was bringing the troughs, one by one, for him to lay,\nwhere the meadow was driest, he still kept muttering and muttering to\nhimself.  As often as I came within six yards of him, I heard him\nmutter, mutter.  Then when I helped him to lay the troughs, he began to\ntalk to me.  I was not in the mind to make him many answers; but on he\nwent, just the same as if I had asked him a hundred questions.\"\n\n\"It was such an opportunity for a curious boy, that I wonder you did\nnot.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I might, if he had stopped long enough.  But if he stopped for\na moment to wipe his brow (for he was all trembling with the heat), he\nbegan again before I could well speak.  He asked me whether I had ever\nheard that drowned men could show their heads above water, and stare\nwith their eyes, and throw their arms about, a whole day--two days\nafter they were drowned.\"\n\n\"Ay!  Indeed!  Did he ask that?\"\n\n\"Yes, and several other things.  He asked whether I had ever heard that\nthe islets in the fiord were so many prison-houses.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\n\"I wanted him to explain; so I said they were prison-houses to the\neider-ducks when they were sitting, for they never stir a yard from\ntheir nests.  But he did not heed a word I spoke.  He went on about\ndrowned men being kept prisoners in the islets, moaning because they\ncan't get out.  And he says they will knock, knock, as if they could\ncleave the thick hard rock.\"\n\n\"What do you think of all this, my boy?\"\n\n\"Why, when I said I had not heard a word of any such thing, even from\nmy grandmother or Erica, he declared he had heard the moans\nhimself--moaning and crying; but then he mixed up something about the\nbarking of wolves that made confusion in the story.  Though he had been\nhot just before, there he stood shivering, as if it was winter, as he\nstood in the broiling sun.  Then I asked him if he had seen dead men\nswim and stare, as he said he had heard them moan and cry.\"\n\n\"And what did he say then?\"\n\n\"He started bolt upright, as if I had been picking his pocket.  He was\nin a passion for a minute, I know, if ever he was in his life.  Then he\ntried to laugh as he said what a lot of new stories--stories of\nspirits, such stories as people love--he should have to carry home to\nthe north, whenever he went back to his own place.\"\n\n\"In the north, his own place in the north!  He wanted to mislead you\nthere, boy.  Hund was born some way to the south.\"\n\n\"No, was he really?  How is one to believe a word he says, except when\nhe speaks as if he was in his sleep, straight out from his conscience,\nI suppose?  He began to talk about the bishop next, wanting to know\nwhen I thought he would come, and whether he was apt to hold private\ntalk with every sort of person at the houses he stayed at.\"\n\n\"How did you answer him?  You know nothing about the bishop's visits.\"\n\n[At the end of a ledge he found the remains of a ladder\nmade of birch-poles.]\n\n\"So I told him; but, to try him, I said I knew one thing, that a\nquantity of fresh fish would be wanted when the bishop comes with his\ntrain, and I asked him whether he would go fishing with me as soon as\nwe could hear that the bishop was drawing near.\"\n\n\"He would not agree to that, I fancy.\"\n\n\"He asked how far out I thought of going.  Of course I said to Vogel\nislet--at least as far as Vogel islet.  Do you know, grandfather, I\nthought he would have knocked me down at the word.  He muttered\nsomething, I could not hear what, to get off.  By that time we were\nlaying the last trough.  I asked him to go for some more; and the\nminute he was out of sight I scampered here.  Now, what sort of a mind\ndo you think this fellow has?\"\n\n\"Not an easy one, it is plain.  It is too clear also that he thinks\nRolf is drowned.\"\n\n\"But do you think so, grandfather?\"\n\n\"Do you think so, grandson?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it.  Depend upon it, Rolf is all alive, if he is swimming\nand staring, and throwing his arms about in the water.  I think I see\nhim now.  And I will see him, if he is to be seen alive or dead.\"\n\n\"And pray how?\"\n\n\"I ought to have said, if you will help me.  You say sometimes,\ngrandfather, that you can pull a good stroke with the oar still, and I\ncan steer as well as our master himself; and the fiord never was\nstiller than it is to-day.  Think what it would be to bring home Rolf,\nor some good news of him!  We would have a race up to the seater\nafterwards to see who could be the first to tell Erica.\"\n\n\"Gently, gently, boy!  What is Rolf about not to come home, if he is\nalive?\"\n\n\"That we shall learn from him.  Did you hear that he told Erica he\nshould go as far as Vogel islet, dropping something about being safe\nthere from pirates and everything?\"\n\nPeder really thought there was something in this.  He sent off Oddo to\nhis work in the little meadow, and himself sought out Madame Erlingsen,\nwho, having less belief in spirits and enchantments than Peder, was in\nproportion more struck with the necessity of seeing whether there was\nany meaning in Hund's revelations, lest Rolf should be perishing for\nwant of help.  The story of his disappearance had spread through the\nwhole region; and there was not a fisherman on the fiord who had not,\nby this time, given an opinion as to how he was drowned.  But madame\nwas well aware that, if he were only wrecked, there was no sign that he\ncould make that would not terrify the superstitious minds of the\nneighbours, and make them keep aloof, instead of helping him.  In\naddition to all this, it was doubtful whether his signals would be seen\nby anybody, at a season when every one who could be spared was gone up\nto the dairies.\n\nAs soon as Hund was gone out after dinner, the old man and his grandson\nput off in the boat, carrying a note from Madame Erlingsen to her\nneighbours along the fiord, requesting the assistance of one or two\nrowers on an occasion which might prove one of life and death.  The\nneighbours were obliging; so that the boat was soon in fast career down\nthe fiord, Oddo full of expectation, and of pride in commanding such an\nexpedition, and Peder being relieved from all necessity of rowing more\nthan he liked.\n\nOddo had found occasionally the truth of a common proverb--he had\neasily brought his master's horses to the water, but could not make\nthem drink.  He now found that he had easily got rowers into the boat,\nbut that it was impossible to make them row beyond a certain point.  He\nhad used as much discretion as Peder himself about not revealing the\nprecise place of their destination; and when Vogel islet came in sight,\nthe two helpers at once gave him hints to steer so as to keep as near\nthe shore and as far from the island as possible.  Oddo gravely steered\nfor the island notwithstanding.  When the men saw that this was his\nresolution they shipped their oars, and refused to strike another\nstroke, unless one of them might steer.  That island had a bad\nreputation, it was betwitched or haunted; and in that direction the men\nwould not go.  They were willing to do all they could to oblige; they\nwould row twenty miles without resting with pleasure; but they would\nnot brave Nipen, nor any other demon, for any consideration.\n\n\"How far off is it, Oddo?\" asked Peder.\n\n\"Two miles, grandfather.  Can you and I manage it by ourselves, think\nyou?\"\n\n\"Ay, surely; if we can land these friends of ours.  They will wait\nashore till we call for them again.\"\n\n\"I will leave you my supper, if you will wait for us here, on this\nheadland,\" said Oddo to the man.\n\nThe men could make no other objection than that they were certain the\nboat would never return.  They were very civil--would not accept Oddo's\nsupper on any account--would remain on the watch--wished their friends\nwould be persuaded; and, when they found all persuasion in vain,\ndeclared they would bear testimony to Erica, and as long as they should\nlive, to the bravery of the old man and boy who thus threw away their\nlives in search of a comrade who had fallen a victim to Nipen.\n\nAmidst these friendly words, the old man and his grandson put off once\nmore alone, making straight for the islet.  Of the two Peder was the\ngreater hero, for he saw the most ground for fear.\n\n\"Promise me, Oddo,\" said he, \"not to take advantage of my not seeing.\nAs sure as you observe anything strange, tell me exactly what you see.\"\n\n\"I will, grandfather.  There is nothing yet but what is so beautiful\nthat I could not for the life of me find out anything to be afraid of.\"\n\nOddo rowed stoutly too for some way, and then he stopped to ask on what\nside the remains of a birch ladder used to hang down, as Peder had\noften told him.\n\n\"On the north side, but there is no use in looking for that, my boy.\nThat birch ladder must have rotted away with frost and wet long and\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"It is likely,\" said Oddo, \"but, thinking that some man must have put\nit there, I should like to see whether it really is impossible for one\nwith a strong hand and light foot to mount this wall.  I brought our\nlongest boat-hook on purpose to try.  Where a ladder hung before, a\nfoot must have climbed; and if I mount, Rolf may have mounted before\nme.\"\n\nIt chilled Peder's heart to remember the aspect of the precipice which\nhis boy talked of climbing; but he said nothing, feeling that it would\nbe in vain.  This forbearance touched Oddo's feelings.\n\n\"I will run into no folly, trust me,\" said he.  \"I do not forget that\nyou depend on me for getting home, and that the truth about Nipen and\nsuch things depends for an age to come on our being seen at home again\nsafe.  But I have a pretty clear notion that Rolf is somewhere on the\ntop there.\"\n\n\"Suppose you call him, then.\"\n\nOddo had much rather catch him.  He pictured to himself the pride and\npleasure of mastering the ascent, the delight of surprising Rolf asleep\nin his solitude, and the fun of standing over him to waken him, and\nwitness his surprise.  He could not give up the attempt to scale the\nrock, but he would do it very cautiously.\n\nSlowly and watchfully they passed round the islet, Oddo seeking with\nhis eye any ledge of the rock on which he might mount.  Pulling off his\nshoes that his bare feet might have the better hold, and stripping off\nalmost all his clothes, for lightness in climbing and perhaps swimming,\nhe clambered up to more than one promising spot, and then, finding that\nfurther progress was impossible, had to come down again.  At last,\nseeing a narrow chasm filled with leafy shrubs, he determined to try\nhow high he could reach by means of these.  He swung himself up by\nmeans of a bush which grew downwards, having its roots firmly fixed in\na crevice of the rock.  This gave him hold of another, which brought\nhim in reach of a third, so that, making his way like a squirrel or a\nmonkey, he found himself hanging at such a height that it seemed easier\nto go on than to turn back.  For some time after leaving his\ngrandfather he had spoken to him, as an assurance of his safety.  When\ntoo far off to speak, he had sung aloud, to save the old man from\nfears; and now that he did not feel at all sure whether he should ever\nget up or down, he began to whistle cheerily.  He was pleased to hear\nit answered from the boat.  The thought of the old man sitting there\nalone, and his return wholly depending upon the safety of his\ncompanion, animated Oddo afresh to find a way up the rock.  It looked\nto him as like a wall as any other rock about the islet.  There was no\nfooting where he was looking, that was certain.  So he advanced farther\ninto the chasm, where the rocks so nearly met that a giant's arm might\nhave touched the opposite wall.  Here there was promise of release from\nhis dangerous situation.  At the end of a ledge he saw something like\npoles hanging on the rock--some work of human hands, certainly.  Having\nscrambled towards them, he found the remains of a ladder made of birch\npoles fastened together with thongs of leather.  This ladder had once,\nno doubt, hung from top to bottom of the chasm, and its lower part, now\ngone, was that ladder of which Peder had often spoken as a proof that\nmen had been on the island.\n\nWith a careful hand Oddo pulled at the ladder, and it did not give way.\nHe tugged harder, and still it only shook.  He must try it; there was\nnothing else to be done.  It was well for him now that he was used to\ndangerous climbing--that he had had adventures on the slippery, cracked\nglaciers of Sulitelma--and that being on a height, with precipices\nbelow, was no new situation to him.  He climbed, trusting as little as\npossible to the ladder, setting his foot in preference on any\nprojection of the rock, or any root of the smallest shrub.  More than\none pole cracked, more than one fastening gave way, when he had barely\ntime to shift his weight upon a better support.  He heard his\ngrandfather's voice calling, and he could not answer.  It disturbed\nhim, now that his joints were strained, his limbs trembling, and his\nmouth parched so that his breath rattled as it came.\n\nHe reached the top, however.  He sprang from the edge of the precipice,\nunable to look down, threw himself on his face, and panted and\ntrembled, as if he had never before climbed anything less safe than a\nstaircase.  Never before, indeed, had he done anything like this.  The\nfeat was performed--the islet was not to him inaccessible.  This\nthought gave him strength.  He sprang to his feet again, and whistled\nloud and shrill.  He could imagine the comfort this must be to Peder;\nand he whistled more and more merrily till he found himself rested\nenough to proceed on his search for Rolf.  He went briskly on his way,\nnot troubling himself with any thoughts of how he was to get down again.\n\nNever had he seen a place so full of water-birds and their nests.\nTheir nests strewed all the ground, and they themselves were strutting\nand waddling, fluttering and vociferating, in every direction.  They\nwere perfectly tame, knowing nothing of men, and having had no\nexperience of disturbance.  The ducks that were leading their broods\nallowed Oddo to stroke their feathers, and the drakes looked on,\nwithout taking any offence.\n\n\"If Rolf is here,\" thought Oddo, \"he has been living on most amiable\nterms with his neighbours.\"\n\nAfter an anxious thought or two of Nipen--after a glance or two round\nthe sky and shores for a sign of wind--Oddo began in earnest his quest\nof Rolf.  He called his name gently, then louder.\n\nThere was some kind of answer.  Some sound of human voice he heard, he\nwas certain; but so muffled, so dull, that whence it came he could not\ntell.  It might even be his grandfather calling from below.  So he\ncrossed to quite the verge of the little island, wishing with all his\nheart that the birds would be quiet, and cease their civility of all\nanswering when he spoke.  When quite out of hearing of Peder, Oddo\ncalled again, with scarcely a hope of any result, so plain was it to\nhis eyes that no one resided on the island.  On its small summit there\nwas really no intermission of birds' nests--no space where any one had\nlain down--no sign of habitation, no vestige of food, dress, or\nutensils.  With a saddened heart, therefore, Oddo called again, and\nagain he was sure there was an answer, though whence and what he could\nnot make out.\n\nHe then sang a part of a chant that he had learnt by Rolf singing it as\nhe sat carving his share of the new pulpit.  He stopped in the middle,\nand presently believed that he heard the air continued, though the\nvoice seemed so indistinct, and the music so much as if it came from\nunderground, that Oddo began to recall, with some doubt and fear, the\nstories of the enchantment of the place.  It was not long before he\nheard a cry from the water below.  Looking over the precipice, he saw\nwhat made him draw back in terror: he saw the very thing Hund had\ndescribed--the swimming and staring head of Rolf, and the arms thrown\nup in the air.  Not having Hund's conscience, however, and having much\nmore curiosity, he looked again, and then a third time.\n\n\"Are you Rolf, really?\" asked he at last.\n\n\"Yes, but who are you--Oddo or the demon--up there where nobody can\nclimb?  Who are you?\"\n\n\"I will show you.  We will find each other out,\" thought Oddo, with a\ndetermination to take the leap and ascertain the truth.\n\nHe leaped, and struck the water at a sufficient distance from Rolf.\nWhen he came up again, they approached each other, staring, and each\nwith some doubt as to whether the other was human or a demon.\n\n\"Are you really alive, Rolf?\" said the one.\n\n\"To be sure I am, Oddo,\" said the other; \"but what demon carried you to\nthe top of that rock, that no man ever climbed?\"\n\nOddo looked mysterious, suddenly resolving to keep his secret for the\npresent.\n\n\"Not that way,\" said Rolf.  \"I have not the strength I had, and I can't\nswim round the place now.  I was just resting myself when I heard you\ncall, and came out to see.  Follow me home.\"\n\nHe turned and began to swim homewards.  Oddo had the strongest\ninclination to go with him, to see what would be revealed, but there\nwere two objections.  His grandfather must be growing anxious, and he\nwas not perfectly sure yet whether his guide might not be Nipen in\nRolf's likeness about to lead him to some hidden prison.\n\n\"Give me your hand, Rolf,\" said the boy bravely.\n\nIt was a real, substantial, warm hand.\n\n\"I don't wonder you doubt,\" said Rolf; \"I can't look much like\nmyself--unshaven, and shrunk, and haggard as my face must be.\"\n\nOddo was now quite satisfied; and he told of the boat and his\ngrandfather.  The boat was scarcely farther off than the cave, and poor\nRolf was almost in extremity for drink.  The water and brandy he\nbrought with him had been finished nearly two days, and he was\nsuffering extremely from thirst.  He thought he could reach the boat\nand Oddo led the way, bidding him not mind his being without clothes\ntill they could find him some.\n\nGlad was the old man to hear his boy's call from the water; and his\nface lighted up with wonder and pleasure when he heard that Rolf was\nnot far behind.  He lent a hand to help him into the boat, and asked no\nquestions till he had given him food and drink.  He reproached himself\nfor having brought neither camphor nor assafoetida, to administer with\nthe corn-brandy.  Here was the brandy, however, and some water, and\nfish, and bread, and cloud-berries.  Great was the amazement of Peder\nand Oddo at Rolf's pushing aside the brandy, and seizing the water.\nWhen he had drained the last drop, he even preferred the cloud-berries\nto the brandy.  A transient doubt thence occurred, whether this was\nRolf after all.  Rolf saw it in their faces, and laughed; and when they\nhad heard his story of what he had suffered from thirst, they were\nquite satisfied, and wondered no longer.\n\nHe was all impatience to be gone.  It tried him more now to think how\nlong it would be before Erica could hear of his preservation than to\nbear all that had gone before.  Being without clothes, however, it was\nnecessary to visit the cave, and bring away what was there.  In truth,\nOddo was not sorry for this.  His curiosity about the cave was so great\nthat he felt it impossible to go home without seeing it; and the\nadvantage of holding the secret knowledge of such a place was one which\nhe would not give up.  He seized an oar, gave another to Rolf; and they\nwere presently off the mouth of the cave.  Peder sighed at their having\nto leave him again; but he believed what Rolf said of there being no\ndanger, and of their remaining close at hand.  One or the other came\npopping up beside the boat every minute, with clothes, or net, or\nlines, or brandy-flask, and finally with the oars of the poor broken\nskiff, being obliged to leave the skiff itself behind.  Rolf did not\nforget to bring away whole handfuls of beautiful shells, which he had\namused himself with collecting for Erica.\n\nAt last they entered the boat again; and while they were dressing, Oddo\ncharmed his grandfather with a description of the cave--of the dark,\nsounding walls, the lofty roof, and the green tide breaking on the\nwhite sands.  It almost made the listener cool to hear of these things;\nbut, as Oddo had remarked, the heat had abated.  It was near midnight,\nand the sun was going to set.  Their row to the shore would be in the\ncool twilight; and then they should take in companions, who, fresh from\nrest, would save them the trouble of rowing home.\n\nWhen all were too tired to talk, and the oars were dipping somewhat\nlazily, and the breeze had died away, and the sea-birds were quiet, old\nPeder, who appeared to his companions to be asleep, raised his head,\nand said--\n\n\"I heard a sob.  Are you crying, Oddo?\"\n\n\"Yes, grandfather.\"\n\n\"What is your grief, my boy?\"\n\n\"No grief, anything but grief now.  I have felt more grief than you\nknow of, though, or anybody.  I did not know it fully myself till now.\"\n\n\"Right, my boy; and right to say it out too.\"\n\n\"I don't care now who knows how miserable I have been.  I did not\nbelieve, all the time, that Nipen had anything to do with these\nmisfortunes----\"\n\n\"Right, Oddo!\" exclaimed Rolf now.\n\n\"But I was not quite certain; and how could I say a word against it\nwhen I was the one to provoke Nipen?  Now Rolf is safe, and Erica will\nbe happy again, and I shall not feel as if everybody's eyes were upon\nme, and know that it is only out of kindness that they do not reproach\nme as having done all the mischief.  I shall hold up my head again\nnow--as some may think I have done all along; but I did not, in my own\neyes--no, not in my own eyes, for all these weary days that are gone.\"\n\n\"Well, they are gone now,\" said Rolf.  \"Let them go by and be\nforgotten.\"\n\n\"Nay, not forgotten,\" said Peder.  \"How is my boy to learn if he\nforgets----\"\n\n\"Don't fear that for me, grandfather,\" said Oddo, as the tears still\nstreamed down his face.  \"No fear of that.  I shall not forget these\nlast days;--no, not as long as I live.\"\n\nThe comrades who were waiting and watching on the point were duly\namazed to see three heads in the boat, on her return; and duly\ndelighted to find that the third was Rolf--alive and no ghost.  They\nasked question upon question, and Rolf answered some fully and truly,\nwhile he showed reserve upon others; and at last, when closely pressed,\nhe declared himself too much exhausted to talk, and begged permission\nto lie down in the bottom of the boat and sleep.  Upon this a long\nsilence ensued.  It lasted till the farmhouse was in sight at which one\nof the rowers was to be landed.  Oddo then exclaimed--\n\n\"I wonder what we all have been thinking about.  We have not settled a\nsingle thing about what is to be said and done; and here we are almost\nin sight of home, and Hund's cunning eyes.\"\n\n\"I have settled all about it,\" replied Rolf, raising himself up from\nthe bottom of the boat, where they all thought he had been sleeping\nsoundly.  \"My mind,\" said he, \"is quite clear.  The first thing I have\ndecided upon is that I may rely on the honour of our friends here to\nsay nothing yet.  You have proved your kindness, friends, in coming on\nthis expedition, but for which I should have died in my hole, like a\nsuperannuated bear in its den.  This is a story that the whole country\nwill hear of; and our grandchildren will tell it, on winter nights,\nwhen there is talk of the war that brought the pirates on our coasts.\nThe best way will be for you to set me ashore some way short of home,\nand ask Erlingsen to meet me at the Black Tarn.  There cannot be a\nquieter place; and I shall be so far on my way to the seater.\"\n\n\"If you will just make a looking-glass of the Black Tarn,\" said Oddo,\n\"you will see that you have no business to carry such a face as yours\nto the seater.  Erica will die of terror at you for the mountain-demon,\nbefore you can persuade her it is only you.\"\n\n\"I was thinking,\" observed one of the rowers, who relished the idea of\ngoing down to posterity in a wonderful story, \"I was just thinking that\nyour wisest way will be to take a rest in my bed at Holberg's, without\nanybody knowing, and shave yourself with my razor, and dress in my\nSunday clothes, and show yourself to your betrothed in such a trim as\nthat she will be glad to see you.\"\n\n\"Do so, Rolf,\" urged Peder.  Everybody said \"do so,\" and agreed that\nErica would suffer far less by remaining five or six hours longer in\nher present state of mind, than by seeing her lover look like a ghastly\nsavage, or perhaps hearing that he was lying by the roadside, dying of\nhis exertions to reach her.  Rolf tried to laugh at all this; but he\ncould not contradict it.\n\nAll took place as it was settled in the boat.  Before the people on a\nneighbour's farm had come in to breakfast, Rolf was snug in bed, with a\nlarge pitcher of whey by the bedside, to quench his still insatiable\nthirst.  No one but the neighbours knew of his being there; and he got\naway unseen in the afternoon, rested, shaven, and dressed, so as to\nlook more like himself, though still haggard.  Packing his old clothes\ninto a bundle, which he carried with a stick over his shoulder, and\nladen with nothing else but a few rye-cakes and a flask of the\neverlasting corn-brandy, he set forth, thanking his hosts very heartily\nfor their care, and somewhat mysteriously assuring them that they would\nhear something soon, and that meantime they had better not have to be\nsought far from home.\n\nAs he expected, he met no one whom he knew.  Nine-tenths of the\nneighbours were far away on the seaters; and of the small remainder,\nalmost all were attending the bishop on the opposite shore of the lake.\nRolf shook his head at every deserted farmhouse that he passed,\nthinking how the pirates might ransack the dwellings if they should\nhappen to discover that few inhabitants remained in them but those\nwhose limbs were too old to climb the mountain.  He shook his head\nagain when he thought what consternation he might spread through these\ndwellings by dropping at the doors the news of how near the pirate\nschooner lay.  It seemed to be out of the people's minds now, because\nit was out of sight, and the bishop had become visible instead.  As for\nthe security which some talked of from there being so little worth\ntaking in the Nordland farmhouses--this might be true if only one house\nwas to be attacked, and that one defended; but half-a-dozen ruffians,\ncoming ashore to search eight or ten undefended houses in a day, might\ngather enough booty to pay them for their trouble.  Of money they would\nfind little or none; but in some families there were gold chains,\ncrosses, and earrings, which had come down from a remote generation; or\nsilver goblets and tankards.  There were goats worth carrying away for\ntheir milk, and spirited horses and their harness to sell at a\ndistance.  There were stores of the finest bed and table linen in the\nworld, sacks of flour, cellars full of ale, kegs of brandy, and a mass\nof tobacco in every house.  Fervently did Rolf wish, as he passed by\nthese comfortable dwellings, that the enemy would cast no eye or\nthought upon their comforts till he should have given such information\nin the proper quarters as should deprive them of the power of doing\nmischief in this neighbourhood.\n\nThe breeze blew in his face, refreshing him with its coolness, and with\nthe fragrance of the birch, with which it was loaded.  But it brought\nsomething else--a transient sound which surprised Rolf--voices of men,\nwho seemed, if he could judge from so rapid a hint, to be talking\nangrily.  He began to consider whom, besides Oddo, Elringsen could have\nthought it safe or necessary to bring with him, or whether it was\nsomebody met with by chance.  At all events, it would be wisest not to\nshow himself, and to approach with all possible caution.  Cautiously,\ntherefore, he drew near, keeping a vigilant watch all around, and ready\nto pop down into the grass on any alarm.  Being unable to see anyone\nnear the tarn, he was convinced the talkers must be seated under the\ncrags on its margin; and he therefore made a circuit to get behind the\nrocks, and then climbed a huge fragment, which seemed to have been\ntoppled down from some steep, and to have rolled to the brink of the\nwater.  Two stunted pines grew out from the summit of this crag; and\nbetween these pines Rolf placed himself, and looked down from thence.\n\nTwo men sat on the ground in the shadow of the rock.  One was Hund, and\nthe other must undoubtedly be one of the pirate crew.  His dress, arms,\nand broken language all showed him to be so; and it was, in fact, the\nsame man that Erica had met near the same place, though that she had\nhad such an adventure was the last thing her lover dreamed of as he\nsurveyed the man's figure from above.\n\nThis man appeared surly.  Hund was extremely agitated.\n\n\"It is very hard,\" said he, \"when all I want is to do no harm to\nanybody--neither to my old friends nor my new acquaintances--that I\ncannot be let alone.  I have done too much mischief in my life already.\nThe demons have made sport of me.  It is their sport that I have as\nmany lives to answer for as any man of twice my age in Nordland; and\nnow that I would be harmless for the rest of my days----\"\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself to talk about your days,\" interrupted the\npirate, \"they will be too few to be worth speaking of, if you do not\nput yourself under our orders again.  You are a deserter--and as a\ndeserter you go back with me, unless you choose to go as a comrade.\"\n\n\"And what might I expect that your orders would be, if I went with you?\"\n\n\"You know very well that we want you for a guide.  That is all you are\nworth.  In a fight, you would only be in the way--unless indeed you\ncould contrive to get out of the way.\"\n\n\"Then you would not expect me to fight against my master and his\npeople?\"\n\n\"Nobody was ever so foolish as to expect you to fight, more or less, I\nshould think.  No, your business would be to pilot us to Erlingsen's,\nand answer truly all our questions about their ways and doings.\"\n\n\"Surprise them in their sleep!\" muttered Hund.  \"Wake them up with the\nlight of their own burning roofs!  And they would know me by that\nlight!  They would point me out to the bishop;--they would find time in\ntheir hurry to mark me for the monster they might well think me!\"\n\n\"Yes; you would be in the front, of course,\" observed the pirate.  \"But\nthere is one comfort for you--if you are so earnest to see the bishop,\nas you told me you were, my plan is the best.  When once we lock him\ndown on board our schooner, you can have him all to yourself.  You can\nconfess your sins to him the whole day long; for nobody else will want\na word with either of you.  You can show him your enchanted island,\ndown in the fiord, and see if he can lay the ghost for you.\"\n\n[In desperation Hund, unarmed as he was, threw himself\nupon the pirate.]\n\nHund sprang to his feet in an agony of passion.  The well-armed pirate\nwas up as soon as he.  Rolf drew back two paces, to be out of sight, if\nby chance they should look up, and armed himself with a heavy stone.\nHe heard the pirate say--\n\n\"You can try to run away, if you like; I shall shoot you through the\nhead before you have gone five yards.  And you may refuse to return\nwith me; and then I shall know how to report of you to my captain.  I\nshall tell him that you are lying at the bottom of this lake--if it has\na bottom--with a stone tied round your neck, like a drowned wild cat.\nI hope you may chance to find your enemy there, to make the place the\npleasanter.\"\n\nRolf could not resist the impulse to send his heavy stone into the\nmiddle of the tarn, to see the effect upon the men below.  He gave a\ngood cast, on the very instant; and prodigious was the splash, as the\nstone hit the water, precisely in the middle of the little lake.  The\nmen did not see the cause of the commotion that followed; but, staring\nand turning at the splash, they saw the rings spreading in the dark\nwaters which had lain as still as the heavens but a moment before.  How\ncould two guilty, superstitious men doubt that the waters were thrown\ninto agitation by the pirate's last words?  Yet they glanced fearfully\nround the whole landscape, far and near.  They saw no living thing but\na hawk which, startled from its perch on a scathed pine was wheeling\nround in the air in an unsteady flight.  The pirate pointed to the bird\nwith one hand, while he laid the other on the pistol in his belt.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hund, trembling, \"the bird saw it.  Did you see it?\"\n\n\"See what?\"\n\n\"The water-sprite, Uldra.  Before you throw me in to the water-sprite,\nwe will see which is the strongest.\"\n\nAnd in desperation Hund, unarmed as he was, threw himself upon the\npirate, sprang at his throat, and both wrestled with all their force.\nRolf could not but look; and he saw that the pirate had drawn forth his\npistol, and that all would be over with Hund in a moment if he did not\ninterfere.  He stood forward between the two pine stems, on the ridge\nof the rock, and uttered very loud the mournful cry which had so\nterrified his enemies at Vogel islet.  The combatants flew asunder, as\nif parted by a flash of lightning.  Both looked up to the point whence\nthe sound had come; and there they saw what they supposed to be Rolf's\nspectre, pointing at them, and the eyes staring as when looking up from\nthe waters of the fiord.  How could these guilty and superstitious men\ndoubt that it was Rolf's spectre, which, rising through the centre of\nthe tarn, had caused the late commotion in its waters?  Away they\nfled--at first in different directions; but it amused Rolf to observe\nthat rather than be alone, Hund turned to follow the track of the\ntyrant, who had just been threatening and insulting him, and driving\nhim to struggle for his life.\n\n\"Ay,\" thought Rolf, \"it is his conscience that makes me so much more\nterrible to him than that ruffian.  I never hurt a hair of his head;\nand yet, through his conscience, my face is worse than the blasting\nlightning to his eyes.  Heigh-ho!  Where is Erlingsen?  It is nothing\nshort of cruel to keep me waiting to-day, of all days; and in this\nspot, of all places--almost within sight of the seater where my poor\nErica sits pining, and seeing nothing of the pastures, but only, with\nher minds' eye, the sea-caves where she thinks these limbs are\nstretched, cold and helpless, as in a grave.  A pretty story I shall\nhave to tell her, if she will only believe it, of another sort of\nsea-cave.\"\n\nTo pass the time he took out the shells he had collected for Erica, and\nadmired them afresh, and planned where she would place them, so as best\nto adorn their sitting-room, when they were married.  Erlingsen arrived\nbefore he had been thus engaged five minutes; and indeed before he had\nbeen more than a quarter of an hour altogether at the place of meeting.\n\n\"My dear master!\" exclaimed Rolf, on seeing him coming, \"have pity on\nErica and me, and hear what I have to tell you, that I may be gone.\"\n\n\"You shall be gone at once, my good fellow!  I will walk with you, and\nyou shall tell your story as we go.\"\n\nRolf shook his head, and objected that he could not, in conscience,\ntake Erlingsen a step further from home than was necessary, as he was\nonly too much wanted there.\n\n\"Is that Oddo yonder?\" he asked.  \"He said you would bring him.\"\n\n\"Yes; he has grown trustworthy of late.  We have had fewer heads and\nhands among us than the times require since Peder grew old and blind,\nand you were missing, and Hund had to be watched instead of trusted.\nSo we have been obliged to make a man of Oddo, though he has the years\nof a boy, and the curiosity of a woman.  I brought him now, thinking\nthat a messenger might be wanted to raise the country against the\npirates; and I believe Oddo, in his present mood, will be as sure as we\nknow he can be swift.\"\n\n\"It is well we have a messenger.  Where is the bishop?\"\n\n\"Just going to his boat, at this moment, I doubt not,\" replied\nErlingsen, measuring with his eye the length of the shadows.  \"The\nbishop is to sup with us this evening.\"\n\n\"And how long to stay?\"\n\n\"Over to-morrow night, at the least.  If many of the neighbours should\nbring their business to him, it may be longer.  My little Frolich will\nbe vexed that he should come while she is absent.  Indeed I should not\nmuch wonder if she sets out homeward when she hears the news you will\ncarry, so that we shall see her at breakfast.\"\n\n\"It is more likely,\" observed Rolf, \"that we shall see the bishop up\nthe mountain at breakfast.  Ah! you stare; but you will find I am not\nout of my wits when you hear what has come to my knowledge since we\nparted, and especially within this hour.\"\n\nErlingsen was indeed presently convinced that it was the intention of\nthe pirates to carry off the Bishop of Tronyem, in order that his\nransom might make up to them for the poverty of the coasts.  He heard\nbesides such an ample detail of the plundering practices which Rolf had\nwitnessed from his retreat as convinced him that the strangers, though\nin great force, must be prevented by a vigorous effort from doing\nfurther mischief.  The first thing to be done was to place the bishop\nin safety on the mountain; and the next was so to raise the country as\nthat these pirates should be certainly taken when they should come\nwithin reach.\n\nOddo was called, and entrusted with the information which had to be\nconveyed to the magistrate at Saltdalen.  He carried his master's\ntobacco-pouch as a token--this pouch, of Lapland make, being well known\nto the magistrate as Erlingsen's.  Oddo was to tell him of the danger\nof the bishop, and to request him to send to the spot whatever force\ncould be mustered at Saltdalen; and moreover to issue the budstick,[5]\nto raise the country.  The pirates having once entered the upper reach\nof the fiord, might thus be prevented from ever going back again, and\nfrom annoying any more the neighbourhood which they had so long\ninfested.\n\n\n\n[5] When it is desired to send a summons or other message over a\ndistrict in Norway where the dwellings are scattered, the budstick is\nsent round by running messengers.  It is a stick made hollow, to hold\nthe magistrate's order, and a screw at one end to secure the paper in\nits place.  Each messenger runs a certain distance, and then delivers\nit to another, who must carry it forward.  If any one is absent, the\nbudstick must be laid upon the \"housefather's great chair, by the\nfireside;\" and if the house is locked, it must be fastened outside the\ndoor, so as to be seen as soon as the host returns.  Upon great\noccasions, it was formerly found that a whole region could be raised in\na very short time.  The method is still in use for appointments on\npublic business.\n\n\n\nErlingsen promised to be wary on his return homewards, so as not to\nfall in with the two whom Rolf had put to flight.  He said, however,\nthat if by chance he should cross their path, he did not doubt he could\nalso make them run, by acting the ghost or demon, though he had not had\nRolf's advantage of disappearing in the fiord before their eyes.  They\nwere already terrified enough to fly from anything that called itself a\nghost.\n\nThe three then went on their several ways--Oddo speeding over the\nridges like a sprite on a night errand, and Rolf striding up the grassy\nslopes like (what he was) a lover anxious to be beside his betrothed\nafter a perilous absence.\n\n\nThis was the day when the first cheese of the season was found to be\nperfect and complete.  Frolich, Stiorna, and Erica examined it\ncarefully, and pronounced it a well-pressed, excellent Gammel cheese,\nsuch as they should not be ashamed to set before the bishop, and\ntherefore one which ought to satisfy the demon.  It now only remained\nto carry it to its destination--to the ridge where the first cheese of\nthe season was always laid for the demon, and where, it appeared, he\nregularly came for his offering, as no vestige of the gift was ever to\nbe found the next morning--only the round place in the grass where it\nhad lain, and the marks of some feet which had trodden the herbage.\n\n\"Help me up with it upon my head, Stiorna,\" said Erica.\n\n\"I know why you will not let me carry the cheese,\" said Frolich,\nsmiling.  \"You are thinking of Oddo with the cake and ale.  Nobody but\nyou must deposit offerings henceforward.  You are afraid I should eat\nup that cheese, almost as heavy as myself.  You think there would not\nbe a paring left for the demon by the time I got to the ridge.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" replied Erica.  \"I think that he to whom this cheese is\ndestined had rather be served by one who does not laugh at him.  And it\nis a safer plan for you, Frolich.\"\n\nAnd off went Erica with her cheese.\n\nThe ridge on which she laid it would have tempted her at any other time\nto sit down.  It was green and soft with mosses, and offered as\ncomfortable a couch to one tired with the labours of the day as any to\nbe found at the farm.  But to-night it was to be haunted; so Erica\nmerely stayed to do her duty.  She selected the softest tuft of moss on\nwhich to lay the cheese, put her offering reverently down, and then\ndiligently gathered the brightest blossoms from the herbage around, and\nstrewed them over the cheese.  She then walked rapidly homewards,\nwithout once looking behind her.  If she had had the curiosity and\ncourage to watch for a little while, she would have seen her offering\ncarried off by an odd little figure, with nothing very terrible in its\nappearance--namely, a woman about four feet high, with a flat face, and\neyes wide apart, wearing a reindeer garment like a waggoner's frock, a\nred comforter about her neck, a red cloth cap on her head, a blue\nworsted sash, and leather boots up to the knee--in short, such a\nLapland girl as Erica would have given a rye-cake to as charity, but\nwould not have thought of asking to sit down even in her master's\nkitchen; for the Norwegian servants are very high and saucy towards the\nLaps who wander to their doors.  It is not surprising that the Lapps,\nwho pitch their tents on the mountain, should like having a fine Gammel\ncheese for the trouble of picking it up; and the company whose tents\nErica had passed on her way up to the seater, kept a good look-out upon\nall the dairy people round, and carried off every cheese meant for the\ndemon.  While Erica was gathering and strewing the blossoms, this girl\nwas hidden near; and trusting to Erica's not looking behind her, the\nrogue swept off the blossoms, and threw them at her before she had gone\nten yards, trundled the cheese down the other side of the ridge, made a\ncircuit, and was at the tents with her prize before supper-time.  What\nwould Erica have thought if she had beheld this fruit of so many\nmilkings and skimmings, so much boiling and pressing, devoured by\ngreedy Lapps in their dirty tent?\n\nOn her way homewards Erica remembered that this was Midsummer Eve--a\nseason when her mother was in her thoughts more than at any other time;\nfor Midsummer Eve is sacred in Norway to the wood-demon, whose victim\nshe believed her mother to have been.  Every woodman sticks his axe\ninto a tree that night, that the demon may, if he pleases, begin the\nwork of the year by felling trees or making a faggot.  Erica hastened\nto the seater, to discover whether Erlingsen had left his axe behind,\nand whether Jan had one with him.\n\nJan had an axe, and remembering his duty, though tired and sleepy, was\njust going to the nearest pine-grove with it when Erica reached home.\nShe seized Erlingsen's axe and went also, and stuck it in a tree, just\nwithin the verge of the grove, which was in that part a thicket, from\nthe growth of underwood.  This thicket was so near the back of the\ndairy that the two were home in five minutes.  Yet they found Frolich\nalmost as impatient as if they had been gone an hour.  She asked\nwhether their heathen worship was done at last, so that all might go to\nbed; or whether they were to be kept awake till midnight by more\nmummery?\n\nErica replied by showing that Jan was already gone to his loft over the\nshed, and begging leave to comb and curl Frolich's hair, and see her to\nrest at once.  Stiorna was asleep; and Erica herself meant to watch the\ncattle this night.  They lay crouched in the grass, all near each\nother, and within view, in the mild slanting sunshine; and here she\nintended to sit, on the bench outside the home-shed, and keep her eye\non them till morning.\n\n\"You are thinking of the Bishop of Tronyem's cattle,\" said Frolich.\n\n\"I am, dear.  This is Midsummer Eve, you know, when, as we think, all\nthe spirits love to be abroad.\"\n\n\"You will die before your time, Erica,\" said the weary girl.  \"These\nspirits give you no rest of body or mind.  What a day's work we have\ndone!  And now you are going to watch till twelve, one, two o'clock!  I\ncould not keep awake,\" she said, yawning, \"if there was one demon at\nthe head of the bed, and another at the foot, and the underground\npeople running like mice all over the floor.\"\n\n\"Then go and sleep, dear.  I will fetch your comb, if you will just\nkeep an eye on the cattle for the moment I am gone.\"\n\nAs Erica combed Frolich's long fair hair, and admired its shine in the\nsunlight, and twisted it up behind, and curled it on each side, the\nweary girl leaned her head against her, and dropped asleep.  When all\nwas done, she just opened her eyes to find her way to bed, and say--\n\n\"You may as well go to bed comfortably; for you will certainly drop\nasleep here, if you don't there.\"\n\n\"Not with my pretty Spiel in sight.  I would not lose my white heifer\nfor seven nights' sleep.  You will thank me when you find your cow, and\nall the rest, safe in the morning.  Good-night, dear.\"\n\nAnd Erica closed the door after her young mistress, and sat down on the\nbench outside, with her face towards the sun, her lure by her side, and\nher knitting in her hands.  She was glad that the herd lay so that by\nkeeping her eye on them she could watch that wonder of Midsummer night\nwithin the Arctic Circle, the dipping of the sun below the horizon, to\nappear again immediately.  She had never been far enough to the north\nto see the sun complete its circle without disappearing at all; but she\ndid not wish it.  She thought the softening of the light which she was\nabout to witness, and the speedy renewing of day, more wonderful and\nbeautiful.\n\nShe sat, soothed by her employment and by the tranquillity of the\nscene, and free from fear.  She had done her duty by the spirits of the\nmountain and the wood; and in case of the appearance of any object that\nshe did not like, she could slip into the house in an instant.  Her\nthoughts were therefore wholly Rolf's.  She could endure now to\ncontemplate a long life spent in doing honour to his memory by the\nindustrious discharge of duty.  She would watch over Peder, and receive\nhis last breath--an office which should have been Rolf's.  She would\nsee another houseman arrive, and take possession of that house, and\nbecome betrothed, and marry; and no one, not even her watchful mistress\nshould see a trace of repining in her countenance, or hear a tone of\nbitterness from her lips.  However weary her heart might be, she would\ndance at every wedding--of fellow-servant or of young mistress.  She\nwould cloud nobody's happiness, but would do all she could to make\nRolf's memory pleasant to those who had known him, and wished him well.\n\nHer eyes rested on the lovely scene before her.  From the elevation at\nwhich she was, it appeared as if the ocean swelled up into the very\nsky, so high was the horizon line; and between lay a vast region of\nrock and river, hill and dale, forest, fiord, and town, part in golden\nsunlight, part in deep shadow, but all, though bright as the skies\ncould make it, silent as became the hour.  As Erica found that she\ncould glance at the sun itself without losing sight of the cattle,\nwhich still lay within her indirect vision, she carefully watched the\ndescent of the orb, anxious to observe precisely when it should\ndisappear, and how soon its golden spark would kindle up again from the\nwaves.  When its lower rim was just touching the waters, its circle\nseemed to be of an enormous size, and its whole mass to be flaming.\nIts appearance was very unlike that of the comparatively small,\ncompact, brilliant luminary which rides the sky at noon.  Erica was\njust thinking so, when a rustle in the thicket, within the pine grove,\nmade her involuntarily turn her head in that direction.  Instantly\nremembering that it was a common device of the underground people for\none of them to make the watcher look away, in order that others might\ndrive off the cattle, she resumed her duty, and gazed steadfastly at\nthe herd.  They were safe--neither reduced to the size of mice, nor\nwandering off, though she had let her eye glance away from them.\n\nThe sky, however, did not look itself.  There were two suns in it.  Now\nErica really did quite forget the herd for some time, even her dear\nwhite heifer--while she stared bewildered at the spectacle before her\neyes.  There was one sun, the sun she had always known--half sunk in\nthe sea, while above it hung another, round and complete, somewhat less\nbright perhaps, but as distinct and plain before her eyes as any object\nin heaven or earth had ever been.  Her work dropped from her hands, as\nshe covered her eyes for a moment.  She started to her feet, and then\nlooked again.  It was still there, though the lower sun was almost\ngone.  As she stood gazing, she once more heard the rustle in the wood.\nThough it crossed her mind that the wood-demon was doubtless there\nmaking choice of his axe and his tree, she could not move, and had not\neven a wish to take refuge in the house, so wonderful was his\nspectacle--the clearest instance of enchantment she had ever seen.  Was\nit meant for good--a token that the coming year was to be a doubly\nbright one?  If not, how was she to understand it?\n\n\"Erica!\" cried a voice at this moment from the wood--a voice which\nthrilled her whole frame.  \"My Erica!\"\n\nShe not only looked towards the wood now, but sprang forwards; but her\neyes were so dazzled by having gazed at the sun that she could see\nnothing.  Then she remembered how many forms the cunning demon could\nassume, and she turned back thinking how cruel it was to delude her\nwith her lover's voice, when instead of his form she should doubtless\nsee some horrid monster.  She turned in haste, and laid her hand on the\nlatch of the door, glancing once more at the horizon.\n\nThere was now no sun at all.  The burnish was gone from every point of\nthe landscape, and a mild twilight reigned.\n\nOne good omen had vanished; but there was still enchantment around, for\nagain she heard the thrilling \"Erica!\"\n\nThere was no huge beast glaring through the pine stems, and trampling\ndown the thicket; but instead, there was the figure of a man advancing\nfrom the shadow into the pasture.  \"Why do you take that form?\" said\nthe trembling girl, sinking down on the bench.  \"I had rather have seen\nyou as a bear.  Did you not find the axe?  I laid it for you.\nPray--pray, come no nearer.\"\n\n\"I must, my love, to show you that it is your own Rolf.  Erica, do not\nlet your superstition come for ever between us.\"\n\nShe held out her arms--she could not rise, though she strove to do so.\nRolf sat beside her--she felt his kisses on her forehead--she felt his\nheart beat--she felt that not even a spirit could assume the very tones\nof that voice.\n\n\"Do forgive me,\" she murmured; \"but it is Mid-summer Eve, and I felt so\nsure----\"\n\n\"As sure of my being the demon as I am sure there is no cruel spirit\nhere, though it is Midsummer Eve.  Look, love! see how the day smiles\nupon us!\"\n\nAnd he pointed to where a golden star seemed to kindle on the edge of\nthe sea.  It was the sun again, rising after its few minutes of absence.\n\n\"I saw two just now,\" cried Erica--\"two suns.  Where are we, really?\nAnd how is all this?  And where do you come from?\"\n\nAnd she gazed, still wistfully, doubtfully, in her lover's face.\n\n\"I will show you,\" said he, smiling.  And while he still held her with\none arm, lest in some sudden fancy she should fly him as a ghost, he\nused the other hand to empty his pockets of the beautiful shells he had\nbrought, tossing them into her lap.\n\n\"Did you ever see such, Erica?  I have been where they lie in heaps.\nDid you ever see such beauties?\"\n\n\"I never did, Rolf; you have been at the bottom of the sea.\"\n\nAnd once more she shrank from what she took for the grasp of a drowned\nman.\n\n\"Not to the bottom, love,\" replied he, still clasping her hand.  \"Our\nfiord is deep, perhaps as deep as they say.  I dived as deep as a man\nmay to come up with the breath in his body, but I could never find the\nbottom.  Did I not tell you that I should go down as far as Vogel\nisland, and that I should there be safe?\"\n\n\"Yes!  You did--you did!\"\n\n\"Well!  I went to Vogel island, and here I am safe!\"\n\n\"It is you!  We are together again!\" she exclaimed, now in full belief.\n\"Thank God!  Thank God!\"  And she wept upon his shoulder.\n\nThey did not heed the time, as they talked and talked; and Rolf was\njust telling how he had more than once seen a double sun without\nfinding any remarkable consequences follow, when Stiorna came forth\nwith her milk pails just before four o'clock.  She started and dropped\none of her pails when she saw who was sitting on the bench, and Erica\nstarted no less at the thought of how completely she had forgotten the\ncattle and the underground people all this time.  The herd was all\nsafe, however--every cow as large as life, and looking exactly like\nitself, so that the good fortune of this Midsummer Eve had been perfect.\n\nThe appearance of Stiorna reminded the lovers that it was time to begin\nthe business of the morning.  They startled Stiorna with the news that\na large company was coming to breakfast.  Being in no very amiable\ntemper towards happy lovers, she refused after a moment's thought to\nbelieve what they said, and sat down sulking to her task of milking.\nSo Rolf proceeded to rouse Jan, and Erica stepped to Frolich's bedside,\nand waked her with a kiss.\n\n\"Erica!  No, can it be?\" said the active girl, up in a moment.  \"You\nlook too happy to be Erica.\"\n\n\"Erica never was so happy before, dear, that is the reason.  You were\nright, Frolich--bless your kind heart for it!  Rolf was not dead.  He\nis here.\"\n\nFrolich gallopaded round the room, like one crazy, before proceeding to\ndress.\n\n\"Whenever you like to stop,\" said Erica, laughing, \"I have some good\nnews for you too.\"\n\n\"I am to go and see the bishop!\" cried Frolich, clapping her hands, and\nwhirling round on one foot like an opera-dancer.\n\n\"Not so, Frolich.\"\n\n\"There now! you promise me good news, and then you won't let me go and\nsee the bishop when you know that is the only thing in the world I want\nor wish for!\"\n\n\"Would it not be a great compliment to you, and save you a great deal\nof trouble, if the bishop were to come here to see you?\"\n\n\"Ah! that would be a pretty sight!  The Bishop of Tronyem over the\nankles in the sodden, trodden pasture--sticking in the mud of\nSulitelma!  The Bishop of Tronyem sleeping upon hay in the loft, and\neating his dinner off a wooden platter!  That would be the most\nwonderful sight that Nordland ever saw.\"\n\n\"Prepare, then, to see the Bishop of Tronyem drink his morning coffee\nout of a wooden bowl.  Meantime, I must go and grind his coffee.\nSeriously, Frolich, you must make haste to dress and help.  The pirates\nwant to carry off the bishop for ransom.  Erlingsen is raising the\ncountry.  Hund is coming here as a prisoner, and the bishop, and my\nmistress, and Orga, to be safe; and if you do not help me I shall have\nnothing ready, for Stiorna does not like the news.\"\n\nNever had Frolich dressed more quickly.  She thought it very hard that\nthe bishop should see her when she had nothing but her dairy dress to\nwear, but she was ready all the sooner for this.  Erica consoled her\nwith her belief that the bishop was the last person who could be\nsupposed to make a point of a silk gown for a mountain maiden.\n\nA consultation about the arrangements was held before the door by the\nfour who were in a good humour, for Stiorna remained aloof.  This, like\nother mountain dwellings, was a mere sleeping and eating shed, only\ncalculated for a bare shelter at night, at meals, and from occasional\nrain.  There was no apartment at the seater in which the bishop could\nhold an audience, out of the way of the cooking and other household\ntransactions.  It could not be expected of him to sit on the bench\noutside, or on the grass, like the people of the establishment; for,\nunaccustomed as he was to spend his days in the open air, his eyes\nwould be blinded, and his face blistered by the sun.  The young people\ncast their eyes on the pine wood as the fittest summer parlour for him,\nif it could be provided with seats.\n\nErica sprang forward to prevent any one from entering the wood till she\nshould have seen what state the place was in on this particular\nmorning.  No trees had been felled, and no branches cut since the night\nbefore, and the axes remained where they had been hung.  The demon had\nnot wanted them, it seemed, and there was no fear of intruding upon him\nnow.  So the two young men set to work to raise a semicircular range of\nturf seats in the pleasantest part of the shady grove.  The central\nseat, which was raised above the rest, and had a foot-stool, was well\ncushioned with dry and soft moss, and the rough bark was cut from the\ntrunk of the tree against which it was built, so that the stem served\nas a comfortable back to the chair.  Rolf tried the seat when finished,\nand as he leaned back, feasting his eyes on the vast sunny landscape\nwhich was to be seen between the trees of the grove, he declared that\nit was infinitely better to sit here than in the bishop's stall in\nTronyem Cathedral.\n\nAll being done now for which a strong man was wanted, Rolf declared\nthat he and Jan must be gone to the farm.  Not a man could be spared\nfrom the shores of the fiord till the affairs of the pirates should be\nsettled.  Erica ought to have expected to hear this, but her cheek grew\nwhite as it was told.  She spoke no word of objection, however, seeing\nplainly what her lover's duty was.\n\nShe turned towards the dairy when he was gone, instead of indulging\nherself with watching him down the mountain.  She was busy skimming\nbowl after bowl of rich milk, when Frolich ran in to say that Stiorna\nhad dressed herself, and put up her bundle, and was setting forth\nhomewards to see, as she said, the truth of things there--which meant,\nof course, to learn Hund's condition and prospects.  It was now\nnecessary to tell her that she would presently see Hund brought up to\nthe seater a prisoner, and that the farm was no place for any but\nfighting men this day.  To save her feelings and temper, Erica asked\nher to watch the herd, leading them to a point whence she could soonest\nsee the expected company mounting the uplands.\n\n[It was Hund, with his feet tied under his horse, and the\nbridle held by a man on each side.]\n\nPresently there were voices heard from the hill above.  Some traveller\nwho had met the budstick had reported the proceedings below, and the\nnews had spread to a northern seater.  The men had gone down to the\nfiord, and here were the women with above a gallon of strawberries,\nfresh gathered, and a score of plovers' eggs.  Next appeared a pony,\ncoming westward over the pasture, laden with panniers containing a\ntender kid, a packet of spices, a jar of preserved cherries, and a few\nof the present season, early ripe, and a stone bottle of ant vinegar.\nFrolich's spirits rose higher and higher, as more people came from\nbelow, sent by Rolf on his way down.  A deputation of Lapps came from\nthe tents, bringing reindeer venison, and half of a fine Gammel cheese.\nBefore Erica had had time to pour out a glass of corn-brandy for each\nof this dwarfish party, in token of thanks, and because it is\nconsidered unlucky to send away Lapps without a treat, other mountain\ndwellers came with offerings of various wild fowl, so that the dresser\nwas loaded with game enough to feed half a hundred hungry men.\n\nErica and Frolich returned to their breakfast-table, to make the new\narrangements now necessary, and place the fruit, and spices.  Erica\nclosely examined the piece of Gammel cheese brought by the Lapps, and\nthen, with glowing cheeks, called Frolich to her.\n\n\"What now?\" said Frolich.  \"Have you found a way of telling fortunes\nwith the hard cheese, as some pretend to do with the soft curds?\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Erica.  \"What stamp is this?  The cheese has been\nscraped--almost pared, you see, but they have left one little corner.\nAnd whose stamp is there?\"\n\n\"Ours,\" said Frolich coolly.  \"This is the cheese you laid out on the\nridge last night.\"\n\n\"I believe it.  I see it,\" exclaimed Erica.\n\n\"Now, dear Erica, do not let us have the old story of your being\nfrightened about what the demon will say and do.  Nobody but you will\nbe surprised that the Lapps help themselves with good things that lie\nstrewing the ground.\"\n\nTo Frolich's delight and surprise she appeared too busy--or was rather,\nperhaps, too happy--to lament this mischance, as she would formerly\nhave done.  Just when a youth from the highest pasture on Sulitelma had\ncome running and panting, to present Frolich with a handful of fringed\npinks and blue gentian, plucked from the very edge of the glacier, so\nthat their colours were reflected in the ice, Stiorna appeared in haste\nto tell that a party on horseback and on foot were winding out of the\nravine, and coming straight up over the pasture.  All was now\ncertainty, and great was the bustle to put out of sight all unseemly\ntokens of preparation.  In the midst of the hurry Frolich found time to\ntwist some of her pretty flowers into her pretty hair, so that it might\neasily chance that the bishop would not miss her silk gown.\n\nThe bishop's reputation preceded him, as is usual in such cases.  As\nhis horse, followed by those which bore the ladies, reached the house\ndoor, all present cried--\n\n\"Welcome to the mountain!\"  \"Welcome to Sulitelma!\"\n\nThe bishop observed that, often as he had wished to look abroad from\nSulitelma, and to see with his own eyes what life at the seaters was\nlike, he should have grown old without the desire being gratified but\nfor the design of the enemy upon him.  It was all he could do to go the\nrounds of his diocese, from station to station below, without thinking\nof journeys of pleasure.  Yet here he was on Sulitelma!\n\nWhen he and M. Kollsen and the ladies had dismounted, and were entering\nthe house to breakfast, the gazers found leisure to observe the\nhindmost of the train of riders.  It was Hund, with his feet tied under\nhis horse, and the bridle held by a man on each side.  He had seen and\nheard too much of the preparations against the enemy to be allowed to\nremain below, or at large anywhere, till the attack should be over.  He\ncould not dismount till some one untied his legs; and no one would do\nthat till a safe place could be found in which to confine him.  It was\nan awkward situation enough, sitting there bound before everybody's\neyes; and not the less for Stiorna's leaning her head against the\nhorse, and crying at seeing him so treated; and yet Hund had often been\nseen, on small occasions, to look far more black and miserable.  His\nface now was almost cheerful.  Stiorna praised this as a sign of\nbravery; but the truth was, the party had been met by Rolf and Jan\ngoing down the mountain.  It was no longer possible to take Rolf for a\nghost; and though Hund was as far as possible from understanding the\nmatter, he was unspeakably relieved to find that he had not the death\nof his rival to answer for.  It made his countenance almost gay to\nthink of this, even while stared at by men, women, and children as a\nprisoner.\n\n\"What is it?\" whimpered Stiorna--\"what are you a prisoner for, Hund?\"\n\n\"Ask them that know,\" said Hund.  \"I thought at first that it was on\nRolf's account; and now that they see with their own eyes that Rolf is\nsafe they best know what they have to bring against me.\"\n\n\"It is no secret,\" said Madame Erlingsen.  \"Hund was seen with the\npirates, acting with and assisting them, when they committed various\nacts of thievery on the shores of the fiord.  If the pirates are taken,\nHund will be tried with them for robberies at There's, Kyril's, Tank's,\nand other places along the shore, about which information has been\ngiven by a witness.\"\n\n\"There's, Kyril's, and Tank's!\" repeated Hund to himself; \"then there\nmust be magic in the case.  I could have sworn that not an eye on earth\nwitnessed the doings there.  If Rolf turns out to be the witness, I\nshall be certain that he has the powers of the region to help him.\"\n\nSo little is robbery to be dreaded at the seaters, that there really\nwas no place where Hund could be fastened in--no lock upon any\ndoor--not a window from which he might not escape.  The zealous\nneighbours, therefore, whose interest it was to detain him, offered to\ntake it in turn to be beside him, his right arm tied to the left of\nanother man.  And thus it was settled.\n\n\nWhen the bishop came forth in the afternoon to take his seat in the\nshade of the wood, those who were there assembled were singing _For\nNorg√©_.  Instead of permitting them to stop, on account of his arrival,\nhe joined in the song; solely because his heart was in it.  As he\nlooked around him, and saw deep shades and sunny uplands, blue glaciers\nabove, green pastures and glittering waters below, and all around,\nherds on every hillside, he felt his love of old Norway, and his\nthankfulness for being one of her sons, as warm as that of any one of\nthe singers in the wood.  Out of the fulness of his heart, the good\nbishop addressed his companions on the goodness of God in creating such\na land, and placing them in it, with their happiness so far in their\nown hands as that little worthy of being called evil could befall them,\nexcept through faults of their own.  M. Kollsen, who had before uttered\nhis complaints of the superstition of his flock, hoped that his bishop\nwas now about to attack the mischief vigorously.\n\nThe bishop only took his seat--the mossy seat prepared for him--and\ndeclared himself to be now at the service of any who wished to consult\nor converse with him.  Instead of thrusting his own opinions and\nreproofs upon them, as it was M. Kollsen's wont to do, he waited for\nthe people to open their minds to him in their own way; and by this\nmeans, whatever he found occasion to say had double influence from\ncoming naturally.  The words dropped by him that day were not forgotten\nthrough long years after; and he was quoted half a century after he had\nbeen in his grave, as old Ulla had quoted the good Bishop of Tronyem of\nher day.\n\nIn a few hours, many of the people were gone for the present, some\nbeing wanted at home, and others for the expected affair on the fiord.\nThe bishop and M. Kollsen had thought themselves alone in their shady\nretreat, when they saw Erica lingering near among the trees.  With a\nkind smile, the bishop beckoned to her, and bade her sit down, and tell\nhim whether he had not been right in promising a while ago that God\nwould soothe her sorrows with time, as is the plan of His kind\nprovidence.  He remembered well the story of the death of her mother.\nErica replied that not only had her grief been soothed, but that she\nwas now so blessed that her heart was burdened with its gratitude.\n\n\"I wish,\" said Erica, with a sigh--\"I do wish I knew what to think\nabout Nipen.\"\n\n\"Ay! here it comes,\" observed M. Kollsen, folding his arms as if for an\nargument.\n\nEncouraged by the bishop, Erica told the whole story of the last few\nmonths, from the night of Oddo's prank to that which found her at the\nfeet of her friend; for she cast herself down at the bishop's feet,\nsitting as she had done in her childhood, looking up in his face.\n\n\"You want to know what I think of all this?\" said the bishop, when she\nhad done.  \"I think that you could hardly help believing as you have\nbelieved, amidst these strange circumstances, and with your mind full\nof the common accounts of Nipen.  Yet I do not believe there is any\nsuch spirit as Nipen, or any demon in the forest, or on the mountain.\n\n\"This is one of the many tales belonging to the old religion of this\ncountry.  And how did this old religion arise?  Why, the people saw\ngrand spectacles every day, and heard wonders whichever way they\nturned; and they supposed that the whole universe was alive.  The sun\nas it travelled they thought was alive, and kind and good to men.  The\ntempest they thought was alive, and angry with men.  The fire and frost\nthey thought were alive, pleased to make sport with them.\"\n\n\"As people who ought to know better,\" observed M. Kollsen, \"now think\nthe wind is alive, and call it Nipen; or the mist of the lake and\nriver, which they call the sprite Uldra.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said the bishop, \"that we now have better knowledge, and\nsee that the earth, and all that is in it, is made and moved by one\nGood Spirit, who, instead of sporting with men, or being angry with\nthem, rules all things for their good.  But I am not surprised that\nsome of the old stories remain, and are believed in still, and by good\nand dutiful Christians too.  The mother sings the old songs over the\ncradle, and the child hears tell of sprites and demons before it hears\nof the good God, who 'sends forth the snow and rain, the hail and\nvapour, and the stormy winds fulfilling His word.'  And when the child\nis grown to be a man or woman, the northern lights shooting over the\nsky, and the sighing of the winds in the pine forest, bring back those\nold songs and old thoughts about demons and sprites, and the stoutest\nman trembles.  I do not wonder, nor do I blame any man or woman for\nthis, though I wish they were as happy as the weakest infant or the\nmost worn-out old man, who has learned from the gentle Jesus to fear\nnothing at any time, because His Father was with Him.\"\n\nErica hid her face, ashamed under the good man's smile.\n\n\"In our towns,\" continued he, \"much of this blessed change is already\nwrought.  No one in my city of Tronyem now fears the angry and cunning\nfire-giant Loke; but every citizen closes his eyes in peace when he\nhears the midnight cry of the watch, 'Except the Lord keepeth the city,\nthe watchman waketh but in vain.'[6]  In the wilds of the country every\nman's faith will hereafter be his watchman, crying out upon all that\nhappens, 'It is the Lord's hand: let Him do what seemeth to Him good!'\nThis might have been said, Erica, as it appears to me, at every turn of\nyour story, where you and your friends were not in fault.\"\n\n\n\n[6] The watchman's call in the towns of Norway.\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Erica, dropping her hands from before her glowing face,\n\"if I dared but think there were no bad spirits; if I dared only hope\nthat everything that happens is done by God's own hand, I could bear\neverything!  I would never be afraid again!\"\n\n\"It is what I believe,\" said the bishop.  Laying his hand on her head,\nhe continued--\n\n\"We know that the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  I see that\nyou are weary of your fears; that you have long been heavy laden with\nanxiety.  It is you, then, that He invites to trust Him, when He says\nby the lips of Jesus, 'Come ye that are weary and heavy-laden and I\nwill give you rest.'\"\n\n\"Rest; rest is what I have wanted,\" said Erica, while her tears flowed\ngently; \"but Peder and Ulla did not believe as you do, and could not\nexplain things; and----\"\n\n\"You should have asked me,\" said M. Kollsen; \"I could have explained\neverything.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, sir; but--but, M. Kollsen, you always seemed angry, and\nyou said you despised us for believing anything that you did not; and\nit is the most difficult thing in the world to ask questions which one\nknows will be despised.\"\n\nM. Kollsen glanced in the bishop's face, to see how he took this, and\nhow he meant to support the pastor's authority.  The bishop looked sad,\nand said nothing.\n\n\"And then,\" continued Erica, \"there were others who laughed--even Rolf\nhimself laughed; and what one fears becomes only the more terrible when\nit is laughed at.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the bishop.  \"When Jesus sat on the well in Samaria,\nand taught how the true worship was come, He neither frowned on the\nwoman who inquired, nor despised her, nor made light of her\nsuperstition about a sacred mountain.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, which was broken at last by Erica asking the\nbishop whether he could not console poor Hund, who wanted comfort more\nthan she had ever done.  The bishop replied, that the demons who most\ntormented poor Hund were not abroad on the earth or in the air, but\nwithin his breast--his remorse, his envy, his covetousness, his fear.\nHe meant not to lose sight of poor Hund, either in the prison, to which\nhe was to travel to-morrow, or after he should come out of it.\n\nHere Frolich appeared, running to ask whether those who were in the\ngrove would not like to look forth from the ridge, and see what good\nthe budstick had done, and how many parties were on their way, from all\nquarters, to the farm.\n\nM. Kollsen was glad to rise and escape from what he thought a\nschooling; and the bishop himself was as interested in what was going\non as if the farm had been his home.  He was actually the first at the\nridge.\n\nThis part of the mountain was a singularly favourable situation for\nseeing what was doing on the spot on which every one's attention was\nfixed this day.  While the people on the fiord could not see what was\ngoing forward at Saltdalen, nor those at Saltdalen what were the\nmovements at the farm, the watchers on the ridge could observe the\nproceedings at all the three points.  The opportunity was much improved\nby the bishop having a glass--a glass of a quality so rare at that time\nthat there would probably have been some talk of magic and charms if it\nhad been seen in any hands but the bishop's.\n\nBy means of this glass the bishop, M. Kollsen, or Madame Erlingsen\nannounced from time to time what was doing as the evening advanced--how\nparties of two or three were leaving Saltdalen, creeping towards the\nfarm under cover of rising grounds, rocks, and pine woods; how small\ncompanies, well armed, were hidden in every place of concealment near\nErlingsen's, and how there seemed to be a great number of women about\nthe place.  This was puzzling.  Who these women could be, and why they\nshould choose to resort to the farm when its female inhabitants had\nleft it for safety, it was difficult at first to imagine.  But the\ntruth soon occurred to Frolich.  No doubt some one had remembered how\nstrange and suspicious it would appear to the pirates, who supposed the\nbishop to be at the farm, that there should be no women in the company\nassembled to meet him.  No doubt these people in blue, white, and green\npetticoats, who were striding about the yards, and looking forth from\nthe galleries, were men dressed in their wives' clothes, or in such as\nErlingsen furnished from the family chests.  This disguise was as good\nas an ambush while it also served to give the place the festive\nappearance looked for by the enemy.  It was found afterwards that Oddo\nhad acted as lady's-maid, fitting the gowns to the shortest men, and\ndressing up their heads so as best to hide the shaggy hair.  Great\nnumbers were certainly assembled before night; yet still a little group\nmight be seen now and then winding down from some recess of the\nwide-spreading mountain, making circuits by the ravines and\nwater-courses, so as to avoid crossing the upland slopes, which the\npirates might be surveying by means of such a glass as the bishop's.\n\nThe bishop was of opinion that scarcely a blow would be struck, so\ngreat was the country force compared with that of the pirates.  He\nbelieved that the enemy would be overpowered and disarmed almost\nwithout a struggle.  Erica, who could not but tremble with fear as well\nas expectation, blessed his words in her heart, and so, in truth, did\nevery woman present.\n\nNo one thought of going to rest, though Madame Erlingsen urged it upon\nthose over whom she had influence.  Finding that Erica had sat up to\nwatch the cattle the night before, she compelled her to go and lie\ndown, but no compulsion could make her sleep; and Orga and Frolich did\nthe best they could for her, by running to her with news of any fresh\nappearance below.  Just after midnight they brought her word that the\nbishop had ordered every one but M. Kollsen away from the ridge.  The\nschooner had peeped out from behind the promontory, and was stealing up\nwith a soft west wind.\n\nThe girls went on to describe how the schooner was working up, and why\nthe bishop thought that the people at the farm were aware of every inch\nof her progress.\n\nErica sprang from the bed, and joined the group who were sitting on the\ngrass awaiting the sunrise, and eagerly listening for every word from\ntheir watchman, the bishop.  He told when he saw two boats, full of\nmen, put off from the schooner, and creep towards Erlingsen's cove\nunder the shadow of the rocks.  He told how the country people\nimmediately gathered behind the barn and the house, and every\noutbuilding; and, at length, when the boats touched the shore, he said--\n\n\"Now come and look yourselves.  They are too busy now to be observing\nus.\"\n\nThen how eyes were strained, and what silence there was, broken only by\nan occasional exclamation, as it became certain that the decisive\nmoment was come!  The glass passed rapidly from hand to hand, but it\nrevealed little.  There was smoke, covering a struggling crowd; and\nsuch gazers as had a husband, a father, or a lover there, could look no\nlonger.  The bishop himself did not attempt to comfort them, at a\nmoment when he knew it would be in vain.\n\nIn the midst of all this, some one observed two boats appearing from\nbehind the promontory, and making directly and rapidly for the\nschooner; and presently there was a little smoke there too, only a puff\nor two, and then all was quiet till she began to hang out her sails,\nwhich had been taken in, and to glide over the waters in the direction\nof a small sandy beach, on which she ran straight up, till she was\nevidently fast grounded.\n\n\"Excellent!\" exclaimed M. Kollsen.  \"How admirably they are conducting\nthe whole affair!  The retreat of these fellows is completely cut\noff--their vessel taken, and driven ashore, while they are busy\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"That is Oddo's doings,\" observed Orga quietly.\n\n\"Oddo's doings!  How do you know?  Are you serious?  Can you see?  Or\ndid you hear?\"\n\n\"I was by when Oddo told his plan to my father, and begged to be\nallowed to take the schooner.  My father laughed so that I thought Oddo\nwould be for going over to the enemy.\"\n\n\"No fear of that,\" said Erica.  \"Oddo has a brave, faithful heart.\"\n\n\"And,\" said his mistress, \"a conscience and temper which will keep him\nmeek and patient till he has atoned for mischief that he thinks he has\ndone.\"\n\n\"I must see more of this boy,\" observed the bishop.  \"Did your father\ngrant his request?\" he inquired of Orga.\n\n\"At last he did.  Oddo said that a young boy could do little good in\nthe fight at the farm; but that he might lead a party to attack the\nschooner, in the absence of almost all her crew.  He said it was no\nmore than a boy might do, with half-a-dozen lads to help him; for he\nhad reason to feel sure that only just hands enough to manage her would\nbe left on board, and those the weakest of the pirate party.  My father\nsaid there were men to spare, and he put twelve, well armed, under\nOddo's orders.\"\n\n\"Who would submit to be under Oddo's command?\" asked Frolich, laughing\nat the idea.\n\n\"Twice twelve, if he had wanted so many,\" replied Orga.  \"Between the\ngoodness of the joke and their zeal, there were volunteers in\nplenty--my father told me, as he was putting me on my horse.\"\n\nIn a very few minutes all signs of fighting were over at the farm.  But\nthere was a fire.  The barn was seen to smoke and then to flame.  It\nwas plain that the neighbours were at liberty to attend to the fire,\nand had no fighting on their hands.  They were seen to form a line from\nthe burning barn to the brink of the water, and to hand buckets till\nthe fire was out.  The barn had been nearly empty, and the fire did not\nspread farther; so that Madame Erlingsen herself did not spend one\ngrudging thought on this small sacrifice, in return for their\ndeliverance from the enemy, who, she had feared, would ransack her\ndwelling, and fire it over her children's heads.  She was satisfied and\nthankful, if indeed the pirates were taken.\n\nAt the bishop's question about who would go down the mountain for news,\neach of Hund's guards begged to be the man.  The swiftest of foot was\nchosen, and off he went--not without a barley-cake and brandy-flask--at\na pace which promised speedy tidings.\n\nAs Madame Erlingsen hoped in her heart, he met a messenger despatched\nby her husband; so that all who had lain down to sleep--all but\nherself, that is--were greeted by good news as they appeared at the\nbreakfast-table.  The pirates were all taken, and on their way, bound,\nto Saltdalen, there to be examined by the magistrate, and, no doubt,\nthence transferred to the jail at Tronyem.  Hund was to follow\nimmediately, either to take his trial with them, or to appear as\nevidence against them.\n\nOne of the pirates was wounded, and two of the country people, but not\na life was lost; and Erlingsen, Rolf, Peder, and Oddo were all safe and\nunhurt.\n\nOddo was superintending the unlading of the schooner, and was appointed\nby the magistrate, at his master's desire, head guard of the property,\nas it lay on the beach, till the necessary evidence of its having been\nstolen by the pirates was taken, and the owners could be permitted to\nidentify and resume their property.  Oddo was certainly the greatest\nman concerned in the affair, after Erlingsen.  When it was finished,\nand he returned to his home, he found he cared more for the pressure of\nhis grandfather's hand upon his head, as the old man blessed his boy,\nthan for all the praises of the whole country round.\n\nAn idea occurred to everybody but one, within the next few hours, which\noccasioned some consultation.  Everybody but Erica felt and said that\nit would be a great honour and privilege, but one not undeserved by the\ndistrict, for the Bishop of Tronyem to marry Rolf and Erica before he\nleft Nordland.  The bishop wished to make some acknowledgment for the\nzealous protection and hospitality which had been afforded him; and he\nsoon found that no act would be so generally acceptable as his blessing\nthe union of these young people.  He spoke to Madame Erlingsen about\nit, and her only doubt was whether it was not too soon after the burial\nof old Ulla.  If Peder, however, should not object on this ground, no\none else had a right to do so.\n\nSo far from objecting, Peder shed tears of pleasure at the thought.  He\nwas sure Ulla would be delighted, if she knew--would feel it an honour\nto herself that her place should be filled by one whose marriage-crown\nshould be blessed by the bishop himself.  Erica was startled, and had\nseveral good reasons to give why there should be no hurry; but she was\nbrought round to see that Rolf could go to Tronyem to give his evidence\nagainst the pirates, even better after his marriage than before,\nbecause he would leave Peder in a condition of greater comfort; and she\neven smiled to herself as she thought how rapidly she might improve the\nappearance of the house during his absence, so that he should delight\nin it on his return.  When the bishop assured her that she should not\nbe hurried into her marriage within two days, but that he would appoint\na day and hour when he should be at the distant church, to confirm the\nyoung people resident lower down the fiord, she gratefully consented,\nwondering at the interest so high and revered a man seemed to feel in\nher lot.  When it was once settled that the wedding was to be next\nweek, she gave hearty aid to the preparations, as freely and openly as\nif she was not herself to be the bride.\n\nThe bishop embarked immediately on descending the mountain.  His\nconsiderate eye saw at a glance that there was necessarily much\nconfusion at the farm, and that his further presence would be an\ninconvenience.  So he bade his host and the neighbours farewell for a\nshort time, desiring them not to fail to meet him again at the church\non his summons.\n\nThe kindness of the neighbours did not cease when danger from the enemy\nwas over.  Some offered boats for the wedding procession, several sent\ngilt paper to adorn the bridal crown which Orga and Frolich were\nmaking, and some yielded a more important assistance still.  They put\ntrusty persons into the seater, and over the herd, for two days, so\nthat all Erlingsen's household might be at the wedding.  Stiorna\npreferred making butter, and gazing southwards, to attending the\nwedding of Hund's rival; but every one else was glad to go.  Nobody\nwould have thought of urging Peder's presence, but he chose to do his\npart--(a part which no one could discharge so well)--singing bridal\nsongs in the leading boat.\n\nThe summons arrived quite as soon as it could have been looked for, and\nthe next day there was as pretty a boat-procession on the still waters\nof the fiord as had ever before glided over its surface.  Within the\nmemory of man, no bride had been prettier--no crown more glittering--no\nbridegroom more happy--no chanting was ever more soothing than old\nPeder's--no clarionet better played than Oddo's--no bridesmaids more\ngay and kindly than Orga and Frolich.  The neighbours were hearty in\ntheir cheers as the boats put off and the cheers were repeated from\nevery settlement in the coves and on the heights of the fiord, and were\nagain taken up by the echoes till the summer air seemed to be full of\ngladness.\n\nTo conclude, the bishop was punctual, and kindly in his welcome of\nErica to the altar.  He was also graciously pleased with Rolf's\nexplanation that he had not ventured to bring a gift for so great a\ndignitary, but that he hoped the bishop would approve of his giving his\nhumble offering to the church instead.  The six sides of the new pulpit\nwere nearly finished now, and Rolf desired to take upon himself the\ncarving of the basement as his marriage-fee.  As the bishop smiled\napprobation, M. Kollsen bowed acquiescence, and Rolf found himself in\nprospect of indoor work for some time to come.\n\nErica carried home in her heart, and kept there for ever, certain words\nof the Bishop's address which he uttered with his eye kindly fixed upon\nhers.  \"Go, and abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  So shall you\nnot be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by\nday, nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the\ndestruction that wasteth at noon-day.  When you shall have made the\nLord your habitation, you shall not fear that evil may befall you, or\nthat any plague shall come nigh your dwelling.  Go, and peace be on\nyour house!\"\n",
