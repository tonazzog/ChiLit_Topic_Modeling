It is not an island in the sea.  It is a\npart of Lincolnshire--a piece of land hilly in the middle, and\nsurrounded by rivers.  The Trent runs on the east side of it; and some\nsmaller rivers formerly flowed round the rest of it, joining the Humber\nto the north.  These rivers carried down a great deal of mud with them\nto the Humber, and the tides of the Humber washed up a great deal of\nsea-sand into the mouths of the rivers; so that the waters could not for\nsome time flow freely, and were at last prevented from flowing away at\nall: they sank into the ground, and made a swamp of it--a swamp of many\nmiles round the hilly part of the Isle of Axholme.\n\nThis swamp was long a very dismal place.  Fish, and water-birds, and\nrats inhabited it: and here and there stood the hut of a fowler; or a\npeat-stack raised by the people who lived on the hills round, and who\nobtained their fuel from the peat-lands in the swamp.  There were also,\nsprinkled over the district, a few very small houses--cells belonging to\nthe Abbey of Saint Mary, at York.  To these cells some of the monks from\nSaint Mary's had been fond of retiring, in old times, for meditation and\nprayer, and doing good in the district round; but when the soil became\nso swampy as to give them the ague as often as they paid a visit to\nthese cells, the monks left off their practice of retiring hither; and\ntheir little dwellings stood empty, to be gradually overgrown with green\nmoss and lank weeds, which no hand cleared away.\n\nAt last a Dutchman, having seen what wonders were done in his own\ncountry by good draining, thought he could render this district fit to\nbe inhabited and cultivated; and he made a bargain with the king about\nit.  After spending much money, and taking great pains, he succeeded.\nHe drew the waters off into new channels, and kept them there by\nsluices, and by carefully watching the embankments he had raised.  The\nland which was left dry was manured and cultivated, till, instead of a\nreedy and mossy swamp, there were fields of clover and of corn, and\nmeadows of the finest grass, with cattle and sheep grazing in large\nnumbers.  The dwellings that were still standing were made into\nfarm-houses, and new farmhouses were built.  A church here, and a chapel\nthere was cleaned, and warmed, and painted, and opened for worship; and\ngood roads crossed the district into all the counties near.\n\nInstead of being pleased with this change, the people of the country\nwere angry and discontented.  Those who lived near had been long\naccustomed to fishing and fowling in the swamp, without paying any rent,\nor having to ask anybody's leave.  They had no mind now to settle to the\nregular toilsome business of farming,--and to be under a landlord, to\nwhom they must pay rent.  Probably, too, they knew nothing about\nfarming, and would have failed in it if they had tried.  Thus far they\nwere not to be blamed.  But nothing can exceed the malignity with which\nthey treated the tenants who did settle in the isle, and the spiteful\nspirit which they showed towards them, on every occasion.\n\nThese tenants were chiefly foreigners.  There was a civil war in England\nat that time: and the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire people were so much\nengaged in fighting for King Charles or for the Parliament, that fewer\npersons were at liberty to undertake new farms than there would have\nbeen in a time of peace.  When the Dutchman and his companions found\nthat the English were not disposed to occupy the Levels (as the drained\nlands were called), they encouraged some of their own countrymen to come\nover.  With them arrived some few Frenchmen, who had been driven from\nFrance into Holland, on account of their being Protestants.  From first\nto last, there were about two hundred families, Dutch and French,\nsettled in the Levels.  Some were collected into a village, and had a\nchapel opened, where a pastor of their own performed service for them.\nOthers were scattered over the district, living just where their\noccupations required them to settle.\n\nAll these foreigners were subject to bad treatment from their\nneighbours; but the stragglers were the worst off; because it was\neasiest to tease and injure those who lived alone.  The disappointed\nfishers and fowlers gave other reasons for their own conduct, besides\nthat of being nearly deprived of their fishing and fowling.  These\nreasons were all bad, as reasons for hating always are.  One excuse was\nthat the new settlers were foreigners--as if those who were far from\ntheir own land did not need particular hospitality and kindness.\nAnother plea was that they were connected with the king, by being\nsettled on the lands which he had bargained to have drained: so that all\nwho sided with the parliament ought to injure the new tenants, in order\nto annoy the king.  If the settlers had tried to serve the king by\ninjuring his enemies, this last reason might have passed in a time of\nwar.  But it was not so.  It is probable that the foreigners did not\nunderstand the quarrel.  At any rate, they took no part in it.  All they\ndesired was to be left in peace, to cultivate the lands they paid rent\nfor.  But instead of peace, they had little but persecution.\n\nOne of these settlers, Mr Linacre, was not himself a farmer.  He\nsupplied the farmers of the district with a manure of a particular kind,\nwhich suited some of the richest soils they cultivated.  He found, in\nthe red soil of the isle, a large mass of that white earth, called\ngypsum, which, when wetted and burnt, makes plaster of Paris; and which,\nwhen ground, makes a fine manure for some soils, as the careful Dutchmen\nwell knew.  Mr Linacre set up a windmill on a little eminence which\nrose out of the Level, just high enough to catch the wind; and there he\nground the gypsum which he dug from the neighbouring patch or quarry.\nHe had to build some out-houses, but not a dwelling-house; for, near his\nmill, with just space enough for a good garden between, was one of the\nlargest of the old cells of the monks of Saint Mary's, so well built of\nstone, and so comfortably arranged, that Mr Linacre had little to do\nbut to have it cleaned and furnished, and the windows and doors made\nnew, to fit it for the residence of his wife and children, and a\nservant.\n\nThis building was round, and had three rooms below, and three over them.\nA staircase of stone was in the very middle, winding round, like a\ncorkscrew,--leading to the upper rooms, and out upon the roof, from\nwhich there was a beautiful view,--quite as far as the Humber to the\nnorth-east, and to the circle of hills on every other side.  Each of the\nrooms below had a door to the open air, and another to the staircase;--\nvery unlike modern houses, and not so fit as they to keep out wind and\ncold.  But for this, the dwelling would have been very warm, for the\nwalls were of thick stone; and the fire-places were so large, that it\nseemed as if the monks had been fond of good fires.  Two of these lower\nrooms opened into the garden; and the third, the kitchen, into the\nyard;--so that the maid, Ailwin, had not far to go to milk the cow and\nfeed the poultry.\n\nMrs Linacre was as neat in the management of her house as people from\nHolland usually are; and she did not like that the sitting-room, where\nher husband had his meals, and spent his evenings, should be littered by\nthe children, or used at all by them during her absence at her daily\noccupation, in the summer.  So she let them use the third room for their\nemployments and their play.  Her occupation, every summer's day, was\nserving out the waters from a mineral spring, a good deal frequented by\nsick people, three miles from her house, on the way to Gainsborough.\nShe set off, after an early breakfast, in the cool of the morning, and\ngenerally arrived at the hill-side where the spring was, and had\nunlocked her little shed, and taken out her glasses, and rinsed them,\nbefore any travellers passed.  It was rarely indeed that a sick person\nhad to wait a minute for her appearance.  There she sat, in her shed\nwhen it rained, and under a tree when it was fine, sewing or knitting\nvery diligently when no customers appeared, and now and then casting a\nglance over the Levels to the spot where her husband's mill rose in the\nmidst of the green fields, and where she almost fancied sometimes that\nshe could see the children sitting on the mill-steps, or working in the\ngarden.  When customers appeared, she was always ready in a moment to\nserve them; and her smile cheered those who were sick, and pleased those\nwho came merely from curiosity.  She slipped the halfpence she received\ninto a pocket beneath her apron; and sometimes the pocket was such a\nheavy one to carry three miles home, that she just stepped aside to the\nvillage shop at Haxey, or into a farm-house where the people would be\ngoing to market next day, to get her copper exchanged for silver.  Since\nthe times had become so troubled as they were now, however, she had\navoided showing her money anywhere on the road.  Her husband's advice\nwas that she should give up attending the spring altogether; but she\ngained so much money by it, and it was so likely that somebody would\nstep into her place there as soon as she gave it up, so that she would\nnot be able to regain her office when quieter times should come, that\nshe entreated him to allow her to go on while she had no fears.  She\ntook the heavy gold ear-rings out of her ears, wore a plainer cap, and\nleft her large silver watch at home; so that she looked like a poor\nwoman whom no needy soldier or bold thief would think of robbing.  She\nguessed by the sun what was the right time for locking up her glasses\nand going home; and she commonly met her husband, coming to fetch her,\nbefore she had got half-way.\n\nThe three children were sure to be perched on the top of the quarry\nbank, or on the mill-steps, or out on the roof of the house, at the top\nof the winding staircase.  Little George himself, though only two years\nold, knew the very moment when he should shout and clap his hands, to\nmake his mother wave her handkerchief from the turn of the road.  Oliver\nand Mildred did not exactly feel that the days were too long while their\nmother was away, for they had plenty to do; but they felt that the best\npart of the day was the hour between her return and their going to bed:\nand, unlike people generally, they liked winter better than summer,\nbecause at that season their mother never left them, except to go to the\nshop, or the market at Haxey.\n\nThough Oliver was only eleven, and Mildred nine, they were not too young\nto have a great deal to do.  Oliver was really useful as a gardener; and\nmany a good dish of vegetables of his growing came to table in the\ncourse of the year.  Mildred had to take care of the child almost all\nday; she often prepared the cabbage, and cut the bacon for Ailwin to\nbroil.  She could also do what Ailwin could not,--she could sew a\nlittle; and now and then there was an apron or a handkerchief ready to\nbe shown when Mrs Linacre came home in the evening.  If she met with\nany difficulty in her job, the maid could not help her, but her father\nsometimes could; and it was curious to see Mildred mounting the mill\nwhen she was at any loss, and her father wiping the white plaster off\nhis hands, and taking the needle or the scissors in his great fingers,\nrather than that his little girl should not be able to surprise her\nmother with a finished piece of work.  Then, both Oliver and Mildred had\nto learn their catechism, to say to Pastor Dendel on Sunday; and always\na copy or an exercise on hand, to be ready to show him when he should\ncall; and some book to finish that he had lent them to read, and that\nothers of his flock would be ready for when they had done.\n\nBesides all this, there was an occupation which both boy and girl\nthought more of than of all others together.  Among the loads of gypsum\nthat came to the mill, there were often pieces of the best kind,--lumps\nof real, fine alabaster.  Alabaster is so soft as to be easily worked.\nEven a finger-nail will make a mark upon it.  Everybody knows how\nbeautiful vases and little statues, well wrought in alabaster, look on a\nmantelpiece, or a drawing-room table.  Oliver had seen such in France,\nwhere they are very common: and his father had carried one or two\nornaments of this kind into Holland, when he had to leave France.  It\nwas a great delight for Oliver to find, on settling in Axholme, that he\ncould have as much alabaster as he pleased, if he could only work it.\nWith a little help from Pastor Dendel and his father, he soon learned to\ndo so; and of all his employments, he liked this the best.  Pastor\nDendel brought him a few bowls and cups of pretty shapes and different\nsizes, made of common wood by a turner, who was one of his flock; and\nOliver first copied these in clay, and then in alabaster.  By degrees he\nlearned to vary his patterns, and at last to make his clay models from\nfancies of his own,--some turning out failures, and others prettier than\nany of his wooden cups.  These last he proceeded to carve out of\nalabaster.\n\nMildred could not help watching him while he was about his favourite\nwork, though it was difficult to keep little George from tossing the\nalabaster about, and stamping on the best pieces, or sucking them.  He\nwould sometimes give his sister a few minutes' peace and quiet by\nrolling the wooden bowls the whole length of the room, and running after\nthem: and there was also an hour, in the middle of the day, when he went\nto sleep in his large Dutch cradle.  At those times Mildred would\nconsult with her brother about his work; or sew or watch him by turns;\nor read one of the pastor's little books, stopping occasionally to\nwonder whether Oliver could attend at once to his carving, and to what\nshe was reading.  When she saw that he was spoiling any part, or that\nhis hand was shaking, she would ask whether he had not been at work long\nenough; and then they would run out to the garden or the quarry, or to\njump George (if he was awake again) from the second mill-step.\n\nOne fine month of August, not a breath of wind had been blowing for a\nweek or two, so that the mill-sails had not made a single turn; not a\nload of gypsum had been brought during the time, and Oliver was quite\nout of alabaster; though, as it happened, he much wanted a good supply,\nfor a particular reason.  Every morning he brought out his tools; and\nevery morning the sky was so clear, the corn-fields so still--the very\ntrees so silent, that he wondered whether there had ever been so calm a\nmonth of August before.  His father and he employed their time upon the\ngarden, while they had so good an opportunity.  Before it was all put in\norder, and the entire stock of autumn cabbages set, there came a breezy\nday; and the children were left to finish the cabbage patch by\nthemselves.  While they were at work, it made them merry to hear the\nmill-sails whirring through the air, and to see, at intervals, the trees\nabove the quarry bowing their heads, and the reeds waving in the swamp,\nand the water of the meadow-ponds dimpling and rippling, as the wind\nswept over the Levels.  Oliver soon heard something that he liked better\nstill--the creak of the truck that brought the gypsum from the quarry,\nand the crack of the driver's whip.\n\nHe threw down the dibble with which he was planting out his cabbages--\ntripped over the line he had set to direct his drilling, tumbled on his\nface, scrambled up again, and ran, rubbing the dirt from his knees as he\nwent, to look out some alabaster from the load.\n\nMildred was not long after him, though he called to her that she had\nbetter stay and finish the cabbages, and though little George,\nimmediately on feeling himself at liberty, threw himself upon the fresh\nmould of the cabbage bed, and amused himself with pulling up, and\nflinging right and left, the plants that had just been set.  How could\nMildred attend to this, when she was sure she was wanted to turn over\nthe gypsum, and see what she could find?  So Master George went on with\nhis pranks, till Ailwin, by accident, saw him from the yard, ran and\nsnatched him up, flung him over her shoulder, and carried him away\nscreaming, till, to pacify him, she set him down among the poultry,\nwhich he presently found more amusing than young cabbage plants.\n\n\"Now we shall have a set of new cups for the spring, presently,\" said\nOliver, as he measured lump after lump with his little foot-rule.\n\n\"Cups for the waters!\" exclaimed his father.  \"So that is the reason of\nthis prodigious hurry, is it, my boy?  You think tin cups not good\nenough for your mother, or for her customers, or for the waters.  Which\nof them do you think ought to be ashamed of tin cups?\"\n\n\"The water, most of all.  Instead of sparkling in a clear bright glass,\nit looks as nasty as it tastes in a thing that is more brown and rusty\nevery time it is dipped.  I will give the folk a pair of cups that shall\ntempt them to drink--a pair of cups as white as milk.\"\n\n\"They will not long remain white: and those who broke the glasses will\nbe the more bent upon spoiling your cups, the more pains you spend upon\nthem.\"\n\n\"I hope the Redfurns will not happen to hear of them.  We need not blab;\nand the folk who drink the waters go their way, as soon as they have\ndone.\"\n\n\"Whether the Redfurns be here or there, my boy, there is no want of\nprying eyes to see all that the poor foreigners do.  Your mother is\nwatched, it is my belief, every time she dips her cup; and I in the\nmill, and you in the garden.  There is no hope of keeping anything from\nour enemies.\"\n\nSeeing Oliver look about him uneasily, Mr Linacre reproached himself\nfor having said anything to alarm his timid boy: so he added what he\nhimself always found the most comforting thought, when he felt disturbed\nat living among unkind neighbours.\n\n\"Let them watch us, Oliver.  We do nothing that we need be ashamed of.\nThe whole world is welcome to know how we live,--all we do, from year's\nend to year's end.\"\n\n\"Yes, if they would let us alone, father.  But it is so hard to have our\nthings broken and spoiled!\"\n\n\"So it is; and to know what ill-natured talk is going on about us.  But\nwe must let them take their own way, and bear it as well as we can; for\nthere is no help for it.\"\n\n\"I wish I were a justice!\" cried Mildred.  \"How I would punish them,\nevery one!\"\n\n\"Then I wish you were a justice, my dear; for we cannot get anybody\npunished as it is.\"\n\n\"Mildred,\" said Oliver, \"I wish you would finish the cabbages.  You know\nthey must be done; and I am very busy.\"\n\n\"Oh, Oliver!  I am such a little thing to plant a whole cabbage bed.\nYou will be able to come by and by; I want to help you.\"\n\n\"You cannot help me, dear: and you know how to do the cabbages as well\nas anybody.  You really cannot help me.\"\n\n\"Well, I want to see you then.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to see yet.  You will have done, if you make haste,\nbefore I begin to cut.  Do, dear!\"\n\n\"Well, I will,\" replied Mildred, cheerfully.  Her father caught her up,\nand gave her one good jump down the whole flight of steps, then bidding\nher work away before the plants were all withered and dead.\n\nShe did work away, till she was so hot and tired that she had to stop\nand rest.  There were still two rows to plant; and she thought she\nshould never get through them,--or at any rate, not before Oliver had\nproceeded a great way with his carving.  She was going to cry; but she\nremembered how that would vex Oliver: so she restrained herself, and ran\nto ask Ailwin whether she could come and help.  Ailwin always did what\neverybody asked her; so she gave over sorting feathers, and left them\nall about, while she went down the garden.\n\nMildred knew she must take little George away, or he would be making\nconfusion among the feathers that had been sorted.  She invited him to\ngo with her, and peep over the hedge at the geese in the marsh; and the\nlittle fellow took her fore-finger, and trotted away with his sister to\nthe hedge.\n\nThere were plenty of water-fowl in the marsh; and there was something\nelse which Mildred did not seem to like.  While George was\nquack-quacking, and making himself as like a little goose as he could,\nMildred softly called to Ailwin, and beckoned her to the hedge.  Ailwin\ncame, swinging the great spade in her right hand, as easily as Mildred\ncould flourish George's whip.\n\n\"Look,--look there!--under that bank, by the dyke!\" said Mildred, as\nsoftly as if she had been afraid of being heard at a yard's distance.\n\n\"Eh!  Look--if it be not the gipsies!\" cried Ailwin, almost as loud as\nif she had been talking across the marsh.  \"Eh dear!  We have got the\ngipsies upon us now; and what will become of my poultry?  Yon is a gipsy\ntent, sure; and we must tell the master and mistress, and keep an eye on\nthe poultry.  Sure, yon is a gipsy tent.\"\n\nLittle George, thinking that everybody was very much frightened, began\nto roar; and that made Ailwin talk louder still, to comfort him; so that\nnothing that Mildred said was heard.  At last, she pulled Ailwin's\napron, so that the tall woman stooped down, to ask what she wanted.\n\n\"I do not think it is the gipsies,\" said she.  \"I am afraid it is worse\nthan that.  I am afraid it is the Redfurns.  This is just the way they\nsettle themselves--in just that sort of tent--when they come to fowl,\nall autumn.\"\n\n\"If I catch that Roger,\" said Ailwin, \"I'll--.\"  And she clenched her\nhand, as if she meant to do terrible things, if she caught Roger.\n\n\"I will go and call father, shall I?\" said Mildred, her teeth\nchattering, as she stood in the hot sun.\n\nShe was turning to go up the garden, when a laugh from George made her\nlook back again.  She saw a head covered with an otter-skin cap,--the\nface looking very cross and threatening, peeping over the hedge,--which\nwas so high above the marsh, that the person must have climbed the bank\non purpose to look into the garden.  There was no mistaking the face.\nIt was certainly Roger Redfurn--the plague of the settlers, who, with\nhis uncle, Stephen Redfurn, was always doing all the mischief he could\nto everybody who had, as he said, trespassed on the marshes.  Nobody\nliked to see the Redfurns sitting down in the neighbourhood; and still\nless, skulking about the premises.  Mildred flew towards the mill; while\nAilwin, who never stopped to consider what was wise, and might not,\nperhaps, have hit upon wisdom if she had, took up a stone, and told\nRoger he had better be gone, for that he had no friends here.  Roger\nseemed to have just come from some orchard; for he pulled a hard apple\nout of his pocket, aimed it at Ailwin's head, and struck her such a blow\non the nose as made her eyes water.  While she was wiping her eyes with\nher apron, and trying to see again, Roger coaxed the child to bring him\nhis apple again, and disappeared.\n\nWhen Mildred reached the mill, she found Pastor Dendel there, talking\nwith her father about sending some manure to his land.  The pastor was\nso busy, that he only gave her a nod; and she had therefore time to\nrecover herself, instead of frightening everybody with her looks and her\nnews at once.  Oliver could not stay in the house while the pastor was\nat the mill: so he stood behind him, chipping away at the rough part of\nhis work.  Mildred whispered to him that the Redfurns were close at\nhand.  She saw Oliver turn very red, though he told her not to be\nfrightened.  Perhaps the pastor perceived this too, when he turned\nround, for he said--\n\n\"What is the matter, children?  Mildred, what have you been doing, that\nyou are so out of breath?  Have you been running all the way from\nLincoln spire?\"\n\n\"No, sir; not running--but--\"\n\n\"The Redfurns are come, sir,\" cried Oliver.  \"Father, the Redfurns are\ncome.\"\n\n\"Roger has been peeping over the hedge into the garden,\" cried Mildred,\nsinking into tears.\n\nThe miller looked grave, and said here was an end of all peace, for some\ntime to come.\n\n\"Are you all at the mercy of a boy like Roger Redfurn,\" asked the\npastor, \"so that you look as if a plague had come with this fresh\nbreeze?\"\n\n\"And his uncle, sir.\"\n\n\"And his aunt,\" added Mildred.\n\n\"You know what Stephen Redfurn is, sir,\" observed Mr Linacre.  \"Roger\nbeats even him for mischief.  And we are at their mercy, sir.  There is\nnot a magistrate, as you know, that will hear a complaint from one of us\nagainst the country-people.  We get nothing but trouble, and expense,\nand ridicule, by making complaints.  We know this beforehand; for the\ntriumph is always on the other side.\"\n\n\"It is hard,\" said the pastor: \"but still,--here is only a man, a woman,\nand a boy.  Cannot you defend yourselves against them?\"\n\n\"No, sir; because they are not an honourable enemy,\" replied Mr\nLinacre.  \"If Stephen would fight it out with me on even ground, we\nwould see who would beat: and I dare say my boy there, though none of\nthe roughest, would stand up against Roger.  But such fair trials do not\nsuit them, sir.  People who creep through drains, to do us mischief, and\nhide in the reeds when we are up and awake, and come in among us only\nwhen we are asleep, are a foe that may easily ruin any honest man, who\ncannot get protection from the law.  They houghed my cow, two years ago,\nsir.\"\n\n\"And they mixed all mother's feathers, for the whole year,\" exclaimed\nMildred.\n\n\"And they blinded my dog,\" cried Oliver;--\"put out its eyes.\"\n\n\"Oh!  What will they do next?\" said Mildred, looking up through her\ntears at the pastor.\n\n\"Worse things than even these have been done to some of the people in my\nvillage,\" replied the pastor: \"and they have been borne, Mildred,\nwithout tears.\"\n\nMildred made haste to wipe her eyes.\n\n\"And what do you think, my dears, of the life our Protestant brethren\nare leading now, in some parts of the world?\"\n\n\"Father came away from France because he was ill-used for being a\nProtestant,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"The pastor knows all about that, my boy,\" observed Mr Linacre.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said the pastor.  \"I know that you suffered worse things\nthere than here; and I know that things worse than either are at present\nendured by our brethren in Piedmont.  You have a warm house over your\nheads; and you live in sunshine and plenty.  They are driven from their\nvillages, with fire and sword--forced to shelter among the snow-drifts,\nand pent up in caves till they rush out starving, to implore mercy of\ntheir scoffing persecutors.  Could you bear this, children?\"\n\n\"They suffer these things for their religion,\" observed Oliver.  \"They\nfeel that they are martyrs.\"\n\n\"Do you think there is comfort in that thought,--in the pride of\nmartyrdom,--to the son who sees his aged parents perish by the\nwayside,--to the mother whose infant is dashed against the rock before\nher eyes?\"\n\n\"How _do_ they bear it all, then?\"\n\n\"They keep one another in mind that it is God's will, my dears; and that\nobedient children can, if they try, bear all that God sees fit to lay\nupon them.  So they praise His name with a strong heart, though their\nvoices be weak.  Morning and night, those mountains echo with hymns;\nthough death, in one form or another, is about the sufferers on every\nside.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr Linacre, \"let us make no more complaints about the\nRedfurns.  I am ashamed, when I think of our brethren abroad, that we\never let Stephen and Roger put us up to anger.  You will see no more\ntears here, sir, I hope.\"\n\n\"Mildred will not quite promise that,\" said the pastor, smiling kindly\non the little girl.  \"Make no promises, my dear, that a little girl like\nyou may be tempted to break.  Only try to forgive all people who tease\nand injure you; and remember that nothing more ever happens than God\npermits,--though He does not yet see fit to let us know why.\"\n\n\"I would only just ask this, sir,\" said Mr Linacre.  \"Is there anything\ngoing forward just now which particularly encourages our enemies to\nattack us?\"\n\n\"The parliament have a committee sitting at Lincoln, at present; and the\nking's cause seems to be low in these parts.  We are thus at the mercy\nof such as choose to consider us king's men: but there is a higher and\ntruer mercy always about us.\"\n\nThe miller took off his hat in token of respect.\n\nThe pastor's eye had been upon Oliver for some time.  He now asked\nwhether he meant to make his new cups plain, like all the rest, or to\ntry to ornament them.  Mildred assured him that Oliver had carved a\nbeading round the two last bowls that he had cut.\n\n\"I think you might attempt something far prettier than beading,\" said\nthe pastor; \"particularly with so many patterns before your eyes to work\nby.\"\n\nHe was looking up at the little recess above the door of the house, near\nwhich they were standing.  This recess, in which there had formerly been\nan image, was surrounded with carved stone-work.\n\n\"I see some foliage there which would answer your purpose, Oliver, if\nyou could make a model from it.  Let us look closer.\"\n\nAnd Pastor Dendel fixed a short ladder against the house wall, and went\nup, with Oliver before him.  They were so busy selecting the figures\nthat Oliver thought he could copy, and drawing them upon paper, and then\nsetting about modelling them in clay, that the Redfurns did not prevent\ntheir being happy for this day, at least.  Mr Linacre, too, was hard at\nwork all day, grinding, that the pastor's manure might be served\nto-morrow; and he found hard work as good for an anxious mind as those\nwho have tried generally find it to be.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. NEIGHBOURLY OFFICES.\n\nWhen Mrs Linacre was told in the evening of the arrival of the\ndisagreeable neighbours who were in the marsh, she was sorry; but when\nshe had gone round the premises with her husband at night, and found all\nsafe, and no tokens of any intrusion, she was disposed to hope that the\nRedfurns would, this time, keep to their fishing and fowling, and make\nno disturbance.  Oliver and Mildred crept down to the garden hedge at\nsunrise, and peeped through it, so as to see all that was doing in the\ncarr, as the marsh was called.  [In that part of the country, a carr\nmeans a morass.] After watching some time, they saw Stephen and Roger\ncreep out from under the low brown tent.  As the almost level sun shone\nfull in their faces, they rubbed their eyes; then they stretched and\nyawned, and seemed to be trying hard to wake themselves thoroughly.\n\n\"They have been sound asleep, however,\" observed Oliver to his sister;\n\"and it is still so early, that I do not believe they have been abroad\nabout mischief in the night.  They would not have been awake yet if they\nhad.\"\n\n\"Look!  There is a woman!\" exclaimed Mildred.  \"Is that Nan?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is Nan Redfurn,--Stephen's wife.  That is their great net\nthat she has over her arm.  They are going to draw the oval pond, I\nthink.  We can watch their sport nicely here.  They cannot see an inch\nof us.\"\n\n\"But we do not like that they should watch us,\" said Mildred, drawing\nback.  \"We should not like to know that they were peeping at us from\nbehind a hedge.\"\n\n\"We should not mind it if we were not afraid of them,\" replied Oliver.\n\"It is because they plot mischief that we cannot bear their prying.  We\nare not going to do them any mischief, you know; and they cannot mean to\nmake any secret of what they are doing in the middle of the carr, with\nhigh ground all about it.\"  Satisfied by this, Mildred crouched down,\nwith her arm about her brother's neck, and saw the great net cast, and\nthe pond almost emptied of its fish,--some few being kept for food, and\nthe small fry--especially of the stickleback--being thrown into heaps,\nto be sold for manure.\n\n\"Will they come this way when they have done drawing the pond?\" asked\nMildred, in some fear, as she saw them moving about.\n\n\"I think they will sweep the shallow waters, there to the left, for more\nstickleback,\" replied Oliver.  \"They will make up a load, to sell before\nthe heat of the day, before they set about anything else.\"\n\nOliver was right.  All the three repaired to the shallow water, and\nstood among the reeds, so as to be half hidden.  The children could see,\nhowever, that when little George came down the garden, shouting to them\nto come to breakfast, the strangers took heed to the child.  They turned\ntheir heads for a moment towards the garden, and then spoke together and\nlaughed.\n\n\"There, now!\" cried Oliver, vexed: \"that is all because we forgot to go\nto breakfast.  So much for my not having a watch!  Mother need not have\nsent George to make such a noise; but, if I had had a watch, he would\nnot have come at all; and these people would not have been put in mind\nof us.\"\n\n\"You will soon be able to have a watch now, like the boys in Holland,\"\nsaid Mildred.  \"Your alabaster things will change away for a watch; will\nnot they?  But we might not have remembered breakfast, if you had had a\nwatch.\"\n\n\"We are forgetting it now,\" said Oliver, catching up George and running\nto the house, followed by Mildred, who could not help feeling as if\nRoger was at her heels.\n\nThey were surprised to find how late it was.  Their father was already\ngone with Pastor Dendel's load of manure.  Their mother only waited to\nkiss them before she went, and to tell them the their father meant to be\nback as soon as he could; and that meantime, neighbour Gool had promised\nto keep an eye on the mill.  If anything happened to frighten them,\nOliver or Ailwin had only to set the mill-sails agoing, and neighbour\nGool and his men would be with them presently.  She did not think,\nhowever, that anything would happen in the little time that their father\nwould be away.\n\n\"I will tell you what we will do!\" cried Oliver, starting from his\nchair, after he had been eating his bread and milk, in silence, for some\ntime after his mother's departure.  \"Let us dress up a figure to look\nlike father, and set him at the mill-window; so that those Redfurns\nshall not find out that he is away.  Won't that be good?\"\n\n\"Put him on the mill-steps.  They may not look up at the window.\"\n\n\"The mill-steps, then.  Where is father's old hat?  Put it on the broom\nthere, and see how it looks.  Run up to the mill, dear, and bring his\njacket--and his apron,\" he shouted as his sister ran.\n\nMildred brought both, and they dressed up the broom.\n\n\"That will never do,\" said Mildred.  \"Look how the sleeves hang; and how\nhe holds his head!  It is not a bit like a man.\"\n\n\"'Tis a good scarecrow,\" declared Ailwin.  \"I have seen many a worse\nscarecrow than that.\"\n\n\"But this is to scare the Redfurns, and they are far wiser than crows,\"\nsaid Mildred.  \"Look how George pulls at the apron, and tugs at the\nbroomstick behind!  It does not scare even him.\"\n\n\"It will look very different on the steps--in the open air,\" Oliver\ndeclared.  \"A bunch or two of straw in the sleeves, and under the\njacket, will make it seem all alive.\"\n\nAnd he carried it out, and tied it upon the mill-steps.  It was no easy\nmatter to fasten it so as to make it look at all like a man naturally\nmounting stairs.  The more difficult it was, however, the more they all\nbecame interested in the business.  Mildred brought straw, and Ailwin\ntied a knot here, and another knot there, while Oliver cocked the hat in\nvarious directions upon the head, till they all forgot what they were\ndressing up the figure for.  The reason popped into Ailwin's head again,\nwhen she had succeeded in raising the right arm to the rail, in a very\nlife-like manner.\n\n\"There!\" said she, stepping backwards to view her work, \"that makes a\nvery good master for me.  I will obey him in everything he bids me till\nmaster comes home.\"\n\nAt the same moment, she walked backwards against something, and little\nGeorge clung screaming to Mildred's knees.  Roger had spread his arms\nfor Ailwin to walk back into; and Stephen was behind, leaning against\nthe cow-shed.  They had been watching all that the party had been doing,\nand, having overheard every word, had found out the reason.\n\nThe children saw at once how very foolish they had been; and the thought\nconfused them so much, that they did not know what to do next.  Poor\nAilwin, who could never learn wisdom, more or less, now made matters\nworse by all she said and did.  Stout and strong as she was, she could\ndo nothing, for Roger had taken the hint she had given by walking\nbackwards, with her arms crossed behind her: he had pinioned her.  She\ncried out to Oliver to run up, and set the mill-sails agoing, to bring\nneighbour Gool.  Stephen took this second hint.  He quietly swung Oliver\noff the steps, sent down his scarecrow after him, and himself took his\nseat on the threshold of the mill.  There he sat, laughing to see how\nAilwin wearied herself with struggles, while Roger, by merely hanging on\nher arms, prevented her getting free.  When, however, Oliver flew at the\nboy, and struck him some fierce blows, Stephen came down, drove the\nlittle girl and the baby into the house, and locked them in, and then\nwent to help Roger with his strong arm.\n\nIt was clear to Mildred what she ought to do.  Crying as she was, she\nput George in a corner, with some playthings, to keep him from the fire\ntill she came to him again, and then mounted the stairs, as quickly as\nher trembling limbs would let her,--first to her mother's room, and then\nout upon the roof.  She tied a large red handkerchief of her mother's\nupon her father's Sunday walking-stick, and then waved it, as high as\nshe could hold it, above her head, while she considered how she could\nfasten it; for it would never do to leave George alone below for many\nminutes.  Perhaps neighbour Gool had seen it already, and would soon be\nhere with his men.  But, lest he should not, she must fix her flag, and\ntrust to Stephen and Roger not thinking of looking up to the roof from\nthe yard below.  At last, after many attempts, she thrust the stick into\na crevice of the roof, and fixed it with heavy things round it,--having\nrun down three or four times, to see that George was safe.\n\nThere was, indeed, no time to be lost, for the intruders below were\ndoing all the mischief they could think of, short of robbing and burning\nthe premises.  The great tall man, Stephen, strolling about the lower\nrooms, found Mrs Linacre's knitting, and pulled out the needles, and\nunravelled the work.  Roger spied a heap of bulbs on the corner of a\nhigh shelf.  They were Mr Linacre's rare and valuable tulip-roots,\nbrought from Holland.  Roger cut one of them open, to see what it looked\nlike, and then threw the whole lot into the boiler, now steaming over\nthe fire, saying the family should have a dish the more at dinner\nto-day.  They got hold of Oliver's tools, and the cup he was at work\nupon.  Stephen raised his arm, about to dash the cup to the ground, when\nOliver sprang forward, and said--\n\n\"You shall have it,--you shall have my cup;--you don't know what a\nbeauty it will be, when it is done.  Only let me finish it, and you\nshall have it in exchange for the stickleback you caught this morning.\nThe stickleback will do to manure our garden; and I am sure you will\nlike the cup, if you will only let me finish it.\"\n\n\"Manure your garden, indeed!\" cried Stephen, gruffly.  \"I'll cut up your\ngarden to shreds first.  What business has your garden in our carr?  You\nand your great landlord will find what it is to set your outlandish\nplants growing where our geese ought to be grazing.  We'll show you that\nwe don't want any foreigners here; and if you don't like our usage, you\nmay go home again; and nobody will cry for you back.\"\n\n\"We pay for our garden and our mill,\" said Oliver.  \"We wrong nobody,\nand we work for our living, and you are a very cruel man.\"\n\n\"You pay the king: and the parliament does not choose that the king\nshould have any more money to spend against them.  Mind you that, boy!\nAnd--\"\n\n\"I am sure I don't know anything about the king and the parliament, or\nany such quarrels,\" said Oliver.  \"It is very hard to punish us for\nthem, it is very cruel.\"\n\n\"You shall have reason to call me cruel twenty times over, if you don't\nget away out of our carr,\" said Stephen.  \"Manure your garden, indeed!\nNot I!  And you shall not manure another yard in these Levels.  Come\nhere, Roger.\"\n\nThey went out again into the yard, and Oliver, now quite overcome, laid\ndown his head on his arms, and cried bitterly.\n\n\"Here's your cup, however,\" said Ailwin, now released by Roger's being\nemployed elsewhere.  \"This bit of plaster is the only thing they have\nlaid hands on that they have not ruined.\"  Oliver started up, and hid\nhis work and tools in a bundle of straw, in the corner of the kitchen.\n\n\"What Mildred will say, I don't know,\" said Ailwin.  \"That boy has wrung\nthe neck of her white hen.\"\n\nOliver was desperate on hearing this.  He ran out to see whether he\ncould not, by any means, get into the mill, to set the sails agoing: but\nthere were Stephen and Roger, carrying water, which they threw over all\nthe gypsum that was ground,--floating away as much as they could of it,\nand utterly spoiling the rest, by turning it into a plaster.\n\n\"Did you ever see the like?\" cried Ailwin.  \"And there is nothing master\nis so particular about as keeping that stuff dry.  See the woman, too!\nHow I'd like to tug the hair off her head!  She looks badly, poor\ncreature, too.\"\n\nStephen's wife had, indeed, come up to enjoy the sport, when she found\nthat no man was on the premises, and that there was no danger.  There\nshe stood, leaning against a post of the mill, her black, untidy hair\nhanging about her pale, hollow cheeks, and her lean arms crossed upon\nher bosom.\n\n\"There were such ague-struck folk to be seen at every turn,\" said\nAilwin, \"before the foreigners came to live in the carr.  I suppose they\nbrought some healing with them; for one does not often see now such a\npoor creature as that.  She might be ashamed of herself,--that woman;\nshe laughs all her poor sides can, at every pailful Roger pours out.--\nEh!  But she's not laughing now!  Eh!  What's the matter now?\"\n\nThe matter was that neighbour Gool was in sight, with three or four men.\nA cheer was heard from them while they were still some way off.  Oliver\nran out and cheered, waving his hat over his head.  Ailwin cheered,\nwaving a towel out of the window.  Mildred cheered from the roof, waving\nher red flag; and George stood in the doorway, shouting and clapping his\nlittle hands.\n\nIf the object was to catch the trespassers, all this cheering took place\na little too soon.  Stephen and Roger were off, like their own\nwild-ducks,--over the garden hedge, and out of sight.  Neighbour Gool\ndeclared that if they were once fairly among the reeds in the marsh, it\nwould be sheer waste of time to search for them; for they could dodge\nand live in the water, in a way that honest people that lived on proper\nhard ground could not follow.  Here was the woman; and yonder was the\ntent.  Revenge might be taken that way, better than by ducking in the\nponds after the man and boy.  Suppose they took the woman to prison, and\nmade a great fire in the carr, of the tent and everything in it!\n\nOliver did not see that it could make up to them for what they had lost,\nto burn the tent; and he was pretty sure his father would not wish such\na thing to be done.  His father would soon be home.  As for the woman,\nhe thought she ought to go to prison, if Mr Gool would take her there.\n\n\"That I will,\" said Gool.  \"I will go through with the thing now I am in\nit.  I came off the minute I saw your red flag; and I might have been\nhere sooner, if I had not been so full of watching the mill-sails, that\nI never looked off from them till my wife came to help to watch.  Come,\nyou woman,\" said he to Nan Redfurn, \"make no faces about going to\nprison, for I am about to give you a ride there.\"\n\n\"She looks very ill,\" thought Oliver,--\"not fit to be jolted on a\nhorse.\"\n\n\"You'll get no magistrate to send me to prison,\" said the woman.  \"The\njustices are with the parliament, every one.  You will only have to\nbring me back, and be sorry you caught me, when you see what comes of\nit.\"\n\n\"Cannot we take care of her here till father comes home?\" said Oliver,\nseeing that neighbour Gool looked perplexed, and as if he believed what\nthe woman said.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mildred, whispering to her brother.  \"Don't let that\nwoman stay here.\"\n\n\"Neighbour Gool will take care of us till father comes home,\" said\nOliver: \"and the woman looks so ill!  We can lock her up here: and, you\nsee, Ailwin is ever so much stronger than she is, poor thing!\"\n\nNeighbour Gool put on an air of being rather offended that nothing great\nwas to be done, after his trouble in coming to help.  In his heart,\nhowever, he was perhaps not very sorry; for he knew that the magistrates\nwere not willing to countenance the king's settlers in the Levels, while\nthe Parliament Committee was sitting at Lincoln.  Gool patted Oliver's\nhead when the boy thanked him for coming; and he joked Mildred about her\nflag: so he could not be very cross.  He left two men to guard the\nprisoner and the premises, till Mr Linacre should return.\n\nThese two men soon left off marching about the garden and yard, and sat\ndown on the mill-steps; for the day grew very hot.  There they sat\ntalking in the shade, till their dinners should be ready.  Nan Redfurn\nwas so far from feeling the day to be hot, that when her cold ague-fit\ncame on, she begged to be allowed to go down to the kitchen fire.\nLittle George stood staring at her for some time, and then ran away; and\nMildred, not liking to be in the same room with a woman who looked as\nshe did, and who was a prisoner, stole out too, though she had been\ndesired to watch the woman till dinner should be ready.  Ailwin was so\nstruck with compassion, that she fetched her warmest woollen stockings\nand her winter cloak of linsey-woolsey,--it was such a piteous thing to\nhear a woman's teeth chattering in her head, in that way, at noon in the\nmiddle of August.  Having wrapped her up, she put her on a stool, close\nto the great kitchen fire; and drew out the screen that was used only in\nwinter, to keep off the draughts from the door.  If the poor soul was\nnot warm in that corner, nothing could make her so.  Then Ailwin began\nto sing to cheer her heart, and to be amazingly busy in cooking dinner\nfor three additional persons.  She never left off her singing but when\nshe out went for the vegetables, and other things she wanted for her\ncooking; and when she came in again she resumed her song,--still for the\nsake of the poor creature behind the screen.\n\n\"Do you feel yourself warmer now, neighbour?\" said she at the end of an\nhour.  \"If not, you are past my understanding.\"\n\nThere was no answer; and Ailwin did not wonder, as she said to herself,\nthat it was too great a trouble for one so poorly to be answering\nquestions: so Ailwin went on slicing her vegetables and singing.\n\n\"Do you think a drop of cherry-brandy would warm you, neighbour?\" she\nasked, after a while.  \"I wonder I never thought of that before; only,\nit is a sort of thing one does not recollect till winter comes.  Shall I\nget you a sup of cherry-brandy?\"\n\nAilwin thought it so odd that such an offer as this should not be\nreplied to, that she looked hastily behind the screen, to see what could\nbe the reason.  There was reason enough.  Nobody was there.  Nan Redfurn\nhad made her way out as soon as she found herself alone, and was gone,\nwith Ailwin's best winter stockings and linsey-woolsey cloak.\n\nIn a minute the whole party were looking over the hedge into the marsh.\nNothing was to be seen but the low brown tent, and the heap of little\nfish.  Neither man, woman, nor boy appeared when their names were\nshouted forth.\n\n\"Oh!  My best stockings!\" said Ailwin, half crying.\n\n\"You have saved your cherry-brandy, my woman, that is certain,\" observed\none of Gool's men.\n\n\"I shall never have any pleasure in it,\" sighed the maid.  \"I shall\nnever enjoy it on account of its reminding me how yon woman has fooled\nme.\"\n\n\"Then we will save you that pain,\" said the man.  \"If you will oblige us\nwith it to-day we won't leave any to pain you in the winter.\"\n\n\"For shame,\" cried Oliver, \"when you know she has lost her stockings and\nher cloak already!  And all out of kindness!  I would not drink a drop\nof her cherry-brandy, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Then you shall, Oliver, for saying so, and taking my part,\" said\nAilwin.  \"I am not going to give it to anyone else that has not the\nague; some people may be assured of that.\"\n\n\"If I thought there was any cherry-brandy for me when I came back,\" said\nthe man, throwing a stone down to try the nature of the bog-ground\nbeneath, \"I would get below there, and try what I could find.  I might\nlay hold of a linsey-woolsey cloak somewhere in the bog.\"\n\n\"You can never catch the Redfurns, I doubt,\" said Ailwin.  \"What was it\nthey said to you, Oliver, as they were going off?\"\n\n\"They laughed at me for not being able to catch eels, and asked how I\nthought I should catch _them_.  They said when I could decoy wild-fowl,\nI might set a trap for the Redfurns.  But it does not follow that that\nis all true because they said it.  I don't see but they might be caught\nif there was anyone to do us justice afterwards.  That's the worst part\nof it, father says.\"\n\n\"There's father!\" cried Mildred, as the crack of a whip was heard.  All\nstarted off, as if to see who could carry bad news fastest.  All arrived\nin the yard together, except Ailwin, who turned back to take up George,\nas he roared at being left behind.\n\n\"We must want a wise head or two among us,\" said the vexed miller.  \"If\nwe were as sharp as these times require, we surely could not be at the\nmercy of folk we should scorn to be like.  We must give more heed and\nsee what is to be done.\"\n\n\"Rather late for that, neighbour, when here is the stock you were\ngrinding and grinding for a week, all gone to plaster,\" said one of\nGool's men.\n\n\"That is what I say,\" replied the miller, contemplating the waste; \"but\nit may be better late than not at all.\"\n\nMrs Linacre was more affected than her husband by what had happened.\nWhen she came home, poor Mildred's fortitude had just given way, and she\nwas crying over the body of her dear white hen.  This caused Ailwin's\neyes to fill at the thought of her stockings and cloak, so that the\nfamily faces looked cheerless enough.\n\n\"We deserve it all,\" said Mrs Linacre, \"for leaving our place and our\nchildren to the care of Gool's men, or of anybody but ourselves.  I will\ngo no more to the spring.  I have been out of my duty; and we may be\nthankful that we have been no further punished.\"\n\nAs she spoke a few tears started.  Her tears were so rare, that the\nchildren looked in dismay at their father.\n\nHe gently declared that the more injury they suffered from the\ncountry-people the more they needed all the earnings they could make.\nThey must cling to the means of an honest maintenance, and not throw\naway such an employment as hers.  He would not leave the children again\nwhile the Redfurns were in the neighbourhood.  He would not have left\nthem to-day, to serve anyone but the pastor; nor to serve even him, if\nhe had not thought he had bespoken sufficient protection.  Nothing\nshould take him from home, or his eye off the children, to-morrow, she\nmight depend upon it.\n\nMrs Linacre said that if she must go she should take a heavy heart with\nher.  This was, she feared, but the first of a fresh series of attacks.\nIf so, what might not they look for next?  However, she only asked to be\nfound in her duty.  If her husband desired her to go, she would go; but\nshe should count over the hours of the day sadly enough.\n\nOliver ventured to bring up an old subject.  He said what he most wanted\nwas to have earned money enough to get a watch.  He was sure he could\nhide it so that Roger should never guess he had one; and it would be\nsuch a comfort to know exactly how the time was going, and when to look\nfor his mother home, instead of having to guess, in cloudy weather, the\nhour of the day, and to argue the matter with Ailwin, who was always\nwrong about that particular thing.\n\nHis father smiled mournfully, as he observed, that he hoped Oliver would\nnever so want bread as to leave off longing for anything made of gold or\nsilver.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. ONE WAY OF MAKING WAR.\n\nMrs Linacre went to the spring as usual, the next morning.  If the\nweather had been doubtful--if there had been any pretence for supposing\nthat the day might not be fine, she would have remained at home.  But\nshe looked in vain all round the sky for a cloud: and the wide expanse\nof fields and meadows in the Levels, with their waving corn and fresh\ngreen grass, seemed to bask in the sunshine, as if they felt its luxury.\nIt was a glowing August day;--just such a day as would bring out the\ninvalids from Gainsborough to drink the waters;--just such a day as\nwould tempt the traveller to stop under the shady shed, where he could\nsee waters bubbling up, and taste of the famous medicinal spring, which\nwould cure the present evil of heat, whatever effect it might have on\nany more lasting ailment.  It was just the day when Mrs Linacre must\nnot be missed from her post, and when it would be wrong to give up the\nearnings which she might expect before sun-down.  So she desired her\nchildren not to leave the premises,--not even to go out of their\nfather's sight and hearing; and left them, secure, at least, that they\nwould obey her wishes.\n\nThey were quite willing to do so.  Mildred looked behind her, every few\nminutes, while she worked in the garden, to see whether Roger was not\nthere, and at every rustle that the birds made among the trees on the\nRed-hill,--the eminence behind the house,--she fancied that some one was\nhidden there.  Oliver let his tools and his alabaster lie hidden, much\nas he longed to be at work with them.  Mildred had lost her greatest\ntreasure,--the white hen.  He must take care of his greatest treasure.\nTwice, in the course of the morning, he went in, having thought of a\nsafer place; and twice more he put them back among the straw, as safest\nthere after all.  He let them alone at last, on Mildred saying that she\nwas afraid Roger might somehow discover why he went in and out so often.\n\nThey ran to the mill three or four times to tell their father that the\nbrown tent was still under the bank in the carr, and that they could see\nnobody; though the wild-ducks and geese made such a fluttering and\nnoise, now and then, that it seemed as if some one was lurking about the\nponds.  Often in the course of the morning, too, did Mr Linacre look\nout of the mill-window, or nod to them from the top of the steps, that\nthey might see that he did not forget them.  Meantime, the white smoke\ncurled up from the kitchen chimney, as Ailwin cooked the dinner; and\nlittle George's voice and hers were often heard from within, as if they\nwere having some fun together.\n\nThe children were very hot, and began to say that they were hungry, and\nthought dinner-time was near, when they suddenly felt a strong rush of\nwind from the west.  Oliver lost his cap, and was running after it, when\nboth heard a loud shout from their father, and looked up.  They had\nnever heard him shout so loud as he now did, bidding them run up the\nRed-hill that moment.  He waved his arm and his cap in that direction,\nas if he was mad.  Mildred scampered up the hill.  She did not know why,\nnor what was the meaning of the rolling, roaring thunder which seemed to\nconvulse the air: but her head was full of Roger; and she thought it was\nsome mischief of his.  One part of the Red-hill was very steep, and the\nground soft.  Her feet slipped on the moss first, and when she had got\nabove the moss, the red earth crumbled; and she went back at every step,\ntill she caught hold of some brambles, and then of the trunk of a tree;\nso that, trembling and panting, she reached at last the top of the\neminence.\n\nWhen she looked round, she saw a rushing, roaring river where the garden\nhad been, just before.  Rough waters were dashing up against the hill on\nwhich she stood,--against the house,--and against the mill.  She saw the\nflood spreading, as rapidly as the light at sunrise, over the whole\nexpanse of the Levels.  She saw another flood bursting in from the\nHumber, on the north-east, and meeting that which had just swept by;--\nshe saw the two floods swallowing up field after field, meadow after\nmeadow, splashing up against every house, and surrounding all, so that\nthe roofs, and the stacks beside them, looked like so many little\nislands.  She saw these things in a moment, but did not heed them till\nafterwards,--for, where was Oliver?\n\nOliver was safe, though it was rather a wonder that he was so,\nconsidering his care for his cap.  Oliver was an orderly boy, accustomed\nto take great care of his things; and it did not occur to him to let his\ncap go, when he had to run for his life.  He had to part with it,\nhowever.  He was flying after it, when another shout from his father\nmade him look round; and then he saw the wall of water, as he called it,\nrolling on directly upon the house.  He gave a prodigious spring across\nthe garden ditch, and up the hill-side, and but just escaped; for the\nwind which immediately preceded the flood blew him down; and it was\nclinging to the trunk of a tree that saved him, as his sister had been\nsaved just before.  As it was, his feet were wet.  Oliver panted and\ntrembled like his sister, but he was safe.\n\nEvery one was safe.  Ailwin appeared at an upper window, exhibiting\nlittle George.  Mr Linacre stood, with folded arms, in the doorway of\nhis mill; and his wife was (he was thankful to remember) on the side of\na high hill, far away.  The children and their father knew, while the\nflood was roaring between them, what all were thinking of; and at the\nsame moment, the miller and his boy waved, the one his hat, and the\nother a green bough, high and joyously over their heads.  Little George\nsaw this from the window, and clapped his hands, and jumped, as Ailwin\nheld him on the window-sill.\n\n\"Look at Geordie!\" cried Mildred.  \"Do look at him!  Don't you think you\nhear him now?\"\n\nThis happy mood could not last very long, however, as the waters,\ninstead of going down, were evidently rising every moment.  From the\nfirst, the flood had been too deep and rapid to allow of the miller\ncrossing from his mill to his house.  He was a poor swimmer; and no\nswimmer, he thought, could have avoided being carried away into the wide\nmarsh, where there was no help.  Then, instead of the stream slackening,\nit rushed more furiously as it rose,--rose first over the wall of the\nyard, and up to the fourth--fifth--sixth step of the mill-ladder, and\nthen almost into the branches of the apple-trees in the garden.\n\n\"I hope you will not mind being hungry, Mildred,\" said her brother,\nafter a time of silence.  \"We are not likely to have any dinner to-day,\nI think.\"\n\n\"I don't mind that, very much,\" said Mildred, \"but how do you think we\nare to get away, with this great river between us and home?\"\n\n\"We shall see what father does,\" said Oliver.  \"He is further off still,\non the other side.\"\n\n\"But what is all this water?  When will it go away?\"\n\n\"I am afraid the embankments have burst.  And yet the weather has been\nfine enough lately.  Perhaps the sluices are broken up.\"\n\nSeeing that Mildred did not understand the more for what he said, he\nexplained--\n\n\"You know, all these Levels were watery grounds once; more wet than the\ncarr yonder.  Well,--great clay banks were made to keep out the Humber\nwaters, over there, to the north-east, and on the west and north-west\nyonder, to keep two or three rivers there from overflowing the land.\nThen several canals and ditches were cut, to drain the land; and there\nare great gates put up, here and there, to let the waters in and out, as\nthey are wanted.  I am afraid those gates are gone, or the clay banks\nbroken down, so that the sea and the rivers are pouring in all the water\nthey have.\"\n\n\"But when will it be over?  Will it ever run off again?  Shall we ever\nget home again?\"\n\n\"I do not know anything about it.  We must wait, and watch what father\nwill do.  See!  What is this coming?\"\n\n\"A dead horse!\" exclaimed Mildred.  \"Drowned, I suppose.  Don't you\nthink so, Oliver?\"\n\n\"Drowned, of course.--Do you know, Mildred,\" he continued, after a\nsilence, during which he was looking towards the sheds in the yard,\nwhile his sister's eyes were following the body of the horse as it was\nswept along, now whirled round in an eddy, and now going clear over the\nhedge into the carr,--\"do you know, Mildred,\" said Oliver, \"I think\nfather will be completely ruined by this flood.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said Mildred, who did not quite know what it was to be ruined.\n\"How?  Why?\"\n\n\"Why, it was bad enough that so much gypsum was spoiled yesterday.  I am\nafraid now the whole quarry will be spoiled.  And then I doubt whether\nthe harvest will not be ruined all through the Levels: and I am pretty\nsure nothing will be growing in the garden when the waters are gone.\nThat was not our horse that went by; but our horse may be drowned, and\nthe cow, and the sow, and everything.\"\n\n\"Not the fowls,\" said Mildred.  \"Look at them, all in a row on the top\nof the cow-shed.  They will not be drowned, at any rate.\"\n\n\"But then they may be starved.  O dear!\" he continued, with a start of\nrecollection, \"I wonder whether Ailwin has thought of moving the meal\nand the grain up-stairs.  It will be all rotted and spoiled if the water\nruns through it.\"\n\nHe shouted, and made signs to Ailwin, with all his might; but in vain.\nShe could not hear a word he said, or make anything of his signs.  He\nwas vexed, and said Ailwin was always stupid.\n\n\"So she is,\" replied Mildred; \"but it does not signify now.  Look how\nthe water is pouring out of the parlour-window.  The meal and grain must\nhave been wet through long ago.  Is not that a pretty waterfall?  A\nwaterfall from our parlour-window, down upon the tulip-bed!  How very\nodd!\"\n\n\"If one could think how to feed these poor animals,\" said Oliver,--\"and\nthe fowls!  If there was anything here that one could get for them!  One\nmight cut a little grass for the cow;--but there is nothing else.\"\n\n\"Only the leaves of the trees, and a few blackberries, when they are\nripe,\" said Mildred, looking round her, \"and flowers,--wild-flowers, and\na few that mother planted.\"\n\n\"The bees!\" cried Oliver.  \"Let us save them.  They can feed themselves.\nWe will save the bees.\"\n\n\"Why, you don't think they are drowned?\" said Mildred.\n\nThe bees were not drowned; but they were in more danger of it than\nMildred supposed.  Their little shed was placed on the side of the\nRed-hill, so as to overlook the flowery garden.  The waters stood among\nthe posts of this shed; and the hives themselves shook with every wave\nthat rolled along.\n\n\"You cannot do it, Oliver,\" cried Mildred, as her brother crept down the\nslope to the back of the shed.  \"You can never get round, Oliver.  You\nwill slip in, Oliver!\"\n\nOliver looked round and nodded, as there was no use in speaking in such\na noise.  He presently showed that he did not mean to go round to the\nfront of the shed.  That would never have done; for the flood had washed\naway the soil there, and left nothing to stand upon.  He broke away the\nboards at the back of the bee-shed, which were old and loosely fastened.\nHe was glad he had come; for the bees were bustling about in great\nconfusion and distress, evidently aware that something great was the\nmatter.  Oliver seized one of the hives, with the board it stood on, and\ncarried it, as steadily as he could, to a sunny part of the hill, where\nhe put it down on the grass.  He then went for another, asking Mildred\nto come part of the way down to receive the second hive, and put it by\nthe first, as he saw there was not a moment to lose.  She did so; but\nshe trembled so much, that it was probable she would have let the hive\nfall, if it had ever been in her hands.  It never was, however.  The\nsoil was now melting away in the water, where Oliver had stood firmly\nbut a few minutes before.  He had to take great care, and to change his\nfooting every instant; and it was not without slipping and sliding, and\nwet feet, that he brought away the second hive.  Mildred saw how hot he\nwas, as he sat resting, with the hive, before climbing the bank, and\nbegged that he would not try any more.\n\n\"These poor bees!\" exclaimed Oliver, beginning to move again, on the\nthought of the bees being drowned.  But he had done all he could.  The\nwater boiled up between the shed and the bank, lifted the whole\nstructure, and swept it away.  Oliver hastened to put down the second\nhive beside the first; and when he returned, saw that the posts had\nsunk, the boards were floating away, and the remaining hive itself\nsailing down the stream.\n\n\"How it rocks!\" cried Mildred.  \"I wish it would turn quite over, so\nthat the poor things might get out, and fly away.\"\n\n\"They never will,\" said Oliver.  \"I wish I had thought of the bees a\nlittle sooner.  It is very odd that you did not, Mildred.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to think of anything,\" said Mildred, dolefully; \"it is\nall so odd and so frightful!\"\n\n\"Well, don't cry, if you can help it, dear,\" said her brother.  \"We\nshall see what father will do.  He won't cry;--I am sure of that.\"\n\nMildred laughed: for she never had seen her father cry.\n\n\"He was not far off crying yesterday, though,\" said Oliver, \"when he saw\nyour poor hen lying dead.  He looked--but, O Mildred!  What can have\nbecome of the Redfurns?  We have, been thinking all this while about the\nbees; and we never once remembered the Redfurns.  Why, their tent was\nscarcely bigger than our hives; and I am sure it could not stand a\nminute against the flood.\"\n\nWhile he spoke, Oliver was running to the part of the hill which\ncommanded the widest view of the carr, and Mildred was following at his\nheels,--a good deal startled by the hares which leaped across her path.\nThere seemed to be more hares now on the hill than she had seen in all\nher life before.  She could not ask about the hares, however, when she\nsaw the brown tent, or a piece of it, flapping about in the water, a\ngreat way off, and sweeping along with the current.\n\n\"Hark!  What was that?  Did you hear?\" said Oliver, turning very pale.\n\n\"I thought I heard a child crying a great way off,\" said Mildred,\ntrembling.\n\n\"It was not a child, dear.  It was a shriek,--a woman's shriek, I am\nafraid.  I am afraid it is Nan Redfurn, somewhere in the carr.  O dear,\nif they should all be drowned, and nobody there to help them!\"\n\n\"No, no,--I don't believe it,\" said Mildred.  \"They have got up\nsomewhere,--climbed up something,--that bank or something.\"\n\nThey heard nothing more, amidst the dash of the flood, and they fancied\nthey could see some figures moving on the ridge of the bank, far out\nover the carr.  When they were tired of straining their eyes, they\nlooked about them, and saw, in a smoother piece of water near their\nhill, a dog swimming, and seeming to labour very much.\n\n\"It has got something fastened to it,\" cried Mildred;--\"something tied\nround its neck.\"\n\n\"It is somebody swimming,\" replied Oliver.  \"They will get safe here\nnow.  Cannot we help them?  I wish I had a rope!  A long switch may do.\nI will get a long switch.\"\n\n\"Yes, cut a long switch,\" cried Mildred: and she pulled and tugged at a\nlong tough thorny bramble, not minding its pricking her fingers and\ntearing her frock.  She could not help starting at the immense number of\nlarge birds that flew out, and rabbits that ran away between her feet,\nwhile she was about it; but she never left hold, and dragged the long\nbramble down to the part of the hill that the dog seemed to be trying to\nreach.  Oliver was already there, holding a slip of ash, such as he had\nsometimes cut for a fishing-rod.\n\n\"It is Roger, I do believe; but I see nothing of the others,\" said he.\n\"Look at his head, as it bobs up and down.  Is it not Roger?\"\n\n\"O dear!  I hope not!\" cried Mildred, in a tone of despair.  \"What shall\nwe do if he comes?\"\n\n\"We must see that afterwards: we must save him first.  Now for it!\"\n\nAs Oliver spoke, the dog ducked, and came up again without Roger,\nswimming lightly to the bank, and leaping ashore with a bark.  Roger was\nthere, however,--very near, but they supposed, exhausted, for he seemed\nto fall back, and sink, on catching hold of Oliver's switch, and by the\njerk twitched it out of the boy's hand.\n\n\"Try again!\" shouted Oliver, as he laid Mildred's bramble along the\nwater.  \"Don't let go, Mildred.\"\n\nMildred let the thorns run deep into her fingers without leaving her\nhold.  Roger grasped the other end: and they pulled, without jerking,\nand with all their strength, till he reached the bank, and they could\nhelp him out with their hands.\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad you are safe, Roger!\" said Oliver.\n\n\"You might have found something better than that thorny switch to throw\nme,\" said Roger.  \"My hands are all blood with the spikes.\"\n\n\"Look at hers!\" cried Oliver, intending to show the state that his\nsister's hands were in, for Roger's sake; but Mildred pulled away her\nhands, and hid them behind her as she retreated, saying,--\n\n\"No, no.  Never mind that now.\"\n\nOliver saw how drenched the poor boy looked, and forgave whatever he\nmight say.  He asked Mildred to go back to the place where they had been\nstanding, opposite the house; and he would come to her there presently.\nHe then begged Roger to slip off his coat and trousers, that they might\nwring the wet out of them.  He thought they would soon dry in the sun.\nBut Roger pushed him away with his shoulder, and said he knew what he\nwanted;--he wanted to see what he had got about him.  He would knock\nanybody down who touched his pockets.  It was plain that Roger did not\nchoose to be helped in any way; so Oliver soon ran off, and joined\nMildred, as he had promised.\n\n\"I do not like to leave him, all wet, and so tired that I could knock\nhim over with my little finger,\" exclaimed Oliver.  \"But he won't trust\nme about any thing.\"\n\n\"There is father again!  Tell him,\" cried Mildred.\n\nBoth children shouted that Roger was here, and pointed behind them; but\nit was plain that their father could not make out a word they said,\nthough they had never called out so loud in their lives.  Roger heard\nthem, however, as they judged by seeing him skulking among the trees\nbehind, watching what use they were making of his name.\n\nThe children thought their father was growing very anxious.  He still\nwaved his hat to them, now and then, when he looked their way; but they\nsaw him gazing abroad, as if surprised that the rush of waters did not\nabate.  They observed him glance often round the sky, as if for signs of\nwind; and they longed to know whether he thought a wind would do good or\nharm.  They saw him bring out, for the third time, a rope which he had\nseemed to think too short to be of any use; and this appeared to be the\ncase, now as at first.  Then he stooped down, as if to make a mark on\nthe side of the white door-post (for the water had by this time quite\nhidden the steps); and Oliver thought this was to make out, for certain,\nwhether the flood was regularly rising or not.  They could not imagine\nwhy he examined so closely as they saw him do the door lintel, and the\nwindow-frame.  It did not occur to them, as it did to him, that the mill\nmight break down under the force of the current.\n\nAt last it was clear that he saw Roger; and from that moment, he\nscarcely took his eyes from his children.  Oliver put his arm round\nMildred's neck, and said in her ear,--\n\n\"I know what father is watching us for.  He is afraid that Stephen is\nhere too, and no one to take care of us;--not even Ailwin.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Stephen is here,--in the wood,\" cried Mildred, in terror.  \"I\nwish this water would make haste and run away, and let us get home.\"\n\n\"It cannot run faster than it does.  Look how the waves dash along!\nThat is the worst of it:--it shows what a quantity there is, where this\ncame from.  But I don't believe Stephen is here.  I have a good mind to\nask Roger, and make him tell me.\"\n\n\"No, don't, Oliver!  Stephen may be drowned.  Do not put him in mind.\"\n\n\"Why, you see he does not care for anything.  He is teasing some live\nthing at this minute,--there, on the ground.\"\n\nOliver himself forgot everything but the live animals before his eyes,\nwhen he saw how many there were under the trees.  The grass was swarming\nwith mice, moles, and small snakes; while rabbits cocked up their little\nwhite tails, in all directions, and partridges flew out of every bush,\nand hares started from every hollow that the boy looked into.\n\n\"All soaked out of their holes;--don't know what to do with themselves;--\nfine sport for those that have a mind to it,\" said Roger, as he lay on\nthe ground, pulling back a little mouse by its long tail, as often as it\ntried to run away.\n\n\"You have no mind for sport to-day, I suppose, Roger.  I should not\nthink anybody has.\"\n\n\"I don't know;--I'm rarely hungry,\" said the boy.\n\n\"So were we; but we forgot it again.  Father is in the mill there...\"\n\n\"You need not tell me that.  Don't I see him?\"\n\n\"But we think he is looking out for Stephen.\"\n\n\"He won't find him,\" said Roger, in a very low voice; so low that Oliver\nwas not sure what he said.\n\n\"He is not here on the hill, then, Roger?\"\n\n\"On the hill,--no!  I don't know where he is, nor the woman either.  I\nsuppose they are drowned, as I was, nearly.  If they did not swim as I\ndid, they must be drowned: and they could hardly do that, as I had the\ndog.\"\n\nThe children looked at each other; and their looks told that they\nthought Roger was shocked and sorry, though he tried not to appear so.\n\n\"There might have been a boat, perhaps, out on the carr.  Don't you\nthink the country-people in the hills would get out boats when they saw\nthe flood spreading?\"\n\n\"Boats, no!  The hill-people have not above three boats among them all.\nThere are about three near the ponds; and they are like nut-shells.  How\nshould any boat live in such a flood as that?  Why, that flood would\nsweep a ship out to sea in a minute.  You need not think about boats, I\ncan tell you.\"\n\n\"But won't anybody send a boat for us?\" inquired Mildred, who had drawn\nnear to listen.  \"If they don't send a boat, and the flood goes on, what\nare we to do?  We can't live here, with nothing to eat, and no beds, and\nno shelter, if it should rain.\"\n\n\"Are you now beginning to cry about that?  Are you now beginning to find\nthat out, after all this time?\" said Roger, contemptuously.\n\n\"I thought we should get away,\" sobbed the little girl.  \"I thought a\nboat or something would come.\"\n\n\"A pretty silly thing you must be!\" exclaimed Roger.\n\n\"If she is silly, I am silly too,\" declared Oliver.  \"I am not sure that\nit is silly to look for a boat.  There are plenty out on the coast\nthere.\"\n\n\"They are all dashed to pieces long ago,\" decided Roger.  \"And they that\nlet in the flood will take good care you don't get out of it,--you, and\nyour outlanders.  It is all along of you that I am in this scrape.  But\nit was shameful of them not to give us notice;--it was too bad to catch\nus in the same trap with you.  If uncle is drowned, and I ever get out\nalive, I will be revenged on them.\"\n\nMildred stopped crying, as well as she could, to listen; but she felt\nlike Oliver when he said,--\n\n\"I don't know a word of what you mean.\"\n\n\"I dare say not.  You foreigners never know anything like other people.\"\n\n\"But won't you tell us?  Who made this flood?\"\n\n\"To be sure, you weren't meant to know this.  It would not have done to\nshow you the way out of the trap.  Why--the Parliament Committee at\nLincoln ordered the Snow-sewer sluice to be pulled up to-day, to drown\nthe king's lands, and get rid of his tenants.  It will be as good as a\nbattle gained to them.\"\n\nThe children were aghast at the wickedness of this deed.  They would not\nbelieve it.  It would have been tyrannical and cruel to have obliged the\nsettlers, who were not interested in a quarrel between the king of\nEngland and his people, to enlist, and be shot down in war.  They would\nhave complained of this as tyrannical and cruel.  But when they were\nliving in peace and quiet on their farms, paying their rents, and\ninclined to show good-will to everybody, to pull up the flood-gates, and\nlet in the sea and the rivers to drown them because they lived in the\nking's lands, was a cruelty too dreadful to be believed.  Oliver and\nMildred did not believe it.  They were sure their father would not\nbelieve it; and that their mother, if ever she should return to her home\nand family, would bring a very different account--that the whole\nmisfortune would turn out to be accidental.  So they felt assured: but\nthe fact was as Roger had said.  The Snow-sewer sluice had been pulled\nup, by the orders of the Committee of the Parliament, then sitting at\nLincoln: and it was done to destroy the king's new lands, and deprive\nhim of the support of his tenants.  The jealous country-people round\nhoped also that it would prevent foreigners from coming to live in\nEngland, however much they might want such a refuge.\n\nSome of the sufferers knew how their misfortune happened.  Others might\nbe thankful that they did not; for the thought of the malice of their\nenemies must have been more bitter than the fear of ruin and death.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. A HUNGRY DAY.\n\n\"We shall see what father does,\" was still the consolation with which\nOliver kept down his sister's fears.  He had such confidence in his\nfather's knowing what was best to be done on all occasions, that he felt\nthey had only to watch him, and imitate whatever he might attempt.  They\nremained quiet on the island now, hungry and tired as they were, because\nhe remained in the mill, and seemed to expect the water to subside.  The\nmost fearful thought was what they were to do after dark, if they should\nnot get home before that.  They supposed, at last, that their father was\nthinking of this too; for he began to move about, when the sun was near\nsetting, more than he had done all the afternoon.\n\nThey saw him go carefully down into the stream, and proceed cautiously\nfor some way--till the water was up to his chin.  Then he was buffeted\nabout so terribly that Mildred could not bear to look.  Both Oliver and\nRoger were sure, by what he ventured, and by the way he pulled himself\nback at last to the steps, that he had tied himself by the rope they had\nseen him measure.  It was certainly too short for any good purpose; for\nhe had to go back, having only wetted himself to the skin.  They saw\nthis by the yellow light from the west which shone upon the water.  In a\nfew minutes they could distinguish him no longer, though the mill stood\nup black against the sky, and in the midst of the gleaming flood.\n\n\"Father will be wet, and so cold all night!\" said Mildred, crying.\n\n\"If I could only swim,\" exclaimed Oliver, \"I would get over to him\nsomehow, and carry a rope from the house.  I am sure there must be a\nrope long enough somewhere about the yard.  If I could only swim, I\nwould get to him.\"\n\n\"That you wouldn't,\" said Roger.  \"Your father can swim; and why does\nnot he?  Because nobody could swim across that stream.  It is a torrent.\nIt would carry any stout man out over the carr; and you would be no\nbetter than a twig in the middle of it.\"\n\n\"I am afraid now this torrent will not slacken,\" said Oliver,\nthoughtfully.  \"I am afraid there is some hollow near which will keep up\nthe current.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"They say in Holland, where they have floods sometimes, that when water\nflows into a hollow, it gets out in a current, and keeps it up for some\nway.  Oh!  The quarry!\" he cried, with sudden recollection.  \"Mildred,\nlet us go, and look what is doing on that side before it is dark.\"\n\nThey ran round the hill; and there they saw indeed that the flood was\ntumbling in the quarry, like water boiling in a pot.  When it rushed\nout, it carried white earth with it, which made a long streak in the\nflood, and explained how it was that the stream between the house and\nthe mill was whiter and more muddy than that between their hill and the\nhouse.  At once it occurred to Roger that the stream between the hill\nand the house was probably less rapid than the other; and he said so.\nOliver ran back; and so did Mildred, pleased at the bare idea of getting\nto the house.\n\nOnce more arrived opposite the house, they saw a strange sight.  The\nmill no longer stood in its right place.  It had moved a good way down\ntowards the carr.  Not only that, but it was still moving.  It was\nsailing away like a ship.  After the first exclamation, even Roger stood\nas still as death to watch it.  He neither moved nor spoke till the mill\nwas out of sight in the dusk.  When Mildred burst into a loud cry, and\nOliver threw himself down, hiding his face on the ground, Roger spoke\nagain.\n\n\"Be quiet--you must,\" he said, decidedly, to the little girl.  \"We must\nbestir ourselves now, instead of stopping to see what other folks will\ndo.\"\n\n\"Oh, father!  Father will be drowned!\" cried they.\n\n\"You don't know that.  If he drifts out to the Humber, which is likely,\nby the way he is going, some ship may pick him up--or he may light upon\nsome high ground.  We can't settle that now, however; and the clear\nthing is that he wouldn't wish us to starve, whether he drowns or not.\nCome, get up, lad!\" said he, stirring Oliver with his foot.\n\n\"Don't lie there, Oliver; do get up!\" begged Mildred.\n\nOliver rose, and did all that Roger bade him.\n\n\"You say there is a long rope somewhere about the house,\" said Roger.\n\"Where is it?\"\n\n\"There is one in the cow-shed, I know.\"\n\n\"And if I cannot get there, is there one in the house?\"\n\n\"In the lumber-room,\" said Mildred.  \"The spare bed is tied round and\nround with a long rope--I don't know how long.\"\n\n\"I wish we had set about it an hour ago,\" muttered Roger, \"instead of\nwaiting for dark.  A pretty set of fools we have been to lose the\ndaylight!  I say, lad, can you think of anyway of making a fire?  Here\nare sticks enough, if one could set them alight.\"\n\n\"To cook a supper?\" asked Mildred.\n\n\"No; I mean to sup within doors; only we must do some work first.\"\n\nOliver had a steel knife; but it was too dark to look for a flint, if\nany other plan than a fire would do.\n\n\"Well, don't plague any more about a fire,\" said Roger, \"but listen to\nme.  Can you climb a tree?  I'll be bound you can't: and now you'll die\nif you can't.\"\n\n\"I can,\" said Oliver; \"but what is Mildred to do?\"\n\n\"We'll see that afterwards.  Which of these trees stands nearest to the\nnearest of yon upper windows?\"\n\nOliver and Mildred pointed out a young ash, which now quite bent over\nthe water.\n\n\"That is not strong enough,\" said Roger, shaking the tree, and finding\nit loosened at the roots.  \"Show me a stouter one.\"\n\nA well-grown beech was the next nearest.  Roger pulled Oliver by the\narm, and made him stand directly under the tree, with his sister beside\nhim.  He desired them not to move from where they were, and to give a\nloud halloo together, or a shriek (or anything that might be heard\nfurthest)--about once in a minute for an hour to come, unless they\nshould hear a rope fall into the tree, or anywhere near them.  They were\nto watch for this rope, and use all their endeavours to catch it.  There\nwould be a weight at the end, which would make it easier to catch.\nOliver must tie this rope to the trunk of the tree, stretching it tight,\nwith all his strength, and then tying it so securely that no weight\nwould unfasten it.\n\n\"Mind you that,\" said Roger.  \"If you don't, you will be drowned, that's\nall.  Do as I tell you, and you'll see what you will see.\"\n\nRoger then whistled for his dog, snatched Oliver's black ribbon from\nabout his neck, and fastened it round the dog's neck, to hold by.  He\nthen showed the dog the house, and forced him into the water, himself\nfollowing, till the children could no longer see what became of them.\n\n\"What do you think he means?\" asked poor Mildred, shivering.\n\n\"I don't know exactly.  He cannot mean that we are to climb over by a\nrope.  I do not think I could do that; and I am sure you could not.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!  Let us stay here!  Stay with me under the trees, here,\nOliver.\"\n\n\"Why, it would be much more comfortable to be at home by the fire.  You\nare shivering now, already, as if it was winter: and the night will be\nvery long, with nothing to eat.\"\n\n\"But Roger is gone; and I don't like to be where he is,--he is such a\nrude boy!  How he snatched your ribbon, and pulled you about!  And he\ncalls you `lad,' when he might just as well say `Oliver.'\"\n\n\"We must not mind such things now, dear.  And we must get home, if he\ncan show us how.  Think how glad Ailwin and George will be: and I am\nsure father would wish it, and mother too.  You must not cry now,\nMildred; indeed you must not.  People must do what they can at such a\ntime as this.  Come, help me to shout.  Shriek as loud and as long as\never you can.\"\n\n\"I wish I might say my prayers,\" said Mildred, presently.\n\n\"Do, dear.  Kneel down here;--nobody sees us.  Let us ask God to save\nfather,--and us too, and George and Ailwin, if it pleases Him;--and\nRoger.\"\n\nThey kneeled down, and Oliver said aloud to God what was in his heart.\nIt was a great comfort to them both; for they knew that while no human\neye saw them in the starlight, under the tree, God heard their words,\nand understood their hearts.\n\n\"Now again!\" said Oliver, as they stood up.\n\nThey raised a cry about once a minute, as nearly as they could guess:\nand they had given as many as thirty shouts, and began to find it very\nhard work, before anything happened to show them that it was of any use.\nThen something struck the tree over their heads, and pattered down\namong the leaves, touching Oliver's head at last.  He felt about, and\ncaught the end of a rope, without having to climb the tree, to search\nfor it.  They set up a shout of a different kind now; for they really\nwere very glad.  This shout was answered by a gentle tug at the rope:\nbut Oliver held fast, determined not to let anything pull the precious\nline out of his hand.\n\n\"What have we here?\" said he, as he felt a parcel tied to the rope, a\nlittle way from the end.  He gave it to Mildred to untie and open; which\nshe did with some trouble, wishing the evening was not so dark.\n\nIt was a tinder-box.\n\n\"There now!\" said Oliver, \"we shall soon know what we are about.  Do you\nknow where the tree was cut down, the other day?\"\n\n\"Close by?  Yes.\"\n\n\"Well; bring a lapful of chips,--quick; and then any dry sticks you can\nfind.  We can get on twice as fast with a light; and then they will see\nfrom the house how we manage.\"\n\nIn a few minutes, there was a fire blazing near the tree.  The rope must\nhave come straight over from the house, without dipping once into the\nwater; for not only were the flint and steel safe, but the tinder\nwithin, and the cloth that the box was done up in, were quite dry.\n\n\"Roger is a clever fellow,--that is certain,\" said Oliver.  \"Now for\nfastening the rope.  Do you take care that the fire keeps up.  Don't\nspare for chips.  Keep a good fire till I have done.\"\n\nOliver gave all his strength to pulling the rope tight, and winding it\nround the trunk of the beech, just above a large knob in the stem.  It\nseemed to him that the rope stretched pretty evenly, as far as he could\nsee,--not slanting either up or down; so that the sill of the upper\nwindow must be about upon a level with the great knob in the\nbeech-trunk.  Oliver tied knot upon knot, till no more rope was left to\nknot.  It still hung too slack, if it was meant for a bridge.  He did\nnot think he could ever cross the water on a rope that would keep him\ndangling at every move: but he had pulled it tight with all his force,\nand he could do no more.  When he had tied the last knot, he and Mildred\nstood in front of the fire, and raised one more great shout, waving\ntheir arms--sure now of being seen as well as heard.\n\n\"Look!  Look!\" cried Oliver, \"it is moving;--the rope is not so slack!\nThey are tightening it.  How much tighter it is than I could pull it!\nThat must be Ailwin's strong arm,--together with Roger's.\"\n\n\"But still I never can creep across that way,\" declared Mildred.  \"I\nwish you would not try.  Oliver.  Do stay with me!\"\n\n\"I will not leave you, dear: but we do not know what they mean us to do\nyet.  There!  Now the rope is shaking!  We shall see something.  Do you\nsee anything coming?  Don't look at the flashing water.  Fix your eye on\nthe rope, with the light upon it.  What do you see?\"\n\n\"I see something like a basket,--like one of our clothes' baskets,--\ncoming along the line.\"\n\nIt was one of Mrs Linacre's clothes' baskets, which was slung upon the\nrope; and Roger was in it.  He did not stay a minute.  He threw to\nOliver a line which was fastened to the end of the basket, with which he\nmight pull it over, from the window to the tree, when emptied of Roger.\nHe was then to put Mildred into the basket, carefully keeping hold of\nthe line, in order to pull it back for himself when his sister should be\nsafely landed.  Ailwin held a line fastened to the other end of the\nbasket, with which to pull it the other way.\n\nOliver was overjoyed.  He said he had never seen anything so clever; and\nhe asked Mildred whether she could possibly be afraid of riding over in\nthis safe little carriage.  He told her how to help her passage by\npulling herself along the bridge-rope, as he called it, instead of\nhindering her progress by clinging to the rope as she sat in the basket.\nTaking care not to let go the line for a moment, he again examined the\nknots of the longer rope, and found they were all fast.  In a few\nminutes he began hauling in his line, and the empty basket came over\nvery easily.\n\n\"How shall I get in?\" asked Mildred, trembling.\n\n\"Here,\" said Oliver, stooping his back to her.  \"Climb upon my back.\nNow hold by the tree, and stand upon my shoulders.  Don't be afraid.\nYou are light enough.  Now, can't you step in?\"\n\nFeeling how much depended upon this, the little girl managed it.  She\ntumbled into the basket, took a lesson from Oliver how to help her own\npassage, and earnestly begged him to take care of his line, that nothing\nmight prevent his following her immediately.  Then came a great tug, and\nshe felt herself drawn back into the darkness.  She did not like it at\nall.  The water roared louder than ever as she hung over it; and the\nlight which was cast upon it from the fire showed how rapidly it was\nshooting beneath.  Then she saw Oliver go, and throw some more chips and\ntwigs on the fire; and she knew by that that he could see her no longer.\nShe worked as hard as she could, putting her hands one behind the other\nalong the rope: but her hands were weak, and her head was very dizzy.\nShe had had nothing to eat since breakfast, and was quite tired out.\n\nWhile still keeping her eyes upon Oliver, she felt a jerk.  The basket\nknocked against something; and it made her quite sick.  She immediately\nheard Ailwin's voice saying, \"'tis one of them, that's certain.  Well!\nIf I didn't think it was some vile conjuring trick, up to this very\nmoment!\"\n\nThe poor dizzy child felt a strong arm passed round her waist, and found\nherself carried near a fire in a room.  She faltered out, \"Ailwin, get\nsomething for Oliver to eat.  He will be here presently.\"\n\n\"That I will: and for you first.  You shall both have a drop of my\ncherry-brandy too.\"\n\nMildred said she had rather have a draught of milk; but Ailwin said\nthere was no milk.  She had not been able to reach the cow, to milk her.\nWhat had poor little George done, then?--He had had some that had been\nleft from the morning.  Ailwin added that she was very sorry,--she could\nnot tell how she came to be so forgetful; but she had never thought of\nnot being able to milk the cow in the afternoon, and had drunk up all\nthat George left of the milk; her regular dinner having been drowned in\nthe kitchen.  Neither had she remembered to bring anything eatable\nup-stairs with her when the flood drove her from the lower rooms.  The\nflour and grain were now all under water.  The vegetables were, no\ndoubt, swimming about in the cellar; and the meat would have been where\nthe flour was, at this moment, if Roger, who said he had no mind to be\nstarved, had not somehow fished up a joint of mutton.  This was now\nstewing over the fire; but it was little likely to be good; for besides\nthere being no vegetables, the salt was all melted, and the water was\nnone of the best.  Indeed, the water was so bad that it could not be\ndrunk alone: and again good Ailwin pressed a drop of her cherry-brandy.\nMildred, however, preferred a cup of the broth, which, poor as it was,\nwas all the better for the loaf--the only loaf of bread--being boiled in\nit.\n\nJust when Mildred thought she could stand at the window, and watch for\nOliver, Oliver came in at the window.  He was not too tired to have his\nwits about him, as Ailwin said;--wits, she added, that were worth more\nthan hers.  He had brought over some dry wood with him,--as much as the\nbasket would hold; thinking that the peat-stack was probably all afloat,\nand the wood-heap wetted through.  All were pleased at the prospect of\nkeeping up a fire during this strange night.  All agreed that the\nbridge-rope must be left as it was, while the flood lasted.  There were\nwild animals and birds enough on the Red-hill to last for food for a\nlong while; and there alone could they get fuel.\n\n\"You can't catch game without my dog,\" cried Roger, surlily, to Ailwin;\n\"and my dog shan't put his nose to the ground, if you don't feed him\nwell: and he shall be where I am,--mind you that.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he opened the door to admit the dog, which Ailwin had put\nout upon the stairs, for the sake of her pet hen and chicks which were\nall in the room.  The hen fluttered up to a beam below the ceiling, on\nthe appearance of the dog, and the chicks cluttered about, till Ailwin\nand Mildred caught them, and kept them in their laps.  They glanced\ntimidly at Roger, remembering the fate of the white hen, the day before.\nRoger did not heed them.  He had taken out his knife, forked up the\nmutton out of the kettle, and cut off the best half for himself and his\ndog.\n\nProbably Oliver was thinking that Roger deserved the best they could\ngive him, for his late services; for he said,--\n\n\"I am sure, Roger, Mildred and I shall never forget,--nor father and\nmother either, if ever they know, it,--what you have done for us\nto-night.  We might have died on the Red-hill but for you.\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" muttered Roger, as he sat, swinging his legs, with his open\nknife in his hand, and his mouth crammed,--\"Stuff!  As if I cared\nwhether you and she sink or swim!  I like sport that's all.\"\n\nNobody spoke.  Ailwin helped the children to the poor broth, and the\nremains of the meat, shaking her head when they begged her to take some.\nShe whispered a good deal to Oliver about cherry-brandy; but he replied\naloud that it looked and smelled very good; but that the only time he\nhad tasted it, it made him rather giddy; and he did not wish to be giddy\nto-night;--there was so much to think about; and he was not at all sure\nthat the flood had got to its height.  He said no more, though his mind\nwas full of his father.  Neither he nor Mildred could mention their\nfather to Ailwin to-night, even if Roger had been out of the way.\n\nRoger probably thought what Oliver did say very silly; for he sat\nlaughing as he heard it, and for some time after.  Half an hour later,\nwhen Ailwin passed near him, while she was laying down a bed for Oliver,\nso that they might be all together during this night of alarm, she\nthought there was a strong smell of brandy.  She flew to her bottle, and\nfound it empty,--not a drop left. Roger had drained it all.  His head\nsoon dropped upon his breast, and he fell from his chair in a drunken\nsleep.  Mildred shrank back from him in horror; but Ailwin and Oliver\nrolled him into a corner of the room, where his dog lay down beside him.\n\nAilwin could not refrain from giving him a kick, while he lay thus\npowerless, and sneering in his face because he could not see her.\n\n\"Don't, Ailwin,--don't!\" said Oliver.  \"Mildred and I should not have\nbeen here now but for him.\"\n\n\"And I should not have been terrified out of my wits, for these two\nhours past, nor have lost my cherry-brandy, but for him.  Mercy!  I\nshall never forget his popping up his face at that window, and sending\nhis dog in before him.  I was as sure as death that the flood was all of\ntheir making, and that they were come for me, after having carried off\nmy master, and as I thought, you two.\"\n\n\"Why, Ailwin, what nonsense!\" cried Mildred from her bed,--trembling all\nover as she spoke.  \"How could a boy make a flood?\"\n\n\"And you see what he has done, instead of carrying us off,\" observed\nOliver.\n\n\"Well, it is almost worth my cherry-brandy to see him lie so,--dead\ndrunk,--only it would be better still to see him really dead.--Well,\nthat may be a wicked thing to say; but it is not so wicked as some\nthings he has done;--and I am so mortally afraid of him!\"\n\n\"I wish you would say your prayers, Ailwin, instead of saying such\nthings: and then, perhaps, you would find yourself not afraid of\nanybody.\"\n\n\"Well, that is almost as good as if the pastor had preached it.  I will\njust hang up the chicks in the hand-basket, for fear of the dog; and\nthen we will say our prayers, and go to sleep, please God.  I am sure we\nall want it.\"\n\nOliver chose to examine first how high the water stood in the lower\nrooms.  He lighted a piece of wood, and found that only two steps of the\nlower flight of stairs remained dry.  Ailwin protested so earnestly that\nthe waters had not risen for two or three hours, that he thought they\nmight all lie down to sleep.  Ailwin and he were the only ones who could\nkeep watch.  He did not think Ailwin's watching would be worth much; he\nwas so tired that he did not think he could keep awake; and he felt that\nhe should be much more fit for all the business that lay before him for\nthe next day, if he could get a good rest now.  So he kissed little\nGeorge, as he lay down beside him, and was soon as sound asleep as all\nhis companions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. SUNRISE OVER THE LEVELS.\n\nAll the party slept for some hours, as quietly and unconsciously as\nlittle George himself.  If the children were so weary that the dreadful\nuncertainty about their father's fate could not keep them awake, it is\nprobable that a knowledge of their own danger might have failed to\ndisturb them.  But they had little more idea than George himself of the\nextent of the peril they were in.  They did not know that the Levels\nwere surrounded by hills on every side but towards the sea; or, if they\nknew, they did not consider this, because the hills were a great way\noff.  But, whether they were far or near, this circle of hills was the\ncause of the waters rising to a great height in the Levels, when once\nthe defences that had kept out the sea and the rivers were broken down.\nAs the hills prevented the overflowing waters from running off on three\nsides, it was clear that the waters must rise to the level of the sea\nand the rivers from which they flowed in.  They had not reached this\nheight when the children lay down to rest, though Ailwin was so sure\nthat the worst was over; and the danger increased as they slept; slept\ntoo soundly even to dream of accidents.\n\nThe first disturbance was from the child.  Oliver became aware, through\nhis sleep, that little George was moving about and laughing.  Oliver\nmurmured, \"Be quiet, George.  Lie still, dear,\" and the child was quiet\nfor a minute.  Presently, however, he moved again, and something like a\ndabbling in water was heard, while, at the same moment, Oliver found his\nfeet cold.  He roused himself with a start, felt that his bed was wet,\nand turning out, was up to the ankles in water.  By the light of the\nembers, he saw that the floor was a pond, with some shoes floating on\nit.  His call woke Ailwin and Mildred at once.  Roger did not stir,\nthough there was a good deal of bustle and noise.\n\nMildred's bed was so high above the floor as to be still quite dry.\nOliver told her to stay there till he should settle what was to be done\nnext: and he took up the child to put him with Mildred, asking her to\nstrip off his drenched clothes, and keep him warm.  All the apparel that\nhad been taken off was luckily on the top of a chest, far above the\nwater.  Oliver handed this to his sister, bidding her dress herself, as\nwell as the child.  He then carefully put the fire together, to make as\nmuch light as possible, and then told Ailwin that they must bestir\nthemselves, as the fire would presently be drowned out.\n\nAilwin was quite ready to bestir herself; but she had no idea beyond\nmounting on chests, chairs, and drawers; unless, indeed, she thought of\nthe beam which crossed the ceiling, to which she was seen to cast her\neyes, as if envying the chicks which hung there, or the hen which still\nslept, with her head beneath her wing, out of present reach of the\nflood.\n\nOliver disapproved of the plan of mounting on the furniture of the room.\nIt might be all very well, he said, if there were nothing better to be\ndone.  But, by the time the water would reach the top of the chests, it\nwould be impossible to get out by the door.  He thought it would be\nwisest to reach the roof of the house while they could, and to carry\nwith them all the comforts they could collect, while they might be\nremoved in a dry condition.  Ailwin agreed, and was going to throw open\nthe door, when Oliver stopped her hand.\n\n\"Why, Oliver,\" she cried, \"you won't let one do anything; and you say,\nall the time, that there is not a minute to be lost.\"\n\nOliver showed her that water was streaming in at the sides of the door,\na good way higher up than it stood on the floor.  He said that the door\nwas a defence at present,--that the water was higher on the stairs than\nin the room, and that there would be a great rush as soon as the door\nshould be opened.  He wished, therefore, that the bedding, and the\nclothes from the drawers, and all else that they could remove to the top\nof the house, should be bundled up, and placed on the highest chest of\ndrawers, before the water should be let in.  They must borrow the line\nfrom the clothes' basket, to tie round George's waist, that they might\nnot lose him in the confusion.  One other thing must be done: they must\nrouse Roger, or he might be drowned.\n\nAilwin was anxious that this last piece of duty should be omitted:--not\nthat she exactly wished that Roger should be drowned,--at least, not\nthrough her means; but she, ignorant as she was,--had a superstitious\nfeeling that Roger and his family had caused this flood, and that he\ncould save himself well enough, though he appeared to be sunk in a\ndrunken sleep.  She indulged Oliver, however, so far as to help him to\nseize the lad, neck and heels, and lay him, dripping as he was, upon the\ntable.\n\nBefore the bedding and clothes were all tied up, the door of the room\nshook so as to threaten to burst in, from the latch giving way.  It\nstruck everybody that the person who should open it would run the risk\nof being suffocated, or terribly knocked about; and yet, it was hardly\nwise to wait for its bursting.  Oliver, therefore, tied a string to the\nknob of the bolt, then slipped the bolt, to keep the door fastened while\nhe lifted and tied up the latch.  The door shook more and more; so,\nhaving set the window wide open, he made haste to scramble up to where\nMildred was, wound the cord which was about George's waist round his own\narm, bade Mildred hold the child fast, and gave notice that he was going\nto open the door.  It was a strange party, as the boy could not help\nnoting at the moment,--the maid standing on the bed, hugging the\nbed-post, and staring with frightened eyes; Roger snoring on the table,\njust under the sleeping hen on the beam; and the three children perched\non the top of a high chest of drawers.  George took it all for play,--\nthe new sash he had on and the bolting the door, and the climbing and\nscrambling.  He laughed and kicked, so that his sister could scarcely\nhold him.  \"Now for it!\" cried Oliver.\n\n\"Oh, Oliver, stop a minute!\" cried Ailwin.  \"Don't be in such a hurry to\ndrown us all, Oliver.  Stop a moment, Oliver.\"\n\nOliver knew, however, that the way to drown them all was to stop.  At\nthe first pull the bolt gave way, the door burst open, as if it would\nbreak from its hinges, and a great body of water dashed in.  The first\nthing the wave did was to wash Roger off the table; the next, to put out\nthe fire with a fizz,--so that there was no other light but the dawn,\nnow advancing.  The waters next dashed up against the wall opposite the\ndoor; and then by the rebound, with less force, against the drawers on\nwhich the children sat.  It then leaped out of the window, leaving a\ntroubled surface at about half the height of the room.  Above the noise,\nAilwin was heard lamenting, the chicks cluttering, the hen fluttering,\nand George laughing and clapping his hands.\n\n\"You have George safe?\" said Oliver.  \"Very well!  I believe we can all\nget out.  There is Roger's head above water; and I don't think it is\nmore than up to my neck; though everybody laughs at me for being a short\nboy.\"\n\nHe stepped down upon a chair, and then cautiously into the water.  It\nwas very nearly up to his chin.\n\n\"That will do,\" said he, cheerfully.  \"Now, Ailwin, you are the\ntallest;--please carry George out on the roof of the house, and stay\nthere with him till I come.\"\n\nAilwin made many lamentations at having to step down into the water; but\nshe took good care of the child, carrying him quite high and dry.\nOliver followed, to see that he was tied securely to the balustrade on\nthe roof.  While he was doing this, Ailwin brought Mildred in the same\nway.  Mildred wanted to be of use below; but her brother told her the\nbest thing she could do was to watch and amuse George, and to stand\nready to receive the things saved from the chambers,--she not being tall\nenough to do any service in four feet of water.\n\nIt was a strange forlorn feeling to Mildred,--the being left on the\nhouse-top in the cold grey morning, at an hour when she had always\nhitherto been asleep in bed.  The world itself, as she looked round her,\nseemed unlike the one she had hitherto lived in.  The stars were in the\nsky; but they were dim,--fading before the light of morning.  There were\nno fields, no gardens, no roads to be seen;--only grey water, far away\non every side.  She could see nothing beyond this grey water, except\ntowards the east, where a line of low hills stood between her and the\nbrightening sky.  Poor Mildred felt dizzy, with so much moving water\nbefore her eyes, and in her ears the sound of the current below.  The\nhouse shook and trembled, too, under the force of the flood: so that she\nwas glad to fix her sight on the steady line of the distant hills.  She\nspoke to George occasionally, to keep him quiet; and she was ready to\nreceive every article that was handed up the stairs from below: but, in\nall the intervals, she fixed her eyes on the distant hills.  She thought\nhow easy it would be to reach that ridge, if she were a bird; and how\nhard it would be to pine away on this house-top, or to sink to death in\nthese waters, for want of the wings which inferior creatures had.  Then\nshe thought of superior creatures that had wings too: and she longed to\nbe an angel.  She longed to be out of all this trouble and fear; and\nconsidered that it would be worth while to be drowned, to be as free as\na bird or an angel.  She resolved to remember this, and not to be\nfrightened, if the water should rise and rise, till it should sweep her\nquite away.  She thought that this might have befallen her mother\nyesterday.  No boat had been seen on the waters in the direction of\nGainsborough; no sign had reached the family that any one was thinking\nof them at a distance, and trying to save them: and Oliver and Mildred\nhad agreed that it was likely that Mrs Linacre had heard some report of\nthe pulling up of the sluices, and might have been on her way home when\nthe flood overtook and drowned her.  If so, she might be now an angel.\nIf an angel, Mildred was sure her first thought would be, as it had ever\nbeen, of her home and her children; and the little girl looked up to see\nwhether there was anything like the shadow of wings between her and the\ndim stars.  She saw nothing; but still, in some kind of hope, she softly\nbreathed the words, \"O, mother!  Mother!\"\n\n\"Mother!  Mother!\" shouted little George, as he overheard her.  Oliver\nleaped up the stairs, and inquired whether there was a boat,--whether\nmother was coming.\n\n\"No, Oliver, no.  I was only thinking about mother; and so, I suppose,\nwas George.  I am afraid you are disappointed;--I am sorry.\"\n\nOliver bit his lip to prevent crying, and could not speak directly; but\nseemed to be gazing carefully all around the waste.  He said, at last,\nthat he had many times thought that his mother might come in a boat: and\nhe thought she might still, unless...\n\n\"Unless she should be an angel now,\" whispered Mildred,--\"unless she\ndied yesterday; and then she might be with us now, at this very moment,\nthough we cannot see her;--might not she?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe so, dear.  And, for one thing, I almost wish she may not\ncome in a boat.  Who should tell her that father was carried away into\nall those waters, without having spoken one word to us?\"\n\n\"If they are both dead, do you not think they are together now?\" asked\nMildred.\n\n\"Certainly.  Pastor Dendel says that all who love one another well\nenough will live together, where they will never die any more.\"\n\n\"And I am sure they did,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"If they see us now,\" said Oliver, \"it must make a great difference to\nthem whether we are frightened and miserable, or whether we behave as we\nought to do.  Let us try not to be frightened, for their sakes, dear.\"\n\n\"And if they are not with us all the while, God is,\" whispered Mildred.\n\n\"O, yes; but God knows ...  God will not expect...\"\n\n\"Surely He will feel in some way as they do about us,\" said Mildred,\nremembering and repeating the verse Pastor Dendel had taught her.\n\"`Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that\nfear him.'\"\n\n\"`For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.'\"  So\nOliver continued the psalm.\n\n\"There comes the sun!\" exclaimed Mildred, happy to greet some one\nfamiliar object amidst this strange scene.\n\nThe scene hardly appeared the same when the sun, after first peeping\nabove the hills like a golden star, flamed up to its full size, and cast\na broad glittering light over the wide waters, and into the very eyes of\nthe children.  They felt the warmth too, immediately; and it was very\ncheering.  The eastern hills now almost disappeared in the sun's blaze;\nand those to the west shone very clearly; and the southern ridge near\nGainsborough, looked really but a little way off.  The children knew,\nhowever, that there were three full miles between them and any land,\nexcept their Red-hill, and a few hillocks which peeped above the flood\nin the Levels: and there was no sign of a boat, far or near.  Oliver\nchecked a sigh, when he had convinced himself of this; and began to look\nwhat had become of the people they knew in the Levels.\n\nNeighbour Gool's dwelling stood low; and nothing was now to be seen of\nit but a dark speck, which might be the top of a chimney.  It was\npossible that the whole family might have escaped; for Gool and his wife\nwere to be at Haxey yesterday; and they might there hear of the mischief\nintended or done to the sluices, in time to save the rest of the\nhousehold.  Some of the roofs of the hamlet of Sandtoft stood above the\nwaters; and the whole upper part of the chapel used by the foreigners;\nand many might easily have found a refuge there.  Further off, a\nconspicuous object was the elegant crocketed spire of one of the\nbeautiful Lincolnshire churches, standing high, as if inviting those who\nwere dismayed to come and save themselves in the air from the dangers of\nthe waters.  Oliver wondered whether any sufferers were now watching the\nsunrise from the long ridge of the church-roof, or from the windows of\nthe spire.\n\nOne of the most curious sights was the fleets of haystacks that were\nsailing along in the courses of the currents.  As the smaller stacks\nwere sometimes shot forward rapidly, and whirled round by an eddy, while\na large stately stack followed forwards, performing the same turns of\nthe voyage, Mildred compared them to a duck and her ducklings in the\npond, and Oliver to a great ship voyaging with a fleet of small craft.\nThey saw sights far more sorrowful than this.  They grieved over the\nfine large trees--some in full leaf--that they saw tumbling about in the\ntorrents which cut through the stiller waters; but it was yet worse to\nsee dead cows, horses, pigs, and sheep carried past--some directly\nthrough the garden, or over the spot where the mill had stood.  There\nwere also thatched roofs carried away entire; and many a chest, chair,\nand cow-rack--showing the destruction that had gone on during the night.\nWhile the distant scene was all bright and lovely in the sunrise, these\nnearer objects, thickly strewn in the muddy waters, were ugly and\ndismal; and Oliver saw that it did him and his sister no good to watch\nthem.  He started, and said they must not be idle any longer.\n\nJust then Ailwin called from the stairs,--\n\n\"I say, Oliver, the cow is alive.  I heard her low, I'm certain.\"\n\n\"I am afraid it was only George,\" said Mildred.  \"He was lowing like the\ncow, a minute ago.\"\n\n\"That might be because he heard the real cow,\" cried Oliver, with new\nhope.  \"I had rather save the cow than anything.  I will see if I cannot\nget into one of the upper rooms that looks towards the yard.  We might\nhave a bridge-rope from more windows than one.  Where is Roger?  What is\nhe fit for?  Is he awake?\"\n\n\"Awake!  Yes, indeed,\" whispered Ailwin, coming close up to the\nchildren.  \"There is more mischief about that boy than you think for.\nHe is now on the stairs, with more mice, and rats, and spiders, and\ncreeping things about him than I ever saw before in all my days.  We are\nlike to be devoured as we stand on our feet; to say nothing of what is\nto become of us if we lie down.\"\n\nMildred looked at her brother in great terror.\n\n\"We must get rid of them, if they really do us hurt,\" said Oliver,\ndecidedly, though with an anxious look.  \"We must drown them, if they\nare mischievous.  We can do that, you know--at least with the larger\nthings.  They cannot get away from us.\"\n\n\"Drown away!\" said Ailwin, mysteriously.  \"Drown away!  The more you\ndrown the more will come up.  Why, did you never hear of the plagues of\nEgypt?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure.  What then?\"\n\n\"I take this to be a plague of Egypt that that boy has brought upon us.\nIt is his doing; and you will see that, if you will just look down from\nwhere I stand, and watch him making friends with them all.\"\n\nMildred's eyes were on her brother's face as he stood where Ailwin\ndesired him, watching Roger.  After looking very thoughtful for some\nmoments, he turned and exclaimed,--\n\n\"There is not one word of sense in it all, Mildred.  There is a\nwonderful number of live things there, to be sure; and here, too, all\nover the roof--if you look.  But Roger is not making friends with them.\nHe is teasing them--hurting all he can get hold of.  I think the\ncreatures have come up here because the water has driven them out of\ntheir holes; and that there would have been quite as many if Roger had\nbeen drowned in the carr.  They have nothing to do with Roger, or the\nplagues of Egypt, Mildred.  Don't believe a word of it.\"\n\n\"Then I wish Ailwin would not say such things,\" replied Mildred.\n\nAilwin persisted that time would show what Roger was--to which they all\nagreed.  Oliver observed that meanwhile Ailwin, who was the oldest\nperson among them, should not try to frighten a little girl, who was the\nyoungest of all, except George.  Ailwin said she should keep her own\nthoughts; though, to be sure, she need not always say what they were to\neverybody.\n\n\"About this cow,\" thought Oliver, aloud.  \"We must plan some way to feed\nher.\"\n\n\"Take care!\" exclaimed Mildred, as he began to descend the stairs.  But\nthe words were scarcely out of her mouth when her brother called to her\nthat the water had sunk.  She ran to see, and saw, with her own eyes,\nthat the water did not quite come up to the wet mark it had left on the\nwall of the stairs.  Ailwin thought but little of it--it was such a\ntrifle; and Oliver allowed that it might be a mere accident, arising\nfrom the flood having found some new vent about the house; but still,\nthe water had sunk; and that was a sight full of hope.\n\n\"Have you heard the cow low, Roger?\" asked Oliver.\n\n\"Yes, to be sure.  She may well low; for she must be hungry enough.\"\n\n\"And wet and cold enough, too, poor thing!  I am going to see whether, I\ncan find out exactly where she is, and whether we cannot do something\nfor her.\"\n\nAilwin called down-stairs to Oliver, to say that there was a washtub\nfloating about in the room they had slept in.  If he could find it, he\nmight row himself about in that, in the chambers, instead of always\nwading in the water, catching his death of cold.\n\nOliver took the hint, and presently appeared in the tub, rowing himself\nwith a slip of the wood he had brought over from the Red-hill.  Roger\nstared at him as he rowed himself out of one chamber, and opened the\ndoor of another, entering it in fine style.  Roger presently followed to\nsee what was doing, and perhaps to try how he liked a voyage in a tub in\na large chamber.\n\n\"I see her,\" cried Oliver, from the window.  \"I see poor cow's head, and\nthe ridge of her back above water.\"\n\nRoger came splashing to the window to look, and jumped into the tub,\nmaking it sink a good deal; but it held both the boys very well.  Roger\nthought the cow very stupid that she did not get upon the great dunghill\nbehind her, which would keep her whole body out of the water.  Oliver\nthought that, as the dunghill was behind her, she could not see it.  He\nwished he could go, and put her in mind of it.  He thought he would try\nto cross in the tub, if he could so connect it with the window as that\nit might be drawn back, in case of his being unable to pass the little\ncurrent that there was between the house and the ruins of the\nyard-buildings--of which little remained.\n\n\"I'll go, too,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Either you will go, or I,\" said Oliver.  \"One must stay to manage the\nrope, in case of the tub upsetting.  You had better let me go, Roger,\nbecause poor cow knows me.\"\n\nRoger, however, chose to go.  Oliver asked him whether he could milk a\ncow; because some milk must be got for George, if possible.  He said,\nvery gravely, that his poor little brother would die, he thought, if\nthey could not get milk for him.\n\nRoger laughed at the doubt whether he could milk cows.  He did it every\nday of his life, when fishing and fowling, with his uncle, in the carr.\nOliver now guessed how it was that the milk of their good cow had\nsometimes unaccountably run short.  Ailwin had observed that this never\nhappened but when the Redfurns were in the neighbourhood; and she had\nalways insisted upon it that they had bewitched the cow.  Oliver knew\nthat she would say so now.  He said so much, and said it so seriously,\nabout the necessity of milk for little George, that he thought not even\na Redfurn could have the heart to drink up all the milk.  He gave Roger\na brown pitcher for the milk, and helped, very cleverly, to fasten the\ncord to the tub.  They passed the cord through the back of a heavy\nold-fashioned chair that stood in the room, lest any sudden pull should\nthrow Oliver out of the window; he then established himself on the\nwindow-sill, above the water, to manage his line, and watch what Roger\nwould do.\n\nRoger pulled very skilfully;--much more so, from his strength and from\npractice, than Oliver could have done.  He avoided logs of wood, trees,\nand other heavy things that floated past; and this was nearly all he did\ntill the line had quite run out, so that he could not be carried any\nfurther down.  Then he began diligently working his way up towards the\ncow.  He had got half-way to his object, when he paused a moment, and\nthen changed his course--to Oliver's surprise; for the thing which\nappeared to have attracted his attention was a small copper boiler.\nPlenty of such things swept past before, and nobody had thought of\nwanting them.  It was plain, however, that Roger had a fancy for this\nparticular copper boiler; for he carefully waylaid it, and arrested it\nwith his paddle.  Oliver then saw that some live animal leaped from the\nboiler into the tub.  He saw Roger seize the boiler, and take it into\nthe tub; catch up the animal, whatever it might be, and nurse it in his\narms; and then take something out of his pocket, and stoop down.  Oliver\nwas pretty sure he was killing something with his knife.\n\nWhatever Roger was doing he had soon done.  By this time he had again\nbeen carried down as far as the line would allow; and the additional\nweight he had now on board his tub made it harder work for him to paddle\nup again.  He did it, however, and brought his odd little boat into\nstill water, between the dunghill and the cow.  After looking about him\nfor a while, he threw out the boiler and the pitcher upon the dunghill,\nseized a pitchfork which was stuck upright in it, and, his craft being\nthus lightened, made for the ruins of the cart shed and stable.\n\nOf these buildings there remained only wrecks of the walls, and a few\nbeams and rafters standing up in the air, or lying across each other,\nwithout any thatch to cover them.  Something must be left inside,\nhowever; for Roger was busy with his pitchfork.  This something must be\nvaluable, too; for Roger, after carefully feeling the depth, jumped out\nof the tub, and went on filling it, while he stood in the water.  Oliver\nthought this very daring, till, glancing at the cow, he was sure he saw\nmore of her neck and back; and examining the wall of the house, he\nperceived that the flood had sunk some inches since Roger began to\ncross.\n\nWhen the tub was heaped up with what looked like wet straw, Roger pushed\nit before him towards the cow, carefully feeling his way, but never\nsinking so much as to have the water above his shoulders.\n\n\"Capital!  Now that is clever!\" said Oliver, aloud, as he sat at the\nwindow, and saw what Roger was about.  \"He is going to lift her up out\nof the water.  How she struggles to help herself!  She knows there is\nsomebody caring for her; and she will do what she can for herself.\"\n\nThis was true.  Roger thrust the straw he had brought under the cow,\nwith his pitchfork.  He had to bring three loads before she could raise\nher whole body; but then she stood, poor thing!  With only her trembling\nlegs in the water.  Roger turned her head so that she saw the dunghill\njust behind her, and with some encouragement, made one more vigorous\nscramble to reach it.  She succeeded; and Roger whipped up the pitcher,\nand was certainly trying to milk her.  She could not, however, be\nprevented from lying down.  Oliver was more angry than he had almost\never been in his life, when he saw Roger kick her repeatedly, in\ndifferent parts of her body, pull her by the tail, and haul up her head\nwith a rope he had found in the stable.  The poor cow never attempted to\nrise; and it was clear that she wanted comfort, and not ill-usage.\nOliver determined that, when Roger came back, he would not speak a word\nto him.\n\nRoger set about returning presently, when he found that nothing could be\ngot from the cow.  He took his boiler on board, and pulled himself in by\nthe line, without troubling himself to paddle.\n\nWhen he came in at the window, he threw down the pitcher, swearing at\nhimself for the trouble he had taken about a good-for-nothing beast that\nhad been standing starving in the water till she had not a drop of milk\nto give.  He looked at Oliver, as if rather surprised that he did not\nspeak; but Oliver took no notice of him.\n\nIt was a hare that Roger had in his boiler,--a hare that had, no doubt,\nleaped into the boiler when pressed by a still more urgent danger than\nsailing down the stream in such a boat.  Roger had cut her throat with\nhis pocket-knife; and there she lay in her own blood.\n\n\"Don't you touch that,\" said Roger, as he landed his booty upon the\nwindow-sill.  \"If you lay a finger on that, it will be the worse for\nyou.  They are mine--both puss and the boiler.\"\n\nStill Oliver did not speak.  He wondered what Roger meant to do with\nthese things, if nobody else was to touch them.\n\nRoger soon made it clear what his intentions were.  He whistled to his\ndog, which scampered down-stairs to him from the top of the house; put\ndog, puss, and boiler into the clothes' basket, and pulled himself over\nwith them to the Red-hill, taking care to carry the tinder-box with him.\nThere he made a fire, skinned and cooked his hare, and, with his dog,\nmade a feast of it, under a tree.\n\nNobody grudged him his feast; though the children were sorry to find\nthat any one could be so selfish.  Ailwin was glad to be rid of him, on\nany terms; and, as soon as Oliver was sure that he was occupied for some\ntime to come, so that he would not be returning to make mischief, he\nresolved to go over to the cow, and give her something better than\nkicks;--food, if, as he thought, he could procure some.  Saying nothing\nto any one, he tied the tub-line to a bed-post, as being more\ntrustworthy still than the heavy chair, and carried with him the great\nknife that the meat had been cut with the evening before.  He made for\nthe stable first, and joined the rope he knew to be there to his line,\nso as to make it twice the length it was before.  He could now reach the\nfield behind the stable, where the corn, just turning from green to\nyellow, had been standing high at this hour yesterday.  He had to paddle\nvery carefully here, lest his tub should be knocked to pieces against\nthe stone wall.  But the wall, though not altogether thrown down, had so\nmany breaches made in it, that he found himself in the field, without\nexactly knowing whether he had come through the gate-posts or through\nthe wall.  He lost no time in digging with his paddle; and, as he had\nhoped, he turned up ears of corn from under the water, which he could\ncatch hold of, a handful at a time, and cut off with his knife.  It was\nvery tiresome, slow work; and sometimes he was near losing his paddle,\nand sometimes his knife.  He persevered, however: now resting for a\nminute or two, and then eating a few of the ears, and thinking that only\nvery hungry people could swallow them, soaked as they were with bad\nwater.  He ate more than he would have done, remembering that the more\nhe took now, the less he should want of the portion he meant to carry to\nthe house, when he should have fed the cow.  He hoped they should obtain\nsome better food; but, if no flour was to be had, and no other vegetable\nthan this, it would be better than none.\n\nWhen he reached the cow, she devoured the heads of corn ravenously.  She\ncould not have appeared better satisfied with the sweetest spring grass.\nIt was a pleasure to see her eyes as she lay, receiving her food from\nOliver's hand.  He emptied out all he had brought beside her, and patted\nher, saying he hoped she would give George some milk in the afternoon,\nin return for what had been done for her now.\n\nOliver felt so tired and weak when he got home with his tub half full of\nsoaked corn ears, that he felt as if he could not do anything more.  He\nwas very near crying when he found that there was not a morsel to eat;\nthat the very water was too bad to drink; and that there was no fire,\nfrom Roger having carried off the tinder-box.  But George was crying\nwith hunger; and that made Oliver ashamed to do the same, and put him\nupon thinking what was to be done next.\n\nAilwin was the only person who, being as strong as Roger could have got\nanything from him by force; and there was no use in asking Ailwin to\ncross the bridge-rope, or to do anything which would bring her nearer to\nthe boy she feared so much.  Besides that, Roger had carried over the\nclothes' basket without leaving any line to pull it back by.  Oliver\nfelt that he (if he were only a little less hungry and tired) could make\nthe trip in a sack, or a tub, or even a kettle; but a tall woman like\nAilwin could cross in nothing smaller than the missing clothes' basket.\nIt was clear that Oliver alone could go; and that he must go for the\ntinder-box before any comfort was to be had.\n\nHe made up his mind to this, therefore; and having, with Ailwin's help,\nslung the useful tub upon the bridge-rope, so that he might start the\nfirst moment that Roger should be out of sight or asleep, he rested\nhimself in the window, watching what passed on the Red-hill.  He\nobserved that Roger seemed quite secure that no one could follow him, as\nhe had carried off the basket.  There he lay, near the fire, eating the\nmeat he had broiled, and playing with his dog.  It seemed to the hungry\nwatchers as if he meant to lie there all day.  After awhile, however, he\nrose, and sauntered towards the trees, among which he disappeared, as if\ngoing to the other side of the hill, to play, or to set his dog upon\ngame.\n\nOliver was off, sliding along the bridge-rope in his tub.  He did not\nforget to carry the line with which to bring back the basket.  It seemed\nto him that Roger intended to live by himself on the Red-hill; and to\nthis none of the party had any objection.  He had swum over to the house\nonce, when the stream was higher and more rapid than now; and he could\ncome again, if he found himself really in want of anything; so that\nnobody need be anxious for him.  Meantime, no one at the house desired\nhis company.  Oliver therefore took with him a blanket and a rug, and a\nknife and fork for his accommodation.\n\nHe alighted under the beech without difficulty, and laid down the\narticles he brought under the tree, where Roger would be sure to see\nthem.  He took the flint and the tinder from the tinder-box, and\npocketed them, leaving the steel and the box for Roger's use, as there\nwere knives at home, and Roger might perhaps find a flint on the hill.\nThere were plenty in the quarry.  Oliver knew he must be quick; but he\ncould not help looking round for something to eat,--some one of the many\nanimals and birds that he knew to be on the hill, and heard moving about\nhim on every side.  But he had no means of catching any.  The bones of\nthe hare were lying about, picked quite clean by the dog; but not a\nmorsel of meat was left in sight.\n\nSomething very precious, however, caught Oliver's eye;--a great heap of\npebbly gravel thrown up by the flood.  The water in the Levels was\nusually so bad that the settlers had to filter it; and Oliver knew that\nno water was purer than that which had been filtered through gravel.  He\nbelieved now that poor George could have a good drink of water, at\nleast; and he scooped up with his hands enough gravel to half fill the\ntub.  It took a long time to heap up as much as he could carry upon the\nrug; and then it was hard work to empty it into the tub; and he fancied\nevery moment that he heard Roger coming.  It was a pity he did not know\nthat Roger had fallen fast asleep in the sun, on the other side of the\nhill; and that his dog lay winking beside him, not thinking of stirring.\n\nOne thing more must be had;--chips for fuel.  When Oliver had got enough\nof these, and of sticks too, he found courage and strength to stay a few\nminutes more, to make up such a fire for Roger as would probably last\ntill after he should have discovered the loss of the flint, and so\nprevent his being without fire till he could find another flint.  In\norder to give him a broad hint, Oliver spread out the blanket on the\nground, and set the tinder-box in the middle of it, where it would be\nsure to invite attention.  He then climbed into the tub, and was glad to\nbe off, drawing the basket with the fire-wood after him.\n\n\"Here, Ailwin,\" said he, faintly, as he reached the window, \"take the\nflint and the tinder, and the wood in the basket, and make a fire.  I\nhave brought you nothing to eat.\"\n\n\"No need!\" said Ailwin, with an uncommonly merry countenance.\n\n\"You must broil the green corn, unless we can manage to get a fowl from\nacross the yard.  But I really cannot go any more errands till I am\nrested,\" said Oliver, dismally.\n\n\"No need, Oliver dear!\" said Ailwin again.\n\n\"What do you think we have found to eat?\" cried Mildred, from the\nstairs.--\"What is the matter with him, Ailwin?  Why does not he speak?\"\n\n\"He is so tired, he does not know what to do,\" said Ailwin.  \"No, don't\nget down into the water again, dear.  I'll carry you.  Put your arm\nround my neck, and I'll carry you.\"\n\nAnd the good-natured woman carried him up to the roof, and laid him down\non a bundle of bedding there, promising to bring him breakfast\npresently.  She threw an apron over his head, to cover it from the hot\nsun, and bade him lie still, and not think of anything till she came.\n\n\"Only one thing,\" said Oliver.  \"Take particular care of the gravel in\nthe tub.\"\n\n\"Gravel!\" exclaimed Ailwin.  \"The fowls eat gravel; but I don't see that\nwe can.  However, you shall have your way, Oliver.\"\n\nThe tired boy was asleep in a moment.  He knew nothing more till he felt\nvexed at somebody's trying to wake him.  It was Mildred.  He heard her\nsay,--\n\n\"How very sound asleep he is!  I can't make him stir.  Here, Oliver,--\njust eat this, and then you can go to sleep again directly.\"\n\nHe tried to rouse himself, and sat up; but his eyes were so dim, and the\nlight so dazzling, that he could not see, at first, what Mildred had in\nher hands.  It was one of her mother's best china plates,--one of the\nset that was kept in a closet up-stairs; and upon it was a nice brown\ntoasted fish, steaming hot.\n\n\"Is that for me?\" asked Oliver, rubbing his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, for who but you?\" said Ailwin, whose smiling face popped\nup from the stairs.  \"Who deserves it, if you do not, I should like to\nknow?  It is not so good as I could have wished, though, Oliver.  I\ncould not broil it, for want of butter and everything; and we have no\nsalt, you know.  But, come!  Eat it, such as it is.  Come, begin!\"\n\n\"But have you all got some too?\" asked the hungry boy, as he eyed the\nfish.\n\n\"Oh, yes,--George and all,\" said Mildred.  \"We ate ours first, because\nyou were so sound asleep, we did not like to wake you.\"\n\n\"How long have I been asleep?\" asked Oliver, beginning heartily upon his\nfish.  \"How could you get this nice fish?  How busy you must have been\nall this time that I have been asleep!\"\n\n\"All this time!\" exclaimed Mildred.  \"Why, you have been asleep only\nhalf an hour; hardly so much.  We have only just lighted the fire, and\ncooked the fish, and fed Geordie, and put him to sleep, and got our own\nbreakfast;--and we were not long about that,--we were so very hungry!\nThat is all we have done since you went to sleep.\"\n\n\"It seems a great deal for half an hour,\" said Oliver.  \"How good this\nfish is!  Where did you get it?\"\n\n\"I found it on the stairs.  Ah!  I thought you would not believe it; but\nwe shall find more, I dare say, as the water sinks; and then you will\nbelieve what you see.\"\n\n\"On the stairs!  How did it get there?\"\n\n\"The same way that the water got there, I suppose, and the poor little\ndrowned pig that lay close by the same place.  There was a whole heap of\nfish washed up at the turn of the stairs; enough for us all to-day.\nAilwin said we must eat them first, because the pig will keep.  Such a\nnice little clean sucking-pig!\"\n\n\"That puts me in mind of the poor sow,\" said Oliver.  \"I forgot her when\nwe were busy about the cow.  I am afraid she is drowned or starved\nbefore this; but we must see about it.\"\n\n\"Not now,\" said Mildred.  \"Do you go to sleep again now.  There is not\nsuch a hurry as there was, the waters are going down so fast.\"\n\n\"Are they, indeed?--Oh, I do not want to sleep any more.  I am quite\nwide awake now.  Are you sure the flood is going down?\"\n\n\"Only look!  Look at that steep red bank on the Red-hill, where it was\nall a green slope yesterday, and covered with water this morning.  Look\nat the little speck of a hillock, where neighbour Gool's house was.  We\ncould not see that this morning, I am sure.  And if you will come down,\nyou will find that there is scarcely any water in the upper rooms now.\nGeordie might play at paddling there, as he is so fond of doing in his\ntub.  Ailwin thinks we might sleep there to-night, if we could only get\neverything dried.\"\n\n\"We might get many things dried before night, in such a sun as this.\nHow very hot it is!\"\n\nOliver ran down, and convinced himself that the flood was abating fast.\nIt must have swelled up higher within the house than outside; for it had\nsunk three feet in the upper rooms, and two on the outer walls of the\nhouse.  Now that the worst of the danger seemed to be past, the children\nworked with fresh spirit, making all possible use of the sunshine for\ndrying their bedding and clothes, in hopes of sleeping in a chamber this\nnight, instead of on the house-top, which they had feared would be\nnecessary.  Nothing could have made them believe, if they had been told\nat sunrise, how cheerfully they would sit down, in the afternoon, to\nrest and talk, and hope that they might, after all, meet their father\nand mother again soon, alive and well.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. ROGER HIS OWN MASTER.\n\nThere lay Roger under the tree, thinking that there was nothing to\nprevent his having all his own way now, and that he was going to be very\nhappy.  He had always thought it hard that he could not have his own way\nentirely, and had been unsatisfied with a much greater degree of liberty\nthan most people wish or have.\n\nHe had hitherto led a wandering life, having no home duties, no school\nto go to, no trade to work at,--no garden, or other pleasure, to fix him\nto one spot.  He had gone, with his uncle, from sporting on the moors,\nin one season of the year, to sporting in the marshes in another; and,\nwild as was this way of life, it made his will so much wilder, that he\nwas always wishing for more liberty still.  When his aunt had desired\nhim to watch the kettle, as it hung over the fire near the tent, or\nasked him to help her in shaking out their bedding, or cleaning their\nutensils, he had turned sulky, and wished that he lived alone, where he\nneed not be plagued about other people's affairs.  When his uncle had\nordered him to attend at a certain spot and hour, with nets or a gun, he\nhad been wont to feel himself seized with a sudden desire to wander in\nan opposite direction, or to lie half asleep in the sun, too lazy to\nwork at all.  When he had played truant, and returned late to the tent,\nand found nothing better left to eat than a dry crust of bread, or the\ncold remains of a mess of fish, he had frequently thought how pleasant\nit would be to have the best of everything for himself, and only his dog\nto eat up the rest.  So this boy had often felt and thought; and so\nwould many think and feel, perhaps, if there were many as forlorn and\nfriendless as he, with no one to love and be loved by.  Though he had\nhad an uncle and aunt, he had never had a friend.  He knew that they\ncared about him only because he could help to keep the tent, and take\nthe game; and, feeling this, it was irksome to him to be under their\norders.\n\nThe time was now come for which he had so often longed.  He was his own\nmaster completely.  There was nobody near who could order or compel him\nto do anything; while he, on his part, had an obedient servant in his\ndog.  The sky was blue and warm overhead, and the trees cast a pleasant\nshade.  The Red-hill was now an island, which he had all to himself; and\nit was richly stocked with game, for his food and sport.  Here he could\nhave his own way, and be completely happy.\n\nSuch was Roger's idea when he stole the tinder-box, and crossed to the\nhill; and this was what he said to himself as he cooked his meal, and\nwhen he lay down after it on the grass, with the bees humming round him,\nand the sound of the waters being now a pleasant ripple, instead of the\nrush and roar of yesterday.  He desired his dog to lie down, and not\ndisturb him; and he took this opportunity to change the animal's name.\nStephen Redfurn, taking up the quarrel of the day against the bishops,\nwould have the dog called \"Bishop,\" and nothing else.  Roger had always\nwished to call him \"Spy;\" but Bishop would never answer to the name of\nSpy, or even seem to hear it.  Now, however, Bishop was to be Spy, as\nthere was no one here to indulge the dog with his old name; and Spy was\ntold so many times over, and with all the devices that could be thought\nof for impressing the fact on his memory.\n\nThis lesson being given, Roger shut his eyes, and thought he would sleep\nas long as he chose; but, in the first place, he found himself too much\nheated for sleep.  He considered that it was no wonder, after broiling\nhimself in making a fire to broil his hare.  He wished animals ran about\nready cooked--as fruits grow on the sunny side of trees.  It was too bad\nto have to bustle and toil for an hour, to get ready what was eaten in\nten minutes; and it just passed through his mind that, whatever Nan\nRedfurn might have sometimes said and done to him, she had usually saved\nhim all trouble in cooking, and had had his meals ready for him whenever\nhe chose to be at the tent at meal times.  He rose, and thought he could\nfind a cooler place, further under the trees.\n\nHe did so, and again lay down.  Sleep began to steal over him; and, at\nthe same time, the thought crept into his mind that he should never more\nsee Stephen Redfurn.  The ideas that come when one is dropping asleep\nare very vivid; and this one startled Roger so, that Spy found it out,\nand pricked up his ears, as if at some alarm.  This thought would not go\naway; for it so happened that the last words that Stephen and Roger had\nspoken together were angry ones.  Stephen had ordered Roger to carry the\nfry they had fished for manure to a field, where he had promised to\ndeposit it by a certain time.  Roger had been sure that the fish would\nbe better for lying in the sun a while longer, and refused to touch it.\nNo matter which was right about the manure; both were wrong in being\nangry.  Stephen had said that Roger was a young rascal, who would never\ncome to good; and Roger had looked impertinently in his uncle's face,\nwhile whistling to the dog to come with him, and make sport among the\nwater-fowl.  It was that face--that countenance of his uncle's, as he\nhad last seen it, which was before Roger's eyes now, as he lay dozing.\nWith it came the angry tones of Stephen's voice, saying that he would\nnever come to good.  Mixed and confused with this was the roar of a\ncoming flood, and a question (how and whence spoken he knew not) whether\nhis uncle might not possibly have been saved, if he had not, against\norders, carried away Bishop--for the dog was still Bishop in his\nmaster's dreams.\n\nRoger started bolt upright, and looked about him.  He felt very tired;\nbut he thought he would not lie down again just yet.  It was odd that he\ncould not get sound asleep, so tired as he was.  If he should not sleep\nbetter than this at night, what should he do?  He wished he had some\nmore of that woman's cherry-brandy.  He had slept sound enough after\ndrinking that.  It was well for Roger that he was not now within reach\nof intoxicating liquors--the state of his mind would probably have made\na drunkard of him.\n\nHis mind ran strangely on his uncle, and his uncle's last looks and\nwords, even as he stood wide awake, and staring at the bee-hives.  A\nrustle in the briars behind him made him jump as if he had been shot.\nIt was only a partridge taking wing.\n\n\"Whirr away!\" said Roger to her.  \"You can't go far.  You will have to\nlight again upon my island.  You all belong to me--you swarming\ncreatures!  You may run about awhile, and flutter away a bit; but you\nwill all belong to me at last, with Spy to help me.  I'll have some\nsport, now.  Here, Spy!  Spy!\"\n\nSpy had disappeared, and did not come when called.  A whistle brought\nhim, however, at last.  He came out of the thicket, licking his chops.\nBeing commanded to bring his game, he soon produced two rabbits.  It was\neasy work for the dog to catch them; for the poor creatures had no holes\nhere.  They had come to this raised ground from a warren some way off,\nwhere they had been soaked out of their holes.\n\nSpy was praised for everything but not answering to his name.  For that\nhe was lectured, and then sent off again, to try what he could find.  He\nbrought in prey of various kinds; for he could not stir among the trees\nwithout starting some.  During the fun, as Roger thought it, while the\nterrified birds were fluttering among the branches of the trees, and the\nscared animals bursting through the thicket, Roger resolved that he\nwould not plague himself with any more thoughts of Stephen and Nan.  If\nthey were drowned, it was none of his doing; and, as for Stephen's anger\nyesterday, there was nothing new in that; Stephen was angry every day of\nhis life.  He would not be scared out of his sleep any more by nonsense.\nHe would not give up having his own way to see Stephen and Nan under\nthese very trees; and, as he had got his own way at last, he would enjoy\nit.\n\nThis mood went on till there was such a heap of dead animals, that Roger\nbegan to think whether he could skin them all, and clean their skins, in\nsuch hot weather as this, before they were unfit for any use.  As for\neating them, here was twenty times as much food as could be eaten while\nit was good.  He did just remember the children and Ailwin, and how much\nthey probably wanted food; but he settled that it was no business of\nhis; and he was not going to trouble himself to leave his island for\nanybody.  He would call in Spy, and tie him up; for there must be no\nmore game killed to-day.\n\nSpy did not come for any calling,--for anything short of the well-known\nwhistle, as Roger would not utter the name of Bishop.  Roger grew very\nangry at being obeyed no better than this; and his last whistle was so\nshrill that the dog seemed to know what it threatened, refused to answer\nit as long as he dared, and then came unwillingly, with fear in every\nattitude.  He gave a low whine when he saw his master; as he had good\nreason to do.  Roger tied him to a tree, and then gave loose to his\npassion.  He thrashed the dog with a switch till the poor creature's\nwhine was heard and pitied by the children and Ailwin on their\nhouse-top; and there is no knowing how long the whipping might not have\ngone on, if the animal had not at last turned furious, and snapped at\nRoger in a way which made him think of giving over, and finding\nsomething else to do with his sovereignty.\n\nHe found it was rather dull work, so far, having all his own way, in an\nisland of his own.  At last, he bethought himself of an amusement he had\nbeen fond of before he lived so much in the moors and the carrs.  He\nbethought himself of bird's-nesting.  It was too late for eggs; but he\nthought the bird-families might not have all dispersed.  Here were\nplenty of trees, and they must be full of birds; for, though they were\nsilent to-day (he did wish the place was not quite so silent!) they\nsometimes sent their warblings so far over the carr, that Nan Redfurn\nwould mention them in the tent.  He would see what ailed them, that they\nwould not give him any music to-day.  By incessant cooing, he obtained\nan answer from one solitary pigeon; which he took advantage of to climb\nthe tree, and look for the nest.  He found a nest; but there was nothing\nin it.  He climbed several trees, and found abundance of nests; but all\ndeserted.  Except his solitary pigeon (which presently vanished), there\nappeared to be not a winged creature in all those trees.  The birds had\nbeen frightened away by the roar of the flood of yesterday; and,\nperhaps, by seeing the fields, to which they had been wont to resort for\ntheir food, all turned into a waste of muddy waters.\n\nRoger threw to the ground every empty nest he found, from the common\ninability of a boy to keep his hands off a bird's-nest.  When he was\ntired of climbing trees, he picked up all the scattered nests, and laid\nthem in a long row on the grass.  They looked dismal enough.  It is\ndisagreeable to see a range of houses left half-built (such as may be\nseen in the neighbourhood of large towns), with the doorways gaping, and\nthe window-spaces empty, and roofs hardly covering in the dark inside;\nbut such a row of houses is less dismal than Roger's array of\nbirds'-nests.  There is something in the very make of a bird's-nest\nwhich rouses thoughts of blue or red-spotted eggs, of callow young\nbirds, with their large hungry eyes and beaks, or of twittering\nfledglings, training for a summer life of pleasure.  To see, instead of\nthese, their silent empty habitations, extended in a long row, would be\nenough to make any one dull and sad.  So Roger found.  He kicked them\ninto a heap under a tree, and thought that they would make a fine\ncrackling fire.  He would burn them, every one.\n\nWhile he was wondering whether any birds would come back to miss their\nnests, it struck him that he had not thought how he was to pass the\nnight.  It was nothing new to him to sleep in the open air.  He liked it\nbest at this season.  But he had usually had a rug to lie upon, with the\ntent over him; or a blanket; or, at worst, he had a sack to creep into.\nThe clothes he had on were old and thin; and as he looked at them, it\nmade him angry to think that he was not to have everything as he liked\nit, after all.  Here he should have to pass a cold night, and with\nnothing between him and the hard ground.  He thought of gathering\nleaves, moss, and high grass, to roll himself up in, like a squirrel in\nits hole; but the trouble was what he did not like.  He stood listlessly\nthinking how much trouble it would cost to collect moss and leaves for\nthe purpose; and, while he was so thinking, he went on pelting his dog\nwith birds'-nests, and seeing how the angry dog, unable to get loose,\nsnapped up and shook to pieces the nests which fell within his reach.\n\nRoger knew that he ought to be skinning some of the dead animals, if he\nreally meant to secure all their skins, before it was too late; but this\nalso was troublesome.  Instead of doing this, he went round the hill, to\nsee what the Linacres were about, resolving by no means to appear to see\nthem, if they should be making signs from the window to have the things\nback again that he had carried away.  On coming out of the shade on that\nside of the hill, he was surprised to see smoke still going up from his\nfire, considering that the fire was nearly out when he had left it.\nSomething more strange met his eye as he ran forward.  There was the\nnice clean blanket spread out on the ground, with the tinder-box in the\nmiddle.\n\n\"Somebody has been here!\" cried Roger, much offended.  \"What business\nhas anybody in my island?  Coming when my back is turned!  If I had only\nheard them coming to meddle--!\"\n\nJust then, his eye fell on the rug, blanket, and knife and fork left by\nOliver,--the very accommodation he had been wishing for, and more.  When\nhe felt the thick warm rug, he gave over his anger at some one having\nentered his island without his leave, and, for a moment, again felt\npleased and happy.  But when he saw that the bridge-basket was gone--\nthat other people had the means of coming in upon him when they\npleased--he was more angry than he had been all day.\n\n\"However,\" thought he, \"I got over to the house before anyone else\ncrossed the water, and I can do the same again whenever I please.  I\nhave only to swim over with Spy, and bring away anything I like, while\nthey are busy on the other side, about their good-for-nothing cow, or\nsomething.  That will be tit-for-tat.\"\n\nHe was doubly mistaken here.  His going over to steal comforts from the\nLinacres would not be tit-for-tat for Oliver's coming over to his\nfather's hill, to bring away his mother's clothes basket, and leave\ncomforts for an unwelcome visitor!  Neither could Roger now enter the\nLinacres' dwelling when he pleased, by swimming the stream.  He saw this\nwhen he examined and considered.  The water had sunk so as to show a few\ninches of the top of the entrance-door and lower windows.  It was not\nhigh enough to allow of his getting in at the upper window, as he did\nyesterday; and too high for entrance below.  The stream appeared to be\nas rapid and strong as ever; and it shot its force through the carr as\nvehemently as at first; for it was almost, or quite as deep as ever.  It\nhad worn away soil at the bottom of its channel, to nearly or quite the\nsame depth as it had sunk at the surface; so that it was still working\nagainst the walls and foundation of the house, and the soil of the hill,\nwith as much force as during the first hour.  When Roger examined the\nred precipice from which he looked down upon the rushing stream, he\nperceived that not a yard of Linacres' garden could now be in existence.\nThat garden, with its flourishing vegetables, its rare, gay, sweet\nflowers, and its laden fruit trees,--that garden which he and Stephen\ncould not help admiring, while they told everybody that it had no\nbusiness in the middle of their carr,--that garden, its earth and its\nplants, was all spread in ruins over the marsh; and instead of it would\nbe found, if the waters could be dried up, a deep, gravelly, stony\nwatercourse, or a channel of red mud.  Roger wondered whether the boy\nand girl were aware of this fate of their garden; or whether they\nsupposed that everything stood fast and in order under the waters.  He\nwanted to point out the truth to them; and looked up to the chamber\nwindow, in hopes that they might be watching him from it.  No one was\nthere, however.  On glancing higher, he saw them sitting within the\nbalustrade on the roof.  They were all looking another way, and not\nappearing to think of him at all.  He watched them for a long while; but\nthey never turned towards the Red-hill.  He could have made them hear by\ncalling; but they might think he wished to be with them, or wanted\nsomething from them, instead of understanding that he desired to tell them\nthat their pretty garden was destroyed.  So he began to settle with\nhimself which of his dead game he would have for supper, and then fed\nhis fire, in order to cook it.  He now thought that he should have liked\na bird for supper,--a pheasant or partridge instead of a rabbit or\nleveret; of which he had plenty.  He felt it very provoking that he had\nneither a net nor a gun, for securing feathered game, when there was so\nmuch on the hill; so that he must put up with four-footed game, when he\nhad rather have had a bird.  There was no bread either, or vegetables;\nbut he minded that less, because neither of these were at hand, and he\nhad often lived for a long time together on animal food.  During the\nwhole time of his listless preparations for cooking his supper, he\nglanced up occasionally at the roof; but he never once saw the party\nlook his way.  He thought it very odd that they should care so much less\nabout him, than he knew they did when Stephen and he came into the carr.\nThey neither seemed to want him nor to fear him to-day.\n\nAt length he went to set Spy loose, in order to feed him, and to have a\ncompanion, for he felt rather dull, while seeing how busily the party on\nthe house-top were talking.  When he returned with Spy, the sun had set,\nand there was no one on the house-top.  A faint light from the chamber\nwindow told that Ailwin and the children were there.  Roger wondered how\nthey had managed to kindle a fire, while he had the tinder-box.  He\nlearned the truth, soon after, by upsetting the tinder-box, as he moved\nthe blanket.  The steel fell out; and the flint and tinder were found to\nbe absent.  In his present mood he considered it prodigious impertinence\nto impose upon him the labour of finding a flint the next day, and the\nchoice whether to make tinder of a bit of his shirt, or to use shavings\nof wood instead.  He determined to show, meanwhile, that he had plenty\nof fire for to-night, and therefore heaped it up so high, that there was\nsome danger that the lower branches of the ash under which he sat would\nshrivel up with the heat.\n\nNo blaze that he could make, however, could conceal from his own view\nthe cheerful light from the chamber window.  There was certainly a good\nfire within; and those who sat beside it were probably better companions\nto each other than Spy was to him.  The dog was dull and would not play;\nand Roger himself soon felt too tired, or something, to wish to play.\nHe could not conceal from himself that he should much like to be in that\nchamber from which the light shone, even though there was no\ncherry-brandy there now.\n\nThe stars were but just beginning to drop into the sky, and the waste of\nwaters still looked yellow and bright to the west; but Roger's first day\nof having his own way had been quite long enough; and he spread his rug,\nand rolled himself in his blanket for the night.  Spy, being invited,\ndrew near, and lay down too.  Roger was still overheated, from having\nmade such an enormous fire; but he muffled up his head in his blanket,\nas if he was afraid lest even his dog should see that he was crying.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. ROGER NOT HIS OWN MASTER.\n\nMore than once during the long night, Roger heard strange sounds; and\nSpy repeatedly raised his head, and seemed uneasy.  Above the constant\nflow of the stream, there came occasionally a sort of roar, then a\nrumble and a splash, and the stream appeared to flow on faster.  Once\nRoger rose in the belief that the house,--the firm, substantial, stone\nhouse,--was washed down.  But it was not so.  There was no moon at the\ntime of night when he looked forth; but it was clear starlight; and\nthere stood the dark mass of the building in the midst of the grey\nwaters.  Roger vowed he would not get up from his warm rug again, on any\nfalse alarm; and so lay till broad daylight, sometimes quite asleep, and\nsometimes drowsily, resolving that he would think no more of uncle\nStephen, except in the day-time.\n\nSoon after sunrise, however, a renewed rumble and splash roused him to\nopen his eyes wide.  What he saw made him jump up, and run to the edge\nof the precipice, to see all he could.  The greater part of the roof of\nthe house was gone; and there were cracks in the solid stone walls\nthrough which the yellow sunshine found its way.  One portion of the\nwall leaned in; another leaned out towards the water.  At first Roger\nexpected to see the whole building crumble down into the stream, and\nsupposed that the inhabitants might be swept quite away.  He gazed with\nthe strange feeling that not a creature might be now left alive in that\nhabitation.\n\nRoger's heart sank within him at the idea of his own solitude, if this\nwere indeed the case.  He had nothing to fear for his own safety.  The\nRed-hill would not be swept away.  He could live as he was for a long\ntime to come; till some some steps should be taken for repairing the\ndamage of the flood; till some explorers should arrive in a boat; which\nhe had no doubt would happen soon.  It was not about his own safety that\nRoger was anxious; but it frightened him to think of being entirely\nalone in such a place as this, with the bodies of all whom he knew best\nlying under the waters on every side of him.  If he could have Oliver\nwith him to speak to, or even little George, it would make all the\ndifference to him.  He really hoped they were left alive.  When he began\nto consider, he perceived that the bridge-rope remained, stretched as\ntight as ever.  The chamber window, and indeed all that wall of the\nhouse, looked firm and safe; and such roof as was left was over that\npart.  This was natural enough, as the violence of the flood was much\ngreater on the opposite side of the house than on the garden side.  The\nstaircase was safe.  It was laid open to view very curiously; but it\nstood upright and steady: and, at length, to Roger's great relief,\nMildred appeared upon it.  She merely ran up to fetch something from the\nroof; but her step, her run and jump, was, to Roger's mind, different\nfrom what it would have been if she had been in great affliction or\nfear.  In his pleasure at this, he snatched his cap from his head, and\nwaved it: but the little girl was very busy, and she did not see him.\nIt was odd, Roger said to himself, that the Linacres were always now\nthinking of everything but him, when formerly they could never watch him\nenough.\n\nAfter a while he descended the bank, to fill his boiler with water.  It\nwas necessary to do this for some time before drinking, in order that\nthe mud might settle.  Even after standing for several hours, the day\nbefore, the water was far from clear; and it was very far from sweet.\nThis was nothing new to Roger, however, who had been accustomed to drink\nwater like this as often as he had been settled in the carr, though he\nhad occasionally been allowed to mix with it some gin from his uncle's\nbottle.  He was thirsty enough this morning to drink almost anything;\nbut he did think the water in the boiler looked particularly muddy and\ndisagreeable.  Spy seemed as thirsty as himself, and as little disposed\nto drink of the stream as it ran below.  He pranced about the boiler, as\nif watching for an opportunity to wet his tongue, if his master should\nturn his back for a minute.\n\nThe opportunity soon came; for Roger saw the bridge-basket put out of\nthe window by Ailwin; after which, Oliver got into it.  Ailwin handed\nhim something, as he pulled away for the Red-hill.  With a skip and a\njump Roger ran to the beach to await him.\n\n\"Pull away!  That's right!  Glad to see you!\" exclaimed Roger.  \"Halloo,\nSpy!  Down, sir!  Pleased to see you, Oliver.\"\n\nOliver was glad to hear these words.  He did not know but that he might\nhave been met by abuse and violence, for having carried home the basket.\n\n\"Would you like some milk?\" asked Oliver, as he came near.\n\n\"Ay, that I should,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Leave yonder water to your dog, then, and drink this,\" said Oliver,\nhanding down a small tin can.  \"You must let me have the can, though.\nAlmost all our kitchen things floated out through the wall, at that\nbreach that you see, during the night.  You must give me the can again,\nif you would like that I should bring you some more milk this afternoon.\nThe poor cow is doing but badly, and we cannot feed her as we should\nlike: but she has given milk enough for George this morning, with a\nlittle to spare for us and you.  You seem to like it,\" he added,\nlaughing to see how Roger smacked his lips over the draught.\n\n\"That I do.  It is good stuff, I know,\" said Roger, as he drained the\nlast drop.\n\n\"Then I will bring you some more in the afternoon, if there is any to\nspare from poor George's supper.\"\n\n\"That's a pity.  You've enough to do, I think.  Suppose I come over.\nEh?\"\n\n\"There is something to be said about that,\" replied Oliver, gravely.\n\"We do not want to keep what we have to ourselves.  We have got a chest\nof meal, this morning.\"\n\n\"A chest of meal!\"\n\n\"Yes: a large chest, and not wet at all, except an inch deep all round\nthe outside.  We caught it just now as it was floating by; and we should\nlike you to have some of it, as you have no bread here: but you know,\nRoger, you kicked our poor cow when she was too weak to stand; and you\ncarried away our tinder-box when you knew we had no fire.  We don't want\nto have you with us to do such things: and so I think I had better bring\nyou some of the meal over here.  And yet it is a pity; for the broth\nthat Ailwin is making will be very good.\"\n\n\"I'll come over,\" said Roger.  \"I am stronger than you, and I can help\nyou to feed the cow, and everything.\"\n\n\"I can do all that, with Ailwin to help: and I am sure Mildred had much\nrather you should stay here, unless you behave differently.  And poor\nlittle George, too!  He is not well, and we do not like that he should\nbe frightened.\"\n\n\"I sha'n't frighten him or anybody, you'll see.  You had better let me\ncome; and Spy and I will bring you a lot of game.\"\n\n\"We don't want any game, at present.  We have plenty to eat.\"\n\n\"You had better let me come and help you.  I won't hurt George, or\nanything.  Come, I promise you you shan't repent doing me a good turn.\"\n\n\"Then you shall come, Roger.  But do remember that Mildred is only a\nlittle girl; and consider poor Geordie too; he is quite ill.  You wont\ntease him?  Well, here's the line.  Come as soon as you please, after I\nam landed.\"\n\nOliver had been in the basket, out of reach, during this conversation.\nHe now flung down the basket line, and returned. Roger was not long in\nfollowing, with some of his game, some fire-wood, and his dog.  He left\nhis bedding hidden in the thicket, and the tinder-box in a dry hole in a\ntree, that he might come back to his island at any time, in case of\nquarrel with the Linacres.\n\nPoor little George did indeed look ill.  He was lying across Mildred's\nlap, very fretful, his cheeks burning hot, his lips dry, and his mouth\nsore.  Ailwin had put a charm round his neck the day before; but he did\nnot seem to be the better for it.  Busy as she was, she tied on another\nthe moment she heard from Oliver that Roger was coming.  When Roger and\nthe basket darkened the window, Ailwin and Mildred called out at once,\n\"Here he is!\"  George turned his hot head that way, and repeated, \"Here\nhe is!\"\n\n\"Yes, here I am!  And here's what I have brought,\" said Roger, throwing\ndown two rabbits and a leveret.  He took up the leveret presently, and\nbrought it to George, that he might feel how soft the fur was.  The\nchild flinched from him at first, but was persuaded, at length, to\nstroke the leveret's back, and play with its paws.\n\n\"That boy has some good in him after all,\" thought Ailwin, \"unless this\nbe a trick.  It is some trick, I'll be bound.\"\n\n\"You are tight and dry enough here,\" said Roger, glancing round the\nroom.  \"By the look of the house from the hill, I thought you had been\nall in ruins.\"\n\nThe minds of Ailwin and Mildred were full of the events of the night;\nand they forgot that it was Roger they were speaking to when they told\nwhat their terrors had been.  Ailwin had started up in the middle of the\nnight, and run to the door; and, on opening it, had seen the stars\nshining bright down into the house.  The roof of the other side of the\nhouse was clean gone.  When Mildred looked out from the same place at\nsunrise, she saw the water spread almost under her feet.  The floor of\nthe landing-place, and the ceiling of one of the lower rooms had been\nbroken up, and the planks were floating about.\n\n\"Where are they?\" asked Roger, quickly.  \"To be sure you did not let\nthem float off, along with the kitchen things that got away through the\nwall?\"\n\nMildred did not know that any care had been taken of the planks.  Roger\nwas off to see, saying that they might be glad of every foot of plank\nthey could lay their hands on.\n\nAilwin and Mildred saw no more of either of the boys during the whole\nmorning.  They might have looked out to discover what was doing, but\nthat neither of them liked the sight of the bare rafters overhead, or of\nthe watery precipice at their feet.  So Ailwin went on making cakes of a\ncurious sort, as she said; cakes of meal, made up with milk and water,\nwithout either yeast or salt.  They would not be spoiled by the water;\nthat was all that could be said for them.  The water which was filtered\nthrough gravel turned out quite good enough to be used in cooking, and\neven for poor George to drink, so very thirsty as he was.  While the\nfowl simmered in the pot, and the cakes lay toasting on the hob, Ailwin\nbusied herself in making the beds, and then in rubbing, with her strong\narm, everything in the room, helping the floor, the walls, and the\nfurniture to dry from the wetting of yesterday.  From the smell, she\nsaid, she should have thought that everything in the house was growing\nmouldy before her face.  They were all aware that the bad smell which\nthey had observed yesterday, was growing worse every hour.  Roger had\nbeen much struck with it the moment he entered the window.\n\nWhen the boys at length appeared, to say how hungry they were, they\nburst in more like two schoolfellows who have been trying a new game,\nthan little lads on whom others were depending for subsistence in the\nmidst of a heavy calamity.  They had made a raft--a real stout, broad\nraft, which would be of more use to them (now the currents were\nslackening) than anything they had attempted yet.  Oliver told that\namong the many things which the current brought from poor neighbour\nGool's, was a lot of harness from his stables.  Roger had seen at once\nwhat strong fastenings this harness would make for their raft.  They had\nthen crossed to their own stable, and found their own suit of harness\nhanging safe against the wall which remained.  They had tied their\nplanks to three stout beams, which they had pulled out from the ruined\npart of their house wall.  It had been pretty hard work; but the raft\nwas secure, and well fastened, moreover, to a door-post, with a long\nline; so that they might row about without having always to be looking\nthat they were not carried abroad into the carr.  Oliver really thought\nit was almost as good as having a boat.  Roger protested that it was\nbetter, because it would hold more goods: but the brother and sister\ncould not think that the raft was the best of the two, when they\nremembered that a boat would carry them, perhaps, to their mother's\narms.  Oliver knew what Mildred was thinking of when he said,--\n\n\"We must not dream of getting away on our raft, dear.  It would upset in\nthe currents twenty times, between this place and the hills.\"\n\n\"Well, what of that?\" said Roger.  \"Who wants to get to the hills?  We\nhave got all we want for a good while here.  We can take our pleasure,\nand live as free as wild-ducks in a pond that nobody comes near.\"\n\nRoger was quite in spirits and good humour.  It may seem strange that a\nboy who was so lazy the day before, as to wish that hares ran about\nready roasted, should work so hard this day at so severe a job as making\na raft.  But it was natural enough.  There is nothing interesting to a\ndull and discontented person, all alone, in preparing a meal for his own\nself to eat: but there is something animating in planning a clever job,\nwhich can be set about immediately--a ready and willing companion being\nat hand to help, and to talk with.  There was also something immediate\nto be gained by finishing this raft.  One thing or another was floating\nby every quarter of an hour, which it would be worth while to seize and\nbring home.  As Roger saw, now a hay-cock, and now a man's hat, float\nby, he worked harder and harder, that as few treasures as possible might\nbe thus lost.  Oliver felt much in the same way, particularly from his\nwant of a hat or cap.  Ailwin had made him tie a handkerchief round his\nhead; but it heated him, without saving him much from the scorching of\nthe sun on his head, and the glare from the waters to his eyes.\n\nAilwin had looked for some compliments to her cookery from the hungry\nboys; but they forgot, in their eagerness about the raft, that it was a\ntreat in these days to have meal-cakes; and they ate and talked, without\nthinking much of what it was that they were putting into their mouths.\nWhen they went off again to see what they could find, it is not to be\ntold how Mildred would have liked to go with them.  She did not want her\ndinner, to which Ailwin said they two would now sit down comfortably.\nShe did not now mind the precipice and the broken walls, and the staring\nrafters.  She longed to stand somewhere, and see the boys take prizes in\nthe stream.  She had held poor George all the morning; for he would not\nlet her put him on the bed.  Her back ached, her arms were stiff, and\nher very heart was sick with his crying.  He had been fretting or\nwailing ever since daylight; and Mildred felt as if she could not bear\nit one minute longer.  Just then she heard a laugh from the boys\noutside; and Ailwin began to sing, as she always did when putting away\nthe pots and pans.  Nobody seemed to care: nobody seemed to think of\nher; and Mildred remembered how different it would have been if her\nmother had been there.  Her mother would have been thinking about poor\nGeorge all the morning: but her mother would have thought of her too;\nwould have remembered that she must be tired; and have cheered her with\ntalk, or with saying something hopeful about the poor baby.\n\nWhen Ailwin stopped her loud singing, for a moment, while considering in\nwhich corner she should set down her stew-pan, she heard a gentle sob.\nLooking round, she saw Mildred's face covered with tears.\n\n\"What's the matter now, dear?\" said she.  \"Is the baby worse?  No,--he\ndon't seem worse to me.\"\n\n\"I don't know, I'm sure.  But, Ailwin, I am so tired, I don't know what\nto do; and I cannot bear to hear him cry so.  He has been crying in this\nway all to-day; and it is the longest day I ever knew.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure I wish we could think of anything that would quiet him.\nIf we had only his go-cart, now, or his wooden lamb, with the white wool\nupon it, that he is so fond of ...  But they are under water below.\"\n\n\"But if you could only take him for a little while, Ailwin, I should be\nso glad!  I would wash up all your dishes for you.\"\n\n\"Take him!  Oh, that's what you are at!  To be sure I will; and I might\nhave thought of that before,--only I had my pans and things to put away.\nI'll wash my hands now directly, and take him:--only, there is not much\nuse in washing one's hands: this foul damp smell seems to stick to\neverything one touches.  It is that boy's doing, depend upon it.  He is\nat the bottom of all mischief.--Ay, Mildred, you need not object to what\nI say.  After what I saw of him yesterday morning, with all that plague\nof animals about him on the stairs, you will never persuade me that he\nhas not some league with bad creatures, a good way off.  I don't half\nlike Oliver's being with him on the raft, in the stream there.  That\nraft was wonderfully ready made for two slips of boys.\"\n\n\"They had the planks ready to their hands,\" said Mildred, trembling;\n\"and leather harness and ropes to tie it with.  I think they might to do\nit as they said.  What harm do you suppose will happen, Ailwin?  I am\nsure Oliver would do nothing wrong, about making the raft, or anything\nelse.--O dear!  I wish George would not cry so!\"\n\n\"Here, give him to me,\" said Ailwin, who had now washed her hands, and\ntaken off her cooking apron.  \"There, go you and finish the dishes, and\nthen to play,--there's a dear!  And don't think about George, or about\nRoger, and the raft, or anything that will vex you,--there's a dear!\"\n\nAilwin gave Mildred a smacking kiss, as she received little George from\nher; and, though Mildred could not, as she was bid, put away all vexing\nthoughts, she was cheered by Ailwin's good-will.\n\nShe had soon done washing the few plates they had used, though she did\nthe washing with the greatest care, because it was her mother's best\nchina, brought from Holland, and kept in the up-stairs cupboard,--ready,\nas it now seemed, to serve the present party, who must otherwise have\ngone without plates and cups, their common sets being all under water,--\nbroken to pieces, no doubt, by this time.--George was already quieter\nthan he had been all day; so that Mildred felt the less scruple about\ngoing out to amuse herself,--or rather, to watch her brother; for she\nhardly dared to take any pleasure in the raft, after what Ailwin had\nsaid; though she kept repeating to herself that it was all nonsense,\nsuch as Ailwin often talked; such as Mrs Linacre said her children must\nneither believe nor laugh at.\n\nMildred went at once to the top of the staircase, which stood up firm,\nthough the building had fallen away on almost every side of it.  It was\nrather a giddy affair at first, sitting on the top stair of a spiral\nstaircase of which part of the walls were gone, while the bare rafters\nof the roof let the water be seen through them.  Mildred soon grew\naccustomed to her place, however, and fixed her eyes on the raft with\nwhich the boys were plying in the stream.  She supposed they had caught\na hay-cock; for the cow was eating, very industriously,--no longer on\nthe dunghill, but on a slip of ground which had been left dry between it\nand the stable.  The cow had company to share her good cheer: whether\ninvited or uninvited, there was no saying.  A strange pony was there;\nand a sheep, and a well-grown calf.  These animals all pressed upon one\nanother on the narrow space of ground, thrusting their heads over or\nunder one another's necks, to snatch the hay.\n\n\"How hungry they are!\" thought Mildred, \"and how they tease one\nanother!\"  She then remembered having read of men starving in a boat at\nsea, who became as selfish as these animals in snatching from one\nanother their last remaining morsels of food.  She hoped that she and\nOliver should not be starved, at last, in the middle of this flood: but\nif they were, she did not believe that Oliver and she could ever snatch\nfood from each other, or help themselves before Geordie, whatever Roger\nmight do, or even Ailwin.  Ailwin was very kind and good-tempered; but\nthen she was apt to be so very hungry!  However, there was no occasion\nto think of want of food yet.  The meal which had been wetted, round the\nsides and under the lid of the chest, served well to feed the fowls; and\nthey seemed to find something worth picking up in the mud and slime that\nthe waters had left behind as they sank.  The poor sow had farrowed too.\nShe and her little pigs were found almost dead with hunger and wet: but\nthe meal-chest had come just in time to save them.  Ailwin had said it\nwas worth while to spare them some of the meal; for the little pigs, if\ntheir mother was well fed, would give them many a good dinner.  There\nwas no occasion to fear want of food at present.\n\nThe boys were on their raft in the middle of the stream, working away\nwith their broad paddles, evidently wishing to catch something which was\nfloating down.  Mildred could see only a small tree bobbing about,\nsometimes showing its roots above water, and sometimes its leafy\nbranches.  What could they want with a young tree, so well off as they\nwere for drier fire-wood than it would make?  They were determined to\nhave it, it was clear; for Roger threw down his paddle as they neared\nthe tree, caught up a long rope, and gave it a cast towards the\nbranching top as the rope went through the air, Mildred saw that it had\na noose at the end.  The noose caught:--the tree gave a topple in the\nwater, when it found itself stopped in its course with a jerk; and the\nboys set up a shout as they pulled for the house, hauling in their prize\nafter them.\n\nMildred ran down the stairs as far as she dared,--almost to the very\nbrink of the water.  There she was near enough to see and hear what was\ndoing.  The tree was an apple-tree; and though the ripest apples were\ngone, a good many were left, which would be a treat when cooked.  The\nboys saw her watching them, and Roger said it was not fair that she\nshould stand idle while they were working like horses:--why should not\nshe gather the apples before they were all knocked off, instead of\nkeeping other people out of the stream to do such girls' work?  Oliver\nsaid she had been as useful as anybody all day; and she should do as she\nliked now.  He called out to Mildred; and asked her whether she should\nlike to gather the apples off the tree, while they went to see what else\nthey could find.  Mildred replied that she should like it very much, if\nthey could bring in the tree to the place where she was.  Ailwin would\nfind something for her to put the apples in.\n\nNeither the raft nor the tree, however, could be got through the breach\nin the wall.  Oliver fetched the tub, which had been discarded since the\nraft had been thought of.  He rowed himself to the staircase in this\ntub, and asked Mildred if she was afraid just to cross those few yards\nto the wall.  He would find her a nice seat on the wall, where she could\nsit plucking the apples, and seeing all they did on the raft.  He would\nbe sure to come, for her, as soon as she should make a signal for him.\nMeantime, the tub would hold the apples.\n\nMildred had a great fancy for sharing the boys' adventures; and though\nthe tub looked a small, unsteady boat, she ventured to slide down into\nit, and sit in it, while her brother rowed her over to the broken wall.\nShe was so silent that Oliver thought she was frightened; but she was\nconsidering whether or not to tell him of Ailwin's fears of his being on\nthe raft with Roger.  Before she had decided, they had come within\nhearing of Roger, and it was too late.\n\nAfter finding a steady broad stone in the wall for her to sit on, Oliver\nchose to stay a little while, to cut and break off from the trunk the\nbranches that had the most fruit on them.  This would make Mildred's\nwork much easier.  Oliver also chose, in spite of all Roger could say,\nto leave her one of their paddles.  He considered (though he did not say\nit) that some accident might possibly happen to the raft, to prevent\ntheir returning for her: and he declared that Mildred should have an oar\nto row herself in with, if she should have a mind to join Ailwin, at any\nmoment, instead of waiting where she was.  So having moored the tub\ninside the house wall, and the apple-tree outside, and established\nMildred on a good seat between, the boys pushed off again.\n\nMildred found that she had undertaken a wet and dirty task.  The\nbranches of the apple-tree were dripping, and the fruit covered with\nslime; but these are things which must not be minded in times of flood.\nSo she went on, often looking away, however, to wonder what things were\nwhich were swept past her, and to watch the proceedings of the boys.\nAfter a while, she became so bold as to consider what a curious thing it\nwould be if she, without any raft, should pick up some article as\nvaluable as any that had swum the stream.  This thought was put into her\nhead by seeing something occasionally flap out upon the surface of the\nmuddy water, as if it were spread out below.  It looked to her like the\ntail of a coat, or the skirt of a petticoat.  She was just about to fish\nit up with her paddle, when it occurred to her that it might be the\nclothing of a drowned person.  She shrank back at the thought, and in\nthe first terror of having a dead body so near her, called Oliver's\nname.  He did not hear; and she would not repeat the call when she saw\nhow busy he was.  She tried not to think of this piece of cloth; but it\ncame up perpetually before her eyes, flap, flapping, till she felt that\nit would be best to satisfy herself at once, as to what it was.\n\nShe poked her paddle underneath the flap, and found that it was caught\nand held down by something heavy.  She tugged hard at it, and raised\nsome more blue cloth.  She did not believe there was a body now; and she\nlaid hold of the cloth and drew it in.  It was heavy in itself, and made\nmore so by the wet, so that the little girl had to set her foot against\na stone in the wall, and employ all her strength, before she could land\nthe cloth, yard after yard, upon the wall.  It was a piece of home-spun,\nprobably laid out on the grass of some field in the Levels, after\ndyeing, and so carried away.  When Mildred had pulled in a vast\nquantity, there was some resistance;--the rest would not come.  Perhaps\nsomething heavy had lodged upon it, and kept it down.  Again she used\nher paddle, setting her feet against one stone, and pressing her back\nagainst another, to give her more power.  In the midst of the effort,\nthe stone behind her gave way.  It was her paddle now, resting against\nsome support under water, which saved her from popping into the water\nwith the great stone.  As it was, she swayed upon her seat, and was very\nnearly gone, while the heavy stone slid in, and raised a splash which\nwetted her from head to foot, and left her trembling in every limb.  She\nhad fancied, once or twice before, that the wall shook under her: she\nwas now persuaded that it was all shaking, and would soon be carried\nquite away.  She screamed out to Oliver to come and save her.  She must\nhave called very loud; for Ailwin, with George in her arms, was out on\nthe staircase in a moment.\n\nThere was a scuffle on the raft.  It seemed as if Oliver was paddling\nwith one hand, and keeping off Roger with the other.  It was terrible to\nsee them,--it was so like fighting, in a most dangerous place.  There\nwas a splash.  Mildred's eyes grew dim in a moment, and she could see\nnothing: but she heard Ailwin's voice,--very joyful,--calling out to\nOliver,--\n\n\"Well done, Oliver!  Well rid of him!  Pull away from him, Oliver!  He\nis full able to take care of himself, depend upon it.  He was never made\nto be drowned.  Come and help Mildred, there's a dear!  Never mind\nRoger.\"\n\nMildred soon saw the raft approaching her, with Oliver alone upon it.\n\n\"Oh!  Oliver, where is he?  What have you done?\" cried Mildred, as her\nbrother arrived at the wall.\n\nOliver was very hot, and his lips quivered as he answered,--\n\n\"I don't know what I have done.  I could not help it.  He wanted me not\nto come to you when you screamed.  He wanted to catch the chest instead.\nI tripped him up--off into the water.  He can swim.  But there is the\ntub--give me hold of the rope--quick!  I will send it out into the\nstream.  He may meet it.\"\n\nDown went all the gathered apples into the water, within the wall, and\noff went the tub outside.  Oliver fastened the line round a heavy stone\nin the wall.\n\n\"I wish I had never screamed!\" exclaimed Mildred.\n\n\"I am sure I wish so too.  You _must_ leave off screaming so, Mildred.\nI am sure I thought you were in the water, in the middle of all that\nsplash, or I should not have been in such a hurry.  If Roger should be\ndrowned, it will be all your doing, for screaming so.\"\n\nMildred did not scream now; but she cried very bitterly.  It was soon\nseen, however, that Roger was safe.  He was swimming in the still water\non the opposite side, and presently landed beside the pony and cow.  He\nleft off wringing the wet out of his hair and clothes, to shake both his\nfists at Oliver in a threatening way.\n\n\"Oh, look at him!  He will kill you!\" cried Mildred.  \"I never will\nscream again.\"\n\n\"Never mind, as long as he is safe,\" said Oliver.  \"I don't care for his\nshaking his fists.  It was my business to save you, before caring about\nhim, or all the chests in the Levels.  Never mind now, dear.  You wont\nscream again without occasion, I know.  What made you do so?  You can't\nthink what a shriek it was.  It went through my head.\"\n\n\"Part of the wall fell; and the whole of it shakes so, I am sure it will\nall be down presently.  I wish we were at home.  But what shall we ever\ndo about Roger?  He will kill you, if you go near him: and he can't stay\nthere.\"\n\n\"Leave Roger to me,\" said Oliver, feeling secretly some of his sister's\nfear of the consequences of what had just passed.  He stepped on the\nwall, and was convinced that it was shaking,--almost rocking.  He\ndeclared that it was quite unsafe, and that he must look to the\nremaining walls before they slept another night in the building.\nMildred must get upon the raft immediately.  What was that heap of blue\ncloth?\n\nMildred explained, and the cloth was declared too valuable to be left\nbehind.  Two pairs of hands availed to pull up the end which stuck under\nwater, and then the children found themselves in possession of a whole\npiece of home-spun.\n\n\"May we use it?  We did not make it, or buy it,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"I thought of that too,\" replied her brother.  \"We will see about that.\nIt is our business to save it, at any rate; so help me with it.  How\nheavy it is with the water!\"\n\nThey pulled a dozen apples, and rowed away home with their prize.\n\nAilwin said, as she met them on the stairs, that she was glad enough to\nsee them home again; and more especially without Roger.\n\n\"Roger must be fetched, however,\" said Oliver, \"and the sooner the\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Oh not yet!\" pleaded Mildred.  \"He is so angry!\"\n\n\"That is the very thing,\" said Oliver.  \"I want to show him that I\ntripped him over, not in anger, but because I could not help it.  He\nwill never believe but that it was malice, from beginning to end, if I\ndo not go for him directly.\"\n\n\"But he will thrash you.  You know he can.  He is ever so much stronger\nthan you; and he is in such a passion, I do not know what he may not\ndo.\"\n\n\"What can I do?\" said Oliver.  \"I can't leave him there, standing\ndripping wet, with the cow and the pony.\"\n\n\"Would it be of any use if I were to go with you, and say it was all my\nfault?\" asked Mildred, trembling.\n\n\"No, no; you must not go.\"\n\n\"I would go, if there was no water between, and if Mildred would take\ncare of the baby,\" said Ailwin.\n\n\"Oh do,--do go!  You are so strong!\" said both the children.\n\n\"Why, you see, I can't abide going on the water, any way, and never\ncould: and most of all without so much as a boat.\"\n\n\"But I will row you as carefully,\" said Oliver, \"as safely as in any\nboat.  You see how often we have crossed, and how easy it is.  You\ncannot think what care I will take of you, if you will go.\"\n\n\"Then there's the coming back,\" objected Ailwin.  \"If I am on board the\nsame raft with Roger, we shall all go to the bottom, that's certain!\"\n\n\"How often have I been to the bottom?  And yet I have been on the raft\nwith Roger, ever since it was made.\"\n\n\"Well, and think how near Mildred was going to the bottom, only just\nnow.  I declare I thought we had seen the last of her.\"\n\n\"Roger had nothing to do with that, you know very well.  But I will tell\nyou how we can manage.  You can carry your pail over, and,--(never mind\nits being so early)--you can be milking the cow while I bring Roger over\nhere; and I can come back for you.  That will do,--wont it?  Come,--\nfetch your pail.  Depend upon it that is the best plan.\"\n\nMildred remembered, with great fear, that by this plan Roger would be\nleft with her and George while Oliver went to fetch Ailwin home: but she\ndid not say a word, feeling that she who had caused the mischief ought\nnot to object to Oliver's plan for getting out of the scrape.  She need\nnot have feared that Oliver would neglect her feelings.  Just before he\nput off with Ailwin and her milk-pail, he said to his sister--\n\n\"I shall try to set Roger down somewhere, so that he cannot plague you\nand George; but you had better bolt yourself into the room up-stairs\nwhen you see us coming; and on no account open the door again till I bid\nyou.\"\n\nMildred promised, and then sat down with George asleep on her lap, to\nwatch the event.  She saw Ailwin make some odd gestures as she stood on\nthe raft, balancing herself as if she thought the boards would gape\nunder her feet.  Oliver paddled diligently, looking behind him oftener\nand oftener, as he drew near the landing-place, as if to learn what\nRoger meant to do when they came within his reach.\n\nThe moment the boys were within arm's length of each other, Roger sprang\nfuriously upon Oliver, and would have thrown him down in an instant, if\nOliver had not expected this, and been upon his guard.  Oliver managed\nto jump ashore; and there the boys fought fiercely.  There could be no\ndoubt from the beginning which would be beaten,--Roger was so much the\ntaller and stronger of the two, and so much the less peaceable in all\nhis habits than Oliver: but yet Oliver made good fight for some time,\nbefore he was knocked down completely.  Roger was just about to give his\nfallen enemy a kick in the stomach, when Ailwin seized him, and said she\nwas not going to see her young master killed before her face, by boy or\ndevil, whichever Roger might be.  She tripped him up; and before Oliver\nhad risen, Roger lay sprawling, with Ailwin kneeling upon him to keep\nhim down.  Roger shouted out that they were two to one,--cowards, to\nfight him two to one!\n\n\"I am as sorry for that as you can be,\" said Oliver, dashing away the\nblood which streamed from his nose.  \"I wish I were as old and as tall\nas you: but I am not.  And this is no fighting for play, when it would\nnot signify if I was beaten every day for a week.  Here are Mildred and\nthe baby; I have to take care of them till we know what has become of my\nfather and mother: and if you try to prevent me, I will get Ailwin, or\nanybody or thing I can, to help me, sooner than they shall be hurt.  If\nfather and mother ever come back to take care of Mildred, I will fight\nyou every day till I beat you, and let nobody interfere: but till then,\nI will go to Mildred as often as she calls, if you drown for it, as I\nshowed you this morning.\"\n\nRoger answered only by fresh kicks and struggles.  Ailwin said aloud\nthat she saw nothing for it but leaving him on this spit of land, to\nstarve on the dunghill.  There would be no taking him over to the house\nin this temper.  Roger vowed he would drown all the little pigs, and\nhough the cow.  He had done such a thing before; and he would do it\nagain; so that they should not have a drop more milk for George.\n\n\"That will never do,\" said Oliver.  \"Ailwin, do you think we could get\nhim over to the Red-hill?  He would have plenty to eat there, and might\ndo as he pleased, and be out of our way and the cow's.  I could carry\nhim his dog.\"\n\nAilwin asked Oliver to bring her the cord from off the raft, and they\ntwo could tie up the boy from doing mischief.  Oliver brought the cord,\nbut he could not bear to think of using it so.\n\n\"Come, now, Roger,\" said he, \"you picked this quarrel; and you may get\nout of it in a moment.  We don't want to quarrel at such a time as this.\nNever mind what has happened.  Only say you wont meddle between me and\nthe others while the flood lasts; and you shall help me to row home, and\nI will thank you.  After all, we can fight it out some other day, if you\nlike.\"\n\nMore kicks from Roger.  No other answer.  So Oliver and Ailwin tied his\narms and legs with the cord; and then Ailwin proceeded to milk the cow,\nand Oliver, after washing his face, to give the pony some more hay, and\nsee how the little pigs went on.  The animals were all drooping, and\nespecially the cow.  Oliver wished to have given the pigs some of her\nmilk, as the poor sow seemed weak and ill; but the cow gave so very\nlittle milk this afternoon, that there was none to spare.  Her legs\ntrembled as she stood to be milked; and she lay down again, as soon as\nAilwin had done.\n\n\"The poor thing ain't long for this world,\" said Ailwin.  \"Depend upon\nit that boy has bewitched her.  I don't believe she trembles in that way\nwhen he is on the other side of the water.\"\n\n\"You will see that in the morning,\" said Oliver.  \"Shall we take him on\nthe raft now?  I don't like to carry him tied so, for fear he should\nthrow himself about, and roll over into the water.  He would certainly\nbe drowned.\"\n\n\"Leave that to him, Oliver: and take my word for it, that boy was never\nmade to be drowned.\"\n\n\"You thought the same about Stephen, you know; and he is drowned, I am\nafraid.\"\n\n\"Neither you nor I know that.  I will believe it when I see it,\" said\nAilwin with a wise look.\n\nIt was now Roger's mood to lie like one dead.  He did not move a muscle\nwhen he was lifted, and laid on the raft.  Ailwin was so delighted to\nsee the boy she was so afraid of thus humbled, that she could not help\ngiving his face a splash and rub with the muddy water of the stream as\nhe lay.\n\n\"Ailwin, for shame!\" cried Oliver.  \"I will fight you next, if you do\nso.  You know you durst not, if his hands were free.\"\n\n\"To be sure, Oliver, that is the very reason.  One must take one's\nrevenge while one can.  However, I wont notice him any more till you\ndo.\"\n\n\"Cannot you set down your pail, and help me to row?\" asked Oliver.  He\nwas quite tired.  The raft was heavy now; his nose had not left off\nbleeding, and his head ached sadly.  Three pulls from Ailwin brought\nthem nearer home than all Oliver's previous efforts.  He observed that\nthey must get round the house, if possible, and into the stream which\nran through the garden, so as to land Roger on the Red-hill.\n\nThere was not much difficulty in getting round, as everything like a\nfence had long been swept away.  As they passed near the entrance-door\nto the garden, they observed that the waters were still sinking.  They\nstood now only half-way up the door-posts.  Oliver declared that when he\nwas a little less tired, he would go through the lower rooms in a tub,\nand see whether he could pick up anything useful.  He feared, however,\nthat almost everything must have been swept off through the windows, in\nthe water-falls that Mildred had thought so pretty, the first day of the\nflood.\n\n\"There is a chest!\" exclaimed Oliver, pointing to a little creek in\nwhich a stout chest had stuck.  \"Roger, I do believe it is the very\nchest that ... that we began our quarrel about.  Come, now, is not this\na sign that we ought to make it up?\"\n\nRoger would not appear to hear: so his companions made short work of it.\nThey pulled in for the shore of the Red-hill, and laid Roger on the\nslimy bank:--for they saw no occasion to carry one so heavy and so sulky\nup to the nice bed of grass which was spread at the top of the red\nprecipice that the waters had cut Oliver knew that there was a knife in\nRoger's pocket.  He took it out, cut the cord which tied his wrists, and\nthrew the knife to a little distance, where Roger could easily reach it\nin order to free his legs; but not in time to overtake them before they\nshould have put off again.\n\nRoger made one catch at Oliver's leg, but missing it, lay again as if\ndead; and Ailwin believed he had not yet stirred when the raft rounded\nthe house again, with the great chest in tow.\n\nMildred was delighted to see them back, and especially without Roger.\nShe thought Oliver's face looked very shocking, but Oliver would not say\na word about this, or anything else, till he had found Roger's dog, and\ngone over in the basket, to set him ashore with his master.\n\n\"There!\" said he, as he stepped in at the window when this was\naccomplished, \"we have done their business.  There they are, in their\ndesert island, as they were before.  Now we need not think any more\nabout them, but attend to our own affairs.\"\n\n\"Your face, Oliver!  Pray do--\"\n\n\"Never mind my face, dear, if it does not frighten poor Geordie.  How is\npoor Geordie?\"\n\n\"I do not think he is any better.  I never saw him so fretful, and so\nhot and ill.  And he cries so dreadfully!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. NEW QUARTERS.\n\nAilwin presently made George's supper, with milk, a little thickened\nwith meal.  They were all about the child, watching how he would take\nit, when a loud crack was heard.\n\n\"What is that?\" cried Oliver.\n\n\"It is a crack,\" said Ailwin, \"in the wall or somewhere.  I heard just\nsuch a one while Mildred was gone out to play, after dinner.\"\n\n\"And there was another while you were away,\" said Mildred.  \"Some\nplaster fell that time:--look here!  In this corner.--What is the\nmatter, Oliver?  What makes you look so frightened?  What does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means, I am afraid, that more of the house is coming down.  Look at\nthis great zigzag crack in the wall!--and how loose the plaster hangs in\nthat part of the ceiling!  I really think,--I am quite sure, we ought\nnot to stay here any longer.\"\n\n\"But where can we go?  What shall we do?\"\n\n\"We must think about that, and lose no time.  I think this room will\nfall very soon.\"\n\nMildred could not help crying, and saying that they could not settle\nthemselves, and rest at all.  She never saw anything like it.  They were\nall so tired they did not know what to do; and now they should have to\nwork as hard as ever.  She never saw anything like it.\n\n\"No, dear, never,\" said her brother: \"and thousands of people, far older\nthan you, never saw anything like this flood.  But you know, Mildred, we\nmust not die, if we can help it.\"\n\nThis reminded Mildred who it was that set them these heavy tasks,--that\nbade them thus labour to preserve the lives He gave.  She was silent.\nOliver went on--\n\n\"If ever we meet father and mother again, we shall not mind our having\nbeen ever so much tired now.  We shall like telling them all our plans\nand doings, if it should please God that we should ever sit with them by\nthe fire-side.\"\n\n\"Or whenever we meet them in heaven, if they should not be alive now,\"\nsaid Mildred.\n\n\"Yes, dear; but we will talk over all that when we get to the\nRed-hill:--we must not talk any more now, but set to work.  However, I\nreally think, Mildred, that father and mother are still alive somewhere.\nI feel as if they were.\"\n\n\"But the Red-hill,\" said Mildred, \"what do you mean about the Red-hill?\nWe are not going there, where Roger is,--are we?\"\n\n\"We must, dear.  There is no other place.  Roger is very unkind: but\nfloods and falling houses are unkinder still.  Come, Ailwin, help me\nwith the raft.  We must carry away what we can before dark.  There will\nbe no house standing to-morrow morning, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Sleep on the ground!\" exclaimed Ailwin.  \"Without a roof to cover us!\nMy poor grandfather little thought I should ever come to that.\"\n\n\"If you will move the beds, you need not sleep on the bare ground,\" said\nOliver.  \"Now, Ailwin, don't you begin to cry.  Pray don't.  You are a\ngrown-up woman, and Mildred and I are only children.  You ought to take\ncare of us, instead of beginning to cry.\"\n\n\"That is pretty true,\" said Ailwin: \"but I little thought ever to sleep\nwithout a roof over my head.\"\n\n\"Come, come, there are the trees,\" said Oliver.  \"They are something of\na roof, while the leaves are on.\"\n\n\"And there is all that cloth,\" said Mildred; \"that immensely long piece\nof cloth.  Would not that make a tent, somehow?\"\n\n\"Capital!\" cried Oliver.  \"How well we shall be off with a cloth tent!\nIt seems as if that cloth was sent on purpose.  It is so spoiled\nalready, that we can hardly do it any harm.  And I am sure the person\nthat wove it would be very glad that it should cover our heads to-night.\nI shall carry it and you across before anything else--this very minute.\nI will run down and bring the raft round to the door below.  The water\nis low enough now for you to get out that way.--Oh dear!  I wish I was\nnot so tired!  I can hardly move.  But I must forget all that; for it\nwill not do to stay here.\"\n\nWhile he was gone, Mildred asked Ailwin whether she was very tired.\n\n\"Pretty much; but not so bad as he,\" replied Ailwin.\n\n\"Then do not you think you and I could fetch off a good many things,\nwhile he watches Geordie on the grass?  If you thought you could row the\nraft, I am sure I could carry a great many things down-stairs, and land\nthem on the hill.\"\n\nAilwin had no doubt she could row, in such a narrow and gentle stream as\nnow ran through the garden.\n\nShe made the trial first when Oliver was on board, and several other\ntimes with Mildred, succeeding always very well.  Oliver was extremely\nglad of this; for the bridge-basket had been used so much, and sometimes\nfor such heavy weights, that it was wearing out, and might break down at\nany moment.  The bridge-rope, too, being the stoutest cord they had, was\nvery useful for tying the raft to the trunk of the beech, so that it\ncould not be carried away.  When once this rope was well fastened,\nOliver was content to rest himself on the grass beside Geordie, and let\nthe strong Ailwin and little Mildred work as they wished.  It surprised\nhim, well as he knew Ailwin, to see the loads she could carry, bringing\na good-sized mattress up the bank as easily as he could have carried a\npillow.  She wrung the wet out of the long piece of home-spun, and\nspread it out in the sun, to dry as much as it could before dark, and\nseemed to think no more of it than Mildred did of washing her doll's\npetticoat.\n\nMildred took charge of the lighter articles that required care--her\nmother's china, for one thing; for it was found that nothing made of\nearthenware remained unbroken in the lower rooms.  There were some\npewter plates, which were now lodged under the beech, together with pots\nand pans, knives and forks, and horn spoons.  There was no table light\nenough to be moved, but a small one of deal, which Ailwin dragged out\nfrom under water, with all its legs broken: but enough of it remained\nentire to make it preferable to the bare ground for preparing their food\non, when once it should be dry.  There was a stool a-piece--not\nforgetting one for Roger; and Mildred took care that Geordie should have\nhis own little chair.  Not even Ailwin could carry a chest of drawers:\nbut she carried down the separate drawers, with the clothes of the\nfamily in them.  No one of the household had ever seen a carpet; but\nthere was matting on some of the floors.  Ailwin pulled up pieces of\nthis, to be some protection against the damp and insects of the ground.\n\n\"It is as wet as water now,\" said she; \"but we must not quarrel with\nanything to-day on that account; and matting will dry on the hill better\nthan at home.  If it turns out rotten, we must try and spare a piece of\nthe cloth from overhead, to lay underfoot: but George will feel it more\nlike home, if he has a bit of matting to trip his little foot against.\"\n\nSo down-stairs went a great bundle of wet matting.\n\n\"Will not that do for to-night?\" asked Oliver, languidly, as he saw\nAilwin preparing to put off again, when the sun was just touching the\nwestern hills.  \"You know we have to put up the tent, and get something\nto eat before we can go to sleep; and it has been such a long, long\nday!\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said Ailwin; \"but you said the house would be down in\nthe night; and there are many things yet that we should be sorry to have\nto do without.\"\n\n\"Never mind them:--let them go, I am sure we all want to be asleep more\nthan anything else.\"\n\n\"Sleep, indeed!  Do you suppose I shall sleep with that boy hid among\nthe trees?  Not I, you may rely upon it.  Those may that can: and I will\nwatch.\"\n\nNo one had yet mentioned Roger, though all felt that his presence was a\nterrible drawback to the comfort of their establishment on the hill,\nwhich might otherwise be, in fine weather, a tolerably pleasant one.  It\nmade Oliver indignant to think that a stout lad, whom they had wished to\nmake welcome to all they had, in their common adversity, should be\nskulking in the wood as an enemy, instead of helping them in their\nlabours, under circumstances in which all should be friends.  This\nthought made Oliver so angry that he did not choose to speak of Roger.\nWhen Ailwin offered to seek him out, and do her best to tie his limbs\nagain, and carry him away to any place the children chose, Oliver begged\nher to say no more about it; and observed that they had better forget\nRoger altogether, if they could, unless he should come to make peace.\n\nThere was one, however, who could not for a moment forget who was the\ncause of the late quarrel.  Mildred was very unhappy at the thought of\nthe mischief she had done by her shriek.  Not all her hard toil of this\nevening could console her.  When the cloth had been spread over the\nlower branches of a great ash, so as to shelter the party, in a careless\nway, for this one night (when there was no time to make a proper tent),\nand while Ailwin was heating something for supper, and Oliver dozing\nwith George on one of the beds, Mildred stole away, to consider whether\nthere was anything that she could do to cure Roger's anger.  It did her\ngood, at least, to sit down and think about it.  She sat down under a\ntree, above where the bee-shed had stood.  The moon had just risen, and\nwas very bright, being near the full.  The clouds seemed to have come\ndown out of the sky, to rest upon the earth; for white vapours, looking\nas soft as wreaths of snow, were hovering over the wide waste of waters.\nSome of these were gently floating or curling, while others brooded\nstill, like large white birds over their hidden nests.  It seemed to\nMildred's eye, however, as if a clear path had been cut through these\nmists, from the Red-hill to the moon on the horizon, and as if this path\nhad been strewed with quivering moonbeams.  She forgot, while gazing,\nthat she was looking out upon the carr,--upon muddy waters which covered\nthe ruins of many houses, and in which were hidden the bodies of drowned\nanimals, and perhaps of some people.  She looked upon the train of\ntrembling light, and felt not only how beautiful it was, but that He\nwhose hand kindled that mild heavenly lamp, and poured out its rays\nbefore his children's eyes, would never forget and forsake them.  While\neverything was made so beautiful as to seem ordered for the pleasure of\nmen, their lives and common comforts could not be overlooked.  So plain\ndid this now appear to Mildred, that she felt less and less anxious and\nfearful; and, after a time, as if she was afraid of nothing at all, and\ncould never be afraid again.\n\nShe determined to go and seek Roger,--not with any wish like Ailwin's,\nthat he could be bound by force, and carried away, to be alone and\nmiserable,--but with a much happier hope and purpose.  She did not think\nhe would hurt her; but, if he did, she had rather that he should strike\nher than that Oliver and he should fight, day after day, as Ailwin had\nwhispered to her they meant to do.  She did not believe he could come to\nblows with Oliver again, after she had taken all the blame upon herself.\nSo she set forth to do so.\n\nShe went on quickly enough while she was upon the slope, in the full\nmoonlight, and with the blaze of Ailwin's fire not far off on her right\nhand.  But she felt the difference when she entered the shade of the\ntrees.  It was rather chilly there, and very silent.  There was only a\nrustle in the grass and brambles about her feet, as if she disturbed\nsome small animals hidden there.  When she thought she was far enough\naway from her party not to be heard by them, she began to call softly,\nhoping that Roger might presently answer, so that she should not have to\ngo much further into the darkness.  But she heard nothing but her own\nvoice, as she called, \"Roger!  Where are you, Roger?  I want to speak to\nyou.\"\n\nFurther and further on she went; and still there was no reply.  Though\nshe knew every inch of her way, she tripped several times over the roots\nof the trees; and once she fell.  She saw the stars in the spaces of the\nwood, as she looked up, and knew that she should soon come out upon the\ngrass again.  But when she did so, she found it almost as dark as in the\nwood, though the moon shone on the waters afar.  She still went on\ncalling Roger--now a little louder, till she stumbled over something\nwhich was not the root of a tree, for it was warm, and it growled.\n\n\"Bishop!\" she exclaimed, in alarm; for next to Roger, she had always\nbeen afraid of Roger's dog.\n\n\"Why don't you call him Spy?\" said Roger's voice, from the ground just\nbefore her.  \"What business have you to call him by his wrong name?--how\nis he ever to learn his name if people come calling him by the wrong\none?  Get away--will you?  I know what I'll do if you come here,\nspoiling my dog.\"\n\n\"I will go back directly when I have said one thing.  It was all my\nfault that you and Oliver quarrelled this morning.  I was frightened,\nand screamed when I ought not; and it is my fault that you are not now\nby our fire, getting your supper with us, in our tent. I am sure, I wish\nyou were there.\"\n\n\"Very fine,\" said Roger.  \"He knows I thrashed him; and he does not want\nany more of it.  But I'll thrash him as long as I live; I tell you\nthat.\"\n\n\"Oliver does not know about my coming--he is asleep in the tent,\"\nprotested Mildred.  \"Nobody knows of my coming.  I don't believe Oliver\nwould have let me come, if he had known it.  Only go and look yourself;\nand you will see how he lies asleep on the grass.  We know you can beat\nhim in fighting, because you are so much bigger; and that is why I\ncannot bear that he should fight.  It was all about me this time; and I\nknow he will never give up; and I don't know how long it will be before\nhe is big enough to thrash you.\"\n\n\"Long enough, I can tell you: so get away, and let me go to sleep; or\nI'll thrash you too.\"\n\n\"How can you talk so, Roger, and keep your anger so, when we are all so\nunhappy?  I did not wonder much before, when Ailwin had to help\nOliver...  That was enough to make you or anybody be angry.  But now,\nwhen I come to tell you how sorry I am, and that I know, if I ask\nOliver, that he will be glad to forget everything, and that you should\ncome to supper with us, instead of lying here in the dark, with nothing\nto eat, I do think you ought to forgive and forget; to forgive me, and\nforget all about thrashing Oliver.\"\n\nRoger made no answer.\n\n\"Good-bye, Roger,\" said Mildred.  \"I am sorry that you choose to lie\nhere, hungry and cold, instead of...\"\n\n\"What business have you in my island?\" interrupted Roger, fiercely.\n\"How dared you settle upon my ground, to mock me with your fire and your\nsupper?  I'll have my fire and my supper too.\"\n\n\"I hope you will, if you will not come to ours.  We were obliged to\nsettle here--the house is all cracking, and falling to pieces.  We were\nvery sorry to come,--we were all so tired;--but we dared not stay in the\nhouse.\"\n\nRoger uttered an exclamation which showed that a new light had broken\nupon him, as to the causes of their removal.\n\n\"Poor Geordie is so ill, we were most sorry to have to move him.  The\ntime will come, Roger, though you don't think so now, when you will be\nvexed that while we cannot tell whether father and mother are alive or\ndead, and whether George will live or die, you put the pain of quarrels\nupon us too.\"\n\n\"Well, get you gone now!\" said Roger, not immediately discovering that\nshe was some paces on her way home again before he said that much.\n\nMildred heard Ailwin calling her to supper, as she drew near the tent.\nShe did not say where she had been; but perhaps she was more on the\nwatch, in consequence of what had passed.  She soon saw that Roger was\nsauntering under the trees; and indeed what she had said, and what he\nnow saw together, had altered Roger's mind.  He was hungry, and once\nmore tired of being alone and sulky.  He was thinking how comfortable\nthe fire and the steaming kettle looked, and considering how he should\nmake his approach, when Mildred jumped up, and came running to him.\n\n\"They don't know that I came to find you,\" said she.  \"Oliver will think\nit so kind of you to come and be friends!  He will be so pleased!  And\nthere is plenty of supper for everybody.\"\n\nShe ventured to put her hand in his, and lead him forwards into the\nlight.  She told Oliver that Roger was willing to forgive and forget;\nand Oliver said that he was quite willing too.  Oliver set a stool for\nRoger, and offered him his own basin of broth.  Ailwin held her\ntongue;--which was the most that could be expected of her.\n\nRoger did not quite know what to say and do, when he had finished his\nsupper, and fed Spy.  He swung his legs, as he sat upon his stool,\nstared into the fire, and began to whistle.  Roger's shrillest whistle,\nas it had been sometimes heard in the carr, was anything but agreeable:\nbut his low whistle, when he was not thinking about it, was soft and\nsweet.  A gentle chuckle was soon heard from George, as he lay across\nMildred's knees.\n\n\"He likes it!  He likes such a whistle as that!\" exclaimed Mildred.  Her\neyes said to Roger, \"Do go on!\"\n\nRoger went on whistling, better and better,--more and more softly, he\ndrawing nearer, till he quite bent over the poor sick child, who, after\nmany signs of pleasure, dropped off into a sleep,--a quiet, sound sleep.\n\n\"Thank you!\" said Oliver, heartily.  \"Thank you, Roger!\"\n\n\"You will do it again to-morrow, will not you, if he should be fretful?\"\nsaid Mildred.\n\nRoger nodded.  Then he made the cloth drapery hang better over the\npillows on which the child was laid,--so as to keep off the dew\ncompletely, he said.  Then he nodded again, when Oliver gave him a\nblanket: and once more he nodded good night, before he rolled himself up\nin it under a neighbouring tree.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. ONE PRISONER RELEASED.\n\nIn the morning, it appeared that it had been right to remove to the\nRed-hill the night before.  Only some fragments of the roof of the house\nremained.  Some beams and a quantity of rubbish had fallen into the room\nwhere the party had lived since the flood came; and a heap of this\nrubbish lay on the very spot where Mildred would have been sleeping if\nthey had stayed.  All saw and considered this with awe.  Roger himself\nlooked first at the little girl, and then at that part of the ruin, as\nif imagining what it would have been for her to be lying there, and\nwondering to see her standing here, alive and unhurt.\n\n\"Look how that wall stands out;\" said Oliver.  \"The faster the house\nfalls, the more haste we must make to save what we can.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Cannot you stay quietly to-day?\" asked Mildred.  \"I think we have\ngot all we really want; and this bustle and hurry and hard work every\nday are so tiresome!  Cannot we keep still and rest to-day?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, dear,\" replied her brother.  \"To-morrow is Sunday!  And we\nwill try to rest.  But there is no knowing how long we may have to live\nin this place, in the middle of the waters; and it is my duty to save\neverything I can that can make George and you and the rest of us\ncomfortable when the colder weather comes on.\"\n\n\"I wonder what all the world is about, that nobody comes to see after\nus,\" said Mildred, sighing.\n\n\"Out of sight, out of mind, Mildred,\" said Ailwin.  \"That is the way,\nall the world over.\"\n\n\"I am sure it is not,\" said Oliver.  \"Mildred and I say as little as we\ncan about father and mother, but don't you imagine such a thing as that\nthey are out of our minds.  I know Mildred never shuts her eyes, but she\nsees the mill floating away, as it did that evening, and father\nstanding...\"\n\nHe could not go on about that.  Presently he said, \"When the flood came,\nI suppose, there were no boats to be had.  It would take the first day\nto bring them from a distance, and get them afloat.  Then the people\nwould look round (as they ought to do) to see where they could do most\ngood.  Nobody who looked through a glass this way, since the day before\nyesterday, and saw those rafters sticking up in the air,--the house in\nruins as it is,--would suppose that any one could be left alive here.\nFrom a distance, they can hardly fancy that even any little mouse could\nhelp being either drowned or starved.  This will be about the last spot\nin the Levels that any boat will come to.--You see, Mildred, our\nRed-hill, though it is everything to us, is but a speck compared with\nthe grounds that have stood above water since the waters began to sink.\nWe had better not think of anything but living on as we can, unless it\nshould please God that we should die.\"\n\nRoger did not want to hear anything more of this kind; so he went to\nwhere George was lying, and began to whistle softly to him.  The child\nwas so altered that his own mother would hardly have known him: but he\nsmiled when he heard the whistle; and the smile was his own.  He put up\nhis hand and patted Roger's face, and even pulled his hair with a good\nstout pull.  Roger had been used to nurse his dog, though not little\nchildren.  He now took George into his arms, and laid him comfortably\nacross his knees, while he whistled till the little fellow looked full\nin his face, and puckered up his poor white lips, as if he would whistle\ntoo.  This made Roger laugh aloud; and then George laughed.  Ailwin\nheard them, and peeped into the corner of the tent where they were.  She\nflew to Oliver, to tell him that Roger was at his tricks worse than\never,--he was bewitching the baby.  She was angry at Oliver for telling\nhis sister, when he had looked in too, that they might have been very\nglad any of them, to bewitch poor baby in this manner, when he was\ncrying so sadly all yesterday.  Mildred, for her part, ran to thank\nRoger, and say how glad she should be to be able to whistle as he could.\n\n\"How should you?\" said Roger,--\"you who never had a dog, or caught any\nsort of a bird in your life, I dare say.\"\n\n\"No, I never could.  One day, long ago, when mother was very busy, and I\nwas tired of playing, she gave me some salt into my hand, and told me I\nmight put it upon the birds' tails in the garden, and so catch them: but\nI did not get one.  At last, half the salt was spilt, and the other half\nwas melted in my hand; and then dinner was ready.  I suppose that was a\njoke of mother's.\"\n\n\"She wanted you out of the way; and what a fool you must have been not\nto find that out!  Why, the birds could not have been sillier, if they\nhad let you put the salt upon their tails.\"\n\n\"It was a long while ago,\" pleaded Mildred.  \"Here, take him,\" said\nRoger, popping George into her arms.  \"Show him how to catch birds if\nyou like.  I can't spend my time any longer here.\"\n\n\"How he cries after you!\" exclaimed Mildred.  It was the first time\nRoger had ever known anybody to be sorry for his going away.  The child\nwas certainly crying after him.  He half turned back, but turned again,\nsaying--\n\n\"Can't you tell him I will come again by-and-by?  I must be off now.\"\n\nThe truth was, Roger had never forgotten the chest--the oaken chest\nwhich looked so tempting when he saw it floating down, and Oliver would\nnot stop to catch it,--the stout chest which he knew to be now safe and\nsound somewhere about the house, unless harm had happened to it during\nthe night.  Oliver agreed that it was of importance to bring this chest\non shore: and the boys lost no time in doing it.  Mildred came out with\nGeorge to watch their proceedings, and found that Oliver had already\nmade one trip, and brought over some articles of use and value.  He came\nup to his sister, with something which he held carefully covered up in\nboth hands.  He said gravely--\n\n\"Here, dear, put this in some safe place,--where no one will know of it\nbut you and me.\"\n\n\"A watch!--mother's watch!\"\n\n\"I found it, with several things in her cupboard, thrown down by the\nwall breaking.\"\n\n\"It does not seem to be hurt,\" observed Mildred.  \"And how often you\nhave wished for a watch!\"\n\n\"I think I shall never wish for anything again,\" said Oliver.  Mildred\nsaw his face as he turned away, and began to consider where she could\nput the watch, so that it might be safe, and that Roger might not see\nit, nor Oliver be reminded of it.\n\nAilwin and Roger were meantime disputing about which should have the\nraft first,--Roger wanting to secure the chest, and Ailwin insisting\nthat it was high time the cow was milked.  Oliver said he was master\nhere in his father's absence, and he would have no quarrels.  All three\nshould go on the raft.  Roger should be landed at the staircase, where\nhe could be collecting what he wanted to bring over, while Oliver\nproceeded to set Ailwin ashore beside the cow.  By working to the number\nof three, in harmony, far more would be gained than by using up strength\nin fighting and disputing.  He did not care how many times he crossed\nthe water this day, if those whom he rowed would but keep the peace.  He\nwould willingly be their servant in rowing, though he chose to be their\nmaster in deciding.\n\nAilwin stared at Oliver.  It had struck her, and Mildred too, that\nOliver seemed to have grown many years older since the flood came.  He\nwas no taller, and no stronger;--indeed he seemed to-day to be growing\nweaker with fatigue; but he was not the timid boy he had always appeared\nbefore.  He spoke like a man; and there was the spirit of a man in his\neyes.  It was not a singular instance.  There have been other cases in\nwhich a timid boy has been made a man of, on a sudden, by having to\nprotect, from danger or in sorrow, some weaker than himself.  Roger felt\nsomething of the truth; and this had as much to do with making him quiet\nand tractable to-day as his interest about George, or his liking to live\nin a tent with companions, rather than in the open air and alone.\n\nAilwin was but a short time gone.  She came up the bank to Mildred,\nswinging her empty milk-pail, and sobbing, as if from the bottom of her\nheart.  Mildred did not think she had ever seen Ailwin cry so before;\nand she could imagine nothing now but that Oliver was lost.  She turned\nso giddy in a moment that she could not see Ailwin, and so sick that she\ncould not speak to her.\n\n\"So you have heard, Mildred,--you have heard, I see by your being so\nwhite.  Oliver says she has been dead ever so many hours.  I say, if we\nhad gone the first thing, instead of staring and poking about yon\ntumble-down house, we might have saved her.  I shall never milk her\nagain,--not a drop!--nor any other either, so far as I see; for there is\nno saying that we shall ever get away.  Here I have not a drop of milk\nto give you, my dear, though you are as white as the wall.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" gasped Mildred, \"if it is only the cow.  I thought it had\nbeen Oliver.\"\n\n\"Oliver!  Bless your heart!  There he is as busy about the house and\nthings, as if nothing had happened; and just as provoking as you for\ncaring nothing about the poor cow.  There she lies, poor soul!  Dead and\ncold, half in the water, and half out.  She was worth you two put\ntogether, for some things,--I can tell you that.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am very sorry,\" said Mildred; and as she saw George pulling\nabout the empty can, she melted into tears, which would come faster and\nfaster till Oliver again stood by her side.  She tried to tell him what\nshe had been afraid of, and how she thought she should not have cried\nbut for that;--or, at least, not so much; but she really could not\nexplain what she felt, her sobs came so thick.\n\n\"I do not know exactly what you mean, dear,\" said Oliver; \"but I\nunderstand that you must be crying about the cow.  I am very sorry,--\nvery.  I had rather have lost anything we have left than the cow, now\nGeorge is so ill.\"--Here he bit his lip, and looked away from George,\nlest he should cry like his sister.  He went on, however, talking rather\nquickly at first, but becoming more composed as he proceeded.  He said,\n\"I have been thinking that it will never do for us who may be near\nlosing everything we have, and our lives, after all, to grieve over each\nseparate loss as it happens.  When you said your prayers the first night\nof the flood...\"\n\n\"How long ago that does seem!\" exclaimed Mildred.\n\n\"It does, indeed!\" replied Oliver, glad to hear her say something\ndistinctly.  \"When we said our prayers that night, and whenever we have\nsaid them since, we begged that we might be able to bear dying in this\nflood,--to bear whatever it pleased God to do.  Now, our right way is to\nmake up our minds at once to everything, and just in the way it pleases\nGod.  Let us try to bear it cheerfully, whether we lose the cow or\nanything else first; or whether we all die together.  That is the way,\nMildred!--And if you and I should not die together, that must be the way\ntoo.\"\n\n\"I hope we shall though.\"\n\n\"I think it is very likely; and that before long.  And then how useless\nit will have been to be unhappy about anything we can lose here!  People\nwho may be so near to death need not be anxious about this and that,\nlike those who seem to have long to live.  So come, dear, and see this\nchest; and help us to settle what should be done with it.\"\n\nThere was nothing about the outside of the chest to show whose it might\nbe.  Everybody agreed that it ought to be opened immediately, lest all\nthat it contained should be spoiled by the wet.  But how to open it was\nthe question; for it had a very stout lock, and strong hinges.  After\nmany attempts, it was found that nothing short of proper tools would\nanswer the purpose: and Oliver went to see if his could be reached.\nThrough piles of rubbish, and a puddle of slimy water, he got to the\nspot where he had left them,--hidden behind straw, that the Redfurns\nmight not discover and spoil them.  The straw was washed away, and his\nbeautiful lump of alabaster reduced to slime; but his tools were\nthere,--in no very bright condition, but safe.  He hastened away from\nthe spot; for thoughts crowded upon his mind of the day when he had last\nused these tools, and the way of life in which he and Mildred had been\nso happy, and which seemed now to be over for ever.  He thought of the\nbeautiful stone carvings over the doorway, and of what Pastor Dendel had\nsaid to him about them.  They had fallen; and who knew what had become\nof kind Pastor Dendel?  The garden, with all its fresh green and gay\nblossoms, was now a muddy stream; rank smells and thick mists now came\nup from what had been meadows and corn-fields; and his father, whose\nmanly voice had been daily heard singing from the mill, where was he?\nIt would not do to stay thinking of these things; so Oliver hastened\nback with his tools, and with the heavy kitchen hammer, which he also\nfound.\n\nNone of these would open the chest.  The party managed it at last by\nheating a large nail, which they drew out from a shattered door-post,\nand burning holes in the wood of the chest, close by the nails which\nfastened the hinges, so as to loosen them, and make them drop out.  The\nlid being raised, a great variety of articles was found within, so\nnicely packed that the wet had penetrated but a very little way.\nMildred had looked on thoughtfully; and she saw that Oliver paused when\nthe contents lay open to view.  She looked in her brother's face, and\nsaid--\n\n\"I wonder who this chest belonged to?\"\n\n\"I was just thinking so,\" observed Oliver.\n\n\"Never mind that,\" said Ailwin.  \"We may know, some day or other, or we\nmay not.  Meantime, it is ours.  Come, make haste, and see what there is\nto wrap up poor baby in, on cold nights.\"\n\n\"We will look for something of that sort,--I am sure we might use such a\nthing as that,\" said Oliver: \"but...\"\n\n\"But,\" said Mildred, \"I don't think these other things are ours, any\nmore than they ever were.  Nobody ever gave them to us.  They have\nbelonged to somebody else;--to somebody that may be wondering at this\nmoment where they are.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Mildred!\" exclaimed Ailwin.  \"Who gave you the harness that\nbraces the raft, or the meal you have been living on these two days, I\nwonder: and how do you know but somebody is hungry, and longing for it,\nat this minute?\"\n\n\"I wish they had it, then,\" replied Mildred.  \"But, Oliver, were we\nwrong to use the meal?  I never thought of that.\"\n\n\"Nor I: but I think we were right enough there.  The meal would all have\nbeen spoiled presently; and meal (and the harness too) is a sort of\nthing that we can pay for, or make up for in some way, if ever we can\nmeet with the people who lost that chest.\"\n\n\"And George, and all of us, might have starved without it.\"\n\n\"Yes: we must take what we want to eat, when it comes in our way, and\nthere is nobody to ask leave of: and, if ever we get out of this place,\nwe can inquire who lost a meal-chest or set of harness, and offer to pay\nfor what we took.  But I do think it is different with these things.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Mildred.  \"Those table-cloths, and that embroidered\ncap,--somebody has taken pains to make them, and might not like to sell\nthem.  And look!  Look at Roger!  He has pulled out a great heavy bag of\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Now, Roger, put that bag where you found it,\" said Oliver.  \"It is none\nof yours.\"\n\n\"How do I know that I shall find it again, the next time I look?\"\nreplied Roger, walking off with the bag.\n\nMildred was afraid of Oliver's following him, and of another quarrel\nhappening.  She put her arm within her brother's, and he could easily\nguess why.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, dear,\" he said.  \"If Roger chooses to do a dishonest\nthing, it is his own affair.  We have warned him; and that is all we\nhave to do with it.  We must be honest ourselves,--that is all.\"\n\n\"Then I think we had better not look any further into the chest,\" said\nMildred; \"only just to find something warm to wrap Geordie in.  The\nclothes look so nice--we might fancy we wanted things that we can very\nwell do without.\"\n\n\"I am not much afraid of that,\" replied her brother: \"and it would be a\npity the things should spoil with the damp.  They would be dry in an\nhour in this warm sun; and we could pack them away again before night.\"\n\n\"Roger will never let you do that,\" declared Ailwin.  \"Not a rag will he\nleave to anybody that you don't stow away while he is out of sight.\nNever did I see such perverse children as you, and so thankless for\nGod's gifts.  I should be ashamed to be no more grateful than you for\nwhat He puts into your very hands.\"\n\nMildred looked at her brother now with a different face.  She was\nperplexed and alarmed; but she saw that Oliver was not.\n\n\"Roger cannot carry off anything,\" he replied.  \"He may bury and hide\nwhat he pleases; but they will all be somewhere about the Red-hill; and\nwe can tell anybody who comes to fetch us off whatever we know about the\ngoods.\"\n\n\"Nobody will ever come and fetch us off,\" said Ailwin, beginning to cry.\n\"The people at a distance don't care a straw what becomes of us; and\nyou children here at hand are so perverse and troublesome, I don't know\nhow to bear my life between you.\"\n\n\"If nobody comes to save us,\" said Oliver, calmly, \"I do not see what\ngood this money and these fine clothes will do to Roger and you.\"\n\n\"Roger and me!  Pray what do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I mean that you and he are for taking these things that do not belong\nto us; and Mildred and I are against it.  Only tell me this one thing,\nAilwin.  Do you believe that your cloak and stockings were sent in Nan\nRedfurn's way, that she might take them?  And do you think it would have\nbeen perverse in her not to run away with them?\"\n\n\"Now, Oliver, what nonsense you talk!  As if I wanted a rag of these\nthings for my own wear!  As if I would touch a penny that was not\nhonestly got!\"\n\n\"So I always thought before; and so I shall think now, if you will help\nMildred to dry whatever is damp, and then pack all away safely--all but\nsuch things as may do poor Geordie good.\"\n\nRoger was not long in finding a hole in a tree where he could hide his\nbag of money.  He cut a small cross in the bark by which he might know\nthe tree again, and hastened back, to see what else he could secure.  He\nfound plenty of pretty things hanging on the bushes, and did not wait\nfor their being quite dry to dress himself as he had never been dressed\nbefore.  With the embroidered cap above mentioned on his head, a scarlet\nwaistcoat, worked with silver thread, hanging loose about his body, and\na light blue coat, whose skirts reached his heels, he looked so little\nlike the dirty ragged Roger, that Geordie shrank back from him, at first\nsight, and did not smile till he heard the soft whistle again.  After\nthat, he seemed more pleased with the finery than all the rest of the\nparty together.  Ailwin glanced scornfully upon it, as if she had\ndisapproved from the beginning its being touched; and Oliver and Mildred\nlooked grave.\n\nSo very much pleased was Geordie with the gay waistcoat, that Roger took\nhim into his arms, that he might be able to stroke it, and play with the\nsilver flowers.  It was little fatigue, now, except to the spirits, to\nnurse poor George.  He was shrunk to skin and bone, and so light as to\nstartle those who had been accustomed to lift him.  It was grievous,\nhowever, to look at the ghastly stretched features, the flabby tremulous\nlittle arms, and the suffering expression of countenance.  To hear his\nfeeble cry was worse still.  Oliver was really glad to take Mildred away\nfrom seeing and hearing him, as long as the child would be quiet with\nRoger: so he asked her to filter more water through the gravel.  He\nbegged her to get ready a great deal--enough for them all to drink, and\nto bathe George in; for the water about them was becoming of a worse\nquality every day.  It was unsafe even to live near; and much more to\ndrink.  So he scraped up a quantity of clean dry gravel from the ledges\nof the precipice where the first flood had thrown it, and helped Mildred\nto press this gravel down in the worn old basket.  This basket they set\nacross the tub, which they first thoroughly cleaned.  Mildred poured\nwater upon the gravel by degrees; and it was astonishing how much purer\nand better it came out of the tub than it went into the basket.  When\nthe tub was full, Ailwin heated some of the water presently over her\nlarge fire, and made a warm bath for the child.\n\nRoger was unwilling to give him up when the bath was ready, so new and\nso pleasant did he find it to be liked and loved by anybody--to have\npower over any one, so much more easy and delightful to exercise than\nthat of force.  But, not only was the bath ready, and must not be left\nto cool, but Oliver beckoned him away on some very particular business.\n\nThis business was indeed pressing.  All the party had complained that\nthe bad smells about the Red-hill became really oppressive.  They did\nnot know how great was the danger of their all falling ill of fever, in\nconsequence; but every one of them felt languid and uncomfortable.\nOliver made the circuit of the hill, to discover whether there was any\ncause for this evil that could be removed.  He was surprised to find the\nnumber of dead animals that were lying about in holes and corners, as\nwell as the heap of Roger's game, now actually putrefying in the sun.\nThere was also a dead horse thrown up, on the side where the quarry was;\nand about this horse were such swarms of flies as Oliver had never seen.\nIt was to consult about pushing back this horse into the stream, and\nclearing away all other dead things that they could find, that Oliver\nnow called Roger.\n\nRoger was struck with what he observed.  He saw no difficulty in\nclearing away the game he ought never to have left lying in a heap in\nthe sun.  He believed, too, that with stout poles he and Oliver could\nshove the horse into the water; and, with a line tied to its head, tow\nit out of the still water into the current which yet ran from the\nquarry.  But what troubled him more was, that there was evidently a\nmortality among the animals on the hill.  They were dying in all\ndirections; some for want of proper food, and from being put out of\ntheir usual habits: others from being preyed upon by their stronger\nneighbours.  Nothing seemed to thrive but the ravenous birds which came\nin clusters, winging their way over the waters, and making a great\nrustling of their pinions as they descended to perch upon some dead\nanimal, pulling it to pieces before the very eyes of the boys, as they\nstood consulting what to do.  It was a horrid sight: and it brought the\nhorrid thought that soon probably there would be no game left for food\nfor the party; and that what there was meantime might be unwholesome.\nOliver had never imagined that the bold boy, Roger Redfurn, could look so\nalarmed as he did at this moment.\n\n\"Never mind, now, Roger,\" said he, \"what is likely to become of you and\nme.  Wait, and find that out by-and-by.  What I am afraid of is seeing\nMildred look at all as George does now.  Come, let us set to work!\nDon't stand looking up in the sky, in that way.  Help me--do.  Cannot\nSpy help?  Call him; will you?\"\n\n\"We can't get away!\" exclaimed Roger, as if now, for the first time,\nawakened to his situation.  \"Those vile birds--they can go where they\nlike--nasty creatures--and we cannot stir from where we are!\"\n\n\"I wish we had our singing birds back again, instead of these\ncreatures,\" said Oliver.  \"Our shy, pretty, innocent little birds, that\nused to be so pleased to pick up twigs and straws to build their nests\nwith, and be satisfied with the worms and slugs and flies that they\ncleared away from the garden.  I wish we had them, instead of these\nugly, saucy, dirty birds.  But our birds are happier somewhere else, I\ndare say; in some dry, pleasant place among those hills, all sweet with\nflowers, and cool with clear running water.\"\n\n\"They can get there, and we can't.  We can't get out of this hot\nsteaming place: and those hills look further off every day.  I wish my\nuncle had been dead before he brought us down off the moors last time.\nI wish he had, I know.  If I was on the moor now, after the plovers...\"\n\n\"Come, come; forget all that now, and set to work,\" interrupted Oliver.\n\"If you won't call Spy to help, I will see whether he will mind me.\"\n\nSpy came, with some hesitation, in answer to a whistle which was like\nhis master's, but not exactly the same.  His master soon set him to\nwork, and began to work himself, in a sort of desperation.  It was\nastonishing what a clearance was made in a short time.  But it did not\ndo all the good that was expected.  There was so much vegetable decay in\nthe region round, that the floating dead animals off to a distance\ncaused only a partial relief.\n\nWhile the boys were hard at work at their disagreeable task, Mildred was\nenjoying seeing George in his warm bath.  Ailwin held him there, while\nMildred continued her useful business of filtering water, talking to the\nchild all the while.  The poor little fellow soon left off crying, and\nmoved his weak limbs about in the tepid water, trying to splash Ailwin,\nas he had been wont to splash his mother in play, every morning when she\nwashed and dressed him.\n\n\"I am sure it does him a great deal of good,\" exclaimed Mildred.  \"I\nwill filter quantities of water; and he shall have a bath as often as\never it is good for him.  Suppose it should make him well!\"\n\nAilwin shook her head.  She saw how impossible it would be even to keep\na healthy child well in the absence of proper food, in an unwholesome\natmosphere, and without sufficient shelter from the changes of weather\nwhich might come at any hour, and must come soon.  How unlikely it was\nthat a sick baby should recover under such circumstances, she was well\naware.  Yet she little thought how near the end was.\n\nAfter his bath, Geordie lay, nicely covered up, on a mattress under the\ntent.  One or other of his nurses visited, him every few minutes; and\nboth were satisfied that he was comfortably asleep.  The boys came for\nsome dinner, at last; and while Oliver went to wash his hands in clean\nwater, Roger stooped over the child to kiss him.  Before doing so,\nhowever, he started back, and asked Ailwin why the baby's eyes looked so\nstrangely.  They were half closed, and seemed like neither sleep nor\nwaking.  Ailwin sat down on the mattress, and took him into her arms,\nwhile Mildred ran to call Oliver.  The poor child stretched himself\nstiff across Ailwin's knees, and then breathed no more.\n\nWhen Oliver and Mildred came running back, Ailwin was putting her cheek\nnear the child's mouth, to feel if there was indeed no breath.  She\nshook her head, and her eyes ran over with tears.  Oliver kneeled down,\nand put his hand to the heart--it did not beat.  He lifted the wasted\narm--it fell, as if it had never had life in it.  There lay the little\nbody, still unmoved, with the face composed,--the eyes dim and half\nclosed, the ear hearing nothing, the tongue silent, while all were\ncalling on little George to say something he had been fond of saying, to\nhearken to something he had loved to hear, and--all in vain.\n\n\"Whistle to him, Roger!\" exclaimed Mildred, through her trembling.  \"Try\nif he cannot hear that.  Whistle to him softly.\"\n\nRoger tried; but no notice was taken of the forced, irregular whistle\nwhich was the best he could give at the moment.\n\n\"Listen, dear!  Hark, George!  Only hear!\" exclaimed Mildred and Ailwin.\n\n\"O hush!  All of you!\" exclaimed Oliver.  \"Be quiet, Mildred dear!  Our\nlittle brother is dead.\"\n\nRoger threw himself on the grass, and hid his face on his arms.  He\nmoaned and rocked himself about, so that, even in the first moments of\ntheir grief, the brother and sister looked at each other with awe.\n\n\"Come away with me, dear,\" whispered Oliver to his sister.  \"Ailwin,\ngive George to me.  Let me have him in my arms.\"\n\n\"Bless you, my dears; it is not George any longer.  It is a poor little\ndead body.  You must not call it George.\"\n\n\"Give him to me,\" said Oliver.  He took the body from Ailwin's arms,\ncarrying it as gently as if anything could have hurt it now; and he and\nMildred walked away towards the spot where the bee-shed had stood.\nAilwin gazed after them, dashing away the tears with the back of her\nhand, when they gathered so that she could not see.\n\nOliver and Mildred walked on till they could descend the bank a little,\nand sit, just above the waters, where they knew they were out of sight\nof everybody.  This bank presented a strange appearance, such as the\nchildren had been wondering at for some days, till Ailwin remembered\nthat she had often heard say that there was once a thick forest growing\nwhere the Levels were now spread, and that the old trees were, every\none, somehow underground.  It now appeared that this was true.  As the\nearth was washed away in the channel, and cut down along the bank, large\ntrunks of trees were seen lying along, black as coal.  Some others\nstarted out of the bank; and the roots of a few spread like network,\nholding the soil together, and keeping the bank firm in that part.  Upon\none of the trunks, that jutted out, Oliver took his seat; and Mildred\nplaced herself beside him.\n\n\"Let him lie on my knee now,\" said she.\n\n\"Presently,\" said Oliver.  \"How easy and quiet he looks!\"\n\n\"And how quietly he died!\" observed Mildred.  \"I did not think it had\nbeen such an easy thing to die,--or half so easy for us to bear to see.\"\n\n\"The hard part is to come, dear.  We are glad now to see him out of his\npain--so comfortable as he looks at this moment.  The hard part will be\nnot to hear his little voice any more--never ...  But we must not think\nof that now.  I hope, Mildred, that you are not sorry that George is\ndead.  I am not, when I think that he may be with father and mother\nalready.\"\n\n\"Already?\"\n\n\"Yes--if they are dead.  Perhaps they have been pitying poor baby all\nthe time he has been ill, crying and moaning so sadly; and now he may be\nwith them, quite happy, and full of joy to meet them again.\"\n\n\"Then they may be seeing us now.\"\n\n\"Yes; they will not forget us, even the first moment that George's\nlittle spirit is with them.  Do not let them see us sad, Mildred.  Let\nthem see that we are glad that they should have George, when we could do\nnothing for him.\"\n\n\"But we shall miss him so when ...  Oliver!  He must be buried!\"\n\n\"Yes.  When that is done, we shall miss him sadly.  We must expect that.\nBut we must bear it.\"\n\n\"If we die here,\" said Mildred, \"it will be easy to do without, him for\nsuch a little while.  But if we ever get away, if we grow up to be as\nold as father and mother, what shall we do, all those years, without\nonce hearing Geordie laugh, or having him to wake us in the morning?\nWhat long things people's lives are!  It will seem as if ours would\nnever be done, if we have to wait all that time to see Geordie again.\"\n\n\"I wish we were dead!\" sighed Oliver.  \"I am sure, so do I.  And dying\nis so very easy!\"\n\n\"The pastor always said there was nothing to be afraid of,\" said\nOliver--\"I mean, for innocent people.  And Geordie was so innocent, he\nwas fit to go directly to God.\"\n\n\"If we die here,\" said Mildred, \"Roger must too.  What was the matter\nwith him just now, do you think?  Was he thinking about that?\"\n\n\"He was very miserable about something.  Oh, Mildred, do look!  Did you\never see Geordie look sweeter?  Yes, you may have him now.\"\n\nAnd Oliver quietly laid the child in Mildred's arms.  \"Yet,\" said he,\nsighing, \"we must bury him.\"\n\n\"Oh, when?\" asked Mildred.\n\n\"Better do it while his face looks as it does now.  To-morrow is Sunday.\nWe will do no work to-morrow, and bury Geordie.\"\n\n\"Where?  How?\"\n\n\"We will choose the prettiest place we can find, and the quietest.\"\n\n\"I wish the pastor was here,\" said Mildred.  \"I never saw a funeral,\nexcept passing one in the road sometimes.\"\n\n\"We need not be afraid of doing wrong about the funeral, dear.  We must\nmake some kind of little coffin; and Roger will help me to dig a grave,\nand if we have no pastor to say prayers, you and I know that in our\nhearts we shall be thanking God for taking our little brother to be safe\nand happy with him.\"\n\n\"And then I may plant some flowers upon his grave, may not I?  And that\nwill bring the bees humming over it.  How fond he was of going near the\nhives, to hear the bees hum!  Where shall his grave be?\"\n\n\"Under one of the trees, one of the shadiest.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear--here comes Ailwin!  I wish she would let us alone.\"\n\nAilwin was crying too much to speak.  She took the body from Mildred's\narms with a gentle force, kissing the little girl as she did so.  She\ncovered up the baby's face with her apron as she walked away.\n\nThe children went among the trees to fix on a spot for the grave.  They\nfound more than one that they liked; but suddenly remembered that the\nground was hard, and that they had no spade, nor any tool with which\nthey could make a deep hole.\n\nOliver was greatly disturbed at this,--more than he chose to show when\nhe saw how troubled his sister also was.  After thinking for some time\nto no purpose,--feeling that he could not bear to commit the body to the\nfoul flood, and remembering with horror how many animals were scratching\nup the earth all over the Red-hill, where the ground was not too hard,\nand how many odious birds of prey were now hovering in the air, at all\nhours,--after thinking over these things with a heavy heart, he begged\nMildred to go home to Ailwin, and to ask Roger to come to him in the\nwood, to consult what must be done.\n\nMildred readily went: but she hardly liked to speak to Roger when she\nsaw him.  He was watching, with a sulky air, what Ailwin was doing, as\nshe bent over the mattress.  His eyes were red with crying; but he did\nnot seem the more gentle for that.  When Mildred had given her message,\nhe moved as if he thought it a great trouble to go; but Mildred then\nsuspected what was indeed the truth,--that he was unhappy at the child's\ndeath, and was ashamed of appearing so, and put on a gruff manner to\nhide it.  Seeing this, the little girl ran after him, as he sauntered\naway, put her hand in his, and said,--\n\n\"Do help Oliver all you can.  I know how he would have tried to help you\nif George had been your little brother.\"\n\n\"'Tis all the same as if he had been,\" muttered Roger.  \"I'm sure I am\njust as sorry.\"\n\n\"Are you, indeed?\" said Mildred, her eyes now filling with tears.\n\nRoger could not bear to see that; and he hastened away.  Mildred found a\ngreat change when she looked on the baby's face again.  The eyes were\nquite closed, and Ailwin had tied a bandage round his head,--under the\nchin, and among the thick hair which used to curl so prettily, but which\nhad hung straight and damp since he had been ill.  He was now strangely\ndressed, and laid out straight and stiff.  He did not look like Geordie;\nand now Mildred began to know the dreary feelings that death brings into\nfamilies.  She longed for Oliver to come home; and would have gone to\nsee what he was about, but that she did not like to leave the tent and\nthe body while Ailwin was busy elsewhere, which was now the case.\n\nWhen, at length, the boys returned, they reported that, for many\nreasons, there could not be a grave under the trees, as they would have\nliked.  They had hopes of making one which would save the body from the\nflood, and would serve at least till the day (if that day ever came)\nwhen it might be removed to some churchyard.  They had no tools to dig a\ndeep hole with; and if there was a hole, it must be deep: but they found\nthey could excavate a space in the bank, under the trunk of one of the\nlarge buried forest-trees.  They could line this hole with hewn stones\nbrought from the shattered wall of the house, and could close it in also\nwith a stone,--thus making the space at once a coffin and a grave, as\nsecure from beast or bird of prey as any vault under any church-wall.\nOliver had found among the ruins one of the beautiful carved stones\nwhich he had always admired as it surmounted the doorway of their home.\nWith this he meant to close in the little vault.  At some future time,\nif no one should wish to disturb the remains, ivy might be led over the\nface of the bank, and about this sculptured stone; and then, he thought,\neven those who most loved little George could not wish him a better\ngrave.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. GRAVES IN THE LEVELS.\n\nOliver so much wished that the next day (Sunday, and the day of his\nlittle brother's funeral) should be one of rest and decent quiet, that\nhe worked extremely hard, as long as the light lasted, and was glad of\nall the help the rest of the party could give.\n\nTo make an excavation large enough for the body was no difficult task;--\nthe earth being soft, and easily removed from the trunks, roots, and\nbranches of buried trees, which seemed to run all through the interior\nof the bank.  But the five stones with which the grave was to be lined\nwere of considerable thickness; and Oliver chose to have them nicely\nfitted in, that no living creature should be able to enter this place\nsacred to the dead.\n\nHow astonished were they all to find that this was already a place of\nthe dead!  While Ailwin was holding one of the stones against one end of\nthe excavation, and Oliver was striking and fixing it with the great\nhammer, Roger was emptying out soil from the other end.  He exclaimed\nthat he had come upon some large thing made of leather.\n\n\"I dare say you have,\" said Ailwin.  \"There are all manner of things\nfound by those who dig in the Levels--except useful things, I mean.  No\none ever knew anything useful come out of these odd places.\"\n\n\"You are wrong there,\" said Roger.  \"I have got useful things myself\nfrom under the carr, that brought me more money than any fish and fowl I\never took out of the ponds on it.  Uncle and I found some old red\nearthenware things...\"\n\n\"Old red earthenware!\" exclaimed Ailwin.  \"As if old earthenware was\nbetter than fish and fowl, when there is so much new to be had\nnow-a-days!  My uncle is a sailor, always going between this and\nHolland; and he says the quantity of ware they bring over in a year will\nhold victuals for all Lincolnshire.  And Dutch ware does not cost above\nhalf what it did in my grandfather's time: so don't you be telling your\nwonderful tales, Roger.  We sha'n't believe them.\"\n\n\"Well, then don't.  But I say again, uncle Stephen and I took gold for\nthe old red ware we got out of a deep hole in the carr.\"\n\n\"Very likely, indeed.  I wonder who has gold to throw away in that\nmanner.  However, I don't say but there may be such.  `Fools and their\nmoney are soon parted,' some folks say.\"\n\n\"Who gave you the gold?\" asked Oliver.\n\n\"You may ask that,\" said Roger; \"but you may not believe me when I tell\nyou.  You know the Earl of Arundel comes sometimes into these parts.\nWell,--it was he.\"\n\n\"When?  Why?\"\n\n\"He often comes down to see the Trent, having the care of the forests\nupon it: and one time he stopped near here, on his way into Scotland,\nabout some business.  They say he has a castle full of wonderful things\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"What sort of things?\" asked Ailwin.  \"Horn spoons and pewter\ndrinking-mugs to his old red earthenware?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Roger, \"But I heard nothing of them.  What I heard of\nwas old bricks, and stone figures, and all manner of stone jars.  Well,\na gentleman belonging to the Earl of Arundel chanced to come across us,\njust after we had found a pitcher or two down in the moss; and he made\nus go with him to the Earl...\"\n\n\"You don't mean that you ever saw a lord to speak to!\" exclaimed Ailwin,\nturning sharp round upon Roger.\n\n\"I tell you I did, and uncle too.\"\n\nAilwin muttered that she did not believe a word of it; but her altered\nmanner towards Roger at the moment, and ever after, showed that she did.\n\n\"He asked us all manner of questions about the Levels,\" continued\nRoger:--\"I mean about the things that lie in the moss.  He did not seem\nto care about the settlers and the crops, otherwise than in the way of\nbusiness.  All that he did about the earthenware was plainly for his\npleasure.  He bought all we could find on that spot; and he said if we\nfound any more curiosities at any time, we were ...  But I can't stand\ntalking any more.\"\n\nAnd Roger glanced with suspicious eyes from the piece of leather (as he\ncalled it) that he had met with in the bank to Oliver.  He wanted to\nhave the sole benefit of this new discovery.\n\n\"And what were you to do, if you found anything more?\" asked Ailwin.\n\"One might easily bury some of the ware my uncle brings, and keep it in\nthe moss till it is well wetted; and then some earl might give one gold\nfor it.  Come, Roger, tell me what you were to do with your findings.\nYou owe it to me to tell me; considering that your people have got away\nmy cloak and warm stockings.\"\n\n\"Look for them in the moss,--you had better,\" said Roger.  \"You will\nfind them there or nowhere.\"\n\nNot a word more would he say of his own concerns.\n\nOliver did not want to hear more.  On being told of the Earl of\nArundel's statues and vases, he had, for a moment, longed to see them,\nand wondered whether there were any alabaster cups in the collection;\nbut his thoughts were presently with George again.  He remembered that\nMildred had been left long enough alone with the body; and he dismissed\nAilwin, saying that he himself should soon have done, it was now growing\nso dark.\n\nAs he worked on silently and thoughtfully, Roger supposed he was\nobserving nothing; and therefore ventured, turning his back on Oliver,\nto investigate a little more closely the leathern curiosity he had met\nwith.  He disengaged the earth more and more, drew something out, and\nstarted at what he saw.\n\n\"You _have_ found a curiosity,\" observed Oliver, quietly.  \"That is a\nmummy.\"\n\n\"No--'tis a man,\" exclaimed Roger, in some agitation.  \"At least it is\nsomething like a man.  Is not this like an arm, with a hand at the end\nof it?--a little dried, shrunk, ugly arm.  'Tis not stiff, neither.\nLook!  It can't be Uncle Stephen, sure--or Nan!\"\n\n\"No, no: it is a mummy--a human body which has been buried for hundreds\nand thousands of years.\"\n\nRoger had never heard of a mummy; and there was no great wonder in that,\nwhen even Oliver did not rightly know the meaning of the word.  All\nanimal bodies (and not only human bodies) which remain dry, by any\nmeans, instead of putrefying, are called mummies.\n\n\"What do you mean by hundreds and thousands of years?\" said Roger.\n\"Look here, how the arm bends, and the wrist!  I believe I could make\nits fingers close on mine,\" he continued, stepping back--evidently\nafraid of the remains which lay before him.  \"If I was sure now, that it\nwas not Stephen or Nan ...  But the peat water does wonders, they say,\nwith whatever lies in it.\"\n\n\"So it does.  It preserves bodies, as I told you.  I will show you in a\nminute that it is nobody you have ever known.\"\n\nAnd Oliver took from Roger's hand the slip of wood with which he had\nbeen working, and began to clear out more soil about the figure.\n\n\"Don't, don't now!\" exclaimed Roger.  \"Don't uncover the face!  If you\ndo, I will go away.\"\n\n\"Go, then,\" replied Oliver.  It appeared as if the bold boy and the\ntimid one had changed characters.  The reason was that Roger had some\nvery disagreeable thoughts connected with Stephen and Nan Redfurn.  He\nnever forgot, when their images were before him, that they had died in\nthe midst of angry and contemptuous feelings between them and him.\nOliver, on the other hand, was religious.  Though, in easy times, more\nafraid than he ought to have been of dishonest and violent persons, he\nhad yet enough trust in God to support his spirits and his hope in\ntrial, as we have seen: and about death and the grave, and the other\nworld, where he believed the dead went to meet their Maker and Father,\nhe had no fear at all.  Nothing that Roger now said, therefore, made him\ndesist, till he had uncovered half the dried body.\n\n\"Look here!\" said he--for Roger had not gone away as he had\nthreatened--\"come closer and look, or you will see nothing in the dusk.\nDid either Stephen or Nan wear their hair this way?  And is this dress\nanything like Ailwin's cloak?  Look at the long black hair hanging all\nround the little flat brown face.  And the dress: it is the skin of some\nbeast, with the hair left on--a rough-edged skin, fastened with a bit of\nsomething like coal on the left shoulder.  I dare say it was once a\nwooden skewer.  I wonder how long ago this body was alive.  I wonder\nwhat sort of a country this was to live in, at that day.\"\n\nRoger's fear having now departed, his more habitual feelings again\nprevailed.\n\n\"I say,\" said he, returning to the spot, and wrenching the tool from\nOliver's hand; \"I say--don't you meddle any more.  The curiosity is\nmine, you know.  I found it, and it's mine.\"\n\n\"What will you do with it?\" asked Oliver, who saw that, even now, Roger\nrather shrank from touching the limbs, and turned away from the open\neyes of the body.\n\n\"It will make a show.  If I don't happen to see the earl, so as to get\ngold for it, I'll make people give me a penny a piece to see it; and\nthat will be as good as gold presently.\"\n\n\"I wish you would bury it,\" earnestly exclaimed Oliver, as the thought\noccurred to him that the time might come, though perhaps hundreds of\nyears hence, when dear little George's body might be found in like\nmanner.  He could not endure the idea of that body being ever made a\nshow of.\n\nOf course, Roger would not hear of giving up his treasure; and Oliver\nwas walking away, when Roger called after him--\n\n\"Don't go yet, Oliver.  Wait a minute, and I will come with you.\"\n\nOliver proceeded, however, thinking that Roger would have to acquire\nsome courage yet before he could carry about his mummy for a show.\n\nOliver was only going for Mildred--to let her see, before it was quite\ndark, what had been done, and what found.  When they returned, Roger was\nstanding at some distance from the bank, apparently watching his mummy\nas it lay in the cleft that he had cleared.  He started when he heard\nMildred's gentle voice exclaiming at its being so small and so\ndark-coloured.  She next wondered how old it was.\n\nAfter the boys had examined the ground again, and put together all they\nhad heard about the ancient condition of the Levels, they agreed that\nthis person must have been buried, or have died alone in the woods,\nbefore the district became a marsh.  Pastor Dendel had told Oliver about\nthe thick forest that covered these lands when the Romans invaded\nBritain; and how the inhabitants fled to the woods, and so hid\nthemselves there that the Roman soldiers had to cut down the woods to\nget at them; and how the trees, falling across the courses of the\nstreams, dammed them up, so that the surrounding soil was turned into a\nswamp; and how mosses and water-plants grew over the fallen trees, and\nbecame matted together, so that more vegetation grew on the top of that,\ntill the ancient forest was, at length, quite buried in the carr.\nOliver now reminded his sister of all this: and they looked with a kind\nof veneration on the form which they supposed was probably that of an\nancient Briton, who, flying from the invaders, into the recesses of the\nforest, had perished there alone.  There was no appearance of his having\nbeen buried.  No earthen vessels, or other remains, such as were usually\nfound in the graves of the ancients, appeared to be contained in the\nbank.  If he had died lying along the ground, his body would have\ndecayed like other bodies, or been devoured by wild beasts.  Perhaps he\nwas drowned in one of the ponds or streams of the forest, and the body,\nbeing immediately washed over with sand or mud, was thus preserved.\n\n\"What is the use of guessing and guessing?\" exclaimed Roger.  \"If people\nshould dig up George's bones, out of this bank, a thousand years hence,\nand find them lying in a sort of oven, as they would call it, with a\nfine carved stone for one of the six sides, do you think they could ever\nguess how all these things came to be here?\"\n\n\"This way of burying is an accident, such as no one would think of\nguessing,\" said Oliver, sighing.  \"And this dried body may be here, to\nbe sure, by some other accident that we know nothing about.  I really\nwish, Roger, you would cover up the corpse again; at least, till we know\nwhether we shall all die together here.\"\n\nThis was what Roger could never bear to hear of.  He always ran away\nfrom it: and so he did now.  Dark as it was growing, he passed over to\nthe house, and mounted the staircase (which stood as firm as ever, and\nlooked something like a self-supported ladder).  While he was vainly\nlooking abroad for boats, which the shadows of the evening would have\nprevented his seeing if they had been there by hundreds, the brother and\nsister speculated on one thing more, in connection with the spectacle\nwhich had powerfully excited their imaginations.  Mildred whispered to\nOliver--\n\n\"If this old man and George lie together here, I wonder whether their\nspirits will know it, and come together in heaven.\"\n\nThey talked for some time about the difference there must be between the\nthoughts of an ancient Briton, skin-clothed, a hunter of the wolf, and\nliving on the acorns and wild animals of the forest, and the mind of a\nlittle child, reared in the Levels, and nourished and amused between the\nfarm-yard and the garden.  Yet they agreed that there must have been\nsome things in which two so different thought and felt alike.  The sky\nwas over the heads of both, and the air around them, and the grass\nspread under their feet:--both, too, had, no doubt, had relations, by\nwhom they had been beloved: and there is no saying how many things may\nbecome known alike to all, on entering upon the life after death.\nOliver and Mildred resolved that if ever they should see Pastor Dendel\nagain, they would ask him what he thought of all this.  They agreed that\nthey would offer to help Roger to seek for other curiosities, to make a\nshow of; and would give him, for his own, all they could find, if he\nwould but consent to bury this body again, decently, and beside little\nGeorge.\n\nThe supper was eatable to-night; and so was the breakfast on the Sunday\nmorning; and yet Roger scarcely touched anything.  Oliver heard him\ntossing and muttering during the night, and was sure that he was ill.\nHe was ill.  He would not allow that he was so, however; and dressed\nhimself again in the fine clothes he had taken from the chest.  It was\nplain, from his shaking hand and his heavy eye, that he was too weak,\nand his head aching too much for him to be able to do any work;\ntherefore Ailwin helped Oliver to finish the grave.\n\nRoger inquired how the work proceeded: and it appeared that he meant to\nattend the funeral, when he found that it was to be in the afternoon.\nHis companions did not believe him able: and he himself doubted it in\nhis heart, resolved as he was to refuse to believe himself very ill, as\nlong as he could keep off the thought.  He found an excuse, however, for\nlying on the grass while the others were engaged at the grave.  Oliver\nhinted to him, very gently, that Mildred and he had rather see him\ndressed in the shabbiest clothes of his own, than following their little\nbrother to his grave in fine things which they could not but consider\nstolen.  Roger was, in reality, only ashamed; but he pretended to be\nangry; and made use of the pretence to stay behind.  While he lay, ill\nand miserable, remembering that little George alone had seemed to love\nhim, and that George was dead, he believed it impossible that any one\nshould mourn the child as he did in his heart.\n\nOliver himself took something from the chest--carefully and reverently;\nand carefully and reverently he put it back before night.  There was a\nBible, in Dutch; and with it a Prayer-book.  He carried these, while\nAilwin carried the body, wrapped in cloth, with another piece hanging\nover it, like a pall.  As Oliver took Mildred's hand, and saw how pale\nand sorrowful she looked (though quite patient), he felt how much need\nthey all had of the consolations and hopes which speak to mourners from\nthe book he held.\n\nAilwin did not understand Dutch; so Oliver thought it kindest and best\nto say in English what he read, both from the Bible and Prayer-book.  He\nread a short portion of what Saint Paul says about the dead and their\nrising again.  Then all three assisted in closing the tomb, firmly and\ncompletely; and then they kneeled down, and Oliver read a prayer for\nmourners from his book.  They did not sing; for he was not sure that\nMildred could go through a hymn.  He made a sign to her to stay when\nAilwin went home; and they two sat down on the grass above the bank, and\nread together that part of the Scripture in which Jesus desires his\nfollowers not to let their hearts be troubled, but to believe in God and\nin him.\n\nMildred was soon quite happy; and Oliver was cheered to see her so.  He\neven began, after a time, to talk of the future.  He pointed out how the\nwaters had sunk, leaving now, he supposed, only about three feet of\ndepth, besides mud and slime.  This mud would make the soil more fertile\nthan it had ever been, if the remainder of the flood could by any means\nbe drawn off.  He thought his father might return, and drain his ground,\nand rebuild the house.  Then the bank they sat on would overlook a more\nbeautiful garden than they had ever yet possessed.  The whole land had\nbeen so well _warped_ (that is, flooded with fertilising mud) that\neverything that was planted would flourish.  They might get the finest\ntulip-roots from Holland, and have a bed of them; and another of choice\nauriculas, just below George's tomb; and honeysuckles might be trained\nround it, to attract the bees.\n\nMildred liked to hear all this; and she said so; but she added that she\nshould like it better still to-morrow, perhaps.  She felt so strangely\ntired now, that she could not listen any more, even to what she liked to\nhear.\n\n\"Are you going to be ill, do you think, dear?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  Don't you think Roger is ill?\"\n\n\"Yes; and I dare say we shall all have the fever, from the damps and bad\nsmells of this place.\"\n\n\"Well--never mind about me, Oliver.  I am only very, very tired yet.\"\n\n\"Come home, and lie down, and I will sit beside you,\" said Oliver.  \"You\nwill be patient, I know, dear.  I will try if I can be patient, if I\nshould see you very ill.\"\n\nHe led her home, and laid her down, and scarcely left her for many\nhours.  It was plain now that the fever had seized upon them; and where\nit would stop, who could tell?  During the night he and Ailwin watched\nby turns beside their sick companions.  This would not have been\nnecessary for Mildred; but Roger was sometimes a little delirious; and\nthey were afraid of his frightening Mildred by his startings and strange\nsayings.\n\nWhen Ailwin came, at dawn, to take Oliver's place, she patted him on the\nshoulder, and bade him go to sleep, and be in no hurry to rouse himself\nagain; for he would not be wanted for anything if he should sleep till\nnoon.\n\nOliver was tired enough; but there was one thing which he had a great\nmind to do before he slept.  He wished to look out once again from the\nstaircase, when the sun should have risen, to see whether there was no\nmoving speck on the wide waters--no promise of help in what now\nthreatened to be his extremity.  Ailwin thought him perverse; but did\nnot oppose his going when he said he was sure he should sleep better\nafter it.  She soon, therefore, saw his figure among the ruins of the\nroof, standing up between her and the brightening sky.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. MORE HARDSHIP.\n\nThis morning was unlike the mornings which Oliver had watched since the\nflood came.  There was no glowing sky towards the east; and he saw that\nthere would be no broad train of light over the waters, which should so\ndazzle his eyes as almost to prevent his seeing anything else.  It was\nnow a stormy-looking sunrise.  Huge piles of clouds lay on the eastern\nhorizon, through which it seemed impossible that the rays of the sun\nshould pierce.  The distant church-spire looked black amidst the grey\nflood: and the houses and chapel at Sandtoft, which now stood high out\nof the water, had a dark and dismal air.  Oliver would have been rather\nglad to believe that there would be no sunshine this day, if he had not\nfeared there would be storm.  He had so learned, in these few days, to\nassociate reeking fogs and putrid smells with hot sunshine, that a shady\nday would have been a relief: but it there should come a tempest, what\ncould be done with the sick members of the party?  It was dangerous to\nstand under the trees in a thunderstorm; and the poor tent would be\nsoaked through with a quarter of an hour's rain.  He thought it would be\nbest to take down the tent, and wrap up Mildred and Roger in the cloth;\nand to pile the mattresses, one upon another, at the foot of the\nthickest tree they could find; so that there might be a chance of one\nbed being left dry for poor Mildred.\n\nWhile arranging this in his mind, Oliver had been anxiously looking\nabroad for any moving speck on the grey waters.  Seeing none, but\nperceiving that the clouds were slowly mounting the sky, and moving\nonwards, he felt that he ought to be going to the hill, to make such\npreparations as were possible before the first raindrops should fall.\nSlowly and sadly he turned away to do so, when, casting one more glance\neastwards, he perceived something moving--a dark speck, leaving the\nruined roof of a dwelling which stood about half-way between himself and\nthe hamlet.\n\nThere could be no doubt that this speck was a boat; and as it came\nnearer, Oliver saw that it was--a large boat, but quite full.  He could\ndistinguish no figures in it, so heavy seemed the mass of people, or of\ngoods, with which it was crowded.  It came on and on, however; and\nOliver's heart beat faster as it came.  How he wished now that he had\nkept a flag flying from the spot on which he stood!  How he wished he\nnow had a signal to fix on this height!  Though the boat-people were\nstill too far off to distinguish figures, a signal might catch their\neye.  If he went to the Red-hill for a flag, the boat might be gone away\nbefore his return.  Trembling with haste, he stripped off his shirt, and\nswung it in the air.  He even mounted the top stone, which, surrounded\nby no wall, or other defence, hung over the waters below.  Oliver would\nhave said, half an hour before, that he could not have stood alone on\nthis perilous point: now, he not only stood there, but waved his white\nsignal with all his strength.\n\nDid anybody notice it?\n\nHe once thought he saw what might have been an oar lifted in the air;\nbut he was not sure.  He was presently only too certain of something\nelse--that the boat was moving away, not in the direction in which it\nhad approached, but southwards.  He tried, as long as he could, to\ndisbelieve this; but there it went--away--away--and Oliver had to come\ndown from his stone, put on his clothes again, and find how thirsty he\nwas.\n\nThere was hope still, he felt--great hope: but he must keep it from\nMildred, who was in no condition to bear the disappointment of such a\nhope.  He doubted whether Ailwin could control her tongue and her\ncountenance, while possessed of such news.  It would be hard not to be\nable to tell any one of what so filled his thoughts; and he resolved to\nsee first what state Roger was in.\n\nWhen he reached the tent, Roger was not there.  Ailwin could not tell\nwhere he was.  He had staggered away, like a drunken person, she said--\nhe seemed so giddy; but she could not leave Mildred to see after him,\nthough he had spoken to a lord; if indeed that could be true of a boy\nlike him.  Ailwin looked up at the clouds, every moment, as she spoke;\nand Mildred shivered, as if she missed the morning sunshine.  Oliver saw\nthat he must make ready for the storm, before he prepared for what might\nfollow.  He and Ailwin pulled down the long piece of cloth from its\nsupport, doubled it again and again, and put Mildred into the middle of\nit.  Oliver longed to lay her under a leafy tree; but he dared not, on\naccount of the lightning, which was already beginning to flash.  He and\nAilwin set up the deal table as a sort of penthouse over her; and then\nbusied themselves, in her sight, in piling together everything else they\nhad, to keep as many articles as possible from spoiling.\n\nOliver was just thinking that he might slip away to seek Roger, when he\nsaw that Mildred was sobbing, under the heap of cloth they had laid upon\nher.  In a moment he was by her side, saying--\n\n\"What is the matter, dear?  Are you afraid of the storm?  I never knew\nyou afraid of thunder and lightning; but perhaps you may be now, because\nyou are ill.\"\n\n\"No,\" sobbed Mildred.\n\n\"I cannot help being glad of this storm,\" continued Oliver, \"though it\nis disagreeable, at the time, to people who have no house to go to.  I\nhope it will clear the air, and freshen it; and that is the very thing\nwe want, to make you better.\"\n\n\"It is not that, Oliver.  I don't mind the storm at all.\"\n\n\"Then what makes you cry so, dear?  Is it about Geordie?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Something about him that I don't think you know; something that I\nshall never bear to think of.  It will make me miserable as long as I\nlive.  Do you know, I was tired of nursing him, and hearing him cry; and\nI gave it up--the only thing I could do for him!  I asked Ailwin to take\nhim.  And in two days he was dead; and I could never do anything for him\nany more.\"\n\nHere a burst of grief stopped her voice.  Her brother said, very\nsolemnly,--\n\n\"Now, Mildred, listen to me,--to the little I can say--for you know I\ncannot, in this place, stay and talk with you as we should both like,\nand as we might have done at home.  I think you were almost always very\nkind to Geordie; and I am sure he loved you very dearly.  But I have\nheard mother say that the worst part of losing dear friends is that we\nhave to blame ourselves, more or less, for our behaviour to them,--even\nto those we loved the very most.  So I will not flatter you, dear:\nthough I don't at all wonder at your being tired of hearing Geordie cry\nthat day.  I will not say whether you were right or wrong; but only put\nyou in mind that we may always ask for pardon.  Remember, too, that you\nmay meet Geordie again; and perhaps be kinder to him than we ever are to\none another here.  Now I will go, and come back again soon.\"\n\n\"Stop one minute,\" implored Mildred.  \"I dreamed that you all went away\nfrom this hill, and left me alone.\"\n\nAs she said this, she looked at her brother, with such a painful\nwistfulness, that he saw that she had had a fever-dream, and was not yet\nquite clear from its remains.  He laughed, as at something ridiculous;\nwhich Mildred seemed to like: and then he reminded her more gravely,\nthat they could not get away from this place if they would.  If an\nopportunity should occur, he assured her he would not leave hold of her\nhand.  Nothing should make him step into a boat without her.  Poor\nMildred had fancied, bewildered as she was this morning, that if Oliver\nknew of what she had done about George, he would think himself justified\nin leaving her to perish on the hill; and yet she could not help telling\nhim.  Her mind was relieved, for the present, and she let him go.\n\nHe found Roger where he first looked for him,--near the mummy.  The poor\nlad was too ill to stand; but he lay on the slimy bank, poking and\ngrubbing, with a stick and with his fingers, as deep in the soft soil as\nhe could penetrate.  Oliver saw that he had found some more\ncuriosities;--bunches of nuts,--nuts which were ripening on the tree\nmany hundreds of seasons ago; but which no hand had plucked till now.\nOliver could neither wonder nor admire, at this moment: nor was he vexed\n(as he might have been at another time) at Roger's crawling hither, in\npursuit of gain, to be made more ill by every breath he drew while\nstooping over the rank mud.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, Roger,\" said Oliver.  \"I am not going to touch your\nfindings, or meddle with you.  I want you to change your clothes,--to\nput off that finery,--and to let me know where the bag of money is that\nyou took out of the chest.\"\n\nRoger stared.\n\n\"I am going to pack that chest again; and I want to see everything in\nit, that it may be ready if any boat should come.\"\n\n\"Boat!\" exclaimed Roger.\n\n\"Yes: a boat may come, you know; and we must not detain it, if such a\nthing should happen.  If you die without restoring that money, Roger, it\nwill be a sin upon your soul: so tell me where it is, and have an easy\nmind, I advise you.  That will be a good thing, if you live an hundred\nyears.\"\n\n\"There is a boat here now!  You are going to leave me behind!\" cried\nRoger, scrambling up on his feet, and falling again from weakness, two\nor three times.  \"I knew it,\" he continued; \"I dreamt it all last night;\nand it is going to come true to-day.\"\n\n\"Mildred dreamed the same thing; and it is because you are both ill,\"\nsaid Oliver.  \"Lean upon me--as heavily as you like--and I will go home\nwith you, as slowly as you will, if you will tell me where the money-bag\nis.  You will find no boat there now, whatever there may be by-and-by:\nbut if you will not tell me where the money-bag is, I will shake you off\nnow, and leave you here.  It is another person's money: and I must have\nit.\"\n\nRoger said he would tell, if Oliver would promise him not to leave him\nalone on the island.  Oliver assured him that there was no danger\nwhatever of the deliverers of some of the party leaving others to\nperish.  He owned that he was bound to make his sister his first care,\nand Ailwin his next.  As boys, Roger and himself must be satisfied to be\nthought of last; but he hoped they should neither of them do an ill turn\nby the other.  He asked if Roger had ever received an ill turn from him.\n\n\"That is the thing,\" said Roger, sorrowfully: \"and you have had so many\nfrom me and mine!\"\n\n\"I am sure I forgive them all, now you have once said that,\" cried\nOliver.  \"I forgive and forget them all: and so would father, if he\nheard you.\"\n\n\"No!  Would he?  And he said once that he and his would scorn to be like\nme and mine.\"\n\n\"Did you hear him say that?  You used to hear every word we said to one\nanother, I think.\"\n\n\"It was Ailwin that threw that in my teeth.\"\n\n\"Father would not say so now: never after you had had Geordie on your\nknees and made him fond of you, as you did.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\"\n\n\"I am almost sure of it.  But he could not help thinking badly of you if\nyou keep that money.\"\n\n\"I am not going to keep it.  Do you go and find it, if you like, for I\ncan't.  It is in a hollow elm that stands between two beeches, on the\nother side of the wood.  There is a little cross cut in the bark, on the\nsouth side--that will help you to find it.  But don't you go till you\nhave got me to the tent.\"\n\nOliver helped him home, amidst lightning and splashing rain, explaining\nas they went why the tent was down, but thinking it best to say nothing\nof the boat to one so weak-spirited as Roger was now.  He then ran off,\nand found the money-bag.  He wished the weather would clear, that he\nmight look out again: but, meanwhile, he felt that he was not losing\ntime in collecting together all the goods that were on the hill; for the\ntempest so darkened and filled the air, that he knew he could not have\nseen a furlong into the distance, if he had been on his perch at this\nmoment.  He wore his mother's watch in his pocket, feeling as if it\npromised that he should meet her again, to put it back into her hands.\n\n\"Now, Oliver,\" said Ailwin, \"I am vexed with you that you did not sleep\nwhile you might, before this growling, splashing weather came on, and\nwhile there was something of a shelter over your head.  If you don't go\nto sleep the minute this tempest is over, I must see what I must do to\nyou: for you will be having the fever else; and then what is to become\nof me, among you all, I should like to know?  I wish you would creep in\nnow between the mattresses under the tree, and never think of the storm,\nbut go to sleep like a good boy.  It is hardly likely that the lightning\nshould strike that particular tree, just while you are under it.\"\n\n\"But if you should chance to find me a cinder, when you thought it time\nfor me to be waking, Ailwin--would not that be as bad as my having the\nfever?\"\n\n\"Oliver!  How can you talk so?  How dare you think of such a shocking\nthing?\"\n\n\"You put it into my head, Ailwin.  But come--let me tell you a thing I\nwant you to do, if I should be away when it stops raining.  Here are\nRoger's old clothes, safe and dry here between the beds.  When it leaves\noff raining, make him pull off his wet finery, and put on his own dry\nthings; and keep that finery somewhere out of his way, that I may put it\nback into the chest, where it ought to be lying now.  Will you do this,\nAilwin?\"\n\n\"Why, I'll see.  If I was quite sure that he had nothing to do with this\nstorm, I might manage him as I could any other boy.\"\n\n\"Anybody may manage him to-day, with a little kindness.  He is ill and\nweak-spirited; and you can touch his heart with a word.  If you only\nremember how George cried after him, you will be gentle with him, I\nknow.\"\n\n\"Well, that's true: and I doubt whether a lord would have spoken with\nhim, if he had been so dangerous as he seems sometimes.  Now, as to\ndinner to-day, Oliver--I really don't like to give Mildred such food as\nthe game on the island now is.  I am sure it is downright unwholesome.\nBird and beast, they are all dying off faster than we can kill them.\"\n\n\"The fowls are not all done, I hope.  I thought we had some meal-fed\nfowls left.\"\n\n\"Just two; and that is all: and the truth is, I don't like to part those\ntwo poor things, enjoying the meal-picking together; and then, they are\nthe last of our wholesome food.\"\n\n\"Then let us have them while they are wholesome.  Boil one to-day, and\nmake the broth as nice as you can for Mildred.  We will cook the other\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"And what next day?\"\n\n\"We will see to that when the day comes.  Oh dear!  When will these\nclouds have emptied themselves?  Surely they cannot pour down at this\nrate long.\"\n\n\"The thunder and lightning are just over, and that's a comfort,\" said\nAilwin.  \"You might stand under any tree, now, Oliver; and you go\nwandering about, as if you were a duck in your heart, and loved the\nrain.\"\n\nAilwin might wonder, for Oliver was indeed very restless.  While waiting\nthe moment when he might again cross to the staircase, he could not even\nstand still under a tree.  The secret of his having seen the boat was\ntoo heavy a one to be borne when he was no longer busy.  He felt that he\nshould tell, if he remained beside his sister and Ailwin; so he wandered\noff, through the wood, to try how far he could see over the waters to\nthe south, now that the tempest was passing away.\n\nThrough the trees he saw some one--a tall person, walking on the grass\nby the water-side.  He ran--he flew.  There was a boat lying against the\nbank, and two or three men walking towards the wood.  The foremost was\nPastor Dendel.  Oliver sprang into his arms, clung round his neck for a\nmoment, and then fainted away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. NEWS.\n\nOliver soon recovered.  The strong, manly caress of the pastor seemed to\nrevive him, even more than the water the others threw on his face.  His\nfirst word was \"Mother.\"\n\n\"She is safe, my boy: and she will be well when I take you to her.  Are\nyou alone here, Oliver?\"\n\n\"Alone!  O no!  Don't let these men go and startle Mildred and the\nrest--\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed Pastor Dendel.\n\nThe two men who were with him seemed about to raise a shout, and wave\ntheir hats, but the pastor forbade them by a gesture.  He whispered to\nOliver,--\n\n\"Mildred, and who else, my dear?  We know nothing, you are aware.  Your\nfather--?\"\n\n\"He was carried off in the mill,--out to the Humber--\"\n\nOliver stopped, as he saw the men exchange a look of awe, which took his\nbreath away again.\n\n\"We have something like news of your father too, Oliver.  There is a\nrumour which makes us hope that he may be safe at a distance.  Your\nmother believes it, as she will tell you.  Is it possible that you are\nall alive, after such a calamity as this?\"\n\n\"George is dead, sir.  We buried him yesterday.  Ailwin is here, with\nMildred and me; and Roger Redfurn.\"\n\nOne of the men observed that he had hoped, as one good that would come\nof the flood, that the Levels were rid of the Redfurns.\n\n\"Do not say that,\" said Oliver.  \"Roger has helped us in many things;\nand he was kind to little George.  Let me go, sir.  I can walk now very\nwell: and I want to tell them that you are come.\"\n\n\"Go, my boy: but do it gently, Oliver,--gently.\"\n\n\"That is what I want, sir,--that they should not see or hear you: for\nMildred is ill,--and Roger too.  Please keep out of sight till I come\nfor you.  So mother is safe,--really?\"\n\n\"Really, and we will take you all to her.\"\n\nMildred, lying uncomfortably in the soaked cloth (for the rain had\npenetrated everything), was yet dozing,--now and then starting and\ncalling out.  Oliver took her hand, to wake her up, and asked her, with\na smile, as she opened her eyes, whether she was dreaming of a boat\nagain.  Mildred believed not, but her head was sadly confused; so much\nso, that she heard of the boat which had really come, and the pastor and\nher parents, without showing any surprise or pleasure.  Little ceremony\nwas necessary with the strong Ailwin; and one of the men made short work\nwith Roger, by lifting him and carrying him into the boat.  Oliver said\na word to the pastor about seeing George's grave, and about the chest\nand the money-bag which belonged to somebody who might want them much.\nThe pastor took charge of the bag, but declared that everything else\nmust be left for another trip, at a more leisure time.  Mrs Linacre was\nwaiting,--and in what a state of expectation!\n\nWhile the two stout rowers were pulling rapidly away from the Red-hill,\nand in the direction of Gainsborough, the pastor explained to the party\nwhat they most wanted to know.  Mrs Linacre had heard some rumour which\nalarmed her on the day of the flood, and had locked up her shed, and set\nout homewards when the waters gushed over her road, and compelled her to\nturn back.  Like a multitude of others, as anxious and miserable as\nherself, she had ever since been wandering about in search of a boat,\nand imploring aid from every one she met.\n\nFor three days, it appeared as if there really were no boats in all the\ndistrict.  Some had certainly been swamped and broken by the rush of the\nflood: and there was great difficulty in bringing round from the coast\nsuch as could there be had from the fishermen.  Some farmers on the hill\nhad lent their oxen, to bring boats over the hills; and others, men to\nrow them; and this was in time to save many lives.  What number had been\nlost, it was impossible yet to say; but the cleverness and the\nhopefulness with which a multitude had struggled for life, during five\ndays of hardship and peril were wonderful and admirable.  Mrs Linacre\nhad trusted in the power which God gives his children in such extremity,\nand had been persuaded throughout (except during short moments of\ndespair), that she should see her husband and children again.  In this\npersuasion she had been sustained by the pastor, from the moment of his\nfinding her, after his own escape.\n\nOf his own escape the pastor would say nothing at present.  The\nchildren's minds were too full now for such tales of wonder and of\nhorror as they must hear hereafter.  Neither would he permit a word on\nthe origin of the flood.  He said they must think as little as they\ncould of the wicked deeds of men, in this hour of God's mercy.  One\nprayer, in every heart, that God would forgive all evil-minded men,--one\nsuch prayer let there be; and then, no more disturbing thoughts of\nenemies in the hour of preservation.\n\nOliver could not trust himself to ask, in the presence of strangers,\nwhat the rumour was, which the pastor had mentioned, about his father.\nThe pastor was very apt to understand what was stirring in people's\nhearts; and he knew Oliver's at this moment.  He explained to him that a\nsailor had declared, on landing at Hull, that the ship in which he was\nhad spoken with a Dutch vessel, off the Humber, in the night, by the\nlight of lanterns only, when a voice was heard, as if from the deck of\nthe Dutchman, crying out, \"Will some one have the charity to tell the\nwife of Linacre of the Levels that he is saved?\"  The sailors had some\nfears about this voice--thought the message odd--fancied the voice was\nlike what they should suppose a ghost's to be; and at length, persuaded\none another that it came, not from any ship, but from the air overhead;\nand that the message meant that Linacre was dead, and that his soul was\nsaved.  When they came ashore, however, and found what had befallen the\nLevels, they began to doubt whether it was not, after all, the voice of\na flesh and blood man that had called out to them.  When the pastor now\nheard how the miller was floated off in his mill, he had little doubt of\nthe good man having been picked up in the Humber, by a vessel sailing\nfor Holland, which could not stop to set him ashore, but which now\ncontained him, safe and well.  Within two months, he would be heard of\nor seen, it might fairly be hoped.\n\nMrs Linacre was kindly taken care of in a farm-house, near the spring--\nthat farm-house where she had often taken her copper money to be changed\nfor silver: but she had been little within doors, day or night.  She had\npaced all day by the brink of the flood; and as long as the moon was up,\nhad sat at night on a rising ground, looking over the waters towards the\nRed-hill.  She had discovered that the mill was gone, when other eyes\ncould distinguish nothing so far off.  No one had a glass to lend her--\nso, at least, it was said; but some whispered that a glass might have\nbeen procured, but that it was thought she could see only what would\ndistress her, and nothing that could do her any good.\n\nShe was on the brink of the water when the boat came near.  She would\nhave thrown herself in to meet her children, if a neighbour had not been\nthere to hold her back.\n\nOliver's first words to her were, that he believed his father was safe\non his way to Holland, and would soon be coming back.  The pastor's\nfirst words were, as he placed Mildred in her arms--\n\n\"Two children are here restored to you.  Will you not patiently resign\nyour other little one?\"\n\nThe speechless mother was hurrying away, with Mildred on her bosom, and\ndrawing Oliver by the hand, which she clasped convulsively, when he\nsaid--\n\n\"Mother, help me to keep a promise I have made.  Here is Roger Redfurn--\nvery ill.  I promised we would not forsake him.  Let him go with us,\ntill he is well.\"\n\n\"Whatever you will, my boy; but do not leave me, Oliver,--not for a\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said the pastor.  \"We are bringing Roger after you.  We shall\nbe at home as soon as you.\"\n\n\"Home,\" was the friendly farm-house.  There, before the end of the day,\nhad Oliver learned that his morning signal had been seen from the large\nboat; and that the reason why the large boat had rowed away was, not\nonly that it was full, but that the waters were now too shallow about\nthe Red-hill for any but small craft.  Before the end of the day Mrs\nLinacre had been seen to look like herself once more; and Ailwin had\ntold to the wondering neighbours the tale of the few days, which seemed\nnow like years to look back upon.  She told more than even Oliver had\nobserved of the miserable state of their place of refuge, which would\nsoon have been a place of death.  Scarcely a breathing thing, she said,\nwas left alive: and, in going to the boat, she had seen the soaked\nbee-hives upset, and the chilled bees lying about, as if there was no\nspirit left in them.  She shuddered when she thought of the Red-hill.\nThen she stimulated the farm-house people to take care of Roger,--a task\nin which Oliver left them little to do.  They were willing enough,\nhowever; for Ailwin told them that though Roger had been an odd boy in\nhis time, owing to his having been brought up by queer people, yet,\nconsidering that those people were drowned and gone, and that Roger had\nbeen noticed by a lord, she did not doubt he might turn out well, if it\nso pleased God.\n\nHow closely did Mildred clasp her mother's neck that evening!  Knowing\nnothing else, and feeling very strangely, she yet understood that she\nwas in a place of shelter and comfort, and felt that her head rested on\nher mother's bosom--on that pillow which has something so far better\nthan all warmth and softness.  By degrees she began to be aware that\nthere was cool and fresh water, and sweet-smelling flowers, and that she\nwas tenderly bathed, and laid to rest on a bed which was neither wet nor\nunder a tree.  There was a surprising silence all round her, she felt,\nas she grew stronger, which no one yet attempted to explain to her; but\nher mother smiled at her so happily, that she supposed she was\nrecovering.\n\nMrs Linacre did look happy, even in the midst of her tears for her poor\nbaby.  Mildred _was_ recovering, Oliver ate and slept, and whistled\nunder the window--like a light-hearted boy, as he once again amused\nhimself with carving every piece of hard wood he could find.  It was\nclear that he had escaped the fever; and every day that refreshed his\ncolour, and filled out his thin face again, brought nearer the hour of\nhis father's return.\n\n\n",
