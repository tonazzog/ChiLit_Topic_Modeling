  "content": "The Water-Babies\nCharles Kingsley\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\n\n\"I heard a thousand blended notes,\nWhile in a grove I sate reclined;\nIn that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts\nBring sad thoughts to the mind.\n\n\"To her fair works did Nature link\nThe human soul that through me ran;\nAnd much it grieved my heart to think,\nWhat man has made of man.\"\n\nWORDSWORTH.\n\n\nOnce upon a time there was a little chimney-sweep, and his name was\nTom.  That is a short name, and you have heard it before, so you\nwill not have much trouble in remembering it.  He lived in a great\ntown in the North country, where there were plenty of chimneys to\nsweep, and plenty of money for Tom to earn and his master to spend.\nHe could not read nor write, and did not care to do either; and he\nnever washed himself, for there was no water up the court where he\nlived.  He had never been taught to say his prayers.  He never had\nheard of God, or of Christ, except in words which you never have\nheard, and which it would have been well if he had never heard.  He\ncried half his time, and laughed the other half.  He cried when he\nhad to climb the dark flues, rubbing his poor knees and elbows raw;\nand when the soot got into his eyes, which it did every day in the\nweek; and when his master beat him, which he did every day in the\nweek; and when he had not enough to eat, which happened every day\nin the week likewise.  And he laughed the other half of the day,\nwhen he was tossing halfpennies with the other boys, or playing\nleap-frog over the posts, or bowling stones at the horses' legs as\nthey trotted by, which last was excellent fun, when there was a\nwall at hand behind which to hide.  As for chimney-sweeping, and\nbeing hungry, and being beaten, he took all that for the way of the\nworld, like the rain and snow and thunder, and stood manfully with\nhis back to it till it was over, as his old donkey did to a hail-\nstorm; and then shook his ears and was as jolly as ever; and\nthought of the fine times coming, when he would be a man, and a\nmaster sweep, and sit in the public-house with a quart of beer and\na long pipe, and play cards for silver money, and wear velveteens\nand ankle-jacks, and keep a white bull-dog with one gray ear, and\ncarry her puppies in his pocket, just like a man.  And he would\nhave apprentices, one, two, three, if he could.  How he would bully\nthem, and knock them about, just as his master did to him; and make\nthem carry home the soot sacks, while he rode before them on his\ndonkey, with a pipe in his mouth and a flower in his button-hole,\nlike a king at the head of his army.  Yes, there were good times\ncoming; and, when his master let him have a pull at the leavings of\nhis beer, Tom was the jolliest boy in the whole town.\n\nOne day a smart little groom rode into the court where Tom lived.\nTom was just hiding behind a wall, to heave half a brick at his\nhorse's legs, as is the custom of that country when they welcome\nstrangers; but the groom saw him, and halloed to him to know where\nMr. Grimes, the chimney-sweep, lived.  Now, Mr. Grimes was Tom's\nown master, and Tom was a good man of business, and always civil to\ncustomers, so he put the half-brick down quietly behind the wall,\nand proceeded to take orders.\n\nMr. Grimes was to come up next morning to Sir John Harthover's, at\nthe Place, for his old chimney-sweep was gone to prison, and the\nchimneys wanted sweeping.  And so he rode away, not giving Tom time\nto ask what the sweep had gone to prison for, which was a matter of\ninterest to Tom, as he had been in prison once or twice himself.\nMoreover, the groom looked so very neat and clean, with his drab\ngaiters, drab breeches, drab jacket, snow-white tie with a smart\npin in it, and clean round ruddy face, that Tom was offended and\ndisgusted at his appearance, and considered him a stuck-up fellow,\nwho gave himself airs because he wore smart clothes, and other\npeople paid for them; and went behind the wall to fetch the half-\nbrick after all; but did not, remembering that he had come in the\nway of business, and was, as it were, under a flag of truce.\n\nHis master was so delighted at his new customer that he knocked Tom\ndown out of hand, and drank more beer that night than he usually\ndid in two, in order to be sure of getting up in time next morning;\nfor the more a man's head aches when he wakes, the more glad he is\nto turn out, and have a breath of fresh air.  And, when he did get\nup at four the next morning, he knocked Tom down again, in order to\nteach him (as young gentlemen used to be taught at public schools)\nthat he must be an extra good boy that day, as they were going to a\nvery great house, and might make a very good thing of it, if they\ncould but give satisfaction.\n\nAnd Tom thought so likewise, and, indeed, would have done and\nbehaved his best, even without being knocked down.  For, of all\nplaces upon earth, Harthover Place (which he had never seen) was\nthe most wonderful, and, of all men on earth, Sir John (whom he had\nseen, having been sent to gaol by him twice) was the most awful.\n\nHarthover Place was really a grand place, even for the rich North\ncountry; with a house so large that in the frame-breaking riots,\nwhich Tom could just remember, the Duke of Wellington, and ten\nthousand soldiers to match, were easily housed therein; at least,\nso Tom believed; with a park full of deer, which Tom believed to be\nmonsters who were in the habit of eating children; with miles of\ngame-preserves, in which Mr. Grimes and the collier lads poached at\ntimes, on which occasions Tom saw pheasants, and wondered what they\ntasted like; with a noble salmon-river, in which Mr. Grimes and his\nfriends would have liked to poach; but then they must have got into\ncold water, and that they did not like at all.  In short, Harthover\nwas a grand place, and Sir John a grand old man, whom even Mr.\nGrimes respected; for not only could he send Mr. Grimes to prison\nwhen he deserved it, as he did once or twice a week; not only did\nhe own all the land about for miles; not only was he a jolly,\nhonest, sensible squire, as ever kept a pack of hounds, who would\ndo what he thought right by his neighbours, as well as get what he\nthought right for himself; but, what was more, he weighed full\nfifteen stone, was nobody knew how many inches round the chest, and\ncould have thrashed Mr. Grimes himself in fair fight, which very\nfew folk round there could do, and which, my dear little boy, would\nnot have been right for him to do, as a great many things are not\nwhich one both can do, and would like very much to do.  So Mr.\nGrimes touched his hat to him when he rode through the town, and\ncalled him a \"buirdly awd chap,\" and his young ladies \"gradely\nlasses,\" which are two high compliments in the North country; and\nthought that that made up for his poaching Sir John's pheasants;\nwhereby you may perceive that Mr. Grimes had not been to a\nproperly-inspected Government National School.\n\nNow, I dare say, you never got up at three o'clock on a midsummer\nmorning.  Some people get up then because they want to catch\nsalmon; and some because they want to climb Alps; and a great many\nmore because they must, like Tom.  But, I assure you, that three\no'clock on a midsummer morning is the pleasantest time of all the\ntwenty-four hours, and all the three hundred and sixty-five days;\nand why every one does not get up then, I never could tell, save\nthat they are all determined to spoil their nerves and their\ncomplexions by doing all night what they might just as well do all\nday.  But Tom, instead of going out to dinner at half-past eight at\nnight, and to a ball at ten, and finishing off somewhere between\ntwelve and four, went to bed at seven, when his master went to the\npublic-house, and slept like a dead pig; for which reason he was as\npiert as a game-cock (who always gets up early to wake the maids),\nand just ready to get up when the fine gentlemen and ladies were\njust ready to go to bed.\n\nSo he and his master set out; Grimes rode the donkey in front, and\nTom and the brushes walked behind; out of the court, and up the\nstreet, past the closed window-shutters, and the winking weary\npolicemen, and the roofs all shining gray in the gray dawn.\n\nThey passed through the pitmen's village, all shut up and silent\nnow, and through the turnpike; and then the were out in the real\ncountry, and plodding along the black dusty road, between black\nslag walls, with no sound but the groaning and thumping of the pit-\nengine in the next field.  But soon the road grew white, and the\nwalls likewise; and at the wall's foot grew long grass and gay\nflowers, all drenched with dew; and instead of the groaning of the\npit-engine, they heard the skylark saying his matins high up in the\nair, and the pit-bird warbling in the sedges, as he had warbled all\nnight long.\n\nAll else was silent.  For old Mrs. Earth was still fast asleep;\nand, like many pretty people, she looked still prettier asleep than\nawake.  The great elm-trees in the gold-green meadows were fast\nasleep above, and the cows fast asleep beneath them; nay, the few\nclouds which were about were fast asleep likewise, and so tired\nthat they had lain down on the earth to rest, in long white flakes\nand bars, among the stems of the elm-trees, and along the tops of\nthe alders by the stream, waiting for the sun to bid them rise and\ngo about their day's business in the clear blue overhead.\n\nOn they went; and Tom looked, and looked, for he never had been so\nfar into the country before; and longed to get over a gate, and\npick buttercups, and look for birds' nests in the hedge; but Mr.\nGrimes was a man of business, and would not have heard of that.\n\nSoon they came up with a poor Irishwoman, trudging along with a\nbundle at her back.  She had a gray shawl over her head, and a\ncrimson madder petticoat; so you may be sure she came from Galway.\nShe had neither shoes nor stockings, and limped along as if she\nwere tired and footsore; but she was a very tall handsome woman,\nwith bright gray eyes, and heavy black hair hanging about her\ncheeks.  And she took Mr. Grimes' fancy so much, that when he came\nalongside he called out to her:\n\n\"This is a hard road for a gradely foot like that.  Will ye up,\nlass, and ride behind me?\"\n\nBut, perhaps, she did not admire Mr. Grimes' look and voice; for\nshe answered quietly:\n\n\"No, thank you:  I'd sooner walk with your little lad here.\"\n\n\"You may please yourself,\" growled Grimes, and went on smoking.\n\nSo she walked beside Tom, and talked to him, and asked him where he\nlived, and what he knew, and all about himself, till Tom thought he\nhad never met such a pleasant-spoken woman.  And she asked him, at\nlast, whether he said his prayers! and seemed sad when he told her\nthat he knew no prayers to say.\n\nThen he asked her where she lived, and she said far away by the\nsea.  And Tom asked her about the sea; and she told him how it\nrolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights, and lay still in\nthe bright summer days, for the children to bathe and play in it;\nand many a story more, till Tom longed to go and see the sea, and\nbathe in it likewise.\n\nAt last, at the bottom of a hill, they came to a spring; not such a\nspring as you see here, which soaks up out of a white gravel in the\nbog, among red fly-catchers, and pink bottle-heath, and sweet white\norchis; nor such a one as you may see, too, here, which bubbles up\nunder the warm sandbank in the hollow lane by the great tuft of\nlady ferns, and makes the sand dance reels at the bottom, day and\nnight, all the year round; not such a spring as either of those;\nbut a real North country limestone fountain, like one of those in\nSicily or Greece, where the old heathen fancied the nymphs sat\ncooling themselves the hot summer's day, while the shepherds peeped\nat them from behind the bushes.  Out of a low cave of rock, at the\nfoot of a limestone crag, the great fountain rose, quelling, and\nbubbling, and gurgling, so clear that you could not tell where the\nwater ended and the air began; and ran away under the road, a\nstream large enough to turn a mill; among blue geranium, and golden\nglobe-flower, and wild raspberry, and the bird-cherry with its\ntassels of snow.\n\nAnd there Grimes stopped, and looked; and Tom looked too.  Tom was\nwondering whether anything lived in that dark cave, and came out at\nnight to fly in the meadows.  But Grimes was not wondering at all.\nWithout a word, he got off his donkey, and clambered over the low\nroad wall, and knelt down, and began dipping his ugly head into the\nspring--and very dirty he made it.\n\nTom was picking the flowers as fast as he could.  The Irishwoman\nhelped him, and showed him how to tie them up; and a very pretty\nnosegay they had made between them.  But when he saw Grimes\nactually wash, he stopped, quite astonished; and when Grimes had\nfinished, and began shaking his ears to dry them, he said:\n\n\"Why, master, I never saw you do that before.\"\n\n\"Nor will again, most likely.  'Twasn't for cleanliness I did it,\nbut for coolness.  I'd be ashamed to want washing every week or so,\nlike any smutty collier lad.\"\n\n\"I wish I might go and dip my head in,\" said poor little Tom.  \"It\nmust be as good as putting it under the town-pump; and there is no\nbeadle here to drive a chap away.\"\n\n\"Thou come along,\" said Grimes; \"what dost want with washing\nthyself?  Thou did not drink half a gallon of beer last night, like\nme.\"\n\n\"I don't care for you,\" said naughty Tom, and ran down to the\nstream, and began washing his face.\n\nGrimes was very sulky, because the woman preferred Tom's company to\nhis; so he dashed at him with horrid words, and tore him up from\nhis knees, and began beating him.  But Tom was accustomed to that,\nand got his head safe between Mr. Grimes' legs, and kicked his\nshins with all his might.\n\n\"Are you not ashamed of yourself, Thomas Grimes?\" cried the\nIrishwoman over the wall.\n\nGrimes looked up, startled at her knowing his name; but all he\nanswered was, \"No, nor never was yet;\" and went on beating Tom.\n\n\"True for you.  If you ever had been ashamed of yourself, you would\nhave gone over into Vendale long ago.\"\n\n\"What do you know about Vendale?\" shouted Grimes; but he left off\nbeating Tom.\n\n\"I know about Vendale, and about you, too.  I know, for instance,\nwhat happened in Aldermire Copse, by night, two years ago come\nMartinmas.\"\n\n\"You do?\" shouted Grimes; and leaving Tom, he climbed up over the\nwall, and faced the woman.  Tom thought he was going to strike her;\nbut she looked him too full and fierce in the face for that.\n\n\"Yes; I was there,\" said the Irishwoman quietly.\n\n\"You are no Irishwoman, by your speech,\" said Grimes, after many\nbad words.\n\n\"Never mind who I am.  I saw what I saw; and if you strike that boy\nagain, I can tell what I know.\"\n\nGrimes seemed quite cowed, and got on his donkey without another\nword.\n\n\"Stop!\" said the Irishwoman.  \"I have one more word for you both;\nfor you will both see me again before all is over.  Those that wish\nto be clean, clean they will be; and those that wish to be foul,\nfoul they will be.  Remember.\"\n\nAnd she turned away, and through a gate into the meadow.  Grimes\nstood still a moment, like a man who had been stunned.  Then he\nrushed after her, shouting, \"You come back.\"  But when he got into\nthe meadow, the woman was not there.\n\nHad she hidden away?  There was no place to hide in.  But Grimes\nlooked about, and Tom also, for he was as puzzled as Grimes himself\nat her disappearing so suddenly; but look where they would, she was\nnot there.\n\nGrimes came back again, as silent as a post, for he was a little\nfrightened; and, getting on his donkey, filled a fresh pipe, and\nsmoked away, leaving Tom in peace.\n\nAnd now they had gone three miles and more, and came to Sir John's\nlodge-gates.\n\nVery grand lodges they were, with very grand iron gates and stone\ngate-posts, and on the top of each a most dreadful bogy, all teeth,\nhorns, and tail, which was the crest which Sir John's ancestors\nwore in the Wars of the Roses; and very prudent men they were to\nwear it, for all their enemies must have run for their lives at the\nvery first sight of them.\n\nGrimes rang at the gate, and out came a keeper on the spot, and\nopened.\n\n\"I was told to expect thee,\" he said.  \"Now thou'lt be so good as\nto keep to the main avenue, and not let me find a hare or a rabbit\non thee when thou comest back.  I shall look sharp for one, I tell\nthee.\"\n\n\"Not if it's in the bottom of the soot-bag,\" quoth Grimes, and at\nthat he laughed; and the keeper laughed and said:\n\n\"If that's thy sort, I may as well walk up with thee to the hall.\"\n\n\"I think thou best had.  It's thy business to see after thy game,\nman, and not mine.\"\n\nSo the keeper went with them; and, to Tom's surprise, he and Grimes\nchatted together all the way quite pleasantly.  He did not know\nthat a keeper is only a poacher turned outside in, and a poacher a\nkeeper turned inside out.\n\nThey walked up a great lime avenue, a full mile long, and between\ntheir stems Tom peeped trembling at the horns of the sleeping deer,\nwhich stood up among the ferns.  Tom had never seen such enormous\ntrees, and as he looked up he fancied that the blue sky rested on\ntheir heads.  But he was puzzled very much by a strange murmuring\nnoise, which followed them all the way.  So much puzzled, that at\nlast he took courage to ask the keeper what it was.\n\nHe spoke very civilly, and called him Sir, for he was horribly\nafraid of him, which pleased the keeper, and he told him that they\nwere the bees about the lime flowers.\n\n\"What are bees?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"What make honey.\"\n\n\"What is honey?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Thou hold thy noise,\" said Grimes.\n\n\"Let the boy be,\" said the keeper.  \"He's a civil young chap now,\nand that's more than he'll be long if he bides with thee.\"\n\nGrimes laughed, for he took that for a compliment.\n\n\"I wish I were a keeper,\" said Tom, \"to live in such a beautiful\nplace, and wear green velveteens, and have a real dog-whistle at my\nbutton, like you.\"\n\nThe keeper laughed; he was a kind-hearted fellow enough.\n\n\"Let well alone, lad, and ill too at times.  Thy life's safer than\nmine at all events, eh, Mr. Grimes?\"\n\nAnd Grimes laughed again, and then the two men began talking, quite\nlow.  Tom could hear, though, that it was about some poaching\nfight; and at last Grimes said surlily, \"Hast thou anything against\nme?\"\n\n\"Not now.\"\n\n\"Then don't ask me any questions till thou hast, for I am a man of\nhonour.\"\n\nAnd at that they both laughed again, and thought it a very good\njoke.\n\nAnd by this time they were come up to the great iron gates in front\nof the house; and Tom stared through them at the rhododendrons and\nazaleas, which were all in flower; and then at the house itself,\nand wondered how many chimneys there were in it, and how long ago\nit was built, and what was the man's name that built it, and\nwhether he got much money for his job?\n\nThese last were very difficult questions to answer.  For Harthover\nhad been built at ninety different times, and in nineteen different\nstyles, and looked as if somebody had built a whole street of\nhouses of every imaginable shape, and then stirred them together\nwith a spoon.\n\n\nFor the attics were Anglo-Saxon.\nThe third door Norman.\nThe second Cinque-cento.\nThe first-floor Elizabethan.\nThe right wing Pure Doric.\nThe centre Early English, with a huge portico copied from the\nParthenon.\nThe left wing pure Boeotian, which the country folk admired most of\nall, became it was just like the new barracks in the town, only\nthree times as big.\nThe grand staircase was copied from the Catacombs at Rome.\nThe back staircase from the Tajmahal at Agra.  This was built by\nSir John's great-great-great-uncle, who won, in Lord Clive's Indian\nWars, plenty of money, plenty of wounds, and no more taste than his\nbetters.\nThe cellars were copied from the caves of Elephanta.\nThe offices from the Pavilion at Brighton.\n\n\nAnd the rest from nothing in heaven, or earth, or under the earth.\n\nSo that Harthover House was a great puzzle to antiquarians, and a\nthorough Naboth's vineyard to critics, and architects, and all\npersons who like meddling with other men's business, and spending\nother men's money.  So they were all setting upon poor Sir John,\nyear after year, and trying to talk him into spending a hundred\nthousand pounds or so, in building, to please them and not himself.\nBut he always put them off, like a canny North-countryman as he\nwas.  One wanted him to build a Gothic house, but he said he was no\nGoth; and another to build an Elizabethan, but he said he lived\nunder good Queen Victoria, and not good Queen Bess; and another was\nbold enough to tell him that his house was ugly, but he said he\nlived inside it, and not outside; and another, that there was no\nunity in it, but he said that that was just why he liked the old\nplace.  For he liked to see how each Sir John, and Sir Hugh, and\nSir Ralph, and Sir Randal, had left his mark upon the place, each\nafter his own taste; and he had no more notion of disturbing his\nancestors' work than of disturbing their graves.  For now the house\nlooked like a real live house, that had a history, and had grown\nand grown as the world grew; and that it was only an upstart fellow\nwho did not know who his own grandfather was, who would change it\nfor some spick and span new Gothic or Elizabethan thing, which\nlooked as if it bad been all spawned in a night, as mushrooms are.\nFrom which you may collect (if you have wit enough) that Sir John\nwas a very sound-headed, sound-hearted squire, and just the man to\nkeep the country side in order, and show good sport with his\nhounds.\n\nBut Tom and his master did not go in through the great iron gates,\nas if they had been Dukes or Bishops, but round the back way, and a\nvery long way round it was; and into a little back-door, where the\nash-boy let them in, yawning horribly; and then in a passage the\nhousekeeper met them, in such a flowered chintz dressing-gown, that\nTom mistook her for My Lady herself, and she gave Grimes solemn\norders about \"You will take care of this, and take care of that,\"\nas if he was going up the chimneys, and not Tom.  And Grimes\nlistened, and said every now and then, under his voice, \"You'll\nmind that, you little beggar?\" and Tom did mind, all at least that\nhe could.  And then the housekeeper turned them into a grand room,\nall covered up in sheets of brown paper, and bade them begin, in a\nlofty and tremendous voice; and so after a whimper or two, and a\nkick from his master, into the grate Tom went, and up the chimney,\nwhile a housemaid stayed in the room to watch the furniture; to\nwhom Mr. Grimes paid many playful and chivalrous compliments, but\nmet with very slight encouragement in return.\n\nHow many chimneys Tom swept I cannot say; but he swept so many that\nhe got quite tired, and puzzled too, for they were not like the\ntown flues to which he was accustomed, but such as you would find--\nif you would only get up them and look, which perhaps you would not\nlike to do--in old country-houses, large and crooked chimneys,\nwhich had been altered again and again, till they ran one into\nanother, anastomosing (as Professor Owen would say) considerably.\nSo Tom fairly lost his way in them; not that he cared much for\nthat, though he was in pitchy darkness, for he was as much at home\nin a chimney as a mole is underground; but at last, coming down as\nhe thought the right chimney, he came down the wrong one, and found\nhimself standing on the hearthrug in a room the like of which he\nhad never seen before.\n\nTom had never seen the like.  He had never been in gentlefolks'\nrooms but when the carpets were all up, and the curtains down, and\nthe furniture huddled together under a cloth, and the pictures\ncovered with aprons and dusters; and he had often enough wondered\nwhat the rooms were like when they were all ready for the quality\nto sit in.  And now he saw, and he thought the sight very pretty.\n\nThe room was all dressed in white,--white window-curtains, white\nbed-curtains, white furniture, and white walls, with just a few\nlines of pink here and there.  The carpet was all over gay little\nflowers; and the walls were hung with pictures in gilt frames,\nwhich amused Tom very much.  There were pictures of ladies and\ngentlemen, and pictures of horses and dogs.  The horses he liked;\nbut the dogs he did not care for much, for there were no bull-dogs\namong them, not even a terrier.  But the two pictures which took\nhis fancy most were, one a man in long garments, with little\nchildren and their mothers round him, who was laying his hand upon\nthe children's heads.  That was a very pretty picture, Tom thought,\nto hang in a lady's room.  For he could see that it was a lady's\nroom by the dresses which lay about.\n\nThe other picture was that of a man nailed to a cross, which\nsurprised Tom much.  He fancied that he had seen something like it\nin a shop-window.  But why was it there?  \"Poor man,\" thought Tom,\n\"and he looks so kind and quiet.  But why should the lady have such\na sad picture as that in her room?  Perhaps it was some kinsman of\nhers, who had been murdered by the savages in foreign parts, and\nshe kept it there for a remembrance.\"  And Tom felt sad, and awed,\nand turned to look at something else.\n\nThe next thing he saw, and that too puzzled him, was a washing-\nstand, with ewers and basins, and soap and brushes, and towels, and\na large bath full of clean water--what a heap of things all for\nwashing!  \"She must be a very dirty lady,\" thought Tom, \"by my\nmaster's rule, to want as much scrubbing as all that.  But she must\nbe very cunning to put the dirt out of the way so well afterwards,\nfor I don't see a speck about the room, not even on the very\ntowels.\"\n\nAnd then, looking toward the bed, he saw that dirty lady, and held\nhis breath with astonishment.\n\nUnder the snow-white coverlet, upon the snow-white pillow, lay the\nmost beautiful little girl that Tom had ever seen.  Her cheeks were\nalmost as white as the pillow, and her hair was like threads of\ngold spread all about over the bed.  She might have been as old as\nTom, or maybe a year or two older; but Tom did not think of that.\nHe thought only of her delicate skin and golden hair, and wondered\nwhether she was a real live person, or one of the wax dolls he had\nseen in the shops.  But when he saw her breathe, he made up his\nmind that she was alive, and stood staring at her, as if she had\nbeen an angel out of heaven.\n\nNo.  She cannot be dirty.  She never could have been dirty, thought\nTom to himself.  And then he thought, \"And are all people like that\nwhen they are washed?\"  And he looked at his own wrist, and tried\nto rub the soot off, and wondered whether it ever would come off.\n\"Certainly I should look much prettier then, if I grew at all like\nher.\"\n\nAnd looking round, he suddenly saw, standing close to him, a little\nugly, black, ragged figure, with bleared eyes and grinning white\nteeth.  He turned on it angrily.  What did such a little black ape\nwant in that sweet young lady's room?  And behold, it was himself,\nreflected in a great mirror, the like of which Tom had never seen\nbefore.\n\nAnd Tom, for the first time in his life, found out that he was\ndirty; and burst into tears with shame and anger; and turned to\nsneak up the chimney again and hide; and upset the fender and threw\nthe fire-irons down, with a noise as of ten thousand tin kettles\ntied to ten thousand mad dogs' tails.\n\nUp jumped the little white lady in her bed, and, seeing Tom,\nscreamed as shrill as any peacock.  In rushed a stout old nurse\nfrom the next room, and seeing Tom likewise, made up her mind that\nhe had come to rob, plunder, destroy, and burn; and dashed at him,\nas he lay over the fender, so fast that she caught him by the\njacket.\n\nBut she did not hold him.  Tom had been in a policeman's hands many\na time, and out of them too, what is more; and he would have been\nashamed to face his friends for ever if he had been stupid enough\nto be caught by an old woman; so he doubled under the good lady's\narm, across the room, and out of the window in a moment.\n\nHe did not need to drop out, though he would have done so bravely\nenough.  Nor even to let himself down a spout, which would have\nbeen an old game to him; for once he got up by a spout to the\nchurch roof, he said to take jackdaws' eggs, but the policeman said\nto steal lead; and, when he was seen on high, sat there till the\nsun got too hot, and came down by another spout, leaving the\npolicemen to go back to the stationhouse and eat their dinners.\n\nBut all under the window spread a tree, with great leaves and sweet\nwhite flowers, almost as big as his head.  It was magnolia, I\nsuppose; but Tom knew nothing about that, and cared less; for down\nthe tree he went, like a cat, and across the garden lawn, and over\nthe iron railings and up the park towards the wood, leaving the old\nnurse to scream murder and fire at the window.\n\nThe under gardener, mowing, saw Tom, and threw down his scythe;\ncaught his leg in it, and cut his shin open, whereby he kept his\nbed for a week; but in his hurry he never knew it, and gave chase\nto poor Tom.  The dairymaid heard the noise, got the churn between\nher knees, and tumbled over it, spilling all the cream; and yet she\njumped up, and gave chase to Tom.  A groom cleaning Sir John's hack\nat the stables let him go loose, whereby he kicked himself lame in\nfive minutes; but he ran out and gave chase to Tom.  Grimes upset\nthe soot-sack in the new-gravelled yard, and spoilt it all utterly;\nbut he ran out and gave chase to Tom.  The old steward opened the\npark-gate in such a hurry, that he hung up his pony's chin upon the\nspikes, and, for aught I know, it hangs there still; but he jumped\noff, and gave chase to Tom.  The ploughman left his horses at the\nheadland, and one jumped over the fence, and pulled the other into\nthe ditch, plough and all; but he ran on, and gave chase to Tom.\nThe keeper, who was taking a stoat out of a trap, let the stoat go,\nand caught his own finger; but he jumped up, and ran after Tom; and\nconsidering what he said, and how he looked, I should have been\nsorry for Tom if he had caught him.  Sir John looked out of his\nstudy window (for he was an early old gentleman) and up at the\nnurse, and a marten dropped mud in his eye, so that he had at last\nto send for the doctor; and yet he ran out, and gave chase to Tom.\nThe Irishwoman, too, was walking up to the house to beg,--she must\nhave got round by some byway--but she threw away her bundle, and\ngave chase to Tom likewise.  Only my Lady did not give chase; for\nwhen she had put her head out of the window, her night-wig fell\ninto the garden, and she had to ring up her lady's-maid, and send\nher down for it privately, which quite put her out of the running,\nso that she came in nowhere, and is consequently not placed.\n\nIn a word, never was there heard at Hall Place--not even when the\nfox was killed in the conservatory, among acres of broken glass,\nand tons of smashed flower-pots--such a noise, row, hubbub, babel,\nshindy, hullabaloo, stramash, charivari, and total contempt of\ndignity, repose, and order, as that day, when Grimes, gardener, the\ngroom, the dairymaid, Sir John, the steward, the ploughman, the\nkeeper, and the Irishwoman, all ran up the park, shouting, \"Stop\nthief,\" in the belief that Tom had at least a thousand pounds'\nworth of jewels in his empty pockets; and the very magpies and jays\nfollowed Tom up, screaking and screaming, as if he were a hunted\nfox, beginning to droop his brush.\n\nAnd all the while poor Tom paddled up the park with his little bare\nfeet, like a small black gorilla fleeing to the forest.  Alas for\nhim! there was no big father gorilla therein to take his part--to\nscratch out the gardener's inside with one paw, toss the dairymaid\ninto a tree with another, and wrench off Sir John's head with a\nthird, while he cracked the keeper's skull with his teeth as easily\nas if it had been a cocoa-nut or a paving-stone.\n\nHowever, Tom did not remember ever having had a father; so he did\nnot look for one, and expected to have to take care of himself;\nwhile as for running, he could keep up for a couple of miles with\nany stage-coach, if there was the chance of a copper or a cigar-\nend, and turn coach-wheels on his hands and feet ten times\nfollowing, which is more than you can do.  Wherefore his pursuers\nfound it very difficult to catch him; and we will hope that they\ndid not catch him at all.\n\nTom, of course, made for the woods.  He had never been in a wood in\nhis life; but he was sharp enough to know that he might hide in a\nbush, or swarm up a tree, and, altogether, had more chance there\nthan in the open.  If he had not known that, he would have been\nfoolisher than a mouse or a minnow.\n\nBut when he got into the wood, he found it a very different sort of\nplace from what he had fancied.  He pushed into a thick cover of\nrhododendrons, and found himself at once caught in a trap.  The\nboughs laid hold of his legs and arms, poked him in his face and\nhis stomach, made him shut his eyes tight (though that was no great\nloss, for he could not see at best a yard before his nose); and\nwhen he got through the rhododendrons, the hassock-grass and sedges\ntumbled him over, and cut his poor little fingers afterwards most\nspitefully; the birches birched him as soundly as if he had been a\nnobleman at Eton, and over the face too (which is not fair swishing\nas all brave boys will agree); and the lawyers tripped him up, and\ntore his shins as if they had sharks' teeth--which lawyers are\nlikely enough to have.\n\n\"I must get out of this,\" thought Tom, \"or I shall stay here till\nsomebody comes to help me--which is just what I don't want.\"\n\nBut how to get out was the difficult matter.  And indeed I don't\nthink he would ever have got out at all, but have stayed there till\nthe cock-robins covered him with leaves, if he had not suddenly run\nhis head against a wall.\n\nNow running your head against a wall is not pleasant, especially if\nit is a loose wall, with the stones all set on edge, and a sharp\ncornered one hits you between the eyes and makes you see all manner\nof beautiful stars.  The stars are very beautiful, certainly; but\nunfortunately they go in the twenty-thousandth part of a split\nsecond, and the pain which comes after them does not.  And so Tom\nhurt his head; but he was a brave boy, and did not mind that a\npenny.  He guessed that over the wall the cover would end; and up\nit he went, and over like a squirrel.\n\nAnd there he was, out on the great grouse-moors, which the country\nfolk called Harthover Fell--heather and bog and rock, stretching\naway and up, up to the very sky.\n\nNow, Tom was a cunning little fellow--as cunning as an old Exmoor\nstag.  Why not?  Though he was but ten years old, he had lived\nlonger than most stags, and had more wits to start with into the\nbargain.\n\nHe knew as well as a stag, that if he backed he might throw the\nhounds out.  So the first thing he did when he was over the wall\nwas to make the neatest double sharp to his right, and run along\nunder the wall for nearly half a mile.\n\nWhereby Sir John, and the keeper, and the steward, and the\ngardener, and the ploughman, and the dairymaid, and all the hue-\nand-cry together, went on ahead half a mile in the very opposite\ndirection, and inside the wall, leaving him a mile off on the\noutside; while Tom heard their shouts die away in the woods and\nchuckled to himself merrily.\n\nAt last he came to a dip in the land, and went to the bottom of it,\nand then he turned bravely away from the wall and up the moor; for\nhe knew that he had put a hill between him and his enemies, and\ncould go on without their seeing him.\n\nBut the Irishwoman, alone of them all, had seen which way Tom went.\nShe had kept ahead of every one the whole time; and yet she neither\nwalked nor ran.  She went along quite smoothly and gracefully,\nwhile her feet twinkled past each other so fast that you could not\nsee which was foremost; till every one asked the other who the\nstrange woman was; and all agreed, for want of anything better to\nsay, that she must be in league with Tom.\n\nBut when she came to the plantation, they lost sight of her; and\nthey could do no less.  For she went quietly over the wall after\nTom, and followed him wherever he went.  Sir John and the rest saw\nno more of her; and out of sight was out of mind.\n\nAnd now Tom was right away into the heather, over just such a moor\nas those in which you have been bred, except that there were rocks\nand stones lying about everywhere, and that, instead of the moor\ngrowing flat as he went upwards, it grew more and more broken and\nhilly, but not so rough but that little Tom could jog along well\nenough, and find time, too, to stare about at the strange place,\nwhich was like a new world to him.\n\nHe saw great spiders there, with crowns and crosses marked on their\nbacks, who sat in the middle of their webs, and when they saw Tom\ncoming, shook them so fast that they became invisible.  Then he saw\nlizards, brown and gray and green, and thought they were snakes,\nand would sting him; but they were as much frightened as he, and\nshot away into the heath.  And then, under a rock, he saw a pretty\nsight--a great brown, sharp-nosed creature, with a white tag to her\nbrush, and round her four or five smutty little cubs, the funniest\nfellows Tom ever saw.  She lay on her back, rolling about, and\nstretching out her legs and head and tail in the bright sunshine;\nand the cubs jumped over her, and ran round her, and nibbled her\npaws, and lugged her about by the tail; and she seemed to enjoy it\nmightily.  But one selfish little fellow stole away from the rest\nto a dead crow close by, and dragged it off to hide it, though it\nwas nearly as big as he was.  Whereat all his little brothers set\noff after him in full cry, and saw Tom; and then all ran back, and\nup jumped Mrs. Vixen, and caught one up in her mouth, and the rest\ntoddled after her, and into a dark crack in the rocks; and there\nwas an end of the show.\n\nAnd next he had a fright; for, as he scrambled up a sandy brow--\nwhirr-poof-poof-cock-cock-kick--something went off in his face,\nwith a most horrid noise.  He thought the ground had blown up, and\nthe end of the world come.\n\nAnd when he opened his eyes (for he shut them very tight) it was\nonly an old cock-grouse, who had been washing himself in sand, like\nan Arab, for want of water; and who, when Tom had all but trodden\non him, jumped up with a noise like the express train, leaving his\nwife and children to shift for themselves, like an old coward, and\nwent off, screaming \"Cur-ru-u-uck, cur-ru-u-uck--murder, thieves,\nfire--cur-u-uck-cock-kick--the end of the world is come--kick-kick-\ncock-kick.\"  He was always fancying that the end of the world was\ncome, when anything happened which was farther off than the end of\nhis own nose.  But the end of the world was not come, any more than\nthe twelfth of August was; though the old grouse-cock was quite\ncertain of it.\n\nSo the old grouse came back to his wife and family an hour\nafterwards, and said solemnly, \"Cock-cock-kick; my dears, the end\nof the world is not quite come; but I assure you it is coming the\nday after to-morrow--cock.\"  But his wife had heard that so often\nthat she knew all about it, and a little more.  And, besides, she\nwas the mother of a family, and had seven little poults to wash and\nfeed every day; and that made her very practical, and a little\nsharp-tempered; so all she answered was:  \"Kick-kick-kick--go and\ncatch spiders, go and catch spiders--kick.\"\n\nSo Tom went on and on, he hardly knew why; but he liked the great\nwide strange place, and the cool fresh bracing air.  But he went\nmore and more slowly as he got higher up the hill; for now the\nground grew very bad indeed.  Instead of soft turf and springy\nheather, he met great patches of flat limestone rock, just like\nill-made pavements, with deep cracks between the stones and ledges,\nfilled with ferns; so he had to hop from stone to stone, and now\nand then he slipped in between, and hurt his little bare toes,\nthough they were tolerably tough ones; but still he would go on and\nup, he could not tell why.\n\nWhat would Tom have said if he had seen, walking over the moor\nbehind him, the very same Irishwoman who had taken his part upon\nthe road?  But whether it was that he looked too little behind him,\nor whether it was that she kept out of sight behind the rocks and\nknolls, he never saw her, though she saw him.\n\nAnd now he began to get a little hungry, and very thirsty; for he\nhad run a long way, and the sun had risen high in heaven, and the\nrock was as hot as an oven, and the air danced reels over it, as it\ndoes over a limekiln, till everything round seemed quivering and\nmelting in the glare.\n\nBut he could see nothing to eat anywhere, and still less to drink.\n\nThe heath was full of bilberries and whimberries; but they were\nonly in flower yet, for it was June.  And as for water; who can\nfind that on the top of a limestone rock?  Now and then he passed\nby a deep dark swallow-hole, going down into the earth, as if it\nwas the chimney of some dwarfs house underground; and more than\nonce, as he passed, he could hear water falling, trickling,\ntinkling, many many feet below.  How he longed to get down to it,\nand cool his poor baked lips!  But, brave little chimney-sweep as\nhe was, he dared not climb down such chimneys as those.\n\nSo he went on and on, till his head spun round with the heat, and\nhe thought he heard church-bells ringing a long way off.\n\n\"Ah!\" he thought, \"where there is a church there will be houses and\npeople; and, perhaps, some one will give me a bit and a sup.\"  So\nhe set off again, to look for the church; for he was sure that he\nheard the bells quite plain.\n\nAnd in a minute more, when he looked round, he stopped again, and\nsaid, \"Why, what a big place the world is!\"\n\nAnd so it was; for, from the top of the mountain he could see--what\ncould he not see?\n\nBehind him, far below, was Harthover, and the dark woods, and the\nshining salmon river; and on his left, far below, was the town, and\nthe smoking chimneys of the collieries; and far, far away, the\nriver widened to the shining sea; and little white specks, which\nwere ships, lay on its bosom.  Before him lay, spread out like a\nmap, great plains, and farms, and villages, amid dark knots of\ntrees.  They all seemed at his very feet; but he had sense to see\nthat they were long miles away.\n\nAnd to his right rose moor after moor, hill after hill, till they\nfaded away, blue into blue sky.  But between him and those moors,\nand really at his very feet, lay something, to which, as soon as\nTom saw it, he determined to go, for that was the place for him.\n\nA deep, deep green and rocky valley, very narrow, and filled with\nwood; but through the wood, hundreds of feet below him, he could\nsee a clear stream glance.  Oh, if he could but get down to that\nstream!  Then, by the stream, he saw the roof of a little cottage,\nand a little garden set out in squares and beds.  And there was a\ntiny little red thing moving in the garden, no bigger than a fly.\nAs Tom looked down, he saw that it was a woman in a red petticoat.\nAh! perhaps she would give him something to eat.  And there were\nthe church-bells ringing again.  Surely there must be a village\ndown there.  Well, nobody would know him, or what had happened at\nthe Place.  The news could not have got there yet, even if Sir John\nhad set all the policemen in the county after him; and he could get\ndown there in five minutes.\n\nTom was quite right about the hue-and-cry not having got thither;\nfor he had come without knowing it, the best part of ten miles from\nHarthover; but he was wrong about getting down in five minutes, for\nthe cottage was more than a mile off, and a good thousand feet\nbelow.\n\nHowever, down he went; like a brave little man as he was, though he\nwas very footsore, and tired, and hungry, and thirsty; while the\nchurch-bells rang so loud, he began to think that they must be\ninside his own head, and the river chimed and tinkled far below;\nand this was the song which it sang:-\n\n\nClear and cool, clear and cool,\nBy laughing shallow, and dreaming pool;\nCool and clear, cool and clear,\nBy shining shingle, and foaming wear;\nUnder the crag where the ouzel sings,\nAnd the ivied wall where the church-bell rings,\nUndefiled, for the undefiled;\nPlay by me, bathe in me, mother and child.\n\nDank and foul, dank and foul,\nBy the smoky town in its murky cowl;\nFoul and dank, foul and dank,\nBy wharf and sewer and slimy bank;\nDarker and darker the farther I go,\nBaser and baser the richer I grow;\nWho dares sport with the sin-defiled?\nShrink from me, turn from me, mother and child.\n\nStrong and free, strong and free,\nThe floodgates are open, away to the sea,\nFree and strong, free and strong,\nCleansing my streams as I hurry along,\nTo the golden sands, and the leaping bar,\nAnd the taintless tide that awaits me afar.\nAs I lose myself in the infinite main,\nLike a soul that has sinned and is pardoned again.\nUndefiled, for the undefiled;\nPlay by me, bathe in me, mother and child.\n\n\nSo Tom went down; and all the while he never saw the Irishwoman\ngoing down behind him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\n\n\"And is there care in heaven? and is there love\nIn heavenly spirits to these creatures base\nThat may compassion of their evils move?\nThere is:- else much more wretched were the case\nOf men than beasts:  But oh! the exceeding grace\nOf Highest God that loves His creatures so,\nAnd all His works with mercy doth embrace,\nThat blessed Angels He sends to and fro,\nTo serve to wicked man, to serve His wicked foe!\"\n\nSPENSER.\n\n\nA mile off, and a thousand feet down.\n\nSo Tom found it; though it seemed as if he could have chucked a\npebble on to the back of the woman in the red petticoat who was\nweeding in the garden, or even across the dale to the rocks beyond.\nFor the bottom of the valley was just one field broad, and on the\nother side ran the stream; and above it, gray crag, gray down, gray\nstair, gray moor walled up to heaven.\n\nA quiet, silent, rich, happy place; a narrow crack cut deep into\nthe earth; so deep, and so out of the way, that the bad bogies can\nhardly find it out.  The name of the place is Vendale; and if you\nwant to see it for yourself, you must go up into the High Craven,\nand search from Bolland Forest north by Ingleborough, to the Nine\nStandards and Cross Fell; and if you have not found it, you must\nturn south, and search the Lake Mountains, down to Scaw Fell and\nthe sea; and then, if you have not found it, you must go northward\nagain by merry Carlisle, and search the Cheviots all across, from\nAnnan Water to Berwick Law; and then, whether you have found\nVendale or not, you will have found such a country, and such a\npeople, as ought to make you proud of being a British boy.\n\nSo Tom went to go down; and first he went down three hundred feet\nof steep heather, mixed up with loose brown grindstone, as rough as\na file; which was not pleasant to his poor little heels, as he came\nbump, stump, jump, down the steep.  And still he thought he could\nthrow a stone into the garden.\n\nThen he went down three hundred feet of lime-stone terraces, one\nbelow the other, as straight as if a carpenter had ruled them with\nhis ruler and then cut them out with his chisel.  There was no\nheath there, but -\n\nFirst, a little grass slope, covered with the prettiest flowers,\nrockrose and saxifrage, and thyme and basil, and all sorts of sweet\nherbs.\n\nThen bump down a two-foot step of limestone.\n\nThen another bit of grass and flowers.\n\nThen bump down a one-foot step.\n\nThen another bit of grass and flowers for fifty yards, as steep as\nthe house-roof, where he had to slide down on his dear little tail.\n\nThen another step of stone, ten feet high; and there he had to stop\nhimself, and crawl along the edge to find a crack; for if he had\nrolled over, he would have rolled right into the old woman's\ngarden, and frightened her out of her wits.\n\nThen, when he had found a dark narrow crack, full of green-stalked\nfern, such as hangs in the basket in the drawing-room, and had\ncrawled down through it, with knees and elbows, as he would down a\nchimney, there was another grass slope, and another step, and so\non, till--oh, dear me!  I wish it was all over; and so did he.  And\nyet he thought he could throw a stone into the old woman's garden.\n\nAt last he came to a bank of beautiful shrubs; white-beam with its\ngreat silver-backed leaves, and mountain-ash, and oak; and below\nthem cliff and crag, cliff and crag, with great beds of crown-ferns\nand wood-sedge; while through the shrubs he could see the stream\nsparkling, and hear it murmur on the white pebbles.  He did not\nknow that it was three hundred feet below.\n\nYou would have been giddy, perhaps, at looking down:  but Tom was\nnot.  He was a brave little chimney-sweep; and when he found\nhimself on the top of a high cliff, instead of sitting down and\ncrying for his baba (though he never had had any baba to cry for),\nhe said, \"Ah, this will just suit me!\" though he was very tired;\nand down he went, by stock and stone, sedge and ledge, bush and\nrush, as if he had been born a jolly little black ape, with four\nhands instead of two.\n\nAnd all the while he never saw the Irishwoman coming down behind\nhim.\n\nBut he was getting terribly tired now.  The burning sun on the\nfells had sucked him up; but the damp heat of the woody crag sucked\nhim up still more; and the perspiration ran out of the ends of his\nfingers and toes, and washed him cleaner than he had been for a\nwhole year.  But, of course, he dirtied everything, terribly as he\nwent.  There has been a great black smudge all down the crag ever\nsince.  And there have been more black beetles in Vendale since\nthan ever were known before; all, of course, owing to Tom's having\nblacked the original papa of them all, just as he was setting off\nto be married, with a sky-blue coat and scarlet leggins, as smart\nas a gardener's dog with a polyanthus in his mouth.\n\nAt last he got to the bottom.  But, behold, it was not the bottom--\nas people usually find when they are coming down a mountain.  For\nat the foot of the crag were heaps and heaps of fallen limestone of\nevery size from that of your head to that of a stage-waggon, with\nholes between them full of sweet heath-fern; and before Tom got\nthrough them, he was out in the bright sunshine again; and then he\nfelt, once for all and suddenly, as people generally do, that he\nwas b-e-a-t, beat.\n\nYou must expect to be beat a few times in your life, little man, if\nyou live such a life as a man ought to live, let you be as strong\nand healthy as you may:  and when you are, you will find it a very\nugly feeling.  I hope that that day you may have a stout staunch\nfriend by you who is not beat; for, if you have not, you had best\nlie where you are, and wait for better times, as poor Tom did.\n\nHe could not get on.  The sun was burning, and yet he felt chill\nall over.  He was quite empty, and yet he felt quite sick.  There\nwas but two hundred yards of smooth pasture between him and the\ncottage, and yet he could not walk down it.  He could hear the\nstream murmuring only one field beyond it, and yet it seemed to him\nas if it was a hundred miles off.\n\nHe lay down on the grass till the beetles ran over him, and the\nflies settled on his nose.  I don't know when he would have got up\nagain, if the gnats and the midges had not taken compassion on him.\nBut the gnats blew their trumpets so loud in his ear, and the\nmidges nibbled so at his hands and face wherever they could find a\nplace free from soot, that at last he woke up, and stumbled away,\ndown over a low wall, and into a narrow road, and up to the\ncottage-door.\n\nAnd a neat pretty cottage it was, with clipped yew hedges all round\nthe garden, and yews inside too, cut into peacocks and trumpets and\nteapots and all kinds of queer shapes.  And out of the open door\ncame a noise like that of the frogs on the Great-A, when they know\nthat it is going to be scorching hot to-morrow--and how they know\nthat I don't know, and you don't know, and nobody knows.\n\nHe came slowly up to the open door, which was all hung round with\nclematis and roses; and then peeped in, half afraid.\n\nAnd there sat by the empty fireplace, which was filled with a pot\nof sweet herbs, the nicest old woman that ever was seen, in her red\npetticoat, and short dimity bedgown, and clean white cap, with a\nblack silk handkerchief over it, tied under her chin.  At her feet\nsat the grandfather of all the cats; and opposite her sat, on two\nbenches, twelve or fourteen neat, rosy, chubby little children,\nlearning their Chris-cross-row; and gabble enough they made about\nit.\n\nSuch a pleasant cottage it was, with a shiny clean stone floor, and\ncurious old prints on the walls, and an old black oak sideboard\nfull of bright pewter and brass dishes, and a cuckoo clock in the\ncorner, which began shouting as soon as Tom appeared:  not that it\nwas frightened at Tom, but that it was just eleven o'clock.\n\nAll the children started at Tom's dirty black figure,--the girls\nbegan to cry, and the boys began to laugh, and all pointed at him\nrudely enough; but Tom was too tired to care for that.\n\n\"What art thou, and what dost want?\" cried the old dame.  \"A\nchimney-sweep!  Away with thee!  I'll have no sweeps here.\"\n\n\"Water,\" said poor little Tom, quite faint.\n\n\"Water?  There's plenty i' the beck,\" she said, quite sharply.\n\n\"But I can't get there; I'm most clemmed with hunger and drought.\"\nAnd Tom sank down upon the door-step, and laid his head against the\npost.\n\nAnd the old dame looked at him through her spectacles one minute,\nand two, and three; and then she said, \"He's sick; and a bairn's a\nbairn, sweep or none.\"\n\n\"Water,\" said Tom.\n\n\"God forgive me!\" and she put by her spectacles, and rose, and came\nto Tom.  \"Water's bad for thee; I'll give thee milk.\"  And she\ntoddled off into the next room, and brought a cup of milk and a bit\nof bread.\n\nTom drank the milk off at one draught, and then looked up, revived.\n\n\"Where didst come from?\" said the dame.\n\n\"Over Fell, there,\" said Tom, and pointed up into the sky.\n\n\"Over Harthover? and down Lewthwaite Crag?  Art sure thou art not\nlying?\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" said Tom, and leant his head against the post.\n\n\"And how got ye up there?\"\n\n\"I came over from the Place;\" and Tom was so tired and desperate he\nhad no heart or time to think of a story, so he told all the truth\nin a few words.\n\n\"Bless thy little heart!  And thou hast not been stealing, then?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Bless thy little heart! and I'll warrant not.  Why, God's guided\nthe bairn, because he was innocent!  Away from the Place, and over\nHarthover Fell, and down Lewthwaite Crag!  Who ever heard the like,\nif God hadn't led him?  Why dost not eat thy bread?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"It's good enough, for I made it myself.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said Tom, and he laid his head on his knees, and then\nasked -\n\n\"Is it Sunday?\"\n\n\"No, then; why should it be?\"\n\n\"Because I hear the church-bells ringing so.\"\n\n\"Bless thy pretty heart!  The bairn's sick.  Come wi' me, and I'll\nhap thee up somewhere.  If thou wert a bit cleaner I'd put thee in\nmy own bed, for the Lord's sake.  But come along here.\"\n\nBut when Tom tried to get up, he was so tired and giddy that she\nhad to help him and lead him.\n\nShe put him in an outhouse upon soft sweet hay and an old rug, and\nbade him sleep off his walk, and she would come to him when school\nwas over, in an hour's time.\n\nAnd so she went in again, expecting Tom to fall fast asleep at\nonce.\n\nBut Tom did not fall asleep.\n\nInstead of it he turned and tossed and kicked about in the\nstrangest way, and felt so hot all over that he longed to get into\nthe river and cool himself; and then he fell half asleep, and\ndreamt that he heard the little white lady crying to him, \"Oh,\nyou're so dirty; go and be washed;\" and then that he heard the\nIrishwoman saying, \"Those that wish to be clean, clean they will\nbe.\"  And then he heard the church-bells ring so loud, close to him\ntoo, that he was sure it must be Sunday, in spite of what the old\ndame had said; and he would go to church, and see what a church was\nlike inside, for he had never been in one, poor little fellow, in\nall his life.  But the people would never let him come in, all over\nsoot and dirt like that.  He must go to the river and wash first.\nAnd he said out loud again and again, though being half asleep he\ndid not know it, \"I must be clean, I must be clean.\"\n\nAnd all of a sudden he found himself, not in the outhouse on the\nhay, but in the middle of a meadow, over the road, with the stream\njust before him, saying continually, \"I must be clean, I must be\nclean.\"  He had got there on his own legs, between sleep and awake,\nas children will often get out of bed, and go about the room, when\nthey are not quite well.  But he was not a bit surprised, and went\non to the bank of the brook, and lay down on the grass, and looked\ninto the clear, clear limestone water, with every pebble at the\nbottom bright and clean, while the little silver trout dashed about\nin fright at the sight of his black face; and he dipped his hand in\nand found it so cool, cool, cool; and he said, \"I will be a fish; I\nwill swim in the water; I must be clean, I must be clean.\"\n\nSo he pulled off all his clothes in such haste that he tore some of\nthem, which was easy enough with such ragged old things.  And he\nput his poor hot sore feet into the water; and then his legs; and\nthe farther he went in, the more the church-bells rang in his head.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Tom, \"I must be quick and wash myself; the bells are\nringing quite loud now; and they will stop soon, and then the door\nwill be shut, and I shall never be able to get in at all.\"\n\nTom was mistaken:  for in England the church doors are left open\nall service time, for everybody who likes to come in, Churchman or\nDissenter; ay, even if he were a Turk or a Heathen; and if any man\ndared to turn him out, as long as he behaved quietly, the good old\nEnglish law would punish that man, as he deserved, for ordering any\npeaceable person out of God's house, which belongs to all alike.\nBut Tom did not know that, any more than he knew a great deal more\nwhich people ought to know.\n\nAnd all the while he never saw the Irishwoman, not behind him this\ntime, but before.\n\nFor just before he came to the river side, she had stept down into\nthe cool clear water; and her shawl and her petticoat floated off\nher, and the green water-weeds floated round her sides, and the\nwhite water-lilies floated round her head, and the fairies of the\nstream came up from the bottom and bore her away and down upon\ntheir arms; for she was the Queen of them all; and perhaps of more\nbesides.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" they asked her.\n\n\"I have been smoothing sick folks' pillows, and whispering sweet\ndreams into their ears; opening cottage casements, to let out the\nstifling air; coaxing little children away from gutters, and foul\npools where fever breeds; turning women from the gin-shop door, and\nstaying men's hands as they were going to strike their wives; doing\nall I can to help those who will not help themselves:  and little\nenough that is, and weary work for me.  But I have brought you a\nnew little brother, and watched him safe all the way here.\"\n\nThen all the fairies laughed for joy at the thought that they had a\nlittle brother coming.\n\n\"But mind, maidens, he must not see you, or know that you are here.\nHe is but a savage now, and like the beasts which perish; and from\nthe beasts which perish he must learn.  So you must not play with\nhim, or speak to him, or let him see you:  but only keep him from\nbeing harmed.\"\n\nThen the fairies were sad, because they could not play with their\nnew brother, but they always did what they were told.\n\nAnd their Queen floated away down the river; and whither she went,\nthither she came.  But all this Tom, of course, never saw or heard:\nand perhaps if he had it would have made little difference in the\nstory; for was so hot and thirsty, and longed so to be clean for\nonce, that he tumbled himself as quick as he could into the clear\ncool stream.\n\nAnd he had not been in it two minutes before he fell fast asleep,\ninto the quietest, sunniest, cosiest sleep that ever he had in his\nlife; and he dreamt about the green meadows by which he had walked\nthat morning, and the tall elm-trees, and the sleeping cows; and\nafter that he dreamt of nothing at all.\n\nThe reason of his falling into such a delightful sleep is very\nsimple; and yet hardly any one has found it out.  It was merely\nthat the fairies took him.\n\nSome people think that there are no fairies.  Cousin Cramchild\ntells little folks so in his Conversations.  Well, perhaps there\nare none--in Boston, U.S., where he was raised.  There are only a\nclumsy lot of spirits there, who can't make people hear without\nthumping on the table:  but they get their living thereby, and I\nsuppose that is all they want.  And Aunt Agitate, in her Arguments\non political economy, says there are none.  Well, perhaps there are\nnone--in her political economy.  But it is a wide world, my little\nman--and thank Heaven for it, for else, between crinolines and\ntheories, some of us would get squashed--and plenty of room in it\nfor fairies, without people seeing them; unless, of course, they\nlook in the right place.  The most wonderful and the strongest\nthings in the world, you know, are just the things which no one can\nsee.  There is life in you; and it is the life in you which makes\nyou grow, and move, and think:  and yet you can't see it.  And\nthere is steam in a steam-engine; and that is what makes it move:\nand yet you can't see it; and so there may be fairies in the world,\nand they may be just what makes the world go round to the old tune\nof\n\n\n\"C'est l'amour, l'amour, l'amour\nQui fait la monde a la ronde:\"\n\n\nand yet no one may be able to see them except those whose hearts\nare going round to that same tune.  At all events, we will make\nbelieve that there are fairies in the world.  It will not be the\nlast time by many a one that we shall have to make believe.  And\nyet, after all, there is no need for that.  There must be fairies;\nfor this is a fairy tale:  and how can one have a fairy tale if\nthere are no fairies?\n\nYou don't see the logic of that?  Perhaps not.  Then please not to\nsee the logic of a great many arguments exactly like it, which you\nwill hear before your beard is gray.\n\nThe kind old dame came back at twelve, when school was over, to\nlook at Tom:  but there was no Tom there.  She looked about for his\nfootprints; but the ground was so hard that there was no slot, as\nthey say in dear old North Devon.  And if you grow up to be a brave\nhealthy man, you may know some day what no slot means, and know\ntoo, I hope, what a slot does mean--a broad slot, with blunt claws,\nwhich makes a man put out his cigar, and set his teeth, and tighten\nhis girths, when he sees it; and what his rights mean, if he has\nthem, brow, bay, tray, and points; and see something worth seeing\nbetween Haddon Wood and Countisbury Cliff, with good Mr. Palk\nCollyns to show you the way, and mend your bones as fast as you\nsmash them.  Only when that jolly day comes, please don't break\nyour neck; stogged in a mire you never will be, I trust; for you\nare a heath-cropper bred and born.\n\nSo the old dame went in again quite sulky, thinking that little Tom\nhad tricked her with a false story, and shammed ill, and then run\naway again.\n\nBut she altered her mind the next day.  For, when Sir John and the\nrest of them had run themselves out of breath, and lost Tom, they\nwent back again, looking very foolish.\n\nAnd they looked more foolish still when Sir John heard more of the\nstory from the nurse; and more foolish still, again, when they\nheard the whole story from Miss Ellie, the little lady in white.\nAll she had seen was a poor little black chimney-sweep, crying and\nsobbing, and going to get up the chimney again.  Of course, she was\nvery much frightened:  and no wonder.  But that was all.  The boy\nhad taken nothing in the room; by the mark of his little sooty\nfeet, they could see that he had never been off the hearthrug till\nthe nurse caught hold of him.  It was all a mistake.\n\nSo Sir John told Grimes to go home, and promised him five shillings\nif he would bring the boy quietly up to him, without beating him,\nthat he might be sure of the truth.  For he took for granted, and\nGrimes too, that Tom had made his way home.\n\nBut no Tom came back to Mr. Grimes that evening; and he went to the\npolice-office, to tell them to look out for the boy.  But no Tom\nwas heard of.  As for his having gone over those great fells to\nVendale, they no more dreamed of that than of his having gone to\nthe moon.\n\nSo Mr. Grimes came up to Harthover next day with a very sour face;\nbut when he got there, Sir John was over the hills and far away;\nand Mr. Grimes had to sit in the outer servants' hall all day, and\ndrink strong ale to wash away his sorrows; and they were washed\naway long before Sir John came back.\n\nFor good Sir John had slept very badly that night; and he said to\nhis lady, \"My dear, the boy must have got over into the grouse-\nmoors, and lost himself; and he lies very heavily on my conscience,\npoor little lad.  But I know what I will do.\"\n\nSo, at five the next morning up he got, and into his bath, and into\nhis shooting-jacket and gaiters, and into the stableyard, like a\nfine old English gentleman, with a face as red as a rose, and a\nhand as hard as a table, and a back as broad as a bullock's; and\nbade them bring his shooting pony, and the keeper to come on his\npony, and the huntsman, and the first whip, and the second whip,\nand the under-keeper with the bloodhound in a leash--a great dog as\ntall as a calf, of the colour of a gravel-walk, with mahogany ears\nand nose, and a throat like a church-bell.  They took him up to the\nplace where Tom had gone into the wood; and there the hound lifted\nup his mighty voice, and told them all he knew.\n\nThen he took them to the place where Tom had climbed the wall; and\nthey shoved it down, and all got through.\n\nAnd then the wise dog took them over the moor, and over the fells,\nstep by step, very slowly; for the scent was a day old, you know,\nand very light from the heat and drought.  But that was why cunning\nold Sir John started at five in the morning.\n\nAnd at last he came to the top of Lewthwaite Crag, and there he\nbayed, and looked up in their faces, as much as to say, \"I tell you\nhe is gone down here!\"\n\nThey could hardly believe that Tom would have gone so far; and when\nthey looked at that awful cliff, they could never believe that he\nwould have dared to face it.  But if the dog said so, it must be\ntrue.\n\n\"Heaven forgive us!\" said Sir John.  \"If we find him at all, we\nshall find him lying at the bottom.\"  And he slapped his great hand\nupon his great thigh, and said -\n\n\"Who will go down over Lewthwaite Crag, and see if that boy is\nalive?  Oh that I were twenty years younger, and I would go down\nmyself!\"  And so he would have done, as well as any sweep in the\ncounty.  Then he said -\n\n\"Twenty pounds to the man who brings me that boy alive!\" and as was\nhis way, what he said he meant.\n\nNow among the lot was a little groom-boy, a very little groom\nindeed; and he was the same who had ridden up the court, and told\nTom to come to the Hall; and he said -\n\n\"Twenty pounds or none, I will go down over Lewthwaite Crag, if\nit's only for the poor boy's sake.  For he was as civil a spoken\nlittle chap as ever climbed a flue.\"\n\nSo down over Lewthwaite Crag he went:  a very smart groom he was at\nthe top, and a very shabby one at the bottom; for he tore his\ngaiters, and he tore his breeches, and he tore his jacket, and he\nburst his braces, and he burst his boots, and he lost his hat, and\nwhat was worst of all, he lost his shirt pin, which he prized very\nmuch, for it was gold, and he had won it in a raffle at Malton, and\nthere was a figure at the top of it, of t'ould mare, noble old\nBeeswing herself, as natural as life; so it was a really severe\nloss:  but he never saw anything of Tom.\n\nAnd all the while Sir John and the rest were riding round, full\nthree miles to the right, and back again, to get into Vendale, and\nto the foot of the crag.\n\nWhen they came to the old dame's school, all the children came out\nto see.  And the old dame came out too; and when she saw Sir John,\nshe curtsied very low, for she was a tenant of his.\n\n\"Well, dame, and how are you?\" said Sir John.\n\n\"Blessings on you as broad as your back, Harthover,\" says she--she\ndidn't call him Sir John, but only Harthover, for that is the\nfashion in the North country--\"and welcome into Vendale:  but\nyou're no hunting the fox this time of the year?\"\n\n\"I am hunting, and strange game too,\" said he.\n\n\"Blessings on your heart, and what makes you look so sad the morn?\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a lost child, a chimney-sweep, that is run away.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harthover, Harthover,\" says she, \"ye were always a just man\nand a merciful; and ye'll no harm the poor little lad if I give you\ntidings of him?\"\n\n\"Not I, not I, dame.  I'm afraid we hunted him out of the house all\non a miserable mistake, and the hound has brought him to the top of\nLewthwaite Crag, and--\"\n\nWhereat the old dame broke out crying, without letting him finish\nhis story.\n\n\"So he told me the truth after all, poor little dear!  Ah, first\nthoughts are best, and a body's heart'll guide them right, if they\nwill but hearken to it.\"  And then she told Sir John all.\n\n\"Bring the dog here, and lay him on,\" said Sir John, without\nanother word, and he set his teeth very hard.\n\nAnd the dog opened at once; and went away at the back of the\ncottage, over the road, and over the meadow, and through a bit of\nalder copse; and there, upon an alder stump, they saw Tom's clothes\nlying.  And then they knew as much about it all as there was any\nneed to know.\n\nAnd Tom?\n\nAh, now comes the most wonderful part of this wonderful story.\nTom, when he woke, for of course he woke--children always wake\nafter they have slept exactly as long as is good for them--found\nhimself swimming about in the stream, being about four inches, or--\nthat I may be accurate--3.87902 inches long and having round the\nparotid region of his fauces a set of external gills (I hope you\nunderstand all the big words) just like those of a sucking eft,\nwhich he mistook for a lace frill, till he pulled at them, found he\nhurt himself, and made up his mind that they were part of himself,\nand best left alone.\n\nIn fact, the fairies had turned him into a water-baby.\n\nA water-baby?  You never heard of a water-baby.  Perhaps not.  That\nis the very reason why this story was written.  There are a great\nmany things in the world which you never heard of; and a great many\nmore which nobody ever heard of; and a great many things, too,\nwhich nobody will ever hear of, at least until the coming of the\nCocqcigrues, when man shall be the measure of all things.\n\n\"But there are no such things as water-babies.\"\n\nHow do you know that?  Have you been there to see?  And if you had\nbeen there to see, and had seen none, that would not prove that\nthere were none.  If Mr. Garth does not find a fox in Eversley\nWood--as folks sometimes fear he never will--that does not prove\nthat there are no such things as foxes.  And as is Eversley Wood to\nall the woods in England, so are the waters we know to all the\nwaters in the world.  And no one has a right to say that no water-\nbabies exist, till they have seen no water-babies existing; which\nis quite a different thing, mind, from not seeing water-babies; and\na thing which nobody ever did, or perhaps ever will do.\n\n\"But surely if there were water-babies, somebody would have caught\none at least?\"\n\nWell.  How do you know that somebody has not?\n\n\"But they would have put it into spirits, or into the Illustrated\nNews, or perhaps cut it into two halves, poor dear little thing,\nand sent one to Professor Owen, and one to Professor Huxley, to see\nwhat they would each say about it.\"\n\nAh, my dear little man! that does not follow at all, as you will\nsee before the end of the story.\n\n\"But a water-baby is contrary to nature.\"\n\nWell, but, my dear little man, you must learn to talk about such\nthings, when you grow older, in a very different way from that.\nYou must not talk about \"ain't\" and \"can't\" when you speak of this\ngreat wonderful world round you, of which the wisest man knows only\nthe very smallest corner, and is, as the great Sir Isaac Newton\nsaid, only a child picking up pebbles on the shore of a boundless\nocean.\n\nYou must not say that this cannot be, or that that is contrary to\nnature.  You do not know what Nature is, or what she can do; and\nnobody knows; not even Sir Roderick Murchison, or Professor Owen,\nor Professor Sedgwick, or Professor Huxley, or Mr. Darwin, or\nProfessor Faraday, or Mr. Grove, or any other of the great men whom\ngood boys are taught to respect.  They are very wise men; and you\nmust listen respectfully to all they say:  but even if they should\nsay, which I am sure they never would, \"That cannot exist.  That is\ncontrary to nature,\" you must wait a little, and see; for perhaps\neven they may be wrong.  It is only children who read Aunt\nAgitate's Arguments, or Cousin Cramchild's Conversations; or lads\nwho go to popular lectures, and see a man pointing at a few big\nugly pictures on the wall, or making nasty smells with bottles and\nsquirts, for an hour or two, and calling that anatomy or chemistry-\n-who talk about \"cannot exist,\" and \"contrary to nature.\"  Wise men\nare afraid to say that there is anything contrary to nature, except\nwhat is contrary to mathematical truth; for two and two cannot make\nfive, and two straight lines cannot join twice, and a part cannot\nbe as great as the whole, and so on (at least, so it seems at\npresent):  but the wiser men are, the less they talk about\n\"cannot.\"  That is a very rash, dangerous word, that \"cannot\"; and\nif people use it too often, the Queen of all the Fairies, who makes\nthe clouds thunder and the fleas bite, and takes just as much\ntrouble about one as about the other, is apt to astonish them\nsuddenly by showing them, that though they say she cannot, yet she\ncan, and what is more, will, whether they approve or not.\n\nAnd therefore it is, that there are dozens and hundreds of things\nin the world which we should certainly have said were contrary to\nnature, if we did not see them going on under our eyes all day\nlong.  If people had never seen little seeds grow into great plants\nand trees, of quite different shape from themselves, and these\ntrees again produce fresh seeds, to grow into fresh trees, they\nwould have said, \"The thing cannot be; it is contrary to nature.\"\nAnd they would have been quite as right in saying so, as in saying\nthat most other things cannot be.\n\nOr suppose again, that you had come, like M. Du Chaillu, a\ntraveller from unknown parts; and that no human being had ever seen\nor heard of an elephant.  And suppose that you described him to\npeople, and said, \"This is the shape, and plan, and anatomy of the\nbeast, and of his feet, and of his trunk, and of his grinders, and\nof his tusks, though they are not tusks at all, but two fore teeth\nrun mad; and this is the section of his skull, more like a mushroom\nthan a reasonable skull of a reasonable or unreasonable beast; and\nso forth, and so forth; and though the beast (which I assure you I\nhave seen and shot) is first cousin to the little hairy coney of\nScripture, second cousin to a pig, and (I suspect) thirteenth or\nfourteenth cousin to a rabbit, yet he is the wisest of all beasts,\nand can do everything save read, write, and cast accounts.\"  People\nwould surely have said, \"Nonsense; your elephant is contrary to\nnature;\" and have thought you were telling stories--as the French\nthought of Le Vaillant when he came back to Paris and said that he\nhad shot a giraffe; and as the king of the Cannibal Islands thought\nof the English sailor, when he said that in his country water\nturned to marble, and rain fell as feathers.  They would tell you,\nthe more they knew of science, \"Your elephant is an impossible\nmonster, contrary to the laws of comparative anatomy, as far as yet\nknown.\"  To which you would answer the less, the more you thought.\n\nDid not learned men, too, hold, till within the last twenty-five\nyears, that a flying dragon was an impossible monster?  And do we\nnot now know that there are hundreds of them found fossil up and\ndown the world?  People call them Pterodactyles:  but that is only\nbecause they are ashamed to call them flying dragons, after denying\nso long that flying dragons could exist.\n\nThe truth is, that folks' fancy that such and such things cannot\nbe, simply because they have not seen them, is worth no more than a\nsavage's fancy that there cannot be such a thing as a locomotive,\nbecause he never saw one running wild in the forest.  Wise men know\nthat their business is to examine what is, and not to settle what\nis not.  They know that there are elephants; they know that there\nhave been flying dragons; and the wiser they are, the less inclined\nthey will be to say positively that there are no water-babies.\n\nNo water-babies, indeed?  Why, wise men of old said that everything\non earth had its double in the water; and you may see that that is,\nif not quite true, still quite as true as most other theories which\nyou are likely to hear for many a day.  There are land-babies--then\nwhy not water-babies?  Are there not water-rats, water-flies,\nwater-crickets, water-crabs, water-tortoises, water-scorpions,\nwater-tigers and water-hogs, water-cats and water-dogs, sea-lions\nand sea-bears, sea-horses and sea-elephants, sea-mice and sea-\nurchins, sea-razors and sea-pens, sea-combs and sea-fans; and of\nplants, are there not water-grass, and water-crowfoot, water-\nmilfoil, and so on, without end?\n\n\"But all these things are only nicknames; the water things are not\nreally akin to the land things.\"\n\nThat's not always true.  They are, in millions of cases, not only\nof the same family, but actually the same individual creatures.  Do\nnot even you know that a green drake, and an alder-fly, and a\ndragon-fly, live under water till they change their skins, just as\nTom changed his?  And if a water animal can continually change into\na land animal, why should not a land animal sometimes change into a\nwater animal?  Don't be put down by any of Cousin Cramchild's\narguments, but stand up to him like a man, and answer him (quite\nrespectfully, of course) thus:-\n\nIf Cousin Cramchild says, that if there are water-babies, they must\ngrow into water-men, ask him how he knows that they do not? and\nthen, how he knows that they must, any more than the Proteus of the\nAdelsberg caverns grows into a perfect newt.\n\nIf he says that it is too strange a transformation for a land-baby\nto turn into a water-baby, ask him if he ever heard of the\ntransformation of Syllis, or the Distomas, or the common jelly-\nfish, of which M. Quatrefages says excellently well--\"Who would not\nexclaim that a miracle had come to pass, if he saw a reptile come\nout of the egg dropped by the hen in his poultry-yard, and the\nreptile give birth at once to an indefinite number of fishes and\nbirds?  Yet the history of the jelly-fish is quite as wonderful as\nthat would be.\"  Ask him if he knows about all this; and if he does\nnot, tell him to go and look for himself; and advise him (very\nrespectfully, of course) to settle no more what strange things\ncannot happen, till he has seen what strange things do happen every\nday.\n\nIf he says that things cannot degrade, that is, change downwards\ninto lower forms, ask him, who told him that water-babies were\nlower than land-babies?  But even if they were, does he know about\nthe strange degradation of the common goose-barnacles, which one\nfinds sticking on ships' bottoms; or the still stranger degradation\nof some cousins of theirs, of which one hardly likes to talk, so\nshocking and ugly it is?\n\nAnd, lastly, if he says (as he most certainly will) that these\ntransformations only take place in the lower animals, and not in\nthe higher, say that that seems to little boys, and to some grown\npeople, a very strange fancy.  For if the changes of the lower\nanimals are so wonderful, and so difficult to discover, why should\nnot there be changes in the higher animals far more wonderful, and\nfar more difficult to discover?  And may not man, the crown and\nflower of all things, undergo some change as much more wonderful\nthan all the rest, as the Great Exhibition is more wonderful than a\nrabbit-burrow?  Let him answer that.  And if he says (as he will)\nthat not having seen such a change in his experience, he is not\nbound to believe it, ask him respectfully, where his microscope has\nbeen?  Does not each of us, in coming into this world, go through a\ntransformation just as wonderful as that of a sea-egg, or a\nbutterfly? and do not reason and analogy, as well as Scripture,\ntell us that that transformation is not the last? and that, though\nwhat we shall be, we know not, yet we are here but as the crawling\ncaterpillar, and shall be hereafter as the perfect fly.  The old\nGreeks, heathens as they were, saw as much as that two thousand\nyears ago; and I care very little for Cousin Cramchild, if he sees\neven less than they.  And so forth, and so forth, till he is quite\ncross.  And then tell him that if there are no water-babies, at\nleast there ought to be; and that, at least, he cannot answer.\n\nAnd meanwhile, my dear little man, till you know a great deal more\nabout nature than Professor Owen and Professor Huxley put together,\ndon't tell me about what cannot be, or fancy that anything is too\nwonderful to be true.  \"We are fearfully and wonderfully made,\"\nsaid old David; and so we are; and so is everything around us, down\nto the very deal table.  Yes; much more fearfully and wonderfully\nmade, already, is the table, as it stands now, nothing but a piece\nof dead deal wood, than if, as foxes say, and geese believe,\nspirits could make it dance, or talk to you by rapping on it.\n\nAm I in earnest?  Oh dear no!  Don't you know that this is a fairy\ntale, and all fun and pretence; and that you are not to believe one\nword of it, even if it is true?\n\nBut at all events, so it happened to Tom.  And, therefore, the\nkeeper, and the groom, and Sir John made a great mistake, and were\nvery unhappy (Sir John at least) without any reason, when they\nfound a black thing in the water, and said it was Tom's body, and\nthat he had been drowned.  They were utterly mistaken.  Tom was\nquite alive; and cleaner, and merrier, than he ever had been.  The\nfairies had washed him, you see, in the swift river, so thoroughly,\nthat not only his dirt, but his whole husk and shell had been\nwashed quite off him, and the pretty little real Tom was washed out\nof the inside of it, and swam away, as a caddis does when its case\nof stones and silk is bored through, and away it goes on its back,\npaddling to the shore, there to split its skin, and fly away as a\ncaperer, on four fawn-coloured wings, with long legs and horns.\nThey are foolish fellows, the caperers, and fly into the candle at\nnight, if you leave the door open.  We will hope Tom will be wiser,\nnow he has got safe out of his sooty old shell.\n\nBut good Sir John did not understand all this, not being a fellow\nof the Linnaean Society; and he took it into his head that Tom was\ndrowned.  When they looked into the empty pockets of his shell, and\nfound no jewels there, nor money--nothing but three marbles, and a\nbrass button with a string to it--then Sir John did something as\nlike crying as ever he did in his life, and blamed himself more\nbitterly than he need have done.  So he cried, and the groom-boy\ncried, and the huntsman cried, and the dame cried, and the little\ngirl cried, and the dairymaid cried, and the old nurse cried (for\nit was somewhat her fault), and my lady cried, for though people\nhave wigs, that is no reason why they should not have hearts; but\nthe keeper did not cry, though he had been so good-natured to Tom\nthe morning before; for he was so dried up with running after\npoachers, that you could no more get tears out of him than milk out\nof leather:  and Grimes did not cry, for Sir John gave him ten\npounds, and he drank it all in a week.  Sir John sent, far and\nwide, to find Tom's father and mother:  but he might have looked\ntill Doomsday for them, for one was dead, and the other was in\nBotany Bay.  And the little girl would not play with her dolls for\na whole week, and never forgot poor little Tom.  And soon my lady\nput a pretty little tombstone over Tom's shell in the little\nchurchyard in Vendale, where the old dalesmen all sleep side by\nside between the lime-stone crags.  And the dame decked it with\ngarlands every Sunday, till she grew so old that she could not stir\nabroad; then the little children decked it, for her.  And always\nshe sang an old old song, as she sat spinning what she called her\nwedding-dress.  The children could not understand it, but they\nliked it none the less for that; for it was very sweet, and very\nsad; and that was enough for them.  And these are the words of it:-\n\n\nWhen all the world is young, lad,\nAnd all the trees are green;\nAnd every goose a swan, lad,\nAnd every lass a queen;\nThen hey for boot and horse, lad,\nAnd round the world away;\nYoung blood must have its course, lad,\nAnd every dog his day.\n\nWhen all the world is old, lad,\nAnd all the trees are brown;\nAnd all the sport is stale, lad,\nAnd all the wheels run down;\nCreep home, and take your place there,\nThe spent and maimed among:\nGod grant you find one face there,\nYou loved when all was young.\n\n\nThose are the words:  but they are only the body of it:  the soul\nof the song was the dear old woman's sweet face, and sweet voice,\nand the sweet old air to which she sang; and that, alas! one cannot\nput on paper.  And at last she grew so stiff and lame, that the\nangels were forced to carry her; and they helped her on with her\nwedding-dress, and carried her up over Harthover Fells, and a long\nway beyond that too; and there was a new schoolmistress in Vendale,\nand we will hope that she was not certificated.\n\nAnd all the while Tom was swimming about in the river, with a\npretty little lace-collar of gills about his neck, as lively as a\ngrig, and as clean as a fresh-run salmon.\n\nNow if you don't like my story, then go to the schoolroom and learn\nyour multiplication-table, and see if you like that better.  Some\npeople, no doubt, would do so.  So much the better for us, if not\nfor them.  It takes all sorts, they say, to make a world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n\n\"He prayeth well who loveth well\nBoth men and bird and beast;\nHe prayeth best who loveth best\nAll things both great and small:\nFor the dear God who loveth us,\nHe made and loveth all.\"\n\nCOLERIDGE.\n\n\nTom was now quite amphibious.  You do not know what that means?\nYou had better, then, ask the nearest Government pupil-teacher, who\nmay possibly answer you smartly enough, thus -\n\n\"Amphibious.  Adjective, derived from two Greek words, amphi, a\nfish, and bios, a beast.  An animal supposed by our ignorant\nancestors to be compounded of a fish and a beast; which therefore,\nlike the hippopotamus, can't live on the land, and dies in the\nwater.\"\n\nHowever that may be, Tom was amphibious:  and what is better still,\nhe was clean.  For the first time in his life, he felt how\ncomfortable it was to have nothing on him but himself.  But he only\nenjoyed it:  he did not know it, or think about it; just as you\nenjoy life and health, and yet never think about being alive and\nhealthy; and may it be long before you have to think about it!\n\nHe did not remember having ever been dirty.  Indeed, he did not\nremember any of his old troubles, being tired, or hungry, or\nbeaten, or sent up dark chimneys.  Since that sweet sleep, he had\nforgotten all about his master, and Harthover Place, and the little\nwhite girl, and in a word, all that had happened to him when he\nlived before; and what was best of all, he had forgotten all the\nbad words which he had learned from Grimes, and the rude boys with\nwhom he used to play.\n\nThat is not strange:  for you know, when you came into this world,\nand became a land-baby, you remembered nothing.  So why should he,\nwhen he became a water-baby?\n\nThen have you lived before?\n\nMy dear child, who can tell?  One can only tell that, by\nremembering something which happened where we lived before; and as\nwe remember nothing, we know nothing about it; and no book, and no\nman, can ever tell us certainly.\n\nThere was a wise man once, a very wise man, and a very good man,\nwho wrote a poem about the feelings which some children have about\nhaving lived before; and this is what he said -\n\n\n\"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;\nThe soul that rises with us, our life's star,\nHath elsewhere had its setting,\nAnd cometh from afar:\nNot in entire forgetfulness,\nAnd not in utter nakedness,\nBut trailing clouds of glory, do we come\nFrom God, who is our home.\"\n\n\nThere, you can know no more than that.  But if I was you, I would\nbelieve that.  For then the great fairy Science, who is likely to\nbe queen of all the fairies for many a year to come, can only do\nyou good, and never do you harm; and instead of fancying with some\npeople, that your body makes your soul, as if a steam-engine could\nmake its own coke; or, with some people, that your soul has nothing\nto do with your body, but is only stuck into it like a pin into a\npincushion, to fall out with the first shake;--you will believe the\none true,\n\northodox,      inductive,\nrational,      deductive,\nphilosophical, seductive,\nlogical,       productive,\nirrefragable,  salutary,\nnominalistic,  comfortable,\nrealistic,\nand on-all-accounts-to-be-received\n\ndoctrine of this wonderful fairy tale; which is, that your soul\nmakes your body, just as a snail makes his shell.  For the rest, it\nis enough for us to be sure that whether or not we lived before, we\nshall live again; though not, I hope, as poor little heathen Tom\ndid.  For he went downward into the water:  but we, I hope, shall\ngo upward to a very different place.\n\nBut Tom was very happy in the water.  He had been sadly overworked\nin the land-world; and so now, to make up for that, he had nothing\nbut holidays in the water-world for a long, long time to come.  He\nhad nothing to do now but enjoy himself, and look at all the pretty\nthings which are to be seen in the cool clear water-world, where\nthe sun is never too hot, and the frost is never too cold.\n\nAnd what did he live on?  Water-cresses, perhaps; or perhaps water-\ngruel, and water-milk; too many land-babies do so likewise.  But we\ndo not know what one-tenth of the water-things eat; so we are not\nanswerable for the water-babies.\n\nSometimes he went along the smooth gravel water-ways, looking at\nthe crickets which ran in and out among the stones, as rabbits do\non land; or he climbed over the ledges of rock, and saw the sand-\npipes hanging in thousands, with every one of them a pretty little\nhead and legs peeping out; or he went into a still corner, and\nwatched the caddises eating dead sticks as greedily as you would\neat plum-pudding, and building their houses with silk and glue.\nVery fanciful ladies they were; none of them would keep to the same\nmaterials for a day.  One would begin with some pebbles; then she\nwould stick on a piece of green wood; then she found a shell, and\nstuck it on too; and the poor shell was alive, and did not like at\nall being taken to build houses with:  but the caddis did not let\nhim have any voice in the matter, being rude and selfish, as vain\npeople are apt to be; then she stuck on a piece of rotten wood,\nthen a very smart pink stone, and so on, till she was patched all\nover like an Irishman's coat.  Then she found a long straw, five\ntimes as long as herself, and said, \"Hurrah! my sister has a tail,\nand I'll have one too;\" and she stuck it on her back, and marched\nabout with it quite proud, though it was very inconvenient indeed.\nAnd, at that, tails became all the fashion among the caddis-baits\nin that pool, as they were at the end of the Long Pond last May,\nand they all toddled about with long straws sticking out behind,\ngetting between each other's legs, and tumbling over each other,\nand looking so ridiculous, that Tom laughed at them till he cried,\nas we did.  But they were quite right, you know; for people must\nalways follow the fashion, even if it be spoon-bonnets.\n\nThen sometimes he came to a deep still reach; and there he saw the\nwater-forests.  They would have looked to you only little weeds:\nbut Tom, you must remember, was so little that everything looked a\nhundred times as big to him as it does to you, just as things do to\na minnow, who sees and catches the little water-creatures which you\ncan only see in a microscope.\n\nAnd in the water-forest he saw the water-monkeys and water-\nsquirrels (they had all six legs, though; everything almost has six\nlegs in the water, except efts and water-babies); and nimbly enough\nthey ran among the branches.  There were water-flowers there too,\nin thousands; and Tom tried to pick them:  but as soon as he\ntouched them, they drew themselves in and turned into knots of\njelly; and then Tom saw that they were all alive--bells, and stars,\nand wheels, and flowers, of all beautiful shapes and colours; and\nall alive and busy, just as Tom was.  So now he found that there\nwas a great deal more in the world than he had fancied at first\nsight.\n\nThere was one wonderful little fellow, too, who peeped out of the\ntop of a house built of round bricks.  He had two big wheels, and\none little one, all over teeth, spinning round and round like the\nwheels in a thrashing-machine; and Tom stood and stared at him, to\nsee what he was going to make with his machinery.  And what do you\nthink he was doing?  Brick-making.  With his two big wheels he\nswept together all the mud which floated in the water:  all that\nwas nice in it he put into his stomach and ate; and all the mud he\nput into the little wheel on his breast, which really was a round\nhole set with teeth; and there he spun it into a neat hard round\nbrick; and then he took it and stuck it on the top of his house-\nwall, and set to work to make another. Now was not he a clever\nlittle fellow?\n\nTom thought so:  but when he wanted to talk to him the brick-maker\nwas much too busy and proud of his work to take notice of him.\n\nNow you must know that all the things under the water talk; only\nnot such a language as ours; but such as horses, and dogs, and\ncows, and birds talk to each other; and Tom soon learned to\nunderstand them and talk to them; so that he might have had very\npleasant company if he had only been a good boy.  But I am sorry to\nsay, he was too like some other little boys, very fond of hunting\nand tormenting creatures for mere sport.  Some people say that boys\ncannot help it; that it is nature, and only a proof that we are all\noriginally descended from beasts of prey.  But whether it is nature\nor not, little boys can help it, and must help it.  For if they\nhave naughty, low, mischievous tricks in their nature, as monkeys\nhave, that is no reason why they should give way to those tricks\nlike monkeys, who know no better.  And therefore they must not\ntorment dumb creatures; for if they do, a certain old lady who is\ncoming will surely give them exactly what they deserve.\n\nBut Tom did not know that; and he pecked and howked the poor water-\nthings about sadly, till they were all afraid of him, and got out\nof his way, or crept into their shells; so he had no one to speak\nto or play with.\n\nThe water-fairies, of course, were very sorry to see him so\nunhappy, and longed to take him, and tell him how naughty he was,\nand teach him to be good, and to play and romp with him too:  but\nthey had been forbidden to do that.  Tom had to learn his lesson\nfor himself by sound and sharp experience, as many another foolish\nperson has to do, though there may be many a kind heart yearning\nover them all the while, and longing to teach them what they can\nonly teach themselves.\n\nAt last one day he found a caddis, and wanted it to peep out of its\nhouse:  but its house-door was shut.  He had never seen a caddis\nwith a house-door before:  so what must he do, the meddlesome\nlittle fellow, but pull it open, to see what the poor lady was\ndoing inside.  What a shame!  How should you like to have any one\nbreaking your bedroom-door in, to see how you looked when you where\nin bed?  So Tom broke to pieces the door, which was the prettiest\nlittle grating of silk, stuck all over with shining bits of\ncrystal; and when he looked in, the caddis poked out her head, and\nit had turned into just the shape of a bird's.  But when Tom spoke\nto her she could not answer; for her mouth and face were tight tied\nup in a new night-cap of neat pink skin.  However, if she didn't\nanswer, all the other caddises did; for they held up their hands\nand shrieked like the cats in Struwelpeter:  \"Oh, you nasty horrid\nboy; there you are at it again!  And she had just laid herself up\nfor a fortnight's sleep, and then she would have come out with such\nbeautiful wings, and flown about, and laid such lots of eggs:  and\nnow you have broken her door, and she can't mend it because her\nmouth is tied up for a fortnight, and she will die.  Who sent you\nhere to worry us out of our lives?\"\n\nSo Tom swam away.  He was very much ashamed of himself, and felt\nall the naughtier; as little boys do when they have done wrong and\nwon't say so.\n\nThen he came to a pool full of little trout, and began tormenting\nthem, and trying to catch them:  but they slipped through his\nfingers, and jumped clean out of water in their fright.  But as Tom\nchased them, he came close to a great dark hover under an alder\nroot, and out floushed a huge old brown trout ten times as big as\nhe was, and ran right against him, and knocked all the breath out\nof his body; and I don't know which was the more frightened of the\ntwo.\n\nThen he went on sulky and lonely, as he deserved to be; and under a\nbank he saw a very ugly dirty creature sitting, about half as big\nas himself; which had six legs, and a big stomach, and a most\nridiculous head with two great eyes and a face just like a\ndonkey's.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Tom, \"you are an ugly fellow to be sure!\" and he began\nmaking faces at him; and put his nose close to him, and halloed at\nhim, like a very rude boy.\n\nWhen, hey presto; all the thing's donkey-face came off in a moment,\nand out popped a long arm with a pair of pincers at the end of it,\nand caught Tom by the nose.  It did not hurt him much; but it held\nhim quite tight.\n\n\"Yah, ah!  Oh, let me go!\" cried Tom.\n\n\"Then let me go,\" said the creature.  \"I want to be quiet.  I want\nto split.\"\n\nTom promised to let him alone, and he let go.\n\n\"Why do you want to split?\" said Tom.\n\n\"Because my brothers and sisters have all split, and turned into\nbeautiful creatures with wings; and I want to split too.  Don't\nspeak to me.  I am sure I shall split.  I will split!\"\n\nTom stood still, and watched him.  And he swelled himself, and\npuffed, and stretched himself out stiff, and at last--crack, puff,\nbang--he opened all down his back, and then up to the top of his\nhead.\n\nAnd out of his inside came the most slender, elegant, soft\ncreature, as soft and smooth as Tom:  but very pale and weak, like\na little child who has been ill a long time in a dark room.  It\nmoved its legs very feebly; and looked about it half ashamed, like\na girl when she goes for the first time into a ballroom; and then\nit began walking slowly up a grass stem to the top of the water.\n\nTom was so astonished that he never said a word but he stared with\nall his eyes.  And he went up to the top of the water too, and\npeeped out to see what would happen.\n\nAnd as the creature sat in the warm bright sun, a wonderful change\ncame over it.  It grew strong and firm; the most lovely colours\nbegan to show on its body, blue and yellow and black, spots and\nbars and rings; out of its back rose four great wings of bright\nbrown gauze; and its eyes grew so large that they filled all its\nhead, and shone like ten thousand diamonds.\n\n\"Oh, you beautiful creature!\" said Tom; and he put out his hand to\ncatch it.\n\nBut the thing whirred up into the air, and hung poised on its wings\na moment, and then settled down again by Tom quite fearless.\n\n\"No!\" it said, \"you cannot catch me.  I am a dragon-fly now, the\nking of all the flies; and I shall dance in the sunshine, and hawk\nover the river, and catch gnats, and have a beautiful wife like\nmyself.  I know what I shall do.  Hurrah!\"  And he flew away into\nthe air, and began catching gnats.\n\n\"Oh! come back, come back,\" cried Tom, \"you beautiful creature.  I\nhave no one to play with, and I am so lonely here.  If you will but\ncome back I will never try to catch you.\"\n\n\"I don't care whether you do or not,\" said the dragon-fly; \"for you\ncan't.  But when I have had my dinner, and looked a little about\nthis pretty place, I will come back, and have a little chat about\nall I have seen in my travels.  Why, what a huge tree this is! and\nwhat huge leaves on it!\"\n\nIt was only a big dock:  but you know the dragon-fly had never seen\nany but little water-trees; starwort, and milfoil, and water-\ncrowfoot, and such like; so it did look very big to him.  Besides,\nhe was very short-sighted, as all dragon-flies are; and never could\nsee a yard before his nose; any more than a great many other folks,\nwho are not half as handsome as he.\n\nThe dragon-fly did come back, and chatted away with Tom.  He was a\nlittle conceited about his fine colours and his large wings; but\nyou know, he had been a poor dirty ugly creature all his life\nbefore; so there were great excuses for him.  He was very fond of\ntalking about all the wonderful things he saw in the trees and the\nmeadows; and Tom liked to listen to him, for he had forgotten all\nabout them.  So in a little while they became great friends.\n\nAnd I am very glad to say, that Tom learned such a lesson that day,\nthat he did not torment creatures for a long time after.  And then\nthe caddises grew quite tame, and used to tell him strange stories\nabout the way they built their houses, and changed their skins, and\nturned at last into winged flies; till Tom began to long to change\nhis skin, and have wings like them some day.\n\nAnd the trout and he made it up (for trout very soon forget if they\nhave been frightened and hurt).  So Tom used to play with them at\nhare and hounds, and great fun they had; and he used to try to leap\nout of the water, head over heels, as they did before a shower came\non; but somehow he never could manage it.  He liked most, though,\nto see them rising at the flies, as they sailed round and round\nunder the shadow of the great oak, where the beetles fell flop into\nthe water, and the green caterpillars let themselves down from the\nboughs by silk ropes for no reason at all; and then changed their\nfoolish minds for no reason at all either; and hauled themselves up\nagain into the tree, rolling up the rope in a ball between their\npaws; which is a very clever rope-dancer's trick, and neither\nBlondin nor Leotard could do it:  but why they should take so much\ntrouble about it no one can tell; for they cannot get their living,\nas Blondin and Leotard do, by trying to break their necks on a\nstring.\n\nAnd very often Tom caught them just as they touched the water; and\ncaught the alder-flies, and the caperers, and the cock-tailed duns\nand spinners, yellow, and brown, and claret, and gray, and gave\nthem to his friends the trout.  Perhaps he was not quite kind to\nthe flies; but one must do a good turn to one's friends when one\ncan.\n\nAnd at last he gave up catching even the flies; for he made\nacquaintance with one by accident and found him a very merry little\nfellow.  And this was the way it happened; and it is all quite\ntrue.\n\nHe was basking at the top of the water one hot day in July,\ncatching duns and feeding the trout, when he saw a new sort, a dark\ngray little fellow with a brown head.  He was a very little fellow\nindeed:  but he made the most of himself, as people ought to do.\nHe cocked up his head, and he cocked up his wings, and he cocked up\nhis tail, and he cocked up the two whisks at his tail-end, and, in\nshort, he looked the cockiest little man of all little men.  And so\nhe proved to be; for instead of getting away, he hopped upon Tom's\nfinger, and sat there as bold as nine tailors; and he cried out in\nthe tiniest, shrillest, squeakiest little voice you ever heard,\n\n\"Much obliged to you, indeed; but I don't want it yet.\"\n\n\"Want what?\" said Tom, quite taken aback by his impudence.\n\n\"Your leg, which you are kind enough to hold out for me to sit on.\nI must just go and see after my wife for a few minutes.  Dear me!\nwhat a troublesome business a family is!\" (though the idle little\nrogue did nothing at all, but left his poor wife to lay all the\neggs by herself).  \"When I come back, I shall be glad of it, if\nyou'll be so good as to keep it sticking out just so;\" and off he\nflew.\n\nTom thought him a very cool sort of personage; and still more so,\nwhen, in five minutes he came back, and said--\"Ah, you were tired\nwaiting?  Well, your other leg will do as well.\"\n\nAnd he popped himself down on Tom's knee, and began chatting away\nin his squeaking voice.\n\n\"So you live under the water?  It's a low place.  I lived there for\nsome time; and was very shabby and dirty.  But I didn't choose that\nthat should last.  So I turned respectable, and came up to the top,\nand put on this gray suit.  It's a very business-like suit, you\nthink, don't you?\"\n\n\"Very neat and quiet indeed,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Yes, one must be quiet and neat and respectable, and all that sort\nof thing for a little, when one becomes a family man.  But I'm\ntired of it, that's the truth.  I've done quite enough business, I\nconsider, in the last week, to last me my life.  So I shall put on\na ball dress, and go out and be a smart man, and see the gay world,\nand have a dance or two.  Why shouldn't one be jolly if one can?\"\n\n\"And what will become of your wife?\"\n\n\"Oh! she is a very plain stupid creature, and that's the truth; and\nthinks about nothing but eggs.  If she chooses to come, why she\nmay; and if not, why I go without her;--and here I go.\"\n\nAnd, as he spoke, he turned quite pale, and then quite white.\n\n\"Why, you're ill!\" said Tom.  But he did not answer.\n\n\"You're dead,\" said Tom, looking at him as he stood on his knee as\nwhite as a ghost.\n\n\"No, I ain't!\" answered a little squeaking voice over his head.\n\"This is me up here, in my ball-dress; and that's my skin.  Ha, ha!\nyou could not do such a trick as that!\"\n\nAnd no more Tom could, nor Houdin, nor Robin, nor Frikell, nor all\nthe conjurors in the world.  For the little rogue had jumped clean\nout of his own skin, and left it standing on Tom's knee, eyes,\nwings, legs, tail, exactly as if it had been alive.\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" he said, and he jerked and skipped up and down, never\nstopping an instant, just as if he had St. Vitus's dance.  \"Ain't I\na pretty fellow now?\"\n\nAnd so he was; for his body was white, and his tail orange, and his\neyes all the colours of a peacock's tail.  And what was the oddest\nof all, the whisks at the end of his tail had grown five times as\nlong as they were before.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"now I will see the gay world.  My living, won't\ncost me much, for I have no mouth, you see, and no inside; so I can\nnever be hungry nor have the stomach-ache neither.\"\n\nNo more he had.  He had grown as dry and hard and empty as a quill,\nas such silly shallow-hearted fellows deserve to grow.\n\nBut, instead of being ashamed of his emptiness, he was quite proud\nof it, as a good many fine gentlemen are, and began flirting and\nflipping up and down, and singing -\n\n\n\"My wife shall dance, and I shall sing,\nSo merrily pass the day;\nFor I hold it for quite the wisest thing,\nTo drive dull care away.\"\n\n\nAnd he danced up and down for three days and three nights, till he\ngrew so tired, that he tumbled into the water, and floated down.\nBut what became of him Tom never knew, and he himself never minded;\nfor Tom heard him singing to the last, as he floated down -\n\n\n\"To drive dull care away-ay-ay!\"\n\n\nAnd if he did not care, why nobody else cared either.\n\nBut one day Tom had a new adventure.  He was sitting on a water-\nlily leaf, he and his friend the dragon-fly, watching the gnats\ndance.  The dragon-fly had eaten as many as he wanted, and was\nsitting quite still and sleepy, for it was very hot and bright.\nThe gnats (who did not care the least for their poor brothers'\ndeath) danced a foot over his head quite happily, and a large black\nfly settled within an inch of his nose, and began washing his own\nface and combing his hair with his paws:  but the dragon-fly never\nstirred, and kept on chatting to Tom about the times when he lived\nunder the water.\n\nSuddenly, Tom heard the strangest noise up the stream; cooing, and\ngrunting, and whining, and squeaking, as if you had put into a bag\ntwo stock-doves, nine mice, three guinea-pigs, and a blind puppy,\nand left them there to settle themselves and make music.\n\nHe looked up the water, and there he saw a sight as strange as the\nnoise; a great ball rolling over and over down the stream, seeming\none moment of soft brown fur, and the next of shining glass:  and\nyet it was not a ball; for sometimes it broke up and streamed away\nin pieces, and then it joined again; and all the while the noise\ncame out of it louder and louder.\n\nTom asked the dragon-fly what it could be:  but, of course, with\nhis short sight, he could not even see it, though it was not ten\nyards away.  So he took the neatest little header into the water,\nand started off to see for himself; and, when he came near, the\nball turned out to be four or five beautiful creatures, many times\nlarger than Tom, who were swimming about, and rolling, and diving,\nand twisting, and wrestling, and cuddling, and kissing and biting,\nand scratching, in the most charming fashion that ever was seen.\nAnd if you don't believe me, you may go to the Zoological Gardens\n(for I am afraid that you won't see it nearer, unless, perhaps, you\nget up at five in the morning, and go down to Cordery's Moor, and\nwatch by the great withy pollard which hangs over the backwater,\nwhere the otters breed sometimes), and then say, if otters at play\nin the water are not the merriest, lithest, gracefullest creatures\nyou ever saw.\n\nBut, when the biggest of them saw Tom, she darted out from the\nrest, and cried in the water-language sharply enough, \"Quick,\nchildren, here is something to eat, indeed!\" and came at poor Tom,\nshowing such a wicked pair of eyes, and such a set of sharp teeth\nin a grinning mouth, that Tom, who had thought her very handsome,\nsaid to himself, Handsome is that handsome does, and slipped in\nbetween the water-lily roots as fast as he could, and then turned\nround and made faces at her.\n\n\"Come out,\" said the wicked old otter, \"or it will be worse for\nyou.\"\n\nBut Tom looked at her from between two thick roots, and shook them\nwith all his might, making horrible faces all the while, just as he\nused to grin through the railings at the old women, when he lived\nbefore.  It was not quite well bred, no doubt; but you know, Tom\nhad not finished his education yet.\n\n\"Come, away, children,\" said the otter in disgust, \"it is not worth\neating, after all.  It is only a nasty eft, which nothing eats, not\neven those vulgar pike in the pond.\"\n\n\"I am not an eft!\" said Tom; \"efts have tails.\"\n\n\"You are an eft,\" said the otter, very positively; \"I see your two\nhands quite plain, and I know you have a tail.\"\n\n\"I tell you I have not,\" said Tom.  \"Look here!\" and he turned his\npretty little self quite round; and, sure enough, he had no more\ntail than you.\n\nThe otter might have got out of it by saying that Tom was a frog:\nbut, like a great many other people, when she had once said a\nthing, she stood to it, right or wrong; so she answered:\n\n\"I say you are an eft, and therefore you are, and not fit food for\ngentlefolk like me and my children.  You may stay there till the\nsalmon eat you (she knew the salmon would not, but she wanted to\nfrighten poor Tom).  Ha! ha! they will eat you, and we will eat\nthem;\" and the otter laughed such a wicked cruel laugh--as you may\nhear them do sometimes; and the first time that you hear it you\nwill probably think it is bogies.\n\n\"What are salmon?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Fish, you eft, great fish, nice fish to eat.  They are the lords\nof the fish, and we are lords of the salmon;\" and she laughed\nagain.  \"We hunt them up and down the pools, and drive them up into\na corner, the silly things; they are so proud, and bully the little\ntrout, and the minnows, till they see us coming, and then they are\nso meek all at once, and we catch them, but we disdain to eat them\nall; we just bite out their soft throats and suck their sweet\njuice--Oh, so good!\"--(and she licked her wicked lips)--\"and then\nthrow them away, and go and catch another.  They are coming soon,\nchildren, coming soon; I can smell the rain coming up off the sea,\nand then hurrah for a fresh, and salmon, and plenty of eating all\nday long.\"\n\nAnd the otter grew so proud that she turned head over heels twice,\nand then stood upright half out of the water, grinning like a\nCheshire cat.\n\n\"And where do they come from?\" asked Tom, who kept himself very\nclose, for he was considerably frightened.\n\n\"Out of the sea, eft, the great wide sea, where they might stay and\nbe safe if they liked.  But out of the sea the silly things come,\ninto the great river down below, and we come up to watch for them;\nand when they go down again we go down and follow them.  And there\nwe fish for the bass and the pollock, and have jolly days along the\nshore, and toss and roll in the breakers, and sleep snug in the\nwarm dry crags.  Ah, that is a merry life too, children, if it were\nnot for those horrid men.\"\n\n\"What are men?\" asked Tom; but somehow he seemed to know before he\nasked.\n\n\"Two-legged things, eft:  and, now I come to look at you, they are\nactually something like you, if you had not a tail\" (she was\ndetermined that Tom should have a tail), \"only a great deal bigger,\nworse luck for us; and they catch the fish with hooks and lines,\nwhich get into our feet sometimes, and set pots along the rocks to\ncatch lobsters.  They speared my poor dear husband as he went out\nto find something for me to eat.  I was laid up among the crags\nthen, and we were very low in the world, for the sea was so rough\nthat no fish would come in shore.  But they speared him, poor\nfellow, and I saw them carrying him away upon a pole.  All, he lost\nhis life for your sakes, my children, poor dear obedient creature\nthat he was.\"\n\nAnd the otter grew so sentimental (for otters can be very\nsentimental when they choose, like a good many people who are both\ncruel and greedy, and no good to anybody at all) that she sailed\nsolemnly away down the burn, and Tom saw her no more for that time.\nAnd lucky it was for her that she did so; for no sooner was she\ngone, than down the bank came seven little rough terrier doors,\nsnuffing and yapping, and grubbing and splashing, in full cry after\nthe otter.  Tom hid among the water-lilies till they were gone; for\nhe could not guess that they were the water-fairies come to help\nhim.\n\nBut he could not help thinking of what the otter had said about the\ngreat river and the broad sea.  And, as he thought, he longed to go\nand see them.  He could not tell why; but the more he thought, the\nmore he grew discontented with the narrow little stream in which he\nlived, and all his companions there; and wanted to get out into the\nwide wide world, and enjoy all the wonderful sights of which he was\nsure it was full.\n\nAnd once he set off to go down the stream.  But the stream was very\nlow; and when he came to the shallows he could not keep under\nwater, for there was no water left to keep under.  So the sun\nburned his back and made him sick; and he went back again and lay\nquiet in the pool for a whole week more.\n\nAnd then, on the evening of a very hot day, he saw a sight.\n\nHe had been very stupid all day, and so had the trout; for they\nwould not move an inch to take a fly, though there were thousands\non the water, but lay dozing at the bottom under the shade of the\nstones; and Tom lay dozing too, and was glad to cuddle their smooth\ncool sides, for the water was quite warm and unpleasant.\n\nBut toward evening it grew suddenly dark, and Tom looked up and saw\na blanket of black clouds lying right across the valley above his\nhead, resting on the crags right and left.  He felt not quite\nfrightened, but very still; for everything was still.  There was\nnot a whisper of wind, nor a chirp of a bird to be heard; and next\na few great drops of rain fell plop into the water, and one hit Tom\non the nose, and made him pop his head down quickly enough.\n\nAnd then the thunder roared, and the lightning flashed, and leapt\nacross Vendale and back again, from cloud to cloud, and cliff to\ncliff, till the very rocks in the stream seemed to shake:  and Tom\nlooked up at it through the water, and thought it the finest thing\nhe ever saw in his life.\n\nBut out of the water he dared not put his head; for the rain came\ndown by bucketsful, and the hail hammered like shot on the stream,\nand churned it into foam; and soon the stream rose, and rushed\ndown, higher and higher, and fouler and fouler, full of beetles,\nand sticks; and straws, and worms, and addle-eggs, and wood-lice,\nand leeches, and odds and ends, and omnium-gatherums, and this,\nthat, and the other, enough to fill nine museums.\n\nTom could hardly stand against the stream, and hid behind a rock.\nBut the trout did not; for out they rushed from among the stones,\nand began gobbling the beetles and leeches in the most greedy and\nquarrelsome way, and swimming about with great worms hanging out of\ntheir mouths, tugging and kicking to get them away from each other.\n\nAnd now, by the flashes of the lightning, Tom saw a new sight--all\nthe bottom of the stream alive with great eels, turning and\ntwisting along, all down stream and away.  They had been hiding for\nweeks past in the cracks of the rocks, and in burrows in the mud;\nand Tom had hardly ever seen them, except now and then at night:\nbut now they were all out, and went hurrying past him so fiercely\nand wildly that he was quite frightened.  And as they hurried past\nhe could hear them say to each other, \"We must run, we must run.\nWhat a jolly thunderstorm!  Down to the sea, down to the sea!\"\n\nAnd then the otter came by with all her brood, twining and sweeping\nalong as fast as the eels themselves; and she spied Tom as she came\nby, and said \"Now is your time, eft, if you want to see the world.\nCome along, children, never mind those nasty eels:  we shall\nbreakfast on salmon to-morrow.  Down to the sea, down to the sea!\"\n\nThen came a flash brighter than all the rest, and by the light of\nit--in the thousandth part of a second they were gone again--but he\nhad seen them, he was certain of it--Three beautiful little white\ngirls, with their arms twined round each other's necks, floating\ndown the torrent, as they sang, \"Down to the sea, down to the sea!\"\n\n\"Oh stay!  Wait for me!\" cried Tom; but they were gone:  yet he\ncould hear their voices clear and sweet through the roar of thunder\nand water and wind, singing as they died away, \"Down to the sea!\"\n\n\"Down to the sea?\" said Tom; \"everything is going to the sea, and I\nwill go too.  Good-bye, trout.\"  But the trout were so busy\ngobbling worms that they never turned to answer him; so that Tom\nwas spared the pain of bidding them farewell.\n\nAnd now, down the rushing stream, guided by the bright flashes of\nthe storm; past tall birch-fringed rocks, which shone out one\nmoment as clear as day, and the next were dark as night; past dark\nhovers under swirling banks, from which great trout rushed out on\nTom, thinking him to be good to eat, and turned back sulkily, for\nthe fairies sent them home again with a tremendous scolding, for\ndaring to meddle with a water-baby; on through narrow strids and\nroaring cataracts, where Tom was deafened and blinded for a moment\nby the rushing waters; along deep reaches, where the white water-\nlilies tossed and flapped beneath the wind and hail; past sleeping\nvillages; under dark bridge-arches, and away and away to the sea.\nAnd Tom could not stop, and did not care to stop; he would see the\ngreat world below, and the salmon, and the breakers, and the wide\nwide sea.\n\nAnd when the daylight came, Tom found himself out in the salmon\nriver.\n\nAnd what sort of a river was it?  Was it like an Irish stream,\nwinding through the brown bogs, where the wild ducks squatter up\nfrom among the white water-lilies, and the curlews flit to and fro,\ncrying \"Tullie-wheep, mind your sheep;\" and Dennis tells you\nstrange stories of the Peishtamore, the great bogy-snake which lies\nin the black peat pools, among the old pine-stems, and puts his\nhead out at night to snap at the cattle as they come down to\ndrink?--But you must not believe all that Dennis tells you, mind;\nfor if you ask him:\n\n\"Is there a salmon here, do you think, Dennis?\"\n\n\"Is it salmon, thin, your honour manes?  Salmon?  Cartloads it is\nof thim, thin, an' ridgmens, shouldthering ache out of water, av'\nye'd but the luck to see thim.\"\n\nThen you fish the pool all over, and never get a rise.\n\n\"But there can't be a salmon here, Dennis! and, if you'll but\nthink, if one had come up last tide, he'd be gone to the higher\npools by now.\"\n\n\"Shure thin, and your honour's the thrue fisherman, and understands\nit all like a book.  Why, ye spake as if ye'd known the wather a\nthousand years!  As I said, how could there be a fish here at all,\njust now?\"\n\n\"But you said just now they were shouldering each other out of\nwater?\"\n\nAnd then Dennis will look up at you with his handsome, sly, soft,\nsleepy, good-natured, untrustable, Irish gray eye, and answer with\nthe prettiest smile:\n\n\"Shure, and didn't I think your honour would like a pleasant\nanswer?\"\n\nSo you must not trust Dennis, because he is in the habit of giving\npleasant answers:  but, instead of being angry with him, you must\nremember that he is a poor Paddy, and knows no better; so you must\njust burst out laughing; and then he will burst out laughing too,\nand slave for you, and trot about after you, and show you good\nsport if he can--for he is an affectionate fellow, and as fond of\nsport as you are--and if he can't, tell you fibs instead, a hundred\nan hour; and wonder all the while why poor ould Ireland does not\nprosper like England and Scotland, and some other places, where\nfolk have taken up a ridiculous fancy that honesty is the best\npolicy.\n\nOr was it like a Welsh salmon river, which is remarkable chiefly\n(at least, till this last year) for containing no salmon, as they\nhave been all poached out by the enlightened peasantry, to prevent\nthe Cythrawl Sassenach (which means you, my little dear, your kith\nand kin, and signifies much the same as the Chinese Fan Quei) from\ncoming bothering into Wales, with good tackle, and ready money, and\ncivilisation, and common honesty, and other like things of which\nthe Cymry stand in no need whatsoever?\n\nOr was it such a salmon stream as I trust you will see among the\nHampshire water-meadows before your hairs are gray, under the wise\nnew fishing-laws?--when Winchester apprentices shall covenant, as\nthey did three hundred years ago, not to be made to eat salmon more\nthan three days a week; and fresh-run fish shall be as plentiful\nunder Salisbury spire as they are in Holly-hole at Christchurch; in\nthe good time coming, when folks shall see that, of all Heaven's\ngifts of food, the one to be protected most carefully is that\nworthy gentleman salmon, who is generous enough to go down to the\nsea weighing five ounces, and to come back next year weighing five\npounds, without having cost the soil or the state one farthing?\n\nOr was it like a Scotch stream, such as Arthur Clough drew in his\n\"Bothie\":-\n\n\n\"Where over a ledge of granite\nInto a granite bason the amber torrent descended. . . . .\nBeautiful there for the colour derived from green rocks under;\nBeautiful most of all, where beads of foam uprising\nMingle their clouds of white with the delicate hue of the\nstillness. . . .\nCliff over cliff for its sides, with rowan and pendant birch\nboughs.\" . . .\n\n\nAh, my little man, when you are a big man, and fish such a stream\nas that, you will hardly care, I think, whether she be roaring down\nin full spate, like coffee covered with scald cream, while the fish\nare swirling at your fly as an oar-blade swirls in a boat-race, or\nflashing up the cataract like silver arrows, out of the fiercest of\nthe foam; or whether the fall be dwindled to a single thread, and\nthe shingle below be as white and dusty as a turnpike road, while\nthe salmon huddle together in one dark cloud in the clear amber\npool, sleeping away their time till the rain creeps back again off\nthe sea.  You will not care much, if you have eyes and brains; for\nyou will lay down your rod contentedly, and drink in at your eyes\nthe beauty of that glorious place; and listen to the water-ouzel\npiping on the stones, and watch the yellow roes come down to drink\nand look up at you with their great soft trustful eyes, as much as\nto say, \"You could not have the heart to shoot at us?\"  And then,\nif you have sense, you will turn and talk to the great giant of a\ngilly who lies basking on the stone beside you.  He will tell you\nno fibs, my little man; for he is a Scotchman, and fears God, and\nnot the priest; and, as you talk with him, you will be surprised\nmore and more at his knowledge, his sense, his humour, his\ncourtesy; and you will find out--unless you have found it out\nbefore--that a man may learn from his Bible to be a more thorough\ngentleman than if he had been brought up in all the drawing-rooms\nin London.\n\nNo.  It was none of these, the salmon stream at Harthover.  It was\nsuch a stream as you see in dear old Bewick; Bewick, who was born\nand bred upon them.  A full hundred yards broad it was, sliding on\nfrom broad pool to broad shallow, and broad shallow to broad pool,\nover great fields of shingle, under oak and ash coverts, past low\ncliffs of sandstone, past green meadows, and fair parks, and a\ngreat house of gray stone, and brown moors above, and here and\nthere against the sky the smoking chimney of a colliery.  You must\nlook at Bewick to see just what it was like, for he has drawn it a\nhundred times with the care and the love of a true north\ncountryman; and, even if you do not care about the salmon river,\nyou ought, like all good boys, to know your Bewick.\n\nAt least, so old Sir John used to say, and very sensibly he put it\ntoo, as he was wont to do:\n\n\"If they want to describe a finished young gentleman in France, I\nhear, they say of him, 'Il sait son Rabelais.'  But if I want to\ndescribe one in England, I say, 'He knows his Bewick.'  And I think\nthat is the higher compliment.\"\n\nBut Tom thought nothing about what the river was like.  All his\nfancy was, to get down to the wide wide sea.\n\nAnd after a while he came to a place where the river spread out\ninto broad still shallow reaches, so wide that little Tom, as he\nput his head out of the water, could hardly see across.\n\nAnd there he stopped.  He got a little frightened.  \"This must be\nthe sea,\" he thought.  \"What a wide place it is!  If I go on into\nit I shall surely lose my way, or some strange thing will bite me.\nI will stop here and look out for the otter, or the eels, or some\none to tell me where I shall go.\"\n\nSo he went back a little way, and crept into a crack of the rock,\njust where the river opened out into the wide shallows, and watched\nfor some one to tell him his way:  but the otter and the eels were\ngone on miles and miles down the stream.\n\nThere he waited, and slept too, for he was quite tired with his\nnight's journey; and, when he woke, the stream was clearing to a\nbeautiful amber hue, though it was still very high.  And after a\nwhile he saw a sight which made him jump up; for he knew in a\nmoment it was one of the things which he had come to look for.\n\nSuch a fish! ten times as big as the biggest trout, and a hundred\ntimes as big as Tom, sculling up the stream past him, as easily as\nTom had sculled down.\n\nSuch a fish! shining silver from head to tail, and here and there a\ncrimson dot; with a grand hooked nose and grand curling lip, and a\ngrand bright eye, looking round him as proudly as a king, and\nsurveying the water right and left as if all belonged to him.\nSurely he must be the salmon, the king of all the fish.\n\nTom was so frightened that he longed to creep into a hole; but he\nneed not have been; for salmon are all true gentlemen, and, like\ntrue gentlemen, they look noble and proud enough, and yet, like\ntrue gentlemen, they never harm or quarrel with any one, but go\nabout their own business, and leave rude fellows to themselves.\n\nThe salmon looked at him full in the face, and then went on without\nminding him, with a swish or two of his tail which made the stream\nboil again. And in a few minutes came another, and then four or\nfive, and so on; and all passed Tom, rushing and plunging up the\ncataract with strong strokes of their silver tails, now and then\nleaping clean out of water and up over a rock, shining gloriously\nfor a moment in the bright sun; while Tom was so delighted that he\ncould have watched them all day long.\n\nAnd at last one came up bigger than all the rest; but he came\nslowly, and stopped, and looked back, and seemed very anxious and\nbusy.  And Tom saw that he was helping another salmon, an\nespecially handsome one, who had not a single spot upon it, but was\nclothed in pure silver from nose to tail.\n\n\"My dear,\" said the great fish to his companion, \"you really look\ndreadfully tired, and you must not over-exert yourself at first.\nDo rest yourself behind this rock;\" and he shoved her gently with\nhis nose, to the rock where Tom sat.\n\nYou must know that this was the salmon's wife.  For salmon, like\nother true gentlemen, always choose their lady, and love her, and\nare true to her, and take care of her and work for her, and fight\nfor her, as every true gentleman ought; and are not like vulgar\nchub and roach and pike, who have no high feelings, and take no\ncare of their wives.\n\nThen he saw Tom, and looked at him very fiercely one moment, as if\nhe was going to bite him.\n\n\"What do you want here?\" he said, very fiercely.\n\n\"Oh, don't hurt me!\" cried Tom.  \"I only want to look at you; you\nare so handsome.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" said the salmon, very stately but very civilly.  \"I really\nbeg your pardon; I see what you are, my little dear.  I have met\none or two creatures like you before, and found them very agreeable\nand well-behaved.  Indeed, one of them showed me a great kindness\nlately, which I hope to be able to repay.  I hope we shall not be\nin your way here.  As soon as this lady is rested, we shall proceed\non our journey.\"\n\nWhat a well-bred old salmon he was!\n\n\"So you have seen things like me before?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Several times, my dear.  Indeed, it was only last night that one\nat the river's mouth came and warned me and my wife of some new\nstake-nets which had got into the stream, I cannot tell how, since\nlast winter, and showed us the way round them, in the most\ncharmingly obliging way.\"\n\n\"So there are babies in the sea?\" cried Tom, and clapped his little\nhands.  \"Then I shall have some one to play with there?  How\ndelightful!\"\n\n\"Were there no babies up this stream?\" asked the lady salmon.\n\n\"No! and I grew so lonely.  I thought I saw three last night; but\nthey were gone in an instant, down to the sea.  So I went too; for\nI had nothing to play with but caddises and dragon-flies and\ntrout.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" cried the lady, \"what low company!\"\n\n\"My dear, if he has been in low company, he has certainly not\nlearnt their low manners,\" said the salmon.\n\n\"No, indeed, poor little dear:  but how sad for him to live among\nsuch people as caddises, who have actually six legs, the nasty\nthings; and dragon-flies, too! why they are not even good to eat;\nfor I tried them once, and they are all hard and empty; and, as for\ntrout, every one knows what they are.\"  Whereon she curled up her\nlip, and looked dreadfully scornful, while her husband curled up\nhis too, till he looked as proud as Alcibiades.\n\n\"Why do you dislike the trout so?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"My dear, we do not even mention them, if we can help it; for I am\nsorry to say they are relations of ours who do us no credit.  A\ngreat many years ago they were just like us:  but they were so\nlazy, and cowardly, and greedy, that instead of going down to the\nsea every year to see the world and grow strong and fat, they chose\nto stay and poke about in the little streams and eat worms and\ngrubs; and they are very properly punished for it; for they have\ngrown ugly and brown and spotted and small; and are actually so\ndegraded in their tastes, that they will eat our children.\"\n\n\"And then they pretend to scrape acquaintance with us again,\" said\nthe lady.  \"Why, I have actually known one of them propose to a\nlady salmon, the little impudent little creature.\"\n\n\"I should hope,\" said the gentleman, \"that there are very few\nladies of our race who would degrade themselves by listening to\nsuch a creature for an instant.  If I saw such a thing happen, I\nshould consider it my duty to put them both to death upon the\nspot.\"  So the old salmon said, like an old blue-blooded hidalgo of\nSpain; and what is more, he would have done it too.  For you must\nknow, no enemies are so bitter against each other as those who are\nof the same race; and a salmon looks on a trout, as some great\nfolks look on some little folks, as something just too much like\nhimself to be tolerated.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n\n\"Sweet is the lore which Nature brings;\nOur meddling intellect\nMis-shapes the beauteous forms of things\nWe murder to dissect.\n\nEnough of science and of art:\nClose up these barren leaves;\nCome forth, and bring with you a heart\nThat watches and receives.\"\n\nWORDSWORTH.\n\n\nSo the salmon went up, after Tom had warned them of the wicked old\notter; and Tom went down, but slowly and cautiously, coasting along\nshore.  He was many days about it, for it was many miles down to\nthe sea; and perhaps he would never have found his way, if the\nfairies had not guided him, without his seeing their fair faces, or\nfeeling their gentle hands.\n\nAnd, as he went, he had a very strange adventure.  It was a clear\nstill September night, and the moon shone so brightly down through\nthe water, that he could not sleep, though he shut his eyes as\ntight as possible.  So at last he came up to the top, and sat upon\na little point of rock, and looked up at the broad yellow moon, and\nwondered what she was, and thought that she looked at him.  And he\nwatched the moonlight on the rippling river, and the black heads of\nthe firs, and the silver-frosted lawns, and listened to the owl's\nhoot, and the snipe's bleat, and the fox's bark, and the otter's\nlaugh; and smelt the soft perfume of the birches, and the wafts of\nheather honey off the grouse moor far above; and felt very happy,\nthough he could not well tell why.  You, of course, would have been\nvery cold sitting there on a September night, without the least bit\nof clothes on your wet back; but Tom was a water-baby, and\ntherefore felt cold no more than a fish.\n\nSuddenly, he saw a beautiful sight.  A bright red light moved along\nthe river-side, and threw down into the water a long tap-root of\nflame.  Tom, curious little rogue that he was, must needs go and\nsee what it was; so he swam to the shore, and met the light as it\nstopped over a shallow run at the edge of a low rock.\n\nAnd there, underneath the light, lay five or six great salmon,\nlooking up at the flame with their great goggle eyes, and wagging\ntheir tails, as if they were very much pleased at it.\n\nTom came to the top, to look at this wonderful light nearer, and\nmade a splash.\n\nAnd he heard a voice say:\n\n\"There was a fish rose.\"\n\nHe did not know what the words meant:  but he seemed to know the\nsound of them, and to know the voice which spoke them; and he saw\non the bank three great two-legged creatures, one of whom held the\nlight, flaring and sputtering, and another a long pole.  And he\nknew that they were men, and was frightened, and crept into a hole\nin the rock, from which he could see what went on.\n\nThe man with the torch bent down over the water, and looked\nearnestly in; and then he said:\n\n\"Tak' that muckle fellow, lad; he's ower fifteen punds; and haud\nyour hand steady.\"\n\nTom felt that there was some danger coming, and longed to warn the\nfoolish salmon, who kept staring up at the light as if he was\nbewitched.  But before he could make up his mind, down came the\npole through the water; there was a fearful splash and struggle,\nand Tom saw that the poor salmon was speared right through, and was\nlifted out of the water.\n\nAnd then, from behind, there sprang on these three men three other\nmen; and there were shouts, and blows, and words which Tom\nrecollected to have heard before; and he shuddered and turned sick\nat them now, for he felt somehow that they were strange, and ugly,\nand wrong, and horrible.  And it all began to come back to him.\nThey were men; and they were fighting; savage, desperate, up-and-\ndown fighting, such as Tom had seen too many times before.\n\nAnd he stopped his little ears, and longed to swim away; and was\nvery glad that he was a water-baby, and had nothing to do any more\nwith horrid dirty men, with foul clothes on their backs, and foul\nwords on their lips; but he dared not stir out of his hole:  while\nthe rock shook over his head with the trampling and struggling of\nthe keepers and the poachers.\n\nAll of a sudden there was a tremendous splash, and a frightful\nflash, and a hissing, and all was still.\n\nFor into the water, close to Tom, fell one of the men; he who held\nthe light in his hand.  Into the swift river he sank, and rolled\nover and over in the current.  Tom heard the men above run along\nseemingly looking for him; but he drifted down into the deep hole\nbelow, and there lay quite still, and they could not find him.\n\nTom waited a long time, till all was quiet; and then he peeped out,\nand saw the man lying.  At last he screwed up his courage and swam\ndown to him.  \"Perhaps,\" he thought, \"the water has made him fall\nasleep, as it did me.\"\n\nThen he went nearer.  He grew more and more curious, he could not\ntell why.  He must go and look at him.  He would go very quietly,\nof course; so he swam round and round him, closer and closer; and,\nas he did not stir, at last he came quite close and looked him in\nthe face.\n\nThe moon shone so bright that Tom could see every feature; and, as\nhe saw, he recollected, bit by bit, it was his old master, Grimes.\n\nTom turned tail, and swam away as fast as he could.\n\n\"Oh dear me!\" he thought, \"now he will turn into a water-baby.\nWhat a nasty troublesome one he will be!  And perhaps he will find\nme out, and beat me again.\"\n\nSo he went up the river again a little way, and lay there the rest\nof the night under an alder root; but, when morning came, he longed\nto go down again to the big pool, and see whether Mr. Grimes had\nturned into a water-baby yet.\n\nSo he went very carefully, peeping round all the rocks, and hiding\nunder all the roots.  Mr. Grimes lay there still; he had not turned\ninto a water-baby.  In the afternoon Tom went back again.  He could\nnot rest till he had found out what had become of Mr. Grimes.  But\nthis time Mr. Grimes was gone; and Tom made up his mind that he was\nturned into a water-baby.\n\nHe might have made himself easy, poor little man; Mr. Grimes did\nnot turn into a water-baby, or anything like one at all.  But he\ndid not make himself easy; and a long time he was fearful lest he\nshould meet Grimes suddenly in some deep pool.  He could not know\nthat the fairies had carried him away, and put him, where they put\neverything which falls into the water, exactly where it ought to\nbe.  But, do you know, what had happened to Mr. Grimes had such an\neffect on him that he never poached salmon any more.  And it is\nquite certain that, when a man becomes a confirmed poacher, the\nonly way to cure him is to put him under water for twenty-four\nhours, like Grimes.  So when you grow to be a big man, do you\nbehave as all honest fellows should; and never touch a fish or a\nhead of game which belongs to another man without his express\nleave; and then people will call you a gentleman, and treat you\nlike one; and perhaps give you good sport:  instead of hitting you\ninto the river, or calling you a poaching snob.\n\nThen Tom went on down, for he was afraid of staying near Grimes:\nand as he went, all the vale looked sad.  The red and yellow leaves\nshowered down into the river; the flies and beetles were all dead\nand gone; the chill autumn fog lay low upon the hills, and\nsometimes spread itself so thickly on the river that he could not\nsee his way.  But he felt his way instead, following the flow of\nthe stream, day after day, past great bridges, past boats and\nbarges, past the great town, with its wharfs, and mills, and tall\nsmoking chimneys, and ships which rode at anchor in the stream; and\nnow and then he ran against their hawsers, and wondered what they\nwere, and peeped out, and saw the sailors lounging on board smoking\ntheir pipes; and ducked under again, for he was terribly afraid of\nbeing caught by man and turned into a chimney-sweep once more.  He\ndid not know that the fairies were close to him always, shutting\nthe sailors' eyes lest they should see him, and turning him aside\nfrom millraces, and sewer-mouths, and all foul and dangerous\nthings.  Poor little fellow, it was a dreary journey for him; and\nmore than once he longed to be back in Vendale, playing with the\ntrout in the bright summer sun.  But it could not be.  What has\nbeen once can never come over again.  And people can be little\nbabies, even water-babies, only once in their lives.\n\nBesides, people who make up their minds to go and see the world, as\nTom did, must needs find it a weary journey.  Lucky for them if\nthey do not lose heart and stop half-way, instead of going on\nbravely to the end as Tom did.  For then they will remain neither\nboys nor men, neither fish, flesh, nor good red-herring:  having\nlearnt a great deal too much, and yet not enough; and sown their\nwild oats, without having the advantage of reaping them.\n\nBut Tom was always a brave, determined, little English bull-dog,\nwho never knew when he was beaten; and on and on he held, till he\nsaw a long way off the red buoy through the fog.  And then he found\nto his surprise, the stream turned round, and running up inland.\n\nIt was the tide, of course:  but Tom knew nothing of the tide.  He\nonly knew that in a minute more the water, which had been fresh,\nturned salt all round him.  And then there came a change over him.\nHe felt as strong, and light, and fresh, as if his veins had run\nchampagne; and gave, he did not know why, three skips out of the\nwater, a yard high, and head over heels, just as the salmon do when\nthey first touch the noble rich salt water, which, as some wise men\ntell us, is the mother of all living things.\n\nHe did not care now for the tide being against him.  The red buoy\nwas in sight, dancing in the open sea; and to the buoy he would go,\nand to it he went.  He passed great shoals of bass and mullet,\nleaping and rushing in after the shrimps, but he never heeded them,\nor they him; and once he passed a great black shining seal, who was\ncoming in after the mullet.  The seal put his head and shoulders\nout of water, and stared at him, looking exactly like a fat old\ngreasy negro with a gray pate.  And Tom, instead of being\nfrightened, said, \"How d'ye do, sir; what a beautiful place the sea\nis!\"  And the old seal, instead of trying to bite him, looked at\nhim with his soft sleepy winking eyes, and said, \"Good tide to you,\nmy little man; are you looking for your brothers and sisters?  I\npassed them all at play outside.\"\n\n\"Oh, then,\" said Tom, \"I shall have playfellows at last,\" and he\nswam on to the buoy, and got upon it (for he was quite out of\nbreath) and sat there, and looked round for water-babies:  but\nthere were none to be seen.\n\nThe sea-breeze came in freshly with the tide and blew the fog away;\nand the little waves danced for joy around the buoy, and the old\nbuoy danced with them.  The shadows of the clouds ran races over\nthe bright blue bay, and yet never caught each other up; and the\nbreakers plunged merrily upon the wide white sands, and jumped up\nover the rocks, to see what the green fields inside were like, and\ntumbled down and broke themselves all to pieces, and never minded\nit a bit, but mended themselves and jumped up again.  And the terns\nhovered over Tom like huge white dragon-flies with black heads, and\nthe gulls laughed like girls at play, and the sea-pies, with their\nred bills and legs, flew to and fro from shore to shore, and\nwhistled sweet and wild.  And Tom looked and looked, and listened;\nand he would have been very happy, if he could only have seen the\nwater-babies.  Then when the tide turned, he left the buoy, and\nswam round and round in search of them:  but in vain.  Sometimes he\nthought he heard them laughing:  but it was only the laughter of\nthe ripples.  And sometimes he thought he saw them at the bottom:\nbut it was only white and pink shells.  And once he was sure he had\nfound one, for he saw two bright eyes peeping out of the sand.  So\nhe dived down, and began scraping the sand away, and cried, \"Don't\nhide; I do want some one to play with so much!\"  And out jumped a\ngreat turbot with his ugly eyes and mouth all awry, and flopped\naway along the bottom, knocking poor Tom over.  And he sat down at\nthe bottom of the sea, and cried salt tears from sheer\ndisappointment.\n\nTo have come all this way, and faced so many dangers, and yet to\nfind no water-babies!  How hard!  Well, it did seem hard:  but\npeople, even little babies, cannot have all they want without\nwaiting for it, and working for it too, my little man, as you will\nfind out some day.\n\nAnd Tom sat upon the buoy long days, long weeks, looking out to\nsea, and wondering when the water-babies would come back; and yet\nthey never came.\n\nThen he began to ask all the strange things which came in out of\nthe sea if they had seen any; and some said \"Yes,\" and some said\nnothing at all.\n\nHe asked the bass and the pollock; but they were so greedy after\nthe shrimps that they did not care to answer him a word.\n\nThen there came in a whole fleet of purple sea-snails, floating\nalong, each on a sponge full of foam, and Tom said, \"Where do you\ncome from, you pretty creatures? and have you seen the water-\nbabies?\"\n\nAnd the sea-snails answered, \"Whence we come we know not; and\nwhither we are going, who can tell?  We float out our life in the\nmid-ocean, with the warm sunshine above our heads, and the warm\ngulf-stream below; and that is enough for us.  Yes; perhaps we have\nseen the water-babies.  We have seen many strange things as we\nsailed along.\"  And they floated away, the happy stupid things, and\nall went ashore upon the sands.\n\nThen there came in a great lazy sunfish, as big as a fat pig cut in\nhalf; and he seemed to have been cut in half too, and squeezed in a\nclothes-press till he was flat; but to all his big body and big\nfins he had only a little rabbit's mouth, no bigger than Tom's;\nand, when Tom questioned him, he answered in a little squeaky\nfeeble voice:\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know; I've lost my way.  I meant to go to the\nChesapeake, and I'm afraid I've got wrong somehow.  Dear me! it was\nall by following that pleasant warm water.  I'm sure I've lost my\nway.\"\n\nAnd, when Tom asked him again, he could only answer, \"I've lost my\nway.  Don't talk to me; I want to think.\"\n\nBut, like a good many other people, the more he tried to think the\nless he could think; and Tom saw him blundering about all day, till\nthe coast-guardsmen saw his big fin above the water, and rowed out,\nand struck a boat-hook into him, and took him away.  They took him\nup to the town and showed him for a penny a head, and made a good\nday's work of it.  But of course Tom did not know that.\n\nThen there came by a shoal of porpoises, rolling as they went--\npapas, and mammas, and little children--and all quite smooth and\nshiny, because the fairies French-polish them every morning; and\nthey sighed so softly as they came by, that Tom took courage to\nspeak to them:  but all they answered was, \"Hush, hush, hush;\" for\nthat was all they had learnt to say.\n\nAnd then there came a shoal of basking sharks' some of them as long\nas a boat, and Tom was frightened at them.  But they were very lazy\ngood-natured fellows, not greedy tyrants, like white sharks and\nblue sharks and ground sharks and hammer-heads, who eat men, or\nsaw-fish and threshers and ice-sharks, who hunt the poor old\nwhales.  They came and rubbed their great sides against the buoy,\nand lay basking in the sun with their backfins out of water; and\nwinked at Tom:  but he never could get them to speak.  They had\neaten so many herrings that they were quite stupid; and Tom was\nglad when a collier brig came by and frightened them all away; for\nthey did smell most horribly, certainly, and he had to hold his\nnose tight as long as they were there.\n\nAnd then there came by a beautiful creature, like a ribbon of pure\nsilver with a sharp head and very long teeth; but it seemed very\nsick and sad.  Sometimes it rolled helpless on its side; and then\nit dashed away glittering like white fire; and then it lay sick\nagain and motionless.\n\n\"Where do you come from?\" asked Tom.  \"And why are YOU so sick and\nsad?\"\n\n\"I come from the warm Carolinas, and the sandbanks fringed with\npines; where the great owl-rays leap and flap, like giant bats,\nupon the tide.  But I wandered north and north, upon the\ntreacherous warm gulf-stream, till I met with the cold icebergs,\nafloat in the mid ocean.  So I got tangled among the icebergs, and\nchilled with their frozen breath.  But the water-babies helped me\nfrom among them, and set me free again.  And now I am mending every\nday; but I am very sick and sad; and perhaps I shall never get home\nagain to play with the owl-rays any more.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Tom.  \"And you have seen water-babies?  Have you seen\nany near here?\"\n\n\"Yes; they helped me again last night, or I should have been eaten\nby a great black porpoise.\"\n\nHow vexatious!  The water-babies close to him, and yet he could not\nfind one.\n\nAnd then he left the buoy, and used to go along the sands and round\nthe rocks, and come out in the night--like the forsaken Merman in\nMr. Arnold's beautiful, beautiful poem, which you must learn by\nheart some day--and sit upon a point of rock, among the shining\nsea-weeds, in the low October tides, and cry and call for the\nwater-babies; but he never heard a voice call in return.  And at\nlast, with his fretting and crying, he grew quite lean and thin.\n\nBut one day among the rocks he found a playfellow.  It was not a\nwater-baby, alas! but it was a lobster; and a very distinguished\nlobster he was; for he had live barnacles on his claws, which is a\ngreat mark of distinction in lobsterdom, and no more to be bought\nfor money than a good conscience or the Victoria Cross.\n\nTom had never seen a lobster before; and he was mightily taken with\nthis one; for he thought him the most curious, odd, ridiculous\ncreature he had ever seen; and there he was not far wrong; for all\nthe ingenious men, and all the scientific men, and all the fanciful\nmen, in the world, with all the old German bogy-painters into the\nbargain, could never invent, if all their wits were boiled into\none, anything so curious, and so ridiculous, as a lobster.\n\nHe had one claw knobbed and the other jagged; and Tom delighted in\nwatching him hold on to the seaweed with his knobbed claw, while he\ncut up salads with his jagged one, and then put them into his\nmouth, after smelling at them, like a monkey.  And always the\nlittle barnacles threw out their casting-nets and swept the water,\nand came in for their share of whatever there was for dinner.\n\nBut Tom was most astonished to see how he fired himself off--snap!\nlike the leap-frogs which you make out of a goose's breast-bone.\nCertainly he took the most wonderful shots, and backwards, too.\nFor, if he wanted to go into a narrow crack ten yards off, what do\nyou think he did?  If he had gone in head foremost, of course he\ncould not have turned round.  So he used to turn his tail to it,\nand lay his long horns, which carry his sixth sense in their tips\n(and nobody knows what that sixth sense is), straight down his back\nto guide him, and twist his eyes back till they almost came out of\ntheir sockets, and then made ready, present, fire, snap!--and away\nhe went, pop into the hole; and peeped out and twiddled his\nwhiskers, as much as to say, \"You couldn't do that.\"\n\nTom asked him about water-babies.  \"Yes,\" he said.  He had seen\nthem often.  But he did not think much of them.  They were\nmeddlesome little creatures, that went about helping fish and\nshells which got into scrapes.  Well, for his part, he should be\nashamed to be helped by little soft creatures that had not even a\nshell on their backs.  He had lived quite long enough in the world\nto take care of himself.\n\nHe was a conceited fellow, the old lobster, and not very civil to\nTom; and you will hear how he had to alter his mind before he was\ndone, as conceited people generally have.  But he was so funny, and\nTom so lonely, that he could not quarrel with him; and they used to\nsit in holes in the rocks, and chat for hours.\n\nAnd about this time there happened to Tom a very strange and\nimportant adventure--so important, indeed, that he was very near\nnever finding the water-babies at all; and I am sure you would have\nbeen sorry for that.\n\nI hope that you have not forgotten the little white lady all this\nwhile.  At least, here she comes, looking like a clean white good\nlittle darling, as she always was, and always will be.  For it\nbefell in the pleasant short December days, when the wind always\nblows from the south-west, till Old Father Christmas comes and\nspreads the great white table-cloth, ready for little boys and\ngirls to give the birds their Christmas dinner of crumbs--it befell\n(to go on) in the pleasant December days, that Sir John was so busy\nhunting that nobody at home could get a word out of him.  Four days\na week he hunted, and very good sport he had; and the other two he\nwent to the bench and the board of guardians, and very good justice\nhe did; and, when he got home in time, he dined at five; for he\nhated this absurd new fashion of dining at eight in the hunting\nseason, which forces a man to make interest with the footman for\ncold beef and beer as soon as he comes in, and so spoil his\nappetite, and then sleep in an arm-chair in his bedroom, all stiff\nand tired, for two or three hours before he can get his dinner like\na gentleman.  And do you be like Sir John, my dear little man, when\nyou are your own master; and, if you want either to read hard or\nride hard, stick to the good old Cambridge hours of breakfast at\neight and dinner at five; by which you may get two days' work out\nof one.  But, of course, if you find a fox at three in the\nafternoon and run him till dark, and leave off twenty miles from\nhome, why you must wait for your dinner till you can get it, as\nbetter men than you have done.  Only see that, if you go hungry,\nyour horse does not; but give him his warm gruel and beer, and take\nhim gently home, remembering that good horses don't grow on the\nhedge like blackberries.\n\nIt befell (to go on a second time) that Sir John, hunting all day,\nand dining at five, fell asleep every evening, and snored so\nterribly that all the windows in Harthover shook, and the soot fell\ndown the chimneys.  Whereon My Lady, being no more able to get\nconversation out of him than a song out of a dead nightingale,\ndetermined to go off and leave him, and the doctor, and Captain\nSwinger the agent, to snore in concert every evening to their\nhearts' content.  So she started for the seaside with all the\nchildren, in order to put herself and them into condition by mild\napplications of iodine.  She might as well have stayed at home and\nused Parry's liquid horse-blister, for there was plenty of it in\nthe stables; and then she would have saved her money, and saved the\nchance, also, of making all the children ill instead of well (as\nhundreds are made), by taking them to some nasty smelling undrained\nlodging, and then wondering how they caught scarlatina and\ndiphtheria:  but people won't be wise enough to understand that\ntill they are dead of bad smells, and then it will be too late;\nbesides you see, Sir John did certainly snore very loud.\n\nBut where she went to nobody must know, for fear young ladies\nshould begin to fancy that there are water-babies there! and so\nhunt and howk after them (besides raising the price of lodgings),\nand keep them in aquariums, as the ladies at Pompeii (as you may\nsee by the paintings) used to keep Cupids in cages.  But nobody\never heard that they starved the Cupids, or let them die of dirt\nand neglect, as English young ladies do by the poor sea-beasts.  So\nnobody must know where My Lady went.  Letting water-babies die is\nas bad as taking singing birds' eggs; for, though there are\nthousands, ay, millions, of both of them in the world, yet there is\nnot one too many.\n\nNow it befell that, on the very shore, and over the very rocks,\nwhere Tom was sitting with his friend the lobster, there walked one\nday the little white lady, Ellie herself, and with her a very wise\nman indeed--Professor Ptthmllnsprts.\n\nHis mother was a Dutchwoman, and therefore he was born at Curacao\n(of course you have learnt your geography, and therefore know why);\nand his father a Pole, and therefore he was brought up at\nPetropaulowski (of course you have learnt your modern politics, and\ntherefore know why):  but for all that he was as thorough an\nEnglishman as ever coveted his neighbour's goods.  And his name, as\nI said, was Professor Ptthmllnsprts, which is a very ancient and\nnoble Polish name.\n\nHe was, as I said, a very great naturalist, and chief professor of\nNecrobioneopalaeonthydrochthonanthropopithekology in the new\nuniversity which the king of the Cannibal Islands had founded; and,\nbeing a member of the Acclimatisation Society, he had come here to\ncollect all the nasty things which he could find on the coast of\nEngland, and turn them loose round the Cannibal Islands, because\nthey had not nasty things enough there to eat what they left.\n\nBut he was a very worthy kind good-natured little old gentleman;\nand very fond of children (for he was not the least a cannibal\nhimself); and very good to all the world as long as it was good to\nhim.  Only one fault he had, which cock-robins have likewise, as\nyou may see if you look out of the nursery window--that, when any\none else found a curious worm, he would hop round them, and peck\nthem, and set up his tail, and bristle up his feathers, just as a\ncock-robin would; and declare that he found the worm first; and\nthat it was his worm; and, if not, that then it was not a worm at\nall.\n\nHe had met Sir John at Scarborough, or Fleetwood, or somewhere or\nother (if you don't care where, nobody else does), and had made\nacquaintance with him, and become very fond of his children.  Now,\nSir John knew nothing about sea-cockyolybirds, and cared less,\nprovided the fishmonger sent him good fish for dinner; and My Lady\nknew as little:  but she thought it proper that the children should\nknow something.  For in the stupid old times, you must understand,\nchildren were taught to know one thing, and to know it well; but in\nthese enlightened new times they are taught to know a little about\neverything, and to know it all ill; which is a great deal\npleasanter and easier, and therefore quite right.\n\nSo Ellie and he were walking on the rocks, and he was showing her\nabout one in ten thousand of all the beautiful and curious things\nwhich are to be seen there.  But little Ellie was not satisfied\nwith them at all.  She liked much better to play with live\nchildren, or even with dolls, which she could pretend were alive;\nand at last she said honestly, \"I don't care about all these\nthings, because they can't play with me, or talk to me.  If there\nwere little children now in the water, as there used to be, and I\ncould see them, I should like that.\"\n\n\"Children in the water, you strange little duck?\" said the\nprofessor.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ellie.  \"I know there used to be children in the water,\nand mermaids too, and mermen.  I saw them all in a picture at home,\nof a beautiful lady sailing in a car drawn by dolphins, and babies\nflying round her, and one sitting in her lap; and the mermaids\nswimming and playing, and the mermen trumpeting on conch-shells;\nand it is called 'The Triumph of Galatea;' and there is a burning\nmountain in the picture behind.  It hangs on the great staircase,\nand I have looked at it ever since I was a baby, and dreamt about\nit a hundred times; and it is so beautiful, that it must be true.\"\n\nBut the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things\nwere true, merely because people thought them beautiful.  For at\nthat rate, he said, the Baltas would be quite right in thinking it\na fine thing to eat their grandpapas, because they thought it an\nugly thing to put them underground.  The professor, indeed, went\nfurther, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be\ntrue, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle.\n\nHe held very strange theories about a good many things.  He had\neven got up once at the British Association, and declared that apes\nhad hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have.  Which\nwas a shocking thing to say; for, if it were so, what would become\nof the faith, hope, and charity of immortal millions?  You may\nthink that there are other more important differences between you\nand an ape, such as being able to speak, and make machines, and\nknow right from wrong, and say your prayers, and other little\nmatters of that kind; but that is a child's fancy, my dear.\nNothing is to be depended on but the great hippopotamus test.  If\nyou have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape, though\nyou had four hands, no feet, and were more apish than the apes of\nall aperies.  But if a hippopotamus major is ever discovered in one\nsingle ape's brain, nothing will save your great-great-great-great-\ngreat-great-great-great-great-great-great-greater-greatest-\ngrandmother from having been an ape too.  No, my dear little man;\nalways remember that the one true, certain, final, and all-\nimportant difference between you and an ape is, that you have a\nhippopotamus major in your brain, and it has none; and that,\ntherefore, to discover one in its brain will be a very wrong and\ndangerous thing, at which every one will be very much shocked, as\nwe may suppose they were at the professor.--Though really, after\nall, it don't much matter; because--as Lord Dundreary and others\nwould put it--nobody but men have hippopotamuses in their brains;\nso, if a hippopotamus was discovered in an ape's brain, why it\nwould not be one, you know, but something else.\n\nBut the professor had gone, I am sorry to say, even further than\nthat; for he had read at the British Association at Melbourne,\nAustralia, in the year 1999, a paper which assured every one who\nfound himself the better or wiser for the news, that there were\nnot, never had been, and could not be, any rational or half-\nrational beings except men, anywhere, anywhen, or anyhow; that\nnymphs, satyrs, fauns, inui, dwarfs, trolls, elves, gnomes,\nfairies, brownies, nixes, wills, kobolds, leprechaunes,\ncluricaunes, banshees, will-o'-the-wisps, follets, lutins, magots,\ngoblins, afrits, marids, jinns, ghouls, peris, deevs, angels,\narchangels, imps, bogies, or worse, were nothing at all, and pure\nbosh and wind.  And he had to get up very early in the morning to\nprove that, and to eat his breakfast overnight; but he did it, at\nleast to his own satisfaction.  Whereon a certain great divine, and\na very clever divine was he, called him a regular Sadducee; and\nprobably he was quite right.  Whereon the professor, in return,\ncalled him a regular Pharisee; and probably he was quite right too.\nBut they did not quarrel in the least; for, when men are men of the\nworld, hard words run off them like water off a duck's back.  So\nthe professor and the divine met at dinner that evening, and sat\ntogether on the sofa afterwards for an hour, and talked over the\nstate of female labour on the antarctic continent (for nobody talks\nshop after his claret), and each vowed that the other was the best\ncompany he ever met in his life.  What an advantage it is to be men\nof the world!\n\nFrom all which you may guess that the professor was not the least\nof little Ellie's opinion.  So he gave her a succinct compendium of\nhis famous paper at the British Association, in a form suited for\nthe youthful mind.  But, as we have gone over his arguments against\nwater-babies once already, which is once too often, we will not\nrepeat them here.\n\nNow little Ellie was, I suppose, a stupid little girl; for, instead\nof being convinced by Professor Ptthmllnsprts' arguments, she only\nasked the same question over again.\n\n\"But why are there not water-babies?\"\n\nI trust and hope that it was because the professor trod at that\nmoment on the edge of a very sharp mussel, and hurt one of his\ncorns sadly, that he answered quite sharply, forgetting that he was\na scientific man, and therefore ought to have known that he\ncouldn't know; and that he was a logician, and therefore ought to\nhave known that he could not prove a universal negative--I say, I\ntrust and hope it was because the mussel hurt his corn, that the\nprofessor answered quite sharply:\n\n\"Because there ain't.\"\n\nWhich was not even good English, my dear little boy; for, as you\nmust know from Aunt Agitate's Arguments, the professor ought to\nhave said, if he was so angry as to say anything of the kind--\nBecause there are not:  or are none:  or are none of them; or (if\nhe had been reading Aunt Agitate too) because they do not exist.\n\nAnd he groped with his net under the weeds so violently, that, as\nit befell, he caught poor little Tom.\n\nHe felt the net very heavy; and lifted it out quickly, with Tom all\nentangled in the meshes.\n\n\"Dear me!\" he cried.  \"What a large pink Holothurian; with hands,\ntoo!  It must be connected with Synapta.\"\n\nAnd he took him out.\n\n\"It has actually eyes!\" he cried.  \"Why, it must be a Cephalopod!\nThis is most extraordinary!\"\n\n\"No, I ain't!\" cried Tom, as loud as he could; for he did not like\nto be called bad names.\n\n\"It is a water-baby!\" cried Ellie; and of course it was.\n\n\"Water-fiddlesticks, my dear!\" said the professor; and he turned\naway sharply.\n\nThere was no denying it.  It was a water-baby:  and he had said a\nmoment ago that there were none.  What was he to do?\n\nHe would have liked, of course, to have taken Tom home in a bucket.\nHe would not have put him in spirits.  Of course not.  He would\nhave kept him alive, and petted him (for he was a very kind old\ngentleman), and written a book about him, and given him two long\nnames, of which the first would have said a little about Tom, and\nthe second all about himself; for of course he would have called\nhim Hydrotecnon Ptthmllnsprtsianum, or some other long name like\nthat; for they are forced to call everything by long names now,\nbecause they have used up all the short ones, ever since they took\nto making nine species out of one.  But--what would all the learned\nmen say to him after his speech at the British Association?  And\nwhat would Ellie say, after what he had just told her?\n\nThere was a wise old heathen once, who said, \"Maxima debetur pueris\nreverentia\"--The greatest reverence is due to children; that is,\nthat grown people should never say or do anything wrong before\nchildren, lest they should set them a bad example.--Cousin\nCramchild says it means, \"The greatest respectfulness is expected\nfrom little boys.\"  But he was raised in a country where little\nboys are not expected to be respectful, because all of them are as\ngood as the President:- Well, every one knows his own concerns\nbest; so perhaps they are.  But poor Cousin Cramchild, to do him\njustice, not being of that opinion, and having a moral mission, and\nbeing no scholar to speak of, and hard up for an authority--why, it\nwas a very great temptation for him.  But some people, and I am\nafraid the professor was one of them, interpret that in a more\nstrange, curious, one-sided, left-handed, topsy-turvy, inside-out,\nbehind-before fashion than even Cousin Cramchild; for they make it\nmean, that you must show your respect for children, by never\nconfessing yourself in the wrong to them, even if you know that you\nare so, lest they should lose confidence in their elders.\n\nNow, if the professor had said to Ellie, \"Yes, my darling, it is a\nwater-baby, and a very wonderful thing it is; and it shows how\nlittle I know of the wonders of nature, in spite of forty years'\nhonest labour.  I was just telling you that there could be no such\ncreatures; and, behold! here is one come to confound my conceit and\nshow me that Nature can do, and has done, beyond all that man's\npoor fancy can imagine.  So, let us thank the Maker, and Inspirer,\nand Lord of Nature for all His wonderful and glorious works, and\ntry and find out something about this one;\"--I think that, if the\nprofessor had said that, little Ellie would have believed him more\nfirmly, and respected him more deeply, and loved him better, than\never she had done before.  But he was of a different opinion.  He\nhesitated a moment.  He longed to keep Tom, and yet he half wished\nhe never had caught him; and at last he quite longed to get rid of\nhim.  So he turned away and poked Tom with his finger, for want of\nanything better to do; and said carelessly, \"My dear little maid,\nyou must have dreamt of water-babies last night, your head is so\nfull of them.\"\n\nNow Tom had been in the most horrible and unspeakable fright all\nthe while; and had kept as quiet as he could, though he was called\na Holothurian and a Cephalopod; for it was fixed in his little head\nthat if a man with clothes on caught him, he might put clothes on\nhim too, and make a dirty black chimney-sweep of him again.  But,\nwhen the professor poked him, it was more than he could bear; and,\nbetween fright and rage, he turned to bay as valiantly as a mouse\nin a corner, and bit the professor's finger till it bled.\n\n\"Oh! ah! yah!\" cried he; and glad of an excuse to be rid of Tom,\ndropped him on to the seaweed, and thence he dived into the water\nand was gone in a moment.\n\n\"But it was a water-baby, and I heard it speak!\" cried Ellie.  \"Ah,\nit is gone!\"  And she jumped down off the rock, to try and catch\nTom before he slipped into the sea.\n\nToo late! and what was worse, as she sprang down, she slipped, and\nfell some six feet, with her head on a sharp rock, and lay quite\nstill.\n\nThe professor picked her up, and tried to waken her, and called to\nher, and cried over her, for he loved her very much:  but she would\nnot waken at all.  So he took her up in his arms and carried her to\nher governess, and they all went home; and little Ellie was put to\nbed, and lay there quite still; only now and then she woke up and\ncalled out about the water-baby:  but no one knew what she meant,\nand the professor did not tell, for he was ashamed to tell.\n\nAnd, after a week, one moonlight night, the fairies came flying in\nat the window and brought her such a pretty pair of wings that she\ncould not help putting them on; and she flew with them out of the\nwindow, and over the land, and over the sea, and up through the\nclouds, and nobody heard or saw anything of her for a very long\nwhile.\n\nAnd this is why they say that no one has ever yet seen a water-\nbaby.  For my part, I believe that the naturalists get dozens of\nthem when they are out dredging; but they say nothing about them,\nand throw them overboard again, for fear of spoiling their\ntheories.  But, you see the professor was found out, as every one\nis in due time.  A very terrible old fairy found the professor out;\nshe felt his bumps, and cast his nativity, and took the lunars of\nhim carefully inside and out; and so she knew what he would do as\nwell as if she had seen it in a print book, as they say in the dear\nold west country; and he did it; and so he was found out\nbeforehand, as everybody always is; and the old fairy will find out\nthe naturalists some day, and put them in the Times, and then on\nwhose side will the laugh be?\n\nSo the old fairy took him in hand very severely there and then.\nBut she says she is always most severe with the best people,\nbecause there is most chance of curing them, and therefore they are\nthe patients who pay her best; for she has to work on the same\nsalary as the Emperor of China's physicians (it is a pity that all\ndo not), no cure, no pay.\n\nSo she took the poor professor in hand:  and because he was not\ncontent with things as they are, she filled his head with things as\nthey are not, to try if he would like them better; and because he\ndid not choose to believe in a water-baby when he saw it, she made\nhim believe in worse things than water-babies--in unicorns, fire-\ndrakes, manticoras, basilisks, amphisbaenas, griffins, phoenixes,\nrocs, orcs, dog-headed men, three-headed dogs, three-bodied\ngeryons, and other pleasant creatures, which folks think never\nexisted yet, and which folks hope never will exist, though they\nknow nothing about the matter, and never will; and these creatures\nso upset, terrified, flustered, aggravated, confused, astounded,\nhorrified, and totally flabbergasted the poor professor that the\ndoctors said that he was out of his wits for three months; and\nperhaps they were right, as they are now and then.\n\nSo all the doctors in the county were called in to make a report on\nhis case; and of course every one of them flatly contradicted the\nother:  else what use is there in being men of science?  But at\nlast the majority agreed on a report in the true medical language,\none half bad Latin, the other half worse Greek, and the rest what\nmight have been English, if they had only learnt to write it.  And\nthis is the beginning thereof -\n\n\n\"The subanhypaposupernal anastomoses of peritomic diacellurite in\nthe encephalo digital region of the distinguished individual of\nwhose symptomatic phoenomena we had the melancholy honour\n(subsequently to a preliminary diagnostic inspection) of making an\ninspectorial diagnosis, presenting the interexclusively\nquadrilateral and antinomian diathesis known as Bumpsterhausen's\nblue follicles, we proceeded\" -\n\n\nBut what they proceeded to do My Lady never knew; for she was so\nfrightened at the long words that she ran for her life, and locked\nherself into her bedroom, for fear of being squashed by the words\nand strangled by the sentence.  A boa constrictor, she said, was\nbad company enough:  but what was a boa constrictor made of paving\nstones?\n\n\"It was quite shocking!  What can they think is the matter with\nhim?\" said she to the old nurse.\n\n\"That his wit's just addled; may be wi' unbelief and heathenry,\"\nquoth she.\n\n\"Then why can't they say so?\"\n\nAnd the heaven, and the sea, and the rocks, and the vales re-\nechoed--\"Why indeed?\"  But the doctors never heard them.\n\nSo she made Sir John write to the Times to command the Chancellor\nof the Exchequer for the time being to put a tax on long words; -\n\nA light tax on words over three syllables, which are necessary\nevils, like rats:  but, like them, must be kept down judiciously.\n\nA heavy tax on words over four syllables, as heterodoxy,\nspontaneity, spiritualism, spuriosity, etc.\n\nAnd on words over five syllables (of which I hope no one will wish\nto see any examples), a totally prohibitory tax.\n\nAnd a similar prohibitory tax on words derived from three or more\nlanguages at once; words derived from two languages having become\nso common that there was no more hope of rooting out them than of\nrooting out peth-winds.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, being a scholar and a man of\nsense, jumped at the notion; for he saw in it the one and only plan\nfor abolishing Schedule D:  but when he brought in his bill, most\nof the Irish members, and (I am sorry to say) some of the Scotch\nlikewise, opposed it most strongly, on the ground that in a free\ncountry no man was bound either to understand himself or to let\nothers understand him.  So the bill fell through on the first\nreading; and the Chancellor, being a philosopher, comforted himself\nwith the thought that it was not the first time that a woman had\nhit off a grand idea and the men turned up their stupid noses\nthereat.\n\nNow the doctors had it all their own way; and to work they went in\nearnest, and they gave the poor professor divers and sundry\nmedicines, as prescribed by the ancients and moderns, from\nHippocrates to Feuchtersleben, as below, viz.-\n\n1.  Hellebore, to wit -\n\nHellebore of AEta.\nHellebore of Galatia.\nHellebore of Sicily.\n\nAnd all other Hellebores, after the method of the Helleborising\nHelleborists of the Helleboric era.  But that would not do.\nBumpsterhausen's blue follicles would not stir an inch out of his\nencephalo digital region.\n\n2.  Trying to find out what was the matter with him, after the\nmethod of\n\nHippocrates,\nAretaeus,\nCelsus,\nCoelius Aurelianus,\nAnd Galen.\n\nBut they found that a great deal too much trouble, as most people\nhave since; and so had recourse to -\n\n3.  Borage.\nCauteries.\n\nBoring a hole in his head to let out fumes, which (says Gordonius)\n\"will, without doubt, do much good.\"  But it didn't.\n\nBezoar stone.\nDiamargaritum.\nA ram's brain boiled in spice.\nOil of wormwood.\nWater of Nile.\nCapers.\nGood wine (but there was none to be got).\nThe water of a smith's forge.\nAmbergris.\nMandrake pillows.\nDormouse fat.\nHares' ears.\nStarvation.\nCamphor.\nSalts and senna.\nMusk.\nOpium.\nStrait-waistcoats.\nBullyings.\nBumpings.\nBleedings.\nBucketings with cold water.\nKnockings down.\nKneeling on his chest till they broke it in, etc. etc.; after the\nmedieval or monkish method:  but that would not do.\nBumpsterhausen's blue follicles stuck there still.\n\nThen -\n\n4.  Coaxing.\nKissing.\nChampagne and turtle.\nRed herrings and soda water.\nGood advice.\nGardening.\nCroquet.\nMusical soirees.\nAunt Salty.\nMild tobacco.\nThe Saturday Review.\nA carriage with outriders, etc. etc.\n\nAfter the modern method.  But that would not do.\n\nAnd if he had but been a convict lunatic, and had shot at the\nQueen, killed all his creditors to avoid paying them, or indulged\nin any other little amiable eccentricity of that kind, they would\nhave given him in addition -\n\nThe healthiest situation in England, on Easthampstead Plain.\n\nFree run of Windsor Forest.\n\nThe Times every morning.\n\nA double-barrelled gun and pointers, and leave to shoot three\nWellington College boys a week (not more) in case black game was\nscarce.\n\nBut as he was neither mad enough nor bad enough to be allowed such\nluxuries, they grew desperate, and fell into bad ways, viz. -\n\n5.  Suffumigations of sulphur.\nHerrwiggius his \"Incomparable drink for madmen:\"\n\nOnly they could not find out what it was.\n\nSuffumigation of the liver of the fish * * *\n\nOnly they had forgotten its name, so Dr. Gray could not well\nprocure them a specimen.\n\nMetallic tractors.\nHolloway's Ointment.\nElectro-biology.\nValentine Greatrakes his Stroking Cure.\nSpirit-rapping.\nHolloway's Pills.\nTable-turning.\nMorison's Pills.\nHomoeopathy.\nParr's Life Pills.\nMesmerism.\nPure Bosh.\nExorcisms, for which the read Maleus Maleficarum, Nideri\nFormicarium, Delrio, Wierus, etc.\n\nBut could not get one that mentioned water-babies.\n\nHydropathy.\nMadame Rachel's Elixir of Youth.\nThe Poughkeepsie Seer his Prophecies.\nThe distilled liquor of addle eggs.\nPyropathy.\n\nAs successfully employed by the old inquisitors to cure the malady\nof thought, and now by the Persian Mollahs to cure that of\nrheumatism.\n\nGeopathy, or burying him.\nAtmopathy, or steaming him.\nSympathy, after the method of Basil Valentine his Triumph of\nAntimony, and Kenelm Digby his Weapon-salve, which some call a hair\nof the dog that bit him.\nHermopathy, or pouring mercury down his throat to move the animal\nspirits.\nMeteoropathy, or going up to the moon to look for his lost wits, as\nRuggiero did for Orlando Furioso's:  only, having no hippogriff,\nthey were forced to use a balloon; and, falling into the North Sea,\nwere picked up by a Yarmouth herring-boat, and came home much the\nwiser, and all over scales.\n\nAntipathy, or using him like \"a man and a brother.\"\n\nApathy, or doing nothing at all.\n\nWith all other ipathies and opathies which Noodle has invented, and\nFoodle tried, since black-fellows chipped flints at Abbeville--\nwhich is a considerable time ago, to judge by the Great Exhibition.\n\n\nBut nothing would do; for he screamed and cried all day for a\nwater-baby, to come and drive away the monsters; and of course they\ndid not try to find one, because they did not believe in them, and\nwere thinking of nothing but Bumpsterhausen's blue follicles;\nhaving, as usual, set the cart before the horse, and taken the\neffect for the cause.\n\nSo they were forced at last to let the poor professor ease his mind\nby writing a great book, exactly contrary to all his old opinions;\nin which he proved that the moon was made of green cheese, and that\nall the mites in it (which you may see sometimes quite plain\nthrough a telescope, if you will only keep the lens dirty enough,\nas Mr. Weekes kept his voltaic battery) are nothing in the world\nbut little babies, who are hatching and swarming up there in\nmillions, ready to come down into this world whenever children want\na new little brother or sister.\n\nWhich must be a mistake, for this one reason:  that, there being no\natmosphere round the moon (though some one or other says there is,\nat least on the other side, and that he has been round at the back\nof it to see, and found that the moon was just the shape of a Bath\nbun, and so wet that the man in the moon went about on Midsummer-\nday in Macintoshes and Cording's boots, spearing eels and\nsneezing); that, therefore, I say, there being no atmosphere, there\ncan be no evaporation; and therefore the dew-point can never fall\nbelow 71.5 degrees below zero of Fahrenheit:  and, therefore, it\ncannot be cold enough there about four o'clock in the morning to\ncondense the babies' mesenteric apophthegms into their left\nventricles; and, therefore, they can never catch the hooping-cough;\nand if they do not have hooping-cough, they cannot be babies at\nall; and, therefore, there are no babies in the moon.--Q.E.D.\n\nWhich may seem a roundabout reason; and so, perhaps, it is:  but\nyou will have heard worse ones in your time, and from better men\nthan you are.\n\nBut one thing is certain; that, when the good old doctor got his\nbook written, he felt considerably relieved from Bumpsterhausen's\nblue follicles, and a few things infinitely worse; to wit, from\npride and vain-glory, and from blindness and hardness of heart;\nwhich are the true causes of Bumpsterhausen's blue follicles, and\nof a good many other ugly things besides.  Whereon the foul flood-\nwater in his brains ran down, and cleared to a fine coffee colour,\nsuch as fish like to rise in, till very fine clean fresh-run fish\ndid begin to rise in his brains; and he caught two or three of them\n(which is exceedingly fine sport, for brain rivers), and anatomised\nthem carefully, and never mentioned what he found out from them,\nexcept to little children; and became ever after a sadder and a\nwiser man; which is a very good thing to become, my dear little\nboy, even though one has to pay a heavy price for the blessing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n\n\"Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear\nThe Godhead's most benignant grace;\nNor know we anything so fair\nAs is the smile upon thy face:\nFlowers laugh before thee on their beds\nAnd fragrance in thy footing treads;\nThou dost preserve the stars from wrong;\nAnd the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong.\"\n\nWORDSWORTH, Ode to Duty.\n\n\nWhat became of little Tom?\n\nHe slipped away off the rocks into the water, as I said before.\nBut he could not help thinking of little Ellie.  He did not\nremember who she was; but he knew that she was a little girl,\nthough she was a hundred times as big as he.  That is not\nsurprising:  size has nothing to do with kindred.  A tiny weed may\nbe first cousin to a great tree; and a little dog like Vick knows\nthat Lioness is a dog too, though she is twenty times larger than\nherself.  So Tom knew that Ellie was a little girl, and thought\nabout her all that day, and longed to have had her to play with;\nbut he had very soon to think of something else.  And here is the\naccount of what happened to him, as it was published next morning,\nin the Water-proof Gazette, on the finest watered paper, for the\nuse of the great fairy, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, who reads the news\nvery carefully every morning, and especially the police cases, as\nyou will hear very soon.\n\nHe was going along the rocks in three-fathom water, watching the\npollock catch prawns, and the wrasses nibble barnacles off the\nrocks, shells and all, when he saw a round cage of green withes;\nand inside it, looking very much ashamed of himself, sat his friend\nthe lobster, twiddling his horns, instead of thumbs.\n\n\"What, have you been naughty, and have they put you in the lock-\nup?\" asked Tom.\n\nThe lobster felt a little indignant at such a notion, but he was\ntoo much depressed in spirits to argue; so he only said, \"I can't\nget out.\"\n\n\"Why did you get in?\"\n\n\"After that nasty piece of dead fish.\"  He had thought it looked\nand smelt very nice when he was outside, and so it did, for a\nlobster:  but now he turned round and abused it because he was\nangry with himself.\n\n\"Where did you get in?\"\n\n\"Through that round hole at the top.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you get out through it?\"\n\n\"Because I can't:\" and the lobster twiddled his horns more fiercely\nthan ever, but he was forced to confess.\n\n\"I have jumped upwards, downwards, backwards, and sideways, at\nleast four thousand times; and I can't get out:  I always get up\nunderneath there, and can't find the hole.\"\n\nTom looked at the trap, and having more wit than the lobster, he\nsaw plainly enough what was the matter; as you may if you will look\nat a lobster-pot.\n\n\"Stop a bit,\" said Tom.  \"Turn your tail up to me, and I'll pull\nyou through hindforemost, and then you won't stick in the spikes.\"\n\nBut the lobster was so stupid and clumsy that he couldn't hit the\nhole.  Like a great many fox-hunters, he was very sharp as long as\nhe was in his own country; but as soon as they get out of it they\nlose their heads; and so the lobster, so to speak, lost his tail.\n\nTom reached and clawed down the hole after him, till he caught hold\nof him; and then, as was to be expected, the clumsy lobster pulled\nhim in head foremost.\n\n\"Hullo! here is a pretty business,\" said Tom.  \"Now take your great\nclaws, and break the points off those spikes, and then we shall\nboth get out easily.\"\n\n\"Dear me, I never thought of that,\" said the lobster; \"and after\nall the experience of life that I have had!\"\n\nYou see, experience is of very little good unless a man, or a\nlobster, has wit enough to make use of it.  For a good many people,\nlike old Polonius, have seen all the world, and yet remain little\nbetter than children after all.\n\nBut they had not got half the spikes away when they saw a great\ndark cloud over them:  and lo, and behold, it was the otter.\n\nHow she did grin and grin when she saw Tom.  \"Yar!\" said she, \"you\nlittle meddlesome wretch, I have you now!  I will serve you out for\ntelling the salmon where I was!\"  And she crawled all over the pot\nto get in.\n\nTom was horribly frightened, and still more frightened when she\nfound the hole in the top, and squeezed herself right down through\nit, all eyes and teeth.  But no sooner was her head inside than\nvaliant Mr. Lobster caught her by the nose and held on.\n\nAnd there they were all three in the pot, rolling over and over,\nand very tight packing it was.  And the lobster tore at the otter,\nand the otter tore at the lobster, and both squeezed and thumped\npoor Tom till he had no breath left in his body; and I don't know\nwhat would have happened to him if he had not at last got on the\notter's back, and safe out of the hole.\n\nHe was right glad when he got out:  but he would not desert his\nfriend who had saved him; and the first time he saw his tail\nuppermost he caught hold of it, and pulled with all his might.\n\nBut the lobster would not let go.\n\n\"Come along,\" said Tom; \"don't you see she is dead?\"  And so she\nwas, quite drowned and dead.\n\nAnd that was the end of the wicked otter.\n\nBut the lobster would not let go.\n\n\"Come along, you stupid old stick-in-the-mud,\" cried Tom, \"or the\nfisherman will catch you!\"  And that was true, for Tom felt some\none above beginning to haul up the pot.\n\nBut the lobster would not let go.  Tom saw the fisherman haul him\nup to the boat-side, and thought it was all up with him.  But when\nMr. Lobster saw the fisherman, he gave such a furious and\ntremendous snap, that he snapped out of his hand, and out of the\npot, and safe into the sea.  But he left his knobbed claw behind\nhim; for it never came into his stupid head to let go after all, so\nhe just shook his claw off as the easier method.  It was something\nof a bull, that; but you must know the lobster was an Irish\nlobster, and was hatched off Island Magee at the mouth of Belfast\nLough.\n\nTom asked the lobster why he never thought of letting go.  He said\nvery determinedly that it was a point of honour among lobsters.\nAnd so it is, as the Mayor of Plymouth found out once to his cost--\neight or nine hundred years ago, of course; for if it had happened\nlately it would be personal to mention it.\n\nFor one day he was so tired with sitting on a hard chair, in a\ngrand furred gown, with a gold chain round his neck, hearing one\npoliceman after another come in and sing, \"What shall we do with\nthe drunken sailor, so early in the morning?\" and answering them\neach exactly alike:\n\n\"Put him in the round house till he gets sober, so early in the\nmorning\" -\n\nThat, when it was over, he jumped up, and played leap-frog with the\ntown-clerk till he burst his buttons, and then had his luncheon,\nand burst some more buttons, and then said:  \"It is a low spring-\ntide; I shall go out this afternoon and cut my capers.\"\n\nNow he did not mean to cut such capers as you eat with boiled\nmutton.  It was the commandant of artillery at Valetta who used to\namuse himself with cutting them, and who stuck upon one of the\nbastions a notice, \"No one allowed to cut capers here but me,\"\nwhich greatly edified the midshipmen in port, and the Maltese on\nthe Nix Mangiare stairs.  But all that the mayor meant was that he\nwould go and have an afternoon's fun, like any schoolboy, and catch\nlobsters with an iron hook.\n\nSo to the Mewstone he went, and for lobsters he looked.  And when\nhe came to a certain crack in the rocks he was so excited that,\ninstead of putting in his hook, he put in his hand; and Mr. Lobster\nwas at home, and caught him by the finger, and held on.\n\n\"Yah!\" said the mayor, and pulled as hard as he dared:  but the\nmore he pulled, the more the lobster pinched, till he was forced to\nbe quiet.\n\nThen he tried to get his hook in with his other hand; but the hole\nwas too narrow.\n\nThen he pulled again; but he could not stand the pain.\n\nThen he shouted and bawled for help:  but there was no one nearer\nhim than the men-of-war inside the breakwater.\n\nThen he began to turn a little pale; for the tide flowed, and still\nthe lobster held on.\n\nThen he turned quite white; for the tide was up to his knees, and\nstill the lobster held on.\n\nThen he thought of cutting off his finger; but he wanted two things\nto do it with--courage and a knife; and he had got neither.\n\nThen he turned quite yellow; for the tide was up to his waist, and\nstill the lobster held on.\n\nThen he thought over all the naughty things he ever had done; all\nthe sand which he had put in the sugar, and the sloe-leaves in the\ntea, and the water in the treacle, and the salt in the tobacco\n(because his brother was a brewer, and a man must help his own\nkin).\n\nThen he turned quite blue; for the tide was up to his breast, and\nstill the lobster held on.\n\nThen, I have no doubt, he repented fully of all the said naughty\nthings which he had done, and promised to mend his life, as too\nmany do when they think they have no life left to mend.  Whereby,\nas they fancy, they make a very cheap bargain.  But the old fairy\nwith the birch rod soon undeceives them.\n\nAnd then he grew all colours at once, and turned up his eyes like a\nduck in thunder; for the water was up to his chin, and still the\nlobster held on.\n\nAnd then came a man-of-war's boat round the Mewstone, and saw his\nhead sticking up out of the water.  One said it was a keg of\nbrandy, and another that it was a cocoa-nut, and another that it\nwas a buoy loose, and another that it was a black diver, and wanted\nto fire at it, which would not have been pleasant for the mayor:\nbut just then such a yell came out of a great hole in the middle of\nit that the midshipman in charge guessed what it was, and bade pull\nup to it as fast as they could.  So somehow or other the Jack-tars\ngot the lobster out, and set the mayor free, and put him ashore at\nthe Barbican.  He never went lobster-catching again; and we will\nhope he put no more salt in the tobacco, not even to sell his\nbrother's beer.\n\nAnd that is the story of the Mayor of Plymouth, which has two\nadvantages--first, that of being quite true; and second, that of\nhaving (as folks say all good stories ought to have) no moral\nwhatsoever:  no more, indeed, has any part of this book, because it\nis a fairy tale, you know.\n\nAnd now happened to Tom a most wonderful thing; for he had not left\nthe lobster five minutes before he came upon a water-baby.\n\nA real live water-baby, sitting on the white sand, very busy about\na little point of rock.  And when it saw Tom it looked up for a\nmoment, and then cried, \"Why, you are not one of us.  You are a new\nbaby!  Oh, how delightful!\"\n\nAnd it ran to Tom, and Tom ran to it, and they hugged and kissed\neach other for ever so long, they did not know why.  But they did\nnot want any introductions there under the water.\n\nAt last Tom said, \"Oh, where have you been all this while?  I have\nbeen looking for you so long, and I have been so lonely.\"\n\n\"We have been here for days and days.  There are hundreds of us\nabout the rocks.  How was it you did not see us, or hear us when we\nsing and romp every evening before we go home?\"\n\nTom looked at the baby again, and then he said:\n\n\"Well, this is wonderful!  I have seen things just like you again\nand again, but I thought you were shells, or sea-creatures.  I\nnever took you for water-babies like myself.\"\n\nNow, was not that very odd?  So odd, indeed, that you will, no\ndoubt, want to know how it happened, and why Tom could never find a\nwater-baby till after he had got the lobster out of the pot.  And,\nif you will read this story nine times over, and then think for\nyourself, you will find out why.  It is not good for little boys to\nbe told everything, and never to be forced to use their own wits.\nThey would learn, then, no more than they do at Dr. Dulcimer's\nfamous suburban establishment for the idler members of the youthful\naristocracy, where the masters learn the lessons and the boys hear\nthem--which saves a great deal of trouble--for the time being.\n\n\"Now,\" said the baby, \"come and help me, or I shall not have\nfinished before my brothers and sisters come, and it is time to go\nhome.\"\n\n\"What shall I help you at?\"\n\n\"At this poor dear little rock; a great clumsy boulder came rolling\nby in the last storm, and knocked all its head off, and rubbed off\nall its flowers.  And now I must plant it again with seaweeds, and\ncoralline, and anemones, and I will make it the prettiest little\nrock-garden on all the shore.\"\n\nSo they worked away at the rock, and planted it, and smoothed the\nsand down round, it, and capital fun they had till the tide began\nto turn.  And then Tom heard all the other babies coming, laughing\nand singing and shouting and romping; and the noise they made was\njust like the noise of the ripple.  So he knew that he had been\nhearing and seeing the water-babies all along; only he did not know\nthem, because his eyes and ears were not opened.\n\nAnd in they came, dozens and dozens of them, some bigger than Tom\nand some smaller, all in the neatest little white bathing dresses;\nand when they found that he was a new baby, they hugged him and\nkissed him, and then put him in the middle and danced round him on\nthe sand, and there was no one ever so happy as poor little Tom.\n\n\"Now then,\" they cried all at once, \"we must come away home, we\nmust come away home, or the tide will leave us dry.  We have mended\nall the broken sea-weed, and put all the rock-pools in order, and\nplanted all the shells again in the sand, and nobody will see where\nthe ugly storm swept in last week.\"\n\nAnd this is the reason why the rock-pools are always so neat and\nclean; because the water-babies come inshore after every storm to\nsweep them out, and comb them down, and put them all to rights\nagain.\n\nOnly where men are wasteful and dirty, and let sewers run into the\nsea instead of putting the stuff upon the fields like thrifty\nreasonable souls; or throw herrings' heads and dead dog-fish, or\nany other refuse, into the water; or in any way make a mess upon\nthe clean shore--there the water-babies will not come, sometimes\nnot for hundreds of years (for they cannot abide anything smelly or\nfoul), but leave the sea-anemones and the crabs to clear away\neverything, till the good tidy sea has covered up all the dirt in\nsoft mud and clean sand, where the water-babies can plant live\ncockles and whelks and razor-shells and sea-cucumbers and golden-\ncombs, and make a pretty live garden again, after man's dirt is\ncleared away.  And that, I suppose, is the reason why there are no\nwater-babies at any watering-place which I have ever seen.\n\nAnd where is the home of the water-babies?  In St. Brandan's fairy\nisle.\n\nDid you never hear of the blessed St. Brandan, how he preached to\nthe wild Irish on the wild, wild Kerry coast, he and five other\nhermits, till they were weary and longed to rest?  For the wild\nIrish would not listen to them, or come to confession and to mass,\nbut liked better to brew potheen, and dance the pater o'pee, and\nknock each other over the head with shillelaghs, and shoot each\nother from behind turf-dykes, and steal each other's cattle, and\nburn each other's homes; till St. Brandan and his friends were\nweary of them, for they would not learn to be peaceable Christians\nat all.\n\nSo St. Brandan went out to the point of Old Dunmore, and looked\nover the tide-way roaring round the Blasquets, at the end of all\nthe world, and away into the ocean, and sighed--\"Ah that I had\nwings as a dove!\"  And far away, before the setting sun, he saw a\nblue fairy sea, and golden fairy islands, and he said, \"Those are\nthe islands of the blest.\"  Then he and his friends got into a\nhooker, and sailed away and away to the westward, and were never\nheard of more.  But the people who would not hear him were changed\ninto gorillas, and gorillas they are until this day.\n\nAnd when St. Brandan and the hermits came to that fairy isle they\nfound it overgrown with cedars and full of beautiful birds; and he\nsat down under the cedars and preached to all the birds in the air.\nAnd they liked his sermons so well that they told the fishes in the\nsea; and they came, and St. Brandan preached to them; and the\nfishes told the water-babies, who live in the caves under the isle;\nand they came up by hundreds every Sunday, and St. Brandan got\nquite a neat little Sunday-school.  And there he taught the water-\nbabies for a great many hundred years, till his eyes grew too dim\nto see, and his beard grew so long that he dared not walk for fear\nof treading on it, and then he might have tumbled down.  And at\nlast he and the five hermits fell fast asleep under the cedar-\nshades, and there they sleep unto this day.  But the fairies took\nto the water-babies, and taught them their lessons themselves.\n\nAnd some say that St. Brandan will awake and begin to teach the\nbabies once more:  but some think that he will sleep on, for better\nfor worse, till the coming of the Cocqcigrues.  But, on still clear\nsummer evenings, when the sun sinks down into the sea, among golden\ncloud-capes and cloud-islands, and locks and friths of azure sky,\nthe sailors fancy that they see, away to westward, St. Brandan's\nfairy isle.\n\nBut whether men can see it or not, St. Brandan's Isle once actually\nstood there; a great land out in the ocean, which has sunk and sunk\nbeneath the waves.  Old Plato called it Atlantis, and told strange\ntales of the wise men who lived therein, and of the wars they\nfought in the old times.  And from off that island came strange\nflowers, which linger still about this land:- the Cornish heath,\nand Cornish moneywort, and the delicate Venus's hair, and the\nLondon-pride which covers the Kerry mountains, and the little pink\nbutterwort of Devon, and the great blue butterwort of Ireland, and\nthe Connemara heath, and the bristle-fern of the Turk waterfall,\nand many a strange plant more; all fairy tokens left for wise men\nand good children from off St. Brandan's Isle.\n\nNow when Tom got there, he found that the isle stood all on\npillars, and that its roots were full of caves.  There were pillars\nof black basalt, like Staffa; and pillars of green and crimson\nserpentine, like Kynance; and pillars ribboned with red and white\nand yellow sandstone, like Livermead; and there were blue grottoes\nlike Capri, and white grottoes like Adelsberg; all curtained and\ndraped with seaweeds, purple and crimson, green and brown; and\nstrewn with soft white sand, on which the water-babies sleep every\nnight.  But, to keep the place clean and sweet, the crabs picked up\nall the scraps off the floor and ate them like so many monkeys;\nwhile the rocks were covered with ten thousand sea-anemones, and\ncorals and madrepores, who scavenged the water all day long, and\nkept it nice and pure.  But, to make up to them for having to do\nsuch nasty work, they were not left black and dirty, as poor\nchimney-sweeps and dustmen are.  No; the fairies are more\nconsiderate and just than that, and have dressed them all in the\nmost beautiful colours and patterns, till they look like vast\nflower-beds of gay blossoms.  If you think I am talking nonsense, I\ncan only say that it is true; and that an old gentleman named\nFourier used to say that we ought to do the same by chimney-sweeps\nand dustmen, and honour them instead of despising them; and he was\na very clever old gentleman:  but, unfortunately for him and the\nworld, as mad as a March hare.\n\nAnd, instead of watchmen and policemen to keep out nasty things at\nnight, there were thousands and thousands of water-snakes, and most\nwonderful creatures they were.  They were all named after the\nNereids, the sea-fairies who took care of them, Eunice and Polynoe,\nPhyllodoce and Psamathe, and all the rest of the pretty darlings\nwho swim round their Queen Amphitrite, and her car of cameo shell.\nThey were dressed in green velvet, and black velvet, and purple\nvelvet; and were all jointed in rings; and some of them had three\nhundred brains apiece, so that they must have been uncommonly\nshrewd detectives; and some had eyes in their tails; and some had\neyes in every joint, so that they kept a very sharp look-out; and\nwhen they wanted a baby-snake, they just grew one at the end of\ntheir own tails, and when it was able to take care of itself it\ndropped off; so that they brought up their families very cheaply.\nBut if any nasty thing came by, out they rushed upon it; and then\nout of each of their hundreds of feet there sprang a whole cutler's\nshop of\n\nScythes,        Javelins,\nBillhooks,      Lances,\nPickaxes,       Halberts,\nForks,          Gisarines,\nPenknives,      Poleaxes,\nRapiers,        Fishhooks,\nSabres,         Bradawls,\nYataghans,      Gimblets,\nCreeses,        Corkscrews,\nGhoorka swords, Pins,\nTucks,          Needles,\nAnd so forth,\n\nwhich stabbed, shot, poked, pricked, scratched, ripped, pinked, and\ncrimped those naughty beasts so terribly, that they had to run for\ntheir lives, or else be chopped into small pieces and be eaten\nafterwards.  And, if that is not all, every word, true, then there\nis no faith in microscopes, and all is over with the Linnaean\nSociety.\n\nAnd there were the water-babies in thousands, more than Tom, or you\neither, could count.--All the little children whom the good fairies\ntake to, because their cruel mothers and fathers will not; all who\nare untaught and brought up heathens, and all who come to grief by\nill-usage or ignorance or neglect; all the little children who are\noverlaid, or given gin when they are young, or are let to drink out\nof hot kettles, or to fall into the fire; all the little children\nin alleys and courts, and tumble-down cottages, who die by fever,\nand cholera, and measles, and scarlatina, and nasty complaints\nwhich no one has any business to have, and which no one will have\nsome day, when folks have common sense; and all the little children\nwho have been killed by cruel masters and wicked soldiers; they\nwere all there, except, of course, the babes of Bethlehem who were\nkilled by wicked King Herod; for they were taken straight to heaven\nlong ago, as everybody knows, and we call them the Holy Innocents.\n\nBut I wish Tom had given up all his naughty tricks, and left off\ntormenting dumb animals now that he had plenty of playfellows to\namuse him.  Instead of that, I am sorry to say, he would meddle\nwith the creatures, all but the water-snakes, for they would stand\nno nonsense.  So he tickled the madrepores, to make them shut up;\nand frightened the crabs, to make them hide in the sand and peep\nout at him with the tips of their eyes; and put stones into the\nanemones' mouths, to make them fancy that their dinner was coming.\n\nThe other children warned him, and said, \"Take care what you are\nat.  Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid is coming.\"  But Tom never heeded them,\nbeing quite riotous with high spirits and good luck, till, one\nFriday morning early, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid came indeed.\n\nA very tremendous lady she was; and when the children saw her they\nall stood in a row, very upright indeed, and smoothed down their\nbathing dresses, and put their hands behind them, just as if they\nwere going to be examined by the inspector.\n\nAnd she had on a black bonnet, and a black shawl, and no crinoline\nat all; and a pair of large green spectacles, and a great hooked\nnose, hooked so much that the bridge of it stood quite up above her\neyebrows; and under her arm she carried a great birch-rod.  Indeed,\nshe was so ugly that Tom was tempted to make faces at her:  but did\nnot; for he did not admire the look of the birch-rod under her arm.\n\nAnd she looked at the children one by one, and seemed very much\npleased with them, though she never asked them one question about\nhow they were behaving; and then began giving them all sorts of\nnice sea-things--sea-cakes, sea-apples, sea-oranges, sea-bullseyes,\nsea-toffee; and to the very best of all she gave sea-ices, made out\nof sea-cows' cream, which never melt under water.\n\nAnd, if you don't quite believe me, then just think--What is more\ncheap and plentiful than sea-rock?  Then why should there not be\nsea-toffee as well?  And every one can find sea-lemons (ready\nquartered too) if they will look for them at low tide; and sea-\ngrapes too sometimes, hanging in bunches; and, if you will go to\nNice, you will find the fish-market full of sea-fruit, which they\ncall \"frutta di mare:\" though I suppose they call them \"fruits de\nmer\" now, out of compliment to that most successful, and therefore\nmost immaculate, potentate who is seemingly desirous of inheriting\nthe blessing pronounced on those who remove their neighbours' land-\nmark.  And, perhaps, that is the very reason why the place is\ncalled Nice, because there are so many nice things in the sea\nthere:  at least, if it is not, it ought to be.\n\nNow little Tom watched all these sweet things given away, till his\nmouth watered, and his eyes grew as round as an owl's.  For he\nhoped that his turn would come at last; and so it did.  For the\nlady called him up, and held out her fingers with something in\nthem, and popped it into his mouth; and, lo and behold, it was a\nnasty cold hard pebble.\n\n\"You are a very cruel woman,\" said he, and began to whimper.\n\n\"And you are a very cruel boy; who puts pebbles into the sea-\nanemones' mouths, to take them in, and make them fancy that they\nhad caught a good dinner!  As you did to them, so I must do to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\" said Tom.\n\n\"You did yourself, this very minute.\"\n\nTom had never opened his lips; so he was very much taken aback\nindeed.\n\n\"Yes; every one tells me exactly what they have done wrong; and\nthat without knowing it themselves.  So there is no use trying to\nhide anything from me.  Now go, and be a good boy, and I will put\nno more pebbles in your mouth, if you put none in other\ncreatures'.\"\n\n\"I did not know there was any harm in it,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Then you know now.  People continually say that to me:  but I tell\nthem, if you don't know that fire burns, that is no reason that it\nshould not burn you; and if you don't know that dirt breeds fever,\nthat is no reason why the fevers should not kill you.  The lobster\ndid not know that there was any harm in getting into the lobster-\npot; but it caught him all the same.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" thought Tom, \"she knows everything!\"  And so she did,\nindeed.\n\n\"And so, if you do not know that things are wrong that is no reason\nwhy you should not be punished for them; though not as much, not as\nmuch, my little man\" (and the lady looked very kindly, after all),\n\"as if you did know.\"\n\n\"Well, you are a little hard on a poor lad,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Not at all; I am the best friend you ever had in all your life.\nBut I will tell you; I cannot help punishing people when they do\nwrong.  I like it no more than they do; I am often very, very sorry\nfor them, poor things:  but I cannot help it.  If I tried not to do\nit, I should do it all the same.  For I work by machinery, just\nlike an engine; and am full of wheels and springs inside; and am\nwound up very carefully, so that I cannot help going.\"\n\n\"Was it long ago since they wound you up?\" asked Tom.  For he\nthought, the cunning little fellow, \"She will run down some day:\nor they may forget to wind her up, as old Grimes used to forget to\nwind up his watch when he came in from the public-house; and then I\nshall be safe.\"\n\n\"I was wound up once and for all, so long ago, that I forget all\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Tom, \"you must have been made a long time!\"\n\n\"I never was made, my child; and I shall go for ever and ever; for\nI am as old as Eternity, and yet as young as Time.\"\n\nAnd there came over the lady's face a very curious expression--very\nsolemn, and very sad; and yet very, very sweet.  And she looked up\nand away, as if she were gazing through the sea, and through the\nsky, at something far, far off; and as she did so, there came such\na quiet, tender, patient, hopeful smile over her face that Tom\nthought for the moment that she did not look ugly at all.  And no\nmore she did; for she was like a great many people who have not a\npretty feature in their faces, and yet are lovely to behold, and\ndraw little children's hearts to them at once because though the\nhouse is plain enough, yet from the windows a beautiful and good\nspirit is looking forth.\n\nAnd Tom smiled in her face, she looked so pleasant for the moment.\nAnd the strange fairy smiled too, and said:\n\n\"Yes.  You thought me very ugly just now, did you not?\"\n\nTom hung down his head, and got very red about the ears.\n\n\"And I am very ugly.  I am the ugliest fairy in the world; and I\nshall be, till people behave themselves as they ought to do.  And\nthen I shall grow as handsome as my sister, who is the loveliest\nfairy in the world; and her name is Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby.  So\nshe begins where I end, and I begin where she ends; and those who\nwill not listen to her must listen to me, as you will see.  Now,\nall of you run away, except Tom; and he may stay and see what I am\ngoing to do.  It will be a very good warning for him to begin with,\nbefore he goes to school.\n\n\"Now, Tom, every Friday I come down here and call up all who have\nill-used little children and serve them as they served the\nchildren.\"\n\nAnd at that Tom was frightened, and crept under a stone; which made\nthe two crabs who lived there very angry, and frightened their\nfriend the butter-fish into flapping hysterics:  but he would not\nmove for them.\n\nAnd first she called up all the doctors who give little children so\nmuch physic (they were most of them old ones; for the young ones\nhave learnt better, all but a few army surgeons, who still fancy\nthat a baby's inside is much like a Scotch grenadier's), and she\nset them all in a row; and very rueful they looked; for they knew\nwhat was coming.\n\nAnd first she pulled all their teeth out; and then she bled them\nall round:  and then she dosed them with calomel, and jalap, and\nsalts and senna, and brimstone and treacle; and horrible faces they\nmade; and then she gave them a great emetic of mustard and water,\nand no basons; and began all over again; and that was the way she\nspent the morning.\n\nAnd then she called up a whole troop of foolish ladies, who pinch\nup their children's waists and toes; and she laced them all up in\ntight stays, so that they were choked and sick, and their noses\ngrew red, and their hands and feet swelled; and then she crammed\ntheir poor feet into the most dreadfully tight boots, and made them\nall dance, which they did most clumsily indeed; and then she asked\nthem how they liked it; and when they said not at all, she let them\ngo:  because they had only done it out of foolish fashion, fancying\nit was for their children's good, as if wasps' waists and pigs'\ntoes could be pretty, or wholesome, or of any use to anybody.\n\nThen she called up all the careless nurserymaids, and stuck pins\ninto them all over, and wheeled them about in perambulators with\ntight straps across their stomachs and their heads and arms hanging\nover the side, till they were quite sick and stupid, and would have\nhad sun-strokes:  but, being under the water, they could only have\nwater-strokes; which, I assure you, are nearly as bad, as you will\nfind if you try to sit under a mill-wheel.  And mind--when you hear\na rumbling at the bottom of the sea, sailors will tell you that it\nis a ground-swell:  but now you know better.  It is the old lady\nwheeling the maids about in perambulators.\n\nAnd by that time she was so tired, she had to go to luncheon.\n\nAnd after luncheon she set to work again, and called up all the\ncruel schoolmasters--whole regiments and brigades of them; and when\nshe saw them, she frowned most terribly, and set to work in\nearnest, as if the best part of the day's work was to come.  More\nthan half of them were nasty, dirty, frowzy, grubby, smelly old\nmonks, who, because they dare not hit a man of their own size,\namused themselves with beating little children instead; as you may\nsee in the picture of old Pope Gregory (good man and true though he\nwas, when he meddled with things which he did understand), teaching\nchildren to sing their fa-fa-mi-fa with a cat-o'-nine tails under\nhis chair:  but, because they never had any children of their own,\nthey took into their heads (as some folks do still) that they were\nthe only people in the world who knew how to manage children:  and\nthey first brought into England, in the old Anglo-Saxon times, the\nfashion of treating free boys, and girls too, worse than you would\ntreat a dog or a horse:  but Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid has caught them\nall long ago; and given them many a taste of their own rods; and\nmuch good may it do them.\n\nAnd she boxed their ears, and thumped them over the head with\nrulers, and pandied their hands with canes, and told them that they\ntold stories, and were this and that bad sort of people; and the\nmore they were very indignant, and stood upon their honour, and\ndeclared they told the truth, the more she declared they were not,\nand that they were only telling lies; and at last she birched them\nall round soundly with her great birch-rod and set them each an\nimposition of three hundred thousand lines of Hebrew to learn by\nheart before she came back next Friday.  And at that they all cried\nand howled so, that their breaths came all up through the sea like\nbubbles out of soda-water; and that is one reason of the bubbles in\nthe sea.  There are others:  but that is the one which principally\nconcerns little boys.  And by that time she was so tired that she\nwas glad to stop; and, indeed, she had done a very good day's work.\n\nTom did not quite dislike the old lady:  but he could not help\nthinking her a little spiteful--and no wonder if she was, poor old\nsoul; for if she has to wait to grow handsome till people do as\nthey would be done by, she will have to wait a very long time.\n\nPoor old Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid! she has a great deal of hard work\nbefore her, and had better have been born a washerwoman, and stood\nover a tub all day:  but, you see, people cannot always choose\ntheir own profession.\n\nBut Tom longed to ask her one question; and after all, whenever she\nlooked at him, she did not look cross at all; and now and then\nthere was a funny smile in her face, and she chuckled to herself in\na way which gave Tom courage, and at last he said:\n\n\"Pray, ma'am, may I ask you a question?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my little dear.\"\n\n\"Why don't you bring all the bad masters here and serve them out\ntoo?  The butties that knock about the poor collier-boys; and the\nnailers that file off their lads' noses and hammer their fingers;\nand all the master sweeps, like my master Grimes?  I saw him fall\ninto the water long ago; so I surely expected he would have been\nhere.  I'm sure he was bad enough to me.\"\n\nThen the old lady looked so very stern that Tom was quite\nfrightened, and sorry that he had been so bold.  But she was not\nangry with him.  She only answered, \"I look after them all the week\nround; and they are in a very different place from this, because\nthey knew that they were doing wrong.\"\n\nShe spoke very quietly; but there was something in her voice which\nmade Tom tingle from head to foot, as if he had got into a shoal of\nsea-nettles.\n\n\"But these people,\" she went on, \"did not know that they were doing\nwrong:  they were only stupid and impatient; and therefore I only\npunish them till they become patient, and learn to use their common\nsense like reasonable beings.  But as for chimney-sweeps, and\ncollier-boys, and nailer lads, my sister has set good people to\nstop all that sort of thing; and very much obliged to her I am; for\nif she could only stop the cruel masters from ill-using poor\nchildren, I should grow handsome at least a thousand years sooner.\nAnd now do you be a good boy, and do as you would be done by, which\nthey did not; and then, when my sister, MADAME\nDOASYOUWOULDBEDONEBY, comes on Sunday, perhaps she will take notice\nof you, and teach you how to behave.  She understands that better\nthan I do.\"  And so she went.\n\nTom was very glad to hear that there was no chance of meeting\nGrimes again, though he was a little sorry for him, considering\nthat he used sometimes to give him the leavings of the beer:  but\nhe determined to be a very good boy all Saturday; and he was; for\nhe never frightened one crab, nor tickled any live corals, nor put\nstones into the sea anemones' mouths, to make them fancy they had\ngot a dinner; and when Sunday morning came, sure enough, MRS.\nDOASYOUWOULDBEDONEBY came too.  Whereat all the little children\nbegan dancing and clapping their hands, and Tom danced too with all\nhis might.\n\nAnd as for the pretty lady, I cannot tell you what the colour of\nher hair was, or, of her eyes:  no more could Tom; for, when any\none looks at her, all they can think of is, that she has the\nsweetest, kindest, tenderest, funniest, merriest face they ever\nsaw, or want to see.  But Tom saw that she was a very tall woman,\nas tall as her sister:  but instead of being gnarly and horny, and\nscaly, and prickly, like her, she was the most nice, soft, fat,\nsmooth, pussy, cuddly, delicious creature who ever nursed a baby;\nand she understood babies thoroughly, for she had plenty of her\nown, whole rows and regiments of them, and has to this day.  And\nall her delight was, whenever she had a spare moment, to play with\nbabies, in which she showed herself a woman of sense; for babies\nare the best company, and the pleasantest playfellows, in the\nworld; at least, so all the wise people in the world think.  And\ntherefore when the children saw her, they naturally all caught hold\nof her, and pulled her till she sat down on a stone, and climbed\ninto her lap, and clung round her neck, and caught hold of her\nhands; and then they all put their thumbs into their mouths, and\nbegan cuddling and purring like so many kittens, as they ought to\nhave done.  While those who could get nowhere else sat down on the\nsand, and cuddled her feet--for no one, you know, wear shoes in the\nwater, except horrid old bathing-women, who are afraid of the\nwater-babies pinching their horny toes.  And Tom stood staring at\nthem; for he could not understand what it was all about.\n\n\"And who are you, you little darling?\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, that is the new baby!\" they all cried, pulling their thumbs\nout of their mouths; \"and he never had any mother,\" and they all\nput their thumbs back again, for they did not wish to lose any\ntime.\n\n\"Then I will be his mother, and he shall have the very best place;\nso get out, all of you, this moment.\"\n\nAnd she took up two great armfuls of babies--nine hundred under one\narm, and thirteen hundred under the other--and threw them away,\nright and left, into the water.  But they minded it no more than\nthe naughty boys in Struwelpeter minded when St. Nicholas dipped\nthem in his inkstand; and did not even take their thumbs out of\ntheir mouths, but came paddling and wriggling back to her like so\nmany tadpoles, till you could see nothing of her from head to foot\nfor the swarm of little babies.\n\nBut she took Tom in her arms, and laid him in the softest place of\nall, and kissed him, and patted him, and talked to him, tenderly\nand low, such things as he had never heard before in his life; and\nTom looked up into her eyes, and loved her, and loved, till he fell\nfast asleep from pure love.\n\nAnd when he woke she was telling the children a story.  And what\nstory did she tell them?  One story she told them, which begins\nevery Christmas Eve, and yet never ends at all for ever and ever;\nand, as she went on, the children took their thumbs out of their\nmouths and listened quite seriously; but not sadly at all; for she\nnever told them anything sad; and Tom listened too, and never grew\ntired of listening.  And he listened so long that he fell fast\nasleep again, and, when he woke, the lady was nursing him still.\n\n\"Don't go away,\" said little Tom.  \"This is so nice.  I never had\nany one to cuddle me before.\"\n\n\"Don't go away,\" said all the children; \"you have not sung us one\nsong.\"\n\n\"Well, I have time for only one.  So what shall it be?\"\n\n\"The doll you lost!  The doll you lost!\" cried all the babies at\nonce.\n\nSo the strange fairy sang:-\n\n\nI once had a sweet little doll, dears,\nThe prettiest doll in the world;\nHer cheeks were so red and so white, dears,\nAnd her hair was so charmingly curled.\nBut I lost my poor little doll, dears,\nAs I played in the heath one day;\nAnd I cried for her more than a week, dears,\nBut I never could find where she lay.\n\nI found my poor little doll, dears,\nAs I played in the heath one day:\nFolks say she is terribly changed, dears,\nFor her paint is all washed away,\nAnd her arm trodden off by the cows, dears,\nAnd her hair not the least bit curled:\nYet, for old sakes' sake she is still, dears,\nThe prettiest doll in the world.\n\n\nWhat a silly song for a fairy to sing!\n\nAnd what silly water-babies to be quite delighted at it!\n\nWell, but you see they have not the advantage of Aunt Agitate's\nArguments in the sea-land down below.\n\n\"Now,\" said the fairy to Tom, \"will you be a good boy for my sake,\nand torment no more sea-beasts till I come back?\"\n\n\"And you will cuddle me again?\" said poor little Tom.\n\n\"Of course I will, you little duck.  I should like to take you with\nme and cuddle you all the way, only I must not;\" and away she went.\n\nSo Tom really tried to be a good boy, and tormented no sea-beasts\nafter that as long as he lived; and he is quite alive, I assure\nyou, still.\n\nOh, how good little boys ought to be who have kind pussy mammas to\ncuddle them and tell them stories; and how afraid they ought to be\nof growing naughty, and bringing tears into their mammas' pretty\neyes!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\n\n\"Thou little child, yet glorious in the night\nOf heaven-born freedom on thy Being's height,\nWhy with such earnest pains dost thou provoke\nThe Years to bring the inevitable yoke -\nThus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?\nFull soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,\nAnd custom lie upon thee with a weight\nHeavy as frost, and deep almost as life.\"\n\nWORDSWORTH.\n\n\nI come to the very saddest part of all my story.  I know some\npeople will only laugh at it, and call it much ado about nothing.\nBut I know one man who would not; and he was an officer with a pair\nof gray moustaches as long as your arm, who said once in company\nthat two of the most heart-rending sights in the world, which moved\nhim most to tears, which he would do anything to prevent or remedy,\nwere a child over a broken toy and a child stealing sweets.\n\nThe company did not laugh at him; his moustaches were too long and\ntoo gray for that:  but, after he was gone, they called him\nsentimental and so forth, all but one dear little old Quaker lady\nwith a soul as white as her cap, who was not, of course, generally\npartial to soldiers; and she said very quietly, like a Quaker:\n\n\"Friends, it is borne upon my mind that that is a truly brave man.\"\n\nNow you may fancy that Tom was quite good, when he had everything\nthat he could want or wish:  but you would be very much mistaken.\nBeing quite comfortable is a very good thing; but it does not make\npeople good.  Indeed, it sometimes makes them naughty, as it has\nmade the people in America; and as it made the people in the Bible,\nwho waxed fat and kicked, like horses overfed and underworked.  And\nI am very sorry to say that this happened to little Tom.  For he\ngrew so fond of the sea-bullseyes and sea-lollipops that his\nfoolish little head could think of nothing else:  and he was always\nlonging for more, and wondering when the strange lady would come\nagain and give him some, and what she would give him, and how much,\nand whether she would give him more than the others.  And he\nthought of nothing but lollipops by day, and dreamt of nothing else\nby night--and what happened then?\n\nThat he began to watch the lady to see where she kept the sweet\nthings:  and began hiding, and sneaking, and following her about,\nand pretending to be looking the other way, or going after\nsomething else, till he found out that she kept them in a beautiful\nmother-of-pearl cabinet away in a deep crack of the rocks.\n\nAnd he longed to go to the cabinet, and yet he was afraid; and then\nhe longed again, and was less afraid; and at last, by continual\nthinking about it, he longed so violently that he was not afraid at\nall.  And one night, when all the other children were asleep, and\nhe could not sleep for thinking of lollipops, he crept away among\nthe rocks, and got to the cabinet, and behold! it was open.\n\nBut, when he saw all the nice things inside, instead of being\ndelighted, he was quite frightened, and wished he had never come\nthere.  And then he would only touch them, and he did; and then he\nwould only taste one, and he did; and then he would only eat one,\nand he did; and then he would only eat two, and then three, and so\non; and then he was terrified lest she should come and catch him,\nand began gobbling them down so fast that he did not taste them, or\nhave any pleasure in them; and then he felt sick, and would have\nonly one more; and then only one more again; and so on till he had\neaten them all up.\n\nAnd all the while, close behind him, stood Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid.\n\nSome people may say, But why did she not keep her cupboard locked?\nWell, I know.--It may seem a very strange thing, but she never does\nkeep her cupboard locked; every one may go and taste for\nthemselves, and fare accordingly.  It is very odd, but so it is;\nand I am quite sure that she knows best.  Perhaps she wishes people\nto keep their fingers out of the fire, by having them burned.\n\nShe took off her spectacles, because she did not like to see too\nmuch; and in her pity she arched up her eyebrows into her very\nhair, and her eyes grew so wide that they would have taken in all\nthe sorrows of the world, and filled with great big tears, as they\ntoo often do.\n\nBut all she said was:\n\n\"Ah, you poor little dear! you are just like all the rest.\"\n\nBut she said it to herself, and Tom neither heard nor saw her.\nNow, you must not fancy that she was sentimental at all.  If you\ndo, and think that she is going to let off you, or me, or any human\nbeing when we do wrong, because she is too tender-hearted to punish\nus, then you will find yourself very much mistaken, as many a man\ndoes every year and every day.\n\nBut what did the strange fairy do when she saw all her lollipops\neaten?\n\nDid she fly at Tom, catch him by the scruff of the neck, hold him,\nhowk him, hump him, hurry him, hit him, poke him, pull him, pinch\nhim, pound him, put him in the corner, shake him, slap him, set him\non a cold stone to reconsider himself, and so forth?\n\nNot a bit.  You may watch her at work if you know where to find\nher.  But you will never see her do that.  For, if she had, she\nknew quite well Tom would have fought, and kicked, and bit, and\nsaid bad words, and turned again that moment into a naughty little\nheathen chimney-sweep, with his hand, like Ishmael's of old,\nagainst every man, and every man's hand against him.\n\nDid she question him, hurry him, frighten him, threaten him, to\nmake him confess?  Not a bit.  You may see her, as I said, at her\nwork often enough if you know where to look for her:  but you will\nnever see her do that.  For, if she had, she would have tempted him\nto tell lies in his fright; and that would have been worse for him,\nif possible, than even becoming a heathen chimney-sweep again.\n\nNo.  She leaves that for anxious parents and teachers (lazy ones,\nsome call them), who, instead of giving children a fair trial, such\nas they would expect and demand for themselves, force them by\nfright to confess their own faults--which is so cruel and unfair\nthat no judge on the bench dare do it to the wickedest thief or\nmurderer, for the good British law forbids it--ay, and even punish\nthem to make them confess, which is so detestable a crime that it\nis never committed now, save by Inquisitors, and Kings of Naples,\nand a few other wretched people of whom the world is weary.  And\nthen they say, \"We have trained up the child in the way he should\ngo, and when he grew up he has departed from it.  Why then did\nSolomon say that he would not depart from it?\"  But perhaps the way\nof beating, and hurrying and frightening, and questioning, was not\nthe way that the child should go; for it is not even the way in\nwhich a colt should go if you want to break it in and make it a\nquiet serviceable horse.\n\nSome folks may say, \"Ah! but the Fairy does not need to do that if\nshe knows everything already.\"  True.  But, if she did not know,\nshe would not surely behave worse than a British judge and jury;\nand no more should parents and teachers either.\n\nSo she just said nothing at all about the matter, not even when Tom\ncame next day with the rest for sweet things.  He was horribly\nafraid of coming:  but he was still more afraid of staying away,\nlest any one should suspect him.  He was dreadfully afraid, too,\nlest there should be no sweets--as was to be expected, he having\neaten them all--and lest then the fairy should inquire who had\ntaken them.  But, behold! she pulled out just as many as ever,\nwhich astonished Tom, and frightened him still more.\n\nAnd, when the fairy looked him full in the face, he shook from head\nto foot:  however she gave him his share like the rest, and he\nthought within himself that she could not have found him out.\n\nBut, when he put the sweets into his mouth, he hated the taste of\nthem; and they made him so sick that he had to get away as fast as\nhe could; and terribly sick he was, and very cross and unhappy, all\nthe week after.\n\nThen, when next week came, he had his share again; and again the\nfairy looked him full in the face; but more sadly than she had ever\nlooked.  And he could not bear the sweets:  but took them again in\nspite of himself.\n\nAnd when Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby came, he wanted to be cuddled\nlike the rest; but she said very seriously:\n\n\"I should like to cuddle you; but I cannot, you are so horny and\nprickly.\"\n\nAnd Tom looked at himself:  and he was all over prickles, just like\na sea-egg.\n\nWhich was quite natural; for you must know and believe that\npeople's souls make their bodies just as a snail makes its shell (I\nam not joking, my little man; I am in serious, solemn earnest).\nAnd therefore, when Tom's soul grew all prickly with naughty\ntempers, his body could not help growing prickly, too, so that\nnobody would cuddle him, or play with him, or even like to look at\nhim.\n\nWhat could Tom do now but go away and hide in a corner and cry?\nFor nobody would play with him, and he knew full well why.\n\nAnd he was so miserable all that week that when the ugly fairy came\nand looked at him once more full in the face, more seriously and\nsadly than ever, he could stand it no longer, and thrust the\nsweetmeats away, saying, \"No, I don't want any:  I can't bear them\nnow,\" and then burst out crying, poor little man, and told Mrs.\nBedonebyasyoudid every word as it happened.\n\nHe was horribly frightened when he had done so; for he expected her\nto punish him very severely.  But, instead, she only took him up\nand kissed him, which was not quite pleasant, for her chin was very\nbristly indeed; but he was so lonely-hearted, he thought that rough\nkissing was better than none.\n\n\"I will forgive you, little man,\" she said.  \"I always forgive\nevery one the moment they tell me the truth of their own accord.\"\n\n\"Then you will take away all these nasty prickles?\"\n\n\"That is a very different matter.  You put them there yourself, and\nonly you can take them away.\"\n\n\"But how can I do that?\" asked Tom, crying afresh.\n\n\"Well, I think it is time for you to go to school; so I shall fetch\nyou a schoolmistress, who will teach you how to get rid of your\nprickles.\"  And so she went away.\n\nTom was frightened at the notion of a school-mistress; for he\nthought she would certainly come with a birch-rod or a cane; but he\ncomforted himself, at last, that she might be something like the\nold woman in Vendale--which she was not in the least; for, when the\nfairy brought her, she was the most beautiful little girl that ever\nwas seen, with long curls floating behind her like a golden cloud,\nand long robes floating all round her like a silver one.\n\n\"There he is,\" said the fairy; \"and you must teach him to be good,\nwhether you like or not.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said the little girl; but she did not seem quite to like,\nfor she put her finger in her mouth, and looked at Tom under her\nbrows; and Tom put his finger in his mouth, and looked at her under\nhis brows, for he was horribly ashamed of himself.\n\nThe little girl seemed hardly to know how to begin; and perhaps she\nwould never have begun at all if poor Tom had not burst out crying,\nand begged her to teach him to be good and help him to cure his\nprickles; and at that she grew so tender-hearted that she began\nteaching him as prettily as ever child was taught in the world.\n\nAnd what did the little girl teach Tom?  She taught him, first,\nwhat you have been taught ever since you said your first prayers at\nyour mother's knees; but she taught him much more simply.  For the\nlessons in that world, my child, have no such hard words in them as\nthe lessons in this, and therefore the water-babies like them\nbetter than you like your lessons, and long to learn them more and\nmore; and grown men cannot puzzle nor quarrel over their meaning,\nas they do here on land; for those lessons all rise clear and pure,\nlike the Test out of Overton Pool, out of the everlasting ground of\nall life and truth.\n\nSo she taught Tom every day in the week; only on Sundays she always\nwent away home, and the kind fairy took her place.  And before she\nhad taught Tom many Sundays, his prickles had vanished quite away,\nand his skin was smooth and clean again.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the little girl; \"why, I know you now.  You are the\nvery same little chimney-sweep who came into my bedroom.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" cried Tom.  \"And I know you, too, now.  You are the very\nlittle white lady whom I saw in bed.\"  And he jumped at her, and\nlonged to hug and kiss her; but did not, remembering that she was a\nlady born; so he only jumped round and round her till he was quite\ntired.\n\nAnd then they began telling each other all their story--how he had\ngot into the water, and she had fallen over the rock; and how he\nhad swum down to the sea, and how she had flown out of the window;\nand how this, that, and the other, till it was all talked out:  and\nthen they both began over again, and I can't say which of the two\ntalked fastest.\n\nAnd then they set to work at their lessons again, and both liked\nthem so well that they went on well till seven full years were past\nand gone.\n\nYou may fancy that Tom was quite content and happy all those seven\nyears; but the truth is, he was not.  He had always one thing on\nhis mind, and that was--where little Ellie went, when she went home\non Sundays.\n\nTo a very beautiful place, she said.\n\nBut what was the beautiful place like, and where was it?\n\nAh! that is just what she could not say.  And it is strange, but\ntrue, that no one can say; and that those who have been oftenest in\nit, or even nearest to it, can say least about it, and make people\nunderstand least what it is like.  There are a good many folks\nabout the Other-end-of-Nowhere (where Tom went afterwards), who\npretend to know it from north to south as well as if they had been\npenny postmen there; but, as they are safe at the Other-end-of-\nNowhere, nine hundred and ninety-nine million miles away, what they\nsay cannot concern us.\n\nBut the dear, sweet, loving, wise, good, self-sacrificing people,\nwho really go there, can never tell you anything about it, save\nthat it is the most beautiful place in all the world; and, if you\nask them more, they grow modest, and hold their peace, for fear of\nbeing laughed at; and quite right they are.\n\nSo all that good little Ellie could say was, that it was worth all\nthe rest of the world put together.  And of course that only made\nTom the more anxious to go likewise.\n\n\"Miss Ellie,\" he said at last, \"I will know why I cannot go with\nyou when you go home on Sundays, or I shall have no peace, and give\nyou none either.\"\n\n\"You must ask the fairies that.\"\n\nSo when the fairy, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, came next, Tom asked her.\n\n\"Little boys who are only fit to play with sea-beasts cannot go\nthere,\" she said.  \"Those who go there must go first where they do\nnot like, and do what they do not like, and help somebody they do\nnot like.\"\n\n\"Why, did Ellie do that?\"\n\n\"Ask her.\"\n\nAnd Ellie blushed, and said, \"Yes, Tom; I did not like coming here\nat first; I was so much happier at home, where it is always Sunday.\nAnd I was afraid of you, Tom, at first, because--because--\"\n\n\"Because I was all over prickles?  But I am not prickly now, am I,\nMiss Ellie?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ellie.  \"I like you very much now; and I like coming\nhere, too.\"\n\n\"And perhaps,\" said the fairy, \"you will learn to like going where\nyou don't like, and helping some one that you don't like, as Ellie\nhas.\"\n\nBut Tom put his finger in his mouth, and hung his head down; for he\ndid not see that at all.\n\nSo when Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby came, Tom asked her; for he\nthought in his little head, She is not so strict as her sister, and\nperhaps she may let me off more easily.\n\nAh, Tom, Tom, silly fellow! and yet I don't know why I should blame\nyou, while so many grown people have got the very same notion in\ntheir heads.\n\nBut, when they try it, they get just the same answer as Tom did.\nFor, when he asked the second fairy, she told him just what the\nfirst did, and in the very same words.\n\nTom was very unhappy at that.  And, when Ellie went home on Sunday,\nhe fretted and cried all day, and did not care to listen to the\nfairy's stories about good children, though they were prettier than\never.  Indeed, the more he overheard of them, the less he liked to\nlisten, because they were all about children who did what they did\nnot like, and took trouble for other people, and worked to feed\ntheir little brothers and sisters instead of caring only for their\nplay.  And, when she began to tell a story about a holy child in\nold times, who was martyred by the heathen because it would not\nworship idols, Tom could bear no more, and ran away and hid among\nthe rocks.\n\nAnd, when Ellie came back, he was shy with her, because he fancied\nshe looked down on him, and thought him a coward.  And then he grew\nquite cross with her, because she was superior to him, and did what\nhe could not do.  And poor Ellie was quite surprised and sad; and\nat last Tom burst out crying; but he would not tell her what was\nreally in his mind.\n\nAnd all the while he was eaten up with curiosity to know where\nEllie went to; so that he began not to care for his playmates, or\nfor the sea-palace or anything else.  But perhaps that made matters\nall the easier for him; for he grew so discontented with everything\nround him that he did not care to stay, and did not care where he\nwent.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, at last, \"I am so miserable here, I'll go; if only\nyou will go with me?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Ellie, \"I wish I might; but the worst of it is, that the\nfairy says that you must go alone if you go at all.  Now don't poke\nthat poor crab about, Tom\" (for he was feeling very naughty and\nmischievous), \"or the fairy will have to punish you.\"\n\nTom was very nearly saying, \"I don't care if she does;\" but he\nstopped himself in time.\n\n\"I know what she wants me to do,\" he said, whining most dolefully.\n\"She wants me to go after that horrid old Grimes.  I don't like\nhim, that's certain.  And if I find him, he will turn me into a\nchimney-sweep again, I know.  That's what I have been afraid of all\nalong.\"\n\n\"No, he won't--I know as much as that.  Nobody can turn water-\nbabies into sweeps, or hurt them at all, as long as they are good.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said naughty Tom, \"I see what you want; you are persuading me\nall along to go, because you are tired of me, and want to get rid\nof me.\"\n\nLittle Ellie opened her eyes very wide at that, and they were all\nbrimming over with tears.\n\n\"Oh, Tom, Tom!\" she said, very mournfully--and then she cried, \"Oh,\nTom! where are you?\"\n\nAnd Tom cried, \"Oh, Ellie, where are you?\"\n\nFor neither of them could see each other--not the least.  Little\nEllie vanished quite away, and Tom heard her voice calling him, and\ngrowing smaller and smaller, and fainter and fainter, till all was\nsilent.\n\nWho was frightened then but Tom?  He swam up and down among the\nrocks, into all the halls and chambers, faster than ever he swam\nbefore, but could not find her.  He shouted after her, but she did\nnot answer; he asked all the other children, but they had not seen\nher; and at last he went up to the top of the water and began\ncrying and screaming for Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid--which perhaps was\nthe best thing to do--for she came in a moment.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tom.  \"Oh dear, oh dear!  I have been naughty to Ellie,\nand I have killed her--I know I have killed her.\"\n\n\"Not quite that,\" said the fairy; \"but I have sent her away home,\nand she will not come back again for I do not know how long.\"\n\nAnd at that Tom cried so bitterly that the salt sea was swelled\nwith his tears, and the tide was .3,954,620,819 of an inch higher\nthan it had been the day before:  but perhaps that was owing to the\nwaxing of the moon.  It may have been so; but it is considered\nright in the new philosophy, you know, to give spiritual causes for\nphysical phenomena--especially in parlour-tables; and, of course,\nphysical causes for spiritual ones, like thinking, and praying, and\nknowing right from wrong.  And so they odds it till it comes even,\nas folks say down in Berkshire.\n\n\"How cruel of you to send Ellie away!\" sobbed Tom.  \"However, I\nwill find her again, if I go to the world's end to look for her.\"\n\nThe fairy did not slap Tom, and tell him to hold his tongue:  but\nshe took him on her lap very kindly, just as her sister would have\ndone; and put him in mind how it was not her fault, because she was\nwound up inside, like watches, and could not help doing things\nwhether she liked or not.  And then she told him how he had been in\nthe nursery long enough, and must go out now and see the world, if\nhe intended ever to be a man; and how he must go all alone by\nhimself, as every one else that ever was born has to go, and see\nwith his own eyes, and smell with his own nose, and make his own\nbed and lie on it, and burn his own fingers if he put them into the\nfire.  And then she told him how many fine things there were to be\nseen in the world, and what an odd, curious, pleasant, orderly,\nrespectable, well-managed, and, on the whole, successful (as,\nindeed, might have been expected) sort of a place it was, if people\nwould only be tolerably brave and honest and good in it; and then\nshe told him not to be afraid of anything he met, for nothing would\nharm him if he remembered all his lessons, and did what he knew was\nright.  And at last she comforted poor little Tom so much that he\nwas quite eager to go, and wanted to set out that minute.  \"Only,\"\nhe said, \"if I might see Ellie once before I went!\"\n\n\"Why do you want that?\"\n\n\"Because--because I should be so much happier if I thought she had\nforgiven me.\"\n\nAnd in the twinkling of an eye there stood Ellie, smiling, and\nlooking so happy that Tom longed to kiss her; but was still afraid\nit would not be respectful, because she was a lady born.\n\n\"I am going, Ellie!\" said Tom.  \"I am going, if it is to the\nworld's end.  But I don't like going at all, and that's the truth.\"\n\n\"Pooh! pooh! pooh!\" said the fairy.  \"You will like it very well\nindeed, you little rogue, and you know that at the bottom of your\nheart.  But if you don't, I will make you like it.  Come here, and\nsee what happens to people who do only what is pleasant.\"\n\nAnd she took out of one of her cupboards (she had all sorts of\nmysterious cupboards in the cracks of the rocks) the most wonderful\nwaterproof book, full of such photographs as never were seen.  For\nshe had found out photography (and this is a fact) more than\n13,598,000 years before anybody was born; and, what is more, her\nphotographs did not merely represent light and shade, as ours do,\nbut colour also, and all colours, as you may see if you look at a\nblack-cock's tail, or a butterfly's wing, or indeed most things\nthat are or can be, so to speak.  And therefore her photographs\nwere very curious and famous, and the children looked with great\ndelight for the opening of the book.\n\nAnd on the title-page was written, \"The History of the great and\nfamous nation of the Doasyoulikes, who came away from the country\nof Hardwork, because they wanted to play on the Jews' harp all day\nlong.\"\n\nIn the first picture they saw these Doasyoulikes living in the land\nof Readymade, at the foot of the Happy-go-lucky Mountains, where\nflapdoodle grows wild; and if you want to know what that is, you\nmust read Peter Simple.\n\nThey lived very much such a life as those jolly old Greeks in\nSicily, whom you may see painted on the ancient vases, and really\nthere seemed to be great excuses for them, for they had no need to\nwork.\n\nInstead of houses they lived in the beautiful caves of tufa, and\nbathed in the warm springs three times a day; and, as for clothes,\nit was so warm there that the gentlemen walked about in little\nbeside a cocked hat and a pair of straps, or some light summer\ntackle of that kind; and the ladies all gathered gossamer in autumn\n(when they were not too lazy) to make their winter dresses.\n\nThey were very fond of music, but it was too much trouble to learn\nthe piano or the violin; and as for dancing, that would have been\ntoo great an exertion.  So they sat on ant-hills all day long, and\nplayed on the Jews' harp; and, if the ants bit them, why they just\ngot up and went to the next ant-hill, till they were bitten there\nlikewise.\n\nAnd they sat under the flapdoodle-trees, and let the flapdoodle\ndrop into their mouths; and under the vines, and squeezed the\ngrape-juice down their throats; and, if any little pigs ran about\nready roasted, crying, \"Come and eat me,\" as was their fashion in\nthat country, they waited till the pigs ran against their mouths,\nand then took a bite, and were content, just as so many oysters\nwould have been.\n\nThey needed no weapons, for no enemies ever came near their land;\nand no tools, for everything was readymade to their hand; and the\nstern old fairy Necessity never came near them to hunt them up, and\nmake them use their wits, or die.\n\nAnd so on, and so on, and so on, till there were never such\ncomfortable, easy-going, happy-go-lucky people in the world.\n\n\"Well, that is a jolly life,\" said Tom.\n\n\"You think so?\" said the fairy.  \"Do you see that great peaked\nmountain there behind,\" said the fairy, \"with smoke coming out of\nits top?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And do you see all those ashes, and slag, and cinders lying\nabout?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then turn over the next five hundred years, and you will see what\nhappens next.\"\n\nAnd behold the mountain had blown up like a barrel of gunpowder,\nand then boiled over like a kettle; whereby one-third of the\nDoasyoulikes were blown into the air, and another third were\nsmothered in ashes; so that there was only one-third left.\n\n\"You see,\" said the fairy, \"what comes of living on a burning\nmountain.\"\n\n\"Oh, why did you not warn them?\" said little Ellie.\n\n\"I did warn them all that I could.  I let the smoke come out of the\nmountain; and wherever there is smoke there is fire.  And I laid\nthe ashes and cinders all about; and wherever there are cinders,\ncinders may be again.  But they did not like to face facts, my\ndears, as very few people do; and so they invented a cock-and-bull\nstory, which, I am sure, I never told them, that the smoke was the\nbreath of a giant, whom some gods or other had buried under the\nmountain; and that the cinders were what the dwarfs roasted the\nlittle pigs whole with; and other nonsense of that kind.  And, when\nfolks are in that humour, I cannot teach them, save by the good old\nbirch-rod.\"\n\nAnd then she turned over the next five hundred years:  and there\nwere the remnant of the Doasyoulikes, doing as they liked, as\nbefore.  They were too lazy to move away from the mountain; so they\nsaid, If it has blown up once, that is all the more reason that it\nshould not blow up again.  And they were few in number:  but they\nonly said, The more the merrier, but the fewer the better fare.\nHowever, that was not quite true; for all the flapdoodle-trees were\nkilled by the volcano, and they had eaten all the roast pigs, who,\nof course, could not be expected to have little ones.  So they had\nto live very hard, on nuts and roots which they scratched out of\nthe ground with sticks.  Some of them talked of sowing corn, as\ntheir ancestors used to do, before they came into the land of\nReadymade; but they had forgotten how to make ploughs (they had\nforgotten even how to make Jews' harps by this time), and had eaten\nall the seed-corn which they brought out of the land of Hardwork\nyears since; and of course it was too much trouble to go away and\nfind more.  So they lived miserably on roots and nuts, and all the\nweakly little children had great stomachs, and then died.\n\n\"Why,\" said Tom, \"they are growing no better than savages.\"\n\n\"And look how ugly they are all getting,\" said Ellie.\n\n\"Yes; when people live on poor vegetables instead of roast beef and\nplum-pudding, their jaws grow large, and their lips grow coarse,\nlike the poor Paddies who eat potatoes.\"\n\nAnd she turned over the next five hundred years.  And there they\nwere all living up in trees, and making nests to keep off the rain.\nAnd underneath the trees lions were prowling about.\n\n\"Why,\" said Ellie, \"the lions seem to have eaten a good many of\nthem, for there are very few left now.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the fairy; \"you see it was only the strongest and most\nactive ones who could climb the trees, and so escape.\"\n\n\"But what great, hulking, broad-shouldered chaps they are,\" said\nTom; \"they are a rough lot as ever I saw.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are getting very strong now; for the ladies will not\nmarry any but the very strongest and fiercest gentlemen, who can\nhelp them up the trees out of the lions' way.\"\n\nAnd she turned over the next five hundred years.  And in that they\nwere fewer still, and stronger, and fiercer; but their feet had\nchanged shape very oddly, for they laid hold of the branches with\ntheir great toes, as if they had been thumbs, just as a Hindoo\ntailor uses his toes to thread his needle.\n\nThe children were very much surprised, and asked the fairy whether\nthat was her doing.\n\n\"Yes, and no,\" she said, smiling.  \"It was only those who could use\ntheir feet as well as their hands who could get a good living:  or,\nindeed, get married; so that they got the best of everything, and\nstarved out all the rest; and those who are left keep up a regular\nbreed of toe-thumb-men, as a breed of short-horns, or are skye-\nterriers, or fancy pigeons is kept up.\"\n\n\"But there is a hairy one among them,\" said Ellie.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the fairy, \"that will be a great man in his time, and\nchief of all the tribe.\"\n\nAnd, when she turned over the next five hundred years, it was true.\n\nFor this hairy chief had had hairy children, and they hairier\nchildren still; and every one wished to marry hairy husbands, and\nhave hairy children too; for the climate was growing so damp that\nnone but the hairy ones could live:  all the rest coughed and\nsneezed, and had sore throats, and went into consumptions, before\nthey could grow up to be men and women.\n\nThen the fairy turned over the next five hundred years.  And they\nwere fewer still.\n\n\"Why, there is one on the ground picking up roots,\" said Ellie,\n\"and he cannot walk upright.\"\n\nNo more he could; for in the same way that the shape of their feet\nhad altered, the shape of their backs had altered also.\n\n\"Why,\" cried Tom, \"I declare they are all apes.\"\n\n\"Something fearfully like it, poor foolish creatures,\" said the\nfairy.  \"They are grown so stupid now, that they can hardly think:\nfor none of them have used their wits for many hundred years.  They\nhave almost forgotten, too, how to talk.  For each stupid child\nforgot some of the words it heard from its stupid parents, and had\nnot wits enough to make fresh words for itself.  Beside, they are\ngrown so fierce and suspicious and brutal that they keep out of\neach other's way, and mope and sulk in the dark forests, never\nhearing each other's voice, till they have forgotten almost what\nspeech is like.  I am afraid they will all be apes very soon, and\nall by doing only what they liked.\"\n\nAnd in the next five hundred years they were all dead and gone, by\nbad food and wild beasts and hunters; all except one tremendous old\nfellow with jaws like a jack, who stood full seven feet high; and\nM. Du Chaillu came up to him, and shot him, as he stood roaring and\nthumping his breast.  And he remembered that his ancestors had once\nbeen men, and tried to say, \"Am I not a man and a brother?\" but had\nforgotten how to use his tongue; and then he had tried to call for\na doctor, but he had forgotten the word for one.  So all he said\nwas \"Ubboboo!\" and died.\n\nAnd that was the end of the great and jolly nation of the\nDoasyoulikes.  And, when Tom and Ellie came to the end of the book,\nthey looked very sad and solemn; and they had good reason so to do,\nfor they really fancied that the men were apes, and never thought,\nin their simplicity, of asking whether the creatures had\nhippopotamus majors in their brains or not; in which case, as you\nhave been told already, they could not possibly have been apes,\nthough they were more apish than the apes of all aperies.\n\n\"But could you not have saved them from becoming apes?\" said little\nEllie, at last.\n\n\"At first, my dear; if only they would have behaved like men, and\nset to work to do what they did not like.  But the longer they\nwaited, and behaved like the dumb beasts, who only do what they\nlike, the stupider and clumsier they grew; till at last they were\npast all cure, for they had thrown their own wits away.  It is such\nthings as this that help to make me so ugly, that I know not when I\nshall grow fair.\"\n\n\"And where are they all now?\" asked Ellie.\n\n\"Exactly where they ought to be, my dear.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said the fairy, solemnly, half to herself, as she closed the\nwonderful book.  \"Folks say now that I can make beasts into men, by\ncircumstance, and selection, and competition, and so forth.  Well,\nperhaps they are right; and perhaps, again, they are wrong.  That\nis one of the seven things which I am forbidden to tell, till the\ncoming of the Cocqcigrues; and, at all events, it is no concern of\ntheirs.  Whatever their ancestors were, men they are; and I advise\nthem to behave as such, and act accordingly.  But let them\nrecollect this, that there are two sides to every question, and a\ndownhill as well as an uphill road; and, if I can turn beasts into\nmen, I can, by the same laws of circumstance, and selection, and\ncompetition, turn men into beasts.  You were very near being turned\ninto a beast once or twice, little Tom.  Indeed, if you had not\nmade up your mind to go on this journey, and see the world, like an\nEnglishman, I am not sure but that you would have ended as an eft\nin a pond.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said Tom; \"sooner than that, and be all over slime,\nI'll go this minute, if it is to the world's end.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n\n\"And Nature, the old Nurse, took\nThe child upon her knee,\nSaying, 'Here is a story book\nThy father hath written for thee.\n\n\"'Come wander with me,' she said,\n'Into regions yet untrod,\nAnd read what is still unread\nIn the Manuscripts of God.'\n\n\"And he wandered away and away\nWith Nature, the dear old Nurse,\nWho sang to him night and day\nThe rhymes of the universe.\"\n\nLONGFELLOW.\n\n\n\"Now,\" said Tom, \"I am ready be off, if it's to the world's end.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the fairy, \"that is a brave, good boy.  But you must go\nfarther than the world's end, if you want to find Mr. Grimes; for\nhe is at the Other-end-of-Nowhere.  You must go to Shiny Wall, and\nthrough the white gate that never was opened; and then you will\ncome to Peacepool, and Mother Carey's Haven, where the good whales\ngo when they die.  And there Mother Carey will tell you the way to\nthe Other-end-of-Nowhere, and there you will find Mr. Grimes.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" said Tom.  \"But I do not know my way to Shiny Wall, or\nwhere it is at all.\"\n\n\"Little boys must take the trouble to find out things for\nthemselves, or they will never grow to be men; so that you must ask\nall the beasts in the sea and the birds in the air, and if you have\nbeen good to them, some of them will tell you the way to Shiny\nWall.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tom, \"it will be a long journey, so I had better start\nat once.  Good-bye, Miss Ellie; you know I am getting a big boy,\nand I must go out and see the world.\"\n\n\"I know you must,\" said Ellie; \"but you will not forget me, Tom.  I\nshall wait here till you come.\"\n\nAnd she shook hands with him, and bade him good-bye.  Tom longed\nvery much again to kiss her; but he thought it would not be\nrespectful, considering she was a lady born; so he promised not to\nforget her:  but his little whirl-about of a head was so full of\nthe notion of going out to see the world, that it forgot her in\nfive minutes:  however, though his head forgot her, I am glad to\nsay his heart did not.\n\nSo he asked all the beasts in the sea, and all the birds in the\nair, but none of them knew the way to Shiny Wall.  For why?  He was\nstill too far down south.\n\nThen he met a ship, far larger than he had ever seen--a gallant\nocean-steamer, with a long cloud of smoke trailing behind; and he\nwondered how she went on without sails, and swam up to her to see.\nA school of dolphins were running races round and round her, going\nthree feet for her one, and Tom asked them the way to Shiny Wall:\nbut they did not know.  Then he tried to find out how she moved,\nand at last he saw her screw, and was so delighted with it that he\nplayed under her quarter all day, till he nearly had his nose\nknocked off by the fans, and thought it time to move.  Then he\nwatched the sailors upon deck, and the ladies, with their bonnets\nand parasols:  but none of them could see him, because their eyes\nwere not opened,--as, indeed, most people's eyes are not.\n\nAt last there came out into the quarter-gallery a very pretty lady,\nin deep black widow's weeds, and in her arms a baby.  She leaned\nover the quarter-gallery, and looked back and back toward England\nfar away; and as she looked she sang:\n\n\nI.\n\n\"Soft soft wind, from out the sweet south sliding,\nWaft thy silver cloud-webs athwart the summer sea;\nThin thin threads of mist on dewy fingers twining\nWeave a veil of dappled gauze to shade my babe and me.\n\nII.\n\n\"Deep deep Love, within thine own abyss abiding,\nPour Thyself abroad, O Lord, on earth and air and sea;\nWorn weary hearts within Thy holy temple hiding,\nShield from sorrow, sin, and shame my helpless babe and me.\"\n\n\nHer voice was so soft and low, and the music of the air so sweet,\nthat Tom could have listened to it all day.  But as she held the\nbaby over the gallery rail, to show it the dolphins leaping and the\nwater gurgling in the ship's wake, lo! and behold, the baby saw\nTom.\n\nHe was quite sure of that for when their eyes met, the baby smiled\nand held out his hands; and Tom smiled and held out his hands too;\nand the baby kicked and leaped, as if it wanted to jump overboard\nto him.\n\n\"What do you see, my darling?\" said the lady; and her eyes followed\nthe baby's till she too caught sight of Tom, swimming about among\nthe foam-beads below.\n\nShe gave a little shriek and start; and then she said, quite\nquietly, \"Babies in the sea?  Well, perhaps it is the happiest\nplace for them;\" and waved her hand to Tom, and cried, \"Wait a\nlittle, darling, only a little:  and perhaps we shall go with you\nand be at rest.\"\n\nAnd at that an old nurse, all in black, came out and talked to her,\nand drew her in.  And Tom turned away northward, sad and wondering;\nand watched the great steamer slide away into the dusk, and the\nlights on board peep out one by one, and die out again, and the\nlong bar of smoke fade away into the evening mist, till all was out\nof sight.\n\nAnd he swam northward again, day after day, till at last he met the\nKing of the Herrings, with a curry-comb growing out of his nose,\nand a sprat in his mouth for a cigar, and asked him the way to\nShiny Wall; so he bolted his sprat head foremost, and said:\n\n\"If I were you, young Gentleman, I should go to the Allalonestone,\nand ask the last of the Gairfowl.  She is of a very ancient clan,\nvery nearly as ancient as my own; and knows a good deal which these\nmodern upstarts don't, as ladies of old houses are likely to do.\"\n\nTom asked his way to her, and the King of the Herrings told him\nvery kindly, for he was a courteous old gentleman of the old\nschool, though he was horribly ugly, and strangely bedizened too,\nlike the old dandies who lounge in the club-house windows.\n\nBut just as Tom had thanked him and set off, he called after him:\n\"Hi!  I say, can you fly?\"\n\n\"I never tried,\" says Tom.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because, if you can, I should advise you to say nothing to the old\nlady about it.  There; take a hint.  Good-bye.\"\n\nAnd away Tom went for seven days and seven nights due north-west,\ntill he came to a great codbank, the like of which he never saw\nbefore.  The great cod lay below in tens of thousands, and gobbled\nshell-fish all day long; and the blue sharks roved above in\nhundreds, and gobbled them when they came up.  So they ate, and\nate, and ate each other, as they had done since the making of the\nworld; for no man had come here yet to catch them, and find out how\nrich old Mother Carey is.\n\nAnd there he saw the last of the Gairfowl, standing up on the\nAllalonestones all alone.  And a very grand old lady she was, full\nthree feet high, and bolt upright, like some old Highland\nchieftainess.  She had on a black velvet gown, and a white pinner\nand apron, and a very high bridge to her nose (which is a sure mark\nof high breeding), and a large pair of white spectacles on it,\nwhich made her look rather odd:  but it was the ancient fashion of\nher house.\n\nAnd instead of wings, she had two little feathery arms, with which\nshe fanned herself, and complained of the dreadful heat; and she\nkept on crooning an old song to herself, which she learnt when she\nwas a little baby-bird, long ago -\n\n\n\"Two little birds they sat on a stone,\nOne swam away, and then there was one,\nWith a fal-lal-la-lady.\n\n\"The other swam after, and then there was none,\nAnd so the poor stone was left all alone;\nWith a fal-lal-la-lady.\"\n\n\nIt was \"flew\" away, properly, and not \"swam\" away:  but, as she\ncould not fly, she had a right to alter it.  However, it was a very\nfit song for her to sing, because she was a lady herself.\n\nTom came up to her very humbly, and made his bow; and the first\nthing she said was -\n\n\"Have you wings?  Can you fly?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no, ma'am; I should not think of such thing,\" said\ncunning little Tom.\n\n\"Then I shall have great pleasure in talking to you, my dear.  It\nis quite refreshing nowadays to see anything without wings.  They\nmust all have wings, forsooth, now, every new upstart sort of bird,\nand fly.  What can they want with flying, and raising themselves\nabove their proper station in life?  In the days of my ancestors no\nbirds ever thought of having wings, and did very well without; and\nnow they all laugh at me because I keep to the good old fashion.\nWhy, the very marrocks and dovekies have got wings, the vulgar\ncreatures, and poor little ones enough they are; and my own cousins\ntoo, the razor-bills, who are gentlefolk born, and ought to know\nbetter than to ape their inferiors.\"\n\nAnd so she was running on, while Tom tried to get in a word\nedgeways; and at last he did, when the old lady got out of breath,\nand began fanning herself again; and then he asked if she knew the\nway to Shiny Wall.\n\n\"Shiny Wall?  Who should know better than I?  We all came from\nShiny Wall, thousands of years ago, when it was decently cold, and\nthe climate was fit for gentlefolk; but now, what with the heat,\nand what with these vulgar-winged things who fly up and down and\neat everything, so that gentlepeople's hunting is all spoilt, and\none really cannot get one's living, or hardly venture off the rock\nfor fear of being flown against by some creature that would not\nhave dared to come within a mile of one a thousand years ago--what\nwas I saying?  Why, we have quite gone down in the world, my dear,\nand have nothing left but our honour.  And I am the last of my\nfamily.  A friend of mine and I came and settled on this rock when\nwe were young, to be out of the way of low people.  Once we were a\ngreat nation, and spread over all the Northern Isles.  But men shot\nus so, and knocked us on the head, and took our eggs--why, if you\nwill believe it, they say that on the coast of Labrador the sailors\nused to lay a plank from the rock on board the thing called their\nship, and drive us along the plank by hundreds, till we tumbled\ndown into the ship's waist in heaps; and then, I suppose, they ate\nus, the nasty fellows!  Well--but--what was I saying?  At last,\nthere were none of us left, except on the old Gairfowlskerry, just\noff the Iceland coast, up which no man could climb.  Even there we\nhad no peace; for one day, when I was quite a young girl, the land\nrocked, and the sea boiled, and the sky grew dark, and all the air\nwas filled with smoke and dust, and down tumbled the old\nGairfowlskerry into the sea.  The dovekies and marrocks, of course,\nall flew away; but we were too proud to do that.  Some of us were\ndashed to pieces, and some drowned; and those who were left got\naway to Eldey, and the dovekies tell me they are all dead now, and\nthat another Gairfowlskerry has risen out of the sea close to the\nold one, but that it is such a poor flat place that it is not safe\nto live on:  and so here I am left alone.\"\n\nThis was the Gairfowl's story, and, strange as it may seem, it is\nevery word of it true.\n\n\"If you only had had wings!\" said Tom; \"then you might all have\nflown away too.\"\n\n\"Yes, young gentleman:  and if people are not gentleman and ladies,\nand forget that noblesse oblige, they will find it as easy to get\non in the world as other people who don't care what they do.  Why,\nif I had not recollected that noblesse oblige, I should not have\nbeen all alone now.\"  And the poor old lady sighed.\n\n\"How was that, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Why, my dear, a gentleman came hither with me, and after we had\nbeen here some time, he wanted to marry--in fact, he actually\nproposed to me.  Well, I can't blame him; I was young, and very\nhandsome then, I don't deny:  but you see, I could not hear of such\na thing, because he was my deceased sister's husband, you see?\"\n\n\"Of course not, ma'am,\" said Tom; though, of course, he knew\nnothing about it.  \"She was very much diseased, I suppose?\"\n\n\"You do not understand me, my dear.  I mean, that being a lady, and\nwith right and honourable feelings, as our house always has had, I\nfelt it my duty to snub him, and howk him, and peck him\ncontinually, to keep him at his proper distance; and, to tell the\ntruth, I once pecked him a little too hard, poor fellow, and he\ntumbled backwards off the rock, and--really, it was very\nunfortunate, but it was not my fault--a shark coming by saw him\nflapping, and snapped him up. And since then I have lived all alone\n-\n\n\n'With a fal-lal-la-lady.'\n\n\nAnd soon I shall be gone, my little dear, and nobody will miss me;\nand then the poor stone will be left all alone.\"\n\n\"But, please, which is the way to Shiny Wall?\" said Tom.\n\n\"Oh, you must go, my little dear--you must go.  Let me see--I am\nsure--that is--really, my poor old brains are getting quite\npuzzled.  Do you know, my little dear, I am afraid, if you want to\nknow, you must ask some of these vulgar birds about, for I have\nquite forgotten.\"\n\nAnd the poor old Gairfowl began to cry tears of pure oil; and Tom\nwas quite sorry for her; and for himself too, for he was at his\nwit's end whom to ask.\n\nBut by there came a flock of petrels, who are Mother Carey's own\nchickens; and Tom thought them much prettier than Lady Gairfowl,\nand so perhaps they were; for Mother Carey had had a great deal of\nfresh experience between the time that she invented the Gairfowl\nand the time that she invented them.  They flitted along like a\nflock of black swallows, and hopped and skipped from wave to wave,\nlifting up their little feet behind them so daintily, and whistling\nto each other so tenderly, that Tom fell in love with them at once,\nand called them to know the way to Shiny Wall.\n\n\"Shiny Wall?  Do you want Shiny Wall?  Then come with us, and we\nwill show you.  We are Mother Carey's own chickens, and she sends\nus out over all the seas, to show the good birds the way home.\"\n\nTom was delighted, and swam off to them, after he had made his bow\nto the Gairfowl.  But she would not return his bow:  but held\nherself bolt upright, and wept tears of oil as she sang:\n\n\n\"And so the poor stone was left all alone;\nWith a fal-lal-la-lady.\"\n\n\nBut she was wrong there; for the stone was not left all alone:  and\nthe next time that Tom goes by it, he will see a sight worth\nseeing.\n\nThe old Gairfowl is gone already:  but there are better things come\nin her place; and when Tom comes he will see the fishing-smacks\nanchored there in hundreds, from Scotland, and from Ireland, and\nfrom the Orkneys, and the Shetlands, and from all the Northern\nports, full of the children of the old Norse Vikings, the masters\nof the sea.  And the men will be hauling in the great cod by\nthousands, till their hands are sore from the lines; and they will\nbe making cod-liver oil and guano, and salting down the fish; and\nthere will be a man-of-war steamer there to protect them, and a\nlighthouse to show them the way; and you and I, perhaps, shall go\nsome day to the Allalonestone to the great summer sea-fair, and\ndredge strange creatures such as man never saw before; and we shall\nhear the sailors boast that it is not the worst jewel in Queen\nVictoria's crown, for there are eighty miles of codbank, and food\nfor all the poor folk in the land.  That is what Tom will see, and\nperhaps you and I shall see it too.  And then we shall not be sorry\nbecause we cannot get a Gairfowl to stuff, much less find gairfowl\nenough to drive them into stone pens and slaughter them, as the old\nNorsemen did, or drive them on board along a plank till the ship\nwas victualled with them, as the old English and French rovers used\nto do, of whom dear old Hakluyt tells:  but we shall remember what\nMr. Tennyson says:  how\n\n\n\"The old order changeth, giving place to the new,\nAnd God fulfils himself in many ways.\"\n\n\nAnd now Tom was all agog to start for Shiny Wall; but the petrels\nsaid no.  They must go first to Allfowlsness, and wait there for\nthe great gathering of all the sea-birds, before they start for\ntheir summer breeding-places far away in the Northern Isles; and\nthere they would be sure to find some birds which were going to\nShiny Wall:  but where Allfowlsness was, he must promise never to\ntell, lest men should go there and shoot the birds, and stuff them,\nand put them into stupid museums, instead of leaving them to play\nand breed and work in Mother Carey's water-garden, where they ought\nto be.\n\nSo where Allfowlsness is nobody must know; and all that is to be\nsaid about it is, that Tom waited there many days; and as he\nwaited, he saw a very curious sight.  On the rabbit burrows on the\nshore there gathered hundreds and hundreds of hoodie-crows, such as\nyou see in Cambridgeshire.  And they made such a noise, that Tom\ncame on shore and went up to see what was the matter.\n\nAnd there he found them holding their great caucus, which they hold\nevery year in the North; and all their stump-orators were\nspeechifying; and for a tribune, the speaker stood on an old\nsheep's skull.\n\nAnd they cawed and cawed, and boasted of all the clever things they\nhad done; how many lambs' eyes they had picked out, and how many\ndead bullocks they had eaten, and how many young grouse they had\nswallowed whole, and how many grouse-eggs they had flown away with,\nstuck on the point of their bills, which is the hoodie-crow's\nparticularly clever feat, of which he is as proud as a gipsy is of\ndoing the hokany-baro; and what that is, I won't tell you.\n\nAnd at last they brought out the prettiest, neatest young lady-crow\nthat ever was seen, and set her in the middle, and all began\nabusing and vilifying, and rating, and bullyragging at her, because\nshe had stolen no grouse-eggs, and had actually dared to say that\nshe would not steal any.  So she was to be tried publicly by their\nlaws (for the hoodies always try some offenders in their great\nyearly parliament).  And there she stood in the middle, in her\nblack gown and gray hood, looking as meek and as neat as a\nQuakeress, and they all bawled at her at once -\n\nAnd it was in vain that she pleaded -\n\n\nThat she did not like grouse-eggs;\nThat she could get her living very well without them;\nThat she was afraid to eat them, for fear of the gamekeepers;\nThat she had not the heart to eat them, because the grouse were\nsuch pretty, kind, jolly birds;\nAnd a dozen reasons more.\n\n\nFor all the other scaul-crows set upon her, and pecked her to death\nthere and then, before Tom could come to help her; and then flew\naway, very proud of what they had done.\n\nNow, was not this a scandalous transaction?\n\nBut they are true republicans, these hoodies, who do every one just\nwhat he likes, and make other people do so too; so that, for any\nfreedom of speech, thought, or action, which is allowed among them,\nthey might as well be American citizens of the new school.\n\nBut the fairies took the good crow, and gave her nine new sets of\nfeathers running, and turned her at last into the most beautiful\nbird of paradise with a green velvet suit and a long tail, and sent\nher to eat fruit in the Spice Islands, where cloves and nutmegs\ngrow.\n\nAnd Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid settled her account with the wicked\nhoodies.  For, as they flew away, what should they find but a nasty\ndead dog?--on which they all set to work, peeking and gobbling and\ncawing and quarrelling to their hearts' content.  But the moment\nafterwards, they all threw up their bills into the air, and gave\none screech; and then turned head over heels backward, and fell\ndown dead, one hundred and twenty-three of them at once.  For why?\nThe fairy had told the gamekeeper in a dream, to fill the dead dog\nfull of strychnine; and so he did.\n\nAnd after a while the birds began to gather at Allfowlsness, in\nthousands and tens of thousands, blackening all the air; swans and\nbrant geese, harlequins and eiders, harolds and garganeys, smews\nand goosanders, divers and loons, grebes and dovekies, auks and\nrazor-bills, gannets and petrels, skuas and terns, with gulls\nbeyond all naming or numbering; and they paddled and washed and\nsplashed and combed and brushed themselves on the sand, till the\nshore was white with feathers; and they quacked and clucked and\ngabbled and chattered and screamed and whooped as they talked over\nmatters with their friends, and settled where they were to go and\nbreed that summer, till you might have heard them ten miles off;\nand lucky it was for them that there was no one to hear them but\nthe old keeper, who lived all alone upon the Ness, in a turf hut\nthatched with heather and fringed round with great stones slung\nacross the roof by bent-ropes, lest the winter gales should blow\nthe hut right away.  But he never minded the birds nor hurt them,\nbecause they were not in season; indeed, he minded but two things\nin the whole world, and those were, his Bible and his grouse; for\nhe was as good an old Scotchman as ever knit stockings on a\nwinter's night:  only, when all the birds were going, he toddled\nout, and took off his cap to them, and wished them a merry journey\nand a safe return; and then gathered up all the feathers which they\nhad left, and cleaned them to sell down south, and make feather-\nbeds for stuffy people to lie on.\n\nThen the petrels asked this bird and that whether they would take\nTom to Shiny Wall:  but one set was going to Sutherland, and one to\nthe Shetlands, and one to Norway, and one to Spitzbergen, and one\nto Iceland, and one to Greenland:  but none would go to Shiny Wall.\nSo the good-natured petrels said that they would show him part of\nthe way themselves, but they were only going as far as Jan Mayen's\nLand; and after that he must shift for himself.\n\nAnd then all the birds rose up, and streamed away in long black\nlines, north, and north-east, and north-west, across the bright\nblue summer sky; and their cry was like ten thousand packs of\nhounds, and ten thousand peals of bells.  Only the puffins stayed\nbehind, and killed the young rabbits, and laid their eggs in the\nrabbit-burrows; which was rough practice, certainly; but a man must\nsee to his own family.\n\nAnd, as Tom and the petrels went north-eastward, it began to blow\nright hard; for the old gentleman in the gray great-coat, who looks\nafter the big copper boiler, in the gulf of Mexico, had got\nbehindhand with his work; so Mother Carey had sent an electric\nmessage to him for more steam; and now the steam was coming, as\nmuch in an hour as ought to have come in a week, puffing and\nroaring and swishing and swirling, till you could not see where the\nsky ended and the sea began.  But Tom and the petrels never cared,\nfor the gale was right abaft, and away they went over the crests of\nthe billows, as merry as so many flying-fish.\n\nAnd at last they saw an ugly sight--the black side of a great ship,\nwaterlogged in the trough of the sea.  Her funnel and her masts\nwere overboard, and swayed and surged under her lee; her decks were\nswept as clean as a barn floor, and there was no living soul on\nboard.\n\nThe petrels flew up to her, and wailed round her; for they were\nvery sorry indeed, and also they expected to find some salt pork;\nand Tom scrambled on board of her and looked round, frightened and\nsad.\n\nAnd there, in a little cot, lashed tight under the bulwark, lay a\nbaby fast asleep; the very same baby, Tom saw at once, which he had\nseen in the singing lady's arms.\n\nHe went up to it, and wanted to wake it; but behold, from under the\ncot out jumped a little black and tan terrier dog, and began\nbarking and snapping at Tom, and would not let him touch the cot.\n\nTom knew the dog's teeth could not hurt him:  but at least it could\nshove him away, and did; and he and the dog fought and struggled,\nfor he wanted to help the baby, and did not want to throw the poor\ndog overboard:  but as they were struggling there came a tall green\nsea, and walked in over the weather side of the ship, and swept\nthem all into the waves.\n\n\"Oh, the baby, the baby!\" screamed Tom:  but the next moment he did\nnot scream at all; for he saw the cot settling down through the\ngreen water, with the baby, smiling in it, fast asleep; and he saw\nthe fairies come up from below, and carry baby and cradle gently\ndown in their soft arms; and then he knew it was all right, and\nthat there would be a new water-baby in St. Brandan's Isle.\n\nAnd the poor little dog?\n\nWhy, after he had kicked and coughed a little, he sneezed so hard,\nthat he sneezed himself clean out of his skin, and turned into a\nwater-dog, and jumped and danced round Tom, and ran over the crests\nof the waves, and snapped at the jelly-fish and the mackerel, and\nfollowed Tom the whole way to the Other-end-of-Nowhere.\n\nThen they went on again, till they began to see the peak of Jan\nMayen's Land, standing-up like a white sugar-loaf, two miles above\nthe clouds.\n\nAnd there they fell in with a whole flock of molly-mocks, who were\nfeeding on a dead whale.\n\n\"These are the fellows to show you the way,\" said Mother Carey's\nchickens; \"we cannot help you farther north.  We don't like to get\namong the ice pack, for fear it should nip our toes:  but the\nmollys dare fly anywhere.\"\n\nSo the petrels called to the mollys:  but they were so busy and\ngreedy, gobbling and peeking and spluttering and fighting over the\nblubber, that they did not take the least notice.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the petrels, \"you lazy greedy lubbers, this\nyoung gentleman is going to Mother Carey, and if you don't attend\non him, you won't earn your discharge from her, you know.\"\n\n\"Greedy we are,\" says a great fat old molly, \"but lazy we ain't;\nand, as for lubbers, we're no more lubbers than you.  Let's have a\nlook at the lad.\"\n\nAnd he flapped right into Tom's face, and stared at him in the most\nimpudent way (for the mollys are audacious fellows, as all whalers\nknow), and then asked him where he hailed from, and what land he\nsighted last.\n\nAnd, when Tom told him, he seemed pleased, and said he was a good\nplucked one to have got so far.\n\n\"Come along, lads,\" he said to the rest, \"and give this little chap\na cast over the pack, for Mother Carey's sake.  We've eaten blubber\nenough for to-day, and we'll e'en work out a bit of our time by\nhelping the lad.\"\n\nSo the mollys took Tom up on their backs, and flew off with him,\nlaughing and joking--and oh, how they did smell of train oil!\n\n\"Who are you, you jolly birds?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We are the spirits of the old Greenland skippers (as every sailor\nknows), who hunted here, right whales and horse-whales, full\nhundreds of years agone.  But, because we were saucy and greedy, we\nwere all turned into mollys, to eat whale's blubber all our days.\nBut lubbers we are none, and could sail a ship now against any man\nin the North seas, though we don't hold with this new-fangled\nsteam.  And it's a shame of those black imps of petrels to call us\nso; but because they're her grace's pets, they think they may say\nanything they like.\"\n\n\"And who are you?\" asked Tom of him, for he saw that he was the\nking of all the birds.\n\n\"My name is Hendrick Hudson, and a right good skipper was I; and my\nname will last to the world's end, in spite of all the wrong I did.\nFor I discovered Hudson River, and I named Hudson's Bay; and many\nhave come in my wake that dared not have shown me the way.  But I\nwas a hard man in my time, that's truth, and stole the poor Indians\noff the coast of Maine, and sold them for slaves down in Virginia;\nand at last I was so cruel to my sailors, here in these very seas,\nthat they set me adrift in an open boat, and I never was heard of\nmore.  So now I'm the king of all mollys, till I've worked out my\ntime.\"\n\nAnd now they came to the edge of the pack, and beyond it they could\nsee Shiny Wall looming, through mist, and snow, and storm.  But the\npack rolled horribly upon the swell, and the ice giants fought and\nroared, and leapt upon each other's backs, and ground each other to\npowder, so that Tom was afraid to venture among them, lest he\nshould be ground to powder too.  And he was the more afraid, when\nhe saw lying among the ice pack the wrecks of many a gallant ship;\nsome with masts and yards all standing, some with the seamen frozen\nfast on board.  Alas, alas, for them!  They were all true English\nhearts; and they came to their end like good knights-errant, in\nsearching for the white gate that never was opened yet.\n\nBut the good mollys took Tom and his dog up, and flew with them\nsafe over the pack and the roaring ice giants, and set them down at\nthe foot of Shiny Wall.\n\n\"And where is the gate?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"There is no gate,\" said the mollys.\n\n\"No gate?\" cried Tom, aghast.\n\n\"None; never a crack of one, and that's the whole of the secret, as\nbetter fellows, lad, than you have found to their cost; and if\nthere had been, they'd have killed by now every right whale that\nswims the sea.\"\n\n\"What am I to do, then?\"\n\n\"Dive under the floe, to be sure, if you have pluck.\"\n\n\"I've not come so far to turn now,\" said Tom; \"so here goes for a\nheader.\"\n\n\"A lucky voyage to you, lad,\" said the mollys; \"we knew you were\none of the right sort.  So good-bye.\"\n\n\"Why don't you come too?\" asked Tom.\n\nBut the mollys only wailed sadly, \"We can't go yet, we can't go\nyet,\" and flew away over the pack.\n\nSo Tom dived under the great white gate which never was opened yet,\nand went on in black darkness, at the bottom of the sea, for seven\ndays and seven nights.  And yet he was not a bit frightened.  Why\nshould he be?  He was a brave English lad, whose business is to go\nout and see all the world.\n\nAnd at last he saw the light, and clear clear water overhead; and\nup he came a thousand fathoms, among clouds of sea-moths, which\nfluttered round his head.  There were moths with pink heads and\nwings and opal bodies, that flapped about slowly; moths with brown\nwings that flapped about quickly; yellow shrimps that hopped and\nskipped most quickly of all; and jellies of all the colours in the\nworld, that neither hopped nor skipped, but only dawdled and\nyawned, and would not get out of his way.  The dog snapped at them\ntill his jaws were tired; but Tom hardly minded them at all, he was\nso eager to get to the top of the water, and see the pool where the\ngood whales go.\n\nAnd a very large pool it was, miles and miles across, though the\nair was so clear that the ice cliffs on the opposite side looked as\nif they were close at hand.  All round it the ice cliffs rose, in\nwalls and spires and battlements, and caves and bridges, and\nstories and galleries, in which the ice-fairies live, and drive\naway the storms and clouds, that Mother Carey's pool may lie calm\nfrom year's end to year's end.  And the sun acted policeman, and\nwalked round outside every day, peeping just over the top of the\nice wall, to see that all went right; and now and then he played\nconjuring tricks, or had an exhibition of fireworks, to amuse the\nice-fairies.  For he would make himself into four or five suns at\nonce, or paint the sky with rings and crosses and crescents of\nwhite fire, and stick himself in the middle of them, and wink at\nthe fairies; and I daresay they were very much amused; for\nanything's fun in the country.\n\nAnd there the good whales lay, the happy sleepy beasts, upon the\nstill oily sea.  They were all right whales, you must know, and\nfinners, and razor-backs, and bottle-noses, and spotted sea-\nunicorns with long ivory horns.  But the sperm whales are such\nraging, ramping, roaring, rumbustious fellows, that, if Mother\nCarey let them in, there would be no more peace in Peacepool.  So\nshe packs them away in a great pond by themselves at the South\nPole, two hundred and sixty-three miles south-south-east of Mount\nErebus, the great volcano in the ice; and there they butt each\nother with their ugly noses, day and night from year's end to\nyear's end.\n\nBut here there were only good quiet beasts, lying about like the\nblack hulls of sloops, and blowing every now and then jets of white\nsteam, or sculling round with their huge mouths open, for the sea-\nmoths to swim down their throats.  There were no threshers there to\nthresh their poor old backs, or sword-fish to stab their stomachs,\nor saw-fish to rip them up, or ice-sharks to bite lumps out of\ntheir sides, or whalers to harpoon and lance them.  They were quite\nsafe and happy there; and all they had to do was to wait quietly in\nPeacepool, till Mother Carey sent for them to make them out of old\nbeasts into new.\n\nTom swam up to the nearest whale, and asked the way to Mother\nCarey.\n\n\"There she sits in the middle,\" said the whale.\n\nTom looked; but he could see nothing in the middle of the pool, but\none peaked iceberg:  and he said so.\n\n\"That's Mother Carey,\" said the whale, \"as you will find when you\nget to her.  There she sits making old beasts into new all the year\nround.\"\n\n\"How does she do that?\"\n\n\"That's her concern, not mine,\" said the old whale; and yawned so\nwide (for he was very large) that there swam into his mouth 943\nsea-moths, 13,846 jelly-fish no bigger than pins' heads, a string\nof salpae nine yards long, and forty-three little ice-crabs, who\ngave each other a parting pinch all round, tucked their legs under\ntheir stomachs, and determined to die decently, like Julius Caesar.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Tom, \"she cuts up a great whale like you into a\nwhole shoal of porpoises?\"\n\nAt which the old whale laughed so violently that he coughed up all\nthe creatures; who swam away again very thankful at having escaped\nout of that terrible whalebone net of his, from which bourne no\ntraveller returns; and Tom went on to the iceberg, wondering.\n\nAnd, when he came near it, it took the form of the grandest old\nlady he had ever seen--a white marble lady, sitting on a white\nmarble throne.  And from the foot of the throne there swum away,\nout and out into the sea, millions of new-born creatures, of more\nshapes and colours than man ever dreamed.  And they were Mother\nCarey's children, whom she makes out of the sea-water all day long.\n\nHe expected, of course--like some grown people who ought to know\nbetter--to find her snipping, piecing, fitting, stitching,\ncobbling, basting, filing, planing, hammering, turning, polishing,\nmoulding, measuring, chiselling, clipping, and so forth, as men do\nwhen they go to work to make anything.\n\nBut, instead of that, she sat quite still with her chin upon her\nhand, looking down into the sea with two great grand blue eyes, as\nblue as the sea itself.  Her hair was as white as the snow--for she\nwas very very old--in fact, as old as anything which you are likely\nto come across, except the difference between right and wrong.\n\nAnd, when she saw Tom, she looked at him very kindly.\n\n\"What do you want, my little man?  It is long since I have seen a\nwater-baby here.\"\n\nTom told her his errand, and asked the way to the Other-end-of-\nNowhere.\n\n\"You ought to know yourself, for you have been there already.\"\n\n\"Have I, ma'am?  I'm sure I forget all about it.\"\n\n\"Then look at me.\"\n\nAnd, as Tom looked into her great blue eyes, he recollected the way\nperfectly.\n\nNow, was not that strange?\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Tom.  \"Then I won't trouble your ladyship\nany more; I hear you are very busy.\"\n\n\"I am never more busy than I am now,\" she said, without stirring a\nfinger.\n\n\"I heard, ma'am, that you were always making new beasts out of\nold.\"\n\n\"So people fancy.  But I am not going to trouble myself to make\nthings, my little dear.  I sit here and make them make themselves.\"\n\n\"You are a clever fairy, indeed,\" thought Tom.  And he was quite\nright.\n\nThat is a grand trick of good old Mother Carey's, and a grand\nanswer, which she has had occasion to make several times to\nimpertinent people.\n\nThere was once, for instance, a fairy who was so clever that she\nfound out how to make butterflies.  I don't mean sham ones; no:\nbut real live ones, which would fly, and eat, and lay eggs, and do\neverything that they ought; and she was so proud of her skill that\nshe went flying straight off to the North Pole, to boast to Mother\nCarey how she could make butterflies.\n\nBut Mother Carey laughed.\n\n\"Know, silly child,\" she said, \"that any one can make things, if\nthey will take time and trouble enough:  but it is not every one\nwho, like me, can make things make themselves.\"\n\nBut people do not yet believe that Mother Carey is as clever as all\nthat comes to; and they will not till they, too, go the journey to\nthe Other-end-of-Nowhere.\n\n\"And now, my pretty little man,\" said Mother Carey, \"you are sure\nyou know the way to the Other-end-of-Nowhere?\"\n\nTom thought; and behold, he had forgotten it utterly.\n\n\"That is because you took your eyes off me.\"\n\nTom looked at her again, and recollected; and then looked away, and\nforgot in an instant.\n\n\"But what am I to do, ma'am?  For I can't keep looking at you when\nI am somewhere else.\"\n\n\"You must do without me, as most people have to do, for nine\nhundred and ninety-nine thousandths of their lives; and look at the\ndog instead; for he knows the way well enough, and will not forget\nit.  Besides, you may meet some very queer-tempered people there,\nwho will not let you pass without this passport of mine, which you\nmust hang round your neck and take care of; and, of course, as the\ndog will always go behind you, you must go the whole way backward.\"\n\n\"Backward!\" cried Tom.  \"Then I shall not be able to see my way.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, if you look forward, you will not see a step\nbefore you, and be certain to go wrong; but, if you look behind\nyou, and watch carefully whatever you have passed, and especially\nkeep your eye on the dog, who goes by instinct, and therefore can't\ngo wrong, then you will know what is coming next, as plainly as if\nyou saw it in a looking-glass.\"\n\nTom was very much astonished:  but he obeyed her, for he had learnt\nalways to believe what the fairies told him.\n\n\"So it is, my dear child,\" said Mother Carey; \"and I will tell you\na story, which will show you that I am perfectly right, as it is my\ncustom to be.\n\n\"Once on a time, there were two brothers.  One was called\nPrometheus, because he always looked before him, and boasted that\nhe was wise beforehand.  The other was called Epimetheus, because\nhe always looked behind him, and did not boast at all; but said\nhumbly, like the Irishman, that he had sooner prophesy after the\nevent.\n\n\"Well, Prometheus was a very clever fellow, of course, and invented\nall sorts of wonderful things.  But, unfortunately, when they were\nset to work, to work was just what they would not do:  wherefore\nvery little has come of them, and very little is left of them; and\nnow nobody knows what they were, save a few archaeological old\ngentlemen who scratch in queer corners, and find little there save\nPtinum Furem, Blaptem Mortisagam, Acarum Horridum, and Tineam\nLaciniarum.\n\n\"But Epimetheus was a very slow fellow, certainly, and went among\nmen for a clod, and a muff, and a milksop, and a slowcoach, and a\nbloke, and a boodle, and so forth.  And very little he did, for\nmany years:  but what he did, he never had to do over again.\n\n\"And what happened at last?  There came to the two brothers the\nmost beautiful creature that ever was seen, Pandora by name; which\nmeans, All the gifts of the Gods.  But because she had a strange\nbox in her hand, this fanciful, forecasting, suspicious,\nprudential, theoretical, deductive, prophesying Prometheus, who was\nalways settling what was going to happen, would have nothing to do\nwith pretty Pandora and her box.\n\n\"But Epimetheus took her and it, as he took everything that came;\nand married her for better for worse, as every man ought, whenever\nhe has even the chance of a good wife.  And they opened the box\nbetween them, of course, to see what was inside:  for, else, of\nwhat possible use could it have been to them?\n\n\"And out flew all the ills which flesh is heir to; all the children\nof the four great bogies, Self-will, Ignorance, Fear, and Dirt--for\ninstance:\n\n\nMeasles,        Famines,\nMonks,          Quacks,\nScarlatina,     Unpaid bills,\nIdols,          Tight stays,\nHooping-coughs, Potatoes,\nPopes,          Bad Wine,\nWars,           Despots,\nPeacemongers,   Demagogues,\nAnd, worst of all, Naughty Boys and Girls.\n\n\nBut one thing remained at the bottom of the box, and that was,\nHope.\n\n\"So Epimetheus got a great deal of trouble, as most men do in this\nworld:  but he got the three best things in the world into the\nbargain--a good wife, and experience, and hope:  while Prometheus\nhad just as much trouble, and a great deal more (as you will hear),\nof his own making; with nothing beside, save fancies spun out of\nhis own brain, as a spider spins her web out of her stomach.\n\n\"And Prometheus kept on looking before him so far ahead, that as he\nwas running about with a box of lucifers (which were the only\nuseful things he ever invented, and do as much harm as good), he\ntrod on his own nose, and tumbled down (as most deductive\nphilosophers do), whereby he set the Thames on fire; and they have\nhardly put it out again yet.  So he had to be chained to the top of\na mountain, with a vulture by him to give him a peck whenever he\nstirred, lest he should turn the whole world upside down with his\nprophecies and his theories.\n\n\"But stupid old Epimetheus went working and grubbing on, with the\nhelp of his wife Pandora, always looking behind him to see what had\nhappened, till he really learnt to know now and then what would\nhappen next; and understood so well which side his bread was\nbuttered, and which way the cat jumped, that he began to make\nthings which would work, and go on working, too; to till and drain\nthe ground, and to make looms, and ships, and railroads, and steam\nploughs, and electric telegraphs, and all the things which you see\nin the Great Exhibition; and to foretell famine, and bad weather,\nand the price of stocks and (what is hardest of all) the next\nvagary of the great idol Whirligig, which some call Public Opinion;\ntill at last he grew as rich as a Jew, and as fat as a farmer, and\npeople thought twice before they meddled with him, but only once\nbefore they asked him to help them; for, because he earned his\nmoney well, he could afford to spend it well likewise.\n\n\"And his children are the men of science, who get good lasting work\ndone in the world; but the children of Prometheus are the fanatics,\nand the theorists, and the bigots, and the bores, and the noisy\nwindy people, who go telling silly folk what will happen, instead\nof looking to see what has happened already.\"\n\nNow, was not Mother Carey's a wonderful story?  And, I am happy to\nsay, Tom believed it every word.\n\nFor so it happened to Tom likewise.  He was very sorely tried; for\nthough, by keeping the dog to heels (or rather to toes, for he had\nto walk backward), he could see pretty well which way the dog was\nhunting, yet it was much slower work to go backwards than to go\nforwards.  But, what was more trying still, no sooner had he got\nout of Peacepool, than there came running to him all the conjurors,\nfortune-tellers, astrologers, prophesiers, projectors,\nprestigiators, as many as were in those parts (and there are too\nmany of them everywhere), Old Mother Shipton on her broomstick,\nwith Merlin, Thomas the Rhymer, Gerbertus, Rabanus Maurus,\nNostradamus, Zadkiel, Raphael, Moore, Old Nixon, and a good many in\nblack coats and white ties who might have known better, considering\nin what century they were born, all bawling and screaming at him,\n\"Look a-head, only look a-head; and we will show you what man never\nsaw before, and right away to the end of the world!\"\n\nBut I am proud to say that, though Tom had not been to Cambridge--\nfor, if he had, he would have certainly been senior wrangler--he\nwas such a little dogged, hard, gnarly, foursquare brick of an\nEnglish boy, that he never turned his head round once all the way\nfrom Peacepool to the Other-end-of-Nowhere:  but kept his eye on\nthe dog, and let him pick out the scent, hot or cold, straight or\ncrooked, wet or dry, up hill or down dale; by which means he never\nmade a single mistake, and saw all the wonderful and hitherto by-\nno-mortal-man-imagined things, which it is my duty to relate to you\nin the next chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII AND LAST.\n\n\n\n\"Come to me, O ye children!\nFor I hear you at your play;\nAnd the questions that perplexed me\nHave vanished quite away.\n\n\"Ye open the Eastern windows,\nThat look towards the sun,\nWhere thoughts are singing swallows,\nAnd the brooks of morning run.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"For what are all our contrivings\nAnd the wisdom of our books,\nWhen compared with your caresses,\nAnd the gladness of your looks?\n\n\"Ye are better than all the ballads\nThat ever were sung or said;\nFor ye are living poems,\nAnd all the rest are dead.\"\n\nLONGFELLOW.\n\n\nHere begins the never-to-be-too-much-studied account of the nine-\nhundred-and-ninety-ninth part of the wonderful things which Tom saw\non his journey to the Other-end-of-Nowhere; which all good little\nchildren are requested to read; that, if ever they get to the\nOther-end-of-Nowhere, as they may very probably do, they may not\nburst out laughing, or try to run away, or do any other silly\nvulgar thing which may offend Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid.\n\nNow, as soon as Tom had left Peacepool, he came to the white lap of\nthe great sea-mother, ten thousand fathoms deep; where she makes\nworld-pap all day long, for the steam-giants to knead, and the\nfire-giants to bake, till it has risen and hardened into mountain-\nloaves and island-cakes.\n\nAnd there Tom was very near being kneaded up in the world-pap, and\nturned into a fossil water-baby; which would have astonished the\nGeological Society of New Zealand some hundreds of thousands of\nyears hence.\n\nFor, as he walked along in the silence of the sea-twilight, on the\nsoft white ocean floor, he was aware of a hissing, and a roaring,\nand a thumping, and a pumping, as of all the steam-engines in the\nworld at once.  And, when he came near, the water grew boiling-hot;\nnot that that hurt him in the least:  but it also grew as foul as\ngruel; and every moment he stumbled over dead shells, and fish, and\nsharks, and seals, and whales, which had been killed by the hot\nwater.\n\nAnd at last he came to the great sea-serpent himself, lying dead at\nthe bottom; and as he was too thick to scramble over, Tom had to\nwalk round him three-quarters of a mile and more, which put him out\nof his path sadly; and, when he had got round, he came to the place\ncalled Stop.  And there he stopped, and just in time.\n\nFor he was on the edge of a vast hole in the bottom of the sea, up\nwhich was rushing and roaring clear steam enough to work all the\nengines in the world at once; so clear, indeed, that it was quite\nlight at moments; and Tom could see almost up to the top of the\nwater above, and down below into the pit for nobody knows how far.\n\nBut, as soon as he bent his head over the edge, he got such a rap\non the nose from pebbles, that he jumped back again; for the steam,\nas it rushed up, rasped away the sides of the hole, and hurled it\nup into the sea in a shower of mud and gravel and ashes; and then\nit spread all around, and sank again, and covered in the dead fish\nso fast, that before Tom had stood there five minutes he was buried\nin silt up to his ankles, and began to be afraid that he should\nhave been buried alive.\n\nAnd perhaps he would have been, but that while he was thinking, the\nwhole piece of ground on which he stood was torn off and blown\nupwards, and away flew Tom a mile up through the sea, wondering\nwhat was coming next.\n\nAt last he stopped--thump! and found himself tight in the legs of\nthe most wonderful bogy which he had ever seen.\n\nIt had I don't know how many wings, as big as the sails of a\nwindmill, and spread out in a ring like them; and with them it\nhovered over the steam which rushed up, as a ball hovers over the\ntop of a fountain.  And for every wing above it had a leg below,\nwith a claw like a comb at the tip, and a nostril at the root; and\nin the middle it had no stomach and one eye; and as for its mouth,\nthat was all on one side, as the madreporiform tubercle in a star-\nfish is.  Well, it was a very strange beast; but no stranger than\nsome dozens which you may see.\n\n\"What do you want here,\" it cried quite peevishly, \"getting in my\nway?\" and it tried to drop Tom:  but he held on tight to its claws,\nthinking himself safer where he was.\n\nSo Tom told him who he was, and what his errand was.  And the thing\nwinked its one eye, and sneered:\n\n\"I am too old to be taken in in that way.  You are come after gold-\n-I know you are.\"\n\n\"Gold!  What is gold?\"  And really Tom did not know; but the\nsuspicious old bogy would not believe him.\n\nBut after a while Tom began to understand a little.  For, as the\nvapours came up out of the hole, the bogy smelt them with his\nnostrils, and combed them and sorted them with his combs; and then,\nwhen they steamed up through them against his wings, they were\nchanged into showers and streams of metal.  From one wing fell\ngold-dust, and from another silver, and from another copper, and\nfrom another tin, and from another lead, and so on, and sank into\nthe soft mud, into veins and cracks, and hardened there.  Whereby\nit comes to pass that the rocks are full of metal.\n\nBut, all of a sudden, somebody shut off the steam below, and the\nhole was left empty in an instant:  and then down rushed the water\ninto the hole, in such a whirlpool that the bogy spun round and\nround as fast as a teetotum.  But that was all in his day's work,\nlike a fair fall with the hounds; so all he did was to say to Tom -\n\n\"Now is your time, youngster, to get down, if you are in earnest,\nwhich I don't believe.\"\n\n\"You'll soon see,\" said Tom; and away he went, as bold as Baron\nMunchausen, and shot down the rushing cataract like a salmon at\nBallisodare.\n\nAnd, when he got to the bottom, he swam till he was washed on shore\nsafe upon the Other-end-of-Nowhere; and he found it, to his\nsurprise, as most other people do, much more like This-End-of-\nSomewhere than he had been in the habit of expecting\n\nAnd first he went through Waste-paper-land, where all the stupid\nbooks lie in heaps, up hill and down dale, like leaves in a winter\nwood; and there he saw people digging and grubbing among them, to\nmake worse books out of bad ones, and thrashing chaff to save the\ndust of it; and a very good trade they drove thereby, especially\namong children.\n\nThen he went by the sea of slops, to the mountain of messes, and\nthe territory of tuck, where the ground was very sticky, for it was\nall made of bad toffee (not Everton toffee, of course), and full of\ndeep cracks and holes choked with wind-fallen fruit, and green\ngoose-berries, and sloes, and crabs, and whinberries, and hips and\nhaws, and all the nasty things which little children will eat, if\nthey can get them.  But the fairies hide them out of the way in\nthat country as fast as they can, and very hard work they have, and\nof very little use it is.  For as fast as they hide away the old\ntrash, foolish and wicked people make fresh trash full of lime and\npoisonous paints, and actually go and steal receipts out of old\nMadame Science's big book to invent poisons for little children,\nand sell them at wakes and fairs and tuck-shops.  Very well.  Let\nthem go on.  Dr. Letheby and Dr. Hassall cannot catch them, though\nthey are setting traps for them all day long.  But the Fairy with\nthe birch-rod will catch them all in time, and make them begin at\none corner of their shops, and eat their way out at the other:  by\nwhich time they will have got such stomach-aches as will cure them\nof poisoning little children.\n\nNext he saw all the little people in the world, writing all the\nlittle books in the world, about all the other little people in the\nworld; probably because they had no great people to write about:\nand if the names of the books were not Squeeky, nor the Pump-\nlighter, nor the Narrow Narrow World, nor the Hills of the\nChattermuch, nor the Children's Twaddeday, why then they were\nsomething else.  And, all the rest of the little people in the\nworld read the books, and thought themselves each as good as the\nPresident; and perhaps they were right, for every one knows his own\nbusiness best.  But Tom thought he would sooner have a jolly good\nfairy tale, about Jack the Giant-killer or Beauty and the Beast,\nwhich taught him something that he didn't know already.\n\nAnd next he came to the centre of Creation (the hub, they call it\nthere), which lies in latitude 42.21 degrees south, and longitude\n108.56 degrees east.\n\nAnd there he found all the wise people instructing mankind in the\nscience of spirit-rapping, while their house was burning over their\nheads:  and when Tom told them of the fire, they held an\nindignation meeting forthwith, and unanimously determined to hang\nTom's dog for coming into their country with gunpowder in his\nmouth.  Tom couldn't help saying that though they did fancy they\nhad carried all the wit away with them out of Lincolnshire two\nhundred years ago, yet if they had had one such Lincolnshire\nnobleman among them as good old Lord Yarborough, he would have\ncalled for the fire-engines before he hanged other people's dogs.\nBut it was of no use, and the dog was hanged:  and Tom couldn't\neven have his carcase; for they had abolished the have-his-carcase\nact in that country, for fear lest when rogues fell out, honest men\nshould come by their own.  And so they would have succeeded\nperfectly, as they always do, only that (as they also always do)\nthey failed in one little particular, viz. that the dog would not\ndie, being a water-dog, but bit their fingers so abominably that\nthey were forced to let him go, and Tom likewise, as British\nsubjects.  Whereon they recommenced rapping for the spirits of\ntheir fathers; and very much astonished the poor old spirits were\nwhen they came, and saw how, according to the laws of Mrs.\nBedonebyasyoudid, their descendants had weakened their constitution\nby hard living.\n\nThen came Tom to the Island of Polupragmosyne (which some call\nRogues' Harbour; but they are wrong; for that is in the middle of\nBramshill Bushes, and the county police have cleared it out long\nago).  There every one knows his neighbour's business better than\nhis own; and a very noisy place it is, as might be expected,\nconsidering that all the inhabitants are ex officio on the wrong\nside of the house in the \"Parliament of Man, and the Federation of\nthe World;\" and are always making wry mouths, and crying that the\nfairies' grapes were sour.\n\nThere Tom saw ploughs drawing horses, nails driving hammers, birds'\nnests taking boys, books making authors, bulls keeping china-shops,\nmonkeys shaving cats, dead dogs drilling live lions, blind\nbrigadiers shelfed as principals of colleges, play-actors not in\nthe least shelfed as popular preachers; and, in short, every one\nset to do something which he had not learnt, because in what he had\nlearnt, or pretended to learn, he had failed.\n\nThere stands the Pantheon of the Great Unsuccessful, from the\nbuilders of the Tower of Babel to those of the Trafalgar Fountains;\nin which politicians lecture on the constitutions which ought to\nhave marched, conspirators on the revolutions which ought to have\nsucceeded, economists on the schemes which ought to have made every\none's fortune, and projectors on the discoveries which ought to\nhave set the Thames on fire.  There cobblers lecture on orthopedy\n(whatsoever that may be) because they cannot sell their shoes; and\npoets on AEsthetics (whatsoever that may be) because they cannot\nsell their poetry.  There philosophers demonstrate that England\nwould be the freest and richest country in the world, if she would\nonly turn Papist again; penny-a-liners abuse the Times, because\nthey have not wit enough to get on its staff; and young ladies walk\nabout with lockets of Charles the First's hair (or of somebody\nelse's, when the Jews' genuine stock is used up), inscribed with\nthe neat and appropriate legend--which indeed is popular through\nall that land, and which, I hope, you will learn to translate in\ndue time and to perpend likewise:-\n\n\n\"Victrix causa diis placuit, sed victa puellis.\"\n\n\nWhen he got into the middle of the town, they all set on him at\nonce, to show him his way; or rather, to show him that he did not\nknow his way; for as for asking him what way he wanted to go, no\none ever thought of that.\n\nBut one pulled him hither, and another poked him thither, and a\nthird cried -\n\n\"You mustn't go west, I tell you; it is destruction to go west.\"\n\n\"But I am not going west, as you may see,\" said Tom.\n\nAnd another, \"The east lies here, my dear; I assure you this is the\neast.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to go east,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Well, then, at all events, whichever way you are going, you are\ngoing wrong,\" cried they all with one voice--which was the only\nthing which they ever agreed about; and all pointed at once to all\nthe thirty-and-two points of the compass, till Tom thought all the\nsign-posts in England had got together, and fallen fighting.\n\nAnd whether he would have ever escaped out of the town, it is hard\nto say, if the dog had not taken it into his head that they were\ngoing to pull his master in pieces, and tackled them so sharply\nabout the gastrocnemius muscle, that he gave them some business of\ntheir own to think of at last; and while they were rubbing their\nbitten calves, Tom and the dog got safe away.\n\nOn the borders of that island he found Gotham, where the wise men\nlive; the same who dragged the pond because the moon had fallen\ninto it, and planted a hedge round the cuckoo, to keep spring all\nthe year.  And he found them bricking up the town gate, because it\nwas so wide that little folks could not get through.  And, when he\nasked why, they told him they were expanding their liturgy.  So he\nwent on; for it was no business of his:  only he could not help\nsaying that in his country, if the kitten could not get in at the\nsame hole as the cat, she might stay outside and mew.\n\nBut he saw the end of such fellows, when he came to the island of\nthe Golden Asses, where nothing but thistles grow.  For there they\nwere all turned into mokes with ears a yard long, for meddling with\nmatters which they do not understand, as Lucius did in the story.\nAnd like him, mokes they must remain, till, by the laws of\ndevelopment, the thistles develop into roses.  Till then, they must\ncomfort themselves with the thought, that the longer their ears\nare, the thicker their hides; and so a good beating don't hurt\nthem.\n\nThen came Tom to the great land of Hearsay, in which are no less\nthan thirty and odd kings, beside half a dozen Republics, and\nperhaps more by next mail.\n\nAnd there he fell in with a deep, dark, deadly, and destructive\nwar, waged by the princes and potentates of those parts, both\nspiritual and temporal, against what do you think?  One thing I am\nsure of.  That unless I told you, you would never know; nor how\nthey waged that war either; for all their strategy and art military\nconsisted in the safe and easy process of stopping their ears and\nscreaming, \"Oh, don't tell us!\" and then running away.\n\nSo when Tom came into that land, he found them all, high and low,\nman, woman, and child, running for their lives day and night\ncontinually, and entreating not to be told they didn't know what:\nonly the land being an island, and they having a dislike to the\nwater (being a musty lot for the most part), they ran round and\nround the shore for ever, which (as the island was exactly of the\nsame circumference as the planet on which we have the honour of\nliving) was hard work, especially to those who had business to look\nafter.  But before them, as bandmaster and fugleman, ran a\ngentleman shearing a pig; the melodious strains of which animal led\nthem for ever, if not to conquest, still to flight; and kept up\ntheir spirits mightily with the thought that they would at least\nhave the pig's wool for their pains.\n\nAnd running after them, day and night, came such a poor, lean,\nseedy, hard-worked old giant, as ought to have been cockered up,\nand had a good dinner given him, and a good wife found him, and\nbeen set to play with little children; and then he would have been\na very presentable old fellow after all; for he had a heart, though\nit was considerably overgrown with brains.\n\nHe was made up principally of fish bones and parchment, put\ntogether with wire and Canada balsam; and smelt strongly of\nspirits, though he never drank anything but water:  but spirits he\nused somehow, there was no denying.  He had a great pair of\nspectacles on his nose, and a butterfly-net in one hand, and a\ngeological hammer in the other; and was hung all over with pockets,\nfull of collecting boxes, bottles, microscopes, telescopes,\nbarometers, ordnance maps, scalpels, forceps, photographic\napparatus, and all other tackle for finding out everything about\neverything, and a little more too.  And, most strange of all, he\nwas running not forwards but backwards, as fast as he could.\n\nAway all the good folks ran from him, except Tom, who stood his\nground and dodged between his legs; and the giant, when he had\npassed him, looked down, and cried, as if he was quite pleased and\ncomforted, -\n\n\"What? who are you?  And you actually don't run away, like all the\nrest?\"  But he had to take his spectacles off, Tom remarked, in\norder to see him plainly.\n\nTom told him who he was; and the giant pulled out a bottle and a\ncork instantly, to collect him with.\n\nBut Tom was too sharp for that, and dodged between his legs and in\nfront of him; and then the giant could not see him at all.\n\n\"No, no, no!\" said Tom, \"I've not been round the world, and through\nthe world, and up to Mother Carey's haven, beside being caught in a\nnet and called a Holothurian and a Cephalopod, to be bottled up by\nany old giant like you.\"\n\nAnd when the giant understood what a great traveller Tom had been,\nhe made a truce with him at once, and would have kept him there to\nthis day to pick his brains, so delighted was he at finding any one\nto tell him what he did not know before.\n\n\"Ah, you lucky little dog!\" said he at last, quite simply--for he\nwas the simplest, pleasantest, honestest, kindliest old Dominie\nSampson of a giant that ever turned the world upside down without\nintending it--\"ah, you lucky little dog!  If I had only been where\nyou have been, to see what you have seen!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tom, \"if you want to do that, you had best put your\nhead under water for a few hours, as I did, and turn into a water-\nbaby, or some other baby, and then you might have a chance.\"\n\n\"Turn into a baby, eh?  If I could do that, and know what was\nhappening to me for but one hour, I should know everything then,\nand be at rest.  But I can't; I can't be a little child again; and\nI suppose if I could, it would be no use, because then I should\nthen know nothing about what was happening to me.  Ah, you lucky\nlittle dog!\" said the poor old giant.\n\n\"But why do you run after all these poor people?\" said Tom, who\nliked the giant very much.\n\n\"My dear, it's they that have been running after me, father and\nson, for hundreds and hundreds of years, throwing stones at me till\nthey have knocked off my spectacles fifty times, and calling me a\nmalignant and a turbaned Turk, who beat a Venetian and traduced the\nState--goodness only knows what they mean, for I never read poetry-\n-and hunting me round and round--though catch me they can't, for\nevery time I go over the same ground, I go the faster, and grow the\nbigger.  While all I want is to be friends with them, and to tell\nthem something to their advantage, like Mr. Joseph Ady:  only\nsomehow they are so strangely afraid of hearing it.  But, I suppose\nI am not a man of the world, and have no tact.\"\n\n\"But why don't you turn round and tell them so?\"\n\n\"Because I can't.  You see, I am one of the sons of Epimetheus, and\nmust go backwards, if I am to go at all.\"\n\n\"But why don't you stop, and let them come up to you?\"\n\n\"Why, my dear, only think.  If I did, all the butterflies and\ncockyolybirds would fly past me, and then I should catch no more\nnew species, and should grow rusty and mouldy, and die.  And I\ndon't intend to do that, my dear; for I have a destiny before me,\nthey say:  though what it is I don't know, and don't care.\"\n\n\"Don't care?\" said Tom.\n\n\"No.  Do the duty which lies nearest you, and catch the first\nbeetle you come across, is my motto; and I have thriven by it for\nsome hundred years.  Now I must go on.  Dear me, while I have been\ntalking to you, at least nine new species have escaped me.\"\n\nAnd on went the giant, behind before, like a bull in a china-shop,\ntill he ran into the steeple of the great idol temple (for they are\nall idolaters in those parts, of course, else they would never be\nafraid of giants), and knocked the upper half clean off, hurting\nhimself horribly about the small of the back.\n\nBut little he cared; for as soon as the ruins of the steeple were\nwell between his legs, he poked and peered among the falling\nstones, and shifted his spectacles, and pulled out his pocket-\nmagnifier, and cried -\n\n\"An entirely new Oniscus, and three obscure Podurellae!  Besides a\nmoth which M. le Roi des Papillons (though he, like all Frenchmen,\nis given to hasty inductions) says is confined to the limits of the\nGlacial Drift.  This is most important!\"\n\nAnd down he sat on the nave of the temple (not being a man of the\nworld) to examine his Podurellae.  Whereon (as was to be expected)\nthe roof caved in bodily, smashing the idols, and sending the\npriests flying out of doors and windows, like rabbits out of a\nburrow when a ferret goes in.\n\nBut he never heeded; for out of the dust flew a bat, and the giant\nhad him in a moment.\n\n\"Dear me!  This is even more important!  Here is a cognate species\nto that which Macgilliwaukie Brown insists is confined to the\nBuddhist temples of Little Thibet; and now when I look at it, it\nmay be only a variety produced by difference of climate!\"\n\nAnd having bagged his bat, up he got, and on he went; while all the\npeople ran, being in none the better humour for having their temple\nsmashed for the sake of three obscure species of Podurella, and a\nBuddhist bat.\n\n\"Well,\" thought Tom, \"this is a very pretty quarrel, with a good\ndeal to be said on both sides.  But it is no business of mine.\"\n\nAnd no more it was, because he was a water-baby, and had the\noriginal sow by the right ear; which you will never have, unless\nyou be a baby, whether of the water, the land, or the air, matters\nnot, provided you can only keep on continually being a baby.\n\nSo the giant ran round after the people, and the people ran round\nafter the giant, and they are running, unto this day for aught I\nknow, or do not know; and will run till either he, or they, or\nboth, turn into little children.  And then, as Shakespeare says\n(and therefore it must be true) -\n\n\n\"Jack shall have Gill\nNought shall go ill\nThe man shall have his mare again, and all go well.\"\n\n\nThen Tom came to a very famous island, which was called, in the\ndays of the great traveller Captain Gulliver, the Isle of Laputa.\nBut Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid has named it over again the Isle of\nTomtoddies, all heads and no bodies.\n\nAnd when Tom came near it, he heard such a grumbling and grunting\nand growling and wailing and weeping and whining that he thought\npeople must be ringing little pigs, or cropping puppies' ears, or\ndrowning kittens:  but when he came nearer still, he began to hear\nwords among the noise; which was the Tomtoddies' song which they\nsing morning and evening, and all night too, to their great idol\nExamination -\n\n\n\"I can't learn my lesson:  the examiner's coming!\"\n\n\nAnd that was the only song which they knew.\n\nAnd when Tom got on shore the first thing he saw was a great\npillar, on one side of which was inscribed, \"Playthings not allowed\nhere;\" at which he was so shocked that he would not stay to see\nwhat was written on the other side.  Then he looked round for the\npeople of the island:  but instead of men, women, and children, he\nfound nothing but turnips and radishes, beet and mangold wurzel,\nwithout a single green leaf among them, and half of them burst and\ndecayed, with toad-stools growing out of them.  Those which were\nleft began crying to Tom, in half a dozen different languages at\nonce, and all of them badly spoken, \"I can't learn my lesson; do\ncome and help me!\"  And one cried, \"Can you show me how to extract\nthis square root?\"\n\nAnd another, \"Can you tell me the distance between [alpha] Lyrae\nand [beta] Camelopardis?\"\n\nAnd another, \"What is the latitude and longitude of Snooksville, in\nNoman's County, Oregon, U.S.?\"\n\nAnd another, \"What was the name of Mutius Scaevola's thirteenth\ncousin's grandmother's maid's cat?\"\n\nAnd another, \"How long would it take a school-inspector of average\nactivity to tumble head over heels from London to York?\"\n\nAnd another, \"Can you tell me the name of a place that nobody ever\nheard of, where nothing ever happened, in a country which has not\nbeen discovered yet?\"\n\nAnd another, \"Can you show me how to correct this hopelessly\ncorrupt passage of Graidiocolosyrtus Tabenniticus, on the cause why\ncrocodiles have no tongues?\"\n\nAnd so on, and so on, and so on, till one would have thought they\nwere all trying for tide-waiters' places, or cornetcies in the\nheavy dragoons.\n\n\"And what good on earth will it do you if I did tell you?\" quoth\nTom.\n\nWell, they didn't know that:  all they knew was the examiner was\ncoming.\n\nThen Tom stumbled on the hugest and softest nimblecomequick turnip\nyou ever saw filling a hole in a crop of swedes, and it cried to\nhim, \"Can you tell me anything at all about anything you like?\"\n\n\"About what?\" says Tom.\n\n\"About anything you like; for as fast as I learn things I forget\nthem again.  So my mamma says that my intellect is not adapted for\nmethodic science, and says that I must go in for general\ninformation.\"\n\nTom told him that he did not know general information, nor any\nofficers in the army; only he had a friend once that went for a\ndrummer:  but he could tell him a great many strange things which\nhe had seen in his travels.\n\nSo he told him prettily enough, while the poor turnip listened very\ncarefully; and the more he listened, the more he forgot, and the\nmore water ran out of him.\n\nTom thought he was crying:  but it was only his poor brains running\naway, from being worked so hard; and as Tom talked, the unhappy\nturnip streamed down all over with juice, and split and shrank till\nnothing was left of him but rind and water; whereat Tom ran away in\na fright, for he thought he might be taken up for killing the\nturnip.\n\nBut, on the contrary, the turnip's parents were highly delighted,\nand considered him a saint and a martyr, and put up a long\ninscription over his tomb about his wonderful talents, early\ndevelopment, and unparalleled precocity.  Were they not a foolish\ncouple?  But there was a still more foolish couple next to them,\nwho were beating a wretched little radish, no bigger than my thumb,\nfor sullenness and obstinacy and wilful stupidity, and never knew\nthat the reason why it couldn't learn or hardly even speak was,\nthat there was a great worm inside it eating out all its brains.\nBut even they are no foolisher than some hundred score of papas and\nmammas, who fetch the rod when they ought to fetch a new toy, and\nsend to the dark cupboard instead of to the doctor.\n\nTom was so puzzled and frightened with all he saw, that he was\nlonging to ask the meaning of it; and at last he stumbled over a\nrespectable old stick lying half covered with earth.  But a very\nstout and worthy stick it was, for it belonged to good Roger Ascham\nin old time, and had carved on its head King Edward the Sixth, with\nthe Bible in his hand.\n\n\"You see,\" said the stick, \"there were as pretty little children\nonce as you could wish to see, and might have been so still if they\nhad been only left to grow up like human beings, and then handed\nover to me; but their foolish fathers and mothers, instead of\nletting them pick flowers, and make dirt-pies, and get birds'\nnests, and dance round the gooseberry bush, as little children\nshould, kept them always at lessons, working, working, working,\nlearning week-day lessons all week-days, and Sunday lessons all\nSunday, and weekly examinations every Saturday, and monthly\nexaminations every month, and yearly examinations every year,\neverything seven times over, as if once was not enough, and enough\nas good as a feast--till their brains grew big, and their bodies\ngrew small, and they were all changed into turnips, with little but\nwater inside; and still their foolish parents actually pick the\nleaves off them as fast as they grow, lest they should have\nanything green about them.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Tom, \"if dear Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby knew of it she\nwould send them a lot of tops, and balls, and marbles, and\nninepins, and make them all as jolly as sand-boys.\"\n\n\"It would be no use,\" said the stick.  \"They can't play now, if\nthey tried.  Don't you see how their legs have turned to roots and\ngrown into the ground, by never taking any exercise, but sapping\nand moping always in the same place?  But here comes the Examiner-\nof-all-Examiners.  So you had better get away, I warn you, or he\nwill examine you and your dog into the bargain, and set him to\nexamine all the other dogs, and you to examine all the other water-\nbabies.  There is no escaping out of his hands, for his nose is\nnine thousand miles long, and can go down chimneys, and through\nkeyholes, upstairs, downstairs, in my lady's chamber, examining all\nlittle boys, and the little boys' tutors likewise.  But when he is\nthrashed--so Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid has promised me--I shall have\nthe thrashing of him:  and if I don't lay it on with a will it's a\npity.\"\n\nTom went off:  but rather slowly and surlily; for he was somewhat\nminded to face this same Examiner-of-all-Examiners, who came\nstriding among the poor turnips, binding heavy burdens and grievous\nto be borne, and laying them on little children's shoulders, like\nthe Scribes and Pharisees of old, and not touching the same with\none of his fingers; for he had plenty of money, and a fine house to\nlive in, and so forth; which was more than the poor little turnips\nhad.\n\nBut when he got near, he looked so big and burly and dictatorial,\nand shouted so loud to Tom, to come and be examined, that Tom ran\nfor his life, and the dog too.  And really it was time; for the\npoor turnips, in their hurry and fright, crammed themselves so fast\nto be ready for the Examiner, that they burst and popped by dozens\nall round him, till the place sounded like Aldershot on a field-\nday, and Tom thought he should be blown into the air, dog and all.\n\nAs he went down to the shore he passed the poor turnip's new tomb.\nBut Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid had taken away the epitaph about talents\nand precocity and development, and put up one of her own instead\nwhich Tom thought much more sensible:-\n\n\n\"Instruction sore long time I bore,\nAnd cramming was in vain;\nTill heaven did please my woes to ease\nWith water on the brain.\"\n\n\nSo Tom jumped into the sea, and swam on his way, singing:-\n\n\n\"Farewell, Tomtoddies all; I thank my stars\nThat nought I know save those three royal r's:\nReading and riting sure, with rithmetick,\nWill help a lad of sense through thin and thick.\"\n\n\nWhereby you may see that Tom was no poet:  but no more was John\nBunyan, though he was as wise a man as you will meet in a month of\nSundays.\n\nAnd next he came to Oldwivesfabledom, where the folks were all\nheathens, and worshipped a howling ape.  And there he found a\nlittle boy sitting in the middle of the road, and crying bitterly.\n\n\"What are you crying for?\" said Tom.\n\n\"Because I am not as frightened as I could wish to be.\"\n\n\"Not frightened?  You are a queer little chap:  but, if you want to\nbe frightened, here goes--Boo!\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the little boy, \"that is very kind of you; but I don't\nfeel that it has made any impression.\"\n\nTom offered to upset him, punch him, stamp on him, fettle him over\nthe head with a brick, or anything else whatsoever which would give\nhim the slightest comfort.\n\nBut he only thanked Tom very civilly, in fine long words which he\nhad heard other folk use, and which therefore, he thought were fit\nand proper to use himself; and cried on till his papa and mamma\ncame, and sent off for the Powwow man immediately.  And a very\ngood-natured gentleman and lady they were, though they were\nheathens; and talked quite pleasantly to Tom about his travels,\ntill the Powwow man arrived, with his thunderbox under his arm.\n\nAnd a well-fed, ill-favoured gentleman he was, as ever served Her\nMajesty at Portland.  Tom was a little frightened at first; for he\nthought it was Grimes.  But he soon saw his mistake:  for Grimes\nalways looked a man in the face; and this fellow never did.  And\nwhen he spoke, it was fire and smoke; and when he sneezed, it was\nsquibs and crackers; and when he cried (which he did whenever it\npaid him), it was boiling pitch; and some of it was sure to stick.\n\n\"Here we are again!\" cried he, like the clown in a pantomime.  \"So\nyou can't feel frightened, my little dear--eh?  I'll do that for\nyou.  I'll make an impression on you!  Yah!  Boo!  Whirroo!\nHullabaloo!\"\n\nAnd he rattled, thumped, brandished his thunder-box, yelled,\nshouted, raved, roared, stamped, and danced corrobory like any\nblack fellow; and then he touched a spring in the thunderbox, and\nout popped turnip-ghosts and magic-lanthorns and pasteboard bogies\nand spring-heeled Jacks, and sallaballas, with such a horrid din,\nclatter, clank, roll, rattle, and roar, that the little boy turned\nup the whites of his eyes, and fainted right away.\n\nAnd at that his poor heathen papa and mamma were as much delighted\nas if they had found a gold mine; and fell down upon their knees\nbefore the Powwow man, and gave him a palanquin with a pole of\nsolid silver and curtains of cloth of gold; and carried him about\nin it on their own backs:  but as soon as they had taken him up,\nthe pole stuck to their shoulders, and they could not set him down\nany more, but carried him on willynilly, as Sinbad carried the old\nman of the sea:  which was a pitiable sight to see; for the father\nwas a very brave officer, and wore two swords and a blue button;\nand the mother was as pretty a lady as ever had pinched feet like a\nChinese.  But you see, they had chosen to do a foolish thing just\nonce too often; so, by the laws of Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, they had\nto go on doing it whether they chose or not, till the coming of the\nCocqcigrues.\n\nAh! don't you wish that some one would go and convert those poor\nheathens, and teach them not to frighten their little children into\nfits?\n\n\"Now, then,\" said the Powwow man to Tom, \"wouldn't you like to be\nfrightened, my little dear?  For I can see plainly that you are a\nvery wicked, naughty, graceless, reprobate boy.\"\n\n\"You're another,\" quoth Tom, very sturdily.  And when the man ran\nat him, and cried \"Boo!\"  Tom ran at him in return, and cried\n\"Boo!\" likewise, right in his face, and set the little dog upon\nhim; and at his legs the dog went.\n\nAt which, if you will believe it, the fellow turned tail,\nthunderbox and all, with a \"Woof!\" like an old sow on the common;\nand ran for his life, screaming, \"Help! thieves! murder! fire!  He\nis going to kill me!  I am a ruined man!  He will murder me; and\nbreak, burn, and destroy my precious and invaluable thunderbox; and\nthen you will have no more thunder-showers in the land.  Help!\nhelp! help!\"\n\nAt which the papa and mamma and all the people of Oldwivesfabledom\nflew at Tom, shouting, \"Oh, the wicked, impudent, hard-hearted,\ngraceless boy!  Beat him, kick him, shoot him, drown him, hang him,\nburn him!\" and so forth:  but luckily they had nothing to shoot,\nhang, or burn him with, for the fairies had hid all the killing-\ntackle out of the way a little while before; so they could only\npelt him with stones; and some of the stones went clean through\nhim, and came out the other side.  But he did not mind that a bit;\nfor the holes closed up again as fast as they were made, because he\nwas a water-baby.  However, he was very glad when he was safe out\nof the country, for the noise there made him all but deaf.\n\nThen he came to a very quiet place, called Leaveheavenalone.  And\nthere the sun was drawing water out of the sea to make steam-\nthreads, and the wind was twisting them up to make cloud-patterns,\ntill they had worked between them the loveliest wedding veil of\nChantilly lace, and hung it up in their own Crystal Palace for any\none to buy who could afford it; while the good old sea never\ngrudged, for she knew they would pay her back honestly.  So the sun\nspan, and the wind wove, and all went well with the great steam-\nloom; as is likely, considering--and considering--and considering -\n\nAnd at last, after innumerable adventures, each more wonderful than\nthe last, he saw before him a huge building, much bigger, and--what\nis most surprising--a little uglier than a certain new lunatic\nasylum, but not built quite of the same materials.  None of it, at\nleast--or, indeed, for aught that I ever saw, any part of any other\nbuilding whatsoever--is cased with nine-inch brick inside and out,\nand filled up with rubble between the walls, in order that any\ngentleman who has been confined during Her Majesty's pleasure may\nbe unconfined during his own pleasure, and take a walk in the\nneighbouring park to improve his spirits, after an hour's light and\nwholesome labour with his dinner-fork or one of the legs of his\niron bedstead.  No.  The walls of this building were built on an\nentirely different principle, which need not be described, as it\nhas not yet been discovered.\n\nTom walked towards this great building, wondering what it was, and\nhaving a strange fancy that he might find Mr. Grimes inside it,\ntill he saw running toward him, and shouting \"Stop!\" three or four\npeople, who, when they came nearer, were nothing else than\npolicemen's truncheons, running along without legs or arms.\n\nTom was not astonished.  He was long past that.  Besides, he had\nseen the naviculae in the water move nobody knows how, a hundred\ntimes, without arms, or legs, or anything to stand in their stead.\nNeither was he frightened for he had been doing no harm.\n\nSo he stopped; and, when the foremost truncheon came up and asked\nhis business, he showed Mother Carey's pass; and the truncheon\nlooked at it in the oddest fashion; for he had one eye in the\nmiddle of his upper end, so that when he looked at anything, being\nquite stiff, he had to slope himself, and poke himself, till it was\na wonder why he did not tumble over; but, being quite full of the\nspirit of justice (as all policemen, and their truncheons, ought to\nbe), he was always in a position of stable equilibrium, whichever\nway he put himself.\n\n\"All right--pass on,\" said he at last.  And then he added:  \"I had\nbetter go with you, young man.\"  And Tom had no objection, for such\ncompany was both respectable and safe; so the truncheon coiled its\nthong neatly round its handle, to prevent tripping itself up--for\nthe thong had got loose in running--and marched on by Tom's side.\n\n\"Why have you no policeman to carry you?\" asked Tom, after a while.\n\n\"Because we are not like those clumsy-made truncheons in the land-\nworld, which cannot go without having a whole man to carry them\nabout.  We do our own work for ourselves; and do it very well,\nthough I say it who should not.\"\n\n\"Then why have you a thong to your handle?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"To hang ourselves up by, of course, when we are off duty.\"\n\nTom had got his answer, and had no more to say, till they came up\nto the great iron door of the prison.  And there the truncheon\nknocked twice, with its own head.\n\nA wicket in the door opened, and out looked a tremendous old brass\nblunderbuss charged up to the muzzle with slugs, who was the\nporter; and Tom started back a little at the sight of him.\n\n\"What case is this?\" he asked in a deep voice, out of his broad\nbell mouth.\n\n\"If you please, sir, it is no case; only a young gentleman from her\nladyship, who wants to see Grimes, the master-sweep.\"\n\n\"Grimes?\" said the blunderbuss.  And he pulled in his muzzle,\nperhaps to look over his prison-lists.\n\n\"Grimes is up chimney No. 345,\" he said from inside.  \"So the young\ngentleman had better go on to the roof.\"\n\nTom looked up at the enormous wall, which seemed at least ninety\nmiles high, and wondered how he should ever get up:  but, when he\nhinted that to the truncheon, it settled the matter in a moment.\nFor it whisked round, and gave him such a shove behind as sent him\nup to the roof in no time, with his little dog under his arm.\n\nAnd there he walked along the leads, till he met another truncheon,\nand told him his errand.\n\n\"Very good,\" it said.  \"Come along:  but it will be of no use.  He\nis the most unremorseful, hard-hearted, foul-mouthed fellow I have\nin charge; and thinks about nothing but beer and pipes, which are\nnot allowed here, of course.\"\n\nSo they walked along over the leads, and very sooty they were, and\nTom thought the chimneys must want sweeping very much.  But he was\nsurprised to see that the soot did not stick to his feet, or dirty\nthem in the least.  Neither did the live coals, which were lying\nabout in plenty, burn him; for, being a water-baby, his radical\nhumours were of a moist and cold nature, as you may read at large\nin Lemnius, Cardan, Van Helmont, and other gentlemen, who knew as\nmuch as they could, and no man can know more.\n\nAnd at last they came to chimney No. 345.  Out of the top of it,\nhis head and shoulders just showing, stuck poor Mr. Grimes, so\nsooty, and bleared, and ugly, that Tom could hardly bear to look at\nhim.  And in his mouth was a pipe; but it was not a-light; though\nhe was pulling at it with all his might.\n\n\"Attention, Mr. Grimes,\" said the truncheon; \"here is a gentleman\ncome to see you.\"\n\nBut Mr. Grimes only said bad words; and kept grumbling, \"My pipe\nwon't draw.  My pipe won't draw.\"\n\n\"Keep a civil tongue, and attend!\" said the truncheon; and popped\nup just like Punch, hitting Grimes such a crack over the head with\nitself, that his brains rattled inside like a dried walnut in its\nshell.  He tried to get his hands out, and rub the place:  but he\ncould not, for they were stuck fast in the chimney.  Now he was\nforced to attend.\n\n\"Hey!\" he said, \"why, it's Tom!  I suppose you have come here to\nlaugh at me, you spiteful little atomy?\"\n\nTom assured him he had not, but only wanted to help him.\n\n\"I don't want anything except beer, and that I can't get; and a\nlight to this bothering pipe, and that I can't get either.\"\n\n\"I'll get you one,\" said Tom; and he took up a live coal (there\nwere plenty lying about) and put it to Grimes' pipe:  but it went\nout instantly.\n\n\"It's no use,\" said the truncheon, leaning itself up against the\nchimney and looking on.  \"I tell you, it is no use.  His heart is\nso cold that it freezes everything that comes near him.  You will\nsee that presently, plain enough.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, it's my fault.  Everything's always my fault,\" said\nGrimes.  \"Now don't go to hit me again\" (for the truncheon started\nupright, and looked very wicked); \"you know, if my arms were only\nfree, you daren't hit me then.\"\n\nThe truncheon leant back against the chimney, and took no notice of\nthe personal insult, like a well-trained policeman as it was,\nthough he was ready enough to avenge any transgression against\nmorality or order.\n\n\"But can't I help you in any other way?  Can't I help you to get\nout of this chimney?\" said Tom.\n\n\"No,\" interposed the truncheon; \"he has come to the place where\neverybody must help themselves; and he will find it out, I hope,\nbefore he has done with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Grimes, \"of course it's me.  Did I ask to be\nbrought here into the prison?  Did I ask to be set to sweep your\nfoul chimneys?  Did I ask to have lighted straw put under me to\nmake me go up?  Did I ask to stick fast in the very first chimney\nof all, because it was so shamefully clogged up with soot?  Did I\nask to stay here--I don't know how long--a hundred years, I do\nbelieve, and never get my pipe, nor my beer, nor nothing fit for a\nbeast, let alone a man?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered a solemn voice behind.  \"No more did Tom, when you\nbehaved to him in the very same way.\"\n\nIt was Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid.  And, when the truncheon saw her, it\nstarted bolt upright--Attention!--and made such a low bow, that if\nit had not been full of the spirit of justice, it must have tumbled\non its end, and probably hurt its one eye.  And Tom made his bow\ntoo.\n\n\"Oh, ma'am,\" he said, \"don't think about me; that's all past and\ngone, and good times and bad times and all times pass over.  But\nmay not I help poor Mr. Grimes?  Mayn't I try and get some of these\nbricks away, that he may move his arms?\"\n\n\"You may try, of course,\" she said.\n\nSo Tom pulled and tugged at the bricks:  but he could not move one.\nAnd then he tried to wipe Mr. Grimes' face:  but the soot would not\ncome off.\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" he said.  \"I have come all this way, through all these\nterrible places, to help you, and now I am of no use at all.\"\n\n\"You had best leave me alone,\" said Grimes; \"you are a good-natured\nforgiving little chap, and that's truth; but you'd best be off.\nThe hail's coming on soon, and it will beat the eyes out of your\nlittle head.\"\n\n\"What hail?\"\n\n\"Why, hail that falls every evening here; and, till it comes close\nto me, it's like so much warm rain:  but then it turns to hail over\nmy head, and knocks me about like small shot.\"\n\n\"That hail will never come any more,\" said the strange lady.  \"I\nhave told you before what it was.  It was your mother's tears,\nthose which she shed when she prayed for you by her bedside; but\nyour cold heart froze it into hail.  But she is gone to heaven now,\nand will weep no more for her graceless son.\"\n\nThen Grimes was silent awhile; and then he looked very sad.\n\n\"So my old mother's gone, and I never there to speak to her!  Ah! a\ngood woman she was, and might have been a happy one, in her little\nschool there in Vendale, if it hadn't been for me and my bad ways.\"\n\n\"Did she keep the school in Vendale?\" asked Tom.  And then he told\nGrimes all the story of his going to her house, and how she could\nnot abide the sight of a chimney-sweep, and then how kind she was,\nand how he turned into a water-baby.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Grimes, \"good reason she had to hate the sight of a\nchimney-sweep.  I ran away from her and took up with the sweeps,\nand never let her know where I was, nor sent her a penny to help\nher, and now it's too late--too late!\" said Mr. Grimes.\n\nAnd he began crying and blubbering like a great baby, till his pipe\ndropped out of his mouth, and broke all to bits.\n\n\"Oh, dear, if I was but a little chap in Vendale again, to see the\nclear beck, and the apple-orchard, and the yew-hedge, how different\nI would go on!  But it's too late now.  So you go along, you kind\nlittle chap, and don't stand to look at a man crying, that's old\nenough to be your father, and never feared the face of man, nor of\nworse neither.  But I'm beat now, and beat I must be.  I've made my\nbed, and I must lie on it.  Foul I would be, and foul I am, as an\nIrishwoman said to me once; and little I heeded it.  It's all my\nown fault:  but it's too late.\"  And he cried so bitterly that Tom\nbegan crying too.\n\n\"Never too late,\" said the fairy, in such a strange soft new voice\nthat Tom looked up at her; and she was so beautiful for the moment,\nthat Tom half fancied she was her sister.\n\nNo more was it too late.  For, as poor Grimes cried and blubbered\non, his own tears did what his mother's could not do, and Tom's\ncould not do, and nobody's on earth could do for him; for they\nwashed the soot off his face and off his clothes; and then they\nwashed the mortar away from between the bricks; and the chimney\ncrumbled down; and Grimes began to get out of it.\n\nUp jumped the truncheon, and was going to hit him on the crown a\ntremendous thump, and drive him down again like a cork into a\nbottle.  But the strange lady put it aside.\n\n\"Will you obey me if I give you a chance?\"\n\n\"As you please, ma'am.  You're stronger than me--that I know too\nwell, and wiser than me, I know too well also.  And, as for being\nmy own master, I've fared ill enough with that as yet.  So whatever\nyour ladyship pleases to order me; for I'm beat, and that's the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Be it so then--you may come out.  But remember, disobey me again,\nand into a worse place still you go.\"\n\n\"I beg pardon ma'am, but I never disobeyed you that I know of.  I\nnever had the honour of setting eyes upon you till I came to these\nugly quarters.\"\n\n\"Never saw me?  Who said to you, Those that will be foul, foul they\nwill be?\"\n\nGrimes looked up; and Tom looked up too; for the voice was that of\nthe Irishwoman who met them the day that they went out together to\nHarthover.  \"I gave you your warning then:  but you gave it\nyourself a thousand times before and since.  Every bad word that\nyou said--every cruel and mean thing that you did--every time that\nyou got tipsy--every day that you went dirty--you were disobeying\nme, whether you knew it or not.\"\n\n\"If I'd only known, ma'am--\"\n\n\"You knew well enough that you were disobeying something, though\nyou did not know it was me.  But come out and take your chance.\nPerhaps it may be your last.\"\n\nSo Grimes stepped out of the chimney, and really, if it had not\nbeen for the scars on his face, he looked as clean and respectable\nas a master-sweep need look.\n\n\"Take him away,\" said she to the truncheon, \"and give him his\nticket-of-leave.\"\n\n\"And what is he to do, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Get him to sweep out the crater of Etna; he will find some very\nsteady men working out their time there, who will teach him his\nbusiness:  but mind, if that crater gets choked again, and there is\nan earthquake in consequence, bring them all to me, and I shall\ninvestigate the case very severely.\"\n\nSo the truncheon marched off Mr. Grimes, looking as meek as a\ndrowned worm.\n\nAnd for aught I know, or do not know, he is sweeping the crater of\nEtna to this very day.\n\n\"And now,\" said the fairy to Tom, \"your work here is done.  You may\nas well go back again.\"\n\n\"I should be glad enough to go,\" said Tom, \"but how am I to get up\nthat great hole again, now the steam has stopped blowing?\"\n\n\"I will take you up the backstairs:  but I must bandage your eyes\nfirst; for I never allow anybody to see those backstairs of mine.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall not tell anybody about them, ma'am, if you bid\nme not.\"\n\n\"Aha!  So you think, my little man.  But you would soon forget your\npromise if you got back into the land-world.  For, if people only\nonce found out that you had been up my backstairs, you would have\nall the fine ladies kneeling to you, and the rich men emptying\ntheir purses before you, and statesmen offering you place and\npower; and young and old, rich and poor, crying to you, 'Only tell\nus the great backstairs secret, and we will be your slaves; we will\nmake you lord, king, emperor, bishop, archbishop, pope, if you\nlike--only tell us the secret of the backstairs.  For thousands of\nyears we have been paying, and petting, and obeying, and\nworshipping quacks who told us they had the key of the backstairs,\nand could smuggle us up them; and in spite of all our\ndisappointments, we will honour, and glorify, and adore, and\nbeatify, and translate, and apotheotise you likewise, on the chance\nof your knowing something about the backstairs, that we may all go\non pilgrimage to it; and, even if we cannot get up it, lie at the\nfoot of it, and cry -\n\n\n'Oh, backstairs,\nprecious backstairs,\ninvaluable backstairs,\nrequisite backstairs,\nnecessary backstairs,\ngood-natured backstairs,\ncosmopolitan backstairs,\ncomprehensive backstairs,\naccommodating backstairs,\nwell-bred backstairs,\ncommercial backstairs,\neconomical backstairs,\npractical backstairs,\nlogical backstairs,\ndeductive backstairs,\ncomfortable backstairs,\nhumane backstairs,\nreasonable backstairs,\nlong-sought backstairs,\ncoveted backstairs,\naristocratic backstairs,\nrespectable backstairs,\ngentlenmanlike backstairs,\nladylike backstairs,\northodox backstairs,\nprobable backstairs,\ncredible backstairs,\ndemonstrable backstairs,\nirrefragable backstairs,\npotent backstairs,\nall-but-omnipotent backstairs,\n&c.\n\n\nSave us from the consequences of our own actions, and from the\ncruel fairy, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid!'  Do not you think that you\nwould be a little tempted then to tell what you know, laddie?\"\n\nTom thought so certainly.  \"But why do they want so to know about\nthe backstairs?\" asked he, being a little frightened at the long\nwords, and not understanding them the least; as, indeed, he was not\nmeant to do, or you either.\n\n\"That I shall not tell you.  I never put things into little folks'\nheads which are but too likely to come there of themselves.  So\ncome--now I must bandage your eyes.\"  So she tied the bandage on\nhis eyes with one hand, and with the other she took it off.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"you are safe up the stairs.\"  Tom opened his eyes\nvery wide, and his mouth too; for he had not, as he thought, moved\na single step.  But, when he looked round him, there could be no\ndoubt that he was safe up the backstairs, whatsoever they may be,\nwhich no man is going to tell you, for the plain reason that no man\nknows.\n\nThe first thing which Tom saw was the black cedars, high and sharp\nagainst the rosy dawn; and St. Brandan's Isle reflected double in\nthe still broad silver sea.  The wind sang softly in the cedars,\nand the water sang among the eaves:  the sea-birds sang as they\nstreamed out into the ocean, and the land-birds as they built among\nthe boughs; and the air was so full of song that it stirred St.\nBrandan and his hermits, as they slumbered in the shade; and they\nmoved their good old lips, and sang their morning hymn amid their\ndreams.  But among all the songs one came across the water more\nsweet and clear than all; for it was the song of a young girl's\nvoice.\n\nAnd what was the song which she sang?  Ah, my little man, I am too\nold to sing that song, and you too young to understand it.  But\nhave patience, and keep your eye single, and your hands clean, and\nyou will learn some day to sing it yourself, without needing any\nman to teach you.\n\nAnd as Tom neared the island, there sat upon a rock the most\ngraceful creature that ever was seen, looking down, with her chin\nupon her hand, and paddling with her feet in the water.  And when\nthey came to her she looked up, and behold it was Ellie.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Ellie,\" said he, \"how you are grown!\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom,\" said she, \"how you are grown too!\"\n\nAnd no wonder; they were both quite grown up--he into a tall man,\nand she into a beautiful woman.\n\n\"Perhaps I may be grown,\" she said.  \"I have had time enough; for I\nhave been sitting here waiting for you many a hundred years, till I\nthought you were never coming.\"\n\n\"Many a hundred years?\" thought Tom; but he had seen so much in his\ntravels that he had quite given up being astonished; and, indeed,\nhe could think of nothing but Ellie.  So he stood and looked at\nEllie, and Ellie looked at him; and they liked the employment so\nmuch that they stood and looked for seven years more, and neither\nspoke nor stirred.\n\nAt last they heard the fairy say:  \"Attention, children.  Are you\nnever going to look at me again?\"\n\n\"We have been looking at you all this while,\" they said.  And so\nthey thought they had been.\n\n\"Then look at me once more,\" said she.\n\nThey looked--and both of them cried out at once, \"Oh, who are you,\nafter all?\"\n\n\"You are our dear Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby.\"\n\n\"No, you are good Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid; but you are grown quite\nbeautiful now!\"\n\n\"To you,\" said the fairy.  \"But look again.\"\n\n\"You are Mother Carey,\" said Tom, in a very low, solemn voice; for\nhe had found out something which made him very happy, and yet\nfrightened him more than all that he had ever seen.\n\n\"But you are grown quite young again.\"\n\n\"To you,\" said the fairy.  \"Look again.\"\n\n\"You are the Irishwoman who met me the day I went to Harthover!\"\n\nAnd when they looked she was neither of them, and yet all of them\nat once.\n\n\"My name is written in my eyes, if you have eyes to see it there.\"\n\nAnd they looked into her great, deep, soft eyes, and they changed\nagain and again into every hue, as the light changes in a diamond.\n\n\"Now read my name,\" said she, at last.\n\nAnd her eyes flashed, for one moment, clear, white, blazing light:\nbut the children could not read her name; for they were dazzled,\nand hid their faces in their hands.\n\n\"Not yet, young things, not yet,\" said she, smiling; and then she\nturned to Ellie.\n\n\"You may take him home with you now on Sundays, Ellie.  He has won\nhis spurs in the great battle, and become fit to go with you and be\na man; because he has done the thing he did not like.\"\n\nSo Tom went home with Ellie on Sundays, and sometimes on week-days,\ntoo; and he is now a great man of science, and can plan railroads,\nand steam-engines, and electric telegraphs, and rifled guns, and so\nforth; and knows everything about everything, except why a hen's\negg don't turn into a crocodile, and two or three other little\nthings which no one will know till the coming of the Cocqcigrues.\nAnd all this from what he learnt when he was a water-baby,\nunderneath the sea.\n\n\"And of course Tom married Ellie?\"\n\nMy dear child, what a silly notion!  Don't you know that no one\never marries in a fairy tale, under the rank of a prince or a\nprincess?\n\n\"And Tom's dog?\"\n\nOh, you may see him any clear night in July; for the old dog-star\nwas so worn out by the last three hot summers that there have been\nno dog-days since; so that they had to take him down and put Tom's\ndog up in his place.  Therefore, as new brooms sweep clean, we may\nhope for some warm weather this year.  And that is the end of my\nstory.\n\n\n\nMORAL.\n\n\n\nAnd now, my dear little man, what should we learn from this\nparable?\n\nWe should learn thirty-seven or thirty-nine things, I am not\nexactly sure which:  but one thing, at least, we may learn, and\nthat is this--when we see efts in the pond, never to throw stones\nat them, or catch them with crooked pins, or put them into\nvivariums with sticklebacks, that the sticklebacks may prick them\nin their poor little stomachs, and make them jump out of the glass\ninto somebody's work-box, and so come to a bad end.  For these efts\nare nothing else but the water-babies who are stupid and dirty, and\nwill not learn their lessons and keep themselves clean; and,\ntherefore (as comparative anatomists will tell you fifty years\nhence, though they are not learned enough to tell you now), their\nskulls grow flat, their jaws grow out, and their brains grow small,\nand their tails grow long, and they lose all their ribs (which I am\nsure you would not like to do), and their skins grow dirty and\nspotted, and they never get into the clear rivers, much less into\nthe great wide sea, but hang about in dirty ponds, and live in the\nmud, and eat worms, as they deserve to do.\n\nBut that is no reason why you should ill-use them:  but only why\nyou should pity them, and be kind to them, and hope that some day\nthey will wake up, and be ashamed of their nasty, dirty, lazy,\nstupid life, and try to amend, and become something better once\nmore.  For, perhaps, if they do so, then after 379,423 years, nine\nmonths, thirteen days, two hours, and twenty-one minutes (for aught\nthat appears to the contrary), if they work very hard and wash very\nhard all that time, their brains may grow bigger, and their jaws\ngrow smaller, and their ribs come back, and their tails wither off,\nand they will turn into water-babies again, and perhaps after that\ninto land-babies; and after that perhaps into grown men.\n\nYou know they won't?  Very well, I daresay you know best.  But you\nsee, some folks have a great liking for those poor little efts.\nThey never did anybody any harm, or could if they tried; and their\nonly fault is, that they do no good--any more than some thousands\nof their betters.  But what with ducks, and what with pike, and\nwhat with sticklebacks, and what with water-beetles, and what with\nnaughty boys, they are \"sae sair hadden doun,\" as the Scotsmen say,\nthat it is a wonder how they live; and some folks can't help\nhoping, with good Bishop Butler, that they may have another chance,\nto make things fair and even, somewhere, somewhen, somehow.\n\nMeanwhile, do you learn your lessons, and thank God that you have\nplenty of cold water to wash in; and wash in it too, like a true\nEnglishman.  And then, if my story is not true, something better\nis; and if I am not quite right, still you will be, as long as you\nstick to hard work and cold water.\n\nBut remember always, as I told you at first, that this is all a\nfairy tale, and only fun and pretence:  and, therefore, you are not\nto believe a word of it, even if it is true.\n\n",
