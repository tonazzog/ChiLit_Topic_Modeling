And for the fifth summer in succession,\nStalky, McTurk, and Beetle (this was before they reached the dignity of\na study) had built like beavers a place of retreat and meditation, where\nthey smoked.\n\nNow, there was nothing in their characters as known to Mr. Prout,\ntheir house-master, at all commanding respect; nor did Foxy, the\nsubtle red-haired school Sergeant, trust them. His business was to wear\ntennis-shoes, carry binoculars, and swoop hawklike upon evil boys. Had\nhe taken the field alone, that hut would have been raided, for Foxy\nknew the manners of his quarry; but Providence moved Mr. Prout,\nwhose school-name, derived from the size of his feet, was Hoofer, to\ninvestigate on his own account; and it was the cautious Stalky who\nfound the track of his pugs on the very floor of their lair one peaceful\nafternoon when Stalky would fain have forgotten Prout and his works in\na volume of Surtees and a new briar-wood pipe. Crusoe, at sight of the\nfootprint, did not act more swiftly than Stalky. He removed the pipes,\nswept up all loose match-ends, and departed to warn Beetle and McTurk.\n\nBut it was characteristic of the boy that he did not approach his allies\ntill he had met and conferred with little Hartopp, President of the\nNatural History Society, an institution which Stalky held in contempt,\nHartopp was more than surprised when the boy meekly, as he knew how,\nbegged to propose himself, Beetle, and McTurk as candidates; confessed\nto a long-smothered interest in first-flowerings, early butterflies, and\nnew arrivals, and volunteered, if Mr. Hartopp saw fit, to enter on the\nnew life at once. Being a master, Hartopp was suspicious; but he was\nalso an enthusiast, and his gentle little soul had been galled by\nchance-heard remarks from the three, and specially Beetle. So he was\ngracious to that repentant sinner, and entered the three names in his\nbook.\n\nThen, and not till then, did Stalky seek Beetle and McTurk in their\nhouse form-room. They were stowing away books for a quiet afternoon in\nthe furze, which they called the “wuzzy.”\n\n“All up,” said Stalky, serenely. “I spotted Heffy’s fairy feet round our\nhut after dinner. ‘Blessing they’re so big.”\n\n“Con-found! Did you hide our pipes?” said Beetle.\n\n“Oh, no. Left ‘em in the middle of the hut, of course. What a blind ass\nyou are, Beetle! D’you think nobody thinks but yourself? Well, we can’t\nuse the hut any more. Hoofer will be watchin’ it.”\n\n“‘Bother! Likewise blow!’” said McTurk thoughtfully, unpacking the\nvolumes with which his chest was cased. The boys carried their libraries\nbetween their belt and their collar. “Nice job! This means we’re under\nsuspicion for the rest of the term.”\n\n“Why? All that Heffy has found is a hut. He and Foxy will watch it. It’s\nnothing to do with us; only we mustn’t be seen that way for a bit.”\n\n“Yes, and where else are we to go?” said Beetle. “You chose that place,\ntoo--an’--an’ I wanted to read this afternoon.”\n\nStalky sat on a desk drumming his heels on the form.\n\n“You’re a despondin’ brute, Beetle. Sometimes I think I shall have to\ndrop you altogether. Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky forget you yet?\n_His rebus infectis_--after I’d seen Heffy’s man-tracks marchin’\nround our hut, I found little Hartopp--_destricto ense_--wavin’ a\nbutterfly-net. I conciliated Hartopp. ‘Told him that you’d read papers\nto the Bug-hunters if he’d let you join, Beetle. ‘Told him you liked\nbutterflies, Turkey. Anyhow, I soothed the Hartoffles, and we’re\nBug-hunters now.”\n\n“What’s the good of that?” said Beetle.\n\n“Oh, Turkey, kick him!”\n\nIn the interests of science bounds were largely relaxed for the members\nof the Natural History Society. They could wander, if they kept clear\nof all houses, practically where they chose; Mr. Hartopp holding himself\nresponsible for their good conduct.\n\nBeetle began to see this as McTurk began the kicking.\n\n“I’m an ass, Stalky!” he said, guarding the afflicted part. “_Pax_,\nTurkey. I’m an ass.”\n\n“Don’t stop, Turkey. Isn’t your Uncle Stalky a great man?”\n\n“Great man,” said Beetle.\n\n“All the same bug-huntin’s a filthy business,” said McTurk. “How the\ndeuce does one begin?”\n\n“This way,” said Stalky, turning to some fags’ lockers behind him. “Fags\nare dabs at Natural History. Here’s young Braybrooke’s botany-case.” He\nflung out a tangle of decayed roots and adjusted the slide. “‘Gives one\nno end of a professional air, I think. Here’s Clay Minor’s geological\nhammer. Beetle can carry that. Turkey, you’d better covet a\nbutterfly-net from somewhere.”\n\n“I’m blowed if I do,” said McTurk, simply, with immense feeling.\n“Beetle, give me the hammer.”\n\n“All right. I’m not proud. Chuck us down that net on top of the lockers,\nStalky.”\n\n“That’s all right. It’s a collapsible jamboree, too. Beastly luxurious\ndogs these fags are. Built like a fishin’-rod. ‘Pon my sainted Sam,\nbut we look the complete Bug-hunters! Now, listen to your Uncle Stalky!\nWe’re goin’ along the cliffs after butterflies. Very few chaps come\nthere. We’re goin’ to leg it, too. You’d better leave your book behind.”\n\n“Not much!” said Beetle, firmly. “I’m not goin’ to be done out of my fun\nfor a lot of filthy butterflies.”\n\n“Then you’ll sweat horrid. You’d better carry my Jorrocks. ‘Twon’t make\nyou any hotter.”\n\nThey all sweated; for Stalky led them at a smart trot west away along\nthe cliffs under the furze-hills, crossing combe after gorzy combe. They\ntook no heed to flying rabbits or fluttering fritillaries, and all that\nTurkey said of geology was utterly unquotable.\n\n“Are we going to Clovelly?” he puffed at last, and they flung themselves\ndown on the short, springy turf between the drone of the sea below and\nthe light summer wind among the inland trees. They were looking into a\ncombe half full of old, high furze in gay bloom that ran up to a fringe\nof brambles and a dense wood of mixed timber and hollies. It was as\nthough one-half the combe were filled with golden fire to the cliff’s\nedge. The side nearest to them was open grass, and fairly bristled with\nnotice-boards.\n\n“Fee-rocious old cove, this,” said Stalky, reading the nearest.\n“‘_Prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law_. G. M. Dabney, Col.,\nJ.P.,’ an’ all the rest of it. ‘Don’t seem to me that any chap in his\nsenses would trespass here, does it?”\n\n“You’ve got to prove damage ‘fore you can prosecute for anything! ‘Can’t\nprosecute for trespass,” said McTurk, whose father held many acres in\nIreland. “That’s all rot!”\n\n“Glad of that, ‘cause this looks like what we wanted. Not straight\nacross, Beetle, you blind lunatic! Anyone could spot us half a mile off.\nThis way; and furl up your beastly butterfly-net.”\n\nBeetle disconnected the ring, thrust the net into a pocket, shut up\nthe handle to a two-foot stave, and slid the cane-ring round his waist.\nStalky led inland to the wood, which was, perhaps, a quarter of a mile\nfrom the sea, and reached the fringe of the brambles.\n\n“_Now_ we can get straight down through the furze, and never show up\nat all,” said the tactician. “Beetle, go ahead and explore. Snf! Snf!\nBeastly stink of fox somewhere!”\n\nOn all fours, save when he clung to his spectacles, Beetle wormed into\nthe gorse, and presently announced between grunts of pain that he had\nfound a very fair fox-track. This was well for Beetle, since Stalky\npinched him _a tergo_. Down that tunnel they crawled. It was evidently\na highway for the inhabitants of the combe; and, to their inexpressible\njoy, ended, at the very edge of the cliff, in a few square feet of dry\nturf walled and roofed with impenetrable gorse.\n\n“By gum! There isn’t a single thing to do except lie down,” said Stalky,\nreturning a knife to his pocket. “Look here!”\n\nHe parted the tough stems before him, and it was as a window opened on\na far view of Lundy, and the deep sea sluggishly nosing the pebbles a\ncouple of hundred feet below. They could hear young jackdaws squawking\non the ledges, the hiss and jabber of a nest of hawks somewhere out of\nsight; and, with great deliberation, Stalky spat on to the back of a\nyoung rabbit sunning himself far down where only a cliff-rabbit could\nhave found foot-hold. Great gray and black gulls screamed against the\njackdaws; the heavy-scented acres of bloom round them were alive with\nlow-nesting birds, singing or silent as the shadow of the wheeling hawks\npassed and returned; and on the naked turf across the combe rabbits\nthumped and frolicked.\n\n“Whew! What a place! Talk of natural history; this is it,” said Stalky,\nfilling himself a pipe. “Isn’t it scrumptious? Good old sea!” He spat\nagain approvingly, and was silent.\n\nMcTurk and Beetle had taken out their books and were lying on their\nstomachs, chin in hand. The sea snored and gurgled; the birds, scattered\nfor the moment by these new animals, returned to their businesses, and\nthe boys read on in the rich, warm, sleepy silence.\n\n“Hullo, here’s a keeper,” said Stalky, shutting “Handley Cross”\n cautiously, and peering through the jungle. A man with a gun appeared on\nthe sky-line to the east. “Confound him, he’s going to sit down.”\n\n“He’d swear we were poachin’, too,” said Beetle. “What’s the good of\npheasants’ eggs? They’re always addled, too.”\n\n“Might as well get up to the wood, I think,” said Stalky. “We don’t want\nG. M. Dabney, Col., J.P., to be bothered about us so soon. Up the wuzzy\nand keep quiet! He may have followed us, you know.”\n\nBeetle was already far up the tunnel. They heard him gasp indescribably:\nthere was the crash of a heavy body leaping through the furze.\n\n“Aie! yeou little red rascal. I see yeou!” The keeper threw the gun to\nhis shoulder, and fired both barrels in their direction. The pellets\ndusted the dry stems round them as a big fox plunged between Stalky’s\nlegs, and ran over the cliff-edge.\n\nThey said nothing till they reached the wood, torn, disheveled, hot, but\nunseen.\n\n“Narrow squeak,” said Stalky. “I’ll swear some of the pellets went\nthrough my hair.”\n\n“Did you see him?” said Beetle. “I almost put my hand on him. Wasn’t\nhe a wopper! Didn’t he stink! Hullo, Turkey, what’s the matter? Are you\nhit?”\n\nMcTurk’s lean face had turned pearly white; his mouth, generally half\nopen, was tight shut, and his eyes blazed. They had never seen him like\nthis save once in a sad time of civil war.\n\n“Do you know that that was just as bad as murder?” he said, in a grating\nvoice, as he brushed prickles from his head.\n\n“Well, he didn’t hit us,” said Stalky. “I think it was rather a lark.\nHere, where are you going?”\n\n“I’m going up to the house, if there is one,” said McTurk, pushing\nthrough the hollies. “I am going to tell this Colonel Dabney.”\n\n“Are you crazy? He’ll swear it served us jolly well right. He’ll report\nus. It’ll be a public lickin’. Oh, Turkey, don’t be an ass! Think of\nus!”\n\n“You fool!” said McTurk, turning savagely. “D’you suppose I’m thinkin’\nof _us_? It’s the keeper.”\n\n“He’s cracked,” said Beetle, miserably, as they followed. Indeed, this\nwas a new Turkey--a haughty, angular, nose-lifted Turkey--whom they\naccompanied through a shrubbery on to a lawn, where a white-whiskered\nold gentleman with a cleek was alternately putting and blaspheming\nvigorously.\n\n“Are you Colonel Dabney?” McTurk began in this new creaking voice of\nhis.\n\n“I--I am, and--” his eyes traveled up and down the boy--“who--what the\ndevil d’you want? Ye’ve been disturbing my pheasants. Don’t attempt to\ndeny it. Ye needn’t laugh at it.” (McTurk’s not too lovely features had\ntwisted themselves into a horrible sneer at the word pheasant.) “You’ve\nbeen birds’-nesting. You needn’t hide your hat. I can see that you\nbelong to the College. Don’t attempt to deny it. Ye do! Your name\nand number at once, sir. Ye want to speak to me--Eh? You saw my\nnotice-boards? Must have. Don’t attempt to deny it. Ye did! Damnable, oh\ndamnable!”\n\nHe choked with emotion. McTurk’s heel tapped the lawn and he stuttered a\nlittle--two sure signs that he was losing his temper. But why should he,\nthe offender, be angry?\n\n“Lo-look here, sir. Do--do you shoot foxes? Because, if you don’t, your\nkeeper does. We’ve seen him! I do-don’t care what you call us--but it’s\nan awful thing. It’s the ruin of good feelin’ among neighbors. A ma-man\nought to say once and for all how he stands about preservin’. It’s\nworse than murder, because there’s no legal remedy.” McTurk was quoting\nconfusedly from his father, while the old gentleman made noises in his\nthroat.\n\n“Do you know who I am?” he gurgled at last; Stalky and Beetle quaking.\n\n“No, sorr, nor do I care if ye belonged to the Castle itself. Answer me\nnow, as one gentleman to another. Do ye shoot foxes or do ye not?”\n\nAnd four years before Stalky and Beetle had carefully kicked McTurk out\nof his Irish dialect! Assuredly he had gone mad or taken a sunstroke,\nand as assuredly he would be slain--once by the old gentleman and once\nby the Head. A public licking for the three was the least they could\nexpect. Yet--if their eyes and ears were to be trusted--the old\ngentleman had collapsed. It might be a lull before the storm, but--\n\n“I do not.” He was still gurgling.\n\n“Then you must sack your keeper. He’s not fit to live in the same county\nwith a God-fearin’ fox. An’ a vixen, too--at this time o’ year!”\n\n“Did ye come up on purpose to tell me this?”\n\n“Of course I did, ye silly man,” with a stamp of the foot. “Would you\nnot have done as much for me if you’d seen that thing happen on my land,\nnow?”\n\nForgotten--forgotten was the College and the decency due to elders!\nMcTurk was treading again the barren purple mountains of the rainy\nWest coast, where in his holidays he was viceroy of four thousand naked\nacres, only son of a three-hundred-year-old house, lord of a crazy\nfishing-boat, and the idol of his father’s shiftless tenantry. It was\nthe landed man speaking to his equal--deep calling to deep--and the old\ngentleman acknowledged the cry.\n\n“I apologize,” said he. “I apologize unreservedly--to you, and to the\nOld Country. Now, will you be good enough to tell me your story?”\n\n“We were in your combe,” McTurk began, and he told his tale alternately\nas a schoolboy and, when the iniquity of the thing overcame him, as an\nindignant squire; concluding: “So you see he must be in the habit of\nit. I--we---one never wants to accuse a neighbor’s man; but I took the\nliberty in this case--”\n\n“I see. Quite so. For a reason ye had. Infamous---oh, infamous!”\n\nThe two had fallen into step beside each other on the lawn, and Colonel\nDabney was talking as one man to another. “This comes of promoting a\nfisherman--a fisherman--from his lobster-pots. It’s enough to ruin the\nreputation of an archangel. Don’t attempt to deny it. It is! Your father\nhas brought you up well. He has. I’d much like the pleasure of his\nacquaintance. Very much, indeed. And these young gentlemen? English\nthey are. Don’t attempt to deny it. They came up with you, too?\nExtraordinary! Extraordinary, now! In the present state of education I\nshouldn’t have thought any three boys would be well enough grounded.\nBut out of the mouths of--No--no! Not that by any odds. Don’t attempt to\ndeny it. Ye’re not! Sherry always catches me under the liver, but--beer,\nnow? Eh? What d’you say to beer, and something to eat? It’s long since\nI was a boy--abominable nuisances; but exceptions prove the rule. And a\nvixen, too!” They were fed on the terrace by a gray-haired housekeeper.\nStalky and Beetle merely ate, but McTurk with bright eyes continued a\nfree and lofty discourse; and ever the old gentleman treated him as a\nbrother.\n\n“My dear man, of course ye can come again. Did I not say exceptions\nprove the rule? The lower combe? Man, dear, anywhere ye please, so long\nas you do not disturb my pheasants. The two are not incompatible. Don’t\nattempt to deny it. They’re not! I’ll never allow another gun, though.\nCome and go as ye please. I’ll not see you, and ye needn’t see me. Ye’ve\nbeen well brought up. Another glass of beer, now? I tell you a fisherman\nhe was and a fisherman he shall be to-night again. He shall! Wish\nI could drown him. I’ll convoy you to the Lodge. My people are not\nprecisely--ah--broke to boy, but they’ll know you again.”\n\nHe dismissed them with many compliments by the high Lodge-gate in the\nsplit-oak park palings and they stood still; even Stalky, who had played\nsecond, not to say a dumb, fiddle, regarding McTurk as one from another\nworld. The two glasses of strong home-brewed had brought a melancholy\nupon the boy, for, slowly strolling with his hands in his pockets, he\ncrooned:--“Oh, Paddy dear, and did ye hear the news that’s goin’ round?”\n\nUnder other circumstances Stalky and Beetle would have fallen upon him,\nfor that song was barred utterly--anathema--the sin of witchcraft. But\nseeing what he had wrought, they danced round him in silence, waiting\ntill it pleased him to touch earth.\n\nThe tea-bell rang when they were still half a mile from College. McTurk\nshivered and came out of dreams. The glory of his holiday estate had\nleft him. He was a Colleger of the College, speaking English once more.\n\n“Turkey, it was immense!” said Stalky, generously. “I didn’t know you\nhad it in you. You’ve got us a hut for the rest of the term, where\nwe simply _can’t_ be collared. Fids! Fids! Oh, Fids! I gloat! Hear me\ngloat!”\n\nThey spun wildly on their heels, jodeling after the accepted manner of\na “gloat,” which is not unremotely allied to the primitive man’s song of\ntriumph, and dropped down the hill by the path from the gasometer just\nin time to meet their house-master, who had spent the afternoon watching\ntheir abandoned hut in the “wuzzy.”\n\nUnluckily, all Mr. Prout’s imagination leaned to the darker side of\nlife, and he looked on those young-eyed cherubims most sourly. Boys that\nhe understood attended house-matches and could be accounted for at\nany moment. But he had heard McTurk openly deride cricket--even\nhouse-matches; Beetle’s views on the honor of the house he knew were\nincendiary; and he could never tell when the soft and smiling Stalky was\nlaughing at him. Consequently--since human nature is what it is--those\nboys had been doing wrong somewhere. He hoped it was nothing very\nserious, but...\n\n“_Ti-ra-ra-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!” Stalky, still on his heels,\nwhirled like a dancing dervish to the dining-hall.\n\n“_Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!” Beetle spun behind him with\noutstretched arms.\n\n“_Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!” McTurk’s voice cracked.\n\nNow was there or was there not a distinct flavor of beer as they shot\npast Mr. Prout?\n\nHe was unlucky in that his conscience as a house-master impelled him to\nconsult his associates. Had he taken his pipe and his troubles to\nlittle Hartopp’s rooms he would, perhaps, have been saved confusion, for\nHartopp believed in boys, and knew something about them. His fate led\nhim to King, a fellow house-master, no friend of his, but a zealous\nhater of Stalky & Co.\n\n“Ah-haa!” said King, rubbing his hands when the tale was told. “Curious!\nNow _my_ house never dream of doing these things.”\n\n“But you see I’ve no proof, exactly.”\n\n“Proof? With the egregious Beetle! As if one wanted it! I suppose it\nis not impossible for the Sergeant to supply it? Foxy is considered\nat least a match for any evasive boy in my house. Of course they were\nsmoking and drinking somewhere. That type of boy always does. They think\nit manly.”\n\n“But they’ve no following in the school, and they are distinctly--er\nbrutal to their juniors,” said Prout, who had from a distance seen\nBeetle return, with interest, his butterfly-net to a tearful fag.\n\n“Ah! They consider themselves superior to ordinary delights.\nSelf-sufficient little animals! There’s something in McTurk’s Hibernian\nsneer that would make me a little annoyed. And they are so careful\nto avoid all overt acts, too. It’s sheer calculated insolence. I am\nstrongly opposed, as you know, to interfering with another man’s house;\nbut they need a lesson, Prout. They need a sharp lesson, if only to\nbring down their over-weening self-conceit. Were I you, I should devote\nmyself for a week to their little performances. Boys of that order--and\nI may flatter myself, but I think I know boys--don’t join the\nBug-hunters for love. Tell the Sergeant to keep his eye open; and, of\ncourse, in my peregrinations I may casually keep mine open, too.”\n\n“_Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!” far down the corridor.\n\n“Disgusting!” said King. “Where do they pick up these obscene noises?\nOne sharp lesson is what they want.”\n\nThe boys did not concern themselves with lessons for the next few days.\nThey had all Colonel Dabney’s estate to play with, and they explored it\nwith the stealth of Red Indians and the accuracy of burglars. They could\nenter either by the Lodge-gates on the upper road--they were careful to\ningratiate themselves with the Lodge-keeper and his wife--drop down into\nthe combe, and return along the cliffs; or they could begin at the combe\nand climb up into the road.\n\nThey were careful not to cross the Colonel’s path--he had served his\nturn, and they would not out-wear their welcome--nor did they show up on\nthe sky-line when they could move in cover. The shelter of the gorze\nby the cliff-edge was their chosen retreat. Beetle christened it the\nPleasant Isle of Aves, for the peace and the shelter of it; and here,\nthe pipes and tobacco once cache’d in a convenient ledge an arm’s length\ndown the cliff, their position was legally unassailable.\n\nFor, observe, Colonel Dabney had not invited them to enter his house.\nTherefore, they did not need to ask specific leave to go visiting; and\nschool rules were strict on that point. He had merely thrown open his\ngrounds to them; and, since they were lawful Bug-hunters, their extended\nbounds ran up to his notice-boards in the combe and his Lodge-gates on\nthe hill.\n\nThey were amazed at their own virtue.\n\n“And even if it wasn’t,” said Stalky, flat on his back, staring into the\nblue. “Even suppose we were miles out of bounds, no one could get at us\nthrough this wuzzy, unless he knew the tunnel. Isn’t this better than\nlyin’ up just behind the Coll.--in a blue funk every time we had a\nsmoke? Isn’t your Uncle Stalky--?”\n\n“No,” said Beetle--he was stretched at the edge of the cliff spitting\nthoughtfully. “We’ve got to thank Turkey for this. Turkey is the Great\nMan. Turkey, dear, you’re distressing Heffles.”\n\n“Gloomy old ass!” said McTurk, deep in a book.\n\n“They’ve got us under suspicion,” said Stalky. “Hoophats _is_ so\nsuspicious somehow; and Foxy always makes every stalk he does a sort\nof--sort of--”\n\n“Scalp,” said Beetle. “Foxy’s a giddy Chingangook.”\n\n“Poor Foxy,” said Stalky. “He’s goin’ to catch us one of these days.\n‘Said to me in the Gym last night, ‘I’ve got my eye on you, Mister\nCorkran. I’m only warning you for your good.’ Then I said: ‘Well, you\njolly well take it off again, or you’ll get into trouble. I’m only\nwarnin’ you for your good.’ Foxy was wrath.”\n\n“Yes, but it’s only fair sport for Foxy,” said Beetle. “It’s Hefflelinga\nthat has the evil mind. ‘Shouldn’t wonder if he thought we got tight.”\n\n“I never got squiffy but once--that was in the holidays,” said Stalky,\nreflectively; “an’ it made me horrid sick. ‘Pon my sacred Sam, though,\nit’s enough to drive a man to drink, havin’ an animal like Hoof for\nhouse-master.”\n\n“If we attended the matches an’ yelled, ‘Well hit, sir,’ an’ stood on\none leg an’ grinned every time Heffy said, ‘So ho, my sons. Is it thus?’\nan’ said, ‘Yes, sir,’ an’ ‘No, sir,’ an’ ‘O, sir,’ an’ ‘Please, sir,’\nlike a lot o’ filthy fa-ags, Heffy ‘ud think no end of us,” said McTurk\nwith a sneer.\n\n“Too late to begin that.”\n\n“It’s all right. The Hefflelinga means well. _But_ he is an ass. _And_\nwe show him that we think he’s an ass. An’ _so_ Heffy don’t love us.\n‘Told me last night after prayers that he was _in loco parentis_,”\n Beetle grunted.\n\n“The deuce he did!” cried Stalky. “That means he’s maturin’ something\nunusual dam’ mean. Last time he told me that he gave me three hundred\nlines for dancin’ the cachuca in Number Ten dormitory. _Loco parentis_,\nby gum! But what’s the odds as long as you’re ‘appy? _We’re_ all right.”\n\nThey were, and their very rightness puzzled Prout, King, and the\nSergeant. Boys with bad consciences show it. They slink out past the\nFives Court in haste, and smile nervously when questioned. They return,\ndisordered, in bare time to save a call-over. They nod and wink and\ngiggle one to the other, scattering at the approach of a master. But\nStalky and his allies had long out-lived these manifestations of youth.\nThey strolled forth unconcernedly, and returned in excellent shape after\na light refreshment of strawberries and cream at the Lodge.\n\nThe Lodge-keeper had been promoted to keeper, _vice_ the murderous\nfisherman, and his wife made much of the boys. The man, too, gave them\na squirrel, which they presented to the Natural History Society; thereby\ncheckmating little Hartopp, who wished to know what they were doing for\nScience. Foxy faithfully worked some deep Devon lanes behind a lonely\ncross-roads inn; and it was curious that Prout and King, members of\nCommon-room seldom friendly, walked together in the same direction--that\nis to say, northeast.\n\nNow, the Pleasant Isle of Aves lay due southwest. “They’re\ndeep--day-vilish deep,” said Stalky. “Why are they drawin’ those\ncovers?”\n\n“Me,” said Beetle sweetly. “I asked Foxy if he had ever tasted the beer\nthere. That was enough for Foxy, and it cheered him up a little. He and\nHeffy were sniffin’ round our old hut so long I thought they’d like a\nchange.”\n\n“Well, it can’t last forever,” said Stalky. “Heffy’s bankin’ up like\na thunder-cloud, an’ King goes rubbin’ his beastly hands, an’ grinnin’\nlike a hyena. It’s shockin’ demoralizin’ for King. He’ll burst some\nday.”\n\nThat day came a little sooner than they expected--came when the\nSergeant, whose duty it was to collect defaulters, did not attend an\nafternoon call-over.\n\n“Tired of pubs, eh? He’s gone up to the top of the bill with his\nbinoculars to spot us,” said Stalky. “Wonder he didn’t think of that\nbefore. Did you see old Heffy cock his eye at us when we answered our\nnames? Heffy’s in it, too. _Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me! Come\non!”\n\n“Aves?” said Beetle.\n\n“Of course, but I’m not smokin’ _aujourd’hui_. _Parceque je_ jolly well\n_pense_ that we’ll be _suivi_. We’ll go along the cliffs, slow, an’ give\nFoxy lots of time to parallel us up above.”\n\nThey strolled towards the swimming-baths, and presently overtook King.\n“Oh, don’t let _me_ interrupt you,” he said. “Engaged in scientific\npursuits, of course? I trust you will enjoy yourselves, my young\nfriends.”\n\n“You see!” said Stalky, when they were out of earshot. “He _can’t_ keep\na secret. He’s followin’ to cut off our line of retreat. He’ll wait\nat the baths till Heffy comes along. They’ve tried every blessed place\nexcept along the cliffs, and now they think they’ve bottled us. No need\nto hurry.”\n\nThey walked leisurely over the combes till they reached the line of\nnotice-boards.\n\n“Listen a shake. Foxy’s up wind comin’ down hill like beans. When you\nhear him move in the bushes, go straight across to Aves. They want to\ncatch us _flagrante delicto_.”\n\nThey dived into the gorse at right angles to the tunnel, openly crossing\nthe grass, and lay still in Aves.\n\n“What did I tell you?” Stalky carefully put away the pipes and tobacco.\nThe Sergeant, out of breath, was leaning against the fence, raking\nthe furze with his binoculars, but he might as well have tried to see\nthrough a sand-bag. Anon, Prout and King appeared behind him. They\nconferred.\n\n“Aha! Foxy don’t like the notice-boards, and he don’t like the prickles\neither. Now we’ll cut up the tunnel and go to the Lodge. Hullo! They’ve\nsent Foxy into cover.”\n\nThe Sergeant was waist-deep in crackling, swaying furze, his ears filled\nwith the noise of his own progress. The boys reached the shelter of the\nwood and looked down through a belt of hollies.\n\n“Hellish noise!” said Stalky, critically. “‘Don’t think Colonel Dabney\nwill like it. I move we go into the Lodge and get something to eat. We\nmight as well see the fun out.”\n\nSuddenly the keeper passed them at a trot. “Who’m they to combe-bottom\nfor Lard’s sake? Master’ll be crazy,” he said.\n\n“Poachers simly,” Stalky replied in the broad Devon that was the boy’s\n_langue de guerre_.\n\n“I’ll poach ‘em to raights!” He dropped into the funnel-like combe,\nwhich presently began to fill with noises, notably King’s voice crying:\n“Go on, Sergeant! Leave him alone, you, sir. He is executing my orders.”\n\n“Who’m yeou to give arders here, gingy whiskers? Yeou come up to the\nmaster. Come out o’ that wuzzy! [This is to the Sergeant.] Yiss, I\nreckon us knows the boys yeou’m after. They’ve tu long ears an’ vuzzy\nbellies, an’ you nippies they in yeour pockets when they’m dead. Come on\nup to master! He’ll boy yeou all you’re a mind to. Yeou other folk bide\nyour side fence.”\n\n“Explain to the proprietor. You can explain, Sergeant,” shouted King.\nEvidently the Sergeant had surrendered to the major force.\n\nBeetle lay at full length on the turf behind the Lodge, literally biting\nthe earth in spasms of joy. Stalky kicked him upright. There was nothing\nof levity about Stalky or McTurk save a stray muscle twitching on the\ncheek.\n\nThey tapped at the Lodge door, where they were always welcome. “Come\nyeou right in an’ set down, my little dearrs,” said the woman. “They’ll\nniver touch my man. He’ll poach ‘em to rights. Iss fai! Fresh berries\nan’ cream. Us Dartymoor folk niver forgit their friends. But them\nBidevor poachers, they’ve no hem to their garments. Sugar? My man he’ve\ndigged a badger for yeou, my dearrs. ‘Tis in the linhay in a box.”\n\n“Us’ll take un with us when we’re finished here. I reckon yeou’m busy.\nWe’ll bide here an’--‘tis washin’ day with yeou, simly,” said Stalky.\n“We’m no company to make all vitty for. Never yeou mind us. Yiss.\nThere’s plenty cream.”\n\nThe woman withdrew, wiping her pink hands on her apron, and left them\nin the parlor. There was a scuffle of feet on the gravel outside the\nheavily-leaded diamond panes, and then the voice of Colonel Dabney,\nsomething clearer than a bugle.\n\n“Ye can read? You’ve eyes in your head? Don’t attempt to deny it. Ye\nhave!”\n\nBeetle snatched a crochet-work antimacassar from the shiny horsehair\nsofa, stuffed it into his mouth, and rolled out of sight.\n\n“You saw my notice-boards. Your duty? Curse your impudence, sir. Your\nduty was to keep off my grounds. Talk of duty to _me_! Why--why--why, ye\nmisbegotten poacher, ye’ll be teaching me my A B C next! Roarin’ like a\nbull in the bushes down there! Boys? Boys? Boys? Keep your boys at home,\nthen! I’m not responsible for your boys! But I don’t believe it--I\ndon’t believe a word of it. Ye’ve a furtive look in your eye--a furtive,\nsneakin’, poachin’ look in your eye, that ‘ud ruin the reputation of an\narchangel! Don’t attempt to deny it! Ye have! A sergeant? More shame to\nyou, then, an’ the worst bargain Her Majesty ever made! A sergeant, to\nrun about the country poachin’--on your pension! Damnable! Oh, damnable!\nBut I’ll be considerate. I’ll be merciful. By gad, I’ll be the very\nessence o’ humanity! Did ye, or did ye not, see my notice-boards? Don’t\nattempt to deny it! Ye did. Silence, Sergeant!”\n\nTwenty-one years in the army had left their mark on Foxy. He obeyed.\n\n“Now. March!” The high Lodge gate shut with a clang. “My duty! A\nsergeant to tell me my duty!” puffed Colonel Dabney. “Good Lard! more\nsergeants!”\n\n“It’s King! It’s King!” gulped Stalky, his head on the horsehair pillow.\nMcTurk was eating the rag-carpet before the speckless hearth, and the\nsofa heaved to the emotions of Beetle. Through the thick glass the\nfigures without showed blue, distorted, and menacing.\n\n“I--I protest against this outrage.” King had evidently been running\nup hill. “The man was entirely within his duty. Let--let me give you my\ncard.”\n\n“He’s in flannels!” Stalky buried his head again.\n\n“Unfortunately--most unfortunately--I have not one with me, but my\nname is King, sir, a house-master of the College, and you will find me\nprepared--fully prepared--to answer for this man’s action. We’ve seen\nthree--”\n\n“Did ye see my notice-boards?”\n\n“I admit we did; but under the circumstances--”\n\n“I stand _in loco parentis_.” Prout’s deep voice was added to the\ndiscussion. They could hear him pant.\n\n“F’what?” Colonel Dabney was growing more and more Irish.\n\n“I’m responsible for the boys under my charge.”\n\n“Ye are, are ye? Then all I can say is that ye set them a very bad\nexample--a dam’ bad example, if I may say so. I do not own your boys.\nI’ve not seen your boys, an’ I tell you that if there was a boy grinnin’\nin every bush on the place, _still_ ye’ve no shadow of a right here,\ncomin’ up from the combe that way, an’ frightenin’ everything in it.\nDon’t attempt to deny it. Ye did. Ye should have come to the Lodge an’\nseen me like Christians, instead of chasin’ your dam’ boys through the\nlength and breadth of my covers. _In loco parentis_ ye are? Well,\nI’ve not forgotten my Latin either, an’ I’ll say to you:\n‘_Quis custodiet ipsos custodes_.’ If the masters trespass, how can we\nblame the boys?”\n\n“But if I could speak to you privately,” said Prout.\n\n“I’ll have nothing private with you! Ye can be as private as ye please\non the other side o’ that gate an’--I wish ye a very good afternoon.”\n\nA second time the gate clanged. They waited till Colonel Dabney had\nreturned to the house, and fell into one another’s arms, crowing for\nbreath.\n\n“Oh, my Soul! Oh, my King! Oh, my Heffy! Oh, my Foxy! Zeal, all zeal,\nMr. Simple.” Stalky wiped his eyes. “Oh! Oh I Oh!--‘I _did_ boil the\nexciseman!’ We must get out of this or we’ll be late for tea.”\n\n“Ge--Ge--get the badger and make little Hartopp happy. Ma--ma--make\n‘em all happy,” sobbed McTurk, groping for the door and kicking the\nprostrate Beetle before him.\n\nThey found the beast in an evil-smelling box, left two half-crowns for\npayment, and staggered home. Only the badger grunted most marvelous like\nColonel Dabney, and they dropped him twice or thrice with shrieks of\nhelpless laughter. They were but imperfectly recovered when Foxy met\nthem by the Fives Court with word that they were to go up to their\ndormitory and wait till sent for.\n\n“Well, take this box to Mr. Hartopp’s rooms, then. We’ve done something\nfor the Natural History Society, at any rate,” said Beetle.\n\n“‘Fraid that won’t save you, young gen’elmen,” Foxy answered, in an\nawful voice. He was sorely ruffled in his mind.\n\n“All sereno, Foxibus.” Stalky had reached the extreme stage of hiccups.\n“We--we’ll never desert you, Foxy. Hounds choppin’ foxes in cover is\nmore a proof of vice, ain’t it?... No, you’re right. I’m--I’m not quite\nwell.”\n\n“They’ve gone a bit too far this time,” Foxy thought to himself. “Very\nfar gone, _I’d_ say, excep’ there was no smell of liquor. An’ yet it\nisn’t like ‘em--somehow. King and Prout they ‘ad their dressin’-down\nsame as me. That’s one comfort.”\n\n“Now, we must pull up,” said Stalky, rising from the bed on which he had\nthrown himself. “We’re injured innocence--as usual. We don’t know what\nwe’ve been sent up here for, do we?”\n\n“No explanation. Deprived of tea. Public disgrace before the house,”\n said McTurk, whose eyes were running over. “It’s dam’ serious.”\n\n“Well, hold on, till King loses his temper,” said Beetle. “He’s a\nlibelous old rip, an’ he’ll be in a ravin’ paddy-wack. Prout’s too\nbeastly cautious. Keep your eye on King, and, if he gives us a chance,\nappeal to the Head. That always makes ‘em sick.”\n\nThey were summoned to their house-master’s study, King and Foxy\nsupporting Prout, and Foxy had three canes under his arm. King leered\ntriumphantly, for there were tears, undried tears of mirth, on the boys’\ncheeks. Then the examination began.\n\nYes, they had walked along the cliffs. Yes, they had entered Colonel\nDabney’s grounds. Yes, they had seen the notice-boards (at this point\nBeetle sputtered hysterically). For what purpose had they entered\nColonel Dabney’s grounds? “Well, sir, there was a badger.”\n\nHere King, who loathed the Natural History Society because he did not\nlike Hartopp, could no longer be restrained. He begged them not to add\nmendacity to open insolence. But the badger was in Mr. Hartopp’s rooms,\nsir. The Sergeant had kindly taken it up for them. That disposed of the\nbadger, and the temporary check brought King’s temper to boiling-point.\nThey could hear his foot on the floor while Prout prepared his lumbering\ninquiries. They had settled into their stride now. Their eyes ceased to\nsparkle; their faces were blank; their hands hung beside them without a\ntwitch. They were learning, at the expense of a fellow-countryman, the\nlesson of their race, which is to put away all emotion and entrap the\nalien at the proper time.\n\nSo far good. King was importing himself more freely into the trial,\nbeing vengeful where Prout was grieved. They knew the penalties of\ntrespassing? With a fine show of irresolution, Stalky admitted that\nhe had gathered some information vaguely bearing on this head, but he\nthought--The sentence was dragged out to the uttermost: Stalky did not\nwish to play his trump with such an opponent. Mr. King desired no buts,\nnor was he interested in Stalky’s evasions. They, on the other hand,\nmight be interested in his poor views. Boys who crept--who sneaked--who\nlurked--out of bounds, even the generous bounds of the Natural\nHistory Society, which they had falsely joined as a cloak for their\nmisdeeds--their vices--their villainies--their immoralities--\n\n“He’ll break cover in a minute,” said Stalky to himself. “Then we’ll run\ninto him before he gets away.”\n\nSuch boys, scabrous boys, moral lepers--the current of his words was\ncarrying King off his feet--evil-speakers, liars, slow-bellies--yea,\nincipient drunkards...\n\nHe was merely working up to a peroration, and the boys knew it; but\nMcTurk cut through the frothing sentence, the others echoing:\n\n“I appeal to the Head, sir.”\n\n“I appeal to the head, sir.”\n\n“I appeal to the Head, sir.”\n\nIt was their unquestioned right. Drunkenness meant expulsion after a\npublic flogging. They had been accused of it. The case was the Head’s,\nand the Head’s alone.\n\n“Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.” They had\nheard that sentence once or twice before in their careers. “None the\nless,” said King, uneasily, “you would be better advised to abide by our\ndecision, my young friends.”\n\n“Are we allowed to associate with the rest of the school till we see the\nHead, sir?” said McTurk to his house-master, disregarding King. This at\nonce lifted the situation to its loftiest plane. Moreover, it meant no\nwork, for moral leprosy was strictly quarantined, and the Head never\nexecuted judgment till twenty-four cold hours later.\n\n“Well--er--if you persist in your defiant attitude,” said King, with a\nloving look at the canes under Foxy’s arm. “There is no alternative.”\n\nTen minutes later the news was over the whole school. Stalky and Co.\nhad fallen at last--fallen by drink. They had been drinking. They had\nreturned blind-drunk from a hut. They were even now lying hopelessly\nintoxicated on the dormitory floor. A few bold spirits crept up to look,\nand received boots about the head from the criminals.\n\n“We’ve got him--got him on the Caudine Toasting-fork!” said Stalky,\nafter those hints were taken. “King’ll have to prove his charges up to\nthe giddy hilt.”\n\n“Too much ticklee, him bust,” Beetle quoted from a book of his reading.\n“Didn’t I say he’d go pop if we lat un bide?”\n\n“No prep., either, O ye incipient drunkards,” said McTurk, “and it’s\ntrig night, too. Hullo! Here’s our dear friend Foxy. More tortures,\nFoxibus?”\n\n“I’ve brought you something to eat, young gentlemen,” said the Sergeant\nfrom behind a crowded tray. Their wars had ever been waged without\nmalice, and a suspicion floated in Foxy’s mind that boys who allowed\nthemselves to be tracked so easily might, perhaps, hold something in\nreserve. Foxy had served through the Mutiny, when early and accurate\ninformation was worth much.\n\n“I--I noticed you ‘adn’t ‘ad anything to eat, an’ I spoke to Gumbly, an’\nhe said you wasn’t exactly cut off from supplies. So I brought up this.\nIt’s your potted ‘am tin, ain’t it, Mr. Corkran?”\n\n“Why, Foxibus, you’re a brick,” said Stalky. “I didn’t think you had\nthis much--what’s the word, Beetle?”\n\n“Bowels,” Beetle replied, promptly. “Thank you, Sergeant. That’s young\nCarter’s potted ham, though.”\n\n“There was a C on it. I thought it was Mr. Corkran’s. This is a very\nserious business, young gentlemen. That’s what it is. I didn’t know,\nperhaps, but there might be something on your side which you hadn’t said\nto Mr. King or Mr. Prout, maybe.”\n\n“There is. Heaps, Foxibus.” This from Stalky through a full mouth.\n\n“Then you see, if that was the case, it seemed to me I might represent\nit, quiet so to say, to the ‘Ead when he asks me about it. I’ve got to\ntake ‘im the charges to-night, an’--it looks bad on the face of it.”\n\n“‘Trocious bad, Foxy. Twenty-seven cuts in the Gym before all the\nschool, and public expulsion. ‘Wine is a mocker, strong drink is\nragin’,’” quoth Beetle.\n\n“It’s nothin’ to make fun of, young gentlemen. I ‘ave to go to the ‘Ead\nwith the charges. An’--an’ you mayn’t be aware, per’aps, that I was\nfollowin’ you this afternoon; havin’ my suspicions.”\n\n“Did ye see the notice-boards?” croaked McTurk, in the very brogue of\nColonel Dabney.\n\n“Ye’ve eyes in your head. Don’t attempt to deny it. Ye did!” said\nBeetle.\n\n“A sergeant! To run about poachin’ on your pension! Damnable, O\ndamnable!” said Stalky, without pity.\n\n“Good Lord!” said the Sergeant, sitting heavily upon a bed.\n“Where--where the devil _was_ you? I might ha’ known it was a\ndo--somewhere.”\n\n“Oh, you clever maniac!” Stalky resumed. “We mayn’t be aware you were\nfollowin’ us this afternoon, mayn’t we? ‘Thought you were stalkin’ us,\neh? Why, we led you bung into it, of course. Colonel Dabney--don’t\nyou think he’s a nice man, Foxy?--Colonel Dabney’s our pet particular\nfriend. We’ve been goin’ there for weeks and weeks, he invited us.\nYou and your duty! Curse your duty, sir! Your duty was to keep off his\ncovers.”\n\n“You’ll never be able to hold up your head again, Foxy. The fags ‘ll\nhoot at you,” said Beetle.\n\n“Think of your giddy prestige!” The Sergeant was thinking--hard.\n\n“Look ‘ere, young gentlemen,” he said, earnestly. “You aren’t surely\never goin’ to tell, are you? Wasn’t Mr. Prout and Mr. King in--in it\ntoo?”\n\n“Foxibusculus, they _was_. They was--singular horrid. Caught it worse\nthan you. We heard every word of it. You got off easy, considerin’. If\nI’d been Dabney I swear I’d ha’ quodded you. I think I’ll suggest it to\nhim to-morrow.”\n\n“An’ it’s all goin’ up to the ‘Ead. Oh, Good Lord!”\n\n“Every giddy word of it, my Chingangook,” said Beetle, dancing. “Why\nshouldn’t it? _We’ve_ done nothing wrong. _We_ ain’t poachers. _We_\ndidn’t cut about blastin’ the characters of poor, innocent boys--saying\nthey were drunk.”\n\n“That I didn’t,” said Foxy. “I--I only said that you be’aved uncommon\nodd when you come back with that badger. Mr. King may have taken the\nwrong hint from that.”\n\n“‘Course he did; an’ he’ll jolly well shove all the blame on you when\nhe finds out he’s wrong. We know King, if you don’t. I’m ashamed of you.\nYou ain’t fit to be a sergeant,” said McTurk.\n\n“Not with three thorough-goin’ young devils like you, I ain’t. I’ve\nbeen had. I’ve been ambuscaded. Horse, foot, an’ guns, I’ve been had,\nan’--an’ there’ll be no holdin’ the junior forms after this. M’rover,\nthe ‘Ead will send me with a note to Colonel Dabney to ask if what you\nsay about bein’ invited was true.”\n\n“Then you’d better go in by the Lodge-gates this time, instead of\nchasin’ your dam’ boys--oh, that was the Epistle to King--so it was.\nWe-el, Foxy?” Stalky put his chin on his hands and regarded the victim\nwith deep delight.\n\n“_Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu_! I gloat! Hear me!” said McTurk. “Foxy brought us\ntea when we were moral lepers. Foxy has a heart. Foxy has been in the\nArmy, too.”\n\n“I wish I’d ha’ had you in my company, young gentlemen,” said the\nSergeant from the depths of his heart; “I’d ha’ given you something.”\n\n“Silence at drum-head court-martial,” McTurk went on. “I’m advocate for\nthe prisoner; and, besides, this is much too good to tell all the other\nbrutes in the Coll. They’d _never_ understand. They play cricket, and\nsay: ‘Yes sir,’ and ‘O, sir,’ and ‘No, sir.’”\n\n“Never mind that. Go ahead,” said Stalky.\n\n“Well, Foxy’s a good little chap when he does not esteem himself so as\nto be clever.”\n\n“‘Take not out your ‘ounds on a werry windy day,’” Stalky struck in.\n“_I_ don’t care if you let him off.”\n\n“Nor me,” said Beetle. “Heffy is my only joy--Heffy and King.”\n\n“I ‘ad to do it,” said the Sergeant, plaintively.\n\n“Right, O! Led away by bad companions in the execution of his duty\nor--or words to that effect. You’re dismissed with a reprimand, Foxy.\n_We_ won’t tell about _you_. I swear we won’t,” McTurk concluded. “Bad\nfor the discipline of the school. Horrid bad.”\n\n“Well,” said the Sergeant, gathering up the tea-things, “knowin’ what I\nknow o’ the young dev--gentlemen of the College, I’m very glad to ‘ear\nit. But what am I to tell the ‘Ead?”\n\n“Anything you jolly well please, Foxy. We aren’t the criminals.”\n\nTo say that the Head was annoyed when the Sergeant appeared after dinner\nwith the day’s crime-sheet would be putting it mildly.\n\n“Corkran, McTurk, and Co., I see. Bounds as usual. Hullo! What the deuce\nis this? Suspicion of drinking. Whose charge??”\n\n“Mr. King’s, sir. I caught ‘em out of bounds, sir: at least that was ‘ow\nit looked. But there’s a lot be’ind, sir.” The Sergeant was evidently\ntroubled.\n\n“Go on,” said the Head. “Let us have your version.” He and the Sergeant\nhad dealt with one another for some seven years; and the Head knew that\nMr. King’s statements depended very largely on Mr. King’s temper.\n\n“I thought they were out of bounds along the cliffs. But it come out\nthey wasn’t, sir. I saw them go into Colonel Dabney’s woods, and--Mr.\nKing and Mr. Prout come along--and the fact was, sir, we was mistook\nfor poachers by Colonel Dabney’s people--Mr. King and Mr. Prout and me.\nThere were some words, sir, on both sides. The young gentlemen slipped\n‘ome somehow, and they seemed ‘ighly humorous, sir. Mr. King was mistook\nby Colonel Dabney himself--Colonel Dabney bein’ strict. Then they\npreferred to come straight to you, sir, on account of what--what Mr.\nKing may ‘ave said about their ‘abits afterwards in Mr. Prout’s study.\nI only said they was ‘ighly humorous, laughin’ an’ gigglin’, an’ a bit\nabove ‘emselves. They’ve since told me, sir, in a humorous way, that\nthey was invited by Colonel Dabney to go into ‘is woods.”\n\n“I see. They didn’t tell their house-master that, of course?”\n\n“They took up Mr. King on appeal just as soon as he spoke about\ntheir--‘abits. Put in the appeal at once, sir, an’ asked to be sent\nto the dormitory waitin’ for you. I’ve since gathered, sir, in their\nhumorous way, sir, that some’ow or other they’ve ‘eard about every word\nColonel Dabney said to Mr. King and Mr. Prout when he mistook ‘em for\npoachers. I--I might ha’ known when they led me on so that they ‘eld the\ninner line of communications. It’s--it’s a plain do, sir, if you ask me;\nan’ they’re gloatin’ over it in the dormitory.”\n\nThe Head saw--saw even to the uttermost farthing--and his mouth twitched\na little under his mustache.\n\n“Send them to me at once, Sergeant. This case needn’t wait over.”\n\n“Good evening,” said he when the three appeared under escort. “I want\nyour undivided attention for a few minutes. You’ve known me for five\nyears, and I’ve known you for--twenty-five. I think we understand one\nanother perfectly. I am now going to pay you a tremendous compliment\n(the brown one, please, Sergeant. Thanks. You needn’t wait). I’m going\nto execute you without rhyme, Beetle, or reason. I know you went to\nColonel Dabney’s covers because you were invited. I’m not even going to\nsend the Sergeant with a note to ask if your statement is true; because\nI am convinced that on this occasion you have adhered strictly to the\ntruth. I know, too, that you were not drinking. (You can take off\nthat virtuous expression, McTurk, or I shall begin to fear you don’t\nunderstand me.) There is not a flaw in any of your characters. And that\nis why I am going to perpetrate a howling injustice. Your reputations\nhave been injured, haven’t they? You have been disgraced before the\nhouse, haven’t you? You have a peculiarly keen regard for the honor of\nyour house, haven’t you? Well, now I am going to lick you.”\n\nSix apiece was their portion upon that word.\n\n“And this I think”--the Head replaced the cane, and flung the written\ncharge into the waste-paper basket--“covers the situation. When you\nfind a variation from the normal--this will be useful to you in later\nlife--always meet him in an abnormal way. And that reminds me. There are\na pile of paper-backs on that shelf. You can borrow them if you put them\nback. I don’t think they’ll take any harm from being read in the open.\nThey smell of tobacco rather. You will go to prep. this evening as\nusual. Good-night,” said that amazing man.\n\n“Good-night, and thank you, sir.”\n\n“I swear I’ll pray for the Head to-night,” said Beetle. “Those last two\ncuts were just flicks on my collar. There’s a ‘Monte Cristo’ in that\nlower shelf. I saw it. Bags I, next time we go to Aves!”\n\n“Dearr man!” said McTurk. “No gating. No impots. No beastly questions.\nAll settled. Hullo! what’s King goin’ in to him for--King and Prout?”\n\nWhatever the nature of that interview, it did not improve either King’s\nor Prout’s ruffled plumes, for, when they came out of the Head’s house,\neyes noted that the one was red and blue with emotion as to his nose,\nand that the other was sweating profusely. That sight compensated them\namply for the Imperial Jaw with which they were favored by the two. It\nseems--and who so astonished as they?--that they had held back material\nfacts; were guilty both of _suppressio veri_ and _suggestio falsi_\n(well-known gods against whom they often offended); further, that they\nwere malignant in their dispositions, untrustworthy in their characters,\npernicious and revolutionary in their influences, abandoned to the\ndevils of wilfulness, pride, and a most intolerable conceit. Ninthly,\nand lastly, they were to have a care and to be very careful.\n\nThey were careful, as only boys can be when there is a hurt to be\ninflicted. They waited through one suffocating week till Prout and\nKing were their royal selves again; waited till there was a\nhouse-match--their own house, too--in which Prout was taking part;\nwaited, further, till he had his pads in the pavilion and stood ready to\ngo forth. King was scoring at the window, and the three sat on a bench\nwithout.\n\nSaid Stalky to Beetle: “I say, Beetle, _quis custodet ipsos custodes_?”\n\n“Don’t ask me,” said Beetle. “I’ll have nothin’ private with you. Ye can\nbe as private as ye please the other end of the bench; and I wish ye a\nvery good afternoon.”\n\nMcTurk yawned.\n\n“Well, ye should ha’ come up to the lodge like Christians instead o’\nchasin’ your--a-hem--boys through the length an’ breadth of my covers.\n_I_ think these house-matches are all rot. Let’s go over to Colonel\nDabney’s an’ see if he’s collared any more poachers.”\n\nThat afternoon there was joy in Aves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. SLAVES OF THE LAMP\n\n\nThe music-room on the top floor of Number Five was filled with the\n“Aladdin” company at rehearsal. Dickson Quartus, commonly known as Dick\nFour, was Aladdin, stage-manager, ballet-master, half the orchestra, and\nlargely librettist, for the “book” had been rewritten and filled\nwith local allusions. The pantomime was to be given next week, in the\ndown-stairs study occupied by Aladdin, Abanazar, and the Emperor of\nChina. The Slave of the Lamp, with the Princess Badroulbadour and the\nWidow Twankay, owned Number Five study across the same landing, so\nthat the company could be easily assembled. The floor shook to the\nstamp-and-go of the ballet, while Aladdin, in pink cotton tights, a blue\nand tinsel jacket, and a plumed hat, banged alternately on the piano and\nhis banjo. He was the moving spirit of the game, as befitted a senior\nwho had passed his Army Preliminary and hoped to enter Sandhurst next\nspring.\n\nAladdin came to his own at last, Abanazar lay poisoned on the floor, the\nWidow Twankay danced her dance, and the company decided it would “come\nall right on the night.”\n\n“What about the last song, though?” said the Emperor, a tallish,\nfair-headed boy with a ghost of a mustache, at which he pulled manfully.\n“We need a rousing old tune.”\n\n“‘John Peel’? ‘Drink, Puppy, Drink’?” suggested Abanazar, smoothing his\nbaggy lilac pajamas. “Pussy” Abanazar never looked more than one-half\nawake, but he owned a soft, slow smile which well suited the part of the\nWicked Uncle.\n\n“Stale,” said Aladdin. “Might as well have ‘Grandfather’s Clock.’ What’s\nthat thing you were humming at prep. last night, Stalky?”\n\nStalky, The Slave of the Lamp, in black tights and doublet, a black silk\nhalf-mask on his forehead, whistled lazily where he lay on the top of\nthe piano. It was a catchy music-hall tune.\n\nDick Four cocked his head critically, and squinted down a large red\nnose.\n\n“Once more, and I can pick it up,” he said, strumming. “Sing the words.”\n\n“Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby! Arrah, Patsy, mind the child! Wrap him in\nan overcoat, he’s surely going wild! Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby! just\nyou mind the child awhile! He’ll kick and bite and cry all night! Arrah,\nPatsy, mind the child!”\n\n“Rippin’! Oh, rippin’!” said Dick Four. “Only we shan’t have any piano\non the night. We must work it with the banjoes--play an’ dance at the\nsame time. You try, Tertius.”\n\nThe Emperor pushed aside his pea-green sleeves of state, and followed\nDick Four on a heavy nickel plated banjo.\n\n“Yes, but I’m dead all this time. Bung in the middle of the stage, too,”\n said Abanazar.\n\n“Oh, that’s Beetle’s biznai,” said Dick Four. “Vamp it up, Beetle. Don’t\nkeep us waiting all night. You’ve got to get Pussy out of the light\nsomehow, and bring us all in dancin’ at the end.”\n\n“All right. You two play it again,” said Beetle, who, in a gray skirt\nand a wig of chestnut sausage-curls, set slantwise above a pair of\nspectacles mended with an old boot-lace, represented the Widow Twankay.\nHe waved one leg in time to the hammered refrain, and the banjoes grew\nlouder.\n\n“Um! Ah! Er--‘Aladdin now has won his wife,’” he sang, and Dick Four\nrepeated it.\n\n“‘Your Emperor is appeased.’” Tertius flung out his chest as he\ndelivered his line.\n\n“Now jump up, Pussy! Say, ‘I think I’d better come to life! Then we\nall take hands and come forward: ‘We hope you’ve all been pleased.’\n_Twiggez-vous_?”\n\n“_Nous twiggons_. Good enough. What’s the chorus for the final ballet?\nIt’s four kicks and a turn,” said Dick Four.\n\n“Oh! Er!\n\n   John Short will ring the curtain down.\n   And ring the prompter’s bell;\n   We hope you know before you go\n   That we all wish you well.”\n\n“Rippin’! Rippin’! Now for the Widow’s scene with the Princess. Hurry\nup, Turkey.”\n\nMcTurk, in a violet silk skirt and a coquettish blue turban, slouched\nforward as one thoroughly ashamed of himself. The Slave of the Lamp\nclimbed down from the piano, and dispassionately kicked him. “Play up,\nTurkey,” he said; “this is serious.” But there fell on the door the\nknock of authority. It happened to be King, in gown and mortar-board,\nenjoying a Saturday evening prowl before dinner.\n\n“Locked doors! Locked doors!” he snapped with a scowl. “What’s the\nmeaning of this; and what, may I ask, is the intention of this--this\nepicene attire?”\n\n“Pantomime, sir. The Head gave us leave,” said Abanazar, as the only\nmember of the Sixth concerned. Dick Four stood firm in the confidence\nborn of well-fitting tights, but Beetle strove to efface himself behind\nthe piano. A gray princess-skirt borrowed from a day-boy’s mother and a\nspotted cotton bodice unsystematically padded with imposition-paper make\none ridiculous. And in other regards Beetle had a bad conscience.\n\n“As usual!” sneered King. “Futile foolery just when your careers, such\nas they may be, are hanging in the balance. I see! Ah, I see! The old\ngang of criminals--allied forces of disorder--Corkran”--the Slave of the\nLamp smiled politely--“McTurk”--the Irishman scowled--“and, of course,\nthe unspeakable Beetle, our friend Gigadibs.” Abanazar, the Emperor, and\nAladdin had more or less of characters, and King passed them over. “Come\nforth, my inky buffoon, from behind yonder instrument of music! You\nsupply, I presume, the doggerel for this entertainment. Esteem yourself\nto be, as it were, a poet?”\n\n“He’s found one of ‘em,” thought Beetle, noting the flush on King’s\ncheek-bone.\n\n“I have just had the pleasure of reading an effusion of yours to my\naddress, I believe--an effusion intended to rhyme. So--so you despise\nme, Master Gigadibs, do you? I am quite aware--you need not\nexplain--that it was ostensibly not intended for my edification. I read\nit with laughter--yes, with laughter. These paper pellets of inky\nboys--still a boy we are, Master Gigadibs--do not disturb my equanimity.”\n\n“Wonder which it was,” thought Beetle. He had launched many lampoons on\nan appreciative public ever since he discovered that it was possible to\nconvey reproof in rhyme.\n\nIn sign of his unruffled calm, King proceeded to tear Beetle, whom he\ncalled Gigadibs, slowly asunder. From his untied shoestrings to his\nmended spectacles (the life of a poet at a big school is hard) he held\nhim up to the derision of his associates--with the usual result. His\nwild flowers of speech--King had an unpleasant tongue---restored him to\ngood humor at the last. He drew a lurid picture of Beetle’s latter\nend as a scurrilous pamphleteer dying in an attic, scattered a few\ncompliments over McTurk and Corkran, and, reminding Beetle that he must\ncome up for judgment when called upon, went to Common-room, where he\ntriumphed anew over his victims.\n\n“And the worst of it,” he explained in a loud voice over his soup, “is\nthat I waste such gems of sarcasm on their thick heads. It’s miles above\nthem, I’m certain.”\n\n“We-ell,” said the school chaplain slowly, “I don’t know what Corkran’s\nappreciation of your style may be, but young McTurk reads Ruskin for his\namusement.”\n\n“Nonsense! He does it to show off. I mistrust the dark Celt.”\n\n“He does nothing of the kind. I went into their study the other night,\nunofficially, and McTurk was gluing up the back of four odd numbers of\n‘Fors Clavigera.’”\n\n“I don’t know anything about their private lives,” said a mathematical\nmaster hotly, “but I’ve learned by bitter experience that Number Five\nstudy are best left alone. They are utterly soulless young devils.”\n\nHe blushed as the others laughed.\n\nBut in the music-room there were wrath and bad language. Only Stalky,\nSlave of the Lamp, lay on the piano unmoved.\n\n“That little swine Manders miner must have shown him your stuff. He’s\nalways suckin’ up to King. Go and kill him,” he drawled. “Which one was\nit, Beetle?”\n\n“Dunno,” said Beetle, struggling out of the skirt. “There was one about\nhis hunting for popularity with the small boys, and the other one was\none about him in hell, tellin’ the Devil he was a Balliol man. I swear\nboth of ‘em rhymed all right. By gum! P’raps Manders minor showed him\nboth! _I’ll_ correct his caesuras for him.”\n\nHe disappeared down two flights of stairs, flushed a small pink and\nwhite boy in a form-room next door to King’s study, which, again,\nwas immediately below his own, and chased him up the corridor into a\nform-room sacred to the revels of the Lower Third. Thence he came\nback, greatly disordered, to find McTurk, Stalky, and the others of the\ncompany, in his study enjoying an unlimited “brew”--coffee, cocoa, buns,\nnew bread hot and steaming, sardine, sausage, ham-and-tongue paste,\npilchards, three jams, and at least as many pounds of Devonshire cream.\n\n“My hat!” said he, throwing himself upon the banquet. “Who stumped\nup for this, Stalky?” It was within a month of term end, and blank\nstarvation had reigned in the studies for weeks.\n\n“You,” said Stalky, serenely.\n\n“Confound you! You haven’t been popping my Sunday bags, then?”\n\n“Keep your hair on. It’s only your watch.”\n\n“Watch! I lost it--weeks ago. Out on the Burrows, when we tried to shoot\nthe old ram--the day our pistol burst.”\n\n“It dropped out of your pocket (you’re so beastly careless, Beetle), and\nMcTurk and I kept it for you. I’ve been wearing it for a week, and you\nnever noticed. Took it into Bideford after dinner to-day. Got thirteen\nand sevenpence. Here’s the ticket.”\n\n“Well, that’s pretty average cool,” said Abanazar behind a slab of cream\nand jam, as Beetle, reassured upon the safety of his Sunday trousers,\nshowed not even surprise, much less resentment. Indeed, it was McTurk\nwho grew angry, saying:\n\n“You gave him the ticket, Stalky? You pawned it? You unmitigated beast!\nWhy, last month you and Beetle sold mine! ‘Never got a sniff of any\nticket.”\n\n“Ah, that was because you locked your trunk, and we wasted half the\nafternoon hammering it open. We might have pawned it if you’d behaved\nlike a Christian, Turkey.”\n\n“My Aunt!” said Abanazar, “you chaps are communists. Vote of thanks to\nBeetle, though.”\n\n“That’s beastly unfair,” said Stalky, “when I took all the trouble to\npawn it. Beetle never knew he had a watch. Oh, I say, Rabbits-Eggs gave\nme a lift into Bideford this afternoon.”\n\nRabbits-Eggs was the local carrier--an outcrop of the early Devonian\nformation. It was Stalky who had invented his unlovely name. “He was\npretty average drunk, or he wouldn’t have done it. Rabbits-Eggs is a\nlittle shy of me, somehow. But I swore it was _pax_ between us, and gave\nhim a bob. He stopped at two pubs on the way in, so he’ll be howling\ndrunk to-night. Oh, don’t begin reading, Beetle; there’s a council of\nwar on. What the deuce is the matter with your collar?”\n\n“‘Chivied Manders minor into the Lower Third box-room. ‘Had all his\nbeastly little friends on top of me,” said Beetle from behind a jar of\npilchards and a book.\n\n“You ass! Any fool could have told you where Manders would bunk to,”\n said McTurk.\n\n“I didn’t think,” said Beetle, meekly, scooping out pilchards with a\nspoon.\n\n“Course you didn’t. You never do.” McTurk adjusted Beetle’s collar with\na savage tug. “Don’t drop oil all over my ‘Fors’ or I’ll scrag you!”\n\n“Shut up, you--you Irish Biddy! ‘Tisn’t your beastly ‘Fors.’ It’s one of\nmine.”\n\nThe book was a fat, brown-backed volume of the later Sixties, which King\nhad once thrown at Beetle’s head that Beetle might see whence the\nname Gigadibs came. Beetle had quietly annexed the book, and had\nseen--several things. The quarter-comprehended verses lived and ate with\nhim, as the bedropped pages showed. He removed himself from all that\nworld, drifting at large with wondrous Men and Women, till McTurk\nhammered the pilchard spoon on his head and he snarled.\n\n“Beetle! You’re oppressed and insulted and bullied by King. Don’t you\nfeel it?”\n\n“Let me alone! I can write some more poetry about him if I am, I\nsuppose.”\n\n“Mad! Quite mad!” said Stalky to the visitors, as one exhibiting strange\nbeasts. “Beetle reads an ass called Brownin’, and McTurk reads an ass\ncalled Ruskin; and--”\n\n“Ruskin isn’t an ass,” said McTurk. “He’s almost as good as the Opium\nEater. He says ‘we’re children of noble races trained by surrounding\nart.’ That means _me_, and the way I decorated the study when you two\nbadgers would have stuck up brackets and Christmas cards. Child of a\nnoble race, trained by surrounding art, stop reading, or I’ll shove a\npilchard down your neck!”\n\n“It’s two to one,” said Stalky, warningly, and Beetle closed the book,\nin obedience to the law under which he and his companions had lived for\nsix checkered years.\n\nThe visitors looked on delighted. Number Five study had a reputation for\nmore variegated insanity than the rest of the school put together; and\nso far as its code allowed friendship with outsiders it was polite and\nopen-hearted to its neighbors on the same landing.\n\n“What rot do you want now?” said Beetle.\n\n“King! War!” said McTurk, jerking his head toward the wall, where hung a\nsmall wooden West-African war-drum, a gift to McTurk from a naval uncle.\n\n“Then we shall be turned out of the study again,” said Beetle, who loved\nhis flesh-pots. “Mason turned us out for--just warbling on it.” Mason\nwas the mathematical master who had testified in Common-room.\n\n“Warbling?--O Lord!” said Abanazar. “We couldn’t hear ourselves speak in\nour study when you played the infernal thing. What’s the good of getting\nturned out of your study, anyhow?”\n\n“We lived in the form-rooms for a week, too,” said Beetle, tragically.\n“And it was beastly cold.”\n\n“Ye-es, but Mason’s rooms were filled with rats every day we were out.\nIt took him a week to draw the inference,” said McTurk. “He loathes\nrats. ‘Minute he let us go back the rats stopped. Mason’s a little shy\nof us now, but there was no evidence.”\n\n“Jolly well there wasn’t,” said Stalky, “when I got out on the roof and\ndropped the beastly things down his chimney. But, look here--question\nis, are our characters good enough just now to stand a study row?”\n\n“Never mind mine,” said Beetle. “King swears I haven’t any.”\n\n“I’m not thinking of you,” Stalky returned scornfully. “You aren’t\ngoing up for the Army, you old bat. I don’t want to be expelled--and the\nHead’s getting rather shy of us, too.”\n\n“Rot!” said McTurk. “The Head never expels except for beastliness or\nstealing. But I forgot; you and Stalky _are_ thieves--regular burglars.”\n\nThe visitors gasped, but Stalky interpreted the parable with large\ngrins.\n\n“Well, you know, that little beast Manders minor saw Beetle and me\nhammerin’ McTurk’s trunk open in the dormitory when we took his watch\nlast month. Of course Manders sneaked to Mason, and Mason solemnly took\nit up as a case of theft, to get even with us about the rats.”\n\n“That just put Mason into our giddy hands,” said McTurk, blandly. “We\nwere nice to him, because he was a new master and wanted to win the\nconfidence of the boys. ‘Pity he draws inferences, though. Stalky went\nto his study and pretended to blub, and told Mason he’d lead a new life\nif Mason would let him off this time, but Mason wouldn’t. ‘Said it was\nhis duty to report him to the Head.”\n\n“Vindictive swine!” said Beetle. “It was all those rats! Then _I_\nblubbed, too, and Stalky confessed that he’d been a thief in regular\npractice for six years, ever since he came to the school; and that I’d\ntaught him--_a la_ Fagin. Mason turned white with joy. He thought he had\nus on toast.”\n\n“Gorgeous! Gorgeous!” said Dick Four. “We never heard of this.”\n\n“‘Course not. Mason kept it jolly quiet. He wrote down all our\nstatements on impot-paper. There wasn’t anything he wouldn’t believe,”\n said Stalky.\n\n“And handed it all up to the Head, _with_ an extempore prayer. It took\nabout forty pages,” said Beetle. “I helped him a lot.”\n\n“And then, you crazy idiots?” said Abanazar.\n\n“Oh, we were sent for; and Stalky asked to have the ‘depositions’ read\nout, and the Head knocked him spinning into a waste-paper basket. Then\nhe gave us eight cuts apiece--welters--for--for--takin’ unheard-of\nliberties with a new master. I saw his shoulders shaking when we went\nout. Do you know,” said Beetle, pensively, “that Mason can’t look at us\nnow in second lesson without blushing? We three stare at him sometimes\ntill he regularly trickles. He’s an awfully sensitive beast.”\n\n“He read ‘Eric, or Little by Little,’” said McTurk; “so we gave him ‘St.\nWinifred’s, or the World of School.’ They spent all their spare time\nstealing at St. Winifred’s, when they weren’t praying or getting drunk\nat pubs. Well, that was only a week ago, and the Head’s a little bit shy\nof us. He called it constructive deviltry. Stalky invented it all.”\n\n“Not the least good having a row with a master unless you can make an\nass of him,” said Stalky, extended at ease on the hearth-rug. “If Mason\ndidn’t know Number Five--well, he’s learnt, that’s all. Now, my dearly\nbeloved ‘earers”--Stalky curled his legs under him and addressed the\ncompany--“we’ve got that strong’, perseverin’ man King on our hands. He\nwent miles out of his way to provoke a conflict.” (Here Stalky snapped\ndown the black silk domino and assumed the air of a judge.) “He has\noppressed Beetle, McTurk, and me, _privatim et seriatim_, one by one,\nas he could catch us. But now, he has insulted Number Five up in\nthe music-room, and in the presence of these--these ossifers of the\nNinety-third, wot look like hairdressers. Binjimin, we must make him cry\n‘Capivi!’”\n\nStalky’s reading did not include Browning or Ruskin.\n\n“And, besides,” said McTurk, “he’s a Philistine, a basket-hanger. He\nwears a tartan tie. Ruskin says that any man who wears a tartan tie\nwill, without doubt, be damned everlastingly.”\n\n“Bravo, McTurk,” said Tertius; “I thought he was only a beast.”\n\n“He’s that, too, of course, but he’s worse. He has a china basket with\nblue ribbons and a pink kitten on it, hung up in his window to grow musk\nin. You know when I got all that old oak carvin’ out of Bideford Church,\nwhen they were restoring it (Ruskin says that any man who’ll restore a\nchurch is an unmitigated sweep), and stuck it up here with glue? Well,\nKing came in and wanted to know whether we’d done it with a fret-saw!\nYah! He is the King of basket-hangers!”\n\nDown went McTurk’s inky thumb over an imaginary arena full of bleeding\nKings. “_Placete_, child of a generous race!” he cried to Beetle.\n\n“Well,” began Beetle, doubtfully, “he comes from Balliol, but I’m going\nto give the beast a chance. You see I can always make him hop with\nsome more poetry. He can’t report me to the Head, because it makes him\nridiculous. (Stalky’s quite right.) But he shall have his chance.”\n\nBeetle opened the book on the table, ran his finger down a page, and\nbegan at random:\n\n   “Or who in Moscow toward the Czar\n   With the demurest of footfalls,\n   Over the Kremlin’s pavement white\n   With serpentine and syenite,\n   Steps with five other generals--”\n\n“That’s no good. Try another,” said Stalky.\n\n“Hold on a shake; I know what’s coming.” McTurk was reading over\nBeetle’s shoulder.\n\n   “That simultaneously take snuff,\n   For each to have pretext enough\n   And kerchiefwise unfold his sash,\n   Which--softness’ self--is yet the stuff\n\n(Gummy! What a sentence!)\n\n   To hold fast where a steel chain snaps\n   And leave the grand white neck no gash.\n\n(Full stop.)”\n\n“‘Don’t understand a word of it,” said Stalky.\n\n“More fool you! Construe,” said McTurk. “Those six bargees scragged the\nCzar, and left no evidence. _Actum est_ with King.”\n\n“He gave me that book, too,” said Beetle, licking his lips:\n\n   “There’s a great text in Galatians,\n   Once you trip on it entails\n   Twenty-nine distinct damnations,\n   One sure if another fails.”\n\nThen irrelevantly:\n\n   “Setebos! Setebos! and Setebos!\n   Thinketh he liveth in the cold of the moon.”\n\n“He’s just come in from dinner,” said Dick Four, looking through the\nwindow. “Manders minor is with him.”\n\n“‘Safest place for Manders minor just now,” said Beetle.\n\n“Then you chaps had better clear out,” said Stalky politely to the\nvisitors. “‘Tisn’t fair to mix you up in a study row. Besides, we can’t\nafford to have evidence.”\n\n“Are you going to begin at once?’ said Aladdin.\n\n“Immediately, if not sooner,” said Stalky, and turned out the gas.\n“Strong, perseverin’ man--King. Make him cry ‘Capivi.’ G’way, Binjimin.”\n\nThe company retreated to their own neat and spacious study with\nexpectant souls.\n\n“When Stalky blows out his nostrils like a horse,” said Aladdin to the\nEmperor of China, “he’s on the war-path. ‘Wonder what King will get.”\n\n“Beans,” said the Emperor. “Number Five generally pays in full.”\n\n“Wonder if I ought to take any notice of it officially,” said Abanazar,\nwho had just remembered he was a prefect.\n\n“It’s none of your business, Pussy. Besides, if you did, we’d have them\nhostile to us; and we shouldn’t be able to do any work,” said Aladdin.\n“They’ve begun already.”\n\nNow that West-African war-drum had been made to signal across estuaries\nand deltas. Number Five was forbidden to wake the engine within earshot\nof the school. But a deep, devastating drone filled the passages as\nMcTurk and Beetle scientifically rubbed its top. Anon it changed to the\nblare of trumpets--of savage pursuing trumpets. Then, as McTurk slapped\none side, smooth with the blood of ancient sacrifice, the roar broke\ninto short coughing howls such as the wounded gorilla throws in his\nnative forest. These were followed by the wrath of King--three steps\nat a time, up the staircase, with a dry whir of the gown. Aladdin and\ncompany, listening, squeaked with excitement as the door crashed open.\nKing stumbled into the darkness, and cursed those performers by the gods\nof Balliol and quiet repose.\n\n“Turned out for a week,” said Aladdin, holding the study door on the\ncrack. “Key to be brought down to his study in five minutes. ‘Brutes!\nBarbarians! Savages! Children!’ He’s rather agitated. ‘Arrah, Patsy,\nmind the baby,’” he sang in a whisper as he clung to the door-knob,\ndancing a noiseless war-dance.\n\nKing went down-stairs again, and Beetle and McTurk lit the gas to confer\nwith Stalky. But Stalky had vanished.\n\n“Looks like no end of a mess,” said Beetle, collecting his books and\nmathematical instrument case. “A week in the form-rooms isn’t any\nadvantage to us.”\n\n“Yes, but don’t you see that Stalky isn’t here, you owl!” said McTurk.\n“Take down the key, and look sorrowful. King’ll only jaw you for half an\nhour. I’m going to read in the lower form-room.”\n\n“But it’s always me,” mourned Beetle.\n\n“Wait till we see,” said McTurk, hopefully. “I don’t know any more than\nyou do what Stalky means, but it’s something. Go down and draw King’s\nfire. You’re used to it.”\n\nNo sooner had the key turned in the door than the lid of the coal-box,\nwhich was also the window-seat, lifted cautiously. It had been a tight\nfit, even for the lithe Stalky, his head between his knees, and his\nstomach under his right ear. From a drawer in the table he took a\nwell-worn catapult, a handful of buckshot, and a duplicate key of the\nstudy; noiselessly he raised the window and kneeled by it, his face\nturned to the road, the wind-sloped trees, the dark levels of the\nBurrows, and the white line of breakers falling nine-deep along the\nPebbleridge. Far down the steep-banked Devonshire lane he heard the\nhusky hoot of the carrier’s horn. There was a ghost of melody in it, as\nit might have been the wind in a gin-bottle essaying to sing, “It’s a\nway we have in the Army.”\n\nStalky smiled a tight-lipped smile, and at extreme range opened fire:\nthe old horse half wheeled in the shafts.\n\n“Where he gwaine tu?” hiccoughed Rabbits-Eggs. Another buckshot tore\nthrough the rotten canvas tilt with a vicious zipp.\n\n“_Habet_!” murmured Stalky, as Rabbits-Eggs swore into the patient\nnight, protesting that he saw the “dommed colleger” who was assaulting\nhim.\n\n“And so,” King was saying in a high head voice to Beetle, whom he had\nkept to play with before Manders minor, well knowing that it hurts\na Fifth-form boy to be held up to a fag’s derision, “and so, Master\nBeetle, in spite of all our verses, which we are so proud of, when\nwe presume to come into direct conflict with even so humble a\nrepresentative of authority as myself, for instance, we are turned out\nof our studies, are we not?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Beetle, with a sheepish grin on his lips and murder in\nhis heart. Hope had nearly left him, but he clung to a well-established\nfaith that never was Stalky so dangerous as when he was invisible.\n\n“You are _not_ required to criticise, thank you. Turned out of our\nstudies, we are, just as if we were no better than little Manders minor.\nOnly inky schoolboys we are, and must be treated as such.”\n\nBeetle pricked up his ears, for Rabbits-Eggs was swearing savagely\non the road, and some of the language entered at the upper sash. King\nbelieved in ventilation. He strode to the window gowned and majestic,\nvery visible in the gaslight.\n\n“I zee ‘un! I zee ‘un!” roared Rabbits-Eggs, now that he had found a\nvisible foe--another shot from the darkness above. “Yiss, yeou, yeou\nlong-nosed, fower-eyed, gingy-whiskered beggar! Yeu’m tu old for such\ngoin’s on. Aie! Poultice yeour nose, I tall ‘ee! Poultice yeour long\nnose!”\n\nBeetle’s heart leaped up within him. Somewhere, somehow, he knew, Stalky\nmoved behind these manifestations. There were hope and the prospect\nof revenge. He would embody the suggestion about the nose in deathless\nverse. King threw up the window, and sternly rebuked Rabbits-Eggs. But\nthe carrier was beyond fear or fawning. He had descended from the cart,\nand was stooping by the roadside.\n\nIt all fell swiftly as a dream. Manders minor raised his hand to his\nhead with a cry, as a jagged flint cannoned on to some rich tree-calf\nbindings in the book-shelf. Another quoited along the writing-table.\nBeetle made zealous feint to stop it, and in that endeavor overturned\na student’s lamp, which dripped, _via_ King’s papers and some choice\nbooks, greasily on to a Persian rug. There was much broken glass on the\nwindow-seat; the china basket--McTurk’s aversion--cracked to flinders,\nhad dropped her musk plant and its earth over the red rep cushions;\nManders minor was bleeding profusely from a cut on the cheek-bone; and\nKing, using strange words, every one of which Beetle treasured, ran\nforth to find the school-sergeant, that Rabbits-Eggs might be instantly\ncast into jail.\n\n“Poor chap!” said Beetle, with a false, feigned sympathy. “Let it\nbleed a little. That’ll prevent apoplexy,” and he held the blind head\nskilfully over the table, and the papers on the table, as he guided the\nhowling Manders to the door.\n\nThen did Beetle, alone with the wreckage, return good for evil. How, in\nthat office, a complete set of “Gibbon” was scarred all along the back\nas by a flint; how so much black and copying ink came to be mingled with\nManders’s gore on the table-cloth; why the big gum-bottle, unstoppered,\nhad rolled semicircularly across the floor; and in what manner the white\nchina door-knob grew to be painted with yet more of Manders’s young\nblood, were matters which Beetle did not explain when the rabid King\nreturned to find him standing politely over the reeking hearth-rug.\n\n“You never told me to go, sir,” he said, with the air of Casabianca, and\nKing consigned him to the outer darkness.\n\nBut it was to a boot-cupboard under the staircase on the ground floor\nthat he hastened, to loose the mirth that was destroying him. He had\nnot drawn breath for a first whoop of triumph when two hands choked him\ndumb.\n\n“Go to the dormitory and get me my things. Bring ‘em to Number Five\nlavatory. I’m still in tights,” hissed Stalky, sitting on his head.\n“Don’t run. Walk.”\n\nBut Beetle staggered into the form-room next door, and delegated his\nduty to the yet unenlightened McTurk, with an hysterical precis of the\ncampaign thus far. So it was McTurk, of the wooden visage, who brought\nthe clothes from the dormitory while Beetle panted on a form. Then the\nthree buried themselves in Number Five lavatory, turned on all the taps,\nfilled the place with steam, and dropped weeping into the baths, where\nthey pieced out the war.\n\n“_Moi_! _Je_! _Ich_! _Ego_!” gasped Stalky. “I waited till I\ncouldn’t hear myself think, while you played the drum! Hid in the\ncoal-locker--and tweaked Rabbits-Eggs--and Rabbits-Eggs rocked King.\nWasn’t it beautiful? Did you hear the glass?”\n\n“Why, he--he--he,” shrieked McTurk, one trembling finger pointed at\nBeetle.\n\n“Why, I--I--I was through it all,” Beetle howled; “in his study, being\njawed.”\n\n“Oh, my soul!” said Stalky with a yell, disappearing under water.\n\n“The--the glass was nothing. Manders minor’s head’s cut open.\nLa--la--lamp upset all over the rug. Blood on the books and papers. The\ngum! The gum! The gum! The ink! The ink! The ink! Oh, Lord!”\n\nThen Stalky leaped out, all pink as he was, and shook Beetle into some\nsort of coherence; but his tale prostrated them afresh.\n\n“I bunked for the boot-cupboard the second I heard King go down-stairs.\nBeetle tumbled in on top of me. The spare key’s hid behind the loose\nboard. There isn’t a shadow of evidence,” said Stalky. They were all\nchanting together.\n\n“And he turned us out himself--himself--himself!” This from McTurk. “He\ncan’t begin to suspect us. Oh, Stalky, it’s the loveliest thing we’ve\never done.”\n\n“Gum! Gum! Dollops of gum!” shouted Beetle, his spectacles gleaming\nthrough a sea of lather. “Ink and blood all mixed. I held the little\nbeast’s head all over the Latin proses for Monday. Golly, how the oil\nstunk! And Rabbits-Eggs told King to poultice his nose! Did you hit\nRabbits-Eggs, Stalky?”\n\n“Did I jolly well not? Tweaked him all over. Did you hear him curse? Oh,\nI shall be sick in a minute if I don’t stop.”\n\nBut dressing was a slow process, because McTurk was obliged to dance\nwhen he heard that the musk basket was broken, and, moreover, Beetle\nretailed all King’s language with emendations and purple insets.\n\n“Shockin’!” said Stalky, collapsing in a helpless welter of half-hitched\ntrousers. “So dam’ bad, too, for innocent boys like us! Wonder what\nthey’d say at ‘St. Winifred’s, or the World of School.’--By gum! That\nreminds me we owe the Lower Third one for assaultin’ Beetle when he\nchivied Manders minor. Come on! It’s an alibi, Samivel; and, besides, if\nwe let ‘em off they’ll be worse next time.”\n\nThe Lower Third had set a guard upon their form-room for the space of a\nfull hour, which to a boy is a lifetime. Now they were busy with their\nSaturday evening businesses--cooking sparrows over the gas with\nrusty nibs; brewing unholy drinks in gallipots; skinning moles with\npocket-knives; attending to paper trays full of silkworms, or discussing\nthe iniquities of their elders with a freedom, fluency, and point that\nwould have amazed their parents. The blow fell without warning. Stalky\nupset a form crowded with small boys among their own cooking utensils,\nMcTurk raided the untidy lockers as a terrier digs at a rabbit-hole,\nwhile Beetle poured ink upon such heads as he could not appeal to with\na Smith’s Classical Dictionary. Three brisk minutes accounted for many\nsilkworms, pet larvae, French exercises, school caps, half-prepared\nbones and skulls, and a dozen pots of home-made sloe jam. It was a great\nwreckage, and the form-room looked as though three conflicting tempests\nhad smitten it.\n\n“Phew!” said Stalky, drawing breath outside the door (amid groans of\n“Oh, you beastly ca-ads! You think yourselves awful funny,” and so\nforth). “_That’s_ all right. Never let the sun go down upon your wrath.\nRummy little devils, fags. Got no notion o’ combinin’.”\n\n“Six of ‘em sat on my head when I went in after Manders minor,” said\nBeetle. “I warned ‘em what they’d get, though.”\n\n“Everybody paid in full--beautiful feelin’,” said McTurk absently, as\nthey strolled along the corridor. “Don’t think we’d better say much\nabout King, though, do you, Stalky?”\n\n“Not _much_. Our line is injured innocence, of course--same as when the\nSergeant reported us on suspicion of smoking in the bunkers. If I hadn’t\nthought of buyin’ the pepper and spillin’ it all over our clothes,\nhe’d have smelt us. King was gha-astly facetious about that. ‘Called us\nbird-stuffers in form for a week.”\n\n“Ah, King hates the Natural History Society because little Hartopp is\npresident. Mustn’t do anything in the Coll. without glorifyin’ King,”\n said McTurk. “But he must be a putrid ass, know, to suppose at our time\no’ life we’d go and stuff birds like fags.”\n\n“Poor old King!” said Beetle. “He’s unpopular in Common-room, and\nthey’ll chaff his head off about Rabbits-Eggs. Golly! How lovely! How\nbeautiful! How holy! But you should have seen his face when the first\nrock came in! _And_ the earth from the basket!”\n\nSo they were all stricken helpless for five minutes.\n\nThey repaired at last to Abanazar’s study, and were received reverently.\n\n“What’s the matter?” said Stalky, quick to realize new atmospheres.\n\n“You know jolly well,” said Abanazar. “You’ll be expelled if you get\ncaught. King is a gibbering maniac.”\n\n“Who? Which? What? Expelled for how? We only played the war-drum. We’ve\ngot turned out for that already.”\n\n“Do you chaps mean to say you didn’t make Rabbits-Eggs drunk and bribe\nhim to rock King’s rooms?”\n\n“Bribe him? No, that I’ll swear we didn’t,” said Stalky, with a relieved\nheart, for he loved not to tell lies. “What a low mind you’ve got,\nPussy! We’ve been down having a bath. Did Rabbits-Eggs rock King?\nStrong, perseverin’ man King? Shockin’!”\n\n“Awf’ly. King’s frothing at the mouth. There’s bell for prayers. Come\non.”\n\n“Wait a sec,” said Stalky, continuing the conversation in a loud and\ncheerful voice, as they descended the stairs. “What did Rabbits-Eggs\nrock King for?”\n\n“I know,” said Beetle, as they passed King’s open door. “I was in his\nstudy.”\n\n“Hush, you ass!” hissed the Emperor of China. “Oh, he’s gone down to\nprayers,” said Beetle, watching the shadow of the house-master on the\nwall. “Rabbits-Eggs was only a bit drunk, swearin’ at his horse, and\nKing jawed him through the window, and then, of course, he rocked King.”\n\n“Do you mean to say,” said Stalky, “that King began it?”\n\nKing was behind them, and every well-weighed word went up the staircase\nlike an arrow. “I can only swear,” said Beetle, “that King cursed like a\nbargee. Simply disgustin’. I’m goin’ to write to my father about it.”\n\n“Better report it to Mason,” suggested Stalky. “He knows our tender\nconsciences. Hold on a shake. I’ve got to tie my boot-lace.”\n\nThe other study hurried forward. They did not wish to be dragged into\nstage asides of this nature. So it was left to McTurk to sum up the\nsituation beneath the guns of the enemy.\n\n“You see,” said the Irishman, hanging on the banister, “he begins by\nbullying little chaps; then he bullies the big chaps; then he bullies\nsome one who isn’t connected with the College, and then catches it.\nServes him jolly well right... I beg your pardon, sir. I didn’t see you\nwere coming down the staircase.”\n\nThe black gown tore past like a thunder-storm, and in its wake, three\nabreast, arms linked, the Aladdin company rolled up the big corridor to\nprayers, singing with most innocent intention:\n\n   “Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby! Arrah, Patsy, mind the child!\n   Wrap him up in an overcoat, he’s surely goin’ wild!\n   Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby; just ye mind the child awhile!\n   He’ll kick an’ bite an’ cry all night! Arrah, Patsy, mind\n     the child!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. AN UNSAVORY INTERLUDE.\n\n\nIt was a maiden aunt of Stalky who sent him both books, with the\ninscription, “To dearest Artie, on his sixteenth birthday;” it was\nMcTurk who ordered their hypothecation; and it was Beetle, returned from\nBideford, who flung them on the window-sill of Number Five study with\nnews that Bastable would advance but ninepence on the two; “Eric; or,\nLittle by Little,” being almost as great a drug as “St. Winifred’s.”\n “An’ I don’t think much of your aunt. We’re nearly out of cartridges,\ntoo--Artie, dear.”\n\nWhereupon Stalky rose up to grapple with him, but McTurk sat on Stalky’s\nhead, calling him a “pure-minded boy” till peace was declared. As they\nwere grievously in arrears with a Latin prose, as it was a blazing July\nafternoon, and as they ought to have been at a house cricket-match,\nthey began to renew their acquaintance, intimate and unholy, with the\nvolumes.\n\n“Here we are!” said McTurk. “‘Corporal punishment produced on Eric the\nworst effects. He burned _not_ with remorse or regret’--make a note o’\nthat, Beetle--’ but with shame and violent indignation. He glared’--oh,\nnaughty Eric! Let’s get to where he goes in for drink.”\n\n“Hold on half a shake. Here’s another sample. ‘The Sixth,’ he says, ‘is\nthe palladium of all public schools.’ But this lot--” Stalky rapped the\ngilded book--“can’t prevent fellows drinkin’ and stealin’, an’ lettin’\nfags out of window at night, an’--an’ doin’ what they please. Golly,\nwhat we’ve missed--not goin’ to St. Winifred’s!...”\n\n“I’m sorry to see any boys of my house taking so little interest in\ntheir matches.”\n\nMr. Prout could move very silently if he pleased, though that is\nno merit in a boy’s eyes. He had flung open the study-door without\nknocking--another sin--and looked at them suspiciously. “Very sorry,\nindeed, I am to see you frowsting in your studies.”\n\n“We’ve been out ever since dinner, sir,” said. McTurk wearily. One\nhouse-match is just like another, and their “ploy” of that week happened\nto be rabbit-shooting with saloon-pistols.\n\n“I can’t see a ball when it’s coming, sir,” said Beetle. “I’ve had my\ngig-lamps smashed at the Nets till I got excused. I wasn’t any good even\nas a fag, then, sir.”\n\n“Tuck is probably your form. Tuck and brewing. Why can’t you three take\nany interest in the honor of your house?”\n\nThey had heard that phrase till they were wearied. The “honor of the\nhouse” was Prout’s weak point, and they knew well how to flick him on\nthe raw.\n\n“If you order us to go down, sir, of course we’ll go,” said Stalky, with\nmaddening politeness. But Prout knew better than that. He had tried the\nexperiment once at a big match, when the three, self-isolated, stood\nto attention for half an hour in full view of all the visitors, to whom\nfags, subsidized for that end, pointed them out as victims of Prout’s\ntyranny. And Prout was a sensitive man.\n\nIn the infinitely petty confederacies of the Common-room, King and\nMacrea, fellow house-masters, had borne it in upon him that by games,\nand games alone, was salvation wrought. Boys neglected were boys lost.\nThey must be disciplined. Left to himself, Prout would have made\na sympathetic house-master; but he was never so left, and with the\ndevilish insight of youth, the boys knew to whom they were indebted for\nhis zeal.\n\n“Must we go down, sir?’ said McTurk.\n\n“I don’t want to order you to do what a right-thinking boy should do\ngladly. I’m sorry.” And he lurched out with some hazy impression that he\nhad sown good seed on poor ground.\n\n“Now what does he suppose is the use of that?” said Beetle.\n\n“Oh, he’s cracked. King jaws him in Common-room about not keepin’ us up\nto the mark, an’ Macrea burbles about ‘dithcipline,’ an’ old Heffy sits\nbetween ‘em sweatin’ big drops. I heard Oke (the Common-room butler)\ntalking to Richards (Prout’s house-servant) about it down in the\nbasement the other day when I went down to bag some bread,” said Stalky.\n\n“What did Oke say?” demanded McTurk, throwing “Eric” into a corner.\n\n“Oh, he said, ‘They make more nise nor a nest full o’ jackdaws, an’ half\nof it like we’d no ears to our heads that waited on ‘em. They talks over\nold Prout--what he’ve done an’ left undone about his boys. An’ how their\nboys be fine boys, an’ his’n be dom bad.’ Well, Oke talked like that,\nyou know, and Richards got awf’ly wrathy. He has a down on King for\nsomething or other. Wonder why?”\n\n“Why, King talks about Prout in form-room--makes allusions, an’ all\nthat--only half the chaps are such asses they can’t see what he’s\ndrivin’ at. And d’you remember what he said about the ‘Casual House’\nlast Tuesday? He meant us. They say he says perfectly beastly things to\nhis own house, making fun of Prout’s,” said Beetle.\n\n“Well, we didn’t come here to mix up in their rows,” McTurk said\nwrathfully. “Who’ll bathe after call-over? King’s takin’ it in the\ncricket-field. Come on.” Turkey seized his straw and led the way.\n\nThey reached the sun-blistered pavilion over against the gray\nPebbleridge just before roll-call, and, asking no questions, gathered\nfrom King’s voice and manner that his house was on the road to victory.\n\n“Ah, ha!” said he, turning to show the light of his countenance. “Here\nwe have the ornaments of the Casual House at last. You consider cricket\nbeneath you, I believe “--the crowd, flannelled, sniggered “and from\nwhat I have seen this afternoon, I fancy many others of your house hold\nthe same view. And may I ask what you purpose to do with your noble\nselves till tea-time?”\n\n“Going down to bathe, sir,” said Stalky.\n\n“And whence this sudden zeal for cleanliness? There is nothing about you\nthat particularly suggests it. Indeed, so far as I remember--I may be at\nfault--but a short time ago--”\n\n“Five years, sir,” said Beetle hotly.\n\nKing scowled. “_One_ of you was that thing called a water-funk. Yes,\na water-funk. So now you wish to wash? It is well. Cleanliness never\ninjured a boy or--a house. We will proceed to business,” and he\naddressed himself to the call-over board.\n\n“What the deuce did you say anything to him for, Beetle?” said McTurk\nangrily, as they strolled towards the big, open sea-baths.\n\n“‘Twasn’t fair--remindin’ one of bein’ a water-funk. My first term, too.\nHeaps of chaps are--when they can’t swim.”\n\n“Yes, you ass; but he saw he’d fetched you. You ought never to answer\nKing.”\n\n“But it wasn’t fair, Stalky.”\n\n“My Hat! You’ve been here six years, and you expect fairness. Well, you\nare a dithering idiot.”\n\nA knot of King’s boys, also bound for the baths, hailed them, beseeching\nthem to wash--for the honor of their house.\n\n“That’s what comes of King’s jawin’ and messin’. Those young animals\nwouldn’t have thought of it unless he’d put it into their heads. Now\nthey’ll be funny about it for weeks,” said Stalky. “Don’t take any\nnotice.”\n\nThe boys came nearer, shouting an opprobrious word. At last they moved\nto windward, ostentatiously holding their noses.\n\n“That’s pretty,” said Beetle. “They’ll be sayin’ our house stinks next.”\n\nWhen they returned from the baths, damp-headed, languid, at peace with\nthe world, Beetle’s forecast came only too true. They were met in the\ncorridor by a fag--a common, Lower-Second fag--who at arm’s length\nhanded them a carefully wrapped piece of soap “with the compliments of\nKing’s House.”\n\n“Hold on,” said Stalky, checking immediate attack. “Who put you up\nto this, Nixon? Rattray and White? (Those were two leaders in King’s\nhouse.) Thank you. There’s no answer.”\n\n“Oh, it’s too sickening to have this kind o’ rot shoved on to a chap.\nWhat’s the sense of it? What’s the fun of it?” said McTurk.\n\n“It will go on to the end of the term, though,” Beetle wagged his head\nsorrowfully. He had worn many jests threadbare on his own account.\n\nIn a few days it became an established legend of the school that Prout’s\nhouse did not wash and were therefore noisome. Mr. King was pleased to\nsmile succulently in form when one of his boys drew aside from Beetle\nwith certain gestures.\n\n“There seems to be some disability attaching to you, my Beetle, or else\nwhy should Burton major withdraw, so to speak, the hem of his garments?\nI confess I am still in the dark. Will some one be good enough to\nenlighten me?”\n\nNaturally, he was enlightened by half the form.\n\n“Extraordinary! Most extraordinary! However, each house has its\ntraditions, with which I would not for the world interfere.\n_We_ have a prejudice in favor of washing. Go on, Beetle--from\n‘_jugurtha tamen_’--and, if you can, avoid the more flagrant forms of\nguessing.”\n\nProut’s house was furious because Macrea’s and Hartopp’s houses joined\nKing’s to insult them. They called a house-meeting after dinner--an\nexcited and angry meeting of all save the prefects, whose dignity,\nthough they sympathized, did not allow them to attend. They read\nungrammatical resolutions, and made speeches beginning, “Gentlemen, we\nhave met on this occasion,” and ending with, “It’s a beastly shame,”\n precisely as houses have done since time and schools began.\n\nNumber Five study attended, with its usual air of bland patronage. At\nlast McTurk, of the lanthorn jaws, delivered himself:\n\n“You jabber and jaw and burble, and that’s about all you can do. What’s\nthe good of it? King’s house’ll only gloat because they’ve drawn\nyou, and King will gloat, too. Besides, that resolution of Orrin’s is\nchock-full of bad grammar, and King’ll gloat over that.”\n\n“I thought you an’ Beetle would put it right, an’--an’ we’d post it in\nthe corridor,” said the composer meekly.\n\n“_Par si je le connai_. I’m not goin’ to meddle with the biznai,” said\nBeetle. “It’s a gloat for King’s house. Turkey’s quite right.”\n\n“Well, won’t Stalky, then?”\n\nBut Stalky puffed out his cheeks and squinted down his nose in the style\nof Panurge, and all he said was, “Oh, you abject burblers!”\n\n“You’re three beastly scabs!” was the instant retort of the democracy,\nand they went out amid execrations.\n\n“This is piffling,” said McTurk. “Let’s get our sallies, and go and\nshoot bunnies.”\n\nThree saloon-pistols, with a supply of bulleted breech-caps, were stored\nin Stalky’s trunk, and this trunk was in their dormitory, and\ntheir dormitory was a three-bed attic one, opening out of a ten-bed\nestablishment, which, in turn, communicated with the great range of\ndormitories that ran practically from one end of the College to the\nother. Macrea’s house lay next to Prout’s, King’s next to Macrea’s, and\nHartopp’s beyond that again. Carefully locked doors divided house from\nhouse, but each house, in its internal arrangements--the College had\noriginally been a terrace of twelve large houses--was a replica of the\nnext; one straight roof covering all.\n\nThey found Stalky’s bed drawn out from the wall to the left of the\ndormer window, and the latter end of Richards protruding from a\ntwo-foot-square cupboard in the wall.\n\n“What’s all this? I’ve never noticed it before. What are you tryin’ to\ndo, Fatty?”\n\n“Fillin’ basins, Muster Corkran.” Richards’s voice was hollow and\nmuffled. “They’ve been savin’ me trouble. Yiss.”\n\n“‘Looks like it,” said McTurk. “Hi! You’ll stick if you don’t take\ncare.”\n\nRichards backed puffing.\n\n“I can’t rache un. Yiss, ‘tess a turncock, Muster McTurk. They’ve took\nan’ runned all the watter-pipes a storey higher in the houses--runned\n‘em all along under the ‘ang of the heaves, like. Runned ‘em in last\nholidays. _I_ can’t rache the turncock.”\n\n“Let me try,” said Stalky, diving into the aperture.\n\n“Slip ‘ee to the left, then, Muster Corkran. Slip ‘ee to the left, an’\nfeel in the dark.”\n\nTo the left Stalky wriggled, and saw a long line of lead pipe\ndisappearing up a triangular tunnel, whose roof was the rafters and\nboarding of the college roof, whose floor was sharp-edged joists, and\nwhose side was the rough studding of the lath and plaster wall under the\ndormer.\n\n“Rummy show. How far does it go?”\n\n“Right along, Muster Corkran--right along from end to end. Her runs\nunder the ‘ang of the heaves. Have ‘ee rached the stopcock yet? Mr. King\ngot un put in to save us carryin’ watter from down-stairs to fill the\nbasins. No place for a lusty man like old Richards. I’m tu thickabout to\ngo ferritin’. Thank ‘ee, Muster Corkran.”\n\nThe water squirted through the tap just inside the cupboard, and, having\nfilled the basins, the grateful Richards waddled away.\n\nThe boys sat round-eyed on their beds considering the possibilities of\nthis trove. Two floors below them they could hear the hum of the angry\nhouse; for nothing is so still as a dormitory in mid-afternoon of a\nmidsummer term.\n\n“It has been papered over till now.” McTurk examined the little door.\n“If we’d only known before!”\n\n“I vote we go down and explore. No one will come up this time o’ day. We\nneedn’t keep _cave’_.”\n\nThey crawled in, Stalky leading, drew the door behind them, and on all\nfours embarked on a dark and dirty road full of plaster, odd shavings,\nand all the raffle that builders leave in the waste room of a house.\nThe passage was perhaps three feet wide, and, except for the struggling\nlight round the edges of the cupboards (there was one to each dormer),\nalmost pitchy dark.\n\n“Here’s Macrea’s house,” said Stalky, his eye at the crack of the third\ncupboard. “I can see Barnes’s name on his trunk. Don’t make such a row,\nBeetle! We can get right to the end of the Coll. Come on!... We’re in\nKing’s house now--I can see a bit of Rattray’s trunk. How these beastly\nboards hurt one’s knees!” They heard his nails scraping, on plaster.\n\n“That’s the ceiling below. Look out! If we smashed that the plaster ‘ud\nfall down in the lower dormitory,” said Beetle.\n\n“Let’s,” whispered McTurk.\n\n“An’ be collared first thing? Not much. Why, I can shove my hand ever so\nfar up between these boards.”\n\nStalky thrust an arm to the elbow between the joists.\n\n“No good stayin’ here. I vote we go back and talk it over. It’s a crummy\nplace. ‘Must say I’m grateful to King for his water-works.”\n\nThey crawled out, brushed one another clean, slid the saloon-pistols\ndown a trouser-leg, and hurried forth to a deep and solitary Devonshire\nlane in whose flanks a boy might sometimes slay a young rabbit. They\nthrew themselves down under the rank elder bushes, and began to think\naloud.\n\n“You know,” said Stalky at last, sighting at a distant sparrow, “we\ncould hide our sallies in there like anything.”\n\n“Huh!” Beetle snorted, choked, and gurgled. He had been silent since\nthey left the dormitory. “Did you ever read a book called ‘The History\nof a House’ or something? I got it out of the library the other day. A\nFrench woman wrote it--Violet somebody. But it’s translated, you know;\nand it’s very interestin’. Tells you how a house is built.”\n\n“Well, if you’re in a sweat to find out that, you can go down to the new\ncottages they’re building for the coastguard.”\n\n“My Hat! I will.” He felt in his pockets. “Give me tuppence, some one.”\n\n“Rot! Stay here, and don’t mess about in the sun.”\n\n“Gi’ me tuppence.”\n\n“I say, Beetle, you aren’t stuffy about anything, are you?” said McTurk,\nhanding over the coppers. His tone was serious, for though Stalky often,\nand McTurk occasionally, manoeuvred on his own account, Beetle had never\nbeen known to do so in all the history of the confederacy.\n\n“No, I’m not. I’m thinking.”\n\n“Well, we’ll come, too,” said Stalky, with a general’s suspicion of his\naides.\n\n“Don’t want you.”\n\n“Oh, leave him alone. He’s been taken worse with a poem,” said McTurk.\n“He’ll go burbling down to the Pebbleridge and spit it all up in the\nstudy when he comes back.”\n\n“Then why did he want the tuppence, Turkey? He’s gettin’ too beastly\nindependent. Hi! There’s a bunny. No, it ain’t. It’s a cat, by Jove! You\nplug first.”\n\nTwenty minutes later a boy with a straw hat at the back of his head, and\nhis hands in his pockets, was staring at workmen as they moved about\na half-finished cottage. He produced some ferocious tobacco, and\nwas passed from the forecourt into the interior, where he asked many\nquestions.\n\n“Well, let’s have your beastly epic,” said Turkey, as they burst into\nthe study, to find Beetle deep in Viollet-le-Duc and some drawings.\n“We’ve had no end of a lark.”\n\n“Epic? What epic? I’ve been down to the coastguard.”\n\n“No epic? Then we will slay you, O Beetle,” said Stalky, moving to the\nattack. “You’ve got something up your sleeve. _I_ know, when you talk in\nthat tone!”\n\n“Your Uncle Beetle”--with an attempt to imitate Stalky’s war-voice--“is\na great man.”\n\n“Oh, no; he jolly well isn’t anything of the kind. You deceive yourself,\nBeetle. Scrag him, Turkey!”\n\n“A great man,” Beetle gurgled from the floor. “_You_ are futile--look\nout for my tie!--futile burblers. I am the Great Man. I gloat. Ouch!\nHear me!”\n\n“Beetle, de-ah”--Stalky dropped unreservedly on Beetle’s chest--“we love\nyou, an’ you’re a poet. If I ever said you were a doggaroo, I apologize;\nbut you know as well as we do that you can’t do anything by yourself\nwithout mucking it.”\n\n“I’ve got a notion.”\n\n“And you’ll spoil the whole show if you don’t tell your Uncle Stalky.\nCough it up, ducky, and we’ll see what we can do. Notion, you fat\nimpostor--I knew you had a notion when you went away! Turkey said it was\na poem.”\n\n“I’ve found out how houses are built. Le’ me get up. The floor-joists of\none room are the ceiling-joists of the room below.”\n\n“Don’t be so filthy technical.”\n\n“Well, the man told me. The floor is laid on top of those joists--those\nboards on edge that we crawled over--but the floor stops at a partition.\nWell, if you get behind a partition, same as you did in the attic, don’t\nyou see that you can shove anything you please under the floor between\nthe floor-boards and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below? Look\nhere. I’ve drawn it.”\n\nHe produced a rude sketch, sufficient to enlighten the allies. There is\nno part of the modern school curriculum that deals with architecture,\nand none of them had yet reflected whether floors and ceilings were\nhollow or solid. Outside his own immediate interests the boy is as\nignorant as the savage he so admires; but he has also the savage’s\nresource.\n\n“I see,” said Stalky. “I shoved my hand there. An’ then?”\n\n“An’ then They’ve been calling us stinkers, you know. We might shove\nsomethin’ under--sulphur, or something that stunk pretty bad--an’ stink\n‘em out. I know it can be done somehow.” Beetle’s eyes turned to Stalky\nhandling the diagrams.\n\n“Stinks?” said Stalky interrogatively. Then his face grew luminous with\ndelight. “By gum! I’ve got it. Horrid stinks! Turkey!” He leaped at the\nIrishman. “This afternoon--just after Beetle went away! _She’s_ the very\nthing!”\n\n“Come to my arms, my beamish boy,” caroled McTurk, and they fell into\neach other’s arms dancing. “Oh, frabjous day! Calloo, callay! She will!\nShe will!”\n\n“Hold on,” said Beetle. “I don’t understand.”\n\n“Dearr man! It shall, though. Oh, Artie, my pure-souled youth, let us\ntell our darling Reggie about Pestiferous Stinkadores.”\n\n“Not until after call-over. Come on!”\n\n“I say,” said Orrin, stiffly, as they fell into their places along the\nwalls of the gymnasium. “The house are goin’ to hold another meeting.”\n\n“Hold away, then.” Stalky’s mind was elsewhere.\n\n“It’s about you three this time.”\n\n“All right, give ‘em my love... _Here, sir_,” and he tore down the\ncorridor.\n\nGamboling like kids at play, with bounds and sidestarts, with caperings\nand curvetings, they led the almost bursting Beetle to the rabbit-lane,\nand from under a pile of stones drew forth the new-slain corpse of a\ncat. Then did Beetle see the inner meaning of what had gone before, and\nlifted up his voice in thanksgiving for that the world held warriors so\nwise as Stalky and McTurk.\n\n“Well-nourished old lady, ain’t she?” said Stalky. “How long d’you\nsuppose it’ll take her to get a bit whiff in a confined space?”\n\n“Bit whiff! What a coarse brute you are!” said McTurk. “Can’t a poor\npussy-cat get under King’s dormitory floor to die without your pursuin’\nher with your foul innuendoes?”\n\n“What did she die under the floor for?’ said Beetle, looking to the\nfuture.\n\n“Oh, they won’t worry about that when they find her,” said Stalky.\n\n“A cat may look at a king.” McTurk rolled down the bank at his own\njest. “Pussy, you don’t know how useful you’re goin’ to be to three\npure-souled, high-minded boys.”\n\n“They’ll have to take up the floor for her, same as they did in Number\nNine when the rat croaked. Big medicine--heap big medicine! Phew! Oh,\nLord, I wish I could stop laughin’,” said Beetle.\n\n“Stinks! Hi, stinks! Clammy ones!” McTurk gasped as he regained his\nplace. “And”--the exquisite humor of it brought them sliding down\ntogether in a tangle--“it’s all for the honor of the house, too!”\n\n“An’ they’re holdin’ another meeting--on us,” Stalky panted, his knees\nin the ditch and his face in the long grass. “Well, let’s get the bullet\nout of her and hurry up. The sooner she’s bedded out the better.”\n\nBetween them they did some grisly work with a penknife; between them\n(ask not who buttoned her to his bosom) they took up the corpse and\nhastened back, Stalky arranging their plan of action at the full trot.\n\nThe afternoon sun, lying in broad patches on the bed-rugs, saw three\nboys and an umbrella disappear into a dormitory wall. In five minutes\nthey emerged, brushed themselves all over, washed their hands, combed\ntheir hair, and descended.\n\n“Are you sure you shoved her far enough under?” said McTurk suddenly.\n\n“Hang it, man, I shoved her the full length of my arm and Beetle’s\nbrolly. That must be about six feet. She’s bung in the middle of King’s\nbig upper ten-bedder. Eligible central situation, _I_ call it. She’ll\nstink out his chaps, and Hartopp’s and Macrea’s, when she really begins\nto fume. I swear your Uncle Stalky is a great man. Do you realize what a\ngreat man he is, Beetle?”\n\n“Well, I had the notion first, hadn’t I--? only--”\n\n“You couldn’t do it without your Uncle Stalky, could you?”\n\n“They’ve been calling us stinkers for a week now,” said McTurk. “Oh,\n_won’t_ they catch it!”\n\n“Stinker! Yah! Stink-ah!” rang down the corridor.\n\n“And she’s there,” said Stalky, a hand on either boy’s shoulder.\n“She--is--there, gettin’ ready to surprise ‘em. Presently she’ll begin\nto whisper to ‘em in their dreams. Then she’ll whiff. Golly, how she’ll\nwhiff! Oblige me by thinkin’ of it for two minutes.”\n\nThey went to their study in more or less of silence. There they began to\nlaugh--laugh as only boys can. They laughed with their foreheads on the\ntables, or on the floor; laughed at length, curled over the backs of\nchairs or clinging to a book-shelf; laughed themselves limp.\n\nAnd in the middle of it Orrin entered on behalf of the house. “Don’t\nmind us, Orrin; sit down. You don’t know how we respect and admire you.\nThere’s something about your pure, high young forehead, full of the\ndreams of innocent boyhood, that’s no end fetchin’. It is, indeed.”\n\n“The house sent me to give you this.” He laid a folded sheet of paper on\nthe table and retired with an awful front.\n\n“It’s the resolution! Oh, read it, some one. I’m too silly-sick\nwith laughin’ to see,” said Beetle. Stalky jerked it open with a\nprecautionary sniff. “Phew! Phew! Listen. ‘_The house notices with pain\nand contempt the attitude of indiference_’ --how many f’s in\nindifference, Beetle?”\n\n“Two for choice.”\n\n“Only one here--adopted by the occupants of Number Five study in\nrelation to the insults offered to Mr. Prout’s house at the recent\nmeeting in Number Twelve form-room, and the House hereby pass a\nvote of censure on the said study. That’s all.”\n\n“And she bled all down my shirt, too!” said Beetle.\n\n“An’ I’m catty all over,” said McTurk, “though I washed twice.”\n\n“An’ I nearly broke Beetle’s brolly plantin’ her where she would\nblossom!”\n\nThe situation was beyond speech, but not laughter. There was some\nattempt that night to demonstrate against the three in their dormitory;\nso they came forth.\n\n“You see,” Beetle began suavely as he loosened his braces, “the trouble\nwith you is that you’re a set of unthinkin’ asses. You’ve no more brains\nthan spidgers. We’ve told you that heaps of times, haven’t we?”\n\n“We’ll give the three of you a dormitory lickin’. You always jaw at us\nas if you were prefects,” cried one.\n\n“Oh, no, you won’t,” said Stalky, “because you know that if you did\nyou’d get the worst of it sooner or later. _We_ aren’t in any hurry. We\ncan afford to wait for our little revenges. You’ve made howlin’ asses\nof yourselves, and just as soon as King gets hold of your precious\nresolutions to-morrow you’ll find that out. If you aren’t sick an’ sorry\nby to-morrow night, I’ll--I’ll eat my hat.”\n\nBut or ever the dinner-bell rang the next day Prout’s were sadly aware\nof their error. King received stray members of that house with an\nexaggerated attitude of fear. Did they purpose to cause him to be\ndismissed from the College by unanimous resolution? What were their\nviews concerning the government of the school, that he might hasten\nto give effect to them? he would not offend them for worlds; but\nhe feared--he sadly feared--that his own house, who did not pass\nresolutions (but washed), might somewhat deride.\n\nKing was a happy man, and his house, basking in the favor of his smile,\nmade that afternoon a long penance to the misled Prouts. And Prout\nhimself, with a dull and lowering visage, tried to think out the rights\nand wrongs of it all, only plunging deeper into bewilderment. Why should\nhis house be called “Stinkers”? Truly, it was a small thing, but he had\nbeen trained to believe that straws show which way the wind blows, and\nthat there is no smoke without fire. He approached King in Common-room\nwith a sense of injustice, but King was pleased to be full of airy\npersiflage that tide, and brilliantly danced dialectical rings round\nProut.\n\n“Now,” said Stalky at bedtime, making pilgrimage through the dormitories\nbefore the prefects came by, “_now_ what have you got to say for\nyourselves? Foster, Carton, Finch, Longbridge, Marlin, Brett! I heard\nyou chaps catchin’ it from King--he made hay of you--an’ all you could\ndo was to wriggle an’ grin an’ say, ‘Yes, sir,’ an’ ‘No, sir,’ an’ ‘Oh\nsir,’ an’ ‘Please, sir’! You an’ your resolution! Urh!”\n\n“Oh, shut up, Stalky.”\n\n“Not a bit of it. You’re a gaudy lot of resolutionists, you are! You’ve\nmade a sweet mess of it. Perhaps you’ll have the decency to leave us\nalone next time.”\n\nHere the house grew angry, and in many voices pointed out how this\nblunder would never have come to pass if Number Five study had helped\nthem from the first.\n\n“But you chaps are so beastly conceited, an’--an’ you swaggered into the\nmeetin’ as if we were a lot of idiots,” growled Orrin of the resolution.\n\n“That’s precisely what you are! That’s what we’ve been tryin’ to hammer\ninto your thick heads all this time,” said Stalky. “Never mind, we’ll\nforgive you. Cheer up. You can’t help bein’ asses, you know,” and, the\nenemy’s flank deftly turned, Stalky hopped into bed.\n\nThat night was the first of sorrow among the jubilant King’s. By some\naccident of under-floor drafts the cat did not vex the dormitory beneath\nwhich she lay, but the next one to the right; stealing on the air rather\nas a pale-blue sensation than as any poignant offense. But the mere\nadumbration of an odor is enough for the sensitive nose and clean tongue\nof youth. Decency demands that we draw several carbolized sheets over\nwhat the dormitory said to Mr. King and what Mr. King replied. He was\ngenuinely proud of his house and fastidious in all that concerned their\nwell-being. He came; he sniffed; he said things. Next morning a boy in\nthat dormitory confided to his bosom friend, a fag of Macrea’s, that\nthere was trouble in their midst which King would fain keep secret.\n\nBut Macrea’s boy had also a bosom friend in Prout’s, a shock-headed\nfag of malignant disposition, who, when he had wormed out the secret,\ntold--told it in a high-pitched treble that rang along the corridor like\na bat’s squeak.\n\n“An’--an’ they’ve been calling us ‘stinkers’ all this week. Why, Harland\nminor says they simply can’t sleep in his dormitory for the stink. Come\non!”\n\n“With one shout and with one cry” Prout’s juniors hurled themselves into\nthe war, and through the interval between first and second lesson some\nfifty twelve-year-olds were embroiled on the gravel outside King’s\nwindows to a tune whose _leit-motif_ was the word “stinker.”\n\n“Hark to the minute-gun at sea!” said Stalky. They were in their study\ncollecting books for second lesson--Latin, with King. “I thought his\nazure brow was a bit cloudy at prayers. ‘She is comin’, sister Mary. She\nis--’”\n\n“If they make such a row now, what will they do when she really begins\nto look up an’ take notice?”\n\n“Well, no vulgar repartee, Beetle. All we want is to keep out of this\nrow like gentlemen.”\n\n“‘Tis but a little faded flower.’ Where’s my Horace? Look here, I don’t\nunderstand what she means by stinkin’ out Rattray’s dormitory first. We\nholed in under White’s, didn’t we?” asked McTurk, with a wrinkled brow.\n\n“Skittish little thing. She’s rompin’ about all over the place, I\nsuppose.”\n\n“My Aunt! King’ll be a cheerful customer at second lesson. I haven’t\nprepared my Horace one little bit, either,” said Beetle. “Come on!”\n\nThey were outside the form-room door now. It was within five minutes of\nthe bell, and King might arrive at any moment.\n\nTurkey elbowed into a cohort of scuffling fags, cut out Thornton tertius\n(he that had been Harland’s bosom friend), and bade him tell his tale.\n\nIt was a simple one, interrupted by tears. Many of King’s house had\nalready battered him for libel.\n\n“Oh, it’s nothing,” McTurk cried. “He says that King’s house stinks.\nThat’s all.”\n\n“Stale!” Stalky shouted. “We knew that years ago, only we didn’t\nchoose to run about shoutin’ ‘stinker.’ We’ve got some manners, ir they\nhaven’t. Catch a fag, Turkey, and make sure of it.”\n\nTurkey’s long arm closed on a hurried and anxious ornament of the Lower\nSecond.\n\n“Oh, McTurk, please let me go. I don’t stink--I swear I don’t!”\n\n“Guilty conscience!” cried Beetle. “Who said you did?”\n\n“What d’you make of it?” Stalky punted the small boy into Beetle’s arms.\n\n“Snf! Snf! He does, though. I think it’s leprosy--or thrush. P’raps it’s\nboth. Take it away.”\n\n“Indeed, Master Beetle”--King generally came to the house-door for a\nminute or two as the bell rang--“we are vastly indebted to you for your\ndiagnosis, which seems to reflect almost as much credit on the natural\nunwholesomeness of your mind as it does upon your pitiful ignorance of\nthe diseases of which you discourse so glibly. We will, however, test\nyour knowledge in other directions.”\n\nThat was a merry lesson, but, in his haste to scarify Beetle, King\nclean neglected to give him an imposition, and since at the same time\nhe supplied him with many priceless adjectives for later use, Beetle was\nwell content, and applied himself most seriously throughout third\nlesson (algebra with little Hartopp) to composing a poem entitled “The\nLazar-house.”\n\nAfter dinner King took his house to bathe in the sea off the\nPebbleridge. It was an old promise; but he wished he could have evaded\nit, for all Prout’s lined up by the Fives Court and cheered with\nintention. In his absence not less than half the school invaded the\ninfected dormitory to draw their own conclusions. The cat had gained in\nthe last twelve hours, but a battlefield of the fifth day could not have\nbeen so flamboyant as the spies reported.\n\n“My word, she _is_ doin’ herself proud,” said Stalky. “Did you ever\nsmell anything like it? Ah, an’ she isn’t under White’s dormitory at all\nyet.”\n\n“But she will be. Give her time,” said Beetle. “She’ll twine like\na giddy honeysuckle. What howlin’ Lazarites they are! No house is\njustified in makin’ itself a stench in the nostrils of decent--”\n\n“High-minded, pure-souled boys. Do you burn with remorse and regret?”\n said McTurk, as they hastened to meet the house coming up from the sea.\nKing had deserted it, so speech was unfettered. Round its front played\na crowd of skirmishers--all houses mixed--flying, reforming, shrieking\ninsults. On its tortured flanks marched the Hoplites, seniors hurling\njests one after another--simple and primitive jests of the Stone Age.\nTo these the three added themselves, dispassionately, with an air of\naloofness, almost sadly.\n\n“And they look all right, too,” said Stalky. “It can’t be Rattray, can\nit? Rattray?”\n\nNo answer.\n\n“Rattray, dear? He seems stuffy about something or other. Look here, old\nman, we don’t bear any malice about your sending that soap to us last\nweek, do we? Be cheerful, Rat. You can live this down all right. I dare\nsay it’s only a few fags. Your house is so beastly slack, though.”\n\n“You aren’t going back to the house, are you?” said McTurk. The victims\ndesired nothing better. “You’ve simply no conception of the reek up\nthere. Of course, frowzin’ as you do, you wouldn’t notice it; but, after\nthis nice wash and the clean, fresh air, even you’d be upset. ‘Much\nbetter camp on the Burrows. We’ll get you some straw. Shall we’?” The\nhouse hurried in to the tune of “John Brown’s body,” sung by loving\nschoolmates, and barricaded themselves in their form-room. Straightway\nStalky chalked a large cross, with “Lord, have mercy upon us,” on the\ndoor, and left King to find it.\n\nThe wind shifted that night and wafted a carrion-reek into Macrea’s\ndormitories; so that boys in nightgowns pounded on the locked door\nbetween the houses, entreating King’s to wash. Number Five study went to\nsecond lesson with not more than half a pound of camphor apiece in their\nclothing; and King, too wary to ask for explanations, gibbered a while\nand hurled them forth. So Beetle finished yet another poem at peace in\nthe study.\n\n“They’re usin’ carbolic now. Malpas told me,” said Stalky. “King thinks\nit’s the drains.”\n\n“She’ll need a lot o’ carbolic,” said McTurk. “No harm tryin’, I\nsuppose. It keeps King out of mischief.”\n\n“I swear I thought he was goin’ to kill me when I sniffed just now. He\ndidn’t mind Burton major sniffin’ at me the other day, though. He never\nstopped Alexander howlin’ ‘Stinker!’ into our form-room before--before\nwe doctored ‘em. He just grinned,” said Stalky. “What was he frothing\nover you for, Beetle?”\n\n“Aha! That, was my subtle jape. I had him on toast. You know he always\njaws about the learned Lipsius.”\n\n“‘Who at the age of four’--that chap?” said McTurk.\n\n“Yes. Whenever he hears I’ve written a poem. Well, just as I was sittin’\ndown, I whispered, ‘How is our learned Lepsius?’ to Burton major. Old\nButt grinned like an owl. _He_ didn’t know what I was drivin’ at; but\nKing jolly well did. That was really why he hove us out. Ain’t you\ngrateful? Now shut up. I’m goin’ to write the ‘Ballad of the Learned\nLipsius.’”\n\n“Keep clear of anything coarse, then,” said Stalky. “I shouldn’t like to\nbe coarse on this happy occasion.”\n\n“Not for wo-orlds. What rhymes to ‘stenches,’ someone?”\n\nIn Common-room at lunch King discoursed acridly to Prout of boys with\nprurient minds, who perverted their few and baleful talents to sap\ndiscipline and corrupt their equals, to deal in foul imagery and destroy\nreverence.\n\n“But you didn’t seem to consider this when your house called\nus--ah--stinkers. If you hadn’t assured me that you never interfere with\nanother man’s house, I should almost believe that it was a few casual\nremarks of yours that started all this nonsense.”\n\nProut had endured much, for King always took his temper to meals.\n\n“You spoke to Beetle yourself, didn’t you? Something about not bathing,\nand being a water-funk?” the school chaplain put in. “I was scoring in\nthe pavilion that day.”\n\n“I may have--jestingly. I really don’t pretend to remember every remark\nI let fall among small boys; and full well I know the Beetle has no\nfeelings to be hurt.”\n\n“May be; but he, or they--it comes to to same thing--have the fiend’s\nown knack of discovering a man’s weak place. I confess I rather go out\nof my way to conciliate Number Five study. It may be soft, but so far,\nI believe, I am the only man here whom they haven’t maddened by\ntheir--well--attentions.”\n\n“That is all beside the point. I flatter myself I can deal with them\nalone as occasion arises. But if they feel themselves morally supported\nby those who should wield an absolute and open-handed justice, then I\nsay that my lot is indeed a hard one. Of all things I detest, I admit\nthat anything verging on disloyalty among ourselves is the first.”\n\nThe Common-room looked at one another out of the corners of their eyes,\nand Prout blushed.\n\n“I deny it absolutely,” he said. “Er--in fact, I own that I personally\nobject to all three of them. It is not fair, therefore, to--”\n\n“How long do you propose to allow it?” said King.\n\n“But surely,” said Macrea, deserting his usual ally, “the blame, if\nthere be any, rests with you, King. You can’t hold them responsible\nfor the--you prefer the good old Anglo-Saxon, I believe--stink in your\nhouse. My boys are complaining of it now.”\n\n“What can you expect? You know what boys are. Naturally they take\nadvantage of what to them is a heaven-sent opportunity,” said little\nHartopp. “What _is_ the trouble in your dormitories, King?”\n\nMr. King explained that as he had made it the one rule of his life never\nto interfere with another man’s house, so he expected not to be too\npatently interfered with. They might be interested to learn--here the\nchaplain heaved a weary sigh--that he had taken all steps that, in his\npoor judgment, would meet the needs of the case. Nay, further, he had\nhimself expended, with no thought of reimbursement, sums, the amount of\nwhich he would not specify, on disinfectants. This he had done because\nhe knew by bitter--by most bitter--experience that the management of the\ncollege was slack, dilatory, and inefficient. He might even add, almost\nas slack as the administration of certain houses which now thought\nfit to sit in judgment on his actions. With a short summary of his\nscholastic career, and a precis of his qualifications, including his\ndegrees, he withdrew, slamming the door.\n\n“Heigho!” said the chaplain. “Ours is a dwarfing life--a belittling\nlife, my brethren. God help all schoolmasters! They need it.”\n\n“I don’t like the boys, I own”--Prout dug viciously with his fork into\nthe table-cloth--“and I don’t pretend to be a strong man, as you know.\nBut I confess I can’t see any reason why I should take steps against\nStalky and the others because King happens to be annoyed by--by--”\n\n“Falling into the pit he has digged,” said little Hartopp. “Certainly\nnot, Prout. No one accuses you of setting one house against another\nthrough sheer idleness.”\n\n“A belittling life--a belittling life.” The chaplain rose. “I go to\ncorrect French exercises. By dinner King will have scored off some\nunlucky child of thirteen; he will repeat to us every word of his\nbrilliant repartees, and all will be well.”\n\n“But about those three. Are they so prurient-minded?”\n\n“Nonsense,” said little Hartopp. “If you thought for a minute, Prout,\nyou would see that the ‘precocious flow of fetid imagery,’ that King\ncomplains of, is borrowed wholesale from King. He ‘nursed the pinion\nthat impelled the steel.’ Naturally he does not approve. Come into the\nsmoking-room for a minute. It isn’t fair to listen to boys; but they\nshould be now rubbing it into King’s house outside. Little things please\nlittle minds.”\n\nThe dingy den off the Common-room was never used for anything except\ngowns. Its windows were ground glass; one could not see out of it, but\none could hear almost every word on the gravel outside. A light and wary\nfootstep came up from Number Five.\n\n“Rattray!” in a subdued voice--Rattray’s study fronted that way. “D’you\nknow if Mr. King’s anywhere about? I’ve got a--” McTurk discreetly left\nthe end of the sentence open.\n\n“No, he’s gone out,” said Rattray unguardedly.\n\n“Ah! The learned Lipsius is airing himself, is he? His Royal Highness\nhas gone to fumigate.” McTurk climbed on the railings, where he held\nforth like the never-wearied rook.\n\n“Now in all the Coll. there was no stink like the stink of King’s house,\nfor it stank vehemently and none knew what to make of it. Save King. And\nhe washed the fags _privatim et seriatim_. In the fishpools of Hesbon\nwashed he them, with an apron about his loins.”\n\n“Shut up, you mad Irishman!” There was the sound of a golf-ball spurting\nup gravel.\n\n“It’s no good getting wrathy, Rattray. We’ve come to jape with you. Come\non, Beetle. They’re all at home. You can wind ‘em.”\n\n“Where’s the Pomposo Stinkadore? ‘Tisn’t safe for a pure-souled,\nhigh-minded boy to be seen round his house these days. Gone out, has he?\nNever mind. I’ll do the best I can, Rattray. I’m _in loco parentis_ just\nnow.”\n\n(“One for you, Prout,” whispered Macrea, for this was Mr. Prout’s pet\nphrase.)\n\n“I have a few words to impart to you, my young friend. We will discourse\ntogether a while.”\n\nHere the listening Prout sputtered: Beetle, in a strained voice, had\nchosen a favorite gambit of King’s.\n\n“I repeat, Master Rattray, we will confer, and the matter of our\ndiscourse shall not be stinks, for that is a loathsome and obscene\nword. We will, with your good leave--granted, I trust, Master Rattray,\ngranted, I trust--study this--this scabrous upheaval of latent\ndemoralization. What impresses me most is not so much the blatant\nindecency with which you swagger abroad under your load of putrescence”\n (you must imagine this discourse punctuated with golf-balls, but old\nRattray was ever a bad shot) “as the cynical immorality with which you\nrevel in your abhorrent aromas. Far be it from me to interfere with\nanother’s house--”\n\n(“Good Lord!” said Prout, “but this is King.”\n\n“Line for line, letter for letter; listen;” said little Hartopp.)\n\n“But to say that you stink, as certain lewd fellows of the baser sort\naver, is to say nothing--less than nothing. In the absence of your\nbeloved house-master, for whom no one has a higher regard than myself,\nI will, if you will allow me, explain the grossness--the unparalleled\nenormity--the appalling fetor of the stenches (I believe in the good old\nAnglo-Saxon word), stenches, sir, with which you have seen fit to infect\nyour house... Oh, bother! I’ve forgotten the rest, but it was very\nbeautiful. Aren’t you grateful to us for laborin’ with you this way,\nRattray? Lots of chaps ‘ud never have taken the trouble, but we’re\ngrateful, Rattray.”\n\n“Yes, we’re horrid grateful,” grunted McTurk. “We don’t forget that\nsoap. We’re polite. Why ain’t you polite, Rat?”\n\n“Hallo!” Stalky cantered up, his cap over one eye. “Exhortin’ the\nWhiffers, eh? I’m afraid they’re too far gone to repent. Rattray!\nWhite! Perowne! Malpas! No answer. This is distressin’. This is truly\ndistressin’. Bring out your dead, you glandered lepers!”\n\n“You think yourself funny, don’t you?” said Rattray, stung from his\ndignity by this last. “It’s only a rat or something under the floor.\nWe’re going to have it up to-morrow.”\n\n“Don’t try to shuffle it off on a poor dumb animal, and dead, too. I\nloathe prevarication. ‘Pon my soul, Rattray--”\n\n“Hold on. The Hartoffles never said ‘Pon my soul’ in all his little\nlife,” said Beetle critically.\n\n(“Ah!” said Prout to little Hartopp.)\n\n“Upon my word, sir, upon my word, sir, I expected better things of you,\nRattray. Why can you not own up to your misdeeds like a man? Have _I_\never shown any lack of confidence in _you_?”\n\n(“It’s not brutality,” murmured little Hartopp, as though answering a\nquestion no one had asked. “It’s boy; only boy.”)\n\n“And this was the house,” Stalky changed from a pecking, fluttering\nvoice to tragic earnestness. “This was the--the--open cesspit that dared\nto call us ‘stinkers.’ And now--and now, it tries to shelter itself\nbehind a dead rat. You annoy me, Rattray. You disgust me! You irritate\nme unspeakably! Thank Heaven, I am a man of equable temper--”\n\n(“This is to your address, Macrea,” said Prout.\n\n“I fear so, I fear so.”)\n\n“Or I should scarcely be able to contain myself before your mocking\nvisage.”\n\n“_Cave_!” in an undertone. Beetle had spied King sailing down the\ncorridor.\n\n“And what may you be doing here, my little friends?” the house-master\nbegan. “I had a fleeting notion--correct me if I am wrong” (the\nlisteners with one accord choked)--“that if I found you outside my house\nI should visit you with dire pains and penalties.”\n\n“We were just goin’ for a walk, sir,” said Beetle.\n\n“And you stopped to speak to Rattray _en route_?”\n\n“Yes, sir. We’ve been throwing golf-balls,” said Rattray, coming out of\nthe study.\n\n(“Old Rat is more of a diplomat than I thought. So far he is strictly\nwithin the truth,” said little Hartopp. “Observe the ethics of it,\nProut.”)\n\n“Oh, you were sporting with them, were you? I must say I do not envy\nyou your choice of associates. I fancied they might have been engaged in\nsome of the prurient discourse with which they have been so disgustingly\nfree of late. I should strongly advise you to direct your steps most\ncarefully in the future. Pick up those golf-balls.” He passed on.\n\n\nNext day Richards, who had been a carpenter in the Navy, and to whom odd\njobs were confided, was ordered to take up a dormitory floor; for Mr.\nKing held that something must have died there.\n\n“We need not neglect all our work for a trumpery incident of this\nnature; though I am quite aware that little things please little\nminds. Yes, I have decreed the boards to be taken up after lunch under\nRichards’s auspices. I have no doubt it will be vastly interesting to\na certain type of so-called intellect; but any boy of my house or\nanother’s found on the dormitory stairs will _ipso facto_ render himself\nliable to three hundred lines.”\n\nThe boys did not collect on the stairs, but most of them waited outside\nKing’s. Richards had been bound to cry the news from the attic window,\nand, if possible, to exhibit the corpse.\n\n“‘Tis a cat, a dead cat!” Richards’s face showed purple at the window.\nHe had been in the chamber of death and on his knees for some time.\n\n“Cat be blowed!” cried McTurk. “It’s a dead fag left over from last\nterm. Three cheers for King’s dead fag!”\n\nThey cheered lustily.\n\n“Show it, show it! Let’s have a squint at it!” yelled the juniors. “Give\nher to the Bug-hunters.” (This was the Natural History Society). “The\ncat looked at the King--and died of it! Hoosh! Yai! Yaow! Maiow! Ftzz!”\n were some of the cries that followed.\n\nAgain Richards appeared.\n\n“She’ve been”--he checked himself suddenly--“dead a long taime.”\n\nThe school roared.\n\n“Well, come on out for a walk,” said Stalky in a well-chosen pause.\n“It’s all very disgustin’, and I do hope the Lazar-house won’t do it\nagain.”\n\n“Do what?” a King’s boy cried furiously.\n\n“Kill a poor innocent cat every time you want to get off washing. It’s\nawfully hard to distinguish between you as it is. I prefer the cat, I\nmust say. She isn’t quite so whiff. What are you goin’ to do, Beetle?”\n\n“_Je vais gloater. Je vais gloater tout le blessed afternoon. Jamais\nj’ai gloate’ comme je gloaterai aujourd’hui. Nous bunkerons aux_\nbunkers.”\n\nAnd it seemed good to them so to do.\n\n\nDown in the basement, where the gas flickers and the boots stand in\nracks, Richards, amid his blacking-brushes, held forth to Oke of the\nCommon-room, Gumbly of the dining-halls, and fair Lena of the laundry.\n\n“Yiss. Her were in a shockin’ staate an’ condition. Her nigh made me\nsick, I tal ‘ee. But I rowted un out, and I rowted un out, an’ I made\nall shipshape, though her smelt like to bilges.”\n\n“Her died mousin’, I reckon, poor thing,” said Lena.\n\n“Then her moused different to any made cat o’ God’s world, Lena. I up\nwith the top-board, an’ she were lying on her back, an’ I turned un\novver with the brume-handle, an’ ‘twas her back was all covered with\nthe plaster from ‘twixt the lathin’. Yiss, I tal ‘ee. An’ under her\nhead there lay, like, so’s to say, a little pillow o’ plaster druv up\nin front of her by raison of her slidin’ along on her back. No cat niver\nwent mousin’ on her back, Lena. Some one had shoved her along right\nunderneath, so far as they could shove un. Cats don’t make theyselves\npillows for to die on. Shoved along, she were, when she was settin’ for\nto be cold, laike.”\n\n“Oh, yeou’m too clever to live, Fatty. Yeou go get wed an’ taught some\nsense,” said Lena, the affianced of Gumbly.\n\n“Larned a little ‘fore iver some maidens was born. Sarved in the Queen’s\nNavy, I have, where yeou’m taught to use your eyes. Yeou go ‘tend your\nown business, Lena.”\n\n“Do ‘ee mean what you’m been tellin’ us?” said Oke.\n\n“Ask me no questions, I’ll give ‘ee no lies. Bullet-hole clane thru from\nside to side, an’ tu heart-ribs broke like withies. I seed un when I\nturned un ovver. They’re clever, oh, they’m clever, but they’m not too\nclever for old Richards! ‘Twas on the born tip o’ my tongue to tell,\ntu, but... he said us niver washed, he did. Let his dom boys call us\n‘stinkers,’ he did. Sarve un dom well raight, I say!”\n\nRichards spat on a fresh boot and fell to his work, chuckling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE IMPRESSIONISTS.\n\n\nThey had dropped into the chaplain’s study for a Saturday night\nsmoke---all four house-masters--and the three briars and the one cigar\nreeking in amity proved the Rev. John Gillett’s good generalship. Since\nthe discovery of the cat, King had been too ready to see affront\nwhere none was meant, and the Reverend John, buffer-state and general\nconfidant, had worked for a week to bring about a good understanding.\nHe was fat, clean-shaven, except for a big mustache, of an imperturbable\ngood temper, and, those who loved him least said, a guileful Jesuit.\nHe smiled benignantly upon his handiwork--four sorely tried men talking\nwithout very much malice.\n\n“Now remember,” he said, when the conversation turned that way, “I\nimpute nothing. But every time that any one has taken direct steps\nagainst Number Five study, the issue has been more or less humiliating\nto the taker.”\n\n“I can’t admit that. I pulverize the egregious Beetle daily for his\nsoul’s good; and the others with him,” said King.\n\n“Well, take your own case, King, and go back a couple of years. Do\nyou remember when Prout and you were on their track for hutting and\ntrespass, wasn’t it? Have you forgotten Colonel Dabney?”\n\nThe others laughed. King did not care to be reminded of his career as a\npoacher.\n\n“That was one instance. Again, when you had rooms below them--I always\nsaid that that was entering the lion’s den--you turned them out.”\n\n“For making disgusting noises. Surely, Gillett, you don’t excuse--”\n\n“All I say is that you turned them out. That same evening your study was\nwrecked.”\n\n“By Rabbits-Eggs--most beastly drunk--from the road,” said King. “What\nhas that?”\n\nThe Reverend John went on.\n\n“Lastly, they conceive that aspersions are cast upon their personal\ncleanliness--a most delicate matter with all boys. Ve-ry good. Observe\nhow, in each case, the punishment fits the crime. A week after your\nhouse calls them ‘stinkers,’ King, your house is, not to put too fine a\npoint on it, stunk out by a dead cat who chooses to die in the one\nspot where she can annoy you most. Again the long arm of coincidence!\n_Summa_. You accuse them of trespass. Through some absurd chain of\ncircumstances--they may or may not be at the other end of it--you and\nProut are made to appear as trespassers. You evict them. For a time your\nstudy is made untenable. I have drawn the parallel in the last case.\nWell?”\n\n“She was under the centre of White’s dormitory,” said King. “There are\ndouble floor-boards there to deaden noise. No boy, even in my own house,\ncould possibly have pried up the boards without leaving some trace--and\nRabbits-Eggs was phenomenally drunk that other night.”\n\n“They are singularly favored by fortune. That is all I ever said.\nPersonally, I like them immensely, and I believe I have a little of\ntheir confidence. I confess I like being called ‘Padre.’ They are at\npeace with me; consequently I am not treated to bogus confessions of\ntheft.”\n\n“You mean Mason’s case?” said Prout heavily. “That always struck me\nas peculiarly scandalous. I thought the Head should have taken up the\nmatter more thoroughly. Mason may be misguided, but at least he is\nthoroughly sincere and means well.”\n\n“I confess I cannot agree with you, Prout,” said the Reverend John. “He\njumped at some silly tale of theft on their part; accepted another boy’s\nevidence without, so far as I can see, any inquiry; and--frankly, I\nthink he deserved all he got.”\n\n“They deliberately outraged Mason’s best feelings,” said Prout. “A word\nto me on their part would have saved the whole thing. But they preferred\nto lure him on; to play on his ignorance of their characters--”\n\n“That may be,” said King, “but I don’t like Mason. I dislike him for the\nvery reason that Prout advances to his credit. He means well.”\n\n“Our criminal tradition is not theft--among ourselves, at least,” said\nlittle Hartopp.\n\n“For the head of a house that raided seven head of cattle from the\ninnocent pot-wallopers of Northam, isn’t that rather a sweeping\nstatement?” said Macrea.\n\n“Precisely so,” said Hartopp, unabashed. “That, with gate-lifting, and a\nlittle poaching and hawk-hunting on the cliffs, is our salvation.”\n\n“It does us far more harm as a school--” Prout began.\n\n“Than any hushed-up scandal could? Quite so. Our reputation among the\nfarmers is most unsavory. But I would much sooner deal with any amount\nof ingenious crime of that nature than--some other offenses.”\n\n“They may be all right, but they are unboylike, abnormal, and, in\nmy opinion, unsound,” Prout insisted. “The moral effect of their\nperformances must pave the way for greater harm. It makes me doubtful\nhow to deal with them. I might separate them.”\n\n“You might, of course; but they have gone up the school together for six\nyears. _I_ shouldn’t care to do it,” said Macrea.\n\n“They use the editorial ‘we,’” said King, irrelevantly. “It annoys me.\n‘Where’s your prose, Corkran?’ ‘Well, sir, we haven’t quite done it\nyet.’ ‘We’ll bring it in a minute,’ and so on. And the same with the\nothers.”\n\n“There’s great virtue in that ‘we,’” said little Hartopp. “You know I\ntake them for trig. McTurk may have some conception of the meaning of\nit; but Beetle is as the brutes that perish about sines and cosines. He\ncopies serenely from Stalky, who positively rejoices in mathematics.”\n\n“Why don’t you stop it?” said Prout.\n\n“It rights itself at the exams. Then Beetle shows up blank sheets, and\ntrusts to his ‘English’ to save him from a fall. I fancy he spends most\nof his time with me in writing verse.”\n\n“I wish to Heaven he would transfer a little of his energy in that\ndirection to Elegiaes.” King jerked himself upright. “He is, with the\nsingle exception of Stalky, the very vilest manufacturer of ‘barbarous\nhexameters’ that I have ever dealt with.”\n\n“The work is combined in that study,” said the chaplain. “Stalky does\nthe mathematics, McTurk the Latin, and Beetle attends to their English\nand French. At least, when he was in the sick-house last month--”\n\n“Malingering,” Prout interjected.\n\n“Quite possibly. I found a very distinct falling off in their ‘Roman\nd’un Jeune Homme Pauvre’ translations.”\n\n“I think it is profoundly immoral,” said Prout. “I’ve always been\nopposed to the study system.”\n\n“It would be hard to find any study where the boys don’t help each\nother; but in Number Five the thing has probably been reduced to a\nsystem,” said little Hartopp. “They have a system in most things.”\n\n“They confess as much,” said the Reverend John. “I’ve seen McTurk being\nhounded up the stairs to elegise the ‘Elegy in a Churchyard,’ while\nBeetle and Stalky went to punt-about.”\n\n“It amounts to systematic cribbing,” said Prout, his voice growing\ndeeper and deeper.\n\n“No such thing,” little Hartopp returned. “You can’t teach a cow the\nviolin.”\n\n“In intention it is cribbing.”\n\n“But we spoke under the seal of the confessional, didn’t we?” said the\nReverend John.\n\n“You say you’ve heard them arranging their work in this way, Gillett,”\n Prout persisted.\n\n“Good Heavens! Don’t make me Queen’s evidence, my dear fellow. Hartopp\nis equally incriminated. If they ever found out that I had sneaked, our\nrelations would suffer--and I value them.”\n\n“I think your attitude in this matter is weak,” said Prout, looking\nround for support. “It would be really better to break up the study--for\na while--wouldn’t it?”\n\n“Oh, break it up by all means,” said Macrea. “We shall see then if\nGillett’s theory holds water.”\n\n“Be wise, Prout. Leave them alone, or calamity will overtake you; and\nwhat is much more important, they will be annoyed with me. I am too fat,\nalas! to be worried by bad boys. Where are you going?”\n\n“Nonsense! They would not dare---but I am going to think this out,” said\nProut. “It needs thought. In intention they cribbed, and I must think\nout my duty.”\n\n“He’s perfectly capable of putting the boys on their honor. It’s _I_\nthat am a fool.” The Reverend John looked round remorsefully. “Never\nagain will I forget that a master is not a man. Mark my words,” said the\nReverend John. “There will be trouble.”\n\n\n   But by the yellow Tiber\n   Was tumult and affright.\n\nOut of the blue sky (they were still rejoicing over the cat war) Mr.\nProut had dropped into Number Five, read them a lecture on the enormity\nof cribbing, and bidden them return to the form-rooms on Monday. They\nhad raged, solo and chorus, all through the peaceful Sabbath, for their\nsin was more or less the daily practice of all the studies.\n\n“What’s the good of cursing?” said Stalky at last. “We’re all in the\nsame boat. We’ve got to go back and consort with the house. A locker\nin the form-room, and a seat at prep. in Number Twelve.” (He looked\nregretfully round the cozy study which McTurk, their leader in matters\nof Art, had decorated with a dado, a stencil, and cretonne hangings.)\n\n“Yes! Heffy lurchin’ into the form-rooms like a frowzy old retriever,\nto see if we aren’t up to something. You know he never leaves his house\nalone, these days,” said McTurk. “Oh, it will be giddy!”\n\n“Why aren’t you down watchin’ cricket? I like a robust, healthy boy. You\nmustn’t frowst in a form-room. Why don’t you take an interest in your\nhouse? Yah!” quoted Beetle.\n\n“Yes, why don’t we? Let’s! We’ll take an interest in the house. We’ll\ntake no end of interest in the house! He hasn’t had us in the form-rooms\nfor a year. We’ve learned a lot since then. Oh, we’ll make it a\nbe-autiful house before we’ve done! ‘Member that chap in ‘Eric’ or ‘St.\nWinifred’s’--Belial somebody? I’m goin’ to be Belial,” said Stalky, with\nan ensnaring grin.\n\n“Right O,” said Beetle, “and I’ll be Mammon. I’ll lend money at\nusury--that’s what they do at all schools accordin’ to the B.O.P. Penny\na week on a shillin’. That’ll startle Heffy’s weak intellect. You can be\nLucifer, Turkey.”\n\n“What have I got to do?” McTurk also smiled.\n\n“Head conspiracies--and cabals--and boycotts. Go in for that ‘stealthy\nintrigue’ that Heffy is always talkin’ about. Come on!”\n\nThe house received them on their fall with the mixture of jest and\nsympathy always extended to boys turned out of their study. The known\naloofness of the three made them more interesting.\n\n“Quite like old times, ain’t it?” Stalky selected a locker and flung in\nhis books. “We’ve come to sport with you, my young friends, for a while,\nbecause our beloved house-master has hove us out of our diggin’s.”\n\n“‘Serve you jolly well right,” said Orrin, “you cribbers!”\n\n“This will never do,” said Stalky. “We can’t maintain our giddy\nprestige, Orrin, de-ah, if you make these remarks.”\n\nThey wrapped themselves lovingly about the boy, thrust him to the opened\nwindow, and drew down the sash to the nape of his neck. With an equal\nswiftness they tied his thumbs together behind his back with a piece of\ntwine, and then, because he kicked furiously, removed his shoes. There\nMr. Prout happened to find him a few minutes later, guillotined and\nhelpless, surrounded by a convulsed crowd who would not assist.\n\nStalky, in an upper form-room, had gathered himself allies against\nvengeance. Orrin presently tore up at the head of a boarding party, and\nthe form-room grew one fog of dust through which boys wrestled, stamped,\nshouted, and yelled. A desk was carried away in the tumult, a knot of\nwarriors reeled into and split a door-panel, a window was broken, and\na gas-jet fell. Under cover of the confusion the three escaped to the\ncorridor, whence they called in and sent up passers-by to the fray.\n\n“Rescue, Kings! Kings! Kings! Number Twelve form-room! Rescue,\nProuts--Prouts! Rescue, Macreas! Rescue, Hartopps!”\n\nThe juniors hurried out like bees aswarm, asking no questions, clattered\nup the staircase, and added themselves to the embroilment.\n\n“Not bad for the first evening’s work,” said Stalky, rearranging his\ncollar. “I fancy Prout’ll be somewhat annoyed. We’d better establish an\nalibi.” So they sat on Mr. King’s railings till prep.\n\n“You see,” quoth Stalky, as they strolled up to prep. with the ignoble\nherd, “if you get the houses well mixed up an’ scufflin’, it’s even\nbettin’ that some ass will start a real row. Hullo, Orrin, you look\nrather metagrobolized.”\n\n“It was all your fault, you beast! You started it. We’ve got two hundred\nlines apiece, and Heffy’s lookin’ for you. Just see what that swine\nMalpas did to my eye!”\n\n“I like your saying we started it. Who called us cribbers? Can’t your\ninfant mind connect cause and effect yet? Some day you’ll find out that\nit don’t pay to jest with Number Five.”\n\n“Where’s that shillin’ you owe me?” said Beetle suddenly.\n\nStalky could not see Prout behind him, but returned the lead without a\nquaver. “I only owed you ninepence, you old usurer.”\n\n“You’ve forgotten the interest,” said McTurk. “A halfpenny a week per\nbob is Beetle’s charge. You must be beastly rich, Beetle.”\n\n“Well, Beetle lent me sixpence.” Stalky came to a full stop and made as\nto work it out on his fingers. “Sixpence on the nineteenth, didn’t he?”\n\n“Yes; but you’ve forgotten you paid no interest on the other bob--the\none I lent you before.”\n\n“But you took my watch as security.” The game was developing itself\nalmost automatically.\n\n“Never mind. Pay me my interest, or I’ll charge you interest on\ninterest. Remember, I’ve got your note-of-hand!” shouted Beetle.\n\n“You are a cold-blooded Jew,” Stalky groaned.\n\n“Hush!” said McTurk very loudly indeed, and started as Prout came upon\nthem.\n\n“I didn’t see you in that disgraceful affair in the form-room just now,”\n said he.\n\n“What, sir? We’re just come up from Mr. King’s,” said Stalky. “Please,\nsir, what am I to do about prep.? They’ve broken the desk you told me to\nsit at, and the form’s just swimming with ink.”\n\n“Find another seat--find another seat. D’you expect me to dry-nurse you?\nI wish to know whether you are in the habit of advancing money to your\nassociates, Beetle?”\n\n“No, sir; not as a general rule, sir.”\n\n“It is a most reprehensible habit. I thought that my house, at least,\nwould be free from it. Even with my opinion of you, I hardly thought it\nwas one of your vices.”\n\n“There’s no harm in lending money, sir, is there?”\n\n“I am not going to bandy words with you on your notions of morality. How\nmuch have you lent Corkran?”\n\n“I--I don’t quite know,” said Beetle. It is difficult to improvise a\ngoing concern on the spur of the minute.\n\n“You seemed certain enough just now.”\n\n“I think it’s two and fourpence,” said McTurk, with a glance of cold\nscorn at Beetle. In the hopelessly involved finances of the study there\nwas just that sum to which both McTurk and Beetle laid claim, as their\nshare in the pledging of Stalky’s second-best Sunday trousers. But\nStalky had maintained for two terms that the money was his “commission”\n for effecting the pawn; and had, of course, spent it on a study “brew.”\n\n“Understand this, then. You are not to continue your operations as a\nmoney-lender. Two and fourpence, you said, Corkran?”\n\nStalky had said nothing, and continued so to do.\n\n“Your influence for evil is quite strong enough without buying a hold\nover your companions.” He felt in his pockets, and (oh joy!) produced\na florin and fourpence. “Bring me what you call Corkran’s note-of-hand,\nand be thankful that I do not carry the matter any further. The money\nis stopped from your pocket-money, Corkran. The receipt to my study, at\nonce!”\n\nLittle they cared! Two and fourpence in a lump is worth six weekly\nsixpences any hungry day of the week.\n\n“But what the dooce is a note-of-hand?” said Beetle. “I only read about\nit in a book.”\n\n“Now you’ve jolly well got to make one,” said Stalky.\n\n“Yes--but our ink don’t turn black till next day. S’pose he’ll spot\nthat?”\n\n“Not him. He’s too worried,” said McTurk. “Sign your name on a bit of\nimpot-paper, Stalky, and write, ‘I O U two and fourpence.’ Aren’t\nyou grateful to me for getting that out of Prout? Stalky’d never have\npaid... Why, you ass!”\n\nMechanically Beetle had handed over the money to Stalky as treasurer of\nthe study. The custom of years is not lightly broken. In return for\nthe document, Prout expounded to Beetle the enormity of money-lending,\nwhich, like everything except compulsory cricket, corrupted houses and\ndestroyed good feeling among boys, made youth cold and calculating,\nand opened the door to all evil. Finally, did Beetle know of any\nother cases? If so, it was his duty as proof of repentance to let his\nhouse-master know. No names need be mentioned.\n\nBeetle did not know--at least, he was not quite sure, sir. How could he\ngive evidence against his friends? The house might, of course--here he\nfeigned an anguished delicacy--be full of it. He was not in a position\nto say. He had not met with any open competition in his trade; but if\nMr. Prout considered it was a matter that affected the honor of\nthe house (Mr. Prout did consider it precisely that), perhaps the\nhouse-prefects would be better...\n\nHe spun it out till half-way through prep.\n\n“And,” said the amateur Shylock, returning to the form-room and dropping\nat Stalky’s side, “if he don’t think the house is putrid with it, I’m\nseveral Dutch-men--that’s all... I’ve been to Mr. Prout’s study, sir.”\n This to the prep.-master. “He said I could sit where I liked, sir... Oh,\nhe is just tricklin’ with emotion... Yes, sir, I’m only askin’ Corkran\nto let me have a dip in his ink.”\n\nAfter prayers, on the road to the dormitories, Harrison and Craye,\nsenior house-prefects, zealous in their office, waylaid them with great\nanger. “What have you been doing to Heffy this time, Beetle? He’s been\njawing us all the evening.”\n\n“What has His Serene Transparency been vexin’ you for?” said McTurk.\n\n“About Beetle lendin’ money to Stalky,” began Harrison; “and then Beetle\nwent and told him that there was any amount of money-lendin’ in the\nhouse.”\n\n“No, you don’t,” said Beetle, sitting on a boot-basket. “That’s just\nwhat I didn’t tell him. I spoke the giddy truth. He asked me if there\nwas much of it in the house; and I said I didn’t know.”\n\n“He thinks you’re a set of filthy Shylocks,” said McTurk. “It’s just as\nwell for you he don’t think you’re burglars. You know he never gets a\nnotion out of his conscientious old head.”\n\n“Well-meanin’ man. Did it all for the best.” Stalky curled gracefully\nround the stair-rail. “Head in a drain-pipe. Full confession in the left\nboot. Bad for the honor of the house--very.”\n\n“Shut up,” said Harrison. “You chaps always behave as if you were jawin’\nus when we come to jaw you.”\n\n“You’re a lot too cheeky,” said Craye.\n\n“I don’t quite see where the cheek comes in, except on your part, in\ninterferin’ with a private matter between me an’ Beetle after it has\nbeen settled by Prout.” Stalky winked cheerfully at the others.\n\n“That’s the worst of clever little swots,” said McTurk, addressing the\ngas. “They get made prefects before they have any tact, and then they\nannoy chaps who could really help ‘em to look after the honor of the\nhouse.”\n\n“We won’t trouble you to do that!” said Craye hotly.\n\n“Then what are you badgerin’ us for?” said Beetle. “On your own showing,\nyou’ve been so beastly slack, looking after the house, that Prout\nbelieves it’s a nest of money-lenders. I’ve told him that I’ve lent\nmoney to Stalky, and no one else. I don’t know whether he believes me,\nbut that finishes my case. The rest is your business.”\n\n“Now we find out,” Stalky’s voice rose, “that there is apparently an\norganized conspiracy throughout the house. For aught we know, the\nfags may be lendin’ and borrowin’ far beyond their means. We aren’t\nresponsible for it. We’re only the rank and file.”\n\n“Are you surprised we don’t wish to associate with the house?” said\nMcTurk, with dignity. “We’ve kept ourselves to ourselves in our study\ntill we were turned out, and now we find ourselves let in for for this\nsort of thing. It’s simply disgraceful.”\n\n“Then you hector and bullyrag us on the stairs,” said Stalky, “about\nmatters that are your business entirely. You know we aren’t prefects.”\n\n“You threatened us with a prefect’s lickin’ just now,” said Beetle,\nboldly inventing as he saw the bewilderment in the faces of the\nenemy. “And if you expect you’ll gain anything from us by your way of\napproachin’ us, you’re jolly well mistaken. That’s all. Good-night.”\n\nThey clattered upstairs, injured virtue on every inch of their backs.\n\n“But--but what the dickens have we done?” said Harrison, amazedly, to\nCraye.\n\n“I don’t know. Only--it always happens that way when one has anything to\ndo with them. They’re so beastly plausible.”\n\nAnd Mr. Prout called the good boys into his study anew, and succeeded\nin sinking both his and their innocent minds ten fathoms deeper in\nblindfolded bedazement. He spoke of steps and measures, of tone and\nloyalty in the house and to the house, and urged them to take up the\nmatter tactfully.\n\nSo they demanded of Beetle whether he had any connection with any other\nestablishment. Beetle promptly went to his house-master, and wished\nto know by what right Harrison and Craye had reopened a matter already\nsettled between him and his house-master. In injured innocence no boy\nexcelled Beetle.\n\nThen it occurred to Prout that he might have been unfair to the culprit,\nwho had not striven to deny or palliate his offense. He sent for\nHarrison and Craye, reprehending them very gently for the tone they had\nadopted to a repentant sinner, and when they returned to their study,\nthey used the language of despair. They then made headlong inquisition\nthrough the house, driving the fags to the edge of hysterics, and\nunearthing, with tremendous pomp and parade, the natural and inevitable\nsystem of small loans that prevails among small boys.\n\n“You see, Harrison, Thornton minor lent me a penny last Saturday,\nbecause I was fined for breaking the window; and I spent it at Keyte’s.\nI didn’t know there was any harm in it. And Wray major borrowed twopence\nfrom me when my uncle sent me a post-office order--I cashed it at\nKeyte’s--for five bob; but he’ll pay me back before the holidays. We\ndidn’t know there was anything wrong in it.”\n\nThey waded through hours of this kind of thing, but found no usury,\nor anything approaching to Beetle’s gorgeous scale of interest. The\nseniors--for the school had no tradition of deference to prefects\noutside compulsory games--told them succinctly to go about their\nbusiness. They would not give evidence on any terms. Harrison was one\nidiot, and Craye was another; but the greatest of all, they said, was\ntheir house-master.\n\nWhen a house is thoroughly upset, however good its conscience, it breaks\ninto knots and coteries--small gatherings in the twilight, box-room\ncommittees, and groups in the corridor. And when from group to group,\nwith an immense affectation of secrecy, three wicked boys steal, crying\n“_Cave’_” when there is no need of caution, and whispering “Don’t tell!”\n on the heels of trumpery confidences that instant invented, a very fine\nair of plot and intrigue can be woven round such a house.\n\nAt the end of a few days, it dawned on Prout that he moved in an\natmosphere of perpetual ambush. Mysteries hedged him on all sides,\nwarnings ran before his heavy feet, and countersigns were muttered\nbehind his attentive back. McTurk and Stalky invented many absurd and\nidle phrases--catch-words that swept through the house as fire through\nstubble. It was a rare jest, and the only practical outcome of the Usury\nCommission, that one boy should say to a friend, with awful gravity,\n“Do you think there’s much of it going on in the house?” The other\nwould reply, “Well, one can’t be too careful, you know.” The effect on\na house-master of humane conscience and good intent may be imagined.\nAgain, a man who has sincerely devoted himself to gaining the esteem of\nhis charges does not like to hear himself described, even at a distance,\nas “Popularity Prout” by a dark and scowling Celt with a fluent tongue.\nA rumor that stories--unusual stories--are told in the form-rooms,\nbetween the lights, by a boy who does not command his confidence,\nagitates such a man; and even elaborate and tender politeness--for the\ncourtesy wise-grown men offer to a bewildered child was the courtesy\nthat Stalky wrapped round Prout--restores not his peace of mind.\n\n“The tone of the house seems changed--changed for the worse,” said Prout\nto Harrison and Craye. “Have you noticed it? I don’t for an instant\nimpute--”\n\nHe never imputed anything; but, on the other hand, he never did anything\nelse, and, with the best intentions in the world, he had reduced the\nhouse-prefects to a state as nearly bordering on nervous irritation\nas healthy boys can know. Worst of all, they began at times to wonder\nwhether Stalky & Co. had not some truth in their often-repeated\nassertions that Prout was a gloomy ass.\n\n“As you know, I am not the kind of man who puts himself out for every\nlittle thing he hears. I believe in letting the house work out their own\nsalvation--with a light guiding hand on the reins, of course. But there\nis a perceptible lack of reverence---a lower tone in matters that touch\nthe honor of the house, a sort of hardness.”\n\n   Oh, Prout he is a nobleman, a nobleman, a nobleman!\n       Our Heffy is a nobleman--\n       He does an awful lot,\n   Because his popularity\n   Oh, pop-u-pop-u-larity--\n   His giddy popularity\n       Would suffer did he not!\n\nThe study door stood ajar; and the song, borne by twenty clear voices,\ncame faint from a form-room. The fags rather liked the tune; the words\nwere Beetle’s.\n\n“That’s a thing no sensible man objects to,” said Prout with a lop-sided\nsmile; “but you know straws show which way the wind blows. Can you trace\nit to any direct influence? I am speaking to you now as heads of the\nhouse.”\n\n“There isn’t the least doubt of it,” said Harrison angrily. “I know\nwhat you mean, sir. It all began when Number Five study came to the\nform-rooms. There’s no use blinkin’ it, Craye. You know that, too.”\n\n“They make things rather difficult for us, sometimes,” said Craye. “It’s\nmore their manner than anything else, that Harrison means.”\n\n“Do they hamper you in the discharge of your duties, then?”\n\n“Well, no, sir. They only look on and grin--and turn up their noses\ngenerally.”\n\n“Ah,” said Prout sympathetically.\n\n“I think, sir,” said Craye, plunging into the business boldly, “it would\nbe a great deal better if they were sent back to their study--better for\nthe house. They are rather old to be knocking about the form-rooms.”\n\n“They are younger than Orrin, or Flint, and a dozen others that I can\nthink of.”\n\n“Yes, sir; but that’s different, somehow. They’re rather influential.\nThey have a knack of upsettin’ things in a quiet way that one can’t take\nhold of. At least, if one does--”\n\n“And you think they would be better in their own study again?”\n\nEmphatically Harrison and Craye were of that opinion. As Harrison said\nto Craye, afterwards, “They’ve weakened our authority. They’re too big\nto lick; they’ve made an exhibition of us over this usury business,\nand we’re a laughing-stock to the rest of the school. I’m going up (for\nSandhurst, understood) next term. They’ve managed to knock me out of\nhalf my work already with their--their lunacy. If they go back to their\nstudy we may have a little peace.”\n\n“Hullo, Harrison.” McTurk ambled round the corner, with a roving eye on\nall possible horizons. “Bearin’ up, old man? That’s right. Live it down!\nLive it down!”\n\n“What d’you mean?”\n\n“You look a little pensive,” said McTurk. “Exhaustin’ job superintendin’\nthe honor of the house, ain’t it? By the way, how are you off for\nmares’-nests?”\n\n“Look here,” said Harrison, hoping for instant reward. “We’ve\nrecommended Prout to let you go back to your study.”\n\n“The dooce you have! And who under the sun are _you_ to interfere\nbetween us and our house-master? Upon my Sam, you two try us very\nhard--you do, indeed. Of course we don’t know how far you abuse your\nposition to prejudice us with Mr. Prout; but when you deliberately\nstop me to tell me you’ve been makin’ arrangements behind our back--in\nsecret--with Prout--I--I don’t know really what we ought to do.”\n\n“That’s beastly unfair!” cried Craye.\n\n“It is.” McTurk had adopted a ghastly solemnity that sat well on his\nlong, lean face. “Hang it all! A prefect’s one thing and an usher’s\nanother; but you seem to combine ‘em. You recommend this--you recommend\nthat! _You_ say how and when we go back to our study!”\n\n“But--but--we thought you’d like it, Turkey. We did, indeed. You know\nyou’ll be ever so much more comfortable there.” Harrison’s voice was\nalmost tearful.\n\nMcTurk turned away as though to hide his emotions.\n\n“They’re broke!” He hunted up Stalky and Beetle in a box-room. “They’re\nsick! They’ve been beggin’ Heffy to let us go back to Number Five. Poor\ndevils! Poor little devils!”\n\n“It’s the olive branch,” was Stalky’s comment. “It’s the giddy white\nflag, by gum! Come to think of it, we _have_ metagrobolized ‘em.”\n\nJust after tea that day, Mr. Prout sent for them to say that if they\nchose to ruin their future by neglecting their work, it was entirely\ntheir own affair. He wished them, however, to understand that their\npresence in the form-rooms could not be tolerated one hour longer.\nHe personally did not care to think of the time he must spend in\neliminating the traces of their evil influences. How far Beetle had\npandered to the baser side of youthful imagination he would ascertain\nlater; and Beetle might be sure that if Mr. Prout came across any\nsoul-corrupting consequences--\n\n“Consequences of what, sir?” said Beetle, genuinely bewildered this\ntime; and McTurk quietly kicked him on the ankle for being “fetched”\n by Prout. Beetle, the house-master continued, knew very well what was\nintended. Evil and brief had been their careers under his eye; and as\none standing _in loco parentis_ to their yet uncontaminated associates,\nhe was bound to take his precautions. The return of the study key closed\nthe sermon.\n\n“But what was the baser-side-of-imagination business?” said Beetle on\nthe stairs.\n\n“I never knew such an ass as you are for justifyin’ yourself,” said\nMcTurk. “I hope I jolly well skinned your ankle. Why do you let yourself\nbe drawn by everybody?”\n\n“Draws be blowed! I must have tickled him up in some way I didn’t know\nabout. If I’d had a notion of that before, of course I could have rubbed\nit in better. It’s too late now. What a pity! ‘Baser side.’ What _was_\nhe drivin’ at?”\n\n“Never mind,” said Stalky. “I knew we could make it a happy little\nhouse. I said so, remember--but I swear I didn’t think we’d do it so\nsoon.”\n\n\n“No,” said Prout most firmly in Common-room. “I maintain that Gillett is\nwrong. True, I let them return to their study.”\n\n“With your known views on cribbing, too?” purred little Hartopp. “What\nan immoral compromise!”\n\n“One moment,” said the Reverend John. “I--we--all of us have exercised\nan absolutely heart-breaking discretion for the last ten days. Now we\nwant to know. Confess--have you known a happy minute since--”\n\n“As regards my house, I have not,” said Prout. “But you are entirely\nwrong in your estimate of those boys. In justice to the others--in\nself-defence--”\n\n“Ha! I said it would come to that,” murmured the Reverend John.\n\n“--I was forced to send them back. Their moral influence was\nunspeakable--simply unspeakable.”\n\nAnd bit by bit he told his tale, beginning with Beetle’s usury, and\nending with the house-prefects’ appeal.\n\n “Beetle in the _ro’le_ of Shylock is new to me,” said King, with\ntwitching lips. “I heard rumors of it--”\n\n“Before?” said Prout.\n\n“No, after you had dealt with them; but I was careful not to inquire. I\nnever interfere with--”\n\n“I myself,” said Hartopp, “would cheerfully give him five shillings\nif he could work out one simple sum in compound interest without three\ngross errors.”\n\n“Why--why--why!” Mason, the mathematical master, stuttered, a fierce joy\non his face, “you’ve been had--precisely the same as me!”\n\n“And so you held an inquiry?” Little Hartopp’s voice drowned Mason’s ere\nProut caught the import of the sentence.\n\n“The boy himself hinted at the existence of a deal of it in the house,”\n said Prout.\n\n“He is past master in that line,” said the chaplain. “But, as regards\nthe honor of the house--”\n\n“They lowered it in a week. I have striven to build it up for years.\nMy own house-prefects--and boys do not willingly complain of each\nother--besought me to get rid of them. You say you have their\nconfidence, Gillett: they may tell you another tale. As far as I am\nconcerned, they may go to the devil in their own way. I’m sick and tired\nof them,” said Prout bitterly.\n\nBut it was the Reverend John, with a smiling countenance, who went to\nthe devil just after Number Five had cleared away a very pleasant little\nbrew (it cost them two and fourpence) and was settling down to prep.\n\n“Come in, Padre, come in,” said Stalky, thrusting forward the best\nchair. “We’ve only met you official-like these last ten days.”\n\n“You were under sentence,” said the Reverend John. “I do not consort\nwith malefactors.”\n\n“Ah, but we’re restored again,” said McTurk. “Mr. Prout has relented.”\n\n“Without a stain on our characters,” said Beetle. “It was a painful\nepisode, Padre, most painful.”\n\n“Now, consider for a while, and perpend, _mes enfants_. It is about\nyour characters that I’ve called to-night. In the language of the\nschools, what the dooce _have_ you been up to in Mr. Prout’s house? It\nisn’t anything to laugh over. He says that you so lowered the tone of\nthe house he had to pack you back to your studies. Is that true?”\n\n“Every word of it, Padre.”\n\n“Don’t be flippant, Turkey. Listen to me. I’ve told you very often that\nno boys in the school have a greater influence for good or evil than\nyou have. You know I don’t talk about ethics and moral codes, because I\ndon’t believe that the young of the human animal realizes what they mean\nfor some years to come. All the same, I don’t want to think you’ve been\nperverting the juniors. Don’t interrupt, Beetle. Listen to me. Mr. Prout\nhas a notion that you have been corrupting your associates somehow or\nother.”\n\n“Mr. Prout has so many notions, Padre,” said Beetle wearily. “Which one\nis this?”\n\n“Well, he tells me that he heard you telling a story in the twilight in\nthe form-room, in a whisper. And Orrin said, just as he opened the door,\n‘Shut up, Beetle; it’s too beastly.’ Now then?”\n\n“You remember Mrs. Oliphant’s ‘Beleaguered City’ that you lent me last\nterm?” said Beetle.\n\nThe Padre nodded.\n\n“I got the notion out of that. Only, instead of a city, I made it the\nColl. in a fog--besieged by ghosts of dead boys, who hauled chaps out of\ntheir beds in the dormitory. All the names are quite real. You tell it\nin a whisper, you know with the names. Orrin didn’t like it one little\nbit. None of ‘em have ever let me finish it. It gets just awful at the\nend part.”\n\n“But why in the world didn’t you explain to Mr. Prout, instead of\nleaving him under the impression--?”\n\n“Padre Sahib,” said McTurk, “it isn’t the least good explainin’ to Mr.\nProut. If he hasn’t one impression, he’s bound to have another.”\n\n“He’d do it with the best o’ motives. He’s _in loco parentis_,” purred\nStalky.\n\n“You young demons!” the Reverend John replied. “And am I to understand\nthat the---the usury business was another of your house-master’s\nimpressions?”\n\n“Well--we helped a little in that,” said Stalky. “I did owe Beetle two\nand fourpence at least, Beetle says I did, but I never intended to pay\nhim. Then we started a bit of an argument on the stairs, and--and Mr.\nProut dropped into it accidental. That was how it was, Padre. He paid me\ncash down like a giddy Dook (stopped it out of my pocket-money just the\nsame), and Beetle gave him my note-of-hand all correct. I don’t know\nwhat happened after that.”\n\n“I was too truthful,” said Beetle. “I always am. You see, he was under\nan impression, Padre, and I suppose I ought to have corrected that\nimpression; but of course I couldn’t be _quite_ certain that his\nhouse wasn’t given over to money-lendin’, could I? I thought the\nhouse-prefects might know more about it than I did. They ought to.\nThey’re giddy palladiums of public schools.”\n\n“They did, too--by the time they’d finished,” said McTurk. “As nice a\npair of conscientious, well-meanin’, upright, pure-souled boys as you’d\never want to meet, Padre. They turned the house upside down--Harrison\nand Craye---with the best motives in the world.”\n\n“They said so. ‘They said it very loud and clear. They went and shouted\nin our ear,’” said Stalky.\n\n“My own private impression is that all three of you will infallibly be\nhanged,” said the Reverend John.\n\n“Why, we didn’t do anything,” McTurk replied. “It was all Mr. Prout. Did\nyou ever read a book about Japanese wrestlers? My uncle---he’s in the\nNavy--gave me a beauty once.”\n\n“Don’t try to change the subject, Turkey.”\n\n“I’m not, sir. I’m givin’ an illustration--same as a sermon. These\nwrestler-chaps have got sort sort of trick that lets the other chap do\nall the work. Than they give a little wriggle, and he upsets himself.\nIt’s called _shibbuwichee_ or _tokonoma_, or somethin’. Mr. Prout’s a\n_shibbuwicher_. It isn’t our fault.”\n\n“Did you suppose we went round corruptin’ the minds of the fags?” said\nBeetle. “They haven’t any, to begin with; and if they had, they’re\ncorrupted long ago. I’ve been a fag, Padre.”\n\n“Well, I fancied I knew the normal range of your iniquities; but if\nyou take so much trouble to pile up circumstantial evidence against\nyourselves, you can’t blame any one if--”\n\n“We don’t blame any one, Padre. We haven’t said a word against Mr.\nProut, have we?” Stalky looked at the others. “We love him. He hasn’t a\nnotion how we love him.”\n\n“H’m! You dissemble your love very well. Have you ever thought who got\nyou turned out of your study in the first place?”\n\n“It was Mr. Prout turned us out,” said Stalky, with significance.\n\n“Well, I was that man. I didn’t mean it; but some words of mine, I’m\nafraid, gave Mr. Prout the impression--”\n\nNumber Five laughed aloud.\n\n“You see it’s just the same thing with you, Padre,” said McTurk. “He\nis quick to get an impression, ain’t he? But you mustn’t think we don’t\nlove him, ‘cause we do. There isn’t an ounce of vice about him.”\n\nA double knock fell on the door.\n\n“The Head to see Number Five study in his study at once,” said the voice\nof Foxy, the school sergeant.\n\n“Whew!” said the Reverend John. “It seems to me that there is a great\ndeal of trouble coming for some people.”\n\n“My word! Mr. Prout’s gone and told the Head,” said Stalky. “He’s a\nmoral double-ender. Not fair, luggin’ the Head into a house-row.”\n\n“I should recommend a copy-book on a--h’m--safe and certain part,” said\nthe Reverend John disinterestedly.\n\n“Huh! He licks across the shoulders, an’ it would slam like a beastly\nbarn-door,” said Beetle. “Good-night, Padre. We’re in for it.”\n\nOnce more they stood in the presence of the Head--Belial, Mammon, and\nLucifer. But they had to deal with a man more subtle than them all. Mr.\nProut had talked to him, heavily and sadly, for half an hour; and the\nHead had seen all that was hidden from the house-master.\n\n“You’ve been bothering Mr. Prout,” he said pensively. “House-masters\naren’t here to be bothered by boys more than is necessary. I don’t like\nbeing bothered by these things. You are bothering _me_. That is a very\nserious offense. You see it?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Well, now, I purpose to bother you, on personal and private grounds,\nbecause you have broken into my time. You are much too big to lick, so\nI suppose I shall have to mark my displeasure in some other way. Say, a\nthousand lines apiece, a week’s gating, and a few things of that kind.\nMuch too big to lick, aren’t you?”\n\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Stalky cheerfully; for a week’s gating in the summer\nterm is serious.\n\n“Ve-ry good. Then we will do what we can. I wish you wouldn’t bother\nme.”\n\nIt was a fair, sustained, equable stroke, with a little draw to it,\nbut what they felt most was his unfairness in stopping to talk between\nexecutions. Thus: “Among the--lower classes this would lay me open to\na charge of--assault. You should be more grateful for your--privileges\nthan you are. There is a limit--one finds it by experience,\nBeetle--beyond which it is never safe to pursue private vendettas,\nbecause--don’t move--sooner or later one comes--into collision with\nthe--higher authority, who has studied the animal. _Et ego_--McTurk,\nplease--_in Arcadia vixi_. There’s a certain flagrant injustice about\nthis that ought to appeal to--your temperament. And that’s all! You will\ntell your house-master that you have been formally caned by me.”\n\n“My word!” said McTurk, wriggling his shoulder-blades all down the\ncorridor. “That was business! The Prooshan Bates has an infernal\nstraight eye.”\n\n“Wasn’t it wily of me to ask for the lickin’,” said Stalky, “instead of\nthose impots?”\n\n“Rot! We were in for it from the first. I knew the look of his old eye,”\n said Beetle. “I was within an inch of blubbing.”\n\n“Well, I didn’t exactly smile,” Stalky confessed.\n\n“Let’s go down to the lavatory and have a look at the damage. One of us\ncan hold the glass and t’others can squint.”\n\nThey proceeded on these lines for some ten minutes. The wales were very\nred and very level. There was not a penny to choose between any of them\nfor thoroughness, efficiency, and a certain clarity of outline that\nstamps the work of the artist.\n\n“What are you doing down there?” Mr. Prout was at the head of the\nlavatory stairs, attracted by the noise of splashing.\n\n“We’ve only been caned by the Head, sir, and we’re washing off the\nblood. The Head said we were to tell you. We were coming to report\nourselves in a minute, sir. (_Sotto voce_.) That’s a score for Heffy!”\n\n“Well, he deserves to score something, poor devil,” said McTurk, putting\non his shirt. “We’ve sweated a stone and a half off him since we began.”\n\n“But look here, why aren’t we wrathy with the Head? He said it was a\nflagrant injustice. So it is!” said Beetle.\n\n“Dear man,” said McTurk, and vouchsafed no further answer.\n\nIt was Stalky who laughed till he had to hold on by the edge of a basin.\n\n“You _are_ a funny ass! What’s that for?” said Beetle.\n\n“I’m--I’m thinking of the flagrant injustice of it!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE MORAL REFORMERS.\n\n\nThere was no disguising the defeat. The victory was to Prout, but they\ngrudged it not. If he had broken the rules of the game by calling in the\nHead, they had had a good run for their money.\n\nThe Reverend John sought the earliest opportunity of talking things\nover. Members of a bachelor Common-room, of a school where masters’\nstudies are designedly dotted among studies and form-rooms, can, if they\nchoose, see a great deal of their charges. Number Five had spent some\ncautious years in testing the Reverend John. He was emphatically a\ngentleman. He knocked at a study door before entering; he comported\nhimself as a visitor and not a strayed lictor; he never prosed, and he\nnever carried over into official life the confidences of idle hours.\nProut was ever an unmitigated nuisance; King came solely as an avenger\nof blood; even little Hartopp, talking natural history, seldom forgot\nhis office; but the Reverend John was a guest desired and beloved by\nNumber Five.\n\nBehold him, then, in their only arm-chair, a bent briar between his\nteeth, chin down in three folds on his clerical collar, and blowing like\nan amiable whale, while Number Five discoursed of life as it appeared to\nthem, and specially of that last interview with the Head--in the matter\nof usury.\n\n“One licking once a week would do you an immense amount of good,”\n he said, twinkling and shaking all over; “and, as you say, you were\nentirely in the right.”\n\n“Ra-ather, Padre! We could have proved it if he’d let us talk,” said\nStalky; “but he didn’t. The Head’s a downy bird.”\n\n“He understands you perfectly. Ho! ho! Well, you worked hard enough for\nit.”\n\n“But he’s awfully fair. He doesn’t lick a chap in the morning an’ preach\nat him in the afternoon,” said Beetle.\n\n“He can’t; he ain’t in Orders, thank goodness,” said McTurk. Number Five\nheld the very strongest views on clerical head-masters, and were ever\nready to meet their pastor in argument.\n\n“Almost all other schools have clerical Heads,” said the Reverend John\ngently.\n\n“It isn’t fair on the chaps,” Stalky replied. “Makes ‘em sulky. Of\ncourse it’s different with you, sir. You belong to the school--same as\nwe do. I mean ordinary clergymen.”\n\n“Well, I am a most ordinary clergyman; and Mr. Hartopp’s in Orders,\ntoo.”\n\n“Ye--es, but he took ‘em after he came to the Coll. We saw him go up for\nhis exam. That’s all right,” said Beetle. “But just think if the Head\nwent and got ordained!”\n\n“What would happen, Beetle?”\n\n“Oh, the Coll. ‘ud go to pieces in a year, sir. There’s no doubt o’\nthat.”\n\n“How d’you know?” The Reverend John was smiling.\n\n“We’ve been here nearly six years now. There are precious few things\nabout the Coll. we don’t know,” Stalky replied. “Why, even you came the\nterm after I did, sir. I remember your asking our names in form your\nfirst lesson. Mr. King, Mr. Prout, and the Head, of course, are the only\nmasters senior to us--in that way.”\n\n“Yes, we’ve changed a good deal--in Common-room.”\n\n“Huh!” said Beetle with a grunt. “They came here, an’ they went away to\nget married. Jolly good riddance, too!”\n\n“Doesn’t our Beetle hold with matrimony?”\n\n“No, Padre; don’t make fun of me. I’ve met chaps in the holidays who’ve\ngot married house-masters. It’s perfectly awful! They have babies and\nteething and measles and all that sort of thing right bung _in_\nthe school; and the masters’ wives give tea-parties--tea-parties,\nPadre!--and ask the chaps to breakfast.”\n\n“That don’t matter so much,” said Stalky. “But the house-masters let\ntheir houses alone, and they leave everything to the prefects. Why, in\none school, a chap told me, there were big baize doors and a passage\nabout a mile long between the house and the master’s house. They could\ndo just what they pleased.”\n\n“Satan rebuking sin with a vengeance.”\n\n“Oh, larks are right enough; but you know what we mean, Padre. After a\nbit it gets worse an’ worse. Then there’s a big bust-up and a row that\ngets into the papers, and a lot of chaps are expelled, you know.”\n\n“Always the wrong un’s; don’t forget that. Have a cup of cocoa, Padre?”\n said McTurk with the kettle.\n\n“No, thanks; I’m smoking. Always the wrong ‘uns? Pro-ceed, my Stalky.”\n\n“And then”--Stalky warmed to the work--“everybody says, ‘Who’d ha’\nthought it? Shockin’ boys! Wicked little kids!’ It all comes of havin’\nmarried house-masters, _I_ think.”\n\n“A Daniel come to judgment.”\n\n“But it does,” McTurk interrupted. “I’ve met chaps in the holidays, an’\nthey’ve told me the same thing. It looks awfully pretty for one’s people\nto see--a nice separate house with a nice lady in charge, an’ all that.\nBut it isn’t. It takes the house-masters off their work, and it gives\nthe prefects a heap too much power, an’--an’--it rots up everything. You\nsee, it isn’t as if we were just an ordinary school. We take crammers’\nrejections as well as good little boys like Stalky. We’ve got to do that\nto make our name, of course, and we get ‘em into Sandhurst somehow or\nother, don’t we?”\n\n“True, O Turk. Like a book thou talkest, Turkey.”\n\n“And so we want rather different masters, don’t you think so, to other\nplaces? We aren’t like the rest of the schools.”\n\n“It leads to all sorts of bullyin’, too, a chap told me,” said Beetle.\n\n“Well, you _do_ need most of a single man’s time, I must say.” The\nReverend John considered his hosts critically. “But do you never feel\nthat the world--the Common-room--is too much with you sometimes?”\n\n“Not exactly--in summer, anyhow.” Stalky’s eye roved contentedly to the\nwindow. “Our bounds are pretty big, too, and they leave us to ourselves\na good deal.”\n\n“For example, here am I sitting in your study, very much in your way,\neh?”\n\n“Indeed you aren’t, Padre. Sit down. Don’t go, sir. You know we’re glad\nwhenever you come.”\n\nThere was no doubting the sincerity of the voices. The Reverend John\nflushed a little with pleasure and refilled his briar.\n\n“And we generally know where the Common-room are,” said Beetle\ntriumphantly. “Didn’t you come through our lower dormitories last night\nafter ten, sir?”\n\n“I went to smoke a pipe with your house-master. No, I didn’t give him\nany impressions. I took a short cut through your dormitories.”\n\n“I sniffed a whiff of ‘baccy, this mornin’. Yours is stronger than Mr.\nProut’s. _I_ knew,” said Beetle, wagging his head.\n\n“Good heavens!” said the Reverend John absently. It was some years\nbefore Beetle perceived that this was rather a tribute to innocence than\nobservation. The long, light, blindless dormitories, devoid of inner\ndoors, were crossed at all hours of the night by masters visiting one\nanother; for bachelors sit up later than married folk. Beetle had never\ndreamed that there might be a purpose in this steady policing.\n\n“Talking about bullying,” the Reverend John resumed, “you all caught it\npretty hot when you were fags, didn’t you?”\n\n“Well, we must have been rather awful little beasts,” said Beetle,\nlooking serenely over the gulf between eleven and sixteen. “My Hat, what\nbullies they were then--Fairburn, ‘Gobby’ Maunsell, and all that gang!”\n\n“‘Member when ‘Gobby’ called us the Three Blind Mice, and we had to get\nup on the lockers and sing while he buzzed ink-pots at us?” said Stalky.\n“They _were_ bullies if you like!”\n\n“But there isn’t any of it now,” said McTurk soothingly.\n\n“That’s where you make a mistake. We’re all inclined to say that\neverything is all right as long we aren’t ourselves hurt. I sometimes\nwonder if it is extinct--bullying.”\n\n“Fags bully each other horrid; but the upper forms are supposed to be\nswottin’ for exams. They’ve got something else to think about,” said\nBeetle.\n\n“Why? What do you think?” Stalky was watching the chaplain’s face.\n\n“I have my doubts.” Then, explosively, “On my word, for three moderately\nintelligent boys you aren’t very observant. I suppose you were too busy\nmaking things warm for your house-master to see what lay under your\nnoses when you were in the form-rooms last week?”\n\n“What, sir? I--I swear we didn’t see anything,” said Beetle.\n\n“Then I’d advise you to look. When a little chap is whimpering in a\ncorner and wears his clothes like rags, and never does any work, and\nis notoriously the dirtiest little ‘corridor-caution’ in the Coll.,\nsomething’s wrong somewhere.”\n\n“That’s Clewer,” said McTurk under his breath.\n\n“Yes, Clewer. He comes to me for his French. It’s his first term, and\nhe’s almost as complete a wreck as you were, Beetle. He’s not naturally\nclever, but he has been hammered till he’s nearly an idiot.”\n\n“Oh, no. They sham silly to get off more tickings,” said Beetle. “_I_\nknow that.”\n\n“I’ve never actually seen him knocked about,” said the Reverend John.\n\n“The genuine article don’t do that in public,” said Beetle. “Fairburn\nnever touched me when any one was looking on.”\n\n“You needn’t swagger about it, Beetle,” said McTurk. “We all caught it\nin our time.”\n\n“But I got it worse than any one,” said Beetle. “If you want an\nauthority on bullyin’, Padre, come to me. Corkscrews--brush-drill\nkeys--head-knucklin’--arm-twistin’--rockin’--Ag Ags--and all the rest\nof it.”\n\n“Yes. I do want you as an authority, or rather I want your authority to\nstop it--all of you.”\n\n“What about Abana and Pharpar, Padre--Harrison and Craye? They are\nMr. Prout’s pets,” said McTurk a little bitterly. “We aren’t even\nsub-prefects.”\n\n“I’ve considered that, but on the other hand, since most bullying is\nmere thoughtlessness--”\n\n“Not one little bit of it, Padre,” said McTurk. “Bullies like bullyin’.\nThey mean it. They think it up in lesson and practise it in the\nquarters.”\n\n“Never mind. If the thing goes up to the prefects it may make another\nhouse-row. You’ve had one already. Don’t laugh. Listen to me. I ask\nyou--my own Tenth Legion--to take the thing up quietly. I want little\nClewer made to look fairly clean and decent--”\n\n“Blowed if _I_ wash him!” whispered Stalky.\n\n“Decent and self-respecting. As for the other boy, whoever he is,\nyou can use your influence”--a purely secular light flickered in the\nchaplain’s eye--“in any way you please to--to dissuade him. That’s all.\nI’ll leave it to you. Good-night, _mes enfants_.”\n\n“Well, what are we goin’ to do?” Number Five stared at each other.\n\n“Young Clewer would give his eyes for a place to be quiet in. _I_ know\nthat,” said Beetle. “If we made him a study-fag, eh?”\n\n“No!” said McTurk firmly. “He’s a dirty little brute, and he’d mess up\neverything. Besides, we ain’t goin’ to have any beastly Erickin’. D’you\nwant to walk about with your arm round his neck?”\n\n“He’d clean out the jam-pots, anyhow; an’ the burnt-porridge\nsaucepan--it’s filthy now.”\n\n“Not good enough,” said Stalky, bringing up both heels with a crash on\nthe table. “If we find the merry jester who’s been bullyin’ him an’ make\nhim happy, that’ll be all right. Why didn’t we spot him when we were in\nthe form-rooms, though?”\n\n“Maybe a lot of fags have made a dead set at Clewer. They do that\nsometimes.”\n\n“Then we’ll have to kick the whole of the lower school in our house--on\nspec. Come on,” said McTurk.\n\n“Keep your hair on! We mustn’t make a fuss about the biznai. Whoever\nit is he’s kept quiet or we’d have seen him,” said Stalky. “We’ll walk\nround and sniff about till we’re sure.”\n\nThey drew the house form-rooms, accounting for every junior and senior\nagainst whom they had suspicions; investigated, at Beetle’s suggestion,\nthe lavatories and box-rooms, but without result. Everybody seemed to be\npresent save Clewer.\n\n“Rum!” said Stalky, pausing outside a study door. “Golly!”\n\nA thin piping mixed with tears came muffled through the panels.\n\n  “‘As beautiful Kitty one morning was tripping--’”\n\n“Louder, you young devil, or I’ll buzz a book at you!”\n\n  “‘With a pitcher of milk--’\n  Oh, Campbell, _please_ don’t!\n  ‘To the fair of--”\n\nA book crashed on something soft, and squeals arose.\n\n“Well, I never thought it was a study-chap, anyhow. That accounts for\nour not spotting him,” said Beetle. “Sefton and Campbell are rather\nhefty chaps to tackle. Besides, one can’t go into their study like a\nform-room.”\n\n“What swine!” McTurk listened. “Where’s the fun of it? I suppose\nClewer’s faggin’ for them.”\n\n“They aren’t prefects. That’s one good job,” said Stalky, with his\nwar-grin. “Sefton and Campbell! Um! Campbell and Sefton! Ah! One of\n‘em’s a crammer’s pup.”\n\nThe two were precocious hairy youths between seventeen and eighteen,\nsent to the school in despair by parents who hoped that six months’\nsteady cram might, perhaps, jockey them into Sandhurst. Nominally they\nwere in Mr. Prout’s house; actually they were under the Head’s eye;\nand since he was very careful never to promote strange new boys to\nprefectships, they considered they had a grievance against the school.\nSefton had spent three months with a London crammer, and the tale of his\nadventures there lost nothing in the telling. Campbell, who had a fine\ntaste in clothes and a fluent vocabulary, followed his lead in looking\ndown loftily on the rest of the world. This was only their second term,\nand the school, used to what it profanely called “crammers’ pups,” had\ntreated them with rather galling reserve. But their whiskers--Sefton\nowned a real razor--and their mustaches were beyond question impressive.\n\n“Shall we go in an’ dissuade ‘em?” McTurk asked. “I’ve never had much to\ndo with ‘em, but I’ll bet my hat Campbell’s a funk.”\n\n“No--o! That’s _oratio directa_,” said Stalky, shaking his head. “I like\n_oratio obliqua_. ‘Sides, where’d our moral influence be then? Think o’\nthat!”\n\n“Rot! What are you goin’ to do?” Beetle turned into Lower Number Nine\nform-room, next door to the study.\n\n“Me?” The lights of war flickered over Stalky’s face. “Oh, I want to\njape with ‘em. Shut up a bit!”\n\nHe drove his hands into his pockets and stared out of window at the sea,\nwhistling between his teeth. Then a foot tapped the floor; one shoulder\nlifted; he wheeled, and began the short quick double-shuffle--the\nwar-dance of Stalky in meditation. Thrice he crossed the empty\nform-room, with compressed lips and expanded nostrils, swaying to the\nquick-step. Then he halted before the dumb Beetle and softly knuckled\nhis head, Beetle bowing to the strokes. McTurk nursed one knee and\nrocked to and fro. They could hear Clewer howling as though his heart\nwould break.\n\n“Beetle is the sacrifice,” Stalky said at last, “I’m sorry for you,\nBeetle. ‘Member Galton’s ‘Art of Travel’ [one of the forms had been\nstudying that pleasant work] an’ the kid whose bleatin’ excited the\ntiger?”\n\n“Oh, curse!” said Beetle uneasily. It was not his first season as a\nsacrifice. “Can’t you get on without me?”\n\n“‘Fraid not, Beetle, dear. You’ve got to be bullied by Turkey an’ me.\nThe more you howl, o’ course, the better it’ll be. Turkey, go an’\ncovet a stump and a box-rope from somewhere. We’ll tie him up for a\nkill--_a’ la_ Galton. ‘Member when ‘Molly’ Fairburn made us cock-fight\nwith our shoes off, an’ tied up our knees?”\n\n“But that hurt like sin.”\n\n“Course it did. What a clever chap you are, Beetle! Turkey’ll knock\nyou all over the place. ‘Member we’ve had a big row all round, an’ I’ve\ntrapped you into doin’ this. Lend us your wipe.” Beetle was trussed for\ncock-fighting; but, in addition to the transverse stump between elbow\nand knee, His knees were bound with a box-rope. In this posture, at a\npush from Stalky he rolled over sideways, covering himself with dust.\n\n“Ruffle his hair, Turkey. Now you get down, too. ‘The bleatin’ of the\nkid excites the tiger.’ You two are in such a sweatin’ wax with me that\nyou only curse. ‘Member that. I’ll tickle you up with a stump. You’ll\nhave to blub, Beetle.”\n\n“Right O! I’ll work up to it in half a shake,” said Beetle.\n\n“Now begin--and remember the bleatin’ o’ the kid.”\n\n“Shut up, you brutes! Let me up! You’ve nearly cut my knees off. Oh, you\n_are_ beastly cads! _Do_ shut up. ‘Tisn’t a joke!” Beetle’s protest was,\nin tone, a work of art.\n\n“Give it to him, Turkey! Kick him! Roll him over! Kill him! Don’t funk,\nBeetle, you brute. Kick him again, Turkey.”\n\n“He’s not blubbin’ really. Roll up, Beetle, or I’ll kick you into the\nfender,” roared McTurk. They made a hideous noise among them, and the\nbait allured their quarry.\n\n“Hullo! What’s the giddy jest?” Sefton and Campbell entered to find\nBeetle on his side, his head against the fender, weeping copiously,\nwhile McTurk prodded him in the back with his toes.\n\n“It’s only Beetle,” Stalky explained. “He’s shammin’ hurt. I can’t get\nTurkey to go for him properly.” Sefton promptly kicked both boys, and\nhis face lighted. “All right, I’ll attend to ‘em. Get up an’ cock-fight,\nyou two. Give me the stump. I’ll tickle ‘em. Here’s a giddy jest! Come\non, Campbell. Let’s cook ‘em.”\n\nThen McTurk turned on Stalky and called him very evil names.\n\n“You said you were goin’ to cock-fight too, Stalky. Come on!”\n\n“More ass you for believin’ me, then!” shrieked Stalky.\n\n“Have you chaps had a row?” said Campbell. “Row?” said Stalky. “Huh! I’m\nonly educatin’ them. D’you know anythin’ about cock-fighting, Seffy?”\n\n“Do I know? Why, at Maclagan’s, where I was crammin’ in town, we used\nto cock-fight in his drawing-room, and little Maclagan daren’t say\nanything. But we were just the same as men there, of course. Do I know?\n_I_‘ll show you.”\n\n“Can’t I get up?” moaned Beetle, as Stalky sat on his shoulder.\n\n“Don’t jaw, you fat piffler. You’re going to fight Seffy.”\n\n“He’ll slay me!”\n\n“Oh, lug ‘em into our study,” said Campbell. “It’s nice an’ quiet in\nthere. I’ll cock-fight Turkey. This is an improvement on young Clewer.”\n\n“Right O! I move it’s shoes-off for them an’ shoes-on for us,” said\nSefton joyously, and the two were flung down on the study floor. Stalky\nrolled them behind an arm-chair. “Now I’ll tie you two up an’ direct the\nbull-fight. Golly, what wrists you have, Seffy. They’re too thick for a\nwipe; got a box-rope?” said he.\n\n“Lots in the corner,” Sefton replied. “Hurry up! Stop blubbin’, you\nbrute, Beetle. We’re goin’ to have a giddy campaign. Losers have to sing\nfor the winners--sing odes in honor of the conqueror. You call yourself\na beastly poet, don’t you, Beetle? I’ll poet you.”\n\nHe wriggled into position by Campbell’s side. Swiftly and scientifically\nthe stumps were thrust through the natural crooks, and the wrists\ntied with well-stretched box-ropes to an accompaniment of insults from\nMcTurk, bound, betrayed, and voluble behind the chair. Stalky set away\nCampbell and Sefton, and strode over to his allies, locking the door on\nthe way.\n\n“And that’s all right,” said he in a changed voice.\n\n“What the devil--?” Sefton began. Beetle’s false tears had ceased;\nMcTurk, smiling, was on his feet. Together they bound the knees and\nankles of the enemy even more straitly.\n\nStalky took the arm-chair and contemplated the scene with his blandest\nsmile. A man trussed for cock-fighting is, perhaps, the most helpless\nthing in the world.\n\n“‘The bleatin’ of the kid excites the tiger.’ Oh, you frabjous asses!”\n He lay back and laughed till he could no more. The victims took in the\nsituation but slowly. “We’ll give you the finest lickin’ you ever had\nin your young lives when we get up!” thundered Sefton from the floor.\n“You’ll laugh the other side of your mouth before you’ve done. What the\ndeuce d’you mean by this?”\n\n“You’ll see in two shakes,” said McTurk. “Don’t swear like that. What we\nwant to know is, why you two hulkin’ swine have been bullyin’ Clewer?”\n\n“It’s none of your business.”\n\n“What did you bully Clewer for?” The question was repeated with\nmaddening iteration by each in turn. They knew their work.\n\n“Because we jolly well chose!” was the answer at last. “Let’s get up.”\n Even then they could not realize the game.\n\n“Well, now we’re goin’ to bully you because we jolly well choose. We’re\ngoin’ to be just as fair to you as you were to Clewer. He couldn’t do\nanything against you. You can’t do anything to us. Odd, ain’t it?”\n\n“Can’t we? You wait an’ see.”\n\n“Ah,” said Beetle reflectively, “that shows you’ve never been properly\njested with. A public lickin’ ain’t in it with a gentle jape. Bet a bob\nyou’ll weep an’ promise anything.”\n\n“Look here, young Beetle, we’ll half kill you when we get up. I’ll\npromise you that, at any rate.”\n\n“You’re going to be half killed first, though. Did you give Clewer\nHead-knuckles?”\n\n“Did you give Clewer Head-knuckles?” McTurk echoed. At the twentieth\nrepetition--no boy can stand the torture of one unvarying query, which\nis the essence of bullying--came confession.\n\n“We did, confound you!”\n\n“Then you’ll be knuckled;” and knuckled they were, according to ancient\nexperience. Head-knuckling is no trifle; “Molly” Fairburn of the old\ndays could not have done better.\n\n“Did you give Clewer Brush-drill?” This time the question was answered\nsooner, and Brush-drill was dealt out for the space of five minutes by\nStalky’s watch. They could not even writhe in their bonds. No brush is\nemployed in Brush-drill.\n\n“Did you give Clewer the Key?”\n\n“No; we didn’t. I swear we didn’t!” from Campbell, rolling in agony.\n\n“Then we’ll give it to you, so you can see what it would be like if you\nhad.”\n\nThe torture of the Key--which has no key at all--hurts excessively. They\nendured several minutes of it, and their language necessitated the gag.\n\n“Did you give Clewer Corkscrews?”\n\n“Yes. Oh, curse your silly souls! Let us alone, you cads.”\n\nThey were corkscrewed, and the torture of the Corkscrew--this has\nnothing to do with corkscrews--is keener than the torture of the Key.\n\nThe method and silence of the attacks was breaking their nerves. Between\neach new torture came the pitiless, dazing rain of questions, and when\nthey did not answer to the point, Isabella-colored handkerchiefs were\nthrust into their mouths.\n\n“Now are those all the things you did to Clewer? Take out the gag,\nTurkey, and let ‘em answer.”\n\n“Yes, I swear that was all. Oh, you’re killing us, Stalky!” cried\nCampbell.\n\n“Pre-cisely what Clewer said to you. I heard him. Now we’re goin’ to\nshow you what real bullyin’ is. ‘What I don’t like about you, Sefton,\nis, you come to the Coll. with your stick-up collars an’ patent-leather\nboots, an’ you think you can teach us something about bullying. Do you\nthink you can teach us anything about bullying? Take out the gag and let\nhim answer.”\n\n“No!”--ferociously.\n\n“He says no. Rock him to sleep. Campbell can watch.”\n\nIt needs three boys and two boxing-gloves to rock a boy to sleep. Again\nthe operation has nothing to do with its name. Sefton was “rocked” till\nhis eyes set in his head and he gasped and crowed for breath, sick and\ndizzy.\n\n“My Aunt!” said Campbell, appalled, from his corner, and turned white.\n\n“Put him away,” said Stalky. “Bring on Campbell. Now this _is_ bullyin’.\nOh, I forgot! I say, Campbell, what did you bully Clewer for? Take out\nhis gag and let him answer.”\n\n“I--I don’t know. Oh, let me off! I swear I’ll make it _pax_. Don’t\n‘rock’ me!”\n\n“‘The bleatin’ of the kid excites the tiger.’ He says he don’t know. Set\nhim up, Beetle. Give me the glove an’ put in the gag.”\n\nIn silence Campbell was “rocked” sixty-four times.\n\n“I believe I’m goin’ to die!” he gasped. “He says he is goin’ to die.\nPut him away. Now, Sefton! Oh, I forgot! Sefton, what did you bully\nClewer for?”\n\nThe answer is unprintable; but it brought not the faintest flush to\nStalky’s downy cheek.\n\n“Make him an Ag Ag, Turkey!”\n\nAnd an Ag Ag was he made, forthwith. The hard-bought experience of\nnearly eighteen years was at his disposal, but he did not seem to\nappreciate it.\n\n“He says we are sweeps. Put him away! Now, Campbell! Oh, I forgot! I\nsay, Campbell, what did you bully Clewer for?”\n\nThen came the tears--scalding tears; appeals for mercy and abject\npromises of peace. Let them cease the tortures and Campbell would never\nlift hand against them. The questions began again--to an accompaniment\nof small persuasions.\n\n“You seem hurt, Campbell. Are you hurt?”\n\n“Yes. Awfully!”\n\n“He says he is hurt. Are you broke?”\n\n“Yes, yes! I swear I am. Oh, stop!”\n\n“He says he is broke. Are you humble?”\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“He says he is humble. Are you devilish humble?”\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“He says he is devilish humble. Will you bully Clewer any more?”\n\n“No. No--ooh!”\n\n“He says he won’t bully Clewer. Or any one else?”\n\n“No. I swear I won’t.”\n\n“Or any one else. What about that lickin’ you and Sefton were goin’ to\ngive us?”\n\n“I won’t! I won’t! I swear I won’t!”\n\n“He says he won’t lick us. Do you esteem yourself to know anything about\nbullyin’?”\n\n“No, I don’t!”\n\n“He says he doesn’t know anything about bullyin’. Haven’t we taught you\na lot?”\n\n“Yes--yes!”\n\n“He says we’ve taught him a lot. Aren’t you grateful?”\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“He says he is grateful. Put him away. Oh, I forgot! I say, Campbell,\nwhat did you bully Clewer for?”\n\nHe wept anew; his nerves being raw. “Because I was a bully. I suppose\nthat’s what you want me to say?”\n\n“He says he is a bully. Right he is. Put him in the corner. No more\njapes for Campbell. Now, Sefton!”\n\n“You devils! You young devils!” This and much more as Sefton was punted\nacross the carpet by skilful knees.\n\n“‘The bleatin’ of the kid excites the tiger.’ We’re goin’ to make you\nbeautiful. Where does he keep his shaving things? [Campbell told.]\nBeetle, get some water. Turkey, make the lather. We’re goin’ to shave\nyou, Seffy, so you’d better lie jolly still, or you’ll get cut. I’ve\nnever shaved any one before.”\n\n“Don’t! Oh, don’t! Please don’t!”\n\n“Gettin’ polite, eh? I’m only goin’ to take off one ducky little\nwhisker--”\n\n“I’ll--I’ll make it _pax_, if you don’t. I swear I’ll let you off your\nlickin’ when I get up!”\n\n“_And_ half that mustache we’re so proud of. He says he’ll let us off\nour lickin’. Isn’t he kind?”\n\nMcTurk laughed into the nickel-plated shaving-cup, and settled Sefton’s\nhead between Stalky’s vise-like knees.\n\n“Hold on a shake,” said Beetle, “you can’t shave long hairs. You’ve got\nto cut all that mustache short first, an’ then scrape him.”\n\n“Well, I’m not goin’ to hunt about for scissors. Won’t a match do? Chuck\nus the match-box. He _is_ a hog, you know; we might as well singe him.\nLie still!” He lit a vesta, but checked his hand. “I only want to take\noff half, though.”\n\n“That’s all right.” Beetle waved the brush. “I’ll lather up to the\nmiddle--see? and you can burn off the rest.”\n\nThe thin-haired first mustache of youth fluffed off in flame to the\nlather-line in the centre of the lip, and Stalky rubbed away the\nburnt stumpage with his thumb. It was not a very gentle shave, but it\nabundantly accomplished its purpose.\n\n“Now the whisker on the other side. Turn him over!” Between match and\nrazor this, too, was removed. “Give him his shaving-glass. Take the gag\nout. I want to hear what he’ll say.”\n\nBut there were no words. Sefton gazed at the lop-sided wreck in horror\nand despair. Two fat tears rolled down his cheek.\n\n“Oh, I forgot! I say, Sefton, what did you bully Clewer for?”\n\n“Leave me alone! Oh, you infernal bullies, leave me alone! Haven’t I had\nenough?”\n\n“He says we must leave him alone,” said McTurk.\n\n“He says we are bullies, an’ we haven’t even begun yet,” said Beetle.\n“You’re ungrateful, Seffy. Golly! You do look an atrocity and a half!”\n\n“He says he has had enough,” said Stalky. “He errs!”\n\n“Well, to work, to work!” chanted McTurk, waving a stump. “Come on, my\ngiddy Narcissus. Don’t fall in love with your own reflection!”\n\n“Oh, let him off,” said Campbell from his corner; “he’s blubbing, too.”\n\nSefton cried like a twelve-year-old with pain, shame, wounded vanity,\nand utter helplessness.\n\n“You’ll make it _pax_, Sefton, won’t you? You can’t stand up to those\nyoung devils--”\n\n“Don’t be rude, Campbell, de-ah,” said McTurk, “or you’ll catch it\nagain!”\n\n“You _are_ devils, you know,” said Campbell.\n\n“What? for a little bullyin’--same as you’ve been givin’ Clewer! How\nlong have you been jestin’ with him?” said Stalky. “All this term?”\n\n“We didn’t always knock him about, though!”\n\n“You did when you could catch him,” said Beetle, cross-legged on the\nfloor, dropping a stump from time to time across Sefton’s instep. “Don’t\nI know it!”\n\n“I--perhaps we did.”\n\n“And you went out of your way to catch him? Don’t I know it! Because he\nwas an awful little beast, eh? Don’t I know it! Now, you see, _you_‘re\nawful beasts, and you’re gettin’ what he got--for bein’ a beast. Just\nbecause we choose.”\n\n“We never really bullied him--like you’ve done us.”\n\n“Yah!” said Beetle. “They never really bully--‘Molly’ Fairburn didn’t.\nOnly knock ‘em about a little bit. That’s what they say. Only kick their\nsouls out of ‘em, and they go and blub in the box-rooms. Shove their\nheads into the ulsters an’ blub. Write home three times a day--yes,\nyou brute, I’ve done that--askin’ to be taken away. You’ve never been\nbullied properly, Campbell I’m sorry you made _pax_.”\n\n“I’m not!” said Campbell, who was a humorist in a way. “Look out, you’re\nslaying Sefton!”\n\nIn his excitement Beetle had used the stump unreflectingly, and Sefton\nwas now shouting for mercy.\n\n“An’ you!” he cried, wheeling where he sat. “You’ve never been bullied,\neither. Where were you before you came here?”\n\n“I--I had a tutor.”\n\n“Yah! You would. You never blubbed in your life. But you’re blubbin’\nnow, by gum. Aren’t you blubbin’?”\n\n“Can’t you see, you blind beast?” Sefton fell over sideways, tear-tracks\nfurrowing the dried lather. Crack came the cricket-stump on the curved\nlatter-end of him.\n\n“Blind, am I,” said Beetle, “and a beast? Shut up, Stalky. I’m goin’ to\njape a bit with our friend, _a’ la_ ‘Molly’ Fairburn. _I_ think I can\nsee. Can’t I see, Sefton?”\n\n“The point is well taken,” said McTurk, watching the strap at work.\n“You’d better say that he sees, Seffy.”\n\n“You do--you can! I swear you do!” yelled Sefton, for strong arguments\nwere coercing him.\n\n“Aren’t my eyes lovely?” The stump rose and fell steadily throughout\nthis catechism.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“A gentle hazel, aren’t they?”\n\n“Yes--oh, yes!”\n\n“What a liar you are! They’re sky-blue. Ain’t they sky-blue?”\n\n“Yes--oh, yes!”\n\n“You don’t know your mind from one minute to another. You must\nlearn--you must learn.”\n\n“What a bait you’re in!” said Stalky. “Keep your hair on, Beetle.”\n\n“I’ve had it done to me,” said Beetle. “Now--about my being a beast.”\n\n“_Pax_--oh, _pax_!” cried Sefton; “make it _pax_. I’ll give up! Let me\noff! I’m broke! I can’t stand it!”\n\n“Ugh! Just when we were gettin’ our hand in!” grunted McTurk.\n\n“They didn’t let Clewer off, I’ll swear.”\n\n“Confess--apologize--quick!” said Stalky.\n\nFrom the floor Sefton made unconditional surrender, more abjectly even\nthan Campbell. He would never touch any one again. He would go softly all\nthe days of his life.\n\n“We’ve got to take it, I suppose?” said Stalky. “All right, Sefton.\nYou’re broke? Very good. Shut up, Beetle! But before we let you up, you\nan’ Campbell will kindly oblige us with ‘Kitty of Coleraine’--_a’ la_\nClewer.”\n\n“That’s not fair,” said Campbell; “we’ve surrendered.”\n\n“‘Course you have. Now you’re goin’ to do what we tell you--same as\nClewer would. If you hadn’t surrendered you’d ha’ been really bullied.\nHavin’ surrendered--do you follow, Seffy?--you sing odes in honor of the\nconquerors. Hurry up!”\n\nThey dropped into chairs luxuriously. Campbell and Sefton looked at each\nother, and, neither taking comfort from that view, struck up “Kitty of\nColeraine.”\n\n“Vile bad,” said Stalky, as the miserable wailing ended. “If you hadn’t\nsurrendered it would have been our painful duty to buzz books at you for\nsingin’ out o’ tune. Now then.”\n\nHe freed them from their bonds, but for several minutes they could not\nrise. Campbell was first on his feet, smiling uneasily. Sefton staggered\nto the table, buried his head in his arms, and shook with sobs. There\nwas no shadow of fight in either--only amazement, distress, and shame.\n\n“Ca--can’t he shave clean before tea, please?” said Campbell. “It’s ten\nminutes to bell.”\n\nStalky shook his head. He meant to escort the half-shaved one to the\nmeal.\n\nMcTurk yawned in his chair and Beetle mopped his face. They were all\ndripping with excitement and exertion.\n\n“If I knew anything about it, I swear I’d give you a moral lecture,”\n said Stalky severely.\n\n“Don’t jaw; they’ve surrendered,” said McTurk. “This moral suasion\nbiznai takes it out of a chap.”\n\n“Don’t you see how gentle we’ve been? We might have called Clewer in to\nlook at you,” said Stalky. “‘The bleatin’ of the tiger excites the kid.’\nBut we didn’t. We’ve only got to tell a few chaps in Coll. about this\nand you’d be hooted all over the shop. Your life wouldn’t be worth\nhavin’. But we aren’t goin’ to do that, either. We’re strictly moral\nsuasers, Campbell; so, unless you or Seffy split about this, no one\nwill.”\n\n“I swear you’re a brick,” said Campbell. “I suppose I was rather a brute\nto Clewer.”\n\n“It looked like it,” said Stalky. “But I don’t think Seffy need come\ninto hall with cock-eye whiskers. Horrid bad for the fags if they saw\nhim. He can shave. Ain’t you grateful, Sefton?”\n\nThe head did not lift. Sefton was deeply asleep.\n\n“That’s rummy,” said McTurk, as a snore mixed with a sob. “‘Cheek, _I_\nthink; or else he’s shammin’.”\n\n“No, ‘tisn’t,” said Beetle. “‘When ‘Molly’ Fairburn had attended to me\nfor an hour or so I used to go bung off to sleep on a form sometimes.\nPoor devil! But he called me a beastly poet, though.”\n\n“Well, come on.” Stalky lowered his voice. “Good-by, Campbell. ‘Member,\nif you don’t talk, nobody will.”\n\nThere should have been a war-dance, but that all three were so utterly\ntired that they almost went to sleep above the tea-cups in their study,\nand slept till prep.\n\n\n“A most extraordinary letter. Are all parents incurably mad? What do you\nmake of it?” said the Head, handing a closely written eight pages to the\nReverend John.\n\n“‘The only son of his mother, and she a widow.’ That is the least\nreasonable sort.” The chaplain read with pursed lips. “If half\nthose charges are true he should be in the sick-house; whereas he is\ndisgustingly well. Certainly he has shaved. I noticed that.”\n\n“Under compulsion, as his mother points out. How delicious! How\nsalutary!”\n\n“You haven’t to answer her. It isn’t often I don’t know what has\nhappened in the school; but this is beyond me.”\n\n“If you asked me I should say seek not to propitiate. When one is forced\nto take crammers’ pups--”\n\n“He was perfectly well at extra-tuition--with me--this morning,” said\nthe Head, absently. “Unusually well behaved, too.”\n\n“--they either educate the school, or the school, as in this case,\neducates them. I prefer our own methods,” the chaplain concluded.\n\n“You think it was that?” A lift of the Head’s eye-brow.\n\n“I’m sure of it! And nothing excuses his trying to give the College a\nbad name.”\n\n“That’s the line I mean to take with him,” the Head answered.\n\nThe Augurs winked.\n\n\nA few days later the Reverend John called on Number Five. “Why haven’t\nwe seen you before, Padre?” said they.\n\n“I’ve been watching times and seasons and events and men--and boys,” he\nreplied. “I am pleased with my Tenth Legion. I make them my compliments.\nClewer was throwing ink-balls in form this morning, instead of doing his\nwork. He is now doing fifty lines for--unheard-of audacity.”\n\n“You can’t blame us, sir,” said Beetle. “You told us to remove\nthe--er--pressure. That’s the worst of a fag.”\n\n“I’ve known boys five years his senior throw ink-balls, Beetle. To such\nan one have I given two hundred lines--not so long ago. And now I come\nto think of it, were those lines ever shown up?”\n\n“Were they, Turkey?’ said Beetle unblushingly.\n\n“Don’t you think Clewer looks a little cleaner, Padre?” Stalky\ninterrupted.\n\n“We’re no end of moral reformers,” said McTurk.\n\n“It was all Stalky, but it was a lark,” said Beetle.\n\n“I have noticed the moral reform in several quarters. Didn’t I tell you\nyou had more influence than any boys in the Coll. if you cared to use\nit?”\n\n“It’s a trifle exhaustin’ to use frequent--our kind of moral suasion.\nBesides, you see, it only makes Clewer cheeky.”\n\n“I wasn’t thinking of Clewer; I was thinking of--the other people,\nStalky.”\n\n“Oh, we didn’t bother much about the other people,” said McTurk. “Did\nwe?”\n\n“But _I_ did--from the beginning.”\n\n“Then you knew, sir?”\n\nA downward puff of smoke. “Boys educate each other, they say, more than\nwe can or dare. If I had used one half of the moral suasion you may or\nmay not have employed--”\n\n“With the best motives in the world. Don’t forget our pious motives,\nPadre,” said McTurk.\n\n“I suppose I should be now languishing in Bideford jail, shouldn’t I?\nWell, to quote the Head, in a little business which we have agreed to\nforget, that strikes me as flagrant injustice... What are you laughing\nat, you young sinners? Isn’t it true? I will not stay to be shouted at.\nWhat I looked into this den of iniquity for was to find out if any one\ncared to come down for a bathe off the Ridge. But I see you won’t.”\n\n“Won’t we, though! Half a shake, Padre Sahib, till we get our towels,\nand _nous sommes avec vous_!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. A LITTLE PREP.\n\n\nEaster term was but a month old when Stettson major, a day-boy,\ncontracted diphtheria, and the Head was very angry. He decreed a new and\nnarrower set of bounds--the infection had been traced to an out-lying\nfarmhouse--urged the prefects severely to lick all trespassers, and\npromised extra attentions from his own hand. There were no words bad\nenough for Stettson major, quarantined at his mother’s house, who had\nlowered the school-average of health. This he said in the gymnasium\nafter prayers. Then he wrote some two hundred letters to as many anxious\nparents and guardians, and bade the school carry on. The trouble did not\nspread, but, one night, a dog-cart drove to the Head’s door, and in the\nmorning the Head had gone, leaving all things in charge of Mr. King,\nsenior house-master. The Head often ran up to town, where the school\ndevoutly believed he bribed officials for early proofs of the Army\nExamination papers; but this absence was unusually prolonged.\n\n“Downy old bird!” said Stalky to the allies one wet afternoon in the\nstudy. “He must have gone on a bend and been locked up under a false\nname.”\n\n“What for?” Beetle entered joyously into the libel.\n\n“Forty shillin’s or a month for hackin’ the chucker-out of the Pavvy on\nthe shins. Bates always has a spree when he goes to town. Wish he\nwas back, though. I’m about sick o’ King’s ‘whips an’ scorpions’ an’\nlectures on public-school spirit--yah!--and scholarship!”\n\n“‘Crass an’ materialized brutality of the middle-classes--readin’ solely\nfor marks. Not a scholar in the whole school,’” McTurk quoted, pensively\nboring holes in the mantel-piece with a hot poker.\n\n“That’s rather a sickly way of spending an afternoon. Stinks too.\nLet’s come out an’ smoke. Here’s a treat.” Stalky held up a long Indian\ncheroot. “‘Bagged it from my pater last holidays. I’m a bit shy of it\nthough; it’s heftier than a pipe. We’ll smoke it palaver-fashion. Hand\nit round, eh? Let’s lie up behind the old harrow on the Monkey-farm\nRoad.”\n\n“Out of bounds. Bounds beastly strict these days, too. Besides, we shall\ncat.” Beetle sniffed the cheroot critically. “It’s a regular Pomposo\nStinkadore.”\n\n“You can; I shan’t. What d’you say, Turkey?”\n\n“Oh, may’s well, I s’pose.”\n\n“Chuck on your cap, then. It’s two to one. Beetle, out you come!”\n\nThey saw a group of boys by the notice-board in the corridor; little\nFoxy, the school sergeant, among them.\n\n“More bounds, I expect,” said Stalky. “Hullo, Foxibus, who are you in\nmournin’ for?” There was a broad band of crape round Foxy’s arm.\n\n“He was in my old regiment,” said Foxy, jerking his head towards the\nnotices, where a newspaper cutting was thumb-tacked between call-over\nlists.\n\n“By gum!” quoth Stalky, uncovering as he read. “It’s old\nDuncan--Fat-Sow Duncan--killed on duty at something or other Kotal.\n‘_Rallyin’ his men with conspicuous gallantry._’ He would, of course.\n‘_The body was recovered_.’ That’s all right. They cut ‘em up sometimes,\ndon’t they, Foxy?”\n\n“Horrid,” said the sergeant briefly.\n\n“Poor old Fat-Sow! I was a fag when he left. How many does that make to\nus, Foxy?”\n\n“Mr. Duncan, he is the ninth. He come here when he was no bigger\nthan little Grey tertius. My old regiment, too. Yiss, nine to us, Mr.\nCorkran, up to date.”\n\nThe boys went out into the wet, walking swiftly.\n\n“Wonder how it feels--to be shot and all that,” said Stalky, as they\nsplashed down a lane. “Where did it happen, Beetle?”\n\n“Oh, out in India somewhere. We’re always rowin’ there. But look here,\nStalky, what _is_ the good o’ sittin’ under a hedge an’ cattin’? It’s\nbe-eastly cold. It’s be-eastly wet, and we’ll be collared as sure as a\ngun.”\n\n“Shut up! Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky get you into a mess yet?”\n Like many other leaders, Stalky did not dwell on past defeats. They\npushed through a dripping hedge, landed among water-logged clods, and\nsat down on a rust-coated harrow. The cheroot burned with sputterings\nof saltpetre. They smoked it gingerly, each passing to the other between\nclosed forefinger and thumb.\n\n“Good job we hadn’t one apiece, ain’t it?” said Stalky, shivering\nthrough set teeth. To prove his words he immediately laid all before\nthem, and they followed his example...\n\n“I told you,” moaned Beetle, sweating clammy drops. “Oh, Stalky, you are\na fool!”\n\n“_Je cat_, _tu cat_, _il cat_. _Nous cattons_!” McTurk handed up his\ncontribution and lay hopelessly on the cold iron.\n\n“Something’s wrong with the beastly thing. I say, Beetle, have you been\ndroppin’ ink on it?”\n\nBut Beetle was in no case to answer. Limp and empty, they sprawled\nacross the harrow, the rust marking their ulsters in red squares and the\nabandoned cheroot-end reeking under their very cold noses. Then--they\nhad heard nothing--the Head himself stood before them--the Head who\nshould have been in town bribing examiners--the Head fantastically\nattired in old tweeds and a deer-stalker!\n\n“Ah,” he said, fingering his mustache. “Very good. I might have guessed\nwho it was. You will go back to the College and give my compliments to\nMr. King and ask him to give you an extra-special licking. You will then\ndo me five hundred lines. I shall be back to-morrow. Five hundred lines\nby five o’clock to-morrow. You are also gated for a week. This is not\nexactly the time for breaking bounds. Extra-special, please.”\n\nHe disappeared over the hedge as lightly as he had come. There was a\nmurmur of women’s voices in the deep lane.\n\n“Oh, you Prooshan brute!” said McTurk as the voices died away. “Stalky,\nit’s all your silly fault.”\n\n“Kill him! Kill him!” gasped Beetle.\n\n“I ca-an’t. I’m going to cat again... I don’t mind that, but King’ll\ngloat over us horrid. Extra-special, ooh!”\n\nStalky made no answer--not even a soft one. They went to College and\nreceived that for which they had been sent. King enjoyed himself most\nthoroughly, for by virtue of their seniority the boys were exempt from\nhis hand, save under special order. Luckily, he was no expert in the\ngentle art.\n\n“‘Strange, how desire doth outrun performance,’” said Beetle\nirreverently, quoting from some Shakespeare play that they were cramming\nthat term. They regained their study and settled down to the imposition.\n\n“You’re quite right, Beetle.” Stalky spoke in silky and propitiating\ntones. “Now, if the Head had sent us up to a prefect, we’d have got\nsomething to remember!”\n\n“Look here,” McTurk began with cold venom, “we aren’t goin’ to row you\nabout this business, because it’s too bad for a row; but we want you\nto understand you’re jolly well excommunicated, Stalky. You’re a plain\nass.”\n\n“How was I to know that the Head ‘ud collar us? What was he doin’ in\nthose ghastly clothes, too?”\n\n“Don’t try to raise a side-issue,” Beetle grunted severely.\n\n“Well, it was all Stettson major’s fault. If he hadn’t gone an’ got\ndiphtheria ‘twouldn’t have happened. But don’t you think it rather\nrummy--the Head droppin’ on us that way?”\n\n“Shut up! You’re dead!” said Beetle. “We’ve chopped your spurs off your\nbeastly heels. We’ve cocked your shield upside down and---and I don’t\nthink you ought to be allowed to brew for a month.”\n\n“Oh, stop jawin’ at me. I want--”\n\n“Stop? Why--why, we’re gated for a week.” McTurk almost howled as the\nagony of the situation overcame him. “A lickin’ from King, five hundred\nlines, _and_ a gatin’. D’you expect us to kiss you, Stalky, you beast?”\n\n“Drop rottin’ for a minute. I want to find out about the Head bein’\nwhere he was.”\n\n“Well, you have. You found him quite well and fit. Found him makin’ love\nto Stettson major’s mother. That was her in the lane--I heard her. And\nso we were ordered a lickin’ before a day-boy’s mother. Bony old widow,\ntoo,” said McTurk. “Anything else you’d like to find out?”\n\n“I don’t care. I swear I’ll get even with him some day,” Stalky growled.\n\n“Looks like it,” said McTurk. “Extra-special, week’s gatin’ and five\nhundred... and now you’re goin’ to row about it! Help scrag him,\nBeetle!” Stalky had thrown his Virgil at them.\n\nThe Head returned next day without explanation, to find the lines\nwaiting for him and the school a little relaxed under Mr. King’s\nviceroyalty. Mr. King had been talking at and round and over the boys’\nheads, in a lofty and promiscuous style, of public-school spirit and the\ntraditions of ancient seats; for he always improved an occasion. Beyond\nwaking in two hundred and fifty young hearts a lively hatred of all\nother foundations, he accomplished little--so little, indeed, that when,\ntwo days after the Head’s return, he chanced to come across Stalky &\nCo., gated but ever resourceful, playing marbles in the corridor, he\nsaid that he was not surprised--not in the least surprised. This was\nwhat he had expected from persons of their _morale_.\n\n“But there isn’t any rule against marbles, sir. Very interestin’ game,”\n said Beetle, his knees white with chalk and dust. Then he received\ntwo hundred lines for insolence, besides an order to go to the nearest\nprefect for judgment and slaughter.\n\nThis is what happened behind the closed doors of Flint’s study, and\nFlint was then Head of the Games:--\n\n“Oh, I say, Flint. King has sent me to you for playin’ marbles in the\ncorridor an’ shoutin’ ‘alley tor’ an’ ‘knuckle down.’”\n\n“What does he suppose I have to do with that?” was the answer.\n\n“Dunno. Well?” Beetle grinned wickedly. “What am I to tell him? He’s\nrather wrathy about it.”\n\n“If the Head chooses to put a notice in the corridor forbiddin’ marbles,\nI can do something; but I can’t move on a house-master’s report. He\nknows that as well as I do.”\n\nThe sense of this oracle Beetle conveyed, all unsweetened, to King, who\nhastened to interview Flint.\n\nNow Flint had been seven and a half years at the College, counting six\nmonths with a London crammer, from whose roof he had returned, homesick,\nto the Head for the final Army polish. There were four or five other\nseniors who had gone through much the same mill, not to mention\nboys, rejected by other establishments on account of a certain\noverwhelmingness, whom the Head had wrought into very fair shape. It was\nnot a Sixth to be handled without gloves, as King found.\n\n“Am I to understand it is your intention to allow board-school games\nunder your study windows, Flint? If so, I can only say--” He said much,\nand Flint listened politely.\n\n“Well, sir, if the Head sees fit to call a prefects’ meeting we are\nbound to take the matter up. But the tradition of the school is that the\nprefects can’t move in any matter affecting the whole school without the\nHead’s direct order.”\n\nMuch more was then delivered, both sides a little losing their temper.\n\nAfter tea, at an informal gathering of prefects in his study, Flint\nrelated the adventure.\n\n“He’s been playin’ for this for a week, and now he’s got it. You know as\nwell as I do that if he hadn’t been gassing at us the way he has, that\nyoung devil Beetle wouldn’t have dreamed of marbles.”\n\n“We know that,” said Perowne, “but that isn’t the question. On\nFlint’s showin’ King has called the prefects names enough to justify\na first-class row. Crammers’ rejections, ill-regulated hobble-de-hoys,\nwasn’t it? Now it’s impossible for prefects--”\n\n“Rot,” said Flint. “King’s the best classical cram we’ve got; and\n‘tisn’t fair to bother the Head with a row. He’s up to his eyes with\nextra-tu and Army work as it is. Besides, as I told King, we _aren’t_ a\npublic school. We’re a limited liability company payin’ four per cent.\nMy father’s a shareholder, too.”\n\n“What’s that got to do with it?” said Venner, a red-headed boy of\nnineteen.\n\n“Well, seems to me that we should be interferin’ with ourselves. We’ve\ngot to get into the Army or--get out, haven’t we? King’s hired by the\nCouncil to teach us. All the rest’s gumdiddle. Can’t you see?”\n\nIt might have been because he felt the air was a little thunderous that\nthe Head took his after-dinner cheroot to Flint’s study; but he so\noften began an evening in a prefect’s room that nobody suspected when he\ndrifted in pensively, after the knocks that etiquette demanded.\n\n“Prefects’ meeting?” A cock of one wise eye-brow.\n\n“Not exactly, sir; we’re just talking things over. Won’t you take the\neasy chair?”\n\n“Thanks. Luxurious infants, you are.” He dropped into Flint’s big\nhalf-couch and puffed for a while in silence. “Well, since you’re all\nhere, I may confess that I’m the mute with the bowstring.”\n\nThe young faces grew serious. The phrase meant that certain of their\nnumber would be withdrawn from all further games for extra-tuition. It\nmight also mean future success at Sandhurst; but it was present ruin for\nthe First Fifteen.\n\n“Yes, I’ve come for my pound of flesh. I ought to have had you out\nbefore the Exeter match; but it’s our sacred duty to beat Exeter.”\n\n“Isn’t the Old Boys’ match sacred, too, sir?” said Perowne. The Old\nBoys’ match was the event of the Easter term.\n\n“We’ll hope they aren’t in training. Now for the list. First I want\nFlint. It’s the Euclid that does it. You must work deductions with me.\nPerowne, extra mechanical drawing. Dawson goes to Mr. King for extra\nLatin, and Venner to me for German. Have I damaged the First Fifteen\nmuch?” He smiled sweetly.\n\n“Ruined it, I’m afraid, sir,” said Flint. “Can’t you let us off till the\nend of the term?”\n\n“Impossible. It will be a tight squeeze for Sandhurst this year.”\n\n“And all to be cut up by those vile Afghans, too,” said Dawson.\n“Wouldn’t think there’d be so much competition, would you?”\n\n“Oh, that reminds me. Crandall is coming down with the Old Boys--I’ve\nasked twenty of them, but we shan’t get more than a weak team. I don’t\nknow whether he’ll be much use, though. He was rather knocked about,\nrecovering poor old Duncan’s body.”\n\n“Crandall major--the Gunner?” Perowne asked.\n\n“No, the minor--‘Toffee’ Crandall--in a native infantry regiment. He was\nalmost before your time, Perowne.”\n\n“The papers didn’t say anything about him. We read about Fat-Sow, of\ncourse. What’s Crandall done, sir?”\n\n“I’ve brought over an Indian paper that his mother sent me. It was\nrather a--hefty, I think you say--piece of work. Shall I read it?” The\nHead knew how to read. When he had finished the quarter-column of close\ntype everybody thanked him politely.\n\n“Good for the old Coll.!” said Perowne. “Pity he wasn’t in time to save\nFat-Sow, though. That’s nine to us, isn’t it, in the last three years?”\n\n“Yes... And I took old Duncan off all games for extra-tu five years ago\nthis term,” said the Head. “By the way, who do you hand over the Games\nto, Flint?”\n\n“Haven’t thought yet. Who’d you recommend, sir?”\n\n“No, thank you. I’ve heard it casually hinted behind my back that the\nProoshan Bates is a downy bird, but he isn’t going to make himself\nresponsible for a new Head of the Games. Settle it among yourselves.\nGood-night.”\n\n“And that’s the man,” said Flint, when the door shut, “that you want to\nbother with a dame’s school row.”\n\n“I was only pullin’ your fat leg,” Perowne returned, hastily. “You’re so\neasy to draw, Flint.”\n\n“Well, never mind that. The Head’s knocked the First Fifteen to bits,\nand we’ve got to pick up the pieces, or the Old Boys will have a\nwalk-over. Let’s promote all the Second Fifteen and make Big Side play\nup. There’s heaps of talent somewhere that we can polish up between now\nand the match.”\n\nThe case was represented so urgently to the school that even Stalky\nand McTurk, who affected to despise football, played one Big-Side game\nseriously. They were forthwith promoted ere their ardor had time to\ncool, and the dignity of their Caps demanded that they should keep some\nshow of virtue. The match-team was worked at least four days out of\nseven, and the school saw hope ahead.\n\nWith the last week of the term the Old Boys began to arrive, and their\nwelcome was nicely proportioned to their worth. Gentlemen cadets from\nSandhurst and Woolwich, who had only left a year ago, but who carried\nenormous side, were greeted with a cheerful “Hullo! What’s the Shop\nlike?” from those who had shared their studies. Militia subalterns had\nmore consideration, but it was understood they were not precisely of the\ntrue metal. Recreants who, failing for the Army, had gone into business\nor banks were received for old sake’s sake, but in no way made too much\nof. But when the real subalterns, officers and gentlemen full-blown--who\nhad been to the ends of the earth and back again and so carried no\nside--came on the scene strolling about with the Head, the school\ndivided right and left in admiring silence. And when one laid hands on\nFlint, even upon the Head of the Games crying, “Good Heavens! What do\nyou mean by growing in this way? You were a beastly little fag when I\nleft,” visible haloes encircled Flint. They would walk to and fro in\nthe corridor with the little red school-sergeant, telling news of old\nregiments; they would burst into form-rooms sniffing the well-remembered\nsmells of ink and whitewash; they would find nephews and cousins in the\nlower forms and present them with enormous wealth; or they would invade\nthe gymnasium and make Foxy show off the new stock on the bars.\n\nChiefly, though, they talked with the Head, who was father-confessor\nand agent-general to them all; for what they shouted in their unthinking\nyouth, they proved in their thoughtless manhood--to wit, that the\nProoshan Bates was “a downy bird.” Young blood who had stumbled into an\nentanglement with a pastry-cook’s daughter at Plymouth; experience who\nhad come into a small legacy but mistrusted lawyers; ambition halting\nat cross-roads, anxious to take the one that would lead him farthest;\nextravagance pursued by the money-lender; arrogance in the thick of a\nregimental row--each carried his trouble to the Head; and Chiron showed\nhim, in language quite unfit for little boys, a quiet and safe way\nround, out, or under. So they overflowed his house, smoked his cigars,\nand drank his health as they had drunk it all the earth over when two or\nthree of the old school had foregathered.\n\n“Don’t stop smoking for a minute,” said the Head. “The more you’re out\nof training the better for us. I’ve demoralized the First Fifteen with\nextra-tu.”\n\n“Ah, but we’re a scratch lot. Have you told ‘em we shall need a\nsubstitute even if Crandall can play?” said a Lieutenant of Engineers\nwith a D.S.O. to his credit.\n\n“He wrote me he’d play, so he can’t have been much hurt. He’s coming\ndown to-morrow morning.”\n\n“Crandall minor that was, and brought off poor Duncan’s body?” The Head\nnodded. “Where are you going to put him? We’ve turned you out of house\nand home already, Head Sahib.” This was a Squadron Commander of Bengal\nLancers, home on leave.\n\n“I’m afraid he’ll have to go up to his old dormitory. You know old boys\ncan claim that privilege. Yes, I think little Crandall minor must bed\ndown there once more.”\n\n“Bates Sahib “--a Gunner flung a heavy arm round the Head’s\nneck--“you’ve got something up your sleeve. Confess! I know that\ntwinkle.”\n\n“Can’t you see, you cuckoo?” a Submarine Miner interrupted. “Crandall\ngoes up to the dormitory as an object-lesson, for moral effect and so\nforth. Isn’t that true, Head Sahib?”\n\n“It is. You know too much, Purvis. I licked you for that in ‘79.”\n\n“You did, sir, and it’s my private belief you chalked the cane.”\n\n“N-no. But I’ve a very straight eye. Perhaps that misled you.”\n\nThat opened the flood-gates of fresh memories, and they all told tales\nout of school.\n\nWhen Crandall minor that was--Lieutenant R. Crandall of an ordinary\nIndian regiment--arrived from Exeter on the morning of the match, he\nwas cheered along the whole front of the College, for the prefects\nhad repeated the sense of that which the Head had read them in Flint’s\nstudy. When Prout’s house understood that he would claim his Old Boy’s\nright to a bed for one night, Beetle ran into King’s house next door\nand executed a public “gloat” up and down the enemy’s big form-room,\ndeparting in a haze of ink-pots.\n\n“What d’you take any notice of those rotters for?” said Stalky,\nplaying substitute for the Old Boys, magnificent in black jersey, white\nknickers, and black stockings. “I talked to _him_ up in the dormitory\nwhen he was changin’. Pulled his sweater down for him. He’s cut about\nall over the arms--horrid purply ones. He’s goin’ to tell us about it\nto-night. I asked him to when I was lacin’ his boots.”\n\n“Well, you _have_ got cheek,” said Beetle, enviously.\n\n“Slipped out before I thought. But he wasn’t a bit angry. He’s no end of\na chap. I swear, I’m goin’ to play up like beans. Tell Turkey!”\n\nThe technique of that match belongs to a bygone age. Scrimmages were\ntight and enduring; hacking was direct and to the purpose; and around\nthe scrimmage stood the school, crying, “Put down your heads and shove!”\n Toward the end everybody lost all sense of decency, and mothers of\nday-boys too close to the touch-line heard language not included in the\nbills. No one was actually carried off the field, but both sides felt\nhappier when time was called, and Beetle helped Stalky and McTurk into\ntheir overcoats. The two had met in the many-legged heart of things,\nand, as Stalky said, had “done each other proud.” As they swaggered\nwoodenly behind the teams--substitutes do not rank as equals of hairy\nmen--they passed a pony-carriage near the wall, and a husky voice cried,\n“Well played. Oh, played indeed!” It was Stettson major, white-checked\nand hollow-eyed, who had fought his way to the ground under escort of an\nimpatient coachman.\n\n“Hullo, Stettson,” said Stalky, checking. “Is it safe to come near you\nyet?”\n\n“Oh, yes. I’m all right. They wouldn’t let me out before, but I had to\ncome to the match. Your mouth looks pretty plummy.”\n\n“Turkey trod on it accidental-done-a-purpose. Well, I’m glad you’re\nbetter, because we owe you something. You and your membranes got us into\na sweet mess, young man.”\n\n“I heard of that,” said the boy, giggling. “The Head told me.”\n\n“Dooce he did! When?”\n\n“Oh, come on up to Coll. My shin’ll stiffen if we stay jawin’ here.”\n\n“Shut up, Turkey. I want to find out about this. Well?”\n\n“He was stayin’ at our house all the time I was ill.”\n\n“What for? Neglectin’ the Coll. that way? ‘Thought he was in town.”\n\n“I was off my head, you know, and they said I kept on callin’ for him.”\n\n“Cheek! You’re only a day-boy.”\n\n“He came just the same, and he about saved my life. I was all bunged up\none night--just goin’ to croak, the doctor said--and they stuck a tube\nor somethin’ in my throat, and the Head sucked out the stuff.”\n\n“Ugh! ‘Shot if _I_ would!”\n\n“He ought to have got diphtheria himself, the doctor said. So he stayed\non at our house instead of going back. I’d ha’ croaked in another twenty\nminutes, the doctor says.”\n\nHere the coachman, being under orders, whipped up and nearly ran over\nthe three.\n\n“My Hat!” said Beetle. “That’s pretty average heroic.”\n\n“Pretty average!” McTurk’s knee in the small of his back cannoned him\ninto Stalky, who punted him back. “You ought to be hung!”\n\n“And the Head ought to get the V.C.,” said Stalky. “Why, he might have\nbeen dead _and_ buried by now. But he wasn’t. But he didn’t. Ho! ho! He\njust nipped through the hedge like a lusty old blackbird. Extra-special,\nfive hundred lines, an’ gated for a week--all sereno!”\n\n“I’ve read o’ somethin’ like that in a book,” said Beetle. “Gummy, what\na chap! Just think of it!”\n\n“I’m thinking,” said McTurk; and he delivered a wild Irish yell that\nmade the team turn round.\n\n“Shut your fat mouth,” said Stalky, dancing with impatience. “Leave it\nto your Uncle Stalky, and he’ll have the Head on toast. If you say\na word, Beetle, till I give you leave, I swear I’ll slay you.\n_Habeo Capitem crinibus minimis._ I’ve got him by the short hairs! Now\nlook as if nothing had happened.”\n\nThere was no need of guile. The school was too busy cheering the drawn\nmatch. It hung round the lavatories regardless of muddy boots while the\nteam washed. It cheered Crandall minor whenever it caught sight of him,\nand it cheered more wildly than ever after prayers, because the Old Boys\nin evening dress, openly twirling their mustaches, attended, and\ninstead of standing with the masters, ranged themselves along the\nwall immediately before the prefects; and the Head called them over,\ntoo--majors, minors, and tertiuses, after their old names.\n\n“Yes, it’s all very fine,” he said to his guests after dinner, “but the\nboys are getting a little out of hand. There will be trouble and sorrow\nlater, I’m afraid. You’d better turn in early, Crandall. The dormitory\nwill be sitting up for you. I don’t know to what dizzy heights you may\nclimb in your profession, but I do know you’ll never get such absolute\nadoration as you’re getting now.”\n\n“Confound the adoration. I want to finish my cigar, sir.”\n\n“It’s all pure gold. Go where glory waits, Crandall--minor.”\n\nThe setting of that apotheosis was a ten-bed attic dormitory,\ncommunicating through doorless openings with three others. The gas\nflickered over the raw pine washstands. There was an incessant\nwhistling of drafts, and outside the naked windows the sea beat on the\nPebbleridge.\n\n“Same old bed--same old mattress, I believe,” said Crandall, yawning.\n“Same old everything. Oh, but I’m lame! I’d no notion you chaps could\nplay like this.” He caressed a battered shin. “You’ve given us all\nsomething to remember you by.”\n\nIt needed a few minutes to put them at their ease; and, in some way they\ncould not understand, they were more easy when Crandall turned round and\nsaid his prayers--a ceremony he had neglected for some years.\n\n“Oh, I _am_ sorry. I’ve forgotten to put out the gas.”\n\n“Please don’t bother,” said the prefect of the dormitory. “Worthington\ndoes that.”\n\nA nightgowned twelve-year-old, who had been waiting to show off, leaped\nfrom his bed to the bracket and back again, by way of a washstand.\n\n“How d’you manage when he’s asleep?” said Crandall, chuckling.\n\n“Shove a cold cleek down his neck.”\n\n“It was a wet sponge when I was junior in the dormitory... Hullo! What’s\nhappening?”\n\nThe darkness had filled with whispers, the sound of trailing rugs, bare\nfeet on bare boards, protests, giggles, and threats such as:\n\n“Be quiet, you ass!... Squattez-vous on the floor, then!... I swear you\naren’t going to sit on _my_ bed!... Mind the tooth-glass,” etc.\n\n“Sta--Corkran said,” the prefect began, his tone showing his sense of\nStalky’s insolence, “that perhaps you’d tell us about that business with\nDuncan’s body.”\n\n“Yes--yes--yes,” ran the keen whispers. “Tell us”\n\n“There’s nothing to tell. What on earth are you chaps hoppin’ about in\nthe cold for?”\n\n“Never mind us,” said the voices. “Tell about Fat-Sow.”\n\nSo Crandall turned on his pillow and spoke to the generation he could\nnot see.\n\n“Well, about three months ago he was commanding a treasure-guard--a cart\nfull of rupees to pay troops with--five thousand rupees in silver. He\nwas comin’ to a place called Fort Pearson, near Kalabagh.”\n\n“I was born there,” squeaked a small fag. “It was called after my\nuncle.”\n\n“Shut up--you and your uncle! Never mind him, Crandall.”\n\n“Well, ne’er mind. The Afridis found out that this treasure was on the\nmove, and they ambushed the whole show a couple of miles before he got\nto the fort, and cut up the escort. Duncan was wounded, and the escort\nhooked it. There weren’t more than twenty Sepoys all told, and there\nwere any amount of Afridis. As things turned out, I was in charge at\nFort Pearson. Fact was, I’d heard the firing and was just going to see\nabout it, when Duncan’s men came up. So we all turned back together.\nThey told me something about an officer, but I couldn’t get the hang of\nthings till I saw a chap under the wheels of the cart out in the open,\npropped up on one arm, blazing away with a revolver. You see, the escort\nhad abandoned the cart, and the Afridis--they’re an awfully suspicious\ngang--thought the retreat was a trap--sort of draw, you know--and the\ncart was the bait. So they had left poor old Duncan alone. ‘Minute they\nspotted how few we were, it was a race across the flat who should reach\nold Duncan first. We ran, and they ran, and we won, and after a little\nhackin’ about they pulled off. I never knew it was one of us till I was\nright on top of him. There are heaps of Duncans in the service, and of\ncourse the name didn’t remind me. He wasn’t changed at all hardly. He’d\nbeen shot through the lungs, poor old man, and he was pretty thirsty.\nI gave him a drink and sat down beside him, and--funny thing, too--he\nsaid, ‘Hullo, Toffee!’ and I said, ‘Hullo, Fat-Sow! hope you aren’t\nhurt,’ or something of the kind. But he died in a minute or two--never\nlifted his head off my knees... I say, you chaps out there will get your\ndeath of cold. Better go to bed.”\n\n“All right. In a minute. But your cuts--your cuts. How did you get\nwounded?”\n\n“That was when we were taking the body back to the Fort. They came on\nagain, and there was a bit of a scrimmage.”\n\n“Did you kill any one?”\n\n“Yes. Shouldn’t wonder. Good-night.”\n\n“Good-night. Thank you, Crandall. Thanks awf’ly, Crandall. Good-night.”\n\nThe unseen crowds withdrew. His own dormitory rustled into bed and lay\nsilent for a while.\n\n“I say, Crandall”--Stalky’s voice was tuned to a wholly foreign\nreverence.\n\n“Well, what?”\n\n“Suppose a chap found another chap croaking with diphtheria--all bunged\nup with it--and they stuck a tube in his throat and the chap sucked the\nstuff out, what would you say?”\n\n“Um,” said Crandall, reflectively. “I’ve only heard of one case, and\nthat was a doctor. He did it for a woman.”\n\n“Oh, this wasn’t a woman. It was just a boy.”\n\n“Makes it all the finer, then. It’s about the bravest thing a man can\ndo. Why?”\n\n“Oh, I heard of a chap doin’ it. That’s all.”\n\n“Then he’s a brave man.”\n\n“Would _you_ funk it?”\n\n“Ra-ather. Anybody would. Fancy dying of diphtheria in cold blood.”\n\n“Well--ah! Er! Look here!” The sentence ended in a grunt, for Stalky had\nleaped out of bed and with McTurk was sitting on the head of Beetle, who\nwould have sprung the mine there and then.\n\nNext day, which was the last of the term and given up to a few wholly\nunimportant examinations, began with wrath and war. Mr. King had\ndiscovered that nearly all his house--it lay, as you know, next door but\none to Prout’s in the long range of buildings--had unlocked the doors\nbetween the dormitories and had gone in to listen to a story told by\nCrandall. He went to the Head, clamorous, injured, appealing; for\nhe never approved of allowing so-called young men of the world to\ncontaminate the morals of boyhood. Very good, said the Head, he would\nattend to it.\n\n“Well, I’m awf’ly sorry,” said Crandall guiltily. “I don’t think I told\n‘em anything they oughtn’t to hear. Don’t let them get into trouble on\nmy account.”\n\n“Tck!” the Head answered, with the ghost of a wink. “It isn’t the boys\nthat make trouble; it’s the masters. However, Prout and King don’t\napprove of dormitory gatherings on this scale, and one must back up the\nhouse-masters. Moreover, it’s hopeless to punish two houses only, so\nlate in the term. We must be fair and include everybody. Let’s see. They\nhave a holiday task for the Easters, which, of course, none of them\nwill ever look at. We will give the whole school, except prefects and\nstudy-boys, regular prep. to-night; and the Common-room will have to\nsupply a master to take it. We must be fair to all.”\n\n“Prep. on the last night of the term. Whew!” said Crandall, thinking of\nhis own wild youth. “I fancy there will be larks.”\n\nThe school, frolicking among packed trunks, whooping down the corridor,\nand “gloating” in form-rooms, received the news with amazement and rage.\nNo school in the world did prep. on the last night of the term. This\nthing was monstrous, tyrannical, subversive of law, religion, and\nmorality. They would go into the form-rooms, and they would take their\ndegraded holiday task with them, but--here they smiled and speculated\nwhat manner of man the Common-room would send up against them. The lot\nfell on Mason, credulous and enthusiastic, who loved youth. No other\nmaster was anxious to take that “prep.,” for the school lacked the\nsteadying influence of tradition; and men accustomed to the ordered\nroutine of ancient foundations found it occasionally insubordinate. The\nfour long form-rooms, in which all below the rank of study-boys worked,\nreceived him with thunders of applause. Ere he had coughed twice they\nfavored him with a metrical summary of the marriage laws of Great\nBritain, as recorded by the High Priest of the Israelites and commented\non by the leader of the host. The lower forms reminded him that it was\nthe last day, and that therefore he must “take it all in play.” When he\ndashed off to rebuke them, the Lower Fourth and Upper Third began with\none accord to be sick, loudly and realistically. Mr. Mason tried, of all\nvain things under heaven, to argue with them, and a bold soul at a\nback desk bade him “take fifty lines for not ‘olding up ‘is ‘and before\nspeaking.” As one who prided himself upon the perfection of his English\nthis cut Mason to the quick, and while he was trying to discover the\noffender, the Upper and Lower Second, three form-rooms away, turned out\nthe gas and threw ink-pots. It was a pleasant and stimulating “prep.”\n The study-boys and prefects heard the echoes of it far off, and the\nCommon-room at dessert smiled.\n\nStalky waited, watch in hand, till half-past eight. “If it goes on much\nlonger the Head will come up,” said he. “We’ll tell the studies first,\nand then the dorm-rooms. Look sharp!”\n\nHe allowed no time for Beetle to be dramatic or McTurk to drawl. They\npoured into study after study, told their tale, and went again so soon\nas they saw they were understood, waiting for no comment; while the\nnoise of that unholy “prep.” grew and deepened. By the door of Flint’s\nstudy they met Mason flying towards the corridor.--“He’s gone to fetch\nthe Head. Hurry up! Come on!” They broke into Number Twelve form-room\nabreast and panting.\n\n“The Head! The Head! The Head!” That call stilled the tumult for a\nminute, and Stalky, leaping to a desk, shouted, “He went and sucked the\ndiphtheria stuff out of Stettson major’s throat when we thought he was\nin town. Stop rotting, you asses! Stettson major would have croaked if\nthe Head hadn’t done it. The Head might have died himself. Crandall\nsays it’s the bravest thing any livin’ man can do, and I”--his voice\ncracked--“the Head don’t know we know!”\n\nMcTurk and Beetle, jumping from desk to desk, drove the news home among\nthe junior forms. There was a pause, and then, Mason behind him, the\nHead entered. It was in the established order of things that no boy\nshould speak or move under his eye. He expected the hush of awe. He was\nreceived with cheers--steady, ceaseless cheering. Being a wise man, he\nwent away, and the forms were silent and a little frightened.\n\n“It’s all right,” said Stalky. “He can’t do much. ‘Tisn’t as if you’d\npulled the desks up like we did when old Carleton took prep. once. Keep\nit up! Hear ‘em cheering in the studies!” He rocketed out with a yell,\nto find Flint and the prefects lifting the roof off the corridor.\n\nWhen the Head of a limited liability company, paying four per cent., is\ncheered on his saintly way to prayers, not only by four form-rooms of\nboys waiting punishment, but by his trusted prefects, he can either\nask for an explanation or go his road with dignity, while the senior\nhouse-master glares like an excited cat and points out to a white and\ntrembling mathematical master that certain methods--not his, thank\nGod---usually produce certain results. Out of delicacy the Old Boys\ndid not attend that call-over; and it was to the school drawn up in the\ngymnasium that the Head spoke icily.\n\n“It is not often that I do not understand you; but I confess I do not\nto-night. Some of you, after your idiotic performances at prep., seem to\nthink me a fit person to cheer. I am going to show you that I am not.”\n\nCrash--crash--crash--came the triple cheer that disproved it, and the\nHead glowered under the gas. “That is enough. You will gain nothing. The\nlittle boys (the Lower School did not like that form of address) will do\nme three hundred lines apiece in the holidays. I shall take no further\nnotice of them. The Upper School will do me one thousand lines apiece in\nthe holidays, to be shown up the evening of the day they come back. And\nfurther--”\n\n“Gummy, what a glutton!” Stalky whispered.\n\n“For your behavior towards Mr. Mason I intend to lick the whole of the\nUpper School to-morrow when I give you your journey-money. This will\ninclude the three study-boys I found dancing on the form-room desks when\nI came up. Prefects will stay after call-over.”\n\nThe school filed out in silence, but gathered in groups by the gymnasium\ndoor waiting what might befall.\n\n“And now, Flint,” said the Head, “will you be good enough to give me\nsome explanation of your conduct?”\n\n“Well, sir,” said Flint desperately, “if you save a chap’s life at the\nrisk of your own when he’s dyin’ of diphtheria, and the Coll. finds it\nout, wha-what can you expect, sir?”\n\n“Um, I see. Then that noise was not meant for--ah, cheek. I can connive\nat immorality, but I cannot stand impudence. However, it does not excuse\ntheir insolence to Mr. Mason. I’ll forego the lines this once, remember;\nbut the lickings hold good.”\n\nWhen this news was made public, the school, lost in wonder and\nadmiration, gasped at the Head as he went to his house. Here was a man\nto be reverenced. On the rare occasions when he caned he did it\nvery scientifically, and the execution of a hundred boys would be\nepic--immense.\n\n“It’s all right, Head Sahib. _We_ know,” said Crandall, as the Head\nslipped off his gown with a grunt in his smoking-room. “I found out just\nnow from our substitute. He was gettin’ my opinion of your performance\nlast night in the dormitory. I didn’t know then that it was you he was\ntalkin’ about. Crafty young animal. Freckled chap with eyes---Corkran, I\nthink his name is.”\n\n“Oh, I know _him_, thank you,” said the Head, and reflectively. “Ye-es,\nI should have included them even if I hadn’t seen ‘em.”\n\n“If the old Coll. weren’t a little above themselves already, we’d chair\nyou down the corridor,” said the Engineer. “Oh, Bates, how could you?\nYou might have caught it yourself, and where would we have been, then?”\n\n“I always knew you were worth twenty of us any day. Now I’m sure of it,”\n said the Squadron Commander, looking round for contradictions.\n\n“He isn’t fit to manage a school, though. Promise you’ll never do it\nagain, Bates Sahib. We--we can’t go away comfy in our minds if you take\nthese risks,” said the Gunner.\n\n“Bates Sahib, you aren’t ever goin’ to cane the whole Upper School, are\nyou?” said Crandall.\n\n“I can connive at immorality, as I said, but I can’t stand impudence.\nMason’s lot is quite hard enough even when I back him. Besides, the\nmen at the golf-club heard them singing ‘Aaron and Moses.’ I shall have\ncomplaints about that from the parents of day-boys. Decency must be\npreserved.”\n\n“We’re coming to help,” said all the guests.\n\n\nThe Upper School were caned one after the other, their overcoats over\ntheir arms, the brakes waiting in the road below to take them to the\nstation, their journey-money on the table. The Head began with Stalky,\nMcTurk, and Beetle. He dealt faithfully by them.\n\n“And here’s your journey-money. Good-by, and pleasant holidays.”\n\n“Good-by. Thank you, sir. Good-by.”\n\nThey shook hands. “Desire don’t outrun performance--much--this mornin’.\nWe got the cream of it,” said Stalky. “Now wait till a few chaps come\nout, and we’ll really cheer him.”\n\n“Don’t wait on our account, please,” said Crandall, speaking for the Old\nBoys. “We’re going to begin now.”\n\nIt was very well so long as the cheering was confined to the corridor,\nbut when it spread to the gymnasium, when the boys awaiting their\nturn cheered, the Head gave it up in despair, and the remnant flung\nthemselves upon him to shake hands. Then they seriously devoted\nthemselves to cheering till the brakes were hustled off the premises in\ndumb-show.\n\n“Didn’t I say I’d get even with him?” said Stalky on the box-seat, as\nthey swung into the narrow Northam street. “Now all together--takin’\ntime from your Uncle Stalky:\n\n   It’s a way we have in the Army,\n   It’s a way we have in the Navy,\n   It’s a way we have at the Public Schools,\n   Which nobody can deny!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. THE FLAG OF THEIR COUNTRY.\n\n\nIt was winter and bitter cold of mornings. Consequently Stalky and\nBeetle--McTurk being of the offensive type that makes ornate toilet\nunder all circumstances--drowsed till the last moment before turning out\nto call-over in the gas-lit gymnasium. It followed that they were often\nlate; and since every unpunctuality earned them a black mark, and since\nthree black marks a week meant defaulters’ drill, equally it followed\nthat they spent hours under the Sergeant’s hand. Foxy drilled the\ndefaulters with all the pomp of his old parade-ground. “Don’t think it’s\nany pleasure to me” (his introduction never varied). “I’d much sooner\nbe smoking a quiet pipe in my own quarters--but I see we ‘ave the Old\nBrigade on our ‘ands this afternoon. If I only ‘ad you regular, Muster\nCorkran,” said he, dressing the line.\n\n“You’ve had me for nearly six weeks, you old glutton. Number off from\nthe right!”\n\n“Not _quite_ so previous, please. I’m taking this drill. Left,\nhalf--turn! Slow--march.” Twenty-five sluggards, all old offenders,\nfiled into the gymnasium. “Quietly provide yourselves with the requisite\ndumb-bells; returnin’ quietly to your place. Number off from the right,\nin a low voice. Odd numbers one pace to the front. Even numbers stand\nfast. Now, leanin’ forward from the ‘ips, takin’ your time from me.”\n\nThe dumb-bells rose and fell, clashed and were returned as one. The boys\nwere experts at the weary game.\n\n“Ve-ry good. I shall be sorry when any of you resume your ‘abits of\npunctuality. Quietly return dumb-bells. We will now try some simple\ndrill.”\n\n“Ugh! I know that simple drill.”\n\n“It would he ‘ighly to your discredit if you did not, Muster Corkran.\n_At_ the same time, it is not so easy as it looks.”\n\n“Bet you a bob, I can drill as well as you, Foxy.”\n\n“We’ll see later. Now try to imagine you ain’t defaulters at all, but\nan ‘arf company on parade, me bein’ your commandin’ officer. There’s\nno call to laugh. If you’re lucky, most of you will ‘ave to take drills\n‘arf your life. Do me a little credit. You’ve been at it long enough,\ngoodness knows.”\n\nThey were formed into fours, marched, wheeled, and countermarched, the\nspell of ordered motion strong on them. As Foxy said, they had been at\nit a long time.\n\nThe gymnasium door opened, revealing McTurk in charge of an old\ngentleman.\n\nThe Sergeant, leading a wheel, did not see. “Not so bad,” he murmured.\n“Not ‘arf so bad. The pivot-man of the wheel _honly_ marks time, Muster\nSwayne. Now, Muster Corkran, you say you know the drill? Oblige me by\ntakin’ over the command and, reversin’ my words step by step, relegate\nthem to their previous formation.”\n\n“What’s this? What’s this?” cried the visitor authoritatively.\n\n“A--a little drill, sir,” stammered Foxy, saying nothing of first\ncauses.\n\n“Excellent--excellent. I only wish there were more of it,” he chirruped.\n“Don’t let me interrupt. You were just going to hand over to someone,\nweren’t you?”\n\nHe sat down, breathing frostily in the chill air. “I shall muck it. I\nknow I shall,” whispered Stalky uneasily; and his discomfort was not\nlightened by a murmur from the rear rank that the old gentleman was\nGeneral Collinson, a member of the College Board of Council.\n\n“Eh--what?” said Foxy.\n\n“Collinson, K.C.B.--He commanded the Pompadours--my father’s old\nregiment,” hissed Swayne major.\n\n“Take your time,” said the visitor. “_I_ know how it feels. Your first\ndrill--eh?”\n\n“Yes, sir.” He drew an unhappy breath. “‘Tention. Dress!” The echo of\nhis own voice restored his confidence.\n\nThe wheel was faced about, flung back, broken into fours, and restored\nto line without a falter. The official hour of punishment was long\npassed, but no one thought of that. They were backing up Stalky--Stalky\nin deadly fear lest his voice should crack.\n\n“He does you credit, Sergeant,” was the visitor’s comment. “A good\ndrill--and good material to drill. Now, it’s an extraordinary thing:\nI’ve been lunching with your head-master and he never told me you had a\ncadet-corps in the College.”\n\n“We ‘aven’t, sir. This is only a little drill,” said the Sergeant.\n\n“But aren’t they keen on it?” said McTurk, speaking for the first time,\nwith a twinkle in his deep-set eyes.\n\n“Why aren’t you in it, though, Willy?”\n\n“Oh, I’m not punctual enough,” said McTurk. “The Sergeant only takes the\npick of us.”\n\n“Dismiss! Break off!” cried Foxy, fearing an explosion in the ranks.\n“I--I ought to have told you, sir, that--”\n\n“But you should have a cadet-corps.” The General pursued his own line of\nthought. “You _shall_ have a cadet-corps, too, if my recommendation\nin Council is any use. I don’t know when I’ve been so pleased. Boys\nanimated by a spirit like yours should set an example to the whole\nschool.”\n\n“They do,” said McTurk.\n\n“Bless my soul! Can it be so late? I’ve kept my fly waiting half an\nhour. Well, I must run away. Nothing like seeing things for one’s self.\nWhich end of the buildings does one get out at? Will you show me, Willy?\nWho was that boy who took the drill?”\n\n“Corkran, I think his name is.”\n\n“You ought to know him. That’s the kind of boy you should cultivate.\nEvidently an unusual sort. A wonderful sight. Five and twenty boys, who,\nI dare say, would much sooner be playing cricket”--(it was the depth\nof winter; but grown people, especially those who have lived long in\nforeign parts, make these little errors, and McTurk did not correct\nhim)--“drilling for the sheer love of it. A shame to waste so much good\nstuff; but I think I can carry my point.”\n\n“An’ who’s your friend with the white whiskers?” demanded Stalky, on\nMcTurk’s return to the study.\n\n“General Collinson. He comes over to shoot with my father sometimes.\nRather a decent old bargee, too. He said I ought to cultivate your\nacquaintance, Stalky.”\n\n“Did he tip you?” McTurk exhibited a blessed whole sovereign.\n\n“Ah,” said Stalky, annexing it, for he was treasurer. “We’ll have a\nhefty brew. You’d pretty average cool cheek, Turkey, to jaw about our\nkeenness an’ punctuality.”\n\n“Didn’t the old boy know we were defaulters?” said Beetle.\n\n“Not him. He came down to lunch with the Head. I found him pokin’ about\nthe place on his own hook afterwards, an’ I thought I’d show him the\ngiddy drill. When I found he was so pleased, I wasn’t goin’ to damp his\ngiddy ardor. He mightn’t ha’ given me the quid if I had.”\n\n“Wasn’t old Foxy pleased? Did you see him get pink behind the ears?”\n said Beetle. “It was an awful score for him. Didn’t we back him\nup beautifully? Let’s go down to Keyte’s and get some cocoa and\nsassingers.”\n\nThey overtook Foxy, speeding down to retail the adventure to Keyte, who\nin his time had been Troop Sergeant-Major in a cavalry regiment, and\nnow, war-worn veteran, was local postmaster and confectioner.\n\n“You owe us something,” said Stalky, with meaning.\n\n“I’m ‘ighly grateful, Muster Corkran. I’ve ‘ad to run against you pretty\nhard in the way o’ business, now and then, but I will say that outside\no’ business--bounds an’ smokin’, an’ such like--I don’t wish to have a\nmore trustworthy young gentleman to ‘elp me out of a hole. The way\nyou ‘andled the drill was beautiful, though I say it. Now, if you come\nregular henceforward--”\n\n“But he’ll have to be late three times a week,” said Beetle. “You can’t\nexpect a chap to do that--just to please you, Foxy.”\n\n“Ah, that’s true. Still, if you could manage it--and you, Muster\nBeetle--it would give you a big start when the cadet-corps is formed. I\nexpect the General will recommend it.”\n\nThey raided Keyte’s very much at their own sweet will, for the old man,\nwho knew them well, was deep in talk with Foxy. “I make what we’ve\ntaken seven and six,” Stalky called at last over the counter; “but you’d\nbetter count for yourself.”\n\n“No--no. I’d take your word any day, Muster Corkran.--In the Pompadours,\nwas he, Sergeant? We lay with them once at Umballa, I think it was.”\n\n“I don’t know whether this ham-and-tongue tin is eighteen pence or one\nan’ four.”\n\n“Say one an’ fourpence, Muster Corkran... Of course, Sergeant, if it was\nany use to give my time, I’d be pleased to do it, but I’m too old. I’d\nlike to see a drill again.”\n\n“Oh, come on, Stalky,” cried McTurk. “He isn’t listenin’ to you. Chuck\nover the money.”\n\n“I want the quid changed, you ass. Keyte! Private Keyte! Corporal Keyte!\nTerroop-Sergeant-Major Keyte, will you give me change for a quid?”\n\n“Yes--yes, of course. Seven an’ six.” He stared abstractedly, pushed the\nsilver over, and melted away into the darkness of the back room.\n\n“Now those two’ll jaw about the Mutiny till tea-time,” said Beetle.\n\n“Old Keyte was at Sobraon,” said Stalky. “Hear him talk about that\nsometimes! Beats Foxy hollow.”\n\n\nThe Head’s face, inscrutable as ever, was bent over a pile of letters.\n\n“What do you think?” he said at last to the Reverend John Gillett.\n\n“It’s a good idea. There’s no denying that--an estimable idea.”\n\n“We concede that much. Well?”\n\n“I have my doubts about it--that’s all. The more I know of boys the less\ndo I profess myself capable of following their moods; but I own I shall\nbe very much surprised if the scheme takes. It--it isn’t the temper of\nthe school. We prepare for the Army.”\n\n“My business--in _this_ matter--is to carry out the wishes of the\nCouncil. They demand a volunteer cadet-corps. A volunteer cadet-corps\nwill be furnished. I have suggested, however, that we need not embark\nupon the expense of uniforms till we are drilled. General Collinson is\nsending us fifty lethal weapons--cut-down Sniders, he calls them--all\ncarefully plugged.”\n\n“Yes, that is necessary in a school that uses loaded saloon-pistols to\nthe extent we do.” The Reverend John smiled.\n\n“Therefore there will be no outlay except the Sergeant’s time.”\n\n“But if he fails you will be blamed.”\n\n“Oh, assuredly. I shall post a notice in the corridor this afternoon,\nand--”\n\n“I shall watch the result.”\n\n\n“Kindly keep your ‘ands off the new arm-rack.” Foxy wrestled with a\nturbulent crowd in the gymnasium. “Nor it won’t do even a condemned\nSnider any good to be continual snappin’ the lock, Mr. Swayne.--Yiss,\nthe uniforms will come later, when we’re more proficient; at present we\nwill confine ourselves to drill. I am ‘ere for the purpose o’ takin’ the\nnames o’ those willin’ to join.--Put down that Snider, Muster Hogan!”\n\n“What are you goin’ to do, Beetle?” said a voice.\n\n“I’ve had all the drill _I_ want, thank you.”\n\n“What! After all you’ve learned? Come on! Don’t be a scab! They’ll make\nyou corporal in a week,” cried Stalky.\n\n“I’m not goin’ up for the Army.” Beetle touched his spectacles.\n\n“Hold on a shake, Foxy,” said Hogan. “Where are you goin’ to drill us?”\n\n“Here--in the gym--till you are fit an’ capable to be taken out on the\nroad.” The Sergeant threw a chest.\n\n“For all the Northam cads to look at? Not good enough, Foxibus.”\n\n“Well, we won’t make a point of it. You learn your drill first, an’\nlater we’ll see.”\n\n“Hullo,” said Ansell of Macrea’s, shouldering through the mob. “What’s\nall this about a giddy cadet-corps?”\n\n“It will save you a lot o’ time at Sandburst,” the Sergeant replied\npromptly. “You’ll be dismissed your drills early if you go up with a\ngood groundin’ before’and.”\n\n“Hm! ‘Don’t mind learnin’ my drill, but I’m not goin’ to ass about the\ncountry with a toy Snider. Perowne, what are you goin’ to do? Hogan’s\njoinin’.”\n\n“Don’t know whether I’ve the time,” said Perowne. “I’ve got no end of\nextra-tu as it is.”\n\n“Well, call this extra-tu,” said Ansell. “‘Twon’t take us long to mug up\nthe drill.”\n\n“Oh, that’s right enough, but what about marchin’ in public?” said\nHogan, not foreseeing that three years later he should die in the\nBurmese sun-light outside Minhla Fort.\n\n“Afraid the uniform won’t suit your creamy complexion?” McTurk asked\nwith a villainous sneer.\n\n“Shut up, Turkey. You aren’t goin’ up for the Army.”\n\n“No, but I’m goin’ to send a substitute. Hi! Morrell an’ Wake! You two\nfags by the arm-rack, you’ve got to volunteer.”\n\nBlushing deeply--they had been too shy to apply before--the youngsters\nsidled towards the Sergeant.\n\n“But I don’t want the little chaps--not at first,” said the\nSergeant disgustedly. “I want--I’d like some of the Old Brigade the\ndefaulters--to stiffen ‘em a bit.”\n\n“Don’t be ungrateful, Sergeant. They’re nearly as big as you get ‘em\nin the Army now.” McTurk read the papers of those years and could be\ntrusted for general information, which he used as he used his “tweaker.”\n Yet he did not know that Wake minor would be a bimbashi of the Egyptian\nArmy ere his thirtieth year.\n\nHogan, Swayne, Stalky, Perowne, and Ansell were deep in consultation by\nthe vaulting-horse, Stalky as usual laying down the law. The Sergeant\nwatched them uneasily, knowing that many waited on their lead.\n\n“Foxy don’t like my recruits,” said McTurk, in a pained tone, to Beetle.\n“You get him some.”\n\nNothing loath, Beetle pinioned two more fags--each no taller than a\ncarbine. “Here you are, Foxy. Here’s food for powder. Strike for your\nhearths an’ homes, you young brutes--an’ be jolly quick about it.”\n\n“Still he isn’t happy,” said McTurk.\n\n   “For the way we have with our Army\n   Is the way we have with our Navy.”\n\nHere Beetle joined in. They had found the poem in an old volume of\n“Punch,” and it seemed to cover the situation:\n\n   “An’ both of ‘em led to adversity,\n   Which nobody can deny!”\n\n“You be quiet, young gentlemen. If you can’t ‘elp--don’t ‘inder.” Foxy’s\neye was still on the council by the horse. Carter, White, and Tyrrell,\nall boys of influence, had joined it. The rest fingered the rifles\nirresolutely. “Wait a shake,” cried Stalky. “Can’t we turn out those\nrotters before we get to work?”\n\n“Certainly,” said Foxy. “Any one wishful to join will stay ‘ere. Those\nwho do not so intend will go out, quietly closin’ the door be’ind ‘em.”\n\nHalf a dozen of the earnest-minded rushed at them, and they had just\ntime to escape into the corridor.\n\n“Well, why don’t you join?” Beetle asked, resettling his collar.\n\n“Why didn’t you?”\n\n“What’s the good? We aren’t goin’ up for the Army. Besides, I know the\ndrill--all except the manual, of course. ‘Wonder what they’re doin’\ninside?”\n\n“Makin’ a treaty with Foxy. Didn’t you hear Stalky say: ‘That’s what\nwe’ll do--an’ if he don’t like it he can lump it’? They’ll use Foxy for\na cram. Can’t you see, you idiot? They’re goin’ up for Sandhurst or the\nShop in less than a year. They’ll learn their drill an’ then they’ll\ndrop it like a shot. D’you suppose chaps with their amount of extra-tu\nare takin’ up volunteerin’ for fun?”\n\n“Well, I don’t know. I thought of doin’ a poem about it--rottin’ ‘em,\nyou know--‘The Ballad of the Dogshooters’--eh?”\n\n“I don’t think you can, because King’ll be down on the corps like a\ncartload o’ bricks. He hasn’t been consulted, he’s sniffin’ round the\nnotice-board now. Let’s lure him.” They strolled up carelessly towards\nthe honse-master--a most meek couple.\n\n“How’s this?” said King with a start of feigned surprise. “Methought you\nwould be learning to fight for your country.”\n\n“I think the company’s full, sir,” said McTurk.\n\n“It’s a great pity,” sighed Beetle.\n\n“Forty valiant defenders, have we, then? How noble! What devotion!\nI presume that it is possible that a desire to evade their normal\nresponsibilities may be at the bottom of this zeal. Doubtless they will\nbe accorded special privileges, like the Choir and the Natural History\nSociety--one must not say Bug-hunters.”\n\n“Oh, I suppose so, sir,” said McTurk, cheerily. “The Head hasn’t said\nanything about it yet, but he will, of course.”\n\n“Oh, sure to.”\n\n“It is just possible, my Beetle,” King wheeled on the last speaker,\n“that the house-masters--a necessary but somewhat neglected factor in\nour humble scheme of existence--may have a word to say on the matter.\nLife, for the young at least, is not all weapons and munitions of war.\nEducation is incidentally one of our aims.”\n\n“What a consistent pig he is,” cooed McTurk, when they were out of\nearshot. “One always knows where to have him. Did you see how he rose to\nthat draw about the Head and special privileges?”\n\n“Confound him, he might have had the decency to have backed the scheme.\nI could do such a lovely ballad, rottin’ it; and now I’ll have to be a\ngiddy enthusiast. It don’t bar our pulling Stalky’s leg in the study,\ndoes it?”\n\n“Oh, no; but in the Coll. we must be pro-cadet-corps like anything.\nCan’t you make up a giddy epigram, _a’ la Catullus_, about King\nobjectin’ to it?” Beetle was at this noble task when Stalky returned all\nhot from his first drill.\n\n“Hullo, my ramrod-bunger!” began McTurk. “Where’s your dead dog? Is it\nDefence or Defiance?”\n\n“Defiance,” said Stalky, and leaped on him at that word. “Look here,\nTurkey, you mustn’t rot the corps. We’ve arranged it beautifully. Foxy\nswears he won’t take us out into the open till we say we want to go.”\n\n“_Dis_-gustin’ exhibition of immature infants apin’ the idiosyncrasies\nof their elders. Snff!”\n\n“Have you drawn King, Beetle?” Stalky asked in a pause of the scuffle.\n\n“Not exactly; but that’s his genial style.”\n\n“Well, listen to your Uncle Stalky--who is a great man. Moreover\nand subsequently, Foxy’s goin’ to let us drill the corps in\nturn--_privatim et seriatim_--so that we’ll all know how to handle a\nhalf company anyhow. _Ergo_, an’ _propter hoc_, when we go to the Shop\nwe shall be dismissed drill early; thus, my beloved ‘earers, combinin’\neducation with wholesome amusement.”\n\n“I knew you’d make a sort of extra-tu of it, you cold-blooded brute,”\n said McTurk. “Don’t you want to die for your giddy country?”\n\n“Not if I can jolly well avoid it. So you mustn’t rot the corps.”\n\n“We’d decided on that, years ago,” said Beetle, scornfully. “King’ll do\nthe rottin’.”\n\n“Then you’ve got to rot King, my giddy poet. Make up a good catchy\nLimerick, and let the fags sing it.”\n\n“Look here, you stick to volunteerin’, and don’t jog the table.”\n\n“He won’t have anything to take hold of,” said Stalky, with dark\nsignificance.\n\nThey did not know what that meant till, a few days later, they proposed\nto watch the corps at drill. They found the gymnasium door locked and a\nfag on guard. “This is sweet cheek,” said McTurk, stooping.\n\n“Mustn’t look through the key-hole,” said the sentry.\n\n“I like that. Why, Wake, you little beast, I made you a volunteer.”\n\n“Can’t help it. My orders are not to allow any one to look.”\n\n“S’pose we do?” said McTurk. “S’pose we jolly well slay you?”\n\n“My orders are, I am to give the name of anybody who interfered with\nme on my post, to the corps, an’ they’d deal with him after drill,\naccordin’ to martial law.”\n\n“What a brute Stalky is!” said Beetle. They never doubted for a moment\nwho had devised that scheme.\n\n“You esteem yourself a giddy centurion, don’t you?” said Beetle,\nlistening to the crash and rattle of grounded arms within.\n\n“My orders are, not to talk except to explain my orders--they’ll lick me\nif I do.”\n\nMcTurk looked at Beetle. The two shook their heads and turned away.\n\n“I swear Stalky _is_ a great man,” said Beetle after a long pause. “One\nconsolation is that this sort of secret-society biznai will drive King\nwild.”\n\nIt troubled many more than King, but the members of the corps were muter\nthan oysters. Foxy, being bound by no vow, carried his woes to Keyte.\n\n“I never come across such nonsense in my life. They’ve tiled the lodge,\ninner and outer guard, all complete, and then they get to work, keen as\nmustard.”\n\n“But what’s it all for?” asked the ex-Troop Sergeant-Major.\n\n“To learn their drill. You never saw anything like it. They begin after\nI’ve dismissed ‘em--practisin’ tricks; but out into the open they will\n_not_ come--not for ever so. The ‘ole thing is pre-posterous. If you’re\na cadet-corps, _I_ say, be a cadet-corps, instead o’ hidin’ be’ind\nlocked doors.”\n\n“And what do the authorities say about it?”\n\n“That beats me again.” The Sergeant spoke fretfully. “I go to the ‘Ead\nan’ ‘e gives me no help. There’s times when I think he’s makin’ fun o’\nme. I’ve never been a Volunteer-sergeant, thank God--but I’ve always had\nthe consideration to pity ‘em. I’m glad o’ that.”\n\n“I’d like to see ‘em,” said Keyte. “From your statements, Sergeant, I\ncan’t get at what they’re after.”\n\n“Don’t ask me, Major! Ask that freckle-faced young Corkran. He’s their\ngeneralissimo.”\n\nOne does not refuse a warrior of Sobraon, or deny the only pastry-cook\nwithin bounds. So Keyte came, by invitation, leaning upon a stick,\ntremulous with old age, to sit in a corner and watch.\n\n“They shape well. They shape uncommon well,” he whispered between\nevolutions.\n\n“Oh, this isn’t what they’re after. Wait till I dismiss ‘em.”\n\nAt the “break-off” the ranks stood fast. Perowne fell out, faced them,\nand, refreshing his memory by glimpses at a red-bound, metal-clasped\nbook, drilled them for ten minutes. (This is that Perowne who was shot\nin Equatorial Africa by his own men.) Ansell followed him, and Hogan\nfollowed Ansell. All three were implicitly obeyed. Then Stalky laid\naside his Snider, and, drawing a long breath, favored the company with a\nblast of withering invective.\n\n“‘Old ‘ard, Muster Corkran. That ain’t in any drill,” cried Foxy.\n\n“All right, Sergeant. You never know what you may have to say to your\nmen.--For pity’s sake, try to stand up without leanin’ against each\nother, you blear-eyed, herrin’-gutted gutter-snipes. It’s no pleasure to\nme to comb you out. That ought to have been done before you came here,\nyou--you militia broom-stealers.”\n\n“The old touch--the old touch. _We_ know it,” said Keyte, wiping his\nrheumy eyes. “But where did he pick it up?”\n\n“From his father--or his uncle. Don’t ask me! Half of ‘em must have been\nborn within earshot o’ the barracks.” (Foxy was not far wrong in his\nguess.) “I’ve heard more back-talk since this volunteerin’ nonsense\nbegan than I’ve heard in a year in the service.”\n\n“There’s a rear-rank man lookin’ as though his belly were in the\npawn-shop. Yes, you, Private Ansell,” and Stalky tongue-lashed the\nvictim for three minutes, in gross and in detail.\n\n“Hullo!” He returned to his normal tone. “First blood to me. You\nflushed, Ansell. You wriggled.”\n\n“Couldn’t help flushing,” was the answer. “Don’t think I wriggled,\nthough.”\n\n“Well, it’s your turn now.” Stalky resumed his place in the ranks.\n\n“Lord, Lord! It’s as good as a play,” chuckled the attentive Keyte.\nAnsell, too, had been blessed with relatives in the service, and slowly,\nin a lazy drawl--his style was more reflective than Stalky’s--descended\nthe abysmal depths of personality.\n\n“Blood to me!” he shouted triumphantly. “You couldn’t stand it, either.”\n Stalky was a rich red, and his Snider shook visibly.\n\n“I didn’t think I would,” he said, struggling for composure, “but after\na bit I got in no end of a bait. Curious, ain’t it?”\n\n“Good for the temper,” said the slow-moving Hogan, as they returned arms\nto the rack.\n\n“Did you ever?” said Foxy, hopelessly, to Keyte.\n\n“I don’t know much about volunteers, but it’s the rummiest show I ever\nsaw. I can see what they’re gettin’ at, though. Lord! how often I’ve\nbeen told off an’ dressed down in my day! They shape well--extremely\nwell they shape.”\n\n“If I could get ‘em out into the open, there’s nothing I couldn’t do\nwith ‘em, Major. Perhaps when the uniforms come down, they’ll change\ntheir mind.”\n\nIndeed it was time that the corps made some concession to the curiosity\nof the school. Thrice had the guard been maltreated and thrice had the\ncorps dealt out martial law to the offender. The school raged. What was\nthe use, they asked, of a cadet-corps which none might see? Mr. King\ncongratulated them on their invisible defenders, and they could not\nparry his thrusts. Foxy was growing sullen and restive. A few of the\ncorps expressed openly doubts as to the wisdom of their course; and the\nquestion of uniforms loomed on the near horizon. If these were issued,\nthey would be forced to wear them.\n\nBut, as so often happens in this life, the matter was suddenly settled\nfrom without.\n\nThe Head had duly informed the Council that their recommendation had\nbeen acted upon, and that, so far as he could learn, the boys were\ndrilling. He said nothing of the terms on which they drilled. Naturally,\nGeneral Collinson was delighted and told his friends. One of his friends\nrejoiced in a friend, a Member of Parliament--a zealous, an intelligent,\nand, above all, a patriotic person, anxious to do the most good in the\nshortest possible time. But we cannot answer, alas! for the friends of\nour friends. If Collinson’s friend had introduced him to the General,\nthe latter would have taken his measure and saved much. But the friend\nmerely spoke of his friend; and since no two people in the world see eye\nto eye, the picture conveyed to Collinson was inaccurate. Moreover, the\nman was an M.P., an impeccable Conservative, and the General had the\nEnglish soldier’s lurking respect for any member of the Court of Last\nAppeal. He was going down into the West country, to spread light in\nsomebody’s benighted constituency. Wouldn’t it be a good idea if, armed\nwith the General’s recommendation, he, taking the admirable and newly\nestablished cadet-corps for his text, spoke a few words--“Just talked\nto the boys a little--eh? You know the kind of thing that would be\nacceptable; and he’d be the very man to do it. The sort of talk that\nboys understand, you know.”\n\n“They didn’t talk to ‘em much in my time,” said the General,\nsuspiciously.\n\n“Ah! but times change--with the spread of education and so on. The boys\nof to-day are the men of to-morrow. An impression in youth is likely to\nbe permanent. And in these times, you know, with the country going to\nthe dogs?”\n\n“You’re quite right.” The island was then entering on five years of Mr.\nGladstone’s rule; and the General did not like what he had seen of it.\nHe would certainly write to the Head, for it was beyond question that\nthe boys of to-day made the men of to-morrow. That, if he might say so,\nwas uncommonly well put.\n\nIn reply, the Head stated that he should be delighted to welcome Mr.\nRaymond Martin, M.P., of whom he had heard so much; to put him up for\nthe night, and to allow him to address the school on any subject that\nhe conceived would interest them. If Mr. Martin had not yet faced an\naudience of this particular class of British youth, the Head had no\ndoubt that he would find it an interesting experience.\n\n“And I don’t think I am very far wrong in that last,” he confided to the\nReverend John. “Do you happen to know anything of one Raymond Martin?”\n\n“I was at College with a man of that name,” the chaplain replied.\n“He was without form and void, so far as I remember, but desperately\nearnest.”\n\n“He will address the Coll. on ‘Patriotism’ next Saturday.”\n\n“If there is one thing our boys detest more than another it is having\ntheir Saturday evenings broken into. Patriotism has no chance beside\n‘brewing.’”\n\n“Nor art either. D’you remember our ‘Evening with Shakespeare’?”\n The Head’s eyes twinkled. “Or the humorous gentleman with the magic\nlantern?”\n\n\n“An’ who the dooce is this Raymond Martin, M.P.?” demanded Beetle, when\nhe read the notice of the lecture in the corridor. “Why do the brutes\nalways turn up on a Saturday?”\n\n“Ouh! Reomeo, Reomeo. Wherefore art thou Reomeo?” said McTurk over his\nshoulder, quoting the Shakespeare artiste of last term. “Well, he won’t\nbe as bad as _her_, I hope. Stalky, are you properly patriotic? Because\nif you ain’t, this chap’s goin’ to make you.”\n\n“Hope he won’t take up the whole of the evening. I suppose we’ve got to\nlisten to him.”\n\n“Wouldn’t miss him for the world,” said McTurk. “A lot of chaps thought\nthat Romeo-Romeo woman was a bore. _I_ didn’t. I liked her! ‘Member\nwhen she began to hiccough in the middle of it? P’raps he’ll hiccough.\nWhoever gets into the Gym first, bags seats for the other two.”\n\n\nThere was no nervousness, but a brisk and cheery affability about Mr.\nRaymond Martin, M.P., as he drove up, watched by many eyes, to the\nHead’s house.\n\n“Looks a bit of a bargee,” was McTurk’s comment. “Shouldn’t be surprised\nif he was a Radical. He rowed the driver about the fare. I heard him.”\n\n“That was his giddy patriotism,” Beetle explained. After tea they joined\nthe rush for seats, secured a private and invisible corner, and began\nto criticise. Every gas-jet was lit. On the little dais at the far end\nstood the Head’s official desk, whence Mr. Martin would discourse, and a\nring of chairs for the masters.\n\nEntered then Foxy, with official port, and leaned something like a\ncloth rolled round a stick against the desk. No one in authority was yet\npresent, so the school applauded, crying: “What’s that, Foxy? What are\nyou stealin’ the gentleman’s brolly for?--We don’t birch here. We cane!\nTake away that bauble!--Number off from the right”--and so forth, till\nthe entry of the Head and the masters ended all demonstrations.\n\n“One good job--the Common-room hate this as much as we do. Watch King\nwrigglin’ to get out of the draft.”\n\n“Where’s the Raymondiferous Martin? Punctuality, my beloved ‘earers, is\nthe image o’ war--”\n\n“Shut up. Here’s the giddy Dook. Golly, what a dewlap!” Mr. Martin,\nin evening dress, was undeniably throaty--a tall, generously designed,\npink-and-white man. Still, Beetle need not have been coarse.\n\n“Look at his back while he’s talkin’ to the Head. Vile bad form to turn\nyour back on the audience! He’s a Philistine--a Bopper--a Jebusite--an’\na Hivite.” McTurk leaned back and sniffed contemptuously.\n\nIn a few colorless words, the Head introduced the speaker and sat\ndown amid applause. When Mr. Martin took the applause to himself, they\nnaturally applauded more than ever. It was some time before he could\nbegin. He had no knowledge of the school--its tradition or heritage. He\ndid not know that the last census showed that eighty per cent. of the\nboys had been born abroad--in camp, cantonment, or upon the high seas;\nor that seventy-five per cent. were sons of officers in one or other of\nthe services--Willoughbys, Paulets, De Castros, Maynes, Randalls, after\ntheir kind--looking to follow their fathers’ profession. The Head might\nhave told him this, and much more; but, after an hour-long dinner in his\ncompany, the Head decided to say nothing whatever. Mr. Raymond Martin\nseemed to know so much already.\n\nHe plunged into his speech with a long-drawn, rasping “Well, boys,”\n that, though they were not conscious of it, set every young nerve ajar.\nHe supposed they knew--hey?--what he had come down for? It was not often\nthat he had an opportunity to talk to boys. He supposed that boys were\nvery much the same kind of persons--some people thought them rather\nfunny persons--as they had been in his youth.\n\n“This man,” said McTurk, with conviction, “is _the_ Gadarene Swine.”\n\nBut they must remember that they would not always be boys. They would\ngrow up into men, because the boys of to-day made the men of to-morrow,\nand upon the men of to-morrow the fair fame of their glorious native\nland depended.\n\n“If this goes on, my beloved ‘earers, it will be my painful duty to rot\nthis bargee.” Stalky drew a long breath through his nose.\n\n“Can’t do that,” said McTurk. “He ain’t chargin’ anything for his\nRomeo.”\n\nAnd so they ought to think of the duties and responsibilities of the\nlife that was opening before them. Life was not all--he enumerated a few\ngames, and, that nothing might be lacking to the sweep and impact of his\nfall, added “marbles.” “Yes, life was not,” he said, “all marbles.”\n\nThere was one tense gasp--among the juniors almost a shriek--of\nquivering horror, he was a heathen--an outcast---beyond the extremest\npale of toleration--self-damned before all men. Stalky bowed his head in\nhis hands. McTurk, with a bright and cheerful eye, drank in every word,\nand Beetle nodded solemn approval.\n\nSome of them, doubtless, expected in a few years to have the honor of a\ncommission from the Queen, and to wear a sword. Now, he himself had had\nsome experience of these duties, as a Major in a volunteer regiment,\nand he was glad to learn that they had established a volunteer corps in\ntheir midst. The establishment of such an establishment conduced to a\nproper and healthy spirit, which, if fostered, would be of great benefit\nto the land they loved and were so proud to belong to. Some of those now\npresent expected, he had no doubt--some of them anxiously looked\nforward to leading their men against the bullets of England’s foes;\nto confronting the stricken field in all the pride of their youthful\nmanhood.\n\nNow the reserve of a boy is tenfold deeper than the reserve of a maid,\nshe being made for one end only by blind Nature, but man for several.\nWith a large and healthy hand, he tore down these veils, and trampled\nthem under the well-intentioned feet of eloquence. In a raucous voice,\nhe cried aloud little matters, like the hope of Honor and the dream of\nGlory, that boys do not discuss even with their most intimate equals,\ncheerfully assuming that, till he spoke, they had never considered these\npossibilities. He pointed them to shining goals, with fingers which\nsmudged out all radiance on all horizons. He profaned the most secret\nplaces of their souls with outcries and gesticulations, he bade them\nconsider the deeds of their ancestors in such a fashion that they were\nflushed to their tingling ears. Some of them--the rending voice cut a\nfrozen stillness--might have had relatives who perished in defence of\ntheir country. They thought, not a few of them, of an old sword in a\npassage, or above a breakfast-room table, seen and fingered by stealth\nsince they could walk. He adjured them to emulate those illustrious\nexamples; and they looked all ways in their extreme discomfort.\n\nTheir years forbade them even to shape their thoughts clearly to\nthemselves. They felt savagely that they were being outraged by a fat\nman who considered marbles a game.\n\nAnd so he worked towards his peroration--which, by the way, he used\nlater with overwhelming success at a meeting of electors--while they\nsat, flushed and uneasy, in sour disgust. After many, many words, he\nreached for the cloth-wrapped stick and thrust one hand in his bosom.\nThis--this was the concrete symbol of their land--worthy of all honor\nand reverence! Let no boy look on this flag who did not purpose to\nworthily add to its imperishable lustre. He shook it before them--a\nlarge calico Union Jack, staring in all three colors, and waited for the\nthunder of applause that should crown his effort.\n\nThey looked in silence. They had certainly seen the thing before--down\nat the coastguard station, or through a telescope, half-mast high when a\nbrig went ashore on Braunton Sands; above the roof of the Golf-club, and\nin Keyte’s window, where a certain kind of striped sweetmeat bore it in\npaper on each box. But the College never displayed it; it was no part\nof the scheme of their lives; the Head had never alluded to it; their\nfathers had not declared it unto them. It was a matter shut up, sacred\nand apart. What, in the name of everything caddish, was he driving at,\nwho waved that horror before their eyes? Happy thought! Perhaps he was\ndrunk.\n\nThe Head saved the situation by rising swiftly to propose a vote of\nthanks, and at his first motion, the school clapped furiously, from a\nsense of relief.\n\n“And I am sure,” he concluded, the gaslight full on his face, “that you\nwill all join me in a very hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Raymond Martin\nfor the most enjoyable address he has given us.”\n\nTo this day we shall never know the rights of the case. The Head\nvows that he did no such thing; or that, if he did, it must have been\nsomething in his eye; but those who were present are persuaded that\nhe winked, once, openly and solemnly, after the word “enjoyable.” Mr.\nRaymond Martin got his applause full tale. As he said, “Without vanity,\nI think my few words went to their hearts. I never knew boys could cheer\nlike that.”\n\nHe left as the prayer-bell rang, and the boys lined up against the wall.\nThe flag lay still unrolled on the desk, Foxy regarding it with pride,\nfor he had been touched to the quick by Mr. Martin’s eloquence. The\nHead and the Common-room, standing back on the dais, could not see the\nglaring offence, but a prefect left the line, rolled it up swiftly, and\nas swiftly tossed it into a glove and foil locker.\n\nThen, as though he had touched a spring, broke out the low murmur of\ncontent, changing to quick-volleyed hand-clapping.\n\nThey discussed the speech in the dormitories. There was not one\ndissentient voice. Mr. Raymond Martin, beyond question, was born in a\ngutter, and bred in a board-school, where they played marbles. He was\nfurther (I give the barest handful from great store) a Flopshus Cad,\nan Outrageous Stinker, a Jelly-bellied Flag-flapper (this was Stalky’s\ncontribution), and several other things which it is not seemly to put\ndown.\n\nThe volunteer cadet-corps fell in next Monday, depressedly, with a face\nof shame. Even then, judicious silence might have turned the corner.\n\nSaid Foxy: “After a fine speech like what you ‘eard night before last,\nyou ought to take ‘old of your drill with _re_-newed activity. I don’t\nsee how you can avoid comin’ out an’ marchin’ in the open now.”\n\n“Can’t we get out of it, then, Foxy?” Stalky’s fine old silky tone\nshould have warned him.\n\n“No, not with his giving the flag so generously. He told me before he\nleft this morning that there was no objection to the corps usin’ it as\ntheir own. It’s a handsome flag.”\n\nStalky returned his rifle to the rack in dead silence, and fell out. His\nexample was followed by Hogan and Ansell. Perowne hesitated. “Look here,\noughtn’t we--?” he began.\n\n“I’ll get it out of the locker in a minute,” said the Sergeant, his back\nturned. “Then we can--”\n\n“Come on!” shouted Stalky. “What the devil are you waiting for? Dismiss!\nBreak off.”\n\n“Why--what the--where the--?”\n\nThe rattle of Sniders, slammed into the rack, drowned his voice, as boy\nafter boy fell out.\n\n“I--I don’t know that I shan’t have to report this to the Head,” he\nstammered.\n\n“Report, then, and be damned to you,” cried Stalky, white to the lips,\nand ran out.\n\n\n“Rummy thing!” said Beetle to McTurk. “I was in the study, doin’ a\nsimply lovely poem about the Jelly-Bellied Flag-Flapper, an’ Stalky\ncame in, an’ I said ‘Hullo!’ an’ he cursed me like a bargee, and then\nhe began to blub like anything. Shoved his head on the table and howled.\nHadn’t we better do something?”\n\nMcTurk was troubled. “P’raps he’s smashed himself up somehow.”\n\nThey found him, with very bright eyes, whistling between his teeth.\n\n“Did I take you in, Beetle? I thought I would. Wasn’t it a good draw?\nDidn’t you think I was blubbin’? Didn’t I do it well? Oh, you fat old\nass!” And he began to pull Beetle’s ears and checks, in the fashion that\nwas called “milking.”\n\n“I knew you were blubbin’,” Beetle replied, composedly. “Why aren’t you\nat drill?”\n\n“Drill! What drill?”\n\n“Don’t try to be a clever fool. Drill in the Gym.”\n\n“‘Cause there isn’t any. The volunteer cadet-corps is broke\nup--disbanded--dead--putrid--corrupt---stinkin’. An’ if you look at me\nlike that, Beetle, I’ll slay you too... Oh, yes, an’ I’m goin’ to be\nreported to the Head for swearin’.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. THE LAST TERM.\n\n\nIt was within a few days of the holidays, the term-end examinations,\nand, more important still, the issue of the College paper which Beetle\nedited. He had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of\nStalky and McTurk and the extreme rigor of study law. Once installed, he\ndiscovered, as others have done before him, that his duty was to do\nthe work while his friends criticized. Stalky christened it the\n“Swillingford Patriot,” in pious memory of Sponge--and McTurk compared\nthe output unfavorably with Ruskin and De Quincey. Only the Head took\nan interest in the publication, and his methods were peculiar. He gave\nBeetle the run of his brown-bound, tobacco-scented library; prohibiting\nnothing, recommending nothing. There Beetle found a fat arm-chair, a\nsilver inkstand, and unlimited pens and paper. There were scores and\nscores of ancient dramatists; there were Hakluyt, his voyages; French\ntranslations of Muscovite authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff; little\ntales of a heady and bewildering nature, interspersed with unusual\nsongs--Peacock was that writer’s name; there was Borrow’s “Lavengro”;\nan odd theme, purporting to be a translation of something, called a\n“Ruba’iyat,” which the Head said was a poem not yet come to its own;\nthere were hundreds of volumes of verse---Crashaw; Dryden; Alexander\nSmith; L. E. L.; Lydia Sigourney; Fletcher and a purple island; Donne;\nMarlowe’s “Faust “; and--this made McTurk (to whom Beetle conveyed it)\nsheer drunk for three days--Ossian; “The Earthly Paradise”; “Atalanta in\nCalydon”; and Rossetti--to name only a few. Then the Head, drifting in\nunder pretense of playing censor to the paper, would read here a\nverse and here another of these poets, opening up avenues. And, slow\nbreathing, with half-shut eyes above his cigar, would he speak of great\nmen living, and journals, long dead, founded in their riotous youth;\nof years when all the planets were little new-lit stars trying to find\ntheir places in the uncaring void, and he, the Head, knew them as young\nmen know one another. So the regular work went to the dogs, Beetle being\nfull of other matters and meters, hoarded in secret and only told to\nMcTurk of an afternoon, on the sands, walking high and disposedly round\nthe wreck of the Armada galleons, shouting and declaiming against the\nlong-ridged seas.\n\nThanks in large part to their house-master’s experienced distrust, the\nthree for three consecutive terms had been passed over for promotion to\nthe rank of prefect--an office that went by merit, and carried with it\nthe honor of the ground-ash, and liberty, under restrictions, to use it.\n\n“_But_,” said Stalky, “come to think of it, we’ve done more giddy\njesting with the Sixth since we’ve been passed over than any one else in\nthe last seven years.”\n\nHe touched his neck proudly. It was encircled by the stiffest of\nstick-up collars, which custom decreed could be worn only by the Sixth.\nAnd the Sixth saw those collars and said no word. “Pussy,” Abanazar, or\nDick Four of a year ago would have seen them discarded in five minutes\nor... But the Sixth of that term was made up mostly of young but\nbrilliantly clever boys, pets of the house-masters, too anxious for\ntheir dignity to care to come to open odds with the resourceful three.\nSo they crammed their caps at the extreme back of their heads,\ninstead of a trifle over one eye as the Fifth should, and rejoiced\nin patent-leather boots on week-days, and marvellous made-up ties on\nSundays--no man rebuking. McTurk was going up for Cooper’s Hill, and\nStalky for Sandhurst, in the spring; and the Head had told them both\nthat, unless they absolutely collapsed during the holidays, they were\nsafe. As a trainer of colts, the Head seldom erred in an estimate of\nform.\n\nHe had taken Beetle aside that day and given him much good advice, not\none word of which did Beetle remember when he dashed up to the study,\nwhite with excitement, and poured out the wondrous tale. It demanded a\ngreat belief.\n\n“You begin on a hundred a year?” said McTurk unsympathetically. “Rot!”\n\n“And my passage out! It’s all settled. The Head says he’s been breaking\nme in for this for ever so long, and I never knew--I never knew. One\ndon’t begin with writing straight off, y’know. Begin by filling in\ntelegrams and cutting things out o’ papers with scissors.”\n\n“Oh, Scissors! What an ungodly mess you’ll make of it,” said Stalky.\n“But, anyhow, this will be your last term, too. Seven years, my dearly\nbeloved ‘earers--though not prefects.”\n\n“Not half bad years, either,” said McTurk. “I shall be sorry to leave\nthe old Coll.; shan’t you?”\n\nThey looked out over the sea creaming along the Pebbleridge in the clear\nwinter light. “Wonder where we shall all be this time next year?” said\nStalky absently.\n\n“This time five years,” said McTurk.\n\n“Oh,” said Beetle, “my leavin’s between ourselves. The Head hasn’t told\nany one. I know he hasn’t, because Prout grunted at me to-day that if\nI were more reasonable--yah!--I might be a prefect next term. I s’ppose\nhe’s hard up for his prefects.”\n\n“Let’s finish up with a row with the Sixth,” suggested McTurk.\n\n“Dirty little schoolboys!” said Stalky, who already saw himself a\nSandhurst cadet. “What’s the use?”\n\n“Moral effect,” quoth McTurk. “Leave an imperishable tradition, and all\nthe rest of it.”\n\n“Better go into Bideford an’ pay up our debts,” said Stalky. “I’ve got\nthree quid out of my father--_ad hoc_. Don’t owe more than thirty bob,\neither. Cut along, Beetle, and ask the Head for leave. Say you want to\ncorrect the ‘Swillingford Patriot.’”\n\n“Well, I do,” said Beetle. “It’ll be my last issue, and I’d like it to\nlook decent. I’ll catch him before he goes to his lunch.”\n\nTen minutes later they wheeled out in line, by grace released from\nfive o’clock call-over, and all the afternoon lay before them. So also\nunluckily did King, who never passed without witticisms. But brigades of\nKings could not have ruffled Beetle that day.\n\n“Aha! Enjoying the study of light literature, my friends,” said he,\nrubbing his hands. “Common mathematics are not for such soaring minds as\nyours, are they?”\n\n(“One hundred a year,” thought Beetle, smiling into vacancy.)\n\n“Our open incompetence takes refuge in the flowery paths of inaccurate\nfiction. But a day of reckoning approaches, Beetle mine. I myself have\nprepared a few trifling foolish questions in Latin prose which can\nhardly be evaded even by your practised acts of deception. Ye-es, Latin\nprose. I think, if I may say so--but we shall see when the papers are\nset--‘Ulpian serves your need.’ Aha! ‘_Elucescebat_, quoth our friend.’\nWe shall see! We shall see!”\n\nStill no sign from Beetle. He was on a steamer, his passage paid into\nthe wide and wonderful world--a thousand leagues beyond Lundy Island.\n\nKing dropped him with a snarl.\n\n“He doesn’t know. He’ll go on correctin’ exercises an’ jawin’ an’\nshowin’ off before the little boys next term--and next.” Beetle hurried\nafter his companions up the steep path of the furze-clad hill behind the\nCollege.\n\nThey were throwing pebbles on the top of the gasometer, and the grimy\ngas-man in change bade them desist. They watched him oil a turncock sunk\nin the ground between two furze-bushes.\n\n“Cokey, what’s that for?” said Stalky.\n\n“To turn the gas on to the kitchens,” said Cokey. “If so be I\ndidn’t turn her on, yeou young gen’lemen ‘ud be larnin’ your book by\ncandlelight.”\n\n“Um!” said Stalky, and was silent for at least a minute.\n\n“Hullo! Where are you chaps going?” A bend of the lane brought them\nface to face with Tulke, senior prefect of King’s house--a smallish,\nwhite-haired boy, of the type that must be promoted on account of\nits intellect, and ever afterwards appeals to the Head to support its\nauthority when zeal has outrun discretion.\n\nThe three took no sort of notice. They were on lawful pass. Tulke\nrepeated his question hotly, for he had suffered many slights from\nNumber Five study, and fancied that he had at last caught them tripping.\n\n“What the devil is that to you?” Stalky replied with his sweetest smile.\n\n“Look here, I’m not goin’--I’m not goin’ to be sworn at by the Fifth!”\n sputtered Tulke.\n\n“Then cut along and call a prefects’ meeting,” said McTurk, knowing\nTulke’s weakness.\n\nThe prefect became inarticulate with rage.\n\n“Mustn’t yell at the Fifth that way,” said Stalky. “It’s vile bad form.”\n\n“Cough it up, ducky!” McTurk said calmly.\n\n“I--I want to know what you chaps are doing out of bounds?” This with an\nimportant flourish of his ground-ash.\n\n“Ah,” said Stalky. “Now we’re gettin’ at it. Why didn’t you ask that\nbefore?”\n\n“Well, I ask it now. What are you doing?”\n\n“We’re admiring you, Tulke,” said Stalky. “We think you’re no end of a\nfine chap, don’t we?”\n\n“We do! We do!” A dog-cart with some girls in it swept round the corner,\nand Stalky promptly kneeled before Tulke in the attitude of prayer; so\nTulke turned a color.\n\n“I’ve reason to believe--” he began.\n\n“Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!” shouted Beetle, after the manner of Bideford’s town\ncrier, “Tulke has reason to believe! Three cheers for Tulke!”\n\nThey were given. “It’s all our giddy admiration,” said Stalky. “You know\nhow we love you, Tulke. We love you so much we think you ought to go\nhome and die. You’re too good to live, Tulke.”\n\n“Yes,” said McTurk. “Do oblige us by dyin’. Think how lovely you’d look\nstuffed!”\n\nTulke swept up the road with an unpleasant glare in his eye.\n\n“That means a prefects’ meeting--sure pop,” said Stalky. “Honor of the\nSixth involved, and all the rest of it. Tulke’ll write notes all this\nafternoon, and Carson will call us up after tea. They daren’t overlook\nthat.”\n\n“Bet you a bob he follows us!” said McTurk. “He’s King’s pet, and it’s\nscalps to both of ‘em if we’re caught out. We must be virtuous.”\n\n“Then I move we go to Mother Yeo’s for a last gorge. We owe her about\nten bob, and Mary’ll weep sore when she knows we’re leaving,” said\nBeetle.\n\n“She gave me an awful wipe on the head last time--Mary,” said Stalky.\n\n“She does if you don’t duck,” said McTurk. “But she generally kisses one\nback. Let’s try Mother Yeo.”\n\nThey sought a little bottle-windowed half dairy, half restaurant, a\ndark-brewed, two-hundred-year-old house, at the head of a narrow side\nstreet. They had patronized it from the days of their fagdom, and were\nvery much friends at home.\n\n“We’ve come to pay our debts, mother,” said Stalky, sliding his arm\nround the fifty-six-inch waist of the mistress of the establishment. “To\npay our debts and say good-by--and--and we’re awf’ly hungry.”\n\n“Aie!” said Mother Yeo, “makkin’ love to me! I’m shaamed of ‘ee.”\n\n“‘Rackon us wouldn’t du no such thing if Mary was here,” said McTurk,\nlapsing into the broad North Devon that the boys used on their\ncampaigns.\n\n“Who’m takin’ my name in vain?” The inner door opened, and Mary,\nfair-haired, blue-eyed, and apple-checked, entered with a bowl of cream\nin her hands. McTurk kissed her. Beetle followed suit, with exemplary\ncalm. Both boys were promptly cuffed.\n\n“Niver kiss the maid when ‘e can kiss the mistress,” said Stalky,\nshamelessly winking at Mother Yeo, as he investigated a shelf of jams.\n\n“Glad to see one of ‘ee don’t want his head slapped no more?” said Mary\ninvitingly, in that direction.\n\n“Neu! Reckon I can get ‘em give me,” said Stalky, his back turned.\n\n“Not by me--yeou little masterpiece!”\n\n“Niver asked ‘ee. There’s maids to Northam. Yiss--an’ Appledore.” An\nunreproducible sniff, half contempt, half reminiscence, rounded the\nretort.\n\n“Aie! Yeou won’t niver come to no good end. Whutt be ‘baout, smellin’\nthe cream?”\n\n“‘Tees bad,” said Stalky. “Zmell ‘un.”\n\nIncautiously Mary did as she was bid.\n\n“Bidevoor kiss.”\n\n“Niver amiss,” said Stalky, taking it without injury.\n\n“Yeou--yeou--yeou--” Mary began, bubbling with mirth.\n\n“They’m better to Northam--more rich, laike an’ us gets them give back\nagain,” he said, while McTurk solemnly waltzed Mother Yeo out of breath,\nand Beetle told Mary the sad news, as they sat down to clotted cream,\njam, and hot bread.\n\n“Yiss. Yeou’ll niver zee us no more, Mary. We’re goin’ to be passons an’\nmissioners.”\n\n“Steady the Buffs!” said McTurk, looking through the blind. “Tulke has\nfollowed us. He’s comin’ up the street now.”\n\n“They’ve niver put us out o’ bounds,” said Mother Yeo. “Bide yeou still,\nmy little dearrs.” She rolled into the inner room to make the score.\n\n“Mary,” said Stalky, suddenly, with tragic intensity. “Do ‘ee lov’ me,\nMary?”\n\n“Iss--fai! Talled ‘ee zo since yeou was zo high!” the damsel replied.\n\n“Zee ‘un comin’ up street, then?” Stalky pointed to the unconscious\nTulke. “He’ve niver been kissed by no sort or manner o’ maid in hees\nborned laife, Mary. Oh, ‘tees shaamful!”\n\n“Whutt’s to do with me? ‘Twill come to ‘un in the way o’ nature, I\nrackon.” She nodded her head sagaciously. “You niver want me to kiss\nun--sure-_ly_?”\n\n“Give ‘ee half-a-crown if ‘ee will,” said Stalky, exhibiting the coin.\n\nHalf-a-crown was much to Mary Yeo, and a jest was more; but\n\n“Yeu’m afraid,” said McTurk, at the psychological moment.\n\n“Aie!” Beetle echoed, knowing her weak point. “There’s not a maid to\nNortham ‘ud think twice. An’ yeou such a fine maid, tu!”\n\nMcTurk planted one foot firmly against the inner door lest Mother Yeo\nshould return inopportunely, for Mary’s face was set. It was then that\nTulke found his way blocked by a tall daughter of Devon--that county of\neasy kisses, the pleasantest under the sun. He dodged aside politely.\nShe reflected a moment, and laid a vast hand upon his shoulder.\n\n“Where be ‘ee gwaine tu, my dearr?” said she.\n\nOver the handkerchief he had crammed into his mouth Stalky could see the\nboy turn scarlet.\n\n“Gie I a kiss! Don’t they larn ‘ee manners to College?”\n\nTulke gasped and wheeled. Solemnly and conscientiously Mary kissed him\ntwice, and the luckless prefect fled.\n\nShe stepped into the shop, her eyes full of simple wonder. “Kissed ‘un?”\n said Stalky, handing over the money.\n\n“Iss, fai! But, oh, my little body, he’m no Colleger. ‘Zeemed tu-minded\nto cry, like.”\n\n“Well, we won’t. Yell couldn’t make us cry that way,” said McTurk.\n“Try.”\n\nWhereupon Mary cuffed them all round.\n\nAs they went out with tingling ears, said Stalky generally, “Don’t think\nthere’ll be much of a prefects’ meeting.”\n\n“Won’t there, just!” said Beetle. “Look here. If he kissed her--which\nis our tack--he is a cynically immoral hog, and his conduct is blatant\nindecency. _Confer orationes Regis furiosissimi_, when he collared me\nreadin’ ‘Don Juan.’”\n\n“‘Course he kissed her,” said McTurk. “In the middle of the street. With\nhis house-cap on!”\n\n“Time, 3.57 p.m. Make a note o’ that. What d’you mean, Beetle?” said\nStalky.\n\n“Well! He’s a truthful little beast. He may say he was kissed.”\n\n“And then?”\n\n“Why, then!” Beetle capered at the mere thought of it. “Don’t you see?\nThe corollary to the giddy proposition is that the Sixth can’t protect\n‘emselves from outrages an’ ravishin’s. Want nursemaids to look after\n‘em! We’ve only got to whisper that to the Coll. Jam for the Sixth! Jam\nfor us! Either way it’s jammy!”\n\n“By Gum!” said Stalky. “Our last term’s endin’ well. Now you cut along\nan’ finish up your old rag, and Turkey and me will help. We’ll go in the\nback way. No need to bother Randall.”\n\n“Don’t play the giddy garden-goat, then?” Beetle knew what help meant,\nthough he was by no means averse to showing his importance before his\nallies. The little loft behind Randall’s printing office was his own\nterritory, where he saw himself already controlling the “Times.” Here,\nunder the guidance of the inky apprentice, he had learned to find his\nway more or less circuitously about the case, and considered himself an\nexpert compositor.\n\nThe school paper in its locked formes lay on a stone-topped table, a\nproof by the side; but not for worlds would Beetle have corrected from\nthe mere proof. With a mallet and a pair of tweezers, he knocked out\nmysterious wedges of wood that released the forme, picked a letter here\nand inserted a letter there, reading as he went along and stopping much\nto chuckle over his own contributions.\n\n“You won’t show off like that,” said McTurk, “when you’ve got to do it\nfor your living. Upside down and backwards, isn’t it? Let’s see if I can\nread it.”\n\n“Get out!” said Beetle. “Go and read those formes in the rack there, if\nyou think you know so much.”\n\n“Formes in a rack! What’s that? Don’t be so beastly professional.”\n\nMcTurk drew off with Stalky to prowl about the office. They left little\nunturned.\n\n“Come here a shake, Beetle. What’s this thing?” aid Stalky, in a few\nminutes. “Looks familiar.”\n\nSaid Beetle, after a glance: “It’s King’s Latin prose exam. paper.\n_In--In Varrem: actio prima_. What a lark!”\n\n“Think o’ the pure-souled, high-minded boys who’d give their eyes for a\nsquint at it!” said McTurk.\n\n“No, Willie dear,” said Stalky; “that would be wrong and painful to our\nkind teachers. You wouldn’t crib, Willie, would you?”\n\n“Can’t read the beastly stuff, anyhow,” was the reply. “Besides, we’re\nleavin’ at the end o’ the term, so it makes no difference to us.”\n\n“‘Member what the Considerate Bloomer did to Spraggon’s account of the\nPuffin’ton Hounds? We must sugar Mr. King’s milk for him,” said Stalky,\nall lighted from within by a devilish joy. “Let’s see what Beetle can do\nwith those forceps he’s so proud of.”\n\n“Don’t see now you can make Latin prose much more cock-eye than it is,\nbut we’ll try,” said Beetle, transposing an _aliud_ and _Asiae_ from two\nsentences. “Let’s see! We’ll put that full-stop a little further on,\nand begin the sentence with the next capital. Hurrah! Here’s three lines\nthat can move up all in a lump.”\n\n“‘One of those scientific rests for which this eminent huntsman is so\njustly celebrated.’” Stalky knew the Puffington run by heart.\n\n“Hold on! Here’s a _vol_--_voluntate quidnam_ all by itself,” said\nMcTurk.\n\n“I’ll attend to her in a shake. _Quidnam_ goes after _Dolabella_.”\n\n“Good old Dolabella,” murmured Stalky. “Don’t break him. Vile prose\nCicero wrote, didn’t he? He ought to be grateful for--”\n\n“Hullo!” said McTurk, over another forme. “What price a giddy ode?\n_Qui_--_quis_--oh, it’s _Quis multa gracilis_, o’ course.”\n\n“Bring it along. We’ve sugared the milk here,” said Stalky, after a few\nminutes’ zealous toil. “Never thrash your hounds unnecessarily.”\n\n“_Quis munditiis_? I swear that’s not bad,” began Beetle, plying the\ntweezers. “Don’t that interrogation look pretty? _Heu quoties fidem_!\nThat sounds as if the chap were anxious an’ excited. _Cui flavam religas\nin rosa_--Whose flavor is relegated to a rose. _Mutatosque Deos flebit\nin antro_.”\n\n“Mute gods weepin’ in a cave,” suggested Stalky. “‘Pon my Sam, Horace\nneeds as much lookin’ after as--Tulke.”\n\nThey edited him faithfully till it was too dark to see.\n\n\n“‘Aha! Elucescebat, quoth our friend.’ Ulpian serves my need, does it?\nIf King can make anything out of _that_, I’m a blue-eyed squatteroo,”\n said Beetle, as they slid out of the loft window into a back alley of\nold acquaintance and started on a three-mile trot to the College. But\nthe revision of the classics had detained them too long. They halted,\nblown and breathless, in the furze at the back of the gasometer, the\nCollege lights twinkling below, ten minutes at least late for tea and\nlock-up.\n\n“It’s no good,” puffed McTurk. “Bet a bob Foxy is waiting for defaulters\nunder the lamp by the Fives Court. It’s a nuisance, too, because the\nHead gave us long leave, and one doesn’t like to break it.”\n\n“‘Let me now from the bonded ware’ouse of my knowledge,’” began Stalky.\n\n“Oh, rot! Don’t Jorrock. Can we make a run for it?” snapped McTurk.\n\n“‘Bishops’ boots Mr. Radcliffe also condemned, an’ spoke ‘ighly in favor\nof tops cleaned with champagne an’ abricot jam.’ Where’s that thing\nCokey was twiddlin’ this afternoon?”\n\nThey heard him groping in the wet, and presently beheld a great miracle.\nThe lights of the Coastguard cottages near the sea went out; the\nbrilliantly illuminated windows of the Golf-club disappeared, and were\nfollowed by the frontages of the two hotels. Scattered villas dulled,\ntwinkled, and vanished. Last of all, the College lights died also. They\nwere left in the pitchy darkness of a windy winter’s night.\n\n“‘Blister my kidneys. It _is_ a frost. The dahlias are dead!’” said\nStalky. “Bunk!”\n\nThey squattered through the dripping gorse as the College hummed like\nan angry hive and the dining-rooms chorused, “Gas! gas! gas!” till they\ncame to the edge of the sunk path that divided them from their study.\nDropping that ha-ha like bullets, and rebounding like boys, they dashed\nto their study, in less than two minutes had changed into dry trousers\nand coat, and, ostentatiously slippered, joined the mob in the\ndining-hall, which resembled the storm-centre of a South American\nrevolution.\n\n“‘Hellish dark and smells of cheese.’” Stalky elbowed his way into\nthe press, howling lustily for gas. “Cokey must have gone for a walk.\nFoxy’ll have to find him.”\n\nProut, as the nearest house-master, was trying to restore order, for\nrude boys were flicking butter-pats across chaos, and McTurk had turned\non the fags’ tea-urn, so that many were parboiled and wept with an\nunfeigned dolor. The Fourth and Upper Third broke into the school song,\nthe “Vive la Compagnie,” to the accompaniment of drumming knife-handles;\nand the junior forms shrilled bat-like shrieks and raided one another’s\nvictuals. Two hundred and fifty boys in high condition, seeking for more\nlight, are truly earnest inquirers.\n\nWhen a most vile smell of gas told them that supplies had been renewed,\nStalky, waistcoat unbuttoned, sat gorgedly over what might have been\nhis fourth cup of tea. “And that’s all right,” he said. “Hullo! ‘Ere’s\nPomponius Ego!”\n\nIt was Carson, the head of the school, a simple, straight-minded soul,\nand a pillar of the First Fifteen, who crossed over from the prefects’\ntable and in a husky, official voice invited the three to attend in his\nstudy in half an hour. “Prefects’ meetin’! Prefects’ meetin’!” hissed\nthe tables, and they imitated barbarically the actions and effects of\nthe ground-ash.\n\n“How are we goin’ to jest with ‘em?” said Stalky, turning half-face to\nBeetle. “It’s your play this time!”\n\n“Look here,” was the answer, “all I want you to do is not to laugh. I’m\ngoin’ to take charge o’ young Tulke’s immorality--_a’ la_ King, and it’s\ngoin’ to be serious. If you can’t help laughin’ don’t look at me, or\nI’ll go pop.”\n\n“I see. All right,” said Stalky.\n\nMcTurk’s lank frame stiffened in every muscle and his eyelids dropped\nhalf over his eyes. That last was a war-signal.\n\nThe eight or nine seniors, their faces very set and sober, were ranged\nin chairs round Carson’s severely Philistine study. Tulke was not\npopular among them, and a few who had had experience of Stalky and\nCompany doubted that he might, perhaps, have made an ass of himself. But\nthe dignity of the Sixth was to be upheld. So Carson began hurriedly:\n“Look here, you chaps, I’ve--we’ve sent for you to tell you you’re a\ngood deal too cheeky to the Sixth--have been for some time--and--and\nwe’ve stood about as much as we’re goin’ to, and it seems you’ve been\ncursin’ and swearin’ at Tulke on the Bideford road this afternoon, and\nwe’re goin’ to show you you can’t do it. That’s all.”\n\n“Well, that’s awfully good of you,” said Stalky, “but we happen to have\na few rights of our own, too. You can’t, just because you happen to\nbe made prefects, haul up seniors and jaw ‘em on spec., like a\nhouse-master. We aren’t fags, Carson. This kind of thing may do for\nDavies Tertius, but it won’t do for us.”\n\n“It’s only old Prout’s lunacy that we weren’t prefects long ago. You\nknow that,” said McTurk. “You haven’t any tact.”\n\n“Hold on,” said Beetle. “A prefects’ meetin’ has to be reported to the\nHead. I want to know if the Head backs Tulke in this business?”\n\n“Well--well, it isn’t exactly a prefects’ meeting,” said Carson. “We\nonly called you in to warn you.”\n\n“But all the prefects are here,” Beetle insisted. “Where’s the\ndifference?”\n\n“My Gum!” said Stalky. “Do you mean to say you’ve just called us in for\na jaw--after comin’ to us before the whole school at tea an’ givin’ ‘em\nthe impression it was a prefects’ meeting? ‘Pon my Sam, Carson, you’ll\nget into trouble, you will.”\n\n“Hole-an’-corner business--hole-an’-corner business,” said McTurk,\nwagging his head. “Beastly suspicious.”\n\nThe Sixth looked at each other uneasily. Tulke had called three\nprefects’ meetings in two terms, till the Head had informed the Sixth\nthat they were expected to maintain discipline without the recurrent\nmenace of his authority. Now, it seemed that they had made a blunder at\nthe outset, but any right-minded boy would have sunk the legality and\nbeen properly impressed by the Court. Beetle’s protest was distinct\n“cheek.”\n\n“Well, you chaps deserve a lickin’,” cried one Naughten incautiously.\nThen was Beetle filled with a noble inspiration.\n\n“For interferin’ with Tulke’s amours, eh?” Tulke turned a rich sloe\ncolor. “Oh, no, you don’t!” Beetle went on. “You’ve had your innings.\nWe’ve been sent up for cursing and swearing at you, and we’re goin’ to\nbe let off with a warning! _Are_ we? Now then, you’re going to catch\nit.”\n\n“I--I--I” Tulke began. “Don’t let that young devil start jawing.”\n\n“If you’ve anything to say you must say it decently,’’ said Carson.\n\n“Decently? I will. Now look here. When we went into Bideford we met this\nornament of the Sixth--is that decent enough?--hanging about on the\nroad with a nasty look in his eye. We didn’t know _then_ why he was so\nanxious to stop us, _but_ at five minutes to four, when we were in Yeo’s\nshop, we saw Tulke in broad daylight, with his house-cap on, kissin’ an’\nhuggin’ a woman on the pavement. Is that decent enough for you?”\n\n“I didn’t--I wasn’t.”\n\n“We saw you!” said Beetle. “And now--I’ll be decent, Carson--you sneak\nback with her kisses” (not for nothing had Beetle perused the later\npoets) “hot on your lips and call prefects’ meetings, which aren’t\nprefects’ meetings, to uphold the honor of the Sixth.” A new and\nheaven-cleft path opened before him that instant. “And how do we know,”\n he shouted--“how do we know how many of the Sixth are mixed up in this\nabominable affair?”\n\n“Yes, that’s what we want to know,” said McTurk, with simple dignity.\n\n“We meant to come to you about it quietly, Carson, but you would have\nthe meeting,” said Stalky sympathetically.\n\nThe Sixth were too taken aback to reply. So, carefully modelling\nhis rhetoric on King, Beetle followed up the attack, surpassing and\nsurprising himself, “It--it isn’t so much the cynical immorality of the\nbiznai, as the blatant indecency of it, that’s so awful. As far as we\ncan see, it’s impossible for us to go into Bideford without runnin’ up\nagainst some prefect’s unwholesome amours. There’s nothing to snigger\nover, Naughten. I don’t pretend to know much about these things--but it\nseems to me a chap must be pretty far dead in sin” (that was a quotation\nfrom the school chaplain) “when he takes to embracing his paramours”\n (that was Hakluyt) “before all the city” (a reminiscence of Milton).\n“He might at least have the decency--you’re authorities on decency,\nI believe--to wait till dark. But he didn’t. You didn’t! Oh, Tulke.\nYou--you incontinent little animal!”\n\n“Here, shut up a minute. What’s all this about, Tulke?” said Carson.\n\n“I--look here. I’m awfully sorry. I never thought Beetle would take this\nline.”\n\n“Because--you’ve--no decency--you--thought--I hadn’t,” cried Beetle all\nin one breath.\n\n“Tried to cover it all up with a conspiracy, did you?” said Stalky.\n\n“Direct insult to all three of us,” said McTurk. “A most filthy mind you\nhave, Tulke.”\n\n“I’ll shove you fellows outside the door if you go on like this,” said\nCarson angrily.\n\n“That proves it’s a conspiracy,” said Stalky, with the air of a virgin\nmartyr.\n\n“I--I was goin’ along the street--I swear I was,” cried Tulke, “and--and\nI’m awfully sorry about it--a woman came up and kissed me. I swear I\ndidn’t kiss her.”\n\nThere was a pause, filled by Stalky’s long, liquid whistle of contempt,\namazement, and derision.\n\n“On my honor,” gulped the persecuted one. “Oh, do stop him jawing.”\n\n“Very good,” McTurk interjected. “We are compelled, of course, to accept\nyour statement.”\n\n“Confound it!” roared Naughten. “You aren’t head-prefect here, McTurk.”\n\n“Oh, well,” returned the Irishman, “you know Tulke better than we do. I\nam only speaking for ourselves. _We_ accept Tulke’s word. But all I can\nsay is that if I’d been collared in a similarly disgustin’ situation,\nand had offered the same explanation Tulke has, I--I wonder what you’d\nhave said. However, it seems on Tulke’s word of honor--”\n\n“And Tulkus--beg pardon--_kiss_, of course---Tulkiss is an honorable\nman,” put in Stalky.\n\n“--that the Sixth can’t protect ‘emselves from bein’ kissed when they\ngo for a walk!” cried Beetle, taking up the running with a rush. “Sweet\nbusiness, isn’t it? Cheerful thing to tell the fags, ain’t it? We aren’t\nprefects, of course, but we aren’t kissed very much. Don’t think that\nsort of thing ever enters our heads; does it, Stalky?”\n\n“Oh, no!” said Stalky, turning aside to hide his emotions. McTurk’s face\nmerely expressed lofty contempt and a little weariness.\n\n“Well, you seem to know a lot about it,” interposed a prefect.\n\n“Can’t help it--when you chaps shove it under our noses.” Beetle dropped\ninto a drawling parody of King’s most biting colloquial style--the\ngentle rain after the thunder-storm. “Well, it’s all very sufficiently\nvile and disgraceful, isn’t it? I don’t know who comes out of it\nworst: Tulke, who happens to have been caught; or the other fellows who\nhaven’t. And we--” here he wheeled fiercely on the other two--“we’ve\ngot to stand up and be jawed by them because we’ve disturbed their\nintrigues.”\n\n“Hang it! I only wanted to give you a word of warning,” said Carson,\nthereby handing himself bound to the enemy.\n\n“Warn? You?” This with the air of one who finds loathsome gifts in his\nlocker. “Carson, would you be good enough to tell us what conceivable\nthing there is that you are entitled to warn us about after this\nexposure? Warn? Oh, it’s a little too much! Let’s go somewhere where\nit’s clean.”\n\nThe door banged behind their outraged innocence.\n\n“Oh, Beetle! Beetle! Beetle! Golden Beetle!” sobbed Stalky, hurling\nhimself on Beetle’s panting bosom as soon as they reached the study.\n“However did you do it?”\n\n“Dear-r man” said McTurk, embracing Beetle’s head with both arms, while\nhe swayed it to and fro on the neck, in time to this ancient burden--\n\n   “Pretty lips--sweeter than--cherry or plum.\n   Always look--jolly and--never look glum;\n   Seem to say--Come away. Kissy!--come, come!\n   Yummy-yum! Yummy-yum! Yummy-yum-yum!”\n\n“Look out. You’ll smash my gig-lamps,” puffed Beetle, emerging. “Wasn’t\nit glorious? Didn’t I ‘Eric’ ‘em splendidly? Did you spot my cribs\nfrom King? Oh, blow!” His countenance clouded. “There’s one adjective\nI didn’t use--obscene. Don’t know how I forgot that. It’s one of King’s\npet ones, too.”\n\n“Never mind. They’ll be sendin’ ambassadors round in half a shake to\nbeg us not to tell the school. It’s a deuced serious business for them,”\n said McTurk. “Poor Sixth--poor old Sixth!”\n\n“Immoral young rips,” Stalky snorted. “What an example to pure-souled\nboys like you and me!”\n\nAnd the Sixth in Carson’s study sat aghast, glowering at Tulke, who was\non the edge of tears. “Well,” said the head-prefect acidly. “You’ve made\na pretty average ghastly mess of it, Tulke.”\n\n“Why--why didn’t you lick that young devil Beetle before he began\njawing?” Tulke wailed.\n\n“I knew there’d be a row,” said a prefect of Prout’s house. “But you\nwould insist on the meeting, Tulke.”\n\n“Yes, and a fat lot of good it’s done us,” said Naughten. “They come in\nhere and jaw our heads off when we ought to be jawin’ them. Beetle talks\nto us as if we were a lot of blackguards and--and all that. And\nwhen they’ve hung us up to dry, they go out and slam the door like a\nhouse-master. All your fault, Tulke.”\n\n“But I didn’t kiss her.”\n\n“You ass! If you’d said you _had_ and stuck to it, it would have been\nten times better than what you did,” Naughten retorted. “Now they’ll\ntell the whole school--and Beetle’ll make up a lot of beastly rhymes and\nnick-names.”\n\n“But, hang it, she kissed me!” Outside of his work, Tulke’s mind moved\nslowly.\n\n“I’m not thinking of you. I’m thinking of us. I’ll go up to their study\nand see if I can make ‘em keep quiet!”\n\n“Tulke’s awf’ly cut up about this business,” Naughten began,\ningratiatingly, when he found Beetle.\n\n“Who’s kissed him this time?”\n\n“--and I’ve come to ask you chaps, and especially you, Beetle, not to\nlet the thing be known all over the school. Of course, fellows as senior\nas you are can easily see why.”\n\n“Um!” said Beetle, with the cold reluctance of one who foresees an\nunpleasant public duty. “I suppose I must go and talk to the Sixth\nagain.”\n\n“Not the least need, my dear chap, I assure you,” said Naughten hastily.\n“I’ll take any message you care to send.”\n\nBut the chance of supplying the missing adjective was too tempting. So\nNaughten returned to that still undissolved meeting, Beetle, white, icy,\nand aloof, at his heels.\n\n“There seems,” he began, with laboriously crisp articulation, “there\nseems to be a certain amount of uneasiness among you as to the steps\nwe may think fit to take in regard to this last revelation of\nthe--ah--obscene. If it is any consolation to you to know that we have\ndecided--for the honor of the school, you understand--to keep our mouths\nshut as to these--ah--obscenities, you--ah--have it.”\n\nHe wheeled, his head among the stars, and strode statelily back to his\nstudy, where Stalky and McTurk lay side by side upon the table wiping\ntheir tearful eyes--too weak to move.\n\n\nThe Latin prose paper was a success beyond their wildest dreams.\nStalky and McTurk were, of course, out of all examinations (they did\nextra-tuition with the Head), but Beetle attended with zeal.\n\n“This, I presume, is a par-ergon on your part,” said King, as he dealt\nout the papers. “One final exhibition ere you are translated to loftier\nspheres? A last attack on the classics? It seems to confound you\nalready.”\n\nBeetle studied the print with knit brows. “I can’t make head or tail of\nit,” he murmured. “What does it mean?”\n\n“No, no!” said King, with scholastic coquetry. “We depend upon you\nto give us the meaning. This is an examination, Beetle mine, not a\nguessing-competition. You will find your associates have no difficulty\nin--”\n\nTulke left his place and laid the paper on the desk. King looked, read,\nand turned a ghastly green.\n\n“Stalky’s missing a heap,” thought Beetle. “Wonder how King’ll get out\nof it!”\n\n“There seems,” King began with a gulp, “a certain modicum of truth\nin our Beetle’s remark. I am--er--inclined to believe that the worthy\nRandall must have dropped this in ferule--if you know what that means.\nBeetle, you purport to be an editor. Perhaps you can enlighten the form\nas to formes.”\n\n“What, sir! Whose form! I don’t see that there’s any verb in this\nsentence at all, an’--an’--the Ode is all different, somehow.”\n\n“I was about to say, before you volunteered your criticism, that an\naccident must have befallen the paper in type, and that the printer\nreset it by the light of nature. No--” he held the thing at arm’s\nlength--“our Randall is not an authority on Cicero or Horace.”\n\n“Rather mean to shove it off on Randall,” whispered Beetle to his\nneighbor. “King must ha’ been as screwed as an owl when he wrote it\nout.”\n\n“But we can amend the error by dictating it.”\n\n“No, sir.” The answer came pat from a dozen throats at once. “That cuts\nthe time for the exam. Only two hours allowed, sir. ‘Tisn’t fair. It’s\na printed-paper exam. How’re we goin’ to be marked for it! It’s all\nRandall’s fault. It isn’t our fault, anyhow. An exam.’s an exam.,” etc.,\netc.\n\nNaturally Mr. King considered this was an attempt to undermine his\nauthority, and, instead of beginning dictation at once, delivered a\nlecture on the spirit in which examinations should be approached. As the\nstorm subsided, Beetle fanned it afresh.\n\n“Eh? What? What was that you were saying to MacLagan?”\n\n“I only said I thought the papers ought to have been looked at before\nthey were given out, sir.”\n\n“Hear, hear!” from a back bench. Mr. King wished to know whether Beetle\ntook it upon himself personally to conduct the traditions of the school.\nHis zeal for knowledge ate up another fifteen minutes, during which the\nprefects showed unmistakable signs of boredom.\n\n“Oh, it was a giddy time,” said Beetle, afterwards, in dismantled Number\nFive. “He gibbered a bit, and I kept him on the gibber, and then he\ndictated about a half of Dolabella & Co.”\n\n“Good old Dolabella! Friend of mine. Yes?” said Stalky, pensively.\n\n“Then we had to ask him how every other word was spelt, of course, and\nhe gibbered a lot more. He cursed me and MacLagan (Mac played up like a\ntrump) and Randall, and the ‘materialized ignorance of the unscholarly\nmiddle classes,’ ‘lust for mere marks,’ and all the rest. It was what\nyou might call a final exhibition--a last attack--a giddy par-ergon.”\n\n“But o’ course he was blind squiffy when he wrote the paper. I hope you\nexplained that?” said Stalky.\n\n“Oh, yes. I told Tulke so. I said an immoral prefect an’ a drunken\nhouse-master were legitimate inferences. Tulke nearly blubbed. He’s\nawfully shy of us since Mary’s time.”\n\nTulke preserved that modesty till the last moment--till the\njourney-money had been paid, and the boys were filling the brakes that\ntook them to the station. Then the three tenderly constrained him to\nwait a while.\n\n“You see, Tulke, you may be a prefect,” said Stalky, “but I’ve left the\nColl. Do you see, Tulke, dear?”\n\n“Yes, I see. Don’t bear malice, Stalky.”\n\n“Stalky? Curse your impudence, you young cub,” shouted Stalky,\nmagnificent in top-hat, stiff collar, spats, and high-waisted,\nsnuff-colored ulster. “I want you to understand that _I’m_ Mister\nCorkran, an’ you’re a dirty little schoolboy.”\n\n“Besides bein’ frabjously immoral,” said McTurk. “Wonder you aren’t\nashamed to foist your company on pure-minded boys like us.”\n\n“Come on, Tulke,’ cried Naughten, from the prefects’ brake.\n\n“Yes, we’re comin’. Shove up and make room, you Collegers. You’ve all\ngot to be back next term, with your ‘Yes, sir,’ and ‘Oh, sir,’ an’ ‘No\nsir’ an’ ‘Please sir’; but before we say good-by we’re going to tell you\na little story. Go on, Dickie” (this to the driver); “we’re quite ready.\nKick that hat-box under the seat, an’ don’t crowd your Uncle Stalky.”\n\n“As nice a lot of high-minded youngsters as you’d wish to see,” said\nMcTurk, gazing round with bland patronage. “A trifle immoral, but\nthen--boys will be boys. It’s no good tryin’ to look stuffy, Carson.\n_Mister_ Corkran will now oblige with the story of Tulke an’ Mary Yeo!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. SLAVES OF THE LAMP. Part II.\n\n\nThat very Infant who told the story of the capture of Boh Na Ghee\n[_A Conference_ _of the Powers_: “Many Inventions”] to Eustace Cleaver,\nnovelist, inherited an estateful baronetcy, with vast revenues, resigned\nthe service, and became a landholder, while his mother stood guard over\nhim to see that he married the right girl. But, new to his position, he\npresented the local volunteers with a full-sized magazine-rifle range,\ntwo miles long, across the heart of his estate, and the surrounding\nfamilies, who lived in savage seclusion among woods full of pheasants,\nregarded him as an erring maniac. The noise of the firing disturbed\ntheir poultry, and Infant was cast out from the society of J.P.’s and\ndecent men till such time as a daughter of the county might lure him\nback to right thinking. He took his revenge by filling the house\nwith choice selections of old schoolmates home on leave--affable\ndetrimentals, at whom the bicycle-riding maidens of the surrounding\nfamilies were allowed to look from afar. I knew when a troop-ship was in\nport by the Infant’s invitations. Sometimes he would produce old friends\nof equal seniority; at others, young and blushing giants whom I had left\nsmall fags far down in the Lower Second; and to these Infant and the\nelders expounded the whole duty of man in the Army.\n\n“I’ve had to cut the service,” said the Infant; “but that’s no reason\nwhy my vast stores of experience should be lost to posterity.” He was\njust thirty, and in that same summer an imperious wire drew me to his\nbaronial castle: “Got good haul; ex _Tamar_. Come along.”\n\nIt was an unusually good haul, arranged with a single eye to my benefit.\nThere was a baldish, broken-down captain of Native Infantry, shivering\nwith ague behind an indomitable red nose--and they called him Captain\nDickson. There was another captain, also of Native Infantry, with a fair\nmustache; his face was like white glass, and his hands were fragile, but\nhe answered joyfully to the cry of Tertius. There was an enormously\nbig and well-kept man, who had evidently not campaigned for years,\nclean-shaved, soft-voiced, and cat-like, but still Abanazar for all that\nhe adorned the Indian Political Service; and there was a lean Irishman,\nhis face tanned blue-black with the suns of the Telegraph Department.\nLuckily the baize doors of the bachelors’ wing fitted tight, for we\ndressed promiscuously in the corridor or in each other’s rooms, talking,\ncalling, shouting, and anon waltzing by pairs to songs of Dick Four’s\nown devising.\n\nThere were sixty years of mixed work to be sifted out between us,\nand since we had met one another from time to time in the quick\nscene-shifting of India--a dinner, camp, or a race-meeting here; a\ndak-bungalow or railway station up country somewhere else--we had never\nquite lost touch. Infant sat on the banisters, hungrily and enviously\ndrinking it in. He enjoyed his baronetcy, but his heart yearned for the\nold days.\n\nIt was a cheerful babel of matters personal, provincial, and imperial,\npieces of old call-over lists, and new policies, cut short by the roar\nof a Burmese gong, and we went down not less than a quarter of a mile of\nstairs to meet Infant’s mother, who had known us all in our school-days\nand greeted us as if those had ended a week ago. But it was\nfifteen years since, with tears of laughter, she had lent me a gray\nprincess-skirt for amateur theatricals.\n\nThat was a dinner from the “Arabian Nights,” served in an eighty-foot\nhall full of ancestors and pots of flowering roses, and, what was more\nimpressive, heated by steam. When it was ended and the little mother had\ngone away--(“You boys want to talk, so I shall say good-night now”)--we\ngathered about an apple-wood fire, in a gigantic polished steel grate,\nunder a mantel-piece ten feet high, and the Infant compassed us about\nwith curious liqueurs and that kind of cigarette which serves best to\nintroduce your own pipe.\n\n“Oh, bliss!” grunted Dick Four from a sofa, where he had been packed\nwith a rug over him. “First time I’ve been warm since I came home.”\n\nWe were all nearly on top of the fire, except Infant, who had been long\nenough at home to take exercise when he felt chilled. This is a grisly\ndiversion, but much affected by the English of the Island.\n\n“If you say a word about cold tubs and brisk walks,” drawled McTurk,\n“I’ll kill you, Infant. I’ve got a liver, too. ‘Member when we used\nto think it a treat to turn out of our beds on a Sunday\nmorning--thermometer fifty-seven degrees if it was summer--and bathe off\nthe Pebbleridge? Ugh!”\n\n“‘Thing I don’t understand,” said Tertius, “was the way we chaps used to\ngo down into the lavatories, boil ourselves pink, and then come up with\nall our pores open into a young snow-storm or a black frost. Yet none of\nour chaps died, that I can remember.”\n\n“Talkin’ of baths,” said McTurk, with a chuckle, “‘member our bath in\nNumber Five, Beetle, the night Rabbits-Eggs rocked King? What wouldn’t\nI give to see old Stalky now! He is the only one of the two Studies not\nhere.”\n\n“Stalky is the great man of his Century,” said Dick Four.\n\n“How d’you know?” I asked.\n\n“How do I know?” said Dick Four, scornfully. “If you’ve ever been in a\ntight place with Stalky you wouldn’t ask.”\n\n“I haven’t seen him since the camp at Pindi in ‘87,” I said. “He was\ngoin’ strong then--about seven feet high and four feet through.”\n\n“Adequate chap. Infernally adequate,” said Tertius, pulling his mustache\nand staring into the fire.\n\n“Got dam’ near court-martialed and broke in Egypt in ‘84,” the Infant\nvolunteered. “I went out in the same trooper with him--as raw as he was.\nOnly _I_ showed it, and Stalky didn’t.”\n\n“What was the trouble?” said McTurk, reaching forward absently to twitch\nmy dress-tie into position.\n\n“Oh, nothing. His colonel trusted him to take twenty Tommies out to\nwash, or groom camels, or something at the back of Suakin, and Stalky\ngot embroiled with Fuzzies five miles in the interior. He conducted a\nmasterly retreat and wiped up eight of ‘em. He knew jolly well he’d\nno right to go out so far, so he took the initiative and pitched in a\nletter to his colonel, who was frothing at the mouth, complaining of the\n‘paucity of support accorded to him in his operations.’ Gad, it might\nhave been one fat brigadier slangin’ another! Then he went into the\nStaff Corps.”\n\n“That--is--entirely--Stalky,” said Abanazar from his arm-chair.\n\n“You’ve come across him, too?” I said.\n\n“Oh, yes,” he replied in his softest tones. “I was at the tail of\nthat--that epic. Don’t you chaps know?”\n\nWe did not--Infant, McTurk, and I; and we called for information very\npolitely.\n\n“‘Twasn’t anything,” said Tertius. “We got into a mess up in the\nKhye-Kheen Hills a couple o’ years ago, and Stalky pulled us through.\nThat’s all.”\n\nMcTurk gazed at Tertius with all an Irishman’s contempt for the\ntongue-tied Saxon.\n\n“Heavens!” he said. “And it’s you and your likes govern Ireland.\nTertius, aren’t you ashamed?”\n\n“Well, I can’t tell a yarn. I can chip in when the other fellow starts\n_bukhing_. Ask him.” He pointed to Dick Four, whose nose gleamed\nscornfully over the rug.\n\n“I knew you wouldn’t,” said Dick Four. “Give me a whiskey and soda. I’ve\nbeen drinking lemon-squash and ammoniated quinine while you chaps were\nbathin’ in champagne, and my head’s singin’ like a top.”\n\nHe wiped his ragged mustache above the drink; and, his teeth chattering\nin his head, began: “You know the Khye-Kheen-Malot expedition, when\nwe scared the souls out of ‘em with a field force they daren’t fight\nagainst? Well, both tribes--there was a coalition against us--came in\nwithout firing a shot; and a lot of hairy villains, who had no more\npower over their men than I had, promised and vowed all sorts of things.\nOn that very slender evidence, Pussy dear--”\n\n“I was at Simla,” said Abanazar, hastily.\n\n“Never mind, you’re tarred with the same brush. On the strength of\nthose tuppenny-ha’penny treaties, your asses of Politicals reported the\ncountry as pacified, and the Government, being a fool, as usual, began\nroad-makin’--dependin’ on local supply for labor. ‘Member _that_, Pussy?\n‘Rest of our chaps who’d had no look-in during the campaign didn’t think\nthere’d be any more of it, and were anxious to get back to India. But\nI’d been in two of these little rows before, and I had my suspicions.\nI engineered myself, _summa ingenio_, into command of a road-patrol--no\nshovellin’, only marching up and down genteelly with a guard. They’d\nwithdrawn all the troops they could, but I nucleused about forty\nPathans, recruits chiefly, of my regiment, and sat tight at the\nbase-camp while the road-parties went to work, as per Political survey.”\n\n“Had some rippin’ sing-songs in camp, too,” said Tertius.\n\n“My pup”--thus did Dick Four refer to his subaltern--“was a pious\nlittle beast. He didn’t like the sing-songs, and so he went down with\npneumonia. I rootled round the camp, and found Tertius gassing about as\na D.A.Q.M.G., which, God knows, he isn’t cut out for. There were six\nor eight of the old Coll. at base-camp (we’re always in force for a\nfrontier row), but I’d heard of Tertius as a steady old hack, and I told\nhim he had to shake off his D.A.Q.M.G. breeches and help _me_. Tertius\nvolunteered like a shot, and we settled it with the authorities, and out\nwe went--forty Pathans, Tertius, and me, looking up the road-parties.\nMacnamara’s--‘member old Mac, the Sapper, who played the fiddle so\ndamnably at Umballa?--Mac’s party was the last but one. The last was\nStalky’s. He was at the head of the road with some of his pet Sikhs. Mac\nsaid he believed he was all right.”\n\n“Stalky _is_ a Sikh,” said Tertius. “He takes his men to pray at the\nDurbar Sahib at Amritzar, regularly as clockwork, when he can.”\n\n“Don’t interrupt, Tertius. It was about forty miles beyond Mac’s before\nI found him; and my men pointed out gently, but firmly, that the country\nwas risin’. What kind o’ country, Beetle? Well, _I_‘m no word-painter,\nthank goodness, but _you_ might call it a hellish country! When we\nweren’t up to our necks in snow, we were rolling down the khud. The\nwell-disposed inhabitants, who were to supply labor for the road-making\n(don’t forget that, Pussy dear), sat behind rocks and took pot-shots\nat us. ‘Old, old story! We all legged it in search of Stalky. I had a\nfeeling that he’d be in good cover, and about dusk we found him and his\nroad-party, as snug as a bug in a rug, in an old Malot stone fort, with\na watch-tower at one corner. It overhung the road they had blasted\nout of the cliff fifty feet below; and under the road things went down\npretty sheer, for five or six hundred feet, into a gorge about half a\nmile wide and two or three miles long. There were chaps on the other\nside of the gorge scientifically gettin’ our range. So I hammered on\nthe gate and nipped in, and tripped over Stalky in a greasy, bloody old\nposhteen, squatting on the ground, eating with his men. I’d only seen\nhim for half a minute about three months before, but I might have met\nhim yesterday. He waved his hand all sereno.\n\n“‘Hullo, Aladdin! Hullo, Emperor!’ he said. ‘You’re just in time for the\nperformance.’”\n\n“I saw his Sikhs looked a bit battered. ‘Where’s your command? Where’s\nyour subaltern?’ I said.\n\n“‘Here--all there is of it,’ said Stalky. ‘If you want young Everett,\nhe’s dead, and his body’s in the watch-tower. They rushed our road-party\nlast week, and got him and seven men. We’ve been besieged for five days.\nI suppose they let you through to make sure of you. The whole country’s\nup. ‘Strikes me you’ve walked into a first-class trap.’ He grinned, but\nneither Tertius nor I could see where the deuce the fun was. We hadn’t\nany grub for our men, and Stalky had only four days’ whack for his. That\ncame of dependin’ upon your asinine Politicals, Pussy dear, who told us\nthat the inhabitants were friendly.\n\n“To make us _quite_ comfy, Stalky took us up to the watch-tower to see\npoor Everett’s body, lyin’ in a foot o’ drifted snow. It looked like a\ngirl of fifteen--not a hair on the little fellow’s face. He’d been shot\nthrough the temple, but the Malots had left their mark on him. Stalky\nunbuttoned the tunic, and showed it to us--a rummy sickle-shaped cut on\nthe chest. ‘Member the snow all white on his eyebrows, Tertius? ‘Member\nwhen Stalky moved the lamp and it looked as if he was alive?”\n\n“Ye-es,” said Tertius, with a shudder. “‘Member the beastly look on\nStalky’s face, though, with his nostrils all blown out, same as he used\nto look when he was bullyin’ a fag? That was a lovely evening.”\n\n“We held a council of war up there over Everett’s body. Stalky said the\nMalots and Khye-Kheens were up together; havin’ sunk their blood feuds\nto settle us. The chaps we’d seen across the gorge were Khye-Kheens. It\nwas about half a mile from them to us as a bullet flies, and they’d made\na line of sungars under the brow of the hill to sleep in and starve us\nout. The Malots, he said, were in front of us promiscuous. There wasn’t\ngood cover behind the fort, or they’d have been there, too. Stalky\ndidn’t mind the Malots half as much as he did the Khye-Kheens. He said\nthe Malots were treacherous curs. What I couldn’t understand was, why\nin the world the two gangs didn’t join in and rush us. There must have\nbeen at least five hundred of ‘em. Stalky said they didn’t trust each\nother very well, because they were ancestral enemies when they were\nat home; and the only time they’d tried a rush he’d hove a couple of\nblasting-charges among ‘em, and that had sickened ‘em a bit.\n\n“It was dark by the time we finished, and Stalky, always serene, said:\n‘You command now. I don’t suppose you mind my taking any action I may\nconsider necessary to reprovision the fort?’ I said, ‘Of course not,’\nand then the lamp blew out. So Tertius and I had to climb down the tower\nsteps (we didn’t want to stay with Everett) and got back to our men.\nStalky had gone off--to count the stores, I supposed. Anyhow, Tertius\nand I sat up in case of a rush (they were plugging at us pretty\ngenerally, you know), relieving each other till the mornin’.\n\n“Mornin’ came. No Stalky. Not a sign of him. I took counsel with his\nsenior native officer--a grand, white-whiskered old chap--Rutton Singh,\nfrom Jullunder-way. He only grinned, and said it was all right. Stalky\nhad been out of the fort twice before, somewhere or other, accordin’ to\nhim. He said Stalky ‘ud come back unchipped, and gave me to understand\nthat Stalky was an invulnerable _Guru_ of sorts. All the same, I put the\nwhole command on half rations, and set ‘em to pickin’ out loopholes.\n\n“About noon there was no end of a snow-storm, and the enemy stopped\nfiring. We replied gingerly, because we were awfully short of\nammunition. Don’t suppose we fired five shots an hour, but we generally\ngot our man. Well, while I was talking with Rutton Singh I saw Stalky\ncoming down from the watch-tower, rather puffy about the eyes, his\nposhteen coated with claret-colored ice.\n\n“‘No trustin’ these snow-storms,’ he said. ‘Nip out quick and snaffle\nwhat you can get. There’s a certain amount of friction between the\nKhye-Kheens and the Malots just now.’\n\n“I turned Tertius out with twenty Pathans, and they bucked about in the\nsnow for a bit till they came on to a sort of camp about eight hundred\nyards away, with only a few men in charge and half a dozen sheep by\nthe fire. They finished off the men, and snaffled the sheep and as much\ngrain as they could carry, and came back. No one fired a shot at ‘em.\nThere didn’t seem to be anybody about, but the snow was falling pretty\nthick.\n\n“‘That’s good enough,’ said Stalky when we got dinner ready and he was\nchewin’ mutton-kababs off a cleanin’ rod. ‘There’s no sense riskin’ men.\nThey’re holding a pow-wow between the Khye-Kheens and the Malots at\nthe head of the gorge. I don’t think these so-called coalitions are much\ngood.’\n\n“Do you know what that maniac had done? Tertius and I shook it out of\nhim by instalments. There was an underground granary cellar-room below\nthe watch-tower, and in blasting the road Stalky had blown a hole into\none side of it. Being no one else _but_ Stalky, he’d kept the hole open\nfor his own ends; and laid poor Everett’s body slap over the well of the\nstairs that led down to it from the watch-tower. He’d had to move and\nreplace the corpse every time he used the passage. The Sikhs wouldn’t go\nnear the place, of course. Well, he’d got out of this hole, and dropped\non to the road. Then, in the night _and_ a howling snow-storm, he’d\ndropped over the edge of the khud, made his way down to the bottom of\nthe gorge, forded the nullah, which was half frozen, climbed up on the\nother side along a track he’d discovered, and come out on the right\nflank of the Khye-Kheens. He had then--listen to this!--crossed over a\nridge that paralleled their rear, walked half a mile behind that, and\ncome out on the left of their line where the gorge gets shallow and\nwhere there was a regular track between the Malot and the Khye-Kheen\ncamps. That was about two in the morning, and, as it turned out, a man\nspotted him--a Khye-Kheen. So Stalky abolished him quietly, and left\nhim--_with_ the Malot mark on his chest, same as Everett had.\n\n“‘I was just as economical as I could be,’ Stalky said to us. ‘If he’d\nshouted I should have been slain. I’d never had to do that kind of thing\nbut once before, and that was the first time I tried that path. It’s\nperfectly practicable for infantry, you know.’\n\n“‘What about your first man?’ I said.\n\n“‘Oh, that was the night after they killed Everett, and I went out\nlookin’ for a line of retreat for my men. A man found me. I abolished\nhim--_privatim_--scragged him. But on thinkin’ it over it occurred to\nme that if I could find the body (I’d hove it down some rocks) I might\ndecorate it with the Malot mark and leave it to the Khye-Kheens to draw\ninferences. So I went out again the next night and did. The Khye-Kheens\nare shocked at the Malots perpetratin’ these two dastardly outrages\nafter they’d sworn to sink all bleed feuds. I lay up behind their\nsungars early this morning and watched ‘em. They all went to confer\nabout it at the head of the gorge. Awf’ly annoyed they are. Don’t\nwonder.’ You know the way Stalky drops out his words, one by one.”\n\n“My God!” said the Infant, explosively, as the full depth of the\nstrategy dawned on him.\n\n“Dear-r man!” said McTurk, purring rapturously.\n\n“Stalky stalked,” said Tertius. “That’s all there is to it.”\n\n“No, he didn’t,” said Dick Four. “Don’t you remember how he insisted\nthat he had only applied his luck? Don’t you remember how Rutton Singh\ngrabbed his boots and grovelled in the snow, and how our men shouted?”\n\n“None of our Pathans believed that was luck,” said Tertius. “They swore\nStalky ought to have been born a Pathan, and--‘member we nearly had a\nrow in the fort when Rutton Singh said Stalky was a Pathan? Gad, how\nfurious the old chap was with my Jemadar! But Stalky just waggled his\nfinger and they shut up.\n\n“Old Rutton Singh’s sword was half out, though, and he swore he’d\ncremate every Khye-Kheen and Malot he killed. That made the Jemadar\npretty wild, because he didn’t mind fighting against his own creed, but\nhe wasn’t going to crab a fellow Mussulman’s chances of Paradise. Then\nStalky jabbered Pushtu and Punjabi in alternate streaks. Where the deuce\ndid he pick up his Pushtu from, Beetle?”\n\n“Never mind his language, Dick,” said I. “Give us the gist of it.”\n\n“I flatter myself I can address the wily Pathan on occasion, but, hang\nit all, I can’t make puns in Pushtu, or top off my arguments with a\nsmutty story, as he did. He played on those two old dogs o’ war like\na--like a concertina. Stalky said--and the other two backed up his\nknowledge of Oriental nature--that the Khye-Kheens and the Malots\nbetween ‘em would organize a combined attack on us that night, as\na proof of good faith. They wouldn’t drive it home, though, because\nneither side would trust the other on account, as Rutton Singh put it,\nof the little accidents. Stalky’s notion was to crawl out at dusk with\nhis Sikhs, manoeuvre ‘em along this ungodly goat-track that he’d found,\nto the back of the Khye-Kheen position, and then lob in a few long shots\nat the Malots when the attack was well on. ‘That’ll divert their minds\nand help to agitate ‘em,’ he said. ‘Then you chaps can come out and\nsweep up the pieces, and we’ll rendezvous at the head of the gorge.\nAfter that, I move we get back to Mac’s camp and have something to eat.”\n\n“_You_ were commandin’?” the Infant suggested.\n\n“I was about three months senior to Stalky, and two months Tertius’s\nsenior,” Dick Four replied. “_But_ we were all from the same old Coll.\nI should say ours was the only little affair on record where some one\nwasn’t jealous of some one else.”\n\n“_We_ weren’t,” Tertius broke in, “but there was another row between Gul\nSher Khan and Rutton Singh. Our Jemadar said--he was quite right--that\nno Sikh living could stalk worth a damn; and that Koran Sahib had better\ntake out the Pathans, who understood that kind of mountain work. Rutton\nSingh said that Koran Sahib jolly well knew every Pathan was a born\ndeserter, and every Sikh was a gentleman, even if he couldn’t crawl on\nhis belly. Stalky struck in with some woman’s proverb or other, that had\nthe effect of doublin’ both men up with a grin. He said the Sikhs and\nthe Pathans could settle their claims on the Khye-Kheens and\nMalots later on, but he was going to take his Sikhs along for this\nmountain-climbing job, because Sikhs could shoot. They can, too. Give\n‘em a mule-load of ammunition apiece, and they’re perfectly happy.”\n\n“And out he gat,” said Dick Four. “As soon as it was dark, and he’d had\na bit of a snooze, him and thirty Sikhs went down through the staircase\nin the tower, every mother’s son of ‘em salutin’ little Everett where\nIt stood propped up against the wall. The last I heard him say was,\n‘Kubbadar! tumbleinga! [Look out; you’ll fall!] and they tumbleingaed\nover the black edge of nothing. Close upon 9 p.m. the combined attack\ndeveloped; Khye-Kheens across the valley, and Malots in front of us,\npluggin’ at long range and yellin’ to each other to come along and cut\nour infidel throats. Then they skirmished up to the gate, and began the\nold game of calling our Pathans renegades, and invitin’ ‘em to join the\nholy war. One of our men, a young fellow from Dera Ismail, jumped on\nthe wall to slang ‘em back, and jumped down, blubbing like a child. He’d\nbeen hit smack in the middle of the hand. ‘Never saw a man yet who could\nstand a hit in the hand without weepin’ bitterly. It tickles up all the\nnerves. So Tertius took his rifle and smote the others on the head to\nkeep them quiet at the loopholes. The dear children wanted to open the\ngate and go in at ‘em generally, but that didn’t suit our book.\n\n“At last, near midnight, I heard the wop, wop, wop, of Stalky’s Martinis\nacross the valley, and some general cursing among the Malots, whose\nmain body was hid from us by a fold in the hillside. Stalky was brownin’\n‘em at a great rate, and very naturally they turned half right and began\nto blaze at their faithless allies, the Khye-Kheens--regular volley\nfirin’. In less than ten minutes after Stalky opened the diversion they\nwere going it hammer and tongs, both sides the valley. When we could\nsee, the valley was rather a mixed-up affair. The Khye-Kheens had\nstreamed out of their sungars above the gorge to chastise the Malots,\nand Stalky--I was watching him through my glasses--had slipped in behind\n‘em. Very good. The Khye-Kheens had to leg it along the hillside up to\nwhere the gorge got shallow and they could cross over to the Malots,\nwho were awfully cheered to see the Khye-Kheens taken in the rear.\n\n“Then it occurred to me to comfort the Khye-Kheens. So I turned out the\nwhole command, and we advanced _a’ la pas de charge_, doublin’ up what,\nfor the sake of argument, we’ll call the Malots’ left flank. Even then,\nif they’d sunk their differences, they could have eaten us alive;\nbut they’d been firin’ at each other half the night, and they went on\nfirin’. Queerest thing you ever saw in your born days! As soon as our\nmen doubled up to the Malots, they’d blaze at the Khye-Kheens more\nzealously than ever, to show they were on our side, run up the valley\na few hundred yards, and halt to fire again. The moment Stalky saw our\ngame he duplicated it his side the gorge; and, by Jove! the Khye-Kheens\ndid just the same thing.”\n\n“Yes, but,” said Tertius, “you’ve forgot him playin’ ‘Arrah, Patsy, mind\nthe baby’ on the bugle to hurry us up.”\n\n“Did he?” roared McTurk. Somehow we all began to sing it, and there was\nan interruption.\n\n“Rather,” said Tertius, when we were quiet. No one of the Aladdin\ncompany could forget that tune. “Yes, he played ‘Patsy.’ Go on, Dick.”\n\n“Finally,” said Dick Four, “we drove both mobs into each other’s arms on\na bit of level ground at the head of the valley, and saw the whole crew\nwhirl off, fightin’ and stabbin’ and swearin’ in a blindin’ snow-storm.\nThey were a heavy, hairy lot, and we didn’t follow ‘em.\n\n“Stalky had captured one prisoner--an old pensioned Sepoy of twenty-five\nyears’ service, who produced his discharge--an awf’ly sportin’ old card.\nHe had been tryin’ to make his men rush us early in the day. He was\nsulky--angry with his own side for their cowardice, and Rutton Singh\nwanted to bayonet him--Sikhs don’t understand fightin’ against the\nGovernment after you’ve served it honestly--but Stalky rescued him, and\nfroze on to him tight--with ulterior motives, I believe. When we got\nback to the fort, we buried young Everett--Stalky wouldn’t hear of\nblowin’ up the place--and bunked. We’d only lost ten men, all told.”\n\n“Only ten, out of seventy. How did you lose ‘em?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, there was a rush on the fort early in the night, and a few Malots\ngot over the gate. It was rather a tight thing for a minute or two, but\nthe recruits took it beautifully. Lucky job we hadn’t any badly wounded\nmen to carry, because we had forty miles to Macnamara’s camp. By Jove,\nhow we legged it! Half way in, old Rutton Singh collapsed, so we slung\nhim across four rifles and Stalky’s overcoat; and Stalky, his prisoner,\nand a couple of Sikhs were his bearers. After that I went to sleep. You\ncan, you know, on the march, when your legs get properly numbed. Mac\nswears we all marched into his camp snoring and dropped where we halted.\nHis men lugged us into the tents like gram-bags. I remember wakin’ up\nand seeing Stalky asleep with his head on old Rutton Singh’s chest. _He_\nslept twenty-four hours. I only slept seventeen, but then I was coming\ndown with dysentery.”\n\n“Coming down? What rot! He had it on him before we joined Stalky in the\nfort,” said Tertius.\n\n“Well, _you_ needn’t talk! You hove your sword at Macnamara and demanded\na drum-head court-martial every time you saw him. The only thing that\nsoothed you was putting you under arrest every half hour. You were off\nyour head for three days.”\n\n“Don’t remember a word of it,” said Tertius, placidly. “I remember my\norderly giving me milk, though.”\n\n“How did Stalky come out?” McTurk demanded, purling hard over his pipe.\n\n“Stalky? Like a serene Brahmini bull. Poor old Mac was at his Royal\nEngineers’ wits’ end to know what to do. You see I was putrid with\ndysentery, Tertius was ravin’, half the men had frost-bite, and\nMacnamara’s orders were to break camp and come in before winter. So\nStalky, who hadn’t turned a hair, took half his supplies to save him\nthe bother o’ luggin’ ‘em back to the plains, and all the ammunition he\ncould get at, and, _consilio et auxilio_ Rutton Singhi, tramped back\nto his fort with all his Sikhs and his precious prisoners, and a lot of\ndissolute hangers-on that he and the prisoner had seduced into service.\nHe had sixty men of sorts--and his brazen cheek. Mac nearly wept with\njoy when he went. You see there weren’t any explicit orders to Stalky to\ncome in before the passes were blocked: Mac is a great man for orders,\nand Stalky’s a great man for orders--when they suit his book.”\n\n“He told me he was goin’ to the Engadine,” said Tertius. “Sat on my cot\nsmokin’ a cigarette, and makin’ me laugh till I cried. Macnamara bundled\nthe whole lot of us down to the plains next day. We were a walkin’\nhospital.”\n\n“Stalky told me that Macnamara was a simple godsend to him,” said Dick\nFour. “I used to see him in Mac’s tent listenin’ to Mac playin’ the\nfiddle, and, between the pieces, wheedlin’ Mac out of picks and shovels\nand dynamite cartridges hand-over-fist. Well, that was the last we saw\nof Stalky. A week or so later the passes were shut with snow, and I\ndon’t think Stalky wanted to be found particularly just then.”\n\n“He didn’t,” said the fair and fat Abanazar. “He didn’t. Ho, ho!”\n\nDick Four threw up his thin, dry hand with the blue veins at the back of\nit. “Hold on a minute, Pussy; I’ll let you in at the proper time. I went\ndown to my regiment, and that spring, five mouths later, I got off\nwith a couple of companies on detachment: nominally to look after some\nfriends of ours across the border; actually, of course, to recruit.\nIt was a bit unfortunate, because an ass of a young Naick carried a\nfrivolous blood-feud he’d inherited from his aunt into those hills, and\nthe local gentry wouldn’t volunteer into my corps. Of course, the Naick\nhad taken short leave to manage the business; that was all regular\nenough; _but_ he’d stalked my pet orderly’s uncle. It was an infernal\nshame, because I knew Harris of the Ghuznees would be covering that\nground three months later, and he’d snaffle all the chaps I had my eyes\non. Everybody was down on the Naick, because they felt he ought to\nhave had the decency to postpone his--his disgustful amours till our\ncompanies were full strength.\n\n“Still the beast had a certain amount of professional feeling left.\nHe sent one of his aunt’s clan by night to tell me that, if I’d take\nsafeguard, he’d put me on to a batch of beauties. I nipped over the\nborder like a shot, and about ten miles the other side, in a nullah,\nmy rapparee-in-charge showed me about seventy men variously armed, but\nstanding up like a Queen’s company. Then one of ‘em stepped out and\nlugged round an old bugle, just like--who’s the man?--Bancroft, ain’t\nit?--feeling for his eye-glass in a farce, and played ‘Arrah, Patsy,\nmind the baby. Arrah, Patsy, mind’--that was as for as he could get.”\n\nThat, also, was as far as Dick Four could get, because we had to sing\nthe old song through twice, again and once more, and subsequently, in\norder to repeat it.\n\n“He explained that if I knew the rest of the song he had a note for me\nfrom the man the song belonged to. Whereupon, my children, I finished\nthat old tune on that bugle, and _this_ is what I got. I knew you’d like\nto look at it. Don’t grab.” (We were all struggling for a sight of the\nwell-known unformed handwriting.) “I’ll read it aloud.\n\n     “‘Fort Everett, February 19.\n\n“‘Dear Dick, or Tertius: The bearer of this is in charge of seventy-five\nrecruits, all pukka devils, but desirous of leading new lives. They have\nbeen slightly polished, and after being boiled may shape well. I want\nyou to give thirty of them to my adjutant, who, though God’s own ass,\nwill need men this spring. The rest you can keep. You will be interested\nto learn that I have extended my road to the end of the Malot country.\nAll headmen and priests concerned in last September’s affair worked one\nmonth each, supplying road metal from their own houses. Everett’s grave\nis covered by a forty-foot mound, which should serve well as a base for\nfuture triangulations. Rutton Singh sends his best salaams. I am\nmaking some treaties, and have given my prisoner--who also sends his\nsalaams--local rank of Khan Bahadur.        “‘A. L. Cockran.’\n\n“Well, that was all,” said Dick Four, when the roaring, the shouting,\nthe laughter, and, I think, the tears, had subsided. “I chaperoned the\ngang across the border as quick as I could. They were rather homesick,\nbut they cheered up when they recognized some of my chaps, who had been\nin the Khye-Kheen row, and they made a rippin’ good lot. It’s rather\nmore than three hundred miles from Fort Everett to where I picked ‘em\nup. Now, Pussy, tell ‘em the latter end o’ Stalky as you saw it.”\n\nAbanazar laughed a little nervous, misleading, official laugh.\n\n“Oh, it wasn’t much. I was at Simla in the spring, when our Stalky, out\nof his snows, began corresponding direct with the Government.”\n\n“After the manner of a king,” suggested Dick Four. “My turn now,\nDick. He’d done a whole let of things he shouldn’t have done, and\nconstructively pledged the Government to all sorts of action.”\n\n“‘Pledged the State’s ticker, eh?” said McTurk, with a nod to me.\n\n“About that; but the embarrassin’ part was that it was all so thunderin’\nconvenient, so well reasoned, don’t you know? Came in as pat as if he’d\nhad access to all sorts of information--which he couldn’t, of course.”\n\n“Pooh!” said Tertius, “I back Stalky against the Foreign Office any\nday.”\n\n“He’d done pretty nearly everything he could think of, except strikin’\ncoins in his own image and superscription, all under cover of buildin’\nthis infernal road and bein’ blocked by the snow. His report was simply\namazin’. Von Lennaert tore his hair over it at first, and then he\ngasped, ‘Who the dooce is this unknown Warren Hastings? He must be\nslain. He must be slain officially! The Viceroy’ll never stand it. It’s\nunheard of. He must be slain by his Excellency in person. Order him up\nhere and pitch in a stinger.’ Well, I sent him no end of an official\nstinger, and I pitched in an unofficial telegram at the same time.”\n\n“You!” This with amazement from the Infant, for Abanazar resembled\nnothing so much as a fluffy Persian cat.\n\n“Yes--me,” said Abanazar. “‘Twasn’t much, but after what you’ve said,\nDicky, it was rather a coincidence, because I wired:\n\n   “‘Aladdin now has got his wife,\n   Your Emperor is appeased.\n   I think you’d better come to life:\n   We hope you’ve all been pleased.’\n\n“Funny how that old song came up in my head. That was fairly\nnon-committal and encouragin’. The only flaw was that his Emperor\nwasn’t appeased by very long chalks. Stalky extricated himself from his\nmountain fastnesses and leafed up to Simla at his leisure, to be offered\nup on the horns of the altar.”\n\n“But,” I began, “surely the Commander-in-Chief is the proper--”\n\n“His Excellency had an idea that if he blew up one single junior\ncaptain--same as King used to blow us up--he was holdin’ the reins\nof empire, and, of course, as long as he had that idea, Von Lennaert\nencouraged him. I’m not sure Von Lennaert didn’t put that notion into\nhis head.”\n\n“They’ve changed the breed, then, since my time,” I said.\n\n“P’r’aps. Stalky was sent up for his wiggin’ like a bad little boy. I’ve\nreason to believe that His Excellency’s hair stood on end. He walked\ninto Stalky for one hour--Stalky at attention in the middle of the\nfloor, and (so he vowed) Von Lennaert pretending to soothe down His\nExcellency’s topknot in dumb show in the background. Stalky didn’t dare\nto look up, or he’d have laughed.”\n\n“Now, wherefore was Stalky not broken publicly?” said the Infant, with a\nlarge and luminous leer.\n\n“Ah, wherefore?” said Abanazar. “To give him a chance to retrieve his\nblasted career, and not to break his father’s heart. Stalky hadn’t a\nfather, but that didn’t matter. He behaved like a--like the Sanawar\nOrphan Asylum, and His Excellency graciously spared him. Then he came\nround to my office and sat opposite me for ten minutes, puffing out his\nnostrils. Then he said, ‘Pussy, if I thought that basket-hanger--’”\n\n“Hah! He remembered that,” said McTurk.\n\n“‘That two-anna basket-hanger governed India, I swear I’d become a\nnaturalized Muscovite to-morrow. I’m a _femme incomprise_. This thing’s\nbroken my heart. It’ll take six months’ shootin’-leave in India to mend\nit. Do you think I can get it, Pussy?’\n\n“He got it in about three minutes and a half, and seventeen days later\nhe was back in the arms of Rutton Singh--horrid disgraced--with orders\nto hand over his command, etc., to Cathcart MacMonnie.”\n\n“Observe!” said Dick Four. “One colonel of the Political Department in\ncharge of thirty Sikhs, on a hilltop. Observe, my children!”\n\n“Naturally, Cathcart not being a fool, even if he _is_ a Political, let\nStalky do his shooting within fifteen miles of Fort Everett for the\nnext six months, and I always understood they and Rutton Singh and\nthe prisoner were as thick as thieves. Then Stalky loafed back to his\nregiment, I believe. I’ve never seen him since.”\n\n“I have, though,” said McTurk, swelling with pride.\n\nWe all turned as one man. “It was at the beginning of this hot weather.\nI was in camp in the Jullunder doab and stumbled slap on Stalky in\na Sikh village; sitting on the one chair of state, with half the\npopulation grovellin’ before him, a dozen Sikh babies on his knees,\nan old harridan clappin’ him on the shoulder, and a garland o’ flowers\nround his neck. Told me he was recruitin’. We dined together that night,\nbut he never said a word of the business at the Fort. Told me, though,\nthat if I wanted any supplies I’d better say I was Koran Sahib’s _bhai_;\nand I did, and the Sikhs wouldn’t take my money.”\n\n“Ah! That must have been one of Rutton Singh’s villages,” said Dick\nFour; and we smoked for some time in silence.\n\n“I say,” said McTurk, casting back through the years, “did Stalky ever\ntell you _how_ Rabbits-Eggs came to rock King that night?”\n\n“No,” said Dick Four. Then McTurk told. “I see,” said Dick Four,\nnodding. “Practically he duplicated that trick over again. There’s\nnobody like Stalky.”\n\n“That’s just where you make the mistake,” I said. “India’s full of\nStalkies--Cheltenham and Haileybury and Marlborough chaps--that we don’t\nknow anything about, and the surprises will begin when there is really a\nbig row on.”\n\n“Who will be surprised?” said Dick Four.\n\n“The other side. The gentlemen who go to the front in first-class\ncarriages. Just imagine Stalky let loose on the south side of Europe\nwith a sufficiency of Sikhs and a reasonable prospect of loot. Consider\nit quietly.”\n\n“There’s something in that, but you’re too much of an optimist, Beetle,”\n said the Infant.\n\n“Well, I’ve a right to be. Ain’t I responsible for the whole thing? You\nneedn’t laugh. Who wrote ‘Aladdin now has got his wife’--eh?”\n\n“What’s that got to do with it?” said Tertius.\n\n“Everything,” said I.\n\n“Prove it,” said the Infant.\n\nAnd I have.\n\n",
