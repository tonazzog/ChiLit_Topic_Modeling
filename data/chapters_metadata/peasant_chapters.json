THE LOVER IN THE WOOD.\n\nOne fine afternoon in April, 1770, there was a good deal of bustle in\nthe neighbourhood of the village of Saint Menehould, in the province of\nChampagne, in France.  The bride of the Dauphin of France,--the lady who\nwas to be queen when the present elderly king should die--was on her\njourney from Germany, and was to pass through Saint Menehould to Paris,\nwith her splendid train of nobles and gentry; and the whole country was\nalive with preparations to greet her loyally as she passed.  The houses\nof the village were cleaned and adorned; and gangs of labourers were at\nwork repairing the roads of the district;--not hired labourers, but\npeasants, who were obliged by law to quit the work of their own fields\nor kilns, when called upon, to repair the roads, for a certain number of\ndays.  These road-menders were not likely to be among the most hearty\nwelcomers of the Dauphiness; for they had been called off, some from\ntheir field-work, just at the time when the loss of a few days would\nprobably cause great damage to the crops;--and others from the charcoal\nworks, when their families could ill spare the small wages they gained\nat the kilns.  These forced labourers would willingly have given up\ntheir sight of the Dauphiness, if she would have gone to Paris by\nanother route, so that this road-mending might have been left to a more\nconvenient season.\n\nThe peasants round Saint Menehould were not all out upon the roads,\nhowever.  In the midst of a wood, a little to the north of the village,\nthe sound of a mallet might be heard by any traveller in the lane which\nled to the ponds, outside the estate of the Count de D--.\n\nThe workman who was so busy with his mallet was not a charcoal-burner;\nand the work he was doing was on his own account.  It was Charles\nBertrand, a young peasant well-known in the village, who had long been\nthe lover of Marie Randolphe, the pretty daughter of a tenant of the\nCount de D--.  When they were first engaged, everybody who knew them was\nglad, and said they would be a happy couple.  But their affairs did not\nlook more cheerful as time went on.  Charles toiled with all his might,\nand tried so earnestly to save money, that he did not allow himself\nsufficient food and rest, and was now almost as sallow and gaunt-looking\nas his older neighbours; and yet he could never get nearer to his object\nof obtaining a cottage and field to which he might take Marie home.\nMarie grew somewhat paler, and her face less pretty; for, besides her\nanxiety for her lover, she had hard living at home.  Her father and\nmother had her two young brothers to maintain, as well as themselves;\nand no toil, no efforts on the part of the family, could keep them above\nwant.  Their earnings were very small at the best; and these small gains\nwere so much lessened by the work her father was called out to do upon\nthe roads--and, of the money brought home, so much went to buy the\nquantity of salt which they were compelled by law to purchase, that too\nlittle remained to feed and clothe the family properly.\n\nThis story of the salt will scarcely be believed now; but it was found,\nthroughout France, about eighty years ago, to be only too true.  An\nenormous tax was laid upon salt, as one of the articles which people\ncould not live without, and which therefore everybody must buy.  To make\nthis tax yield plenty of money to the king, there was a law which fixed\nthe price of salt enormously high, and which compelled every person in\nFrance above eight years old to buy a certain quantity of salt, whether\nit was wanted or not.  By the same law, people were forbidden to sell\nsalt to one another, though one poor person might be in want of it, and\nhis next-door neighbour have his full quantity, without any food to eat\nit with.  Even in such a case as this, if a starving man ventured to\nsell salt for a loaf of bread, he was subject to severe punishment.\nNow, Marie's brothers were just ten and nine years old; and the\nhardships of the family had been increased since these poor boys became\nthe cause of their father having to buy their portion of salt.  Just\nable before to get on, the family were, by this additional tax, brought\ndown to a state of want; and Marie begged her father not to say a word\nabout giving her a single penny, to help her marriage with Charles; for\nshe saw well that he would never be able to do it.  Her poor father\ncould not contradict her.\n\nAs he could do nothing for her, he did not like to oppose the plan which\nthe young people were found at length to have talked over.  Charles knew\nthat, in cases of great poverty, huts had been built in a wood, or caves\nscooped out in the side of the chalk-hills, where people lived who could\nnot hire, or buy, or build a house.  He told Marie that he would build a\nhut in the wood, and that he would then marry, and live or starve\ntogether, since there was no use in waiting longer, seeing, as they did,\nthat their prospect never could improve.  The lord of the chateau would\nnot object, he was sure; as the lords always got out of their peasantry\nmuch more service than would pay for the stakes and twigs of a hut in\nthe wood.  Marie was easily persuaded, though her mother wept at the\nidea of the cold of winter, and the damps of spring, and the ague of\nautumn, that she knew caused terrible suffering to the poor, who lived\nin the woods and caves.  The good woman tried to console herself with\ntaking great care of a pair of fowls, which were to be her wedding\npresent to her daughter.\n\nSo here was Charles, this day at work in the wood, with Marie's brothers\nto help him.  One well-wisher had lent him an axe, and another a mallet;\nand he cut and drove stakes, while Robin and Marc collected twigs from\nthe brushwood, moss from the roots of trees, and rushes from the margin\nof the ponds.  They had chosen such a spot as they thought Marie would\nlike; for she would not be persuaded to come and choose for herself.\nShe only dropped that the hut ought to stand above the fogs of the\nponds; and she left the rest to Charles.  Charles had found a little\ngreen recess among the trees, on a slightly rising ground; Robin and\nMarc declared for it at once, when he showed them how he could cut away\nthe brushwood, so as to leave a pathway to the pond, and a pretty view\nof it when it gleamed in the sun, as it did this afternoon.  The boys\nclapped their hands: and Charles, feeling a glow at his heart, as if\nMarie and he were going to be happy at last, began to sing, as he drove\nhis corner-stakes.\n\n\"You will have a pleasant life of it here in the woods,\" said Robin,\nbringing as large a load of rushes as his two arms would hold.  \"I\nshould like to live here, as you are going to do.  You have only to look\ninto that pond for three minutes to see more fine fish than you will\nwant for a month after.\"\n\n\"The fish will do us no good,\" said Charles.  \"If a fishbone is found\nwithin a furlong of where I live (here where nobody else lives), off I\nam marched straight to jail.  And the Count's bailiff has surprisingly\nsharp eyes.\"\n\n\"I would bury the fishbones in the night-time,\" observed Marc, coming up\nwith a faggot of twigs; \"but I would have the fish, if I wanted them,\nfor all the bailiff.\"\n\n\"If you go to yonder jail,\" said Charles, \"and ask the folk how they\ncame there, some of them will tell you it was trying to get fish, when\nthey were hungry, for all the bailiff.  Or, if not fish, something else\nfrom the woods and warrens--a rabbit, perhaps, or a couple of doves.\"\n\n\"I hope the bailiff won't put me into jail for my rabbits,\" said Marc,\n\"for I have not eaten them.  I have a pretty litter of rabbits for\nMarie; and you will help me to make a hutch for them, behind the house.\nI should say hereabouts.\"\n\n\"Do you know no better than that?\" said Charles.  \"Your father could\nhave told you in a minute, if you had asked him, that it is against the\nlaw for anybody to keep rabbits and pigeons except the nobles.\"\n\n\"Pigeons!\" exclaimed Robin.  \"Why, that is too bad!  I have the\nprettiest pair of doves, from this wood, that ever was seen.  I took\nthem from the nest, a month ago; and I tell Marie that their cooing will\nset all the doves in the wood cooing, so that she will have music all\nday long while you are away at work.\"\n\n\"No matter for all that,\" said Charles.  \"It would be a pretty treat for\nMarie; and it is a pretty thought of yours: but Marie must be content to\nhear the Count's pigeons coo; for the first day the bailiff finds any\ntame ones, he will wring their necks, and make her or you suffer for\nhaving them.  I can't allow a rabbit or a pigeon here, boys, say what\nyou will.  They will be my ruin.  Ah!  I see you are vexed with me: but\nI did not make the law, and have no more liking to it than you: but I\ncan tell you, quick as the bailiff's eyes are upon everybody, they are\nmost so upon people who live, as I am going to do, with fish, and\npigeons, and rabbits all close round about them, and oftentimes wanting\na meal, as I fear Marie and I shall do.\"\n\nThe boys declared that if Charles would not take home their presents,\nthey would keep them, and bear the risk themselves.  They might thus let\nMarie have a rabbit or a bird to eat, now and then, if she could not\nkeep them in their live state, as a pleasure.\n\nAs the floor of the hut could not be too much trodden, in the absence of\nplanks and bricks, Charles and the boys gave it a first treading now, as\nsoon as the six biggest stakes were driven in.  Like all their peasant\nneighbours who were not barefoot, they wore wooden clogs; and with these\nall three stamped and tramped with might and main.\n\nThey were so busy at this work, that they did not perceive that any one\nwas approaching, till Robin, happening to turn round, exclaimed--\n\n\"Why, here is Marie!\"\n\nCharles bounded out of the enclosure, threw his arms round Marie, and\ncovered her cheek with kisses; so delighted was he with her for coming,\nas he thought, to see how the work went on, without even waiting till he\nwent for her.\n\n\"Stay, stay, Charles!\" exclaimed she, as soon as he would let her speak.\n\"Hear what I came for,\" she added, mournfully, and almost impatiently.\n\"You must give over this work for to-day; and perhaps for many days\nmore.  You must go away somewhere out of sight, till all the strangers\nhave left the place; or there is no saying what may happen.  Father says\nso; and it was my mother that bade me come.  She could not come herself,\nand so leave me among the soldiers.\"\n\n\"Soldiers!  What soldiers?\" asked all at once.\n\n\"The soldiers are come that we were warned would come whenever the Count\nshould bring his family home, and the Dauphiness pass through: and there\nare so many that there is not a house within two miles of the village\nthat has not some quartered in it.  We have three at home; and what we\nare to do for them we don't know, nor how long they will stay.  The\nfirst thing, however, Charles, is for you to keep out of sight.  Father\nsays if you don't, the Count's people will certainly be laying hold of\nyou for military service.\"\n\nCharles struck his mallet against a tree, as if he wished to knock its\nhead off.  Between fear, anger, and disappointment, he was quite in a\npassion.  He could not reasonably deny that all his and Marie's hopes\nmight depend on his hiding himself till the bustle was past; but it made\nhim wretched to think of skulking in idleness, when his protection and\nassistance would be most wanted by Marie and her family.\n\n\"Now, don't do that, love,\" said Marie, gently holding his hand, as the\ndull shock of his blows echoed through the wood.  \"That noise will bring\nsomebody.  The Count himself, and his family, are not far off; and his\npeople are all about.  Do be quiet, Charles.\"\n\n\"Quiet, indeed!  And what are you to do with three soldiers, when you\nhave not enough for yourselves?\"\n\n\"I don't know, indeed,\" said Marie, tearfully, as she remembered that\nher mother's cherished pair of fowls were doomed already for supper.\nShe did not mention this; but said that the soldiers were calling for\nfuel, as they liked a good fire in spring evenings; and that her\nbrothers must make haste home, each with a faggot, which would serve as\nan excuse for having been so long in the wood, if the Count's people\nshould have their eyes upon them.  She herself must make haste back,\nMarie said, as the soldiers wanted their linen washed by the next\nmorning.  Her mother was trying to borrow some wood-ashes, as they had\nscarcely any soap; and it was time now that they were at the wash-tub.\nShe must be gone.\n\nThe boys were more eager than Marie to be home.  They were in fear for\ntheir rabbits and doves.  They were heaping up their faggots with all\nspeed, when they heard noises from the lane which made them pause.\nThere was the sound of wheels, and the tramp of many horses, and the\nvoices of a large company.\n\n\"It is the Count and his family,\" said Marie, \"coming to the chateau by\nthe shortest road.  No--do not go, boys,\" she entreated, as they left\ntheir faggots, and began forcing their way through the brushwood towards\nthe pond, that they might see the sight in the lane.  \"Robin, dear\nRobin!--Marc,--come back!  Do come back, now!  You will see them much\nbetter to-morrow.  They will make a much grander show to-morrow.\nCharles, do make them stay here!\"\n\nCharles did not attempt this.  He was thinking of something else; for he\nhad observed Marie's colour change when the cavalcade was first heard in\nthe lane.  He fixed his eyes upon her as he said--\n\n\"Had you seen the Count and his train when you found us here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, looking in his face; \"I had crossed the corner of\nneighbour Thibaut's field, and was upon the stile when the party turned\ninto the cross-road; and I had to wait till they were all past.\"\n\n\"How many were there?\"\n\n\"Oh, more than I can tell.  There was a coach full of ladies, and six\nhorses to it.  And some more ladies on horseback, and some gentlemen,\nand many servants.\"\n\n\"Did any of them speak to you?\"\n\n\"They gave me good-day.  But, Charles, I could hardly return it\ndutifully to them.\"  She hid her face on her lover's shoulder as she\nwhispered, \"It made my heart sink to nothing, and does now, to think\nthat I cannot be married without his consent,--that great Count's!  When\nI saw his grandeur, I thought it never could be.\"\n\n\"Never fear,\" said Charles, relieved from some feeling of dread which he\nhardly understood, but still with a heavy heart.  \"If his grandeur be\nall you are afraid of, never fear.  He will be too busy to attend to\nsuch an affair, and will send us word through the bailiff, or the cure,\nif we can get him to speak for us.  Or we can wait a few days, till they\nare fairly gone with the Dauphiness, and then marry; and the thing done,\nhe will not take it amiss that we did not trouble him for his consent,\nat such a busy time.\"\n\n\"See, what are the boys doing?\" exclaimed Marie, who saw through the\ntrees that her brothers were making the humblest of their rustic bows\nrepeatedly, and with extraordinary earnestness.  \"Come further back into\nthe wood,\" she whispered.  \"Here, behind this thicket;--here no one can\nsee us from the lane.  Hark!  Can you hear what those voices are\nsaying.\"\n\nNo words could be distinguished; but the boys soon came running back,\nand, to Marie's great relief, followed by no one.\n\nHer brothers were full of what they had seen.  The cavalcade was very\ngrand.  The great coach looked quite full of ladies with their large\nwhite hats, covered with feathers, and flowers, and ribbons.  Some more\nladies in light blue riding-habits rode the most beautiful sleek horses;\nand so did the gentlemen.  One of the young gentlemen stopped, or tried\nto stop; but his horse would not stand, but kept wheeling round and\nround the whole time he was speaking to them.  He asked them whether\nthey did not live in this wood; and when they said, \"No,\" he asked\nwhether somebody did not live in it.  Upon their saying that they knew\nof no inhabitant, he further inquired whether, if he came bird-nesting,\nor with his fishing-rod, they did not think he should find some sort of\nhabitation among the trees.  And then he asked whether they were not the\nCount's peasantry; and what their names were, and how many there were in\nthe family; and whether the bailiff was kind to them.  By that time, the\ngentleman's horse began to bolt across the lane, and all the party but\none groom were almost out of sight; so the gentleman took off his hat,\nand bowed down to his saddle, looking very funny,--not mocking, but in\nplay, and galloped off; and the groom laughed and nodded, and galloped\nafter his master.\n\nCharles now turned away, and with desperate tugs pulled up the stakes he\nhad driven with so much satisfaction, and threw them into the thicket.\nHe filled the holes, scratched up with brambles the ground he and the\nboys had trodden, and strewed it over with green twigs, so that no token\nof his late labour was left to attract the eye of the passer-by.  The\nboys looked ruefully on his proceedings; and Marie appeared to forget\nthat her mother wanted her, as she gazed.  She soon, however, observed\nthat the lane was empty now, and they must be gone.  Sending her\nbrothers on before, she stayed one moment to entreat Charles to be\npatient under the separation and delay of a few days, and proposed to\nhim that he should be found, that day week, at a certain cave in the\nchalk-hill, two miles off, where she would send to let him know when the\ndanger was over, and he might appear again.\n\nCharles made no promises,--spoke no word of any kind.  He kissed her\nfervently, and would scarcely let her go: and when she looked back from\nthe verge of the wood, she saw him leaning his forehead against a tree.\nShe feared he was weeping very bitterly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPANY TO SUPPER.\n\nMarie's mother received her with a look almost of reproach; so\noverpowered was the poor woman with the business of providing lodging,\nfood, fire, and washing for three strangers, when she had no money, and\nfew other means of making them comfortable.  The men seemed to behave\nwell.  One of them was absent, helping his host to bring in his share of\nthe forage, to be provided by the village, for the cavalry now awaiting\nthe arrival of the Dauphiness.  The other two guests were sitting before\nthe door, one smoking, and the other every now and then looking in, and\naddressing some civil word to the hostess, who was plucking her fowls\nwith a heavy heart.\n\n\"I thought you were lost,\" said she to her children as they entered.\n\"Robin, fill the boiler; and Marc, blow the fire under it.  Your sister\nand I shall have to be at the wash-tub and ironing-board all night.\"\n\nThe soldiers were very sorry this trouble should be caused by them.  Was\nthere no one in the village who could relieve them of this part of their\nwork?  That the linen should be ready by the morning was indeed\nindispensable, as the Dauphiness might arrive at any hour of the next\nday: but to stand at the wash-tub at midnight!--it was terrible to think\nof.  However terrible, there was no help for it.  Every housewife in\nSaint Menehould had soldiers quartered upon her house, and her hands\ntherefore full, instead of being able to wash for another.  Besides\nthis, the Randolphes could not pay for such service.  Moreover, the\nfamily had to give up their beds (which were but poor cribs in the wall)\nto the strangers; and as they had to be up, they had better be employed\nthan idle.\n\nAs soon as Robin and Marc had done all they could for their sister in\nthe washing-shed, they hastened to the soldiers, and made the\nacquaintance which boys like to make with strangers who have travelled\nand seen wonderful things.  First they found out that one soldier was\ncalled Jerome, and that the other, who never ceased smoking, pretended\nto have so many names, that they saw he either meant to make a joke of\nthem, or did not choose to say what his real name was.  Then the boys\ntold their own names and ages, and those of all the family: but they did\nnot mention Charles, having learned that much prudence from the distress\nthey saw in the faces of their sister and mother.  Then it appeared that\nthe soldiers could tell a great deal about the Dauphiness.\n\n\"Will she be here to-morrow?\" asked Marc.\n\n\"That depends upon where she is to-night,\" replied Jerome.  \"The last I\nheard of her was at Strasburg.  You know she is a German, and comes from\nGermany.\"\n\nThe boys had never heard of Germany, near as they were to it, and did\nnot know where Strasburg was.  So they asked about something that they\ncould understand; what the great lady's name was, and how old she\nlooked.\n\n\"Her name is Marie-Antoinette-Joseph-Jeanne de Lorraine: and her age\nis--Let us see.  Comrade, how old is she, exactly?  I heard tell, I\nthink, that she is fifteen.\"\n\n\"Oh, that can't be!\" exclaimed the boys.  \"Married at fifteen!  And our\nMarie is--\"\n\nHere Robin remembered that he must not allude to Charles, and stopped.\n\n\"She was born on the day of the great earthquake at Lisbon--\"\n\n\"Is that where she lives?\"\n\n\"No, I think not.  Whether Lisbon is in Germany, I am not certain; but I\ndon't think she and her mother were in the earthquake; but I know that\nit happened the day she was born, and that it hurts her spirits to think\nof it.  She takes it for a sign that she will live unhappy, or die in\nsome dreadful way.\"\n\n\"You have not served out of France,\" observed Randolphe, as he came up,\nwith the third soldier, and seated himself on the bench.  \"You have not\nseen either Lisbon or Germany, I suppose; for I can tell you that Lisbon\nis a good way off from any place where this princess has been.  Well, I\nam sorry to hear anything hurts her spirits; but, to be sure, the great\nearthquake was an awful thing.\"\n\n\"I am thinking,\" said Jerome, \"that a good many thousand people must\nhave been born that same day; I hope they are not all troubled with bad\nspirits.  It would be a curious sight to see so many people of fifteen\nall low about the manner of their lives and deaths.\"\n\n\"She is very low sometimes, however,\" observed his comrade.  \"When she\nwas leaving the city she lived in, she wept so that nothing was ever\nseen like it.  She covered her eyes sometimes with her handkerchief, and\nsometimes with her hands; and looked out many times from the\ncoach-window, to see her mother's palace once more.\"\n\nEveryone thought there was no great wonder in this.  A young girl\nleaving her own country for ever, to be the wife of a foreign prince\nwhom she had never seen, and could not tell whether she should like,\nmight well be in tears, Randolphe said.  Had she cheered up yet?\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Jerome, \"that she has.  When she saw the fine\npavilion on the frontier, she was pleased enough.\"\n\nThe boys wanted to hear about the pavilion.\n\n\"It was there,\" said Jerome, \"that she was to be made a French princess\nof.  It was a very grand sort of tent, that cost more money than I can\nreckon.\"\n\nRandolphe sighed.\n\n\"There were three rooms,\" continued Jerome; \"a large one in the middle,\nand a smaller one at each end.  In one of these smaller rooms she left\neverything she had worn, even to her very stockings, and all her German\nattendants; and then she went through to the other, where she found her\nFrench attendants, and her fine French wardrobe.\"\n\n\"And shall we see her in some of her new clothes?\" asked Marc.\n\n\"Certainly.\"  And Jerome went on describing the princess's dress, and\ntold all he had heard of her jewels, and furs, and laces, till the\nsoldiers observed that their host had sighed very often.  One of the\nsoldiers then said that it was enough to make poor men like themselves\nsad to hear of such luxury, when they were hungry in the long summer\ndays, and cold all the long winter nights.\n\n\"What need you care?\" said the host, somewhat bitterly.  \"You are\nprovided for by law, when we country people are ground down by it.  You\ncome upon us, and must be served with the best, when we have not enough\nfor ourselves.\"\n\nThe third soldier declared that he thought this a very uncivil speech.\nJerome said that he, for his part, could dispense with civility in such\na case, when he happened to know where the truth lay.  He assured\nRandolphe that soldiers like himself were as little pleased with the\nstate of things as any countryman.  They themselves were the sons of\npeasants; and many had led a cottage life, and knew how to pity it.  But\nhe must say, a soldier's life was very little better.  The army could\nnot get its pay.  Glad enough would soldiers be to save trouble to their\nhosts, if they had a little money in their pockets; but pay was not to\nbe got, in these days, by soldiers, any more than if none was due to\nthem.\n\nHis smoking comrade thought there must be an earthquake somewhere in\nFrance, swallowing up all the money: for nobody could tell where it all\nwent to.\n\n\"How can you say that,\" said Randolphe, \"when you think of the numbers\nof idle people that are feeding upon those who work?--I hear you, wife,\"\nhe said, in answer to a warning cough from his wife within.  \"It is no\ntreason to say that in this land there are swarms of idle folk, living\nupon the toil of us who work.\"\n\nThe guests declared that they were men of honour, who would be ashamed\nto repay hospitality by reporting the conversation of their host.\nBesides, nobody in France could question the feet.  To say nothing of\nthe old king, languishing in the midst of costly pleasures, so vicious\nthat by every indulgence he purchased the curses of virtuous families,\nand the hatred of the poor,--besides all the extravagances in that\nquarter, there were the nobility, sitting heavy upon the people\nthroughout the land, like the nightmare upon the sleep of a wearied man.\nThese nobles must all be rich,--must all be pampered in luxury, though\nnot one of them would work with his head or hands.  If a nobleman had\nfive sons, they must all be pampered alike; and the sons of five hundred\npeasants must be oppressed, to supply the means.\n\nRandolphe said he had little thought to see the day when he should hear\nsoldiers say these things openly at his own door.  His face brightened\nas he declared this, though his wife again coughed more than once.\n\nJerome replied that it was a common thing now to hear these things told;\nfor the oppressed do get to speak out, sooner or later.  The story of\nthe king's meeting a coffin was in everybody's mouth.  No one here had\nheard it: so Jerome told that the king was fond of asking questions of\nstrangers, and particularly about disease, death, and churchyards;\nbecause he thought his gay attendants did not like to hear of such\nthings.  One day, he was hunting in the forest of Senard, when he met a\nman on horseback, carrying a coffin.\n\n\"Where are you carrying that coffin?\" asked the king.\n\n\"To the village yonder.\"\n\n\"Is it for a man or a woman?\"\n\n\"For a man.\"\n\n\"What did he die of?\"\n\n\"Of hunger.\"\n\nThe king clapped spurs to his horse, and rode away.\n\n\"He might find the same thing happening in many other villages,\" said\nRandolphe, stroking the thin cheeks of his boy Robin.  \"Look here!\"\nshowing the boy's arm.  \"Is this an arm that can work or fight as a\nFrenchman's should do, when my boy is a man?\"\n\n\"Things may be different when that boy is a man,\" said the smoker,\nbetween two whiffs of his pipe.\n\n\"How?  Where?  When?  Why?  Is anything going to be done for the poor?\"\nasked Randolphe and his family, within and without doors.\n\n\"I don't know when and how: but I think you need not ask why, if you\nlive some days of the week upon boiled nettles, as many of your\nneighbours do.  Those that have looked into the matter say that the\ncountry people (they who really do the work of the land) possess only\none-third of the country, and yet pay three-fourths of the taxes.  One\ndoes not see why this should go on, when once they choose that it shall\nnot: and many think that they won't choose it much longer.\"\n\n\"And then something will be done for the poor?\" said the hostess, coming\nto the door.\n\n\"Certainly; unless the rich do something for the poor first; which would\nbe their wisest way.\"\n\n\"But if the rich should not choose to do anything for us?\" said Robin.\n\n\"Then they must look to themselves.\"\n\n\"And what will happen to them?  What will happen to the Dauphiness?\"\n\n\"Oh, poor lady!  There is no saying that.  She knows little of what the\nFrench people are suffering, and nothing of what they are thinking.  How\nshould she?  What notion should she have of poverty and the poor, when\nshe is now buying, out of her allowance, a pair of ear-rings that cost\n360,000 francs?\"\n\n[Note: This is fact; but it happened a little later in her history,\nimmediately after she became queen: 360,000 francs are about 15,000\npounds.]\n\n\"You are joking, comrade.\"\n\n\"No, it is true.  She thinks there is no harm in it, because she will\npay the whole out of her own allowance, year by year; and the diamonds\nare so rare and wonderful that she thinks she has a good bargain.  What\nshould she know of poverty and the poor?\"\n\n\"God bless her!\" said the hostess, \"and may she never know what it is to\neat boiled nettles, for want of anything better!\"\n\n\"I wish she would have done with throwing away our money in diamonds at\nthat rate,\" said Randolphe, gloomily.  \"The people will not love her if\nshe does.  We all know it is what we pay for this cursed salt, and our\npoll-tax, and all our grinding taxes, that go to pay for such freaks as\nthese.\"\n\n\"Well, love,\" said his wife, \"she is young, and may learn.  Don't let us\nbe grudging to her as a stranger.\"\n\n\"Not I, love; I would grudge her nothing, if only I could give my family\nfood that would make them plump and rosy, as I hope to see this lady\nto-morrow, and if I could but apprentice my boys to some trade that\nwould give them a chance of a better living than their father had before\nthem, and take them a little from under the Count's hand, for that is\nvery heavy upon us.  If my boys have nothing better before them than to\ndivide my poor field, and live as peasants under the Count, I don't know\nthat I should cry to lay them in their graves before I lie down myself.\"\n\n\"And cannot you apprentice one of them, at least?\" inquired Jerome.\n\n\"How can I?  Besides the transaction between the artisan and me, there\nis a great sum to be paid to the king upon the indenture, and another\nand a larger before the lad begins his trade.  What can a poor peasant\ndo with his boys but make them poorer peasants than himself, if that is\npossible?  But it is not possible.  Is there coarser woollen than this\nthat I wear?  Is there a tougher leather than my belt is made of?  And\nis there anything for the feet poorer than our wooden clogs?  And as for\nfood, we are as far from health and strength on the one hand, as we are\nfrom the grave on the other--just half-way.  So my boys will be poor\npeasants, like their father, if they can make his field yield double;\nand if not, they will be in their graves.\"\n\nThe boys trembled, and would have cried if they dared.  Their mother\nwept outright: and the good-natured Jerome could only shake his head and\nsigh, and mutter that he feared that was the plight of millions more in\nFrance.  His smoking comrade again gave out, between two puffs, that\nbefore these boys were men, everything might be changed, and the nobles\nmight chance to find their mouths stuffed with boiled nettles, for once,\njust to show what they were like.  This speech made the boys laugh.\nTheir mother wiped her eyes, and gave notice that supper, such as it\nwas, was ready.  She knew there was nothing that could satisfy three\nmen, if they happened to be very hungry; she could only say that here\nwas all she had.\n\nHer guests answered her with a civil nod, and sat down at her board with\nalacrity, saying that the fowls looked savoury, and the bowl of milk\ngood for a thirsty man after a march.  Some of their comrades in the\nvillage had wine, they knew: but nothing was said about it; for the\nsoldiers' pockets were empty, like those of their host.\n\nIt was growing dark.  Randolphe made what blaze he could by throwing\nlight wood upon the fire.  By law, he was bound to furnish candles to\nhis guests; and some soldiers whom he had entertained had required this\nof him; but his present guests felt no disposition to do so, after what\nthey had heard.  They cut up their fowls by firelight: then, before\nbeginning to eat, they exchanged glances, the consequence of which was\nthat the boys were called, made to sit down, each between two soldiers,\nand treated with some mouthfuls of savoury fowl.  Can it be wondered at\nthat they forgot, till afterwards, that they were eating poor Marie's\nfowls, which they had hoped to see pecking about in the wood?\n\nThe lively talk that was going on round the table was soon interrupted\nby a loud rap upon the door, made by a heavy staff, such as the Count's\nfollowers usually carried when they went on messages.  Randolphe was not\nfond of receiving visits from the Count's people, and he now desired\nRobin to go to the door, and see what was wanted.  The message was heard\nby those within, for the bearer shouted it aloud from door to door of\nall the peasantry of the Count's estate.  Randolphe and another were\nwanted to-night, to flog the ponds.\n\n\"I will go myself, because I must,\" observed Randolphe: \"but how to find\nanother I don't know, so I shall just let that alone.\"\n\n\"They won't forgive you for not taking a second,\" remarked his wife.\n\"You will have to pay dear, one way or another: and yet I can't ask you\nto take one of the boys.--It is bad enough for you, a poor rest between\ntwo days' labour, to stand flogging the ponds till field time in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Have you often to do this night-work, neighbour?\" asked Jerome.\n\n\"Only when the family are at the chateau.  They are so used to live in\nParis, away from country noises, that they cannot sleep in the country\nfor the noise of the frogs, unless the ponds are flogged; so, when they\ncome, we have that work to do.\"\n\n\"Cannot you poison the frogs?\" asked Jerome.\n\n\"O, yes, father!\" cried Marc.  \"You poison rats: cannot you poison the\nfrogs, and have done with them?\"\n\nThe smoker here muttered something which made his comrade jog his elbow,\nand the host say, \"Hush!  Hush!\"  What he was muttering was, that if\nthey wanted to get rid of a nuisance, the aristocrats were fewer than\nthe frogs.\n\nRandolphe was evidently anxious to be gone after he had heard this\nspeech.  He would not say another word on his own grievances, or those\nof his neighbours.  He fetched his woollen cap, and stood only undecided\nas to what he should do about furnishing a second, to work with him that\nnight.  He glanced from one boy to the other: but both looked too pale\nto stand in the damps through an April night.  He repeated that he would\ntake no second: but while he said so, there were images in his mind of\nfine or compensation, bringing increased hardships on the morrow.  At\nthis moment a voice from the darkness without called his name, and said\nhe need not look any further for a comrade.\n\nAll the family knew that this was Charles's voice; but even the little\nboys had learned so much caution from hardship, that they did not speak,\nbut only looked at each other.  Jerome observed that it told well for\nhis host that he had a neighbour ready, without asking, to help him in\nso irksome a service.\n\nThe soldiers contrived to make room for the boys to sleep, thinking it\nquite enough that the law obliged Randolphe to flog the ponds, and his\nwife and daughter to toil in the shed all night, without the addition of\nthe two half-fed lads having to lie down on the clay floor, or not at\nall.  So each boy had a share of the crib, and a corner of the rug.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. A HOLIDAY MORNING.\n\nThe boys were wakened in the morning by a rap on the door, like that of\nthe preceding evening.  When they had rubbed their eyes and got up, they\nfound that their mother was speaking with no less a person than the\nbailiff from the chateau.  It took little time to slip on the only day\ngarment each had: and then, as their mother stood in the doorway, one\nlooked out under each of her arms, to see what was going on.\n\n\"Ah!  You little fellows,\" said the bailiff, \"I have some business with\nyou.  What have you to do with pigeons, when you know 'tis against the\nlaw for you to keep them?  Come, no excuses; I saw a brood of pigeons on\nthe ridge of the roof, as I came.\"\n\n\"How are we to help the Count's pigeons lighting on our ridge, if they\nchoose, please sir!\" said Marc.\n\n\"Nay, Marc, no tricks!\" said his mother.  \"The pigeons are theirs, sir;\ngot from the wood, and a present for their sister: but you see, sir, how\ntrickery and falsehood come.  If there were no reasons why my boys\nshould not do such an innocent thing as bring up a brood of pigeons, the\nthought of an untruth would not enter their heads; but you see what you\ntempt them to, by driving them so very hard about almost the only\npleasure they have.\"\n\n\"It is not I, good woman,\" said the bailiff.  \"Do not say I drive them\nhard--I did not make the laws; but it is my business to see that the\nlaws are regarded between the Count and his people, that is all.  Come!\nWhile your daughter puts on her gayest ribbon, I will go round, and see\nabout these pigeons.\"\n\nMarie had no gay ribbon to put on, though she must go immediately with\nher father before the Count.  It was the bailiffs errand to say this.\nWhile she made herself as neat as she could, and her father was called\nin from the field (to which he had gone straight from the ponds, because\nhe knew there was no meal ready for him at home), the bailiff examined\nthe premises, followed at a distance by the boys, in terror for their\nrabbit-hutch.  Of course, the rabbits were found; and of course, they\nwere carried off.  Robin rolled upon the ground in his grief, and Marc\nlooked as if his heart was bursting.  The bailiff was so sorry for what\nhe felt it his duty to do, that against all rule he offered the boys one\nyoung rabbit and one young pigeon to keep.  At first, these were\naccepted; but Robin was sure that Marc's rabbit would pine alone; and\nMarc was certain Robin's pigeon could never live solitary; and they gave\nup these last remains of their treasures.  To do it with a good grace\nwas more than they were equal to; and when Marie and her father set off\nfor the chateau, they left the boys crying bitterly.\n\nIt did not make Marie the more easy to see her lover skulking at a\ndistance, all the way they went.  The bailiff was close at hand; and she\nbelieved that his quick eyes would note all Charles's doings.  Every\ntime he spoke, which he did frequently and civilly, she dreaded his\nasking what business that man had, watching them from under the shade of\nthe wood; but each time she was relieved by hearing some question or\nremark about the reception of the Dauphiness in the village.  She had to\nsay all that must be said to the bailiff; for her father was busy\nthinking.  He was glad when they were left alone, so that he could tell\nMarie what was in his mind.  There was time enough to do this.  When the\ngreat iron gates of the avenue closed behind them, the bailiff told them\nto go straight on by the broad road.  He was going by a side path, but\nwould meet them farther on, and take them to the Count.\n\nThis was the opportunity Randolphe wanted, to tell his daughter that he\nthought it best now to ask the Count's consent to her marriage with\nCharles, formally and properly.  Marie trembled, and grew sick at heart\nas she heard this, and implored her father not to mention Charles,--so\nsure was she that her marriage would be prevented if Charles were spoken\nof.  Her father declared, however, that he knew the Count and his ways,\nand was certain that, his notice being attracted, nothing could now\nprevent his becoming acquainted with the minutest of their family\ncircumstances; and that the most politic course would be to appear to\ndesire his consent, and only to have waited his arrival at the chateau\nto request it.  Randolphe had decided upon his plan, and Marie had only\nto submit.\n\nThe bailiff met them at the head of the avenue, and led them to the\nmorning apartment of the Count, which he entered first, after being\nannounced, leaving his companions in the hall.  The door was presently\nopened, and he beckoned them in.\n\nThe Count was sitting in his morning gown beside a table, on which stood\na small silver tray, with his coffee-cup upon it.  His valet was\ndressing his hair.  Two of his sons were in the room; one playing with\nhis dogs in a recess of the window, and the other reading the newspaper.\n\n\"Come closer,\" said the Count, in answer to Randolphe's bow.  \"Nearer--\ncome close up to the table.\"\n\nThe truth was, he could not otherwise see them well while his hair was\nin the hands of his valet.\n\n\"Is it possible?\" he said, as if to himself, while he looked at the\npeasant and his daughter.  \"Are you Randolphe?  I had heard your name\nfor so long and so often, among my people, that I had imagined you one\nof the principal of them.  But you appear wretchedly poor, eh?\" he\ncontinued, looking into the sallow, unshaven face before him.  \"I am\nafraid you are very poor, eh?\"\n\n\"Well-nigh heart-broken with poverty, my lord.\"\n\n\"There is some mistake,\" resumed the Count.  \"How is this?\" said he,\nlooking towards the bailiff; and then, calling to his son in the window,\n\"Casimir, how is this?\"\n\nThe bailiff answered first:--\n\n\"Randolphe is wretchedly poor, my lord, as you say; but there is no one\nof your people hereabouts who is less so.\"\n\nThe youth's reply was, that in the question of arrangements for\nreceiving the Dauphiness, he supposed the principal peasants belonging\nto the chateau would be spoken to; and he had mentioned Randolphe,\nunderstanding him to be one of them.\n\nMarie saw that this youth was the one who had stared her out of\ncountenance at the stile, the afternoon before: the same who had talked\nwith her brothers on the verge of the wood.\n\nThe Count was for dismissing his visitors at once, saying that they\nwould not answer his purpose for the arrangements of which he had meant\nto speak with them.  They were not, however, let off so easily as they\nhad now begun to hope.  The young man asked some questions from the\nwindow, which put it into the Count's head to ask more, till Randolphe\nthought it prudent not to keep back his story, but to request the\nCount's consent to Marie's marriage, as if that had been his own part of\nhis errand this morning.\n\nThe Count evidently cared nothing about the matter, and would have given\nhis consent as a matter of course, if his son Casimir had been anywhere\nbut in the room.  As it was, there were so many questions, the inquiries\nabout Charles were so minute, that Marie grew vexed and angry, and by a\nlook invited her father to say something about the Count's time and be\ngone.  The youth who was reading certainly pitied her, for he said,\nwithout raising his eyes from his newspaper,--\n\n\"Be quiet, Casimir.  Casimir, how can you?  Do leave these poor people\nto make themselves happy their own way.  It is no concern of yours.\"\n\n\"It is my father's concern that his people should not live on his land\nwhen they cannot do service for it.  Why, it appears they have not\nanything like a cottage to go to.  My father cannot look to them for\nanything.  You see, sir, you can depend upon them for nothing, in their\npresent circumstances: and I do not see how you can consent to their\nmarrying yet.  If this fellow Charles, now, would do his duty, and serve\nfor three years, there would be some chance for their settling\ncomfortably afterwards.  They would lose nothing by waiting, if they\nsettled comfortably at last.\"\n\n\"Please your lordship,\" said Randolphe, in a hoarse voice, \"they have\nwaited so very long already, and there is no prospect--\"\n\nHe glanced at Marie to see how she bore this.  She seemed to be just\nfalling; and he drew her arm within his, to keep her up.\n\n\"We will take care that there is a prospect,\" said Casimir.  \"We do not\nintend to lose sight of you.  We may do some kind things for Marie.\"\n\nMarie tried to speak; but before she could utter a sentence, the Count\ndiscovered that the valet had arrived at the last bow of the pig-tail,\nand that he must make a decision, and conclude this interview.  He\ntherefore pronounced that Charles should be sent on military service for\nthree years, and gave orders to the bailiff to see that the young man\nwas brought in for the purpose, in the course of the morning.  He then\nbade good-day to his peasant dependent, and hoped he would see better\ntimes, and do the best he could for the young people before their\nwedding-day, as he would now have a considerable interval in which to\nmeditate his duty as a parent to so pretty a daughter.\n\nWhile the Count was saying this, Casimir slipped round towards the door,\nand, as Marie passed near him, thrust a piece of gold into her hand.\nMarie had never had a piece of gold in her hand before, and she did not\nlike it now.  She looked at Casimir with such a look as he had never\nbefore met from human eyes, and threw his gift between his two dogs in\nthe window.\n\nThe Count did not see nor heed this.  Randolphe thought his graver son\ndid; for there was a sudden crackle of the newspaper, and the reader's\nface was crimson to the temples.\n\n\"We have one friend there, I fancy,\" muttered the unhappy father, as he\nwent out.  \"But for that, I think you and I had better drown ourselves\nin the ponds between this and home.\"\n\n\"Charles!\" gasped Marie in his ear.  \"Send Charles away!  I can get home\nalone.\"\n\nHer father took the hint.  They parted in the shade of the avenue, as\nsoon as they could suppose themselves unwatched from the chateau.\nRandolphe cut across into the wood where he had seen Charles half an\nhour before, while Marie went homewards with tottering steps, looking\naway from the ponds, from a feeling that her state of mind was too\ndesperate for her to trust herself on the brink of deep waters.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. HOLIDAY INDEED.\n\nIt was a comfort to Marie, on reaching home, to find that no soldiers\nwere there.  The guests of the preceding night had been summoned to\ntheir duty, as the royal train might be certainly expected in the course\nof the morning.  The good-natured Jerome's heart had been touched by the\nlamentations of the boys for their lost favourites; and he had told them\nthat, if they would leave off crying, so as to make their faces fit to\nbe seen by the train of nobles, they might look out for him on the\nroadside, and he would try to place them where they might see the\nDauphiness.  They had made every effort to look cheerful, and were\nthinking more about the Princess than of pigeons and rabbits when their\nsister returned; but when they witnessed her burst of weeping on her\nmother's bosom--when they heard that Charles was to be carried off for a\nsoldier for three years, and that there was to be no hut in the wood,\nand no new brother-in-law for them, they cried more bitterly than ever.\n\nIn the midst of this scene, Jerome came by on horseback.  He could not\nstop; but he called out that the band had been heard already, and\npointed to the place where the boys should go and take their stand.\nThey did not now care anything about the procession, or the coach with\nsix horses, or the handsome ladies, or the noble gentlemen that Jerome\nhad promised they should see.  Their mother wished that they should not\nmiss such a sight: but they did not move as she said so.  When, however,\nMarie turned her face towards them, and said, \"Go, dears: pray do,\" they\ntook their caps, and walked away; they thought it so kind of Marie to\ncare for their pleasure at such a time.\n\nJerome passed again, after they had gone a few yards, and nodded and\nbeckoned.  They ran and kept up with his horse, till he stopped opposite\nthe post-house.  He told them hastily that he was to be stationed here;\nand he was glad of it, as it was expected that the party would halt at\nthe post-house.  He desired the boys to keep close behind, at his\nhorse's tail, where nobody would meddle with them.  They must not notice\nhim till spoken to, and must take care of his horse's tread: all the\nrest they might leave to him.  There was presently an opportunity for\nhim to speak a few words more to them; and he could not help saying how\nsorry he was to see how they had been crying since he had left their\ncottage.  Of course, this brought out the story of Charles, and the new\nmisfortune threatened to the family.  Jerome was not the only one who\nheard the tale.  His smoking comrade was by his side: and it was exactly\nthe kind of story to which his ears were most open.  The two soldiers\nconversed together in a low voice for a minute or two, and then sat bolt\nupright and silent, as if they had been made of stone, and had not each\ncarried a pitying heart under his stiff uniform and steady countenance.\nWhen the military music was heard coming nearer and nearer, and distant\ncheers were borne on the breeze, the commanding officer rode by, and saw\nnothing in the demeanour of these two soldiers to distinguish them from\nall the rest of the line, who were thinking only of themselves or the\nDauphiness.\n\nShe came, preceded by so many attendants on horseback, and inferior\ncarriages, which passed without taking any notice of the post-house,\nthat Robin and Marc heard the people about them lamenting that there\nwould be no halt, and that they should barely see the Princess after\nall.  They were mistaken, however.  It was one of the plans of the\njourney that the royal carriage should stop for a few moments at every\npost-house, whether fresh horses were wanted or not, in order that the\nloyal feeling of the people should be cherished by a sight of her who\nwas to be their queen, and whose appearance was indeed likely to\ncaptivate all eyes and hearts.\n\nThe six bay horses were checked precisely at the right spot: and all\nwhich preceded the royal carriage halted at the same moment.  The air\nwas rent by a cheer, such a cheer as convinced the Count and his family\nhow faint in comparison their welcome had been, when they had appeared\nfrom the by-road to the chateau half an hour before.  When his train had\ntaken their station at the entrance of Saint Menehould, there had been a\nfew cries of \"Long live the Count our lord!\" but they were a mere\nwhisper compared with the acclamation which greeted the Dauphiness.\n\nThe royal carriage was open almost all round, so that the Princess was\nconspicuously visible.  She was full as beautiful as any of the gazers\nhad expected.  Her complexion was fresh and fair, her countenance\nsmiling, and her blue eyes full of spirit and feeling; and though she\nlooked no more than fifteen (her actual age), all thought, as she moved\nher stately head in answer to their greeting, that they had never seen\nso dignified a lady.\n\nIn about two minutes from the halting of her carriage, Jerome turned his\nhead round with a hasty smile to the boys; and before they knew what it\nmeant, his and his comrade's horses began scrambling and sliding.\nJerome's opened a way for the boys to escape into the road from the\ndanger of a kick; and as soon as they were safe there, the horses began\nto prance, and make yet more confusion.  The Dauphiness looked that way,\nas Jerome intended that she should; and when her attention was fairly\nfixed, he called to the boys to come back to their places.\n\nAs Jerome had hoped, their doleful faces, all swollen with crying,\nattracted the notice of the Princess, who had hitherto met only smiling\ncountenances wherever she turned, since she had entered her new country.\nThese traces of tears carried back her thoughts to her own weeping,\nsome days before, on leaving Vienna; and she suddenly beckoned to the\nchildren.  In a moment a hundred voices bade them go forward to the\ncarriage; a hundred hands pointed and pushed, so that they were\npresently within hearing of the kind questions of the young Princess.\n\nShe asked what made them so unhappy on this day, when every one else\nlooked pleased and joyful.  They could scarcely help crying again at the\nquestion; but they were old enough to know that everything might depend\non their behaviour at this moment; and they strove to speak, and to\nspeak plainly.  Had they been ill?  The Princess asked, observing to her\nladies that they looked sadly thin.  No, they had not been ill, they\nreplied; they were only very unhappy to-day.\n\nThe bailiff, who was in attendance on the Count's family, now put\nhimself forward to explain, not to the Dauphiness herself (that would\nhave been too bold), but to one of her ladies, on the other side of the\ncarriage, about his having taken away the boys' rabbits and pigeons\naccording to law.\n\n\"'Tis not that,\" cried Marc, indignantly, as he heard this.  \"We left\noff crying about the rabbits and pigeons long ago: did not we, Robin?\nIt is about Charles and Marie.\"\n\n\"Tell me about Charles and Marie,\" said the Princess, in broken French,\n\"and then all about your pigeons.\"\n\n\"Charles and our sister were just going to be married, and we had begun\na house in the wood for them; and we have had to pull it to pieces\nagain; and this morning the Count says Charles must go for a soldier for\nthree years; and Marie is crying at home so--\"\n\nMarc could not go on for his own tears.\n\nThe Count's sons had, by this time, made their way through the closing\ncrowd, to hear what was going on.\n\n\"Casimir,\" said his brother, \"your bad work of this morning must be\nundone, you see.  Do your part with a good grace.  Bring my father to\nreceive the commands of the Dauphiness.\"\n\nCasimir yielded.  While he was gone, his brother explained to the\nPrincess the rights which the Count had over this family, as over the\nother peasants of the neighbourhood.  He ventured to answer for his\nfather, that he would see the hardship of this particular case, and\nwould permit some arrangement to be made, by which Charles might be\nspared the threatened misfortune, and restored to his hopes of a speedy\nmarriage.\n\n\"Where is this Charles?\" asked the Princess.  \"I will not ask to see the\ntearful Marie before so many eyes.\"\n\nRobin had seen Charles, just before, near the spot; for Charles was\ndesperate, and would neither hide nor attempt to escape.  He roamed\nabout, half-mad with the suffering of his mind, among the holiday groups\nof Saint Menehould; and when called, was not long in presenting himself.\n\n\"Alas!  Is this the bridegroom?\" asked the Princess, shrugging her\nshoulders, with an expression of pity.\n\n\"He looks better than that sometimes, when he plays with us,\" said Marc,\nzealous for his friend Charles.\n\n\"But his dress!\" said a lady, who had seldom before seen a peasant, and\nwas not familiarised with the coarse woollen garment and leathern belt,\nso common among the country people.\n\n\"It is just what father wears, and everybody,\" maintained Marc.\n\nBy this time the Count was waiting the pleasure of the Princess, ready\nto assure her of his patronage of any persons she might please to\nfavour.  The Dauphiness asked whether such poverty as she witnessed was\nnot a thing hitherto unheard of,--whether such misery could be common in\nthe country she had just entered?  The bridling of some of her ladies,\nand the annoyance in the faces of some gentlemen of her suite, showed\nher that she had asked an imprudent question.  Yet she was only fifteen,\nand was to be hereafter the queen of this country; and if she had never\ndone worse things than asking such questions, she might have lived\nbeloved, and died lamented, in a good old age.\n\nShe saw another thing in the countenances of her attendants,--that it\nwas time to be gone.  She therefore requested of the Count, as a favour\nto herself, that he would settle Charles advantageously on his lands;\nand smiling at the young man, she declared that she would answer for\nCharles's fidelity to his lord.  Charles was on his knees at the word,\ntoo much overpowered to speak, but promising all by his clasped hands\nand heaving breast.  The Count declared he should have a cottage and a\nfield that very day, and his hearty consent to take Marie home as soon\nas the priest could marry them.\n\nThe Dauphiness asked one of her attendant gentlemen for her purse, and\ngave the boys gold for Marie.  They were to tell her to make her cottage\ncomfortable with it.\n\n\"As for yourselves,\" said she, \"what did I hear just now that you\nwanted?  Canary-birds, was it?\"\n\n\"Pigeons,\"--\"rabbits,\" said the boys; \"but never mind them now.\"\n\n\"O, but I do mind; you shall have some money for that too.\"\n\nThe bailiff explained that it was not poverty, but the law which\ninterfered with the boys' pleasures.  Pigeons abounded in the wood, and\ncould feed themselves; but it was against the law for any under the rank\nof a noble to keep them.  The Dauphiness supposed this was all as it\nshould be; for she was apt, through life, to believe that the nobles\nwere by nature entitled to all things, and might give only such leavings\nas they did not wish for, to inferior people: yet she was pleased, and\nrepaid the bailiff with a gracious smile, when he said that all laws\nmelted away before the wishes of a royal bride, and that these peasant\nboys should have their rabbit-hutch and dove-cot henceforth, by special\npermission.\n\nNone waved their caps more vehemently, none shouted \"Long live the\nDauphiness!\" more vigorously, as the cavalcade set forth again, than\nRobin and Marc.  When the last horseman vanished in the dust of the\nroad, the attention of the crowd turned upon the favoured family of\nRandolphe.  The poor man himself had retired overpowered, and no one\ncould tell where he was.  Charles was with Marie already.  But the boys\nremained in the road; they were hoisted on the shoulders of their\nneighbours, having first delivered the precious gold pieces into the\nhands of the curd, lest they should lose Marie's treasure in the bustle.\nRobin would not be carried a step towards home till he had been allowed\nto speak to Jerome.  He threw his arms round the neck of the\ngood-natured soldier, and said that it was he who had made Marie's\nfortune.  Then Jerome had to shake hands with every person in the crowd;\nand every man who had a house or cottage begged Jerome to be his guest.\nJerome laughed, and said, that among so many he should not have known\nwhat to reply, and how to choose his host; but that he and his comrades\nwere at Saint Menehould only for the occasion which was now passed, and\nbefore night they would be twenty miles off.\n\nBefore sunset, accordingly, Jerome and the smoker were riding side by\nside on the road to fresh quarters, each with a fine bouquet of spring\nflowers at his breast, sent by Marie.  They were talking of the events\nof the morning, of the sudden rescue of a worthy family from the depths\nof misery.  The smoker could not be cheered even by what he had\nwitnessed; and he spoke as gloomily and sententiously as if the pipe\nwere now between his lips, and his words coming forth in a cloud of\nsmoke.  Jerome could not but own, however, that there was much truth in\nwhat he said, when he declared, \"It is all very well, and I am glad this\none family is saved.  But it is only one of many hundred thousand\nmiserable families.  What is to become of all the rest, who may not have\nthe luck to see a royal bride pass their way?  It is not a few royal\nsmiles and gold pieces, here and there, that will save the royal, or the\nnoble, or the poor, while the law and the customs of the great oppress\nand destroy a hundred to pamper one.  If this young Dauphiness were to\ndo this deed over again every hour of the year, she could not do more\nthan put off for a little while the storm that will burst upon her and\nall of us, when the poor can endure no more.\"\n\n\nVOLUME TWO.\n\nCHAPTER 1. ROYALTY.\n\nIt is a common belief, among those who have not learned to be wiser,\nthat to be a king, or one of the king's family, is the same thing as to\nbe perfectly happy.  It is probable that all persons living in a country\nwhere there is a royal family have thought so at some time of their\nlives.  The poor man who lives under the harsh orders of some superior,\nfancies the king with his crown on his head, ordering all things as he\nlikes.  Hard-working servant-girls think of the queen as driving about\nin her carriage all the morning, and going to the play every evening.\nChildren, when tired of their lessons, or sent from some favourite book\non an errand to the cellar, or a walk in the cold, imagine the royal\nprinces and princesses doing what they like, and putting upon others\nwhatever is disagreeable.  Unless some circumstance should bring home to\ntheir minds the truth that royalty does not exempt from sickness and\ndeath, and from the troubles of the heart and mind, such persons may go\non for the greater part of their lives envying royal personages who,\nperhaps, would gladly be peasants, or in any rank but the highest, the\nevils of which many a sovereign has found to be more than could be\nborne.\n\nThe poor people of France, at the time of the story you have just read,\nwere as ignorant as I have described about royalty and its privileges.\nThere was also something worse than ignorance in their minds about the\ninhabitants of the splendid royal palaces of Paris and Versailles.  It\nhas been shown how poor and how oppressed some of the country people\nwere; this poverty and oppression, accompanied with ignorance, caused,\nin some parts of the kingdom, and especially in Paris, passions of fear\nand hatred which were then terrible to witness, and are now, after\nseventy years, dreadful to think of.  One anecdote will show the mind\nand temper of some of the people of Paris about the time when the\nDauphiness entered France.\n\nThe old king, Louis the Fifteenth, had ruined his health, as well as\nmade himself detested, by his vices.  At one time, when he was very ill,\nParis was crowded with hungry wretches who had come up from the country,\nin hopes of finding a living in the capital.  The police had orders to\nclear the city, every now and then, of these beggars, and send them back\nto their native places.  On one occasion the police carried off some\nchildren of respectable persons, in hopes of getting large sums of money\nfor ransom.  The mothers of these children, seeking them in the streets\nand squares, and weeping as they went, attracted crowds; and a report\nwas spread, and believed at once, that the physicians of the king had\nordered for his cure baths of children's blood!  Those who believed this\nnonsense rose in a riot, before it was found that the missing children\nwere alive and safe; and several of the poor misled rioters were hanged.\n\nThis story proves more than the ignorance of the suffering people.  It\nshows how the royal family and their attendants were regarded,--how\ntyrannical and cruel, how selfish and how powerful, they were thought.\nThe royal family was from this time forward greatly wronged by the\npeople; but it was because the people had already been much more wronged\nby the rich and powerful.  They had been so ground down into poverty and\nwretchedness, that they felt the fiercest envy, the most brutal rage,\ntowards all the wealthy and noble, believing them born to be unboundedly\nhappy, and to make everybody below them as miserable as they pleased.\nNever, perhaps, were the absurd notions of the privileges of royalty\nheld in such exaggeration as by the common people of France at this\ntime; and never, perhaps, was a more intense hatred shown among men than\nby those who abolished this royalty.  The story of the young king Louis\nthe Seventeenth, which is now to be told, is a standing lesson to all\nwho may imagine that to be a prince is to be happier than other people.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. ROYAL WAYS.\n\nLouis the Seventeenth was born in 1785.  He was the second son of the\nprincess who passed through Saint Menehould from Vienna, after her\nmarriage.  From being Dauphiness she had since become queen, and her\neldest boy was now the Dauphin.  This second son, whose history we are\nto follow, was called the Duke of Normandy; and as he was never likely\nto be anything more, there was less pomp and fuss about him than was\nmade about his brother, the heir to the throne.  Yet, from the day of\nhis birth, he had an establishment of his own; and while a little\nunconscious baby, not knowing one person from another, and wanting\nnothing but to eat and sleep, he was called the master of several\nladies, waiting-women, gentlemen, and footmen, who were appointed to\nattend upon him.\n\nWe happen to have full accounts of the way of living of this royal\nfamily in the days of their prosperity, as well as of their adventures\nwhen adversity overtook them.  Up to the time when the Duke of Normandy\nwas four years old, life in the palace was as follows.\n\nThe oldest members of the royal family were the king's aunts,--the great\naunts of the Duke of Normandy.  There were four sisters, all unmarried.\nOne of them had gone into a convent, and found herself very happy there.\nAfter the dulness of her life at home, she quite enjoyed taking her\nturn with the other nuns in helping to cook in the kitchen, and in\nlooking after the linen in the wash-house.  Her three sisters led\ndreadfully dull lives.  They had each spacious apartments, with ladies\nand gentlemen ushers to wait on them,--a reader to read aloud so many\nhours a day, and money to buy whatever they liked.  But they had nothing\nto do,--and nobody to love very dearly.  They were without husbands and\nchildren, and even intimate friends; for all about them of their own age\nand way of thinking were of a rank too far below their own to be made\nintimate friends of.  These ladies duly attended divine service in the\nroyal chapel; and they did a great deal of embroidery and tapestry-work.\nWhen the proper hour came for paying their respects to their niece the\nqueen, they tied on their large hooped petticoats, and other articles of\ncourt-dress, had their trains borne by their pages, and went to the\nqueen's apartment to make their courtesies, and sit down for a little\nwhile, chiefly to show that they had a right to sit down unasked in the\nroyal presence.  In a few minutes they went back to their apartments,\nslipped off their hooped petticoats and long trains, and sat down to\ntheir work again.  They would have liked to take walks about Paris and\ninto the country, as they saw from their windows that other ladies did;\nbut it was not to be thought of,--it would have been too undignified: so\nthey were obliged to be contented with a formal, slow, daily drive, each\nin her own carriage, each attended by her lady-in-waiting, and with her\nfootmen mounted behind.  They were fond of plants, and longed above\neverything to be allowed to rear flowers with their own hands, in a\ngarden: but this too was thought out of the question: and they were\nobliged to be content with such flowers as would grow in boxes on their\nwindow-sills in the palace.  Madame Louise, the one who became a nun,\nemployed a young lady to read to her while she yet lived in the palace.\nSometimes the poor girl read aloud for five hours together; and when her\nfailing voice showed that she was quite exhausted, Madame Louise\nprepared a glass of _eau sucree_ (sugared water) and placed it beside\nher, saying that she was sorry to cause so much fatigue; but that she\nwas anxious to finish a course of reading which she had laid out.  It\ndoes not seem to have occurred to Madame Louise to take the book\nherself, or ask some one else to relieve her tired reader.\n\nThe king, Louis the Sixteenth, would probably have been a dull man in\nany situation in life.  His mind was dull.  But his tastes showed that\nhe might have been better and happier in many places than in his own\npalace.  Till he fell into misfortune, and showed a somewhat patient and\nforgiving temper, he seems not to have attached anybody to him.  He was\nvery silent, though now and then giving way to strange bursts of\nrudeness, which made his children and servants afraid of him.  For many\nyears after he married, his wife was not sure whether he cared at all\nabout her.  There must always be some doubt of this, for a time, in the\ncase of royal marriages which take place, as his did, without the\nparties having ever met, or being able to tell whether they shall like\none another.  The king's manners were such that it was difficult to say\nwhether he cared about anybody,--except, indeed, one person; and that\nperson was not the queen, nor his aunts, nor his children, but--a\nlocksmith of the name of Gamin.\n\nThere were three employments that the king was so fond of, that he\nseemed to have no interest left for anything else: first, of\nlock-making; secondly, of hunting; thirdly, of studying geography.  As\nlong as he could spend his hours with his huntsmen, with Gamin, or\nmarking his copper globe, or colouring maps, he seemed to care little\nhow his ministers managed his kingdom, or how his wife spent her time,\nand formed her friendships.\n\nA person who had the opportunity of examining his apartments gives an\naccount of them which shows how little the king liked the common course\nof royal life, and how differently he employed his hours in private from\nwhat his people supposed.  On the staircase which led from one to\nanother of his small private apartments, hung six pictures of the king's\nhunts, with exact tables of the game he had killed,--the quantity, the\nkind of game, and the dates of the occasions, divided into the months,\nthe seasons, and the years of his reign.  In a splendid room below\nstairs hung the engravings which had been dedicated to him, and designs\nof canals and other public works.  The room above this contained the\nking's collection of maps, spheres, and globes.  Here were found numbers\nof maps drawn and coloured by the king,--some finished, and many only\nhalf done.  Above this was a workshop, with a turning-lathe, and all\nnecessary instruments for working in wood.  Here, while no one knew\nwhere the king was, did he spend hours with a footman, named Duret, in\ncleaning and polishing his tools.  Higher up was a library, containing\nthe books the king valued most, and some private papers relating to the\nhistory of the royal families of Hanover, England, Austria, and Russia.\nIn the room over this, however, did his majesty most delight to spend\nhis mornings.  It contained a forge, two anvils, and every tool used in\nlock-making.  Here he took lessons of Gamin, who was smuggled up the\nback stairs by Duret; and here the king and the locksmith hammered away\nfor hours together; while all about the room might be seen common locks,\nfinished in the most perfect manner, secret locks, and locks of copper\nsplendidly gilt.  Gamin was a vulgar-minded man; and he treated the king\nill, both at this time, and after adversity had overtaken the royal\nfamily.  In these early days, he felt that the king was in his power, so\nafraid was his majesty of the queen and court knowing about his\nlock-making, and Gamin having it in his power to tell, any day.  He\nspoke gruffly to the king, and ordered him about as if he had been an\napprentice; to which the king always submitted.  He not only endured\nthis treatment, but entrusted Gamin with various secret commissions,\nwhich were sometimes of great importance.  The account which Gamin gave\nof the king was that he was kind and forbearing, timid, inquisitive, and\n_very_ apt to go to sleep.\n\nThere was one more apartment, a sort of observatory, on the leads, in\nwhich was an immense telescope.  Duret was always at hand, either\nsharpening tools, or cleaning the anvil, or pasting maps; and the king\nemployed him to fix the lens of the telescope so as to suit his\nmajesty's eye; and there, in an arm-chair at the end of the telescope,\nsat the king, for hours together, spying at the people who thronged the\npalace courts, or who went to and fro in the avenue.\n\nWhile his majesty was thus pursuing all this child's play in private,\nhis people were starving by thousands, and preparing by millions to\nrebel; the government was deep in debt, the ministers perplexed, and the\nwisest of them in despair, because they never could get his majesty to\nspeak or act, even so far as to say in council which of two different\nopinions he liked the best.  He would sit by, hearing consultations on\nthe most important and pressing affairs, and after all leave his\nministers unable to act, because he would not utter so much as \"Yes\" or\n\"No.\"  He had no will, and nothing could be done without it.  What a\npity, for suffering France, and for the mild Louis himself and all his\nfamily, that he was not a huntsman or a mechanic instead of a king!\n\nThe little Duke of Normandy knew nothing of all this, and saw very\nlittle of his father in any way.  What did he see his mother doing?  The\nformality of the court was such that he saw less of his mother than\nalmost any child in the kingdom of its parents; but the sort of life the\nqueen led was as follows.\n\nShe had been married, as we know, at fifteen, when she was not only\ninexperienced, but very ignorant.  Her mother, the Empress of Austria,\nwas so busy governing her empire, that she could pay little attention to\nthe education of her children.  She gave them governesses; but these\ngovernesses indulged their pupils, doing their lessons for them,--\ntracing their writing in pencil,--casting up their sums,--whispering to\nthem how to spell,--doing the outline of their drawings first, and\ntouching them up at last.  The consequence was, that when this young\ngirl entered France, a bride, at fifteen years of age, she knew next to\nnothing, and though she took some pains, she never learned to spell well\nin French, or to write grammatically, even after she declared that she\nhad forgotten her native language--German.  She was very clever,\nnotwithstanding.  She had a strong, firm, and decided mind.  Her\nignorance, however, was an irreparable evil,--especially her ignorance\nof men and common life.  She had no means of repairing this ignorance.\nEverybody flattered her; every one yielded to her in the days of her\nprosperity; so that she knew no will but her own, till some mistake,\nwhich it was to late to set right, showed her how she had been deceived.\nEven during the happiest years of her life, while all appeared to go\nwell, she was perpetually getting into scrapes, and making enemies; and\nwe shall see, by-and-by, how, on one occasion, her inexperience cost, in\nits consequences, the lives of herself and all her family but one.\n\nOf her many mistakes, however, none were so fatal as that of concluding\nthat all was well because no one told her to the contrary,--of passing\nher days in splendour and pleasure, giving her whole mind to acting\nplays, masquerading, and inventing new amusements, and now and then\nproviding for dependents by giving a licence to sell some necessary\narticle dear to the poor, while the poor were growing desperate with\nfamine.  She was careless and selfish, but she was not hard-hearted; for\nwhenever she witnessed misery she hastened to relieve it, often\nsacrificing her own pleasures for the purpose; but the people,\nhunger-bitten and in rags, seeing her splendour, and hearing reports of\nfar more than was actually true, believed her hard-hearted; and from\nbeing proud of her, and devoted to her, when she entered France as a\nbride, they learned at last to hate her from the bottom of their souls.\n\nThere would be no end to the story of how many attendants the queen had,\nand what were the formalities observed among them.  We will only briefly\ngo over the history of a day, in order fully to understand how great was\nthe reverse when she became a prisoner.\n\nThe queen was awakened regularly at eight o'clock, at which hour her\nfirst lady of the bed-chamber entered the room, sad came within the gilt\nrailing which surrounded the bed, bringing in one hand a pincushion, and\nin the other the book containing patterns of all the queen's dresses, of\nwhich she had usually thirty-six for each season, besides muslin and\nother common dresses.  The queen marked with pins the three she chose to\nwear in the course of that day;--one during the morning, another at\ndinner, and a third in the evening,--at a card-party, a ball, or the\ntheatre.  The book was then delivered to a footman, who carried it to\nthe lady of the wardrobe.  She took down from the shelves and drawers\nthese dresses and their trimmings; while another woman filled a basket\nwith the linen, etcetera, which her majesty would want that day.  Great\nwrappers of green taffeta were thrown over these things, and footmen\ncarried them to the queen's dressing-room.  Sometimes the queen took her\nbreakfast in bed, and sometimes in her bath.  Her linen dress was\ntrimmed with the richest lace; her dressing-gown was of white taffeta;\nand the slippers in which she stepped to the bath were of white dimity,\ntrimmed with lace.\n\nTwo women were kept for the sole business of attending to the bath,\nwhich was usually rolled into the room upon castors.  The bathing-gown\nwas of fine flannel, with collar and cuffs, and lining throughout of\nfine linen.  The breakfast, of coffee or chocolate, was served on a tray\nwhich stood on the cover of the bath.  Meantime one of the ladies warmed\nthe bed with a silver warming-pan, and the queen returned to it, sitting\nup in her white taffeta dressing-gown, and reading; or if any one who\nhad permission to visit her at that hour wished to see her, she took up\nher embroidery.  This kind of visit, at a person's rising, is customary\nabroad; and it had been so long so at the court of France, that certain\nclasses of persons were understood to have a right to visit the queen at\nthe hour of her levee, as it was called.  These persons were the\nphysicians and surgeons of the court; any messengers from the king; the\nqueen's secretary and others; so that there were often, besides the\nladies in waiting, ten or a dozen persons visiting the queen as she sat\nup in bed, at work, or taking her breakfast.\n\nThe great visiting hour, however, was noon, when the queen went into\nanother room to have her hair dressed.  We see in prints, how the hair\nwas dressed at that time,--frizzed and powdered, and piled up with silk\ncushions, and ribbons and flowers, till the wonder was how any head\ncould bear such a weight.  It took a long time to dress a lady's hair in\nthose days.  The queen sat before a most splendid toilet-table, in the\nmiddle of the room.  The ladies who had been in waiting for twenty-four\nhours now went out, and gave place to others in full dress, with\nrose-coloured brocade petticoats, wide hoops, and high head-dresses with\nlappets, and all the finery of a court.  The usher took his place before\nthe folding-doors; great chairs and stools were set in a circle for such\nvisitors as had a right to sit down in the presence of royalty.  Then\nentered the ladies of the palace, the governess of the royal children,\nthe princes of the royal family, the secretaries of state, the captains\nof the guard, and, on Tuesdays, the foreign ambassadors.  According to\ntheir rank, the queen either nodded to them as they entered, or bowed\nher head, or leaned with her arm upon her toilet-table, as if about to\nrise.  This last salutation was only to the royal princes.  She never\nactually rose, for her hair-dresser was powdering her hair.\n\nIt was considered presumptuous and dangerous to alter any customs of the\ncourt of France; but this queen thought fit to alter one among others.\nIt had always, before her time, been the etiquette for the lady of the\nhighest rank who appeared in readiness in the queen's chamber, to slip\nher majesty's petticoats over her head in dressing; but when her majesty\nwas pleased to have her head dressed so high that no petticoat would go\nover it, but must be slipped up from her feet, she used to step into her\ncloset, to be dressed by her favourite milliner and one of her women.\nThis change gave great offence to the ladies who thought they had a\nright to the honour of dressing the queen.\n\nHer majesty came forth from her closet ready to go to mass in the\nchapel, on certain days: and by this time her chaplains were in waiting\namong her suite.  The royal princesses and their trains stood waiting to\nfollow the queen to the chapel: but, strangely enough, this was the hour\nappointed for signing deeds of gift on the part of the queen.  These\ngifts were too often licences for the exclusive sale of articles which\nall should have been left free to sell.  The secretary of the queen\npresented the pen to her majesty; and at these hours she signed away the\ngoodwill of thousands of well-disposed subjects.  At such a moment,\nwhile she stood, beautiful and smiling, among a crowd of adorers, and\nwhile her husband, with smutted face and black hands, was filing his\nlocks in his attic, how little did either of them think that their\neldest son was sinking to his grave, and that the storm of popular fury\nwas even now growling within their dominions,--the tremendous storm\nwhich was to prove fatal to themselves!\n\nAt this hour of the toilet, on the first day of the month, the queen was\npresented with her pocket-money for the month--the sum which she might\ndo what she liked with, and out of which she made presents.  This sum\nwas always in gold, and was presented in a purse of white kid,\nembroidered in silver, and lined with white silk.  Its amount was, on an\naverage for the year round, 12,500 pounds.  It was by saving out of this\nallowance that she paid for the pair of diamond ear-rings which she\nbought soon after her marriage; but it took six years' savings to pay\nfor that one ornament.  She was young and giddy when she bought those\njewels, and she paid for them out of her own pocket-money; but, as has\nbeen seen, the purchase did not sound well in the ears of peasants who\nboiled nettles for food when they could get no bread, from the pressure\nof the taxes.  Whether the discontented knew it or not, a good deal of\nthis monthly gold went in charity--charity, however, which did not do\nhalf the good that self-denial would have done.\n\nHer majesty was waited on at dinner by her ladies.  She dined early,\ngenerally eating chicken, and drinking water only.  She supped on broth,\nor the wing of a fowl, and biscuits which she steeped in water.  She\nspent the afternoons among her ladies, or with her two most intimate\nfriends--the Duchess de Polignac, for some time governess to the royal\nchildren, and the Princess de Lamballe, superintendent of the household.\nAfter a time the friendship with both these ladies cooled; but while it\nlasted, the pleasantest hours the queen passed were when working and\nconversing with these ladies.  After the private theatre was given up,\nthe evenings were commonly spent in small dull card-parties, but\nsometimes in more agreeable parties in the apartments of one or other of\nher two friends.  It was thoughtless and undignified of the queen to act\nplays, to which the captains of the guard, and various other persons,\nwere in time admitted as spectators; but though her best friends would\nhave been glad that she should have abstained from such performances, it\nis not surprising that she inclined to an amusement that gave her\nsomething to think of and to do, and from which she really learned more\nof literature than she could otherwise have done.  Amidst the deplorable\ndulness of such a life as hers, we cannot wonder that studying some of\nthe best French dramatic poetry, and feeling for the hour that she was\nthe companion and not the queen, should have been a pleasure which she\nwas sorry to forego.  She sorely lamented afterwards that she had ever\nindulged in it.\n\nBut, it may be said, she had children and she had friends.  Could she\nnot make herself happy with them?  Alas!  She found herself disappointed\nthere,--as she was whichever way she turned for happiness.  Though her\nfriend, the Duchess de Polignac, was governess to her children, and\nthough she had hoped by this plan to enjoy more freedom with both than\nby any other means, all went wrong.  The other gentlemen and ladies--the\ntutors and under-governesses who were about the children--became jealous\nof the duchess, and taught the children to dislike her.  The Princess de\nLamballe also had misunderstandings with the duchess; and the queen and\nher children's governess began to be equally hated by the people, who\nbelieved that the duchess instigated the queen to all the bad actions of\nwhich she was reported guilty.\n\nThe Duke of Normandy was three years old when the serious misfortunes of\nhis family began.  Up to that time he had seen only what was bright and\ngay.  He himself was a little rosy, plump, merry child, with beautiful\ncurling hair, and so sweet a temper that everybody loved him.  He found\nmany to love.  There was his beautiful, kind mother.  She could not do\nfor him what a mother of a lower rank would have done; she could not\nwash and dress him, and keep him on her lap, or play with him half the\nday, or walk in the sweet, fresh fields with him--but she often opened\nher arms to him, and always smiled upon him, and loved him so much, that\nsome ill-natured people persuaded his elder brother, the Dauphin, that\nthe little Duke of Normandy was his mother's favourite, and that she did\nnot care for her other children.\n\nThen there was the Princess Royal, the eldest of the children.  She was\nat that time eight years old, and as grave a little girl as was ever\nseen at that age.  She rarely laughed or played, but she was kind to her\nbrothers and the people about her.\n\nNext was the Dauphin, a year younger than his sister.  He was sinking\nunder disease; and it made every one's heart ache to see his long sharp\nface, and his wasted hands, and his limbs, so shrunk and feeble that he\ncould not walk.  His tutor could not endure the duchess, his governess,\nand taught the poor fretful child to be rude to her, and even to his\nmother.  When the duchess came near to amuse him, he told her to go\naway, for he could not bear the perfumes that she was so dreadfully fond\nof.  This was put into his head, for she used no perfumes.  When the\nqueen carried to her poor boy some lozenges that she knew could not hurt\nhim, and that he was fond of, the under-tutors, and even a footman of\nthe Dauphin, started forward, and said she must give him nothing without\nthe advice of the physicians.  She knew that these were the very people\nwho were always putting it into the Dauphin's head that, she was more\nfond of his little brother, and she saw that it was intended to prevent\nher having any influence with her own sick child; and bitterly she wept\nover all this in her own apartment.\n\nOne day, some Indian ambassadors were to visit the king in great\nsplendour, and it was known that there would be a crowd of people in the\ncourts and galleries to see them.  The queen desired that the Dauphin\nmight not be encouraged to think of seeing this sight, as it would be\nbad for him, and she could not have him exposed, deformed and sickly, to\nthe gaze of a crowd of people.  Notwithstanding her desire, the\nDauphin's tutor helped him to write a letter to his mother, begging that\nhe might see the ambassadors pass.  She was obliged to refuse him.  When\nshe reproached the tutor with having caused her and her boy this pain,\nhe replied that the Dauphin wished to write, and he could not vex a sick\nchild--the very thing which he compelled the mother to do, after having\nfixed the subject in the boy's mind, and raised his hopes.\n\nThere was another sister, younger than the Duke of Normandy--quite a\nbaby.  The Duke of Normandy used to see this little baby every day, and\nkiss her, and hear her crow, and see her stretch out her little hand\ntowards the lighted wax candles, which made the palace almost as light\nas day.  One morning, baby was not to be seen: everybody looked grave:\nhis mother's eyes were red, and her face very sad.  Baby was dead; and,\nyoung as he was, Louis did not forget Sophie immediately.  He saw and\nheard things occasionally which put him in mind of baby for long\nafterwards.\n\nThere was one more person belonging to the family, whom the children and\neverybody dearly loved.  This was their aunt Elizabeth, the king's\nsister, a young lady of such sweet temper--so religious, so humble, so\ngentle--that she was a blessing wherever she went.  She disliked the\nshow and formality of a life at court, and earnestly desired to become a\nnun.  The king and queen loved her so dearly that they could not bear\nthe idea of her leaving them.  They devised every indulgence they could\nthink of to vary the dulness of the court.  The king declared her of age\ntwo years before the usual time, and gave her a pretty country-house,\nwith gardens, where she might spend her time as she pleased; and he\nencouraged her taking long country rides, as she was fond of\nhorse-exercise.  At last, when she was full of gratitude for her\nbrother's kindness, he begged her to promise not to become a nun before\nshe was thirty, when, if she still wished it, he would make no further\nopposition.  She promised.  We shall see, by-and-by, what became of this\nsweet princess when she was thirty.\n\nShe was at this time twenty-three years old.  She was a great comfort to\nthe queen, not concealing from her that she thought the Dauphin was\ndying, and the nation growing very savage against the royal family; but\nendeavouring to console and strengthen her mind, as religious people are\nalways the best able to do.  The poor queen began to want comfort much.\nShe went to bed very late now, because she could not sleep; and a little\nanecdote shows that her anxieties made her again as superstitious as she\nhad formerly been, when she dreaded misfortune because she was born on\nthe day of the great earthquake at Lisbon.\n\nOn the table of her dressing-room, four large wax candles were burning\none evening.  Before they had burned half-way down, one of them went\nout.  The lady-in-waiting lighted it.  A second went out immediately,\nand then a third.  The queen in terror grasped the lady's arm, saying,\n\"If the fourth goes out, I shall be certain that it is all over with\nus.\"  The fourth went out.  In vain the lady observed that these four\ncandles had probably been all run in the same mould, and had therefore\nthe same fault.  The queen allowed this to be reasonable, but was still\nmuch impressed by the circumstance.\n\nFor one of the impending evils there was no remedy.  The Dauphin died\nthe next June, when the Duke of Normandy, then four years old, became\nDauphin.  It may give some idea of the formality of the court\nproceedings to mention that, when a deputation of the magistrates of\nParis came, according to custom, to view the lying-in-state, the usher\nof the late Dauphin announced to the dead body, as he threw open the\nfolding-doors, that the magistrates of Paris had come to pay their\nrespects.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE DAUPHIN LOSES HIS GOVERNESS.\n\nLittle Louis had no cause to rejoice in his new honours.  Much more\nobservance was paid to him within the palace, now that he had become\nheir to the throne; but out of doors all was confusion: and five weeks\nfrom his brother's death had not passed before the little prince had to\nendure one of those fits of terror of which he had but too much\nexperience from that time forward.\n\nThe two principal royal palaces were, that called the Tuileries, in\nParis, and that of Versailles, twelve miles from Paris.  At this time,\nJuly, 1789, the royal family were at Versailles.  The discontented,\nlong-murmuring people of Paris rose in rebellion, because their\nfavourite minister, Necker, who had managed the money affairs of the\nnation well, and was more likely to take off taxes than any other\nminister, had been dismissed from his office.  The nation were\ndetermined to have him back again; but, having once risen in rebellion,\nthey aimed at more achievements than one.  On the 14th of July the\npeople of Paris besieged and took the Bastille, the great state-prison,\nwhere, for hundreds of years, victims had suffered cruel imprisonments,\noften without having been tried.  The very sight of this gloomy castle\nwas odious to the people; and they pulled it down, leaving not one brick\nupon another, and carrying the prisoners they found there on their\nshoulders through the city, in triumphant procession.\n\nWhile this attack on the Bastille was taking place, there was a ball\ngiven in the orangery at Versailles, where the court ladies and the\nofficers of the troops danced, and laughed, and talked, and took their\nrefreshments, as if all was well.  The French Parliament was sitting in\nthe town of Versailles; and they sent some of their body repeatedly that\nday to the palace, to tell the king of the danger, and urge him to do\nwhat was proper: but there was no moving the king to do anything, that\nday, any more than on other occasions; and he only sent word to the\nparliament to mind their own business.  The inhabitants of Versailles\nwere alarmed at the reports that arrived from Paris, and they were all\non the watch, consulting in the streets, or wondering in their own\nhouses what would happen next.  Some vague rumours reached the palace;\nbut the court ladies and their guests danced away in the orangery, till\nthe time for breaking up the ball arrived.  Late at night, a nobleman\nwho had a right to demand an audience of the king at all times, arrived,\nmade his way, dusty as he was, to the king's chamber, and told of the\nrebellion, the destruction of the Bastille, and the murder of two\nfaithful officers, well-known to the king.  \"Why,\" said the king, as\nmuch surprised as if nothing had happened to warn him, \"this is a\nrevolt.\"\n\n\"It is not a revolt,\" said the nobleman: \"it is a revolution.\"\n\nThe Dauphin was fast asleep when this alarm arrived.  He saw, the next\nmorning, that every one about him was in terror, and that the courts of\nthe palace were filled with a crowd of ill-looking angry people.  His\ngoverness appeared greatly alarmed; and well she might be; for the mob\noutside were shouting her name, and saying that they would be revenged\non her for giving the queen bad advice.  The king had gone to address\nthe parliament, promising to do all that they had advised the day\nbefore, and to recall Monsieur Necker, the favourite minister.  While he\nwas gone, one of the queen's ladies came to the room where Louis was\nwith his governess, unlocked the door with the queen's key, and told him\nthat he was to go with her to his mother.  The Duchess de Polignac asked\nwhether she might not take him herself to the queen: but the lady\nmessenger shook her head, and said she had no such orders.  She knew\nvery well that if the people who were looking up at the windows should\nonce see the duchess, they would be ready to pull her to pieces.  The\nduchess, understanding the lady's countenance, took the child in her\narms, and wept bitterly.  Louis did not know what it all meant; but it\nfrightened him.  The messenger tried to console the duchess with\npromising to bring Louis back presently; but she said, weeping, that she\nknew too well now what to expect.  One of the under-governesses asked\nwhether she might take the prince to his mother, and did so.\n\nThe queen was waiting for the boy, with the Princess Royal by her side.\nShe stepped out into the balcony with her two children, and repeatedly\nkissed them in the sight of the people.  Little Louis might well be glad\nto step back from the balcony into the room again; for the mob was very\nnoisy and rude.  The lady who had been sent to summon him slipped out\namong the people, to hear what they were saying.  A woman, who kept a\nthick veil down over her face, seized her by the arm, told her she knew\nher, and desired her to tell the queen not to meddle any more in the\ngovernment, but to leave it to those who cared more for the people.  A\nman then grasped her other arm, and said he knew her too, and bade her\ntell the queen that times were coming very different from those which\nwere past.  Just then, the queen and the children appeared in the\nbalcony.  \"Ah!\" said the veiled woman, \"the duchess is not with her.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the man, \"but she is still in the palace, working underground\nlike a mole: but we will dig her out.\"  The queen's lady had heard quite\nenough.  She was glad to go in and sit down, for she could scarcely\nstand.  She thought it her duty to tell the queen what she had heard;\nand the queen made her repeat it to the king.\n\nOne of the king's aunts was at her tapestry-work that day, in a room\nwhich looked towards the court, and where there was a window-blind\nthrough which she could see without being seen.  Three men were talking\ntogether; and she knew one of them.  They did not whisper, or speak low;\nand one of them said, looking up at the window of the throne-room,\n\"There stands that throne of which there will soon be left no remains.\"\n\nWhile such a temper as this was abroad, it mattered little that\neverything seemed set right for the time by what the king said to the\nparliament.  The members escorted him back to the palace, and the people\ncheered him.  All Paris cheered when the news arrived that the people's\nminister was to be restored to his office; and a messenger was sent off\nto Monsieur Necker that night.\n\nThe Duchess de Polignac and her relations now saw that they must be off,\nif they wished to preserve their liberty--perhaps their lives.  After\nthe next day, Louis never saw his governess more.  She bade him\ngood-night at his bed time; and in the morning she was far away.  She\nwent disguised as a lady's maid, and sat on the coach-box, leaving the\npalace just at midnight.  The queen bade her farewell in private, with\nmany and bitter tears, forgetting any coolness that had lately existed\nbetween them in the thought of their former friendship, and the care the\nduchess had taken of her children.  The duchess was not rich; and the\nqueen, after they had parted, sent her a purse of gold, with a message\nthat she might want it on the journey.\n\nIt was a perilous journey.  The party consisted of six, of whom two were\ngentlemen.  When they arrived at Sens they found the people had risen.\nThe mob stopped the carriage to ask, as they had been asking of other\ntravellers who came the same road, if those Polignacs were still about\nthe queen.  \"No, no,\" said one of the gentlemen, \"they are far enough\nfrom Versailles.  We have got rid of all such bad subjects.\"  The next\ntime the carriage stopped, the postilion stood on the step, and\nwhispered to the duchess, \"Madam, there are some good people in France.\nI found out who you were at Sens.\"  They gave him a handful of gold.\n\nThe queen wept the more bitterly on parting with her friend, because she\nwould have been glad to have gone away too.  It was talked of: and some\nof the king's relations, with their families, set off the same night as\nthe Polignacs, and were soon out of danger beyond the frontier.  The\nquestion had been whether the king should go with them, or show himself\nin Paris, and endeavour to come to an understanding with his people.\nThis question was debated for some hours by the royal family and their\nconfidential friends; and the king let them argue, hour after hour,\nwithout appearing to have any will of his own.  \"Well,\" said he, when he\nwas tired of listening, \"something must be decided.  Am I to go or stay?\nI am as ready for one as the other.\"  It was then decided that he\nshould stay.  The queen, meanwhile, had been making preparations for\ndeparture, in hopes that they should go.  She probably saw that it would\nhave been all very right to stay if the king meant to act vigorously,\nand to save the monarchy by joining with the nation to reform the\ngovernment; but that, since acting vigorously was the one thing which\nthe king could not do, it would have been better for all parties that he\nshould have left a scene where his apathy could only do mischief,\nexasperate the people, and endanger his own safety and that of his\nfamily.  The queen had burned a great many papers, and had her diamonds\npacked in a little box, which she meant to take in her own carriage: she\nhad also written a paper of directions to her confidential servants\nabout following her.  As she saw her jewels restored to their places,\nand tore the paper of directions, with tearful eyes, she said she feared\nthat this decision would prove a misfortune to them all.\n\nThe king was next to go to Paris.  He set out from Versailles at ten in\nthe morning after the departure of the Polignacs.  He was well attended,\nand appeared, as usual, very composed.  The queen kept her feelings to\nherself till he was gone; but she had terrible fears that he would be\ndetained as a prisoner in his own capital.  She shut herself up with her\nchildren in her own apartment.  There she felt so restless and miserable\nthat she sent for one after another of the courtiers.  Their doors were\nall padlocked--every one of them.  The courtiers considered it dangerous\nto stay; and they were all gone.  Though this afflicted the queen at the\nmoment, it happened very well; for it taught her to place no dependence\non these people another time.  It must have been a dreary morning for\nthe children,--their father in danger, their governess gone, and their\nmother weeping, deserted by her court.  She employed herself in writing\na short address, to be spoken to the National Assembly at Paris (which\nmay be called the people's new parliament), in case of the king not\nbeing allowed to return.  She meant to go with her children, and beg of\nthe Assembly that they might share the lot of the king, whatever it\nmight be.  As she learnt by heart what she had written (lest she should\nnot have presence of mind to make an address at the time), her voice was\nchoked with grief, and she sobbed out, \"They will never let him return.\"\n\nHe did return, however, late in the evening.  He had had a weary day.\nHe had been received with gloom, and with either silence or insulting\ncries.  It was not till, at the desire of the mayor of Paris, he had put\nthe new national cockade in his hat, that the people cheered him; after\nwhich they were in good humour.  This cockade was made of the three\ncolours which are now seen in the tricolour flag of France,--red and\nblue, the ancient colours of the city of Paris, with the white of the\nroyal lilies between.  In these troubled times a white cockade was a\nwelcome sight to royal eyes, as an emblem of loyalty; while red and blue\ncolours were detestable, as tokens of a revolutionary temper.  When the\nking himself was compelled to wear them, it was a cruel mortification.\nIt was, in fact, a sign of submission to his rebellious people.  Glad\nindeed was he to get home this night, and endeavour to forget that he\nhad worn the tricolor.  He kept repeating to the queen what he had said\nin the hearing of many this day, \"Happily, there was no blood shed; and\nI swear that not a drop shall be shed by my order, happen what may.\"\nThese were the words of a humane man: but it was hardly prudent to speak\nthem during the outbreak of a revolution, when they might discourage his\nfriends, and embolden the violent.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: The Fleur-de-Lys (lily) was blazoned in the royal arms of France\nfor many centuries.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. LAST NIGHT AT VERSAILLES.\n\nFrom this day forward the king met with insults whichever way he\nturned,--even at the doors of his own apartments.  It was resolved by\nthe National Assembly that all the men in France should be armed and\nwear a uniform, and be called the National Guard.  One day the Dauphin's\nfootmen all appeared in this uniform, and the king's porters, and almost\nevery man about the palace.  What displeased the king yet more was, that\nthe singers in the royal chapel appeared in the same dress.  It was\nabsurd and shocking to see their part of divine service performed by men\nin the uniform of grenadiers.  The king said so, and forbade that any\nperson should appear in his presence again in that dress.  But the time\nwas past for the king's orders to be obeyed.  He was destined to grow\nweary enough of the sight of this uniform.\n\nA great part of the king's own guard had joined the revolutionary party;\nbut one company remained, whose commanding officer was proud of their\nloyalty, and declared he could answer for its continuance.  He was\nmistaken, however.  One morning, at the end of July, when the royal\nfamily rose and looked out from their windows, they did not see a single\nsentinel anywhere about the palace.  Such a sight had never been\nwitnessed before as the palace of Versailles without a guard.  On\ninquiry, it turned out that the whole company had marched away in the\nnight, to join their former comrades in Paris.\n\nDuring the month of August, crowds had at various times assembled in\nParis, with the declared purpose of going to Versailles, to separate the\nking from his bad advisers, and to bring the little Dauphin to Paris, to\nbe brought up better than he was likely to be at home.  One would think\nthat such assemblages and such declarations would alarm the king and\nqueen, and cause them to make some preparations for putting themselves,\nor at least the Dauphin, in safety.  Because these crowds were several\ntimes dispersed, however, the royal family appear to have thought\nnothing of the danger: and in September they committed an act of\nimprudence which brought upon them the worst that was threatened.  The\ntruth is, they were ignorant of all that it most concerned them to know.\nThey did not understand the wants of the people, nor the depth of their\ndiscontent; nor had they any idea of the weakness, ignorance, and\nprejudice of the gentlemen and ladies about them, whose advice they\nasked, and on whose narrow views they acted.  There were a few wise and\ngood men in the nation who understood both sides of the question, and\nwho were grieved for the hardships of the people, and for the sufferings\nof the royal family; and happy would it have been for all if the king\nand queen could have been guided by these advisers.  The chief and best\nof these was that excellent patriot and loyal subject the Marquis\nLafayette.  While he was adored by the people, he did all in his power\nto aid and save the royal family; but, unhappily, the king distrusted\nhim, and the queen could not endure him.  She not only detested his\npolitics, but declared that she believed him (the most honourable man in\nthe world) to be a traitor, and laid on him the blame of misfortunes\nwhich he had no hand in causing, and for which he grieved.\n\nThe king had a regiment from Flanders on whom he was sure he could rely.\nIt came into some one's head that if this regiment and the faithless\nbody-guard could be brought together, the loyalty of the latter might be\nrevived and secured.  So there was an entertainment given in the theatre\nof the palace of Versailles, where the soldiers of the two regiments\nwere to make merry, sitting alternately at table.  Such a feast, if\nevery man there was loyal in the extreme, could signify little, while\nthere was out of doors a whole rebellious nation,--millions of hungry\nwretches clamouring for food and good government; and, whether such a\nmeeting signified much or little, it was certain that the king and his\nfamily, should have had nothing to do with it, after he had been to\nParis to assure the people of his reliance upon them, assuming their\ncockade as a declaration that he was in earnest.\n\nThe friends of the royal family thought this,--even the queen's own\nladies.  One of them was requested by the queen to enter the theatre,\nand observe what passed, in order to report it to the king and her.\nWhat was the surprise of this lady, when in the midst of the\nentertainment, the doors were thrown open, and their majesties appeared,\nthe queen having the Dauphin in her arms!  The sight of them, looking\ngratified and trustful, roused all the loyalty of the soldiers present;\nand some imprudent acts were done.  The queen's ladies handed white\ncockades to the officers; the party drank the healths of the king and\nqueen, omitting that of the nation; they cheered the loyal air, \"O,\nRichard!  O my king, the world is all forsaking thee:\" and the whole\ncompany were presently in a delirium of hope, and of defiance of the\npeople of Paris.  The queen afterwards declared in public that she was\ndelighted with the Thursday's entertainment; and this set the people\ninquiring what had delighted her so much.  They made many inquiries.\n\"Why was this Flanders regiment brought to Versailles?\"\n\n\"How did it happen that the king had at present double the usual number\nof his Swiss guards?\"\n\n\"Where were all those foreign officers from, who were seen in the\nstreets in strange uniforms?\"  The people, exasperated afresh by finding\nthat, though the harvest was over, there was still a scarcity of bread,\nwere in a temper to believe the worst that was told them; and it seems\nnow very probable that much of it was true.  They were told that these\nsame soldiers had breakfasted together, and that they had planned to\nmarch upon the National Assembly, and destroy it.  They heard a report\nthat the king meant to go away to Metz, and to return at the head of an\narmy, and to crush all those who had risen against him.  Nothing could\nnow prevent the people from doing what they had threatened--going to\nVersailles, to separate the king from his evil counsellors, and bring\nthe Dauphin to Paris.  Some went further than this, saying to General\nLafayette that the king was too weak to reign; that they would destroy\nhis guards, make him lay down his crown, and declare the Dauphin king,\nwith Lafayette and others to manage the affairs of the empire till the\nboy should be of age.\n\nThis was said to Lafayette on the morning of the 5th of October.\nGrieved as he was to see that the mob were resolved to go to Versailles,\nhe saw what he must do, since he could not keep them back.  He detained\nthem as long as he could by speeches and arguments, while he sent\nmessengers by every road to Versailles, to give notice of what might be\nexpected; and he declared his intention of leading the march when the\npeople could be detained no longer.  Several of his messengers were\nstopped: but some who went by by-roads reached Versailles, and gave the\nalarm.  Meantime, he contrived to make the march so slow, as that he and\nhis thirty thousand followers were nine hours going the twelve miles to\nVersailles.  Lest the royal family should not be gone, as he hoped, he\nmade the crowd halt on the ridge of the hill which overlooked\nVersailles, and swear, with their right hands lifted up towards heaven,\nto respect the king's dwelling, and be faithful to the orders of the\nAssembly they themselves had chosen.  Unhappily, all he did was of\nlittle use.  He arrived at near midnight; but another mob--a mob of\nwomen, savage because their children were hungry--had been in possession\nof Versailles since three in the afternoon.\n\nThough it became rainy during the latter half of the day, so that the\nthousands out of doors were all wet to the skin, the morning had been\nfair; and the king went out hunting, as usual, while the queen spent the\nmorning at her favourite little estate of Trianon.  The Dauphin was at\nhome, with his new governess, the Marchioness de Tourzel, little\ndreaming, poor child, that there were people already on the road from\nParis who wanted to make him a king instead of his father.  One of the\nministers hearing unpleasant rumours, took horse, and went to try to\nfind the king.  He met him in the woods, some way from home, and\nconjured him to make haste back.  The king, however, rode as slowly as\npossible, till more messengers appeared with news that a mob of\ndesperate women was actually entering the avenue.  Then he had to spur\nhis horse; and he arrived safe.  The queen had returned before him.  She\nhad been sitting, alone and disconsolate, in her grotto at Trianon,\nreflecting on the miserable prospects of her family, when a line was\nbrought to her from one of the ministers, begging that she would hasten\nhome.  As soon as the king returned, orders were given to have the\ncarriages ready at the back doors of the palace; and the children (kept\nout of sight) were equipped for a journey.\n\nThe want of decision in the royal movements, as usual, ruined\neverything.  When the king had received and dismissed a deputation of\nthe women, there was a shout of \"Long live the king!\" and he then\nthought it would not be necessary to go.  Not long afterwards, when the\npeople were seen to be as angry as ever, and to be insulting the royal\nguard, the carriages were again ordered.  Some of them, empty, attempted\nto pass the back gates, to ascertain whether others might follow with\nthe family: but the mob were now on the watch, and the carriages were\nturned back.  The hour for escape was gone by.\n\nWhen little Louis was got ready for the journey, it was by candlelight,\nand past bedtime.  Perhaps he was not sorry when his things were taken\noff again, and he was laid in his bed, instead of getting into the\ncarriage on a pouring rainy night, to pass through or near a disorderly\nmob, who might be heard from within the palace crying \"Bread!  Bread!\"\n\nLittle Louis did not know all the disorders of that mob.  Thousands of\nwomen, wet to the skin, were calling out \"Bread!  Bread!\" till they were\nhoarse.  They threatened his mother's life, believing that to her\ninfluence and her extravagance it was owing that their children had no\nbread.  Some sat upon the cannon they had brought.  Some dried their wet\nclothes at the fires that blazed on the ground: and haggard and fierce\ndid the faces of both men and women look in the light of these fires.\nBy the orders of certain officers and members of the Assembly,\nprovisions were brought from the shops of Versailles; and groups were\nseen eating bread and sausages, and drinking wine, in the great avenue;\nand not there only, but in the House of Assembly itself,--the\nparliament-chamber of Versailles.  Hundreds of poor women, wet and\ndirty, rushed in there, and sat eating their sausages while the members\nwere in debate, breaking in sometimes with, \"What's the use of all this?\nWhat we want is bread.\"  The king was told of what was going forward;\nand yet it was six hours before he could make up his mind what answer to\ngive to the messages sent him by deputations from the rioters.  The\nanswer he gave at last, late at night, could be no other than that which\nthey chose to have; though the king was well aware that the people did\nnot know what they were asking, and that he should never be able to\nsatisfy them.  What they asked, and made him promise in writing, was an\nabundance of food--\"a free circulation of corn,\" as they called it,--\nbelieving that the wealthy, and the millers and bakers under them, kept\nlarge hidden stores of grain, in order that bread might be dear.\n\nLouis understood nothing of all this; but he was aware that all was\nconfusion and danger.  About two hours after midnight everybody in the\npalace was suddenly relieved, and led to believe that the danger was\npast.  General Lafayette entered, and pledged his life that they should\nbe safe: and everybody was accustomed to rely on Lafayette's word.  He\nhappened to be mistaken this time,--to think better of the temper of the\npeople outside than they deserved; but what he said he fully believed.\nWith him came some messengers from Paris, to entreat the king, among\nother things, to come and live among his people at Paris.  This was the\nvery thing the king was least disposed to do; but he dared not say \"No.\"\nHe promised to consider of it.  Lafayette and his companions then went\naway; and between two and three o'clock almost everybody but the guards\nwent to bed.\n\nI say _almost_ everybody.  The queen desired her ladies to go to rest;\nbut two of them were still uneasy and distrustful, and thought that the\nqueen's servants should not all sleep while thousands of people who\nhated her were round about the very doors.  They watched in the\nante-chamber: and it was their vigilance which saved her life.\n\nAbout five in the morning the Dauphin was snatched from his bed, and\ncarried into his father's room.  There were his mother, aunt, and\nsister; and his mother was in a passion of tears.  Clinging round the\nking's neck, she cried, \"O!  Save me!  Save me and my children!\"  There\nwas a dreadful noise.  Not only was there the clamour of an angry\nmultitude without, but a hammering and battering at all the doors, and\nfierce cries, and clashing of arms--all the dreadful sounds of\nfighting--from the queen's apartments.  The mob had indeed forced their\nway in.  Her two watchful ladies had heard the shout from the corridor,\ngiven by a faithful guard at the peril of his life, \"Save the queen!\"\nThey lifted her from her bed, threw a dressing-gown over her, and\nhurried her across a great apartment which divided her rooms from the\nking's.  This was her only way of escape, and even this appeared at\nfirst to be closed; for the door which led from the queen's\ndressing-room to this apartment--a door which was always kept fastened\non the inside--was now, by some accident, found to be locked on the\noutside.  It was a moment of dreadful suspense,--for the fighting behind\ncame nearer.  The ladies called so loud that a servant of the king's\nheard them, and ran to unlock the door.  Even as they crossed the large\napartment, the mob were battering at the doors.\n\nPresently some soldiers came from the town: and General Lafayette\nappeared, addressing the people in passionate speeches, in favour of\nrespecting the persons and dwelling of the royal family.  The palace was\nsoon cleared; but the terrors of the household did not disperse with the\nintruders who occasioned them.\n\nIt is believed that this sudden uproar was caused by a quarrel between\none of the body-guards and the people without.  Some shots were fired;\nand a young man, known to the mob, was killed.  They were instantly in a\nrage, shook at the gates, burst in, and, as they hated the queen most,\nsought her first.\n\nThis was the last night that the royal family ever spent in their palace\nof Versailles.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. A PROCESSION.\n\nIt was too plain to all now that everything must be yielded to the\npeople, if lives were to be saved.  As soon as it was light, Lafayette\nled into a balcony the commander of the Flanders regiment,--the\nbody-guard,--with a huge tricolor in his hat, instead of the royal white\ncockade.  All the soldiers of the regiment immediately mounted tricolor\ncockades, and were cheered by the mob.  The king appeared on the\nbalcony, with Lafayette, and they cheered him too; but some voices cried\nthat he must go to Paris.\n\nThe mob then demanded to see the queen.  She asked for her children; and\nthey were brought to her, probably not very willing to face the noisy\nmultitude.  She took Louis in her arms, and led his sister by the hand,\nand stepped out on the balcony, with Lafayette by her side.  There was a\nshout, \"No children!\"  It does not seem clear why the people would not\nhave the children too; but the queen believed that it was intended that\nsome one should shoot her as she stood, and that the children were not\nto be endangered.  She gently pushed them back, and bade them go in, and\nthen stepped forward in the sight of the people, with her hands and eyes\nraised to heaven.  Lafayette took her hand, and, kneeling reverently,\nkissed it.  This act turned the tide of the people's feelings, and they\ncheered the queen.  It was finely done of Lafayette, both for presence\nof mind and noble feeling.\n\nHere was the difference between the enraged people and their enlightened\nleaders.  Lafayette was a friend of the people, and an enemy to tyranny:\nbut he had not been ground down by poverty, reared in hunger and brutal\nignorance, and taught to hate proud and selfish oppressors with a cruel\nhatred.  Such was the difference between him and this wretched mob, whom\nwe feel more disposed to pity than to blame, so great was their\nignorance, and so terrible had been the sufferings of their lives.\nLafayette's eyes were opened by knowledge and reflection, while theirs\nwere closed by passion and prejudice.  They believed that all royal\nrulers were wicked, and the queen the most wicked of all; and that if\nshe were but out of the way, with a few more, all would go right,--bread\nwould be cheap, the nobility less extravagant and oppressive, and the\nking willing to govern by men of the people's choice.  Lafayette saw\nthat all this was very foolish.  He saw that nothing could be worse than\nthe state of France,--the tyranny of the nobility,--the extravagance and\nfrivolity of the court,--and the wretchedness of the people.  He was for\namending all this; but he knew that these sins and woes were the growth\nof many centuries, and that no one person, or dozen of persons, was to\nbe blamed as the cause.  He probably saw that the queen was as ignorant\nin one way as the mob in another; and was therefore to be pitied.  She\nhad never been taught what millions of people were suffering, and did\nnot know how to frame her conduct so as to spare their irritated and\nwounded feelings: and therefore she had filled up her youth with shows\nand pleasures, and from year to year given to her dependents the means\nof enriching themselves at the expense of the poor, without being in the\nleast aware of the mischief she was doing.  It was in the knowledge of\nall this, in deep sorrow and compassion for both parties in this great\nquarrel, and with an earnest desire to bring them to bear with each\nother, that Lafayette kissed the queen's hand in the balcony.  His heart\nmust have beat with hope and gladness when he heard the people\nimmediately shout, \"Long live the queen!\"\n\nAgain the cry was, \"The king to Paris!\" and still the king was as\nunwilling as ever to go.  He wished to consult the Assembly about it,\nand sent to ask them to come, and hold their sitting in the palace.\nWhile they were deliberating whether to do so, the mob became so\nperemptory, so noisy, that the king dared no longer hesitate.  He did\nthe same thing now that no experience could teach him to avoid, in great\naffairs or small: he refused as long as possible what the people had set\ntheir hearts upon,--then hesitated, and at last had to yield, when it\nwas no longer possible to show any good grace in the action.  From his\nfailures a lesson might be taken by all rulers of a nation which has\nlearned to have a will of its own, and to speak it:--a lesson to grant\nwith readiness and a good grace what must be, or ought to be yielded,\nand to refuse with firmness what ought not to be granted.  Louis the\nSixteenth never could even get so far as to settle in his own mind what\nought, and what ought not to be granted; and unhappily there was no one\nabout him well-qualified to advise.  The queen was firm and decided; but\nshe was so deficient in knowledge that she was always as likely to guide\nhim wrong as right.  Now, however, there was no longer room for doubt.\nThe king said from the balcony, \"My children, you wish that I should\nfollow you to Paris.  I consent, on condition that you do not separate\nme from my wife and children.\"  He also stipulated that his guards\nshould be well treated; to which the multitude consented.\n\nIt was, however, far from their intention that the king should _follow_\nthem to Paris.  They did not mean to lose sight of him, for fear he\nshould slip away.  They caused General Lafayette to fix the hour at\nwhich the king would go.  One o'clock was fixed.\n\nTill one, the royal grooms were preparing the carriages to convey the\nroyal family and suite,--a long train of coaches.  The servants in the\npalace were packing up what they could for so hurried a removal.  The\nroyal children did no lessons that day, I should think; for Madame de\nTourzel, who was to go with them, must have been in great terror for the\nwhole party.  Lafayette was establishing what order he could, riding\nabout, pale and anxious, to arrange what was called the Parisian army.\nFor two nights (and what nights!) he had not closed his eyes.  The\npeople meantime searched out some granaries, and loaded carts with the\ncorn, to take with them to Paris.\n\nA more extraordinary procession was perhaps never seen.  Royal\ncarriages, and waggons full of corn,--the king's guards and the\nragamuffin crowd; round the king's carriage a mob of dirty, fierce\nfish-women and market-women, eating as they walked, and sometimes\nscreaming out close at the coach-door, \"We shall not want bread any\nmore.  We have got the baker, and the baker's wife, and the little\nbaker's boy:\"--such was the procession.  There was another thing in it\nwhich the king and queen saw, but which we must hope the children did\nnot,--the heads of two body-guards who had been killed early in the\nmorning, in the quarrel which led to the attack upon the queen.\n\nThe queen sat in her coach, seen by the vast multitude, for five long\nhours,--calm, dignified, and silent.  From one till two the royal\ncarriage had to stand, while the great procession was preparing to move;\nand it did not enter Paris till dusk,--till six o'clock.  It was still\nraining,--a dull, drizzling rain.  Louis could not have liked to hear\nhimself talked about as he was, by the loud dirty women that crowded\nround the coach; nor to hear them speak to his mother.  Some pointed to\nthe corn-waggons, and told her they had got what they wanted, in spite\nof her.  Some said, \"Come now, don't you be a traitor any more, and we\nwill all love you.\"  There were two hundred thousand people in this\nprocession.\n\nWhen they reached Paris, the royal family did not go straight home to\nthe Tuileries.  There was something to be done first.  They had to go to\nthe great city hall, to meet the authorities of Paris.  The mayor\nreceived them, and welcomed them to the city; and the king replied that\nhe always came with pleasure and confidence among his good people of\nParis.  In repeating what the king had declared to those assembled, the\nmayor forgot the word \"confidence.\"  The queen said aloud, \"Say\n_confidence_;--with pleasure and confidence.\"\n\nThen there were many speeches made, during which poor little Louis,\ntired as he was, had to wait.  Called up before five in the morning, and\nhaving sat so many hours in the carriage, with guns and pistols\nincessantly popping off, and yells and shouts from such a concourse of\npeople, he might well be tired: but before they could go home, the king\nhad to show himself in the balcony of the city hall, by torch-light,\nwith a great tricolor cockade in his hat.  It was just eleven o'clock\nbefore they got to their palace of the Tuileries.\n\nThere everything was comfortless,--for there had been no notice of their\ncoming.  The apartments had been occupied by the servants of the court,\nwho, turning out in a hurry, left everything in confusion.  Probably\nLouis did not mind this,--glad enough to get to bed at all after such a\nlong and dreary day.  This was the 6th of October.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. THE DAUPHIN AT PARIS.\n\nIn the morning of the 7th, some magistrates came, bringing upholsterers\nwith them, and asked the king how he would be pleased to be lodged.\nThey were ready to dispose and furnish the palace as he liked.  He\nanswered gruffly that others might lodge as they pleased, he had nothing\nto say to it.  He was apt to be sulky occasionally, in his most\nprosperous days; and it was natural that he should be more so now.\nSometimes, when the queen made anxious inquiries about the state of\naffairs, he answered, \"Madam, your affair is with the children.\"  He\nknew that he was, in fact, a prisoner in his own capital; and that it\nmust at any rate be long before he could leave it.  He was losing the\nfine hunting season; and there was no saying when he might hunt again.\nThis grieved him very much.  He sent for his locksmith, and did a little\nfiling, now and then; but he was losing his pleasure in everything.\n\nSome of the women who had walked by the royal carriage yesterday came\nthis morning, and stationed themselves before the queen's windows,\nrequesting to see her.  One of them told her that she must send away all\nbad advisers, and love the people.  The queen replied that she had loved\nthe people when she lived at Versailles, and that she should go on to\nlove them now.  They repeated to her some reports that they had heard\nagainst her,--that she had wished in the summer that Paris should be\nfired upon; and that she would yesterday have fled to the frontiers, if\nshe had not been prevented.  She replied that they had heard these\nthings, and believed them; and that while some people told and others\nbelieved what was not true, the nation and the king would never be\nhappy.  One woman then spoke a few words of German: but the queen\ninterrupted her, saying that she was now so completely a French woman,\nthat she had forgotten her German.  This delighted the women much; for\nsome of the jealousy of the queen which existed was on account of her\nbeing a foreigner.  They clapped their hands; and asked for the ribbons\nand flowers out of her hat.  She took them off with her own hands, and\ngave them to the women.  They divided them to keep; and they remained\nhalf an hour shouting, \"Long live Marie Antoinette!  Long live our good\nqueen!\"\n\nIt was found, during the whole long period of her residence where she\nnow was, that everybody who talked with the queen liked her;--her\nbitterest enemies were heard to shout as these women did, when once they\nhad heard her speak; and soldiers, who had spoken insultingly of her\nbefore they knew her, were ready to lay down their lives for her when\nthey became her guards.  The reason of this was, not merely that she was\nbeautiful, and that she spoke in a winning manner, when she knew how\nmuch depended upon her graciousness;--it was chiefly because the\nignorant and angry people had fancied her a sort of monster, determined\nupon her own indulgence at all cost, and even seeking their destruction,\nand delighting in their miseries.  When, instead of this monster, they\nfound a dignified woman, with sorrow in her beautiful face, and\ngentleness in her voice, they forgot for the time the faults she really\nhad, and the blameable things she had really done.  When again reminded\nof these, in her absence, the old hatred revived with new force; they\nwere vexed that she had won upon them, and ended by being as cruel as we\nshall see they were.\n\nShe found, this morning, how frightened her little boy had been, the day\nbefore.  There was some noise in the court-yard of the palace.  Louis\ncame running, and threw himself trembling into her arms, crying, \"O,\nmamma, is to-day going to be yesterday again?\"  When they were settled,\nand everything was done to make him as happy as a child should be, he\ndid not forget what he had seen and heard.  He not only walked with his\nmother, or with Madame de Tourzel, in the garden of the Tuileries, but\nhe had a little garden of his own, railed in, and a little tool-house\nfor his spade and rake.  There the rosy, curly-headed boy was seen\ndigging in the winter, and sowing seeds in the spring; and, sometimes,\nfeeding the ducks on the garden ponds with crumbs of bread.  Still he\ndid not forget what he had seen and heard.  One day, his father saw the\nboy looking at him very gravely and earnestly.  The king asked him what\nhe was thinking about.  Louis said he wanted to ask a very serious\nquestion, if he might; and the king gave him leave.\n\n\"I want to know,\" said Louis, \"why all the people who used to love you\nso much are now so angry with you.  I want to know what you have done to\nput them in such a passion.\"\n\nThe king took him upon his knee, and said,--\n\n\"My dear, I wished to make the people happier than they were before.  I\nwanted money to pay the expenses of our great wars.  I asked it of the\nparliament, as the kings of France have always done before.  The\nmagistrates who composed the parliament were unwilling, and said that\nthe people alone had a right to consent that this money should be given.\nI called together at Versailles the principal people of every town,\ndistinguished by their rank, their fortune, or their talents.  These\nwere called the States-General.  When they were assembled, they required\nof me things which I could not do, either for my own sake or yours; as\nyou are to be king after me.  Wicked persons have appeared, causing the\npeople to rebel; and the shocking things that have happened lately are\ntheir doing.  We must blame them and not the people.\"\n\nSo spoke Louis the Sixteenth to his young son: and from these words\n(among other evidence) we learn how little he was aware of the true\ncauses and nature of the great Revolution which was taking place.  It\nappears that he really thought this revolution was owing to the acts of\nthe last few months, and not to the long course of grinding oppression\nwhich had begun hundreds of years before he was born.  He believed that\nthe violence he witnessed was owing to the malice of a few \"wicked\npersons,\" and not to the exasperation of a nation,--the fury of many\nmillions of sufferers against a few hundreds of the rich and powerful.\nThis was not the first time of the king's showing how little he\nunderstood of what was taking place and what ought to be done.  When it\nwas absolutely necessary to the peace of the kingdom to have a minister\nwho would relieve the people of the heaviest taxes, the king removed\nsuch a minister, and thought he was doing what he could to make up for\nthis, by retrenching some expenses in the palace.  For instance, it had\nalways been the custom for the two first bed-chamber women of the queen\nto have for their own all the wax-lights placed daily in the whole suite\nof royal apartments, whether lighted or not.  These they sold for many\nhundred pounds a year.  When the king began to retrench, he took from\nthese women the wax-light privilege; and the candles which were not\nlighted one evening served for the next.  The ladies were not pleased at\nbeing thus deprived of a large part of their income; but this, with the\nfew other retrenchments made by the royal family, was right.  All these\nretrenchments were nothing, however, in comparison with what was wanted.\nThe peasantry still had to pay the grievous land-tax, even when they\nwere reduced to eat boiled nettles and grass.  The poor still had to buy\nthe quantity of dear salt ordered by law, even when they had no meat to\neat it with.  The labouring man and his sons, weakened by hunger and\nspent with toil, still had to turn out and work upon the roads, without\nwages, while wife and young children were growing savage with want in\ntheir ruined hut.  It was all very well for the king and queen to burn\nfewer wax-lights; but far happier would it have been could the monarch\nhave seen and known that the thing wanted was to relieve the poor from\nthese heavy oppressions; and that his duty was to uphold a minister who\nwould do it, even if every rich and noble person quitted his court, and\nturned against him.  This, however, was not to be expected; for the king\nand queen lived amongst, and were acquainted with, not the poor, but the\nnoble and the rich, and heard only what they had to say.\n\nIt is not known whether little Louis was ever told what the poor suffer.\nIt is probable that he heard something of it; for his elder brother and\nsister certainly had, upon one occasion.  It was the queen's custom to\ngive her children a stock of new playthings on New Year's Day.  One very\nhard winter, she and the king heard of the sufferings of the poor in\nParis from cold; and the king ordered a large quantity of wood to be\npurchased with his money, and given away.  The queen commanded the\ntoy-man to bring the new toys, as usual, on New Year's eve, and spread\nthem out in one of her apartments.  She then led the children in, showed\nthem the playthings, and said these were what she meant to have given\nthem; but that she had heard that so many poor families were perishing\nwith cold, that she hoped they would be willing to do without new toys,\nand let the money go for fuel for the poor.  The children agreed, and\nthe toy-man was sent away, with a present of money, to console him for\nthe disappointment of having sold nothing.  It is probable that Louis\nalso, when old enough to understand, was told of the sufferings of the\npoor: but it is difficult to give an idea of what want really is to\nchildren who have half-a-dozen ladies and footmen always at their\norders, and who are surrounded with luxuries which seem to them to come\nas naturally as the light of day, and to belong to them as completely as\ntheir own limbs and senses.  We have all heard of the little French\nprincess who, when told by her governess how many of the poor were dying\nof starvation, in a hard season, said, she thought that was very\nfoolish; and that, rather than starve, she would eat bread and cheese.\nShe had no idea that multitudes never tasted anything better than the\ncoarsest black dry bread; and that it was for want of this that many\nwere perishing.  How should she know?  She had never seen the inside of\na poor man's hut, or tasted any but the most delicate food.\n\nLouis wished to know what he ought to do, now that the people were so\nangry with his father.  The queen told him that he must behave civilly\nand kindly to the magistrates, when they came; to the officers of the\npeople's army,--the National Guard,--and to everybody that belonged to\nParis.  Louis took great pains to do this: and when he had an\nopportunity of speaking kindly to the mayor, or any other visitor, he\nused to run up to his mother, and whisper in her ear, \"Was that\nright?\"--He once said a thing which pleased the mayor of Paris very\nmuch.  The mayor showed him the shield of Scipio, which was in the royal\nlibrary, and asked him which he liked best, Scipio or Hannibal.  The boy\nanswered that he liked best him who had defended his own country.\n\nAt this time he read, not only of Scipio and Hannibal, but much besides.\nThe royal family, out of spirits, and not knowing what would happen\nnext, led a very quiet life in the Tuileries, from the 6th of October,\nwhen they were brought there, till the beginning of the next summer.\n\nDuring this season, the queen never went to the theatre.  She gave no\nconcerts, or large entertainments: and only received the court twice a\nweek, where everybody came wearing white lilies, and bows of white\nribbon, while tricolor cockades were sold at all the corners of the\nstreets; and the National Guards stopped all who did not show red and\nblue colours.  The queen went to mass, and dined in public with the\nking, twice a week, and joined small card-parties in the evenings.  The\nPrincess de Lamballe, who had returned to resume her office in the\npalace, gave gay parties; and the queen went a few times, but soon felt\nthat, in her circumstances, a private life was more suitable.  One\nevening she returned to her apartments in great agitation.  An English\nnobleman had been exhibiting a large ring which he wore, containing a\nlock of Oliver Cromwell's hair.  She looked with horror upon Cromwell,\nas a regicide; and she thought the English nobleman meant to point out\nto her what kings may come to when their people are discontented with\nthem.  It was probable that the gentleman meant no such thing: but he\nwas guilty of a very thoughtless act, which gave a great deal of pain.\n\nThe queen's mind was so full of the revolution, that she found she could\nnot fix her attention upon books.  Work suited her best; and she sat the\ngreater part of the morning working, with the Princess Elizabeth, at a\ncarpet intended for one of their apartments.  After breakfast she went\nto the king, to converse with him, if he was so inclined.  She then sat\nby, at work, while the children did their lessons, which was the regular\nemployment of the morning.  They all walked in the palace gardens; and\nthe queen returned to her work after dinner.  She could talk of nothing\nbut the revolution: and was extremely anxious to know what everybody\nthought of her,--particularly persons in office.  She was for ever\nwondering how it was that those who hailed her with love and joy, when\nshe came as a bride from Germany, should so fiercely hate her now.  It\nis a pity that she did not now learn to know and trust Lafayette.  It\nmight have saved her, and all who belonged to her; but she was\nprejudiced against him from his being a friend of the people, and in\nfavour of great changes in the government.\n\nThus the winter passed wearily on.  If the people of Paris were jealous\nof the queen's wish to get away, and suspicious of her meaning it, if\npossible, they were not far wrong.  Some or other of the nobles and\nclergy were continually planning to carry the royal family, either to\nRouen (a loyal city) or to the frontiers, to meet the king's brother and\nfriends, and the army they were raising.  It would probably have been\ndone, but for the king's irresolution.  He would neither speak nor stir\nabout it.\n\nOne night in March, at ten o'clock, when the children were asleep in\nbed, the king and queen were playing whist with his next brother and\nsister-in-law (who had not gone away), and the Princess Elizabeth was\nkneeling on a footstool beside the card table, looking on.  Monsieur\nCampan, one of the most trusty of the queen's attendants, came in, and\nsaid, in a low voice, that the Count d'Inisdal had called to say that\neverything was planned for an escape.  The nobles who had contrived it\nwere collected to guard and accompany the king;--the National Guard\nabout the palace were gained over;--post horses were ready all along the\nroad;--the king had only to consent, and he might be off before\nmidnight.  The king went on playing his cards, and made no answer.  \"Did\nyou hear,\" said the queen, \"what Campan has been telling us?\"\n\n\"I hear,\" said the king; and still went on playing.  After a while, the\nqueen observed, \"Campan must have an answer of some kind.\"  Then, at\nlength, the king spoke.  \"Tell the Count d'Inisdal,\" said he, \"that I\ncannot consent to be carried off.\"  The queen repeated, \"The king cannot\n_consent_ to be carried off,\" meaning it to be clearly understood that\nhe would be very glad to go, if it could be so done as that he might say\nafterwards that he had had nothing to do with the plan.  The Count\nd'Inisdal was very angry at the message.  \"I see how it is,\" said he.\n\"We, the king's faithful servants, are to have all the danger, and all\nthe blame, if the scheme fails.\"  And off he went.\n\nThe queen would not give up her hopes that the nobles would understand\nhow glad the royal family would be to go, and would come for them.  She\nsat till past midnight wrapping up her jewels to carry away; and then\ndesired the lady who assisted her not to go to bed.  The lady listened\nall the night through, and looked out of the window many times; but all\nwas still, and no one but the guards was to be seen.  The queen observed\nto this lady that they should have to fly.  There was no saying to what\nlengths the rebellious people would go, she declared, and the danger\nincreased every day.\n\nThere was indeed no respite from apprehensions of danger.  About a month\nafter, on the 13th of April, there was a good deal of agitation in\nParis, from the debates in the Assembly having been very warm, and such\nas to make the people fear that the king would be carried away.\nLafayette promised the king that if he saw reason to consider the palace\nin danger, he would fire a great cannon on a certain bridge.  At night,\nsome accidental musket-shots were heard near the palace, and the king\nmistook them for Lafayette's cannon.  He went to the queen's apartments.\nShe was not there.  He found her in the Dauphin's chamber, with Louis\nin her arms.  \"I was alarmed about you,\" said the king.  \"You see,\" said\nshe, clasping her little son close, \"I was at my post.\"\n\nWhile thus suffering, and certainly not learning to love the people more\non this account,--while distrusting Lafayette, and knowing no one else\nwho could give them the knowledge and advice which would have been best\nfor them, the royal family were confirmed in their worst prejudices and\nerrors by letters which reached them from a distance.  Those who wished\nto write to them in their distress were naturally those who sympathised\nmost with them, and least with the people.  One instance shows how\nabsurd and mischievous such a correspondence was.  The Empress Catherine\nof Russia wrote to the queen, \"Kings ought to proceed on their course\nwithout troubling themselves about the cries of the people, as the moon\ntraverses the sky without regard to the baying of dogs.\"  Whether the\nqueen saw the folly of these words, and thought of the proper answer to\nthem,--that a king is a man, like those who cry to him for sympathy, but\nthe moon is not a dog,--we do not know; nor whether she perceived the\ninsolent wickedness of the sentence; but she saw the unfeeling absurdity\nof writing this to a king and queen who were actually prisoners in the\nhands of their subjects.  If the king had been active, decided, and\nequal to the dangers of the times, he would have made use of this winter\nin Paris to go among his people, and learn for himself what was the\nmatter, what they wanted, and how much could be done for peace and good\ngovernment: and then this correspondence from a distance might have done\nno harm: but, indolent and passive as he was, everything seemed to\nconspire to prevent all mutual understanding between him and the nation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. AT SAINT CLOUD.\n\nOne of his wishes was, to a certain degree, gratified at length.  He got\na little more hunting when June came.  To the surprise of the court, and\nmany besides, the royal family were quietly permitted to go to their\ncountry-house at Saint Cloud, a few miles from Paris, when the weather\nbecame too warm for a comfortable residence at the Tuileries.  The\nNational Guard followed them; but the king rode out daily, attended only\nby an officer of General Lafayette's staff.  The queen was guarded by\nanother of these officers, and the Dauphin by a third.\n\nIt seems rather strange that so much liberty should have been allowed,\nwhen so lately every precaution was taken to prevent the flight of the\nfamily.  During the past winter and spring, and the next season, the\nleaders of the revolution kept a constant watch upon the palace, and\nknew all that went on there.  They knew what persons were admitted at\nback doors to consult with the queen.  They also knew, after the family\nreturned from Saint Cloud, how many horses were in the royal stables,\nand how many of them stood constantly saddled and bridled.  They knew\nhow the royal carriages were kept stuffed with luggage, ready to start\nat a moment's warning,--the royal arms being nearly rubbed out from the\npanels.  They declared also that they knew that the king's old aunts\nmeant to go away, carrying off, not only plenty of treasure, but little\nLouis; and that a boy, very like Louis, had been in training for some\ntime, to represent him, when the true Dauphin should have been carried\nto his uncle, over the frontiers.  All this was published in the\nnewspapers, so that, if the old princesses had any such plan prepared,\nthey were obliged to give it up.  Thus were the family guarded in Paris,\nbefore and after, and yet, in June, they were riding and driving about\nSaint Cloud, believing that they might go off any day they chose.\nPerhaps, however, this might not have proved so easy as they thought.\nThere might have been spies about them that they did not know of; and,\nsince nothing could be worse than their management of all business\nmatters, from inexperience and want of knowledge of other people's minds\nand affairs, their enemies might feel pretty secure that the royal\nprisoners could not fly far without being caught.\n\nThere was a plan for escape completely formed, as we know from the lady\nto whom the queen confided it.  No one doubted of the entire success of\nthis scheme; and the lady daily expected and hoped to have to wait in\nvain for the return of the royal family from their drive.\n\nThey went out every afternoon at four o'clock; and often did not return\ntill eight, and sometimes even not till nine.  The king went on\nhorseback, attended by grooms and pages on whom he could rely.  The\nladies, in a carriage, were also followed by grooms and pages.  The plan\nwas for all to ride to the same place on a certain afternoon, by\ndifferent roads,--the king on horseback, the queen and her daughter, and\nthe princess Elizabeth, in a carriage; the Dauphin and Madame de Tourzel\nin a chaise; and some of the royal suite in other vehicles.  On meeting\nin a wood, twelve miles from Saint Cloud, the three officers of\nLafayette's staff were to be gained over, or to be overpowered by the\nservants; and then all were to push on for the frontier.  Meanwhile, the\npeople at home would wait till nine o'clock, quietly enough.  Then, on\nbecoming alarmed and looking about, they would find on the king's desk a\nletter to the Assembly, which they would instantly forward.  It could\nnot reach Paris before ten; and then the Assembly would not be sitting.\nThe president would have to be found; and the Assembly could hardly be\ngot together, or messengers sent after the fugitives, before midnight;\nwhen the royal family would have had a start of eight hours.\n\nThe lady to whom the queen confided this scheme approved it, but asked\nno questions, and hoped she should not be told the precise day, as she\nwas to be left behind, and wished to be able to say that she had not\nknown that they intended more than an afternoon drive when they went\nforth.  One June evening, nine o'clock came, and none of them were home.\nThe attendants walked restlessly about the courts, and wondered.  The\nlady's heart beat so that she was afraid her emotion would be observed.\nBut presently she heard the carriage-wheels; and all returned as usual.\nShe told the queen that she had not expected to see her home to-night:\nand the queen replied that they must wait till the king's aunts had left\nFrance, and till they knew whether the plan would suit the wishes of\ntheir friends over the frontier.\n\nIt was believed by many persons, and certainly by Lafayette, that there\nwere plots, at this time, against the life of the queen.  An agent of\nthe police gave notice of an intention to poison her.  The queen did not\nbelieve it.  She believed that her enemies meant to break her spirit by\ncalumny; but she had no fear of poison.  Her head physician, however,\nchose to take precautions.  He desired one of her ladies to have always\nat hand a bottle of fresh, good oil of sweet almonds, which, with milk,\nis an antidote against corrosive poisons.  He was uneasy at the queen's\nhabit of sweetening draughts of water from a sugar-basin which stood\nopen in her apartment.  He was afraid of this sugar being poisoned.  The\nlady therefore kept a great quantity of sugar pounded in her own\napartment, and always carried some packets of it in her bag, from which\nshe changed the sugar in the basin, several times a day.  The queen\nfound this out, and begged she would not take the trouble to do this, as\nshe had no fear of dying by that method.  Poor lady!  She said sometimes\nthat, but for her family's sake, she should be glad to die by any means.\nShe was indeed unhappy; but she had not yet learned how much more\nunhappy had been multitudes of her people before they hated her as they\nnow did.  She grieved to see her daughter growing up grave and silent,\nand her little boy of five years old surrounded by sorrowful faces, and\nsubject to terrors at an age when he should have been merry, and smiled\nupon by everybody near him: but she knew nothing of the affliction of\nthousands of mothers who had seen their children dying of hunger on\nheaps of straw, in hovels open to the rain; or of the indignation of\nthousands more who had seen their lively, promising infants growing\nstupid and cross under the pressure of early toil, and in the absence of\nall instruction.  All this had happened while she was paying 15,000\npounds for a pair of diamond ear-rings, and using her influence in\nbehalf of bad advisers to the king.  She might wish to die under her\nsorrows; she little knew how many had died under their most intolerable\nsufferings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8. THE ENTERPRISE.\n\nThe longer the revolution went on, exhibiting more and more fully the\nincapacity of the king, the more were the intoxicated people tempted to\nexult over him, sometimes fiercely, and sometimes in mockery.  It is not\nconceivable that they would have ventured upon some things that were\nsaid and done, if the king had been a man of spirit; for men of spirit\ncommand personal respect in their adversity.  The great original quarrel\nwith the king, it will be remembered, was on matters of finance,--about\nthe vast debts of the State, and the choice of a minister who would\nwisely endeavour to reduce these debts, and at the same time to relieve\nthe people from some of the pressure of taxation.  Towards the end of\nthis year, 1790, the Assembly had decreed the discharge of the debts of\nthe State; and (whether or not they might prove able to execute what\nthey decreed) the people were highly delighted.  It was the custom to\nserenade the royal family on New Year's morning.  On this New Year's\nday, the band of the National Guard played under the king's windows an\nopera air which went to the words, \"But our creditors are paid, and we\nare consoled.\"  They would play nothing but this air; and finished it,\nstopped and resumed, over and over again.  They might have been very\nsure that the king knew what they meant by playing it at all.\n\nAnother New Year's day custom was to present gifts to the royal\nchildren.  On this day, some grenadiers of the Parisian guard came,\npreceded by military music, to offer a gift to the Dauphin.  This gift\nwas a set of dominoes made of the stone and marble of which parts of the\nBastille had been built.  On the lid of the box were engraved some\nverses, of which the sense was as follows:--\n\n\"These stones of the walls which enclosed so many innocent victims of\narbitrary power, have been made into a toy, to be offered to your\nHighness, as a token of the love of the people, and a lesson as to their\nstrength.\"\n\nThe queen would not allow her son to have this toy.  She took it from\nhim, and gave it into the hands of one of her ladies, desiring her to\npreserve it as a curious sign of the times.\n\nIf the royal family received insults from people who could not feel for\nthem, it was equally true that their adherents exasperated the feelings\nof persons who quite as little deserved insult.  Such was the effect of\nmutual prejudice.  General Lafayette, still in hopes of bringing the\nopposing parties to some understanding, frequently went to the palace of\nthe Tuileries, where now, during the winter, the royal family were once\nmore established.  As there was little use in conversing with the king\nabout affairs, these interviews were generally with the queen,--a fact\nwhich prevents our wondering much at the common accusation that the\nqueen meddled with the government, and did mischief by it.  One day when\nLafayette was with the queen, one of her majesty's ladies observed\n(intending to be heard by the General's officers) that it made her\nuneasy to think of her majesty's being shut up alone with a rebel and a\nrobber.  An older and more prudent lady, Madame Campan, seeing the folly\nof such a speech at a time when everything might depend on General\nLafayette's goodwill, reproved the person who had spoken; but it is\ncurious to see how much more she thought of the imprudence than of the\ninjustice of the speech.  She observed that General Lafayette was\ncertainly a rebel: but that an officer who commanded forty thousand men,\nthe capital, and a large extent of country, should be called a chieftain\nrather than a robber.  One would think this was little enough to say in\nfavour of such a man as Lafayette: yet the queen the next day asked\nMadame Campan, with a mournful gravity, what she could have meant by\ntaking Lafayette's part, and silencing the other ladies because they did\nnot like him.  When she heard how it was, the queen was satisfied: but\nwe, far from being satisfied, may learn from this how difficult it must\nhave been to help the royal family and court, while they thought and\nspoke of the best men in the nation in such a way as this.  In truth,\nthere were miserable prejudices and insults on both sides: and at this\ndistance of time, Lafayette, with his love of freedom, and his goodwill\ntowards all the sufferers of both parties, rises to our view from among\nthem all as a sunny hill-top above the fogs of an unwholesome marsh.\n\nThe next event in the royal family was the departure of the old\nprincesses.  They got away in February; and, though stopped in some\nplaces on their journey, crossed the frontiers in safety.  They might\nprobably have remained secure enough in Paris; and their departure was\nnot on their own account, so much as that of the king.  He could not\nhave attempted to fly while his aged aunts remained in the midst of the\ntroubles.  When they were disposed of, he felt himself more free to go\nor stay.  The old ladies earnestly entreated the sweet princess\nElizabeth to go with them, representing to her how happy she might be at\nRome in the exercise of the religion to which she was devoted.  But her\nreligion taught her that her duty lay, not where she could say her\nprayers with the most ease and security, but where she could give the\nmost help and consolation.  She refused ease and safety, and declared\nher intention of remaining with her brother's family to the end--\nwhatever that end might be.\n\nThe queen immediately (that is, in March) began her preparations for\ndeparture.  Remembering how easily they might have got away from Saint\nCloud, last summer, it was determined to start from Saint Cloud this\ntime.  On the 15th of April, notice was given to the Assembly that, the\nking having become subject to colds of late, the royal family would\nremove into the country in a few days.\n\nThe people of Paris discussed this plan very earnestly.  Lafayette\nwished that the king should live at any one of his palaces that he\npleased.  But so much had been said, all through the winter, about his\nmajesty's leaving Paris, that it had now become a very difficult thing\nto do.  The papers on the royal side had proudly threatened that the\nking would leave his people, if they were not more worthy of his\npresence.  The revolutionary papers had said that the king should not\ngo, to raise up armies of enemies at a distance.  All Paris had been\nkept awake by stories of saddled horses in the royal stables, of packed\ncarriages, and a host of armed nobles, always hovering about, ready to\nrescue him and murder the people.  It does indeed appear that latterly\nthere had been various mysterious meetings of gentlemen, who were\nsecretly armed: and report, which always exaggerates these things,\ndeclared that thirty thousand such armed gentlemen were hidden in the\nwoods, about Saint Cloud, and that they would overpower the people's\nguard, and carry off the family.\n\nSome may wonder why the nation, if sick of their king, did not let him\ngo, and rejoice to be rid of him.  The reason why they detained him so\ncarefully was this: they knew that his brother and friends were raising\nan army at a distance; and they saw that, if once the royal family\nescaped from their hands, they should have all Europe down upon them;\nwhereas, if they kept the family as hostages, their enemies would let\nthem alone, in the fear that the first march of a foreign army into\nFrance would be revenged upon the lives of the very persons whom it was\ndesired to save.\n\nConsidering all these things, the people resolved that the royal family\nshould not go to Saint Cloud.\n\nFirst, numbers of the servants were sent off, to get everything made\nready for the king, who was to follow on the 18th, to dinner.  The\nservants were allowed to go without opposition; so that on the 18th, the\napartments at Saint Cloud were ready, the dinner was cooking, and the\nattendants looking out along the road to Paris, wondering why the\ncarriages did not appear, and fearing the dinner would be spoiled.\nNobody came to eat it, however, unless it was given to the National\nGuard, a detachment of whom had gone forward, to be on duty about the\npalace.\n\nAt one o'clock, the great royal coach, drawn by its eight black horses,\ndrove up to the palace-gate in Paris; and immediately the alarm-bell\nfrom a neighbouring church-steeple began to sound.  The family were\nalmost ready; but multitudes of people, summoned by the bell, collected\npresently, and declared that the coach should not move.  Lafayette and\nhis officers came up, and did what they could in the way of persuasion:\nbut the crowd said, \"Hold your tongues.  The king shall not go.\"  They\nshouted, on seeing one of the royal family, \"We do not choose that the\nking should go.\"  The royal party, however, entered the carriage, and\nthe coachman cracked his whip; but some seized the reins and the horses'\nheads; others shut the gates: and a multitude so pressed round the heavy\ncoach that it rocked from side to side.  Such of the royal attendants as\nattempted to get near for orders were seized, their swords taken from\nthem, and their persons roughly handled.  The children must have been\ngrievously terrified; for even, their mother, so calm in danger,\npassionately entreated from the carriage-window that her servants might\nnot be hurt.  The National Guards did not know how to act.  Lafayette\nand his officers rode hither and thither, trying to open a way: the\ndriver whipped, the horses scrambled and reared; and the people pressed\ncloser and closer, so that the great coach rocked more and more;--all in\nvain, it did not get on one inch.\n\nAll this, amidst tremendous noise and confusion, went on for an hour and\nthree-quarters.  Then Lafayette rode up to say he would clear the way\nwith cannon, if the king would order it.  The king was not a person to\ngive any order at all; and least of all, such an order as that.  So the\nroyal family alighted, and returned into the palace, while the coach\nwent back to the coach-house, and the eight black horses to their\nstalls.\n\nThe king and queen were not sorry for what had happened.  This act of\nviolence must prove so plainly to all the world that they were\nprisoners, that all the world would now think them justified in getting\noff, in any way they could.  They might now devote themselves to the one\ngreat object of escape.\n\nPoor little Louis must have been very sorry.  He had seen the hay-making\nat Saint Cloud, last summer: and now he must have been pleased at the\nthought of the sweet fields and gardens of the country, and the woods\njust bursting into leaf.  There were many woods about Saint Cloud.  He\nknew nothing of armed nobles lurking there to save him and his family.\nWhat he thought of was the violets and daffodils, and fresh grass and\nsprouting shrubs,--the young lambs in the field, and the warbling larks\nin the air.  And now, when actually in the carriage to go (his garden\ntools probably gone before), he had to get out again, and stay in hot,\ndusty, glaring Paris; and, what was far worse, in danger of seeing every\nday the sneering, angry faces which had been crowded round the carriage\nfor nearly two hours; and of hearing, wherever he walked, the cruel\nlaugh or fierce abuse with which his parents were greeted when they\nattempted to do anything which the people did not like.  No doubt, the\nlittle boy's heart was heavy when he was lifted from the coach, and went\nback into the palace.\n\nHow much happier he might have been if he had been one of the children\nhe had seen hay-making at Saint Cloud, the year before!  Or even as the\nchild of a Paris tradesman he might have been happier than now, though\nthe children of the tradesmen of capital cities seldom have a run in the\nfields, or gather violets in the fresh woods of April.  But, as a\nshop-keeper's child, he might at least have seen his father cheerful in\nhis employment, and his mother bright and gay.  He might have passed his\ndays without hearing passionate voices, and seeing angry faces; without\ndreaming of being afraid.  It was now nothing to him that he was born a\nprince, and constantly told that he was to be a king.  He saw nothing in\nhis father's condition that made him think it a good thing to be a king;\nand he would have given all the grandeur in which he lived, all the\nladies and footmen that waited upon him, all his pretty clothes, all his\nmany playthings, all the luxuries of the palace, to be free from the\nterrors of the revolution, and to see his parents look as happy as other\nchildren see theirs every day.\n\nHe did not know it, but preparations were from this time going on\ndiligently for an escape,--for a real flight, by night.\n\nWe must not suppose that in this, any more than other affairs, the king\nshowed decision, or the queen knowledge and judgment.  They could not\nshow what they had not: and it was now too late for the king to become\nprompt and active, and for the queen to learn to view people and things\nas the rest of the world did, brought up, as she had been, in ignorance\nand self-will.  She often complained (and we cannot wonder) at having to\nlive and act among people who showed no presence of mind and good sense:\nbut, really, the king, and everybody concerned, might well have\ncomplained of the ruin which her folly and self-will brought upon the\npresent scheme,--the last chance they had for liberty.  Not that she\nonly was to blame.  There were mistakes,--there was mismanagement\nwithout end; showing how little those who are brought up in courts,\nhaving everything done for them exactly to their wish, are fit for\nbusiness, when brought to the proof.\n\nThe case was just this.  Here were the king and queen, with a sister and\ntwo children, wanting to get away from Paris.  They had plenty of money\nand jewels; plenty of horses and carriages; plenty of devoted servants\nand friends:--friends at hand, ready to help; friends at a distance,\nready to receive them; and every court in Europe inclined to welcome and\nfavour them.  The one thing to be done was to elude the people of Paris,\nand of the large towns through which they must pass.\n\nIn such a case as this, it seems clear that, in the first place,\neverything at home should go on as usual, up to the very last moment;\nthat there should be no sign of preparation whatever, to excite the\nsuspicion of any tradespeople or servants who were not in the secret.\n\nIn the next place, it is clear that the king should have separated from\nhis family on the road.  His best chance was to go with one other\ngentleman, and to travel as private gentlemen are in the habit of doing.\nWhile he went by one road to one country, the queen and princess should\nhave gone by another road, under the escort of one or two of the many\ngentlemen who were devotedly attached to their cause.  The children\nmight, with their governess, have gone, under the charge of another\ngentleman, to Brussels, to the arms of their aunt (their mother's\nsister), who held her court there.\n\nIn the third place, they should have taken the smallest quantity of\nluggage they could travel with without exciting suspicion, carrying on\ntheir persons money and jewels, with which to buy what they wanted when\nthey were safe.  They should have travelled in light carriages, and have\nmade sure, by employing drivers and couriers who knew the respective\nroads, of encountering no difficulty about meeting the relays of horses,\nand of exciting no particular observation at the post-houses.  These are\nthe arrangements which ordinary people, accustomed to business, would\nhave made.  We shall see how the queen chose that the affair should be\nmanaged.\n\nDuring the month of March (before the attempt to go to Saint Cloud), the\nqueen began her preparations for her escape to another kingdom.  Madame\nCampan (in whom she had perfect trust, and with good reason) was in\nattendance upon her during that month.  The queen employed her in buying\nand getting made an immense quantity of clothes.  Madame Campan\nremonstrated with her upon this, saying that the queen of France would\nalways be able to obtain linen and gowns wherever she went: but the\nqueen was obstinate.  Though it was necessary for Madame Campan to go\nout almost disguised to procure these things,--though she was obliged,\nfor the sake of avoiding suspicion, to order six petticoats at one shop,\nand six at another, and to buy one gown in one street, and two in\nanother,--and though this great load of things would be sure to attract\nnotice, however they might be sent off, nothing could satisfy the queen\nbut having with her a complete and splendid wardrobe for herself and the\nchildren; and this, after she and the king had a hundred times wondered\nhow it came to be told in the newspapers that so many horses were kept\nsaddled in their stables, and that such and such persons had paid them\nvisits by the back-door.  After having suffered for months from spies,\nthe queen would not agree to the simple plan of doing nothing which\nspies might not see, and tell all Paris, if they chose.  As it was, it\nwas well-known when Madame Campan went out, where she went, and what\nabout, from the very day her shopping began.\n\nMadame Campan endeavoured to use more disguise by getting her own little\nboy measured for the clothes which were intended for the Dauphin; and by\nasking her sister to have the Princess Royal's wardrobe made ready as if\nfor her daughter.  But these poor expedients were seen through, as might\nhave been expected.  How much easier and safer it would have been to\nhave no ordering and making at all.\n\nThese clothes were not all to go by the same coach which conveyed the\nfamily.  Most of them were sent in a trunk to one of the queen's women,\nwho was now at Arras, from whence she was to proceed to Brussels with\nthese clothes, to meet her mistress.  Of course, the sending off of this\ntrunk was observed.\n\nAll this was not so foolish as what followed.  The queen had a very\nlarge, expensive, and remarkable toilet-case, called a necessaire, which\ncontained everything wanted for the toilet, from her rarest essences and\nperfumes down to soap and combs.  It was of fine workmanship, and had\nmuch expensive material and ornament about it.  In short, it was fit for\na splendid royal palace, and no other place.  The queen consulted Madame\nCampan about how she should get this necessaire away.  Madame Campan\nentreated her not to think of taking it, saying that if it was moved\nfrom its place, on any pretence, it would be enough to excite the\nsuspicions of all the spies about the court.  The poor queen, however,\nseemed to think that she could no more do without her necessaire than go\nwithout shoes to her feet.  The necessaire, she declared, she must have;\nand she hit upon a device which she thought very clever for deceiving\nany spies, but which deceived nobody, though Madame Campan herself hoped\nit might afford a chance of doing so.  The queen agreed with the\nambassador from Vienna (who was in her confidence), that he should come\nto her, while her hair was dressing, and, in the presence of all her\nattendants, request her to order a necessaire precisely like her own,\nfor her sister at Brussels, who wished to have exactly such an one.  The\nambassador did as he was desired; and the queen turned to Madame Campan,\nand requested her to have a necessaire made by the pattern of the one\nbefore her.  If the plan had succeeded, here was an expense of 500\npounds incurred, at the time when money was most particularly wanted,\nand great hazard run; and all because the queen could not be satisfied\nwith such a dressing-case as other ladies use.  Any of her friends could\nhave supplied her with such an one as she was setting off.\n\nThe necessaire was ordered in the middle of April.  A month after, the\nqueen inquired whether it would soon be done.  The cabinet-maker said it\ncould not be finished in less than six weeks more.  The queen declared\nto Madame Campan that she could not wait for it; and that, as the order\nhad been given in the presence of all her attendants, nobody would\nsuspect anything if her own necessaire was emptied and cleaned, and sent\noff to Brussels; and she gave positive orders that this should be done.\nMadame Campan ordered the wardrobe-woman, whose proper business it was,\nto have this order executed, as the archduchess could not wait so long\nas it would take to finish the new necessaire; and she particularly\ndesired that no perfume should be left hanging about any of the drawers\nwhich might be disagreeable to the archduchess.\n\nOne evening in May, the queen called Madame Campan to help her to wrap\nup in cotton, and pack, her jewels, which she sent, by the hands of a\nperson she could trust, to Brussels.  They sat in a little room by\nthemselves, with the door locked, till seven o'clock, when the queen had\nto go to cards.  She told Madame Campan that there was no occasion to\nput by the diamonds; they would be quite safe, as there was a sentinel\nunder the window, and she herself should keep the key in her pocket.\nShe appointed Madame Campan to be there early the next morning, to\nfinish the packing; till which time the jewels lay on the sofa, some in\ncotton, and some without.\n\nThe same wardrobe-woman, Madame R---, who was ordered to empty the\nnecessaire, was clever about her business, and had been engaged in it\nfor many years, and all the year round; so that the queen, without\nhaving much to do with her, had become accustomed to see her, liked her\nway of discharging her business, and did not dream of distrusting her.\nMadame Campan did, however.  She knew that this lady, having grown rich\nin her office, gave parties, consisting chiefly of persons of politics\nopposed to the court,--several members of the Assembly of those politics\nbeing often there,--and one of Lafayette's staff, Monsieur Gouvion,\nbeing a lover of Madame R---'s.  This lady was indeed not to be trusted.\nOn the 21st of this month of May, she went and made a declaration\nbefore the mayor, that she had no doubt the royal family were planning\nan escape.  She told the whole story of the necessaire, saying that\neverybody knew the queen was too fond of her own necessaire to think of\nparting with it, when another might be had for a little waiting; and\nthat the queen had often been heard to say how useful this article would\nbe to her in travelling.  Madame R---went on to declare that the queen\nhad been engaged in packing her diamonds in the evening of such a day,--\nthose diamonds having been seen by her lying about, half wrapped in\ncotton, on the sofa of such a room; and that Madame Campan had helped\nthe queen, and, of course, knew all about it.  It was plain that this\nwoman had a key of the little room, and that she must have been in it,\neither in the evening while the queen was at cards, or very early the\nnext morning.\n\nThe queen confided to Madame Campan a letter-case full of very valuable\npapers, which was immediately put into the hands of some faithful\npersons in the city.  This proceeding also did not escape the quick eyes\nof Madame R---.  She declared before the mayor that she saw a\nletter-case upon a chair, which had never been seen there before: that\nshe observed the queen say something about it in a low voice to Madame\nCampan, after which it disappeared.  The mayor took these depositions,\nas in duty bound: but he let them lie, not wishing to injure the royal\nfamily.  So the queen went on, more hopeful every day, and not in the\nleast suspecting that her scheme was seen through from beginning to end.\n\nThe other persons who were taking part in the plan were, a brave officer\nof the name of Bouille, and a Swedish Count Fersen, helped by the Duke\nde Choiseul, who was a colonel in the French army.\n\nBouille was near the frontier, collecting together such French soldiers\nas were loyal, and several Germans, under pretence of watching the\nAustrians.  It was secretly settled for him to meet the royal family\nnear the frontiers, and escort them beyond the reach of their enemies.\nThey really had not to go very far.  Montmedy, where Bouille was making\na fortified camp, was less than two hundred miles from Paris; and he\nmeant to meet the royal family, with a guard of hussars, at some\ndistance nearer Paris.\n\nWe have seen how the queen neglected the first precautions, and how much\nrisk she ran about clothes and luggage.  So it was with the other\nprecautions we mentioned.  She did, at one time, intend to send the\nchildren to Brussels, under the care of a gentleman who might be\ntrusted; but she changed her mind, and resolved that the whole family,\nwith attendants, should go together.\n\nAgain, instead of travelling in light carriages, and in the most\nordinary style, so as to excite as little observation as possible, they\nmust all go in the same carriage,--that is, the king, the queen, and two\nchildren, the Princess Elizabeth, and Madame de Tourzel,--six in one\ncarriage, while the other attendant ladies were to follow in another.\nThese were great difficulties; and it was over these difficulties that\nCount Fersen did all he could to help them.  He declared, openly, that a\nRussian lady, a friend of his, the Baroness de Korff, was about to\ntravel homewards, with her valet, waiting-woman, and two children, and\nthat she wanted a carriage for that purpose.  The Count pretended to be\nvery particular about this carriage,--a large coach, called a berlin.\nHe had a model made first; and employed the first coach-makers in\nFrance.  When it was done, he and the Duke de Choiseul made trial of it\nin a drive through the streets of Paris.  They then sent it to a certain\nMadame Sullivan's, near the northern outskirts of the city.  Count\nFersen also bought several horses and a chaise, to convey, as he said,\ntwo waiting-women; and exerted himself much about getting the necessary\npassport for the Baroness de Korff and her party.  It appeared that\nCount Fersen was uncommonly polite, or very much devoted to this\nBaroness de Korff.\n\nIn order to put Paris off its guard, the king and queen promised to be\npresent at a great Catholic festival, in the church of the Assumption in\nParis, on the 21st of June; meaning, however, to be off on the 20th.\n\nLittle Louis knew nothing of all that was going on, nor guessed, when he\nwent to bed on the 20th of June, that he should have to get up again\npresently.  As soon as it was dark, his governess took him up, and\ndressed him, and put a sort of hood over his head, which prevented his\nface being seen.  He was probably as sleepy as a little boy of six, just\nwaked up before eleven o'clock at night, was likely to be; and knew and\ncared little about what Madame de Tourzel was doing with him.  His\nsister was dressed, and had a hood over her head too; and so had Madame\nde Tourzel.  They were very quiet; for everybody in the palace but those\nwho were in the secret believed that the king was now gone to bed.\nSomebody opened the doors for them, and showed them the way.  They\npassed some sentinels who knew better than to ask them who they were;\nthen went out through a back-door where there was no sentinel, along a\ncourt and a square, and into a street.  A glass-coach was stationed\nbefore the door of Ronsin, the saddler, as if waiting for some visitors\nof Ronsin's.  The coachman, standing beside his horses, opened the door\nwithout any question, and let Madame de Tourzel and the children into\nthe coach.  This was no real coachman, however, but Count Fersen.\n\nIn a little while came another lady, attended by a servant, as it\nseemed.  She said \"Good night\" cheerfully to him, and stepped into the\ncoach.  It was the Princess Elizabeth.  If anybody in the street\nwondered to see ladies coming the same way, one after another, the\nanswer was easy; they had, no doubt, been at the palace.\n\nPresently, the coachman's hand was again upon the door; and a gentleman,\nstout, in a round hat, was seen coming, leaning upon the arm of a\nservant.  As he passed a sentinel, one of his shoe buckles gave way.  He\nstooped down and clasped it.  Glad were the party in the coach when the\nking stepped in.  They were all there now but the queen; and it was\nrather odd that she should be the last.\n\nOne looked from the window, and then another watched; and still she did\nnot come.  It must have been a terrible worry,--waiting and waiting\nthere,--the Count afraid of what everybody in the street might think of\na coach standing so long before one door;--the party within afraid of\nsomething having happened to the queen.  Minute after minute passed\nslowly away, and then,--\"what is this?  Here is some great man's\ncarriage, with lights all about it, dashing up the street!\"  It was\nLafayette's carriage, evidently in a prodigious hurry: and it went under\nthe arch; it was certainly going to the palace.\n\nIt _was_ going to the palace.  Madame R---'s eyes were as quick as ever.\nShe had told her lover perpetually that she was sure the royal family\nwere going off; and Gouvion had kept constantly on the watch, but could\ndiscover nothing.  This evening she had told him that she was sure they\nmeant to go in the night.  Gouvion sent an express for Lafayette, who\ncame directly.  He thought he met no one in the courts,--saw nothing\nsuspicious.  The sentinels were all at their posts, and the royal family\n(as all the palace believed) quietly in their chambers.  So Lafayette\nwent away again, telling his officer that he must have been deceived,\nand bidding him beware of treachery.\n\nLafayette was mistaken if he thought he had met no one within the\nprecincts of the palace.  Under the arch he had whirled past two\npeople,--a lady in white, with something in her hand, leaning on a man's\narm.  The lady had even touched the spoke of one of his carriage-wheels\nwith that which she had in her hand,--a sort of switch, which it was\nthen the fashion for ladies to carry.  This lady was the queen, and she\nwas conducted by a faithful body-guard.  However faithful this man might\nbe, he did not know the way; and the queen's guard on such an occasion\nshould also have been a well-qualified guide.  The queen was flurried\nwith meeting the enemy's carriage rumbling under the archway, with its\nflaring lights; and, on entering the square, she took the turn to the\nright hand instead of the left.  She and her guard wandered far away,\nover the bridge, and they knew not where.  The queen of France wandering\nthrough the streets of Paris, losing her way on foot at midnight!  What\ncould she have thought of a situation so new?  How must her guard have\nfelt, with such a charge upon his arm!  And the Count, standing beside\nthe hackney-coach-door; and the party within!  We may hope that Louis\nwas fast asleep upon Madame de Tourzel's lap, forgetting all about where\nhe was.\n\nA hackney-coachman came up, and began to talk.  The Swedish count talked\nas like a hackney-coachman as he could.  They took a pinch of snuff\ntogether, would rather not drink together, and the real hackney-coachman\nbade good-night, and went off without making any discovery.  The clocks\nhad struck midnight by this time; but soon after the queen appeared.\nShe had had to inquire her way, which was dangerous.  Her companion and\nthe king's were to go with them; so they jumped up, the Count was on the\nbox in a moment; and off they drove,--six inside and three out.\n\nIn a little while there was another panic.  The king was sure they were\ngoing the wrong way.  They ought to leave Paris by the north-eastern\nroad; but they were now going straight north.  The king might have been\nsure that the Count knew which way to drive, after managing so well all\nelse that he had to do.  He was only going to Madame Sullivan's, to make\nsure that the new berlin was gone to the place where they were to meet\nit.  All was right.  Count Fersen's servant had called for the Baroness\nde Korff's coach, an hour and a half before.  So on they went, through\nthe north entrance, turning immediately eastwards; and when fairly free\nof Paris, they came in sight of the great coach, waiting by the\nroadside, with its six horses, and the Count's coachman on the box.\n\nThe party made haste to settle themselves in the berlin; for too much\ntime had been lost already.  Count Fersen was again the driver.  His\ncoachman went off in another direction, to have his master's chariot\nready for him, at some distance on the north road.  Who then was there\nto drive home the glass-coach?  Nobody.  So they turned the horses'\nheads towards the city, and set them off by themselves; and the coach\nwas found next day in a ditch.  Still there was another meeting to take\nplace.  At the hamlet of Bondy they were to meet the two waiting-women,\nwith their luggage in the new chaise, and postilions with fresh horses.\nThere they were at Bondy, while every one else was asleep.  They had\nbeen waiting some time.  Here Count Fersen took his leave.  How must the\nparty have felt towards him!  How must they have longed to say what they\nmust not say before the postilions, in whose eyes Count Fersen must be a\ndriver, and nothing more!  He met his coachman and chariot on the north\nroad, and got safely away.  It must have given him satisfaction all the\nrest of his life to look back on this adventure, in which his part was\nso admirably performed.  Perhaps, if he had been of the party for\nanother day or two, things might have gone better with the fugitives\nthan they did.\n\nNow they had to take care of their behaviour, lest, by any\nforgetfulness, they should cause suspicion as to who they were.  Madame\nde Tourzel had to act the Baroness de Korff, and call the princess and\nthe dauphin her children.  The king, who wore a wig, was her valet, and\nthe queen her waiting-maid.  The Princess Elizabeth was her travelling\ncompanion.  We know nothing of how they supported these characters at\nthe places where they stopped.  One may imagine the queen putting some\nspirit into her part; but one can never fancy the king doing anything in\nthe service of Madame de Tourzel.  They stopped as little as they could,\nhowever; and yet they did not get on fast.  How should a heavy coach,\nwith nine people in and on it, get on fast?  How much wiser would it\nhave been to have travelled separately, and like other people!  The\nking's brother and his lady did so; going in common carriages towards\nFlanders, by different roads, and finding no difficulty.  At one point\ntheir roads crossed, and they happened to meet while changing horses.\nThey had the presence of mind to take no notice, and drove off their\nseparate ways without a look or sign.  The Princess de Lamballe\ntravelled in the same way towards England, without impediment.  It was\nlamentable folly in the king and queen to choose a way of journeying\nwhich must attract all eyes.\n\nThis sort of notice began almost before it was light.  About sunrise\nthey passed, in the wood of Bondy, a poor herb-man, with his ass and\npanniers of greens.  When the hue and cry began, this herb-man told of\nthe fine new berlin he had seen in the wood of Bondy; and thus set\npursuers upon their track.  Besides the eight horses wanted for the two\ncarriages, there were more for the three body-guards, mounted and\ndressed as couriers, but knowing nothing about courier's business, as\nthe people along the road must have found out, while watching the\nchanging of eleven horses at the different stages.  Then the berlin\nwanted some repairs, and this detained them at Etoges: and the king\nwould get out, and walk up the hills, and they had to wait for him: so\nthat though they gave double money to the drivers to get on fast, they\nhad gone only sixty-nine miles by ten at night.  This slowness ruined\neverything.\n\nThe Duke de Choiseul, Count Fersen's friend, had left Paris ten hours\nbefore the royal family, and was waiting, with a party of hussars, at a\nvillage, some way beyond Chalons.  If the party had kept their time,\nthey would have met their guard, and, finding more and more soldiers all\nalong the road, would have been safe.  There would have been no time for\nthe attention of the country people to be fixed on the gathering of\nmilitary in the neighbourhood.  The Duke de Choiseul's pretence for his\nparty was that they were to guard a treasure that was expected.  The\n\"treasure\" did not arrive; the soldiers lounged about; and it was all\ntheir officers could do to keep them out of public-houses, where they\nwould be questioned and made suspicious;--for, of course, they knew\nnothing of the meaning of their errand.  It was a great misfortune, too,\nthat the queen had changed her mind about the day, when it was too late\nto warn some of the officers; and they, supposing the party to have set\noff on the 19th, were now in great dismay; and their soldiers were\nlounging about twenty-four hours sooner than they should have been.  The\nvillage politicians did not like what they saw.  They began to say to\none another that no treasure ought to be leaving the kingdom.  Any\ntreasure which had to be guarded by soldiers must be public treasure,\nbelonging to the people, which no one had any right to carry away.  Some\nof these rang the alarm-bell of their parish church; and from several\nplaces, parties of the national soldiery went out to explore the roads,\nand met parties of the national soldiery from other places.  They agreed\nthat there must be something wrong.  At Saint Menehould, the National\nVolunteers demanded three hundred muskets from the town-hall, and stood\narmed: the same Saint Menehould where the former arrival of the queen as\ndauphiness had been awaited in a far different temper.  In short, the\nhussars had to ride away, and leave the \"treasure\" to take its chance.\nThus all was confusion, expectation, and alarm along the road, for hours\nbefore the berlin appeared: the very road by which the queen had entered\nFrance, amidst cheers of welcome, in her bridal days!\n\nIt appeared afterwards that it was the king's wish to have these\nsoldiers in waiting along the road, while his advisers thought it would\nbe better to keep up the story of the Baroness de Korff till the party\nactually drew near Montmedy.  As it turned out, the king not only lost\nhis desired security, but, by his and the queen's management together,\nthe whole region beyond Chalons was in an uproar before they entered it.\nMeantime, the party had travelled only sixty-nine of their two hundred\nmiles in twenty-two hours; and little Louis must have been sadly tired\nbefore they had gone nearly half-way.\n\nOn and on they went, however, through the night and all the next day,\nlittle knowing how fast messengers from Paris were racing all over the\nkingdom, to give the news of their flight.  Lafayette had been roused,\nat six in the morning of the 21st, by a note from a gentleman who had\nbeen informed that the king's rooms at the Tuileries were empty.  The\nwhole city was in consternation, and Lafayette's life in great danger.\nTranquillity was preserved, however.  Messengers galloped off in every\ndirection; and one of these it was who, going north-east, spread the\nalarm which made the herb-man go and tell what he had seen in the wood\nof Bondy.  Little did the travelling party think how much faster the\nmounted messengers were going than they: and on they lumbered, the\neleven horses whisking their tails, and the king taking his time in\nwalking up the hills, while the alarm was flying abroad.\n\nIt was near sunset on the second evening, when they had gone about one\nhundred and seventy miles, that one of the body-guards, mounted and\ndressed in yellow as a courier, came prancing into the village of Saint\nMenehould.  His dress attracted all eyes; and so did his proceedings.\nThe gazers saw that this odd courier did not know the post-house; for he\nspurred past it, and had to inquire for it.  The master of the post,\nDrouet, of revolutionary politics, was in a very bad humour, and had\nbeen so all day, having been angry about the mysterious hussars in the\nmorning, and no less angry at seeing the village now full of dragoons,\nfrom another quarter, whose business here he could not understand.\nThese dragoons, strolling through the streets, touched their helmets to\nthe party in the carriage, which the waiting-maid of the baroness\nacknowledged with remarkable grace.  The dragoon officer, Dandoins, at\nfirst delighted to see the party arrive, presently did not like what he\nsaw, and was pretty sure the village had taken the alarm.  He looked\nfull at the pretended courier, from the side pavement, as much as to\nsay, \"Be quick!  Make haste to change horses, and be off.\"  The dull\nfellow, not understanding what he meant, came up to him, to know whether\nhe had anything to say.  All which was observed by a hundred eyes.\nDrouet's eyes were the quickest.  He thought that the waiting-maid's\nface was like somebody he had seen somewhere in Paris; and the valet,\nhow very like the king!  He called to a friend to bring him, quick, a\nnew assignat.  [Note: A promissory note which passed as money, like a\nbank-note.  It bore an engraving of the king's head.] The king's head\nthere, and the valet's head in the carriage, were exactly alike.  Now\nDrouet understood the meaning of his village being filled with hussars\nin the morning, and dragoons in the afternoon.\n\nThe great coach was just driving off; and he dared not stop it, while\nthe armed dragoons were standing about, even if he had been absolutely\ncertain that he had seen the king and queen; which he could not be.  So\nhe let them drive off; and then told the friend that had brought him the\nassignat, desiring him to saddle two of the fleetest horses in the\npost-house, while he stepped over to the town-hall, to give the alarm.\nWhile they rode off, the report got abroad through the whole village.\nDandoins wanted his dragoons to mount and ride; but they were hungry,\nand would have some bread and cheese first.  While they were eating, the\nNational Volunteers drew up, with their bayonets fixed, to prevent their\nleaving the village.  The dragoons were willing to stay, and side with\nthe people: and stay they did; only the quarter-master cutting his way\nthrough, and riding off with a pocket-book, containing secret\ndespatches, which Dandoins had managed to slip into his hand.\n\nThe berlin went on faster now; but not so fast as Drouet and his\ncompanion were following; while the quarter-master was spurring on to\novertake _them_, if possible.  What a race!--the fate of France probably\ndepending upon it!\n\nAbout six miles before coming to Varennes, the party observed a horseman\npassing, at a gallop, from behind, close by the coach-window.  In\npassing, he shouted something which the noise of their carriage-wheels\nprevented their hearing exactly.  They caught the sound, however; and\nwhen all was over, agreed that he must have said, \"You are discovered!\"\nThey did not know whether to take this man for a friend or an enemy.\nThey received another warning from one who was no enemy.  A beggar, who\nasked alms of the king at a place where the coach stopped, said, with\nmuch feeling, \"Your Majesty is known.  May God take care of you!  May\nProvidence watch over you!\"\n\nThe quarter-master, on reaching Clermont after them, called up the\ndragoons who were gone to bed; and a _few_ of them followed the royal\ncarriage, under the command of a Cornet Remy.  But they lost their way\nin the dark, and floundered about in fields and lanes, stumbling over\nfences, before they found the direction in which they should go to\nVarennes.  The rest of the dragoons at Clermont,--all but two,--struck\ntheir swords into the scabbard when ordered to draw, and declared for\nthe people, instead of the king.\n\nThe Duke de Choiseul, with his hussars, was all the while stumbling\nabout in the cross country, finding it difficult enough to get to\nVarennes, as he must avoid the high roads.  Some of his troop fell and\nwere hurt; and their comrades refused to go on without them.  Towards\nmidnight, the alarm-bell of Varennes was heard through the darkness.\nThe duke said it was no doubt some fire: but in his heart he had strong\nfears of the truth.\n\nBouille, junior, sent by his father, had been waiting with his troop six\nhours at Varennes: and he, supposing that the party would not arrive\nthis day, was in bed and asleep when the berlin reached the village, at\neleven o'clock.  His troop were, some of them, drinking in the\npublic-houses.  None of them were ready; and the royal party tried in\nvain to discover through the thick darkness any sign of a friendly\nguard, where they had made sure of meeting one.  If they could but find\nthese hussars, they believed they should be safe; for they had now no\nmore towns to pass through, and no great way to go.\n\nThe berlin stood on the top of the hill, at the entrance of Varennes,\nwhile their pretended couriers were riding about, rousing the sleeping\nvillage, in search of horses to go on with.  The horses were standing,\nthe whole time, all ready, by the orders of the Duke de Choiseul, in the\nupper village, over the bridge; and the men never found this out.  They\nmight have changed horses in five minutes, and proceeded, without having\nwakened a single person in the place; instead of which, the carriages\nactually stood five-and-thirty minutes on the top of the hill, while\nthis blundering was going on.  The king argued with the postilions about\nproceeding another stage: but their horses were so tired, they would not\nhear of it.\n\nIn the midst of this argument, two riders came up from behind, checked\ntheir horses for a moment on recognising the berlin, which they could\njust make out in the dark; and then pushed on quickly into the village.\nIt was Drouet and his companion.\n\nThey rode to the Golden Arms tavern, told the landlord what they came\nfor, and proceeded to block up the bridge with waggons, and whatever\nelse they could find.  And the fugitives might have passed that bridge\nabove half an hour before, and be now speeding on with the fresh horses\nthat were standing ready,--if only young Bouille had not gone to bed; or\neven if, instead of one of their useless servants, they had had a\ncourier who knew the road, and could have told them of the upper\nvillage!  Was ever an expedition so mismanaged?\n\nBefore the berlin came up (the horses somewhat refreshed with meal and\nwater), the bridge was well barricaded; and (the landlord having roused\nthree or four companions) about half-a-dozen men, with muskets and\nlanterns hidden under their coats, were standing under an archway,\nawaiting the party.  Suddenly the lanterns shone out, the horses'\nbridles were seized, and a man thrust the barrel of a musket in at each\nwindow, exclaiming, \"Ladies, your passports!\"\n\nThis was one of the moments which occur now and then in the course of\nmen's lives, as if to show what they are made of.  This was the\noccasion, if the king had been a man of spirit, to forget that he had\nblood to spill,--to assert his rights as a ruler and as an innocent\nman,--to daunt his enemies, and rouse his friends,--to carry off his\nfamily in triumph,--to save his crown and kingdom, his life and\nreputation.  Things much more difficult have been done.  His enemies\nwere but six; and he and his body-guards might have resisted them till\nBouille was roused by the noise, to come up with his hussars, to help\nand save.  It is true, the king did not know that his enemies were but\nsix: but a man of spirit would have seen how many they were before he\nyielded.  It is true he did not know that Bouille was in bed, and his\nhussars drinking in the village: but a man of spirit would have trusted\nthat help would rise up, or have done without it in such an extremity,\nrather than yield.  Instead of this, what did the king do?  He heard\nwhat his enemies had to say.\n\nOne of the six was Monsieur Sauce, a grocer who lived in the\nmarket-place, and a magistrate.  He said, in the name of his party,\nthat, whether the travellers were the Baroness de Korff and suite, or of\na higher rank still, it would be better that they should alight, and\nremain at his house till morning.\n\nWith what a bursting heart must the queen have seen the king quietly\ndoing as he was bid!  For twenty-one years she had suffered what a high\nspirit must suffer in being closely united with a companion who has\nnone; but the agony of this moment must have exceeded all former trials\nof the kind.  She, the woman and the wife, must obey, to her own\ndestruction, and that of all who belonged to her.  She said little; but\nthere was afterwards a visible sign of what she must have endured.  In\nthis one night, her beautiful hair turned white, as if forty years had\nat once fallen upon her head.\n\nThe king stepped out of the coach, and the ladies followed him.  They\ntook each an arm of Monsieur Sauce, and walked across the market-place\nto his shop, the king following, with a child holding either hand.  It\nwas strange confusion for little Louis.  This was the third night that\nhe had spent out of his bed.  He had been asleep,--the whole party had\nbeen asleep in the coach; and now this disputing, and the flare of the\nlanterns, and the presenting the muskets, and the having to get out and\nwalk, must have been perplexing and terrifying to the poor little\nfellow.  There was much noise round about.  The alarm-bell was clanging;\nthere were lights in all the windows: men poured out of the houses,\nhalf-dressed, and rolled barrels, and laid felled trees across the road,\nthat no help might arrive on the king's behalf.\n\nAnd what did the king do next?  He asked for something to eat!\n\"Something to eat\" was always a great object with him; and he seemed to\nfind comfort under all trials in his good appetite.  He sat now in an\nupper story of Monsieur Sauce's house, eating bread and cheese and\ndrinking Burgundy,--declaring that this bottle of Burgundy was the best\nhe ever tasted.  One wonders that the queen's heart was not quite\nbroken.  She believed that there was yet a chance.  She saw Monsieur\nSauce's old mother kneeling, and praying for her king and queen, while\nthe tears ran down her cheeks.  The queen saw that Monsieur Sauce looked\nfrequently towards his wife, while the king talked with him, explaining\nthat he meant no harm to the nation, but good, since he could come to a\nbetter understanding with his people when at a distance and in freedom.\nMonsieur Sauce, the queen saw, looked so frequently towards his wife,\nthat it was plain that he would act according to her judgment.  The\nqueen of France therefore kneeled to the grocer's wife to implore mercy\nand aid.  Fain would the grocer's wife have aided her sovereign, if she\ndared: but she dared not.  Again and again she said, \"Think what it is\nyou ask, madame.  Your situation is very grievous; but you see what we\nshould be exposed to.  They would cut off my husband's head.  A wife\nmust consider her husband first.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied the queen.  \"My husband is your king.  He has made\nyou all happy for many years; and wishes to do so still.\"  Whatever\nMadame Sauce might think of the poor queen's belief that her husband had\nmade his people happy, she replied only, as before, that she could not\ninduce Monsieur Sauce to put his life in danger.\n\nThe leaders of the different military parties, hearing one alarm-bell\nafter another beginning to toll through the whole region, made\nprodigious exertions to reach Varennes, and did so.  The Duke de\nChoiseul and his troop surmounted the barricade, and got in; and the\nhussars promised fidelity to \"the king--the king!  And the queen!\" as\nthey kept exclaiming.  They were led forward to beset Monsieur Sauce's\nhouse: but Drouet shouted to his national soldiery to stand to their\ncannon.  On hearing of cannon, the hussars drew back: though Drouet's\ncannon were only two empty, worn-out, useless field-pieces, which seemed\nfit only to make a clatter on the pavement.\n\nCount Damas had also arrived; and the king sat consulting with these\nofficers and the magistrates of Varennes,--consulting, when he, with the\naid which had arrived, should have been forcing his way out towards the\nfrontier.  There he sat, as usual, unable to decide upon anything; and\nwhile he sat doubting, the national soldiery poured in to the number of\nthree thousand, and would presently amount to ten thousand.  While he\nthus sat doubting, the people were handing jugs of wine about among the\nhussars; and when their commander came out from Monsieur Sauce's, at the\nend of an hour, he found them tipsy, and declaring for the nation\nagainst the king.\n\nThere was still one other chance--one more opportunity of choice for him\nwhose misfortune was that he never could make a choice.  Another loyal\nofficer, Deslons, arrived, with a hundred horse-soldiers.  He left his\nhundred horse outside the barricade, entered himself, and offered to cut\nout the royal party,--to rescue them by the sword, if the king would\norder him to do so.  \"Will it be hot work?\" asked the king.  \"Very hot,\"\nwas the answer; and the king would give no orders.--In the bitterness of\nher regrets, the queen said afterwards, at Paris, that no one who knew\nwhat had been the king's answer to Count d'Inisdal about being carried\noff, should have asked him for orders;--that the officers should have\nacted without saying a word to him.\n\nThe children were asleep on a bed up-stairs, and the ladies\nremonstrating with Madame Sauce, from hour to hour of this dreadful\nnight: and the end of it all was that it was decided by somebody that\nthe party were to go back to Paris, as the people in the market-place\nwere loudly demanding.  The poor queen's doubts and fears thus ended in\ndespair.  Weary as they all were,--after having travelled so far, and\nescaped so many dangers,--and now so near the frontier, so near\nBouille's camp, so close upon the queen's own country,--they were to\npursue their weary way back to Paris,--journeying in disgrace, prisoners\nin the eyes of all the people, to be plunged again into the midst of\ntheir enemies, now enraged by their flight.  It would have been easier\nto a spirit like the queen's to have died, with those who belonged to\nher, in one more struggle,--in one rush to the camp, than to undergo the\nslow despair of a return among their enemies.\n\nHer feelings were understood,--the case was understood,--by one of the\nattendants who had travelled in the chaise,--the Dauphin's head\nwaiting-woman.  Hoping that gaining time might afford a chance, she\nthrew herself on a bed, and pretended to be taken suddenly ill, and in\nan agony of pain.  The queen went to the bedside, and the woman squeezed\nher hand, to make her understand the pretence.  The queen declared that\nshe could not think of leaving in this state a faithful servant who had\nencountered many dangers and fatigues for the sake of the family; but a\ndevice so obvious was seen through at once, and no indulgence was\nallowed.  The woman had to get off the bed and enter the chaise again.\n\nThe great berlin travelled back more slowly than it came, being\nsurrounded by sixty thousand National Guards, besides the crowds of\nother people who drew near to see the captive royal family.  There was\nso much indecent joy, so much insult shown by the ignorant and fierce\namong the crowd, that civility which would have been thought nothing of\nat another time touched the feelings of the unhappy ladies.  The queen\nwas delighted with the manners of a lady at whose house they rested,--\nthe wife of Monsieur Renard, the mayor of Ferte-sous-Jouarre.  The mayor\nwaited upon the king at table; and Madame Renard did all she could to\nmake the ladies comfortable.  Everything was done so quietly that the\nqueen did not discover, for a long time, who she was.  When, at length,\nthe queen inquired whether she was not the mistress of the house, Madame\nRenard replied, \"I was so, Madame, before your Majesty honoured this\nabode with your presence.\"  To us there appears some affectation in this\nspeech; but the queen was now so unused to homage from strangers that\nshe shed tears at the words.\n\nThe Dauphin did not travel back, as he came, on the lap of Madame de\nTourzel.  The National Assembly sent three of its members from Paris to\nmeet and travel with the royal family.  Two of these members were to be\nin the carriage with the king; so that Madame de Tourzel had to turn\nout.  The other member and she joined the two waiting-maids in the\ncarriage behind.  The pretended couriers were bound with cords, and rode\nconspicuous to all eyes on the top of the berlin.\n\nMonsieur Barnave, one of the king's new travelling companions, was so\nconsiderate, polite, and gentlemanly, that the royal party decided and\ndeclared that, if ever they regained their power, Monsieur Barnave\nshould be pardoned the part he had taken in the Revolution.  It does not\nseem to have occurred to them that they might have been prejudiced\nagainst him and others,--that the revolutionary leaders might not have\nbeen altogether so wicked and detestable as the Court had been\naccustomed to call them.  Barnave, on his part, seems to have been\ntouched by the sorrows of the queen; and it is probable that he\ndiscovered now that he had been prejudiced--too strongly wrought upon by\nthe queen's enemies.\n\nA poor clergyman, endeavouring to reach the carriages to offer his loyal\ngreeting, was seized, and roughly handled by the furious mob.  Barnave\nfeared they would kill him, as they had already killed one person under\nsimilar circumstances.  He threw himself almost out of the coach-door as\nhe cried, \"Tigers, have you ceased to be Frenchmen?  From being brave\nfellows have you turned assassins?\"  The Princess Elizabeth, fearing\nlest he should fall out of the carriage, grasped the skirt of his coat;\nand the queen told Madame Campan afterwards that she could not but be\nstruck with the oddity of seeing the Princess Elizabeth taking care of\nthe safety of a man whom they had all abhorred as a rebel and a traitor.\nSo vehemently had the whole Court thus detested him, that Madame Campan\ncould scarcely believe her senses when she heard the queen speak with\nearnest regard of the revolutionary Barnave.  This is another\ncircumstance which indicates how much guilt and misery might have been\nsaved if the adverse parties could early have come to an understanding\nand made their mutual complaints face to face.\n\nBarnave's companion, Petion, disgusted them all; including Barnave.  He\nbehaved with ostentatious rudeness and brutality.  The king began to\nconverse with him upon the condition of the nation, and to explain the\nreasons of his own conduct, saying that he wished to strengthen the\ngovernment so far as to enable it to _be_ a government, since France\ncould not be a republic...  \"Not yet, indeed,\" interrupted Petion; \"for\nthe French are not ripe for a republic yet.\"  This brutal reply silenced\nthe king, who spoke no more till he entered Paris.\n\nThe ladies offered refreshments to their new companions.  Barnave said\nhe had to occupy their Majesties with the serious business on which he\nwas sent, but would not trouble them with his personal wants.\n\nPetion ate and drank greedily.  He threw chicken-bones out of the\nwindow, past the king's face; and when the Princess Elizabeth poured out\nwine for him, he jerked his glass, instead of speaking, to show that\nthere was enough.  He took Louis on his knees, and twisted his fingers\nin the child's curly hair.  When eager in conversation, he twitched the\nboy's hair so as to make him call out.  The queen held out her arms,\nsaying, \"Give me my son.  He is accustomed to tender care, and to\ntreatment very unlike this familiarity.\"\n\nThe great coach entered Paris on the Saturday evening, slowly rolling on\nthrough hundreds of thousands of gazers.  A placard had been stuck up\nthrough one region of the city, in the morning, declaring that whoever\ninsulted the king should be caned: whoever applauded him should be\nhanged.  The people were quiet, gaped and stared, and seemed neither\nvery much pleased nor very angry.  The king now began to speak once\nmore.  As one body of official personages after another met him, he\nsaid, over and over again, with an embarrassed sort of smile, \"Well,\nhere I am!\"  Again we cannot help thinking what a pity it was that he\nwas not a locksmith, happy in his workshop in one of the meaner streets\nof Paris.  As for his little son, how happy would Louis now have been to\nbe the son of the poor herb-man in the wood of Bondy, gathering his dewy\nherbs in the fresh, free morning air and sunshine, and going to sleep at\nsundown, far from crowds and quarrels and fears!  Never more was this\nunfortunate child in the open country.  He had this day seen the last of\ngreen fields, breezy hills, and waving woods.\n\nThe couriers were the first objects of the people's wrath.  Some at\nlength left off staring at the king and queen, and seizing the three men\nin yellow liveries, would have massacred them, if the Assembly had not\nsent a force to rescue them.\n\nGlad was the poor queen to get out of sight of the hundreds of thousands\nof gazers, and to be within the courts of the Tuileries: but she found\nlittle comfort there.  Three women only were appointed to wait on her;\nand those three were Madame R---the spy, her sister, and niece.  It was\nonly after the king had remonstrated with General Lafayette, that the\nqueen could obtain the attendance of her former servants.  She much\nneeded the presence of some to whom she could speak without restraint;\nand yet this was an indulgence she found it prudent to wait for.\nImmediately on her arrival she caused these few lines, unsigned, to be\nforwarded by a faithful hand to Madame Campan:--\"I dictate this from my\nbath, by which my bodily strength at least may be recruited.  I can say\nnothing of the state of my mind.  We exist: that is all.  Do not return\ntill summoned by me.  This is very important.\"  It was not till seven or\neight weeks after that Madame Campan saw her royal mistress.  The queen\nwas then rising from bed.  She took off her cap, and showed her hair,\nwhite as any aged person's, saying that it had become bleached in one\nnight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. PLAYING FALSE.\n\nFrom this time forward, the National Guards stationed in the palace had\norders never to lose sight of the royal family.  They therefore, for\nsome weeks, kept the doors open day and night, having their eyes upon\nthe royal party all day, and upon their very beds at night.  The queen\ncaused a small bed to be placed between the door of her chamber and her\nown bed, that she might sleep or weep on her pillow without being\nexposed to the observation of her soldier-gaolers.  One night, however,\nthe officer who was on watch, perceiving that the queen was awake, and\nher attendant asleep, drew near her bed to give her some advice how she\nshould conduct herself in regard to politics.  The queen begged him to\nspeak low, that her attendant might not be disturbed.  The lady awoke,\nhowever, and was in terror when she saw with whom the queen was\nconversing.  Her majesty then used the smooth and flattering tone which\nshe always appeared to think her enemies would be pleased with, desiring\nthe lady not to be alarmed, for that this officer was an excellent man,\nno doubt truly attached to the king, though mistaken as to what were the\nintentions of both the king and herself.\n\nThe king one day rose to shut the door of the room where he was sitting\nwith his family.  The guard immediately threw it open again, saying that\nhe had orders to keep it open; and that the king would only give himself\nuseless trouble by shutting it.  The difficulty now was to find any\nopportunity for private conversation.  This was done through the\nattachment of one of the guards, who often took a very disagreeable post\nwhich nobody else desired to have.  This was in a dark corridor where\ncandles had to be used all day, and where, therefore, no sentinel would\nlike being on guard for twenty-four hours together, in the month of\nJuly.  Saint Prix, an actor, devoted, however, himself to this service,\nfor the sake of the king and queen, who often met here for short\nconversations.  Saint Prix, on these occasions, retired out of hearing,\nand gave notice if he believed anyone was coming.\n\nThis extreme of insulting rigour did not last long this time.  In August\nthe family were allowed to open and shut their doors when they pleased,\nand the king was treated with more outward respect.  The Assembly was\nthen preparing a Constitution, which it was believed the king would\nsign; and it would be well that, at the time of doing so, he should\nappear in the eyes of the world as a king, and not a prisoner who acted\nmerely upon constraint.\n\nThe new Constitution was prepared, and the king agreed to it; even\nsending a letter to the Assembly to propose to swear to the new\nConstitution in the place where it was framed,--in their chamber.  The\nmembers were highly delighted: all Paris appeared highly delighted.  The\nleaders of parties thronged to court: their majesties went to the\ntheatres; and when the deputies from the Assembly came to the palace to\nassure the king how much satisfaction was felt at this agreement of all\nparties, the queen, the princess royal, and the dauphin stood looking on\nfrom a doorway behind.  The king pointed to them, saying, \"There are my\nwife and children, who feel as I do.\"\n\nAll this, however, was false and hollow: all these celebrations were but\nmelancholy mirth.  All thinking persons must have known that the king\ncould not really approve and rejoice in a new Constitution such as the\npeople liked,--a Constitution which took from him many and great powers\nand privileges which he considered to be as truly his own as the throne\nitself.  On the other hand, the royal family believed that this act was\nonly one step towards the destruction of the monarchy altogether,--only\none stage towards their own total ruin.  So, while each party was\napplauding the other, and all wore smiles in public, there was no real\nconfidence and joy except among the ignorant and thoughtless.  After the\nqueen had assured the deputies of her approbation and pleasure, she\nsaid, in the privacy of her apartment, \"These people do not like having\nsovereigns.  We shall be destroyed by their cunning and persevering\nmanagement.  They are levelling the monarchy stone by stone.\"\n\nThe king felt the same.  After professing the utmost satisfaction and\ndelight at this settlement of affairs, and hearing from the Assembly,\nechoed by the acclamations of the people, that he had \"obtained a new\ntitle of grandeur and of glory,\" the king appeared at the door of the\napartment to which the queen had retired after the ceremony,--his face\nso pale and so wretched that the queen uttered an exclamation as she\nlooked at him.  He sank into a chair, and covered his eyes with his\nhandkerchief, saying, \"All is lost!  O, why were you a witness to this\nhumiliation?  Why did you come to France to see--\" His words were choked\nby sobs.  The queen had cast herself on her knees before him.  She now\nexclaimed to Madame Campan, \"Go!  Go!\" in a tone which conveyed, \"Why do\nyou remain to witness the humiliation of your king?\"\n\nAll Paris was illuminated at night; and the royal family were invited to\ntake a drive in the midst of the people.  They were well guarded by\nsoldiers, and received everywhere with acclamations.  One man, however,\nwith a prodigiously powerful voice, kept beside the carriage-door next\nthe queen, and as often as the crowd shouted \"Long live the king!\"\nbawled out \"No, no: don't believe them.  Long live the nation!\"  The\nqueen was impressed with the same sort of terror with which she had seen\nthe four wax-lights go out.  Though panic-struck with this ominous\nvoice, she dared not complain, nor ask to have the man removed.  While\nthe royal family were driving about the city in this false and hollow\ntriumph, a messenger was setting off for the Austrian court, with\nletters from them expressive of extreme discontent and alarm at the\npresent state of public affairs.\n\nThere were bursts of loyal feeling occasionally, which gratified the\nroyal family; but these became fewer and fewer, as it was observed that\nthey were not well taken by the leaders of the revolution.  One day this\nsummer, the Dauphin was walking on the terrace of the Tuileries.  A\ngrenadier took him in his arms, with some affectionate words; and\neverybody within sight cheered the child.  Orders, however, soon came to\nbe quiet on the terrace: the child was set down again, and the people\nwent on their way.\n\nAnother day, Louis forgot his plan of being civil to everybody.  He had\nhold of his mother's hand; and they were going to walk in the gardens.\nA loyal sentinel, lately arrived from the country, made his salute so\nearnestly that his musket rang again.  The queen saluted graciously: but\nLouis was in such a hurry that he was posting on through the gate.  His\nmother checked him, saying, \"Come, salute.  Do not be unpolite.\"\n\nSome of the first difficulties which arose under the new Constitution,\nwere of a kind which show how impossible it was for the royal family and\nthe people ever to agree in their thoughts and feelings.  The new law\nhad provided a military, and also a civil, establishment for the royal\nhousehold;--had provided what the king had declared a sufficient number\nof attendants, and described their offices,--doing away with many of the\nold forms, and with much of the absurd extravagance, of the old Court.\nIt was now in the queen's power to please the people by agreeing\ncheerfully to the new arrangements, and showing that she was not so\nproud and extravagant as she was reported to be.  Instead of this, she\nclung to the old ways, after having declared her acceptance of the new.\nShe would not appoint people to the offices agreed upon, saying that it\nwas an injury to the old nobility to let them be turned out.  To be\nsure, most of them had fled: but if they returned, what would they say,\nif they found their places filled, and the queen surrounded by persons\nof a lower rank?  One noble lady at this time resigned an office she had\nbeen left in possession of, and said she could not stay now that she was\ndeprived of her hereditary privilege of sitting on a stool unasked in\nthe queen's presence.  This grieved the queen; and she said that this\nwas, and would be, the way with the nobility.  They made no allowance\nfor her altered circumstances; but deserted her if she admitted to\noffice persons of inferior rank.  She could not do without this\nnobility: she said she could not bear to see nobody come to her\ncard-parties,--to see no throng but of servants at the king's rising and\nundressing.  Rather than give up these old ceremonies, and this kind of\nhomage, she broke through the only part of the Constitution that it was\nin her power to act upon, and insulted the feelings of the people.\nBarnave argued with her, but she would not yield.\n\nThe rejoicings for the new Constitution took place on the last day of\nSeptember.  During the rest of the year, the royal family, and the most\nconfidential of their servants, were much employed in secret\ncorrespondence with the absent princes and nobility, and with the\nforeign Courts.  Some of these letters were in cipher, and were copied\nby persons who knew nothing whatever of the meaning of what they were\nwriting.  The queen wrote almost all day long, and spent a part of the\nnights in reading.  Poor lady!  She could sleep but little.\n\nTowards the end of the year, a new alarm arose, for which one cannot but\nthink now there was very little ground; though no one can wonder that\nthe unhappy family, and the police magistrates who had the charge of\ntheir safety, were open to every impression of terror.  The king was\ntold that one of his pastrycooks was dead; and that the man's office was\nto be filled, of right, by a pastry-cook who, while waiting for this\nappointment, had kept a confectioner's shop in the neighbourhood, and\nwho was furious in his profession of revolutionary politics.  He had\nbeen heard to say that any man would be doing a public service who\nshould cut off the king; and it was feared that he might do this service\nhimself, by poisoning the king's pastry, now that he would have daily\nopportunities of doing so.  The king was particularly fond of pastry,\nand ate a great deal of it.  It would not do now suddenly to give up\neating pastry, so as to set everybody in the palace inquiring why:\nbesides, it does not seem to have occurred to the king, under any of the\ncircumstances of his life, to restrain himself in eating.  The new\npastry-cook had nothing whatever to do but to make and roll out the\ncrusts of pies and tarts; but it was thought so easy a matter to infuse\na subtle poison into any of the dishes that stood about in the kitchen,\nthat it was resolved that the king and queen should eat nothing that was\nbrought thence, except roast meat, the last thing which anyone would\nthink of poisoning.  Other dishes were to be apparently half-eaten, and\ntheir contents conveyed away.\n\nHere we see the absurdity of the old court-system, with its laws and\nformalities;--the system by which so many hangers-on were enriched, to\nthe injury of better people than themselves: and by which the king\nhimself was placed in a sort of bondage.  Any shop-keeper in Paris might\nturn away his shop-boy for insolence; any tradesman's wife might dismiss\nher cook for unwholesome cookery: but here was the sovereign of France\ncompelled to retain in his service a man whom he believed to have said\nthat it would be a meritorious act to murder him; and this man's pastry\nmust be admitted to the royal table every day!  The man held the\nreversion to the office of king's pastry-cook (the right to it when the\noccupant should die), and the right once acquired, the man could not, by\ncourt custom, be got rid of.  Thus were court offices not open to merit;\nbut conferred sometimes by favour, and sometimes for money; and greedily\ngrasped at for the great profits they yielded.  One wonders that the\nroyal family did not discover that the new state of affairs, if it\nimposed some restrictions, might have freed them from many annoyances,\nif they could have suited their conduct to their affairs.--We shall now\nsee what trouble was caused by the king's being unable to turn away a\nkitchen servant whom he could not trust.\n\nThe bread and wine wanted for the royal table were secretly provided by\na steward of the household.  The sugar was purchased by Madame Campan,\nand pounded in her apartment.  She also provided the pastry, of which\nthe king was so fond; purchasing it as if for herself, sometimes of one\nconfectioner and sometimes of another.  All these things were locked up\nin a cupboard in the king's study, on the ground-floor.  The royal\nfamily chose to wait on themselves; so, when the table was spread, the\nservants went out, leaving a dumb-waiter and bell beside each chair.\nThen Madame Campan appeared with the bread, wine, sugar, and pastry,\nwhich were put under the table, lest any of the attendants should enter.\nThe princesses drank no wine.  The king drank about half a bottle; and\nwhen he had done he poured into the bottle from which he had drunk about\nhalf of that of which he dared not drink; and this latter bottle, with\nsome of the pastry from the kitchen, was carried away by Madame Campan\nafter dinner.  At the end of four months, the heads of the police gave\nnotice that the danger from poisoning was over; that the plans of the\nking's enemies were changed, and that future measures would be directed\nagainst the throne, and not the life of the monarch.  Meantime, did not\nevery labouring man who could supply his family with bread take his meal\nin more cheerfulness and comfort than this unhappy king?\n\nEverything went wrong.  The royal party had never been remarkable for\nsuccess in their undertakings; and now all that they did turned to their\nruin.  They corresponded at once with the emigrant princes, and with\nthose leaders at home who were attached to the Constitution; and when,\nas might have been expected, they found that they could not please both,\nthey distrusted and withdrew from those who were best able to help them.\nThey would not follow Barnave's advice.  They believed General\nDumouriez a traitor, and broke off from him when he was perfectly\nsincere in his wish to save them, and had more power to do so than all\ntheir emigrant friends together.  They distrusted Lafayette; and when, a\nfew weeks later, they were in deeper distress than ever, but might have\nbeen protected, and taken to Rouen by Lafayette's army, the queen\nrefused, saying in private that Lafayette had been offered to them as a\nresource, but that they had rather perish than owe their safety to the\nman who had most injured them, or even be obliged to treat with him.\nThus, rejecting those who could help them, and relying on those who\ncould not, this unwise and unhappy family went on to their ruin.\n\nThe foreign courts and emigrant princes were preparing to invade France;\nand the consequence was that the poor helpless king had to do an act\nwhich would have been ridiculous, if it were not too sad to laugh at.\nAs pretended Constitutional King and Head of the Nation, he had to\nbehave in public towards these foreign princes as if they were enemies,\nwhen it was for his sake that they were levying armies.  By his private\nletters, written in cipher, and sent in secret, he was urging them to\nmake haste to march to his rescue; and at the very same time he had to\ngo to the Assembly and propose that they should declare war against\nthese enemies of the nation.  He said this with the tears in his eyes.\nIt was on the 20th of April that he endured this humiliation.  What man\nof spirit would not rather have taken one side or the other, at all\nhazards, than have played such a double part as this?  If he could act\nwith the people in reforming their affairs, well and good.  If he could\nnot,--if he believed them all wrong, and that it was his sacred duty to\nstand by the old order of things, how much more respectable it would\nhave been to have said so,--to have declared, \"You may imprison me--you\nmay destroy me,--but I will stand by my throne and its powers!\"  In that\ncase, the worst he could have been charged with would have been a\nmistake.  As it was, he stood before the Assembly an object of universal\ncontempt,--proposing, with tears in his eyes, a declaration of war\nagainst those who were preparing war at his desire, and for his sake;\nand everyone knowing that it was so.\n\nHe and the queen seemed never to have understood or believed what was\ncarefully pointed out to them by the advisers whom they distrusted--that\nthis making war in their behalf could not end well for them.  If their\nforeign friends should be beaten, they would be left more helpless and\ndespised than ever.  If the French should be beaten, the frightened and\nangry people would be sure to treat with more and more rigour--and\nperhaps with fury--the family who had brought a foreign enemy upon them.\nTheir advisers must have been glad at last to be rejected and\ndismissed; for it must have been provoking to discover, at every turn,\nthe double dealing of the king and queen; and very melancholy to see\nthem perpetually pursuing the exactly opposite course to that which was\nnoble and wise.  One wonders whether, if little Louis had lived to be a\nman, he would have been as ignorant, selfish, and unwise;--whether there\nis anything in belonging to the old royal family of France which stands\nbetween its princes and wisdom and knowledge.  If so, one is less sorry\nthat he died so early as he did.\n\nBarnave's last words impressed the feelings of the queen, but had no\nother effect.  He begged to see her once more before he left Paris; and\nthen withdrew from public affairs.  He said, \"Your misfortunes, madam,\nand those of the country, had determined me to devote myself to your\nservice.  I see that my advice does not accord with your majesty's\nviews.  I augur little success from the plan which you have been induced\nto follow.  You are too far from the help you rely on, and you will be\nlost before it can reach you.  I earnestly hope that I may be mistaken\nin this prophecy.  At all events, I am sure of losing my head for the\ninterest I have felt in your affairs, and the services I have\nendeavoured to render you.  I only ask as a recompense the honour of\nkissing your hand.\"\n\nThe queen shed tears as she extended her hand to him, and often\nafterwards spoke of Barnave with regard.  It does not appear, however,\nthat either she or the king called in question their own conduct with\nregard to these men.  They induced them to devote themselves to a most\nhazardous service--summoned them to secret interviews in the palace, in\nthe night, in dark corridors, or on back staircases, where some spy or\nanother was sure to see them, and report of them to the jealous people;\nand, after all this, they were dismissed, and left unprotected by the\nexact contrary of their advice being pursued.  Barnave's dismal\npredictions were all fulfilled.  The royal family did sink down into\ndestruction; and he himself perished, as he had foretold.  He now left\nParis, and married at Grenoble.  The next August, less than three months\nafter his last interview with the queen, his correspondence with her and\nthe king was found in a chest in the palace; and orders were sent to\narrest him, and imprison him at Grenoble.  He lay in prison fifteen\nmonths, and was then brought to Paris, and tried for his life.  He made\na noble defence; but it was of no avail.  He was beheaded on the 29th of\nOctober, 1793.  When on the scaffold, he seemed suddenly struck with the\ninfamy of the treatment he had met with on every side.  He stamped with\nhis foot, and exclaimed, \"This, then, is the reward of all that I have\ndone for liberty!\"  He was only thirty-two years of age.  His unwise and\nmiserable sovereign was not living to mourn the destruction he had\nbrought on this high-minded man; and the fair royal hand which he had so\ndesired to kiss had become cold in death some days before.\n\nTo return to the spring of 1792.  The palace was now as dismal an abode\nas ever children grew up in.  The king's temper and manners gave way\nentirely.  For ten days he never once spoke, except to say the words\nnecessary in the game of backgammon, which he played with his sister\nevery day after dinner.  The queen kneeled to him, imploring him to\nexert himself.  When this availed nothing, she endeavoured to arouse him\nby the most frightful representations she could make of the danger they\nwere all in--a danger which increased every day, and which required that\nhe should act, and not sit sulking, while the hours flew by which were\nbringing destruction on their heads.  She sometimes expressed sympathy\nand tenderness; sometimes showed him his children, and besought him to\nact, for their sakes: and sometimes she asked him proudly whether, if\nthey must perish, it would not be better to die with dignity and honour\nthan to wait sullenly, as if inviting the rabble to come and tread their\nlives out on the floor of their own palace?\n\nIn one instance, she prevailed with him against his judgment; and in\nfive days, after, bitterly repented it.  There was no use in persuading\nhim to a single spirited act now and then, when he had not resolution to\nfollow it up by others: and so she found.  In June, the Assembly wished\nto banish all the clergy, and to form a camp of twenty-thousand men,\nunder the walls of Paris.  The king would have agreed, telling the queen\nthat the people only wanted a pretence for a general insurrection; and\nthat it would burst forth at the moment of his refusing anything they\nwished.  The queen, however, induced him to use his lawful power of\ndisapproving and forbidding these measures.  This happened on the 15th\nof June.  When he declared to his ministers his intention of doing this,\nthree days before, they remonstrated, and the wife of one of them,\nMadame Roland, wrote a letter, in her husband's name, to the king; a\nletter so plain spoken that the king and queen could not brook it; and\nthe ministry were all turned out next morning.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10. THE MOB IN THE PALACE.\n\nThe angry people rose.  Twenty-thousand of the poorest, dirtiest, and\nmost savage, went to the magistrates in a body, to declare their\nintention of planting the Tree of Liberty on a terrace of the Tuileries,\non the 20th; and of presenting, at the same time, petitions to the king\nagainst his late prohibitions about the priests and the army.  It was\neasy to see what sort of petitions these were likely to be; but it had\nbecome difficult to make preparation for any expected public event,--\nthere were so many opinions to be consulted, and so much suspicion was\nabroad.\n\nEarly in the morning of the 20th, a tall Lombardy poplar, which the\npeople called their tree of liberty, was lying on a car in the lower\npart of the city, and the people were collecting in multitudes to make a\nprocession with it to the palace.  A messenger from the magistrates\nspoke to the people against their scheme; but they said they were only\ngoing to do what they had a right to do: it was lawful to petition; and\nthat was their errand.  So, on they went, their numbers being swelled by\ngroups from every by-street on their way.  They drew two pieces of\ncannon with them, and carried abundance of tricolour flags and ribbons;\nand also various significant emblems, one of which was a bullock's heart\nwith a spear through it, labelled \"the Aristocrat's heart.\"  The\nmagistrates next met them: but again the crowd declared they intended\nonly what was lawful, and pushed on.\n\nThey read their address in the Assembly, and then went, dancing and\nshouting, to plant their tree.  The iron gates of the Tuileries were all\nshut, and National soldiers and cannon appeared within; so that the tree\ncould not be planted on the terrace, as designed.  There was a convent\ngarden near, which served their purpose, and there was the tree of\nliberty erected.\n\nWhile this was doing, the Assembly dispersed till evening.  The crowd\ndesired that the king would come out, and hear their petition.  They\nwaited and waited, pressing against the iron gates, till some were near\nbeing pressed to death, and were not in the better humour for that.  The\nking did not appear.  After a while, the guard within were told that, if\nthe king would not come out to his people, his people would go in to\nhim.  As usual, there was no decision in the treatment of the people.\nAfter some hesitation, the guards opened one of the gates.  The\nmultitude swarmed in; rushed at a wooden door of the palace; shivered\nit; and the royal household were at once at their mercy.\n\nNow at last the sovereign and his craving people met, face to face: met,\ntoo, that they might petition, and he reply.  But they were no longer\nfitted for coming to an understanding.  They despised him as weak, and a\ndouble-dealer; and he despised them for their ignorance, their tatters,\nand dirt.  He showed this day that he was no coward.  He was indolent,\nirresolute, and unable to act; but he could endure.  After this day, no\none could, unrebuked, call him a coward.  When the mob began battering\nupon the door of the room in which he was, he ordered it to be thrown\nopen.  Some of the gentlemen of his household had rushed in through\nanother door, and requested him to stand in the recess of a large\nwindow.  They drove up a heavy table before him, and ranged themselves\nin front of it.  They begged him not to be alarmed.  \"Put your hand on\nmy heart,\" replied the king, \"and see if I am afraid.\"  The Princess\nElizabeth flew to see what was doing to her brother.  She heard fierce\nthreats from the mob against the queen.  They vowed they would have the\nblood of the mischievous Austrian woman.  The attendants begged the\nprincess to go away from this scene.  \"No,\" said she, \"let them take me\nfor the queen, and then she may have time to escape.\"  They forced her\naway, however, with what emotions of admiration words cannot express.\n\nThe king demanded of the riotous crowd what it was that they wanted.\nThey cried that they would have the patriot ministers back again, and no\nprohibition about the clergy and the army.  The king replied that this\nwas not the way, nor the time, to settle such matters.  Those who heard\nhim must have respected him for having at last given a good and decided\nanswer.  During the rest of the time, about three hours, he stood in the\nrecess of the window, while the mob passed to and fro before the broad\ntable which stood between him and them.  At the very beginning of the\nscene one of the people handed him a red woollen cap, such as the\nfurious revolutionary people had taken to wearing, to show their\npatriotism.  This cap the king was bid to wear.  He put it on; and it\nwas matter of complaint against him afterwards by his aristocratic\nadherents, that he had worn the red cap for three hours.  The fact was\nthat he did not feel the cap on the top of his hair, matted with pomatum\nand powder as hair then was, and forgot it, till his family noticed it\non his meeting them again.  He declared himself thirsty, and a\nragamuffin handing him a half-empty bottle, he drank from it.\n\nThe queen had attempted, with her children, to reach the room where the\nking was, but could not.  Each seems to have believed that it was the\nintention of the mob to murder one or both of them, and there was much\nsaid of the murderers' arms which were carried; but it does not now\nappear probable that there was any such intention.  There was nothing to\nprevent its execution; for the multitude could in a moment have\noverpowered ten times the number of adherents that were about the royal\nfamily; and the Assembly were not seen or heard of till past six, when\nthe mob had been parading about the palace for an hour and a half.\nHowever, the royal party did expect murder, and their suspense of three\nhours must have been terrible.\n\nThe queen was secured, like the king, behind a table.  She put a large\ntricolor cockade upon her head, and placed the Dauphin on a table before\nher.  There sat poor little Louis, with a great red woollen cap covering\nhis head, down to his very eyes, seeing how his governess and the other\nladies behind his mother were terrified, and perhaps finding out how his\nmother's heart was swelling, and well-nigh bursting, while her face and\nmanner were calm and dignified.  He saw, too, the horrible things that\nwere shown in the procession.  The bullock's heart was there; and there\nwas a little gibbet, with a little doll hung to it, and his mother's\nname written below.  He heard many dreadful things said to her; but he\nalso heard her answers, and saw that they pleased the people.  One angry\nwoman stood and railed at the queen.  The queen asked whether she had\never seen her before, and whether she had ever done her any injury.\n\"No,\" said the woman; \"but it is you who have done the country so much\nharm.\"\n\n\"You have been told so; but you are mistaken,\" said the queen.  \"Being\nthe wife of the king of France, and mother of the Dauphin, I am a\nFrenchwoman.  I shall never see my own country again; it is in France\nthat I must be happy or unhappy.  I was very happy till you began to\nhate me.\"  The woman was softened at once.  She said, with tears, \"I did\nnot know you.  I see now that you are good.\"\n\nThe queen could not in the least comprehend the hatred of royalty, which\nhad now become common.  She could not comprehend it, because she was\nborn royal; and it seemed to her as natural that princes should be\nserved and obeyed by everybody below them as that children should be\nruled by their parents.  She also knew nothing of the miseries caused\nfor long years past by the abuse of power by both kings and nobles, and\nby herself among the rest.  Unconscious of all this, she could make\nnothing of what she heard this evening from a member of the Assembly.--\nSome of the members arrived at six o'clock, too late to do any good.\nThe queen directed their notice to the broken doors, bidding them\nobserve the outrageous way in which the home of the royal family had\nbeen violated.  She saw signs of emotion in the countenance of Monsieur\nMerlin de Thionville, and observed upon it.  Monsieur Merlin replied\nthat he felt for her as a woman, a wife, and mother, but that she must\nnot suppose that he shed a single tear for the king or the queen; that\nhe hated kings and queens.  It was the only feeling he had towards them;\nit was his religion.--Now, however extravagant this man's feelings might\nbe, and however harsh his expression of them, such sayings might have\nbeen a valuable lesson to one who could reflect and reason upon them,\nand diligently try to discover how such feelings could have grown up in\nmillions of minds.  This, however, the poor queen never thought of\ndoing.  She called it madness; and felt as if in Bedlam, while\nsurrounded by those who were of the same mind as Monsieur Merlin.\n\nAt last the Mayor of Paris came.  Monsieur Petion was now mayor: the\nsame who had pulled Louis's hair, on the return from Varennes, a year\nbefore.  He harangued the people: several others harangued; and at last\nthe mob marched out through the broken doors of the violated palace.  It\nwas eight in the evening.  When the members of this unhappy family could\nget to one another, again, when they felt that they were once more\nalone, they threw themselves into one another's arms, weeping bitterly.\nThe monarch and his people had met at last, face to face; and it was\nonly to find that there was, and could be, no agreement between them.\nOne of the parties must give way: the people were strong; the king was\nweak, and his ruin was now certain.  Little Louis understood nothing of\nall this; but one wonders whether he could sleep that night,--whether he\ncould forget the frightful procession he had seen filling the very rooms\nin which he lived.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. WHAT BEFELL WHILE THE QUEEN WAS HOPING.\n\nThe secret cipher letters went now faster than ever, and seem to have\nbeen so urgent about speedy help and rescue as to have appeared somewhat\npeevish to friends at a distance.  The queen's sister wrote from\nBrussels that she hoped the royal family did not doubt the anxiety of\ntheir friends: that the danger appeared indeed as pressing as it could\nbe represented; but that some prudence was necessary on the part of\nthose who were preparing help, and some patience on the part of those\nwho were awaiting it.--Alas!  It was difficult for the poor queen to be\npatient, expecting, as she did daily, the murder of the king.  Though\nthis fear seems to have been unfounded, it caused her as much suffering\nas if it had been just.--She had a breastplate made for the king, of\nsilk many times folded, and well wadded, so that it would resist the\nblow of a dagger, and even a pistol-ball.  This under-dress was made at\nMadame Campan's house; and she brought it into the palace, wearing it as\nan under-petticoat, that no one might see it.  For three days, in the\nbeginning of July, did Madame Campan wear this heavy warm petticoat\nbefore an opportunity could be found for the king to try it on.  The\noccasion for which it was wanted was the 14th of July, the anniversary\nof the destruction of the Bastille, and the date of the Independence of\nthe Nation, as the nation chose to say: on which day the king was to\nappear in public.\n\nWhen he tried on the breastplate, he said in a low voice to Madame\nCampan that he wore this to satisfy the queen, but that he was persuaded\nhe should not be assassinated, but left to be disposed of in another\nway.  The queen afterwards made Madame Campan repeat to her what the\nking had said, and then observed that this was not new to her: she had\nseen the king much occupied of late in studying the history of Charles\nthe First of England.  The king declared that he studied this history in\norder to learn how to avoid the errors of Charles in dealing with his\npeople.  Alas!  If he had done so twenty years before, it is doubtful\nwhether such study could have been of any use to a ruler who had neither\nthe knowledge nor the spirit necessary for the times.  Now it was by\nmany years too late.  No one believed in his sincerity: every one\ndespised his weakness; and he was so humbled that no act of his could\nhave the force or the grace of freedom.  The history of Charles the\nFirst is indeed a most instructive lesson to kings: but it is a lesson\nwhich must be learned and used while kings are still sitting on an\nhonoured and unshaken throne.\n\nThere were people enough in Paris grieved and shocked at the proceedings\nof the 20th of June to have made some stand in defence of the king,--\nsome delay in the dissolution of society; and these people declared\nthemselves by public acts, particularly by petitions to the Assembly.  A\nman of spirit would have seized the occasion: and if the king had been\nsuch a man, he might possibly have risen from this point out of his\nmisfortunes, and so have made a favourable day out of that most\nmiserable one.  But, as usual, the royal family overlooked the\nopportunity.  They were so occupied in looking for help from Germany,\nthat they had no attention, no trust, for friends nearer home.  The Duke\nof Brunswick was coming with an army to rescue them.  The people knew\nthis well enough; and their panic about an invasion did not make them\nlove the more the family at whose call the invaders were coming.  On the\n25th of July, the Duke of Brunswick began his march into France, and\nissued a proclamation which said that the whole French nation should be\nprotected by him in rallying round their king; but that, if any parties\nshould insult the king, or carry him away from Paris, such persons\nshould be destroyed, and Paris blown to pieces with his cannon.  As the\nFrench nation did not wish or intend to rally round their king, this\nproclamation made them furious, and caused the destruction of the royal\nfamily in a shorter time than it would otherwise have happened; if it\nhad otherwise happened at all.  Was ever such mournful folly heard of as\nmarks the whole history of this unhappy king?  One's compassion,\nhowever, is chiefly for the three who were victims of this folly without\nsharing it.  The king and queen brought much of their misery upon\nthemselves; but the sweet Princess Elizabeth and the two children\nsuffered without having sinned.  The darkness of their lot was now\ngathering fast about them.\n\nIt was impossible, after the late proceedings, to consider the palace\nsafe at any hour.  The queen feared assassination for herself as a\nforeigner, and a trial for the king, preparatory to his death upon the\nscaffold; and she desired to guard against any seizure of papers, which\nmight now take place at any time.  She deposited her ready money in the\nhands of a faithful person; and the king employed his old companion,\nGamin, the locksmith, to make, in great secrecy, a safe for papers in a\nplace where no one would suspect its existence.  This fellow betrayed\nthe secret; first, luckily, to some friends; and the queen, hearing of\nthis, persuaded the king to empty out the safe.  Gamin afterwards\npublicly informed the enemies of the king of this cupboard, and moreover\nswore that the king attempted to poison him when it was done, that the\nsecret might be safe.  This absurd calumny was believed, like everything\nelse that was said against the royal family; and the wretch had a\npension given him.  Such was the king's reward for submitting, like a\ntimid apprentice, to this man's insolence, while learning lock-making\nfrom him, for ten years past.\n\nGeneral Lafayette came to Paris, to remonstrate, at the head of\ntwenty-thousand petitioners, against the late treatment of the king.  Of\ncourse, those who had done it looked coldly upon him; and so did the\nking.  The king forbade his officers to support anything proposed by\nGeneral Lafayette; and the queen refused to allow him to remove her and\nher family to the loyal city of Rouen.  Lafayette, thus unsupported, had\nto hasten back to the army; and in this way the royal family insulted\nand dismissed the last person who could have rescued them from their\nimpending fate.\n\nWhenever even the children appeared out of doors, they experienced such\ninsults that they left off going anywhere beyond the palace gardens,\nfrom which the public were excluded, in order to allow the family to\ntake the air unmolested.  Such cries, however, were heard from the\nterrace outside, that, after being twice driven in by them, the family\ngave up going out at all Louis had to give up his gardening, and the\nsight of the flowers he had sown, and to keep within doors all these\nlong bright summer days.\n\nThe queen could not sleep much; and she ordered that neither the\nshutters nor blinds of her chamber should be closed, that the nights\nmight appear less long.  One night, as Madame Campan watched beside her,\nshe fixed her eyes on the moon, and said softly, that before she saw the\nsame moon next month, she and the king should be free.  She declared\nthat their affairs were now proceeding fast and well, and told how the\narmy from Germany was to march, and how soon it might arrive.  She\nadmitted that there were alarming differences of advice and opinion\namong their followers, and spoke of the fatal consequences of the king's\nirresolution; but still she hoped that another month would set them\nfree.  She was, as usual, completely mistaken.  She found it so hard to\nbear the insults daily offered, even while expecting so speedy an end to\nthem, that she declared she should have preferred imprisonment in a\ntower, on a lonely sea-shore, to her present condition.  On their way\nthrough the corridor to the chapel, one Sunday, the king and she were\ngreeted by the cry from some of the guards of \"Long live the king!\" but\nothers broke in with \"No, no; no king!  Down with the veto!\"  This\nstruck upon the queen's heart; for it was she who had persuaded the king\nto put his veto, or prohibition, upon the banishment of the priests.\nWhen they were in the chapel, something worse happened.  The passage \"He\nbringeth down the mighty from their seat,\" had to be sung; and when the\nchoir came to it, they sang, or shouted it, three times as loud as any\nother part of the service.  The king's adherents were so angry at this\nthat when the words came \"And may the Lord keep the king in safety,\" the\nroyalists shouted out three times \"And the Queen.\"  This indecent\ncontention went on during the whole time of service; and the royal\nfamily found that they were no longer permitted even to worship in\npeace.\n\nOn the 9th of August, there was much noise and confusion throughout\nParis; and it became known that an insurrection was to take place the\nnext morning.  Louis knew that something was dreaded, but he slept as\nusual.  His servant, Clery, put him to bed at half-past eight, while it\nwas still daylight, and then went out, to try what he could learn of the\nproceedings of the people.  The king and queen supped at nine o'clock.\nWhile Madame Campan waited on them at table, a noise was heard outside\nthe door.  Madame Campan went to see what it was.  Two of the guards\nwere fighting,--one abusing the king, and the other insisting that he\nwas sincere in professing to stand by the Constitution.  If the queen\nhad not before given over all idea of safety, she would now have done\nso.  She said she knew that some of their fiercest enemies were among\ntheir guards;--not their Swiss guards, but those who wore the national\nuniform.\n\nThis was a terrible night.  It was oppressively hot; and the rooms of\nthe palace were crowded with gentlemen, adherents of the court, who had\ncome to devote themselves finally for their king and his family.  The\nSwiss guards,--picked Swiss soldiers, strong and brave, hired to guard\nthe person and palace of the sovereign,--stood silently at their posts,\ntheir red uniforms contrasting with the black clothes of the seven\nhundred gentlemen who waited to see what they were to do.  Though these\nseemed a large number when collected under a roof,--though the rooms\nwere so full that the windows had to be thrown open, and the mayor\nPetion went down to walk in the gardens because the heat was so\noppressive within, this was no force to oppose to a siege from the\npopulation of Paris.  The king caused the plan of defence, prepared by\nGeneral Viomenil, to be communicated to an officer, who said to Madame\nCampan, \"Put your jewels and money into your pockets.  There is no\nchance for us.  The measures of defence are good for nothing.  Our only\nchance is in the resolution of the king; and with all his virtues, he\nhas not that.\"\n\nNever yet had the king cut such a wretched figure as on this occasion.\nHe often congratulated himself on no blood having been shed by his\norder: and this was one of his dying consolations.  It seems never to\nhave occurred to him that his weakness caused more destruction than even\ncruelty would have done.  It caused not only the loss of many lives; it\nencouraged the breaking up of society from its very foundations; it\nspared the wicked, while it betrayed the faithful.  It did moral injury,\nwhich it may be worse to have to answer for in the end than some acts of\nbloodshed.  He would not have half a dozen shots fired to make a way for\nhis coach over the bridge of Varennes; but he deserted, without a\nmoment's scruple, his devoted Swiss guards, as we shall see; and as he\nrefused to suffer with them, he may be considered answerable for their\nlives.\n\nThe clang of bells was heard by the inmates of the palace, as they\nstood, this summer night, by the open windows.  Steeple after steeple\nrang out; and every one knew that this was the token of insurrection in\nthe respective parishes.  Petion had been sent for, to answer for what\nwas doing; he had not been civilly treated within doors, as might be\nsupposed,--the king speaking very roughly to him.  He could not get away\nagain, as the gates were all guarded, and no one allowed to pass; so\nthat the only thing he could well do was to walk in the gardens.\n\nAt four in the morning, the National Assembly sent for him, to appear\nand give an account of Paris.  Considering that he had been pacing the\ngarden walks all night, the Mayor of Paris was as little able as anybody\nto give an account of the city; but he was glad to get away, considering\nhis situation one of great danger.\n\nThe number of the Swiss guards was a thousand.  Their post was within\nthe Tuileries.  Outside were squadrons under the command of Mandat, a\nloyal officer, who kept them ranged with their cannon round the outer\nenclosures of the palace.  Just at dawn, Mandat was sent for by the\nmagistrates of the city, and went alone, suspecting no danger.  To his\namazement, he found that, with the exception of the mayor and one or two\nmore, the entire magistracy was changed, and now composed of furious\nrevolutionary men.  They arrested him, and ordered him to prison; but\nthe mob seized him on the steps, and murdered him.  The question next\nwas, what his soldiers would do now they had lost their commander.  They\nwere hungry and weary; and were heard to say how sad it would be to fire\nupon their own countrymen--how much easier to side with them.  Now was\nthe moment for the king to speak and act.  Now he was told what a gloomy\nand uncertain temper these squadrons were in.  He owed it to his office,\nto his family, to his adherents, to his Swiss guards, to endeavour to\nconfirm these soldiers in their duty to him.  A word, a look, a gesture\nmight, in the right moment, have done it.  What did he do?\n\nIn the middle of the night, while all was supposed to be well among the\nsoldiers outside, the king had retired for a while.  When he appeared\nagain, on the arrival of fresh tidings, it was seen, by the powder being\nrubbed off from one side of his head, that he had been lying down to get\na little sleep.  The queen and Princess Elizabeth also withdrew; but not\nto sleep.  They went, with Madame Campan to attend upon them, to a small\nroom on the ground-floor, where they lay down on couches.  In preparing\nto lie down, the princess took out the cornelian pin which fastened her\ndress, and showed Madame Campan what was engraved upon it.  It was the\nstem of a lily, with the inscription, \"Oblivion of wrongs: forgiveness\nof injuries.\"\n\n\"I fear,\" said the princess, \"our enemies do not regard that maxim: but\nwe must, nevertheless.\"  The ladies conversed sadly enough, but little\nimagining what was happening to Mandat.  At last they heard a shot.\nThey sprang from their couches, observing that this was the first shot,\nbut would not be the last.  They must go to the king.  They did so,\ndesiring Madame Campan to follow, and to be in waiting with the other\nladies.--At four o'clock, the queen came out of the king's apartment,\nsaying that she had no longer any hope whatever, as Mandat was killed.\nYet the king was going out to review the squadrons who had lost their\ncommander; and the wife of a resolute and spirited king would not have\nbeen without hope.  She would have hoped much from the king's presence\nand appeal.  It was because she knew the king so well that she had no\nhope.\n\nOrders were given for Louis to be taken up and brought immediately: and\nhe was presently ready,--at a little before five, when (it being the\n10th of August) it was quite light.  His sister appeared too, and the\nwhole family went out to review the soldiers, as it was said, and to see\nthe preparations for defence.  Louis had hold of his father's hand.  At\nfirst, a few voices cried \"Long live the king!\" but the king, pale and\nsilent, walked on without taking any notice; and in a few moments there\nwas a long growl, which burst into a clamour of \"Long live the nation!\"\nSome of the gunners thrust themselves forward, and shook their fists in\nthe king's face, uttering the grossest insults.  Some of the attendants\npushed them back; but the king, now white as the wall, said not a word.\nFollowed by the ladies of his family, he walked along the line, and back\nagain, leaving nothing but contempt behind.  \"All is lost,\" said the\nqueen to Madame Campan, as she entered her apartments: \"the king showed\nno energy; and this review has done nothing but harm.\"  What a lot was\nhers!  To be dragged down, with her children, to destruction, by the\napathy of a husband, while she herself had spirit enough to have ruled\nan empire, but must not now exert it, because it would exasperate the\npeople to have the foreigner, the Austrian, meddle with the affairs of\nFrance!\n\nWhat was to be done next?  The Swiss, and the gentlemen and servants of\nthe court, were all that now remained to be depended upon.  The Swiss\nstood firm as their own Alps.  The household arranged themselves in the\napartments, armed, and ready for the assault from without: though no one\nof them could have hope of victory, or any expectation but of\ndestruction.  In this terrible hour, however, they jested; and upon a\nmelancholy subject.  They were miserably armed; and they quizzed one\nanother and themselves for the appearance they made.  None had more than\na sword and a pair of pistols: one page had only a single pocket-pistol;\nand another page and equerry had broken a pair of tongs, and taken each\na half.\n\nThe insurgents were now surrounding the Tuileries, and filling the\nneighbourhood: and it seemed probable that the gunners, placed outside\nfor the defence of the palace, would turn their cannon against it.  The\nking sent a messenger to the Assembly, to request them to depute some of\ntheir body to be a safeguard to the throne in this extremity.  The\nAssembly took no notice of the message; but went on with their regular\nbusiness.\n\nThe magistrate of the district saw now, from the temper of the people\noutside, no chance but of destruction to every individual within the\npalace, if once the siege began.  The error was in ever pretending to\nmake a defence, while such a helpless being as the king must be the one\nto give orders.  It was too late to help that now.  There were the\ncannon, with the gunners surlily asking whether it was expected of them\nto fire upon the people: and there were the people, too many and too\nangry to be got rid of.  The magistrate of the district, Roederer,\nvisited the palace, and begged a private interview with the king.  He\nwas shown into a small apartment, which the king and queen entered.\nRoederer proposed their going over to the Assembly without a moment's\ndelay, to commit themselves and their children to the protection of the\nrepresentatives of the people.  \"No, no!\" exclaimed the queen, blushing,\nno doubt, at the thought of the infamy of deserting, at the fatal\nmoment, their adherents, their steady Swiss, and the servants of the\nhousehold.  Roederer told her that by remaining she would render herself\nresponsible for the lives of the whole family; for that no power could\nsave them within the walls of the palace.  She said no more.  The king\nsat, the picture of indifference, with his hands upon his knees,\nlistening.  When there was a pause, and he must say something, he looked\nover his shoulder to the queen, and said, \"Let us go.\"\n\nAs they left the apartment the queen told Madame Campan to remain till\neither the family should return, or she should be sent for to join her\nmistress,--no one knew where.  The family never returned.\n\nOnly two ladies were permitted to accompany them,--the Princess de\nLamballe and Madame de Tourzel.  In order to fulfil her duty,--in order\nnot to desert Louis,--his governess was compelled to leave her daughter\nPauline, only seventeen years old, in this besieged palace, among the\nsoldiers.  Pauline escaped with life and safety, and joined her mother\nsoon after.\n\nAs the king walked through the apartments of the palace, followed by his\nfamily, Roederer went before him, saying, \"Make way!  The king is going\nto the Assembly.\"  How these words must have pierced the hearts of his\ndevoted servants, of his faithful Swiss!  This was the reward of their\nbrave fidelity!  The king was leaving those who were ready to die rather\nthan desert him.  He was going to walk out at an open door, while they\nwere shut in, to be shot down like game in an enclosure.\n\nThe family had but a short way to go; and their passage to the Assembly\nwas watched from the windows by some of the doomed friends whom they\nleft behind.  They walked between two rows of guards; but were yet so\npressed upon that the queen was robbed of her watch and purse.  Louis\nheld his mother's hand, and amused himself with kicking the dead leaves\nas he walked.  A gigantic man, a ringleader of the mob, snatched up the\nboy, and carried him.  The queen screamed with terror, and was near\nfainting: but the man said, \"Do not be frightened: I will do him no\nharm.\"  He merely carried him, and then set him down at the gate, where\na deputation from the Assembly came out, to meet the royal family.  From\nthe palace windows the royal family were seen to enter that gate; and\nthose who saw it well knew that all hope for the royal cause was now\nover.\n\nThe assailants without and the defenders in the outer court of the\nTuileries did not know of the departure of the royal family; and the\nbattle therefore began with fury.  The gentlemen and servants had now\nonly to think of saving themselves as they could.  Some escaped from\nwindows, and others under disguises: but many were murdered.  The fate\nof the Swiss was dreadful.  They fought bravely, and kept their ranks.\nAt last, a messenger arrived with a written order from the king that\nthey should cease firing.  But they were still fired upon from without.\nThey knew not what to do, and dispersed.  Some few reached the Assembly,\nand were sheltered there.  Some few more fled into private houses; but,\nas for the rest, their blood streamed on the floor of the palace, and\ntheir bodies blocked up the doorways.  Some lay dead on the terraces,\nand others were shot down from street to street as they fled, fighting\ntheir way.  From fifty to eighty were marched as prisoners to the Hall\nwhere the magistrates were sitting: but the crowd broke in upon them on\nthe way, and slaughtered them every one.  Their last thought might well\nhave been, \"Put not your trust in princes.\"  But perhaps more painful\nthoughts still were in their fainting hearts; and before their swimming\neyes might be visions of their homes in the Swiss valleys, and their\nwives and children singing of them, while tending the cows on the\nmountain side.  Yet the king who, by his orders and arrangements, gave\nthem over to such a death as this, and deserted them at the crisis, was\nfor ever consoling himself with the thought that not a drop of blood had\never been shed by his command.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Lucerne, in Switzerland, there is a monument to\nthe memory of these men.  Above a little lake rises a precipitous face\nof rock.  In the midst of this the monument is hollowed out.  The Swiss\nlion, wounded and dying, grasps with its failing claws the French\nshield, with the royal lilies upon it.--If the king had sent his family\nto the Assembly for safety, and himself remained to fall with his\nadherents, this monument would not have been, as it is now, a reproach\nupon his memory, durable as Swiss honour and as the everlasting rock.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. PRISON.\n\nThe royal family were placed for three days in a forsaken monastery,\nwhere four cells were allotted to them and their attendants.  There\nMadame Campan went to them on the 11th.  In one cell the king was having\nhis hair dressed.  In another, the queen was weeping on a mean bed,\nattended by a woman, a stranger, but civil enough.  The children soon\ncame in, and the queen lamented bitterly over them, mourning that they\nshould be deprived of so fine an inheritance as this great kingdom; for\nshe now knew, she said, that the monarchy was really coming to an end.\nShe spoke of the kingdom, with its many millions of inhabitants, as she\nwould have spoken of a landed estate with the animals upon it,--as a\nproperty with which monarchs ought to be able to do what they like.\nSuch was her idea of royalty.  She lamented in this crisis over her\nboy's loss of the crown, as if that were the greatest of the misfortunes\nthat awaited him--as if he could not possibly be happy anywhere but on\nthe throne.  Such was her idea of human life.  She was brought up with\nsuch ideas, and was to be pitied, not blamed, for acting and feeling\naccordingly.\n\nShe mentioned to Madame Campan her vexation at the king having been so\neager about his dinner, and having eaten and drunk so heartily in the\npresence of malignant strangers, on that dreadful day, and in this\nmiserable place.  She need not have minded this so much; for everybody\nnow knew the king and his ways, and how he never dreamed, under any\ncircumstances, of not eating and drinking as usual.\n\nThe departure from the Tuileries had been so sudden that the family had\nat first only the clothes that they wore.  Louis would have wanted for\nclean linen, if the lady of the English ambassador had not kindly\nthought of the poor boy, and sent him some clothes.\n\nOn the 13th, the family were removed to the prison of the Temple; and\nMadame Campan, and almost all the servants of the royal household, lost\nsight of their master and mistress for ever.  It was seven in the\nevening when the removal to the Temple took place; and then there was so\nmuch disputing about where the family should be accommodated, whether in\nthe tower of the building or another part of it, that poor Louis, though\novercome with sleep, had to sit up while his father and mother supped.\nAt eleven o'clock Madame de Tourzel took him to the Tower, to find some\nplace where he might go to rest.  When the others lay down, at one in\nthe morning, there was no preparation made for their comfort.  The\nPrincess Elizabeth, with her waiting-woman, slept in the kitchen.\nLouis, with his governess and lady-attendant, slept in the\nbilliard-room.  It was all confusion and discomfort.  The next morning,\nLouis was taken to breakfast with his mother; and then all went together\nto see the best rooms in the Tower, and arrange how they were to be\noccupied.\n\nIt soon became unnecessary to plan for so many people; for an order\narrived for the royal attendants to be removed, to make room for a new\nset appointed by the Common Council.  The king and queen refused to be\nwaited upon by strangers, who were, no doubt, to act as spies: but their\nown people were removed notwithstanding.  On the night of the 19th, the\nking's valets were carried off; and then the Princess de Lamballe, and\nMadame de Tourzel and her daughter, and even the waiting-women.  Louis\nwas taken up, and carried to his mother's apartment, that he might not\nbe left quite alone.  He probably slept after thus losing his governess\na second time: but his mother and aunt did not.  They were too anxious\nto think of sleeping: too anxious to know what to believe, and whether,\nas they had been assured, they should see their companions again in the\nmorning.  In the morning, instead of the ladies, came the news that they\nwere all removed to another prison.  At nine o'clock, one of the king's\nvalets reappeared.  He alone had been pronounced innocent of any\noffence, and permitted to return to his master.\n\nClery, the Dauphin's valet at the Tuileries, had been on the watch for\nan opportunity of returning to his office, after having been left behind\non the dreadful 10th of August, when his life had been in the utmost\ndanger.  He now heard that the mayor was about to appoint two more\nservants to wait on the king and the dauphin; and he so earnestly\nentreated that he might be one, that he obtained the appointment.  No\none was more pleased than Louis to see Clery again.\n\nIt was on the 26th of August, at eight in the evening, that Clery\nentered once more upon his service.  The queen desired him to resume his\nattendance upon the Dauphin, and to unite with the king's valet in\nrendering the family as comfortable as they could.  The princesses had\nnow been eight days without the attendance of their women; and their\nhair much needed proper combing and arranging.  At supper they asked\nClery whether he could dress their hair.  His reply was, that he should\nbe happy to do whatever they desired.  The officer on guard commanded\nhim aloud to be more guarded in his replies.  Poor Clery was aghast at\nfinding that he must not be civil in his expressions to his master and\nmistress.\n\nClery did not devote himself exclusively to the service of the Dauphin;\nfor there were at first few, and latterly no other servants than\nhimself, except a man named Tison, and his wife, who did the rough work\nof the chambers for a time.\n\nThe way in which the royal prisoners passed their days, for some few\nmonths, was as follows:\n\nThe king rose at six in the summer, and at seven as winter came on.  He\nshaved himself, and then Clery dressed his hair, and finished his\ntoilette.  The king retired to a small turret-chamber, which he made his\nstudy, and there kneeled at his prayers, and read religious books till\nnine o'clock, his guard always taking care that the door was half-open;\nso that the king could not even kneel to pray in entire privacy.--\nMeantime Clery made the bed, and prepared the room for breakfast, and\nthen went down to take up little Louis.  After washing and dressing him,\nhe dressed the queen's hair, and then went to the other princesses, to\ndo the same service for them.  This was the opportunity seized for\ntelling the family any news he had been able to obtain of what was going\non out of doors.  It was almost the only occasion on which he could\nspeak without being overheard by the guards: and even this was contrived\nwith caution.  Clery showed, by an appointed sign, that he had something\nto say; and one of the princesses engaged the guard at the door in\nconversation, while Clery whispered his news into the ear of the other,\nas he bent over her head, to dress her hair.--At nine, the princesses\nand Louis went up to the king's apartment to breakfast, when Clery\nwaited upon them, making haste, when the meal was done, to go down and\nget the other beds made.  At ten, the whole family came down to the\nqueen's apartment, and began the business of the day.  Louis said his\ngeography lesson to his father, read history with his mother, and\nlearned poetry by heart; and did his sums with his aunt.  His sister did\nher lessons at the same time.  Hers lasted till twelve, while Louis's\nwere over by eleven, when he played by himself for an hour.  The queen\ngenerally worked at her tapestry-frame; but sometimes she wrote out\nextracts from books for her daughter's use.  When she did this, and when\nthe young princess wrote out sums into her cyphering-book, the officer\non guard used to stand looking over their shoulders, to see that they\ndid not, under false pretences, carry on any secret correspondence.  It\nis believed that they did so, notwithstanding all this vigilance; but\nhow they contrived it will probably never be known; for, of course, they\nhave not told their plan, and their gaolers were not aware of it.\n\nAt twelve o'clock the ladies changed their dress in the Princess\nElizabeth's room, before going out to walk in the garden.  The king and\nqueen did not relish this daily walk in the garden, because they rarely\nwent without being insulted: but they persevered as long as the practice\nwas permitted, for the sake of the children.  That Louis, particularly,\nmight have air and exercise, they would have made a point of going out,\nin all but the very worst weather.  They were, however, allowed no\nchoice.  Wet or dry, rain or shine, out they must go, at the same hour\nevery day, because the outside guard was changed at that hour; and the\nofficer chose to see, without trouble to himself, that the prisoners\nwere all safe.  Several guards were always in attendance upon the steps\nof the family as they walked; and there was only one walk which they\nmight enter, because workmen were rebuilding the walls in other parts of\nthe inclosure.  Louis would thus have benefited little by the hour or\ntwo out of doors, if it had not been for good Clery, who seems to have\nfound time to do everything that could serve or please the family.\nClery went out with them every day, and kept Louis at play the whole\ntime,--sometimes at football,--sometimes at quoits,--sometimes at\nrunning races.\n\nThis daily walk did not long continue the practice of the family; and,\nthough they thought it right not to give it up themselves, some of them\nwere very glad when it was over.  Their gaoler treated them with\nintolerable insolence.  He would not stir till they reached the door\nthey were to pass out at, and then made a prodigious jingling with his\ngreat bunch of keys, and kept them waiting, under pretence of not being\nable to find the key: then he made all the noise he could in drawing the\nbolts; and, stepping before them, stood in the doorway, with his long\npipe in his mouth, with which he puffed smoke into the face of each of\nthe princesses as she passed,--the guard bursting into loud laughs at\neach puff.  Wherever they went, the prisoners saw a guillotine, or a\ngallows, or some vile inscription chalked upon the walls.  One of these\ninscriptions was, \"Little cubs must be strangled.\"  Others threatened\ndeath, in a gibing way, to the king or the queen.  Clery one day saw the\nking reading some such threat of death, and would have rubbed it out;\nbut the king bade him let it alone.\n\nThey had one object of interest in their walks, which, however, they\nwere obliged to conceal.  Certain of their devoted friends obtained\nentrance to the houses whose back windows commanded this garden, and,\nthough afraid to make signals, looked down upon the forlorn party with\nsympathy which was well understood.  Clery one day believed that Madame\nde Tourzel had watched them during their walk; a lady very like her had\nso earnestly followed Louis with her eyes through his play.  He\nwhispered this to the Princess Elizabeth, who shed tears on hearing it;\nso persuaded had the royal family been that Madame de Tourzel had\nperished.--It was not she however: neither had she perished.  She was at\none of her country estates, hoping that she was kindly remembered by the\nroyal family, and forgotten by their enemies.\n\nOne of the most important pieces of intelligence that reached them, they\nfirst learned in the course of their walk.  A woman at a window which\noverlooked the garden watched the moment when the guards turned their\nbacks, and held up for an instant a large sheet of pasteboard, on which\nwas written \"Verdun is taken.\"  The Princess Elizabeth saw and read\nthis.  The woman no doubt thought this good news; and perhaps they, too,\nwere pleased that their friends and the foreign army were fairly in\nFrance, and had taken a town on the road to Paris: but we shall see how\nit turned out to be anything but good news.--After a few weeks they\nwalked no more in the garden, and had only such air and exercise as they\ncould obtain upon the leads of the Temple.\n\nFrom their walk they came in to dinner at two o'clock, where Clery was\nagain ready to wait, when he became the only remaining servant.  This\nwas the hour when Santerre the brewer, now commanding the National Guard\nof Paris, came daily, with two other officers, to examine all the\napartments inhabited by the family.  The king sometimes spoke to him,--\nthe queen never.\n\nAfter dinner, the king and queen played piquet or backgammon; not\nbecause they could enjoy at present any amusement of the kind, but\nbecause they found means, while bending their heads together over the\nboard, to say a few words unheard by the guard.  At four o'clock, the\nladies and children left the king, as it was his custom to sleep at this\nhour.  At six Clery and Louis entered the apartment, and Clery gave the\nboy lessons in writing, and copied, at the king's desire, passages from\nthe works of Montesquieu and others, for the use of the Dauphin.  Then\nClery took Louis to his aunt's room, where they played at ball, and\nbattledore and shuttlecock, till Louis's supper-time, at eight o'clock.\nMeanwhile the queen and the Princess Elizabeth read aloud, till eight\no'clock, when they went to Louis, to sit beside him while he had his\nsupper.  Then the king amused the children with riddles, which he had\nfound in a collection of old newspapers.  All kindly exerted themselves\nto send Louis cheerful to bed.  He was too young, they thought, to lie\ndown with so sad a heart as they each had every night in their prison.\n\nHowever busy Clery might be, he never failed to be in the king's little\nstudy at seven o'clock.  Regularly at that hour every evening, a crier\nstood in the street, close by the tower of the Temple, and proclaimed\nwhat had been done that day in the Assembly, the Magistrates' Hall, and\nin the army.  This crier was no doubt sent, or induced to stand in that\nparticular place, by friends of the royal family.  In the little\nturret-room, while all was silent there, Clery could catch what the\ncrier said: and he found means to whisper it to the queen when she had\nheard Louis say his prayers, and when Clery put him into bed.\n\nLouis had added to his prayer one for the safety and welfare of Madame\nde Tourzel.  He had so well learned the temper and feelings of the\nguards that were always about the family, that when one of them stood\nnear enough to hear the words of his prayer, he repeated the parts in\nwhich persons were named in a whisper.\n\nAt nine o'clock, Clery went down to wait at supper.  As the Dauphin was\nnever to be left alone, while such guards stood about, his mother and\naunt took it in turn to sit beside him; and Clery brought up supper for\nwhichever of them it might be.  This afforded opportunity for a few more\nwords of news, if there was any to tell.\n\nAfter supper the king attended his wife, sister, and daughter to the\nqueen's apartment, shook hands with them as he said good-night, and\nretired to his little study, where he read till midnight.  The guard was\nchanged at midnight; and the king would never go to rest till he knew\nwho was to be on guard.  If it was a stranger, he would learn his name.\nThis kept Clery up too.  After he had assisted the king to undress, he\nlay down on his small bed, which he had placed beside that of the king,\nin order to be at hand in case of danger.\n\nSuch was the course of the weary days of this unhappy family's\nimprisonment.  The king does not seem to have been troubled by any\nsuspicion that they were all here through his fault; and there was\nnothing in their conduct to remind him of it.  They could not but have\nfelt it; but they probably did not blame, but only mourned over him.\nHis quietness they called heroism, and his indolent content, patience.\nHis worst weaknesses were hidden here, where there was nothing to be\ndone.  The queen would have been better pleased if he had never spoken\nto any of their gaolers; but, upon the whole, they managed to persuade\nthemselves and each other that he was a martyr suffering in piety and\npatience.  We should have thought better of him if he had shown himself\ncapable of self-reproach for having done nothing in defence of his\ncrown, his family, and friends, but much towards the destruction of all.\nIf he had been brave and sincere, however ignorant and mistaken, his\nfamily would now have been in a condition of honour and safety, though\nperhaps exiles from France.\n\nThese dreary days were varied by the arrival of bad news; never of\ngood,--though the taking of Verdun at first looked like good news.  It\ndoes not appear to have occurred to the king that, though his brothers\nand other friends were nearer than they had been, his most deadly\nenemies were nearer still,--close round about him, and sure to be made\nmore cruel by every alarm given them by his allies.  The nearer the army\napproached, the greater was the danger of the prisoners.  A few minutes\nafter the Princess Elizabeth had read the words on the pasteboard, a new\nguard arrived, in a passion of fear and anger.  He bade them all go in;\nhe arrested and carried off Clery's fellow-servant, whom they never saw\nagain, though he got off with a month's imprisonment.  While the valet\nwas packing up his clothes, the guard kept shouting to the king, \"The\ndrum has beat to arms: the alarm-bell is ringing: the alarm-guns have\nbeen fired: the emigrants are at Verdun.  If they come here, we shall\nall perish; but you shall die first.\"  On hearing this, Louis burst into\nan agony of tears, and ran out of the room.  His sister followed, and\ntried to comfort him.  He saw that his father was not frightened.  The\nking was full of hope; but there was more reason for Louis's terror than\nfor his father's expectation of deliverance.  Many warnings of the kind\noccurred, but the king never believed them.  One of his guards said to\nhim, one night, that if the invaders advanced, the whole royal family\nwould certainly perish.  This man declared that many people pitied the\nlittle boy; but that, as the son of a tyrant, he must die with the rest.\n\nThe fears of the disorderly people of Paris, who knew that they were ill\nprepared for an invasion, made them desperate; and they began murdering\nbefore the very gates of the prison, all whom they supposed to be the\nking's friends, and therefore their enemies.  It was not likely that the\nPrincess de Lamballe should escape,--she who had been the superintendent\nof the royal household, and the intimate friend of the queen;--she who,\nafter having been in safety in London, had gone back to France, to share\nthe fortunes of her mistress and friend.  This news of the taking of\nVerdun cost her her life; and a multitude more were massacred during the\nnext three days.\n\nIn the night after the news came, the queen, who could not sleep, heard\nthe drums rolling continually.  The next day, the 3rd of September, as\nshe was sitting down to backgammon with, the king, at three o'clock, a\ngreat clamour was heard in the street.  The officer on guard in the room\nshut the window, and drew the curtains,--knowing well what was the\nmatter.  Clery at this moment entered.  The queen asked him why he was\nnot at dinner.  He replied that he was indisposed,--and well indeed he\nmight feel so.  He had just sat down to dinner with Tison and his wife,\nwhen something was held up at the window which he knew at a glance to be\nthe head of the Princess de Lamballe.  He ran to prevent the queen's\nhearing of it, if possible.\n\nThe king asked some of the officers if his family were in danger; and\nwas told that the people had heard that the royal prisoners had left the\nTemple, and were crying out for the king to appear at a window; but that\nthis was not to be allowed, as the people must learn to have more\nconfidence in their magistrates.  Meantime, curses of the queen were\nheard without; and one of the guard told her that the people wanted to\nshow her her friend's head, that she might see how tyrants were to be\nserved; and that if she did not go to the window, the people would come\nup to her.\n\nThe queen dropped in a fainting-fit; and the brute left the room.  The\nPrincess Elizabeth and Clery lifted the queen into an arm-chair; and\nLouis helped his sister to try to revive their mother.  He put his arms\nabout her neck, and his tears fell upon her face.  When she revived,\nthey were glad to see her shed tears.  They all went into the Princess\nElizabeth's room, where the noise from without was less heard.  There\nthe queen stood, silent and motionless, and apparently unaware of all\nthat was said and done in the room.  Yet this was the time chosen by a\nmessenger from the mayor for settling some accounts with the king.  This\nman, not understanding the queen's misery, thought, when he saw her lost\nand motionless, that she remained standing out of respect to him!\n\nThe noise continued for two hours; and it is believed that the mob would\nhave burst the doors, and murdered the family, if an officer of the\nmagistrates had not fastened a tricolor ribbon across the great gate,--a\nsymbol which the people always respected.  This officer made Clery pay,\nout of the king's money, for this ribbon, which cost somewhat less than\ntwo shillings.\n\nThe queen had not slept the night before; this night, her daughter and\nsister heard her sobs the whole night through, while the continual roll\nof the distant drums prepared them for new horrors.  Nothing more\noccurred to alarm them, however, for some weeks; and it was long before\nthey knew that the massacre which began on that dreadful day was carried\non through the two next.\n\nWhatever hopes the king had from abroad soon grew fainter.  The army\nbegan to retreat before the end of September.  One of the reasons of\nthis was that the king's brothers and friends had misled the sovereigns\nof other countries, by saying that the French nation generally were\nattached to the king, and that the country people would rise in his\nfavour all along the line of march.  They may have believed this\nthemselves: but it was a great mistake; and when the foreign forces\nentered France, they found the country people universally their enemies.\nThey would not furnish food, or any other assistance, and deserted\ntheir homes to join the revolutionary forces.  Thus, the foreign troops\ncould not get on; and before a month was out, they were retreating,\nhaving done the royal cause nothing but harm by taking Verdun.\n\nThe people of Paris, encouraged and delighted, now declared royalty\nabolished in France.  The gaolers at once left off calling the family by\ntheir titles, and objected to Clery's making any requests in the name of\nthe king, whom, to his face, they called Louis or Capet.  A shoemaker,\nnamed Simon, was always in office in the Temple, superintending the\nmanagement of the prison in some of its departments.  This man prided\nhimself upon his rudeness, and would now sometimes say, in the king's\nhearing, \"Clery, ask Capet if he wants anything, that I may not have the\ntrouble of coming up a second time.\"\n\nSome new linen being at last sent (after the princesses had been obliged\nto mend their clothes every day, and to sit up to mend the king's after\nhe was in bed), the sempstresses were found to have marked the linen, as\nusual, with crowned letters; and the princesses were ordered to take out\nthe marks before they were allowed to wear the clothes.  As it was found\nthat some correspondence was carried on between the prisoners and their\nfriends without, and the means could not be detected, all their\nemployments looked suspicious in the eyes of their gaolers.  After pen,\nink, and paper had been forbidden, the queen gave directions to Clery as\nto what should be done with some chair-covers of tapestry-work which she\nand her sister-in-law had worked for their amusement; but the guard\nwould not let them be sent out of the prison, as they were supposed to\ncontain hieroglyphic figures, which would be understood by the lady to\nwhom they were directed.  One day, when Louis was by his mother's side,\nstudying a multiplication-table which Clery had made for him, at her\ndesire, the guard interfered, saying that he was afraid the queen was\nteaching her son a cipher-language, under pretence of giving him lessons\nin arithmetic.  So the poor boy learned no more arithmetic.  While\nreading history with her son, the queen had many lectures to undergo\nabout giving him a republican education,--lectures which were cruel\nbecause they were perfectly useless.  The queen knew nothing about\nrepublicanism, beyond what she had seen of late in Paris; and she had\nseen nothing which could induce her to instruct her child in its favour.\n\nEverything that came in and went out was searched; but yet it does not\nappear that the real means of communication were discovered.  The\nmacaroons were broken, the fish cut open, the walnuts split, in search\nof notes; and none were found.  A book which the Princess Elizabeth\nwished to return to the person who had lent it to her, had all the\nmargins cut off, lest there should be writing on them in invisible ink.\nThe washing-bills, and all paper wrappers, were held to the fire, under\nthe same suspicion: and all the folds of the linen from the wash were\nexamined for hidden notes.\n\nOnce there was a fancy that the king wished to poison himself; and the\nguards made poor Clery swallow some essence of soap, bought for the king\nto shave with.  All these things show the dread entertained by the newly\nfreed people of being crushed by foreign powers, and the opinion that\nprevailed of the selfishness and tyrannical habits of the king and\nqueen.  The jealousy and cruelty from which they were now suffering were\nsigns, perhaps, of the ignorance of the people; but they told quite as\nplainly of a condition of desperate fear.  If they had known the truth,\nthey might have discovered that their persecutors were not less wretched\nthan themselves.  In point of ignorance of one another's views, wishes,\nand intents, and of the means of securing the welfare of a nation, it\nmight be difficult to say which party was the least fit to govern.\n\nNow that royalty was declared to be abolished, the family must have\npondered night and day what was to become of them, if a foreign army did\nnot come to release them; of which there seemed less chance now than on\nthat summer night when the queen had gazed at the moon, and hoped that\nanother month would restore her to freedom and dignity.  She could not\nnow avoid supposing that they might be got rid of by death: yet she\nheard rumours of another fate.  One day she was told that her husband\nand son were to be imprisoned for life in the castle of Chambord.  The\nking was under forty years of age, and it was early for him to have to\nquit the activity and enjoyment of life: but what must she have felt as\nshe looked upon her boy, not yet eight years old, and imagined him mured\nup in a fortress for as long as he might live!  She seems to have felt\nmore keenly than anything else any fear or vexation caused to her boy;\nwhich was natural enough, as he was the youngest of the party.  Almost\nthe only time when she showed any impatience at the behaviour of their\nguards was when one of them waked Louis suddenly one night, to see\nwhether he was safe in bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. THE FAMILY SEPARATED.\n\nTheir sorrows increased as time went on.  The king was separated from\nhis family: but when the queen's grief alarmed the gaolers, the party\nwere allowed to take their meals together, on condition of their\nspeaking so as to be heard, and only in French.  It now became more\nnecessary than ever for Clery to learn what he could of what was passing\nout of doors; and Louis helped in a plan by which Clery was to tell\nwhatever he could learn.  Louis and his sister now played battledore and\nother games after dinner, in an outer room, their aunt sitting by with\nher book or work.  Clery sat down with his book, and the children made\nall the noise they could with their play, that Clery might speak to the\nprincess unheard by the guard.  Neither he nor the princess raised their\nheads from their books, and Clery moved his lips as little as he could;\nso that no one who was not listening could have supposed that he was\nspeaking.\n\nThe Dauphin cheered and amused his parents by his childish fun and\nlittle pranks; but yet, every one observed that he never forgot that he\nwas in a prison.  It was painful to see a boy so young acting with the\ncaution of an old person, from the consciousness of being surrounded by\nenemies.  Some of his caution was owing to fear, and some to the\ngentleness of his temper.  He was never heard to speak of the Tuileries\nor of Versailles, though it was certain that he had a vivid remembrance\nof the kind of life he had led there.  He thought it would grieve his\nparents to be reminded of their palaces, and of the days of their power.\nOne morning, he declared, when asked, that he had seen before an\nofficer who came to guard them for the first time.  The officer asked\nhim repeatedly where he had seen him, but Louis would not say.  At last,\nhe whispered to his mother, \"It was when we were coming back from\nVarennes.\"  When any guard more civil than the rest appeared on duty,\nLouis always ran with the good news to the queen.  One day, a\nstone-mason was employed in making holes in the doorway of the outer\nroom, in which large bolts were to be fixed.  While the man was at\nbreakfast, Louis amused himself with his tools.  This was an opportunity\nfor the king to gratify his well-known taste; and he began to work with\nthe mallet and chisel, to show his boy the way.  The mason came back,\nand, moved by seeing the king so employed, said, \"When you get out, you\nwill be able to say that you worked at your own bars.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king, \"when and how shall I get out?\"  Louis burst out\na-crying; and the king, throwing down the tools, went into his chamber,\nand paced up and down with long strides.\n\nIt appears that the king was touched with somewhat of the same\nsuperstition of which the queen gave occasional tokens,--like many other\nsufferers in a time of suspense.  No one liked to refuse to play with\nLouis when he wanted to play; so, one afternoon, when the king was very\nsad, he consented to a game at nine-pins, because his boy asked him.\nThe Dauphin twice counted sixteen, and then lost the game.  \"Whenever I\nget sixteen,\" exclaimed he, a little vexed, \"I always lose the game.\"\nThe king, remembering that he was the sixteenth Louis, looked very\ngrave; and Clery thought his mind was superstitiously impressed by the\nboy's words.\n\nIn the beginning of November a feverish complaint attacked the king, and\nthen the whole family in turn.  The wife and sister of the king assisted\nClery to nurse him, and often made his bed with their own hands.  Louis,\nwho had slept in the king's room since the partial separation of the\nfamily, was the next attacked.  Not all that the queen could say availed\nto procure permission to remain with her child during the night.  Clery,\nhowever, never left him; and Louis had soon an opportunity of showing\nthat he was grateful.\n\nBefore the princesses had recovered, poor Clery was more ill, with\nrheumatic fever, than any of them had been.  He made a great effort to\nrise and attend the king, the first day; but his master, seeing the\ncondition he was in, sent him to bed again, and himself took up his son,\nand dressed him.  Louis scarcely left Clery's bedside all day, bringing\nhim drink, and doing all the little services he could think of.  The\nking found a moment to tell Clery, unobserved, that he should see the\nphysician the next day; and the princesses went to visit him in the\nevening, when the Princess Elizabeth slipped into his hand some medicine\nwhich had been brought for her, as she was yet far from well.  It\ndistressed Clery to accept this, and to know how the ladies undertook\nhis duties,--the queen putting Louis to bed, and the Princess Elizabeth\ndressing the king's hair.  The Princess Elizabeth asked for medicines,\nas if for herself, that Clery might have them, even after he had left\nhis bed, to which he was confined for six days.  Among other things she\nhad obtained a box of ipecacuanha lozenges for his cough.  Having had no\nopportunity of giving these to Clery during the day, she left them with\nLouis when she bade him good-night, thinking that Clery would be\nup-stairs presently.  This was before nine.  It was just eleven when\nClery came up, to turn down the king's bed.  Louis called to him in a\nlow voice; and Clery was afraid that he was ill, as he was not asleep.\n\"No,\" Louis said, \"I am not ill; but I have a little box to give you.  I\nam glad you are come, at last, for I could hardly keep my eyes open; and\nthey have been shut several times, I believe.\"  Seeing that Clery was\nmoved, Louis kissed him; and then was asleep in a minute.\n\nAt five in the morning of the 11th of December, everybody in the Temple\nwas awakened by the noise of cavalry and cannon entering the garden, and\nthe drums beating throughout the city.  Louis did not know what this\nmeant; but his parents understood that the king was to be brought to\ntrial, and that this noise arose from the military preparations for the\ngreat event.  His father took him by the hand, and led him to breakfast,\nas usual, at nine o'clock.  Nobody said much, because the guards were in\nthe room; but he saw his father and mother look very expressively at\neach other when he and his father were going downstairs again, at ten\no'clock.  He went to his lessons, as usual, and was reading to the king,\nwhen two officers came from the magistrates, to say that they must\nimmediately take Louis to his mother.  Argument was useless; so Clery\nwas desired to go with the boy.  On his return, Clery gave comfort to\nthe king by assuring him that Louis really was with his mother.\n\nThe king was soon after taken to the Convention, before whom he was to\nbe tried.  Never till this day had the queen asked any question of her\nguards: and to-day she obtained no information, though she made every\ninquiry she could devise.  The king returned at six o'clock; but he was\nimmediately locked up, without seeing any one.  No bed had yet been\nprovided for Louis in his mother's room: and this night, she gave up\nhers to him, and sat up.  The princesses were most unwilling to leave\nher in the state of agitation she was in; but she insisted upon their\ngoing to rest.  The next day, she implored that if the king might see\nhis wife and sister, his children should not be separated from him.  The\nreply was what might have been expected;--that the children must not be\nmade messengers between their parents; but that they might be with their\nfather, if they did not see the queen, till the trial was over.\nOccupied as the king was with his defence, this could not be: nor would\nhe deprive their mother of the solace of their society: so Louis's bed\nwas removed to his mother's room, and no one knew when he would see his\nfather again.\n\nLouis saw his father but once more.  It was in the evening of Sunday,\nthe 20th of January.  The crier, who came into the street at seven\no'clock, proclaimed the sentence that Louis Capet was to be executed the\nnext day.\n\nThe family were at last permitted to see the king; and at half-past\neight were told that he was ready.  The queen took Louis by the hand,\nand led him downstairs, the princesses following.  It appears that the\nguards had some idea that the king would attempt suicide; for they would\nnot allow him to have a knife at his dinner; and they now would not lose\nsight of him, even while meeting his family.  They would not have\nallowed the door to be shut, but that it was a glass door, through which\nthey could look, on any alarm.  So far from the king having thought of\nsuicide, it is now believed by most people that he allowed himself to be\npersuaded by his counsel and friends that there was not really much\ndanger of his execution taking place, and that he would be permitted, at\nthe last moment, to appeal to the Primary Assemblies, where an appeal\nwould be successful.  This seems confirmed by his conduct on the\nscaffold.  He was, as he had been through life, deceived and mistaken;\nand the moment of his being undeceived was one of dreadful agony of\nmind.  It deprived him of all dignity and fortitude; and his struggles\nwere such that it required the strength of three executioners to\noverpower him, and fulfil the sentence.  It is to be hoped that his\nfamily never knew this; and the mass of the crowd did not see what\nhappened on the scaffold; but some who did see the whole, have proved\nbeyond a doubt that Louis the Sixteenth showed, at last, no more dignity\nin his death than in his life.\n\nHow much hope he imparted to his family during their evening interview\ncan now never be known; but his legal advisers and his servants gave him\nsuch abundant assurances that the sentence could never be really\nexecuted upon a king, that the hopes of his family were probably\nsustained by their words.  Not a sound, however, was heard by Clery\noutside the door.  The king sat between his wife and sister, and kept\nLouis standing between his knees,--the Princess Royal sitting nearly in\nfront.  There was much weeping; and most that was said was by the king.\nHe desired his boy to harbour no revenge against the authors of his\ndeath, and then gave him his blessing.\n\nWhen the peasant-child sees his father dying on his fever-bed, and knows\nthat the question is in the heart of both parents, what is to become of\nthe widow and her children, he may feel his little heart bursting with\nfear and sorrow, and may think that no one can be more unhappy than he.\nBut Louis was more unhappy.  Here was his father, in the full vigour of\nhis years, about to die a violent death, amidst the hatred of millions\nof men who, if all had done right, should have been attached to him, and\nhave defended his life at the peril of their own.  For the peasant-child\nthere is comfort in prospect.  His father's grave is respected in the\nchurchyard; the neighbours are kind; there is the consolation of work\nfor those who survive, and the free air, and the spring flowers, and the\nmowing, and the harvest, and all the pleasures which cannot be withheld\nfrom those who live at liberty in the country.  For the princely child\nthere were none of these comforts.  As far as he could see, his father\nand mother had no friends; he and his family were in a dismal prison,\nwith insulting enemies about them, and no prospect of any change for the\nbetter, when his father should have been thus violently torn away.\nNever, perhaps, was there a more miserable child than Louis was now.\n\nThe queen much wished to remain with the king all night; but the king\nsaw that it was better that their strength should not be thus worn-out\nin grief, and he said that he needed some hours of rest and stillness.\nHe promised that the family should come to him in the morning: and they\ntherefore left him at a quarter past ten, having spent an hour and\nthree-quarters with him.  He told Clery that he never intended to keep\nthis promise, and should spare them and himself the affliction of such\nan interview.  The queen chose to put Louis to bed, as usual; but had\nhardly strength to do it.  She then threw herself, dressed, upon her own\nbed, where the princesses heard her shivering and sobbing with cold and\ngrief, all night long.  The whole family were dressed by six, in\nexpectation of being sent for by the king; and when the door opened, in\na quarter of an hour, they thought the summons was come; but it was only\nan attendant, looking for a prayer-book, as a priest was going to say\nmass in the king's apartment.  Then they waited hour after hour, and do\nnot seem to have suspected that the king would not keep his promise.  At\na little after ten, the firing of the artillery, and the shouts in the\nstreets of \"Long live the Republic,\" told them but too plainly that all\nwas over.\n\nThe melancholy life they led went on through the rest of the winter and\nspring with little variety.  The parapet of the leads was raised, and\nevery chink stopped up, to prevent the family seeing anything, or being\nseen when they walked; so that his daily exercise could have been but\nlittle of an amusement to the poor boy.  On the 25th of March, he was\nsnatched up from sleep, in the middle of the night, in order that his\nbed might be searched, as it was believed that his mother and aunt\ncarried on a correspondence with people without, by some secret means.\nNothing was found in Louis's bed; and only a tradesman's address, and a\nstick of sealing-wax, in any of the apartments.  The princesses\ncertainly contrived to conceal some pencils; for they had some remaining\nin the following October.  While the king was separated from them, they\ncorresponded with him by putting small notes into the middle of balls of\ncotton, which were found by Clery in the linen-press, occasionally, and\nwhich would hardly have excited any suspicion if they had been seen\nthere by the most watchful of the gaolers.  It is probable that the\nprincesses communicated by the same method with people out of doors,\nwhen their linen went out or was brought in.  It certainly appears that\nthey did carry on a correspondence by some means.  No one would blame\nthem for this: but neither, when the situation and the fears of the new\nrepublicans are considered, assailed and invaded as they were by the\npowerful friends of royalty, can we wonder at the frequency and\nstrictness of their searches, while certain that their orders were\nevaded by the prisoners.\n\nOn the 9th of May, poor Louis was taken ill with fever.  It was a very\nserious illness, and lasted nearly a month; and he never was in good\nhealth again.  The want of proper air, exercise, and play, and the dull\nlife he led among melancholy companions, were quite enough to destroy\nthe health _of any_ boy.  He was tenderly nursed by his mother and aunt,\nand his sister played with him; but there was no peace in their minds,\nand no mirth in their faces, to cheer his young heart.  One anecdote\nshows how sad their manners were now.  Tison's wife, who did some of the\nwork of their chambers, went mad, and talked to herself in a way so\nridiculous, that the Princess Royal could not help laughing.  This made\nthe queen and Princess Elizabeth look at her with pleasure--it was so\nlong since they had seen her laugh!  And yet this poor girl who never\nlaughed was then only fifteen years old, and her brother not yet nine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14. FURTHER SEPARATION.\n\nThe 3rd of July was the most terrible morning to Louis.  Before he was\nup, and while his mother was by his bedside, some officers came into the\nroom, with an order from the Convention that Louis should be taken from\nhis family, and kept in the most secure room in the Temple.  If the\nqueen could have commanded herself so far as to obey at once, and let\nhim go quietly, the unhappy boy might have been less terrified than he\nwas.  But this was hardly to be expected.  These repeated cruelties had\nworn out her spirits; and she now made a frantic resistance.  For a\nwhole hour she kept off the officers from his bed, and her lamentations\nwere dreadful to hear: so that the terrified boy not only wept, but\nuttered cries.  His aunt and sister, though in tears, commanded\nthemselves so far as to dress him, and thus show that they intended no\nvain opposition.  The officers were made angry by the delay in obeying\norders of which they were only the bearers.  They did all they could in\nassuring the queen that no danger to the boy's life was to be feared,\nand in promising to convey to the authorities her request that she might\nsee him at meal-times, at least.  Then they carried him off, crying\nbitterly.  He never again saw his mother, though she saw him by stealth.\n\nIt was not likely that her request about meeting him at meals would be\ngranted; for the very object of separating him was to put out of his\nhead all the ideas of princely power and authority of which the mind of\na royal child was likely to be full.  The intention was to bring him up\nwith republican ideas and feelings, in order at once to make of him what\nwas then called \"a good citizen,\" and to render him less an object of\nhope and expectation to the foreign powers who already gave him the\nroyal titles, and led on their armies, as if to the rescue of a king,\nwhile the French nation declared that royalty was abolished, and that\nthey had no king, and would have none.  So this sickly, sad, helpless\nlittle boy was taken by one of the party from the arms of his mother and\naunt, to be brought up in contempt of his family and rank, while the\nother party were, all over Europe, giving him the title of Louis the\nSeventeenth, and speaking with reverence of him, as if he sat upon a\nthrone.  This unhappy child, called a king, wept without pause for two\nwhole days, begging every one he saw to take him to his mother.  The\nendeavour then was to make him forget her; but though they awed him so\nthat he soon did not dare to speak of her, or to weep, an incident\nshowed that he still pined for her.  A report got abroad that he had\nbeen seen in one of the public walks of Paris; and others said that he\nwas dead.  Some members of the Convention were therefore sent to the\nTemple, to ascertain the truth.  Louis was led down to the garden to be\nseen by them; and he immediately begged to be taken to his mother; but\nwas told that it was impossible.\n\nLong and wearily did she pine for him.  She heard of him frequently,\nfrom one of the gaolers; but there was nothing to be told which could\ncause her anything but grief: for those who had taken from her the\ncharge of her child, did not fulfil the duty they had assumed.  She saw\nthis for herself.  He often went to the leads; and the queen found a\nchink in a wall at some distance, through which she could watch him as\nhe walked.  Sometimes she waited many hours at this chink, in hopes of\nhis coming: and yet it might have been better for her not to have seen\nhim; for he altered sadly.\n\nIt was the duty of the authorities, if they meddled with the boy at all,\nto have educated him well.  Nothing could excuse their not taking him\nfrom prison, tending his weak health, and having him kindly cheered and\nwell taught.  Instead of this, they committed him to the charge of the\nman called Simon (mentioned before), a shoemaker, whose business it was\nto tend and bring up the boy.  Simon was a coarse and ignorant man, full\nof hatred of rank and royalty.  He would not let Louis wear mourning for\nhis father, and took away his black clothes.  He taught him to sing the\nrough songs of the day, mocking royalty and praising revolution.  Louis\nnever till now drank wine, and had always disliked it.  This man made\nhim drink a great deal of wine, and eat to excess, so as to bring on his\nfever again.  This might be meant for kindness; but it shows how unfit a\nguardian Simon was.  Louis recovered less favourably from the second\nfever than the first.  He still walked on the leads; but, instead of\ngrowing taller, he was stunted in his growth, and became fat and\nbloated, and thoroughly unhealthy.\n\nOn the 8th of October, just after he had got up, his room-door opened,\nand his sister ran in.  She threw her arms round his neck; but almost\nbefore he could express his surprise, she was fetched away.  She had\nbeen sent for by some people below, who were waiting to question her;\nand knowing which was Louis's room, she had run downstairs to it; thus\nmaking use of the only opportunity she was likely to have of seeing her\nbrother.\n\nIn a little while, these two royal children were each left entirely\nalone.  The queen had been removed early in August, and was beheaded in\nOctober, the day week after Louis saw his sister.  The good Princess\nElizabeth was always persuaded that her turn would come; and so it did.\nShe suffered on the 10th of the next May, when she was thirty years of\nage.  It will be remembered that the king implored her not to enter a\nconvent in her youth, as she desired; and that he obtained her promise\nto refrain from being a nun till she should be thirty years old.  If he\nhad not interfered at first, and if her noble disinterestedness had not\ncaused her to devote herself to her brother and his family when she saw\nadversity coming upon them, she might have fulfilled a long course of\npiety and charity, and even been living now.  Her life was so innocent,\nso graced by gentleness and love, that it may well be a matter of wonder\non what accusation she could have been tried and put to death.  It was\nthe accusation most common at that day--of having conspired with the\nenemies of the Republic to set up royalty again in France.  That she\ncorresponded with the friends of royalty, is probable: that she wished\nfor the re-establishment of the throne, there can be no doubt: but to\nsuppose that she could in her prison conspire for such a purpose is\nabsurd.  The true reason of her death no doubt was, that the\nparty-leaders of the time wished to be rid of as many royal personages\nas possible, and to strike terror into the hearts of all who were not\npleased with the Republic.  The Princess Royal was not told what had\nbecome of her mother and aunt.  She remained alone, passing her weary\nhours in keeping her chamber and clothes neat, in knitting, and in\nreading a few books, which she had read over and over again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. THE END.\n\nHow came her little brother to be alone too?  Why, Simon accepted an\noffice which he liked better than that of being Louis's guardian, and\nleft him on the 19th of January.  Nobody seems to have remembered to\nappoint another guardian; and Louis was alone, all day and all night,\nfor months after.\n\nWe cannot dwell upon this part of his story.  We know little of it; and\nthat little is terrible.  There was a broken bell in his room; but he\nwas so afraid of the people that he never rang it.  He might, it is\nsaid, have left the room: but he was very weak and ill, and seems to\nhave grown bewildered.  He had not strength to make his own bed; and it\nwas never made for six months: nor was the bedding changed, nor even his\nshirt, nor the windows opened in all that time.  A pitcher of water was\nput into his room sometimes; but he never washed himself.  There he lay,\nfeeble, and frightened at every noise, surrounded with filth, and\ncovered with vermin, scarcely knowing day from night,--with no voice\nnear to rouse him, no candle in the longest winter nights, no books, no\nplay, no desire for any of these things, no cheerful thoughts in his own\nmind, and his weak body feverish and aching.  Was any poor man's child\never so miserable?\n\nLet us pass on to a brighter day, which came at last.\n\nOn the 28th of July following, there was much noise in the streets, and\nbustle in the prison, so early as six in the morning; and some\nfinely-dressed gentlemen entered the poor boy's room.  He did not know\nwho they were; and they said little, and soon went away.  They were,\nhowever, sufficiently impressed with what they saw to take some measures\nfor Louis's relief.  They had been sent by the Convention, on the\ndownfall and death of the great revolutionary leader, Robespierre, to\nsee what was the state of things at the Temple; and in consequence of\ntheir report, a person named Laurent was appointed to visit the royal\nchildren.\n\nAt last, Louis found himself visited, several times in the day, by one\nwhom he need not be afraid of.  Laurent spoke tenderly to him, and told\nhim he should be better taken care of.  The dirty bed was carried away;\nthe window was opened, and the room cleaned; and then a clean\ncomfortable bed was brought in.  The best thing was that Louis was put\ninto a warm-bath; and Laurent cleansed him from head to foot.  Louis was\nsorry to see Laurent leave the room; but he knew he would soon be back\nagain; and never failed to appear three times during the day.  He would\nhave done more for the poor boy: he would have changed his room, and\nfound him amusements, and had him well nursed, but that he feared being\ndismissed if he showed too much indulgence at once; and that then Louis\nwould be allowed to relapse into his former state.  Perhaps it was\nbetter for the boy that the improvement in his condition took place\ngradually; for it might have overpowered him to have had people about\nhim, taking care of him all day, after so many months spent entirely\nalone.\n\nIn November there was another Commission sent to the prison, to give\nfurther account of Louis.  One of the visitors, a kind-hearted\ngentleman, named Gomier, remained to assist Laurent in his charge.\nGomier devoted himself to the boy, and made him as comfortable as he\ncould be made in his diseased state.  Louis need not fear the long dark\nwinter evenings this year; for Gomier had lights brought, as soon as it\ngrew dusk.  Gomier passed many hours of the day in talking with him, and\ngot him to play sometimes.  Gomier rubbed the swollen joints of his\nknees and wrists, and obtained leave to give him such exercise as he\ncould take.  He did not carry him at once into the open air, but removed\nhim into a little parlour, where Louis seemed so happy that it touched\nthe heart of his kind guardian.  Then Gomier and Laurent took him to the\nleads again, and wished him to go there every fine day.  They used all\ngentle means to tempt him up, and to amuse him when there,--but poor\nLouis was now too weak to enjoy air and exercise.  He complained\ndirectly of being tired, and begged to go down: and his pleasure was to\nspend the whole day quietly by the fire-side.  It was better to indulge\nhim in this; for it was clear that he could never again be well, and\nthat all that could be done was to make his decline as easy as possible.\n\nHe had several attacks of fever during the winter; and his knees swelled\nmore and more.  Laurent had to leave him; but happily a man no less kind\nsucceeded him in his charge.  This man's name was Loine.  During the\nspring the boy's strength failed, day by day.  He was attended by good\nsurgeons, who saw that he must die, but did what they could to give him\nease.  His mind had now become dull and confused; but he had no pain.\nExcept when he had occasional fever fits, he seemed in an easy state,\nand died, at length, quite peacefully.  He breathed his last on the 9th\nof June, 1795, at three o'clock in the afternoon, his age being ten\nyears and two months.\n\nHis sister then felt as if she was quite alone: but it was not for long;\nand in the interval she was treated kindly.  On the 19th of December\nfollowing, which happened to be her seventeenth birthday, she was\nreleased from the Temple, and sent to her uncles and aunts, with whom\nshe lived from that time forward.  She married her cousin, the Duke\nd'Angouleme, and is still living, having seen her family once more\nrestored to the throne of France, and again deposed for tyranny.  No\ncruelty was inflicted upon them in the course of this last change.  They\nwere quietly sent into a foreign country, where they are now living,\nsurrounded by all the comforts and luxuries suitable to their rank; and\ntheir gentle punishment is no more than, in the opinion of almost\neverybody but themselves, their ignorant misuse of power deserves.\n\nThe pictures of human life which are here given are almost too sad and\ndreary to be dwelt upon.  But we must dwell upon them long enough to\nlearn from them one important thing.  We are accustomed to say that the\nsufferings of men come from the hand of God, and ought to be submitted\nto with perfect patience on that account.  This is true with respect to\nmany of the woes of mankind; but we are far too hasty in declaring this\noccasionally where it is not true.\n\nHow is it in the cases before us?  God gave to the French nation one of\nthe richest, gayest, and most beautiful countries in the world.  This\ncountry, with its sunny hills, its fertile plains, its great forests,\nand brimming rivers, can easily produce more of all the good things of\nlife than are wanted for the use of all its inhabitants.  No man, woman,\nor child within its boundaries ought ever to be in want of the comforts\nof life.  God has also given to the people of that country affectionate\nhearts, and loyal tempers: as was shown by their long forbearance with\ntheir rulers, under cruel oppression.  If such a people in such a land\nwere miserable, some living in pinching poverty and gross ignorance, and\nothers in tyranny and selfishness which brought upon them a cruel\nretribution, let no one dare to say that such misery was from the will\nof God.  God showed what his will was when he placed beings with loving\nhearts in the midst of the fruitful land.  They might and must have been\nhappy, but for their misuse of his gifts.\n\nThe mischief cannot be undone: the misery cannot now be helped: but men\nmay learn from it not to allow such a case to happen again.  It is not\nonly France that has been ignorant, and guilty, and miserable.  Every\ncountry is full of blessings given by the hand of God; and in every\ncountry are those blessings misused, more or less, as they were in\nFrance.  If every child, as he grows up, was taught this truth--taught\nto reflect how all men may have their share of these blessings who are\nwilling to work for them, there would be no more danger of such woe as\nwe have been contemplating.  It would then appear as impious as it\nreally is to call God the author of sufferings which need never happen.\nInstead of crying to Him for mercy under intolerable misery, all might\nthen bless Him for having placed His children on a fair and fruitful\nearth, where all may have their fill and dwell in peace.\n",
