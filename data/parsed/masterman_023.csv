2,"Mr Seagrave was the first up on the ensuing morning; and when Ready came out of the tent, he said to him, ""Do you know, Ready, I feel much happier and my mind much more at ease since I find myself here.  On the other side of the island everything reminded me that we had been shipwrecked; and I could not help thinking of home and my own country; but here we appear as if we had been long settled, and as if we had come here by choice.""",first up ensuing morning ready come tent say know ready feel happy mind more ease find other side island remind shipwreck help think home own country appear settle come choice

5,"""I think, sir, the first object is to have a good supply of fresh water; and I therefore wish you and William--Here he is.  Good-morning, William--I was saying that I thought it better that Mr Seagrave and you should clear out the spring while I am away in the boat.  I brought another shovel with me yesterday, and you both can work; perhaps we had better go there, as Juno, I see, is getting the breakfast ready.  You observe, Mr Seagrave, we must follow up the spring till we get among the cocoa-nut trees, where it will be shaded from the sun; that is easily done by digging towards them, and watching how the water flows. Then, if you will dig out a hole large enough to sink down in the earth one of the water-casks which lie on the beach, I will bring it down with me this afternoon; and then, when it is fixed in the earth in that way, we shall always have the cask full of water for use, and the spring filling it as fast as we empty it.""",think sir first object have good supply fresh water wish good morning say think good clear spring boat bring shovel yesterday work have good go see get breakfast ready observe follow spring get cocoa nut tree shade sun do digg watch water flow dig hole large sink earth water cask lie beach bring afternoon fix earth way have cask full water use spring fill empty
