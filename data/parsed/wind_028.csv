1,CHAPTER XXVIII. LITTLE DAYLIGHT,little daylight 
2," NO HOUSE of any pretension to be called a palace is in the least worthy of the name, except it has a wood near it--very near it--and the nearer the better. Not all round it--I don’t mean that, for a palace ought to be open to the sun and wind, and stand high and brave, with weathercocks glittering and flags flying; but on one side of every palace there must be a wood. And there was a very grand wood indeed beside the palace of the king who was going to be Daylight’s father; such a grand wood, that nobody yet had ever got to the other end of it. Near the house it was kept very trim and nice, and it was free of brushwood for a long way in; but by degrees it got wild, and it grew wilder, and wilder, and wilder, until some said wild beasts at last did what they liked in it. The king and his courtiers often hunted, however, and this kept the wild beasts far away from the palace.",pretension call palace least worthy name have wood nearer good mean palace open sun wind stand high brave weathercock glitter flag fly side palace wood be grand wood palace king go father grand wood get other end house keep trim nice free brushwood long way degree get wild grow wild wild wild say wild beast last do like king courtier hunt keep wild beast palace 
3,"One glorious summer morning, when the wind and sun were out together, when the vanes were flashing and the flags frolicking against the blue sky, little Daylight made her appearance from somewhere--nobody could tell where--a beautiful baby, with such bright eyes that she might have come from the sun, only by and by she showed such lively ways that she might equally well have come out of the wind. There was great jubilation in the palace, for this was the first baby the queen had had, and there is as much happiness over a new baby in a palace as in a cottage.",glorious summer morning wind sun vane flash flag frolick blue sky little make appearance tell beautiful baby such bright eye come sun show such lively way come wind be great jubilation palace first baby queen have be much happiness new baby palace cottage 
4,"But there is one disadvantage of living near a wood: you do not know quite who your neighbours may be. Everybody knew there were in it several fairies, living within a few miles of the palace, who always had had something to do with each new baby that came; for fairies live so much longer than we, that they can have business with a good many generations of human mortals. The curious houses they lived in were well known also,--one, a hollow oak; another, a birch-tree, though nobody could ever find how that fairy made a house of it; another, a hut of growing trees intertwined, and patched up with turf and moss. But there was another fairy who had lately come to the place, and nobody even knew she was a fairy except the other fairies. A wicked old thing she was, always concealing her power, and being as disagreeable as she could, in order to tempt people to give her offence, that she might have the pleasure of taking vengeance upon them. The people about thought she was a witch, and those who knew her by sight were careful to avoid offending her. She lived in a mud house, in a swampy part of the forest.",be disadvantage live wood know neighbour know be several fairy live few mile palace have do new baby come fairy live have business good many generation human mortal curious house live know hollow oak birch tree find fairy make house hut grow tree intertwine patch turf moss be fairy come place know fairy other fairy wicked old thing conceal power disagreeable order temp person give offence have pleasure take vengeance person think witch know sight careful avoid offend live mud house swampy part forest 
5,"In all history we find that fairies give their remarkable gifts to prince or princess, or any child of sufficient importance in their eyes, always at the christening. Now this we can understand, because it is an ancient custom amongst human beings as well; and it is not hard to explain why wicked fairies should choose the same time to do unkind things; but it is difficult to understand how they should be able to do them, for you would fancy all wicked creatures would be powerless on such an occasion. But I never knew of any interference on the part of the wicked fairy that did not turn out a good thing in the end. What a good thing, for instance, it was that one princess should sleep for a hundred years! Was she not saved from all the plague of young men who were not worthy of her? And did she not come awake exactly at the right moment when the right prince kissed her? For my part, I cannot help wishing a good many girls would sleep till just the same fate overtook them. It would be happier for them, and more agreeable to their friends.",history find fairy give remarkable gift prince princess child sufficient importance eye christening understand ancient custom human being hard explain wicked fairy choose same time do unkind thing difficult understand able do fancy wicked creature powerless occasion know interference part wicked fairy turn good thing end good thing instance princess sleep year save plague young man worthy come right moment right prince kiss part help wish good many girl sleep same fate overtake happy agreeable friend 
6,Of course all the known fairies were invited to the christening. But the king and queen never thought of inviting an old witch.,course know fairy invite christening king queen think invite old witch 
7,"For the power of the fairies they have by nature; whereas a witch gets her power by wickedness. The other fairies, however, knowing the danger thus run, provided as well as they could against accidents from her quarter. But they could neither render her powerless, nor could they arrange their gifts in reference to hers beforehand, for they could not tell what those might be.",power fairy have nature witch get power wickedness other fairy know danger run provide accident quarter render powerless arrange gift reference tell 
8,"Of course the old hag was there without being asked. Not to be asked was just what she wanted, that she might have a sort of reason for doing what she wished to do. For somehow even the wickedest of creatures likes a pretext for doing the wrong thing.",course old hag ask ask want have sort reason do wish do wickedest creature like pretext do wrong thing 
9,"Five fairies had one after the other given the child such gifts as each counted best, and the fifth had just stepped back to her place in the surrounding splendour of ladies and gentlemen, when, mumbling a laugh between her toothless gums, the wicked fairy hobbled out into the middle of the circle, and at the moment when the archbishop was handing the baby to the lady at the head of the nursery department of state affairs, addressed him thus, giving a bite or two to every word before she could part with it:",fairy have other give child such gift count good fifth step place surround splendour lady gentleman mumble laugh toothless gum wicked fairy hobble middle circle moment archbishop hand baby lady head nursery department state affair address give bite word part

For I bestow upon her the gift of sleeping all day long, whether she will or not. Ha, ha! He, he! Hi, hi!”",little daylight cry fairy tone dry axle little good gift do bestow gift sleep day

24,"The assembly broke up, miserable enough--the queen, at least, prepared for a good many sleepless nights, and the lady at the head of the nursery department anything but comfortable in the prospect before her, for of course the queen could not do it all. As for the king, he made up his mind, with what courage he could summon, to meet the demands of the case, but wondered whether he could with any propriety require the First Lord of the Treasury to take a share in the burden laid upon him.",assembly break miserable queen least prepare good many sleepless night lady head nursery department comfortable prospect course queen do king make mind courage summon meet demand case wonder propriety require first take share burden lay 
25,"I will not attempt to describe what they had to go through for some time. But at last the household settled into a regular system--a very irregular one in some respects. For at certain seasons the palace rang all night with bursts of laughter from little Daylight, whose heart the old fairy’s curse could not reach; she was Daylight still, only a little in the wrong place, for she always dropped asleep at the first hint of dawn in the east. But her merriment was of short duration. When the moon was at the full, she was in glorious spirits, and as beautiful as it was possible for a child of her age to be. But as the moon waned, she faded, until at last she was wan and withered like the poorest, sickliest child you might come upon in the streets of a great city in the arms of a homeless mother. Then the night was quiet as the day, for the little creature lay in her gorgeous cradle night and day with hardly a motion, and indeed at last without even a moan, like one dead. At first they often thought she was dead, but at last they got used to it, and only consulted the almanac to find the moment when she would begin to revive, which, of course, was with the first appearance of the silver thread of the crescent moon. Then she would move her lips, and they would give her a little nourishment; and she would grow better and better and better, until for a few days she was splendidly well. When well, she was always merriest out in the moonlight; but even when near her worst, she seemed better when, in warm summer nights, they carried her cradle out into the light of the waning moon. Then in her sleep she would smile the faintest, most pitiful smile.",attempt describe have go time last household settle regular system irregular one respect certain season palace ring night burst laughter little heart old fairy curse reach little wrong place drop first hint dawn east merriment short duration moon full glorious spirit beautiful possible child age moon wane fade last want wither poor sickliest child come street great city arm homeless mother night quiet day little creature lay gorgeous cradle night day motion last moan dead first think dead last use consult almanac find moment begin revive course first appearance silver thread crescent moon move lip give little nourishment grow good good good few day well merriest moonlight bad seem good warm summer night carry cradle light wane moon sleep smile faintest pitiful smile 
26,"For a long time very few people ever saw her awake. As she grew older she became such a favourite, however, that about the palace there were always some who would contrive to keep awake at night, in order to be near her. But she soon began to take every chance of getting away from her nurses and enjoying her moonlight alone. And thus things went on until she was nearly seventeen years of age. Her father and mother had by that time got so used to the odd state of things that they had ceased to wonder at them. All their arrangements had reference to the state of the Princess Daylight, and it is amazing how things contrive to accommodate themselves. But how any prince was ever to find and deliver her, appeared inconceivable.",long time few person see grow old become favourite palace contrive keep night order begin take chance get nurse enjoy moonlight thing go year age father mother have time get use odd state thing cease wonder arrangement have reference state amazing thing contrive accommodate prince find deliver appear inconceivable 
27,"As she grew older she had grown more and more beautiful, with the sunniest hair and the loveliest eyes of heavenly blue, brilliant and profound as the sky of a June day. But so much more painful and sad was the change as her bad time came on. The more beautiful she was in the full moon, the more withered and worn did she become as the moon waned. At the time at which my story has now arrived, she looked, when the moon was small or gone, like an old woman exhausted with suffering. This was the more painful that her appearance was unnatural; for her hair and eyes did not change. Her wan face was both drawn and wrinkled, and had an eager hungry look. Her skinny hands moved as if wishing, but unable, to lay hold of something. Her shoulders were bent forward, her chest went in, and she stooped as if she were eighty years old. At last she had to be put to bed, and there await the flow of the tide of life. But she grew to dislike being seen, still more being touched by any hands, during this season. One lovely summer evening, when the moon lay all but gone upon the verge of the horizon, she vanished from her attendants, and it was only after searching for her a long time in great terror, that they found her fast asleep in the forest, at the foot of a silver birch, and carried her home.",grow old grow beautiful sunniest hair loveliest eye heavenly blue brilliant profound sky day painful sad change bad time come beautiful full moon wither wear become moon wane time story arrive look moon small gone old woman exhaust suffering painful appearance unnatural hair eye change want face draw wrinkle have eager hungry look skinny hand move wish unable lay hold shoulder bend chest go stoop year old last have put bed await flow tide life grow dislike see touch hand season lovely summer evening moon lay gone verge horizon vanish attendant search long time great terror find asleep forest foot silver birch carry home 
28,"A little way from the palace there was a great open glade, covered with the greenest and softest grass. This was her favourite haunt; for here the full moon shone free and glorious, while through a vista in the trees she could generally see more or less of the dying moon as it crossed the opening. Here she had a little rustic house built for her, and here she mostly resided. None of the court might go there without leave, and her own attendants had learned by this time not to be officious in waiting upon her, so that she was very much at liberty. Whether the good fairies had anything to do with it or not I cannot tell, but at last she got into the way of retreating further into the wood every night as the moon waned, so that sometimes they had great trouble in finding her; but as she was always very angry if she discovered they were watching her, they scarcely dared to do so. At length one night they thought they had lost her altogether. It was morning before they found her. Feeble as she was, she had wandered into a thicket a long way from the glade, and there she lay--fast asleep, of course.",little way palace be great open glade cover greenest softest grass favourite haunt full moon shine free glorious vista tree see more less die moon cross opening have little rustic house build reside court go leave own attendant learn time officious wait liberty good fairy have do tell last get way retreat wood night moon wane have great trouble find angry discover watch dare do length night think lose morning find feeble wander thicket long way glade lay asleep course 
29,"Although the fame of her beauty and sweetness had gone abroad, yet as everybody knew she was under a bad spell, no king in the neighbourhood had any desire to have her for a daughter-in-law. There were serious objections to such a relation.",fame beauty sweetness go know bad spell king neighbourhood have desire have daughter law be serious objection relation 
30,"About this time in a neighbouring kingdom, in consequence of the wickedness of the nobles, an insurrection took place upon the death of the old king, the greater part of the nobility was massacred, and the young prince was compelled to flee for his life, disguised like a peasant. For some time, until he got out of the country, he suffered much from hunger and fatigue; but when he got into that ruled by the princess’s father, and had no longer any fear of being recognised, he fared better, for the people were kind. He did not abandon his disguise, however. One tolerable reason was that he had no other clothes to put on, and another that he had very little money, and did not know where to get any more. There was no good in telling everybody he met that he was a prince, for he felt that a prince ought to be able to get on like other people, else his rank only made a fool of him. He had read of princes setting out upon adventure; and here he was out in similar case, only without having had a choice in the matter. He would go on, and see what would come of it.",time neighbour kingdom consequence wickedness noble insurrection take place death old king great part nobility massacre young prince compel flee life disguise peasant time get country suffer much hunger fatigue get rule princess father have fear recognise fare good person kind abandon disguise tolerable reason have other clothes put have little money know get more be good tell meet prince feel prince able get other person rank make fool read prince set adventure similar case have choice matter go see come 
31,"For a day or two he had been walking through the palace-wood, and had had next to nothing to eat, when he came upon the strangest little house, inhabited by a very nice, tidy, motherly old woman. This was one of the good fairies. The moment she saw him she knew quite well who he was and what was going to come of it; but she was not at liberty to interfere with the orderly march of events. She received him with the kindness she would have shown to any other traveller, and gave him bread and milk, which he thought the most delicious food he had ever tasted, wondering that they did not have it for dinner at the palace sometimes. The old woman pressed him to stay all night. When he awoke he was amazed to find how well and strong he felt. She would not take any of the money he offered, but begged him, if he found occasion of continuing in the neighbourhood, to return and occupy the same quarters.",day walk palace wood have next eat come strangest little house inhabit nice tidy motherly old woman good fairy moment see know go come liberty interfere orderly march event receive kindness show other traveller give bread milk think delicious food taste wonder have dinner palace old woman press stay night awoke amaze find strong feel take money offer begg find occasion continue neighbourhood return occupy same quarter

Then she said “At last!” and went in.",prince use speak fashion feel little angry turn walk offend fairy stand door little house look tree hide say last go 
43,"The prince wandered and wandered, and got nowhere. The sun sank and sank and went out of sight, and he seemed no nearer the end of the wood than ever. He sat down on a fallen tree, ate a bit of bread the old woman had given him, and waited for the moon; for, although he was not much of an astronomer, he knew the moon would rise some time, because she had risen the night before. Up she came, slow and slow, but of a good size, pretty nearly round indeed; whereupon, greatly refreshed with his piece of bread, he got up and went--he knew not whither.",prince wander wander get sun sink sink go sight seem end wood sit fall tree eat bit bread old woman give wait moon much astronomer know moon rise time rise night come slow slow good size refresh piece bread get go know 
44,"After walking a considerable distance, he thought he was coming to the outside of the forest; but when he reached what he thought the last of it, he found himself only upon the edge of a great open space in it, covered with grass. The moon shone very bright, and he thought he had never seen a more lovely spot. Still it looked dreary because of its loneliness, for he could not see the house at the other side. He sat down, weary again, and gazed into the glade. He had not seen so much room for several days.",walk considerable distance think come outside forest reach think last find edge great open space cover grass moon shine bright think see lovely spot look dreary loneliness see house other side sit weary gaze glade see much room several day 
45,"All at once he spied something in the middle of the grass. What could it be? It moved; it came nearer. Was it a human creature, gliding across--a girl dressed in white, gleaming in the moonshine? She came nearer and nearer. He crept behind a tree and watched, wondering. It must be some strange being of the wood--a nymph whom the moonlight and the warm dusky air had enticed from her tree. But when she came close to where he stood, he no longer doubted she was human--for he had caught sight of her sunny hair, and her clear blue eyes, and the loveliest face and form that he had ever seen. All at once she began singing like a nightingale, and dancing to her own music, with her eyes ever turned towards the moon. She passed close to where he stood, dancing on by the edge of the trees and away in a great circle towards the other side, until he could see but a spot of white in the yellowish green of the moonlit grass. But when he feared it would vanish quite, the spot grew, and became a figure once more. She approached him again, singing and dancing, and waving her arms over her head, until she had completed the circle. Just opposite his tree she stood, ceased her song, dropped her arms, and broke out into a long clear laugh, musical as a brook. Then, as if tired, she threw herself on the grass, and lay gazing at the moon. The prince was almost afraid to breathe lest he should startle her, and she should vanish from his sight. As to venturing near her, that never came into his head.",spy middle grass move come human creature glide girl dress white gleam moonshine come creep tree watch wonder strange being wood nymph moonlight warm dusky air entice tree come stand doubt human catch sight sunny hair clear blue eye loveliest face form see begin sing nightingale dance own music eye turn moon pass stand dance edge tree great circle other side see spot white yellowish green moonlit grass fear vanish spot grow become figure more approach sing dance wave arm head complete circle tree stand cease song drop arm break long clear laugh musical brook tired throw grass lay gaze moon prince afraid breathe startle vanish sight venture come head 
46,"She had lain for a long hour or longer, when the prince began again to doubt concerning her. Perhaps she was but a vision of his own fancy. Or was she a spirit of the wood, after all? If so, he too would haunt the wood, glad to have lost kingdom and everything for the hope of being near her. He would build him a hut in the forest, and there he would live for the pure chance of seeing her again. Upon nights like this at least she would come out and bask in the moonlight, and make his soul blessed. But while he thus dreamed she sprang to her feet, turned her face full to the moon, and began singing as she would draw her down from the sky by the power of her entrancing voice. She looked more beautiful than ever. Again she began dancing to her own music, and danced away into the distance. Once more she returned in a similar manner; but although he was watching as eagerly as before, what with fatigue and what with gazing, he fell fast asleep before she came near him. When he awoke it was broad daylight, and the princess was nowhere.",lain long hour prince begin doubt concern vision own fancy spirit wood haunt wood glad lose kingdom hope build hut forest live pure chance see night least come bask moonlight make soul bless dream spring foot turn face full moon begin sing draw sky power entrancing voice look beautiful begin dance own music dance distance more return similar manner watch fatigue gaze fall asleep come awoke broad daylight princess 
47,"He could not leave the place. What if she should come the next night! He would gladly endure a day’s hunger to see her yet again: he would buckle his belt quite tight. He walked round the glade to see if he could discover any prints of her feet. But the grass was so short, and her steps had been so light, that she had not left a single trace behind her. He walked half-way round the wood without seeing anything to account for her presence. Then he spied a lovely little house, with thatched roof and low eaves, surrounded by an exquisite garden, with doves and peacocks walking in it. Of course this must be where the gracious lady who loved the moonlight lived. Forgetting his appearance, he walked towards the door, determined to make inquiries, but as he passed a little pond full of gold and silver fishes, he caught sight of himself and turned to find the door to the kitchen. There he knocked, and asked for a piece of bread. The good-natured cook brought him in, and gave him an excellent breakfast, which the prince found nothing the worse for being served in the kitchen. While he ate, he talked with his entertainer, and learned that this was the favourite retreat of the Princess Daylight. But he learned nothing more, both because he was afraid of seeming inquisitive, and because the cook did not choose to be heard talking about her mistress to a peasant lad who had begged for his breakfast.",leave place come next night endure day hunger see buckle belt tight walk glade see discover print foot grass short step light leave single trace walk half way wood see account presence spy lovely little house thatch roof low eave surround exquisite garden dove peacock walk course gracious lady love moonlight live forgett appearance walk door determined make inquiry pass little pond full gold silver fish catch sight turn find door kitchen knock ask piece bread good natured cook bring give excellent breakfast prince find bad serve kitchen eat talk entertainer learn favourite retreat learn more afraid seem inquisitive cook choose hear talk mistress peasant lad begg breakfast 
48,"As he rose to take his leave, it occurred to him that he might not be so far from the old woman’s cottage as he had thought, and he asked the cook whether she knew anything of such a place, describing it as well as he could. She said she knew it well enough, adding with a smile--",rise take leave occur old woman cottage think ask cook know place describe say know add smile

60,"Being now refreshed, however, the prince did not go back to the cottage that day: he remained in the forest, amusing himself as best he could, but waiting anxiously for the night, in the hope that the princess would again appear. Nor was he disappointed, for, directly the moon rose, he spied a glimmering shape far across the glade. As it drew nearer, he saw it was she indeed--not dressed in white as before: in a pale blue like the sky, she looked lovelier still. He thought it was that the blue suited her yet better than the white; he did not know that she was really more beautiful because the moon was nearer the full. In fact the next night was full moon, and the princess would then be at the zenith of her loveliness.",refresh prince go cottage day remain forest amusing good wait night hope princess appear disappointed moon rise spy glimmer shape glade draw see dress white pale blue sky look lovely think blue suit good white know beautiful moon full fact next night full moon princess zenith loveliness 
61,"The prince feared for some time that she was not coming near his hiding-place that night; but the circles in her dance ever widened as the moon rose, until at last they embraced the whole glade, and she came still closer to the trees where he was hiding than she had come the night before. He was entranced with her loveliness, for it was indeed a marvellous thing. All night long he watched her, but dared not go near her. He would have been ashamed of watching her too, had he not become almost incapable of thinking of anything but how beautiful she was. He watched the whole night long, and saw that as the moon went down she retreated in smaller and smaller circles, until at last he could see her no more.",prince fear time come hiding place night circle dance widen moon rise last embrace whole glade come close tree hide come night entrance loveliness marvellous thing night watch go ashamed watch become incapable think beautiful watch whole night see moon go retreat small small circle last see more 
62,"Weary as he was, he set out for the old woman’s cottage, where he arrived just in time for her breakfast, which she shared with him. He then went to bed, and slept for many hours. When he awoke the sun was down, and he departed in great anxiety lest he should lose a glimpse of the lovely vision. But, whether it was by the machinations of the swamp-fairy, or merely that it is one thing to go and another to return by the same road, he lost his way. I shall not attempt to describe his misery when the moon rose, and he saw nothing but trees, trees, trees.",weary set old woman cottage arrive time breakfast share go bed sleep many hour awoke sun depart great anxiety lose glimpse lovely vision machination swamp fairy thing go return same road lose way attempt describe misery moon rise see tree tree tree 
63,"She was high in the heavens before he reached the glade. Then indeed his troubles vanished, for there was the princess coming dancing towards him, in a dress that shone like gold, and with shoes that glimmered through the grass like fireflies. She was of course still more beautiful than before. Like an embodied sunbeam she passed him, and danced away into the distance.",high heaven reach glade trouble vanish be princess come dance dress shine gold shoe glimmer grass firefly course beautiful embody sunbeam pass dance distance 
64,"Before she returned in her circle, the clouds had begun to gather about the moon. The wind rose, the trees moaned, and their lighter branches leaned all one way before it. The prince feared that the princess would go in, and he should see her no more that night. But she came dancing on more jubilant than ever, her golden dress and her sunny hair streaming out upon the blast, waving her arms towards the moon, and in the exuberance of her delight ordering the clouds away from off her face. The prince could hardly believe she was not a creature of the elements, after all.",return circle cloud begin gather moon wind rise tree moan light branch learn way prince fear princess go see more night come dance jubilant golden dress sunny hair stream blast wave arm moon exuberance delight order cloud face prince believe creature element 
65,"By the time she had completed another circle, the clouds had gathered deep, and there were growlings of distant thunder. Just as she passed the tree where he stood, a flash of lightning blinded him for a moment, and when he saw again, to his horror, the princess lay on the ground. He darted to her, thinking she had been struck; but when she heard him coming, she was on her feet in a moment.",time complete circle cloud gather be growling distant thunder pass tree stand flash lightning blind moment see horror princess lay ground dart think strike hear come foot moment

The prince ventured to follow her at a little distance, but she turned and made a repellent gesture, which, like a true gentleman-prince, he obeyed at once. He waited a long time, but as she did not come near him again, and as the night had now cleared, he set off at last for the old woman’s cottage.",hide face hand turn walk slow stateliest manner house prince venture follow little distance turn make repellent gesture true gentleman prince obey wait long time come night clear set last old woman cottage

But it is all of no consequence, for what they do never succeeds; nay, in the end it brings about the very thing they are trying to prevent. So you see that somehow, for all their cleverness, wicked fairies are dreadfully stupid, for, although from the beginning of the world they have really helped instead of thwarting the good fairies, not one of them is a bit wiser for it. She will try the bad thing just as they all did before her; and succeeds no better of course.",wicked fairy bind law good fairy obey seem give bad advantage good use means gain end other consequence succeed end bring very thing try prevent see cleverness wicked fairy stupid beginning world help thwart good fairy bit wise try bad thing do succeed good course 
129,"The prince had so far stolen a march upon the swamp-fairy that she did not know he was in the neighbourhood until after he had seen the princess those three times. When she knew it, she consoled herself by thinking that the princess must be far too proud and too modest for any young man to venture even to speak to her before he had seen her six times at least. But there was even less danger than the wicked fairy thought; for, however much the princess might desire to be set free, she was dreadfully afraid of the wrong prince. Now, however, the fairy was going to do all she could.",prince steal march swamp fairy know neighbourhood see princess time know console think princess proud modest young man venture speak see time least be less danger wicked fairy thought princess desire set free afraid wrong prince fairy go do 
130,"She so contrived it by her deceitful spells, that the next night the prince could not by any endeavour find his way to the glade. It would take me too long to tell her tricks. They would be amusing to us, who know that they could not do any harm, but they were something other than amusing to the poor prince. He wandered about the forest till daylight, and then fell fast asleep. The same thing occurred for seven following days, during which neither could he find the good fairy’s cottage. After the third quarter of the moon, however, the bad fairy thought she might be at ease about the affair for a fortnight at least, for there was no chance of the prince wishing to kiss the princess during that period. So the first day of the fourth quarter he did find the cottage, and the next day he found the glade. For nearly another week he haunted it. But the princess never came. I have little doubt she was on the farther edge of it some part of every night, but at this period she always wore black, and, there being little or no light, the prince never saw her. Nor would he have known her if he had seen her. How could he have taken the worn decrepit creature she was now, for the glorious Princess Daylight?",contrive deceitful spell next night prince endeavour find way glade take tell trick amusing know do harm other amusing poor prince wander forest daylight fall asleep same thing occur follow day find good fairy cottage third quarter moon bad fairy think ease affair fortnight least be chance prince wish kiss princess period first day fourth quarter find cottage next day find glade week haunt princess come have little doubt far edge part night period wear black little light prince see know see take wear decrepit creature glorious 
131,"At last, one night when there was no moon at all, he ventured near the house. There he heard voices talking, although it was past midnight; for her women were in considerable uneasiness, because the one whose turn it was to watch her had fallen asleep, and had not seen which way she went, and this was a night when she would probably wander very far, describing a circle which did not touch the open glade at all, but stretched away from the back of the house, deep into that side of the forest--a part of which the prince knew nothing. When he understood from what they said that she had disappeared, and that she must have gone somewhere in the said direction, he plunged at once into the wood to see if he could find her. For hours he roamed with nothing to guide him but the vague notion of a circle which on one side bordered on the house, for so much had he picked up from the talk he had overheard.",last night be moon venture house hear voice talk midnight woman considerable uneasiness one turn watch fall asleep see way go night wander describe circle touch open glade stretch back house deep side forest part prince know understand say disappear go say direction plunge wood see find hour roam guide vague notion circle side border house much pick talk overhear 
132,"It was getting towards the dawn, but as yet there was no streak of light in the sky, when he came to a great birch-tree, and sat down weary at the foot of it. While he sat--very miserable, you may be sure--full of fear for the princess, and wondering how her attendants could take it so quietly, he bethought himself that it would not be a bad plan to light a fire, which, if she were anywhere near, would attract her. This he managed with a tinder-box, which the good fairy had given him. It was just beginning to blaze up, when he heard a moan, which seemed to come from the other side of the tree. He sprung to his feet, but his heart throbbed so that he had to lean for a moment against the tree before he could move. When he got round, there lay a human form in a little dark heap on the earth. There was light enough from his fire to show that it was not the princess. He lifted it in his arms, hardly heavier than a child, and carried it to the flame. The countenance was that of an old woman, but it had a fearfully strange look. A black hood concealed her hair, and her eyes were closed. He laid her down as comfortably as he could, chafed her hands, put a little cordial from a bottle, also the gift of the fairy, into her mouth; took off his coat and wrapped it about her, and in short did the best he could. In a little while she opened her eyes and looked at him--so pitifully! The tears rose and flowed from her grey wrinkled cheeks, but she said never a word. She closed her eyes again, but the tears kept on flowing, and her whole appearance was so utterly pitiful that the prince was near crying too. He begged her to tell him what was the matter, promising to do all he could to help her; but still she did not speak. He thought she was dying, and took her in his arms again to carry her to the princess’s house, where he thought the good-natured cook might be able to do something for her. When he lifted her, the tears flowed yet faster, and she gave such a sad moan that it went to his very heart.",get dawn be streak light sky come great birch tree sit weary foot sit miserable sure full fear princess wonder attendant take bethough bad plan light fire attract manage tinder box good fairy give begin blaze hear moan seem come other side tree spring foot heart throbb have lean moment tree move get lay human form little dark heap earth be light fire show princess lift arm heavy child carry flame countenance old woman have strange look black hood conceal hair eye close lay chafe hand put little cordial bottle gift fairy mouth take coat wrap short do good little while open eye look tear rise flow grey wrinkled cheek say word close eye tear keep flow whole appearance pitiful prince cry begg tell matter promise do help speak think die take arm carry princess house think good natured cook able do lift tear flow fast give sad moan go very heart

135,"Just as he approached the door, feeling more tired than he could have imagined possible--she was such a little thin old thing--she began to move, and became so restless that, unable to carry her a moment longer, he thought to lay her on the grass. But she stood upright on her feet. Her hood had dropped, and her hair fell about her. The first gleam of the morning was caught on her face: that face was bright as the never-aging Dawn, and her eyes were lovely as the sky of darkest blue. The prince recoiled in overmastering wonder. It was Daylight herself whom he had brought from the forest! He fell at her feet, nor dared to look up until she laid her hand upon his head. He rose then.",approach door feel tired imagine possible little thin old thing begin move become restless unable carry moment think lay grass stand foot hood drop hair fall first gleam morning catch face face bright aging eye lovely sky dark blue prince recoil overmaster wonder bring forest fall foot dare look lay hand head rise
