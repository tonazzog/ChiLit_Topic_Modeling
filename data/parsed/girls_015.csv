1,CHAPTER 15. ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT NO EVIL.,people thought evil 
2,"A few days after this Hester was much delighted to receive an invitation from her little friends, the Misses Bruce.  These good ladies had not forgotten the lonely and miserable child whom they had comforted not a little during her journey to school six weeks ago.  They invited Hester to spend the next half-holiday with them, and as this happened to fall on a Saturday, Mrs Willis gave Hester permission to remain with her friends until eight o'clock, when she would send the carriage to fetch her home.",few day delighted receive invitation little friend good lady forget lonely miserable child comfort little journey school week invite spend next half holiday happen fall give permission remain friend o'clock send carriage fetch home 
3,"The trouble about Annie had taken place the Wednesday before, and all the girls' heads were full of the uncleared-up mystery when Hester started on her little expedition.",trouble take place girl head full uncleared mystery start little expedition 
4,"Nothing was known; no fresh light had been thrown on the subject. Everything went on as usual within the school, and a casual observer would never have noticed the cloud which rested over that usually happy dwelling.  A casual observer would have noticed little or no change in Annie Forest; her merry laugh was still heard, her light step still danced across the play-room floor, she was in her place in class, and was, if anything, a little more attentive and a little more successful over her lessons.  Her pretty, piquant face, her arch expression, the bright, quick and droll glance which she alone could give, were still to be seen; but those who knew her well and those who loved her best saw a change in Annie.",know fresh light throw subject go usual school casual observer notice cloud rest happy dwelling casual observer notice little change merry laugh hear light step dance play room floor place class little attentive little successful lesson pretty piquant face arch expression bright quick droll glance give see know love good see change 
5,"In the play-room she devoted herself exclusively to the little ones; she never went near Cecil Temple's drawing-room, she never mingled with the girls of the middle school as they clustered round the cheerful fire. At meal-times she ate little, and her room-fellow was heard to declare that she was awakened more than once in the middle of the night by the sound of Annie's sobs.  In chapel, too, when she fancied herself quite unobserved, her face wore an expression of great pain; but if Mrs Willis happened to glance in her direction, instantly the little mouth became demure and almost hard, the dark eyelashes were lowered over the bright eyes, the whole expression of the face showed the extreme of indifference.  Hester felt more sure than ever of Annie's guilt; but one or two of the other girls in the school wavered in this opinion, and would have taken Annie out of ""Coventry"" had she herself made the smallest advance toward them.",play room devote little one go draw room mingle girl middle school cluster cheerful fire meal time eat little room fellow hear declare awaken more middle night sound sob chapel fancy unobserve face wear expression great pain happen glance direction little mouth become demure hard dark eyelashe lower bright eye whole expression face show extreme indifference feel sure guilt other girl school waver opinion take make small advance 
6,"Annie and Hester had not spoken to each other now for several days; but on this afternoon, which was a bright one in early spring, as Hester was changing her school-dress for her Sunday one, and preparing for her visit to the Misses Bruce, there came a light knock at her door.  She said ""Come in,"" rather impatiently, for she was in a hurry, and dreaded being kept.",speak other several day afternoon bright one early spring change school dress one prepare visit come light knock door say come hurry dread keep 
7,"To her surprise Annie Forest put in her curly head, and then, dancing with her usual light movement across the room, she laid a little bunch of dainty spring flowers on the dressing-table beside Hester.",surprise put curly head dance usual light movement room lay little bunch dainty spring flower dress table 
8,"Hester stared, first at the intruder and then at the early primroses. She passionately loved flowers, and would have exclaimed with ecstasy at these had anyone brought them in except Annie.",stare intruder early primrose love flower exclaim ecstasy bring 
9,"""I want you,"" said Annie, rather timidly for her, ""to take these flowers from me to Miss Agnes and Miss Jane Bruce.  It will be very kind of you if you will take them.  I am sorry to have interrupted you--thank you very much.""",want say take flower kind take sorry interrupt thank 
10,She was turning away when Hester compelled herself to remark--,turn compel remark 
11,"""Is there any message with the flowers?""",be message flower 
12,"""Oh, no--only Annie Forest's love.  They'll understand.""  She turned half round as she spoke, and Hester saw that her eyes had filled with tears.  She felt touched in spite of herself.  There was something in Annie's face now which reminded her of her darling little Nan at home. She had seen the same beseeching, sorrowful look in Nan's brown eyes when she had wanted her friends to kiss her and take her to their hearts and love her.",love understand turn half speak see eye fill tear feel touch spite be face remind darling little home see same beseeching sorrowful look brown eye want friend kiss take heart love 
13,"Hester would not allow herself, however, to feel any tenderness toward Annie.  Of course she was not really a bit like sweet little Nan, and it was absurd to suppose that a great girl like Annie could want caressing and petting and soothing; still, in spite of herself, Annie's look haunted her, and she took great care of the little flower-offering, and presented it with Annie's message instantly on her arrival to the little old ladies.",allow feel tenderness course bit sweet little absurd suppose great girl want caress petting soothing spite look haunt take great care little flower offering present message arrival little old lady 
14,Miss Jane and Miss Agnes were very much pleased with the early primroses.  They looked at one another and said--,pleased early primrose look say 
15,"""Poor dear little girl,"" in tender voices, and then they put the flowers into one of their daintiest vases, and made much of them, and showed them to any visitors who happened to call that afternoon.",poor dear little girl tender voice put flower daintiest vase make much show visitor happen call afternoon 
16,"Their little house looked something like a doll's house to Hester, who had been accustomed all her life to large rooms and spacious passages; but it was the sweetest, daintiest, and most charming little abode in the world.  It was not unlike a nest, and the Misses Bruce in certain ways resembled bright little robin redbreasts, so small, so neat, so chirrupy they were.",little house look doll house accustom life large room spacious passage sweetest daintiest charming little abode world nest certain way resemble bright little robin redbreast small neat chirrupy 
17,"Hester enjoyed her afternoon immensely; the little ladies were right in their prophecy, and she was no longer lonely at school.  She enjoyed talking about her school-fellows, about her new life, about her studies. The Misses Bruce were decidedly fond of a gossip, but something which she could not at all define in their manner prevented Hester from retailing for their benefit any unkind news.  They told her frankly at last that they were only interested in the good things which went on in the school, and that they found no pursuit so altogether delightful as finding out the best points in all the people they came across.  They would not even laugh at sleepy, tiresome Susan Drummond; on the contrary, they pitied her, and Miss Jane wondered if the girl could be quite well, whereupon Miss Agnes shook her head, and said emphatically that it was Hester's duty to rouse poor Susy, and to make her waking life so interesting to her that she should no longer care to spend so many hours in the world of dreams.",enjoy afternoon little lady right prophecy lonely school enjoy talk school fellow new life study fond gossip define manner prevent retail benefit unkind news tell last interested good thing go school find pursuit delightful find good point person come laugh sleepy tiresome contrary pity wonder girl shake head say duty rouse poor make wake life interesting care spend many hour world dream 
18,"There is such a thing as being so kind-hearted, so gentle, so charitable as to make the people who have not encouraged these virtues feel quite uncomfortable.  By the mere force of contrast they begin to see themselves something as they really are.  Since Hester had come to Lavender House she had taken very little pains to please others rather than herself, and she was now almost startled to see how she had allowed selfishness to get the better of her.  While the Misses Bruce were speaking, old longings, which had slept since her mother's death, came back to the young girl, and she began to wish that she could be kinder to Susan Drummond, and that she could overcome her dislike to Annie Forest.  She longed to say something about Annie to the little ladies, but they evidently did not wish to allude to the subject.  When she was going away, they gave her a small parcel.",be thing kind hearted gentle charitable make person encourage virtue feel uncomfortable mere force contrast begin see come take little pain please other startle see allow selfishness get good speak old longing sleep mother death come young girl begin wish kind overcome dislike long say little lady wish allude subject go give small parcel 
19,"""You will kindly give this to your schoolfellow, Miss Forest, Hester dear,"" they both said, and then they kissed her, and said they hoped they should see her again: and Hester got into the old-fashioned school brougham, and held the brown-paper parcel in her hand.",give dear say kiss say hope see get old fashioned school brougham hold brown paper parcel hand 
20,"As she was going into the chapel that night, Mary Bell came up to her and whispered--",go chapel night come whisper 
21,"""We have not got to the bottom of that mystery about Annie Forest yet. Mrs Willis can evidently make nothing of her, and I believe Mr Everard is going to talk to her after prayers to-night.""",get bottom mystery make believe go talk prayer night 
22,"As she was speaking, Annie herself pushed rather rudely past the two girls; her face was flushed, and her hair was even more untidy than was its wont.",speak push girl face flush hair untidy wont 
23,"""Here is a parcel for you, Miss Forest,"" said Hester, in a much more gentle tone than she was wont to use when she addressed this objectionable school-mate.",parcel say gentle tone wont use address objectionable school mate 
24,"All the girls were now filing into the chapel, and Hester should certainly not have presented the little parcel at that moment.",girl file chapel present little parcel moment 
25,"""Breaking the rules, Miss Thornton,"" said Annie; ""all right, toss it here.""  Then, as Hester failed to comply, she ran back, knocking her school-fellows out of place, and, snatching the parcel from Hester's hand, threw it high in the air.  This was a piece of not only wilful audacity and disobedience, but it even savoured of the profane, for Annie's step was on the threshold of the chapel, and the parcel fell with a noisy bang on the floor some feet inside the little building.",break rule say right toss fail comply run knock school fellow place snatch parcel hand throw air piece wilful audacity disobedience savoure profane step threshold chapel parcel fall noisy bang floor foot little building 
26,"""Bring me that parcel, Annie Forest,"" whispered the stern voice of the head-mistress.",bring parcel whisper stern voice head mistress 
27,"Annie sullenly complied; but when she came up to Mrs Willis, her governess took her hand, and pushed her down into a low seat a little behind her.",complie come governess take hand push low seat little
