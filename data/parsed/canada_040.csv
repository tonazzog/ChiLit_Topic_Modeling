1,CHAPTER XL.,
2," Captain Sinclair on his return to Fort Frontignac reported to the Colonel the successful result of the expedition, and was warmly congratulated upon it, as the Colonel had been made acquainted with the engagement between him and Mary Percival. The Young Otter, who had remained in confinement during Captain Sinclair's absence, was now set at liberty; and the Colonel, who was aware that Captain Sinclair must be very anxious to remain at the settlement for a short time after what had occurred, very kindly offered him leave for a few days, which it may be supposed Captain Sinclair did not fail to avail himself of. The Colonel at the same time sent a message to Mr. Campbell, stating that as soon as the _bateaux_ should arrive from Montreal, he would bring any letters or newspapers that might arrive for them, and take that opportunity of offering in person his congratulations.",return report successful result expedition congratulate make acquainted engagement young remain confinement absence set liberty aware anxious remain settlement short time occur offer leave few day suppose fail avail same time send message state _bateaux_ arrive bring letter newspaper arrive take opportunity offer person congratulation 
3,"Captain Sinclair did not, however, return for two or three days, as he had many letters to write in answer to those which had arrived during his absence. On his return to the settlement, he found them all well and happy; Mary quite recovered from her fatigue, and every thing going on in the same quiet order and method as if the expedition had never taken place, and had never been necessary. Indeed, nothing appeared now wanting to the happiness of the whole party, and their affairs were prospering. The emigrants who had joined Mr. Campbell were industrious and intelligent, very civil, and very useful. They paid the greatest respect to Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, who were certainly very liberal and kind to them, assisting them in every way in their power. Although the farm had been so much increased, the labor was light, from the quantity of hands they could command; the stock had increased very fast; old Graves had taken charge of the mill during the absence of Alfred and Martin, and had expressed his wish to continue in that employment, which Alfred gladly gave up. In short, peace and plenty reigned in the settlement, and Alfred's words when he recommended his father to go to Canada, had every prospect of becoming true--that his father would be independent, if not rich, and leave his children the same. In three days Captain Sinclair arrived; he was received with great warmth by all the party, and after dinner was over, Mr. Campbell addressed the family as follows:--",return day have many letter write answer arrive absence return settlement find happy recover fatigue thing go same quiet order method expedition take place necessary appear want happiness whole party affair prosper emigrant join industrious intelligent civil useful pay great respect liberal kind assist way power farm increase labor light quantity hand command stock increase old take charge mill absence express wish continue employment give short peace plenty reign settlement word recommend father go have prospect become true father independent rich leave child same day arrive receive great warmth party dinner address family follow 
4,"""My dear children, your mother and I have had some conversation on one or two points, and we have come to the decision that having so much to thank God for, in his kindness and mercies shown toward us, it would be selfish on our parts if we did not consult the happiness of others. We are now independent, and with every prospect of being more so every day; we are no longer isolated, but surrounded by those who are attached to us and will protect us should there be any occasion. In short, we are living in comfort and security, and we trust to Providence that we shall continue so to do. You, my dear Alfred, generously abandoned your profession to which you were so partial, to come and protect us in the wilderness, and we knew too well the value of your services not to accept them, although we were fully aware of the sacrifice which you made; but we are no longer in the wilderness, and no longer require your strong arm and bold heart. We have therefore decided that it is our duty no longer to keep you from the profession to which you belong, but, on the contrary, to recommend you now to rejoin and follow up your career, which we trust in God may prove as prosperous as we are convinced it will be honorable. Take our best thanks, my dear boy, for your kindness to us, and now consider yourself at liberty to return to England, and rejoin the service as soon as you please.",dear child mother have conversation point come decision have much thank kindness mercie show selfish part consult happiness other independent prospect day isolated surround attach protect be occasion short live comfort security trust continue do dear abandon profession partial come protect wilderness know value service accept aware sacrifice make wilderness require strong arm bold heart decide duty keep profession belong contrary recommend rejoin follow career trust prove prosperous convince honorable take good thanks dear boy kindness consider liberty return rejoin service 
5,"""And now I must address you, my dear Mary; you and your sister accompanied us here, and since you have been with us, have cheered us during our stay by your attentions and unwearied cheerfulness under all the privations which we at first had to encounter. You have engaged the affections of an honorable and deserving man, but at the same time have never shown the least disposition to leave us; indeed, we know what your determination has been, but your aunt and I consider it our present duty to say, that much as we shall regret to part with one so dear, you must no longer sacrifice yourself for us, but make him happy who so well deserves you. That you will remain here is of course out of the question; your husband's connections and fortune require that he should return to England, and not bury himself in the woods of Canada. You have therefore our full permission, and I may say, it will be most pleasing to us, if you no longer delay your union with Captain Sinclair and follow your husband; whenever and wherever you go, you will have our blessing and our prayers, and the satisfaction of knowing that you have been to us as a dutiful daughter, and that we love you as dearly as it is possible for parents to do. Take her, Captain Sinclair, from my hands, and take with her our blessings and best wishes for your happiness, which I do not doubt will be as great as we can expect in this checkered world; for a dutiful daughter will always become a good wife.""",address dear sister accompany cheer stay attention unwearied cheerfulness privation have encounter engage affection honorable deserving man same time show least disposition leave know determination aunt consider present duty say much regret part dear sacrifice make happy deserve remain course question husband connection fortune require return bury wood have full permission say pleasing delay union follow husband go have blessing prayer satisfaction know dutiful daughter love possible parent do take hand take blessing good wish happiness doubt great expect checkered world dutiful daughter become good wife 
6,"Mary, who was sitting between Mrs. Campbell and Captain Sinclair, fell upon her aunt's neck and wept; Mr. Campbell extended his hand to Captain Sinclair, who expressed in return his warmest thanks and gratitude. Alfred, who had said nothing more, went up to his mother and kissed her.",sit fall aunt neck goot extend hand express return warmest thanks gratitude say go mother kiss

9,"Mrs. Campbell now took Mary Percival into the next room, that she might compose herself, and Captain Sinclair ventured to follow. Every one appeared happy at this announcement of Mr. Campbell except Emma, who looked unusually serious. Alfred, perceiving it, said to her, ""Emma, you are very grave at the idea of losing Mary, and I do not wonder at it, but you will have one consolation,--you will lose me too, and I shall no longer plague you as you continually complain that I do.""",take next room compose venture follow one appear happy announcement look serious perceive say grave idea lose wonder have consolation lose plague complain 
10,"""I never thought of that,"" replied Emma, half angry; ""well, you _are_ a great plague, and the sooner you go--""",think reply half angry great plague go 
11,"Emma did not, however, finish her speech, but left the room, to join her sister.",finish speech leave room join sister 
12,"Now that Mr. Campbell had announced his wishes, the subject of Mary's marriage and Alfred's return to the service was, for a few days, the continual subject of discussion. It was decided that Mary should be married in a month, by the chaplain of the fort, who had returned, and that Captain Sinclair, with his wife and Alfred, should leave the settlement at the end of September, so as to arrive at Quebec in good time for sailing before the winter should set in. It was now the last week in August, so that there was not much time to pass away previous to their departure. Captain Sinclair returned to the fort, to make the Colonel acquainted with what had passed, and to take the necessary steps for leave of absence, and his return to England. This, from his interest with the Governor, he was sure to obtain, and when in England, it would be time sufficient to decide whether he should leave that service or exchange into some regiment at home. As every prospect of war or disturbance in Canada was now over, he could take either step without any censure being laid upon him.",announce wish subject marriage return service few day continual subject discussion decide marry month chaplain fort return wife leave settlement end arrive good time sailing winter set last week be much time pass previous departure return fort make acquainted pass take necessary step leave absence return interest sure obtain time sufficient decide leave service exchange regiment home prospect war disturbance take step censure lay 
13,"A week afterward, the _bateaux_ arrived from Montreal, and the Colonel and Captain Sinclair made their appearance at the settlement, bringing with them the letters and papers from England.",week arrive make appearance settlement bring letter paper 
14,"Having received the congratulations of the Colonel, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, with his permission, opened their letters, for all the family were present, and all, as usual, anxious to hear the news. The first letter Mr. Campbell opened, to the surprise of all, produced an immediate change in his countenance. He read it a second time, and laying it down on his knee, appeared to remain in a state of complete abstraction.",receive congratulation permission open letter family present usual anxious hear news first letter open surprise produce immediate change countenance read second time lay knee appear remain state complete abstraction 
15,"""No bad news, I hope, Campbell?"" said his wife anxiously, as all the rest looked upon him with astonishment.",bad news hope say wife rest look astonishment 
16,"""No, my dear Emily, no bad news, but most unexpected news; such as it has been my fortune in life to receive once before this time.

19,"Mr. Campbell then read as follows:--                                                       ""May 7, 18--",read follow

21,"     ""You may remember that many months back Mr. Douglas Campbell      received a fall from his horse when hunting.

""You have proved yourself deserving of such good fortune; Mrs. Campbell, I need hardly add that my congratulations extend to you.""",congratulate heart say rise take hand prove deserve such good fortune need add congratulation extend

28,"""We are in the hands of Him, and do but execute His will. For your sake, my dear Campbell, for the children's sake, perhaps, I ought to rejoice--we hardly know. That I am happy here, now that my children have been restored to me, I confess. I doubt whether that happiness will be increased by the return to Wexton Hall; at all events, I shall leave this place with regret. We have had too many revolutions of fortune, Campbell, since we have been united, not to have learned by experience that a peaceful, quiet, and contented home is more necessary to our happiness than riches.""",hand do execute will sake dear child sake rejoice know happy child restore confess doubt happiness increase return event leave place regret have many revolution fortune unite learn experience peaceful quiet contented home necessary happiness rich

32,"The Colonel and Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, as well as the elder portion of the party, could not help smiling at the exclamation of the two boys. They had both played the part of men, and it was but too evident how unfitted they would be for future scholastic discipline.",elder portion party help smile exclamation boy play part man evident unfitted future scholastic discipline

34,"It is hard to say whether much real joy was felt by any of the party at the prospect of returning to England. It is true that Mary Percival was delighted at the idea of not being so far from her aunt and uncle, and that Emma was better pleased to be in England, for reasons which she kept to herself. But it was not the coming into the large property which occasioned pleasure to any of them. However, if there was not much pleasure derived from this re-accession to property, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell knew their duty too well to hesitate, and every preparation was commenced for their return along with Alfred and Captain Sinclair. John, however, still continued obstinate in declaring that he would not go, and Percival was very much of John's opinion, although he did not speak so plainly.",hard say much real joy feel party prospect return true delighted idea aunt uncle pleased reason keep come large property occasion pleasure be much pleasure derive re-accession property know duty hesitate preparation commence return continue obstinate declare go much opinion speak

36,"""I do not know what to do about John. He appears so resolute in his determination not to go with us, that I fear he will run away into the woods at the time of our departure.

37,"""It is hard to decide, Campbell; I have more than once thought it would be better to leave him here. He is our youngest son. Henry will of course inherit the estate, and we shall have to provide for the others out of our savings. Now this property, by the time that John is of age, will be of no inconsiderable value, and by no means a bad fortune for a younger son. He appears so wedded to the woods and a life of nature, that I fear it would only be the cause of continual regret and discontent if we did take him to England; and if so, what comfort or advantage should we gain by his returning?

40,"The result of Mrs. Campbell's communicating with her sons, was a decision that John should remain in Canada, under the charge of Martin and Malachi, who were to superintend the farm, and watch over him. Martin was to take charge of the farm. Malachi was to be John's companion in the woods, and old Graves, who had their mill under his care, engaged to correspond with Mr. Campbell, and let them know how things went on. When this was settled, John walked at least two inches higher, and promised to write to his mother himself. The Colonel, when he heard the arrangement, pledged himself that as long as he was in command of the fort, he would keep a watchful eye, not only over John, but the whole of the settlement, and communicate occasionally with Mr. Campbell.",result communicate son decision remain charge superintend farm watch take charge farm companion wood old have mill care engage correspond let know thing go settle walk least inch high promise write mother hear arrangement pledge command fort keep watchful eye whole settlement communicate

48,"John remained in Canada until he was twenty years old, when he came home to see his father and mother. He had grown to six feet four inches high, and was stout in proportion. He was a very amusing fellow, and could talk fast enough, but his chief conversation was upon hunting and sporting. The farm had been well conducted; the emigrants had adhered to the agreements and were now cultivating for themselves. Martin had three papooses (as the Indians call the children) by the Strawberry. Malachi had grown too old to go out often into the woods, and he sat by the fire in the winter, and basked in the sun at the door of the house during the summer. Oscar was dead, but they had some fine puppies of his breed. Mr. Campbell gave John a deed, on his return, conveying to him the Canadian property, and shortly afterward John picked up a little Canadian wife at Quebec, who made him perfectly happy.",remain year old come see father mother grow foot inch high stout proportion amusing fellow talk chief conversation hunting sport farm conduct emigrant adhere agreement cultivate have papoose call child grow old go wood sit fire winter bask sun door house summer dead have fine puppy breed give deed return convey canadian property pick little canadian wife make happy 
49,"Mr. and Mrs. Campbell lived to a good old age, respected as long as they lived, and lamented when they died. They had known prosperity and adversity, and in each state of life had acquitted themselves with exemplary propriety, not having been elated by the one, or depressed by the other. They knew that this world was a world of trial, and but a preparation for another; they therefore did their duty in that state of life to which it pleased God to call them--proving in all their actions, that they remembered their duty to their God, and their duty to their neighbor; living and dying (as I hope all my young readers will) sincere and good Christians.
