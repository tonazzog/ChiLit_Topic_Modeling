5,"The girls were busily engaged in preparing an Easter feast for Cocksmoor. Mr. Wilmot was to examine the scholars, and buns and tea were provided, in addition to which Ethel designed to make a present to every one--a great task, considering that the Cocksmoor funds were reserved for absolute necessaries, and were at a very low ebb. So that twenty-five gifts were to be composed out of nothing!",girl engage prepare feast examine scholar bun tea provide addition design make present one great task consider fund reserve absolute necessary low ebb gift compose 
6,"There was a grand turn-out of drawers of rubbish, all over Margaret, raising such a cloud of dust as nearly choked her. What cannot rubbish and willing hands effect! Envelopes and wafer boxes were ornamented with pictures, bags, needle-cases, and pincushions, beautiful balls, tippets, both of list and gay print, and even sun-bonnets and pinafores were contrived, to the supreme importance and delight of Mary and Blanche, who found it as good or better than play, and ranged their performances in rows, till the room looked like a bazaar. To provide for boys was more difficult; but Richard mended old toys, and repaired the frames of slates, and Norman’s contribution of half-a-crown bought mugs, marbles, and penny knives, and there were even hopes that something would remain for bodkins, to serve as nozzles to the bellows, which were the pride of Blanche’s heart.",be grand turn drawer rubbish raise cloud dust choke rubbish willing hand effect envelope wafer box ornament picture bag needle case pincushion beautiful ball tippet list gay print sun-bonnet pinafore contrived supreme importance delight find good good play rang performance row room look bazaar provide boy difficult mend old toy repair frame slate contribution half crown buy mug marble penny knife be hope remain bodkin serve nozzle bellow pride heart 
7,"Never were Easter gifts the source of more pleasure to the givers, especially when the nursery establishment met Dr. Hoxton near the pastrycook’s shop, and he bestowed on Blanche a packet of variegated sugar-plums, all of which she literally poured out at Ethel’s feet, saying, “I don’t want them. Only let me have one for Aubrey, because he is so little. All the rest are for the poor children at Cocksmoor.”",gift source more pleasure giver nursery establishment meet pastrycook shop bestow packet variegated sugar plum pour foot say want let have little rest poor child 
8,"After this, Margaret declared that Blanche must be allowed to buy the bodkin, and give her bellows to Jane Taylor, the only Cocksmoor child she knew, and to whom she always destined in turn every gift that she thought most successful.",declare allow buy bodkin give bellow only child know destine turn gift think successful 
9,"So Blanche went with Flora to the toy-shop, and there fell in love with a little writing-box, that so eclipsed the bellows, that she tried to persuade Flora to buy it for Jane Taylor, to be kept till she could write, and was much disappointed to hear that it was out of the question. Just then a carriage stopped, and from it stepped the pretty little figure of Meta Rivers.",go toy shop fall love little writing box eclipse bellow try persuade buy keep write disappointed hear question carriage stop step little figure 
10,"“Oh! how do you do? How delightful to meet you! I was wondering if we should! Little Blanche too!” kissing her, “and here’s Mrs. Larpent--Mrs. Larpent--Miss Flora May. How is Miss May?”",do delightful meet wonder little kiss 
11,"This was all uttered in eager delight, and Flora, equally pleased, answered the inquiries. “I hope you are not in a hurry,” proceeded Meta; “I want your advice. You know all about schools, don’t you? I am come to get some Easter presents for our children, and I am sure you can help me.”",utter eager delight pleased answer inquiry hope hurry proceed meta want advice know school come get present child sure help 
12,“Are the children little or big?” asked Flora.,child little big ask 
13,"“Oh! all sorts and sizes. I have some books for the great sensible ones, and some stockings and shoes for the tiresome stupid ones, but there are some dear little pets that I want nice things for.

14,"The price of the doll was a shilling, and there were quickly added to it, boxes of toys, elaborate bead-work pincushions, polished blue and green boxes, the identical writing-case--even a small Noah’s ark. Meta hardly asked the prices, which certainly were not extravagant, since she had nearly twenty articles for little more than a pound.",price doll shilling add box toy elaborate bead work pincushion polished blue green box identical writing case small ark ask price extravagant have article little more pound

20,"She departed, and Flora returned to her own business; but Blanche’s interest was gone. Dazzled by the more lavish gifts, she looked listlessly and disdainfully at bodkins, three for twopence. “I wish I might have bought the writing-box for Janet Taylor! Why does not papa give us money to get pretty things for the children?” said she, as soon as they came out.",depart return own business interest gone dazzle lavish gift look bodkin twopence wish buy writing box give money get pretty thing child say come

23,"“Yes. We like Miss Rivers very much,” said Flora, resolved to show that she was acquainted.",like say resolve show acquainted 
24,"“Oh! do you visit her? I knew he was a patient of Dr. May.” Flora thought there was no need to tell that the only call had been owing to the rain, and continued, “She has been begging us to come to her school feast, but I do not think we can manage it.”",visit know patient think be need tell only call ow rain continue begg come school feast think manage

26,"“Very,” said Flora. “Good-morning.”",say good morning 
27,"Flora had a little uneasiness in her conscience, but it was satisfactory to have put down Louisa Anderson, who never could aspire to an intimacy with Miss Rivers. Her little sister looked up--“Why, Flora, have you seen the Grange?”",have little uneasiness conscience satisfactory put aspire intimacy little sister look see 
28,"“No, but papa and Norman said so.”",say 
29,"And Blanche showed that the practical lesson on the pomps of the world was not lost on her, by beginning to wish they were as rich as Miss Rivers. Flora told her it was wrong to be discontented, but the answer was, “I don’t want it for myself, I want to have pretty things to give away.”",show practical lesson pomp world lose begin wish rich tell wrong discontent answer want want have pretty thing give 
30,"And her mind could not be turned from the thought by any attempt of her sister. Even when they met Dr. May coming out of the hospital, Blanche renewed the subject. She poured out the catalogue of Miss Rivers’s purchases, making appealing attempts at looking under his spectacles into his eyes, and he perfectly understood the tenor of her song.",mind turn thought attempt sister meet come hospital renew subject pour catalogue purchase make appealing attempt look spectacle eye understand tenor song

39,"“Perhaps I want my sovereigns for the eleven gaping mouths at home, Blanche. But would not it be a pity to spoil your pleasure? You would have lost all the chattering and laughing and buzzing I have heard round Margaret of late, and I am quite sure Miss Rivers can hardly be as happy in the gifts that cost her nothing, as one little girl who gives her sugar-plums out of her own mouth!”",want sovereign gaping mouth home pity spoil pleasure lose chattering laugh buzz hear late sure happy gift cost little girl give sugar plum own mouth

41,"“Ay, ay,” said the doctor. “Seeing Miss Rivers’s must not take the shine out of yours, my little maids; for if you can’t give much, you have the pleasure of giving the best of all, your labour of love.” Then thinking on, and speaking to Flora, “The longer I live, the more I see the blessing of being born in a state of life where you can’t both eat your cake and give it away.”",say doctor see take shine little maid give much have pleasure give good labour love think speak long live more see blessing bear state life eat cake give

43,"“No, indeed, she is as good and sweet a creature as ever came across me--most kind to Margaret, and loving to all the world. I like to see one whom care and grief have never set their grip upon. Most likely she would do like Ethel, if she had the opportunity, but she has not.”",good sweet creature come kind love world like see care grief set grip likely do have opportunity 
44,“So she has not the same merit?” said Flora.,have same merit say 
45,"“We don’t talk of merit. I mean that the power of sacrifice is a great advantage. The habit of small sacrifice that is made necessary in a large family is a discipline that only-children are without: and so, with regard to wealth, I think people are to be pitied who can give extensively out of such abundance that they can hardly feel the want.”",talk merit mean power sacrifice great advantage habit small sacrifice make necessary large family discipline child regard wealth think person pity give such abundance feel want 
46,"“In effect, they can do much more,” said Flora.",effect do more say 
47,"“I am not sure of that. They can, of course, but it must be at the cost of personal labour and sacrifice. I have often thought of the words, ‘Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee.’ And ‘such as we have’ it is that does the good; the gold, if we have it, but, at any rate, the personal influence; the very proof of sincerity, shown by the exertion and self-denial, tells far more than money lightly come by, lightly spent.”",sure course cost personal labour sacrifice think word silver gold such give such have good gold have rate personal influence very proof sincerity show exertion self denial tell more money come spend

49,"“If the rich person take no pains, and leave the school to take care of itself--nay, if he only visit it now and then, and never let it inconvenience him, has he the least security that the scholars are obtaining any real good from it? If the teacher of the one child is doing his utmost, he is working for himself at least.”",rich person take pain leave school take care visit let inconvenience least security scholar obtain real good teacher child do utmost work least

51,"“If things were ripe for it, the means would come. As it is, it is a fine field for Ethel and Richard. I believe it will be the making of them both.

A visit from you will cheer her up.”",thing ripe means come fine field believe making sure train make train do come see old visit cheer 
52,"Flora was glad of the interruption, the conversation was uncomfortable to her. She almost fancied her papa was moralising for their good, but that he carried it too far, for wealthy people assuredly had it in their power to do great things, and might work as hard themselves; besides, it was finer in them, there was so much eclat in their stooping to charity. But her knowledge of his character would not allow her to think for a moment that he could say aught but from the bottom of his heart--no, it was one of his one-sided views that led him into paradox. “It was just like papa,” and so there was no need to attend to it. It was one of his enthusiasms, he was so very fond of Ethel, probably because of her likeness to himself. Flora thought Ethel put almost too forward--they all helped at Cocksmoor, and Ethel was very queer and unformed, and could do nothing by herself. The only thing Flora did keep in her mind was, that her papa had spoken to her, as if she were a woman compared with Ethel.",glad interruption conversation uncomfortable fancy papa moralise good carry wealthy person have power do great thing work finer be much eclat stooping charity knowledge character allow think moment say aught bottom heart sided view lead paradox papa be need attend enthusiasm fond likeness think put help queer unformed do only thing keep mind papa speak woman compare 
53,"Little Blanche made her report of the conversation to Mary, “that it was so nice; and now she did not care about Miss Rivers’s fine presents at all, for papa said what one made oneself was better to give than what one bought. And papa said, too, that it was a good thing not to be rich, for then one never felt the miss of what one gave away.”",little make report conversation nice care fine present papa say one make good give one buy say good thing rich feel miss one give 
54,"Margaret, who overheard the exposition, thought it so much to Blanche’s credit, that she could not help repeating it in the evening, after the little girl was gone to bed, when Mr. Wilmot had come in to arrange the programme for Cocksmoor. So the little fit of discontent and its occasion, the meeting with Meta Rivers, were discussed.",overhear exposition think much credit help repeat evening little girl go bed come arrange programme little fit discontent occasion meeting discuss 
55,"“Yes,” said Mr. Wilmot, “those Riverses are open-handed. They really seem to have so much money, that they don’t know what to do with it. My brother is ready to complain that they spoil his parish. It is all meant so well, and they are so kind-hearted and excellent, that it is a shame to find fault, and I tell Charles and his wife that their grumbling at such a squire proves them the most spoiled of all.”",say riverse open handed seem have much money know do brother ready complain spoil parish mean kind hearted excellent shame find fault tell wife grumbling squire prove spoiled 
56,“Indiscriminate liberality?” asked the doctor. “I should guess the old gentleman to be rather soft!”,indiscriminate liberality ask doctor guess old gentleman soft 
57,"“That’s one thing. The parish is so small, and there are so few to shower all this bounty on, and they are so utterly unused to country people. They seem to think by laying out money they can get a show set of peasants in rustic cottages, just as they have their fancy cows and poultry--all that offends the eye out of the way.”",thing parish small be few shower bounty unused country person seem think lay money get show set peasant rustic cottage have fancy cow poultry offend eye way

63,"“Perhaps not. Charles and Mary are very fond of her, but she is entirely inexperienced, and that is a serious thing with so much money to throw about. She pays people for sending their children to school, and keeping their houses tidy; and there is so much given away, that it is enough to take away all independence and motive for exertion. The people speculate on it, and take it as a right; by-and-by there will be a reaction--she will find out she is imposed upon, take offence, and for the rest of her life will go about saying how ungrateful the poor are!”",fond inexperienced serious thing much money throw pay person send child school keep house tidy be much give enough take independence motive exertion person speculate take right be reaction find impose take offence rest life go say ungrateful poor

She seems to me made to lavish pleasures on others wherever she goes.”",see say win papa heart kindness say smile see beautiful flower seem make lavish pleasure other go 
66,"“Oh, yes, they are most kind-hearted,” said Mr. Wilmot. “It is only the excess of a virtue that could be blamed in them, and they are most valuable to the place. She will learn experience in time--I only hope she will not be spoiled.”",kind hearted say excess virtue blame valuable place learn experience time hope spoiled 
67,"Flora felt as if her father must be thinking his morning’s argument confirmed, and she was annoyed. But she thought there was no reason why wealth should not be used sensibly, and if she were at the head of such an establishment as the Grange, her charity should be so well regulated as to be the subject of general approbation.",feel father think morning argument confirm annoyed think be reason wealth use head establishment charity regulate subject general approbation 
68,"She wanted to find some one else on her side, and, as they went to bed, she said to Ethel, “Don’t you wish we had some of this superfluity of the Riverses for poor Cocksmoor?”",want find one else side go bed say wish have superfluity poor

71,"“Yes, but if they don’t manage right with them! I’ll tell you, Flora, I got into a fit of wishing the other day; it does seem such a grievous pity to see those children running to waste for want of daily teaching, and Jenny Hall had forgotten everything. I was vexed, and thought it was all no use while we could not do more; but just then I began to look out the texts Ritchie had marked for me to print for them to learn, and the first was, ‘Be thou faithful over a few things, and I will make thee ruler over many things,’ and then I thought perhaps we were learning to be faithful with a few things. I am sure what they said to-night showed it was lucky we have not more in our hands. I should do wrong for ever with the little we have if it were not for Ritchie and Margaret. By the time we have really got the money together for the school, perhaps I shall have more sense.”",manage tell get fit wish other day seem grievous pity see child run waste want daily teaching forget vex think use do more begin look text mark print learn first faithful few thing make ruler many thing think learn faithful few thing sure say night show lucky have more hand do wrong little have time get money school have more sense

It need not be more than £70, Ritchie says, and I have twelve shillings for certain, put out from the money for hire of the room, and the books and clothes, and, in spite of these horrid boots, I shall save something out of this quarter, half-a-crown at least. And I have another plan besides--”",more say have shilling certain put money hire room book clothes spite horrid boot save quarter half crown least have plan 
74,"But Flora had to go down to Margaret’s room to bed. Flora was always ready to throw herself into the present, and liked to be the most useful person in all that went forward, so that no thoughts of greatness interfered with her enjoyment at Cocksmoor.",have go room bed ready throw present like useful person go thought greatness interfer enjoyment 
75,"The house seemed wild that Easter Monday morning. Ethel, Mary, and Blanche, flew about in all directions, and in spite of much undoing of their own arrangements, finished their preparations so much too early, that, at half-past eleven, Mary complained that she had nothing to do, and that dinner would never come.",house seem wild morning fly direction spite much undoing own arrangement finish preparation half past complain have do dinner come

77,"The first division started on foot directly after dinner, the real Council of education, as Norman called them, namely, Mr. Wilmot, Richard, Ethel, and Mary; Flora, the other member, waited to take care of Blanche and Aubrey, who were to come in the gig, with the cakes, tea-kettles, and prizes, driven by Norman. Tom and Hector Ernescliffe were invited to join the party, and many times did Mary wish for Harry.",first division start foot dinner real council education call other member wait take care come gig cake tea- kettle prize drive invite join party many time wish 
78,"Supremely happy were the young people as they reached the common, and heard the shout of tumultuous joy, raised by their pupils, who were on the watch for them. All was now activity. Everybody tripped into Mrs. Green’s house, while Richard and Ethel ran different ways to secure that the fires were burning, which they had hired, to boil their kettles, with the tea in them.",happy young person reach common hear shout tumultuous joy raise pupil watch activity trip house run different way secure fire burn hire boil kettle tea 
79,"Then when the kitchen was so full that it seemed as if it could hold no more, some kind of order was produced, the children were seated on their benches, and, while the mothers stood behind to listen, Mr. Wilmot began to examine, as well as he could in so crowded an audience.",kitchen full seem hold more kind order produce child seat bench mother stand listen begin examine crowd audience 
80,"There was progress. Yes, there was. Only three were as utterly rude and idealess as they used to be at Christmas. Glimmerings had dawned on most, and one--Una M’Carthy--was fit to come forward to claim Mr. Wilmot’s promise of a Prayer-book. She could really read and say the Catechism--her Irish wit and love of learning had outstripped all the rest--and she was the pride of Ethel’s heart, fit, now, to present herself on equal terms with the Stoneborough set, as far as her sense was concerned--though, alas! neither present nor exhortation had succeeded in making her anything, in looks, but a picturesque tatterdemalion, her sandy elf locks streaming over a pair of eyes, so dancing and gracieuses, that it was impossible to scold her.",be progress be rude idealess use glimmering dawn most fit come claim promise prayer book read say irish wit love learning outstripp rest pride heart fit present equal term set sense concerned present exhortation succeed make look picturesque tatterdemalion sandy elf lock stream pair eye dancing gracieuse impossible scold 
81,"With beating heart, as if her own success in life depended for ever on the way her flock acquitted themselves, Ethel stood by Mr. Wilmot, trying to read answers coming out of the dull mouths of her children, and looking exultingly at Richard whenever some good reply was made, especially when Una answered an unexpected question. It was too delightful to hear how well she remembered all the history up to the flood, and how prettily it came out in her Irish accent! That made up for all the atrocious stupidity of others, who, after being told every time since they had begun who gave their names, now chose to forget.",beat heart own success life depend way flock acquitt stand try read answer come dull mouth child look good reply make answer unexpected question delightful hear remember history flood come irish accent make atrocious stupidity other tell time begin give name choose forget 
82,"In the midst, while the assembly were listening with admiration to the reading of the scholar next in proficiency to Una, a boy who could read words of five letters without spelling, there was a fresh squeezing at the door, and, the crowd opening as well as it could, in came Flora and Blanche, while Norman’s head was seen for a moment in the doorway.",midst assembly listen admiration reading scholar proficiency boy read word letter spelling be fresh squeezing door crowd opening come head see moment doorway

90,"Norman’s face was a sight, as he stood holding Aubrey in his arms, to gratify the child’s impatience. The stifling den, the uncouth aspect of the children, the head girl so very ragged a specimen, thoroughly revolted his somewhat fastidious disposition. This was Ethel’s delight! to this she made so many sacrifices! this was all that her time and labour had effected! He did not wish to vex her but it was more than he could stand.",face sight stand hold arm gratify child impatience stifling dan uncouth aspect child head girl ragge specimen revolt fastidious disposition delight make many sacrifice time labour effect wish vex more stand 
91,"However, Ethel was too much engrossed to look for sympathy. It was a fine spring day, and on the open space of the common the arrangements were quickly made. The children stood in a long line, and the baskets were unpacked. Flora and Ethel called the names, Mary and Blanche gave the presents, and assuredly the grins, courtesies, and pulls of the forelock they elicited, could not have been more hearty for any of Miss Rivers’s treasures. The buns and the kettles of tea followed--it was perfect delight to entertainers and entertained, except when Mary’s dignity was cruelly hurt by Norman’s authoritatively taking a kettle out of her hands, telling her she would be the death of herself or somebody else, and reducing her to the mere rank of a bun distributor, which Blanche and Aubrey could do just as well; while he stalked along with a grave and resigned countenance, filling up the cups held out to him by timid-looking children. Mary next fell in with Granny Hall, who had gone into such an ecstasy over Blanche and Aubrey, that Blanche did not know which way to look; and Aubrey, in some fear that the old woman might intend to kiss him, returned the compliments by telling her she was “ugly up in her face,” at which she laughed heartily, and uttered more vehement benedictions.",engross look sympathy fine spring day open space common arrangement make child stand long line basket unpack call name give present grin courtesy pull forelock elicite hearty treasure bun kettle tea follow perfect delight entertainer entertain dignity hurt take kettle hand tell death else reduce mere rank bun distributor do stalked grave resign countenance fill cup hold timid look child fall go ecstasy know way look fear old woman intend kiss return compliment tell ugly face laugh utter more vehement benediction 
92,"Finally, the three best children, boys and girls, were to be made fit to be seen, and recommended by Mr. Wilmot to the Sunday-school and penny club at Stoneborough, and, this being proclaimed and the children selected, the assembly dispersed, Mr. Wilmot rejoicing Ethel and Richard by saying, “Well, really, you have made a beginning. There is an improvement in tone among those children, that is more satisfactory than any progress they may have made.”",good child boy girl make fit see recommend school penny club proclaim child select assembly disperse rejoice say make beginning be improvement tone child satisfactory progress make

104,"They rushed into the drawing-room, full of glee, when they came home, all shouting their news together, and had not at first leisure to perceive that Margaret had some tidings for them in return. Mr. Rivers had been there, with a pressing invitation to his daughter’s school-feast, and it had been arranged that Flora and Ethel should go and spend the day at the Grange, and their father come to dine, and fetch them home in the evening. Margaret had been much pleased with the manner in which the thing was done. When Dr. May, who seemed reluctant to accept the proposal that related to himself, was called out of the room, Mr. Rivers had, in a most kind manner, begged her to say whether she thought it would be painful to him, or whether it might do his spirits good. She decidedly gave her opinion in favour of the invitation, Mr. Rivers gained his point, and she had ever since been persuading her father to like the notion, and assuring him it need not be made a precedent for the renewal of invitations to dine out in the town. He thought the change would be pleasant for his girls, and had, therefore, consented.",rush draw room full glee come shouting news have first leisure perceive have tiding return press invitation daughter school feast arrange go spend day father come dine fetch evening pleased manner thing do seem reluctant accept proposal relate call room kind manner begg say think painful do spirit good give opinion favour invitation gain point persuade father like notion assure make precedent renewal invitation dine town think change pleasant girl consent

111,"Ethel threw herself eagerly into the history of the examination, and had almost forgotten the invitation till she heard the front door open. Then it was not she, but Margaret, who told Flora--Ethel could not, as she said, enjoy what seemed to sadden her father. Flora received it much more calmly. “It will be very pleasant,” said she; “it was very kind of papa to consent. You will have Richard and Norman, Margaret, to be with you in the evening.”",throw history examination forget invitation hear front door open tell say enjoy seem sadd father receive pleasant say kind papa consent have evening

113,"The invitation was a convenient subject of conversation, for Norman had so much to tell his sisters of the curiosities they must look for at the Grange, that he was not obliged to mention Cocksmoor. He did not like to mortify Ethel by telling her his intense disgust, and he knew he was about to do what she would think a great injury by speaking to his father on the subject; but he thought it for her real welfare, and took the first opportunity of making to his father and Margaret a most formidable description of Ethel’s black-hole. It quite alarmed Margaret, but the doctor smiled, saying, “Ay, ay, I know the face Norman puts on if he looks into a cottage.”",invitation convenient subject conversation have much tell sister curiosity look oblige mention like mortify tell intense disgust know about do think great injury speak father subject think real welfare take first opportunity make father formidable description black hole alarm doctor smile say know face put look cottage

133,"Norman paused, and coloured. He remembered the pain it had given him to find himself incapable of being of use to his father, and that he had resolved to conquer the weakness of nerve of which he was ashamed; but he did not like to connect this with his fastidious feelings of refinement. He would not own to himself that they were over nice, and, at the bottom of all this justification, rankled Richard’s saying, that he who cared for such things was unfit for a clergyman. Norman’s secret thought was, it was all very well for those who could only aspire to parish work in wretched cottages--people who could distinguish themselves were more useful at the university, forming minds, and opening new discoveries in learning.",pause coloured remember pain give find incapable use father resolve conquer weakness nerve ashamed like connect fastidious feeling refinement own nice bottom justification rankle say care such thing unfit clergyman secret thought aspire parish work wretch cottage person distinguish useful university form mind open new discovery learning 
134,"Was Norman quite proof against the consciousness of daily excelling all his competitors? His superiority had become even more manifest this Easter, when Cheviot and Forder, the two elder boys whom he had outstripped, left the school, avowedly, because it was not worth while for them to stay, since they had so little chance of the Randall scholarship. Norman had now only to walk over the course, no one even approaching him but Harvey Anderson.",proof consciousness excell competitor superiority become manifest elder boy outstripp leave school worth while stay have little chance scholarship have walk course approach

136,"The carriage was sent for the Misses May, and at two o’clock they arrived. Flora, extremely anxious that Ethel should comport herself discreetly; and Ethel full of curiosity and eagerness, the only drawback her fears that her papa was doing what he disliked. She was not in the least shy, and did not think about her manner enough to be troubled by the consciousness that it had a good deal of abruptness and eagerness, and that her short sight made her awkward. Meta met them with outstretched hands and a face beaming with welcome. “I told you I should get my way!” she said triumphantly, and, after her warm greeting, she looked with some respect at the face of the Miss May who was so very clever. It certainly was not what she expected, not at all like either of the four sisters she had already seen--brown, sallow, and with that sharp long nose, and the eager eyes, and brow a little knit by the desire to see as far as she could. It was pleasanter to look at Flora.",carriage send o'clock arrive anxious comport full curiosity eagerness only drawback fear papa do dislike least shy think manner trouble consciousness have good deal abruptness eagerness short sight make awkward meet outstretched hand face beam welcome tell get way say warm greeting look respect face clever expect sister see brown sallow sharp long nose eager eye brow little knit desire see pleasanter look 
137,"Ethel left the talk chiefly to Flora--there was wonder and study enough for her in the grounds and garden, and when Mrs. Larpent tried to enter into conversation with her, she let it drop two or three times while she was peering hard at a picture and trying to make out its subject. However, when they all went out to walk to church, Ethel lighted up, and talked, admired, and asked questions in her quick, eager way, which interested Mrs. Larpent greatly. The governess asked after Norman, and no more was wanted to produce a volume of histories of his successes, till Flora turned as she walked before with Meta, saying, “Why, Ethel, you are quite overwhelming Mrs. Larpent.”",leave talk be wonder study grounds garden try enter conversation let drop time peer picture try make subject go walk church light talk admire ask question quick eager way interest governess ask more want produce volume history success turn walk say overwhelming 
138,"But some civil answer convinced Ethel that what she said was interesting, and she would not be stopped in her account of their anxieties on the day of the examination. Flora was pleased that Meta, catching some words, begged to hear more, and Flora gave an account of the matter, soberer in terms, but quietly setting Norman at a much greater distance from all his competitors.",civil answer convince say interesting stop account anxiety day examination pleased catching word begg hear more give account matter soberer term set great distance competitor 
139,"After church came the feast in the school. It was a large commodious building. Meta declared it was very tiresome that it was so good inside, it was so ugly, she should never rest till papa had built her a real beauty. They found Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wilmot in the school, with a very nice well-dressed set of boys and girls, and--But there is no need to describe the roast-beef and plum-pudding, “the feast ate merrily,”  and Ethel was brilliantly happy waiting on the children, and so was sunny-hearted Meta. Flora was too busy in determining what the Riverses might be thinking of her and her sister to give herself up to the enjoyment.",church come feast school large commodious building declare tiresome good ugly rest papa build real beauty find school nice dress set boy girl be need describe roast beef plum pudding feast eat happy wait child sunny hearted meta busy determine think sister give enjoyment 
140,"Ethel found a small boy looking ready to cry at an untouched slice of beef. She examined him whether he could cut it, and at last discovered that, as had been the case with one or two of her own brothers at the same age, meat was repugnant to him. In her vehement manner she flew off to fetch him some pudding, and hurrying up, as she thought, to Mr. Charles Wilmot, who had been giving it out, she thrust her plate between him and the dish, and had begun her explanation when she perceived it was a stranger, and she stood, utterly discomfited, not saying, “I beg your pardon,” but only blushing, awkward and confused, as he spoke to her, in a good-natured, hospitable manner, which showed her it must be Mr. Rivers. She obtained her pudding, and, turning hastily, retreated.",find small boy look ready cry untouched slice beef examine cut last discover case own brother same age meat repugnant vehement manner fly fetch pudding hurry think give thrust plate dish begin explanation perceive stranger stand discomfited say beg pardon blush awkward confused speak good natured hospitable manner show obtain pudding turn retreat

144,"Mr. Rivers was a great admirer of beauty, and Meta, brought up to be the same, was disappointed, but consoled herself by admiring Flora. Ethel, after the awkwardness was over, thought no more of the matter, but went on in full enjoyment of the feast. The eating finished, the making of presents commenced, and choice ones they were. The smiles of Meta and of the children were a pretty sight, and Ethel thought she had never seen anything so like a beneficent fairy. Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot said their words of counsel and encouragement, and, by five o’clock, all was over.",great admirer beauty bring same disappoint console admire awkwardness think more matter go full enjoyment feast eating finish making present commence choice one smile child pretty sight think see beneficent fairy say word counsel encouragement o'clock

147,"There was time for a walk round the grounds, Meta doing the honours to Flora, and Ethel walking with Mrs. Larpent. Both pairs were very good friends, and the two sisters admired and were charmed with the beauty of the gardens and conservatories--Ethel laying up a rich store of intelligence for Margaret; but still she was not entirely happy; her papa was more and more on her mind. He had looked dispirited at breakfast; he had a long hard day’s work before him, and she was increasingly uneasy at the thought that it would be a painful effort to him to join them in the evening. Her mind was full of it when she was conducted, with Flora, to the room where they were to dress; and when Flora began to express her delight, her answer was only that she hoped it was not very unpleasant to papa.",be time walk grounds do honour walk pair good friend sister admire charm beauty garden conservatory lay rich store intelligence happy papa more mind look dispirited breakfast have long hard day work uneasy thought painful effort join evening mind full conduct room dress begin express delight answer hope unpleasant papa

And then Flora pinched and pulled and arranged Ethel’s frock, in vain attempts to make it sit like her own--those sharp high bones resisted all attempts to disguise them. “Never mind, Flora, it is quite tidy, I am sure, there--do let me be in peace.

156,"“I’ll try,” said Ethel meekly, though a good deal tormented, as Flora went on with half a dozen more injunctions, closed by Meta’s coming to fetch them. Little Meta did not like to show them her own bedroom--she pitied them so much when she thought of the contrast. She would have liked to put Flora’s arm through her’s, but she thought, it would look neglectful of Ethel; so she only showed the way downstairs. Ethel forgot all her sister’s orders; for there stood her father, and she looked most earnestly at his face. It was cheerful, and his voice sounded well pleased as he greeted Meta; then resumed an animated talk with Mr. Rivers. Ethel drew as near him as she could; she had a sense of protection, and could open to full enjoyment when she saw him bright. At the first pause in the conversation, the gentlemen turned to the young ladies. Mr. Rivers began talking to Flora, and Dr. May, after a few pleasant words to Meta, went back to Ethel. He wanted her to see his favourite pictures--he led her up to them, made her put on his spectacles to see them better, and showed her their special merits. Mr. Rivers and the others joined them; Ethel said little, except a remark or two in answer to her papa, but she was very happy--she felt that he liked to have her with him; and Meta, too, was struck by the soundness of her few sayings, and the participation there seemed to be in all things between the father and daughter.",try say good deal torment go more injunction close come fetch little like show own bedroom pity think contrast like put arm think look neglectful show way forget sister order stand father look face cheerful voice sound pleased greet resume animated talk draw have sense protection open full enjoyment see bright first pause conversation gentleman turn young lady begin talk few pleasant word go want see favourite picture lead make put spectacle see good show special merit other join say little remark answer papa happy feel like have strike soundness few saying participation seem thing father daughter 
157,"At dinner Ethel went on pretty well. She was next to her father, and was very glad to find the dinner so grand, that no side-dish fell to her lot to be carved. There was a great deal of pleasant talk, such as the girls could understand, though they did not join much in it, except that now and then Dr. May turned to Ethel as a reference for names and dates. To make up for silence at dinner, there was a most confidential chatter in the drawing-room. Flora and Meta on one side, hand in hand, calling each other by their Christian names, Mrs. Larpent and Ethel on the other. Flora dreaded only that Ethel was talking too much, and revealing too much in how different style they lived. Then came the gentlemen, Dr. May begging Mr. Rivers to show Ethel one of his prints, when Ethel stooped more than ever, as if her eyelashes were feelers, but she was in transports of delight, and her embarrassment entirely at an end in her admiration, as she exclaimed and discussed with her papa, and by her hearty appreciation made Mr. Rivers for the time forget her plainness. Music followed; Flora played nicely, Meta like a well-taught girl; Ethel went on musing over the engravings. The carriage was announced, and so ended the day in Norman’s fairy-land. Ethel went home, leaning hard against her papa, talking to him of Raphael’s Madonnas; and looking out at the stars, and thinking how the heavenly beauty of those faces that, in the prints she had been turning over, seemed to be connected with the glories of the dark-blue sky and glowing stars. “As one star differeth from another star in glory,” murmured she; “that was the lesson to-day, papa;” and when she felt him press her hand, she knew he was thinking of that last time she had heard the lesson, when he had not been with her, and her thoughts went with his, though not another word was spoken.",dinner go father glad find dinner grand side dish fall lot carve be great deal pleasant talk such girl understand join much turn reference name date make silence dinner be confidential chatter draw room side hand hand call other christian name other dread talk reveal much different style live come gentleman begg show print stoop more eyelashe feeler transport delight embarrassment end admiration exclaim discuss papa hearty appreciation make time forget plainness music follow play teach girl go muse engraving carriage announce end day fairy land go lean papa talk look star think heavenly beauty face print turn seem connect glory dark blue sky glow star star differeth star glory murmure lesson day papa feel press hand know think last time hear lesson thought go word speak 
158,"Flora hardly knew when they ceased to talk. She had musings equally engrossing of her own. She saw she was likely to be very intimate with Meta Rivers, and she was roaming away into schemes for not letting the intercourse drop, and hopes of being admitted to many a pleasure as yet little within her reach--parties, balls, London, itself, and, above all, the satisfaction of being admired. The certainty that Mr. Rivers thought her pretty and agreeable had gratified her all the evening, and if he, with his refined taste, thought so, what would others think? Her only fear was, that Ethel’s awkwardness might make an unfavourable impression, but, at least, she said to herself, it was anything but vulgar awkwardness.",know cease talk have musing engrossing own see likely intimate roam scheme let intercourse drop hope admit many pleasure little reach party ball satisfaction admire certainty think pretty agreeable gratified evening refine taste think other think only fear awkwardness make unfavourable impression least say vulgar awkwardness 
159,"Their reflections were interrupted by the fly stopping. It was at a little shop in the outskirts of the town, and Dr. May, explained that he wanted to inquire for a patient. He went in for a moment, then came back to desire that they would go home, for he should be detained some little time. No one need sit up for him--he would let himself in.",reflection interrupt fly stop little shop outskirt town explain want inquire patient go moment come desire go detain little time sit let
