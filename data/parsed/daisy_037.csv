3,"     So, Lady Flora, take my lay,        And if you find a meaning there,      Oh! whisper to your glass, and say,        What wonder, if he thinks me fair.--Tennyson.",take lay find meaning whisper glass say wonder think fair 
4," Flora and Norman were dining with one of their county acquaintance, and Dr. May had undertaken to admit them on their return. The fire shone red and bright, as it sank calmly away, and the timepiece and clock on the stairs had begun their nightly duet of ticking, the crickets chirped in the kitchen, and the doctor sat alone. His book lay with unturned pages, as he sat musing, with eyes fixed on the fire, living over again his own life, the easy bright days of his youth, when, without much pains on his own part, the tendencies of his generous affectionate disposition, and the influences of a warm friendship, and an early attachment, had guarded him from evil--then the period when he had been perfectly happy, and the sobering power of his position had been gradually working on him; but though always religious and highly principled, the very goodness of his natural character preventing him from perceiving the need of self-control, until the shock that changed the whole tenor of his life, and left him, for the first time, sensible of his own responsibility, but with inveterate habits of heedlessness and hastiness that love alone gave him force to combat. He was now a far gentler man. His younger children had never seen, his elder had long since forgotten, his occasional bursts of temper, but he suffered keenly from their effects, especially as regarded some of his children. Though Richard’s timidity had been overcome, and Tom’s more serious failures had been remedied, he was not without anxiety, and had a strange unsatisfactory feeling as regarded Flora. He could not feel that he fathomed her! She reminded him of his old Scottish father-in-law, Professor Mackenzie, whom he had never understood, nor, if the truth were known, liked. Her dealings with the Ladies’ Committee were so like her grandfather’s canny ways in a public meeting, that he laughed over them--but they were not congenial to him. Flora was a most valuable person; all that she undertook prospered, and he depended entirely on her for household affairs, and for the care of Margaret; but, highly as he esteemed her, he was a little afraid of her cool prudence; she never seemed to be in any need of him, nor to place any confidence in him, and seemed altogether so much older and wiser than he could feel himself--pretty girl as she was--and very pretty were her fine blue eyes and clear skin, set off by her dark brown hair. There arose the vision of eyes as blue, skin as clear, but of light blonde locks, and shorter, rounder, more dove-like form, open, simple, loving face, and serene expression, that had gone straight to his heart, when he first saw Maggie Mackenzie making tea.",dine county acquaintance undertake admit return fire shine red bright sink timepiece clock stair begin nightly duet ticking cricket chirp kitchen doctor sit book lay unturned page sit muse eye fix fire live own life easy bright day youth much pain own part tendency generous affectionate disposition influence warm friendship early attachment guard evil period happy sobering power position work religious principled very goodness natural character prevent perceive need self control shock change whole tenor life leave first time sensible own responsibility inveterate habit heedlessness hastiness love give force combat gentler man young child see elder long forget occasional burst temper suffer effect regard child timidity overcome serious failure remedy anxiety have strange unsatisfactory feeling regard feel fathom remind old scottish father law understand truth know like dealing grandfather canny way public meeting laugh congenial valuable person undertake prosper depend household affair care esteem little afraid cool prudence seem need place confidence seem old wise feel girl fine blue eye clear skin set dark brown hair arise vision eye blue skin clear light blonde lock short rounder more dove like form open simple loving face serene expression go heart see make tea 
5,"He heard the wheels, and went out to unbolt the door. Those were a pair for a father to be proud of--Norman, of fine stature and noble looks, with his high brow, clear thoughtful eye, and grave intellectual eagle face, lighting into animation with his rare, sweet smile; and Flora, so tall and graceful, and in her white dress, picturesquely half concealed by her mantle, with flowers in her hair, and a deepened colour in her cheek, was a fair vision, as she came in from the darkness.",hear wheel go unbolt door pair father proud fine stature noble look high brow clear thoughtful eye grave intellectual eagle face light animation rare sweet smile tall graceful white dress half conceal mantle flower hair deepen colour cheek fair vision come darkness 
6,“Well! was it a pleasant party?”,pleasant party 
7,"Norman related the circumstances, while his sister remained silently leaning against the mantel-piece, looking into the fire, until he took up his candle, and bade them good-night. Dr. May was about to do the same, when she held out her hand. “One moment, if you please, dear papa,” she said; “I think you ought to know it.”",relate circumstance sister remain lean mantel piece look fire take candle bid good night about do same hold hand moment dear papa say think know

12,"“A better opportunity, eh?” said Dr. May, laughing; “well, I should have thought it awkward; was he very much discomposed?”",good opportunity say laugh think awkward discompose

14,"“Indeed! so you shifted the ungracious office to me. I am very glad to spare you, my dear; but it was hard on him to raise his hopes.”",shift ungracious office glad spare dear hard raise hope 
15,"“I thought,” faltered Flora, “that you could not disapprove--”",think falter disapprove 
16,"“Flora--” and he paused, completely confounded, while his daughter was no less surprised at the manner in which her news was received. Each waited for the other to speak, and Flora turned away, resting her head against the mantel-piece.",pause confound daughter surprise manner news receive wait other speak turn rest head mantel piece 
17,"“Surely,” said he, laying his hand on her shoulder, “you do not mean that you like this man?”",say lay hand shoulder mean like man 
18,"“I did not think that you would be against it,” said Flora, in a choked voice, her face still averted.",think say choke voice face avert 
19,"“Heaven knows, I would not be against anything for your happiness, my dear,” he answered; “but have you considered what it would be to spend your life with a man that has not three ideas! not a resource for occupying himself--a regular prey to ennui--one whom you could never respect!” He had grown more and more vehement, and Flora put her handkerchief to her eyes, for tears of actual disappointment were flowing.",heaven know happiness dear answer consider spend life man have idea resource occupy regular prey ennui respect grow more vehement put handkerchief eye tear actual disappointment flow

24,"Flora was disappointed. She had been too highly pleased at her conquest to make any clear estimation of the prize, individually considered. Her vanity magnified her achievement, and she had come home in a flutter of pleasure, at having had such a position in society offered to her, and expecting that her whole family would share her triumph. Gratified by George Rivers’s admiration, she regarded him with favour and complacency; and her habit of considering herself as the most sensible person in her sphere made her so regard his appreciation of her, that she was blinded to his inferiority. It must be allowed that he was less dull with her than with most others.",disappoint pleased conquest make clear estimation prize consider vanity magnify achievement come flutter pleasure have position society offer expect whole family share triumph gratify admiration regard favour complacency habit consider sensible person sphere make regard appreciation blind inferiority allow dull most other 
25,"And, in the midst of her glory, when she expected her father to be delighted and grateful--to be received as a silly girl, ready to accept any proposal, her lover spoken of with scorn, and the advantages of the match utterly passed over, was almost beyond endurance. A physician, with eleven children dependent on his practice, to despise an offer from the heir of such a fortune! But that was his customary romance! She forgave him, when it occurred to her that she was too important, and valuable, to be easily spared; and a tenderness thrilled through her, as she looked at the sleeping Margaret’s pale face, and thought of surrendering her and little Daisy to Ethel’s keeping. And what would become of the housekeeping? She decided, however, that feelings must not sway her--out of six sisters some must marry, for the good of the rest. Blanche and Daisy should come and stay with her, to be formed by the best society; and, as to poor dear Ethel, Mrs. Rivers would rule the Ladies’ Committee for her with a high hand, and, perhaps, provide Cocksmoor with a school at her sole expense. What a useful, admirable woman she would be! The doctor would be the person to come to his senses in the morning, when he remembered Abbotstoke, Mr. Rivers, and Meta.",midst glory expect father delighted grateful receive silly girl ready accept proposal lover speak scorn advantage match pass endurance physician child dependent practice despise offer heir fortune customary romance forgive occur important valuable spare tenderness thrill look sleeping pale face think surrender little keep become housekeeping decide feeling sway sister marry good rest come stay form good society poor dear rule high hand provide school sole expense useful admirable woman doctor person come sense morning remember 
26,"So Flora met her father, the next morning, with all her ordinary composure, in which he could not rival her, after his sleepless, anxious night. His looks of affectionate solicitude disconcerted what she had intended to say, and she waited, with downcast eyes, for him to begin.",meet father next morning ordinary composure rival sleepless anxious night look affectionate solicitude disconcert intend say wait downcast eye begin

33,“I am the last person to deny it; but where are these solid qualities? I cannot see the recommendation!”,last person deny solid quality see recommendation 
34,"“I place myself in your hands,” said Flora, in a submissive tone, which had the effect of making him lose patience.",place hand say submissive tone have effect make lose patience 
35,"“Flora, Flora! why will you talk as if I were sacrificing you to some dislike or prejudice of my own! Don’t you think I should only rejoice to have such a prosperous home offered to you, if only the man were worthy?”",talk sacrifice dislike prejudice own think rejoice have prosperous home offer man worthy 
36,"“If you do not think him so, of course there is an end of it,” said Flora, and her voice showed suppressed emotion.",think course be end say voice show suppress emotion 
37,"“It is not what I think, in the absence of proof, but what you think, Flora. What I want you to do is this--to consider the matter fairly. Compare him with--I’ll not say with Norman--but with Richard, Alan, Mr. Wilmot. Do you think you could rely on him--come to him for advice?”  (Flora never did come to any one for advice.) “Above all--do you think him likely to be a help, or a hindrance, in doing right?”",think absence proof think want do consider matter compare say think rely come advice come one advice think likely help hindrance do right 
38,"“I think you underrate him,” said Flora steadily; “but, of course, if you dislike it--though, I think, you would change your mind if you knew him better--”",think underrate say course dislike think change mind know good 
39,"“Well,” he said, as if to himself, “it is not always the most worthy;”  then continued, “I have no dislike to him. Perhaps I may find that you are right. Since your mind is made up, I will do this: first, we must be assured of his father’s consent, for they may very fairly object, since what I can give you is a mere nothing to them. Next, I shall find out what character he bears in his regiment, and watch him well myself; and, if nothing appear seriously amiss, I will not withhold my consent. But, Flora, you should still consider whether he shows such principle and right feeling as you can trust to.”",say worthy continue have dislike find right mind make do assure father consent object give mere find character bear regiment watch appear amiss withhold consent consider show such principle right feeling trust

42,“I will do as you please.”,do 
43,"Ethel perceived that something was in agitation, but the fact did not break upon her till she came to Margaret, after the schoolroom reading, and heard Dr. May declaiming away in the vehement manner that always relieved him.",perceive agitation fact break come schoolroom reading hear declaim vehement manner relieve 
44,"“Such a cub!” These were the words that met her ear; and she would have gone away, but he called her. “Come in, Ethel; Margaret says you guessed at this affair!”",cub word meet ear go call come say guess affair

50,"“Yes, she does! Very submissive, and proper spoken, of course, but bent on having him; so there is nothing left for me but to consent--provided Mr. Rivers does, and he should turn out not to have done anything outrageous; but there’s no hope of that--he has not the energy.

52,“Flora has more sense. What on earth can be the attraction?”,have more sense earth attraction 
53,"“I am afraid it is partly the grandeur--” said Ethel. She broke off short, quite dismayed at the emotion she had excited. Dr. May stepped towards her, almost as if he could have shaken her.",afraid grandeur say break short dismay emotion excite step shake 
54,"“Ethel,” he cried, “I won’t have such motives ascribed to your sister!”",cry have such motive ascribe sister 
55,"Ethel tried to recollect what she had said that was so shocking, for the idea of Flora’s worldly motives was no novelty to her. They had appeared in too many instances; and, though frightened at his anger, she stood still, without unsaying her words.",try recollect say shocking idea worldly motive novelty appear many instance frighten anger stand unsay word 
56,"Margaret began to explain away. “Ethel did not mean, dear papa--”",begin explain mean dear 
57,"“No,” said Dr. May, his passionate manner giving way to dejection. “The truth is, that I have made home so dreary, that my girls are ready to take the first means of escaping.”",say passionate manner give way dejection truth make home dreary girl ready take first means escape 
58,"Poor Margaret’s tears sprang forth, and, looking up imploringly, she exclaimed, “Oh, papa, papa! it was no want of happiness! I could not help it. You know he had come before--”",poor tear spring look exclaim want happiness help know come 
59,"Any reproach to her had been entirely remote from his thoughts, and he was at once on his knee beside her, soothing and caressing, begging her pardon, and recalling whatever she could thus have interpreted. Meanwhile, Ethel stood unnoticed and silent, making no outward protestation, but with lips compressed, as in her heart of hearts she passed the resolution--that her father should never feel this pain on her account. Leave him who might, she would never forsake him; nothing but the will of Heaven should part them. It might be hasty and venturesome. She knew not what it might cost her; but, where Ethel had treasured her resolve to work for Cocksmoor, there she also laid up her secret vow--that no earthly object should be placed between her and her father.",reproach remote thought knee soothing caress begg pardon recall interpret stand unnoticed silent make outward protestation lip compress heart heart pass resolution father feel pain account leave forsake will part hasty venturesome know cost treasure resolve work lay secret vow earthly object place father

61,“Where shall you see him?” Margaret asked.,see ask 
62,"“In my study, I suppose. I fear there is no chance of Flora’s changing her mind first. Or do you think one of you could talk to her, and get her fairly to contemplate the real bearings of the matter?” And, with these words, he left the room.",study suppose fear be chance change mind think talk get contemplate real bearing matter word leave room 
63,"Margaret and Ethel glanced at each other; and both felt the impenetrability of Flora’s nature, so smooth, that all thrusts glided off.",glance other feel impenetrability nature smooth thrust glide

65,“Pray try; a few of your forcible words would set it in a new light.”,pray try few forcible word set new light

67,"“Still, I don’t know whether it is not our duty,” said Margaret.",know duty say 
68,"“More yours than mine,” said Ethel.",more say 
69,"Margaret flushed up. “Oh, no, I cannot!” she said, always timid, and slightly defective in moral courage. She looked so nervous and shaken by the bare idea of a remonstrance with Flora, that Ethel could not press her; and, though convinced that her representation would be useless, she owned that her conscience would rest better after she had spoken. “But there is Flora, walking in the garden with Norman,” she said. “No doubt he is doing it.”",flush say timid defective moral courage look nervous shake bare idea remonstrance press convince representation useless own conscience rest good speak be walk garden say doubt do 
70,"So Ethel let it rest, and attended to the children’s lessons, during which Flora came into the drawing-room, and practised her music, as if nothing had happened.",let rest attend child lesson come draw room practise music happen 
71,"Before the morning was over, Ethel contrived to visit Norman in the dining-room, where he was wont to study, and asked him whether he had made any impression on Flora.",morning contrive visit dining room wont study ask make impression

80,"“We have all learned to think much too highly of talent,” said Norman gravely.",learn think talent say 
81,"“I don’t care for mere talent--people are generally more sensible without it; but, one way or other, there ought to be superiority on the man’s side.”",care mere talent person sensible way other be superiority man side

83,"“My dear Norman! Why, this George Rivers is really below the average! you cannot deny that! Did you ever meet any one so stupid?”",dear average deny meet one stupid 
84,"“Really!” said Norman, considering; and, speaking very innocently, “I cannot see why you think so. I do not see that he is at all less capable of sustaining a conversation than Richard.”",say consider speak see think see capable sustain conversation 
85,"Ethel sat down, perfectly breathless with amazement and indignation.",sit breathless amazement indignation 
86,"Norman saw that he had shocked her very much. “I do not mean,” he said, “that we have not much more to say to Richard; all I meant to say was, merely as to the intellect.”",see shock mean say have more say mean say intellect 
87,"“I tell you,” said Ethel, “it is not the intellect. Richard! why, you know how we respect, and look up to him. Dear old Ritchie! with his goodness, and earnestness, and right judgment--to compare him to that man! Norman, Norman, I never thought it of you!”",tell say intellect know respect look dear old goodness earnestness right judgment compare man think 
88,"“You do not understand me, Ethel. I only cited Richard, as a person who proves how little cleverness is needed to insure respect.”",understand cite person prove little cleverness need insure respect

90,“It is the only objection you have put forward.”,only objection put

92,"“Now, Ethel, you are working yourself up into a state of foolish prejudice. You and papa have taken a dislike to him; and you are overlooking a great deal of good safe sense and right thinking. I know his opinions are sound, and his motives right. He has been undereducated, we all see, and is not very brilliant or talkative; but I respect Flora for perceiving his solid qualities.”",work state foolish prejudice take dislike overlook great deal good safe sense right thinking know opinion sound motive right undereducated see brilliant talkative respect perceive solid quality

94,"“Ethel, you are allowing yourself to be carried, by prejudice, a great deal too far. Are such imputations to be made, wherever there is inequality of means? It is very wrong! very unjust!”",allow carry prejudice great deal such imputation make be inequality means wrong unjust 
95,"“So papa said,” replied Ethel, as she looked sorrowfully down. “He was very angry with me for saying so. I wish I could help feeling as if that were the temptation.”",say reply look angry say wish help feel temptation 
96,"“You ought,” said Norman. “You will be sorry, if you set yourself, and him, against it.”",say sorry set 
97,"“I only wish you to know what I feel; and, I think, Margaret and papa do,” said Ethel humbly; “and then you will not think us more unjust than we are. We cannot see anything so agreeable or suitable in this man as to account for Flora’s liking, and we do not feel convinced of his being good for much. That makes papa greatly averse to it, though he does not know any positive reason for refusing; and we cannot feel certain that she is doing quite right, or for her own happiness.”",wish know feel think do say think unjust see agreeable suitable man account like feel convinced good much make papa averse know positive reason refuse feel certain do right own happiness 
98,"“You will be convinced,” said Norman cheerfully. “You will find out the good that is under the surface when you have seen more of him. I have had a good deal of talk with him.”",convince say find good surface see more have good deal talk 
99,"A good deal of talk to him would have been more correct, if Norman had but been aware of it. He had been at the chief expense of the conversation with George Rivers, and had taken the sounds of assent, which he obtained, as evidences of his appreciation of all his views. Norman had been struggling so long against his old habit of looking down on Richard, and exalting intellect; and had seen, in his Oxford life, so many ill-effects of the knowledge that puffeth up, that he had come to have a certain respect for dullness, per se, of which George Rivers easily reaped the benefit, when surrounded by the halo, which everything at Abbotstoke Grange bore in the eyes of Norman.",good deal talk correct aware chief expense conversation take sound assent obtain evidence appreciation view struggle old habit look exalt intellect see life many ill effect knowledge puffeth come have certain respect dullness reap benefit surround halo bear eye 
100,"He was heartily delighted at the proposed connection, and his genuine satisfaction not only gratified Flora, and restored the equanimity that had been slightly disturbed by her father, but it also reassured Ethel and Margaret, who could not help trusting in his judgment, and began to hope that George might be all he thought him.",delighted propose connection genuine satisfaction gratified restore equanimity disturb father reassure help trust judgment begin hope think 
101,"Ethel, finding that there were two ways of viewing the gentleman, doubted whether she ought to express her opinion. It was Flora’s disposition, and the advantages of the match, that weighed most upon her, and, in spite of her surmise having been treated as so injurious, she could not rid herself of the burden.",find be way view gentleman doubt express opinion disposition advantage match weigh most spite surmise treat injurious rid burden 
102,"Dr. May was not so much consoled by Norman’s opinion as Ethel expected. The corners of his mouth curled up a little with diversion, and though he tried to express himself glad, and confident in his son’s judgment, there was the same sort of involuntary lurking misgiving with which he had accepted Sir Matthew Fleet’s view of Margaret’s case.",console opinion expect corner mouth curl little diversion try express glad confident son judgment be same sort involuntary lurking misgiving accept view case 
103,"There was no danger that Dr. May would not be kind and courteous to the young man himself. It was not his fault if he were a dunce, and Dr. May perceived that his love for Flora was real, though clumsily expressed. He explained that he could not sanction the engagement till he should be better informed of the young gentleman’s antecedents; this was, as George expressed it, a great nuisance, but his father agreed that it was quite right, in some doubt, perhaps, as to how Dr. May might be satisfied.",be danger kind courteous young man fault dunce perceive love real express explain sanction engagement inform young gentleman antecedent express great nuisance father agree right doubt satisfy
