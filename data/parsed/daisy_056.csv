3,"     Behold, with pearls they glittering stand,      Thy peaceful gates to all expand,      By grace and strength divinely shed,      Each mortal thither may be led;      Who, kindled by Christ’s love, will dare      All earthly sufferings now to bear.",pearl glitter stand peaceful gate expand grace strength shed mortal thither lead kindle love dare earthly suffering bear 
4,"     By many a salutary stroke,      By many a weary blow, that broke,      Or polished, with a workman’s skill,      The stones that form that glorious pile;      They all are fitly framed to lie      In their appointed place on high.

5," The thirtieth of November dawned with the grave brightness of an autumn day, as the sun slowly mounted from the golden east, drinking up the mists that rose tardily, leaving the grass thickly bedewed.",thirtieth dawn grave brightness autumn day sun mount golden east drink mist rise leave grass bedew 
6,"The bells of Stoneborough Minster were ringing gladsome peals, and the sunshine had newly touched the lime trees, whose last bright yellow leaves were gently floating down, as the carriage, from the Grange, drew up at Dr. May’s door.",bell ring gladsome peal sunshine touch lime tree last bright yellow leave float carriage draw door 
7,"Norman opened it, to claim Meta at once for the walk; Mrs. Arnott and Mary had gone on to assist Richard in his final arrangements, but even before Cocksmoor, with Ethel, was now the care of Margaret; and she had waited with her father to keep all bustle from her room, and to commit her into the charge of Flora and of nurse. Ethel seemed quite unwilling to go. There was that strange oppressed feeling on her as if the attainment of her wishes were joy too great to be real--as if she would fain hold off from it at the climax, and linger with the sister who had shared all with her, and to whom that church was even more than to herself. She came back, and back again, with fresh injunctions, sometimes forgetting the very purpose of her return, as if it had been only an excuse for looking at Margaret’s countenance, and drinking in her sympathy from her face; but she was to go in George’s carriage, and he was not a man to allow of loitering. He became so impatient of Ethel’s delays, that she perceived that he could bear them no longer, gave her final kiss, and whispered, “In spirit with us!” then ran down and was seized on by George, who had already packed in the children and Miss Bracy, and was whirled away.",open claim walk go assist final arrangement care wait father keep bustle room commit charge nurse seem unwilling go be strange oppress feeling attainment wish joy great real hold climax linger sister share church more come fresh injunction forget very purpose return excuse look countenance drink sympathy face go carriage man allow loitering become impatient delay perceive bear give final kiss whisper spirit run seize pack child whirl 
8,"“Flora dear,” said Margaret, “do you dislike having the window opened?”",dear say dislike have window open 
9,"Flora threw it up, protesting, in reply to her sister’s scruples, that she liked the air. “You always spoiled me,” said Margaret fondly. “Come and lie down by me. It is very nice to have you here,” she added, as Flora complied; and she took her hand and fondled it, “It is like the old times to have you here taking care of me.”",throw protest reply sister scruple like air spoiled say come lie nice have add complie take hand fondle old time have take care 
10,"“Very unlike them in some ways,” said Flora.",way say 
11,"“It has been a great renewal of still older times,” said Margaret, “to have Aunt Flora here. I hope you will get to know her, Flora, it is so like having mamma here,” and she looked in her sister’s face as she spoke.",great renewal old time say have hope get know have mamma look sister face speak 
12,"Flora did not reply, but she lay quite still, as if there were a charm in the perfect rest of being alone with Margaret, making no effort, and being able to be silent. Time passed on, how long they knew not, but, suddenly, a thrill shot through Margaret’s frame; she raised her hand and lifted her head, with an eager “Hark!”",reply lay be charm perfect rest alone make effort able silent time pass know thrill shot frame raise hand lift head eager 
13,Flora could hear nothing.,hear 
14,"“The bells--his bells!” said Margaret, all one radiant look of listening, as Flora opened the window further, and the breeze wafted in the chime, softened by distance. The carnation tinted those thin white cheeks, eyes and smile beamed with joy, and uplifted finger and parted lips seemed marking every note of the cadence.",bell bell say radiant look listening open window breeze waft chime soften distance carnation tint thin white cheek eye smile beam joy uplift finger part lip seem mark note cadence 
15,It ceased. “Alan! Alan!” said she. “It is enough! I am ready!”,cease say enough ready 
16,"The somewhat alarmed look on Flora’s face recalled her, and, smiling, she held out her hands for the consecration books, saying, “Let us follow the service. It will be best for us both.”",alarm look face recall smile hold hand consecration book say let follow service good 
17,"Slowly, softly, and rather monotonously, Flora read on, till she had come more than half through the first lesson. Her voice grew husky, and she sometimes paused as if she could not easily proceed. Margaret begged her to stop, but she would not cease, and went on reading, though almost whispering, till she came to, “If they return to Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the City which Thou hast chosen, and toward the House which I have built for Thy Name; then hearing from the Heavens, even from Thy dwelling-place--”",read come more half first lesson voice grow husky pause proceed begg stop cease go reading whisper come return heart soul land captivity carry captive pray land gavest father choose build hear dwelling place 
18,"Flora could go no further; she strove, but one of her tearless sobs cut her short. She turned her face aside, and, as Margaret began to say something tender, she exclaimed, with low, hasty utterance, “Margaret! Margaret! pray for me, for it is a hard captivity, and my heart is very, very sore. Oh! pray for me, that it may all be forgiven me--and that I may see my child again!”",go strive tearless sob cut short turn face begin say tender exclaim low hasty utterance pray hard captivity heart sore pray forgive see child 
19,"“My Flora; my own poor, dear Flora! do I not pray? Oh! look up, look up. Think how He loves you. If I love you so much, how much more does not He? Come near me, Flora. Be patient, and I know peace will come!”",own poor dear flora pray look look think love love more come patient know peace come 
20,"The words had burst from Flora uncontrollably. She was aware, the next instant, that she had given way to harmful agitation, and, resuming her quiescence, partly by her own will, partly from the soothing effect of Margaret’s words and tone, she allowed herself to be drawn close to her sister, and hid her face in the pillow, while Margaret’s hands were folded over her, and words of blessing and prayer were whispered with a fervency that made them broken.",word burst aware next instant give way harmful agitation resume quiescence own will soothing effect word tone allow draw close sister hide face pillow hand fold word blessing prayer whisper fervency make break 
21,"Ethel, meanwhile, stood between Aubrey and Gertrude, hardly able to believe it was not a dream, as she beheld the procession enter the aisle, and heard the psalm that called on those doors to lift up their heads for Him who should enter. There was an almost bewildered feeling--could it indeed be true, as she followed the earlier part of the service, which set apart that building as a temple for ever, separate from all common uses. She had imagined the scene so often that she could almost have supposed the present, one of her many imaginations; but, by and by, the strangeness passed off, and she was able to enter into, not merely to follow, the prayers, and to feel the deep thanksgiving that such had been the crown of her feeble efforts. Margaret was in her mind the whole time, woven, as it were, into every supplication and every note of praise; and when there came the intercession for those in sickness and suffering, flowing into the commemoration of those departed in faith and fear, Ethel’s spirit sank for a moment at the conviction that soon Margaret, like him, whom all must bear in mind on that day, might be included in that thanksgiving; yet, as the service proceeded, leaving more and more of earth behind, and the voices joined with angel and archangel, Ethel could lose the present grief, and only retain the certainty that, come what might, there was joy and union amid those who sung that hymn of praise. Never had Ethel been so happy--not in the sense of the finished work--no, she had lost all that, but in being more carried out of herself than ever she had been before, the free spirit of praise so bearing up her heart that the cry of glory came from her with such an exultant gladness, as might surely be reckoned as one of those foretastes of our everlasting life, not often vouchsafed even to the faithful, and usually sent to prepare strength for what may be in store.",stand able believe dream beheld procession enter aisle hear psalm call door lift head enter be bewilder feeling true follow early part service set building temple separate common use imagine scene suppose present many imagination strangeness pass able enter follow prayer feel deep thanksgiving such crown feeble effort mind whole time wove supplication note praise come intercession sickness suffering flow commemoration depart faith fear spirit sink moment conviction bear mind day include thanksgiving service proceed leave more more earth voice join angel archangel lose present grief retain certainty come be joy union sung hymn praise happy sense finish work lose carry free spirit praise bear heart cry glory come exultant gladness reckon foretast everlasting life vouchsafe faithful send prepare strength store 
22,"The blessing brought the sense of peace, which hung on her even while the sounds of movement began, and the congregation were emerging. As she came out, greetings, sentences of admiration of the church, and of inquiry for her absent sisters, were crowded upon her, as people moved towards the school, where a luncheon was provided for them, to pass away the interval until evening service. The half-dozen oldest Cocksmoorites were, meantime, to have a dinner in the former schoolroom, at the Elwoods’ house, and Ethel was anxious so see that all was right there; so, while the rest of her party were doing civil things, she gave her arm to Cherry, whose limping walk showed her to be very tired.",blessing bring sense peace hang sound movement begin congregation emerge come greeting sentence admiration church inquiry absent sister crowd person move school luncheon provide pass interval evening service half old have dinner former schoolroom house anxious see rest party do civil thing give arm limp walk show tired 
23,"“Oh, Miss Ethel!” said Cherry, “if Miss May could only have been here!”",say 
24,"“Her heart is,” said Ethel.",heart say

26,"“She has done more for the real good of Cocksmoor than any one else,”  said Ethel.",do more real good one else say 
27,"More might have been said, but they perceived that they were being overtaken by the body of clergy, who had been unrobing in the vestry. Ethel hastened to retreat within Mrs. Elwood’s wicket gate, but she was arrested by Richard, and found herself being presented to the bishop, and the bishop shaking hands with her, and saying that he had much wished to be introduced to her.",more say perceive overtake body clergy unrobe vestry hasten retreat wicket gate arrest find present bishop bishop shake hand say wish introduce 
28,"Of course, that was because she was her father’s daughter, and by way of something to say. She mentioned what was going on at the cottage, whereupon the bishop wished to go in and see the old people; and, entering, they found the very comfortable-looking party just sitting down to roast-beef and goose. John Taylor, in a new black coat, on account of his clerkship, presiding at one end, and Mr. Elwood at the other, and Dame Hall finding conversation for the whole assembly; while Blanche, Aubrey, Gertrude, the little Larkinses, and the Abbotstoke Wilmots were ready to act as waiters with infinite delight. Not a bit daunted by the bishop, who was much entertained by her merry manner, old granny told him “she had never seen nothing like it since the Jubilee, when the squire roasted an ox whole, and there wasn’t none of it fit to eat; and when her poor father got his head broken. Well, to be sure, who would have thought what would come of Sam’s bringing in the young gentleman and lady to see her the day her back was so bad!”",course father daughter way say mention go cottage bishop wish go see old person enter find comfortable look party sit roast beef goose new black coat account clerkship preside end other find conversation whole assembly little ready act waiter infinite delight bit daunt bishop entertain merry manner old granny tell see squire roast ox whole be fit eat poor father get head break sure think come bring young gentleman lady see day back bad 
29,"The bishop said grace, and left granny to the goose, while he gave Ethel his arm, which she would have thought an unaccountable proceeding if she had not recollected that Richard might be considered as host, and that she was his eldest sister forthcoming.",bishop say grace leave granny goose give arm think unaccountable proceeding recollect consider host old sister forthcoming 
30," No sooner, however, had they come beyond the wicket than she saw her father speaking to Will Adams, and there was that in the air of both which made it no surprise when Dr. May came up, saying, “Ethel, I must carry you away;” and, in explanation to the bishop, “my poor girl at home is not so well.”",come wicket see father speak be air make surprise come say carry explanation bishop poor girl home 
31,"All was inquiry and sympathy. Ethel was frantic to be at home, and would have rushed off at once, if Richard had not held her fast, asking what good she would do by hurrying in, breathless and exhausted, so as to add to Flora’s fright and distress, the anxiety which was most upon their minds, since she had never before witnessed one of the seizures, that were only too ordinary matters in the eyes of the home party. No one but Dr. May and Ethel should go. Richard undertook to tell the rest, and the gig making its appearance, Ethel felt that the peculiarly kind manner with which the bishop pressed her hand, and gave them all good wishes, was like a continuation of his blessing to aid her in her home scene of trial.",inquiry sympathy frantic home rush hold ask good do hurry breathless exhausted add fright distress anxiety most mind witness seizure ordinary matter eye home party go undertake tell rest gig make appearance feel kind manner bishop press hand give good wish continuation blessing aid home scene trial 
32,"Perhaps, it was well for her that her part in the consecration festivities should end here; at least so thought Mr. Wilmot, who, though very sorry for the cause, could not wish her to have been present at the luncheon. She had not thought of self hitherto, the church was the gift of Alan and Margaret, the work of preparing the people belonged to all alike, and she did not guess that, in the sight of others, she was not the nobody that she believed herself. Her share in the work at Cocksmoor was pretty well known, and Dr. Hoxton could not allow a public occasion to pass without speeches, such as must either have been very painful, or very hurtful to her. The absence of herself and her father, however, permitted a more free utterance to the general feeling; and things were said, that did indeed make the rest of the family extremely hot and uncomfortable, but which gave them extreme pleasure. Norman was obliged to spare Richard the answer, and said exactly what he ought, and so beautifully, that Meta could not find it in her heart to echo the fervent wish, which he whispered as he sat down, that speechifying could be abolished by Act of Parliament.",part consecration festivity end least think sorry cause wish present luncheon think self church gift work prepare person belong alike guess sight other believe share work know allow public occasion pass speech such painful hurtful absence father permit free utterance general feeling thing say make rest family hot uncomfortable give extreme pleasure oblige spare answer say find heart echo fervent wish whisper sit speechifying abolish 
33,"Mrs. Arnott began to perceive that her nephew was something to be proud of, and to understand how much was sacrificed, while George Rivers expressed his opinion to her that Norman would be a crack speaker in the House, and he hoped she would say everything to hinder his going out, for it was a regular shame to waste him on the niggers.",begin perceive nephew proud understand much sacrifice express opinion crack speaker hope say hinder go regular shame waste nigger 
34,"Owing to George having constituted himself her squire, Mrs. Arnott had not arrived at an understanding of the state of affairs at home; but, as soon as they rose up from luncheon, and she learned the truth from Richard and Mary, nothing would hinder her from walking home at once to see whether she could be useful. Mary was easily persuaded to remain, for she was accustomed to Margaret’s having these attacks, and had always been kept out of her room the while, so she had little uneasiness to prevent her from being very happy, in receiving in her own simple, good-humoured way all the attentions that lapsed upon her in the place of her elder sisters.",owe constitute squire arrive understanding state affair home rise luncheon learn truth hinder walk see useful persuade remain accustom have attack keep room while have little uneasiness prevent happy receive own simple good humoured way attention laps place elder sister 
35,"“Cocksmoor really has a church!” was note enough of joy for her, and no one could look at her round face without seeing perfect happiness. Moreover, when after evening service, the November mist turned into decided rain, she was as happy as a queen in her foresight, which had provided what seemed an unlimited supply of cloaks and umbrellas. She appeared to have an original genius for making the right people give a lift in their carriages to the distressed; and, regarding the Abbotstoke britska as her own, packed in Mrs. Anderson and Fanny, in addition to all their own little ones, Meta thrusting Miss Bracy into the demi-corner destined for herself at the last minute, and, remaining with Mary, the only ladies obliged to walk back to Stoneborough. So delighted were they “at the fun,” that it might have been thought the most charming of adventures, and they laughed all the more at the lack of umbrellas. They went to Mrs. Elwood’s, divested themselves of all possible finery, and tucked up the rest; Meta was rolled up from head to foot in a great old plaid shawl of Mrs. Elwood’s, and Mary had a cloak of Richard’s, the one took Norman’s arm, the other Dr. Spencer’s, and they trudged home through the darkness and the mud in the highest glee, quite sorry when the carriage met them half-way.",have church note joy look round face see perfect happiness evening service mist turn decide rain happy queen foresight provide seem unlimited supply cloak umbrella appear have original genius make right person give lift carriage distressed regard britska own pack addition own little one thrust demi-corner destine last minute remain only lady oblige walk delighted fun think charming adventure laugh more lack umbrella go divest possible finery tuck rest roll head foot great old plaid shawl have cloak one take arm other trudge darkness mud high glee sorry carriage meet half way 
36,"It was the last mirth that they enjoyed for many weeks. When they reached home, a sense of self-reproach for their glee thrilled over them, when they found a sort of hush pervading the drawing-room, and saw the faces of awe and consternation, worn by Blanche and George Rivers.",last mirth enjoy many week reach home sense self reproach glee thrill find sort hush pervade draw room see face awe consternation wear 
37,"“It was a much worse attack than usual, and it did not go off,” was all that Blanche knew, but her father had desired to be told when Dr. Spencer came home, and she went up with the tidings.",bad attack usual go know father desire tell come go tiding 
38,"This brought Flora down, looking dreadfully pale, and with her voice sunk away as it had been when she lost her child. Her husband started up, exclaiming at her aspect; she let him support her to the sofa, and gave the few particulars. Margaret had been as placid and comfortable as usual, till nurse came to dress her, but the first move had brought on the faintness and loss of breath. It did not yield to remedies, and she had neither looked nor spoken since, only moaned. Flora thought her father much alarmed; and then, after an interval, she began to entreat that they might stay there, sending Miss Bracy and the children to the Grange to make room.",bring look pale voice sink lose child husband start exclaim aspect let support sofa give few particular placid comfortable usual nurse come dress first move bring faintness loss breath yield remedy look speak moan think father alarm interval begin entreat stay send child make room 
39,"Meantime, Dr. Spencer had come to the sick-room, but he could only suggest remedies that were already in course of application to the insensible sufferer. Mrs. Arnott and Ethel were watching, and trying everything to relieve her, but with little effect, and Ethel presently stood by the fire with her father, as Dr. Spencer turned towards him, and he said, in a very low, but calm voice, “It won’t do--I believe it is the death-stroke.”",come sick room suggest remedy course application insensible sufferer watch try relieve little effect stand fire father turn say low calm voice do believe death stroke 
40,"“Not immediate,” said Dr. Spencer.",immediate say 
41,"“No,” said Dr. May; and he quietly spoke of what the disease had effected, and what yet remained for it to do, ere the silver bowl should be broken.",say speak disease effect remain do silver bowl break 
42,Dr. Spencer put in a word of agreement.,put word agreement 
43,"“Will there be no rally?” said Ethel, in the same tone.",be rally say same tone 
44,"“Probably not,” said Dr. May; “the brain is generally reached at this stage. I have seen it coming for a long time. The thing was done seven years ago. There was a rally for a time when youth was strong; but suspense and sorrow accelerated what began from the injury to the spine.”",say brain reach stage see come long time thing do year be rally time youth strong suspense sorrow accelerate begin injury spine 
45,"Dr. Spencer bowed his head, and looked at him anxiously, saying, “I do not think there will be much acute suffering.”",bow head look say think be much acute suffering 
46,"“I fear it may be as trying,” said Dr. May, sighing; and then turning to Ethel, and throwing his arm round her, “May God make it easy to her, and grant us ‘patient hearts.’ We will not grudge her to all that she loves best, my Ethel.”",fear try say sigh turn throw arm make easy grant patient heart grudge love good 
47,"Ethel clung to him, as if to derive strength from him. But the strength that was in them then did not come from earth. Dr. Spencer wrung his hand, and stepped back to the bed to try another resource. Vain again, they only seemed to be tormenting her, and the silent helplessness prevailed again. Then Dr. May went down to Flora, told her the true state of the case, and urged on her to give up her plan of remaining. George joined with him, and she yielded submissively, but would not be refused going up once again and kissing her sister, standing beside her gazing at her, till her father came softly and drew her away. “I shall be here to-morrow,” she said to Ethel, and went.",cling derive strength strength come earth wrung hand step bed try resource vain seem torment silent helplessness prevail go tell true state case urge give plan remain join yield refuse go kiss sister stand gaze father come draw say go 
48,"The morrow, however, brought no Flora. The agitation and distress of that day had broken her down completely, and she was so ill as to be unable to move. Her aunt went at once to see her, and finding that her presence at the Grange relieved some of Dr. May’s anxieties, chiefly devoted herself to her. Flora was grateful and gentle, but as silent and impenetrable as ever, while day after day she lay on her couch, uncomplaining and undemonstrative, visited by her father, and watched over by her aunt and sister-in-law, who began to know each other much better, though Flora less than ever, in that deep fixed grief. She only roused herself to return her husband’s affection, or to listen to the daily reports of Margaret. Poor George, he was very forlorn, though Meta did her best to wait on him, and he rode over twice a day to inquire at Stoneborough.",bring agitation distress day break ill unable move aunt go see find presence relieve anxiety devote grateful gentle silent impenetrable day day lay couch uncomplaining undemonstrative visit father watch aunt sister law begin know other good less deep fix grief rouse return husband affection listen daily report poor forlorn do good wait ride day inquire 
49,"The doctors were right, and the consecration morning was her last of full consciousness. From the hour when she had heard the sound of Alan’s bells, her ears were closed to earthly sounds. There was very little power of intercourse with her, as she lingered on the borders of the land very far away, where skill and tenderness could not either reach body or spirit. Often the watchers could not tell whether she was conscious, or only incapacitated from expression, by the fearful weight on her breath, which caused a restlessness most piteous in the exhausted helpless frame, wasted till the softest touch was anguish. Now and then came precious gleams when a familiar voice, or some momentary alleviation would gain a smile, or thanks, and they thought her less restless when Richard read prayers beside her, but words were very rare, only now and then a name, and when in most distress, “it will be soon over,” “it will soon be over,” occurred so often, that they began to think it once her solace, and now repeated habitually without a meaning.",doctor right consecration morning last full consciousness hour hear sound bell ear close earthly sound be little power intercourse linger border land skill tenderness reach body spirit watcher tell conscious incapacitate expression fearful weight breath cause restlessness piteous exhaust helpless frame waste softest touch anguish come precious gleam familiar voice momentary alleviation gain smile thanks think restless read prayer word rare name most distress occur begin think solace repeat meaning 
50,"They could not follow her into the valley of the shadow of death, but could only watch the frail earthly prison-house being broken down, as if the doom of sin must be borne, though faith could trust that it was but her full share in the Cross. Calmly did those days pass. Ethel, Richard, and Mary divided between them the watching and the household cares, and their father bore up bravely in the fullness of his love and faith, resigning her daughter to the Hands which were bearing her whither her joys had long since departed.",follow valley shadow death watch frail earthly prison house break doom sin borne faith trust full share do day pass divide watch household care father bear fullness love faith resign daughter hand bear joy depart 
51,"Hector Ernescliffe arrived when the holidays began; and his agony of sorrow, when she failed to recognise him, moved Dr. May to exert himself earnestly for his consolation; and, at the same time, Tom, in a gentle, almost humble manner, paid a sort of daughter-like attention to the smallest services for his father, as if already accepting him as his especial charge.",arrive holiday begin agony sorrow fail recognise move exert consolation same time gentle humble manner pay sort daughter attention small service father accept especial charge 
52,"It was midnight, on the longest night of the year; Ethel was lying on her bed, and had fallen into a brief slumber, when her father’s low, clear voice summoned her: “Ethel, she is going!”",midnight long night year lie bed fall brief slumber father low clear voice summon go

55,"He threw himself on his knees beside her, but she looked beyond him, “Mamma! Alan! oh, there they are! More! more!” and, as though the unspeakable dawned on her, she gasped for utterance, then looked, with a consoling smile, on her father. “Over now!” she said--and the last struggle was ended. That which Richard laid down was no longer Margaret May.",throw knee look more more unspeakable dawn gasp utterance look consol smile father say last struggle end lay 
56,"Over now! The twenty-five years’ life, the seven years’ captivity on her couch, the anxious headship of the motherless household, the hopeless betrothal, the long suspense, the efforts for resignation, the widowed affections, the slow decay, the tardy, painful death agony--all was over; nothing left, save what they had rendered the undying spirit, and the impress her example had left on those around her.",year life year captivity couch anxious headship motherless household hopeless betrothal long suspense effort resignation widow affection slow decay tardy painful death agony leave save render undy spirit impress example leave 
57,"The long continuance of the last suffering had softened the actual parting; and it was with thankfulness for the cessation of her pain that they turned away, and bade each other good-night.",long continuance last suffering soften actual parting thankfulness cessation pain turn bid other good night 
58,"Ethel would not have believed that her first wakening to the knowledge that Margaret was gone could have been more fraught with relief than with misery. And, for her father, it seemed as if it were a home-like, comfortable thought to him, that her mother had one of her children with her. He called her the first link of his Daisy Chain drawn up out of sight; and, during the quiet days that ensued, he seemed as it were to be lifted above grief, dwelling upon hope. His calmness impressed the same on his children, as they moved about in the solemn stillness of the house; and when Harry, pale, and shocked at the blow to him so sudden, came home, the grave silence soothed his violence of grief; and he sat beside his, father or Mary, speaking in undertones of what Margaret had loved to hear from him, of Alan Ernescliffe’s last moments.",believe first wakening knowledge gone fraught relief misery father seem home comfortable think mother have child call first link draw sight quiet day ensue seem lift grief dwelling hope calmness impress same child move solemn stillness house pale shock blow come grave silence sooth violence grief sit father speak undertone love hear last moment

60,"The dog Toby had followed him, unseen, to the cloister; and he was entering the garden, when he was struck by seeing the animal bounding, in irrepressible ecstasy, round a lad, whose tarpaulin hat, blue-bordered collar, and dark blue dress, showed him to be a sailor, as well as the broad-shouldered, grizzled, elderly man, who stood beside him.",dog follow unseen cloister enter garden strike see animal bound irrepressible ecstasy lad tarpaulin hat blue border collar dark blue dress show sailor broad shouldered grizzled elderly man stand

65,"Jennings had heard from one of the crew of the Bucephalus that Mr. May had been met, on his return to Portsmouth, by the news of his sister’s death. The Mays had helped his boy; he had been with Mr. May in the island; he had laid Mr. Ernescliffe in his grave; and some notion had crossed the sailor that he must be at Miss Margaret’s funeral--it might be they would let him lend a hand--and, in this expedition, he was spending his time on shore.",hear crew meet return news sister death help boy island lay grave notion cross sailor funeral let lend hand expedition spend time shore 
66,"How he was welcomed need not be told, nor how the tears came forth from full hearts, as Dr. May granted his wish, and thanked him for doing what Margaret herself would indeed have chosen; and, in his blue sailor garb, was Jennings added to the bearers, their own men, and two Cocksmoor labourers, who, early on Christmas Eve, carried her to the minster. Last time she had been there, Alan Ernescliffe had supported her. Now, what was mortal of him lay beneath the palm tree, beneath the glowing summer sky, while the first snow-flakes hung like pearls on her pall. But as they laid her by her mother’s side, who could doubt that they were together?",welcome tell tear come full heart grant wish thank do choose blue sailor garb add bearer own man labourer carry minster last time support mortal lay palm tree glow summer sky first snow flake hang pearl pall lay mother side doubt
