2,"It was the day I was promoted to a tooth-brush. The girls, irrespective of age, had been thus distinguished some time before; why, we boys could never rightly understand, except that it was part and parcel of a system of studied favouritism on behalf of creatures both physically inferior and (as was shown by a fondness for tale-bearing) of weaker mental fibre. It was not that we yearned after these strange instruments in themselves; Edward, indeed, applied his to the scrubbing-out of his squirrel’s cage, and for personal use, when a superior eye was grim on him, borrowed Harold’s or mine, indifferently; but the nimbus of distinction that clung to them--that we coveted exceedingly. What more, indeed, was there to ascend to, before the remote, but still possible, razor and strop?",day promote tooth brush girl irrespective age distinguish time boy understand part parcel system study favouritism behalf creature inferior show fondness tale bear weak mental fibre yearn strange instrument apply scrubbing squirrel cage personal use superior eye grim borrow nimbus distinction cling covete more ascend remote possible razor strop 
3,"Perhaps the exaltation had mounted to my head; or nature and the perfect morning joined to him at disaffection; anyhow, having breakfasted, and triumphantly repeated the collect I had broken down in the last Sunday--‘twas one without rhythm or alliteration: a most objectionable collect--having achieved thus much, the small natural man in me rebelled, and I vowed, as I straddled and spat about the stable-yard in feeble imitation of the coachman, that lessons might go to the Inventor of them. It was only geography that morning, any way: and the practical thing was worth any quantity of bookish theoretic; as for me, I was going on my travels, and imports and exports, populations and capitals, might very well wait while I explored the breathing, coloured world outside.",exaltation mount head nature perfect morning join disaffection breakfast repeat collect break last rhythm alliteration objectionable collect achieve much small natural man rebell vow straddle spat stable yard feeble imitation coachman lesson go inventor geography morning way practical thing worth quantity bookish theoretic go travel import export population capital wait explore breathing coloured world 
4,"True, a fellow-rebel was wanted; and Harold might, as a rule, have been counted on with certainty. But just then Harold was very proud. The week before he had “gone into tables,” and had been endowed with a new slate, having a miniature sponge attached, wherewith we washed the faces of Charlotte’s dolls, thereby producing an unhealthy pallor which struck terror into the child’s heart, always timorous regarding epidemic visitations. As to “tables,” nobody knew exactly what they were, least of all Harold; but it was a step over the heads of the rest, and therefore a subject for self-adulation and--generally speaking--airs; so that Harold, hugging his slate and his chains, was out of the question now. In such a matter, girls were worse than useless, as wanting the necessary tenacity of will and contempt for self-constituted authority. So eventually I slipped through the hedge a solitary protestant, and issued forth on the lane what time the rest of the civilised world was sitting down to lessons.",true fellow rebel want rule count certainty proud week go table endow new slate have miniature sponge attach wash face doll produce unhealthy pallor strike terror child heart timorous regard epidemic visitation table know least step head rest subject self adulation speak air hug slate chain question matter girl bad useless want necessary tenacity will contempt self constitute authority slip hedge solitary protestant issue lane time rest civilised world sit lesson 
5,"The scene was familiar enough; and yet, this morning, how different it all seemed! The act, with its daring, tinted everything with new, strange hues; affecting the individual with a sort of bruised feeling just below the pit of the stomach, that was intensified whenever his thoughts flew back to the ink-stained, smelly schoolroom. And could this be really me? or was I only contemplating, from the schoolroom aforesaid, some other jolly young mutineer, faring forth under the genial sun? Anyhow, here was the friendly well, in its old place, half way up the lane. Hither the yoke-shouldering village-folk were wont to come to fill their clinking buckets; when the drippings made worms of wet in the thick dust of the road. They had flat wooden crosses inside each pail, which floated on the top and (we were instructed) served to prevent the water from slopping over. We used to wonder by what magic this strange principle worked, and who first invented the crosses, and whether he got a peerage for it. But indeed the well was a centre of mystery, for a hornet’s nest was somewhere hard by, and the very thought was fearsome. Wasps we knew well and disdained, storming them in their fastnesses. But these great Beasts, vestured in angry orange, three stings from which--so ‘t was averred--would kill a horse, these were of a different kidney, and their warning drone suggested prudence and retreat. At this time neither villagers nor hornets encroached on the stillness: lessons, apparently, pervaded all Nature. So, after dabbling awhile in the well--what boy has ever passed a bit of water without messing in it?--I scrambled through the hedge, avoiding the hornet-haunted side, and struck into the silence of the copse.",scene familiar morning different seem act dare tint new strange hue affect individual sort bruise feeling pit stomach intensify thought fly ink stain smelly schoolroom contemplate schoolroom aforesa other jolly young mutineer fare genial sun friendly old place half lane yoke shoulder village folk wont come fill clinking bucket dripping make worm wet thick dust road have flat wooden cross pail float top instruct serve prevent water slop use wonder magic strange principle work invent cross get peerage centre mystery hornet nest hard very thought fearsome wasp know disdain storm fastness great beast vesture angry orange sting averr kill horse different kidney warning drone suggest prudence retreat time villager hornet encroach stillness lesson pervade dabble boy pass bit water mess scramble hedge avoid hornet haunt side strike silence copse 
6,"If the lane had been deserted, this was loneliness become personal. Here mystery lurked and peeped; here brambles caught and held with a purpose of their own, and saplings whipped the face with human spite. The copse, too, proved vaster in extent, more direfully drawn out, than one would ever have guessed from its frontage on the lane: and I was really glad when at last the wood opened and sloped down to a streamlet brawling forth into the sunlight. By this cheery companion I wandered along, conscious of little but that Nature, in providing store of water-rats, had thoughtfully furnished provender of right-sized stones. Rapids, also, there were, telling of canoes and portages--crinkling bays and inlets--caves for pirates and hidden treasures--the wise Dame had forgotten nothing--till at last, after what lapse of time I know not, my further course, though not the stream’s, was barred by some six feet of stout wire netting, stretched from side to side, just where a thick hedge, arching till it touched, forbade all further view.",lane desert loneliness become personal mystery lurk peep bramble catch hold purpose own sapling whip face human spite copse prove vaster extent draw guess frontage lane glad last wood open slope streamlet brawl sunlight cheery companion wander conscious little provide store water rat have furnish provender right size stone be telling canoe portage crinkling bay inlet cave pirate hide treasure wise forget last lapse time know further course stream barr foot stout wire netting stretch side side thick hedge arching touch forbid further view 
7,"The excitement of the thing was becoming thrilling. A Black Flag must surely be fluttering close by. Here was evidently a malignant contrivance of the Pirates, designed to baffle our gun-boats when we dashed up-stream to shell them from their lair. A gun-boat, indeed, might well have hesitated, so stout was the netting, so close the hedge: but I spied where a rabbit was wont to pass, close down by the water’s edge; where a rabbit could go a boy could follow, albeit stomach-wise and with one leg in the stream; so the passage was achieved, and I stood inside, safe but breathless at the sight.",excitement thing become thrilling black flutter malignant contrivance design baffle gun boat dash stream shell lair gun boat hesitate stout netting close hedge spy rabbit pass close water edge rabbit go boy follow stomach wise leg stream passage achieve stand safe breathless sight 
8,"Gone was the brambled waste, gone the flickering tangle of woodland. Instead, terrace after terrace of shaven sward, stone-edged, urn-cornered, stepped delicately down to where the stream, now tamed and educated, passed from one to another marble basin, in which on occasion gleams of red hinted at gold-fish in among the spreading water-lilies. The scene lay silent and slumbrous in the brooding noonday sun: the drowsing peacock squatted humped on the lawn, no fish leapt in the pools, nor bird declared himself from the environing hedges. Self-confessed it was here, then, at last the Garden of Sleep!",go brambled waste go flicker tangle woodland terrace terrace shaven sward stone edged urn -corner step stream tame educate pass marble basin occasion gleam red hint gold fish spread water lilie scene lay silent slumbrous brood noonday sun drowsing peacock squatet hump lawn fish leapt pool bird declare environ hedge self confess last 
9,"Two things, in those old days, I held in especial distrust: gamekeepers and gardeners. Seeing, however, no baleful apparitions of either nature, I pursued my way between rich flower-beds, in search of the necessary Princess. Conditions declared her presence patently as trumpets; without this centre such surroundings could not exist. A pavilion, gold topped, wreathed with lush jessamine, beckoned with a special significance over close-set shrubs. There, if anywhere, She should be enshrined. Instinct, and some knowledge of the habits of princesses, triumphed; for (indeed) there She was! In no tranced repose, however, but laughingly, struggling to disengage her hand from the grasp of a grown-up man who occupied the marble bench with her. (As to age, I suppose now that the two swung in respective scales that pivoted on twenty. But children heed no minor distinctions; to them, the inhabited world is composed of the two main divisions: children and upgrown people; the latter being in no way superior to the former--only hopelessly different. These two, then, belonged to the grown-up section.) I paused, thinking it strange they should prefer seclusion when there were fish to be caught, and butterflies to hunt in the sun outside; and as I cogitated thus, the grown-up man caught sight of me.",thing old day hold especial distrust gamekeeper gardener see baleful apparition nature pursue way rich flower bed search necessary condition declare presence trumpet centre such surroundings exist pavilion gold top wreathe lush jessamine beckon special significance close set shrub enshrine instinct knowledge habit princess triumph tranced repose struggle disengage hand grasp grow man occupy marble bench age suppose swing respective scale pivote child heed minor distinction inhabit world compose main division child upgrown person latter way superior former different belong grow section pause think strange prefer seclusion be fish catch butterfly hunt sun cogitate grow man catch sight

13,"“I think she is lovely,” I said (and doubtless I was right, having never learned to flatter). “But she’s wide-awake, so I suppose somebody has kissed her!”",think lovely say right learn flatter wide awake suppose kiss 
14,"This very natural deduction moved the grown-up man to laughter; but the Princess, turning red and jumping up, declared that it was time for lunch.",natural deduction move grow man laughter turn red jump declare time lunch 
15,"“Come along, then,” said the grown-up man; “and you too, Water-baby; come and have something solid. You must want it.”",come say grow man water baby come have solid want 
16,"I accompanied them, without any feeling of false delicacy. The world, as known to me, was spread with food each several mid-day, and the particular table one sat at seemed a matter of no importance. The palace was very sumptuous and beautiful, just what a palace ought to be; and we were met by a stately lady, rather more grownup than the Princess--apparently her mother.",accompany feeling false delicacy world know spread food several mid-day particular table one sit seem matter importance palace sumptuous beautiful palace meet stately lady more grownup mother 
17,"My friend the Man was very kind, and introduced me as the Captain, saying I had just run down from Aldershot. I didn’t know where Aldershot was, but had no manner of doubt that he was perfectly right. As a rule, indeed, grown-up people are fairly correct on matters of fact; it is in the higher gift of imagination that they are so sadly to seek.",friend kind introduce say run know have manner doubt right rule grow person correct matter fact high gift imagination seek 
18,"The lunch was excellent and varied. Another gentleman in beautiful clothes--a lord, presumably--lifted me into a high carved chair, and stood behind it, brooding over me like a Providence. I endeavoured to explain who I was and where I had come from, and to impress the company with my own tooth-brush and Harold’s tables; but either they were stupid--or is it a characteristic of Fairyland that every one laughs at the most ordinary remarks? My friend the Man said good-naturedly, “All right, Water-baby; you came up the stream, and that’s good enough for us.” The lord--a reserved sort of man, I thought--took no share in the conversation.",lunch excellent varied gentleman beautiful clothes lord lift high carve chair stand brood endeavour explain come impress company own tooth brush table stupid characteristic one laugh ordinary remark friend say good right water baby come stream good lord reserve sort man think take share conversation 
19,"After lunch I walked on the terrace with the Princess and my friend the Man, and was very proud. And I told him what I was going to be, and he told me what he was going to be; and then I remarked, “I suppose you two are going to get married?” He only laughed, after the Fairy fashion. “Because if you aren’t,” I added, “you really ought to”: meaning only that a man who discovered a Princess, living in the right sort of Palace like this, and didn’t marry her there and then, was false to all recognised tradition.",lunch walk terrace friend proud tell go tell go remark suppose go get married laugh fashion add mean man discover live right sort marry false recognise tradition 
20,"They laughed again, and my friend suggested I should go down to the pond and look at the gold-fish, while they went for a stroll.",laugh friend suggest go pond look gold fish go stroll 
21,"I was sleepy, and assented; but before they left me, the grown-up man put two half-crowns in my hand, for the purpose, he explained, of treating the other water-babies. I was so touched by this crowning mark of friendship that I nearly cried; and thought much more of his generosity than of the fact that the Princess; ere she moved away, stooped down and kissed me.",sleepy assent leave grow man put half crown hand purpose explain treat other water baby touch crowning mark friendship cry think more generosity fact move stoop kiss 
22,"I watched them disappear down the path--how naturally arms seem to go round waists in Fairyland!--and then, my cheek on the cool marble, lulled by the trickle of water, I slipped into dreamland out of real and magic world alike. When I woke, the sun had gone in, a chill wind set all the leaves a-whispering, and the peacock on the lawn was harshly calling up the rain. A wild unreasoning panic possessed me, and I sped out of the garden like a guilty thing, wriggled through the rabbit-run, and threaded my doubtful way homewards, hounded by nameless terrors. The half-crowns happily remained solid and real to the touch; but could I hope to bear such treasure safely through the brigand-haunted wood? It was a dirty, weary little object that entered its home, at nightfall, by the unassuming aid of the scullery-window: and only to be sent tealess to bed seemed infinite mercy to him. Officially tealess, that is; for, as was usual after such escapades, a sympathetic housemaid, coming delicately by backstairs, stayed him with chunks of cold pudding and condolence, till his small skin was tight as any drum. Then, nature asserting herself, I passed into the comforting kingdom of sleep, where, a golden carp of fattest build, I oared it in translucent waters with a new half-crown snug under right fin and left; and thrust up a nose through water-lily leaves to be kissed by a rose-flushed Princess.",watch disappear path arm seem go round waist cheek cool marble lull trickle water slip dreamland real magic world alike wake sun go chill wind set leave whispering peacock lawn call rain wild unreasoning panic possess spe garden guilty thing wriggle rabbit run thread doubtful way homeward hound nameless terror half crown remain solid real touch hope bear such treasure brigand haunt wood dirty weary little object enter home nightfall unassuming aid scullery window send tealess bed seem infinite mercy tealess usual such escapade sympathetic housemaid come backstair stay chunk cold pudding condolence small skin tight drum nature assert pass comforting kingdom sleep golden carp fattest build oare translucent water new half crown snug right fin left thrust nose water lily leave kiss rose flush
