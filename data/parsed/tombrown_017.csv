3,"The curtain now rises upon the last act of our little drama, for hard-hearted publishers warn me that a single volume must of necessity have an end. Well, well! the pleasantest things must come to an end. I little thought last long vacation, when I began these pages to help while away some spare time at a watering-place, how vividly many an old scene which had lain hid away for years in some dusty old corner of my brain, would come back again, and stand before me as clear and bright as if it had happened yesterday. The book has been a most grateful task to me, and I only hope that all you, my dear young friends, who read it (friends assuredly you must be, if you get as far as this), will be half as sorry to come to the last stage as I am.",curtain rise last act little drama hard hearted publisher warn single volume necessity have end pleasantest thing come end little think last long vacation begin page help spare time water place many old scene lain hide year dusty old corner brain come stand clear bright happen yesterday book grateful task hope dear young friend read friend get half sorry come last stage 
4,"Not but what there has been a solemn and a sad side to it. As the old scenes became living, and the actors in them became living too, many a grave in the Crimea and distant India, as well as in the quiet churchyards of our dear old country, seemed to open and send forth their dead, and their voices and looks and ways were again in one’s ears and eyes, as in the old School-days. But this was not sad. How should it be, if we believe as our Lord has taught us? How should it be, when one more turn of the wheel, and we shall be by their sides again, learning from them again, perhaps, as we did when we were new boys.",be solemn sad side old scene become live actor become live many grave distant quiet churchyard dear old country seem open send dead voice look way ear eye old school day sad believe teach more turn wheel side learn do new boy 
5,"Then there were others of the old faces so dear to us once who had somehow or another just gone clean out of sight. Are they dead or living? We know not, but the thought of them brings no sadness with it. Wherever they are, we can well believe they are doing God’s work and getting His wages.",be other old face dear have go clean sight dead live know thought bring sadness believe do work get wage 
6,"But are there not some, whom we still see sometimes in the streets, whose haunts and homes we know, whom we could probably find almost any day in the week if we were set to do it, yet from whom we are really farther than we are from the dead, and from those who have gone out of our ken? Yes, there are and must be such; and therein lies the sadness of old School memories. Yet of these our old comrades, from whom more than time and space separate us, there are some by whose sides we can feel sure that we shall stand again when time shall be no more. We may think of one another now as dangerous fanatics or narrow bigots, with whom no truce is possible, from whom we shall only sever more and more to the end of our lives, whom it would be our respective duties to imprison or hang, if we had the power. We must go our way, and they theirs, as long as flesh and spirit hold together; but let our own Rugby poet speak words of healing for this trial:--",be see street haunt home know find day week set do far dead go be such lie sadness old school memory old comrade more time space separate be side feel sure stand time more think dangerous fanatics narrow bigot truce possible sever more more end life respective duty imprison hang have power go way flesh spirit hold let own poet speak word healing trial

11,"This is not mere longing; it is prophecy. So over these too, our old friends, who are friends no more, we sorrow not as men without hope. It is only for those who seem to us to have lost compass and purpose, and to be driven helplessly on rocks and quicksands, whose lives are spent in the service of the world, the flesh, and the devil, for self alone, and not for their fellow-men, their country, or their God, that we must mourn and pray without sure hope and without light, trusting only that He, in whose hands they as well as we are, who has died for them as well as for us, who sees all His creatures",mere longing prophecy old friend friend sorrow man hope seem lose compass purpose drive rock quicksand life spend service world flesh devil self alone fellow man country mourn pray sure hope light trust hand die see creature

14,"Another two years have passed, and it is again the end of the summer half-year at Rugby; in fact, the School has broken up. The fifth-form examinations were over last week, and upon them have followed the speeches, and the sixth-form examinations for exhibitions; and they too are over now. The boys have gone to all the winds of heaven, except the town boys and the eleven, and the few enthusiasts besides who have asked leave to stay in their houses to see the result of the cricket matches. For this year the Wellesburn return match and the Marylebone match are played at Rugby, to the great delight of the town and neighbourhood, and the sorrow of those aspiring young cricketers who have been reckoning for the last three months on showing off at Lord’s ground.",year pass end summer half year fact break fifth form examination last week follow speech sixth form examination exhibition boy go wind heaven town boy few enthusiast ask leave stay house see result cricket match year return match match play great delight town neighbourhood sorrow aspire young cricketer reckoning last month show ground 
15,"The Doctor started for the Lakes yesterday morning, after an interview with the captain of the eleven, in the presence of Thomas, at which he arranged in what school the cricket dinners were to be, and all other matters necessary for the satisfactory carrying out of the festivities, and warned them as to keeping all spirituous liquors out of the close, and having the gates closed by nine o’clock.",start yesterday morning interview captain presence arrange school cricket dinner other matter necessary satisfactory carry festivity warn keep spirituous liquor close have gate close o'clock 
16,"The Wellesburn match was played out with great success yesterday, the School winning by three wickets; and to-day the great event of the cricketing year, the Marylebone match, is being played. What a match it has been! The London eleven came down by an afternoon train yesterday, in time to see the end of the Wellesburn match; and as soon as it was over, their leading men and umpire inspected the ground, criticising it rather unmercifully. The captain of the School eleven, and one or two others, who had played the Lord’s match before, and knew old Mr. Aislabie and several of the Lord’s men, accompanied them; while the rest of the eleven looked on from under the Three Trees with admiring eyes, and asked one another the names of the illustrious strangers, and recounted how many runs each of them had made in the late matches in Bell’s Life. They looked such hard-bitten, wiry, whiskered fellows that their young adversaries felt rather desponding as to the result of the morrow’s match. The ground was at last chosen, and two men set to work upon it to water and roll; and then, there being yet some half-hour of daylight, some one had suggested a dance on the turf. The close was half full of citizens and their families, and the idea was hailed with enthusiasm. The cornopean player was still on the ground. In five minutes the eleven and half a dozen of the Wellesburn and Marylebone men got partners somehow or another, and a merry country-dance was going on, to which every one flocked, and new couples joined in every minute, till there were a hundred of them going down the middle and up again; and the long line of school buildings looked gravely down on them, every window glowing with the last rays of the western sun; and the rooks clanged about in the tops of the old elms, greatly excited, and resolved on having their country-dance too; and the great flag flapped lazily in the gentle western breeze. Altogether it was a sight which would have made glad the heart of our brave old founder, Lawrence Sheriff, if he were half as good a fellow as I take him to have been. It was a cheerful sight to see. But what made it so valuable in the sight of the captain of the School eleven was that he there saw his young hands shaking off their shyness and awe of the Lord’s men, as they crossed hands and capered about on the grass together; for the strangers entered into it all, and threw away their cigars, and danced and shouted like boys; while old Mr. Aislabie stood by looking on in his white hat, leaning on a bat, in benevolent enjoyment. “This hop will be worth thirty runs to us to-morrow, and will be the making of Raggles and Johnson,” thinks the young leader, as he revolves many things in his mind, standing by the side of Mr. Aislabie, whom he will not leave for a minute, for he feels that the character of the School for courtesy is resting on his shoulders.",match play great success yesterday win wicket day great event cricketing year match play match eleven come afternoon train yesterday time see end match lead man umpire inspect ground criticise captain other play match know old several man accompany rest look tree admire eye ask name illustrious stranger recount many run make late match look such hard bit wiry whiskered fellow young adversary feel despond result morrow match ground last choose man set work water roll be half hour daylight one suggest dance turf close full citizen family idea hail enthusiasm cornopean player ground minute man get partner merry country dance go one flock new couple join minute be go middle long line school building look window glow last ray western sun rook clange top old elm excite resolve have country dance great flag flapp gentle western breeze sight make glad heart brave old founder half good fellow take cheerful sight see make valuable sight captain see young hand shake shyness awe man cross hand caper grass stranger enter throw cigar dance shout boy old stand look white hat lean bat benevolent enjoyment hop worth run making think young leader revolve many thing mind stand side leave minute feel character courtesy rest shoulder 
17,"But when a quarter to nine struck, and he saw old Thomas beginning to fidget about with the keys in his hand, he thought of the Doctor’s parting monition, and stopped the cornopean at once, notwithstanding the loud-voiced remonstrances from all sides; and the crowd scattered away from the close, the eleven all going into the School-house, where supper and beds were provided for them by the Doctor’s orders.",quarter strike see old begin fidget key hand think parting monition stop cornopean notwithstand loud voice remonstrance side crowd scatter close go house supper bed provide order 
18,"Deep had been the consultations at supper as to the order of going in, who should bowl the first over, whether it would be best to play steady or freely; and the youngest hands declared that they shouldn’t be a bit nervous, and praised their opponents as the jolliest fellows in the world, except perhaps their old friends the Wellesburn men.

19,"The morning had dawned bright and warm, to the intense relief of many an anxious youngster, up betimes to mark the signs of the weather. The eleven went down in a body before breakfast, for a plunge in the cold bath in a corner of the close. The ground was in splendid order, and soon after ten o’clock, before spectators had arrived, all was ready, and two of the Lord’s men took their places at the wickets--the School, with the usual liberality of young hands, having put their adversaries in first. Old Bailey stepped up to the wicket, and called play, and the match has begun.",morning dawn bright warm intense relief many anxious youngster betime mark sign weather go body breakfast plunge cold bath corner close ground splendid order o'clock spectator arrive ready man take place wicket usual liberality young hand put adversary first old step wicket call play match begin 
20,"“Oh, well bowled! well bowled, Johnson!” cries the captain, catching up the ball and sending it high above the rook trees, while the third Marylebone man walks away from the wicket, and old Bailey gravely sets up the middle stump again and puts the bails on.",bowl bowl cry captain catching ball send rook tree third man walk wicket old set middle stump put bail 
21,"“How many runs?” Away scamper three boys to the scoring table, and are back again in a minute amongst the rest of the eleven, who are collected together in a knot between wicket. “Only eighteen runs, and three wickets down!” “Huzza for old Rugby!” sings out Jack Raggles, the long-stop, toughest and burliest of boys, commonly called “Swiper Jack,”  and forthwith stands on his head, and brandishes his legs in the air in triumph, till the next boy catches hold of his heels, and throws him over on to his back.",many run scamper boy scoring table minute rest collect knot wicket run wicket old sing long stop toughest burliest boy call stand head brandish leg air triumph next boy catch hold heel throw back 
22,"“Steady there; don’t be such an ass, Jack,” says the captain; “we haven’t got the best wicket yet. Ah, look out now at cover-point,” adds he, as he sees a long-armed bare-headed, slashing-looking player coming to the wicket. “And, Jack, mind your hits. He steals more runs than any man in England.”",steady ass say captain get good wicket look cover point add see long armed bare headed slash look player come wicket mind hit steal more run man 
23,"And they all find that they have got their work to do now. The newcomer’s off-hitting is tremendous, and his running like a flash of lightning. He is never in his ground except when his wicket is down. Nothing in the whole game so trying to boys. He has stolen three byes in the first ten minutes, and Jack Raggles is furious, and begins throwing over savagely to the farther wicket, until he is sternly stopped by the captain. It is all that young gentlemen can do to keep his team steady, but he knows that everything depends on it, and faces his work bravely. The score creeps up to fifty; the boys begin to look blank; and the spectators, who are now mustering strong, are very silent. The ball flies off his bat to all parts of the field, and he gives no rest and no catches to any one. But cricket is full of glorious chances, and the goddess who presides over it loves to bring down the most skilful players. Johnson, the young bowler, is getting wild, and bowls a ball almost wide to the off; the batter steps out and cuts it beautifully to where cover-point is standing very deep--in fact almost off the ground. The ball comes skimming and twisting along about three feet from the ground; he rushes at it, and it sticks somehow or other in the fingers of his left hand, to the utter astonishment of himself and the whole field. Such a catch hasn’t been made in the close for years, and the cheering is maddening. “Pretty cricket,” says the captain, throwing himself on the ground by the deserted wicket with a long breath. He feels that a crisis has passed.",find get work do newcomer hit tremendous running flash lightning ground wicket whole game try boy steal by first minute furious begin throw far wicket stop captain young gentleman do keep team steady know depend face work score creep boy begin look blank spectator muster strong silent ball fly bat part field give rest catch one cricket full glorious chance goddess preside love bring skilful player young bowler get wild bowl ball wide off batter step cut cover point stand deep fact ground ball come skimm twist foot ground rush stick other finger left hand utter astonishment whole field catch make close year cheering maddening cricket say captain throw ground desert wicket long breath feel crisis pass 
24,"I wish I had space to describe the match--how the captain stumped the next man off a leg-shooter, and bowled small cobs to old Mr. Aislabie, who came in for the last wicket; how the Lord’s men were out by half-past twelve o’clock for ninety-eight runs; how the captain of the School eleven went in first to give his men pluck, and scored twenty-five in beautiful style; how Rugby was only four behind in the first innings; what a glorious dinner they had in the fourth-form school; and how the cover-point hitter sang the most topping comic songs, and old Mr. Aislabie made the best speeches that ever were heard, afterwards. But I haven’t space--that’s the fact; and so you must fancy it all, and carry yourselves on to half-past seven o’clock, when the School are again in, with five wickets down, and only thirty-two runs to make to win. The Marylebone men played carelessly in their second innings, but they are working like horses now to save the match.",wish have space describe match captain stump next man leg shooter bowl small cob old come last wicket man half o'clock run captain eleven go first give man pluck score beautiful style first inning glorious dinner have fourth form school cover point hitter sing topp comic song old make good speech hear have space fact fancy carry half past o'clock wicket run make win man play second inning work horse save match 
25,"There is much healthy, hearty, happy life scattered up and down the close; but the group to which I beg to call your especial attention is there, on the slope of the island, which looks towards the cricket-ground. It consists of three figures; two are seated on a bench, and one on the ground at their feet. The first, a tall, slight and rather gaunt man, with a bushy eyebrow and a dry, humorous smile, is evidently a clergyman. He is carelessly dressed, and looks rather used up, which isn’t much to be wondered at, seeing that he has just finished six weeks of examination work; but there he basks, and spreads himself out in the evening sun, bent on enjoying life, though he doesn’t quite know what to do with his arms and legs. Surely it is our friend the young master, whom we have had glimpses of before, but his face has gained a great deal since we last came across him.",be much healthy hearty happy life scatter close group beg call especial attention slope island look cricket ground consist figure seat bench ground foot first tall slight gaunt man bushy eyebrow dry humorous smile clergyman dress look use much wonder see finish week examination work bask spread evening sun bend enjoy life know do arm leg friend young master have glimpse face gain great deal come 
26,"And by his side, in white flannel shirt and trousers, straw hat, the captain’s belt, and the untanned yellow cricket shoes which all the eleven wear, sits a strapping figure, near six feet high, with ruddy, tanned face and whiskers, curly brown hair, and a laughing, dancing eye. He is leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees, and dandling his favourite bat, with which he has made thirty or forty runs to-day, in his strong brown hands. It is Tom Brown, grown into a young man nineteen years old, a praepostor and captain of the eleven, spending his last day as a Rugby boy, and, let us hope, as much wiser as he is bigger, since we last had the pleasure of coming across him.",side white flannel shirt trousers straw hat captain belt untanned yellow cricket shoe wear sit strapping figure foot high ruddy tann face whisker curly brown hair laugh dancing eye lean elbow rest knee dandle favourite bat make run day strong brown hand grow young man year old praepostor captain spend last day rugby boy let hope wise big have pleasure come 
27,"And at their feet on the warm, dry ground, similarly dressed, sits Arthur, Turkish fashion, with his bat across his knees. He too is no longer a boy--less of a boy, in fact, than Tom, if one may judge from the thoughtfulness of his face, which is somewhat paler, too, than one could wish; but his figure, though slight, is well knit and active, and all his old timidity has disappeared, and is replaced by silent, quaint fun, with which his face twinkles all over, as he listens to the broken talk between the other two, in which he joins every now and then.",foot warm dry ground dress sit turkish fashion bat knee boy less boy fact judge thoughtfulness face paler wish figure slight knit active old timidity disappear replace silent quaint fun face twinkle listen break talk other join 
28,"All three are watching the game eagerly, and joining in the cheering which follows every good hit.

There are only twenty-four runs to make, and four wickets to go down--a winning match if they play decently steady. The ball is a very swift one, and rises fast, catching Jack on the outside of the thigh, and bounding away as if from india-rubber, while they run two for a leg-bye amidst great applause and shouts from Jack’s many admirers. The next ball is a beautifully-pitched ball for the outer stump, which the reckless and unfeeling Jack catches hold of, and hits right round to leg for five, while the applause becomes deafening.

Jack waves his hand triumphantly towards the tent, as much as to say, “See if I don’t finish it all off now in three hits.”",walk swagger wicket bat shoulder hold short parley man cover point hitter cunn man go bowl slow twister wave hand tent say see finish hit 
77,"Alas, my son Jack, the enemy is too old for thee. The first ball of the over Jack steps out and meets, swiping with all his force. If he had only allowed for the twist! But he hasn’t, and so the ball goes spinning up straight in the air, as if it would never come down again. Away runs Jack, shouting and trusting to the chapter of accidents; but the bowler runs steadily under it, judging every spin, and calling out, “I have it,” catches it, and playfully pitches it on to the back of the stalwart Jack, who is departing with a rueful countenance.",son enemy old first ball step meet swipe force allow twist ball go spinn air come run shouting trust chapter accident bowler run judge spin call have catch pitch back stalwart depart rueful countenance 
78,"“I knew how it would be,” says Tom, rising. “Come along; the game’s getting very serious.”",know say rise come game get serious 
79,"So they leave the island and go to the tent; and after deep consultation, Arthur is sent in, and goes off to the wicket with a last exhortation from Tom to play steady and keep his bat straight. To the suggestions that Winter is the best bat left, Tom only replies, “Arthur is the steadiest, and Johnson will make the runs if the wicket is only kept up.”",leave island go tent deep consultation send go wicket last exhortation play keep bat suggestion good bat leave reply steadiest make run wicket keep 
80,"“I am surprised to see Arthur in the eleven,” said the master, as they stood together in front of the dense crowd, which was now closing in round the ground.",surprised see say master stand front dense crowd close ground 
81,"“Well, I’m not quite sure that he ought to be in for his play,” said Tom, “but I couldn’t help putting him in. It will do him so much good, and you can’t think what I owe him.”",sure play say help put do much good think owe 
82,"The master smiled. The clock strikes eight, and the whole field becomes fevered with excitement. Arthur, after two narrow escapes, scores one, and Johnson gets the ball. The bowling and fielding are superb, and Johnson’s batting worthy the occasion. He makes here a two, and there a one, managing to keep the ball to himself, and Arthur backs up and runs perfectly. Only eleven runs to make now, and the crowd scarcely breathe. At last Arthur gets the ball again, and actually drives it forward for two, and feels prouder than when he got the three best prizes, at hearing Tom’s shout of joy, “Well played, well played, young un!”",master smile clock strike whole field become fever excitement narrow escape score get ball bowling fielding superb batting worthy occasion make manage keep ball back run run make crowd breathe last get ball drive feel prouder get good prize hear shout joy play play young un 
83,"But the next ball is too much for the young hand, and his bails fly different ways. Nine runs to make, and two wickets to go down: it is too much for human nerves.",next ball much young hand bail fly different way run make wicket go much human nerve 
84,"Before Winter can get in, the omnibus which is to take the Lord’s men to the train pulls up at the side of the close, and Mr. Aislabie and Tom consult, and give out that the stumps will be drawn after the next over. And so ends the great match. Winter and Johnson carry out their bats, and, it being a one day’s match, the Lord’s men are declared the winners, they having scored the most in the first innings.",get omnibus take man train pull side close consult give stump draw next end great match carry bat day match man declare winner score most first inning 
85,"But such a defeat is a victory: so think Tom and all the School eleven, as they accompany their conquerors to the omnibus, and send them off with three ringing cheers, after Mr. Aislabie has shaken hands all round, saying to Tom, “I must compliment you, sir, on your eleven, and I hope we shall have you for a member if you come up to town.”",defeat victory think accompany conqueror omnibus send ringing cheer shake hand say compliment sir hope have member come town 
86,"As Tom and the rest of the eleven were turning back into the close, and everybody was beginning to cry out for another country-dance, encouraged by the success of the night before, the young master, who was just leaving the close, stopped him, and asked him to come up to tea at half-past eight, adding, “I won’t keep you more than half an hour, and ask Arthur to come up too.”",rest turn close begin cry country dance encourage success night young master leave close stop ask come tea half past add keep more hour ask come

88,"“Do, by all means,” said the master; “I’ll wait here for you.”",means say master wait 
89,"So Tom went off to get his boots and things from the tent, to tell Arthur of the invitation, and to speak to his second in command about stopping the dancing and shutting up the close as soon as it grew dusk. Arthur promised to follow as soon as he had had a dance. So Tom handed his things over to the man in charge of the tent, and walked quietly away to the gate where the master was waiting, and the two took their way together up the Hillmorton road.",go get boot thing tent tell invitation speak second command stop dancing shut close grow dusk promise follow have dance hand thing man charge tent walk gate master wait take way road 
90,"Of course they found the master’s house locked up, and all the servants away in the close--about this time, no doubt, footing it away on the grass, with extreme delight to themselves, and in utter oblivion of the unfortunate bachelor their master, whose one enjoyment in the shape of meals was his “dish of tea” (as our grandmothers called it) in the evening; and the phrase was apt in his case, for he always poured his out into the saucer before drinking. Great was the good man’s horror at finding himself shut out of his own house. Had he been alone he would have treated it as a matter of course, and would have strolled contentedly up and down his gravel walk until some one came home; but he was hurt at the stain on his character of host, especially as the guest was a pupil. However, the guest seemed to think it a great joke, and presently, as they poked about round the house, mounted a wall, from which he could reach a passage window. The window, as it turned out, was not bolted, so in another minute Tom was in the house and down at the front door, which he opened from inside. The master chuckled grimly at this burglarious entry, and insisted on leaving the hall-door and two of the front windows open, to frighten the truants on their return; and then the two set about foraging for tea, in which operation the master was much at fault, having the faintest possible idea of where to find anything, and being, moreover, wondrously short-sighted; but Tom, by a sort of instinct, knew the right cupboards in the kitchen and pantry, and soon managed to place on the snuggery table better materials for a meal than had appeared there probably during the reign of his tutor, who was then and there initiated, amongst other things, into the excellence of that mysterious condiment, a dripping-cake. The cake was newly baked, and all rich and flaky; Tom had found it reposing in the cook’s private cupboard, awaiting her return; and as a warning to her they finished it to the last crumb. The kettle sang away merrily on the hob of the snuggery, for, notwithstanding the time of year, they lighted a fire, throwing both the windows wide open at the same time; the heaps of books and papers were pushed away to the other end of the table, and the great solitary engraving of King’s College Chapel over the mantelpiece looked less stiff than usual, as they settled themselves down in the twilight to the serious drinking of tea.",course find master house lock servant close time doubt foot grass extreme delight utter oblivion unfortunate bachelor master enjoyment shape meal dish tea grandmother call evening phrase apt case pour saucer drink great good man horror find shut own house alone treat matter course stroll gravel walk one come hurt stain character host guest pupil guest seem think great joke poke house mount wall reach passage window window turn bolt minute house front door open master chuckle burglarious entry insist leave hall door front window open frighten truant return set forage tea operation master fault have faintest possible idea find short sight sort instinct know right cupboard kitchen pantry manage place snuggery table good material meal appear reign tutor initiate other thing excellence mysterious condiment drip cake cake bake rich flaky find repose cook private cupboard await return warning finish last crumb kettle sing hob snuggery time year light fire throw window open same time heap book paper push other end table great solitary engraving mantelpiece look stiff usual settle twilight serious drinking tea

98,"“So it will,”’ said Tom, staring into the fire. “Poor dear Harry,” he went on--“how well I remember the day we were put out of the twenty! How he rose to the situation, and burnt his cigar-cases, and gave away his pistols, and pondered on the constitutional authority of the sixth, and his new duties to the Doctor, and the fifth form, and the fags! Ay, and no fellow ever acted up to them better, though he was always a people’s man--for the fags, and against constituted authorities. He couldn’t help that, you know. I’m sure the Doctor must have liked him?” said Tom, looking up inquiringly.",say stare fire poor dear go remember day put rise situation burn cigar case give pistol ponder constitutional authority sixth new duty fifth form fag fellow act good person man fag constitute authority help know sure like say look

How long it took him, even here, to learn the lesson of obeying!”",see good one appreciate say master hope get good colonel do respect take learn lesson obey 
100,"“Well, I wish I were alongside of him,” said Tom. “If I can’t be at Rugby, I want to be at work in the world, and not dawdling away three years at Oxford.”",wish say want work world dawdle year 
101,"“What do you mean by ‘at work in the world’?” said the master, pausing with his lips close to his saucerful of tea, and peering at Tom over it.",mean work world say master pause lip close saucerful tea peer 
102,"“Well, I mean real work--one’s profession--whatever one will have really to do and make one’s living by. I want to be doing some real good, feeling that I am not only at play in the world,” answered Tom, rather puzzled to find out himself what he really did mean.",mean real work profession have do make live want do real good feel play world answer puzzled find mean 
103,"“You are mixing up two very different things in your head, I think, Brown,” said the master, putting down the empty saucer, “and you ought to get clear about them. You talk of ‘working to get your living,’ and ‘doing some real good in the world,’ in the same breath. Now, you may be getting a very good living in a profession, and yet doing no good at all in the world, but quite the contrary, at the same time. Keep the latter before you as your one object, and you will be right, whether you make a living or not; but if you dwell on the other, you’ll very likely drop into mere money-making, and let the world take care of itself for good or evil. Don’t be in a hurry about finding your work in the world for yourself--you are not old enough to judge for yourself yet; but just look about you in the place you find yourself in, and try to make things a little better and honester there. You’ll find plenty to keep your hand in at Oxford, or wherever else you go. And don’t be led away to think this part of the world important and that unimportant. Every corner of the world is important. No man knows whether this part or that is most so, but every man may do some honest work in his own corner.” And then the good man went on to talk wisely to Tom of the sort of work which he might take up as an undergraduate, and warned him of the prevalent university sins, and explained to him the many and great differences between university and school life, till the twilight changed into darkness, and they heard the truant servants stealing in by the back entrance.",mix different thing head think say master put empty saucer get clear talk work get living do real good world same breath get good living profession do good world contrary same time keep latter object right make living dwell other drop mere money make let world take care good evil hurry find work world old judge look place find try make thing little good honester find plenty keep hand go lead think part world important unimportant corner world important man know part man do honest work own corner good man go talk sort work take undergraduate warn prevalent university sin explain many great difference university school life twilight change darkness hear truant servant steal back entrance

110,"“Exactly so,” answered the master. “Now, I was with him a few minutes afterwards, and he was in great distress about you two. And after some talk, we both agreed that you in particular wanted some object in the School beyond games and mischief; for it was quite clear that you never would make the regular school work your first object. And so the Doctor, at the beginning of the next half-year, looked out the best of the new boys, and separated you and East, and put the young boy into your study, in the hope that when you had somebody to lean on you, you would begin to stand a little steadier yourself, and get manliness and thoughtfulness. And I can assure you he has watched the experiment ever since with great satisfaction.

111,"Up to this time Tom had never given wholly in to or understood the Doctor. At first he had thoroughly feared him. For some years, as I have tried to show, he had learnt to regard him with love and respect, and to think him a very great and wise and good man. But as regarded his own position in the School, of which he was no little proud, Tom had no idea of giving any one credit for it but himself, and, truth to tell, was a very self-conceited young gentleman on the subject. He was wont to boast that he had fought his own way fairly up the School, and had never made up to or been taken up by any big fellow or master, and that it was now quite a different place from what it was when he first came. And, indeed, though he didn’t actually boast of it, yet in his secret soul he did to a great extent believe that the great reform in the School had been owing quite as much to himself as to any one else. Arthur, he acknowledged, had done him good, and taught him a good deal; so had other boys in different ways, but they had not had the same means of influence on the School in general. And as for the Doctor, why, he was a splendid master; but every one knew that masters could do very little out of school hours. In short, he felt on terms of equality with his chief, so far as the social state of the School was concerned, and thought that the Doctor would find it no easy matter to get on without him. Moreover, his School Toryism was still strong, and he looked still with some jealousy on the Doctor, as somewhat of a fanatic in the matter of change, and thought it very desirable for the School that he should have some wise person (such as himself) to look sharply after vested School-rights, and see that nothing was done to the injury of the republic without due protest.",time give understand first fear year try show learn regard love respect think great wise good man regard own position little proud have idea give credit truth tell self conceited young gentleman subject boast fight own way make take big fellow master different place come boast secret soul great extent believe great reform ow much one else acknowledge do good teach good deal have other boy different way have same means influence general splendid master one know master do little school hour short feel term equality chief social state concerned think find easy matter get strong look jealousy fanatic matter change think desirable have wise person such look vested school right see do injury republic due protest 
112,"It was a new light to him to find that, besides teaching the sixth, and governing and guiding the whole School, editing classics, and writing histories, the great headmaster had found time in those busy years to watch over the career even of him, Tom Brown, and his particular friends, and, no doubt, of fifty other boys at the same time, and all this without taking the least credit to himself, or seeming to know, or let any one else know, that he ever thought particularly of any boy at all.",new light find teach sixth govern guide whole school edit classic writing history great headmaster find time busy year watch career particular friend other boy same time take least credit seem know let one else know think boy 
113,"However, the Doctor’s victory was complete from that moment over Tom Brown at any rate. He gave way at all points, and the enemy marched right over him--cavalry, infantry, and artillery, and the land transport corps, and the camp followers. It had taken eight long years to do it; but now it was done thoroughly, and there wasn’t a corner of him left which didn’t believe in the Doctor. Had he returned to School again, and the Doctor begun the half-year by abolishing fagging, and football, and the Saturday half-holiday, or all or any of the most cherished School institutions, Tom would have supported him with the blindest faith. And so, after a half confession of his previous shortcomings, and sorrowful adieus to his tutor, from whom he received two beautifully-bound volumes of the Doctor’s sermons, as a parting present, he marched down to the Schoolhouse, a hero-worshipper, who would have satisfied the soul of Thomas Carlyle himself.",victory complete moment rate give way point enemy march cavalry infantry artillery land transport corps camp follower take long year do do be corner leave believe return begin half year abolish fagging football half holiday cherish school institution support blind faith half confession previous shortcoming sorrowful adieus tutor receive bind volume sermon parting present march hero worshipper satisfy soul 
114,"There he found the eleven at high jinks after supper, Jack Raggles shouting comic songs and performing feats of strength, and was greeted by a chorus of mingled remonstrance at his desertion and joy at his reappearance. And falling in with the humour of the evening, he was soon as great a boy as all the rest; and at ten o’clock was chaired round the quadrangle, on one of the hall benches, borne aloft by the eleven, shouting in chorus, “For he’s a jolly good fellow,” while old Thomas, in a melting mood, and the other School-house servants, stood looking on.",find high jink supper shouting comic song perform feat strength greet chorus mingle remonstrance desertion joy reappearance fall humour evening great boy rest o'clock chair quadrangle hall bench borne shouting chorus jolly good fellow old melt mood other school house servant stand look 
115,"And the next morning after breakfast he squared up all the cricketing accounts, went round to his tradesmen and other acquaintance, and said his hearty good-byes; and by twelve o’clock was in the train, and away for London, no longer a school-boy, and divided in his thoughts between hero-worship, honest regrets over the long stage of his life which was now slipping out of sight behind him, and hopes and resolves for the next stage upon which he was entering with all the confidence of a young traveller.",next morning breakfast square cricketing account go tradesmen other acquaintance say hearty good by o'clock train school boy divide thought hero worship honest regret long stage life slip sight hope resolve next stage enter confidence young traveller
