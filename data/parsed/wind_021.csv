2, DIAMOND managed with many blunders to read this rhyme to his mother.,manage many blunder read rhyme mother 
3,"“Isn’t it nice, mother?” he said.",nice mother say

8,"Little Boy Blue, come blow me your horn--",little come blow horn 
9,"Yes, of course it is--for this one went `blowing his horn and beating his drum.’ He had a drum too.",course one go blow horn beat drum have drum 
10,"            Little Boy Blue, come blow me your horn;             The sheep’s in the meadow, the cow’s in the corn,",little come blow horn sheep meadow cow corn

14,"            Who’ll go and wake him?  No, not I;             For if I do, he’ll be sure to cry.",go wake sure cry 
15,"So I suppose nobody did wake him. He was a rather cross little boy, I daresay, when woke up. And when he did wake of himself, and saw the mischief the cow had done to the corn, instead of running home to his mother, he ran away into the wood and lost himself. Don’t you think that’s very likely, mother?”",suppose wake cross little boy wake wake see mischief cow do corn run mother run wood lose think likely mother 
16,"“I shouldn’t wonder,” she answered.",wonder answer 
17,"“So you see he was naughty; for even when he lost himself he did not want to go home. Any of the creatures would have shown him the way if he had asked it--all but the snake. He followed the snake, you know, and he took him farther away. I suppose it was a young one of the same serpent that tempted Adam and Eve. Father was telling us about it last Sunday, you remember.”",see naughty lose want go creature show way ask snake follow snake know take suppose young one same serpent tempt father tell last remember 
18,"“Bless the child!” said his mother to herself; and then added aloud, finding that Diamond did not go on, “Well, what next?”",bless child say mother add find go 
19,"“I don’t know, mother. I’m sure there’s a great deal more, but what it is I can’t say. I only know that he killed the snake. I suppose that’s what he had a drumstick for. He couldn’t do it with his horn.”",know mother sure be great deal more say know kill snake suppose have drumstick do horn 
20,"“But surely you’re not such a silly as to take it all for true, Diamond?”",silly take true

23,"“When baby cries and won’t be happy, and when father and you talk about your troubles, I mean.”",baby cry happy father talk trouble mean 
24,"This did little to reassure his mother; and lest my reader should have his qualms about it too, I venture to remind him once more that Diamond had been to the back of the north wind.",do little reassure mother reader have qualm venture remind more back north wind 
25,"Finding she made no reply, Diamond went on--",find make reply go 
26,"“In a week or so, I shall be able to go to the tall gentleman and tell him I can read. And I’ll ask him if he can help me to understand the rhyme.”",week able go tall gentleman tell read ask help understand rhyme 
27,"But before the week was out, he had another reason for going to Mr. Raymond.",week have reason go 
28,"For three days, on each of which, at one time or other, Diamond’s father was on the same stand near the National Gallery, the girl was not at her crossing, and Diamond got quite anxious about her, fearing she must be ill. On the fourth day, not seeing her yet, he said to his father, who had that moment shut the door of his cab upon a fare--",day time other father same stand national girl crossing get anxious fear ill fourth day see say father have moment shut door cab fare

31,So saying he climbed on his box and drove off.,say climb box drive 
32,"He had great confidence in his boy, you see, and would trust him anywhere. But if he had known the kind of place in which the girl lived, he would perhaps have thought twice before he allowed him to go alone. Diamond, who did know something of it, had not, however, any fear. From talking to the girl he had a good notion of where about it was, and he remembered the address well enough; so by asking his way some twenty times, mostly of policemen, he came at length pretty near the place. The last policeman he questioned looked down upon him from the summit of six feet two inches, and replied with another question, but kindly:",have great confidence boy see trust know kind place girl live think allow go know fear talk girl have good notion remember address ask way time policemen come length place last policeman question look summit foot inch reply question

37,“But what on earth do you want here?”,earth want 
38,"Diamond told him plainly what he was about, and of course the man believed him, for nobody ever disbelieved Diamond. People might think he was mistaken, but they never thought he was telling a story.",tell course man believe disbelieve person think mistaken think tell story 
39,"“It’s an ugly place,” said the policeman.",ugly place say policeman 
40,“Is it far off?” asked Diamond.,ask 
41,“No. It’s next door almost. But it’s not safe.”,next door safe 
42,"“Nobody hurts me,” said Diamond.",hurt say 
43,"“I must go with you, I suppose.”",go suppose 
44,"“Oh, no! please not,” said Diamond. “They might think I was going to meddle with them, and I ain’t, you know.”",say think go meddle know 
45,"“Well, do as you please,” said the man, and gave him full directions.",do say man give full direction 
46,"Diamond set off, never suspecting that the policeman, who was a kind-hearted man, with children of his own, was following him close, and watching him round every corner. As he went on, all at once he thought he remembered the place, and whether it really was so, or only that he had laid up the policeman’s instructions well in his mind, he went straight for the cellar of old Sal.",set suspect policeman kind hearted man child own follow close watch corner go think remember place lay policeman instruction mind go cellar old 
47,"“He’s a sharp little kid, anyhow, for as simple as he looks,” said the man to himself. “Not a wrong turn does he take! But old Sal’s a rum un for such a child to pay a morning visit to. She’s worse when she’s sober than when she’s half drunk. I’ve seen her when she’d have torn him in pieces.”",sharp little kid simple look say man wrong turn take old rum un child pay morning visit bad sober half drunk see tear piece 
48,"Happily then for Diamond, old Sal had gone out to get some gin. When he came to her door at the bottom of the area-stair and knocked, he received no answer. He laid his ear to the door, and thought he heard a moaning within. So he tried the door, and found it was not locked! It was a dreary place indeed,--and very dark, for the window was below the level of the street, and covered with mud, while over the grating which kept people from falling into the area, stood a chest of drawers, placed there by a dealer in second-hand furniture, which shut out almost all the light. And the smell in the place was dreadful. Diamond stood still for a while, for he could see next to nothing, but he heard the moaning plainly enough now, When he got used to the darkness, he discovered his friend lying with closed eyes and a white suffering face on a heap of little better than rags in a corner of the den. He went up to her and spoke; but she made him no answer. Indeed, she was not in the least aware of his presence, and Diamond saw that he could do nothing for her without help. So taking a lump of barley-sugar from his pocket, which he had bought for her as he came along, and laying it beside her, he left the place, having already made up his mind to go and see the tall gentleman, Mr. Raymond, and ask him to do something for Sal’s Nanny, as the girl was called.",old go get gin come door bottom area stair knock receive answer lay ear door think hear moan try door find lock dreary place dark window level street cover mud grating keep person fall area stand chest drawer place dealer second hand furniture shut light smell place dreadful stand while see next hear moan use darkness discover friend lie close eye white suffering face heap little good rag corner dan go speak make answer least aware presence see do help take lump barley sugar pocket buy come lay leave place make mind go see tall gentleman ask do girl call 
49,"By the time he got up the area-steps, three or four women who had seen him go down were standing together at the top waiting for him. They wanted his clothes for their children; but they did not follow him down lest Sal should find them there. The moment he appeared, they laid their hands on him, and all began talking at once, for each wanted to get some advantage over her neighbours. He told them quite quietly, for he was not frightened, that he had come to see what was the matter with Nanny.",time get area step woman see go stand top waiting want clothes child follow find moment appear lay hand begin talk want get advantage neighbour tell frighten come see matter 
50,"“What do you know about Nanny?” said one of them fiercely. “Wait till old Sal comes home, and you’ll catch it, for going prying into her house when she’s out. If you don’t give me your jacket directly, I’ll go and fetch her.”",know say wait old come catch go pry house give jacket go fetch 
51,"“I can’t give you my jacket,” said Diamond. “It belongs to my father and mother, you know. It’s not mine to give. Is it now? You would not think it right to give away what wasn’t yours--would you now?”",give jacket say belong father mother know give think right give 
52,"“Give it away! No, that I wouldn’t; I’d keep it,” she said, with a rough laugh. “But if the jacket ain’t yours, what right have you to keep it? Here, Cherry, make haste. It’ll be one go apiece.”",give keep say rough laugh jacket right have keep make haste go 
53,"They all began to tug at the jacket, while Diamond stooped and kept his arms bent to resist them. Before they had done him or the jacket any harm, however, suddenly they all scampered away; and Diamond, looking in the opposite direction, saw the tall policeman coming towards him.",begin tug jacket stoop keep arm bend resist do jacket harm scamper look opposite direction see tall policeman come 
54,"“You had better have let me come with you, little man,” he said, looking down in Diamond’s face, which was flushed with his resistance.",have good let come little man say look face flush resistance 
55,"“You came just in the right time, thank you,” returned Diamond. “They’ve done me no harm.”",come right time thank return do harm 
56,"“They would have if I hadn’t been at hand, though.”",have hand 
57,"“Yes; but you were at hand, you know, so they couldn’t.”",hand know 
58,"Perhaps the answer was deeper in purport than either Diamond or the policeman knew. They walked away together, Diamond telling his new friend how ill poor Nanny was, and that he was going to let the tall gentleman know. The policeman put him in the nearest way for Bloomsbury, and stepping out in good earnest, Diamond reached Mr. Raymond’s door in less than an hour. When he asked if he was at home, the servant, in return, asked what he wanted.",answer deep purport policeman know walk tell new friend ill poor go let tall gentleman know policeman put near way step good earnest reach door less hour ask home servant return ask want

62,“How am I to know that?”,know 
63,"Diamond stared with astonishment for one moment, then answered:",stare astonishment moment answer 
64,"“Why, I’ve just told you. That’s how you know it.”",tell know 
65,"But this man was made of coarser grain than the policeman, and, instead of seeing that Diamond could not tell a lie, he put his answer down as impudence, and saying, “Do you think I’m going to take your word for it?” shut the door in his face.",man make coarser grain policeman see tell lie put answer impudence say think go take word shut door face 
66,"Diamond turned and sat down on the doorstep, thinking with himself that the tall gentleman must either come in or come out, and he was therefore in the best possible position for finding him. He had not waited long before the door opened again; but when he looked round, it was only the servant once more.",turn sit doorstep think tall gentleman come come good possible position find wait door open look servant more 
67,"“Get, away” he said. “What are you doing on the doorstep?”",get say do doorstep 
68,"“Waiting for Mr. Raymond,” answered Diamond, getting up.",wait answer get 
69,“He’s not at home.”,home 
70,"“Then I’ll wait till he comes,” returned Diamond, sitting down again with a smile.",wait come return sit smile 
71,"What the man would have done next I do not know, but a step sounded from the hall, and when Diamond looked round yet again, there was the tall gentleman.",man do know step sound hall look be tall gentleman 
72,"“Who’s this, John?” he asked.",ask 
73,"“I don’t know, sir. An imperent little boy as will sit on the doorstep.”",know sir imperent little boy sit doorstep 
74,"“Please sir” said Diamond, “he told me you weren’t at home, and I sat down to wait for you.”",sir say tell home sit wait 
75,"“Eh, what!” said Mr. Raymond. “John! John! This won’t do. Is it a habit of yours to turn away my visitors? There’ll be some one else to turn away, I’m afraid, if I find any more of this kind of thing. Come in, my little man. I suppose you’ve come to claim your sixpence?”",say habit turn visitor one else turn afraid find more kind thing come little man suppose come claim sixpence 
76,"“No, sir, not that.”",sir

81,"“Oh, yes; I remember. What’s the matter? Has she got run over?”",remember matter run 
82,Then Diamond told him all.,tell 
83,"Now Mr. Raymond was one of the kindest men in London. He sent at once to have the horse put to the brougham, took Diamond with him, and drove to the Children’s Hospital. There he was well known to everybody, for he was not only a large subscriber, but he used to go and tell the children stories of an afternoon. One of the doctors promised to go and find Nanny, and do what could be done--have her brought to the hospital, if possible.",kindest man send have horse put brougham take drive know large subscriber use go tell child story afternoon doctor promise go find do do have bring hospital possible 
84,"That same night they sent a litter for her, and as she could be of no use to old Sal until she was better, she did not object to having her removed. So she was soon lying in the fever ward--for the first time in her life in a nice clean bed. But she knew nothing of the whole affair. She was too ill to know anything.",same night send litter use old good object have remove lie fever ward first time life nice clean bed know whole affair ill know
