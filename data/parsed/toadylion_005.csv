2," But, meanwhile, Janet Sheepshanks stands at the end of the stepping-stones, and Janet is hardly a person to keep waiting anywhere near the house of Windy Standard.",stand end step stone person keep wait house windy 
3,"Over the stepping-stones came as leader Priscilla Smith, her head thrown back, straining in every nerve with the excitement of carrying Sir Toady Lion, whose scratched legs and shoeless feet dangled over the stream. Immediately beneath her, and wading above the knee in the rush of the water, there staggered through the shallows Hugh John, supporting his sister with voice and hand--or, as he would have said, ""boosting her up"" whenever she swayed riverward with her burden, pushing her behind when she hesitated, and running before to offer his back as an additional stepping-stone when the spaces were wide between the boulders.",step stone come leader head throw strain nerve excitement carry scratch leg shoeless foot dangle stream wading knee rush water stagger shallow support sister voice hand say boost sway riverward burden push hesitate run offer back additional step stone space wide boulder 
4,"Janet Sheepshanks waited grimly for her charges on the bank, and her eyes seemed to deceive her, words to fail her, as the children came nearer. Never had such a sight been seen near the decent house of Windy Standard. Miss Priscilla and her pinafore were represented by a ragged tinkler's lass with a still more ragged frill about her neck. Her cheeks and hands were as variously scratched as if she had fallen into a whole thicket of brambles. Her face, too, was pale, and the tatooed places showed bright scarlet against the whiteness of her skin. She had lost a shoe, and her dress was ripped to the knee by a great ragged triangular tear, which flapped wet about her ankles as she walked.",wait charge bank eye seem deceive word fail child come have sight see decent house windy pinafore represent ragged tinkler lass ragged frill neck cheek hand scratch fall whole thicket bramble face pale tatooe place show bright scarlet whiteness skin lose shoe dress rip knee great ragged triangular tear flapp wet ankle walk 
5,"Sir Toady Lion was somewhat less damaged, but still showed manifold signs of rough usage. His lace collar, the pride of Janet Sheepshanks' heart, was torn nearly off his shoulders, and now hung jagged and unsightly down his back. Several buttons of his well-ordered tunic were gone, and as to his person he was mud as far above the knees as could be seen without turning him upside down.",damage show manifold sign rough usage lace collar pride heart tear shoulder hang jagged unsightly back several button order tunic gone person mud knee see turn 
6,"But Hugh John--words are vain to describe the plight of Hugh John. One eye was closed, and began to be discoloured, taking on above the cheekbone the shot green and purple of a half-ripe plum. His lip was cut, and a thin thread of scarlet stealing down his brow told of a broken head. What remained of his garments presented a ruin more complete, if less respectable, than the ancient castle of the Windy Standard. Neither shoe nor shoe-string, neither stocking nor collar, remained intact upon him. On his bare legs were the marks of cruel kicks, and for ease of transport he carried the _débris_ of his jacket under his arm. He had not the remotest idea where his cap had gone to.",word vain describe plight eye close begin discoloure take cheekbone shot green purple half ripe plum lip cut thin thread scarlet steal brow tell break head remain garment present ruin complete respectable ancient castle windy shoe shoe string stock collar remain intact bare leg mark cruel kick ease transport carry _débris_ jacket arm remotest idea cap go

8,"No wonder that Janet Sheepshanks awaited this sorry procession with a grim tightening of the lips, or that her hand quivered with the desire of punishment, even while her kind and motherly heart yearned to be busy repairing damages and binding up the wounded. Of this feeling, however, it was imperative that for the present, in the interests of discipline, she should show nothing.",wonder await sorry procession grim tightening lip hand quiver desire punishment kind motherly heart yearn busy repair damage bind wound feeling imperative present interest discipline show 
9,"It was upon Priscilla, as the eldest in years and senior responsible officer in charge, that Janet first turned the vials of her wrath.",old year senior responsible officer charge turn vial wrath 
10,"""Eh, Priscilla Smith, but ye are a ba-a-ad, bad lassie. Ye should ha'e your bare back slashit wi' nettles! Where ha'e ye been, and what ha'e ye done to these twa bairns? Ye shall be marched straight to your father, and if he doesna gar ye loup when ye wad raither stand still, and claw where ye are no yeuky, he will no be doing his duty to the Almichty, and to your puir mither that's lang syne in her restin' grave in the kirk-yaird o' Edom.""",ba ad bad lassie be bare back slashit wi' nettle do twa bairn march father do ger wake raither stand claw yeuky do duty puir mither syne restin' grave kirk 
11,"By which fervent address in her native tongue, Janet meant that Mr. Smith would be decidedly spoiling the child if on this occasion he spared the rod. Janet could speak good enough formal English when she chose, for instance to her master on Sabbath, or to the minister on visitation days; but whenever she was excited she returned to that vigorous ancient Early English which some miscall a dialect, and of which she had a noble and efficient command.",fervent address native tongue mean spoil child occasion spare rod speak good formal choose instance master minister visitation day excite return vigorous ancient early miscall dialect have noble efficient command 
12,"To Janet's attack, Priscilla answered not a word either of explanation or apology. She recognised that the case had gone far beyond that. She only set Sir Toady Lion on his feet, and bent down to brush the mud from his tunic with her usual sisterly gesture. Janet Sheepshanks thrust her aside without ceremony.",attack answer word explanation apology recognise case go set foot bend brush mud tunic usual sisterly gesture thrust ceremony 
13,"""My wee man,"" she said, ""what have they done to you?""",wee man say do 
14,"Toady Lion began volubly, and in his usual shrill piping voice, to make an accusation against certain bad boys who had ""hit him,"" and ""hurted him,"" and ""kicked him."" And now when at last he was safely delivered and lodged in the well-proven arms of Janet Sheepshanks his tears flowed apace, and made clean furrows down the woebegone grubbiness of his face.",begin usual shrill piping voice make accusation certain bad boy hit hurt kick last deliver lodg prove arm tear flow make clean furrow woebegone grubbiness face 
15,"Priscilla walked by Janet's side, white and silent, nerving herself for the coming interview. At ordinary times Janet Sheepshanks was terrible enough, and her word law in all the precincts of Windy Standard. But Priscilla knew that she must now face the anger of her father; and so, with this in prospect, the railing accusations of her old nurse scarcely so much as reached her ears.",walk side white silent nerve come interview ordinary time terrible word law precinct windy know face anger father prospect rail accusation old nurse reach ear 
16,"Hugh John, stripped of all military pomp, limped behind--a short, dry, cheerless sob shaking him at intervals. But in reality this was more the protest of ineffectual anger than any concession to unmanly weakness.",stripp military pomp limp short dry cheerless sob shake interval reality protest ineffectual anger concession unmanly weakness
