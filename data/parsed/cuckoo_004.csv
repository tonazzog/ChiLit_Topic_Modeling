She seemed to slide up the chain just as easily as in a general way she would have slidden down, only without any disagreeable anticipation of a bump at the end of the journey. And when she got to the top how wonderfully different it looked from anything she could have expected!

It was something like a saloon railway carriage--it seemed to be all lined and carpeted and everything, with rich mossy red velvet; there was a little round table in the middle and two arm-chairs, on one of which sat the cuckoo--""quite like other people,"" thought Griselda to herself--while the other, as he pointed out to Griselda by a little nod, was evidently intended for her.",charming little snuggery imaginable saloon railway carriage seem line carpet rich mossy red velvet be little round table middle arm chair sit cuckoo other person think other point little nod intend

At the foot they found themselves in a vestibule, much handsomer than the entrance at the other side, and the cuckoo, crossing it, lifted one of his claws and touched a spring in the wall.

There were green silk curtains all round, too, which you could draw or not as you pleased, just by touching a spring. Griselda stroked the silk gently. It was not ""fruzzley"" silk, if you know what that means; it did not make you feel as if your nails wanted cutting, or as if all the rough places on your skin were being rubbed up the wrong way; its softness was like that of a rose or pansy petal.",change cuckoo boudoir be chair seat number _very_ soft cushion cover green silk be green silk curtain draw pleased touch spring stroke silk fruzzley silk know mean make feel nail want cutting rough place skin rub wrong way softness rose pansy petal

The steps leading up to the door were very wide and shallow, and covered with a gold embroidered carpet, which _looked_ as if it would be prickly to her bare feet, but which, on the contrary, when she trod upon it, felt softer than the softest moss. She could see very little besides the carpet, for at each side of the steps stood rows and rows of mandarins, all something like, but a great deal grander than, the pair outside her aunt's cabinet; and as the cuckoo hopped and Griselda walked up the staircase, they all, in turn, row by row, began solemnly to nod. It gave them the look of a field of very high grass, through which, any one passing, leaves for the moment a trail, till all the heads bob up again into their places.",find entrance _very_ grander palace one aunt saloon step lead door wide shallow cover gold embroider carpet _looked_ prickly bare foot contrary trod feel softer softest moss see little carpet side step stand row row mandarin great deal grander pair aunt cabinet cuckoo hopp walk staircase turn row row begin nod give look field high grass one passing leave moment trail head bob place

But how _do_ you think they dressed her? It was all by nodding. They nodded to the blue and silver embroidered jacket, and in a moment it had fitted itself on to her. They nodded to the splendid scarlet satin skirt, made very short in front and very long behind, and before Griselda knew where she was, it was adjusted quite correctly. They nodded to the head-dress, and the sashes, and the necklaces and bracelets, and forthwith they all arranged themselves. Last of all, they nodded to the dearest, sweetest little pair of high-heeled shoes imaginable--all silver, and blue, and gold, and scarlet, and everything mixed up together, _only_ they were rather a stumpy shape about the toes, and Griselda's bare feet were encased in them, and, to her surprise, quite comfortably so.",mandariny look young lady porcelain face corner head dress step lead small ante room lay waiting magnificent dress see think dress nodd nod blue silver embroider jacket moment fit nod splendid scarlet satin skirt make short front know adjust nod head dress sashe necklace bracelet arrange last nod dearest sweetest little pair high heeled shoe imaginable silver blue gold scarlet mix stumpy shape toe bare foot encase surprise

He did not speak either, rather to her annoyance, but gravely led the way through one grand room after another to the grandest of all, where the entertainment was evidently just about to begin. And everywhere there were mandarins, rows and rows, who all set to work nodding as fast as Griselda appeared. She began to be rather tired of royal salutes, and was glad when, at last, in profound silence, the procession, consisting of the cuckoo and herself, and about half a dozen ""mandarins,"" came to a halt before a kind of daïs, or raised seat, at the end of the hall.",attendant nod turn see cuckoo wait speak annoyance lead way grand room grandest entertainment about begin be mandarin row row set work nodd appear begin tired royal salute glad last profound silence procession consist cuckoo mandarin come halt kind daï raise seat end hall

But the cuckoo did not reply; and before she had time to repeat the question, the very grand and grave person got down from his seat, and coming towards her, offered her his hand, at the same time nodding--first once, then two or three times together, then once again.

Griselda did not know what to do, when suddenly she felt something poking her head. It was the cuckoo--he had lifted his claw, and was tapping her head to make her nod. So she nodded--once, twice together, then once--that appeared to be enough.

If she did not know, her shoes or something about her did; for she got on famously. The music was lovely--""so the mandarins can't be deaf, though they are dumb,"" thought Griselda, ""which is one good thing about them."" The king seemed to enjoy it as much as she did, though he never smiled or laughed; any one could have seen he liked it by the way he whirled and twirled himself about. And between the figures, when they stopped to rest for a little, Griselda got on very well too.

Griselda was not a greedy child, but for once in her life she really _did_ feel rather so. I cannot possibly describe these delicious things; just think of whatever in all your life was the most ""lovely"" thing you ever eat, and you may be sure they tasted like that. Only the cuckoo would not eat any, which rather distressed Griselda. He walked about among the dancers, apparently quite at home; and the mandarins did not seem at all surprised to see him, though he did look rather odd, being nearly, if not quite, as big as any of them. Griselda hoped he was enjoying himself, considering that she had to thank him for all the fun _she_ was having, but she felt a little conscience-stricken when she saw that he wouldn't eat anything.",tiny little mandariny boy appear tray fill delicious fruit sweetmeat greedy child life feel describe delicious thing think life lovely thing eat sure taste cuckoo eat distress walk dancer home mandarin seem surprised see look odd big hope enjoy consider have thank fun _she_ have feel little conscience stricken see eat
