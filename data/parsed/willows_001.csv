1,CHAPTER I. THE RIVER BANK,bank 
2,"The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, said ‘Bother!’ and ‘O blow!’ and also ‘Hang spring-cleaning!’ and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat. Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the gavelled carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, ‘Up we go! Up we go!’ till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.",work morning spring clean little home broom duster ladder step chair brush pail whitewash have dust throat eye splashe whitewash black fur ach back weary arm spring move air earth penetrate dark lowly little house spirit divine discontent longing small wonder flung brush floor say bother blow hang spring cleaning bolt house wait put coat call make steep little tunnel answer case gavell carriage drive own animal residence nearer sun air scrape scratch scrabble scrooge scrooge scrabble scratch scrape work little paw mutter go go last pop snout come sunlight find roll warm grass great meadow 
3,"‘This is fine!’ he said to himself. ‘This is better than whitewashing!’ The sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout. Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.",fine say good whitewashing sunshine strike hot fur soft breeze caress heat brow seclusion cellarage live carol happy bird fall dull hearing shout jump leg joy living delight spring cleaning pursue way meadow reach hedge further side 
4,"‘Hold up!’ said an elderly rabbit at the gap. ‘Sixpence for the privilege of passing by the private road!’ He was bowled over in an instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly from their holes to see what the row was about. ‘Onion-sauce! Onion-sauce!’ he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could think of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started grumbling at each other. ‘How STUPID you are! Why didn’t you tell him----’ ‘Well, why didn’t YOU say----’ ‘You might have reminded him----’ and so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much too late, as is always the case.",hold say elderly rabbit gap privilege pass private road bowl instant impatient contemptuous trotet side hedge chaff other rabbit peep hole see row sauce sauce remark gone think satisfactory reply start grumble other stupid tell say remind usual way course late case 
5,"It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the copses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves thrusting--everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering ‘whitewash!’ he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other fellows busy working.",seem good true meadow ramble hedgerow copse find bird building flower budding leave thrust happy progressive occupy have uneasy conscience prick whisper whitewash feel jolly only idle dog busy citizen good part holiday much rest see other fellow busy work 
6,"He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver--glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.",think happiness complete meander stand edge full feed river life see river sleek sinuous full bodied animal chase chuckle grip thing gurgle leave laugh fling fresh playmate shake free catch hold shake shiver glint gleam sparkle rustle swirl chatter bubble bewitch entrance fascinate side river trotet trot small side man hold spell bind exciting story tired last sit bank river chatter babble procession good story world send heart earth tell last insatiable sea 
7,"As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the bank opposite, just above the water’s edge, caught his eye, and dreamily he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would make for an animal with few wants and fond of a bijou riverside residence, above flood level and remote from noise and dust. As he gazed, something bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it, vanished, then twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could hardly be a star in such an unlikely situation; and it was too glittering and small for a glow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at him, and so declared itself to be an eye; and a small face began gradually to grow up round it, like a frame round a picture.",sit grass look river dark hole bank water edge catch eye fall consider nice snug dwelling place make animal few want fond bijou riverside residence flood level remote noise dust gaze bright small seem twinkle heart vanish twinkle tiny star star unlikely situation glittering small glow worm look wink declare eye small face begin grow frame picture

17,"The Rat said nothing, but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled on it; then lightly stepped into a little boat which the Mole had not observed. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just the size for two animals; and the Mole’s whole heart went out to it at once, even though he did not yet fully understand its uses.",say stoop unfasten rope haul step little boat observe paint blue outside white size animal whole heart go understand use 
18,"The Rat sculled smartly across and made fast. Then he held up his forepaw as the Mole stepped gingerly down. ‘Lean on that!’ he said. ‘Now then, step lively!’ and the Mole to his surprise and rapture found himself actually seated in the stern of a real boat.",scull make hold forepaw step lean say step surprise rapture find seat stern real boat

22,"‘Nice? It’s the ONLY thing,’ said the Water Rat solemnly, as he leant forward for his stroke. ‘Believe me, my young friend, there is NOTHING--absolute nothing--half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.

25,"‘--about in boats--or WITH boats,’ the Rat went on composedly, picking himself up with a pleasant laugh. ‘In or out of ‘em, it doesn’t matter. Nothing seems really to matter, that’s the charm of it. Whether you get away, or whether you don’t; whether you arrive at your destination or whether you reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at all, you’re always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and when you’ve done it there’s always something else to do, and you can do it if you like, but you’d much better not.

He looped the painter through a ring in his landing-stage, climbed up into his hole above, and after a short interval reappeared staggering under a fat, wicker luncheon-basket.",hold hard minute say loop painter ring landing stage climb hole short interval reappear staggering fat wicker luncheon basket

33,"The Mole never heard a word he was saying. Absorbed in the new life he was entering upon, intoxicated with the sparkle, the ripple, the scents and the sounds and the sunlight, he trailed a paw in the water and dreamed long waking dreams. The Water Rat, like the good little fellow he was, sculled steadily on and forebore to disturb him.",hear word say absorb new life enter intoxicate sparkle ripple scent sound sunlight trail paw water dream long wake dream good little fellow scull forebore disturb

It’s my world, and I don’t want any other. What it hasn’t got is not worth having, and what it doesn’t know is not worth knowing. Lord! the times we’ve had together! Whether in winter or summer, spring or autumn, it’s always got its fun and its excitements. When the floods are on in February, and my cellars and basement are brimming with drink that’s no good to me, and the brown water runs by my best bedroom window; or again when it all drops away and, shows patches of mud that smells like plum-cake, and the rushes and weed clog the channels, and I can potter about dry shod over most of the bed of it and find fresh food to eat, and things careless people have dropped out of boats!’",say brother sister aunt company food drink washing world want other get worth have know worth know lord time have winter summer spring autumn get fun excitement flood cellar basement brim drink good brown water run good bedroom window drop show patch mud smell plum cake rushe weed clog channel potter dry shod most bed find fresh food eat thing careless person drop boat

40,"‘No one else to--well, I mustn’t be hard on you,’ said the Rat with forbearance. ‘You’re new to it, and of course you don’t know. The bank is so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether: O no, it isn’t what it used to be, at all.

44,"‘W-e-ll,’ replied the Rat, ‘let me see. The squirrels are all right. AND the rabbits--some of ‘em, but rabbits are a mixed lot. And then there’s Badger, of course.

50,"‘Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World,’ said the Rat. ‘And that’s something that doesn’t matter, either to you or me. I’ve never been there, and I’m never going, nor you either, if you’ve got any sense at all. Don’t ever refer to it again, please. Now then!

Green turf sloped down to either edge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals.

52,"The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket. The Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, ‘O my! O my!’ at each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, ‘Now, pitch in, old fellow!’ and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had started his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people WILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days ago.",bring boat bank make help awkward swing luncheon basket begg favour allow unpack pleased indulge sprawl full length grass rest excited friend shake table cloth spread take mysterious packet arrange content due order gasp fresh revelation ready say pitch old fellow glad obey start spring clean early hour morning person do pause bite sup great deal distant time seem many day

Last year it was house-boating, and we all had to go and stay with him in his house-boat, and pretend we liked it. He was going to spend the rest of his life in a house-boat.

But the Mole was bent on enjoying everything, and although just when he had got the basket packed and strapped up tightly he saw a plate staring up at him from the grass, and when the job had been done again the Rat pointed out a fork which anybody ought to have seen, and last of all, behold! the mustard pot, which he had been sitting on without knowing it--still, somehow, the thing got finished at last, without much loss of temper.",pack basket such pleasant work unpack basket bend enjoy get basket pack strapp see plate stare grass job do point fork see last behold mustard pot sit know thing finish last much loss temper 
80,"The afternoon sun was getting low as the Rat sculled gently homewards in a dreamy mood, murmuring poetry-things over to himself, and not paying much attention to Mole. But the Mole was very full of lunch, and self-satisfaction, and pride, and already quite at home in a boat (so he thought) and was getting a bit restless besides: and presently he said, ‘Ratty!

82,"The Mole was quiet for a minute or two. But he began to feel more and more jealous of Rat, sculling so strongly and so easily along, and his pride began to whisper that he could do it every bit as well. He jumped up and seized the sculls, so suddenly, that the Rat, who was gazing out over the water and saying more poetry-things to himself, was taken by surprise and fell backwards off his seat with his legs in the air for the second time, while the triumphant Mole took his place and grabbed the sculls with entire confidence.",quiet minute begin feel jealous scull pride begin whisper do bit jump seize scull gaze water say more poetry thing take surprise fall seat leg air second time triumphant take place grab scull entire confidence

How bright and welcome the sun looked as he rose to the surface coughing and spluttering! How black was his despair when he felt himself sinking again!

I am very sorry indeed for my foolish and ungrateful conduct. My heart quite fails me when I think how I might have lost that beautiful luncheon-basket. Indeed, I have been a complete ass, and I know it.

I really think you had better come and stop with me for a little time. It’s very plain and rough, you know--not like Toad’s house at all--but you haven’t seen that yet; still, I can make you comfortable.

92,"The Mole was so touched by his kind manner of speaking that he could find no voice to answer him; and he had to brush away a tear or two with the back of his paw. But the Rat kindly looked in another direction, and presently the Mole’s spirits revived again, and he was even able to give some straight back-talk to a couple of moorhens who were sniggering to each other about his bedraggled appearance.",touch kind manner speak find voice answer have brush tear back paw look direction spirit revive able give straight talk couple moorhen snigger other bedraggled appearance 
93,"When they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour, and planted the Mole in an arm-chair in front of it, having fetched down a dressing-gown and slippers for him, and told him river stories till supper-time. Very thrilling stories they were, too, to an earth-dwelling animal like Mole.
