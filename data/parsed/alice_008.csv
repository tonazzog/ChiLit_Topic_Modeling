2,"A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, ‘Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!’",large rose tree stand entrance garden rose grow white be gardener paint red think curious thing go watch come hear say look go splash paint

8,"‘Yes, it IS his business!’ said Five, ‘and I’ll tell him--it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.’",business say tell bring cook tulip root onion 
9,"Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun ‘Well, of all the unjust things--’ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.",flung brush begin unjust thing eye chance fall stand watch check other look bow low 
10,"‘Would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are painting those roses?’",tell say little paint rose 
11,"Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, ‘Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to--’ At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out ‘The Queen! The Queen!’ and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",say look begin low voice fact see red rose tree put white one mistake find have head cut know see do good come moment look garden call gardener throw flat face be sound many footstep look eager see 
12,"First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",come soldier carry club shape gardener oblong flat hand foot corner courtier ornament diamond walk soldier come royal child be little dear come jump hand hand couple ornament heart come guest recognise white talk hurry nervous manner smile say go notice follow carry crown crimson velvet cushion last grand procession come king queen hearts 
13,"Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of a procession,’ thought she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ So she stood still where she was, and waited.",doubtful lie face gardener remember hear rule procession use procession think person have lie face see stand wait 
14,"When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely ‘Who is this?’ She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",procession come stop look say say bow smile reply 
15,"‘Idiot!’ said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, ‘What’s your name, child?’",idiot say toss head turn go name child 
16,"‘My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,’ said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, ‘Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’",name say add pack card afraid 
17,"‘And who are THESE?’ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.",say point gardener lie rosetree see lie face pattern back same rest pack tell gardener soldier courtier own child 
18,"‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. ‘It’s no business of MINE.’",know say surprise own courage business

20,"‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.",nonsense say silent

23,"The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.",foot

26,"‘May it please your Majesty,’ said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, ‘we were trying--’",say humble tone go knee speak try 
27,"‘I see!’ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. ‘Off with their heads!’ and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.",see say examine rose head procession move soldier remain execute unfortunate gardener run protection 
28,"‘You shan’t be beheaded!’ said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.",behead say put large flower pot stand soldier wander minute look march other

32,"The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.",soldier silent look question mean 
33,‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.,shout 
34,"‘Come on, then!’ roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.",come roar join procession wonder happen 
35,"‘It’s--it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",fine day say timid voice side walk white peep face 
36,"‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘--where’s the Duchess?’",say 
37,"‘Hush! Hush!’ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered ‘She’s under sentence of execution.’",say low hurry tone look shoulder speak raise tiptoe put mouth close ear whisper sentence execution

You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said--’",box ear begin give little scream laughter whisper frighten tone hear see come say 
42,"‘Get to your places!’ shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",get place shout voice thunder person begin run direction tumble other settle minute game begin think see curious croquet ground life ridge furrow ball live hedgehog mallet live flamingoe soldier have double stand hand foot make arche 
43,"The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",chief difficulty find first manage flamingo succeed get body tuck arm leg hang get neck straighten go give hedgehog blow head twist look face puzzle expression help burst laugh get head go begin provoking find hedgehog unroll act crawl be ridge furrow way want send hedgehog double soldier get walk other part ground come conclusion difficult game 
44,"The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her head!’ about once in a minute.",player play wait turn quarrell while fight hedgehog short time furious passion go stamp shouting head head minute 
45,"Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, ‘and then,’ thought she, ‘what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one left alive!’",begin feel uneasy sure have dispute know happen minute think become fond behead person great wonder be one leave alive 
46,"She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself ‘It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.’",look way escape wonder get see notice curious appearance air puzzle first watch minute make grin say cat have talk 
47,"‘How are you getting on?’ said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.",get say cat be mouth speak 
48,"Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. ‘It’s no use speaking to it,’ she thought, ‘till its ears have come, or at least one of them.’ In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",wait eye appear nod use speak think ear come least minute whole head appear put flamingo begin account game feel glad have listen cat seem think be enough sight more appear 
49,"‘I don’t think they play at all fairly,’ Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, ‘and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak--and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!’",think play begin complain tone quarrel hear speak seem have rule particular least be attend have idea confusing thing alive instance be arch get go next walking other end ground croquet hedgehog run see come 
50,‘How do you like the Queen?’ said the Cat in a low voice.,like say cat low voice 
51,"‘Not at all,’ said Alice: ‘she’s so extremely--’ Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, ‘--likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.’",say notice close listen go likely win worth finish game 
52,The Queen smiled and passed on.,smile pass 
53,"‘Who ARE you talking to?’ said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.",talk say go look cat head great curiosity 
54,"‘It’s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,’ said Alice: ‘allow me to introduce it.’",friend cat say allow introduce

58,"‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice. ‘I’ve read that in some book, but I don’t remember where.’",cat look king say read book remember 
59,"‘Well, it must be removed,’ said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, ‘My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!’",remove say call pass moment dear wish have cat remove 
60,"The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. ‘Off with his head!’ she said, without even looking round.",have way settle difficulty great small head say look 
61,"‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.",fetch executioner say hurry 
62,"Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.",think go see game go hear voice distance scream passion hear sentence player execute miss turn like look thing game such confusion know turn go search hedgehog 
63,"The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",hedgehog engage fight hedgehog seem excellent opportunity croquet other only difficulty flamingo go other side garden see try helpless sort way fly tree 
64,"By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: ‘but it doesn’t matter much,’ thought Alice, ‘as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.’ So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.",time catch flamingo bring fight hedgehog sight matter much think arche gone side ground tuck arm escape go little more conversation friend 
65,"When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",get surprise find large crowd collect be dispute go executioner talk rest silent look uncomfortable 
66,"The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.",moment appear appeal settle question repeat argument speak find hard make say 
67,"The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at HIS time of life.",executioner argument cut head be body cut have do thing go begin time life 
68,"The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.",argument have head behead talk nonsense 
69,"The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)",argument do less time have execute last remark make whole party look grave anxious 
70,Alice could think of nothing else to say but ‘It belongs to the Duchess: you’d better ask HER about it.’,think else say belong ask 
71,"‘She’s in prison,’ the Queen said to the executioner: ‘fetch her here.’ And the executioner went off like an arrow.",prison say executioner fetch executioner go arrow 
72," The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.",cat head begin fade moment gone time come disappear executioner run look rest party go game
