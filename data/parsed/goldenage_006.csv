2,"A belt of rhododendrons grew close down to one side of our pond; and along the edge of it many things flourished rankly. If you crept through the undergrowth and crouched by the water’s rim, it was easy--if your imagination were in healthy working order--to transport yourself in a trice to the heart of a tropical forest. Overhead the monkeys chattered, parrots flashed from bough to bough, strange large blossoms shone around you, and the push and rustle of great beasts moving unseen thrilled you deliciously. And if you lay down with your nose an inch or two from the water, it was not long ere the old sense of proportion vanished clean away. The glittering insects that darted to and fro on its surface became sea-monsters dire, the gnats that hung above them swelled to albatrosses, and the pond itself stretched out into a vast inland sea, whereon a navy might ride secure, and whence at any moment the hairy scalp of a sea serpent might be seen to emerge.",belt rhododendron grow side pond edge many thing flourish creep undergrowth crouch water rim easy imagination healthy working order transport trice heart tropical forest overhead monkey chatter parrot flash bough bough strange large blossom shine push rustle great beast move unseen thrill lay nose inch water long old sense proportion vanish clean glitter insect dart for surface become sea monster dire gnat hang swell albatross pond stretch vast inland sea navy ride secure moment hairy scalp sea serpent see emerge 
3,"It is impossible, however, to play at tropical forests properly, when homely accents of the human voice intrude; and all my hopes of seeing a tiger seized by a crocodile while drinking (vide picture-books, passim) vanished abruptly, and earth resumed her old dimensions, when the sound of Charlotte’s prattle somewhere hard by broke in on my primeval seclusion. Looking out from the bushes, I saw her trotting towards an open space of lawn the other side the pond, chattering to herself in her accustomed fashion, a doll tucked under either arm, and her brow knit with care. Propping up her double burden against a friendly stump, she sat down in front of them, as full of worry and anxiety as a Chancellor on a Budget night.",impossible play tropical forest homely accent human voice intrude hope see tiger seize crocodile drink vide picture book passim vanish earth resume old dimension sound prattle break primeval seclusion look bush see trot open space lawn other side pond chatter accustom fashion doll tuck arm brow knit care propp double burden friendly stump sit front full worry anxiety chancellor budget night 
4,"Her victims, who stared resignedly in front of them, were recognisable as Jerry and Rosa. Jerry hailed from far Japan: his hair was straight and black; his one garment cotton, of a simple blue; and his reputation was distinctly bad. Jerome was his proper name, from his supposed likeness to the holy man who hung in a print on the staircase; though a shaven crown was the only thing in common ‘twixt Western saint and Eastern sinner. Rosa was typical British, from her flaxen poll to the stout calves she displayed so liberally, and in character she was of the blameless order of those who have not yet been found out.",victim stare front recognisable hail hair straight black garment cotton simple blue reputation bad proper name suppose likeness holy man hang print staircase shaven crown only thing common twixt western saint eastern sinner typical british flaxen poll stout calve display character blameless order find 
5,"I suspected Jerry from the first; there was a latent devilry in his slant eyes as he sat there moodily, and knowing what he was capable of I scented trouble in store for Charlotte. Rosa I was not so sure about; she sat demurely and upright, and looked far away into the tree-tops in a visionary, world-forgetting sort of way; yet the prim purse of her mouth was somewhat overdone, and her eyes glittered unnaturally.",suspect first be latent devilry slant eye sit know capable scent trouble store sure sit upright look tree top visionary world forget sort way prim purse mouth overdo eye glitter 
6,"“Now, I’m going to begin where I left off,” said Charlotte, regardless of stops, and thumping the turf with her fist excitedly: “and you must pay attention, ‘cos this is a treat, to have a story told you before you’re put to bed. Well, so the White Rabbit scuttled off down the passage and Alice hoped he’d come back ‘cos he had a waistcoat on and her flamingo flew up a tree--but we haven’t got to that part yet--you must wait a minute, and--where had I got to?”",go begin leave say stop thump turf fist pay attention treat have story tell put bed white scuttle passage hope come have waistcoat flamingo fly tree get part wait minute get 
7,"Jerry only remained passive until Charlotte had got well under way, and then began to heel over quietly in Rosa’s direction. His head fell on her plump shoulder, causing her to start nervously.",remain passive get way begin heel direction head fall plump shoulder cause start 
8,"Charlotte seized and shook him with vigour, “O Jerry,” she cried piteously, “if you’re not going to be good, how ever shall I tell you my story?”",seize shake vigour cry go good tell story 
9,"Jerry’s face was injured innocence itself. “Blame if you like, Madam,”  he seemed to say, “the eternal laws of gravitation, but not a helpless puppet, who is also an orphan and a stranger in the land.”",face injure innocence blame like seem say eternal law gravitation helpless puppet orphan stranger land 
10,"“Now we’ll go on,” began Charlotte once more. “So she got into the garden at last--I’ve left out a lot, but you won’t care, I’ll tell you some other time--and they were all playing croquet, and that’s where the flamingo comes in, and the Queen shouted out, ‘Off with her head!’”",go begin more get garden last leave lot care tell other time play croquet flamingo come shout head 
11,"At this point Jerry collapsed forward, suddenly and completely, his bald pate between his knees. Charlotte was not very angry this time. The sudden development of tragedy in the story had evidently been too much for the poor fellow. She straightened him out, wiped his nose, and, after trying him in various positions, to which he refused to adapt himself, she propped him against the shoulder of the (apparently) unconscious Rosa. Then my eyes were opened, and the full measure of Jerry’s infamy became apparent. This, then, was what he had been playing up for. The fellow had designs. I resolved to keep him under close observation.",point collapse bald pate knee angry time sudden development tragedy story much poor fellow straighten wipe nose try various position refuse adapt proppe shoulder unconscious eye open full measure infamy become apparent play fellow have design resolve keep close observation 
12,"“If you’d been in the garden,” went on Charlotte, reproachfully, “and flopped down like that when the Queen said ‘Off with his head!’ she’d have offed with your head; but Alice wasn’t that sort of girl at all. She just said, ‘I’m not afraid of you, you’re nothing but a pack of cards’--oh, dear! I’ve got to the end already, and I hadn’t begun hardly! I never can make my stories last out! Never mind, I’ll tell you another one.”",garden go flop say head off head sort girl say afraid pack card dear get end begin make story last mind tell one 
13,"Jerry didn’t seem to care, now he had gained his end, whether the stories lasted out or not. He was nestling against Rosa’s plump form with a look of satisfaction that was simply idiotic; and one arm had disappeared from view--was it round her waist? Rosa’s natural blush seemed deeper than usual, her head inclined shyly--it must have been round her waist.",seem care gain end story last nestle plump form look satisfaction idiotic arm disappear view waist natural blush seem deep usual head inclined waist 
14,"“If it wasn’t so near your bedtime,” continued Charlotte, reflectively, “I’d tell you a nice story with a bogy in it. But you’d be frightened, and you’d dream of bogies all night. So I’ll tell you one about a White Bear, only you mustn’t scream when the bear says ‘Wow,’ like I used to, ‘cos he’s a good bear really--”",bedtime continue tell nice story bogy frighten dream bogie night tell white scream bear say use good bear 
15,"Here Rosa fell flat on her back in the deadest of faints. Her limbs were rigid, her eyes glassy; what had Jerry been doing? It must have been something very bad, for her to take on like that. I scrutinised him carefully, while Charlotte ran to comfort the damsel. He appeared to be whistling a tune and regarding the scenery. If I only possessed Jerry’s command of feature, I thought to myself, half regretfully, I would never be found out in anything.",fall flat back deadest faint limb rigid eye glassy do bad take scrutinise run comfort damsel appear whistle tune regard scenery possess command feature think half find 
16,"“It’s all your fault, Jerry,” said Charlotte, reproachfully, when the lady had been restored to consciousness: “Rosa’s as good as gold, except when you make her wicked. I’d put you in the corner, only a stump hasn’t got a corner--wonder why that is? Thought everything had corners. Never mind, you’ll have to sit with your face to the wall--SO. Now you can sulk if you like!”",fault say lady restore consciousness good gold make wicked put corner stump get corner wonder think have corner mind have sit face wall sulk like 
17,"Jerry seemed to hesitate a moment between the bliss of indulgence in sulks with a sense of injury, and the imperious summons of beauty waiting to be wooed at his elbow; then, carried away by his passion, he fell sideways across Rosa’s lap. One arm stuck stiffly upwards, as in passionate protestation; his amorous countenance was full of entreaty. Rosa hesitated--wavered--and yielded, crushing his slight frame under the weight of her full-bodied surrender.",seem hesitate moment bliss indulgence sulk sense injury imperious summons beauty wait wooe elbow carry passion fall lap arm stick passionate protestation amorous countenance full entreaty hesitate waver yield crush slight frame weight full bodied surrender 
18,"Charlotte had stood a good deal, but it was possible to abuse even her patience. Snatching Jerry from his lawless embraces, she reversed him across her knee, and then--the outrage offered to the whole superior sex in Jerry’s hapless person was too painful to witness; but though I turned my head away, the sound of brisk slaps continued to reach my tingling ears. When I looked again, Jerry was sitting up as before; his garment, somewhat crumpled, was restored to its original position; but his pallid countenance was set hard. Knowing as I did, only too well, what a volcano of passion and shame must be seething under that impassive exterior, for the moment I felt sorry for him.",stand good deal possible abuse patience snatch lawless embrace reverse knee outrage offer whole superior sex hapless person painful witness turn head sound brisk slap continue reach tingling ear look sit garment crumple restore original position pallid countenance set know volcano passion shame seethe impassive exterior moment feel sorry 
19,"Rosa’s face was still buried in her frock; it might have been shame, it might have been grief for Jerry’s sufferings. But the callous Japanese never even looked her way. His heart was exceeding bitter within him. In merely following up his natural impulses he had run his head against convention, and learnt how hard a thing it was; and the sunshiny world was all black to him.",face bury frock shame grief suffering callous look way heart exceed bitter follow natural impulse run head convention learn thing sunshiny world black 
20,"Even Charlotte softened somewhat at the sight of his rigid misery. “If you’ll say you’re sorry. Jerome,” she said, “I’ll say I’m sorry, too.”",soften sight rigid misery say sorry say say sorry 
21,"Jerry only dropped his shoulders against the stump and stared out in the direction of his dear native Japan, where love was no sin, and smacking had not been introduced. Why had he ever left it? He would go back to-morrow--and yet there were obstacles: another grievance. Nature, in endowing Jerry with every grace of form and feature, along with a sensitive soul, had somehow forgotten the gift of locomotion.",drop shoulder stump stare direction dear native love sin smack introduce leave go be obstacle grievance nature endow grace form feature sensitive soul forget gift locomotion 
22,"There was a crackling in the bushes behind me, with sharp short pants as of a small steam-engine, and Rollo, the black retriever, just released from his chain by some friendly hand, burst through the underwood, seeking congenial company. I joyfully hailed him to stop and be a panther; but he sped away round the pond, upset Charlotte with a boisterous caress, and seizing Jerry by the middle, disappeared with him down the drive. Charlotte raved, panting behind the swift-footed avenger of crime; Rosa lay dishevelled, bereft of consciousness; Jerry himself spread helpless arms to heaven, and I almost thought I heard a cry for mercy, a tardy promise of amendment; but it was too late. The Black Man had got Jerry at last; and though the tear of sensibility might moisten the eye, no one who really knew him could deny the justice of his fate.",be crackling bush sharp short pants small steam engine black retriever release chain friendly hand burst underwood seek congenial company hail stop panther spe pond upset boisterous caress seize middle disappear drive rave pant swift footed avenger crime lay dishevelled bereft consciousness spread helpless arm heaven think hear cry mercy tardy promise amendment late black get last tear sensibility moist eye know deny justice fate
