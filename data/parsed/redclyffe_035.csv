3," In the meantime the days passed at Recoara without much change for the better or worse. After the first week, Guy’s fever had diminished; his pulse was lower, the drowsiness ceased, and it seemed as if there was nothing to prevent absolute recovery. But though each morning seemed to bring improvement, it never lasted; the fever, though not high, could never be entirely reduced, and strength was perceptibly wasting, in spite of every means of keeping it up.",meantime day pass much change good bad first week guy fever diminish pulse low drowsiness cease seem be prevent absolute recovery morning seem bring improvement last fever high reduce strength waste spite means keep 
4,"There was not much positive suffering, very little even of headache, and he was cheerful, though speaking little, because he was told not to excite or exhaust himself. Languor and lassitude were the chief causes of discomfort; and as his strength failed, there came fits of exhaustion and oppression that tried him severely. At first, these were easily removed by stimulants; but remedies seemed to lose their effect, and the sinking was almost death-like.",be much positive suffering little headache cheerful speak little tell excite exhaust languor lassitude chief cause discomfort strength fail come fit exhaustion oppression try remove stimulant remedy seem lose effect sinking death 
5,"‘I think I could bear acute pain better!’ he said one day; and more than once the sigh broke from him almost unconsciously,--‘Oh for one breath of Redclyffe sea-wind!’ Indeed, it seemed as if the close air of the shut-in-valley, at the end of a long hot day was almost enough to overwhelm him, weak as he had become. Every morning, when Amabel let in the fresh breeze at the window, she predicted it would be a cool day, and do him good; every afternoon the wind abated, the sun shone full in, the room was stifling, the faintness came on, and after a few vain attempts at relieving it, Guy sighed that there was nothing for it but quiet, and Amy was obliged to acquiesce. As the sun set, the breeze sprung up, it became cooler, he fell asleep, awoke revived, was comfortable all the evening, and Amy left him at eleven or twelve, with hopes of his having a good night.",think bear acute pain good say day more sigh break breath wind seem close air shut valley end long hot day overwhelm weak become morning let fresh breeze window predict cool day do good afternoon wind abate sun shine full room stifling faintness come few vain attempt relieve guy sigh be quiet oblige acquiesce sun set breeze spring become cool fall asleep awoke revive comfortable evening leave hope have good night

19,"This cost her some pain, for it had been written in ignorance of even Philip’s illness, and detailed triumphantly the preparations at Redclyffe, hinting that they must send timely notice of their return, or they would disappoint the tenantry, who intended grand doings, and concluding with a short lecture on the inexpediency of lingering in foreign parts.",cost pain write ignorance illness detailed preparation hint send timely notice return disappoint tenantry intend grand doing conclude short lecture inexpediency linger foreign part 
20,"‘Poor Markham,’ said Guy.",poor say guy 
21,"She understood; but these things did not come on her like a shock now, for he had been saying them more or less ever since the beginning of his illness; and fully occupied as she was, she never opened her mind to the future.

27,"She gazed at him without answering. If there had been any struggle to retain him, it would have been repressed by his calmness; but the thought had not come on her suddenly, it was more like an inevitable fate seen at first at a distance, and gradually advancing upon her. She had never fastened on the hope of his recovery, and it had dwindled in an almost imperceptible manner. She kept watch over him, and followed his thoughts, without stretching her mind to suppose herself living without him; and was supported by the forgetfulness of self, which gave her no time to realize her feelings.",gaze answer be struggle retain repress calmness thought come inevitable fate see first distance advance fasten hope recovery dwindle imperceptible manner keep watch follow thought stretch mind suppose live support forgetfulness self give time realize feeling 
28,"‘I should like to have seen Redclyffe bay again,’ said Guy, after a space. ‘Now that mamma is coming, that is the one thing. I suppose I had set my heart on it, for it comes back to me how I reckoned on standing on that rock with you, feeling the wind, hearing the surge, looking at the meeting of earth and sky, and the train of sunlight.’ He spoke slowly, pausing between each recollection,--‘You will see it some day,’ he added. ‘But I must give it up; it is earth after all, and looking back.’",like see say space mamma come thing suppose set heart come reckon stand rock feel wind hear surge look meeting earth sky train sunlight speak pause recollection see day add give earth look 
29,"Through the evening, he seemed to be dwelling on thoughts of his own, and only spoke to tell her of some message to friends at Redclyffe, or Hollywell, to mention little Marianne Dixon, or some other charge that he wished to leave. She thought he had mentioned almost every one with whom he had had any interchange of kindness at either of his homes, even to old nurse at Hollywell, remembering them all with quiet pleasure. At half-past eleven, he sent her to bed, and she went submissively, cheered by thinking him likely to sleep.",evening seem dwelling thought own speak tell message friend mention little other charge wish leave think mention one have interchange kindness home old nurse remember quiet pleasure half send bed go cheer think likely sleep 
30,"As soon as she could conscientiously call the night over, she returned to him, and was received with one of the sweet, sunny, happy looks that had always been his peculiar charm, and, of late, had acquired an expression almost startling from their very beauty and radiance. It was hardly to be termed a smile, for there was very little, if any, movement of the lips, it was more like the reflection of some glory upon the whole countenance.",call night return receive sweet sunny happy look peculiar charm late acquire expression startling very beauty radiance term smile be little movement lip reflection glory whole countenance

41,"He broke off to take what Amabel was preparing for him, and she felt his pulse. There was fever still, which probably supplied the place of strength, for he said he was very comfortable, and his eyes were as bright as ever; but the beats were weak and fluttering, and a thrill crossed her that it might be near; but she must attend to him, and could not think.",break take prepare feel pulse be fever supply place strength say comfortable eye bright beat weak flutter thrill cross attend think

45,"Philip had, the last two mornings, risen in time to breakfast with Amabel, in the room adjoining his own; he was still very weak, and attempted no more than crossing the room, and sitting in the balcony to enjoy the evening air. He had felt the heat of the weather severely, and had been a good deal thrown back by his fatigue and agitation the day he wrote the letter, while also anxiety for Guy was retarding his progress, though he only heard the best side of his condition. Besides all this, his repentance both for his conduct with regard to Laura and the hard measure he had dealt to Guy was pressing on him increasingly; and the warm feelings, hardened and soured by early disappointment, regained their force, and grew into a love and admiration that made it still more horrible to perceive that he had acted ungenerously towards his cousin.",last morning rise time breakfast room adjoin own weak attempt more cross room sit balcony enjoy evening air feel heat weather good deal throw fatigue agitation day write letter anxiety retard progress hear good side condition repentance conduct regard hard measure deal press warm feeling harden soure early disappointment regain force grow love admiration make horrible perceive act cousin 
46,"When he heard of Guy’s desire to see him, he was pleased, said he was quite able to walk up-stairs, had been thinking of offering to help her by sitting with him, and was very glad to hear he was well enough to wish for a visit. She saw she must prepare him for what the conversation was likely to be.",hear desire see pleased say able walk stair think offer help sit glad hear wish visit see prepare conversation likely

54,"He found mounting the stairs harder than he had expected, and, with aching knees and gasping breath, at length reached the sitting-room, where Amabel was ready to pity him, and made him rest on the sofa till he had fully recovered. She then conducted him in; and his first glance gave him infinite relief, for he saw far less change than was still apparent in himself. Guy’s face was at all times too thin to be capable of losing much of its form, and as he was liable to be very much tanned, the brown, fixed on his face by the sunshine of his journey had not gone off, and a slight flush on his cheeks gave him his ordinary colouring; his beautiful hazel eyes were more brilliant than ever; and though the hand he held out was hot and wasted, Philip could not think him nearly as ill as he had been himself, and was ready to let him talk as he pleased. He was reassured, too, by his bright smile, and the strength of his voice, as he spoke a few playful words of welcome and congratulation. Amy set a chair, and with a look to remind Philip to be cautious, glided into her own room, leaving the door open, so as to see and hear all that passed, for they were not fit to be left absolutely alone together.",find mount stair hard expect ach knee gasp breath length reach sitting room ready pity make rest sofa recover conduct first glance give infinite relief see less change apparent guy face time thin capable lose much form liable tann brown fix face sunshine journey go slight flush cheek give ordinary colouring beautiful hazel eye brilliant hand hold hot waste think ill ready let talk pleased reassure bright smile strength voice speak few playful word welcome congratulation set chair look remind cautious glide own room leave door open see hear pass fit leave alone

64,"‘Amy has a list of the old people who have had so much a week, or their cottages rent-free,’ said Guy. ‘If it comes to you, you will not let them feel the difference? And don’t turn off the old keeper Brown; he is of no use, but it would kill him. And Ben Robinson, who was so brave in the shipwreck, a little notice now and then would keep him straight.

I can’t leave him money, it would only be a temptation; but will you keep an eye on him, and let Amy rely on you to tell her when to help him I can’t ask any one else, and she cannot do it for herself; but you would do it well.

69,"Another silence followed; after which Guy said, smiling with his natural playfulness, ‘One thing more. You are the lawyer of the family, and I want a legal opinion. I have been making Arnaud write my will. I have wished Miss Wellwood of St. Mildred’s to have some money for a sisterhood she wants to establish. Now, should I leave it to herself or name trustees?’",silence follow say smile natural playfulness thing more lawyer family want legal opinion make write will wish have money sisterhood want establish leave name trustee

72,‘Yes. I was not at liberty to--’,liberty -.m.

76,"As he spoke there was a knock at the door, and, with the instinctive dread of being found in his present posture, Philip sprang to his feet. Amabel went to the door, and was told that the physician was down-stairs with two gentlemen; and a card was given her, on which she read the name of an English clergyman.",speak knock door instinctive dread find present posture spring foot go door tell physician stair gentleman card give read name english clergyman 
77,"‘There, again!’ said Guy. ‘Everything comes to me. Now it is all quite right.’",say guy come right 
78,"Amabel was to go and speak to them, and Guy would see Mr. Morris, the clergyman, as soon as the physician had made his visit. ‘You must not go down,’ he then said to Philip. ‘You will wait in the sitting-room, won’t you? We shall want you again, you know,’ and his calm brightness was a contrast to Philip’s troubled look. ‘All is clear between us now,’ he added, as Philip turned away.",go speak guy see clergyman physician make visit go say wait sitting room want know calm brightness contrast trouble look clear add turn 
79,"Long ago, letters had been written to Venice, begging that if an English clergyman should travel that way he might be told how earnestly his presence was requested; this was the first who had answered the summons. He was a very young man, much out of health, and travelling under the care of a brother, who was in great dread of his doing anything to injure himself. Amabel soon perceived that, though kind and right-minded, he could not help them, except as far as his office was concerned. He was very shy, only just in priest’s orders; he told her he had never had this office to perform before, and seemed almost to expect her to direct him; while his brother was so afraid of his over-exerting himself, that she could not hope he would take charge of Philip.",letter write begg english clergyman travel way tell presence request first answer summons young man health travel care brother great dread do injure perceive kind right minded help office concerned shy priest order tell have office perform seem expect direct brother afraid over exert hope take charge 
80,"However, after the physician had seen Guy, she brought Mr. Morris to him, and came forward, or remained in her room, according as she was wanted. She thought her husband’s face was at each moment acquiring more unearthly beauty, and feeling with him, she was raised above thought or sensation of personal sorrow.",physician see bring come remain room accord want think husband face moment acquire unearthly beauty feel raise thought sensation personal sorrow 
81,"When the first part of the service was over, and she exchanged a few words, out of Guy’s hearing, with Mr. Morris, he said to her, as from the very fullness of his heart, ‘One longs to humble oneself to him. How it puts one to shame to hear such repentance with such a confession!’",first part service exchange few word hearing say very fullness heart long humble put shame hear such repentance confession 
82,"The time came when Philip was wanted. Amabel had called in Anne and the clergyman’s brother, and went to fetch her cousin.

91,"The rite was over, and stillness succeeded the low tones, while all knelt in their places. Amabel arose first, for Guy, though serene, looked greatly exhausted, and as she sprinkled him with vinegar, the others stood up. Guy looked for Philip, and held out his hand. Whether it was his gentle force, or of Philip’s own accord Amabel could not tell; but as he lay with that look of perfect peace and love, Philip bent down over him and kissed his forehead.",rite stillness succeed low tone knolt place arise serene look exhaust sprinkle vinegar other stand guy look hold hand gentle force own accord tell lay look perfect peace love bend kiss forehead

Very low and unequal, she was told: his strength was failing, and there seemed to be no power of rallying it, but they must do their best to support him with cordials, according to the state of his pulse.

After some little time, he spoke again. ‘My love to Charlie--and Laura--and Charlotte, my brother and sisters. How kindly they have made me one of them! I need not ask Charlotte to take care of Bustle, and your father will ride Deloraine. My love to him, and earnest thanks, for you above all, Amy. And dear mamma! I must look now to meeting her in a brighter world; but tell her how I have felt all her kindness since I first came in my strangeness and grief.

106,"He was again silent, as in contemplation, and Amabel’s overcoming emotion had been calmed and chastened down again, now that it was no longer herself that was spoken of. Both were still, and he seemed to sleep a little. When next he spoke, it was to ask if she could repeat their old favourite lines in “Sintram”.

111,"There was something in his perfect happiness that would not let her grieve, though a dull heavy sense of consternation was growing on her. So it went on through the night--not a long, nor a dreary one--but more like a dream. He dozed and woke, said a few tranquil words, and listened to some prayer, psalm, or verse, then slept again, apparently without suffering, except when he tried to take the cordials, and this he did with such increasing difficulty, that she hardly knew how to bear to cause him so much pain, though it was the last lingering hope.

She knew not the exact moment, but even as she said ‘Amen’ she perceived it was over. The soul was with Him with whom dwell the spirits of just men made perfect; and there lay the earthly part with a smile on the face. She closed the dark fringed eyelids--saw him look more beautiful than in sleep--then, laying her face down on the bed, she knelt on. She took no heed of time, no heed of aught that was earthly.
