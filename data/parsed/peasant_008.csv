1,CHAPTER 4. LAST NIGHT AT VERSAILLES.,chapter last night 
2,"From this day forward the king met with insults whichever way he turned,--even at the doors of his own apartments.  It was resolved by the National Assembly that all the men in France should be armed and wear a uniform, and be called the National Guard.  One day the Dauphin's footmen all appeared in this uniform, and the king's porters, and almost every man about the palace.  What displeased the king yet more was, that the singers in the royal chapel appeared in the same dress.  It was absurd and shocking to see their part of divine service performed by men in the uniform of grenadiers.  The king said so, and forbade that any person should appear in his presence again in that dress.  But the time was past for the king's orders to be obeyed.  He was destined to grow weary enough of the sight of this uniform.",day king meet insult way turn door own apartment resolve national man armed wear uniform call national day footmen appear uniform king porter man palace displease king more singer royal chapel appear same dress absurd shocking see part divine service perform man uniform grenadier king say forbid person appear presence dress time past king order obey destine grow weary sight uniform 
3,"A great part of the king's own guard had joined the revolutionary party; but one company remained, whose commanding officer was proud of their loyalty, and declared he could answer for its continuance.  He was mistaken, however.  One morning, at the end of July, when the royal family rose and looked out from their windows, they did not see a single sentinel anywhere about the palace.  Such a sight had never been witnessed before as the palace of Versailles without a guard.  On inquiry, it turned out that the whole company had marched away in the night, to join their former comrades in Paris.",great part king own guard join revolutionary party company remain commanding officer proud loyalty declare answer continuance mistaken morning end royal family rise look window see single sentinel palace sight witness palace guard inquiry turn whole company march night join former comrade 
4,"During the month of August, crowds had at various times assembled in Paris, with the declared purpose of going to Versailles, to separate the king from his bad advisers, and to bring the little Dauphin to Paris, to be brought up better than he was likely to be at home.  One would think that such assemblages and such declarations would alarm the king and queen, and cause them to make some preparations for putting themselves, or at least the Dauphin, in safety.  Because these crowds were several times dispersed, however, the royal family appear to have thought nothing of the danger: and in September they committed an act of imprudence which brought upon them the worst that was threatened.  The truth is, they were ignorant of all that it most concerned them to know. They did not understand the wants of the people, nor the depth of their discontent; nor had they any idea of the weakness, ignorance, and prejudice of the gentlemen and ladies about them, whose advice they asked, and on whose narrow views they acted.  There were a few wise and good men in the nation who understood both sides of the question, and who were grieved for the hardships of the people, and for the sufferings of the royal family; and happy would it have been for all if the king and queen could have been guided by these advisers.  The chief and best of these was that excellent patriot and loyal subject the Marquis Lafayette.  While he was adored by the people, he did all in his power to aid and save the royal family; but, unhappily, the king distrusted him, and the queen could not endure him.  She not only detested his politics, but declared that she believed him (the most honourable man in the world) to be a traitor, and laid on him the blame of misfortunes which he had no hand in causing, and for which he grieved.",month crowd have various time assemble declare purpose go separate king bad adviser bring little bring good likely home think such assemblage such declaration alarm king queen cause make preparation put least safety crowd several time disperse royal family appear think danger commit act imprudence bring bad threaten truth ignorant concern know understand want person depth discontent have idea weakness ignorance prejudice gentleman lady advice ask narrow view act be few wise good man nation understand side question grieve hardship person suffering royal family happy king queen guide adviser chief good excellent patriot loyal subject adore person do power aid save royal family king distrust queen endure detest politics declare believe honourable man world traitor lay blame misfortune have hand cause grieve 
5,"The king had a regiment from Flanders on whom he was sure he could rely. It came into some one's head that if this regiment and the faithless body-guard could be brought together, the loyalty of the latter might be revived and secured.  So there was an entertainment given in the theatre of the palace of Versailles, where the soldiers of the two regiments were to make merry, sitting alternately at table.  Such a feast, if every man there was loyal in the extreme, could signify little, while there was out of doors a whole rebellious nation,--millions of hungry wretches clamouring for food and good government; and, whether such a meeting signified much or little, it was certain that the king and his family, should have had nothing to do with it, after he had been to Paris to assure the people of his reliance upon them, assuming their cockade as a declaration that he was in earnest.",king have regiment sure rely come one head regiment faithless body guard bring loyalty latter revive secure be entertainment give theatre palace soldier regiment make merry sit table feast man loyal extreme signify little be door whole rebellious nation million hungry wretche clamoure food good government meeting signify much little certain king family have do assure person reliance assume cockade declaration earnest 
6,"The friends of the royal family thought this,--even the queen's own ladies.  One of them was requested by the queen to enter the theatre, and observe what passed, in order to report it to the king and her. What was the surprise of this lady, when in the midst of the entertainment, the doors were thrown open, and their majesties appeared, the queen having the Dauphin in her arms!  The sight of them, looking gratified and trustful, roused all the loyalty of the soldiers present; and some imprudent acts were done.  The queen's ladies handed white cockades to the officers; the party drank the healths of the king and queen, omitting that of the nation; they cheered the loyal air, ""O, Richard!  O my king, the world is all forsaking thee:"" and the whole company were presently in a delirium of hope, and of defiance of the people of Paris.  The queen afterwards declared in public that she was delighted with the Thursday's entertainment; and this set the people inquiring what had delighted her so much.  They made many inquiries. ""Why was this Flanders regiment brought to Versailles?""",friend royal family think queen own lady request queen enter theatre observe pass order report king surprise lady midst entertainment door throw open majesty appear queen have arm sight look gratified trustful rouse loyalty soldier present imprudent act do queen lady hand white cockade officer party drink health king queen omit nation cheer loyal air king world forsake whole company delirium hope defiance person queen declare public delighted entertainment set person inquire delight make many inquiry regiment bring 
7,"""How did it happen that the king had at present double the usual number of his Swiss guards?""",happen king have present usual number swiss guard 
8,"""Where were all those foreign officers from, who were seen in the streets in strange uniforms?""  The people, exasperated afresh by finding that, though the harvest was over, there was still a scarcity of bread, were in a temper to believe the worst that was told them; and it seems now very probable that much of it was true.  They were told that these same soldiers had breakfasted together, and that they had planned to march upon the National Assembly, and destroy it.  They heard a report that the king meant to go away to Metz, and to return at the head of an army, and to crush all those who had risen against him.  Nothing could now prevent the people from doing what they had threatened--going to Versailles, to separate the king from his evil counsellors, and bring the Dauphin to Paris.  Some went further than this, saying to General Lafayette that the king was too weak to reign; that they would destroy his guards, make him lay down his crown, and declare the Dauphin king, with Lafayette and others to manage the affairs of the empire till the boy should be of age.",foreign officer see street strange uniform person exasperate find harvest be scarcity bread temper believe bad tell seem probable much true tell same soldier breakfast plan march national destroy hear report king mean go return head army crush rise prevent person do threaten go separate king evil counsellor bring go say king weak reign destroy guard make lay crown declare king other manage affair empire boy age 
9,"This was said to Lafayette on the morning of the 5th of October. Grieved as he was to see that the mob were resolved to go to Versailles, he saw what he must do, since he could not keep them back.  He detained them as long as he could by speeches and arguments, while he sent messengers by every road to Versailles, to give notice of what might be expected; and he declared his intention of leading the march when the people could be detained no longer.  Several of his messengers were stopped: but some who went by by-roads reached Versailles, and gave the alarm.  Meantime, he contrived to make the march so slow, as that he and his thirty thousand followers were nine hours going the twelve miles to Versailles.  Lest the royal family should not be gone, as he hoped, he made the crowd halt on the ridge of the hill which overlooked Versailles, and swear, with their right hands lifted up towards heaven, to respect the king's dwelling, and be faithful to the orders of the Assembly they themselves had chosen.  Unhappily, all he did was of little use.  He arrived at near midnight; but another mob--a mob of women, savage because their children were hungry--had been in possession of Versailles since three in the afternoon.",say morning 5th grieve see mob resolve go see do keep detain speech argument send messenger road give notice expect declare intention lead march person detain several messenger stop go road reach give alarm contrive make march slow follower hour go mile royal family gone hope make crowd halt ridge hill overlook swear right hand lift heaven respect king dwelling faithful order choose do little use arrive midnight mob mob woman savage child hungry possession afternoon 
10,"Though it became rainy during the latter half of the day, so that the thousands out of doors were all wet to the skin, the morning had been fair; and the king went out hunting, as usual, while the queen spent the morning at her favourite little estate of Trianon.  The Dauphin was at home, with his new governess, the Marchioness de Tourzel, little dreaming, poor child, that there were people already on the road from Paris who wanted to make him a king instead of his father.  One of the ministers hearing unpleasant rumours, took horse, and went to try to find the king.  He met him in the woods, some way from home, and conjured him to make haste back.  The king, however, rode as slowly as possible, till more messengers appeared with news that a mob of desperate women was actually entering the avenue.  Then he had to spur his horse; and he arrived safe.  The queen had returned before him.  She had been sitting, alone and disconsolate, in her grotto at Trianon, reflecting on the miserable prospects of her family, when a line was brought to her from one of the ministers, begging that she would hasten home.  As soon as the king returned, orders were given to have the carriages ready at the back doors of the palace; and the children (kept out of sight) were equipped for a journey.",become rainy latter half day thousand door wet skin morning fair king go hunt usual queen spend morning favourite little estate home new governess little dreaming poor child be person road want make king father minister hear unpleasant rumour take horse go try find king meet wood home conjure make haste king ride possible more messenger appear news mob desperate woman enter avenue have spur horse arrive safe queen return sit alone disconsolate grotto reflect miserable prospect family line bring minister begg hast home king return order give have carriage ready back door palace child keep sight equip journey 
11,"The want of decision in the royal movements, as usual, ruined everything.  When the king had received and dismissed a deputation of the women, there was a shout of ""Long live the king!"" and he then thought it would not be necessary to go.  Not long afterwards, when the people were seen to be as angry as ever, and to be insulting the royal guard, the carriages were again ordered.  Some of them, empty, attempted to pass the back gates, to ascertain whether others might follow with the family: but the mob were now on the watch, and the carriages were turned back.  The hour for escape was gone by.",want decision royal movement usual ruin king receive dismiss deputation woman be shout live king think necessary go person see angry insult royal guard carriage order empty attempt pass back gate ascertain other follow family mob watch carriage turn hour escape go 
12,"When little Louis was got ready for the journey, it was by candlelight, and past bedtime.  Perhaps he was not sorry when his things were taken off again, and he was laid in his bed, instead of getting into the carriage on a pouring rainy night, to pass through or near a disorderly mob, who might be heard from within the palace crying ""Bread!  Bread!""",little get ready journey candlelight bedtime sorry thing take lay bed get carriage pour rainy night pass disorderly mob hear palace cry bread bread 
13,"Little Louis did not know all the disorders of that mob.  Thousands of women, wet to the skin, were calling out ""Bread!  Bread!"" till they were hoarse.  They threatened his mother's life, believing that to her influence and her extravagance it was owing that their children had no bread.  Some sat upon the cannon they had brought.  Some dried their wet clothes at the fires that blazed on the ground: and haggard and fierce did the faces of both men and women look in the light of these fires. By the orders of certain officers and members of the Assembly, provisions were brought from the shops of Versailles; and groups were seen eating bread and sausages, and drinking wine, in the great avenue; and not there only, but in the House of Assembly itself,--the parliament-chamber of Versailles.  Hundreds of poor women, wet and dirty, rushed in there, and sat eating their sausages while the members were in debate, breaking in sometimes with, ""What's the use of all this? What we want is bread.""  The king was told of what was going forward; and yet it was six hours before he could make up his mind what answer to give to the messages sent him by deputations from the rioters.  The answer he gave at last, late at night, could be no other than that which they chose to have; though the king was well aware that the people did not know what they were asking, and that he should never be able to satisfy them.  What they asked, and made him promise in writing, was an abundance of food--""a free circulation of corn,"" as they called it,-- believing that the wealthy, and the millers and bakers under them, kept large hidden stores of grain, in order that bread might be dear.",little know disorder mob thousand woman wet skin call bread bread hoarse threaten mother life believe influence extravagance ow child have bread sit non bring dry wet clothes fire blaze ground haggard fierce do face man woman look light fire order certain officer member provision bring shop group see eat bread sausages drink wine great avenue parliament chamber hundred poor woman wet dirty rush sit eat sausages member debate break use want bread king tell go hour make mind answer give message send deputation rioter answer give last night other choose have king aware person know ask able satisfy ask make promise writing abundance food free circulation corn call believe wealthy miller baker keep large hide store grain order bread dear 
14,"Louis understood nothing of all this; but he was aware that all was confusion and danger.  About two hours after midnight everybody in the palace was suddenly relieved, and led to believe that the danger was past.  General Lafayette entered, and pledged his life that they should be safe: and everybody was accustomed to rely on Lafayette's word.  He happened to be mistaken this time,--to think better of the temper of the people outside than they deserved; but what he said he fully believed. With him came some messengers from Paris, to entreat the king, among other things, to come and live among his people at Paris.  This was the very thing the king was least disposed to do; but he dared not say ""No."" He promised to consider of it.  Lafayette and his companions then went away; and between two and three o'clock almost everybody but the guards went to bed.",understand aware confusion danger hour midnight palace relieved lead believe danger past enter pledge life safe accustom rely word happen mistaken time think good temper person deserve say believe come messenger entreat king other thing come live person very thing king dispose do say promise consider companion go o'clock guard go bed 
15,"I say _almost_ everybody.  The queen desired her ladies to go to rest; but two of them were still uneasy and distrustful, and thought that the queen's servants should not all sleep while thousands of people who hated her were round about the very doors.  They watched in the ante-chamber: and it was their vigilance which saved her life.",say queen desire lady go rest uneasy distrustful think queen servant sleep thousand person hate very door watch ante chamber vigilance save life 
16,"About five in the morning the Dauphin was snatched from his bed, and carried into his father's room.  There were his mother, aunt, and sister; and his mother was in a passion of tears.  Clinging round the king's neck, she cried, ""O!  Save me!  Save me and my children!""  There was a dreadful noise.  Not only was there the clamour of an angry multitude without, but a hammering and battering at all the doors, and fierce cries, and clashing of arms--all the dreadful sounds of fighting--from the queen's apartments.  The mob had indeed forced their way in.  Her two watchful ladies had heard the shout from the corridor, given by a faithful guard at the peril of his life, ""Save the queen!"" They lifted her from her bed, threw a dressing-gown over her, and hurried her across a great apartment which divided her rooms from the king's.  This was her only way of escape, and even this appeared at first to be closed; for the door which led from the queen's dressing-room to this apartment--a door which was always kept fastened on the inside--was now, by some accident, found to be locked on the outside.  It was a moment of dreadful suspense,--for the fighting behind came nearer.  The ladies called so loud that a servant of the king's heard them, and ran to unlock the door.  Even as they crossed the large apartment, the mob were battering at the doors.",morning snatch bed carry father room be mother aunt sister mother passion tear cling king neck cry save save child be dreadful noise be clamour angry multitude hammering battering door fierce cry clashing arm dreadful sound fighting queen apartment mob force way watchful lady hear shout corridor give faithful guard peril life save queen lift bed throw dress gown hurry great apartment divide room king only way escape appear first close door lead queen dress room apartment door keep fasten inside accident find lock outside moment dreadful suspense fighting come lady call servant king hear run unlock door cross large apartment mob batter door 
17,"Presently some soldiers came from the town: and General Lafayette appeared, addressing the people in passionate speeches, in favour of respecting the persons and dwelling of the royal family.  The palace was soon cleared; but the terrors of the household did not disperse with the intruders who occasioned them.",soldier come town appear address person passionate speech favour respect person dwelling royal family palace clear terror household disperse intruder occasion 
18,"It is believed that this sudden uproar was caused by a quarrel between one of the body-guards and the people without.  Some shots were fired; and a young man, known to the mob, was killed.  They were instantly in a rage, shook at the gates, burst in, and, as they hated the queen most, sought her first.",believe sudden uproar cause quarrel body guard person shot fire young man know mob kill rage shake gate burst hate queen most seek first
