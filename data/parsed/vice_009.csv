3," If it were not that it was so absolutely essential to the interest of this story, I think I should almost prefer to draw a veil over the sufferings of Mr. Bultitude during the rest of that unhappy week at Crichton House; but it would only be false delicacy to do so.",essential interest story think prefer draw veil suffering rest unhappy week false delicacy do

The real Dick in his most objectionable moods could never have contrived to render himself one quarter so disliked and suspected as his substitute was by the whole school--masters and boys.,thing go bad bad real objectionable mood contrive render quarter dislike suspect substitute whole school master boy 
5,"It was in a great measure his own fault, too; for to an ordinary boy the life there would not have had any intolerable hardships, if it held out no exceptional attractions. But he would not accommodate himself to circumstances, and try, during his enforced stay, to get as much instruction and enjoyment as possible out of his new life.",great measure own fault ordinary boy life have intolerable hardship hold exceptional attraction accommodate circumstance try enforce stay get much instruction enjoyment possible new life 
6,"Perhaps, in his position, it would be too much to expect such a thing and, at all events, it never even occurred to him to attempt it. He consumed himself instead with inward raging and chafing at his hard lot, and his utter powerlessness to break the spell which bound him.",position much expect thing event occur attempt consume inward raging chafing hard lot utter powerlessness break spell bind 
7,"Sometimes, indeed, he would resolve to bear it no longer, and would start up impulsively to impart his misfortunes to some one in minor authority--not the Doctor, he had given that up in resigned despair long since. But as surely as ever he found himself coming to the point, the words would stick fast in his throat, and he was only too thankful to get away, with his tale untold, on any frivolous pretext that first suggested itself.",resolve bear start impart misfortune one minor authority give resign despair find come point word stick throat thankful get tale untold frivolous pretext suggest 
8,"This, of course, brought him into suspicion, for such conduct had the appearance of a systematic course of practical joking, and even the most impartial teachers will sometimes form an unfavourable opinion of a particular boy on rather slender grounds, and then find fresh confirmation of it in his most insignificant actions.",course bring suspicion such conduct have appearance systematic course practical joke impartial teacher form unfavourable opinion particular boy slender grounds find fresh confirmation insignificant action 
9,"As for the school generally, his scowls and his sullenness, his deficiency in the daring and impudence that had warmed their hearts towards Dick, and, above all, his strange knack of getting them into trouble--for he seldom received what he considered an indignity without making a formal complaint--all this brought him as much hearty dislike and contempt as, perhaps, the most unsympathetic boy ever earned since boarding-schools were first invented.",school scowl sullenness deficiency dare impudence warm heart strange knack get trouble receive consider indignity make formal complaint bring much hearty dislike contempt unsympathetic boy earn board school invent 
10,"The only boy who still seemed to retain a secret tenderness for him, as the Dick he had once looked up to and admired, was Jolland, who persisted in believing, and in stating his belief, that this apparent change of demeanour was a perverted kind of joke on Bultitude's part, which he would condescend to explain some day when it had gone far enough, and he wearied and annoyed Paul beyond endurance by perpetually urging him to abandon his ill-judged experiment and discover the point of the jest.",only boy seem retain secret tenderness look admire persist believe state belief apparent change demeanour perverted kind joke part condescend explain day go weary annoy endurance urge abandon ill judge experiment discover point jest 
11,"But for Jolland's help, which he persevered in giving in spite of the opposition and unpopularity it brought upon himself, Mr. Bultitude would have found it impossible to make any pretence of performing the tasks required of him.",help persever give spite opposition unpopularity bring find impossible make pretence perform task require 
12,"He found himself expected, as a matter of course, to have a certain familiarity with Greek paradigms and German conversation scraps, propositions in Euclid and Latin gerunds, of all of which, having had a strict commercial education in his young days, he had not so much as heard before his metamorphosis. But by carefully copying Jolland's exercises, and introducing enough mistakes of his own to supply the necessary local colour, he was able to escape to a great degree the discovery of his blank ignorance on all these subjects--an ignorance which would certainly have been put down as mere idleness and obstinacy.",find expect matter course have certain familiarity greek paradigm german conversation scrap proposition latin gerund have strict commercial education young day have much hear metamorphosis copy exercise introduce enough mistake own supply necessary local colour able escape great degree discovery blank ignorance subject ignorance put mere idleness obstinacy 
13,"But it will be readily believed that he lived in constant fear of such discovery, and as it was, his dependence on a little scamp like his son's friend was a sore humiliation to one who had naturally supposed hitherto that any knowledge he had not happened to acquire could only be meretricious and useless.",believe live constant fear such discovery dependence little scamp son friend sore humiliation suppose knowledge happen acquire meretricious useless 
14,"He led a nightmare sort of existence for some days, until something happened which roused him from his state of passive misery into one more attempt at protest.",lead nightmare sort existence day happen rouse state passive misery more attempt protest 
15,"It was Saturday morning, and he had come down to breakfast, after being knocked about as usual in the dormitory over night, with a dull wonder how long this horrible state of things could possibly be going to last, when he saw on his plate a letter with the Paddington post-mark, addressed in a familiar hand--his daughter Barbara's.",morning come breakfast knock usual dormitory night dull wonder horrible state thing go last see plate letter post mark address familiar hand daughter 
16,"For an instant his hopes rose high. Surely the impostor had been found out at last, and the envelope would contain an urgent invitation to him to come back and resume his rights--an invitation which he might show to the Doctor as his best apology.",instant hope rise high impostor find last envelope contain urgent invitation come resume right invitation show good apology 
17,"But when he looked at the address, which was ""Master Richard Bultitude,"" he felt a misgiving. It was unlikely that Barbara would address him thus if she knew the truth; he hesitated before tearing it open.",look address feel misgiving unlikely address know truth hesitate tear open

19,"The very first sentences scattered his faint expectations to the winds. He read on with staring eyes, till the room seemed to rock with him like a packet-boat and the sprawling school-girl handwriting, crossed and recrossed on the thin paper, changed to letters of scorching flame. But perhaps it will be better to give the letter in full, so that the reader may judge for himself whether it was calculated or not to soothe and encourage the exiled one.",first sentence scatter faint expectation wind read stare eye room seem rock packet boat sprawl school girl handwriting cross recross thin paper change letter scorch flame good give letter full reader judge calculate soothe encourage exiled one

Generally he stays at home all the morning and plays at soldiers      with baby in the dining-room.

Miss McFadden called in the middle of it, but she      said she wouldn't come in, as papa seemed to be enjoying himself      so. Boaler has given warning, but we can't think why. We have been      out nearly every evening--once to Hengler's and once to the Christy      Minstrels, and last night to the Pantomime, where papa was so      pleased with the clown that he sent round afterwards and asked him      to dine here on Sunday, when Sir Benjamin and Lady Bangle and      Alderman Fishwick are coming. Won't it be jolly to see a clown      close to? Should you think he'd come in _his_ evening dress?

31," It would be nothing short of an insult to the reader's comprehension, if I were to enter into an elaborate explanation of the effect this letter had upon Mr. Bultitude. He took it in by degrees, trying to steady his nerves at each additional item of poor Barbara's well-meant intelligence by a sip at his tin-flavoured coffee. But when he came to the postscript, in spite of its purport being mercifully broken to him gradually by the extreme difficulty of making it out from two undercurrents of manuscript, he choked convulsively and spilt his coffee.",short insult reader comprehension enter elaborate explanation effect letter have take degree try steady nerve additional item poor mean intelligence sip tin flavoure coffee come postscript spite purport break extreme difficulty make undercurrent manuscript choke spilt coffee

33,"There was a faint chuckle along the tables, and several drank coffee with studied elegance and self-repression either as a valuable example to Dick, or as a personal advertisement.

48,"Once more would Paul have given worlds for the firmness and presence of mind to state his case clearly and effectively; and he could hardly have had a better opportunity, for schoolmasters cannot always be playing the tyrant, and the Doctor was, in spite of his attempts to be stern, secretly more amused than angry at what seemed a peculiarly precocious piece of effrontery.",more give world firmness presence mind state case have good opportunity schoolmaster play tyrant spite attempt stern amused angry seem precocious piece effrontery

There was an element of romance in this promised combat which gave it additional attractions. It was like one of the struggles between knightly champions in the Waverley novels.
