6,"He slipped away off the rocks into the water, as I said before. But he could not help thinking of little Ellie.  He did not remember who she was; but he knew that she was a little girl, though she was a hundred times as big as he.  That is not surprising:  size has nothing to do with kindred.  A tiny weed may be first cousin to a great tree; and a little dog like Vick knows that Lioness is a dog too, though she is twenty times larger than herself.  So Tom knew that Ellie was a little girl, and thought about her all that day, and longed to have had her to play with; but he had very soon to think of something else.  And here is the account of what happened to him, as it was published next morning, in the Water-proof Gazette, on the finest watered paper, for the use of the great fairy, Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, who reads the news very carefully every morning, and especially the police cases, as you will hear very soon.",slip rock water say help think little remember know little girl time big surprising size have do kindred tiny weed first cousin great tree little dog know dog time large know little girl think day long have play have think else account happen publish next morning proof fine water paper use great fairy read news morning police case hear

19,"But the lobster was so stupid and clumsy that he couldn't hit the hole.  Like a great many fox-hunters, he was very sharp as long as he was in his own country; but as soon as they get out of it they lose their heads; and so the lobster, so to speak, lost his tail.",lobster stupid clumsy hit hole great many fox hunter sharp own country get lose head lobster speak lose tail

And the lobster tore at the otter, and the otter tore at the lobster, and both squeezed and thumped poor Tom till he had no breath left in his body; and I don't know what would have happened to him if he had not at last got on the otter's back, and safe out of the hole.",pot roll tight packing lobster tore otter otter tore lobster squeeze thump poor have breath leave body know happen get otter back safe hole

34,"But the lobster would not let go.  Tom saw the fisherman haul him up to the boat-side, and thought it was all up with him.  But when Mr. Lobster saw the fisherman, he gave such a furious and tremendous snap, that he snapped out of his hand, and out of the pot, and safe into the sea.  But he left his knobbed claw behind him; for it never came into his stupid head to let go after all, so he just shook his claw off as the easier method.  It was something of a bull, that; but you must know the lobster was an Irish lobster, and was hatched off Island Magee at the mouth of Belfast Lough.",lobster let go see fisherman haul boat side think see fisherman give furious tremendous snap snap hand pot safe sea leave knobb claw come stupid head let go shake claw easy method bull know lobster irish lobster hatch mouth 
35,"Tom asked the lobster why he never thought of letting go.  He said very determinedly that it was a point of honour among lobsters. And so it is, as the Mayor of Plymouth found out once to his cost-- eight or nine hundred years ago, of course; for if it had happened lately it would be personal to mention it.",ask lobster think let go say point honour lobster find cost year course happen personal mention 
36,"For one day he was so tired with sitting on a hard chair, in a grand furred gown, with a gold chain round his neck, hearing one policeman after another come in and sing, ""What shall we do with the drunken sailor, so early in the morning?"" and answering them each exactly alike:",day tired sit hard chair grand furr gown gold chain neck hear policeman come sing do drunken sailor morning answer

38,"That, when it was over, he jumped up, and played leap-frog with the town-clerk till he burst his buttons, and then had his luncheon, and burst some more buttons, and then said:  ""It is a low spring- tide; I shall go out this afternoon and cut my capers.""",jump play leap frog town clerk burst button have luncheon burst more button say low spring tide go afternoon cut caper 
39,"Now he did not mean to cut such capers as you eat with boiled mutton.  It was the commandant of artillery at Valetta who used to amuse himself with cutting them, and who stuck upon one of the bastions a notice, ""No one allowed to cut capers here but me,"" which greatly edified the midshipmen in port, and the Maltese on the Nix Mangiare stairs.  But all that the mayor meant was that he would go and have an afternoon's fun, like any schoolboy, and catch lobsters with an iron hook.",mean cut such caper eat boil mutton commandant artillery use amuse cut stick bastion notice allow cut caper edify midshipmen port stair mayor mean go have afternoon fun schoolboy catch lobster iron hook 
40,"So to the Mewstone he went, and for lobsters he looked.  And when he came to a certain crack in the rocks he was so excited that, instead of putting in his hook, he put in his hand; and Mr. Lobster was at home, and caught him by the finger, and held on.",go lobster look come certain crack rock excited put hook put hand home catch finger hold

49,"Then he thought over all the naughty things he ever had done; all the sand which he had put in the sugar, and the sloe-leaves in the tea, and the water in the treacle, and the salt in the tobacco (because his brother was a brewer, and a man must help his own kin).",think naughty thing do sand put sugar sloe leave tea water treacle salt tobacco brother brewer man help own kin 
50,"Then he turned quite blue; for the tide was up to his breast, and still the lobster held on.",turn blue tide breast lobster hold 
51,"Then, I have no doubt, he repented fully of all the said naughty things which he had done, and promised to mend his life, as too many do when they think they have no life left to mend.  Whereby, as they fancy, they make a very cheap bargain.  But the old fairy with the birch rod soon undeceives them.",have doubt repent say naughty thing do promise mend life many do think have life leave mend fancy make cheap bargain old fairy birch rod undeceive 
52,"And then he grew all colours at once, and turned up his eyes like a duck in thunder; for the water was up to his chin, and still the lobster held on.",grow colour turn eye duck thunder water chin lobster hold 
53,"And then came a man-of-war's boat round the Mewstone, and saw his head sticking up out of the water.  One said it was a keg of brandy, and another that it was a cocoa-nut, and another that it was a buoy loose, and another that it was a black diver, and wanted to fire at it, which would not have been pleasant for the mayor: but just then such a yell came out of a great hole in the middle of it that the midshipman in charge guessed what it was, and bade pull up to it as fast as they could.  So somehow or other the Jack-tars got the lobster out, and set the mayor free, and put him ashore at the Barbican.  He never went lobster-catching again; and we will hope he put no more salt in the tobacco, not even to sell his brother's beer.",come man war boat see head stick water say keg brandy cocoa nut buoy loose black diver want fire pleasant mayor yell come great hole middle midshipman charge guess pull other tar get lobster set mayor free put go lobster catching hope put more salt tobacco sell brother beer 
54,"And that is the story of the Mayor of Plymouth, which has two advantages--first, that of being quite true; and second, that of having (as folks say all good stories ought to have) no moral whatsoever:  no more, indeed, has any part of this book, because it is a fairy tale, you know.",story have advantage true have folk say good story moral more have part book fairy tale know 
55,And now happened to Tom a most wonderful thing; for he had not left the lobster five minutes before he came upon a water-baby.,happen wonderful thing leave lobster minute come water baby 
56,"A real live water-baby, sitting on the white sand, very busy about a little point of rock.  And when it saw Tom it looked up for a moment, and then cried, ""Why, you are not one of us.  You are a new baby!  Oh, how delightful!""",real live water baby sit white sand busy little point rock see look moment cry new baby delightful

60,"Tom looked at the baby again, and then he said:",look baby say 
61,"""Well, this is wonderful!  I have seen things just like you again and again, but I thought you were shells, or sea-creatures.  I never took you for water-babies like myself.""",wonderful see thing think shell sea creature take water baby 
62,"Now, was not that very odd?  So odd, indeed, that you will, no doubt, want to know how it happened, and why Tom could never find a water-baby till after he had got the lobster out of the pot.  And, if you will read this story nine times over, and then think for yourself, you will find out why.  It is not good for little boys to be told everything, and never to be forced to use their own wits. They would learn, then, no more than they do at Dr. Dulcimer's famous suburban establishment for the idler members of the youthful aristocracy, where the masters learn the lessons and the boys hear them--which saves a great deal of trouble--for the time being.",odd odd want know happen find water baby get lobster pot read story time think find good little boy tell force use own wit learn more do famous suburban establishment idler member youthful aristocracy master learn lesson boy hear save great deal trouble time being

66,"So they worked away at the rock, and planted it, and smoothed the sand down round, it, and capital fun they had till the tide began to turn.  And then Tom heard all the other babies coming, laughing and singing and shouting and romping; and the noise they made was just like the noise of the ripple.

67,"And in they came, dozens and dozens of them, some bigger than Tom and some smaller, all in the neatest little white bathing dresses; and when they found that he was a new baby, they hugged him and kissed him, and then put him in the middle and danced round him on the sand, and there was no one ever so happy as poor little Tom.",come dozen dozen big small neatest little white bathing dress find new baby hugge kiss put middle dance sand be happy poor little

70,"Only where men are wasteful and dirty, and let sewers run into the sea instead of putting the stuff upon the fields like thrifty reasonable souls; or throw herrings' heads and dead dog-fish, or any other refuse, into the water; or in any way make a mess upon the clean shore--there the water-babies will not come, sometimes not for hundreds of years (for they cannot abide anything smelly or foul), but leave the sea-anemones and the crabs to clear away everything, till the good tidy sea has covered up all the dirt in soft mud and clean sand, where the water-babies can plant live cockles and whelks and razor-shells and sea-cucumbers and golden- combs, and make a pretty live garden again, after man's dirt is cleared away.  And that, I suppose, is the reason why there are no water-babies at any watering-place which I have ever seen.",man wasteful dirty let sewer run sea put stuff field thrifty reasonable soul throw herring head dead dog fish other refuse water way make mess clean shore water baby come hundred year abide smelly foul leave sea anemone crab clear good tidy sea cover dirt soft mud clean sand water baby plant live cockle whelk razor shell sea cucumber golden comb make live garden man dirt clear suppose reason be water baby water place see 
71,And where is the home of the water-babies?  In St. Brandan's fairy isle.,home water baby fairy isle 
72,"Did you never hear of the blessed St. Brandan, how he preached to the wild Irish on the wild, wild Kerry coast, he and five other hermits, till they were weary and longed to rest?  For the wild Irish would not listen to them, or come to confession and to mass, but liked better to brew potheen, and dance the pater o'pee, and knock each other over the head with shillelaghs, and shoot each other from behind turf-dykes, and steal each other's cattle, and burn each other's homes; till St. Brandan and his friends were weary of them, for they would not learn to be peaceable Christians at all.",hear bless preach wild wild wild coast other hermit weary long rest wild listen come confession mass like good brow potheen dance pater o'pee knock other head shillelagh shoot other turf dyke steal other cattle burn other home friend weary learn peaceable 
73,"So St. Brandan went out to the point of Old Dunmore, and looked over the tide-way roaring round the Blasquets, at the end of all the world, and away into the ocean, and sighed--""Ah that I had wings as a dove!""  And far away, before the setting sun, he saw a blue fairy sea, and golden fairy islands, and he said, ""Those are the islands of the blest.""  Then he and his friends got into a hooker, and sailed away and away to the westward, and were never heard of more.  But the people who would not hear him were changed into gorillas, and gorillas they are until this day.",go point old look tide way roar end world ocean sigh have wing dove setting sun see blue fairy sea golden fairy island say island good friend get hooker sail westward hear more person hear change gorilla gorilla day 
74,"And when St. Brandan and the hermits came to that fairy isle they found it overgrown with cedars and full of beautiful birds; and he sat down under the cedars and preached to all the birds in the air. And they liked his sermons so well that they told the fishes in the sea; and they came, and St. Brandan preached to them; and the fishes told the water-babies, who live in the caves under the isle; and they came up by hundreds every Sunday, and St. Brandan got quite a neat little Sunday-school.  And there he taught the water- babies for a great many hundred years, till his eyes grew too dim to see, and his beard grew so long that he dared not walk for fear of treading on it, and then he might have tumbled down.  And at last he and the five hermits fell fast asleep under the cedar- shades, and there they sleep unto this day.  But the fairies took to the water-babies, and taught them their lessons themselves.",hermit come fairy isle find overgrown cedar full beautiful bird sit cedar preach bird air like sermon tell fish sea come preach fish tell water baby live cave isle come hundred get neat little school teach water baby great many year eye grow dim see beard grow walk fear tread tumble last hermit fall cedar shade sleep day fairy take water baby teach lesson 
75,"And some say that St. Brandan will awake and begin to teach the babies once more:  but some think that he will sleep on, for better for worse, till the coming of the Cocqcigrues.  But, on still clear summer evenings, when the sun sinks down into the sea, among golden cloud-capes and cloud-islands, and locks and friths of azure sky, the sailors fancy that they see, away to westward, St. Brandan's fairy isle.",say awake begin teach baby more think sleep good bad coming clear summer evening sun sink sea golden cloud cape cloud island lock frith azure sky sailor fancy see fairy isle 
76,"But whether men can see it or not, St. Brandan's Isle once actually stood there; a great land out in the ocean, which has sunk and sunk beneath the waves.  Old Plato called it Atlantis, and told strange tales of the wise men who lived therein, and of the wars they fought in the old times.  And from off that island came strange flowers, which linger still about this land:- the Cornish heath, and Cornish moneywort, and the delicate Venus's hair, and the London-pride which covers the Kerry mountains, and the little pink butterwort of Devon, and the great blue butterwort of Ireland, and the Connemara heath, and the bristle-fern of the Turk waterfall, and many a strange plant more; all fairy tokens left for wise men and good children from off St. Brandan's Isle.",man see stand great land ocean sink sink wave old call tell strange tale wise man live war fight old time island come strange flower linger land cornish heath cornish moneywort delicate hair pride cover mountain little pink butterwort great blue butterwort heath bristle fern waterfall many strange plant fairy token leave wise man good child 
77,"Now when Tom got there, he found that the isle stood all on pillars, and that its roots were full of caves.  There were pillars of black basalt, like Staffa; and pillars of green and crimson serpentine, like Kynance; and pillars ribboned with red and white and yellow sandstone, like Livermead; and there were blue grottoes like Capri, and white grottoes like Adelsberg; all curtained and draped with seaweeds, purple and crimson, green and brown; and strewn with soft white sand, on which the water-babies sleep every night.  But, to keep the place clean and sweet, the crabs picked up all the scraps off the floor and ate them like so many monkeys; while the rocks were covered with ten thousand sea-anemones, and corals and madrepores, who scavenged the water all day long, and kept it nice and pure.  But, to make up to them for having to do such nasty work, they were not left black and dirty, as poor chimney-sweeps and dustmen are.  No; the fairies are more considerate and just than that, and have dressed them all in the most beautiful colours and patterns, till they look like vast flower-beds of gay blossoms.  If you think I am talking nonsense, I can only say that it is true; and that an old gentleman named Fourier used to say that we ought to do the same by chimney-sweeps and dustmen, and honour them instead of despising them; and he was a very clever old gentleman:  but, unfortunately for him and the world, as mad as a March hare.",get find isle stand pillar root full cave be pillar black basalt pillar green crimson serpentine pillar ribbon red white yellow sandstone be blue grottoe white grottoe curtain drape seaweed purple crimson green brown strewn soft white sand water baby sleep night keep place clean sweet crab pick scrap floor eat many monkey rock cover sea anemone coral madrepore scavenge water day keep nice pure make have do such nasty work leave black dirty poor chimney sweep dustmen fairy considerate dress beautiful colour pattern look vast flower bed gay blossom think talk nonsense say true old gentleman name use say do same chimney sweep dustmen honour despise clever old gentleman world mad hare 
78,"And, instead of watchmen and policemen to keep out nasty things at night, there were thousands and thousands of water-snakes, and most wonderful creatures they were.  They were all named after the Nereids, the sea-fairies who took care of them, Eunice and Polynoe, Phyllodoce and Psamathe, and all the rest of the pretty darlings who swim round their Queen Amphitrite, and her car of cameo shell. They were dressed in green velvet, and black velvet, and purple velvet; and were all jointed in rings; and some of them had three hundred brains apiece, so that they must have been uncommonly shrewd detectives; and some had eyes in their tails; and some had eyes in every joint, so that they kept a very sharp look-out; and when they wanted a baby-snake, they just grew one at the end of their own tails, and when it was able to take care of itself it dropped off; so that they brought up their families very cheaply. But if any nasty thing came by, out they rushed upon it; and then out of each of their hundreds of feet there sprang a whole cutler's shop of",watchmen policemen keep nasty thing night be thousand thousand water snake wonderful creature name sea fairy take care rest pretty darling swim car cameo shell dress green velvet black velvet purple velvet joint ring have brain shrewd detective have eye tail have eye joint keep sharp look want baby snake grow end own tail able take care drop bring family nasty thing come rush hundred foot spring whole cutler shop

82,"But I wish Tom had given up all his naughty tricks, and left off tormenting dumb animals now that he had plenty of playfellows to amuse him.  Instead of that, I am sorry to say, he would meddle with the creatures, all but the water-snakes, for they would stand no nonsense.  So he tickled the madrepores, to make them shut up; and frightened the crabs, to make them hide in the sand and peep out at him with the tips of their eyes; and put stones into the anemones' mouths, to make them fancy that their dinner was coming.",wish give naughty trick leave torment dumb animal have plenty playfellow amuse sorry say meddle creature water snake stand nonsense tickle madrepore make shut frighten crab make hide sand peep tip eye put stone anemone mouth make fancy dinner come

More than half of them were nasty, dirty, frowzy, grubby, smelly old monks, who, because they dare not hit a man of their own size, amused themselves with beating little children instead; as you may see in the picture of old Pope Gregory (good man and true though he was, when he meddled with things which he did understand), teaching children to sing their fa-fa-mi-fa with a cat-o'-nine tails under his chair:  but, because they never had any children of their own, they took into their heads (as some folks do still) that they were the only people in the world who knew how to manage children:  and they first brought into England, in the old Anglo-Saxon times, the fashion of treating free boys, and girls too, worse than you would treat a dog or a horse:  but Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid has caught them all long ago; and given them many a taste of their own rods; and much good may it do them.",luncheon set work call cruel schoolmaster whole regiment brigade see frown set work earnest good part day work come more half nasty dirty frowzy grubby smelly old monk hit man own size amuse beat little child see picture old good man true meddle thing understand teach child sing fa mi fa cat o'- tail chair have child own take head folk do only person world know manage child bring old anglo saxon time fashion treat free boy girl bad treat dog horse catch give many taste own rod good do

And at that they all cried and howled so, that their breaths came all up through the sea like bubbles out of soda-water; and that is one reason of the bubbles in the sea.

But Tom saw that she was a very tall woman, as tall as her sister:  but instead of being gnarly and horny, and scaly, and prickly, like her, she was the most nice, soft, fat, smooth, pussy, cuddly, delicious creature who ever nursed a baby; and she understood babies thoroughly, for she had plenty of her own, whole rows and regiments of them, and has to this day.  And all her delight was, whenever she had a spare moment, to play with babies, in which she showed herself a woman of sense; for babies are the best company, and the pleasantest playfellows, in the world; at least, so all the wise people in the world think.  And therefore when the children saw her, they naturally all caught hold of her, and pulled her till she sat down on a stone, and climbed into her lap, and clung round her neck, and caught hold of her hands; and then they all put their thumbs into their mouths, and began cuddling and purring like so many kittens, as they ought to have done.  While those who could get nowhere else sat down on the sand, and cuddled her feet--for no one, you know, wear shoes in the water, except horrid old bathing-women, who are afraid of the water-babies pinching their horny toes.
