1,CHAPTER XVII.,
2," When he awoke, bright day was on the mountains. The little snow-wolves had slunk back to their holes and lairs. The fires burned low. And Thimble lay in a sleep so quiet and profound it seemed to Nod the heart beneath the sharp-ribbed chest was scarcely stirring. It was bitter cold on these heights in the sunlessness of morning. And Nod was glad to sit himself down beside one of the wood-fires to eat his breakfast of nuts, and swallow a suppet or two of the thawed Mulgar-milk. But the Men of the Mountains had plucked and roasted the eagles, and were squatting, with not quite such doleful faces as usual, picking with pointed, rather catlike teeth, the bones.",awoke bright day mountain little snow wolf slunk hole lair fire burn low lay sleep quiet profound seem nod heart sharp ribb chest stir bitter cold height sunlessness morning glad sit wood fire eat breakfast nut swallow suppet thaw milk pluck roast eagle squat such doleful face usual pick point catlike tooth bone 
3,"Nod could not help watching them under his eyebrows, where they sat, with tail-tufts over their shoulders, in their fleecy hair, blinking mildly from their pale pink eyes. For, though here and there may be seen a Mountain-mulgar with eyes blue as the turquoise, by far the most of them have pink, and some (but these are what the Oomgar-nuggas would call Witch-doctors, or Fulbies) have one of either. They looked timid and feeble enough, these Moona-mulgars, yet with what fearless fury had they fought with the eagles! How swiftly they shambled dim-sighted along these wrinkled precipices! Some even now were seated on the rocky verge as easily as a Skeeto in its tree-top, their lean shanks dangling over. But they nibbled and tugged at their slender bird-bones, and peered and waved their long arms in faint talk; though, as their watchman had told Nod in the firelight, they knew they were all within earshot of the Harp.",nod help watch eyebrow sit tail tuft shoulder fleecy hair blink pale pink eye see mulgar eye blue turquoise most have pink nugga call doctor have look timid feeble mulgar fearless fury fight eagle shamble sight wrinkled precipice seat rocky verge tree top lean shank dangle nibble tug slender bird bone peer wave long arm faint talk watchman tell nod firelight know earshot 
4,"Ghibba was sitting a little away from the others, eating with his eyes shut.",sit little other eat eye shut 
5,"""Are you so sleepy, Prince of the Mountains, that you keep your eyes shut in broad day?"" said Nod.",sleepy keep eye shut broad day say 
6,"Ghibba wagged his head. ""No, Mulla-mulgar, I am not sleepy; but one eye is scorched with the fire and one a little angry with the eagles, so that I can scarcely see at all.""",wagg head sleepy eye scorch fire little angry eagle see 
7,"""Not blind?"" said Nod.",blind say 
8,"Ghibba opened his eyes, red and glittering. ""Nay, twilight, not night, little Mulgar,"" he answered cheerfully. ""I see no more of you than a little brown cloud against black mountains.""",open eye red glitter twilight night little answer see more little brown cloud black mountain 
9,"""But how will you walk on these narrow, icy shelves?"" said Nod.",walk narrow icy shelf say 
10,"""Why,"" says he, ""I have a tail, Mulgar-royal; and my people must lead me.... What of the morning, Nizza-neela?""",say have tail royal person lead morning 
11,"""It is bright as hoarfrost on the slopes and tops there,"" said Nod, pointing. ""It dazzles Ummanodda's eyes to look. But the sun is behind this huge black wall of ours, so here we sit cold in the shadow.""",bright hoarfrost slope top say point dazzle eye look sun huge black wall sit cold shadow 
12,"""Then we will wait,"" said Ghibba, ""till he come walking a little higher to melt the frost and drive away the last of the wolves.""",wait say come walk little high melt frost drive last wolf 
13,"""Man of the Mountains,"" said Nod presently, ""would you hold me if I crept close and put my head over the edge? I would like to see how many Mulgars-deep we walk.""",say hold creep put head edge like see many deep walk 
14,"Ghibba laughed. ""This path is but as other Mulgar-paths, Mulla-mulgar; no traveller need stumble twice. But I will do as you ask me.""",laugh path other path mulgar traveller need stumble do ask 
15,"So Nod lay down flat on his stomach, while two of the Mountain-mulgars clutched each a leg. He wriggled forward till head and shoulders hung beyond the margent of the rock. He shut his eyes a moment against that terrific steep of air, and the huge shadow of the mountain upon the deep blue forest. All far beneath was still dark with night; only the frozen waters of the swirling torrent palely reflected the daybreak sky. But suddenly he shot out a lean brown paw. ""Ahôh, ahôh! I say!""",lay flat stomach mulgar clutch leg wriggle head shoulder hang margent rock shut eye moment terrific steep air huge shadow mountain deep blue forest dark night freeze water swirl torrent reflect daybreak sky shoot lean brown paw say 
16,"The Men of the Mountains dragged him back so roughly that his broad snub nose was scraped on the stone. ""Why do you do that?"" he said angrily.",drag broad snub nose scrape stone do say 
17,"""You called 'O, O!' Mulla-mulgar, and we thought you were afraid.""",call think afraid 
18,"""Afraid! Nod? No!"" said Nod. ""What is there to be afraid of?""",afraid nod say be afraid 
19,"Ghibba twitched his long grey eyebrow. ""The little Mulgar asks us riddles,"" he said.",twitch long grey eyebrow little ask riddle say 
20,"""I called,"" said Nod, ""because I spy something jutting there with a fluff of hair in the wind that leaps the chasm, and with thin ends that look to me like the arms and legs of a Man of the Mountains lying caught in a bush of Tummusc.""",call say spy jut fluff hair wind leap chasm thin end look arm leg catch bush 
21,"At the sound of Nod's ""Ahôh!"" Thumb had come scrambling along from the other fire, and many of the Mountain-mulgars fell flat on their faces, and leaned peering over the precipice. But their eyes were too dim to pierce far. They broke into shrill, eager whisperings.",sound thumb come scramble other fire many mulgar fall flat face learn peer precipice eye dim pierce break shrill eager whispering 
22,"""It is, perhaps, a wisp of snow, an eagle's feather, or maybe a nosegay of frost-flowers.""",wisp snow eagle feather nosegay frost flower 
23,"""What was the name of him who fell fighting?"" said Nod eagerly.",name fall fight say 
24,"""His name was Ubbookeera,"" said Ghibba.",name say 
25,"""Then,"" said Nod, ""there he hangs.""",say hang 
26,"""So be it, Eyes-of-an-Eagle,"" said Ghibba; ""we will go down before he melts and fetch him up."" So they drove two of their long staves into a crevice of the rocks. And Ghibba, being one of the strongest of them, and also nearly blind, crept to the end and unwound himself down; then one by one the rest of the Mountain-mulgars descended, till the last and least was gone.",say go melt fetch drive long stave crevice rock strong blind creep end unwound rest mulgar descend last least gone 
27,"""Hold my legs, Thumb, my brother, that I may see what they're at,"" said Nod. Thumb clutched him tight, and Nod edged on his stomach to the end of the bending pole. He saw far down the grey string of the Men of the Mountains dangling, but even the last of them was still twenty or thirty Mulgars off the Tummusc-bush. He heard their shrill chirping. And presently the first sunbeam trembled over the wall of the mountain above them, and beamed clear into the valley. Nod wriggled back to Thumb. ""They cannot reach him,"" he said. ""He lies there huddled up, Thumb, in a Tummusc-bush, just as he fell.""",hold leg brother see say thumb clutch edged stomach end bending pole see grey string dangle last hear shrill chirping first sunbeam tremble wall mountain beam valley nod wriggle reach say lie huddle fall 
28,"""Why, then,"" said Thumb, ""he must have hung dead all night. The eagles will have picked his eyes out.""",say hang dead night eagle pick eye 
29,"In a little while the last and least of the Mountain-mulgars crept back over Ghibba's shoulders and scrambled on to the path. He was a little blinking fellow, and in colour patched like damask.",little while last least mulgar creep shoulder scramble path little blink fellow colour patch damask 
30,"""Is he dead? Is he dead? Is thy 'Messimut' dead?"" said Nod, leaning his head.",dead dead dead say lean head 
31,"""He is dead, Mulla-mulgar, or in his second sleep,"" he answered.",dead mulgar second sleep answer 
32,"Now, all the Mulgar beads on that strange string stood whispering and nodding together. Ghibba presently turned away from them, and began raking back the last smoulderings of their watch-fire.",bead strange string stand whisper nodd turn begin rake last smouldering watch fire 
33,"""What will you do?"" said Nod. ""Why do you drag back the embers?""",do say drag ember 
34,"""The swiftest of us is going back to bring a longer 'rope' and stronger staves and Samarak, and, alive or dead, they will drag him up. But we go on, Mulla-mulgar.""",swiftest go bring long rope strong stave alive dead drag go 
35,"""Ohé,"" said Nod softly; ""but will he not be melted by then, Prince of the Mountains? Will not the eagle's feather be blown away? Will not the frost flowers have melted from the bush?""",say melt eagle feather blow frost flower melt bush 
36,"Ghibba turned his grave, hairy face to Nod.",turn grave hairy face 
37,"""The Men of the Mountains will remember you in their drones, Mulla-mulgar, for saving the life of their kinsman; they will call you in their singing 'Mulla-mulgar Eengenares'""--that is, Royal-mulgar with the Eyes of an Eagle.",remember drone mulgar save life kinsman call sing royal 
38,"Nod laughed. ""Already am I in my brothers' thoughts Prince of Bonfires, Noddle of Pork; if only I could see through Zut, they also might call me Eengenares, too.""",nod laugh brother thought see call 
39,"All were in haste now, binding up what remained of faggots and torches, combing and beating themselves and quenching the fires. Soon the Mulgar who had been chosen to return had rubbed noses and bidden them all farewell, and had set out on his lonely journey home. Thimble still lay in a deep sleep, and so cold after the heats of fever that they had to muffle him twice or thrice in shadow-blankets to regain his warmth.",haste bind remain faggot torche comb beat quench fire choose return rub nose bidd farewell set lonely journey thimble lay deep sleep cold heat fever have muffle shadow blanket regain warmth 
40,"When they had trudged on a league or so the day began to darken with cloud. And a thin smoke began to fume up from below. The travellers pressed on in all haste, so fast that the tongues of the bearers of Thimble's litter lolled between their teeth. Wind rose in scurries, and every peak was shrouded. Unnatural gloom thickened around the lean, straggling troop of Mulgars. And almost before they had time to drive in their long poles, as shepherds drive in posts for their wattles, and to swathe and bind themselves close into the sloping rock, the tempest broke over them. A dense and tossing cloud of ice beat up on the wind, so that soon the huddled travellers looked like nothing else than a long low mound on the Mulgar pass, heaped high with the drifting crystals. On every peak and crest the lightning played blue and crackling. In its flash the air hung still, bewitched with snow-flakes. Thunder and wind made such a clamour between them that Nod could scarcely hear himself think. But the travellers sat mute and glum, and moved never a finger. Such storms sweep like wild birds through these mountains of Arakkaboa, and, like birds, are as quickly flown away. For in a little while all was peace again and silence. And the sun broke in flames out of the pale sky, shining in peaceful beauty upon the mountains, as if, indeed, the snow-white Zevveras of Tishnar had passed by.",trudge league day begin dark cloud thin smoke begin fome traveller press haste tongue bearer litter loll tooth wind rise scurry peak shroud unnatural gloom thicken lean straggle troop have time drive long pole shepherd drive post wattle swathe bind slope rock tempest break dense toss cloud ice beat wind huddle traveller look else long low mound pass heap drift crystal peak crest lightning play blue crackle flash air hang bewitch snow flake thunder wind make clamour hear think traveller sit mute glum move finger such storm sweep wild bird mountain bird fly little while peace silence sun break flame pale sky shine peaceful beauty mountain snow white pass 
41,"The travellers soon beat each other free of their snow, and danced and slapped themselves warm. And now they were rejoiced to see in the distant clearness peeping above the shoulder of Makkri that league-long needle Moot. The pass now began to widen, and a little before noonday they broke out into a broad and steep declivity of snow. And, seeing that they had but lately rested themselves, and soon would be journeying in shelter from the sun, they did not tarry for their ""glare,"" or middle-day sleep.",traveller beat other free snow dance slap warm rejoice see distant clearness peep shoulder league long needle pass begin wide little noonday break broad steep declivity snow see have rest journey shelter sun tarry glare middle day sleep 
42,"Their breath hung like smoke on the icy air. They sank at every step wellnigh up to their middles in snow, and were all but wearied out when at last they climbed up into a gorge cut sheer between bare walls of rock, and so lofty on either hand that daylight scarcely trembled down to them at the bottom.",breath hang smoke icy air sink step wellnigh middle snow weary last climb gorge cut sheer bare wall rock lofty hand daylight tremble bottom 
43,"So steep and glazed with ice was this gorge or gully that they were compelled to tie themselves together with strands of Cullum. They laid Thimble's litter on three long pieces of wood strapped together. Then, Ghibba going foremost, one by one they followed the ascent after him, stumbling and staggering, and heaving at the Cullum-rope to drag up poor Thimble on his slippery bed.",steep glaze ice gorge gully compel tie strand lay litter long piece wood strapp go foremost follow ascent stumble staggering heave rope drag poor slippery bed 
44,"The Men of the Mountains have bristly feet and long, hairy, hard-nailed toes. But Thumb and Nod, with their naked soles and shorter toes, could scarcely clutch the icy path at all, and fell so often they were soon stiff with bruises. Worse still, there frequents in the upper parts of these mountains a kind of witless or silly Mulgars, who are called Obobbomans, with very long noses. And just as men use a spyglass for sight, to magnify things and to bring things at a distance nearer, so these Obobbomans use their prolonged noses for smell. Long before Thumb and his company were come to their precipitous gully they had sniffed them out. And, being as mischievous as they are dull-witted, they had already scampered about, gathering together great heaps of stones, and had now set themselves in a row, sniffing and chattering, along the edge of the rock on both sides, and waited there concealed in ambush.",have foot long hairy hard nail toe naked sole short toe clutch icy path fall stiff bruise bad frequent upper part mountain kind witless silly call long nose man use spyglass sight magnify thing bring thing distance use prolonged nose smell company come precipitous gully sniff mischievous dull witted scamper gather great heap stone set row sniff chatter edge rock side wait conceal ambush 
45,"When the Men of the Mountains had climbed up some little way into the gorge, and were scrambling and stumbling on the ice, these Obobbomans began pelting them as fast as they could with their stones and snowballs and splinters of ice. These missiles, though not very large, fell heavily down the walls of the precipice. And soon the whole caravan of Mulgars was brought to a standstill, they were so battered and bewildered by the stones.",climb little way gorge scramble stumble ice begin pelt stone snowball splinter ice missile large fall wall precipice whole caravan bring standstill batter bewilder stone 
46,"As soon as the travellers stopped, these knavish Long-noses ceased to pelt them. So cautious and furtive are they that not a sign of them could be distinguished by the Mulgars staring up from below, though, indeed, a hundred or more of their thin snouts were actually protruded over the sides of the chasm, sniffing and trembling.",traveller stop knavish long nose cease pelt cautious furtive sign distinguish stare more thin snout protrude side chasm sniff tremble 
47,"""Does it always rain pebble-stones and lumps of ice in these miserable hills?"" said Thumb bitterly.",rain pebble stone lump ice miserable hill say 
48,"And Ghibba told him that it was the Long-nose mulgars who were molesting them. They squatted down to breathe themselves, hoping to tire out the Obobbomans. But the instant they stirred, down showered snowball, ice, and stones once more. The travellers bound faggots and blankets over their heads, and struggled on, but the faggots kept slipping loose, and did not cover their stooping backs and buttocks. They shouted, threatened, shook their hands towards the heights; one or two even flung pebbles up that only bounced down upon their own heads again. It was all in vain. They halted once more, and squatted down in despair. To add to their misery, it was so cold in this gorge that the breath of the Hill-mulgars froze in long icicles on their beards, and whensoever they turned to speak to one another, or if they sneezed (as they often did in the cold, and with the snuff-like ice-dust), their fringes tinkled like glass. At last Ghibba, who had been sitting lost in thought of what to be doing next, suddenly groped his way forward, and bade two of his people sit down to their firesticks to make fire.",tell long nose mulgar molest squatet breathe hope tire instant stirr shower snowball ice stone more traveller bind faggot blanket head struggle faggot keep slip cover stooping back buttock shout threaten shake hand height flung pebble bounce own head vain halt more squatet despair add misery cold gorge breath mulgar frize long icicle beard turn speak sneez do cold snuff ice dust fringe tinkle glass last sit lose thought do grope way bid person sit firestick make fire 
49,"""What is this Whisker-face tinkering at now?"" muttered Thumb. ""What is he after now? We had best have come alone.""",whisker face tinker mutter have good come 
50,"""I know not,"" said Nod; ""but if he can fight Noses, Thumb, as well as he can fight Beaks, we shall soon be getting on again.""",know say fight nose fight beak get 
51,"They crouched miserably in the snow, huddled up in shadow-blankets. The Obobbomans peeped further into the ravine, chattering together, at a loss to understand why the travellers were sitting there so still. But at last fire came to the firesticks, and Ghibba then bade two or three of his Mountaineers kindle torches. Whereupon he gave to each a bundle of the eagle feathers which they had plucked from the five carcasses on the pass, and told them to burn them piecemeal in their torches.",crouch snow huddle shadow blanket peep ravine chatter loss understand traveller sit last fire come firestick bid kindle torche give bundle eagle feather pluck carcass pass tell burn piecemeal torche 
52,"""Ghost of a Môh-man!"" grunted Thumb sourly; ""he has lost his cheesy wits!""",ghost man grunt lose cheesy wit 
53,"With feathers fizzling, away they went again, slipping, staggering, and straining at the rope. Down at once hailed the stones again, the Obobbomans gambolling and squealing with delight in their silly mischief. And now no longer little were the snowballs, for the Long-noses all this time had been busy making big ones. These four or five of them, shoving together, with noses laid sidelong, rolled slowly to the edge, and pushed over. Down they came, bounding and rebounding into the abyss, and broke into fragments on the travellers' heads. Some, too, of the craftier of the Long-noses had mingled stones and ice in these great balls.",feather fizzle go slip staggering strain rope hail stone gamboll squeal delight silly mischief little snowball long nose time busy make big one shove nose lay sidelong roll edge push come bound rebound abyss break fragment traveller head craftier long nose have mingle stone ice great ball 
54,"Thumb groaned and sweated in spite of the cold, for he, being by far the fattest and broadest of the travellers, received the most stones, and stumbled and fell far more often than the rest on his clumsy feet on the ice. Now, however, the smoke of the burning bunches of eagles' feathers was mounting in pale blue clouds through the gorge. It was enough. At the first sniff and savour of this evil smoke the Long-noses paused in their mischief, coughing and sneezing. At the next sniff they paused no longer. Away they scampered headlong, higgledy-piggledy, toppling one over another in their haste to be gone, squealing with disgust and horror; and the travellers at last were left in peace.",thumb groan sweat spite cold fattest broadest traveller receive most stone stumble fall rest clumsy foot ice smoke burning bunch eagle feather mount pale blue cloud gorge enough first sniff savour evil smoke long nose pause mischief cough sneez next sniff pause scamper headlong higgledy piggledy topple haste gone squeal disgust horror traveller last leave peace 
55,"""I began to fear, O Man of the Mountains,"" grunted Thumb to Ghibba, ""that your wits had got frostbitten. But I am not too old nor fat to learn wisdom.""",begin fear grunt wit get frostbitten old fat learn wisdom 
56,"Ghibba lifted his face and peered from under the bandage he had wound over his sore eyes into Thumb's bruised face. ""Munza or Mountains, there's wisdom for all, brave traveller,"" he said. ""They are very old friends of ours, these Long-noses; they could smell out a mouse's Meermut in the moon.""",lift face peer bandage wind sore eye bruise face be wisdom brave traveller say old friend long nose smell mouse moon
