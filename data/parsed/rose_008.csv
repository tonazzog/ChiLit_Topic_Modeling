1,CHAPTER VII. HOW GIGLIO AND ANGELICA HAD A QUARREL,have quarrel 
2,"The Court Painter of His Majesty the King of Crim Tartary returned to that monarch’s dominions, carrying away a number of sketches which he had made in the Paflagonian capital (you know, of course, my dears, that the name of that capital is Blombodinga); but the most charming of all his pieces was a portrait of the Princess Angelica, which all the Crim Tartar nobles came to see. With this work the King was so delighted, that he decorated the Painter with his Order of the Pumpkin (sixth class) and the artist became Sir Tomaso Lorenzo, K.P., thenceforth.",return monarch dominion carry number sketche make capital know course dear name capital charming piece portrait noble come see work delighted decorate sixth class artist become 
3,"King Valoroso also sent Sir Tomaso his Order of the Cucumber, besides a handsome order for money, for he painted the King, Queen, and principal nobility while at Blombodinga, and became all the fashion, to the perfect rage of all the artists in Paflagonia, where the King used to point to the portrait of Prince Bulbo, which Sir Tomaso had left behind him, and say ‘Which among you can paint a picture like that?’",send handsome order money paint principal nobility become fashion perfect rage artist use point portrait leave say paint picture 
4,"It hung in the royal parlour over the royal sideboard, and Princess Angelica could always look at it as she sat making the tea. Each day it seemed to grow handsomer and handsomer, and the Princess grew so fond of looking at it, that she would often spill the tea over the cloth, at which her father and mother would wink and wag their heads, and say to each other, ‘Aha! we see how things are going.’",hang royal parlour royal sideboard look sit make tea day seem grow handsomer handsomer grow fond look spill tea cloth father mother wink be head say other see thing go 
5,"In the meantime poor Giglio lay upstairs very sick in his chamber, though he took all the doctor’s horrible medicines like a good young lad; as I hope YOU do, my dears, when you are ill and mamma sends for the medical man. And the only person who visited Giglio (besides his friend the captain of the guard, who was almost always busy or on parade), was little Betsinda the housemaid, who used to do his bedroom and sitting-room out, bring him his gruel, and warm his bed.",meantime poor lay sick chamber take doctor horrible medicine good young lad hope do dear ill mamma send medical man only person visit friend captain guard busy parade little housemaid use do bedroom sitting room bring gruel warm bed 
6,"When the little housemaid came to him in the morning and evening, Prince Giglio used to say, ‘Betsinda, Betsinda, how is the Princess Angelica?’",little housemaid come morning evening use say 
7,"And Betsinda used to answer, ‘The Princess is very well, thank you, my Lord.’ And Giglio would heave a sigh, and think, if Angelica were sick, I am sure _I_ should not be very well.",use answer thank heave sigh think sick sure 
8,"Then Giglio would say, ‘Betsinda, has the Princess Angelica asked for me today?’ And Betsinda would answer, ‘No, my Lord, not today’; or, ‘she was very busy practicing the piano when I saw her’; or, ‘she was writing invitations for an evening party, and did not speak to me’; or make some excuse or other, not strictly consonant with truth: for Betsinda was such a good-natured creature that she strove to do everything to prevent annoyance to Prince Giglio, and even brought him up roast chicken and jellies from the kitchen (when the Doctor allowed them, and Giglio was getting better), saying, ‘that the Princess had made the jelly, or the bread-sauce, with her own hands, on purpose for Giglio.’",say ask today answer today busy practice piano see write invitation evening party speak make excuse other consonant truth good natured creature strive do prevent annoyance bring roast chicken jelly kitchen allow get good say make jelly bread sauce own hand purpose 
9,"When Giglio heard this he took heart and began to mend immediately; and gobbled up all the jelly, and picked the last bone of the chicken--drumsticks, merry-thought, sides’-bones, back, pope’s nose, and all--thanking his dear Angelica; and he felt so much better the next day, that he dressed and went downstairs, where, whom should he meet but Angelica going into the drawing-room? All the covers were off the chairs, the chandeliers taken out of the bags, the damask curtains uncovered, the work and things carried away, and the handsomest albums on the tables. Angelica had her hair in papers: in a word, it was evident there was going to be a party.",hear take heart begin mend gobble jelly pick last bone chicken drumstick merry think side bone pope nose thank dear feel good next day dress go meet go draw room cover chair chandelier take bag damask curtain uncover work thing carry handsomest album table have hair paper word evident go be party

11,"‘Yes, dear Angelica, I am come downstairs, and feel so well today, thanks to the FOWL and the JELLY.’",dear come feel today thanks 
12,"‘What do I know about fowls and jellies, that you allude to them in that rude way?’ says Angelica.",know fowl jelly allude rude way say 
13,"‘Why, didn’t--didn’t you send them, Angelica dear?’ says Giglio.",send dear say 
14,"‘I send them indeed! Angelica dear! No, Giglio dear,’ says she, mocking him, ‘_I_ was engaged in getting the rooms ready for His Royal Highness the Prince of Crim Tartary, who is coming to pay my papa’s Court a visit.’",send dear dear say mocking engage get room ready royal come pay papa court visit 
15,"‘The--Prince--of--Crim--Tartary!’ Giglio said, aghast.",say aghast 
16,"‘Yes, the Prince of Crim Tartary,’ says Angelica, mocking him. ‘I dare say you never heard of such a country. What DID you ever hear of? You don’t know whether Crim Tartary is on the Red Sea or on the Black Sea, I dare say.’",say mocking say hear country hear know red black say 
17,"‘Yes, I do, it’s on the Red Sea,’ says Giglio, at which the Princess burst out laughing at him, and said, ‘Oh, you ninny! You are so ignorant, you are really not fit for society! You know nothing but about horses and dogs, and are only fit to dine in a mess-room with my Royal father’s heaviest dragoons. Don’t look so surprised at me, sir: go and put your best clothes on to receive the Prince, and let me get the drawing-room ready.’",red say burst laugh say ignorant fit society know horse dog fit dine mess room royal father heavy dragoon look surprise sir go put good clothes receive let get draw room ready 
18,"Giglio said, ‘Oh, Angelica, Angelica, I didn’t think this of you. THIS wasn’t your language to me when you gave me this ring, and I gave you mine in the garden, and you gave me that k--’",say think language give ring give garden give k--’ 
19,"But what k was we never shall know, for Angelica, in a rage, cried, ‘Get out, you saucy, rude creature! How dare you to remind me of your rudeness? As for your little trumpery twopenny ring, there, sir, there!’ And she flung it out of the window.",k know rage cry get saucy rude creature dare remind rudeness little trumpery twopenny ring sir flung window 
20,"‘It was my mother’s marriage-ring,’ cried Giglio.",mother marriage ring cry 
21,"‘_I_ don’t care whose marriage-ring it was,’ cries Angelica. ‘Marry the person who picks it up if she’s a woman; you shan’t marry ME. And give me back MY ring. I’ve no patience with people who boast about the things they give away! _I_ know who’ll give me much finer things than you ever gave me. A beggarly ring indeed, not worth five shillings!’",care marriage ring cry marry person pick woman marry give ring have patience person boast thing give know give much finer thing give ring worth shilling 
22,"Now Angelica little knew that the ring which Giglio had given her was a fairy ring: if a man wore it, it made all the women in love with him; if a woman, all the gentlemen. The Queen, Giglio’s mother, quite an ordinary-looking person, was admired immensely whilst she wore this ring, and her husband was frantic when she was ill. But when she called her little Giglio to her, and put the ring on his finger, King Savio did not seem to care for his wife so much any more, but transferred all his love to little Giglio. So did everybody love him as long as he had the ring; but when, as quite a child, he gave it to Angelica, people began to love and admire HER; and Giglio, as the saying is, played only second fiddle.",little know ring give fairy ring man wear make woman love woman gentleman mother ordinary look person admire wear ring husband frantic ill call little put ring finger seem care wife more transfer love little love have ring child give person begin love admire saying play second fiddle 
23,"‘Yes,’ says Angelica, going on in her foolish ungrateful way. ‘_I_ know who’ll give me much finer things than your beggarly little pearl nonsense.’",say go foolish ungrateful way know give much finer thing beggarly little pearl nonsense 
24,"‘Very good, miss! You may take back your ring too!’ says Giglio, his eyes flashing fire at her, and then, as his eyes had been suddenly opened, he cried out, ‘Ha! what does this mean? Is THIS the woman I have been in love with all my life? Have I been such a ninny as to throw away my regard upon you? Why--actually--yes--you are a little crooked!’",good miss take ring say eye flash fire eye open cry mean woman love life ninny throw regard little crooked 
25,"‘Oh, you wretch!’ cries Angelica.",wretch cry 
26,"‘And, upon my conscience, you--you squint a little.’",conscience squint little 
27,‘Eh!’ cries Angelica.,cry 
28,‘And your hair is red--and you are marked with the smallpox--and what? you have three false teeth--and one leg shorter than the other!’,hair red mark smallpox have false tooth leg short other 
29,"‘You brute, you brute, you!’ Angelica screamed out: and as she seized the ring with one hand, she dealt Giglio one, two, three smacks on the face, and would have pulled the hair off his head had he not started laughing, and crying--",brute brute scream seize ring hand deal smack face pull hair head start laugh cry 
30,"‘Oh dear me, Angelica, don’t pull out MY hair, it hurts! You might remove a great deal of YOUR OWN, as I perceive, without scissors or pulling at all. Oh, ho, ho! ha, ha, ha! ho he he!’",pull hair hurt remove great deal own perceive scissors pull 
31,"And he nearly choked himself with laughing, and she with rage; when, with a low bow, and dressed in his Court habit, Count Gambabella, the first lord-in-waiting, entered and said, ‘Royal Highnesses! Their Majesties expect you in the Pink Throne-room, where they await the arrival of the Prince of CRIM TARTARY.’",choke laugh rage low bow dress court habit first lord waiting enter say royal majesty expect pink room await arrival
