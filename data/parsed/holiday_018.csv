3," Frank felt no unnatural apathy or indifference about dying, for he looked upon it with awe, though not with fear; nor did he express any rapturous excitement on the solemn occasion, knowing that death is an appointed penalty for transgression, which, though deprived of its sharpest sting by the triumphs of the cross, yet awfully testifies to all succeeding generations, that each living man has individually merited the utmost wrath of God, and that the last moment on earth, of even the most devoted Christian, must be darkened by the gloom of our original sin and natural corruption. Yet, ""as in Adam all die, so in Christ are all made alive;"" and amidst the throng of consolatory and affecting meditations that crowded into his mind on the great subject of our salvation, he kept a little book in which were carefully recorded such texts and reflections as he considered likely to strengthen his own faith, and to comfort those he left behind--saying one day to Major Graham,",feel unnatural apathy indifference die look awe fear express rapturous excitement solemn occasion know death appoint penalty transgression deprive sharp sting triumph cross testify succeed generation living man merite utmost wrath last moment earth devoted darken gloom original sin natural corruption die make alive throng consolatory affect meditation crowd mind great subject salvation keep little book record such text reflection consider likely strengthen own faith comfort leave say day 
4,"""Tell grandmama, that though my days have been few upon the earth, they were happy! When you think of me, uncle David, after my sufferings are over, it may well be a pleasing remembrance, that you were always the best, the kindest of friends. Oh! how kind! but I must not--cannot speak of that----. This is my birth-day!--my last birth-day! Many a joyous one we kept together, but those merry days are over, and these sadder ones too shall cease; yet the time is fast approaching, so welcome to us both,",tell grandmama day few earth happy think uncle suffering pleasing remembrance good kindest friend kind speak birth day last birth day many joyous one keep merry day sadder one cease time fast approach

6,"In the evening, Major Graham observed that Frank made Mrs. Crabtree bring everything belonging to him, and lay it on the table, when he employed himself busily in tying up a number of little parcels, remarking, with a languid smile,",evening observe make bring belong lay table employ tie number little parcel remark languid smile 
7,"""My possessions are not valuable, but these are for some old friends and messmates, who will be pleased to receive a trifling memorial of one who loved them. Send my dirk to Peter Grey, who is much reformed now. Here are all the letters any of you ever sent me; how very often they have been read! but now, even that intercourse must end; keep them, for they were the dearest treasures I possessed. At Madras, formerly, I remember hearing of a nabob who was bringing his whole fortune home in a chest of gold, but the ropes for hoisting his treasure on board were so insufficient, that the whole gave way, and it fell into the ocean, never to be recovered. That seemed a very sudden termination of his hopes and plans, but scarcely more unexpected than my own. 'We are a wind that passeth away and cometh not again.' Many restless nights are ordained for me now, probably that I may find no resource but prayer and meditation. Others can afford time to slumber, but I so soon shall sleep the sleep of death, that it becomes a blessing to have such hours of solitary thought, for preparing my heart and establishing my faith, during this moment of need.""",possession valuable old friend messmate pleased receive trifl memorial love send dirk reform letter send read intercourse end keep dearest treasure possess remember hear nabob bring whole fortune chest gold rope hoist treasure board insufficient whole give way fall ocean recover seem sudden termination hope plan unexpected own wind passeth cometh many restless night ordain find resource prayer meditation other afford time slumber sleep sleep death become blessing have such hour solitary thought prepare heart establish faith moment need 
8,"""Yes, Frank! but your prayers are not solitary, for ours are joined to yours,"" added Laura. ""I read in an old author lately, that Christian friends in this world might be compared to travellers going along the same road in separate carriages--sometimes they are together--often they are apart--sometimes they can exchange assistance, as we do now--and often they jostle against each other, till at last, having reached the journey's end, they are removed out of these earthly vehicles into a better state, where they shall look back upon former circumstances, and know even as they are known.""",prayer solitary join add read old author christian friend world compare traveller go same road separate carriage exchange assistance do jostle other last reach journey end remove earthly vehicle good state look former circumstance know know 
9,"Laura was often astonished to observe the change which had taken place in her own character and feelings within the very short period of their distress. Her extreme terror of a thunder-storm formerly, had occasioned many a jest to her brothers, when Harry used, occasionally, to roll heavy weights in the room above her own, to imitate the loudest peals, while Frank sometimes endeavoured to argue her out of that excessive apprehension with which she listened to the most distant surmise of a storm. Now, however, at Hammersmith, long after midnight, the moon, on one occasion, became completely obscured by dense heavy clouds, and the air felt so oppressively hot, that Frank, who seemed unusually breathless, drew closer to the window. Laura supported his head, and was deeply occupied in talking to him, when suddenly a broad flash of lightning glared into the room, followed by a crash of thunder, that seemed to crack the very heavens. Again and again the lightning gleamed in her face with such vividness, that Laura fancied she could distinguish the heat of it, and yet she stirred not, nor did a single exclamation, as in former days, arise on her lips.",astonished observe change take place own character feeling short period distress extreme terror thunder storm occasion many jest brother use roll heavy weight room own imitate loudest peal endeavour argue excessive apprehension listen distant surmise storm midnight moon occasion become obscure dense heavy cloud air feel hot seem breathless draw close window support head occupy talk broad flash lightning glare room follow crash thunder seem crack very heaven lightning gleam face such vividness fancy distinguish heat stirr do single exclamation former day arise lip 
10,"""Pray shut the window, Laura,"" said Frank languidly, raising his eyes; ""and be so kind as to close the shutters!""",pray shut window say raise eye kind close shutter 
11,"""Why, Frank?--you never used to be alarmed by thunder!""",use alarm thunder 
12,"""No! nor am I now, dear Laura. What danger need a dying person fear? Some few hours sooner or later would be of little consequence--",dear danger need die person fear few hour little consequence 
13,"    Come he slow, or come he fast,     It is but death that comes at last.",come slow come fast death come last 
14,"Yet, Laura, do you think I have forgotten old times! Oh, no!--not while I live. You attend to my feelings, and surely it is my duty to remember yours.""",think forget old time live attend feeling duty remember 
15,"""Never mind me, Frank!"" whispered Laura. ""I have got over all that folly. When real fears and sorrows come, we care no more about those that were imaginary.""",mind whisper get folly real fear sorrow come care more imaginary 
16,"""True, my dear sister; and there is no courage or fortitude like that derived from faith in a superintending providence. Though all creation reel, we may sleep in peace, for to Christians 'danger is safe, and tumult calm.'""",true dear sister be courage fortitude derive faith superintend creation reel sleep peace danger safe tumult calm 
17,"When Frank grew worse, he became often delirious. Yet as in health he had been habitually cheerful, his mind generally wandered to agreeable subjects. He fancied himself walking on the bright meadows, and picking flowers by the river side,--meeting Lady Harriet,--and even speaking to his father, as if Sir Edward had been present; while Harry and Laura listened, weeping and trembling, to behold the wreck of such a mind and heart as his. One evening, he seemed unusually well, and requested that his arm-chair might be wheeled to the open window, where he gazed with delight at the hills and meadows,--the clouds and glittering water,--the cattle standing in the stream,--the boats reflected on its surface,--and the roses fluttering at every casement.",grow bad become delirious health cheerful mind wander agreeable subject fancy walk bright meadow pick flower river side meet speak father present listen weep tremble behold wreck mind heart evening seem request arm chair wheel open window gaze delight hill meadow cloud glitter water cattle stand stream boat reflect surface rose flutter casement 
18,"""Those joyous little birds!--their song makes me cheerful,"" said he, in a tone of placid enjoyment. ""I have been in countries where the birds never sing, and the leaves never fade; but they excited no sympathy or interest. Here we have notes of gladness both in sunshine and storm, teaching us a lesson of grateful contentment,--while those drooping roses preach a sermon to me, for as easily might they recover freshness and bloom as myself. We shall both lie low before long in the dust, yet a spring shall come hereafter to revive even 'the ashes of the urn.' Then, uncle David, we meet again,--not as now, amidst sorrow and suffering, with death and separation before us,--but blessed by the consciousness that our sins are forgiven,--our trials all ended,--and that our afflictions which were but for a moment, have worked out for us a far more exceeding, even an eternal weight of glory.""",joyous little bird song make cheerful say tone placid enjoyment country bird sing leave fade excite sympathy interest have note gladness sunshine storm teach lesson grateful contentment droop rose preach sermon recover freshness bloom lie low dust spring come revive ash urn uncle meet sorrow suffering death separation bless consciousness sin forgive trial end affliction moment work exceeding eternal weight glory 
19,"Some hours afterwards the Doctor entered. After receiving a cordial welcome from Frank, and feeling his pulse, he instantly examined his arms and neck, which were covered entirely over with small red spots, upon observing which, the friendly physician suddenly changed countenance, and stole an alarmed glance at Major Graham.",hour enter receive cordial welcome feel pulse examine arm neck cover small red spot observe friendly physician change countenance steal alarm glance 
20,"""I feel easier and better to-day, Doctor, than at any time since my illness,"" said Frank, looking earnestly in his face. ""Do you think this eruption will do me good? Life has much that would be dear to me, while I have friends like these to live for. Can it be possible that I may yet recover?""",feel easy good day time illness say look face think eruption do good life have much dear have friend live possible recover 
21,"The Doctor turned away, unable to reply, while Frank intensely watched his countenance, and then gazed at the pale agitated face of Major Graham. Gradually the hope which had brightened in his cheek began to fade,--the lustre of his eye became dim,--his countenance settled into an expression of mournful resignation,--and covering his face with his hands, he said, in a voice of deep emotion,",turn unable reply watch countenance gaze pale agitate face hope brighten cheek begin fade lustre eye become dim countenance settle expression mournful resignation cover face hand say voice deep emotion 
22,"""I see how it is!--God's will be done!""",see do 
23,"The silence of death succeeded, while Frank laid his head on the pillow and closed his eyes. A few natural tears coursed each other slowly down his cheek; but at length, an hour or two afterwards, being completely exhausted, he fell into a gentle sleep, from which the Doctor considered it very doubtful if he would ever awaken, as the red spots indicated mortification, which must inevitably terminate his life before next day.",silence death succeed lay head pillow close eye few natural tear course other cheek length hour exhaust fall gentle sleep consider doubtful awake red spot indicate mortification terminate life next day 
24,"Laura retired to the window, making a strenuous effort to restrain her feelings, that she might be enabled to witness the last awful scene; and fervently did she pray for such strength to sustain it with fortitude, as might still render her of some use to her dying brother. Her pale countenance might almost have been mistaken for that of a corpse, but for the expression of living agony in her eye; and she was sunk in deep, solemn thought, when her attention became suddenly roused by observing a chariot and four drive furiously up to the gate, while the horses were foaming and panting as they stopped. A tall gentleman, of exceedingly striking appearance, sprung hurriedly out, walked rapidly towards the cottage door, and in another minute entered Frank's room, with the animated look of one who expected to be gladly welcomed, and to occasion an agreeable surprise.",retire window make strenuous effort restrain feeling enable witness last awful scene pray such strength sustain fortitude render use die brother pale countenance mistaken corpse expression live agony eye sink deep solemn thought attention become rouse observe chariot drive gate horse foam pant stop tall gentleman strike appearance spring walk cottage door minute enter room animated look expect welcome occasion agreeable surprise 
25,"Harry and Laura shrunk close to their uncle, when the stranger, now in evident agitation, gazed round the room with an air of painful astonishment, till Major Graham looked round, and instantly started up with an exclamation of amazement, ""Edward! is it possible! This is indeed a consolation! you are still in time!""",shrink uncle stranger evident agitation gaze room air painful astonishment look start exclamation amazement possible consolation time 
26,"""In time!!"" exclaimed Sir Edward, grasping his brother's hand with vehement agitation. ""Do you mean to say that Frank is yet in danger!""",time exclaim grasp brother hand vehement agitation mean say danger 
27,"Major Graham mournfully shook his head, and undrawing the bed curtains, he silently pointed to the sleeping countenance of Frank, which was as still as death, and already overspread by a ghastly paleness. Sir Edward then sunk into a chair, and clenched his hands over his forehead with a look of unspeakable anguish, saying, in an under-tone, ""Worn out, as I am, in mind and body, I needed not this to destroy me! Say at once, brother, is there any hope?""",shake head undraw bed curtain point sleeping countenance death overspread ghastly paleness sink chair clench hand forehead look unspeakable anguish say tone worn mind body need destroy say brother be hope 
28,"""None, my dear Edward! None! Even now he is insensible, and I fear with little prospect of ever becoming conscious again.""",dear insensible fear little prospect become conscious 
29,"At this moment Frank opened his eyes, which were dim and glassy, while it became evident that he had relapsed into a state of temporary delirium.",moment open eye dim glassy become evident relaps state temporary delirium 
30,"""Get more candles! how very dark it is!"" he said. ""Who are all those people? Send away everybody but grandmama! I must speak to her alone. Never tell papa of all this, it would only distress him--say nothing about me. Why do Harry and Laura never come? They have been absent more than a week! Who took away uncle David too?""",get more candle dark say person send grandmama speak tell papa distress say come absent more week take uncle 
31,"Laura listened for some time in an agony of grief, till at last, unable any longer to restrain her feelings, she clasped Frank in her arms and burst into tears, exclaiming, in accents of piercing distress, ""Oh Frank! dear Frank! have you forgotten poor Laura?""",listen time agony grief last unable restrain feeling clasp arm burst tear exclaim accent pierce distress dear forget poor 
32,"""Not till I am dead!"" whispered he, while a momentary gleam of recollection lighted up his face. ""Laura! we meet again.""",dead whisper momentary gleam recollection light face meet 
33,"Sir Edward now wished to speak, but Frank had relapsed into a state of feeble unconsciousness, from which nothing could arouse him; once or twice he repeated the name of Laura in a low melancholy voice, till it became totally inaudible--his breath became shorter--his lips became livid--his whole frame seemed convulsed--and some hours afterwards, all that was mortal of Frank Graham ceased to exist. About four in the morning his body was at rest, and his spirit returned to God who gave it.",wish speak relaps state feeble unconsciousness arouse repeat name low melancholy voice become inaudible breath become short lip become livid whole frame seem convulse hour mortal cease exist morning body rest spirit return give 
34,"The candles had burned low in their sockets, and still the mourners remained, unwilling to move from the awful scene of their bereavement. Mrs. Crabtree at length, who laid out the body herself, extinguished the lights, and flung open the window curtains. Then suddenly a bright blaze of sunshine streamed into the room, and rested on the cold pale face of the dead. To the stunned and bewildered senses of Harry and Laura, the brilliant dawn of morning seemed like a mockery of their distress. Many persons were already passing by--the busy stir of life had begun, and a boy strolling along the road whistled his merry tune as he went gaily on.",candle burn low socket mourner remain unwilling move awful scene bereavement length lay body extinguish light flung open window curtain bright blaze sunshine stream room rest cold pale face dead stunn bewilder sense brilliant dawn morning seem mockery distress many person pass busy stir life begin boy stroll road whistle merry tune go 
35,"""We are indeed mere atoms in the world!"" thought Laura bitterly, while these sights and sounds fell heavily on her heart. ""If Harry and I had both been dead also, the sun would have shone as brightly, the birds sung as joyfully, and those people been all as gay and happy as ever! Nobody is thinking of Frank--nobody knows our misery--the world is going on as if nothing had happened, and we are breaking our hearts with grief!""",mere atom world think sight sound fall heart dead sun shine bird sung person gay happy think know misery world go happen break heart grief 
36,"Laura's heart became stilled as she gazed on the peaceful and almost happy expression of those beautiful features, which had now lost all appearance of suffering. The eyes, from which nothing but kindness and love had beamed upon her, were now closed for ever; the lips which had spoken only words of generous affection and pious hope, were silent; and the heart which had beat with every warm and brotherly feeling, was for the first time insensible to her sorrows; yet Laura did not give way to the strong excess of her grief, for it sunk upon her spirit with a leaden weight of anguish, which tears and lamentations could not express, and could not even relieve. She rose and kissed, for the last time, that beloved countenance, which she was never to look upon again till they met in heaven, and stole away to the silence and solitude of her own room, where Laura tried in vain to collect her thoughts. All seemed a dreary blank. She did not sigh--she could not weep; but she sat in dark and vacant abstraction, with one only consciousness filling her mind--the bitter remembrance that Frank was dead--that she could be of no farther use to him--that she could have no future intercourse with him--that even in her prayers she could no longer have the comfort of naming him; and when at last she turned to his own Bible which he had given her, to seek for consolation, her eyes refused their office, and the pages became blistered with tears.",heart become still gaze peaceful happy expression beautiful feature lose appearance suffering eye kindness love beam close lip speak word generous affection pious hope silent heart beat warm brotherly feeling first time insensible sorrow give way strong excess grief sink spirit leaden weight anguish tear lamentation express relieve rise kiss last time beloved countenance look meet heaven steal silence solitude own room try vain collect thought seem dreary blank sigh weep sit dark vacant abstraction only consciousness fill mind bitter remembrance dead far use have future intercourse prayer have comfort name last turn own give seek consolation eye refuse office page become blister tear 
37,"After Frank's funeral, Sir Edward became too ill to leave his bed; and Major Graham remained with him in constant conversation; while Harry and Laura did every thing to testify their affection, and to fill the place now so sadly vacant.",funeral become ill leave bed remain constant conversation do thing testify affection fill place vacant 
38,"On the following Sunday, several of the congregation at Hammersmith observed two young strangers in the rector's pew, dressed in the deepest mourning, with pale and downcast countenances, who glided early into church, and sat immoveably still, side by side, while Mr. Palmer gave out for his text the affecting and appropriate words which Frank himself had often repeated during his last illness, ""In an hour that ye think not, the Son of man cometh.""",follow several congregation observe young stranger rector pew dress deep mourn pale downcast countenance glide church sit side side give text affect appropriate word repeat last illness hour think son man cometh 
39,"Not a tear was shed by either Harry or Laura,--their grief was too great for utterance; yet they listened with breathless interest to the sermon, intended not only to console them, but also to instruct other young persons, from the afflicting event of Frank's death.",tear shed grief great utterance listen breathless interest sermon intend console instruct other young person afflict event death 
40,"Mr. Palmer took this opportunity to describe all the amiable dispositions of youth, and to show how much of what is pleasing may appear before religion has yet taken entire possession of the mind; but he painted in glowing colours the beautiful consistency and harmony of character which must ensue after that happy change, when the Holy Spirit renews the heart and influences the life. It almost seemed to Harry and Laura as if Frank were visibly before their eyes, when Mr. Palmer spoke in eloquent terms of that humility which no praise could diminish--that benevolence which attended to the feelings, as well as the wants of others,--that affection which was ever ready to make any sacrifice for those he loved,--that docility which obeyed the call of duty on every occasion,--that meekness in the midst of provocation which could not be irritated,--that gentle firmness in maintaining the truths of the gospel, which no opposition could intimidate,--that cheerful submission to suffering which saw a hand of mercy in the darkest hour,--and that faith which was ever ""forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,--pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.""",take opportunity describe amiable disposition youth show much pleasing appear religion take entire possession mind paint glow colour beautiful consistency harmony character ensue happy change holy renew heart influence life seem eye speak eloquent term humility praise diminish benevolence attend feeling want other affection ready make sacrifice love docility obey call duty occasion meekness midst provocation irritate gentle firmness maintain truth gospel opposition intimidate cheerful submission suffering see hand mercy dark hour faith forget thing reach thing press mark prize high calling 
41,"It seemed as if years had passed over the heads of Harry and Laura during the short period of their absence from home--that home where Frank had so anxiously desired to go! All was changed within and around them,--sorrow had filled their hearts, and no longer merry, thoughtless creatures, believing the world one scene of frolicsome enjoyment and careless ease; they had now witnessed its realities,--they had felt its trials,--they had experienced the importance of religion,--they had learned the frailty of all earthly joy,--and they had received, amidst tears and sorrows, the last injunction of a dying brother, to ""call upon the Lord while He is near, and to seek Him while he may yet be found.""",seem year pass head short period absence home home desire go change sorrow fill heart merry thoughtless creature believe world scene frolicsome enjoyment careless ease witness reality feel trial experience importance religion learn frailty earthly joy receive tear sorrow last injunction die brother call seek find 
42,"""Uncle David,"" said Laura one day, several months after their return home, ""Mrs. Crabtree first endeavoured to lead us aright by severity,--you and grandmama then tried what kindness could do, but nothing was effectual till now, when God Himself has laid His hand upon us. Oh! what a heavy stroke was necessary to bring me to my right mind, but now, while we weep many bitter tears, Harry and I often pray together that good may come out of evil, and that 'we who mourn so deeply, may find our best, our only comfort from above'.""",say day several month return endeavour lead severity grandmama try kindness do effectual lay hand heavy stroke necessary bring right mind weep many bitter tear pray good come evil mourn find good only comfort 
43,"  Unthinking, idle, wild, and young,   I laugh'd, and talk'd, and danc'd, and sung;   And proud of health, of frolic vain,   Dream'd not of sorrow, care, or pain,   Concluding in those hours of glee,   That all the world was made for me.",unthinking idle wild young laugh talk danc sung proud health frolic vain dream sorrow care pain conclude hour glee world make 
44,"  But when the days of trial came,   When sorrow shook this trembling frame,   When folly's gay pursuits were o'er,   And I could dance or sing no more;   It then occurr'd how sad 'twould be   Were this world only made for me.",day trial come sorrow shake tremble frame folly gay pursuit o'er dance sing occurr sad world make
