3,"The turning-point in our hero’s school career had now come, and the manner of it was as follows. On the evening of the first day of the next half-year, Tom, East, and another School-house boy, who had just been dropped at the Spread Eagle by the old Regulator, rushed into the matron’s room in high spirits, such as all real boys are in when they first get back, however fond they may be of home.",turning point hero school career come manner follow evening first day next half year house boy drop old rush matron room high spirit such real boy get fond home 
4,"“Well, Mrs. Wixie,” shouted one, seizing on the methodical, active, little dark-eyed woman, who was busy stowing away the linen of the boys who had already arrived into their several pigeon-holes, “here we are again, you see, as jolly as ever. Let us help you put the things away.”",shout seize methodical active little dark eyed woman busy stow linen boy arrive several pigeon hole see jolly let help put thing

You’ll find plenty more in the house.--Now, Master East, do let those things alone. You’re mixing up three new boys’ things.” And she rushed at East, who escaped round the open trunks holding up a prize.",bless boy cry last get word shake death go housekeeper room get supper know have time talk find plenty more house let thing mix new boy thing rush escape open trunk hold prize 
10,"“Hullo! look here, Tommy,” shouted he; “here’s fun!” and he brandished above his head some pretty little night-caps, beautifully made and marked, the work of loving fingers in some distant country home. The kind mother and sisters who sewed that delicate stitching with aching hearts little thought of the trouble they might be bringing on the young head for which they were meant. The little matron was wiser, and snatched the caps from East before he could look at the name on them.",look shout fun brandish head little night cap make mark work love finger distant country home kind mother sister sew delicate stitching ach heart little think trouble bring young head mean little matron wise snatch cap look name

15,"“O Master Brown,” went on the little matron, when the rest had gone, “you’re to have Gray’s study, Mrs. Arnold says. And she wants you to take in this young gentleman. He’s a new boy, and thirteen years old though he don’t look it. He’s very delicate, and has never been from home before. And I told Mrs. Arnold I thought you’d be kind to him, and see that they don’t bully him at first. He’s put into your form, and I’ve given him the bed next to yours in Number 4; so East can’t sleep there this half.”",go little matron rest go have study say want take young gentleman new boy year old look delicate home tell think kind see bully first put form give bed sleep half 
16,"Tom was rather put about by this speech. He had got the double study which he coveted, but here were conditions attached which greatly moderated his joy. He looked across the room, and in the far corner of the sofa was aware of a slight, pale boy, with large blue eyes and light fair hair, who seemed ready to shrink through the floor. He saw at a glance that the little stranger was just the boy whose first half-year at a public school would be misery to himself if he were left alone, or constant anxiety to any one who meant to see him through his troubles. Tom was too honest to take in the youngster, and then let him shift for himself; and if he took him as his chum instead of East, where were all his pet plans of having a bottled-beer cellar under his window, and making night-lines and slings, and plotting expeditions to Brownsover Mills and Caldecott’s Spinney? East and he had made up their minds to get this study, and then every night from locking-up till ten they would be together to talk about fishing, drink bottled-beer, read Marryat’s novels, and sort birds’ eggs. And this new boy would most likely never go out of the close, and would be afraid of wet feet, and always getting laughed at, and called Molly, or Jenny, or some derogatory feminine nickname.",put speech get double study covete condition attach moderate joy look room far corner sofa aware slight pale boy large blue eye light fair hair seem ready shrink floor see glance little stranger boy first half year public school misery leave alone constant anxiety one mean see trouble honest take youngster let shift take chum pet plan have bottled beer cellar window make night line sling plot expedition make mind get study night lock talk fishing drink bottled beer read novel sort bird egg new boy go close afraid wet foot laugh call derogatory feminine nickname 
17,"The matron watched him for a moment, and saw what was passing in his mind, and so, like a wise negotiator, threw in an appeal to his warm heart. “Poor little fellow,” said she, in almost a whisper; “his father’s dead, and he’s got no brothers. And his mamma--such a kind, sweet lady--almost broke her heart at leaving him this morning; and she said one of his sisters was like to die of decline, and so--”",matron watch moment see pass mind wise negotiator throw appeal warm heart poor little fellow say whisper father dead get brother mamma kind sweet lady break heart leave morning say sister die decline 
18,"“Well, well,” burst in Tom, with something like a sigh at the effort, “I suppose I must give up East.--Come along, young un. What’s your name? We’ll go and have some supper, and then I’ll show you our study.”",burst sigh effort suppose give come young un name go have supper show study 
19,"“His name’s George Arthur,” said the matron, walking up to him with Tom, who grasped his little delicate hand as the proper preliminary to making a chum of him, and felt as if he could have blown him away. “I’ve had his books and things put into the study, which his mamma has had new papered, and the sofa covered, and new green-baize curtains over the door” (the diplomatic matron threw this in, to show that the new boy was contributing largely to the partnership comforts). “And Mrs. Arnold told me to say,” she added, “that she should like you both to come up to tea with her. You know the way, Master Brown, and the things are just gone up, I know.”",name say matron walk grasp little delicate hand proper preliminary make chum feel blow have book thing put study mamma have new paper sofa cover new green baize curtain door diplomatic matron throw show new boy contribute partnership comfort tell say add like come tea know way thing go know 
20,"Here was an announcement for Master Tom! He was to go up to tea the first night, just as if he were a sixth or fifth form boy, and of importance in the School world, instead of the most reckless young scapegrace amongst the fags. He felt himself lifted on to a higher social and moral platform at once. Nevertheless he couldn’t give up without a sigh the idea of the jolly supper in the housekeeper’s room with East and the rest, and a rush round to all the studies of his friends afterwards, to pour out the deeds and wonders of the holidays, to plot fifty plans for the coming half-year, and to gather news of who had left and what new boys had come, who had got who’s study, and where the new praepostors slept. However, Tom consoled himself with thinking that he couldn’t have done all this with the new boy at his heels, and so marched off along the passages to the Doctor’s private house with his young charge in tow, in monstrous good-humour with himself and all the world.",announcement master go tea first night sixth fifth form boy importance world reckless young scapegrace fag feel lift high social moral platform give sigh idea jolly supper housekeeper room rest rush study friend pour deed wonder holiday plot plan come half year gather news leave new boy come get study new praepostor sleep console think do new boy heel march passage private house young charge tow monstrous good humour world 
21,"It is needless, and would be impertinent, to tell how the two young boys were received in that drawing-room. The lady who presided there is still living, and has carried with her to her peaceful home in the north the respect and love of all those who ever felt and shared that gentle and high-bred hospitality. Ay, many is the brave heart, now doing its work and bearing its load in country curacies, London chambers, under the Indian sun, and in Australian towns and clearings, which looks back with fond and grateful memory to that School-house drawing-room, and dates much of its highest and best training to the lessons learnt there.",needless impertinent tell young boy receive draw room lady preside live carry peaceful home north respect love feel share gentle high breed hospitality many brave heart do work bear load country curacy chamber indian sun australian town clearing look fond grateful memory school house draw room date much high good training lesson learn 
22,"Besides Mrs. Arnold and one or two of the elder children, there were one of the younger masters, young Brooke (who was now in the sixth, and had succeeded to his brother’s position and influence), and another sixth-form boy, talking together before the fire. The master and young Brooke, now a great strapping fellow six feet high, eighteen years old, and powerful as a coal-heaver, nodded kindly to Tom, to his intense glory, and then went on talking. The other did not notice them. The hostess, after a few kind words, which led the boys at once and insensibly to feel at their ease and to begin talking to one another, left them with her own children while she finished a letter. The young ones got on fast and well, Tom holding forth about a prodigious pony he had been riding out hunting, and hearing stories of the winter glories of the lakes, when tea came in, and immediately after the Doctor himself.",elder child be young master young sixth succeed brother position influence sixth form boy talk fire master young great strapping fellow foot high year old powerful coal heaver nod intense glory go talk other notice hostess few kind word lead boy feel ease begin talk leave own child finish letter young one get hold prodigious pony ride hunt hear story winter glory lake tea come 
23,"How frank, and kind, and manly was his greeting to the party by the fire! It did Tom’s heart good to see him and young Brooke shake hands, and look one another in the face; and he didn’t fail to remark that Brooke was nearly as tall and quite as broad as the Doctor. And his cup was full when in another moment his master turned to him with another warm shake of the hand, and, seemingly oblivious of all the late scrapes which he had been getting into, said, “Ah, Brown, you here! I hope you left your father and all well at home?”",frank kind manly greeting party fire do heart good see young shake hand look face fail remark tall broad cup full moment master turn warm shake hand oblivious late scrape get say hope leave father home 
24,"“Yes, sir, quite well.”",sir 
25,"“And this is the little fellow who is to share your study. Well, he doesn’t look as we should like to see him. He wants some Rugby air, and cricket. And you must take him some good long walks, to Bilton Grange, and Caldecott’s Spinney, and show him what a little pretty country we have about here.”",little fellow share study look like see want rugby air cricket take good long walk show little pretty country have 
26,"Tom wondered if the Doctor knew that his visits to Bilton Grange were for the purpose of taking rooks’ nests (a proceeding strongly discountenanced by the owner thereof), and those to Caldecott’s Spinney were prompted chiefly by the conveniences for setting night-lines. What didn’t the Doctor know? And what a noble use he always made of it! He almost resolved to abjure rook-pies and night-lines for ever. The tea went merrily off, the Doctor now talking of holiday doings, and then of the prospects of the half-year--what chance there was for the Balliol scholarship, whether the eleven would be a good one. Everybody was at his ease, and everybody felt that he, young as he might be, was of some use in the little School world, and had a work to do there.",wonder know visit purpose take rook nest proceeding discountenance owner prompt convenience setting night line know noble use make resolve abjure rook pie night line tea go talk holiday doing prospect half year chance be scholarship good one ease feel young use little world have work do 
27,"Soon after tea the Doctor went off to his study, and the young boys a few minutes afterwards took their leave and went out of the private door which led from the Doctor’s house into the middle passage.",tea go study young boy few minute take leave go private door lead house middle passage 
28,"At the fire, at the farther end of the passage, was a crowd of boys in loud talk and laughter. There was a sudden pause when the door opened, and then a great shout of greeting, as Tom was recognized marching down the passage.",fire far end passage crowd boy loud talk laughter be sudden pause door open great shout greeting recognize march passage

42,"“What a queer chum for Tom Brown,” was the comment at the fire; and it must be confessed so thought Tom himself, as he lighted his candle, and surveyed the new green-baize curtains and the carpet and sofa with much satisfaction.",queer chum comment fire confess think light candle survey new green baize curtain carpet sofa much satisfaction 
43,"“I say, Arthur, what a brick your mother is to make us so cozy! But look here now; you must answer straight up when the fellows speak to you, and don’t be afraid. If you’re afraid, you’ll get bullied. And don’t you say you can sing; and don’t you ever talk about home, or your mother and sisters.”",say brick mother make cozy look answer fellow speak afraid afraid bull say sing talk home mother sister

Why, your school-books look like novels.”",like talk boy know call home sick mamma darling such stuff jolly desk stunning binding school book look novel 
47,"And Tom was soon deep in Arthur’s goods and chattels, all new, and good enough for a fifth-form boy, and hardly thought of his friends outside till the prayer-bell rang.",deep goods chattel new good fifth form boy think friend prayer bell ring 
48,"I have already described the School-house prayers. They were the same on the first night as on the other nights, save for the gaps caused by the absence of those boys who came late, and the line of new boys who stood all together at the farther table--of all sorts and sizes, like young bears with all their troubles to come, as Tom’s father had said to him when he was in the same position. He thought of it as he looked at the line, and poor little slight Arthur standing with them, and as he was leading him upstairs to Number 4, directly after prayers, and showing him his bed. It was a huge, high, airy room, with two large windows looking on to the School close. There were twelve beds in the room. The one in the farthest corner by the fireplace, occupied by the sixth-form boy, who was responsible for the discipline of the room, and the rest by boys in the lower-fifth and other junior forms, all fags (for the fifth-form boys, as has been said, slept in rooms by themselves). Being fags, the eldest of them was not more than about sixteen years old, and were all bound to be up and in bed by ten. The sixth-form boys came to bed from ten to a quarter-past (at which time the old verger came round to put the candles out), except when they sat up to read.",describe school house prayer same first night other night save gap cause absence boy come line new boy stand far table sort size young bear trouble come father say same position think look line poor little slight stand lead prayer show bed huge high airy room large window look close be bed room one farthest corner fireplace occupy sixth form boy responsible discipline room rest boy low fifth other junior form fag fifth form boy say sleep room fag old more year old bind bed sixth form boy come bed quarter past time old verger come put candle sit read 
49,"Within a few minutes therefore of their entry, all the other boys who slept in Number 4 had come up. The little fellows went quietly to their own beds, and began undressing, and talking to each other in whispers; while the elder, amongst whom was Tom, sat chatting about on one another’s beds, with their jackets and waistcoats off. Poor little Arthur was overwhelmed with the novelty of his position. The idea of sleeping in the room with strange boys had clearly never crossed his mind before, and was as painful as it was strange to him. He could hardly bear to take his jacket off; however, presently, with an effort, off it came, and then he paused and looked at Tom, who was sitting at the bottom of his bed talking and laughing.",few minute entry other boy sleep come little fellow go own bed begin undress talk other whisper elder sit chat bed jacket waistcoat poor little overwhelm novelty position idea sleep room strange boy cross mind painful strange bear take jacket effort come pause look sit bottom bed talk laugh 
50,"“Please, Brown,” he whispered, “may I wash my face and hands?”",whisper wash face hand 
51,"“Of course, if you like,” said Tom, staring; “that’s your washhand-stand, under the window, second from your bed. You’ll have to go down for more water in the morning if you use it all.” And on he went with his talk, while Arthur stole timidly from between the beds out to his washhand-stand, and began his ablutions, thereby drawing for a moment on himself the attention of the room.",course like say stare washhand stand window bed have go more water morning use go talk steal bed washhand stand begin ablution draw moment attention room 
52,"On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished his washing and undressing, and put on his night-gown. He then looked round more nervously than ever. Two or three of the little boys were already in bed, sitting up with their chins on their knees. The light burned clear, the noise went on. It was a trying moment for the poor little lonely boy; however, this time he didn’t ask Tom what he might or might not do, but dropped on his knees by his bedside, as he had done every day from his childhood, to open his heart to Him who heareth the cry and beareth the sorrows of the tender child, and the strong man in agony.",go talk laughter finish washing undressing put night gown look little boy bed sit chin knee light burn clear noise go try moment poor little lonely boy time ask do drop knee bedside do day childhood open heart heareth cry beareth sorrow tender child strong man agony 
53,"Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed unlacing his boots, so that his back was towards Arthur, and he didn’t see what had happened, and looked up in wonder at the sudden silence. Then two or three boys laughed and sneered, and a big, brutal fellow who was standing in the middle of the room picked up a slipper, and shied it at the kneeling boy, calling him a snivelling young shaver. Then Tom saw the whole, and the next moment the boot he had just pulled off flew straight at the head of the bully, who had just time to throw up his arm and catch it on his elbow.",sit bottom bed unlace boot back see happen look wonder sudden silence boy laugh sneer big brutal fellow stand middle room pick slipper shie kneeling boy call snivell young shaver see whole next moment boot pull fly head bully have time throw arm catch elbow 
54,"“Confound you, Brown! what’s that for?” roared he, stamping with pain.",confound roar stamp pain 
55,"“Never mind what I mean,” said Tom, stepping on to the floor, every drop of blood in his body tingling; “if any fellow wants the other boot, he knows how to get it.”",mind mean say step floor drop blood body tingling fellow want other boot know get 
56,"What would have been the result is doubtful, for at this moment the sixth-form boy came in, and not another word could be said. Tom and the rest rushed into bed and finished their unrobing there, and the old verger, as punctual as the clock, had put out the candle in another minute, and toddled on to the next room, shutting their door with his usual “Good-night, gen’lm’n.”",result doubtful moment sixth form boy come word say rest rush bed finish unrobing old verger punctual clock put candle minute toddle next room shut door usual good night gen’lm’n 
57,"There were many boys in the room by whom that little scene was taken to heart before they slept. But sleep seemed to have deserted the pillow of poor Tom. For some time his excitement, and the flood of memories which chased one another through his brain, kept him from thinking or resolving. His head throbbed, his heart leapt, and he could hardly keep himself from springing out of bed and rushing about the room. Then the thought of his own mother came across him, and the promise he had made at her knee, years ago, never to forget to kneel by his bedside, and give himself up to his Father, before he laid his head on the pillow, from which it might never rise; and he lay down gently, and cried as if his heart would break. He was only fourteen years old.",be many boy room little scene take heart sleep sleep seem desert pillow poor time excitement flood memory chase brain keep think resolve head throbb heart leapt keep spring bed rush room thought own mother come promise make knee year forget kneel bedside give father lay head pillow rise lay cry heart break year old 
58,"It was no light act of courage in those days, my dear boys, for a little fellow to say his prayers publicly, even at Rugby. A few years later, when Arnold’s manly piety had begun to leaven the School, the tables turned; before he died, in the School-house at least, and I believe in the other house, the rule was the other way. But poor Tom had come to school in other times. The first few nights after he came he did not kneel down because of the noise, but sat up in bed till the candle was out, and then stole out and said his prayers, in fear lest some one should find him out. So did many another poor little fellow. Then he began to think that he might just as well say his prayers in bed, and then that it didn’t matter whether he was kneeling, or sitting, or lying down. And so it had come to pass with Tom, as with all who will not confess their Lord before men; and for the last year he had probably not said his prayers in earnest a dozen times.",light act courage day dear boy little fellow say prayer few year manly piety begin leave table turn die house least believe other house rule other way poor come school other time first few night come kneel noise sit bed candle steal say prayer fear find do many poor little fellow begin think say prayer bed matter kneel sit lie come pass confess man last year say prayer earnest time 
59,"Poor Tom! the first and bitterest feeling which was like to break his heart was the sense of his own cowardice. The vice of all others which he loathed was brought in and burnt in on his own soul. He had lied to his mother, to his conscience, to his God. How could he bear it? And then the poor little weak boy, whom he had pitied and almost scorned for his weakness, had done that which he, braggart as he was, dared not do. The first dawn of comfort came to him in swearing to himself that he would stand by that boy through thick and thin, and cheer him, and help him, and bear his burdens for the good deed done that night. Then he resolved to write home next day and tell his mother all, and what a coward her son had been. And then peace came to him as he resolved, lastly, to bear his testimony next morning. The morning would be harder than the night to begin with, but he felt that he could not afford to let one chance slip. Several times he faltered, for the devil showed him first all his old friends calling him “Saint” and “Square-toes,” and a dozen hard names, and whispered to him that his motives would be misunderstood, and he would only be left alone with the new boy; whereas it was his duty to keep all means of influence, that he might do good to the largest number. And then came the more subtle temptation, “Shall I not be showing myself braver than others by doing this? Have I any right to begin it now? Ought I not rather to pray in my own study, letting other boys know that I do so, and trying to lead them to it, while in public at least I should go on as I have done?” However, his good angel was too strong that night, and he turned on his side and slept, tired of trying to reason, but resolved to follow the impulse which had been so strong, and in which he had found peace.",poor first bitterest feeling break heart sense own cowardice vice other loath bring burn own soul lie mother conscience bear poor little weak boy pity scorn weakness do braggart do first dawn comfort come swear stand boy thick thin cheer help bear burden good deed do night resolve write next day tell mother coward son peace come resolve bear testimony next morning morning hard night begin feel afford let chance slip several time falter devil show first old friend call toe hard name whisper motive misunderstood leave alone new boy duty keep means influence do good large number come subtle temptation show brave other do right begin pray own study let other boy know do try lead public least go do good angel strong night turn side sleep tired try reason resolve follow impulse strong find peace 
60,"Next morning he was up and washed and dressed, all but his jacket and waistcoat, just as the ten minutes’ bell began to ring, and then in the face of the whole room knelt down to pray. Not five words could he say--the bell mocked him; he was listening for every whisper in the room--what were they all thinking of him? He was ashamed to go on kneeling, ashamed to rise from his knees. At last, as it were from his inmost heart, a still, small voice seemed to breathe forth the words of the publican, “God be merciful to me a sinner!” He repeated them over and over, clinging to them as for his life, and rose from his knees comforted and humbled, and ready to face the whole world. It was not needed: two other boys besides Arthur had already followed his example, and he went down to the great School with a glimmering of another lesson in his heart--the lesson that he who has conquered his own coward spirit has conquered the whole outward world; and that other one which the old prophet learnt in the cave in Mount Horeb, when he hid his face, and the still, small voice asked, “What doest thou here, Elijah?” that however we may fancy ourselves alone on the side of good, the King and Lord of men is nowhere without His witnesses; for in every society, however seemingly corrupt and godless, there are those who have not bowed the knee to Baal.",next morning wash dress jacket waistcoat minute bell begin ring face whole room knolt pray word say bell mock listen whisper room think ashamed go kneeling ashamed rise knee last inmost heart small voice seem breathe word publican merciful sinner repeat cling life rise knee comfort humble ready face whole world need other boy follow example go great glimmering lesson heart lesson conquer own coward spirit conquer whole outward world other one old prophet learn cave hide face small voice ask fancy side good man witness society corrupt godless be bow knee 
61,"He found, too, how greatly he had exaggerated the effect to be produced by his act. For a few nights there was a sneer or a laugh when he knelt down, but this passed off soon, and one by one all the other boys but three or four followed the lead. I fear that this was in some measure owing to the fact that Tom could probably have thrashed any boy in the room except the praepostor; at any rate, every boy knew that he would try upon very slight provocation, and didn’t choose to run the risk of a hard fight because Tom Brown had taken a fancy to say his prayers. Some of the small boys of Number 4 communicated the new state of things to their chums, and in several other rooms the poor little fellows tried it on--in one instance or so, where the praepostor heard of it and interfered very decidedly, with partial success; but in the rest, after a short struggle, the confessors were bullied or laughed down, and the old state of things went on for some time longer. Before either Tom Brown or Arthur left the School-house, there was no room in which it had not become the regular custom. I trust it is so still, and that the old heathen state of things has gone out for ever.",find exaggerate effect produce act few night be sneer laugh knolt pass other boy follow lead fear measure ow fact thrash boy room praepostor rate boy know try slight provocation choose run risk hard fight take fancy say prayer small boy communicate new state thing chum several other room poor little fellow try instance praepostor hear interfer partial success rest short struggle confessor bull laugh old state thing go time leave house be room become regular custom trust old heathen state thing go
