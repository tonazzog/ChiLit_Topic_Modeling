4,"So it is: though it is only poor old Ireland.  Don't you recollect that when we started I told you we were going to Ireland, and through it to the World's End; and here we are now safe at the end of the old world, and beyond us the great Atlantic, and beyond that again, thousands of miles away, the new world, which will be rich and prosperous, civilised and noble, thousands of years hence, when this old world, it may be, will be dead, and little children there will be reading in their history books of Ancient England and of Ancient France, as you now read of Greece and Rome.",poor old recollect start tell go safe end old world great thousand mile new world rich prosperous civilised noble thousand year old world dead little child read history book ancient ancient read

There are plenty of cows on that mountain: and yet they look so small, you could not see them, nor I either, without a glass.  That long white streak, zigzagging down the mountain side, is a roaring cataract of foam five hundred feet high, full now with last night's rain; but by this afternoon it will have dwindled to a little thread; and to- morrow, when you get up, if no more rain has come down, it will be gone.

Look away to the right, and you see it through the opening of the woods again and again: and now look above the woods.  You see a faint blue line, and gray and purple lumps like clouds, which rest upon it far away.  That, child, is the great Atlantic Ocean, and those are islands in the far west.  The water which washes the bottom of the lawn was but a few months ago pouring out of the Gulf of Mexico, between the Bahamas and Florida, and swept away here as the great ocean river of warm water which we call the Gulf Stream, bringing with it out of the open ocean the shoals of mackerel, and the porpoises and whales which feed upon them. Some fine afternoon we will run down the bay and catch strange fishes, such as you never saw before, and very likely see a living whale.",lake be plenty salt water fresh look right see opening wood look wood see faint blue line gray purple lump cloud rest child great atlantic island far west water wash bottom lawn few month pour sweep great ocean river warm water call bring open ocean shoal mackerel porpoise whale feed fine afternoon run bay catch strange fish such see see living whale

See how the scratches all point straight down the valley, and straight out to sea.  Those mountains are 2000 feet high: but they were much higher once; for the ice has planed the tops off them.  Then, it seems to me, the ice sank, and left the mountains standing out of it about half their height, and at that level it stayed, till it had planed down all those lower moors of smooth bare rock between us and the Western ocean; and then it sank again, and dwindled back, leaving moraines (that is, heaps of dirt and stones) all up these valleys here and there, till at the last it melted all away, and poor old Ireland became fit to live in again.  We will go down the bay some day and look at those moraines, some of them quite hills of earth, and then you will see for yourself how mighty a chisel the ice-chisel was, and what vast heaps of chips it has left behind.

Before we can eat the beef, it has cost perhaps tenpence to make that pound of beef out of turnips and grass and oil-cake; and so the country is only twopence a pound richer for it.  But Mr. Salmon has made himself out of what he eats in the sea, and so has cost nothing; and the shilling a pound is all clear gain.  There--you don't quite understand that piece of political economy.  Indeed, it is only in the last two or three years that older heads than yours have got to understand it, and have passed the wise new salmon laws, by which the rivers will be once more as rich with food as the land is, just as they were hundreds of years ago.

But ever since then, Madam How has been scooping them out again by her water-chisel into deep glens, mighty cliffs, sharp peaks, such as you see aloft, and making the old hills beautiful once more.  Why, even the Alps in Switzerland have been carved out by frost and rain, out of some great flat.  The very peak of the Matterhorn, of which you have so often seen a picture, is but one single point left of some enormous bun of rock.  All the rest has been carved away by rain and frost; and some day the Matterhorn itself will be carved away, and its last stone topple into the glacier at its foot.

So St. Patrick's cabbage got into this south-west of Ireland, long, long ago; and was such a brave sturdy little plant, that it clambered up to the top of the highest mountains, and over all the rocks.  But when it got to the rich lowlands to the eastward, in county Cork, it found all the ground taken up already with other plants; and as they had enough to do to live themselves, they would not let St. Patrick's cabbage settle among them; and it had to be content with living here in the far-west--and, what was very sad, had no means of sending word to its brothers and sisters in the Pyrenees how it was getting on.",know know make new sort plant animal start single place leave take care earn own living do one spread place go cabbage get south long brave sturdy little plant clamber top high mountain rock get rich lowland eastward find ground take other plant have enough do live let cabbage settle have content live west sad have means send word brother sister get

Then comes the water-bailiff, and catches the poachers. Then comes the policeman, with his sword at his side and his truncheon under his arm: and then comes a ""cheap journey"" to Tralee Gaol, in which those foolish poachers sit and reconsider themselves, and determine not to break the salmon laws--at least till next time.",salmon spawn little brook water low take spurge grind stone water let milk run pool poor salmon turn dead come water bailiff catch poacher come policeman sword side truncheon arm come cheap journey foolish poacher sit reconsider determine break salmon law least next time

For instance, on an island away there to the west, and only in one spot, there grows a little sort of lily, which is found I believe in Brittany, and on the Spanish and Portuguese heaths, and even in North-west Africa.

About Biarritz, on the Spanish frontier, all the moors are covered with Cornish heath, and the bogs with Orange-bell, and lovely they are to see; and growing among them is a tall heath six feet high, which they call there _bruyere_, or Broomheath, because they make brooms of it: and out of its roots the ""briar-root"" pipes are made.  There are other heaths about that country, too, whose names I do not know; so that when you are there, you fancy yourself in the very home of the heaths: but you are not.  They must have come from some land near where the Azores are now; or how could heaths have got past Africa, and the tropics, to the Cape of Good Hope?",course go find heath other sort rare common spanish frontier moor cover cornish heath bog orange bell lovely see grow tall heath foot high call make broom root briar root pipe make be other heath country name know fancy very home heath come land heath get tropic good

But this is certain, that there must have been a time when figs, and bamboos, and palms, and sarsaparillas, and many other sorts of plants could get from Africa to America, or the other way, and indeed almost round the world.  About the south of France and Italy you will see one beautiful sarsaparilla, with hooked prickles, zigzagging and twining about over rocks and ruins, trunks and stems: and when you do, if you have understanding, it will seem as strange to you as it did to me to remember that the home of the sarsaparillas is not in Europe, but in the forests of Brazil, and the River Plate.",tell think certain be time fig bamboo palm sarsaparillas many other sort plant get other way world south see beautiful sarsaparilla hook prickle zigzagging twin rock ruin trunk stem do have understanding seem strange do remember home sarsaparillas forest

No, those jaguars and pumus have been in America for ages: and there are those who will tell you--and I think they have some reason on their side--that the jaguar, with his round patches of spots, was once very much the same as the African and Indian leopard, who can climb trees well.  So when he got into the tropic forests of America, he took to the trees, and lived among the branches, feeding on sloths and monkeys, and never coming to the ground for weeks, till he grew fatter and stronger and far more terrible than his forefathers.  And they will tell you, too, that the puma was, perhaps--I only say perhaps--something like the lion, who (you know) has no spots.  But when he got into the forests, he found very little food under the trees, only a very few deer; and so he was starved, and dwindled down to the poor little sheep-stealing rogue he is now, of whom nobody is afraid.",strong cleverer savage jaguar pumus age be tell think have reason side jaguar round patch spot same african indian leopard climb tree get tropic forest take tree live branch feed sloth monkey come ground week grow fatter strong terrible forefather tell puma say lion know have spot get forest find little food tree few deer starve dwindle poor little sheep steal rogue afraid
