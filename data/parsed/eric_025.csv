3,"Time, the great good angel, Time, the merciful healer, assuaged the violence of Eric's grief, which seemed likely to settle down into a sober sadness. At first his letters to his parents and to Fairholm were almost unintelligible in their fierce abandonment of sorrow; but they grew calmer in time,--and while none of his school-fellows ever ventured in his presence to allude to Vernon, because of the emotion which the slightest mention of him excited, yet he rarely wrote any letters to his relations in which he did not refer to his brother's death, in language which grew at length both manly and resigned.",time great good angel merciful healer assuage violence grief seem likely settle sober sadness first letter parent unintelligible fierce abandonment sorrow grow calmer time school fellow venture presence allude emotion slight mention excite write letter relation refer brother death language grow length manly resign 
4,"A month after, in the summer term, he was sitting alone in his study in the afternoon (for he could not summon up spirit enough to play regularly at cricket), writing a long letter to his aunt. He spoke freely and unreservedly of his past errors,--more freely than he had ever done before,--and expressed not only deep penitence, but even strong hatred of his previous unworthy courses. ""I can hardly even yet realize,"" he added, ""that I am alone here, and that I am writing to my aunt Trevor about the death of my brother, my noble, only brother, Vernon. Oh how my whole soul yearns towards him. I _must_ be a better boy, I _will_ be better than I have been, in the hopes of meeting him again. Indeed, indeed, dear aunt, though I have been so guilty, I am laying aside, with all my might, idleness and all bad habits, and doing my very best to redeem the lost years. I do hope that the rest of my time at Roslyn will be more worthily spent than any of it has been as yet.""",month summer term sit study afternoon summon spirit play cricket write long letter aunt speak past error do express deep penitence strong hatred previous unworthy course realize add alone write aunt death brother noble only brother whole soul yearn good boy good hope meet dear aunt guilty lay might idleness bad habit do good redeem lose year hope rest time spend 
5,"He finished the sentence, and laid his pen down to think, gazing quietly on the blue hills and sunlit sea. A feeling of hope and repose stole over him;--when suddenly he saw at the door, which was ajar, the leering eyes and villainously cunning countenance of Billy.",finish sentence lay pen think gaze blue hill sunlit sea feeling hope repose steal see door ajar leer eye cunn countenance 
6,"""What do you want?"" he said angrily, casting at the intruder a look of intense disgust.",want say cast intruder look intense disgust 
7,"""Beg pardon, sir,"" said the man, pulling his hair. ""Anything in my line, sir, to-day?""",beg pardon sir say man pull hair line sir day 
8,"""No!"" answered Eric, rising up in a gust of indignation. ""What business have you here? Get away instantly.""",answer rise gust indignation business get 
9,"""Not had much custom from you lately, sir,"" said the man.",have much custom sir say man 
10,"""What do you mean by having the insolence to begin talking to me? If you don't make yourself scarce at once, I'll--""",mean have insolence begin talk make scarce 
11,"""O well,"" said the man; ""if it comes to that, I've business enough. Perhaps you'll just pay me this debt,"" he continued, changing his fawning manner into a bullying swagger. ""I've waited long enough.""",say man come business pay debt continue change fawn manner bullying swagger wait 
12,"Eric, greatly discomfited, took the dirty bit of paper. It purported to be a bill for various items of drink, all of which Eric _knew_ to have been paid for, and among other things, a charge of Â£6 for the dinner at the ""Jolly Herring.""",discomfite take dirty bit paper purport bill various item drink pay other thing charge dinner jolly 
13,"""Why, you villain, these have all been paid. What! six pounds for the dinner! Why Brigson collected the subscriptions to pay for it before it took place.""",villain pay pound dinner collect subscription pay take place 
14,"""That's now't to me, sir. He never paid me; and as you was the young gen'lman in the cheer, I comes to you.""",w't sir pay young gen'lman cheer come 
15,"_Now_ Eric knew for the first time what Brigson had meant by his threatened revenge. He saw at once that the man had been put up to act in this way by some one, and had little doubt that Brigson was the instigator. Perhaps it might be even true, as the man said, that he had never received the money. Brigson was quite wicked enough to have embezzled it for his own purposes.",know first time mean threaten revenge see man put act way one have little doubt instigator true man say receive money wicked embezzle own purpose 
16,"""Go,"" he said to the man; ""you shall have the money in a week.""",go say man have money week 
17,"""And mind it bean't more nor a week. I don't chuse to wait for my money no more,"" said Billy, impudently, as he retired with an undisguised chuckle, which very nearly made Eric kick him down stairs.",mind more week chuse wait money say retire undisguised chuckle make kick stair 
18,"What was to be done? To mention the subject to Owen or Montagu, who were best capable of advising him, would have been to renew the memory of unpleasant incidents, which he was most anxious to obliterate from the memory of all. He had not the moral courage to face the natural consequences of his past misconduct, and was now ashamed to speak of what he had not then been ashamed to do. He told Graham and Wildney, who were the best of his old associates, and they at once agreed that _they_ ought to be responsible for at least a share of the debt. Still, between them they could only muster three pounds out of the six which were required, and the week had half elapsed before there seemed any prospect of extrication from the difficulty; so Eric daily grew more miserable and dejected.",do mention subject capable advise renew memory unpleasant incident anxious obliterate memory have moral courage face natural consequence past misconduct ashamed speak ashamed do tell good old associate agree responsible least share debt muster pound require week half elapse seem prospect extrication difficulty grow miserable dejected 
19,"A happy thought struck him. He would go and explain the source of his trouble to Mr. Rose, his oldest, his kindest, his wisest friend. To him he could speak without scruple and without reserve, and from him he knew that he would receive nothing but the noblest advice and the warmest sympathy.",happy thought strike go explain source trouble old kindest wisest friend speak scruple reserve know receive noblest advice warmest sympathy 
20,"He went to him after prayers that night, and told his story.",go prayer night tell story 
21,"""Ah, Eric, Eric!"" said Mr. Rose; ""you see, my boy, that sin and punishment are twins.""",say see boy sin punishment twin 
22,"""O but, sir, I was just striving so hard to amend, and it seems cruel that I should receive at once so sad a check.""",sir striving hard amend seem cruel receive sad check 
23,"""There is only one way that I see, Eric. You must write home for the money, and confess the truth to them honestly, as you have to me.""",be way see write home money confess truth have 
24,"It was a hard course for Eric's proud and loving heart to write and tell his aunt the full extent of his guilt. But he did it faithfully, extenuating nothing, and entreating her, as she loved him, to send the money by return of post.",hard course proud loving heart write tell aunt full extent guilt do extenuate entreat love send money return post 
25,"It came, and with it a letter full of deep and gentle affection. Mrs. Trevor knew her nephew's character, and did not add by reproaches to the bitterness which she perceived he had endured; she simply sent him the money, and told him, that in spite of his many failures, ""she still had perfect confidence in the true heart of her dear boy.""",come letter full deep gentle affection know nephew character add reproache bitterness perceive endure send money tell spite many failure have perfect confidence true heart dear boy 
26,"Touched by the affection which all seemed to be showing him, it became more and more the passionate craving of Eric's soul to be worthy of that love. But it is far, far harder to recover a lost path than to keep in the right one all along; and by one more terrible fall, the poor erring boy was to be taught for the last time the fearful strength of temptation, and the only source in earth and heaven from which deliverance can come. Theoretically he knew it, but as yet not practically. Great as his trials had been, and deeply as he had suffered, it was God's will that he should pass through a yet fiercer flame ere he could be purified from pride and passion and self-confidence, and led to the cross of a suffering Saviour, there to fling himself down in heart-rending humility, and cast his great load of cares and sins upon Him who cared for him through all his wanderings, and was leading him back through thorny places to the green pastures and still waters, where at last he might have rest.",touch affection seem show become passionate craving soul worthy love hard recover lose path keep right one terrible fall poor erring boy teach last time fearful strength temptation only source earth heaven deliverance come know great trial suffer will pass fiercer flame purify pride passion self confidence lead cross suffering fling heart rend humility cast great load care sin care wandering lead thorny place green pasture water last have rest 
27,"The money came, and walking off straight to the Jolly Herring, he dashed it down on the table before Billy, and imperiously bade him write a receipt. The man did so, but with so unmistakable an air of cunning and triumph that Eric was both astonished and dismayed. Could the miscreant have any further plot against him? At first he fancied that Billy might attempt to extort money by a threat of telling Dr. Rowlands; but this supposition he banished as unlikely since it might expose Billy himself to very unpleasant consequences. Eric snatched the receipt, and said contemptuously, ""Never come near me again; next time you come up to the studies I'll tell Carter to turn you out.""",money come walk dash table bid write receipt man unmistakable air cunning triumph astonished dismay miscreant have further plot fancy attempt extort money threat tell supposition banish unlikely expose unpleasant consequence snatch receipt say come next time come study tell turn 
28,"""Ho, ho, ho!"" sneered Billy. ""How mighty we young gents are all of a sudden. Unless you buy of me sometimes, you shall hear of me again; never fear, young gen'lman."" He shouted out the latter words, for Eric had turned scornfully on his heel, and was already in the street. Obviously more danger was to be apprehended from this quarter. At first the thought of it was disquieting, but three weeks glided away, and Eric, now absorbed heart and soul in school work, began to remember it as a mere vague and idle threat. But one afternoon, to his horror, he again heard Billy's step on the stairs, and again saw the hateful iniquitous face at the door.",sneer mighty young gent sudden buy hear fear young gen'lman shout latter word turn heel street more danger apprehend quarter first thought disquieting week glide absorb heart soul school work begin remember mere vague idle threat afternoon horror hear step stair see hateful iniquitous face door 
29,"""Not much custom from you lately, sir,"" said Billy, mockingly. ""Anything in my line to-day.""",much custom sir say line day 
30,"""Didn't I tell you never to come near me again, you foul villain? Go this instant, or I'll call Carter;"" and, opening the window, he prepared to put his threat into execution.",tell come foul villain go instant call open window prepare put threat execution 
31,"""Ho, ho, ho! Better look at summat I've got first."" It was a printed notice to the following effect--",good look summat get first print notice follow effect

33,"""WHEREAS some evil-disposed persons stole some pigeons on the evening of April 6th from the Rev. H. Gordon's premises; the above reward will be given for any such information as may lead to the apprehension of the offenders.""",evil dispose person steal pigeon evening 6th premise above reward give such information lead apprehension offender 
34,"Soon after the seizure of the pigeons there had been a rumor that Gordon had offered a reward of this kind, but the matter had been forgotten, and the boys had long fancied their secret secure, though at first they had been terribly alarmed.",seizure pigeon be rumor offer reward kind matter forget boy fancy secret secure first alarm 
35,"""What do you show me that for?"" he asked, reddening and then growing pale again.",show ask redden grow pale 
36,"Billy's only answer was to pass his finger slowly along the words ""Five pounds reward!""",only answer pass finger word pound reward 
37,"""Well?""",
38,"""I thinks I knows who took them pigeons.""",think know take pigeon 
39,"""What's that to me?""",
40,"""Ho, ho, ho! that's a good un,"" was Billy's reply; and he continued to cackle as though enjoying a great joke.",good un reply continue cackle enjoy great joke 
41,"""Unless you gives me five pound, anyhow, I knows where to get 'em. I know who them evil-disposed persons be! So I'll give ye another week to decide.""",give pound know get know evil dispose person give week decide 
42,"Billy shambled off in high spirits; but Eric sank back into his chair. Five pounds! The idea haunted him. How could he ever get them? To write home again was out of the question. The Trevors, though liberal, were not rich, and after just sending him so large a sum, it was impossible, he thought, that they should send him five pounds more at his mere request. Besides, how could he be sure that Billy would not play upon his fears to extort further sums? And to explain the matter to them fully was more than he could endure. He remembered now how easily his want of caution might have put Billy in possession of the secret, and he knew enough of the fellow's character to feel quite sure of the use he would be inclined to make of it. Oh how he cursed that hour of folly!",shamble high spirit sink chair pound idea haunt get write home question liberal rich send large sum impossible think send pound more mere request sure play fear extort further sum explain matter more endure remember want caution put possession secret know enough fellow character feel sure use inclined make curse hour folly 
43,"Five pounds! He began to think of what money he could procure. He thought again and again, but it was no use; only one thing was clear--he _had_, not the money, and could not get it. Miserable boy! It was too late then! for him repentance was to be made impossible; every time he attempted it he was to be thwarted by some fresh discovery. And, leaning his head on his open palms, poor Eric sobbed like a child.",pound begin think money procure think use thing clear money get miserable boy late repentance make impossible time attempt thwart fresh discovery lean head open palm poor sobb child 
44,"Five pounds! And all this misery was to come upon him for the want of five pounds! Expulsion was _certain_, was _inevitable_ now, and perhaps for Wildney too as well as for himself. After all his fine promises in his letters home,--yes, that reminded him of Vernon. The grave had not closed for a month over one brother, and the other would be _expelled_. Oh misery, misery! He was sure it would break his mother's heart. Oh how cruel everything was to him!",pound misery come want pound expulsion _certain_ fine promise letter remind grave close month brother other _expelled_ misery misery sure break mother heart cruel 
45,"Five pounds--he wondered whether Montagu would lend it him, or any other boy? But then it was late in the quarter, and all the boys would have spent the money they brought with them from home. There was no chance of any one having five pounds, and to a master he _dare_ not apply, not even to Mr. Rose. The offence was too serious to be overlooked, and if noticed at all, he fancied that, after his other delinquencies, it _must_, as a matter of notoriety, be visited with expulsion. He could not face that bitter thought; he could not thus bring open disgrace upon his father's and his brother's name; this was the fear which kept recurring to him with dreadful iteration.",pound wonder lend other boy late quarter boy spend money bring home be chance one have pound master apply offence serious overlook notice fancy other delinquency matter notoriety visit expulsion face bitter thought bring open disgrace father brother name fear keep recur dreadful iteration 
46,"By the bye, he remembered that if he had continued captain of the school eleven, he would have had easy command of the money by being treasurer of the cricket subscriptions. But at Vernon's death he lost all interest in cricket for a time, and had thrown up his office, to which Montagu had been elected by the general suffrage.",bye remember continue captain school have easy command money treasurer cricket subscription death lose interest cricket time throw office elect general suffrage 
47,"He wondered whether there was as much as five pounds of the cricketing-money left? He knew that the box which contained it was in Montagu's study, and he also knew where the key was kept. It was merely a feeling of curiosity--he would go and look.",wonder be much pound cricketing money leave know box contain study know key keep feeling curiosity go look 
48,"All this passed through Eric's mind as he sat in his study after Billy had gone. It was a sultry summer day; all the study-doors were open, and all their occupants were absent in the cricket-field, or bathing. He stole into Montagu's study, hastily got the key, and took down the box.",pass mind sit study go sultry summer day study door open occupant absent cricket field bathing steal study get key take box 
49,"""O put it down, put it down, Eric,"" said Conscience; ""what business have you with it?""",put put say conscience business have 
50,"""Pooh! it is merely curiosity; as if I couldn't trust myself!""",curiosity trust 
51,"""Put it down,"" repeated Conscience authoritatively, deigning no longer to argue or entreat.",put repeat conscience deign argue entreat 
52,"Eric hesitated, and did put down the box; but he did not instantly leave the room. He began to look at Montagu's books, and then out of the window. The gravel play-ground was deserted, he noticed, for the cricket-field. Nobody was near, therefore. Well, what of that? he was doing no harm.",hesitate put box leave room begin look book window gravel play ground desert notice cricket field do harm 
53,"""Nonsense! I _will_ just look and see if there's five pounds in the cricket-box."" Slowly at first he put out his hand, and then, hastily turning the key, opened the box. It contained three pounds in gold, and a quantity of silver. He began to count the silver, putting it on the table, and found that it made up three pounds ten more. ""So that, altogether, there's six pounds ten; that's thirty shillings more than ...and it won't be wanted till next summer term, because all the bats and balls are bought now. I daresay Montagu won't even open the box again. I know he keeps it stowed away in a corner, and hardly ever looks at it, and I can put back the five pounds the very first day of next term, and it will save me from expulsion.""",nonsense look see be pound cricket box put hand turn key open box contain pound gold quantity silver begin count silver put table find make pound more be pound shilling more want next summer term bat ball buy open box know keep stow corner look put pound very first day next term save expulsion 
54,"Very slowly Eric took the three sovereigns and put them in his pocket, and then he took up one of the heaps of shillings and sixpences which he had counted, and dropped them also into his trousers; they fell into the pocket with a great jingle....",take sovereign put pocket take heap shilling sixpence count drop trousers fall pocket great jingle 
55,"""Eric, you are a thief!"" He thought he heard his brother Vernon's voice utter the words thrillingly distinct; but it was conscience who had borrowed the voice, and, sick with horror, he began to shake the money out of his pockets again into the box. He was only just in time; he had barely locked the box, and put it in its place, when he heard the sound of voices and footsteps on the stairs. He had no time to take out the key and put it back where he found it, and had hardly time to slip into his own study again, when the boys had reached the landing.",thief think hear brother voice utter word distinct conscience borrow voice sick horror begin shake money pocket box time lock box put place hear sound voice footstep stair have time take key put find have time slip own study boy reach landing 
56,"They were Duncan and Montagu, and as they passed the door, Eric pretended to be plunged in books.",pass door pretend plunge book 
57,"""Hallo, Eric! grinding as usual,"" said Duncan, good-humoredly; but he only got a sickly smile in reply.",grind usual say good get sickly smile reply 
58,"""What! are you the only fellow in the studies?"" asked Montagu. ""I was nearly sure I heard some one moving about as we came up stairs.""",only fellow study ask sure hear one move come stair 
59,"""I don't think there's any one here but me,"" said Eric, ""and I'm going a walk now.""",think be one say go walk 
60,"He closed his books with, a bang, flew down stairs, and away through the play-ground towards the shore But he could not so escape his thoughts. ""Eric, you are a thief! Eric, you are a thief!"" rang in his ear. ""Yes,"" he thought; ""I am even a thief. Oh, good God, yes, _even_ a _thief_, for I _had_ actually stolen the money, until I changed my mind. What if they should discover the key in the box, knowing that I was the only fellow up stairs? Oh, mercy, mercy, mercy!""",close book bang fly stair play ground shore escape thought thief thief ring ear think thief good steal money change mind discover key box know only fellow stair mercy mercy mercy 
61,"It was a lonely place, and he flung himself, with his face hid in the coarse grass, trying to cool the wild burning of his brow. And as he lay, he thrust his hand into the guilty pocket. Good heavens! there was something still there. He pulled it out; it was a sovereign! Then he WAS a thief, even actually. Oh, everything was against him; and, starting to his feet, he flung the accursed gold over the rocks far into the sea.",lonely place flung face hide coarse grass try cool wild burning brow lay thrust hand guilty pocket good heaven be pull sovereign thief start foot flung accurse gold rock sea 
62,"When he got home he felt so inconceivably wretched that, unable to work, he begged leave to go to bed at once. It was long before he fell asleep; but when he did, the sleep was more terrible than the haunted wakefulness. For he had no rest from tormenting and horrid dreams. Brigson and Billy, their bodies grown to gigantic proportions, and their faces fierce with demoniacal wickedness, seemed to be standing over him, and demanding five pounds on pain of death. Flights of pigeons darkening the air, settled on him, and flapped about him. He fled from them madly through the dark midnight, but many steps pursued him. He saw Mr. Rose, and running up, seized him by the hand, and implored protection. But in his dream Mr. Rose turned from him with a cold look of sorrowful reproach. And then he saw Wildney, and cried out to him, ""O Charlie, save me;"" but Charlie ran away, saying, ""Williams, you are a thief!"" and then a chorus of voices took up that awful cry, voices of expostulation, voices of contempt, voices of indignation, voices of menace; they took up the cry, and repeated and re-echoed it; but, most unendurable of all, there were voices of wailing and voices of gentleness among them, and his soul died within him as he caught, amid the confusion of condemning sounds, the voices of Russell and Vernon, and they, too, were saying to him, in tender pity and agonized astonishment, ""Eric, Eric, you are a thief!""",get feel wretched unable work begg leave go bed long fall asleep sleep terrible haunt wakefulness have rest torment horrid dream body grow gigantic proportion face fierce demoniacal wickedness seem stand demand pound pain death flight pigeon darken air settle flapp flead dark midnight many step pursue see run seize hand implore protection dream turn cold look sorrowful reproach see cry save run say thief chorus voice take awful cry voice expostulation voice contempt voice indignation voice menace take cry repeat re-echoe unendurable be voice wail voice gentleness soul die catch confusion condemn sound voice say tender pity agonize astonishment thief
