If Ventimore replied--as he might with truth--that he had no intention whatever of maintaining his wife in luxury such as that, he stood convicted of selfish indulgence as a bachelor; if, on the other hand, he declared that he _did_ propose to maintain his wife in the same fantastic and exaggerated splendour as the present, it would certainly confirm her father's disbelief in his prudence and economy.",awkward question reader perceive reply truth have intention maintain wife luxury such stand convict selfish indulgence bachelor other hand declare propose maintain wife same fantastic exaggerate splendour present confirm father disbelief prudence economy
