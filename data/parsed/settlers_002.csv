2,"When Mrs Linacre was told in the evening of the arrival of the disagreeable neighbours who were in the marsh, she was sorry; but when she had gone round the premises with her husband at night, and found all safe, and no tokens of any intrusion, she was disposed to hope that the Redfurns would, this time, keep to their fishing and fowling, and make no disturbance.  Oliver and Mildred crept down to the garden hedge at sunrise, and peeped through it, so as to see all that was doing in the carr, as the marsh was called.  [In that part of the country, a carr means a morass.] After watching some time, they saw Stephen and Roger creep out from under the low brown tent.  As the almost level sun shone full in their faces, they rubbed their eyes; then they stretched and yawned, and seemed to be trying hard to wake themselves thoroughly.",tell evening arrival disagreeable neighbour marsh sorry go premise husband night find safe token intrusion dispose hope time keep fishing fowling make disturbance creep garden hedge sunrise peep see do carr marsh call part country carr mean morass watch time see creep low brown tent level sun shine full face rub eye stretch yawn seem try hard wake 
3,"""They have been sound asleep, however,"" observed Oliver to his sister; ""and it is still so early, that I do not believe they have been abroad about mischief in the night.  They would not have been awake yet if they had.""",sound asleep observe sister early believe mischief night awake have 
4,"""Look!  There is a woman!"" exclaimed Mildred.  ""Is that Nan?""",look be woman exclaim nan 
5,"""Yes; that is Nan Redfurn,--Stephen's wife.  That is their great net that she has over her arm.  They are going to draw the oval pond, I think.  We can watch their sport nicely here.  They cannot see an inch of us.""",wife great net have arm go draw oval pond think watch sport see inch 
6,"""But we do not like that they should watch us,"" said Mildred, drawing back.  ""We should not like to know that they were peeping at us from behind a hedge.""",like watch say draw like know peep hedge 
7,"""We should not mind it if we were not afraid of them,"" replied Oliver. ""It is because they plot mischief that we cannot bear their prying.  We are not going to do them any mischief, you know; and they cannot mean to make any secret of what they are doing in the middle of the carr, with high ground all about it.""  Satisfied by this, Mildred crouched down, with her arm about her brother's neck, and saw the great net cast, and the pond almost emptied of its fish,--some few being kept for food, and the small fry--especially of the stickleback--being thrown into heaps, to be sold for manure.",mind afraid reply plot mischief bear prying go do mischief know mean make secret do middle carr high ground satisfied crouch arm brother neck see great net cast pond empty fish few keep food small fry stickleback throw heap sell manure

9,"""I think they will sweep the shallow waters, there to the left, for more stickleback,"" replied Oliver.  ""They will make up a load, to sell before the heat of the day, before they set about anything else.""",think sweep shallow water left more stickleback reply make load sell heat day set else 
10,"Oliver was right.  All the three repaired to the shallow water, and stood among the reeds, so as to be half hidden.  The children could see, however, that when little George came down the garden, shouting to them to come to breakfast, the strangers took heed to the child.  They turned their heads for a moment towards the garden, and then spoke together and laughed.",right repair shallow water stand reed half hide child see little come garden shouting come breakfast stranger take heed child turn head moment garden speak laugh 
11,"""There, now!"" cried Oliver, vexed: ""that is all because we forgot to go to breakfast.  So much for my not having a watch!  Mother need not have sent George to make such a noise; but, if I had had a watch, he would not have come at all; and these people would not have been put in mind of us.""",cry vex forget go breakfast much have watch mother send make noise have watch come person put mind 
12,"""You will soon be able to have a watch now, like the boys in Holland,"" said Mildred.  ""Your alabaster things will change away for a watch; will not they?  But we might not have remembered breakfast, if you had had a watch.""",able have watch boy say alabaster thing change watch remember breakfast have watch 
13,"""We are forgetting it now,"" said Oliver, catching up George and running to the house, followed by Mildred, who could not help feeling as if Roger was at her heels.",forget say catching run house follow help feel heel 
14,"They were surprised to find how late it was.  Their father was already gone with Pastor Dendel's load of manure.  Their mother only waited to kiss them before she went, and to tell them the their father meant to be back as soon as he could; and that meantime, neighbour Gool had promised to keep an eye on the mill.  If anything happened to frighten them, Oliver or Ailwin had only to set the mill-sails agoing, and neighbour Gool and his men would be with them presently.  She did not think, however, that anything would happen in the little time that their father would be away.",surprise find late father go load manure mother wait kiss go tell father mean meantime neighbour promise keep eye mill happen frighten have set mill sail ago neighbour man think happen little time father 
15,"""I will tell you what we will do!"" cried Oliver, starting from his chair, after he had been eating his bread and milk, in silence, for some time after his mother's departure.  ""Let us dress up a figure to look like father, and set him at the mill-window; so that those Redfurns shall not find out that he is away.  Won't that be good?""",tell do cry start chair eat bread milk silence time mother departure let dress figure look father set mill window find good 
16,"""Put him on the mill-steps.  They may not look up at the window.""",put mill step look window 
17,"""The mill-steps, then.  Where is father's old hat?  Put it on the broom there, and see how it looks.  Run up to the mill, dear, and bring his jacket--and his apron,"" he shouted as his sister ran.",mill step father old hat put broom see look run mill dear bring jacket apron shout sister run 
18,"Mildred brought both, and they dressed up the broom.",bring dress broom 
19,"""That will never do,"" said Mildred.  ""Look how the sleeves hang; and how he holds his head!  It is not a bit like a man.""",do say look sleeve hang hold head bit man 
20,"""'Tis a good scarecrow,"" declared Ailwin.  ""I have seen many a worse scarecrow than that.""",tis good scarecrow declare see many bad scarecrow 
21,"""But this is to scare the Redfurns, and they are far wiser than crows,"" said Mildred.  ""Look how George pulls at the apron, and tugs at the broomstick behind!  It does not scare even him.""",scare wise crow say look pull apron tug broomstick scare 
22,"""It will look very different on the steps--in the open air,"" Oliver declared.  ""A bunch or two of straw in the sleeves, and under the jacket, will make it seem all alive.""",look different step open air declare bunch straw sleeve jacket make seem alive 
23,"And he carried it out, and tied it upon the mill-steps.  It was no easy matter to fasten it so as to make it look at all like a man naturally mounting stairs.  The more difficult it was, however, the more they all became interested in the business.  Mildred brought straw, and Ailwin tied a knot here, and another knot there, while Oliver cocked the hat in various directions upon the head, till they all forgot what they were dressing up the figure for.  The reason popped into Ailwin's head again, when she had succeeded in raising the right arm to the rail, in a very life-like manner.",carry tie mill step easy matter fast make look man mount stair difficult more become interested business bring straw tie knot knot cocked hat various direction head forget dress figure reason pop head succeed raise right arm rail life like manner 
24,"""There!"" said she, stepping backwards to view her work, ""that makes a very good master for me.  I will obey him in everything he bids me till master comes home.""",say step view work make good master obey bid master come 
25,"At the same moment, she walked backwards against something, and little George clung screaming to Mildred's knees.  Roger had spread his arms for Ailwin to walk back into; and Stephen was behind, leaning against the cow-shed.  They had been watching all that the party had been doing, and, having overheard every word, had found out the reason.",same moment walk little cling scream knee spread arm walk lean cow -shed watch party do overhear word find reason 
26,"The children saw at once how very foolish they had been; and the thought confused them so much, that they did not know what to do next.  Poor Ailwin, who could never learn wisdom, more or less, now made matters worse by all she said and did.  Stout and strong as she was, she could do nothing, for Roger had taken the hint she had given by walking backwards, with her arms crossed behind her: he had pinioned her.  She cried out to Oliver to run up, and set the mill-sails agoing, to bring neighbour Gool.  Stephen took this second hint.  He quietly swung Oliver off the steps, sent down his scarecrow after him, and himself took his seat on the threshold of the mill.  There he sat, laughing to see how Ailwin wearied herself with struggles, while Roger, by merely hanging on her arms, prevented her getting free.  When, however, Oliver flew at the boy, and struck him some fierce blows, Stephen came down, drove the little girl and the baby into the house, and locked them in, and then went to help Roger with his strong arm.",child see foolish thought confuse know do poor learn wisdom more make matter bad say stout strong do take hint give walk arm cross pinion cry run set mill sail agoing bring neighbour take second hint swing step send scarecrow take seat threshold mill sit laugh see weary struggle hang arm prevent get free fly boy strike fierce blow come drive little girl baby house lock go help strong arm 
27,"It was clear to Mildred what she ought to do.  Crying as she was, she put George in a corner, with some playthings, to keep him from the fire till she came to him again, and then mounted the stairs, as quickly as her trembling limbs would let her,--first to her mother's room, and then out upon the roof.  She tied a large red handkerchief of her mother's upon her father's Sunday walking-stick, and then waved it, as high as she could hold it, above her head, while she considered how she could fasten it; for it would never do to leave George alone below for many minutes.  Perhaps neighbour Gool had seen it already, and would soon be here with his men.  But, lest he should not, she must fix her flag, and trust to Stephen and Roger not thinking of looking up to the roof from the yard below.  At last, after many attempts, she thrust the stick into a crevice of the roof, and fixed it with heavy things round it,--having run down three or four times, to see that George was safe.",clear do cry put corner plaything keep fire come mount stair tremble limb let first mother room roof tie large red handkerchief mother father walking stick wave high hold head consider fast do leave many minute neighbour see man fix flag trust think look roof yard last many attempt thrust stick crevice roof fix heavy thing run time see safe 
28,"There was, indeed, no time to be lost, for the intruders below were doing all the mischief they could think of, short of robbing and burning the premises.  The great tall man, Stephen, strolling about the lower rooms, found Mrs Linacre's knitting, and pulled out the needles, and unravelled the work.  Roger spied a heap of bulbs on the corner of a high shelf.  They were Mr Linacre's rare and valuable tulip-roots, brought from Holland.  Roger cut one of them open, to see what it looked like, and then threw the whole lot into the boiler, now steaming over the fire, saying the family should have a dish the more at dinner to-day.  They got hold of Oliver's tools, and the cup he was at work upon.  Stephen raised his arm, about to dash the cup to the ground, when Oliver sprang forward, and said--",be time lose intruder do mischief think short robb burn premise great tall man stroll low room find knitting pull needle unravell work spy heap bulb corner high shelf rare valuable tulip root bring cut open see look throw whole lot boiler steam fire say family have dish more dinner day get hold tool cup work raise arm dash cup ground spring say 
29,"""You shall have it,--you shall have my cup;--you don't know what a beauty it will be, when it is done.  Only let me finish it, and you shall have it in exchange for the stickleback you caught this morning. The stickleback will do to manure our garden; and I am sure you will like the cup, if you will only let me finish it.""",have have cup know beauty do let finish have exchange stickleback catch morning stickleback do manure garden sure like cup let finish 
30,"""Manure your garden, indeed!"" cried Stephen, gruffly.  ""I'll cut up your garden to shreds first.  What business has your garden in our carr?  You and your great landlord will find what it is to set your outlandish plants growing where our geese ought to be grazing.  We'll show you that we don't want any foreigners here; and if you don't like our usage, you may go home again; and nobody will cry for you back.""",manure garden cry cut garden shred business have garden carr great landlord find set outlandish plant grow geese graze show want foreigner like usage go cry 
31,"""We pay for our garden and our mill,"" said Oliver.  ""We wrong nobody, and we work for our living, and you are a very cruel man.""",pay garden mill say wrong work living cruel man 
32,"""You pay the king: and the parliament does not choose that the king should have any more money to spend against them.  Mind you that, boy! And--""",pay king parliament choose king have more money spend mind

34,"""You shall have reason to call me cruel twenty times over, if you don't get away out of our carr,"" said Stephen.  ""Manure your garden, indeed! Not I!  And you shall not manure another yard in these Levels.  Come here, Roger.""",have reason call cruel time get carr say manure garden manure yard level come 
35,"They went out again into the yard, and Oliver, now quite overcome, laid down his head on his arms, and cried bitterly.",go yard overcome lay head arm cry 
36,"""Here's your cup, however,"" said Ailwin, now released by Roger's being employed elsewhere.  ""This bit of plaster is the only thing they have laid hands on that they have not ruined.""  Oliver started up, and hid his work and tools in a bundle of straw, in the corner of the kitchen.",cup say release employ bit plaster only thing lay hand ruin start hide work tool bundle straw corner kitchen 
37,"""What Mildred will say, I don't know,"" said Ailwin.  ""That boy has wrung the neck of her white hen.""",say know say boy wrung neck white hen 
38,"Oliver was desperate on hearing this.  He ran out to see whether he could not, by any means, get into the mill, to set the sails agoing: but there were Stephen and Roger, carrying water, which they threw over all the gypsum that was ground,--floating away as much as they could of it, and utterly spoiling the rest, by turning it into a plaster.",desperate hear run see means get mill set sail be carry water throw gypsum ground float spoil rest turn plaster 
39,"""Did you ever see the like?"" cried Ailwin.  ""And there is nothing master is so particular about as keeping that stuff dry.  See the woman, too! How I'd like to tug the hair off her head!  She looks badly, poor creature, too.""",see like cry be master particular keep stuff dry see woman like tug hair head look poor creature 
40,"Stephen's wife had, indeed, come up to enjoy the sport, when she found that no man was on the premises, and that there was no danger.  There she stood, leaning against a post of the mill, her black, untidy hair hanging about her pale, hollow cheeks, and her lean arms crossed upon her bosom.",wife come enjoy sport find man premise be danger stand lean post mill black untidy hair hang pale hollow cheek lean arm cross bosom 
41,"""There were such ague-struck folk to be seen at every turn,"" said Ailwin, ""before the foreigners came to live in the carr.  I suppose they brought some healing with them; for one does not often see now such a poor creature as that.  She might be ashamed of herself,--that woman; she laughs all her poor sides can, at every pailful Roger pours out.-- Eh!  But she's not laughing now!  Eh!  What's the matter now?""",be such ague strike folk see turn say foreigner come live carr suppose bring healing see poor creature ashamed woman laugh poor side pailful pour laugh matter 
42,"The matter was that neighbour Gool was in sight, with three or four men. A cheer was heard from them while they were still some way off.  Oliver ran out and cheered, waving his hat over his head.  Ailwin cheered, waving a towel out of the window.  Mildred cheered from the roof, waving her red flag; and George stood in the doorway, shouting and clapping his little hands.",matter neighbour sight man cheer hear way run cheer wave hat head cheer wave towel window cheer roof wave red flag stand doorway shouting clap little hand 
43,"If the object was to catch the trespassers, all this cheering took place a little too soon.  Stephen and Roger were off, like their own wild-ducks,--over the garden hedge, and out of sight.  Neighbour Gool declared that if they were once fairly among the reeds in the marsh, it would be sheer waste of time to search for them; for they could dodge and live in the water, in a way that honest people that lived on proper hard ground could not follow.  Here was the woman; and yonder was the tent.  Revenge might be taken that way, better than by ducking in the ponds after the man and boy.  Suppose they took the woman to prison, and made a great fire in the carr, of the tent and everything in it!",object catch trespasser cheering take place little own wild duck garden hedge sight neighbour declare reed marsh sheer waste time search dodge live water way honest person live proper hard ground follow woman yonder tent revenge take way good duck pond man boy suppose take woman prison make great fire carr tent 
44,"Oliver did not see that it could make up to them for what they had lost, to burn the tent; and he was pretty sure his father would not wish such a thing to be done.  His father would soon be home.  As for the woman, he thought she ought to go to prison, if Mr Gool would take her there.",see make lose burn tent sure father wish thing do father woman think go prison take 
45,"""That I will,"" said Gool.  ""I will go through with the thing now I am in it.  I came off the minute I saw your red flag; and I might have been here sooner, if I had not been so full of watching the mill-sails, that I never looked off from them till my wife came to help to watch.

You will only have to bring me back, and be sorry you caught me, when you see what comes of it.""",get magistrate send prison say woman justice parliament one have bring sorry catch see come 
48,"""Cannot we take care of her here till father comes home?"" said Oliver, seeing that neighbour Gool looked perplexed, and as if he believed what the woman said.",take care father come say see neighbour look perplex believe woman say

51,"Neighbour Gool put on an air of being rather offended that nothing great was to be done, after his trouble in coming to help.  In his heart, however, he was perhaps not very sorry; for he knew that the magistrates were not willing to countenance the king's settlers in the Levels, while the Parliament Committee was sitting at Lincoln.  Gool patted Oliver's head when the boy thanked him for coming; and he joked Mildred about her flag: so he could not be very cross.  He left two men to guard the prisoner and the premises, till Mr Linacre should return.",neighbour put air offend great do trouble come help heart sorry know magistrate willing countenance king settler sit patt head boy thank come joke flag cross leave man guard prisoner premise return 
52,"These two men soon left off marching about the garden and yard, and sat down on the mill-steps; for the day grew very hot.  There they sat talking in the shade, till their dinners should be ready.  Nan Redfurn was so far from feeling the day to be hot, that when her cold ague-fit came on, she begged to be allowed to go down to the kitchen fire. Little George stood staring at her for some time, and then ran away; and Mildred, not liking to be in the same room with a woman who looked as she did, and who was a prisoner, stole out too, though she had been desired to watch the woman till dinner should be ready.  Ailwin was so struck with compassion, that she fetched her warmest woollen stockings and her winter cloak of linsey-woolsey,--it was such a piteous thing to hear a woman's teeth chattering in her head, in that way, at noon in the middle of August.  Having wrapped her up, she put her on a stool, close to the great kitchen fire; and drew out the screen that was used only in winter, to keep off the draughts from the door.  If the poor soul was not warm in that corner, nothing could make her so.  Then Ailwin began to sing to cheer her heart, and to be amazingly busy in cooking dinner for three additional persons.  She never left off her singing but when she out went for the vegetables, and other things she wanted for her cooking; and when she came in again she resumed her song,--still for the sake of the poor creature behind the screen.",man leave march garden yard sit mill step day grow hot sit talk shade dinner ready feel day hot cold ague fit come begg allow go kitchen fire little stand stare time run like same room woman look prisoner steal desire watch woman dinner ready strike compassion fetched warmest woollen stocking winter cloak linsey piteous thing hear woman tooth chatter head way noon middle wrap put stool close great kitchen fire draw screen use winter keep draught door poor soul warm corner make begin sing cheer heart busy cooking dinner additional person leave singing go vegetable other thing want cooking come resume song sake poor creature screen

54,"There was no answer; and Ailwin did not wonder, as she said to herself, that it was too great a trouble for one so poorly to be answering questions: so Ailwin went on slicing her vegetables and singing.",be answer wonder say great trouble answer question go slice vegetable sing 
55,"""Do you think a drop of cherry-brandy would warm you, neighbour?"" she asked, after a while.

Shall I get you a sup of cherry-brandy?""",think drop cherry brandy warm neighbour ask while wonder think sort thing recollect winter come get sup cherry brandy 
56,"Ailwin thought it so odd that such an offer as this should not be replied to, that she looked hastily behind the screen, to see what could be the reason.  There was reason enough.  Nobody was there.  Nan Redfurn had made her way out as soon as she found herself alone, and was gone, with Ailwin's best winter stockings and linsey-woolsey cloak.",think odd offer reply look screen see reason be reason make way find gone good winter stocking linsey cloak

71,"Mrs Linacre was more affected than her husband by what had happened. When she came home, poor Mildred's fortitude had just given way, and she was crying over the body of her dear white hen.

They must cling to the means of an honest maintenance, and not throw away such an employment as hers.  He would not leave the children again while the Redfurns were in the neighbourhood.  He would not have left them to-day, to serve anyone but the pastor; nor to serve even him, if he had not thought he had bespoken sufficient protection.  Nothing should take him from home, or his eye off the children, to-morrow, she might depend upon it.",declare more injury suffer country person more need earnings make cling means honest maintenance throw employment leave child neighbourhood leave day serve pastor serve think bespoke sufficient protection take home eye child depend 
75,"Mrs Linacre said that if she must go she should take a heavy heart with her.  This was, she feared, but the first of a fresh series of attacks. If so, what might not they look for next?  However, she only asked to be found in her duty.  If her husband desired her to go, she would go; but she should count over the hours of the day sadly enough.",say go take heavy heart fear first fresh series attack look next ask find duty husband desire go go count hour day 
76,"Oliver ventured to bring up an old subject.  He said what he most wanted was to have earned money enough to get a watch.  He was sure he could hide it so that Roger should never guess he had one; and it would be such a comfort to know exactly how the time was going, and when to look for his mother home, instead of having to guess, in cloudy weather, the hour of the day, and to argue the matter with Ailwin, who was always wrong about that particular thing.",venture bring old subject say want earn money get watch sure hide guess have comfort know time go look mother home have guess cloudy weather hour day argue matter wrong particular thing
