1,CHAPTER 12.,
2,"Juno had taken the children down to the cove, and, walking out into the water up to her knees, had dipped them in all over, as the shortest way of washing them, and had then dressed them and left them with their mother, while she assisted William to get the cups and saucers and plates for breakfast.  Everything was laid out nice and tidy between the two tents, and then William proposed that he should awaken Ready.",take child cove walk water knee dip short way wash dress leave mother assist get cup saucer plate breakfast lay nice tidy tent propose awake ready

6,"""Do,"" replied William, laughing.",reply laugh 
7,"Ready was soon dressed, for he had only taken off his jacket when he lay down.  He put it on, and came out of the tent; when, to his astonishment, he found the whole party (Mrs Seagrave having come out with the children) standing round the breakfast, which was spread on the ground.",ready dress take jacket lay put come tent astonishment find whole party come child stand breakfast spread ground 
8,"""Good-morning, Ready!"" said Mrs Seagrave, extending her hand.  Mr Seagrave also shook hands with him.",good morning ready say extend hand shake hand 
9,"""You have had a good long sleep, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""and I would not waken you after your fatigue of yesterday.""",have good long sleep ready say wake fatigue yesterday 
10,"""I thank you, sir; and I am glad to see that Madam is so well: and I am not sorry to see that you can do so well without me,"" continued Ready, smiling.",thank sir glad see sorry see do continue ready smile 
11,"""Indeed, but we cannot, I'm afraid,"" replied Mrs Seagrave; ""had it not been for you and your kindness, where should we have been now?""",afraid reply kindness 
12,"""We can get a breakfast ready without you,"" said Mr Seagrave; ""but without you, I think we never should have required another breakfast by this time.  But we will tell Ready all we have done while we eat our breakfast: now, my dear, if you please.""  Mrs Seagrave then read a chapter from the Bible, and afterwards they all knelt down while Mr Seagrave offered up a prayer.",get breakfast ready say think require breakfast time tell ready do eat breakfast dear read chapter knolt offer prayer 
13,"While they were at breakfast, William told Ready how they had gone on board, and what they had brought on shore, and he also mentioned how Juno had dipped all the children in the sea.",breakfast tell ready go board bring shore mention dip child sea 
14,"""But Juno must not do that again,"" replied Ready, ""until I have made all safe; you know that there are plenty of sharks about these islands, and it is very dangerous to go into the water.""",do reply ready make safe know be plenty shark island dangerous go water 
15,"""Oh, what an escape they have had!"" cried Mrs Seagrave, shuddering.",escape have cry shudder 
16,"""It's very true,"" continued Ready; ""but they don't keep so much to the windward of the islands where we are at present; but still that smooth cove is a very likely place for them to come into; so it's just as well not to go in again, Juno, until I have time to make a place for you to bathe in in safety.  As soon as we can get as much as we want from the ship, we must decide whether we shall stay here or not.""",true continue ready keep much windward island present smooth cove likely place come go have time make place bathe safety get much want ship decide stay 
17,"""Stay here or not, Ready!--what do you mean?""",stay ready mean 
18,"""Why, we have not yet found any water, and that is the first necessary of life--if there is no water on this side of the island, we must pitch our tents somewhere else.""",find water first necessary life be water side island pitch tent else 
19,"""That's very true,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""I wish we could find time to explore a little.""",true reply wish find time explore little 
20,"""So we can, sir; but we must not lose this fine weather to get a few things from the ship.  We had better go now.  You and William can remain on board to collect the things, and I will land them on the beach for Juno to bring up.""",sir lose fine weather get few thing ship have good go remain board collect thing land beach bring 
21,"The whole day was spent in landing every variety of article which they thought could be useful.  All the small sails, cordage, twine, canvas, small casks, saws, chisels, and large nails, and elm and oak plank, were brought on shore before dinner.  After they had taken a hearty dinner, the cabin tables and chairs, all their clothes, some boxes of candles, two bags of coffee, two of rice, two more of biscuits, several pieces of beef and pork and bags of flour, some more water, the grindstone, and Mrs Seagrave's medicine-chest were landed.  When Ready came off again, he said, ""Our poor boat is getting very leaky, and will not take much more on shore without being repaired; and Juno has not been able to get half the things up--they are too heavy for one person.  I think we shall do pretty well now, Mr Seagrave; and we had better, before it is dark, get all the animals on shore.  I don't much like to trust them to swim on shore, but they are awkward things in a boat.  We'll try a pig, at all events; and while I get one up, do you and William tie the legs of the fowls, and put them into the boat; as for the cow, she cannot be brought on shore, she is still lying down, and, I expect, won't get up again any more; however, I have given her plenty of hay, and if she don't rise, why I will kill her, and we can salt her down.""",whole day spend land variety article think useful small sail cordage twine canvas small cask saw chisel large nail elm oak plank bring shore dinner take hearty dinner cabin table chair clothes box candle bag coffee rice more biscuit several piece beef pork bag flour more water grindstone medicine chest land ready come say poor boat get leaky take more shore repair able get thing heavy person think do have good dark get animal shore like trust swim shore awkward thing boat try pig event get tie leg fowl put boat cow bring shore lie expect get more give plenty hay rise kill salt 
22,"Ready went below, and the squealing of the pig was soon heard; he came on deck with it hanging over his back by the hind legs, and threw it into the sea over the gunnel: the pig floundered at first; but after a few seconds, turned its head away from the ship and swam for the shore.",ready go squealing pig hear come deck hang back hind leg throw sea gunnel pig flounder first few second turn head ship swim shore 
23,"""He goes ashore straight enough,"" said Ready, who, with Mr Seagrave and William, was watching the animal; but a minute afterwards, Ready exclaimed:",go say ready watch animal minute ready exclaim 
24,"""I thought as much--we've lost him!""",think lose 
25,"""How?"" replied Mr Seagrave.",reply 
26,"""D'ye see that black thing above water pushing so fast to the animal?-- that's the back fin of a shark, and he will have the poor thing--there, he's got him!"" said Ready, as the pig disappeared under the water with a heavy splash.  ""Well, he's gone; better the pig than your little children, Mr Seagrave.""",see black thing water push animal back fin shark have poor thing get say ready pig disappear water heavy splash gone pig little child 
27,"""Yes, indeed, God be praised!--that monster might have been close to them at the time that Juno took them into the water.""",praise monster close time take water 
28,"""He was not far off; I reckon,"" replied Ready.  ""We'll go down now and tie the legs of the other four pigs, and bring them up; with what's already in the boat they will be a good load.""",reckon reply ready go tie leg other pig bring boat good load 
29,"As soon as the pigs were in the boat, Ready sculled it on shore, while Mr Seagrave and William brought up the goats and sheep ready for the next trip.  Ready soon returned.  ""Now this will be our last trip for to-day, and, if I am any judge of the weather, our last trip for some days; it is banking up very thick in the offing.  This trip we'll be able to put into the boat a bag of corn for the creatures, in case we require it, and then we may say good-bye to the ship for a day or two at least.""",pig boat ready scull shore bring goat sheep ready next trip ready return last trip day judge weather last trip day banking thick offing trip able put boat bag corn creature case require say good bye ship day least 
30,"They then all got into the boat, which was very deeply laden, for the corn was heavy, but they got safe on shore, although they leaked very much.  Having landed the goats and sheep, William led them up to the tent, where they remained very quietly; the pigs had run away, and so had the fowls.",get boat laden corn heavy get safe shore leak land goat sheep lead tent remain pig run have fowl 
31,"""That's what I call a good day's work, Mr Seagrave,"" said Ready; ""the little boat has done its duty well; but we must not venture in her again until I have put her into a little better condition.""",call good day work say ready little boat do duty venture put little good condition 
32,"They were not at all sorry, after their hard day's work, to find that Juno had prepared coffee for them; and while they were drinking it, they narrated to Mrs Seagrave the tragically death of the poor pig by the shark.  Poor Juno appeared quite frightened at the danger which the children had been in, even now that it was all over.",sorry hard day work find prepare coffee drink narrate death poor pig shark poor appear frighten danger child 
33,"""We shall have plenty to do here to-morrow,"" observed Mr Seagrave, ""in getting things into their places.""",have plenty do observe get thing place

35,"""What's the first thing we must do, Ready?"" inquired Mr Seagrave.",first thing do ready inquire 
36,"""To-morrow we had better fix up another tent or two, to stow away all the articles we have brought on shore: that will be one good day's work; we shall then know where to lay our hands upon everything, and see what we want.""",have good fix tent stow article bring shore good day work know lay hand see want 
37,"""That's very true; and what shall we do then?""",true do 
38,"""Why then, sir, I think we must make a little expedition to explore the island, and find out where we must build our house.""",sir think make little expedition explore island find build house 
39,"""Can we build a house?"" said William.",build house say 
40,"""Oh, yes, sir, and with more ease than you would think.  There's no tree so valuable as the cocoa-nut tree; and the wood is so light that we can easily move it about.""",sir more ease think be tree valuable cocoa nut tree wood light move 
41,"""Why, what are the great merits of the cocoa-nut tree?"" said Mrs Seagrave.",great merit cocoa nut tree say 
42,"""I'll tell you, madam: in the first place, you have the wood to build the house with; then you have the bark with which you can make ropes and lines, and fishing-nets if you please; then you have the leaves for thatching your house; then you have the fruit, which, as a nut, is good to eat, and very useful in cooking; and in the young nut is the milk, which is also very wholesome; then you have the oil to burn, and the shell to make cups of, if you haven't any, and then you can draw toddy from the tree, which is very pleasant to drink when fresh, but will make you tipsy if it is kept too long.  There is no tree which yields so many useful things to man, for it supplies him with almost everything.""",tell madam first place have wood build house have bark make rope line fishing net have leave thatch house have fruit nut good eat useful cooking young nut milk wholesome have oil burn shell make cup draw toddy tree pleasant drink fresh make tipsy keep long be tree yield many useful thing man supply 
43,"""At all events, we've plenty of them,"" said William.",event plenty say 
44,"""Yes, William, there's no want of them; and I am glad of it, for had there been but few, I should not have liked to destroy them.  People might be wrecked here, as well as ourselves, and without the good fortune that we have had in getting so many necessaries on shore; and they might be obliged to depend wholly upon the cocoa-nut trees for their support.""",be want glad be few like destroy person wreck good fortune have get many necessary shore oblige depend cocoa nut tree support
