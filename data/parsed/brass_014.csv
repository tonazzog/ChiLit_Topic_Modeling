104,"He found a full account of the combat with the Efreet in ""The Story of the Second Royal Mendicant"" in the first volume, and was unpleasantly surprised to discover that the Efreet's name was actually given as ""Jarjarees, the son of Rejmoos, the son of Iblees""--evidently the same person to whom Fakrash had referred as his bitterest foe. He was described as ""of hideous aspect,"" and had, it seemed, not only carried off the daughter of the Lord of the Ebony Island on her wedding night, but, on discovering her in the society of the Royal Mendicant, had revenged himself by striking off her hands, her feet, and her head, and transforming his human rival into an ape.

105,"He read on till he reached the memorable encounter between the King's daughter and Jarjarees, who presented himself ""in a most hideous shape, with hands like winnowing forks, and legs like masts, and eyes like burning torches""--which was calculated to unnerve the stoutest novice. The Efreet began by transforming himself from a lion to a scorpion, upon which the Princess became a serpent; then he changed to an eagle, and she to a vulture; he to a black cat, and she to a cock; he to a fish, and she to a larger fish still.",read reach memorable encounter daughter present hideous shape hand winnowing fork leg mast eye burn torche calculate unnerve stoutest novice begin transform lion scorpion become serpent change eagle vulture black cat cock fish large fish 
106,"""If Fakrash can shove me through all that without a fatal hitch somewhere,"" Ventimore told himself, ""I shall be agreeably disappointed in him,"" But, after reading a few more lines, he cheered up. For the Efreet finished as a flame, and the Princess as a ""body of fire."" ""And when we looked towards him,"" continued the narrator, ""we perceived that he had become a heap of ashes.""",shove fatal hitch tell disappointed read few more line cheer finish flame body fire look continue narrator perceive become heap ash

109,"He worked steadily through the whole of the second volume and part of the third; but, although he picked up a certain amount of information upon Oriental habits and modes of thought and speech which might come in useful later, it was not until he arrived at the 24th Chapter of the third volume that his interest really revived.",work whole second volume part third pick certain amount information oriental habit mode thought speech come useful arrive 24th third volume interest revive 
110,"For the 24th Chapter contained ""The Story of Seyf-el-Mulook and Bedeea-el-Jemal,"" and it was only natural that he should be anxious to know all that there was to know concerning the antecedents of one who might be his _fiancée_ before long. He read eagerly.",24th contain natural anxious know be know concern antecedent _fiancée_ long read 
111,"Bedeea, it appeared, was the lovely daughter of Shahyal, one of the Kings of the Believing Jann; her father--not Fakrash himself, as the Jinnee had incorrectly represented--had offered her in marriage to no less a personage than King Solomon himself, who, however, had preferred the Queen of Sheba. Seyf, the son of the King of Egypt, afterwards fell desperately in love with Bedeea, but she and her grandmother both declared that between mankind and the Jann there could be no agreement.",appear lovely daughter father represent offer marriage personage prefer son fall love grandmother declare mankind be agreement

113,"His heart grew lighter still as he came to the end, for he learnt that, after many adventures which need not be mentioned here, the devoted Seyf did actually succeed in gaining the proud Bedeea as his wife.

115,"""If that means anything at all,"" he reasoned, ""it means that Seyf and Bedeea are both deceased. Even Jinneeyeh seem to be mortal. Or perhaps she became so by marrying a mortal; I dare say that Fakrash himself wouldn't have lasted all this time if he hadn't been bottled, like a tinned tomato. But I'm glad I found this out, because Fakrash is evidently unaware of it, and, if he _should_ persist in any more of this nonsense, I think I see my way now to getting the better of him.""",mean reason mean decease seem mortal become marry mortal say last time bottled tinn tomato glad find unaware persist more nonsense think see way get good
