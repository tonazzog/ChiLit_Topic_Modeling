2," But they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came some very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which two things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him into a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning to do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes, to talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams.  The things he had to tell about otters' and badgers' and water-rats' houses, not to mention birds' nests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an animal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety the whole busy underworld was working.",oblige wait more week come windy day threaten cold thing happen other throw rage be much careful mysterious planning do day come few minute talk happen moor lane hedge border stream thing have tell otter badger water rats' house mention bird nest field mouse burrow enough make tremble excitement hear intimate detail animal charmer realize thrilling eagerness anxiety whole busy underworld work

4,"The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made before Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden.  No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after they turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls.  As each day passed, Colin had become more and more fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms.  Nothing must spoil that.  No one must ever suspect that they had a secret.  People must think that he was simply going out with Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object to their looking at him.  They had long and quite delightful talks about their route.  They would go up this path and down that one and cross the other and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were looking at the ""bedding-out plants"" the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been having arranged.  That would seem such a rational thing to do that no one would think it at all mysterious.  They would turn into the shrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls. It was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by great generals in time of war.",absorb thing preparation make transport sufficient secrecy garden see chair carriage turn certain corner shrubbery enter walk ivied wall day pass become fix feeling mystery surround garden great charm spoil suspect have secret person think go like object look have long delightful talk route go path cross other go fountain flower bed look bedding out plant head gardener arrange seem rational thing do think mysterious turn shrubbery walk lose come long wall serious think plan march make great general time war 
5,"Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the invalid's apartments had of course filtered through the servants' hall into the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding this, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from Master Colin's room to the effect that he must report himself in the apartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to speak to him.",rumor new curious thing occur invalid apartment course filter servant hall stable yard gardener notwithstand startle day receive order room effect report apartment outsider see invalid desire speak

7,"Mr. Roach was not without curiosity.  He had never caught even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny looks and ways and his insane tempers.

13,"It was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been startled.  When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed quite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the entrance of a visitor by saying ""Caw--Caw"" quite loudly.  In spite of Mrs. Medlock's warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward.",prepare startle bedroom door open large crow seem home perch high back carve chair announce entrance visitor say spite warning escape undignified jump 
14,The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa.  He was sitting in an armchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail in feeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle.  A squirrel was perched on Dickon's bent back attentively nibbling a nut.

19,"""I am going out in my chair this afternoon,"" said Colin.  ""If the fresh air agrees with me I may go out every day.  When I go, none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls. No one is to be there.  I shall go out about two o'clock and everyone must keep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.""",go chair afternoon say fresh air agree go day go gardener long garden wall go o'clock keep send word go work 
20,"""Very good, sir,"" replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the oaks might remain and that the orchards were safe.

I've a picture like it in one of my books--crowds of lovely people and children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them, everyone laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes.

50,"Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily.  Mistress Mary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his face to the sky.  The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness.  The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness.  Colin kept lifting his thin chest to draw it in, and his big eyes looked as if it were they which were listening--listening, instead of his ears.",begin push wheel chair walk learn lift face sky arch look high small snowy cloud seem white bird float outspread wing crystal blueness wind sweep soft big breath moor strange wild clear scent sweetness keep lift thin chest draw big eye look listen listen ear

53,"Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took. In fact every gardener or gardener's lad had been witched away.  But they wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountain beds, following their carefully planned route for the mere mysterious pleasure of it.  But when at last they turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them, for some curious reason they could not have explained, begin to speak in whispers.",human creature catch sight path take fact gardener gardener lad witch wind shrubbery fountain bed follow plan route mere mysterious pleasure last turn long ivied wall excite sense approach thrill make curious reason explain begin speak whisper

68,"And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.",do strong steady splendid push 
69,"But Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even though he gasped with delight, and he had covered his eyes with his hands and held them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as if by magic and the door was closed.  Not till then did he take them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary had done.  And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents.  And the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely touch.  And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him. He looked so strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually crept all over him--ivory face and neck and hands and all.",drop cushion gasp delight cover eye hand hold shut chair stop magic door close take look do wall earth tree swing spray tendril fair green veil tender little leave creep grass tree gray urn alcove touch splashe gold purple white tree show pink snow head be flutter wing faint sweet pipe hum scent scent sun fall warm face hand lovely touch wonder stand stare look strange different pink glow color creep ivory face neck hand
