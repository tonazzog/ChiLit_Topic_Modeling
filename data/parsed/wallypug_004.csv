1,CHAPTER III. A TERRIBLE NIGHT.,terrible night 
2," MY reception at Why had been such a very peculiar one that I had fully made up my mind to return home at once, but his Majesty the Wallypug begged me so earnestly to stay with him, at any rate for a few days, that I determined, out of friendship to him, to put up as best I could with that extraordinary person the Sister-in-Law, and the rest of the creatures, and remain, in order to help him if possible to establish his position at Why on a firmer basis.",reception peculiar one make mind return begg stay rate few day determine friendship put good extraordinary person rest creature remain order help possible establish position firmer basis 
3,"So I took possession of a suite of rooms in the west wing of the palace, near his Majesty’s private apartments, and we spent a very pleasant evening together in my sitting-room, playing draughts till bedtime, when his Majesty left me to myself, promising that he would show me around the palace grounds the first thing in the morning.",take possession suite room west wing palace private apartment spend pleasant evening sitting room play draught bedtime leave promise show palace grounds first thing morning 
4,"After he had gone, there being a bright wood fire burning in my bedroom, I drew a high-backed easy-chair up to the old-fashioned fireplace, and made myself comfortable for a little while before retiring for the night.",go be bright wood fire burn bedroom draw high back easy chair old fashioned fireplace make comfortable little while retire night 
5,"My bedroom was a large, old-fashioned apartment, with a low ceiling and curiously carved oak wainscoting, and I watched the firelight flickering, and casting all sorts of odd shadows in the dark corners, till I must have fallen asleep, for I remember awaking with a start, at hearing a crash in the corridor outside my bedroom door. A muttered exclamation, and a Pelican, carrying a bedroom candlestick marched in, and carefully fastened the door behind him.",bedroom large old fashioned apartment low ceiling carve oak wainscoting watch firelight flicker cast sort odd shadow dark corner fall asleep remember awake start hear crash corridor bedroom door mutter exclamation carry bedroom candlestick march fasten door 
6,"“Great clumsy things—I can’t think who can have left them there,” he grumbled, sitting down and rubbing one foot against the other, as though in pain. And I suddenly came to the conclusion that he must have stumbled over my boots, which I had stood just outside the door, in order that they might be cleaned for the morning.",great clumsy thing think leave grumble sit rub foot other pain come conclusion stumble boot stand door order clean morning 
7,"The Pelican had not noticed me in my high-backed chair, and, being rather curious to see what he was up to, I kept perfectly still.",notice high back chair curious see keep 
8,"Going over to a clothes press, which stood in one corner of the room, the bird drew forth a long white night-gown and a nightcap; these he proceeded solemnly to array himself in, and then, getting up on a chair, he turned back the bedclothes with his enormous beak, and was just about to hop into bed, when I thought that it was time for me to interfere.",go clothes press stand corner room bird draw long white night gown nightcap proceed array get chair turn bedclothe enormous beak about hop bed think time interfere

11,"“Oh—h-h! Ah—h-h! There’s a man in my room!” screamed the Pelican, evidently greatly alarmed. “Murder! Fire! Police! Thieves!”",be man room scream alarmed murder fire police thieve 
12,"“Hold your tongue!” I commanded. “What do you mean by making all that noise at this time of night, and what are you doing in my room?”",hold tongue command mean make noise time night do room 
13,"“Your room, indeed!” gasped the bird; “my room you mean, you featherless biped, you!”",room gasp bird room mean featherless biped 
14,"“Look here!” I remarked, going up to the Pelican, and shaking him till his beak rattled again. “Don’t you talk to me like that, my good bird, for I won’t put up with it.” You see I was getting tired of being treated so contemptuously by all of these creatures, and was determined to put a stop to it, somehow.",look remark go shake beak rattle talk good bird put see get tired treat creature determined put stop 
15,"“But it _is_ my room. Let me go, I say!” screamed the bird, struggling to get free, and dabbing at me viciously with his great beak.",room let go say scream bird struggle get free dabb great beak 
16,"“It is not your room,” I maintained; “and what is more, you are not going to stay here,” and I pushed the creature towards the door.",room maintain more go stay push creature door 
17,"“We’ll soon see all about that,” shouted the Pelican, wrenching himself from my grasp, and rushing at me with his beak wide open, and his wings outstretched.",see shout wrench grasp rush beak open wing outstretch 
18,"He was an enormous bird, and I had a great struggle with him. We went banging about the room, knocking over the furniture and making a terrible racket. At last, however, I managed to get him near the door, and giving a terrific shove I pushed him outside, and, pulling the door to, quickly turned the key.",enormous bird have great struggle go bang room knock furniture make terrible racket last manage get door give terrific shove push pull door turn key 
19,"I could hear Mr. Pelican slipping and stumbling about on the highly polished floor of the corridor outside, and muttering indignantly. Presently he came to the door, and banging with his beak, he cried, “Look here! this is beyond a joke—let me in, I say—where do you suppose I am going to sleep?”",hear slip stumble polished floor corridor mutter come door bang beak cry look joke let say suppose go sleep 
20,"“Anywhere you like except here,” I replied, feeling that I had got the best of it. “Go and perch or roost, or whatever you call it, on the banisters, or sleep on the mat if you like—I don’t care what you do!”",like reply feel get good go perch roost call banister sleep mat like care do 
21,"“Impertinent wretch!” yelled the bird. “You only wait till the morning. I’ll pay you out;” and I could hear him muttering and mumbling in an angry way as he waddled down the corridor to seek some other resting-place. “What ridiculous nonsense it is,” I thought, as I tumbled into bed shortly after this little episode; “these creatures giving themselves such airs. No wonder the Wallypug is such a meek little person if he has been subjected to this sort of treatment all his life.” And pondering over the best method of altering the extraordinary state of affairs, I dropped off to sleep.",impertinent wretch yell bird wait morning pay hear mutter mumble angry way waddle corridor seek other resting place ridiculous nonsense think tumble bed little episode creature give such air wonder little person subject sort treatment life ponder good method alter extraordinary state affair drop sleep 
22,"I do not know how long it may have been after this, but a terrific din, this time in the courtyard below my window, caused me once more to jump from my bed in alarm. I could hear a most unearthly yelling going on, a babel of voices, and occasionally a resounding crash as though something hollow had been violently struck.",know terrific din time courtyard window cause more jump bed alarm hear unearthly yelling go babel voice resounding crash hollow strike 
23,[HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A SHOWER OF MISSILES.],interrupte shower missile 
24,"Pushing open the latticed windows I saw in the moonlight a little man dressed in a complete suit of armor with an enormous shield, like a dishcover, arranged over his head, playing the guitar, and endeavoring to sing to its accompaniment. He was continually interrupted, however, by a shower of missiles thrown from all of the windows overlooking the courtyard, out of which angry heads of animals and other occupants of the palace were thrust; he was surrounded by a miscellaneous collection of articles which had evidently been thrown at him, and some of them, had it not been for his suit of armor and the erection over his head, would have caused him considerable injury.",push open latticed window see moonlight little man dress complete suit armor enormous shield dishcover arrange head play guitar endeavor sing accompaniment interrupt shower missile throw window overlook courtyard angry head animal other occupant palace thrust surround miscellaneous collection article throw suit armor erection head cause considerable injury

26,"He did not seem to mind them in the least, though, and continued singing amid a perfect storm of boots, brushes, and bottles, as though he was quite accustomed to such treatment: and it was only when an irate figure, which somehow reminded me of his Majesty’s Sister-in-Law, clad in white garments and flourishing a pair of tongs, appeared in the courtyard, that he took to his heels and fled, pursued by the white-robed apparition, till both disappeared beneath an archway at the farther end of the courtyard. Most of the windows were thereupon closed, and the disturbed occupants of the palace returned to their rest. I was just about to close my lattice too, when I caught sight of a familiar figure at the adjoining window. It was my old friend A. Fish, Esq.",seem mind least continue sing perfect storm boot brush bottle accustom such treatment irate figure remind clad white garment flourish pair tong appear courtyard take heel flead pursue white robe apparition disappear archway far end courtyard most window close disturb occupant palace return rest about close lattice catch sight familiar figure adjoin window old friend
