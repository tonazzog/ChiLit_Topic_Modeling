2,"‘Your majesty shouldn’t purr so loud,’ Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. ‘You woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you’ve been along with me, Kitty--all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?’",majesty purr say rub eye address kitten severity wake nice dream world know dear 
3,"It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. ‘If they would only purr for “yes” and mew for “no,” or any rule of that sort,’ she had said, ‘so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN you talk with a person if they always say the same thing?’",inconvenient habit kitten make remark say purr purr meew rule sort say keep conversation talk person say same thing

5,"So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. ‘Now, Kitty!’ she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. ‘Confess that was what you turned into!’",hunt chessmen table find red go knee hearth rug put kitten look other cry clap hand confess turn

7,"‘Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!’ Alice cried with a merry laugh. ‘And curtsey while you’re thinking what to--what to purr. It saves time, remember!’ And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, ‘just in honour of having been a Red Queen.’",sit little dear cry merry laugh curtsey think purr save time remember catch give little kiss honour red 
8,"‘Snowdrop, my pet!’ she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, ‘when WILL Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream--Dinah! do you know that you’re scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it’s most disrespectful of you!",pet go look shoulder white undergo toilet finish white wonder reason untidy dream know scrubb white disrespectful 
9,"‘And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder?’ she prattled on, as she settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand, to watch the kittens. ‘Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty? I THINK you did--however, you’d better not mention it to your friends just yet, for I’m not sure.",turn wonder prattle settle elbow rug chin hand watch kitten tell turn think mention friend sure 
10,"‘By the way, Kitty, if only you’d been really with me in my dream, there was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real treat. All the time you’re eating your breakfast, I’ll repeat “The Walrus and the Carpenter” to you; and then you can make believe it’s oysters, dear!",way dream be thing enjoy have quantity poetry say fish morning have real treat time eat breakfast repeat make believe oyster dear 
11,"‘Now, Kitty, let’s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a serious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your paw like that--as if Dinah hadn’t washed you this morning! You see, Kitty, it MUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream, of course--but then I was part of his dream, too! WAS it the Red King, Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--Oh, Kitty, DO help to settle it! I’m sure your paw can wait!’ But the provoking kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn’t heard the question.",let consider dream serious question dear go lick paw wash morning see red part dream course part dream red wife dear know help settle sure paw wait provoking kitten begin other paw pretend hear question
