2," Imprisonment--Sinking hopes--Unexpected freedom to more than one, and in more senses than one.",imprisonment sink hope unexpected freedom more more sense 
3,"For a long long month we remained in our dark and dreary prison, during which dismal time we did not see the face of a human being, except that of the silent savage who brought us our daily food.",long long month remain dark dreary prison dismal time see face human being silent savage bring daily food 
4,"There have been one or two seasons in my life during which I have felt as if the darkness of sorrow and desolation that crushed my inmost heart could never pass away, until death should make me cease to feel the present was such a season.",be season life feel darkness sorrow desolation crush inmost heart pass death make cease feel present season 
5,"During the first part of our confinement we felt a cold chill at our hearts every time we heard a foot-fall near the cave--dreading lest it should prove to be that of our executioner.  But as time dragged heavily on, we ceased to feel this alarm, and began to experience such a deep, irrepressible longing for freedom, that we chafed and fretted in our confinement like tigers.  Then a feeling of despair came over us, and we actually longed for the time when the savages would take us forth to die! But these changes took place very gradually, and were mingled sometimes with brighter thoughts; for there were times when we sat in that dark cavern on our ledge of rock and conversed almost pleasantly about the past, until we well-nigh forgot the dreary present.  But we seldom ventured to touch upon the future.",first part confinement feel cold chill heart time hear foot fall cave dread prove executioner time drag cease feel alarm begin experience deep irrepressible longing freedom chafe fret confinement tiger feeling despair come long time savage take die change take place mingle bright thought be time sit dark cavern ledge rock convers past forget dreary present venture touch future 
6,"A few decayed leaves and boughs formed our bed; and a scanty supply of yams and taro, brought to us once a-day, constituted our food.",few decay leave bough form bed scanty supply yam taro bring day constitute food 
7,"""Well, Ralph, how have you slept?"" said Jack, in a listless tone, on rising one morning from his humble couch.  ""Were you much disturbed by the wind last night?""",sleep say listless tone rise morning humble couch disturb wind last night 
8,"""No,"" said I; ""I dreamed of home all night, and I thought that my mother smiled upon me, and beckoned me to go to her; but I could not, for I was chained.""",say dream home night think mother smile beckon go chain 
9,"""And I dreamed, too,"" said Peterkin; ""but it was of our happy home on the Coral Island.  I thought we were swimming in the Water Garden; then the savages gave a yell, and we were immediately in the cave at Spouting Cliff, which, somehow or other, changed into this gloomy cavern; and I awoke to find it true.""",dream say happy home coral think swim savage give yell cave spout other change gloomy cavern awoke find true 
10,"Peterkin's tone was so much altered by the depressing influence of his long imprisonment, that, had I not known it was he who spoke, I should scarcely have recognised it, so sad was it, and so unlike to the merry, cheerful voice we had been accustomed to hear.  I pondered this much, and thought of the terrible decline of happiness that may come on human beings in so short a time; how bright the sunshine in the sky at one time, and, in a short space, how dark the overshadowing cloud!  I had no doubt that the Bible would have given me much light and comfort on this subject, if I had possessed one, and I once more had occasion to regret deeply having neglected to store my memory with its consoling truths.",tone alter depressing influence long imprisonment know speak recognise sad merry cheerful voice accustom hear ponder much think terrible decline happiness come human being short time bright sunshine sky time short space dark overshadow cloud have doubt give much light comfort subject possess have occasion regret neglect store memory consol truth 
11,"While I meditated thus, Peterkin again broke the silence of the cave, by saying, in a melancholy tone, ""Oh, I wonder if we shall ever see our dear island more.""",meditate break silence cave say melancholy tone wonder see dear island 
12,"His voice trembled, and, covering his face with both hands, he bent down his head and wept.  It was an unusual sight for me to see our once joyous companion in tears, and I felt a burning desire to comfort him; but, alas! what could I say?  I could hold out no hope; and although I essayed twice to speak, the words refused to pass my lips.  While I hesitated, Jack sat down beside him, and whispered a few words in his ear, while Peterkin threw himself on his friend's breast, and rested his head on his shoulder.",voice tremble cover face hand bend head goot unusual sight see joyous companion tear feel burn desire comfort say hold hope essay speak word refuse pass lip hesitate sit whisper few word ear throw friend breast rest head shoulder 
13,"Thus we sat for some time in deep silence.  Soon after, we heard footsteps at the entrance of the cave, and immediately our jailer entered.  We were so much accustomed to his regular visits, however, that we paid little attention to him, expecting that he would set down our meagre fare, as usual, and depart.  But, to our surprise, instead of doing so, he advanced towards us with a knife in his hand, and, going up to Jack, he cut the thongs that bound his wrists, then he did the same to Peterkin and me!  For fully five minutes we stood in speechless amazement, with our freed hands hanging idly by our sides.  The first thought that rushed into my mind was, that the time had come to put us to death; and although, as I have said before, we actually wished for death in the strength of our despair, now that we thought it drew really near I felt all the natural love of life revive in my heart, mingled with a chill of horror at the suddenness of our call.",sit time deep silence hear footstep entrance cave jailer enter accustom regular visit pay little attention expect set meagre fare usual depart surprise do advance knife hand go cut thong bind wrist do same minute stand speechless amazement free hand hang side first thought rush mind time come put death say wish death strength despair think draw feel natural love life revive heart mingle chill horror suddenness call 
14,"But I was mistaken.  After cutting our bonds, the savage pointed to the cave's mouth, and we marched, almost mechanically, into the open air. Here, to our surprise, we found the teacher standing under a tree, with his hands clasped before him, and the tears trickling down his dark cheeks.  On seeing Jack, who came out first, he sprang towards him, and clasping him in his arms, exclaimed,--",mistaken cut bond savage point cave mouth march open air surprise find teacher stand tree hand clasp tear trickle dark cheek see come spring clasp arm exclaim 
15,"""Oh! my dear young friend, through the great goodness of God you are free!""",dear young friend great goodness free 
16,"""Free!"" cried Jack.",free cry 
17,"""Ay, free,"" repeated the teacher, shaking us warmly by the hands again and again; ""free to go and come as you will.  The Lord has unloosed the bands of the captive and set the prisoners free.  A missionary has been sent to us, and Tararo has embraced the Christian religion!  The people are even now burning their gods of wood!  Come, my dear friends, and see the glorious sight.""",free repeat teacher shake hand free go come unloose band captive set prisoner free missionary send embrace christian religion person burn god wood come dear friend see glorious sight 
18,"We could scarcely credit our senses.  So long had we been accustomed in our cavern to dream of deliverance, that we imagined for a moment this must surely be nothing more than another vivid dream.  Our eyes and minds were dazzled, too, by the brilliant sunshine, which almost blinded us after our long confinement to the gloom of our prison, so that we felt giddy with the variety of conflicting emotions that filled our throbbing bosoms; but as we followed the footsteps of our sable friend, and beheld the bright foliage of the trees, and heard the cries of the paroquets, and smelt the rich perfume of the flowering shrubs, the truth, that we were really delivered from prison and from death, rushed with overwhelming power into our souls, and, with one accord, while tears sprang to our eyes, we uttered a loud long cheer of joy.",credit sense accustom cavern dream deliverance imagine moment more vivid dream eye mind dazzle brilliant sunshine blind long confinement gloom prison feel giddy variety conflict emotion fill throbbing bosom follow footstep sable friend beheld bright foliage tree hear cry paroquet smell rich perfume flower shrub truth deliver prison death rush overwhelming power soul accord tear spring eye utter loud long cheer joy 
19,"It was replied to by a shout from a number of the natives who chanced to be near.  Running towards us, they shook us by the hand with every demonstration of kindly feeling.  They then fell behind, and, forming a sort of procession, conducted us to the dwelling of Tararo.",reply shout number native chance runn shake hand demonstration kindly feeling fall form sort procession conduct dwelling 
20,"The scene that met our eyes here was one that I shall never forget.  On a rude bench in front of his house sat the chief.  A native stood on his left hand, who, from his dress, seemed to be a teacher.  On his right stood an English gentleman, who, I at once and rightly concluded, was a missionary.  He was tall, thin, and apparently past forty, with a bald forehead, and thin gray hair.  The expression of his countenance was the most winning I ever saw, and his clear gray eye beamed with a look that was frank, fearless, loving, and truthful.  In front of the chief was an open space, in the centre of which lay a pile of wooden idols, ready to be set on fire; and around these were assembled thousands of natives, who had come to join in or to witness the unusual sight.  A bright smile overspread the missionary's face as he advanced quickly to meet us, and he shook us warmly by the hands.",scene meet eye forget rude bench front house sit chief native stand left hand dress seem teacher right stand english gentleman conclude missionary tall thin bald forehead thin gray hair expression countenance win see clear gray eye beam look frank fearless loving truthful front chief open space centre lay pile wooden idol ready set fire assemble thousand native come join witness unusual sight bright smile overspread missionary face advance meet shake hand 
21,"""I am overjoyed to meet you, my dear young friends,"" he said.  ""My friend, and your friend, the teacher, has told me your history; and I thank our Father in heaven, with all my heart, that he has guided me to this island, and made me the instrument of saving you.""",overjoyed meet dear young friend say friend friend teacher tell history thank father heaven heart guide island make instrument save 
22,"We thanked the missionary most heartily, and asked him in some surprise how he had succeeded in turning the heart of Tararo in our favour.",thank missionary ask surprise succeed turn heart favour 
23,"""I will tell you that at a more convenient time,"" he answered, ""meanwhile we must not forget the respect due to the chief.  He waits to receive you.""",tell convenient time answer forget respect due chief wait receive 
24,"In the conversation that immediately followed between us and Tararo, the latter said that the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ had been sent to the island, and that to it we were indebted for our freedom.  Moreover, he told us that we were at liberty to depart in our schooner whenever we pleased, and that we should be supplied with as much provision as we required.  He concluded by shaking hands with us warmly, and performing the ceremony of rubbing noses.",conversation follow latter say light gospel send island indebt freedom tell liberty depart schooner pleased supply much provision require conclude shake hand perform ceremony rub nose 
25,"This was indeed good news to us, and we could hardly find words to express our gratitude to the chief and to the missionary.",good news find word express gratitude chief missionary 
26,"""And what of Avatea?"" inquired Jack.",inquire 
27,"The missionary replied by pointing to a group of natives in the midst of whom the girl stood.  Beside her was a tall, strapping fellow, whose noble mien and air of superiority bespoke him a chief of no ordinary kind.",missionary reply point group native midst girl stand tall strapp fellow noble mien air superiority bese chief ordinary kind 
28,"""That youth is her lover.  He came this very morning in his war-canoe to treat with Tararo for Avatea.  He is to be married in a few days, and afterwards returns to his island home with his bride!""",youth lover come very morning war canoe treat marry few day return island home bride 
29,"""That's capital,"" said Jack, as he stepped up to the savage and gave him a hearty shake of the hand.  ""I wish you joy, my lad;--and you too, Avatea.""",capital say step savage give hearty shake hand wish joy lad 
30,"As Jack spoke, Avatea's lover took him by the hand and led him to the spot where Tararo and the missionary stood, surrounded by most of the chief men of the tribe.  The girl herself followed, and stood on his left hand while her lover stood on his right, and, commanding silence, made the following speech, which was translated by the missionary:--",speak lover take hand lead spot missionary stand surround most chief man tribe girl follow stand left hand lover stand right commanding silence make follow speech translate missionary 
31,"""Young friend, you have seen few years, but your head is old.  Your heart also is large and very brave.  I and Avatea are your debtors, and we wish, in the midst of this assembly, to acknowledge our debt, and to say that it is one which we can never repay.  You have risked your life for one who was known to you only for a few days.  But she was a woman in distress, and that was enough to secure to her the aid of a Christian man.  We, who live in these islands of the sea, know that the true Christians always act thus.  Their religion is one of love and kindness. We thank God that so many Christians have been sent here--we hope many more will come.  Remember that I and Avatea will think of you and pray for you and your brave comrades when you are far away.""",young friend see few year head old heart large brave debtor wish midst assembly acknowledge debt say repay risk life know few day woman distress enough secure aid christian man live island sea know true act religion love kindness thank many send hope many more come remember think pray brave comrade 
32,"To this kind speech Jack returned a short sailor-like reply, in which he insisted that he had only done for Avatea what he would have done for any woman under the sun.  But Jack's forte did not lie in speech-making, so he terminated rather abruptly by seizing the chief's hand and shaking it violently, after which he made a hasty retreat.",kind speech return short sailor like reply insist do do woman sun forte lie speech make terminate seize chief hand shake make hasty retreat 
33,"""Now, then, Ralph and Peterkin,"" said Jack, as we mingled with the crowd, ""it seems to me that the object we came here for having been satisfactorily accomplished, we have nothing more to do but get ready for sea as fast as we can, and hurrah for dear old England!""",say mingle crowd seem object come accomplish have more do get ready sea hurrah dear old 
34,"""That's my idea precisely,"" said Peterkin, endeavouring to wink, but he had wept so much of late, poor fellow, that he found it difficult; ""however, I'm not going away till I see these fellows burn their gods.""",idea say endeavour wink goot much late poor fellow find difficult go see fellow burn god 
35,"Peterkin had his wish, for, in a few minutes afterwards, fire was put to the pile, the roaring flames ascended, and, amid the acclamations of the assembled thousands, the false gods of Mango were reduced to ashes!",have wish few minute fire put pile roar flame ascend acclamation assemble thousand false god reduce ash
