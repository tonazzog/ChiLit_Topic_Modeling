2,"          That handkerchief   Did an Egyptian to my mother give;   She was a charmer, and could almost read   The thoughts of people.--_Othello._",handkerchief mother give charmer read thought person 
3," ""That gypsy woman who is coming with her cart,"" said the parrot, ""is a fairy too, and very malicious. It was she and others of her tribe who caught us and put us into these cages, for they are more powerful than we. Mind you do not let her allure you into the woods, nor wheedle you or frighten you into giving her any of those fairies.""",gypsy woman come cart say parrot fairy malicious other tribe catch put cage powerful mind let allure wood wheedle frighten give fairy 
4,"""No,"" said Jack; ""I will not.""",say 
5,"""She sold us to the brown people,"" continued the parrot. ""Mind you do not buy anything of her, for your money in her palm would act as a charm against you.""",sell brown person continue parrot mind buy money palm act charm 
6,"""She has a baby,"" observed the parrot-wife, scornfully.",have baby observe parrot wife 
7,"""Yes, a baby,"" repeated the old parrot; ""and I hope by means of that baby to get her driven away, and perhaps get free myself. I shall try to put her in a passion. Here she comes.""",baby repeat old parrot hope means baby get drive get free try put passion come 
8,"There she was indeed, almost close at hand. She had a little cart; her goods were hung all about it, and a small horse drew it slowly on, and stopped when she got a customer.",close hand have little cart goods hang small horse draw stop get customer 
9,"Several gypsy children were with her, and as the people came running together over the grass to see her goods, she sang a curious kind of song, which made them wish to buy them.",several gypsy child person come run grass see goods sing curious kind song make wish buy 
10,"Jack turned from the parrot's cage as she came up. He had heard her singing a little way off, and now, before she began again, he felt that already her searching eyes had found him out, and taken notice that he was different from the other people.",turn parrot cage come hear sing little way begin feel searching eye find take notice different other person 
11,"When she began to sing her selling song, he felt a most curious sensation. He felt as if there were some cobwebs before his face, and he put up his hand as if to clear them away. There were no real cobwebs, of course; and yet he again felt as if they floated from the gypsy woman to him, like gossamer threads, and attracted him towards her. So he gazed at her, and she at him, till Jack began to forget how the parrot had warned him.",begin sing sell song feel curious sensation feel be cobweb face put hand clear be real cobweb course feel float gypsy woman gossamer thread attract gaze begin forget parrot warn 
12,"He saw her baby too, wondered whether it was heavy for her to carry, and wished he could help her. I mean, he saw that she had a baby on her arm. It was wrapped in a shawl, and had a handkerchief over its face. She seemed very fond of it, for she kept hushing it; and Jack softly moved nearer and nearer to the cart, till the gypsy woman smiled, and suddenly began to sing,--",see baby wonder heavy carry wish help mean see have baby arm wrap shawl have handkerchief face seem fond keep hush move cart gypsy woman smile begin sing 
13,"  My good man--he's an old, old man     And my good man got a fall,   To buy me a bargain so fast he ran     When he heard the gypsies call:         ""Buy, buy brushes,         Baskets wrought o' rushes.         Buy them, buy them, take them, try them,               Buy, dames all.""",good man old old man good man get fall buy bargain run hear gypsie call buy buy brush basket wring rushe buy buy take try buy dame 
14,"  My old man, he has money and land,     And a young, young wife am I.   Let him put the penny in my white hand     When he hears the gypsies cry:         ""Buy, buy laces,         Veils to screen your faces.         Buy them, buy them, take and try them.               Buy, maids, buy.""",old man have money land young young wife let put penny white hand hear gypsie cry buy buy lace veil screen face buy buy take try buy maid buy 
15,"When the gypsy had finished her song, Jack felt as if he was covered all over with cobwebs; but he could not move away, and he did not mind them now. All his wish was to please her, and get close to her; so when she said, in a soft, wheedling voice, ""What will you please to buy, my pretty gentleman?"" he was just going to answer that he would buy anything she recommended, when, to his astonishment and displeasure, for he thought it very rude, the parrot suddenly burst into a violent fit of coughing, which made all the customers stare. ""That's to clear my throat,"" he said, in a most impertinent tone of voice; and then he began to beat time with his foot, and sing, or rather scream out, an extremely saucy imitation of the gypsy's song, and all his parrot friends in the other cages joined in the chorus.",gypsy finish song feel cover cobweb move mind wish please get close say soft wheedling voice buy pretty gentleman go answer buy recommend astonishment displeasure think rude parrot burst violent fit cough make customer stare clear throat say impertinent tone voice begin beat time foot sing scream saucy imitation gypsy song parrot friend other cage join chorus 
16,"  My fair lady's a dear, dear lady--     I walked by her side to woo.   In a garden alley, so sweet and shady,     She answered, ""I love not you,         John, John Brady,""         Quoth my dear lady,   ""Pray now, pray now, go your way now,         Do, John, do!""",fair lady dear dear lady walk side woo garden alley sweet shady answer love dear lady pray pray go way do do 
17,"At first the gypsy did not seem to know where that mocking song came from, but when she discovered that it was her prisoner, the old parrot, who was thus daring to imitate her, she stood silent and glared at him, and her face was almost white with rage.",first gypsy seem know mocking song come discover prisoner old parrot dare imitate stand silent glare face white rage 
18,"When he came to the end of the verse he pretended to burst into a violent fit of sobbing and crying, and screeched out to his wife, ""Mate! mate! hand up my handkerchief. Oh! oh! it's so affecting, this song is.""",come end verse pretend burst violent fit sobb cry screech wife mate hand handkerchief affect song 
19,"Upon this the other parrot pulled Jack's handkerchief from under her wing, hobbled up, and began, with a great show of zeal, to wipe his horny beak with it. But this was too much for the gypsy; she took a large brush from her cart, and flung it at the cage with all her might.",other parrot pull handkerchief wing hobble begin great show zeal wipe horny beak much gypsy take large brush cart flung cage 
20,"This set it violently swinging backwards and forwards, but did not stop the parrot, who screeched out, ""How delightful it is to be swung!"" And then he began to sing another verse in the most impudent tone possible, and with a voice that seemed to ring through Jack's head, and almost pierce it:--",set swing forward stop parrot screech delightful swing begin sing verse impudent tone possible voice seem ring head pierce 
21,"  Yet my fair lady's my own, own lady,     For I passed another day;   While making her moan, she sat all alone,     And thus and thus did she say:         ""John, John Brady,""         Quoth my dear lady,   ""Do now, do now, once more woo now,         Pray, John, pray!""",fair lady own own lady pass day make moan sit say dear lady do woo pray pray 
22,"""It's beautiful!"" screeched the parrot-wife, ""and so ap-pro-pri-ate."" Jack was delighted when she managed slowly to say this long word with her black tongue, and he burst out laughing. In the mean time a good many of the brown people came running together, attracted by the noise of the parrots and the rage of the gypsy, who flung at his cage, one after the other, all the largest things she had in her cart. But nothing did the parrot any harm; the more violently his cage swung, the louder he sang, till at last the wicked gypsy seized her poor little young baby, who was lying in her arms, rushed frantically at the cage as it flew swiftly through the air towards her, and struck at it with the little creature's head. ""Oh, you cruel, cruel woman!"" cried Jack, and all the small mothers who were standing near with their skinny children on their shoulders, screamed out with terror and indignation; but only for one instant, for the handkerchief flew off that had covered its face, and was caught in the wires of the cage, and all the people saw that it was not a real baby at all, but a bundle of clothes, and its head was a turnip.",beautiful screech parrot wife pro-pri-ate delight manage say long word black tongue burst laugh mean time good many brown person come run attract noise parrot rage gypsy flung cage other large thing have cart do parrot harm cage swing louder sing last wicked gypsy seize poor little young baby lie arm rush cage fly air strike little creature head cruel cruel woman cry small mother stand skinny child shoulder scream terror indignation instant handkerchief fly cover face catch wire cage person see real baby bundle clothes head turnip 
23,"Yes, a turnip! You could see that as plainly as possible, for though the green leaves had been cut off, their stalks were visible through the lace cap that had been tied on it.",turnip see possible green leave cut stalk visible lace cap tie 
24,"Upon this all the crowd pressed closer, throwing her baskets, and brushes, and laces, and beads at the gypsy, and calling out, ""We will have none of your goods, you false woman! Give us back our money, or we will drive you out of the fair. You've stuck a stick into a turnip, and dressed it up in baby clothes. You're a cheat! a cheat!""",crowd press close throw basket brush lace bead gypsy call have goods false woman give money drive fair stick stick turnip dress baby clothes cheat cheat 
25,"""My sweet gentlemen, my kind ladies,"" began the gypsy; but baskets and brushes flew at her so fast that she was obliged to sit down on the grass and hold up the sham baby to screen her face.",sweet gentleman kind lady begin gypsy basket brush fly oblige sit grass hold sham baby screen face 
26,"While this was going on, Jack felt that the cobwebs which had seemed to float about his face were all gone; he did not care at all any more about the gypsy, and began to watch the parrots with great attention.",go feel cobweb seem float face gone care more gypsy begin watch parrot great attention 
27,"He observed that when the handkerchief stuck between the cage wires, the parrots caught it, and drew it inside; and then Jack saw the cunning old bird himself lay it on the floor, fold it crosswise like a shawl, and put it on his wife.",observe handkerchief stick cage wire parrot catch draw see cunning old bird lay floor fold crosswise shawl put wife 
28,"Then she jumped upon the perch, and held it with one foot, looking precisely like an old lady with a parrot's head. Then he folded Jack's handkerchief in the same way, put it on, and got upon the perch beside his wife, screaming out, in his most piercing tone,--",jump perch hold foot look old lady parrot head fold handkerchief same way put get perch wife scream piercing tone 
29,"""I like shawls; they're so becoming.""",like shawl become 
30,"Now the gypsy did not care at all what those inferior people thought of her, and she was calmly counting out their money, to return it; but she was very desirous to make Jack forget her behavior, and had begun to smile again, and tell him she had only been joking, when the parrot spoke, and, looking up, she saw the two birds sitting side by side, and the parrot-wife was screaming in her mate's ear, though neither of them was at all deaf,--",gypsy care inferior person think count money return desirous make forget behavior begin smile tell joke parrot speak look see bird sit side side parrot wife scream mate ear deaf 
31,"""If Jack lets her allure him into the woods, he'll never come out again. She'll hang him up in a cage, as she did us. I say, how does my shawl fit?""",let allure wood come hang cage do say shawl fit 
32,"So saying, the parrot-wife whisked herself round on the perch, and lo! in the corner of the handkerchief were seen some curious letters, marked in red. When the crowd saw these, they drew a little farther off, and glanced at one another with alarm.",say parrot wife whisk perch corner handkerchief see curious letter mark red crowd see draw little glance alarm 
33,"""You look charming, my dear; it fits well!"" screamed the old parrot in answer. ""A word in your ear; 'Share and share alike' is a fine motto.""",look charming dear fit scream old parrot answer word ear share share alike fine motto 
34,"""What do you mean by all this?"" said the gypsy, rising, and going with slow steps to the cage, and speaking cautiously.",mean say gypsy rise go slow step cage speak 
35,"""Jack,"" said the parrot, ""do they ever eat handkerchiefs in your part of the country?""",say parrot eat handkerchief part country 
36,"""No, never,"" answered Jack.",answer 
37,"""Hold your tongue and be reasonable,"" said the gypsy, trembling. ""What do you want? I'll do it, whatever it is.""",hold tongue reasonable say gypsy tremble want do 
38,"""But do they never pick out the marks?"" continued the parrot. ""O Jack! are you sure they never pick out the marks?""",pick mark continue parrot sure pick mark 
39,"""The marks?"" said Jack, considering. ""Yes, perhaps they do.""",mark say consider 
40,"""Stop!"" cried the gypsy, as the old parrot made a peck at the strange letters. ""Oh! you're hurting me. What do you want? I say again, tell me what you want, and you shall have it.""",stop cry gypsy old parrot make peck strange letter hurt want say tell want have 
41,"""We want to get out,"" replied the parrot; ""you must undo the spell.""",want get reply parrot undo spell 
42,"""Then give me my handkerchief,"" answered the gypsy, ""to bandage my eyes. I dare not say the words with my eyes open. You had no business to steal it. It was woven by human hands, so that nobody can see through it; and if you don't give it to me, you'll never get out,--no, never!""",give handkerchief answer gypsy bandage eye say word eye open have business steal wove human hand see give get 
43,"""Then,"" said the old parrot, tossing his shawl off, ""you may have Jack's handkerchief; it will bandage your eyes just as well. It was woven over the water, as yours was.""",say old parrot toss shawl have handkerchief bandage eye wove water 
44,"""It won't do!"" cried the gypsy, in terror; ""give me my own.""",do cry gypsy terror give own 
45,"""I tell you,"" answered the parrot, ""that you shall have Jack's handkerchief; you can do no harm with that.""",tell answer parrot have handkerchief do harm 
46,"By this time the parrots all around had become perfectly silent, and none of the people ventured to say a word, for they feared the malice of the gypsy. She was trembling dreadfully, and her dark eyes, which had been so bright and piercing, had become dull and almost dim; but when she found there was no help for it, she said,--",time parrot become silent person venture say word fear malice gypsy tremble dark eye bright piercing become dull dim find be help say 
47,"""Well, pass out Jack's handkerchief. I will set you free if you will bring out mine with you.""",pass handkerchief set free bring 
48,"""Share and share alike,"" answered the parrot; ""you must let all my friends out too.""",share share answer parrot let friend 
49,"""Then I won't let you out,"" answered the gypsy. ""You shall come out first, and give me my handkerchief, or not one of their cages will I undo. So take your choice.""",let answer gypsy come give handkerchief cage undo take choice 
50,"""My friends, then,"" answered the brave old parrot; and he poked Jack's handkerchief out to her through the wires.",friend answer brave old parrot poke handkerchief wire 
51,"The wondering crowd stood by to look, and the gypsy bandaged her eyes tightly with the handkerchief; and then, stooping low, she began to murmur something and clap her hands--softly at first, but by degrees more and more violently. The noise was meant to drown the words she muttered; but as she went on clapping, the bottom of cage after cage fell clattering down. Out flew the parrots by hundreds, screaming and congratulating one another; and there was such a deafening din that not only the sound of her spell, but the clapping of her hands, was quite lost in it.",wonder crowd stand look gypsy bandage eye handkerchief stoop low begin murmur clap hand first degree noise mean drown word mutter go clap bottom cage cage fall clatter fly parrot hundred scream congratulate be deafening din sound spell clap hand lose 
52,"But all this time Jack was very busy; for the moment the gypsy had tied up her eyes, the old parrot snatched the real handkerchief off his wife's shoulders, and tied it round her neck. Then she pushed out her head through the wires, and the old parrot called to Jack, and said, ""Pull!""",time busy moment gypsy tie eye old parrot snatch real handkerchief wife shoulder tie neck push head wire old parrot call say pull 
53,"Jack took the ends of the handkerchief, pulled terribly hard, and stopped. ""Go on! go on!"" screamed the old parrot.",take end handkerchief pull stop go go scream old parrot 
54,"""I shall pull her head off,"" cried Jack.",pull head cry 
55,"""No matter,"" cried the parrot; ""no matter,--only pull.""",matter cry parrot matter pull 
56,"Well, Jack did pull, and he actually did pull her head off! nearly tumbling backward himself as he did it; but he saw what the whole thing meant then, for there was another head inside,--a fairy's head.",pull pull head tumble do see whole thing mean be head fairy head 
57,"Jack flung down the old parrot's head and great beak, for he saw that what he had to do was to clear the fairy of its parrot covering. The poor little creature seemed nearly dead, it was so terribly squeezed in the wires. It had a green gown or robe on, with an ermine collar; and Jack got hold of this dress, stripped the fairy out of the parrot feathers, and dragged her through,--velvet robe, and crimson girdle, and little yellow shoes. She was very much exhausted, but a kind brown woman took her instantly, and laid her in her bosom. She was a splendid little creature, about half a foot long.",flung old parrot head great beak see have do clear fairy parrot covering poor little creature seem dead squeeze wire have green gown robe ermine collar get hold dress stripp fairy parrot feather drag velvet robe crimson girdle little yellow shoe exhausted kind brown woman take lay bosom splendid little creature foot long 
58,"""There's a brave boy!"" cried the parrot. Jack glanced round, and saw that not all the parrots were free yet, the gypsy was still muttering her spell.",be brave boy cry parrot glance see parrot free gypsy mutter spell 
59,"He returned the handkerchief to the parrot, who put it round his own neck, and again Jack pulled. But oh! what a tough old parrot that was, and how Jack tugged before his cunning head would come off! It did, however, at last; and just as a fine fairy was pulled through, leaving his parrot skin and the handkerchief behind him, the gypsy untied her eyes, and saw what Jack had done.",return handkerchief parrot put own neck pull tough old parrot tug cunning head come last fine fairy pull leave parrot skin handkerchief gypsy unty eye see do 
60,"""Give me my handkerchief!"" she screamed, in despair.",give handkerchief scream despair 
61,"""It's in the cage, gypsy,"" answered Jack; ""you can get it yourself. Say your words again.""",cage gypsy answer get say word 
62,"But the gypsy's spell would only open places where she had confined fairies, and no fairies were in the cage now.",gypsy spell open place have confine fairy fairy cage 
63,"""No, no, no!"" she screamed; ""too late! Hide me! O good people, hide me!""",scream late hide good person hide 
64,"But it was indeed too late. The parrots had been wheeling in the air, hundreds and hundreds of them, high above her head; and as she ceased speaking, she fell shuddering on the ground, drew her cloak over her face, and down they came, swooping in one immense flock, and settled so thickly all over her that she was completely covered; from her shoes to her head not an atom of her was to be seen.",late parrot wheel air hundred hundred high head cease speak fall shudder ground draw cloak face come swoop immense flock settle cover shoe head atom see 
65,"All the people stood gravely looking on. So did Jack, but he could not see much for the fluttering of the parrots, nor hear anything for their screaming voices; but at last he made one of the cross people hear when he shouted to her, ""What are they going to do to the poor gypsy?""",person stand look do see much flutter parrot hear scream voice last make cross person hear shout go do poor gypsy 
66,"""Make her take her other form,"" she replied; ""and then she cannot hurt us while she stays in our country. She is a fairy, as we have just found out, and all fairies have two forms.""",make take other form reply hurt stay country fairy find fairy have form 
67,"""Oh!"" said Jack; but he had no time for more questions.",say have time more question 
68,"The screaming and fighting, and tossing about of little bits of cloth and cotton, ceased; a black lump heaved itself up from the ground among the parrots; and as they flew aside, an ugly great condor, with a bare neck, spread out its wings, and, skimming the ground, sailed slowly away.",scream fighting toss little bit cloth cotton cease black lump heave ground parrot fly ugly great condor bare neck spread wing skimm ground sail 
69,"""They have pecked her so that she can hardly rise,"" exclaimed the parrot fairy. ""Set me on your shoulder, Jack, and let me see the end of it.""",peck rise exclaim parrot fairy set shoulder let see end 
70,"Jack set him there; and his little wife, who had recovered herself, sprang from her friend the brown woman, and sat on the other shoulder. He then ran on,--the tribe of brown people and mushroom people, and the feather-coated folks running too,--after the great black bird, who skimmed slowly on before them till she got to the gypsy carts, when out rushed the gypsies, armed with poles, milking-stools, spades, and everything they could get hold of to beat back the people and the parrots from hunting their relation, who had folded her tired wings, and was skulking under a cart, with ruffled feathers and a scowling eye.",set little wife recover spring friend brown woman sit other shoulder run tribe brown person mushroom person feather coat folk run great black bird skimm get gypsy cart rush gypsie armed pole milk stool spade get hold beat person parrot hunt relation fold tired wing skulk cart ruffle feather scowl eye 
71,"Jack was so frightened at the violent way in which the gypsies and the other tribes were knocking each other about, that he ran off, thinking he had seen enough of such a dangerous country.",frighten violent way gypsie other tribe knock other run think see enough dangerous country 
72,"As he passed the place where that evil-minded gypsy had been changed, he found the ground strewed with little bits of her clothes. Many parrots were picking them up, and poking them into the cage where the handkerchief was; and presently another parrot came with a lighted brand, which she had pulled from one of the gypsies' fires.",pass place evil minded gypsy change find ground strew little bit clothes many parrot pick poke cage handkerchief parrot come light brand pull gypsie fire 
73,"""That's right,"" said the fairy on Jack's shoulder, when he saw his friend push the brand between the wires of what had been his cage, and set the gypsy's handkerchief on fire, and all the bits of her clothes with it. ""She won't find much of herself here,"" he observed, as Jack went on. ""It will not be very easy to put herself together again.""",right say fairy shoulder see friend push brand wire cage set gypsy handkerchief fire bit clothes find much observe go easy put 
74,So Jack moved away. He was tired of the noise and confusion; and the sun was just setting as he reached the little creek where his boat lay.,move tired noise confusion sun set reach little creek boat lay 
75,"Then the parrot fairy and his wife sprang down, and kissed their hands to him as he stepped on board, and pushed the boat off. He saw, when he looked back, that a great fight was still going on; so he was glad to get away, and he wished his two friends good-by, and set off, the old parrot fairly calling after him, ""My relations have put some of our favorite food on board for you."" Then they again thanked him for his good help, and sprang into a tree, and the boat began to go down the wonderful river.",parrot fairy wife spring kiss hand step board push boat see look great fight go glad get wish friend good set old parrot call relation put favorite food board thank good help spring tree boat begin go wonderful river 
76,"""This has been a most extraordinary day,"" thought Jack; ""the strangest day I have had yet."" And after he had eaten a good supper of what the parrots had brought, he felt so tired and sleepy that he laid down in the boat, and presently fell fast asleep. His fairies were sound asleep too in his pockets, and nothing happened of the least consequence; so he slept comfortably till morning.",extraordinary day think strangest day have eat good supper parrot bring feel tired sleepy lay boat fall asleep fairy sound asleep pocket happen least consequence sleep morning
