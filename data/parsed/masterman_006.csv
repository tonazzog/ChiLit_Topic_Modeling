1,CHAPTER 6.,
2,"Mr Seagrave and William went down below into the cabin, where they found that there was plenty of employment; the steward had brought a basin of very hot pea-soup for the children.  Tommy, who was sitting up in the bed-place with his sister, had snatched it out of Juno's left hand, for she held the baby with the other, and in so doing, had thrown it over Caroline, who was screaming, while Juno, in her hurry to assist Caroline, had slipped down on the deck with the baby, who was also crying with fright, although not hurt.  Unfortunately, Juno had fallen down upon Vixen the terrier, who in return had bitten her in the leg, which had made Juno also cry out; while Mrs Seagrave was hanging her head out of her standing bed-place, frightened out of her wits at the accident, but unable to be of any assistance.  Fortunately, Mr Seagrave came down just in time to pick up Juno and the baby, and then tried to comfort little Caroline, who after all was not much scalded, as the soup had had time to cool.",go cabin find be plenty employment steward bring basin hot pea-soup child sit bed place sister snatch left hand hold baby other do throw scream hurry assist slip deck baby cry fright hurt fall terrier return bit leg make cry hang head standing bed place frighten wit accident unable assistance come time pick baby try comfort little scald soup have time cool

4,"In the meantime, they were not idle upon deck; the carpenter was busy fixing a step for one of the spare topmasts instead of a mainmast, and the men were fitting the rigging; the ship unfortunately had sprung a leak, and four hands at the pumps interfered very much with their task. As Ready had prophesied, before night the gale blew, the sea rose again with the gale, and the leaking of the vessel increased so much, that all other labour was suspended for that at the pump.  For two more days did the storm continue, during which time the crew were worn out with fatigue--they could pump no longer: the ship, as she rolled, proved that she had a great deal of water in her hold--when, melancholy as were their prospects already, a new disaster took place, which was attended with most serious results.  Captain Osborn was on the forecastle giving some orders to the men, when the strap of the block which hoisted up the main-topgallant yard on the stump of the foremast gave way, the yard and sail came down on the deck, and struck him senseless.  As long as Captain Osborn commanded them, the sailors had so high an opinion of his abilities as a seaman, and were so encouraged by his cheerful disposition, that they performed their work well and cheerfully; but now that he was, if not killed, at all events senseless and incapable of action, they no longer felt themselves under control.  Mackintosh was too much disliked by the seamen to allow his words to have any weight with them.  They were regardless of his injunctions or requests, and they now consulted among themselves.",meantime idle deck carpenter busy fix step spare topmast mainmast man fit rigging ship spring leak hand pump interfer task ready prophesy night gale blow sea rise gale leak vessel increase other labour suspend pump more day storm continue time crew wear fatigue pump ship roll prove have great deal water hold melancholy prospect new disaster take place attend serious result forecastle give order man strap block hoist main topgallant yard stump foremast give way yard sail come deck strike senseless command sailor have high opinion ability seaman encourage cheerful disposition perform work kill event senseless incapable action feel control dislike seamen allow word have weight injunction request consult 
5,"""The gale is broke, my men, and we shall have fine weather now,"" observed Ready, going up to the sailors on the forecastle.  ""The wind is going down fast.""",gale broke man have fine weather observe ready go sailor forecastle wind go 
6,"""Yes,"" replied one of the men, ""and the ship is going down fast, that's quite as certain.""",reply man ship go certain 
7,"""A good spell at the pumps would do us some good now,"" replied Ready. ""What d'ye say, my lads?""",good spell pump do good reply ready say lad 
8,"""A glass of grog or two would do us more,"" replied the seaman.  ""What d'ye say, my boys?  I don't think that the captain would refuse us, poor fellow, if he could speak.""",glass grog do reply seaman say boy think captain refuse poor fellow speak

10,"""Why not?"" observed another of the men; ""the ship must go down soon.""",observe man ship go 
11,"""Perhaps she may--I will not deny it,"" said Mackintosh; ""but that is no reason why we should not be saved: now, if you get drunk, there is no chance of any one being saved, and my life is precious to me.  I'm ready to join with you in anything you please, and you may decide what is to be done; but get drunk you shall not, if I can help it, that's certain.""",deny say reason save get drunk be chance one save life precious ready join decide do get drunk help certain 
12,"""And how can you help it?"" replied one of the seamen, surlily.",help reply seamen 
13,"""Because two resolute men can do a great deal--I may say three, for in this instance Ready will be of my side, and I can call to my assistance the cabin passenger--recollect the firearms are all in the cabin.  But why should we quarrel?--Say at once what you intend to do; and if you have not made up your minds, will you listen to what I propose?""",resolute man do great deal say instance ready side call assistance cabin passenger recollect firearm cabin quarrel say intend do make mind listen propose 
14,"As Mackintosh's courage and determination were well known, the seamen again consulted together, and then asked him what he proposed.",courage determination know seamen consult ask propose 
15,"""We have one good boat left, the new yawl at the booms: the others, as you know, are washed away, with the exception of the little boat astern, which is useless, as she is knocked almost to pieces.  Now we cannot be very far from some of the islands, indeed I think we are among them now. Let us fit out the boat with everything we require, go about our work steadily and quietly, drink as much grog as will not hurt us, and take a good provision of it with us.  The boat is complete with her masts, sails, and oars; and it's very hard if we do not save ourselves somewhere.  Ready, do I give good advice or not?""",have good boat leave new yawl boom other know wash exception little boat astern useless knock piece island think let fit boat require go work drink much grog hurt take good provision boat complete mast sail oar hard save ready give good advice

20,"""Very sorry for them,"" replied the former spokesman; ""but we shall have enough to do to save our own lives.""",sorry reply former spokesman have enough do save own life 
21,"""Well, my lads, I agree with you,"" said Mackintosh.  ""Charity begins at home.  What do you say?--shall it be so?""",lad agree say begin home say 
22,"""Yes,"" replied the seamen, unanimously; and Ready knew that it was in vain to expostulate.  They now set about preparing the boat, and providing for their wants.  Biscuits, salt pork, two or three small casks of water, and a barrel of rum were collected at the gangway; Mackintosh brought up his quadrant and a compass, some muskets, powder and shot; the carpenter, with the assistance of another man, cut away the ship's bulwarks down to the gunnel, so as to enable them to launch the boat overboard, for they could not, of course, hoist her out now that the masts were gone.  In an hour everything was prepared.  A long rope was made fast to the boat, which was brought to the gunnel ready for launching overboard, and the ship's broadside was brought to the wind.  As this was done, Mr Seagrave came on deck and looked around him.",reply seamen ready know vain expostulate set prepare boat provide want biscuit salt pork small cask water barrel rum collect gangway bring quadrant compass musket powder shot carpenter assistance man cut ship bulwark gunnel enable launch boat course hoist mast gone hour prepare long rope make boat bring gunnel ready launch ship broadside bring wind do come deck look 
23,"He perceived the boat ready for launching, the provisions and water at the gangway, the ship brought to the wind, and rolling slowly to the heave of the sea; at last he saw Ready sitting down by Captain Osborn, who was apparently dead.  ""What is all this, Ready?"" inquired Seagrave. ""Are they going to leave the ship? have they killed Captain Osborn?""",perceive boat ready launch provision water gangway ship bring wind roll heave sea last see ready sit dead ready inquire go leave ship kill 
24,"""No, sir,--not quite so bad as that.  Poor Captain Osborn was struck down by the fall of the yard, and has been insensible ever since; but, as to the other matter, I fear that is decided: you see they are launching the boat.""",sir bad poor strike fall yard insensible other matter fear decide see launch boat

27,"""What! leave us here to perish!  Merciful Heaven! how cruel--how barbarous!""",leave perish merciful heaven cruel barbarous 
28,"""It is not kind, Mr Seagrave, but still you see it is the law of nature.  When it is a question of life, it is every one for himself, for life is sweet: they are not more unkind than they would be to each other, if there were too many for the boat to hold.  I've seen all this before in my time,"" replied Ready, gravely.",kind see law nature question life one life sweet unkind other be many boat hold see time reply ready 
29,"""My wife! my children!"" cried Mr Seagrave, covering his face with his hands.  ""But I will speak to them,"" continued he after a pause; ""surely they will listen to the dictates of humanity; at all events Mr Mackintosh will have some power over them.  Don't you think so, Ready?""",wife child cry cover face hand speak continue pause listen dictate humanity event have power think ready 
30,"""Well, Mr Seagrave, if I must speak, I confess to you that there is not a harder heart among them than that of Mr Mackintosh, and it's useless speaking to him or any one of them; and you must not be too severe upon them neither: the boat is small, and could not hold more people with the provisions which they take with them--that is the fact.  If they were to take you and your family into the boat, it might be the cause of all perishing together; if I thought otherwise I would try what I could do to persuade them, but it is useless.""",speak confess be hard heart useless speak one severe boat small hold more person provision take fact take family boat cause perish think try do persuade useless

33,"""We must?  What! do not you go with them?""",go 
34,"""No, Mr Seagrave.  I have been thinking about it this last hour, and I have made up my mind to remain with you.

36,"""As God pleases, Mr Seagrave.  I am an old man, and it is of little consequence.  I care little whether I am taken away a year or two sooner, but I do not like to see blossoms cut off in early spring: I may be of use if I remain, for I've an old head upon my shoulders, and I could not leave you all to perish when you might be saved if you only knew how to act.  But here the seamen come--the boat is all ready, and they will now take poor Captain Osborn with them.""",please old man little consequence care little take year like see blossom cut early spring use remain have old head shoulder leave perish save know act seamen come boat ready take poor

38,"""Never mind me, Williams; I shall stick to the ship,"" replied Ready.  ""I wish you success with all my heart; and, Mr Mackintosh, I have but one promise to exact from you, and I hope you will not refuse me: which is, that if you are saved, you will not forget those you leave here on board, and take measures for their being searched for among the islands.""",mind stick ship reply ready wish success heart have promise exact hope refuse save forget leave board take measure search island

40,"""I shall stay here, Mr Mackintosh; and I only beg that you will promise me what I ask.

Do you promise me that?""",stay beg promise ask acquaint friend happen likely find save promise
