2,"Everything was now preparing for their removal to the leeward side of the island.  Ready had nearly completed the boat; he had given it a thorough repair, and fitted a mast and sail.  William and Mr Seagrave continued to collect and secure the various articles thrown on shore, particularly such as would be injured by their exposure to the weather: these they rolled or carried into the cocoa-nut grove, so as to be sheltered from the sun; but there were so many things thrown on shore day after day, that they hardly knew what they had: but they secured case and cask one after another, waiting for a better opportunity to examine their contents.  At last they collected a great many articles together, and, with their shovels, covered them over with sand, it being impossible to get them from the beach without more time than they could spare.",prepare removal leeward side island ready complete boat give thorough repair fit mast sail continue collect secure various article throw shore such injure exposure weather roll carry cocoa nut grove shelter sun be many thing throw shore day day know have secure case cask wait good opportunity examine content last collect great many article shovel cover sand impossible get beach more time spare 
3,"Neither was Mrs Seagrave, who was now getting quite strong, or Juno, idle.  They had made up everything that they could in packages, ready for moving.  On the eighth day after the gale, they were ready, and it was arranged that Ready should put into the boat the bedding and canvas of one tent, and should take William with him on his expedition.  Having transported this safe, he should return for a load of the most necessary articles, and then the family should walk through the grove to the other side of the island, and remain there with Mr Seagrave while Ready and William returned for the other tent; and after that, the boat should make as many trips as the weather would permit, till they had brought all the things absolutely required.  It was a lovely calm morning when Ready and William pushed off in the boat, which was well loaded; and as soon as they were clear of the cove they hoisted the sail, and went away before the wind along the coast.  In two hours they had run to the eastern end of the island, and hauled up close inshore: the point which ran out, and at the end of which there was an inlet, was not a mile from them, and in a very short time they had lowered the sail, and were pulling in for the sandy beach.",get strong idle make package ready move eighth day gale ready arrange ready put boat bedding canvas tent take expedition transport safe return load necessary article family walk grove other side island remain ready return other tent boat make many trip weather permit bring thing require lovely calm morning ready push boat load clear cove hoist sail go wind coast hour run eastern end island haul close point run end be inlet mile short time lower sail pull sandy beach

5,"""Indeed it is.  How many miles do you think it is from the cove to this part of the island?""",many mile think cove part island 
6,"""About six or seven, not more: the island, you see, is long and narrow. Now let us get the things out and carry them up, and then we will be back to the cove long before dark.""",more island see long narrow let get thing carry cove dark 
7,"The boat was soon unloaded, but they had some way to carry up the things.  ""We shall not mind such a gale as we had the other day when our tents are pitched here, William,"" said Ready, ""for we shall be protected by the whole width of the cocoa-nut grove.  We shall hardly feel the wind, although we shall the rain, for that will come down in torrents.""",boat unload have way carry thing mind gale have other day tent pitch say ready protect whole width cocoa nut grove feel wind rain come torrent 
8,"""I must go and see how our spring gets on,"" said William, ""and get a drink from it.""",go see spring get say get drink 
9,"Willy reported the spring to be up to the brim with water, and that he had never drunk water so excellent.  They then pushed off the boat, and, after rowing for about two hours or more, found themselves at the entrance of the cove, and Mrs Seagrave, with Tommy by her side, waving her handkerchief to them.",report spring brim water drink water excellent push boat row hour more find entrance cove side wave handkerchief 
10,"They very soon pulled in to the beach, and, landing, received the congratulations of the whole party at their first successful voyage, and all expressed their delight at its having proved so much shorter than had been anticipated.",pull beach land receive congratulation whole party first successful voyage express delight prove short anticipate

15,"""You must be almost tired of eating nothing but salt meat and biscuit, ma'am,"" said Ready, as they sat down to their meal; ""but when we are all safe on the other side of the island we hope to feed you better.  At present it is hard work and hard fare.""",tired eat salt meat biscuit ma'am say ready sit meal safe other side island hope feed good present hard work hard fare 
16,"""As long as the children are well, I care very little about it; but I must say that, after the last gale, I am as anxious as you to be on the other side of the island, especially after the account William has given me of it.  It must be a paradise!  When do we set off?""",child well care little say last gale anxious other side island account give paradise set 
17,"""Not till the day after to-morrow, ma'am, I should think; for you see I must have another trip for the cooking utensils and the bundles which you have made up.  If you will spare Juno to walk through the wood with William to-morrow, we will then have the tent ready for you and the children.""",day think see have trip cooking utensil bundle make spare walk wood have tent ready child
