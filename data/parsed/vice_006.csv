6,"""I should be most happy to meditate, sir,"" protested Paul, lowering his chair on discovering that there was no immediate danger, ""if that--that bloodthirsty young ruffian there would allow me to do so. I am going about in bodily fear of him, Dr. Grimstone. I want him bound over to keep the peace. I decline to be left alone with him--he's not safe!""",happy meditate sir protest lower chair discover be immediate danger bloodthirsty young ruffian allow do go bodily fear want bind keep peace decline leave alone safe

Are you mean and base enough to take this cowardly revenge on a boy who has had the moral courage to expose your deceit--for your ultimate good--a boy who is unable to defend himself against you?""",mean base take cowardly revenge boy have moral courage expose deceit ultimate good boy unable defend 
8,"""He can fight when he chooses, sir,"" said Coggs; ""he blacked my eye last term, sir!""",fight choose sir say black eye last term sir 
9,"""I assure you,"" said Paul, with the convincing earnestness of truth, ""that I never blacked anybody's eye in the whole course of my life. I am not--ah--a pugnacious man. My age, and--hum--my position, ought to protect me from these scandals----""",assure say convincing earnestness truth black eye whole course life pugnacious man age hum position protect scandal 
10,"""You've come back this year, sir,"" said Dr. Grimstone, ""with a very odd way of talking of yourself--an exceedingly odd way. Unless I see you abandoning it, and behaving like a reasonable boy again, I shall be forced to conclude you intend some disrespect and open defiance by it.""",come year sir say odd way talk odd way see abandon behave reasonable boy force conclude intend disrespect open defiance 
11,"""If you would allow me an opportunity of explaining my position, sir,"" said Paul, ""I would undertake to clear your mind directly of such a monstrous idea. I am trying to assert my rights, Dr. Grimstone--my rights as a citizen, as a householder! This is no place for me, and I appeal to you to set me free. If you only knew one tenth----""",allow opportunity explain position sir say undertake clear mind monstrous idea try assert right right citizen householder place appeal set free know tenth 
12,"""Let us understand one another, Bultitude,"" interrupted the Doctor. ""You may think it an excellent joke to talk nonsense to me like this. But let me tell you there is a point where a jest becomes an insult. I've spared you hitherto out of consideration for the feelings of your excellent father, who is so anxious that you should become an object of pride and credit to him; but if you dare to treat me to any more of this bombast about 'explaining your rights,' you will force me to exercise one of mine--the right to inflict corporal punishment, sir--which you have just seen in operation upon another.""",let understand interrupt think excellent joke talk nonsense let tell be point jest become insult spare consideration feeling excellent father anxious become object pride credit dare treat more bombast explain right force exercise right inflict corporal punishment sir see operation 
13,"""Oh!"" said Mr. Bultitude faintly, feeling utterly crestfallen--and he could say nothing more.",say feel crestfallen say more 
14,"""As for those illicit luxuries in your playbox,"" continued the Doctor, ""the fact that you brought the box up as it was is in your favour; and I am inclined on reflection to overlook the affair, if you can assure me that you were no party to their being put there?""",illicit luxury playbox continue fact bring box favour inclined reflection overlook affair assure party put

I objected to have the kitchen and housekeeper's room ransacked to make a set of rascally boys ill for a fortnight at my expense!""",contrary say give strictest order be be such useless extravagance object have kitchen housekeeper room ransack make set rascally boy ill fortnight expense 
16,"The Doctor stared slightly at this creditable but unnatural view of the subject. However, as he could not quarrel with the sentiment, he let the manner of expressing it pass unrebuked for the present, and, after sentencing Coggs to two days' detention and the copying of innumerable French verbs, he sent the ill-matched pair down to the schoolroom to join their respective classes.",stare creditable unnatural view subject quarrel sentiment let manner express pass unrebuke present sentencing day detention copying innumerable french verb send ill match pair schoolroom join respective class 
17,"Paul went resignedly downstairs and into the room, where he found Mr. Blinkhorn at the head of one of the long tables, taking a class of about a dozen boys.",go room find head long table take class boy 
18,"""Take your Livy and Latin Primer, Bultitude,"" said Mr. Blinkhorn mildly, ""and sit down.""",take latin say sit 
19,"Mr. Blinkhorn was a tall angular man, with a long neck and slightly drooping head. He had thin wiry brown hair, and a plain face, with shortsighted kind brown eyes. In character he was mild and reserved, too conscientious to allow himself the luxury of either favourites or aversions among the boys, all of whom in his secret soul he probably disliked about equally, though he neither said nor did anything to show it.",tall angular man long neck droop head have thin wiry brown hair plain face shortsighted kind brown eye character mild reserve conscientious allow luxury favourite aversion boy secret soul dislike say do show 
20,"Paul took a book--any book, for he did not know or care to know one from another--and sat down at the end furthest from the master, inwardly rebelling at having education thus forced upon him at his advanced years, but seeing no escape.",take book book know care know sit end master rebel have education force advanced year see escape 
21,"""At dinner time,"" he resolved desperately, ""I will insist on speaking out, but just now it is simply prudent to humour them.""",dinner time resolve insist speak prudent humour 
22,"The rest of the class drew away from him with marked coldness and occasionally saluted him (when Mr. Blinkhorn's attention was called away) with terms and grimaces which Paul, although he failed thoroughly to understand them, felt instinctively were not intended as compliments.",rest class draw mark coldness salute attention call term grimace fail understand feel intend compliment 
23,"Mr. Blinkhorn's notions of discipline were qualified by a sportsmanlike instinct which forbade him to harass a boy already in trouble, as he understood young Bultitude had been, and so he forbore from pressing him to take any share in the class work.",notion discipline qualify sportsmanlike instinct forbid harass boy trouble understand young forbore press take share class work 
24,"Mr. Bultitude therefore was saved from any necessity of betraying his total ignorance of his author, and sat gloomily on the hard form, impatiently watching the minute-hand skulk round the mean dull face of the clock above the chimney-piece, while around him one boy after another droned out a listless translation of the work before him, interrupted by mild corrections and comments from the master.",save necessity betray total ignorance author sit hard form watch minute hand skulk mean dull face clock chimney piece boy dron listless translation work interrupt mild correction comment master 
25,"What a preposterous change from all his ordinary habits! At this very time, only twenty-four hours since, he was stepping slowly and majestically towards his accustomed omnibus, which was waiting with deference for him to overtake it; he was taking his seat, saluted respectfully by the conductor and cheerily by his fellow-passengers, as a man of recognised mark and position.",preposterous change ordinary habit very time hour step accustom omnibus wait deference overtake take seat salute conductor fellow passenger man recognise mark position 
26,"Now that omnibus would halt at the corner of Westbourne Terrace in vain, and go on its way Bankwards without him. He was many miles away--in the very last place where anyone would be likely to look for him, occupying the post of ""whipping-boy"" to his miserable son!",omnibus halt corner vain go way many mile last place likely look occupy post whipping boy miserable son 
27,Was ever an inoffensive and respectable gentleman placed in a more false and ridiculous position?,inoffensive respectable gentleman place false ridiculous position 
28,"If he had only kept his drawer locked, and hidden the abominable Garudâ Stone away from Dick's prying eyes; if he had let the moralising alone; if Boaler had not been so long fetching that cab, or if he had not happened to faint at the critical moment--what an immense difference any one of these apparent trifles would have made.",keep drawer lock hide abominable pry eye let moralising fetch cab happen faint critical moment immense difference one apparent trifle make 
29,"And now what was he to do to get out of this incongruous and distasteful place? It was all very well to say that he had only to insist upon a hearing from the Doctor, but what if, as he had very grave reason to fear, the Doctor should absolutely refuse to listen, should even proceed to carry out his horrible threat? Must he remain there till the holidays came to release him? Suppose Dick--as he certainly would unless he was quite a fool--declined to receive him during the holidays? It was absolutely necessary to return home at once; every additional hour he passed in imprisonment made it harder to regain his lost self.",do get incongruous distasteful place say have insist hearing have grave reason fear refuse listen proceed carry horrible threat remain holiday come release suppose fool decline receive holiday necessary return additional hour pass imprisonment make hard regain lose self 
30,"Now and then he roused himself from all these gloomy thoughts to observe his companions. The boys at the upper end, near Mr. Blinkhorn, were fairly attentive, and he noticed one small smug-faced boy about half-way up, who, while a class-mate was faltering and blundering over some question, would cry ""I know, sir. Let me tell him. Ask me, sir!"" in a restless agony of superior information.",rouse gloomy thought observe companion boy upper end attentive notice small smug face boy half way class mate falter blunder question cry know sir let tell ask sir restless agony superior information 
31,"Down by Paul, however, the discipline was relaxed enough, as perhaps could only be expected on the first day of term. One wild-eyed long-haired boy had brought out a small china figure with which, and the assistance of his right hand draped in a pocket handkerchief, and wielding a penholder, he was busy enacting a drama based on the lines of Punch and Judy, to the breathless amusement of his neighbours.",discipline relaxed expect first day term wild eyed long haired boy bring small china figure assistance right hand drape pocket handkerchief wield penholder busy enact drama base line breathless amusement neighbour 
32,"Mr. Bultitude might have hoped to escape notice by a policy of judicious self-effacement, but unhappily his long, blank, uninterested face was held by his companions to bear an implied reproach; and being delicately sensitive on this point, they kicked his legs viciously, which made him extremely glad when dinnertime came, although he felt too faint and bilious to be tempted by anything but the lightest and daintiest luncheon.",hope escape notice policy judicious self effacement long blank uninterested face hold companion bear imply reproach sensitive point kick leg make glad dinnertime come feel faint bilious tempt light daintiest luncheon 
33,"But at dinner he found, with a shudder, that he was expected to swallow a thick ragged section of boiled mutton which had been carved and helped so long before he sat down to it, that the stagnant gravy was chilled and congealed into patches of greasy white. He managed to swallow it with many pauses of invincible disgust--only to find it replaced by a solid slab of pale brown suet pudding, sparsely bedewed with unctuous black treacle.",dinner find shudder expect swallow thick ragged section boil mutton carve help sit stagnant gravy chill congeal patch greasy white manage swallow many pause invincible disgust find replace solid slab pale brown suet pudding bedew unctuous black treacle 
34,"This, though a plentiful, and by no means unwholesome fare for growing boys, was not what he had been accustomed to, and feeling far too heavy and unwell after it to venture upon an encounter with the Doctor, he wandered slow and melancholy round the bare gravelled playground during the half-hour after dinner devoted to the inevitable ""chevy,"" until the Doctor appeared at the head of the staircase.",plentiful means unwholesome fare grow boy accustom feel heavy unwell venture encounter wander slow melancholy bare gravell playground half hour dinner devote inevitable chevy appear head staircase 
35,"It is always sad for the historian to have to record a departure from principle, and I have to confess with shame on Mr. Bultitude's account that, feeling the Doctor's eye upon him, and striving to propitiate him, he humiliated himself so far as to run about with an elaborate affection of zest, and his exertions were rewarded by hearing himself cordially encouraged to further efforts.",sad historian have record departure principle have confess shame account feel eye striving propitiate humiliate run elaborate affection zest exertion reward hear encourage further effort 
36,"It cheered and emboldened him. ""I've put him in a good temper,"" he told himself; ""if I can only keep him in one till the evening, I really think I might be able to go up and tell him what a ridiculous mess I've got into. Why should I care, after all? At least I've done nothing to be ashamed of. It's an accident that might have happened to any man!""",cheer embolden put good temper tell keep evening think able go tell ridiculous mess get care least do ashamed accident happen man 
37,"It is a curious and unpleasant thing that, however reassuring and convincing the arguments may be with which we succeed in bracing ourselves to meet or disregard unpleasantness, the force of those arguments seldom or never outlasts the frame of mind in which they are composed, and when the unpleasantness is at hand, there we are, just as unreasonably alarmed at it as ever.",curious unpleasant thing reassuring convincing argument succeed brace meet disregard unpleasantness force argument outlast frame mind compose unpleasantness hand alarmed 
38,"Mr. Bultitude's confidence faded away almost as soon as he found himself in the schoolroom again. He found himself assigned to a class at one end of the room, where Mr. Tinkler presently introduced a new rule in Algebra to them, in such a manner as to procure for it a lasting unpopularity with all those who were not too much engaged in drawing duels and railway trains upon their slates to attend.",confidence fade find schoolroom find assign class end room introduce new rule manner procure last unpopularity engage draw duel railway train slate attend 
39,"Although Paul did not draw upon his slate, his utter ignorance of Algebra prevented him from being much edified by the cabalistic signs on the blackboard, which Mr. Tinkler seemed to chalk up dubiously, and rub out again as soon as possible, with an air of being ashamed of them. So he tried to nerve himself for the coming ordeal by furtively watching and studying the Doctor, who was taking a Xenophon class at the upper end of the room, and, being in fairly good humour, was combining instruction with amusement in a manner peculiarly his own.",draw slate utter ignorance prevent edify cabalistic sign blackboard seem chalk rub possible air ashamed try nerve come ordeal watch study take class upper end room good humour combine instruction amusement manner own 
40,He stopped the construing occasionally to illustrate some word or passage by an anecdote; he condescended to enliven the translation here and there by a familiar and colloquial paraphrase; he magnanimously refrained from pressing any obviously inconvenient questions; and his manner generally was marked by a geniality which was additionally piquant from its extreme uncertainty.,stop construing illustrate word passage anecdote condescend enlive translation familiar colloquial paraphrase refrain press inconvenient question manner mark geniality piquant extreme uncertainty 
41,"Mr. Bultitude could not help thinking it a rather ghastly form of gaiety, but he hoped it might last.",help think ghastly form gaiety hope last 
42,"Presently, however, some one brought him a blue envelope on a tray. He read it, and a frown gathered on his face. The boy who was translating at the time went on again in his former slipshod manner (which had hitherto provoked only jovial criticism and correction) with complete self-complacency, but found himself sternly brought to book, and burdened by a heavy imposition, before he quite realised that his blunders had ceased to amuse.",one bring blue envelope tray read frown gather face boy translate time go former slipshod manner provoke jovial criticism correction complete self complacency find bring book burden heavy imposition realise blunder cease amuse 
43,"Then began a season of sore trial and tribulation for the class. The Doctor suddenly withdrew the light of his countenance from them, and sunshine was succeeded by blackest thunderclouds. The wind was no longer tempered to the more closely shorn of the flock; the weakest vessels were put on unexpectedly at crucial passages, and, coming hopelessly to grief, were denounced as impostors and idlers, till half the class was dissolved in tears.",begin season sore trial tribulation class withdraw light countenance sunshine succeed blackest thundercloud wind temper shorn flock weak vessel put crucial passage come grief denounce impostor idler class dissolve tear 
44,"A few of the better grounded stood the fire, like a remnant of the Old Guard. With faces pale from alarm, and trembling voices, but perfect accuracy, they answered all the Doctor's searching inquiries after the paradigms of Greek verbs that seemed irregular to the verge of impropriety.",few good ground stand fire remnant old face pale alarm tremble voice perfect accuracy answer searching inquiry paradigm greek verb seem irregular verge impropriety 
45,"Paul saw it all with renewed misgiving. ""If I were there,"" he thought, ""I should have been run out and flogged long ago! How angry those stupid young idiots are making him! How can I go up and speak to him when he's like that? And yet I must. I'm sitting on dynamite as it is. The very first time they want me to answer any questions from some of their books, I shall be ruined! Why wasn't I better educated when I was a boy, or why didn't I make a better use of my opportunities! It will be a bitter thing if they thrash me for not knowing as much as Dick. Grimstone's coming this way now; it's all over with me!""",see renew misgiving think run flogge angry stupid young idiot make go speak sit dynamite first time want answer question book ruin educate boy make good use opportunity bitter thing thrash know much come way 
46,"The Greek class had managed to repel the enemy, with some loss to themselves, and the Doctor now left his place for a moment, and came down towards the bench on which Paul sat trembling.",greek class manage repel enemy loss leave place moment come bench sit tremble 
47,"The storm, however, had passed over for the present, and he only said with restored calmness, ""Who were the boys who learnt dancing last term?""",storm pass present say restore calmness boy learn dancing last term 
48,"One or two of them said they had done so, and Dr. Grimstone continued: ""Mr. Burdekin was unable to give you the last lesson of his course last term, and has arranged to take you to-day, as he will be in the neighbourhood. So be off at once to Mrs. Grimstone and change your shoes. Bultitude, you learnt last term, too. Go with the others.""",say do continue unable give last lesson course last term arrange take day neighbourhood change shoe bultitude learn last term go other 
49,"Mr. Bultitude was too overcome by this unexpected attack to contradict it, though of course he was quite able to do so; but then, if he had, he must have explained all, and he felt strongly that just then was neither the time nor the place for particulars.",overcome unexpected attack contradict course able do have explain feel time place particular 
50,"It would have been wiser perhaps, it would certainly have brought matters to a crisis, if he could have forced himself to tell everything--the whole truth in all its outrageous improbability--but he could not.",wise bring matter crisis force tell whole truth outrageous improbability 
51,"Let those who feel inclined to blame him for lack of firmness consider how difficult and delicate a business it must almost of necessity be for anyone to declare openly, in the teeth of common sense and plain facts, that there has been a mistake, and, in point of fact, he is not his own son, but his own father.",let feel inclined blame lack firmness consider difficult delicate business necessity declare tooth common sense plain fact be mistake point fact own son own father

53,"And so he followed the rest into a sort of cloak-room, where the tall hats which the boys wore on Sundays were all kept on shelves in white bandboxes; and there his hair was brushed, his feet were thrust into very shiny patent leather shoes, and a pair of kid gloves was given out to him to put on.",follow rest sort cloak room tall hat boy wear keep shelf white bandboxe hair brush foot thrust shiny patent leather shoe pair kid glove give put 
54,"The dancing lesson was to be held in the ""Dining Hall,"" from which the savour of mutton had not altogether departed. When Paul came in he found the floor cleared and the tables and forms piled up on one side of the room.",dancing lesson hold savour mutton depart come find floor clear table form pile side room 
55,"Biddlecomb and Tipping and some of the smaller boys were there already, their gloves and shiny shoes giving them a feeling of ceremony and constraint which they tried to carry off by an uncouth parody of politeness.",small boy glove shiny shoe give feeling ceremony constraint try carry uncouth parody politeness

57,"There was a rustle of dresses down the stairs outside, and two thin little girls, looking excessively proper and prim, came in with an elderly gentlewoman who was their governess and wore a _pince-nez_ to impart the necessary suggestion of a superior intellect. They were the Miss Mutlows, sisters of one of the day-boarders, and attended the course by special favour as friends of Dulcie's, who followed them in with a little gleam of shy anticipation in her eyes.",be rustle dress stair thin little girl look proper prim come elderly gentlewoman governess wear _pince nez_ impart necessary suggestion superior intellect miss sister day border attend course special favour friend follow little gleam shy anticipation eye 
58,"The Miss Mutlows sat stiffly down on a form, one on each side of her governess, and all three stared solemnly at the boys, who began to blush vividly under the inspection, to unbutton and rebutton their gloves with great care, and to shift from leg to leg in an embarrassed manner.",sit form side governess stare boy begin blush inspection unbutt rebutt glove great care shift leg leg embarrassed manner 
59,"Dulcie soon singled out poor Mr. Bultitude, who, mindful of Tipping's warning, was doing his very best to avoid her.",single poor mindful warning do good avoid

61,"Mr. Bultitude had borne a good deal already, and, not being remarkably sweet-natured, he shook the little hand away, half petulant and half alarmed. ""I do wish you wouldn't do this sort of thing in public. You'll compromise me, you know!"" he said nervously.",borne good deal sweet natured shake little hand half petulant half alarm wish do sort thing public compromise know say

63,"""You didn't mind it once,"" she said. ""I thought you might want to dance with me. You liked to last term. But I'm sure I don't care if you choose to be disagreeable. Go and dance with Mary Mutlow if you want to, though you did say she danced like a pair of compasses, and I shall tell her you said so, too. And you know you're not a good dancer yourself. _Are_ you going to dance with Mary?""",mind say think want dance like last term sure care choose disagreeable go dance want say dance pair compass tell say know good dancer go dance

65,"Dulcie's eyes flashed. ""You're a nasty sulky boy,"" she said in an angry undertone (all the conversation had, of course, been carried on in whispers). ""I'll never speak to you or look at you again. You're the most horrid boy in the school--and the ugliest!""",eye flash nasty sulky boy say angry undertone conversation course carry whisper speak look horrid boy school ugliest

67,"There was another sound outside, as of fiddlestrings being twanged by the finger, and, as the boys hastily formed up in two lines down the centre of the room and the Miss Mutlows and Dulcie prepared themselves for the curtsey of state, there came in a little fat man, with mutton-chop whiskers and a white face, upon which was written an unalterable conviction that his manner and deportment were perfection itself.",be sound fiddlestring twange finger boy form line centre room prepare curtsey state come little fat man mutton chop whisker white face write unalterable conviction manner deportment perfection

Mr. Bultitude shuffled along somehow after the rest, with rebellion at his heart and a deep sense of degradation. ""If my clerks were to see me now!"" he thought.",talk time metrical fluency scrape little jig violin lead procession caper room sundry stage conscious awkwardness shuffle rest rebellion heart deep sense degradation clerk see think

78,"After the dance the couples promenaded in a stiff but stately manner round the room to a dirge-like march scraped upon the violin, the boys taking the parts of ladies jibbing away from their partners in a highly unlady-like fashion, and the boy burdened with the companionship of the younger Miss Mutlow walking along in a very agony of bashfulness.",dance couple promenade stiff stately manner room dirge like march scrape violin boy take part lady jibb partner unlady like fashion boy burden companionship young walk very agony bashfulness

90,"Mr. Bultitude, by no means sorry to be freed from the irksome necessity of dancing with a heart ill-attuned for enjoyment, got up on the form and stood looking, sullenly enough, upon the proceedings. The governess glowered at him now and then as a monster of youthful depravity; the Miss Mutlows glanced up at him as they tripped past, with curiosity not unmixed with admiration, but Dulcie steadily avoided looking in his direction.",means sorry free irksome necessity dancing heart ill attune enjoyment get form stand look proceedings governess glower monster youthful depravity glance trip curiosity unmix admiration avoid look direction

92,"He did this occasionally, partly to superintend matters, and partly as an encouraging mark of approbation. He looked round the class at first with benignant toleration, until his glance took in the bench upon which Mr. Bultitude was set up. Then his eye slowly travelled up to the level of Paul's head, his expression changing meanwhile to a petrifying glare.",do superintend matter encourage mark approbation look class first benignant toleration glance take bench set eye travel level head expression change petrifying glare 
93,"It was not, as Paul instinctively felt, exactly the position in which a gentleman who wished to stand well with those in authority over him would prefer to be found. He felt his heart turn to water within him, and stared limp and helpless at the Doctor.",feel position gentleman wish stand authority prefer find feel heart turn water stare limp helpless 
94,"There was an awful silence (Dr. Grimstone was addicted to awful silences; and, indeed, if seldom strictly ""golden,"" silence may often be called ""iron""), but at last he inquired, ""And pray what may you be doing up there, sir?""",be awful silence addicted awful silence golden silence call iron last inquire pray do sir 
95,"""Upon my soul I can't say,"" said Mr. Bultitude feebly. ""Ask that gentleman there with the fiddle--he knows.""",soul say say ask gentleman fiddle know 
96,"Mr. Burdekin was a good-natured, easy-tempered little man, and had already forgotten the affront to his dignity. He was anxious not to get the boy into more trouble.",good natured easy temper little man forget affront dignity anxious get boy more trouble 
97,"""Bultitude was a little inattentive and, I may say, wanting in respect, Dr. Grimstone,"" he said, putting it as mildly as he could with any accuracy; ""so I ventured to place him there as a punishment.""",bultitude little inattentive say want respect say put accuracy venture place punishment 
98,"""Quite right, Mr. Burdekin,"" said the Doctor: ""quite right. I am sorry that any boy of mine should have caused you to do so. You are again beginning your career of disorder and rebellion, are you, sir? Go up into the schoolroom at once, and write a dozen copies before tea-time! A very little more eccentricity and insubordination from you, Bultitude, and you will reap a full reward--a full reward, sir!""",right say right sorry boy cause do begin career disorder rebellion sir go schoolroom write copy tea-time little more eccentricity insubordination reap full reward full reward sir 
99,"So Mr. Bultitude was driven out of the dancing class in dire disgrace--which would not have distressed him particularly, being only one more drop in his bitter cup--but that he recognised that now his hopes of approaching the Doctor with his burden of woe were fallen like a card castle. They were fiddled and danced away for at least twenty-four hours--perhaps for ever!",drive dancing class dire disgrace distress more drop bitter cup recognise hope approach doctor burden woe fall card castle fiddle dance least hour 
100,"Bitterly did he brood over this as he slowly and laboriously copied out sundry vain repetitions of such axioms as, ""Cultivate Habits of Courtesy and Self-control,"" and ""True Happiness is to be sought in Contentment."" He saw the prospect of a tolerably severe flogging growing more and more distinct, and felt that he could not present himself to his family with the consciousness of having suffered such an indelible disgrace. His family! What would become of them in his absence? Would he ever see his comfortable home in Bayswater again?",briod copy sundry vain repetition such axiom cultivate control true seek contentment see prospect severe flog grow distinct feel present family consciousness suffer indelible disgrace family become absence see comfortable home 
101,"Tea-time came, and after it evening preparation, when Mr. Tinkler presided in a feeble and ineffective manner, perpetually suspecting that the faint sniggers he heard were indulged in at his own expense, and calling perfectly innocent victims to account for them.",tea time come evening preparation preside feeble ineffective manner suspect faint snigger hear indulge own expense call innocent victim account 
102,"Paul sat next to Jolland and, in his desperate anxiety to avoid further unpleasantness, found himself, as he could not for his life have written a Latin or a German composition, reduced to copy down his neighbour's exercises. This Jolland (who had looked forward to an arrangement of a very opposite kind) nevertheless cheerfully allowed him to do, though he expressed doubts as to the wisdom of a servile imitation--more, perhaps, from prudence than conscientiousness.",sit desperate anxiety avoid further unpleasantness find life write german composition reduce copy neighbour exercise look arrangement opposite kind allow do express doubt wisdom servile imitation more prudence conscientiousness 
103,"Jolland, in the intervals of study, was deeply engaged in the production of a small illustrated work of fiction, which he was pleased to call _The Adventures of Ben Buterkin at Scool_. It was in a great measure an autobiography, and the cuts depicting the hero's flagellations--which were frequent in the course of the narrative--were executed with much vigour and feeling.",interval study engage production small illustrate work fiction pleased call great measure autobiography cut depict hero flagellation frequent course narrative execute much vigour feeling 
104,"He turned out a great number of these works in the course of the term, as well as faces in pen and ink with moving tongues and rolling eyes, and these he would present to a few favoured friends with a secretive and self-depreciatory giggle.",turn great number work course term face pen ink move tongue roll eye present few favour friend secretive self depreciatory giggle 
105,"Amidst scenes and companions like these, Paul sat out the evening hours on his hard seat, which was just at the junction of two forms--an exquisitely uncomfortable position, as all who have tried it will acknowledge--until the time for going to bed came round again. He dreaded the hours of darkness, but there was no help for it--to protest would have been madness just then, and, once more, he was forced to pass a night under the roof of Crichton House.",scene companion sit evening hour hard seat junction form uncomfortable position try acknowledge time go bed come dread hour darkness be help protest madness more force pass night roof 
106,"It was even worse than the first, though this was greatly owing to his own obstinacy.",bad first ow own obstinacy 
107,"The boys, if less subdued, were in better temper than the evening before, and found it troublesome to keep up a feud when the first flush of resentment had died out. There was a general disposition to forget his departure from the code of schoolboy honour, and give him an opportunity of retrieving the past.",boy subdued good temper evening find troublesome keep feud first flush resentment die be general disposition forget departure code schoolboy honour give opportunity retrieve past 
108,"But he would not meet them half-way; his repeated repulses by the Doctor and all the difficulties that beset his return to freedom had made him very sulky and snappish. He had not patience or adaptability enough to respond to their advances, and only shrank from their rough good nature--which naturally checked the current of good feeling.",meet half way repeat repulse difficulty beset return freedom make sulky snappish have patience adaptability respond advance shrank rough good nature check current good feeling 
109,"Then, when the lights were put out, some one demanded a story. Most of the bedrooms possessed a professional story-teller, and in one there was a young romancist who began a stirring history the very first night of the term, which always ran on until the night before the holidays, and, if his hearers were apt to yawn at the sixth week of it, he himself enjoyed and believed in it keenly from beginning to end.",light put one demand story most bedroom possess professional story teller young romancist begin stir history very first night term run night holiday hearer apt yawn sixth week enjoy believe begin end 
110,"Dick Bultitude had been a valued _raconteur_, it appeared, and his father found accordingly, to his disgust, that he was expected to amuse them with a story. When he clearly understood the idea, he rejected it with so savage a snarl, that he soon found it necessary to retire under the bedclothes to escape the general indignation that followed.",value _raconteur_ appear father find disgust expect amuse story understand idea reject savage snarl find necessary retire bedclothe escape general indignation follow 
111,"Finding that he did not actively resent it (the real Dick would have had the occupant of the nearest bed out by the ears in a minute!), they profited by his prudence to come to his bedside, where they pillowed his weary head (with their own pillows) till the slight offered them was more than avenged.",find resent real have occupant near bed ear minute profit prudence come bedside pillow weary head own pillow slight offer more avenge 
112,"After that, Mr. Bultitude, with the breath half beaten out of his body, lay writhing and spluttering on his hard, rough bed till long after silence had fallen over the adjoining beds, and the sleepy hum of talk in the other bedrooms had died away.",breath half beat body lay writhe splutter hard rough bed silence fall adjoin bed sleepy hum talk other bedroom die 
113,"Then he, too, drifted off into wild and troubled dreams, which, at their maddest, were scattered into blankness by a sudden and violent shock, which jerked him, clutching and grasping at nothing, on to the cold, bare boards, where he rolled, shivering.",drift wild troubled dream maddest scatter blankness sudden violent shock jerk clutch grasp cold bare board roll shiver 
114,"""An earthquake!"" he thought, ""an explosion ... gas--or dynamite! He must go and call the children ... Boaler ... the plate!""",earthquake think explosion gas dynamite go call child plate 
115,"But the reality to which he woke was worse still. Tipping and Coker had been patiently pinching themselves to keep awake until their enemy should be soundly asleep, in order to enjoy the exquisite pleasure of letting down the mattress; and, too dazed and frightened even to swear, Paul gathered up his bedclothes and tried to draw them about him as well as he might, and seek sleep, which had lost its security.",reality wake bad tip pinch keep awake enemy asleep order enjoy exquisite pleasure let mattress dazed frighten swear gather bedclothe try draw seek sleep lose security
