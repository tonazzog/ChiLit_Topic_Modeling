1,CHAPTER XXI. THE RETURN FROM THE BASTILE.,return bastile 
2," He stepped down easily and lightly among the sheep. They rose without surprise or disorder, still with strict attention to business continuing to munch at the grass they had plucked as they lay, for all the world as if a famous adventure-seeking general had been only the harmless but boresome shepherd who came to drive them out to pastures new. For all the surprise they showed they might have been accustomed from their fleeciest infancy to small, dirty, scratched, bruised, infinitely tattered imps of imperial descent arriving suddenly out of unexplored secret passages in ancient fortresses.",step sheep rise surprise disorder strict attention business continue munch grass pluck lay world famous adventure seek general harmless boresome shepherd come drive pasture new surprise show accustom fleeciest infancy small dirty scratch bruise tattered imp imperial descent arrive unexplored secret passage ancient fortress 
3,"The great commander's first instinct was to rush for home and so make sure that Cook Mary the Second had done enough kidneys for breakfast. His second idea, and one more worthy of his military reputation, was carefully to conceal the entrance to the doorway, by which he had emerged from the passage he had so wonderfully discovered. No one knew how soon the knowledge might prove useful to him. As a matter of attack and defence the underground passage was certainly not to be neglected.",great commander first instinct rush home make sure second do enough kidney breakfast second idea worthy military reputation conceal entrance doorway emerge passage discover know knowledge prove useful matter attack defence underground passage neglect 
4,"Then Hugh John drove the sheep before him out of the fallen tower. As he did so one of them coughed, stretching its neck and holding its head near the ground. He now knew the origin of the sound which had--no, not frightened him (of course not!), but slightly surprised him the evening before.",drive sheep fall tower do cough stretch neck hold head ground know origin sound have frighten course surprise evening 
5,"And, lo! there, immediately in front of him as he emerged, was the Edam Water, sliding and rippling on under its willows, the slim, silvery-grey leaves showing their white under-sides just as usual. There, across the river, were the cattle, standing already knee-deep in the shallows, their tails nervy and switchy on the alert for the morning's crop of flies. There was Mike going to drive them in to be milked. Yonder in the far distance was a black speck which must be Peter polishing straps and buckles hung on a pin by the stable door.",front emerge slide ripple willow slim silvery grey leave show white side usual river cattle stand knee deep shallow tail nervy switchy alert morning crop fly be go drive milk far distance black speck polish strap buckle hang pin stable door 
6,"""Horrid beasts every one of them!"" said Hugh John indignantly to himself, ""going on all as comfortable as you please, just as if I had not been pining in a dungeon cell for years and years.""",horrid beast say go comfortable pine dungeon cell year year 
7,"Then setting his cramped wet legs in motion, General Napoleon commenced a masterly retreat in the direction of home. He dashed for the stepping-stones, but he was in too much of a hurry to make sure of hitting them. He slipped from the first and went above the knee into the clear cool Edam Water. After that he simply floundered through, and presently emerged dripping on the other side. Along the woodland paths he scurried and scampered. He dashed across glades, scattering the rabbits and kicking up the dew in the joy of recovered freedom. He climbed a stone dyke into the home park, because he had no time to go round by the stile. He brought half of the fence down in his haste, scraping his knee as he did so. But so excited was he that he scarcely felt the additional bruise.",set cramped wet leg motion commence masterly retreat direction home dash step stone much hurry make sure hit slip first go knee clear cool flounder emerge drip other side woodland path scurry scamper dash glade scatter rabbit kick dew joy recover freedom climb stone dyke home park have time go stile bring half fence haste scrape knee do excited feel additional bruise 
8,"He ran up the steps. The front door was standing wide open, with the disreputable and tell-tale air of a reveller who has been out all night in evening dress. All doors have this look which have not been decently shut and locked during the dark hours. There was no one in the hall--no one in the dining-room--no one in the schoolroom, where the children's tea of the night before had never been cleared away. Hugh John noticed that his own place had been set, and the clean cup and plate and the burnished unused knife struck him as infinitely pathetic.",run step front door stand open disreputable tell tale air reveller night evening dress door have look shut lock dark hour be hall dining room schoolroom child tea night clear notice own place set clean cup plate burnish unused knife strike pathetic 
9,"But he was hungry, and had no time to waste on mere feelings. His inner man was too insistent. He knew well where the pantry was (trust him for that!), and he went towards it at the rate of twenty miles an hour. He wished he had remembered to add a petition to his prayer that it might be unlocked. But it was now too late for this, so he must just trust in an unjogged Providence and take his chances.",hungry have time waste mere feeling inner man insistent know pantry trust go rate mile hour wish remember add petition prayer unlock late trust unjogged take chance 
10,"The gods were favourable. They had evidently agreed that for one small boy he had suffered enough for that day. The pantry was unlocked. There was a lovely beefsteak pie standing on a shelf. Hugh John lifted it off, set it on the candle box, ungratefully throwing Sambo Soulis on the floor in order to make elbow room, and then with a knife and fork he proceeded to demolish the pie. The knife and fork he first put his hands on had obviously been used. But did General Napoleon stop to go to the schoolroom for clean ones? No--several thousand times no! Those who can, for a single moment, entertain such thoughts, are very far from having yet made the acquaintance of General Smith. Why, he did not even wait to say grace--though he usually repeated half-a-dozen the first thing in the morning, so as to have the job well over for the day. It is all right to say grace, but it is such a fag to have to remember before every meal. So Hugh John went into the wholesale business.",god favourable agree small boy suffer day pantry unlock be lovely beefsteak pie stand shelf lift set candle box throw floor order make elbow room knife fork proceed demolish pie knife fork put hand use stop go schoolroom clean one several time single moment entertain such thought make acquaintance wait say grace repeat half first thing morning have job day right say grace fag have remember meal go wholesale business 
11,"He was half through the pie before he looked about for something to drink. Lemonade, if it could be found, would meet the case. Hugh John felt this keenly, and, lo! the friendly Fates, with a smile, had planted a whole case of it at his feet. He knocked in the patent stopper with the handle of his knife (all things must yield to military necessity), and, after the first draught, what more was there left to live for--except a second bottle and the rest of the pie?",half pie look drink find meet case feel friendly smile plant whole case foot knock patent stopper handle knife thing yield military necessity first draught more leave live second bottle rest pie 
12,"He was just doing his best to live up to the nice cool jelly, which melted in a kind of lingering chill of delight down his throat, when Janet Sheepshanks appeared in the doorway. Wearily and disheartenedly, she had come in to prepare for a breakfast which no one in all Windy Standard would eat. Something curious about the feeling of the house had struck her as she entered. She had gone from room to room, divided between hope and apprehension, and, lo! there before her, in her own ravished pantry, tuck-full of beefsteak pie and lemonade, sat the boy for whom they were even then dragging the deepest pools of the Edam.",do good live nice cool jelly melt kind linger chill delight throat appear doorway come prepare breakfast windy eat curious feeling house strike enter go room room divide hope apprehension own ravish pantry tuck full beefsteak pie lemonade sit boy drag deep pool 
13,"""Oh, thank the Lord, laddie!"" cried Janet, clasping her hands in devout thankfulness, ""that He hath spared ye to your widowed faither--and to me, your auld unworthy nurse!""",thank laddie cry clasp hand devout thankfulness spare widow faither auld unworthy nurse 
14,The tears were running down her cheeks. Somehow her face had quite suddenly grown grey and worn. She looked years older than she had done yesterday. Hugh John paused and looked at her marvelling. He had a heavily laden fork half-way to his mouth. He wondered what all the fuss was about.,tear run cheek face grow grey wear look year old do yesterday pause look marvell have laden fork half way mouth wonder fuss 
15,"""Do get me some mustard, Janet,"" he said, swinging his wet legs; ""and where on earth have you put the pickles?""",get mustard say swing wet leg earth put pickle 
16,       *       *       *       *       *,
17,"In the cross-examination which naturally followed, Hugh John kept his own counsel, like the prudent warrior he was. He left Janet and the others to suppose that, in trying to escape from his foes, he had ""fallen"" into the castle dungeon, and none of the household servants knew enough of the topography of the ancient stronghold to know that, if he had done so, he would probably have broken his neck. He said nothing about Nipper Donnan or any of the band by name. Simply and truthfully he designated them as ""some bad boys,"" which certainly was in no way overstating the case.",cross -examination follow keep own counsel prudent warrior leave other suppose try escape foe fall castle dungeon household servant know enough topography ancient stronghold know do break neck say band name designate bad boy way overstate case 
18,"Perhaps if his father had been at home he could not have hoodwinked his questioners so easily and completely. Mr. Picton Smith would certainly have gone deeper into the business than Janet Sheepshanks, who alternately slapped and scolded, petted and spoilt our hero all day long.",father home hoodwink questioner go business slap scold pett spoil hero day 
19,"For some time Hugh John smelt of Araby the Blest and Spicy Ind; for he had ointments and liniments, rags and plasters innumerable scattered over his person in all directions.",time smell spicy have ointment liniment rag plaster innumerable scatter person direction 
20,"He borrowed a cigarette (it was a very old and dry one) from the mantelpiece of his father's workroom, and retired to the shelter of the elm-tree to hold his court and take private evidence upon the events of yesterday.",borrow cigarette old dry one mantelpiece father workroom retire shelter elm tree hold court take private evidence event yesterday 
21,"As he went across the yard Black Donald ran bleating to him, and playfully butted at his leg.",go yard run bleat but leg 
22,Hugh John stopped in astonishment.,stop astonishment 
23,"""Who found him?"" he asked.",find ask 
24,"Sir Toady Lion proudly stepped forward. He had a garden rake in his hand, with which the moment before he had been poking Donald in the ribs, and making his life a burden to him generally.",step have garden rake hand moment poke rib make life burden

26,"He began to speak, but Hugh John stopped him.",begin speak stop 
27,"""Salute, you little beast!"" he said sternly.",salute little beast say 
28,"Slowly Toady Lion's hand went up. He did not object to salute, but he had a vague sense that, as a matter of personal dignity, not even a general had a right to speak to a private thus--much less to a commissariat sergeant. However, what he had to say was so triumphant and overpowering that he waived the point and touched his forehead in due form.",hand go object salute have vague sense matter personal dignity general have right speak private less commissariat sergeant have say triumphant overpowering waive point touch forehead due form 
29,"""_I_ did--nobody but me. I d'livered him, all by mineself. I cutted the rope and d'livered Donald. Yes, I did--Prissy will tell 'oo. I wented into the Black Sheds all alone-y--and d'livered him!""",d'liver mineself cutt rope d'liver tell went black d'liver 
30,"His words came tumbling over each other in his haste. But he laid strong emphasis upon the word ""delivered,"" which he had just learned from Prissy. He meant to use it very often all that day, because it was a good word, and nobody knew the meaning of it except Quite-Grown-Ups.",word come tumble other haste lay strong emphasis word deliver learn mean use day good word know meaning quite grow 
31,"General Napoleon Smith put on his most field-marshalish expression, and summoned Sir Toady Lion to approach.",put field marshalish expression summon approach 
32,"He tapped him on the shoulder and said in a grand voice, ""I create you General of the Comm'sariat for distinguished conduct in the field. From this time forth you can keep the key of the biscuit box, but I know just how many are in. So mind out!""",tap shoulder say grand voice create distinguished conduct field time keep key biscuit box know many mind 
33,"This was good, and Toady Lion was duly grateful; but he wished his good fortune put into a more concrete form.",good grateful wish good fortune put concrete form 
34,"""Can I have the biggest and nicerest saucer of the scrapings of the preserving-pan to-night?""",have big nicerest saucer scraping preserve pan night 
35,Hugh John considered a moment. An impulse of generosity swept over him.,consider moment impulse generosity sweep 
36,"""Yes, you can,"" he said nobly. Then a cross wave of caution caused him to add--""that is, if it isn't rasps!""",say cross wave caution cause add rasp 
37,"Now the children of the house of Windy Standard were permitted to clean out the boiling-pan in the fruit-preserving season with worn horn spoons, in order not to scratch the copper or crack the enamel. And rasp was Hugh John's favourite.",child house windy permit clean boil pan fruit preserve season wear horn spoon order scratch copper crack enamel rasp favourite 
38,"""Huh,"" said Toady Lion, turning up a contemptuous nose. ""Thank 'oo for nuffin! I like wasps just as much as 'oo, Hugh John Picton Smiff!""",say turn contemptuous nose thank oo like wasp much 
39,"""Don't answer me back, sir!""--Hugh John was using his father's words and manner.",answer sir use father word manner 
40,"""Sall if I like,"" said Toady Lion, beginning to whimper. ""Sall go and tell Janet Sheepshanks, and she'll give me yots of wasps! Not scrapin's neither, but weal-weal wasps--so there!""",like say begin whimper go tell give yot wasp scrapin weal weal wasp 
41,"""Toady Lion, I shall degrade you to the ranks. You are a little pig and a disgrace to the army.""",degrade rank little pig disgrace army 
42,"""Don't care, I wants wasps--and I d'livered Donald,"" reiterated the Disgrace of the Army.",care want wasp d'liver reiterate 
43,"Hugh John once more felt the difficulty of arguing with Toady Lion. He was altogether too young to be logical. So he said, ""Toady Lion, you little ass, stop snivelling--and I'll give you a bone button and the half of a knife.""",feel difficulty argue young logical say little ass stop snivell give bone button half knife 
44,"""Let's see them,"" said Toady Lion, cautiously uncovering one eye by lifting up the edge of the covering palm. His commanding officer produced the articles of peace, and Toady Lion examined them carefully, still with one eye. They proved satisfactory.",let see say uncover eye lift edge cover palm commanding officer produce article peace examine eye prove satisfactory 
45,"""All yight!"" said he, ""I won't cry no more--but I wants three saucers full of the wasps too!""",yight say cry more want saucer full wasp
