1,CHAPTER 38. GOOD-BYE TO SAINT DOMINIC'S.,chapter good 
2,"And now, reader, we are at the end of our story, and there only remain the usual ""last words"" before we say good-bye.",reader end story remain usual last word say good bye 
3,"Saint Dominic's flourishes still, and only last season beat the County by five wickets!  The captain on that occasion was a fellow called Stephen Greenfield, who carried his bat for forty-eight in the first innings.  He is a big fellow, is the captain, and has got a moustache. Though he is the oldest boy at Saint Dominic's, every one talks of him as ""Greenfield junior.""  He is vastly popular, and fellows say there never was such a good Sixth at the school since the days of his brother, Greenfield senior, five years ago.  The captain is an object of special awe among the youngsters of the Fourth Junior, who positively quake in their shoes whenever his manly form appears in the upper corridor.",flourishe last season beat wicket captain occasion fellow call carry bat first inning big fellow captain get moustache old boy one talk popular fellow say be good sixth school day brother senior year captain object special awe youngster fourth quake shoe manly form appear upper corridor 
4,"These youngsters, by the way, are still the liveliest section of Saint Dominic's.  The names Guinea-pig and Tadpole have died out, and left behind them only the Buttercups and Daisies, who, however, are as fierce rivals and as inky scamps as even their predecessors were.  There is a lout of a fellow in the Fourth Senior called Bramble, who is extremely ""down"" on these juveniles, always snubbing them, and, along with one Padger, a friend of his, plotting to get them into trouble.  But somehow they are not much afraid of Bramble, whereat Bramble is particularly furious, and summons Padger to a ""meeting"" about once a week in his study, there to take counsel against these irreverent Buttercups and Daisies.",youngster way liveliest section name pig die leave fierce rival inky scamp predecessor be lout fellow fourth senior call juvenile snubb friend plot get trouble afraid furious summons meeting week study take counsel irreverent buttercup daisy 
5,"About the only other fellow the reader will recollect is Paul, now in the Sixth, a steady-going sort of fellow, who, by the way, has just won the Nightingale Scholarship, greatly to the delight of his particular friend the captain.",only other fellow reader recollect sixth steady go sort fellow way win delight particular friend captain 
6,"Last year the Fifth tried to revive an old institution of their Form, in the shape of a newspaper entitled the _Dominican_, directed chiefly against the members of the Sixth.  But somehow the undertaking did not come off.  The _Dominican_ was a very mild affair for one thing, and there was nothing amusing about it for another thing, and there was a good deal offensive about it for another thing; and for another thing, the captain ordered it to be taken down off the wall on the first day of its appearance, and announced that if he had any more of this nonsense he would thrash one or two whose names he mentioned, and knock one or two others out of the first eleven.",last year fifth try revive old institution form shape newspaper entitle direct member undertaking come mild affair thing be amusing thing be good deal offensive thing thing captain order take wall first day appearance announce have more nonsense thrash name mention knock other first

8,"The big cricket match against the County I spoke of just now was a famous event for more reasons than one.  The chief reason, of course, was the glorious victory of the old school; but another reason, almost as notable, was the strange muster of old boys who turned up to witness the exploits of the ""youngsters.""",big cricket match speak famous event more reason chief reason course glorious victory old school reason notable strange muster old boy turn witness exploit youngster 
9,"There was Tom Braddy, for instance, smoking a big cigar the size of a pencil-case, looking the picture of a snob.  And with him a vacant-looking young man with a great crop of whiskers on his puffy cheeks.  His name was Simon.  The great idea of these two worthies seemed to be to do the grand before their posterity.  They were convinced in their own minds that in this they were completely successful, but no one else saw it.",be instance smoke big cigar size pencil case look picture snob vacant look young man great crop whisker puffy cheek name great idea worthie seem do grand posterity convince own mind successful else see 
10,"Boys took a good deal more interest in a lame gentleman present, who was cracking jokes with everybody, and hobbling about from one old crony to another in a manner that was perfectly frisky.  Every one seemed to like Mr Pembury, and not a _few_ to be afraid of him.  Perhaps that was because he was the editor of a well-known paper of the day, and every one likes to be on good terms with an editor.",boy take good deal more interest lame gentleman present crack joke hobble old crony manner frisky one seem like _few_ afraid editor know paper day one like good term editor 
11,"Then there were a batch of fellows whose names we need hardly enumerate, who had run over from Oxford, or Cambridge, or London for the day, and who got into clusters between the innings and talked and laughed a great deal over old times, when ""Bully did this,"" and ""Rick did that,"" and so on.  A nice lot of fellows they looked on the whole, and one or two, so people said, were doing well.",be batch fellow name need enumerate run day get cluster inning talk laugh great deal old time do do nice lot fellow look whole person say do 
12,"But among these _the_ lions of the day were two friends who strolled about arm-in-arm, and appeared far more at home in Saint Dominic's even than the boys themselves.  One of them was the big brother of the captain--a terrible fellow by all accounts.  He rowed in the boat of his 'Varsity the last year he was at Cambridge, and since then he has been called to the bar, and no one knows what else!  People say Oliver Greenfield is a rising man; if so, we may hear of him again.  At any rate in the eyes of the admiring youngsters of Saint Dominic's he was a great man already.",_the_ lion day friend stroll arm arm appear more home boy big brother captain terrible fellow account row boat last year call bar know else person say rise man hear rate eye admire youngster great man 
13,"So was his friend Wraysford, a fellow of his college, and a ""coach"" for industrious undergraduates.  He does not look like a tutor, certainly, to judge by his jovial face and the capers he persisted in cutting with some of his old comrades of years ago.  But he is one, and Saint Dominic's Junior eyed him askance shyly, and thought him rather more learned and formidable a person than the old Doctor himself.",friend fellow college coach industrious undergraduate look tutor judge jovial face caper persist cut old comrade year eye askance think learn formidable person old 
14,"No one enjoyed themselves on that day more than these two, who prowled about and visited every nook and cranny of the old place--studies, passages, class-rooms, Fourth Junior and all.",enjoy day more prowl visit nook cranny old place study passage class room fourth 
15,"The match is over, the jubilations of victory have subsided, and one by one the visitors depart.  Among the last to leave are Oliver and Wraysford; they have stayed to dine with the Doctor, and when at last they do turn their backs on the old school it is getting late.",match jubilation victory subside visitor depart last leave stay dine last turn back old school get late 
16,"Stephen accompanies them down to the station.  On the way they pass the well-known Cockchafer.  The old board is still there, but a new name is upon it.",accompany station way pass know old board new name

He stuck on at the lock-house for some time, and then disappeared suddenly.  They said he was wanted for some bit of swindling or other.  Anyhow, he's gone.""",very time go magistrate take licence allow gambling go house stick lock house time disappear say want bit swindling other gone

23,"""Oh, I meant to tell you.  He's coming home; I had a letter from him a week or two ago.

27,"A silence follows, and Oliver says, ""When he does, I tell you what: we must all make up a jolly party and come down together and help him through with it.""",silence follow say tell make jolly party come help
