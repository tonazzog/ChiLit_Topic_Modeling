1,CHAPTER 11. An Important Mission.,important 
2," A few days after the return of the expedition against Covelong and Chengalpatt, Charlie received a note from Governor Saunders, requesting him to call upon him at eleven o'clock. Charlie, of course, attended at Government House at the time named, and found Captain Clive with Mr. Saunders.",few day return expedition receive note request call o'clock course attend time name find 
3,"""I have sent for you, Mr. Marryat, to ask you if you are ready to undertake a delicate, and somewhat dangerous, mission. Captain Clive tells me that he is convinced that you will be able to discharge the duties satisfactorily. He has been giving me the highest report of your conduct and courage, and he tells me that you speak the language with some facility.""",send ask ready undertake delicate dangerous mission tell convinced able discharge duty give high report conduct courage tell speak language facility 
4,"""I have been working hard, sir,"" Charlie said, ""and have had a moonshee for the last year; and as, except when on duty, I have spoken nothing but the native language with him, I can now speak it almost as fluently as I can English.""",work sir say have moonshee last year duty speak native language speak 
5,"""So Captain Clive has been telling me,"" Mr. Saunders said; ""and it is, indeed, on that ground that I select you for the service. Your friend Mr. Peters has equally distinguished himself in the field, Captain Clive tells me, but he is greatly your inferior in his knowledge of the vernacular.""",tell say ground select service friend distinguish field tell inferior knowledge vernacular 
6,"This was indeed the case. Peters had but little natural aptitude for foreign languages; and after working hard, for a time, with the moonshee, he found that he was making so little progress, in comparison with Charlie, that he lost heart; and although he had continued his lessons with the moonshee, he had done so only to the extent of an hour or so a day, whereas Charlie had devoted his whole leisure time to the work.",case have little natural aptitude foreign language work time moonshee find make little progress comparison lose heart continue lesson moonshee do extent hour day devote whole leisure time work 
7,"""The facts of the case are these, Mr. Marryat. Owing to the failure, of Muhammud Ali, to fulfil the ridiculously onerous terms extorted from him, by some of his native allies, during the siege of Trichinopoli, several of them are in a state of discontent, which is likely soon to break out into open hostilities. The Rajahs of Mysore and Tanjore are, I have learned, already in communication with Pondicherry; and will, I believe, shortly acknowledge the son of Chunda Sahib, whom Dupleix has declared ruler of the Carnatic. Murari Reo has already openly joined the French. Their influence in the Deccan is now so great that Bussy may be said to rule there.",fact case owe failure fulfil onerous term extort native ally siege several state discontent likely break open hostility learn communication believe acknowledge son declare ruler join influence great say rule 
8,"""Now, there is a chief named Boorhau Reo, whose territory lies among the hills, and extends from the plain nearly up to the plateau land of the Deccan. His position, like that of many of the other small rajahs, is precarious. In days like the present, when might makes right, and every petty state tries to make profit out of the constant wars, at the expense of its neighbour, the position of a chief, surrounded by half a dozen others more powerful than himself, is by no means pleasant. Boorhau Reo feels that he is in danger of being swallowed, by the nizam or by the Mahrattas, and he earnestly desires to ally himself with us; believing, as he says, that we are destined to be masters here. I have assured him that, although gratified at his expressions of friendship, we can enter into no alliance with him. The position of his territory would enable him to be of great assistance to us, in any war in which the whole force of the Deccan, controlled as it is at present at Bussy, might be utilized against us in the Carnatic. He would be able to harass convoys, cut communications, and otherwise trouble the enemy's movements. But, although we see that his aid would be very useful to us, in case of such a war; we do not see how, on our part, we could give him any protection. We have now, with the greatest difficulty, brought affairs to a successful conclusion in the Carnatic; but Dupleix is active and energetic, and well supported at home. Many of the chiefs lately our allies have, as I have just said, declared against us, or are about to do so; and it is out of the question, for us to think of supporting a chief so far removed from us as Boorhau. I have, therefore, told him that we greatly desire his friendship, but are at present powerless to protect him, should he be attacked by his northern neighbours.",be chief name territory lie hill extend plain plateau land position many other small rajah precarious day present make right petty state try make profit constant war expense neighbour position chief surround other powerful means pleasant feel danger swallow desire ally believe say destine master assure gratified expression friendship enter alliance position territory enable great assistance war whole force control present utilize able harass convoy cut communication trouble enemy movement see aid useful case war see part give protection great difficulty bring affair successful conclusion active energetic support home many chief ally say declare about do question think support chief remove tell desire friendship present powerless protect attack northern neighbour 
9,"""He is particularly anxious to train his men after the European fashion, as he sees that our Sepoys are a match for five times their number of the untrained troops of the Indian princes.",anxious train man european fashion see match time number untrained troops indian prince 
10,"""This brings me to the subject before us. I have written to him, to say that I will send to him an English officer, capable of training and leading his troops, and whose advice may be useful to him upon all occasions; but that as, were it known that he had received a British officer, and was employing him to train his troops, it would excite the instant animosity of Bussy and of the Peishwar; I should send one familiar with the language, and who may pass as a native. Captain Clive has strongly recommended you for this difficult mission.""",bring subject write say send english officer capable train lead troops advice useful occasion know receive british officer employ train troops excite instant animosity send familiar language pass native recommend difficult mission 
11,"""I fear, sir, that I could hardly pass as a native. The moonshee is constantly correcting mistakes which I make, in speaking.""",fear sir pass native moonshee correct mistake make speak 
12,"""That may be so,"" Mr. Saunders said; ""but there are a score of dialects in Southern India, and you could be passed upon nineteen of the twenty peoples who speak them, as belonging to one of the other.""",say be score dialect southern pass people speak belong other 
13,"""If you think, sir, that I shall do,"" Charlie said; ""I shall be glad to undertake the mission.""",think sir do say glad undertake mission 
14,"""Very well, Mr. Marryat, that is understood, then. You will receive full instructions in writing, and will understand that your duty is not only to drill the troops of this chief; but to give him such advice as may suit his and our interests; to strengthen his good feeling towards us; and to form, as far as possible, a compact little force which might, at a critical moment, be of immense utility. You will, of course, master the geography of the country, of which we are all but absolutely ignorant; find out about the passes, the mountain paths, the defensible positions. All these things may someday be of the highest importance.",understand receive full instruction writing understand duty drill troops chief give such advice suit interest strengthen good feeling form possible compact little force critical moment immense utility course master geography country ignorant find pass mountain path defensible position thing high importance 
15,"""You will have a few days to make your arrangements, and settle as to the character you will adopt. This you had better do, in consultation with someone who thoroughly understands the country. It is intended that you shall go down to Trichinopoli, with the next convoy; and from there make your way to the stronghold of Boorhau.""",have few day make arrangement settle character adopt good do consultation understand country intend go next convoy make way stronghold 
16,"""Shall I take any followers with me?""",take follower 
17,"""Yes,"" Mr. Saunders said. ""As you will go in the character of a military adventurer, who has served among our Sepoys long enough to learn European drill, you had better take two, three, or four men, as you like, with you as retainers. You might pick out two or three trusty men, from the Sepoys you command.""",say go character military adventurer serve sepoy learn european drill have good take man like retainer pick trusty man command 
18,"Charlie left Government House in high spirits. It was certainly an honor, to have been selected for such a post. It was quite possible that it would be a dangerous one. It was sure to be altogether different from the ordinary life of a subaltern in the Company's army.",leave high spirit honor select post possible dangerous one sure different ordinary life subaltern company army 
19,"Peters was very sorry when he heard from Charlie that they were, at last, to be separated. It was now nearly two years since they had first met on board the Lizzie Anderson; and, since that time, they had been constantly together, and were greatly attached to each other.",sorry hear last separate year meet board time attach other 
20,"Charlie, perhaps, had taken the lead. The fact of his having a stock of firearms, and being able to lend them to Peters, had given him, perhaps, the first slight and almost imperceptible advantage. His feat of jumping overboard, to rescue Tim Kelly, had been another step in advance; and, although Charlie would have denied it himself, there was no doubt that he generally took the lead, and that his friend was accustomed to lean upon him, and to look to him always for the initiative. It was, therefore, a severe blow to Peters, to find that Charlie was about to be sent on detached service.",take lead fact have stock firearm able lend give first slight imperceptible advantage feat jump rescue step advance deny be doubt take lead friend accustom lean look initiative severe blow find about send detach service 
21,"As for Tim Kelly, he was uproarious in his grief, when he heard that he was to be separated from his master.",uproarious grief hear separate master 
22,"""Shure, Mr. Charlie, ye'll never have the heart to lave a poor boy, that sarved ye be night and day for eighteen months. Tim Kelly would gladly give his life for ye, and ye wouldn't go and lave him behind ye, and go all alone among these black thaves of the world.""",have heart lave poor boy sarve night day month give life go lave go black thave world

24,"""But I'd never open my mouth at all, at all, yer honor, barring for mate and drink.""",open mouth honor barr mate drink 
25,"""It's all very well for you to say so, Tim,"" Charlie answered; ""but I do not think that anything, short of a miracle, would silence your tongue. But leave us now, Tim, and I will talk the matter over with Mr. Peters. I should be glad enough to have you with me, if we could arrange it.""",say answer think short miracle silence tongue leave talk matter glad have arrange 
26,"The moonshee was taken into their counsels, and was asked his opinion as to the disguise which Charlie could adopt, with least risk of detection. The moonshee replied that he might pass as a Bheel. These hill tribes speak a dialect quite distinct from that of the people around them, and the moonshee said that, if properly attired, Charlie would be able to pass anywhere for one of these people; provided, always, that he did not meet with another of the same race.",moonshee take counsel ask opinion disguise adopt least risk detection moonshee reply pass hill tribe speak dialect distinct person moonshee say attire able pass person provide meet same race 
27,"""You might assert,"" he said, ""that your father had taken service with some rajah on the plain, and that you had there learned to speak the language. In this way, you would avoid having to answer any difficult questions regarding your native place; but as to that, you can get up something of the geography before you leave.""",assert say father take service rajah plain learn speak language way avoid have answer difficult question regard native place get geography leave

30,"""What do you say, Mr. Moonshine?"" Tim said.",say say 
31,"The moonshee shook his head. Between these two a perpetual feud had existed, ever since the native had arrived at Arcot, to take his place as a member of Charlie's establishment. In obedience to Charlie's stringent orders, Tim never was openly rude to him; but he never lost an opportunity of making remarks, of a disparaging nature, as to the value of Charlie's studies.",moonshee shake head perpetual feud exist native arrive take place member establishment obedience stringent order rude lose opportunity make remark disparaging nature value study

40,"""But you're always talking, Tim, and when you're not talking to others, you talk to yourself. It's quite impossible you could go as a dumb man; but you might go, as the moonshee suggests, as a half-witted sort of chap; with just sense enough to groom a horse and look after him, but with not enough to understand what's said to you, or to answer any questions.""",talk talk other talk impossible go dumb man go moonshee suggest half witted sort chap sense groom horse look enough understand say answer question

I like a bit of a row as well as any many, but it's all for divarsion; and I could go on, for a year, without quarrelling with a soul. Just try me, Mr. Charles.

44,"It was arranged that the moonshee should remain with Peters, who, seeing that Charlie owed his appointment, to a post which promised excitement and adventure, to his skill in the native languages, was determined that he would again set to, in earnest, and try and master its intricacies. The moonshee went down to the bazaar, and purchased the clothes which would be necessary for the disguises; and Charlie found, in his company, four Sepoys who willingly agreed to accompany him, in the character of his retainers, upon his expedition. As to their costume, there was no difficulty. When off duty, the Sepoys in the Company's service were accustomed to dress in their native attire. Consequently, it needed only the addition of a tulwar, or short curved sword; a shield, thrown over one shoulder; a long matchlock; and two or three pistols and daggers, stuck into a girdle, to complete their equipment.",arrange moonshee remain see owe appointment post promise excitement adventure skill native language determine set earnest try master intricacy moonshee go bazaar purchase clothes necessary disguise find company agree accompany character retainer expedition costume be difficulty duty company service accustom dress native attire need addition tulwar short curved sword shield throw shoulder long matchlock pistol dagger stick girdle complete equipment 
45,"Charlie himself was dressed gaily, in the garb of a military officer in the service of an Indian rajah. He was to ride, and a horse, saddle, and gay housings were procured. He had, at last, given in to Tim's entreaties; and that worthy was dressed as a syce, or horse keeper.",dress garb military officer service indian rajah ride horse saddle gay housing procure last give entreaty worthy dress syce horse keeper 
46,"Both Charlie and Tim had had those portions of their skin exposed to the air darkened, and both would pass muster, at a casual inspection. Charlie, in thus concealing his nationality, desired only to hide the fact that he was an officer in the Company's service. He believed that it would be impossible for him to continue to pass as a Bheel. This, however, would be of no consequence, after a time. Many of the native princes had Europeans in their service. Runaway sailors, deserters from the English, French, and Dutch armed forces in their possessions on the seacoast, adventurers influenced either by a love of a life of excitement, or whom a desire to escape the consequences of folly or crime committed at home had driven to a roving life--such men might be found in many of the native courts.",have portion skin expose air darken pass muster casual inspection conceal nationality desire hide fact officer company service believe impossible continue pass consequence time many native prince have service runaway sailor deserter english french dutch armed force possession seacoast adventurer influence love life excitement desire escape consequence folly crime commit home drive rove life such man find many native court 
47,"Once settled, then, in the service of the rajah, Charlie intended to make but little farther pretence, or secrecy, as to his nationality. Outwardly, he would still conform to the language and appearance of the character he had chosen; but he would allow it to be supposed that he was an Englishman, a deserter from the Company's service, and that his comrades were Sepoys in a similar position. His employment, then, at the court of the rajah, would have an effect the exact reverse of that which it would have done, had he appeared in his proper character.",settle service rajah intend make little far pretence secrecy nationality conform language appearance character choose allow suppose englishman deserter service comrade similar position employment court have effect exact reverse do appear proper character 
48,"Deserters were, of all men, the most opposed to their countrymen, to whom they had proved traitors. In battle they could be relied upon to fight desperately, for they fought with ropes round their necks. Therefore, while the appearance of an English officer, as instructor of the forces of the rajah, would have drawn upon himself the instant hostility of all opposed to the British; the circulation of a report that his troops were being disciplined by some English and native deserters, from the Company's forces, would excite no suspicion whatever.",deserter man oppose countryman prove traitor battle rely fight fight rope neck appearance english officer instructor force draw instant hostility oppose british circulation report troops disciplined english native deserter force excite suspicion 
49,"To avoid attracting attention, Charlie Marryat and his party set out before daylight from Madras. Their appearance, indeed, would have attracted no attention, when they once had passed beyond the boundaries of the portion of the town occupied by the whites. In the native quarter, the appearance of a small zemindar, or landowner, attended by four or five armed followers on foot, was of such common occurrence as to attract no attention whatever; and, indeed, numbers of these come in to take service in the Sepoy regiments, the profession of arms being always considered honorable, in India.",avoid attract attention party set daylight appearance attract attention pass boundary portion town occupy white native quarter appearance small zemindar landowner attend armed follower foot such common occurrence attract attention number come take service regiment profession arm consider honorable 
50,"For a fortnight they travelled, by easy stages, without question or suspicion being excited that they were not what they seemed. They were now among the hills, and soon arrived at Ambur, the seat of the rajah. The town was a small one, and above it rose the fortress, which stood on a rock rising sheer from the bottom of the valley, and standing boldly out from the hillside. The communication was effected by a shoulder which, starting from a point halfway up the rock, joined the hill behind it. Along this shoulder were walls and gateways. An enemy attacking these would be exposed to the fire from the summit of the rock. From the point where the shoulder joined the rock, a zigzag road had been cut, with enormous labour, in the face of the rock, to the summit.",fortnight travel easy stage question suspicion excite seem hill arrive seat rajah town small one rise fortress stand rock rise sheer bottom valley stand hillside communication effect shoulder start point rock join hill shoulder wall gateway enemy attack expose fire summit rock point shoulder join rock zigzag road cut enormous labour face rock summit

52,"""It's a powerful place, surely,"" Tim said; ""and would puzzle the ould boy himself to take. Even Captain Clive, who is afeard of nothing, would be bothered by it.""",powerful place say puzzle would boy take afeard bother 
53,"As they rode up the valley, two horsemen were seen spurring towards them, from the town. They drew rein before Charlie; and one, bowing, said:",ride valley horsemen see spurr town draw rein bow say

55,"""Will you tell your lord that Nadir Ali is here,"" Charlie said, ""and that he longs to see the face of the rajah.""",tell lord say long see face rajah 
56,"One of the horsemen at once rode off, and the other took his place by the side of Charlie; and, having introduced himself as captain of the rajah's bodyguard, rode with him through the town.",horsemen ride other take place side introduce captain bodyguard ride town 
57,"Had Charlie appeared in his character as English officer, the rajah and all his troops would have turned out to do honor to his arrival. As it was, a portion of the garrison, only, appeared at the gate and lined the walls. Through these the little party passed, and up the sharp zigzags, which were so steep that, had it not been that his dignity prevented him from dismounting, Charlie would gladly have got off and proceeded on foot; for it was as much as the animal could do, to struggle up the steep incline.",appear character english officer troops turn do honor arrival portion garrison appear gate line wall little party pass sharp zigzag steep dignity prevent dismount get proceed foot much animal do struggle steep incline 
58,"At each turn there was a gateway, with little flanking towers; on which jingalls, or small wall pieces, commanded the road.",turn be gateway little flanking tower jingall small wall piece command road

60,"""It is tremendously strong, Tim, but it is astonishing what brave men can do.""",strong astonish brave man do 
61,"In the after wars which England waged, in India, the truth of what Charlie said was over and over again proved. Numerous fortresses, supposed by the natives to be absolutely impregnable, and far exceeding in strength that just described, have been carried by assault, by the dash and daring of English troops.",war wage truth say prove numerous fortress suppose native impregnable exceed strength describe carry assault dash dare english troops 
62,"They gained, at last, the top of the rock. It was uneven in surface, some portions being considerably more elevated than others. Roughly, its extent was about a hundred yards, either way. The lower level was covered with buildings, occupied by the garrison, and storehouses. On the upper level, some forty feet higher, stood the palace of the rajah. It communicated with the courtyard, below, by a broad flight of steps. These led to an arched gateway, with a wall and battlements; forming an interior line of defence, should an assailant gain a footing in the lower portion of the stronghold.",gain last top rock uneven surface portion elevate other extent yard way low level cover building occupy garrison storehouse upper level foot high stand palace rajah communicate courtyard broad flight step lead arched gateway wall battlement form interior line defence assailant gain footing low portion stronghold 
63,"Alighting from his horse at the foot of the steps, Charlie, followed by his five retainers, mounted to the gateway. Here another guard of honor was drawn up. Passing through these, they entered a shady courtyard, on one side of which was a stone pavilion. The flat ceiling was supported by massive columns, closely covered with intricate sculpture. The roof was arabesqued with deeply cut patterns, picked out in bright colours. A fountain played in the middle.",alight horse foot step follow retainer mount gateway guard honor draw pass enter shady courtyard side stone pavilion flat ceiling support massive column cover intricate sculpture roof arabesque cut pattern pick bright colour fountain play middle 
64,"On the farther side the floor, which was of marble, was raised; and two steps led to a wide recess, with windows of lattice stonework, giving a view over the town and valley below. In this recess were piles of cushions and carpets, and here reclined the rajah, a spare and active-looking man, of some forty years old. He rose, as Charlie approached, the soldiers and Sepoys remaining beyond the limits of the pavilion.",far side floor marble raise step lead wide recess window lattice stonework give view town valley recess pile cushion carpet recline rajah spare active look man year old rise approach soldier remain limit pavilion

67,"""I am glad to see you, Sahib,"" he said, when they were alone; ""though, in truth, I looked for one older than yourself. The great English governor of Madras tells me, however, in a letter which I received four days since, that you are skilled in war; that you fought by the side of that great Captain Clive at Arcot, Arni, Kavaripak, and at Trichinopoli; and that the great warrior, himself, chose you to come to me.

You believe that the fortunes of the English are on the increase; and as you think the time may come, ere long, when they will turn the French out of the Deccan, and become masters there, as they have already become masters in the Carnatic, you wish to fight by their side, and share their fortunes.

72,Charlie then asked the rajah as to the strength of his military force.,ask strength military force

78,"""Then I should propose that we begin with eight hundred,"" Charlie said. ""For a month, however, I will confine myself to the troops you at present have. We must, in the first place, train some officers.

There will be one of my drill instructors to each party, ten under officers, and four or five of the officers whom you will appoint. Six weeks' hard work should make these eight hundred men fairly acquainted with drill. The English Sepoys have often gone out to fight, with less. At the end of the six weeks, let the five hundred men you have called out, in addition to your bodyguard of three hundred, return to their homes; and replace them by an equal number of fresh levies, and so proceed until you have your three thousand fighting men, thoroughly trained.

81,"The rajah agreed, heartily, to Charlie's proposals; well pleased at the thought that he should, before the end of a year, be possessed of a trained force, which would enable him to hold his own against his powerful neighbours, until an opportunity might occur when, in alliance with the English, he should be able to turn the tables upon them, and to aggrandize himself at their expense.",agree proposal pleased thought end year possess train force enable hold own powerful neighbour opportunity occur alliance able turn table aggrandize expense
