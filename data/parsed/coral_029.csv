3,"It was with feelings of awe, not unmingled with fear, that I now seated myself on the cabin sky-light and gazed upon the rigid features of my late comrade, while my mind wandered over his past history and contemplated with anxiety my present position.  Alone! in the midst of the wide Pacific, having a most imperfect knowledge of navigation, and in a schooner requiring at least eight men as her proper crew.  But I will not tax the reader's patience with a minute detail of my feelings and doings during the first few days that followed the death of my companion. I will merely mention that I tied a cannon ball to his feet and, with feelings of the deepest sorrow, consigned him to the deep.",feeling awe unmingled fear seat cabin sky light gaze rigid feature late comrade mind wander past history contemplate anxiety present position midst wide have imperfect knowledge navigation schooner require least man proper crew tax reader patience minute detail feeling doing first few day follow death companion mention tie can non ball foot feeling deep sorrow consign deep 
4,"For fully a week after that a steady breeze blew from the east, and, as my course lay west-and-by-north, I made rapid progress towards my destination.  I could not take an observation, which I very much regretted, as the captain's quadrant was in the cabin; but, from the day of setting sail from the island of the savages, I had kept a dead reckoning, and as I knew pretty well now how much lee-way the schooner made, I hoped to hit the Coral Island without much difficulty.  In this I was the more confident that I knew its position on the chart (which I understood was a very good one), and so had its correct bearings by compass.",week steady breeze blow east course lay north make rapid progress destination take observation regret captain quadrant cabin day set sail island savage keep dead reckoning know much way schooner make hope hit much difficulty confident know position chart understand good one have correct bearing compass 
5,"As the weather seemed now quite settled and fine, and as I had got into the trade-winds, I set about preparations for hoisting the top-sails. This was a most arduous task, and my first attempts were complete failures, owing, in a great degree, to my reprehensible ignorance of mechanical forces.  The first error I made was in applying my apparatus of blocks and pulleys to a rope which was too weak, so that the very first heave I made broke it in two, and sent me staggering against the after-hatch, over which I tripped, and, striking against the main-boom, tumbled down the companion ladder into the cabin.  I was much bruised and somewhat stunned by this untoward accident.  However, I considered it fortunate that I was not killed.  In my next attempt I made sure of not coming by a similar accident, so I unreeved the tackling and fitted up larger blocks and ropes.  But although the principle on which I acted was quite correct, the machinery was now so massive and heavy that the mere friction and stiffness of the thick cordage prevented me from moving it at all.  Afterwards, however, I came to proportion things more correctly; but I could not avoid reflecting at the time how much better it would have been had I learned all this from observation and study, instead of waiting till I was forced to acquire it through the painful and tedious lessons of experience.",weather seem settled fine get trade wind set preparation hoist top sail arduous task first attempt complete failure ow great degree reprehensible ignorance mechanical force first error make apply apparatus block pulley rope weak very first heave make break send staggering hatch trip strike main boom tumble companion ladder cabin bruise stunn untoward accident consider fortunate kill next attempt make sure come similar accident unreeve tackle fit large block rope principle act correct machinery massive heavy mere friction stiffness thick cordage prevent move come proportion thing avoid reflect time good have learn observation study wait force acquire painful tedious lesson experience 
6,"After the tackling was prepared and in good working order, it took me the greater part of a day to hoist the main-top sail.  As I could not steer and work at this at the same time, I lashed the helm in such a position that, with a little watching now and then, it kept the schooner in her proper course.  By this means I was enabled also to go about the deck and down below for things that I wanted, as occasion required; also to cook and eat my victuals.  But I did not dare to trust to this plan during the three hours of rest that I allowed myself at night, as the wind might have shifted, in which case I should have been blown far out of my course ere I awoke.  I was, therefore, in the habit of heaving-to during those three hours; that is, fixing the rudder and the sails in such a position as that by acting against each other, they would keep the ship stationary.  After my night's rest, therefore, I had only to make allowance for the lee-way she had made, and so resume my course.",tackle prepare good working order take great part day hoist main top sail steer work same time lash helm position little watch keep schooner proper course mean enable go deck thing want occasion require cook eat victual dare trust plan hour rest allow night wind shift case blow course awoke habit heave hour fix rudder sail position act other keep ship stationary night rest have make allowance way make resume course 
7,"Of course I was to some extent anxious lest another squall should come, but I made the best provision I could in the circumstances, and concluded that by letting go the weather-braces of the top-sails and the top-sail halyards at the same time, I should thereby render these sails almost powerless.  Besides this, I proposed to myself to keep a sharp look-out on the barometer in the cabin, and if I observed at any time a sudden fall in it, I resolved that I would instantly set about my multiform appliances for reducing sail, so as to avoid being taken at unawares. Thus I sailed prosperously for two weeks, with a fair wind, so that I calculated I must be drawing near to the Coral Island; at the thought of which my heart bounded with joyful expectation.",course extent anxious squall come make good provision circumstance conclude let go weather brace top sail top sail halyard same time render sail powerless propose keep sharp look barometer cabin observe time sudden fall resolve set multiform appliance reduce sail avoid take unawares sail week fair wind calculate draw coral thought heart bound joyful expectation 
8,"The only book I found on board, after a careful search, was a volume of Captain Cook's voyages.  This, I suppose, the pirate captain had brought with him in order to guide him, and to furnish him with information regarding the islands of these seas.  I found this a most delightful book indeed, and I not only obtained much interesting knowledge about the sea in which I was sailing, but I had many of my own opinions, derived from experience, corroborated; and not a few of them corrected.  Besides the reading of this charming book, and the daily routine of occupations, nothing of particular note happened to me during this voyage, except once, when on rising one night, after my three hours' nap, while it was yet dark, I was amazed and a little alarmed to find myself floating in what appeared to be a sea of blue fire!  I had often noticed the beautiful appearance of phosphorescent light, but this far exceeded anything of the sort I ever saw before.  The whole sea appeared somewhat like milk and was remarkably luminous.",only book find board careful search volume voyage suppose pirate captain bring order guide furnish information regard island sea find delightful book obtain interesting knowledge sea sail have many own opinion derive experience corroborate few correct reading charming book daily routine occupation particular note happen voyage rise night hour nap dark amazed little alarmed find float appear be sea blue fire notice beautiful appearance phosphorescent light exceed sort see whole sea appear milk luminous 
9,"I rose in haste, and, letting down a bucket into the sea, brought some of the water on board and took it down to the cabin to examine it; but no sooner did I approach the light than the strange appearance disappeared, and when I removed the cabin lamp the luminous light appeared again.  I was much puzzled with this, and took up a little of the water in the hollow of my hand and then let it run off, when I found that the luminous substance was left behind on my palm.  I ran with it to the lamp; but when I got there it was gone.  I found, however, that when I went into the dark my hand shone again; so I took the large glass of the ship's telescope and examined my hand minutely, when I found that there were on it one or two small patches of a clear, transparent substance like jelly, which were so thin as to be almost invisible to the naked eye.  Thus I came to know that the beautiful phosphoric light, which I had so often admired before, was caused by animals, for I had no doubt that these were of the same kind as the medusae or jelly-fish which are seen in all parts of the world.",rise haste let bucket sea bring water board take cabin examine approach light strange appearance disappear remove cabin lamp luminous light appear puzzled take little water hollow hand let run find luminous substance leave palm run lamp get gone find go dark hand shine take large glass ship telescope examine hand find be small patch clear transparent substance jelly thin invisible naked eye come know beautiful phosphoric light admire cause animal have doubt same kind medusae jelly fish see part world 
10,"On the evening of my fourteenth day, I was awakened out of a nap into which I had fallen by a loud cry, and starting up, I gazed around me.  I was surprised and delighted to see a large albatross soaring majestically over the ship.  I immediately took it into my head that this was the albatross I had seen at Penguin Island.  I had, of course, no good reason for supposing this, but the idea occurred to me, I know not why, and I cherished it, and regarded the bird with as much affection as if he had been an old friend.  He kept me company all that day and left me as night fell.",evening fourteenth day awaken nap fall loud cry start gaze surprise delighted see large albatross soar ship take head albatross see have course good reason suppose idea occur know cherish regard bird much affection old friend keep company day leave night fall 
11,"Next morning as I stood motionless and with heavy eyes at the helm, for I had not slept well, I began to weary anxiously for day-light, and peered towards the horizon, where I thought I observed something like a black cloud against the dark sky.  Being always on the alert for squalls, I ran to the bow.  There could be no doubt it was a squall, and as I listened I thought I heard the murmur of the coming gale.  Instantly I began to work might and main at my cumbrous tackle for shortening sail, and in the course of an hour and a half had the most of it reduced,--the top-sail yards down on the caps, the top-sails clewed up, the sheets hauled in, the main and fore peaks lowered, and the flying-jib down.  While thus engaged the dawn advanced, and I cast an occasional furtive glance ahead in the midst of my labour.  But now that things were prepared for the worst, I ran forward again and looked anxiously over the bow.  I now heard the roar of the waves distinctly, and as a single ray of the rising sun gleamed over the ocean I saw--what! could it be that I was dreaming?--that magnificent breaker with its ceaseless roar!--that mountain top!--yes, once more I beheld the Coral Island!",next morning stand motionless heavy eye helm sleep begin weary day light peer horizon think observe black cloud dark sky alert squall run bow be doubt squall listen think hear murmur come gale begin work main cumbrous tackle shorten sail course hour half have most reduce top sail yard cap top sail clew sheet haul main fore peak lower fly jib engage dawn advance cast occasional furtive glance midst labour thing prepare bad run look bow hear roar wave single ray rise sun gleam ocean see dreaming magnificent breaker ceaseless roar mountain top beheld coral
