98,"She ran as quickly as she could to the garden.  She had been away so much longer than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would have to set out early on his five-mile walk.  When she slipped through the door under the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left him.  The gardening tools were laid together under a tree.  She ran to them, looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen. He had gone away and the secret garden was empty--except for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watching her.  ""He's gone,"" she said woefully.

It was fastened on the bush with a long thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there.  There were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture.  At first she could not tell what it was.  Then she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it.
