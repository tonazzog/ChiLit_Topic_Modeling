2,"The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Mr Seagrave observed: ""Now that we have so many things to do, I think, Ready, we ought to lay down a plan of operations; method is everything when work is to be done: now tell me what you propose shall be our several occupations for the next week, for to-morrow is Sunday; and although we have not yet been able to honour the day as we should, I think that now we must and ought to keep it holy.""",next morning breakfast observe have many thing do think ready lay plan operation method work do tell propose several occupation next week able honour day think keep holy 
3,"""Yes, sir,"" replied Ready.  ""To-morrow we will rest from our labour, and ask God's blessing upon our endeavours during the six days of the week; and now, as to your proposition, Mr Seagrave, shall we begin first with the lady?""",sir reply ready rest labour ask blessing endeavour day week proposition begin lady 
4,"""You must not consider that you have ladies with you now, Ready,"" said Mrs Seagrave, ""at least, not fine ladies.  My health and strength are recovering fast, and I mean to be very useful.  I propose to assist Juno in all the domestic duties, such as the cookery and washing, to look after and teach the children, mend all the clothes, and make all that is required, to the best of my ability.  If I can do more I will.""",consider have lady ready say least fine lady health strength recover mean useful propose assist domestic duty such cookery washing look teach child mend clothes make require good ability do more 
5,"""I think we may be satisfied with that, Mr Seagrave,"" replied Ready. ""Now, sir, the two most pressing points, with the exception of building the house, are to dig up a piece of ground, and plant our potatoes and seeds; and to make a turtle-pond, so as to catch the turtle and put them in before the season is over.""",think satisfied reply ready sir press point exception build house dig piece ground plant potato seed make turtle pond catch turtle put season 
6,"""You are right,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""but which ought to be done first?""",right reply do 
7,"""I should say the turtle-pond, as it will be only a few days' work for you, Juno, and William.  I shall not want your assistance for this next week.  I shall fix upon some spot, not far from here, where the trees are thickest in the grove, and cut them down so as to clear out a space in which we will, by and by, build our storerooms; and, as soon as the rainy season has gone by, we can remove all our stores from the other side of the island.  It will occupy me the whole of the week, cutting down the trees and sawing them into proper lengths, ready for building the house, and then we must all join our strength and get it up without delay.""",say turtle pond few day work want assistance next week fix spot tree thickest grove cut clear space build storeroom rainy season go remove store other side island occupy whole week cut tree saw proper length ready build house join strength get delay 
8,"""Can you really manage to get it up in time?  How soon do you expect the rains will come on?""",manage get time expect rain come 
9,"""In three or four weeks.  After next week, I shall probably have the assistance of two of you, if not of all.  Now I think of it, I must return to the cove.""",week next week have assistance think return cove 
10,"""What for?""",
11,"""Don't you recollect, sir, your two-wheeled carriage, packed up in matting, which was thrown on shore in the gale?  You laughed when you saw it, and said it would be of little use now; but the wheels and axle will be very useful, as we can make a wide path to the place when I cut down the trees, and wheel out the logs much more easily than we can drag or carry them.""",recollect sir wheel carriage pack matting throw shore gale laugh see say little use wheel axle useful make wide path place cut tree wheel log drag carry 
12,"""That is an excellent idea.  It will save a great deal of labour.""",excellent idea save great deal labour 
13,"""I expect that it will, sir.  William and I will go away early on Monday morning, and be back before breakfast.  To-day we will fix upon the spots where our garden is to be, our turtle-pond to be made, and the trees to be cut down.  That shall be our business, Mr Seagrave; and William and Juno may put things a little more to rights here.""",expect sir go morning breakfast day fix spot garden turtle pond make tree cut business put thing little more right 
14,"Mr Seagrave and Ready then walked down to the beach, and, after surveying the reefs for some time, Ready said, ""You see, Mr Seagrave, we do not want too much water for a turtle-pond, as, if it is too deep, there is a difficulty in catching them when we want them: what we want is a space of water surrounded by a low wall of stones, so that the animals cannot escape, for they cannot climb up, although they can walk on the shelving sand with their flippers.  Now the reef here is high out of the water, and the space within the reef and the beach is deep enough, and the rocks on the beach nearly fill up that side and prevent them crawling away by the shore.  We have, therefore, little more to do than to fill up the two other sides, and then our pond will be complete.""",ready walk beach survey reef time ready say see want much water turtle pond deep be difficulty catching want want space water surround low wall stone animal escape climb walk shelving sand flipper reef high water space reef beach deep rock beach fill side prevent crawl shore little more do fill other side pond complete 
15,"""I see it will not be a long job either, if we can find loose rocks enough,"" replied Mr Seagrave.",see long job find loose rock reply 
16,"""Almost all those which are on the beach are loose,"" replied Ready, ""and there are plenty close to us: some of them will be too heavy to carry, but they can be brought here by the aid of handspikes and crowbars. Suppose we make a signal for William and Juno, and set them to work.""",beach loose reply ready be plenty close heavy carry bring aid handspike crowbar suppose make signal set work 
17,"Mr Seagrave called and waved his hat, and Juno and William came down to them.  Juno was ordered to go back for two handspikes, while Ready explained to William what was to be done.  Having stayed with them and assisted them for some time after Juno had returned with the implements, Mr Seagrave and Ready proceeded to the point, to fix upon a spot for a garden, leaving William and Juno to continue their labour.",call wave hat come order go handspike ready explain do stay assist time return implement ready proceed point fix spot garden leave continue labour
