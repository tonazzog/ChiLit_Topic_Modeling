3,"WE soon reached the Wallypug’s palace, which stood in a large park in the center of the city of Why. I had been very interested in noticing the curious architecture in the streets as we passed along, but was scarcely prepared to find the palace such a very remarkable place. It was a long, low, rambling building, built in a most singular style, with all sorts of curious towers and gables at every point.",reach palace stand large park center city interested notice curious architecture street pass prepare find palace remarkable place long low rambling building build singular style sort curious tower gable point 
4,"Oom Hi and the Kangaroo saw me as far as the entrance, and then took their departure, saying that they would see me again another day, and I walked up the stone steps, to what I imagined to be the principal door, alone. To my great surprise, however, I found that, instead of being the way in, it was nothing more or less than a huge jam-pot, with a very large label on it marked “Strawberry Jam,” while above it were the words, “When is a door not a door?” “When is a door not a door?” I repeated, vaguely conscious of having heard the question before.",see entrance take departure say see day walk stone step imagine principal door great surprise find way more less huge jam pot large label mark word door door door door repeat conscious hear question

6,"“Ha—ha—ha,” laughed a mocking voice at the bottom of the steps, and looking down I saw an enormous Cockatoo with a Paisley shawl over her shoulders and walking with the aid of a crutched stick.",laugh mocking voice bottom step look see enormous shawl shoulder walk aid crutch stick 
7,"“Sold again, were you? Serve you right,” she cried. “When is a door not a door? Pooh! fancy not knowing that old chestnut. Why! when it’s a jar, of course, stupid. Bah!”",sell serve cry door door fancy know old chestnut jar course stupid 
8,"“It’s a very absurd practical joke, that’s all that I can say,” I remarked, crossly, walking down the steps again. “Perhaps you can tell me how I am going to get into this remarkable place.”",absurd practical joke say remark walk step tell go get remarkable place 
9,"“Humph! Perhaps I can and perhaps I won’t,” said the Cockatoo. “I dare say it’s a better place than you came from, anyhow. You’re not the first man that has come down here with his superior airs and graces, grumbling and finding fault with this, that, and the other; but we’ll soon take the conceit out of you, I can tell you. Where’s your hat?”",humph say say good place come first man come superior air grace grumble find fault other take conceit tell hat 
10,"This was the second creature that had asked me this question, and really they threw so much scorn and contempt into the inquiry that one would imagine that it was a most disgraceful offense to be without a head covering.",second creature ask question throw much scorn contempt inquiry imagine disgraceful offense head covering 
11,"I thought the most dignified thing to do under the circumstances was to take no further notice of the bird, and was quietly walking away when the Cockatoo screamed out again, “Where’s your hat? Where’s your hat? Where’s your hat?” each time louder and louder, till the last inquiry ended in a perfect shriek.",think dignified thing do circumstance take further notice bird walk scream hat hat hat time louder louder last inquiry end perfect shriek

13,"“Down with the hatters!” screamed the Cockatoo irrelevantly, “Down with the Wallypug! Down with men without hats! Down with everybody and everything!” and the wretched bird danced about like a demented fury.",hatter scream man hat wretched bird dance demented fury 
14,"At the sound of all this commotion a number of windows in the upper stories of the palace were thrown open, and curious heads were popped out to see what was the matter. Among them and immediately over my head, I noticed the Doctor-in-Law.",sound commotion number window upper story palace throw open curious head pop see matter head notice 
15,"“Oh! it’s you, is it, kicking up all this fuss?” he remarked as soon as he recognized me.",kick fuss remark recognize 
16,"“Well, really!” I replied, “I think you might have the politeness to say ‘How do you do?’ considering that it is some months since we met.”",reply think have politeness say do consider month meet

19,Before I could answer the Cockatoo had screamed out “Down with the Doctor-in-Law!” and the irate little man had replied by throwing a book at her head out of the palace window.,answer scream irate little man reply throw book head palace window

21,"I was thoroughly disgusted at this behavior and at the strange reception that I was receiving, and had fully determined to try and find some way of getting home again, when, happening to turn round, I saw his Majesty the Wallypug himself running across the lawn towards me, with both hands stretched out in welcome, and his kind little face beaming with good nature.",disgusted behavior strange reception receive determine try find way get happen turn see run lawn hand stretch welcome kind little face beam good nature 
22,"“How d’ye do? How d’ye do?” he cried. “So pleased to see you. Didn’t expect you quite so soon, though. Come along—this way.” And his Majesty led me to another entrance, and through a large square hall hung with tapestry and many quaint pieces of old-fashioned armor, to a door marked “His Majesty the Wallypug. Strictly private.” I noticed, in passing, that the words, “His Majesty” had been partly painted out, and “What cheek!” written above them. Once inside the door, the Wallypug motioned me to a chair, and said, in a mysterious whisper,",d’ye cry pleased see expect come way lead entrance large square hall hang tapestry many quaint piece old fashioned armor door mark private notice passing word paint cheek write door motion chair say mysterious whisper

28,"“But how on earth can you possibly have a sister-in-law, unless you have a wife or a married brother?” I asked.",earth have sister law have wife marry brother ask 
29,"“Well, I’ve never quite been able to understand _how_ they make it out,” said the poor Wallypug, sorrowfully; “but I believe it is something mixed up with the Deceased Wife’s Sister’s Bill, and the fact that my uncle, The Grand Mochar of Gamboza, was married twice. Anyhow, when I returned from London I found this lady, who _says_ that she is my sister-in-law, established here in the palace; and—and—” his Majesty sank his voice to a whisper, “she rules me with a rod of iron.”",able understand make say poor believe mix deceased fact uncle grand marry return find lady sister law establish palace sink voice whisper rule rod iron 
30,"I had no time to make further inquiries, for just then the door opened, and a majestic-looking person sailed into the room, and after looking me up and down with elevated eyebrows, pointed her finger at me, and said, in a stern voice:",have time make further inquiry door open majestic look person sail room look elevate eyebrow point finger say stern voice

37,"“I haven’t one,” I replied, rather abruptly, I am afraid, but I was getting quite tired of this continual cross-questioning; “and really I don’t see that it’s of the slightest consequence,” I ventured to add.",reply afraid get tired continual cross -question see slight consequence venture add 
38,"“Oh! don’t you,” said his Majesty’s Sister-in-Law, with a sarcastic smile. “Well, that’s one of the _many_ points upon which we shall disagree. Now, look here, I may tell you at once that I don’t approve of you in the least; still, as you are here now you had better remain; but mind, no putting on parts or giving yourself airs and graces, or I shall have something to say to you. Do you understand?” And with a severe glance at me, the lady folded her arms and stalked out of the room, leaving his Majesty and myself staring blankly at one another.",say sarcastic smile point disagree look tell approve least good remain mind put part give air grace have say understand severe glance lady fold arm stalked room leave stare
