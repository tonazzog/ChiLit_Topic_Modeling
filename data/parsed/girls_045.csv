1,CHAPTER 45. TIGER.,
2,"It was still very, very early in the morning, and the gipsy folk, tired from their march on the preceding day, slept.  There stood the conical, queer-shaped tents, four in number; at a little distance off grazed the donkeys and a couple of rough mules; at the door of the tents lay stretched out in profound repose two or three dogs.",morning gipsy folk tired march preced day sleep stand conical queer shape tent number little distance graze donkey couple rough mule door tent stretch profound repose dog 
3,"Annie dreaded the barking of the dogs, although she guessed that if they set up a noise, and a gipsy wife or man put out their heads in consequence, they would only desire the gipsy child to lie down and keep quiet.",dread barking dog guess set noise gipsy wife man put head consequence desire gipsy child lie keep quiet 
4,"She stood still for a moment--she was very anxious to prowl around the place and examine the ground while the gipsies still slept, but the watchful dogs deterred her.  She stood perfectly quiet behind the hedge-row, thinking hard.  Should she trust to a charm she knew she possessed, and venture into the encampment?  Annie had almost as great a fascination over dogs and cats as she had over children.  As a little child going to visit with her mother at strange houses, the watch-dogs never barked at her; on the contrary, they yielded to the charm which seemed to come from her little fingers as she patted their great heads. Slowly their tails would move backwards and forwards as she petted them, and even the most ferocious would look at her with affection.",stand moment anxious prowl place examine ground gipsie sleep watchful dog deterre stand quiet hedge row think trust charm know possess venture encampment have great fascination dog cat have child little child go visit mother strange house watch dog bark contrary yield charm seem come little finger patt great head tail move forward pett ferocious look affection 
5,"Annie wondered if the gipsy dogs would now allow her to approach without barking.  She felt that the chances were in her favour; she was dressed in gipsy garments, there would be nothing strange in her appearance, and if she could get near one of the dogs she knew that she could exercise the magic of her touch.",wonder gipsy dog allow approach bark feel chance favour dress gipsy garment be strange appearance get dog know exercise magic touch 
6,"Her object, then, was to approach one of the tents very, very quietly-- so softly that even the dog's ears should not detect the light footfall. If she could approach close enough to put her hand on the dog's neck all would be well.  She pulled off the gipsy maid's rough shoes, hid them in the grass where she could find them again, and came gingerly, step by step, nearer and nearer the principal tent.  At its entrance lay a ferocious-looking half-bred bull-dog.  Annie possessed that necessary accompaniment to courage--great outward calm; the greater the danger, the more cool and self-possessed did she become.  She was within a step or two of the tent when she trod accidentally on a small twig: it cracked, giving her foot a sharp pain, and, very slight as the sound was, causing the bull-dog to awake.  He raised his wicked face, saw the figure like his own people, and yet unlike, but a step or two away, and, uttering a low growl, sprang forward.",object approach tent dog ear detect light footfall approach put hand dog neck well pull gipsy maid rough shoe hide grass find come step step nearer principal tent entrance lay ferocious look half breed bull dog possess necessary accompaniment courage great outward calm great danger cool self possess become step tent trod small twig crack give foot sharp pain slight sound cause bull dog awake raise wicked face see figure own person step utter low growl spring 
7,"In the ordinary course of things this growl would have risen in volume and would have terminated in a volley of barking; but Annie was prepared: she went down on her knees, held out her arms, said, ""Poor fellow!"" in her own seductive voice, and the bull-dog fawned at her feet.  He licked one of her hands while she patted him gently with the other.",ordinary course thing growl rise volume terminate volley barking prepare go knee hold arm say poor fellow own seductive voice bull dog fawn foot lick hand patt other 
8,"""Come, poor fellow,"" she said then in a gentle tone, and Annie and the dog began to perambulate round the tents.",come poor fellow say gentle tone dog begin perambulate tent 
9,"The other dogs raised sleepy eyes, but seeing Tiger and the girl together, took no notice whatever, except by a thwack or two of their stumpy tails.  Annie was now looking not only at the tents, but for something else which Zillah, her nurse, had told her might be found near to many gipsy encampments.  This was a small subterranean passage, which generally led into a long-disused underground Danish fort.  Zillah had told her what uses the gipsies liked to make of these underground passages, and how they often chose those which had two entrances.  She told her that in this way they eluded the police, and were enabled successfully to hide the goods which they stole.  She had also described to her their great ingenuity in hiding the entrances to these underground retreats.",other dog raise sleepy eye see girl take notice thwack stumpy tail look tent else nurse tell find many gipsy encampment small subterranean passage lead long disuse underground danish fort tell use gipsie like make underground passage choose have entrance tell way elude police enable hide goods steal describe great ingenuity hide entrance underground retreat 
10,"Annie's idea now was that little Nan was hidden in one of these vaults, and she determined first to make sure of its existence, and then to venture herself into this underground region in search of the lost child.",idea little hide vault determine first make sure existence venture underground region search lose child 
11,"She had made a decided conquest in the person of Tiger, who followed her round and round the tents, and when the gipsies at last began to stir and Annie crept into the hedge-row, the dog crouched by her side.  Tiger was the favourite dog of the camp, and presently one of the men called to him; he rose unwillingly, looked back with longing eyes at Annie, and trotted off, to return in the space of about five minutes with a great bunch of broken bread in his mouth.  This was his breakfast, and he meant to share it with his new friend.  Annie was too hungry to be fastidious, and she also knew the necessity of keeping up her strength. She crept still farther under the hedge, and the dog and girl shared the broken bread between them.",make decide conquest person follow round tent gipsie last begin stir creep hedge row dog crouch side favourite dog camp man call rise look longing eye trotet return space minute great bunch break bread mouth breakfast mean share new friend hungry fastidious know necessity keep strength creep hedge dog girl share break bread 
12,"Presently the tents were all astir; the gipsy children began to swarm about, the women lit fires in the open air, and the smell of very appetising breakfasts filled the atmosphere.  The men also lounged into view, standing lazily at the doors of their tents, and smoking great pipes of tobacco.  Annie lay quiet.  She could see from her hiding-place without being seen.  Suddenly--and her eyes began to dilate, and she found her heart beating strangely--she laid her hand on Tiger, who was quivering all over.",tent astir gipsy child begin swarm woman light fire open air smell appetising breakfast fill atmosphere man lounge view stand door tent smoke great pipe tobacco lay quiet see hiding place see eye begin dilate find heart beat lay hand quiver 
13,"""Stay with me, dear dog,"" she said.",stay dear dog say 
14,"There was a great commotion and excitement in the gipsy camp; the children screamed and ran into the tents, the women paused in their preparation for breakfast, the men took their short pipes out of their mouths; every dog, with the exception of Tiger, barked ferociously. Tiger and Annie alone were motionless.",be great commotion excitement gipsy camp child scream run tent woman pause preparation breakfast man take short pipe mouth dog exception bark motionless 
15,"The cause of all this uproar was a body of police, about six in number, who came boldly into the field, and demanded instantly to search the tents.",cause uproar body police number come field demand search tent 
16,"""We want a woman who calls herself Mother Rachel,"" they said.  ""She belongs to this encampment.  We know her: let her come forward at once; we wish to question her.""",want woman call say belong encampment know let come wish question 
17,"The men stood about; the women came near; the children crept out of their tents, placing their fingers to their frightened lips, and staring at the men who represented those horrors to their unsophisticated minds called Law and Order.",man stand woman come child creep tent place finger frighten lip stare man represent horror unsophisticated mind call 
18,"""We must search the tents.  We won't stir from the spot until we have had an interview with Mother Rachel,"" said the principal member of the police force.",search tent stir spot have interview say principal member police force 
19,The men answered respectfully that the gipsy mother was not yet up; but if the gentlemen would wait a moment she would soon come and speak to them.,man answer gipsy mother gentleman wait moment come speak 
20,"The officers expressed their willingness to wait, and collected round the tents.",officer express willingness wait collect tent 
21,"Just at this instant, under the hedge-row, Tiger raised his head. Annie's watchful eyes accompanied the dog's.  He was gazing after a tiny gipsy maid who was skulking along the hedge, and who presently disappeared through a very small opening into the neighbouring field.",instant hedge row raise head watchful eye accompany dog gaze tiny gipsy maid skulk hedge disappear small opening neighbour field 
22,"Quick as thought Annie, holding Tiger's collar, darted after her.  The little maid heard the footsteps: but seeing another gipsy girl, and their own dog, Tiger, she took no further notice, but ran openly and very swiftly across the field until she came to a broken wall.  Here she tugged and tugged at some loose stones, managed to push one away, and then called down into the ground--",quick think hold collar dart little maid hear footstep see gipsy girl own dog take further notice run field come break wall tug tug loose stone manage push call ground 
23,"""Mother Rachel!""",
24,"""Come, Tiger,"" said Annie.  She flew to a hedge not far off, and once more the dog and she hid themselves.  The small girl was too excited to notice either their coming or going; she went on calling anxiously into the ground--",come say fly hedge dog hide small girl excited notice come go go call ground 
25,"""Mother Rachel!  Mother Rachel!""",mother mother 
26,"Presently a black head and a pair of brawny shoulders appeared, and the tall woman whose face and figure Annie knew so well stepped up out of the ground, pushed back the stones into their place, and, taking the gipsy child into her arms, ran swiftly across the field in the direction of the tents.",black head pair brawny shoulder appear tall woman face figure know step ground push stone place take gipsy child arm run field direction tent
