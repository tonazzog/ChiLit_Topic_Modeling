4,"""You'd better stick about in my room while I'm in school,"" said Oliver, ""and then you can come down to the cricket-field and see the practice. By the way, some of the fellows may be in to bag my ink; they always run short on Friday; but don't let them take it, for I shall want it to-night.

6,"That young gentleman was at no loss how to occupy part of the time.  He must write home.  So after much searching he unearthed a crumpled sheet of note-paper from one of the drawers, and set himself to his task.  As he wrote, and his thoughts flew back to the home and the mother he had left only yesterday, his spirits fell, and the home-sickness came over him worse than ever.

7,"Here, no one cared for him, every one seemed to despise him.  He wasn't used to those rough public schools, and would never get on at Saint Dominic's.  Ah! that wretched Tenth Fiji War.

Even Oliver seemed determined to let him fight his own battles.",care one seem despise use rough public school get wretch tenth _would_ become be help seem determined let fight own battle

He was inclined to believe it the latter; and as he was a rash youth, he somewhat tartly replied, ""_You_ won't!""",loss receive piece news light information threat inclined believe latter rash youth reply 
31,"The small boy looked astounded--not that he ever contemplated attempting the chastisement about which he had talked; but the idea of a new boy defying _him_, one of the chosen leaders of the Tadpoles, who had been at Saint Dominic's two years, was amazing.  He glared at the rash Stephen for half a minute, and then broke out, ""Won't I? that's all! you see, you pretty little blubber boy!

Go and kiss your mammy, and tell your big brother what they did to little duckie Steevie, did they then? they shouldn't!

64,"""Now you can go, sir!"" and without another word he led the small youth, down whose face trickled a dozen tiny streams of black, making it look very like a gridiron, to the door, and there gently but firmly handed him into the passage.

65,"Pembury meanwhile returned to Stephen.  That young gentleman had felt his belief in Pembury's authority somewhat shaken by this unusual mode of punishment, but the Fifth Form boy soon reassumed his ascendency.  He produced from his pocket a paper, and thus addressed Stephen: ""Dr Senior regrets that he should be absent at such an important time in the history of Saint Dominic's as the day of your arrival, Master Greenfield, but he will be back to-morrow.  Meanwhile, you are to occupy yourself with answering the questions on this paper, and take the answers to the head master's study at ten to-morrow.  Of course you will not be so dishonourable as to show the questions to any one, not even your brother, or attempt to get the slightest help in answering them. Good-bye, my boy.

66,"Poor Stephen felt so confused by the whole of this oration, particularly the last sentence, which made him blush scarlet with shame, that for some time after the lame boy had hobbled off he could not bring himself to look at the paper.  At last, however, he took it up.",poor feel confused whole oration last sentence make blush scarlet shame time lame boy hobble bring look paper last take
