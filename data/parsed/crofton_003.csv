2,"Hugh was about to ask his mother, again and again during their walk, why Mr Tooke let him go to Crofton before he was ten; but Mrs Proctor was grave and silent; and though she spoke kindly to him now and then, she did not seem disposed to talk.  At last they were in the Temple Garden; and they sat down where there was no one to overhear them; and then Hugh looked up at his mother.  She saw, and told him, what it was that he wanted to ask.",about ask mother walk let go grave silent speak seem dispose talk last sit be overhear look mother see tell want ask

4,"""But there is Mrs Watson.  Phil has told me a hundred things about Mrs Watson.""",be tell thing 
5,"""Mrs Watson is the housekeeper.  She is careful, I know, about the boys' health and comfort; but she has no time to attend to the younger ones, as Mrs Tooke did,--hearing their little troubles, and being a friend to them like their mothers at home.""",housekeeper careful know boy health comfort have time attend young one hear little trouble friend mother home

7,"""Yes.  You will have Phil to look to.  But neither Phil, nor any one else, can save you from some troubles you are likely to have from being the youngest.""",have look one else save trouble likely have young

9,"""So we hope, and so we believe.  Your fault is not cowardice--""",hope believe fault cowardice 
10,"Mrs Proctor so seldom praised anybody that her words of esteem went a great way.  Hugh first looked up at her, and then down on the grass,-- his cheeks glowed so.  She went on--",praise word esteem go great way look grass cheek glow go 
11,"""You have faults,--faults which give your father and me great pain; and though you are not cowardly about being hurt in your body, you sadly want courage of a better kind,--courage to mend the weakness of your mind.  You are so young that we are sorry for you, and mean to send you where the example of other boys may give you the resolution you want so much.""",have fault fault give father great pain cowardly hurt body want courage good kind courage mend weakness mind young sorry mean send example other boy give resolution want much 
12,"""All the boys learn their lessons at Crofton,"" observed Hugh.",boy learn lesson observe 
13,"""Yes; but not by magic.  They have to give their minds to their work. You will find it painful and difficult to learn this, after your idle habits at home.  I give you warning that you will find it much more difficult than you suppose; and I should not wonder if you wish yourself at home with Miss Harold many times before Christmas.""",magic have give mind work find painful difficult learn idle habit home give warning find difficult suppose wonder wish home many time 
14,"Mrs Proctor was not unkind in saying this.  She saw that Hugh was so delighted about going that nothing would depress his spirits, and that the chief fear was his being disappointed and unhappy when she should be far away.  It might then be some consolation to him to remember that she was aware of what he would have to go through.  He now smiled, and said he did not think he should ever wish to say his lessons to Miss Harold as long as he lived.  Then it quickly passed through his mind that, instead of the leads and the little yard, there would be the playground; and instead of the church bells, the rooks; and instead of Susan, with her washing and combing, and scolding and kissing, there would be plenty of boys to play with.  As he thought of these things, he started up, and toppled head over heels on the grass, and then was up by his mother's side again, saying that he did not care about anything that was to happen at Crofton;--he was not afraid,--not even of the usher, though Phil could not bear him.",unkind say see delighted go depress spirit chief fear disappoint unhappy consolation remember aware have go smile say think wish say lesson live pass mind lead little yard be playground church bell rook washing comb scold kiss be plenty boy play think thing start topple head heel grass mother side say care happen afraid usher bear

16,"After this, there was only to settle the time that was to pass--the weeks, days, and hours before Michaelmas-day; and whether these weeks and days should be employed in preparing for Crofton under Miss Harold, or whether he should take his chance there unprepared as he was.  Mrs Proctor saw that his habits of inattention were so fixed, and his disgust at lessons in the parlour so strong, that she encouraged his doing no lessons in the interval.  Hugh would have said beforehand that three weeks' liberty to read voyages and travels, and play with Harry, would have made him perfectly happy; but he felt that there was some disgrace mixed up with his holiday, and that everybody would look upon him with a sort of pity, instead of wishing him joy; and this spoiled his pleasure a good deal.  When he came home from his walk, Agnes thought he looked less happy than when he went out; and she feared his spirits were down about Crofton.",be settle time pass week day hour day week day employ prepare take chance unprepared see habit inattention fix disgust lesson parlour strong encourage do lesson interval say week liberty read voyage travel play make happy feel be disgrace mix holiday look sort pity wish joy spoiled pleasure good deal come walk think look happy go fear spirit 
17,"His spirits were up and down many times during the next three weeks.  He thought these weeks would never be over.  Every day dragged on more slowly than the last; at every meal he was less inclined to eat; and his happiest time was when going to bed, because he was a day nearer Crofton.  His mother, foreseeing just what happened, wished to have kept the news from him till within a week of his departure, and had agreed with Mr Proctor that it should be so.  But Mr Proctor hated secrets, and, as we see, let it out immediately.",spirit many time next week think week day drag last meal inclined eat happy time go bed day nearer mother foresee happen wish keep news week departure agree hate secret see let 
18,"At last, the day came;--a warm, sunny, autumn day, on which any one might have enjoyed the prospect of a drive into the country.  The coach was to set off from an inn in Fleet Street, at noon, and would set Hugh down at his uncle's door in time for dinner, the distance being twenty-eight miles.  His uncle's house was just two miles from the school.  Phil would probably be there to meet his brother, and take him to Crofton in the afternoon.",last day come warm sunny autumn day one enjoy prospect drive country coach set inn noon set uncle door time dinner distance mile uncle house mile school meet brother take afternoon 
19,"How to get rid of the hours till noon was the question.  Hugh had had everything packed up, over which he had any control, for some days.  He had not left himself a plaything of those which he might carry: and it frightened him that his mother did not seem to think of packing his clothes till after breakfast this very morning.  When she entered his room for the purpose, he was fidgeting about, saying to himself that he should never be ready.  Agnes came with her mother, to help: but before the second shirt was laid in the box, she was in tears and had to go away; for every one in the house was in the habit of hiding tears from Mrs Proctor, who rarely shed them herself, and was known to think that they might generally be suppressed, and should be so.",get rid hour noon question have pack have control day leave plaything carry frighten mother seem think pack clothes breakfast very morning enter room purpose fidget say ready come mother help second shirt lay box tear have go one house habit hide tear shed know think suppress 
20,"As Hugh stood beside her, handing stockings and handkerchiefs, to fill up the corners of the box, she spoke as she might not have done if they had not been alone.  She said but a few words; but Hugh never forgot them.",stand hand stocking handkerchief fill corner box speak do alone say few word forget 
21,"""You know, my dear,"" said she, ""that I do not approve of dwelling upon troubles.  You know I never encourage my children to fret about what cannot be helped.""",know dear say approve dwelling trouble know encourage child fret help 
22,There was nothing in the world that Hugh was more certain of than this.,be world certain 
23,"""And yet I tell you,"" she continued, ""that you will not be nearly so happy at Crofton as you expect--at least, at first.  It grieves me to see you so full of expectation--""",tell continue happy expect least first grieve see full expectation 
24,"""Does it indeed, mother?""",mother

27,"""I think you are a brave boy, on the whole.  But that is not the comfort I was speaking of; for there is a world of troubles too heavy for the bravery of a thoughtless child, like you.  My comfort is, my dear, that you know where to go for strength when your heart fails you.  You will be away from your father and me; but a far wiser and kinder parent will be always with you.  If I were not sure that you would continually open your heart to Him, I could not let you go from me.""",think brave boy whole comfort speak be world trouble heavy bravery thoughtless child comfort dear know go strength heart fail father wise kind parent sure open heart let go 
28,"""I will--I always do,"" said Hugh, in a low voice.  ""Then remember this, my boy.  If you have that help, _you must not fail_.  Knowing that you have that help, I expect of you that you do your own duty, and bear your own troubles, like a man.  If you were to be all alone in the new world you are going to, you would be but a helpless child: but remember, when a child makes God his friend, God puts into the youngest and weakest the spirit of a man.""",do say low voice remember boy have help fail_ know have help expect do own duty bear own trouble man alone new world go helpless child remember child make friend put young weak spirit man

31,"""And steady,"" replied Hugh, casting down his eyes; ""for that is what I want most of all.""",steady reply cast eye want most 
32,"""It is,"" replied his mother.  ""I do, and always will, pray for you.""",reply mother pray 
33,"Not another word was said till they went down into the parlour.  Though it was only eleven o'clock, Miss Harold was putting on her bonnet to go away: and there was a plate of bread and cheese on the table.",word say go parlour o'clock put bonnet go be plate bread cheese table 
34,"""Lunch!"" said Hugh, turning away with disgust.  ""Do eat it,"" said Agnes, who had brought it.  ""You had no breakfast, you know.""",lunch say turn disgust eat say bring have breakfast know 
35,"""Because I did not want it; and I can't eat anything now.""",want eat 
36,"Jane made a sign to Agnes to take the plate out of sight: and she put some biscuits into a paper bag, that he might eat on the road, if he should become hungry.",make sign take plate sight put biscuit paper bag eat road become hungry 
37,"Neither Miss Harold nor Hugh could possibly feel any grief at parting; for they had had little satisfaction together; but she said very kindly that she should hope to hear often of him, and wished he might be happy as a Crofton boy.  Hugh could hardly answer her;--so amazed was he to find that his sisters were giving up an hour of their lessons on his account,--that they might go with him to the coach!--And then Susan came in, about the cord for his box, and her eyes were red:--and, at the sight of her, Agnes began to cry again; and Jane bent down her head over the glove she was mending for him, and her needle stopped.",feel grief parting have little satisfaction say hope hear wish happy boy answer amazed find sister give hour lesson account go coach come cord box eye red sight begin cry bend head glove mend needle stop 
38,"""Jane,"" said her mother, gravely, ""if you are not mending that glove, give it to me.  It is getting late.""",say mother mend glove give get late 
39,"Jane brushed her hand across her eyes, and stitched away again.  Then she threw the gloves to Hugh without looking at him, and ran to get ready to go to the coach.",brush hand eye stitch throw glove look run get ready go coach 
40,"The bustle of the inn-yard would not do for little Harry.  He could not go.  Hugh was extremely surprised to find that all the rest were going;--that even his father was smoothing his hat in the passage for the walk,--really leaving the shop at noon on his account!  The porter was at his service too,--waiting for his box!  It was very odd to feel of such consequence.",bustle inn- yard do little go surprised find rest go father smooth hat passage walk leave shop noon account porter service wait box odd feel such consequence 
41,"Hugh ran down to bid the maids good-bye.  The cook had cut a sandwich, which she thrust into his pocket, though he told her he had some biscuits.  Susan cried so that little Harry stood grave and wondering. Susan sobbed out that she knew he did not care a bit about leaving home and everybody.  Hugh wished she would not say so, though he felt it was true, and wondered at it himself.  Mr Proctor heard Susan's lamentations, and called to her from the passage above not to make herself unhappy about that; for the time would soon come when Hugh would be homesick enough.",run bid maid good bye cook cut sandwich thrust pocket tell have biscuit cry little stand grave wonder sobb know care bit leave wish say feel true wonder hear lamentation call passage make unhappy time come homesick 
42,"Mr Blake, the shopman, came to the shop-door as they passed, and bowed and smiled; and the boy put himself in the way, with a broad grin: and then the party walked on quickly.",shopman come shop door pass bow smile boy put way broad grin party walk 
43,"The sun seemed to Hugh to glare very much; and he thought he had never known the streets so noisy, or the people so pushing.  The truth was, his heart was beating so he could scarcely see: and yet he was so busy looking about him for a sight of the river, and everything he wished to bid good-bye to, that his father, who held him fast by the hand, shook him more than once, and told him he would run everybody down if he could,--to judge by his way of walking.  He must learn to march better, if he was to be a soldier; and to steer, if he was to be a sailor.",sun seem glare think know street noisy person push truth heart beat see busy look sight river wish bid good bye father hold hand shake more tell run judge way walk learn march soldier steer sailor 
44,"There were just two minutes to spare when they reached the inn-yard. The horses were pawing and fidgeting, and some of the passengers had mounted: so Mr Proctor said he would seat the boy at once.  He spoke to two men who were on the roof, just behind the coachman; and they agreed to let Hugh sit between them, on the assurance that the driver would look to his concerns, and see that he was set down at the right place.",be minute spare reach inn-yard horse paw fidget passenger mount say seat boy speak man roof coachman agree let sit assurance driver look concern see set right place 
45,"""Now, my boy, up with you!"" said his father, as he turned from speaking to these men.  Hugh was so eager, that he put up his foot to mount, without remembering to bid his mother and sisters good-bye.  Mr Proctor laughed at this; and nobody wondered; but Agnes cried bitterly; and she could not forget it, from that time till she saw her brother again. When they had all kissed him, and his mother's earnest look had bidden him remember what had passed between them that morning, he was lifted up by his father, and received by the two men, between whom he found a safe seat.",boy say father turn speak man eager put foot mount remember bid mother sister good bye laugh wonder cry forget time see brother kiss mother earnest look bidd remember pass morning lift father receive man find safe seat 
46,"Then he wished they were off.  It was uncomfortable to see his sisters crying there, and not to be able to cry too, or to speak to them.  When the coachman was drawing on his second glove, and the ostlers held each a hand to pull off the horse-cloths, and the last moment was come, Mr Proctor swung himself up by the step, to say one thing more.  It was--",wish uncomfortable see sister cry able cry speak coachman draw second glove ostler hold hand pull horse cloth last moment come swing step say thing more 
47,"""I say, Hugh,--can you tell me,--how much is four times seven?""",say tell much time 
48,"Mrs Proctor pulled her husband's coat-tail, and he leaped down, the horses' feet scrambled, their heads issued from the gateway of the inn-yard, and Hugh's family were left behind.  In the midst of the noise, the man on Hugh's right-hand said to the one on his left,--",pull husband coat tail leap horse foot scramble head issue gateway inn-yard family leave midst noise man right hand say one left 
49,"""There is some joke in that last remark, I imagine.""",be joke last remark imagine 
50,"The other man nodded; and then there was no more speaking till they were off the stones.  When the clatter was over, and the coach began to roll along the smooth road, Hugh's neighbour repeated,--",other man nod be more speak stone clatter coach begin roll smooth road neighbour repeat 
51,"""There was some joke, I fancy, in that last remark of your father's.""",be joke fancy last remark father 
52,"""Yes,"" said Hugh.",say

54,"""Exceedingly happy,"" observed the first.",happy observe first 
55,"""I never say it when I can help it,"" said Hugh; ""and I see no occasion now.""",say help say see occasion 
56,"The men laughed, and then asked him if he was going far.",man laugh ask go 
57,"""To Crofton.  I am going to be a Crofton boy,"" said Hugh.",go boy say 
58,"""A what?  Where is he going?"" his companions asked one another over his head.  They were no wiser when Hugh repeated what he had said; nor could the coachman enlighten them.  He only knew that he was to put the boy down at Shaw's, the great miller's, near thirty miles along the road.",go companion ask head wise repeat say coachman enlighten know put boy great miller mile road 
59,"""Eight-and-twenty,"" said Hugh, in correction; ""and Crofton is two miles from my uncle's.""",say correction mile uncle 
60,"""Eight-and-twenty.  The father's joke lies there,"" observed the right-hand man.",father joke lie observe right hand man 
61,"""No, it does not,"" said Hugh.  He thought he was among a set of very odd people,--none of them knowing what a Crofton boy was.  A passenger who sat beside the coachman only smiled when he was appealed to; so it might be concluded that he was ignorant too; and the right and left-hand men seemed so anxious for information, that Hugh told them all he knew;-- about the orchard and the avenue, and the pond on the heath, and the playground; and Mrs Watson, and the usher, and Phil, and Joe Cape, and Tony Nelson, and several others of the boys.",say think set odd person know boy passenger sit coachman smile appeal conclude ignorant right left hand man seem anxious information tell know orchard avenue pond heath playground usher several other boy 
62,"One of the men asked him if he was sure he was going for the first time,--he seemed so thoroughly informed of everything about Crofton. Hugh replied that it was a good thing to have an elder brother like Phil.  Phil had told him just what to take to Crofton, and how to take care of his money, and everything.",man ask sure go first time seem inform reply good thing have elder brother tell take take care money 
63,"""Ay!  And how do the Crofton boys take care of their money?""",boy take care money 
64,"Hugh showed a curious little inner pocket in his jacket, which nobody would dream of that did not know.  His mother had let him have such a pocket in both his jackets; and he had wanted to have all his money in this one now, to show how safely he could carry it.  But his mother had chosen to pack up all his five shillings in his box,--that square box, with the new brass lock, on the top of all the luggage.  In his pocket there was only sixpence now,--the sixpence he was to give the coachman when he was set down.",show curious little inner pocket jacket dream know mother let have pocket jacket want have money one show carry mother choose pack shilling box square box new brass lock top luggage pocket be sixpence give coachman set 
65,"Then he went on to explain that this sixpence was not out of his own money, but given him by his father, expressly for the coachman.  Then his right-hand companion congratulated him upon his spirits, and began to punch and tickle him; and when Hugh writhed himself about, because he could not bear tickling, the coachman said he would have no such doings, and bade them be quiet.  Then the passengers seemed to forget Hugh, and talked to one another of the harvest in the north, and the hopping in Kent.  Hugh listened about the hopping, supposing it might be some new game, as good as leap-frog; though it seemed strange that one farmer should begin hopping on Monday, and that another should fix Thursday; and that both should be so extremely anxious about the weather.  But when he found it was some sort of harvest-work, he left off listening, and gave all his attention to the country sights that were about him. He did not grow tired of the gardens, gay with dahlias and hollyhocks, and asters: nor of the orchards, where the ladder against the tree, and the basket under, showed that apple-gathering was going on; nor of the nooks in the fields, where blackberries were ripening; nor of the chequered sunlight and shadow which lay upon the road; nor of the breezy heath where the blue ponds were ruffled; nor of the pleasant grove where the leaves were beginning to show a tinge of yellow and red, here and there among the green.  Silently he enjoyed all these things, only awakening from them when there was a stop to change horses.",go explain sixpence own money give father coachman right hand companion congratulate spirit begin punch tickle writh bear tickling coachman say have such doing bid quiet passenger seem forget talk harvest north hopping listen hopping suppose new game good leap frog seem strange farmer begin hopping fix anxious weather find sort harvest work leave listen give attention country sight grow tired garden gay dahlia hollyhock aster orchard ladder tree basket show apple gathering go nook field blackberry ripen chequer sunlight shadow lay road breezy heath blue pond ruffle pleasant grove leave begin show tinge yellow red green enjoy thing awaken be stop change horse 
66,"He was not thinking of time or distance when he saw the coachman glance round at him, and felt that the speed of the horses was slackening. Still he had no idea that this was any concern of his, till he saw something that made him start.",think time distance see coachman glance feel speed horse slacken have idea concern see make start

68,"""This is Shaw's mill, and there is Shaw; which is all I have to do with,"" said the coachman, as he pulled up.",mill be have do say coachman pull 
69,"Hugh was soon down, with his uncle and Phil, and one of the men from the mill to help.  His aunt was at the window too; so that altogether Hugh forgot to thank his companions for his safe seat.  He would have forgotten his box, but for the coachman.  One thing more he also forgot.",uncle man mill help aunt window forget thank companion safe seat forget box coachman thing more forget 
70,"""I say, young master,"" said the driver, ""remember the coachman.  Where's your sixpence?""",say young master say driver remember coachman sixpence

""Thank you for teaching us the secret of such a curious pocket.""",find hole pocket sixpence cry right hand passenger toss own sixpence thank teach secret curious pocket 
73,"The coachman was impatient, got his money, and drove off, leaving Hugh to make out why he had been tickled, and how his money had changed hands.  With a very red face, he declared it was too bad of the man: but the man was out of his hearing, and could never know how angry he was.",coachman impatient get money drive leave make tickle money change hand red face declare bad man man hearing know angry
