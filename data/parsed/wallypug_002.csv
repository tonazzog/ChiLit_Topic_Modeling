1,CHAPTER I. HOW I WENT TO WHY.,chapter i. went 
2," FOR some time past I have been the guest of his Majesty the Wallypug at his palace in the mysterious kingdom of Why—a country so remarkable that even now I am only just beginning to get used to my strange surroundings and stranger neighbors. Imagine, if you can, a place where all of the animals not only talk, but take an active part in the government of the land, a place where one is as likely as not to receive an invitation to an evening party from an ostrich, or is expected to escort an elderly rhinoceros in to dinner; where it is quite an everyday occurrence to be called upon by a hen with a brood of young chickens just as you are sitting down to tea, and be expected to take a lively interest in her account of how the youngest chick passed through its latest attack of the “pip.”",time guest palace mysterious kingdom country remarkable begin use strange surroundings stranger neighbor imagine place animal talk take active part government land place likely receive invitation evening party ostrich expect escort elderly rhinocero dinner everyday occurrence call hen brood young chicken sit tea expect take lively interest account young chick pass late attack pip 
3,"In such a country, the unexpected is always happening, and I am continually being startled in the streets at being addressed by some dangerous-looking quadruped, or an impertinent bird, for I must say that as a class the birds are the most insolent of all the inhabitants of this strange land. There is in particular one old crow, a most objectionable personage, and a cockatoo who is really the most violent and ill-natured bird that I have ever been acquainted with.",country unexpected happen startle street address dangerous look quadruped impertinent bird say class bird insolent inhabitant strange land be particular old crow objectionable personage cockatoo violent ill natured bird acquainted

7,"One morning a few weeks since, I received a letter from his Majesty the Wallypug asking me to visit him at his palace at Why, in order to assist him in establishing some of our social customs and methods of government, which he had so greatly admired during his visit to England, and which he was desirous of imitating in his own land. A little packet was enclosed in the letter, bearing the words, “The shortest way to Why. This side up with _anxiety_.” “Well,” I thought, “I suppose they mean ‘This side up with _care_,’” and was proceeding very carefully to open the packet when a gust of wind rushed in at the window, and blowing open the paper wrapper, scattered the contents—a little white powder—in all directions. Some particles flew up into my eyes, and caused them to smart so violently that I was obliged to close them for some time till the pain had gone, and when I opened them again, what do you think? I was no longer in my study at home, but out on a kind of heath in the brilliant sunshine, and apparently miles from a house of any kind. A finger-post stood a little way in front of me, and I could see that three roads met just here. Anxiously I hurried up to the post to see where I was. One arm pointed, “To Nowhere.” “And I certainly don’t want to go there,” I thought; the other one was inscribed, “To Somewhere,” which was decidedly a little better, but the third one said, “To Everywhere Else.”",morning few week receive letter ask visit palace order assist establish social custom method government admire visit desirous imitate own land little packet enclose letter bear word short way side think suppose mean side proceed open packet gust wind rush window blow open paper wrapper scatter content little white powder direction particle fly eye cause smart oblige close time pain go open think study home kind heath brilliant sunshine mile house kind finger post stand little way front see road meet hurry post see arm point want go think other one inscribe little good third one say

9,"“And, good gracious me,” I thought, “that’s not much use, for I don’t know in the least now which of the last two roads to take.” I was puzzling my brain as to what was the best thing to be done, when I happened to look down the road leading to “Nowhere,” and saw a curious-looking little person running towards me. He had an enormous head, and apparently his arms and legs were attached to it, for I could see no trace of a body. He was flourishing something in his hand as he ran along, and as soon as he came closer I discovered that it was his card which he handed to me with a polite bow and an extensive smile, as soon as he got near enough to do so.",good gracious think much use know least last road take puzzle brain good thing do happen look road lead see curious look little person run have enormous head arm leg attach see trace body flourish hand run come close discover card hand polite bow extensive smile get do

76,"“Oh, get in, get in; don’t make a fuss. I suppose I shall have to take a turn myself,” said Oom Hi, grasping the handles, and the Kangaroo and myself having taken our seats we were soon traveling down the road. The Kangaroo turned out to be a very pleasant companion after all, and when he found out that I came from England told me all about his brother, who was a professional boxer, and had been to London and made his fortune as the Boxing Kangaroo. He was quite delighted when I told him that I had seen notices of his performance in the papers. We soon came in sight of a walled city, which Oom Hi, turning around, informed me was Why. And on reaching the gate he gave the rickshaw in charge of an old turtle, who came waddling up, and each of the animals taking one of my arms, I was led in triumph through the city gates to the Wallypug’s palace, several creatures, including a motherly-looking goose and a little gosling, taking a lively interest in my progress, while a giraffe in a very high collar craned his neck through a port-hole to try and get a glimpse of us as we passed under the portcullis.",get get make fuss suppose have take turn say grasp handle take seat travel road turn pleasant companion find come tell brother professional boxer make fortune delighted tell see notice performance paper come sight wall city turn inform reach gate give rickshaw charge old turtle come waddle animal take arm lead triumph city gate palace several creature include motherly look goose little gosling take lively interest progress giraffe high collar cran neck port hole try get glimpse pass portcullis
