2," It was some time before the full meaning of Susan's letter penetrated to her father's brain; but when it did, he was not at first altogether pained by it. True, it was both a grief and disappointment to think that his daughter, instead of returning to him, was already on her way across the sea to a very distant land. But as this came slowly to his mind, there came also the thought that there would now be no one to divide with him the treasure committed to his charge. The little child would belong to him alone. They might go on still, living as they had done these last three days, and being all in all to one another. If he could have chosen, his will would certainly have been for Susan to return to them; but, since he could not have his choice, he felt that there were some things which would be all the happier for him because of her absence.",time full meaning letter penetrate father brain first pain true grief disappointment think daughter return way sea distant land come mind come thought be one divide treasure commit charge little child belong go live do last day choose will return have choice feel be thing happy absence 
3,"He put Dolly to bed, and then went out to shut up the shop for the night. As he carried in his feeble arms a single shutter at a time, he heard himself hailed by a boy's voice, which was lowered to a low and mysterious whisper, and which belonged to Tony, who took the shutter out of his hands.",put bed go shut shop night carry feeble arm single shutter time hear hail boy voice lower low mysterious whisper belong take shutter hand

13,"""A book all about him, the Lord Jesus,"" said Oliver, ""what he's done, and what he's willing to do for people. If you'll come of an evening, I'll read it aloud to you and my little love. She'll listen as quiet and good as any angel.""",book say do willing do person come evening read little love listen quiet good angel 
14,"""I'll come to-morrow,"" answered Tony, readily; and he lingered about the doorway until he heard the old man inside fasten the bolts and locks, and saw the light go out in the pane of glass over the door. Then he scampered noiselessly with his naked feet along the alley in the direction of Covent Garden, where he purposed to spend the night, if left undisturbed.",come answer linger doorway hear old man fast bolt lock see light go pane glass door scamper naked foot alley direction purpose spend night leave undisturbed 
15,"Old Oliver went back into his room, where the tea-table was still set out for his Susan's welcome; but he had no heart to clear the things away. A chill came over his spirit as his eye fell upon the preparations he had made to give her such a cordial greeting, that she would know at once he had forgiven her fully. He lit his pipe, and sat pondering sorrowfully over all the changes that had happened to him since those old, far-away days when he was a boy, in the pleasant, fresh, healthy homestead at the foot of the Wrekin. He felt all of a sudden how very old he was; a poor, infirm, hoary old man. His sight was growing dim even, and his hearing duller every day; he was sure of it. His limbs ached oftener, and he was earlier wearied in the evening; yet he could not sleep soundly at nights, as he had been used to do. But, worst of all, his memory was not half as good as it had been. Sometimes, of late, he had caught himself reading a newspaper quite a fortnight old, and he had not found it out till he happened to see the date at the top. He could not recollect the names of people as he did once; for many of his customers to whom he supplied the monthly magazines were obliged to tell him their names and the book they wanted every time, before he could remember them. And now there was this young child cast upon him to be thought of, and cared and worked for. It was very thoughtless and reckless of Susan! Suppose he should forget or neglect any of her tender wants! Suppose his dull ear should grow too deaf to catch the pretty words she said when she asked for something! Suppose he should not see when the tears were rolling down her cheeks, and nobody would comfort her! It might very easily be so. He was not the hale man he was when Susan was just such another little darling, and he could toss her up to the ceiling in his strong hands. It was as much as he could do to lift Dolly on to his feeble knee, and nurse her quietly, not even giving her a ride to market upon it; and how stiff he felt if she sat there long!",old go room tea table set welcome have heart clear thing chill come spirit eye fall preparation make give cordial greeting know forgive light pipe sit ponder change happen old day boy pleasant fresh healthy homestead foot feel sudden old poor infirm hoary old man sight grow dim hearing duller day sure limb ach weary evening sleep night use do bad memory good late catch read newspaper fortnight old find happen see date top recollect name person many customer supply monthly magazine oblige tell name book want time remember be young child cast think care work thoughtless reckless suppose forget neglect tender want suppose dull ear grow deaf catch pretty word say ask suppose see tear roll cheek comfort hale man little darling toss ceiling strong hand much do lift feeble knee nurse give ride market stiff feel sit 
16,"Old Oliver laid aside his pipe, and rested his worn face upon his hands, while the heavy tears came slowly and painfully to his eyes, and trickled down his withered cheeks. His joy had fled, and his unmingled gladness had faded quite away. He was a very poor, very old man; and the little child was very, very young. What would become of them both, alone in London?",old lay pipe rest wear face hand heavy tear come eye trickle wither cheek joy flead unmingled gladness fade poor old man little child young become 
17,"He did not know whether it was a voice speaking within himself in his own heart, or words whispered very softly into his ear; but he heard a low, quiet, still, small voice, which said, ""Even to your old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs I will carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you."" And old Oliver answered, with a sob, ""Yes, Lord, yes!""",know voice speak own heart word whisper ear hear low quiet small voice say old age hoar hair carry make bear carry deliver old answer sob
