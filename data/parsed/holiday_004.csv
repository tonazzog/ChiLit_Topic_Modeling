2,"  Fire rages with fury wherever it comes,   If only one spark should be dropped;   Whole houses, or cities, sometimes it consumes,   Where its violence cannot be stopped.",fire rage fury come spark drop whole house city consume violence stop 
3," One night, about eight o'clock, Harry and Laura were playing in the nursery, building houses with bricks, and trying who could raise the highest tower without letting it fall, when suddenly they were startled to hear every bell in the house ringing violently, while the servants seemed running up and down stairs, as if they were distracted.",night o'clock play nursery build house brick try raise high tower let fall startle hear bell house ring servant seem run stair distract 
4,"""What can be the matter!"" cried Laura, turning round and listening, while Harry quietly took this opportunity to shake the walls of her castle till it fell.",matter cry turn listen take opportunity shake wall castle fall 
5,"""The very house is coming down about your ears, Laura!"" said Harry, enjoying his little bit of mischief. ""I should like to be Andrew, now, for five minutes, that I might answer those fifty bells, and see what has happened. Uncle David must be wanting coals, candles, tea, toast, and soda water, all at once! What a bustle everybody is in! There! the bells are ringing again, worse than ever! Something wonderful is going on! what can it be!""",very house come ear say enjoy little bit mischief like minute answer bell see happen uncle want coal candle tea toast soda water bustle bell ring bad wonderful go 
6,"Presently Betty ran breathlessly into the room, saying that Mrs. Crabtree ought to come down stairs immediately, as Lady Harriet had been suddenly taken very ill, and, till the Doctor arrived, nobody knew what to do, so she must give her advice and assistance.",run room say come stair take ill arrive know do give advice assistance 
7,"Harry and Laura felt excessively shocked to hear this alarming news, and listened with grave attention, while Mrs. Crabtree told them how amazingly well they ought to behave in her absence, when they were trusted alone in the nursery, with nobody to keep them in order, or to see what they were doing, especially now, as their grandmama had been taken ill, and would require to be kept quiet.",feel shocked hear alarming news listen grave attention tell behave absence trust nursery keep order see do grandmama take ill require keep quiet 
8,"Harry sat in his chair, and might have been painted as the very picture of a good boy during nearly twenty minutes after Mrs. Crabtree departed; and Laura placed herself opposite to him, trying to follow so excellent an example, while they scarcely spoke above a whisper, wondering what could be the matter with their grandmama, and wishing for once, to see Mrs. Crabtree again, that they might hear how she was. Any one who had observed Harry and Laura at that time, would have wondered to see two such quiet, excellent, respectable children, and wished that all little boys and girls were made upon the same pattern; but presently they began to think that probably Lady Harriet was not so very ill, as no more bells had rung during several minutes, and Harry ventured to look about for some better amusement than sitting still.",sit chair paint very picture good boy minute depart place try follow excellent example speak whisper wonder matter grandmama wish see hear one observe time wonder see such quiet excellent respectable child wish little boy girl make same pattern begin think ill more bell rung several minute venture look good amusement sit 
9,"At this moment Laura unluckily perceived on the table near where they sat, a pair of Mrs. Crabtree's best scissors, which she had been positively forbid to touch. The long troublesome ringlets were as usual hanging over her eyes in a most teazing manner, so she thought what a good opportunity this might be to shorten them a very little, not above an inch or two; and without considering a moment longer, she slipped upon tiptoe, with a frightened look, round the table, and picked up the scissors in her hand, then hastening towards a looking-glass, she began snipping off the ends of her hair. Laura was much diverted to see it showering down upon the floor, so she cut and cut on, while the curls fell thicker and faster, till at last the whole floor was covered with them, and scarcely a hair left upon her head. Harry went into fits of laughing when he perceived what a ridiculous figure Laura had made of herself, and he turned her round and round to see the havoc she had made, saying,",moment perceive table sit pair good scissors forbid touch long troublesome ringlet usual hang eye teazing manner think good opportunity shorten little inch consider moment slip tiptoe frighten look table pick scissors hand hasten look glass begin snip end hair divert see shower floor cut cut curl fall thick fast last whole floor cover hair leave head go fit laugh perceive ridiculous figure make turn round see havoc make say 
10,"""You should give all this hair to Mr. Mills the upholsterer, to stuff grandmama's arm-chair with! At any rate, Laura, if Mrs. Crabtree is ever so angry, she can hardly pull you by the hair of the head again! What a sound sleep you will have to-night, with no hard curl-papers to torment you!""",give hair upholsterer stuff grandmama arm chair rate angry pull hair head sound sleep have night hard curl paper torment 
11,"Harry had been told five hundred times, never to touch the candles, and threatened with twenty different punishments, if he ever ventured to do so; but now, he amused himself with trying to snuff one till he snuffed it out. Then he lighted it again, and tried the experiment once more, but again the teazing candle went out, as if on purpose to plague him, so he felt quite provoked. Having lighted it once more, Harry prepared to carry the candlestick with him towards the inner nursery, though afraid to make the smallest noise, in case it might be taken from him. Before he had gone five steps, down dropped the extinguisher, then followed the snuffers with a great crash, but Laura seemed too busy cropping her ringlets, to notice what was going on. All the way along upon the floor, Harry let fall a perfect shower of hot wax, which spotted the nursery carpet from the table where he had found the candle into the next room, where he disappeared, and shut the door, that no one might interfere with what he liked to do.",tell time touch candle threaten different punishment venture do amuse try snuff snuff light try experiment more teazing candle go purpose plague feel provoke light prepare carry candlestick inner nursery afraid make small noise case take go step drop extinguisher follow snuffer great crash seem busy cropp ringlet notice go way floor let fall perfect shower hot wax spot nursery carpet table find candle next room disappear shut door interfere like do 
12,"After he had been absent some time, the door was hastily opened again, and Laura felt surprised to see Harry come back with his face as red as a stick of sealing-wax, and his large eyes staring wider than they had ever stared before, with a look of rueful consternation.",absent time door open feel surprise see come face red stick sealing wax large eye stare wide stare look rueful consternation 
13,"""What is the matter!"" exclaimed Laura in a terrified voice. ""Has anything dreadful happened? Why do you look so frightened and so surprised?""",matter exclaim terrified voice dreadful happen look frighten surprised 
14,"""Oh dear! oh dear! what shall I do?"" cried Harry, who seemed scarcely to know how he spoke, or where he was. ""I don't know what to do, Laura!""",dear dear do cry seem know speak know do 
15,"""What can be the matter! do tell me at once, Harry,"" said Laura, shaking with apprehension. ""Speak as fast as you can!""",matter tell say shake apprehension speak 
16,"""Will you not tell Mrs. Crabtree, nor grandmama, nor anybody else?"" cried Harry, bursting into tears. ""I am so very, very sorry, and so frightened! Laura! do you know, I took a candle into the next room, merely to play with it.""",tell grandmama else cry burst tear sorry frighten know take candle next room play 
17,"""Well! go on, Harry! go on! what did you do with the candle?""",go go do candle 
18,"""I only put it on the bed for a single minute, to see how the flame would look there,--well! do you know it blazed away famously, and then all the bed clothes began burning too! Oh! there is such a terrible fire in the next room! you never saw anything like it! what shall we do? If old Andrew were to come up, do you think he could put it out? I have shut the door that Mrs. Crabtree may not see the flames. Be sure, Laura, to tell nobody but Andrew.""",put bed single minute see flame look know blaze bed clothes begin burn be terrible fire next room see do old come think put shut door see flame sure tell 
19,"Laura became terrified at the way she saw poor Harry in, but when she opened the door to find out the real state of affairs, oh! what a dreadful sight was there! all the beds were on fire, while bright red flames were blazing up to the roof of the room, with a fierce roaring noise, which it was perfectly frightful to hear. She screamed aloud with terror at this alarming scene, while Harry did all he could to quiet her, and even put his hand over her mouth, that her cries might not be heard. Laura now struggled to get loose, and called louder and louder, till at last every maid in the house came racing up stairs, three steps at a time, to know what was the matter. Immediately upon seeing the flames, they all began screaming too, in such a loud discordant way, that it sounded as if a whole flight of crows had come into the passages. Never was there such an uproar heard in the house before, for the walls echoed with a general cry of ""Fire! fire! fire!""",become terrify way see poor open door find real state affair dreadful sight bed fire bright red flame blaze roof room fierce roar noise frightful hear scream terror alarming scene do quiet put hand mouth cry hear struggle get loose call louder louder last maid house come racing stair step time know matter see flame begin scream loud discordant way sound whole flight crow come passage be uproar hear house wall echoe general cry fire fire 
20,"Up flew Mrs. Crabtree towards the nursery like a sky-rocket, scolding furiously, talking louder than all the others put together, and asking who had set the house on fire, while Harry and Laura scarcely knew whether to be most frightened for the raging flames, or the raging Mrs. Crabtree; but, in the meantime, they both shrunk into the smallest possible size, and hid themselves behind a door.",fly nursery sky rocket scold talk other put ask set house fire know frighten rage flame rage meantime shrink small possible size hide door 
21,"During all this confusion, Old Andrew luckily remembered, that, in the morning, there had been a great washing in the laundry, where large tubs full of water were standing, so he called to the few maids who had any of their senses remaining, desiring them to assist in carrying up some buckets, that they might be emptied on the burning beds, to extinguish the flames if possible. Every body was now in a hurry, and all elbowing each other out of the way, while it was most extraordinary to see how old Andrew exerted himself, as if he had been a fireman all his life, while Mrs. Marmalade, the fat cook, who could hardly carry herself up stairs in general, actively assisted to bring up the great heavy tubs, and to pour them out like a cascade upon the burning curtains, till the nursery-floor looked like a duck pond.",confusion old remember morning be great washing laundry large tub full water stand call few maid have sense remain desire assist carry bucket empty burning bed extinguish flame possible body hurry elbow other way extraordinary see old exert fireman life fat cook carry stair general assist bring great heavy tub pour cascade burning curtain nursery floor look duck pond 
22,"Meantime Harry and Laura added to the confusion as much as they could, and were busier than anybody, stealing down the back-stairs whenever Mrs. Crabtree was not in sight, and filling their little jugs with water, which they brought up, as fast as possible, and dashed upon the flames, till at last, it is to be feared, they began to feel quite amused with the bustle, and to be almost sorry when the conflagration diminished. At one time, Laura very nearly set her own frock on fire, as she ventured too near, but Harry pulled her back, and then courageously advanced to discharge a shower from his own little jug, remaining stationary to watch the effect, till his face was almost scorched.",add confusion much busy steal back stair sight fill little jug water bring possible dash flame last fear begin feel amused bustle sorry conflagration diminish time set own frock fire venture pull advance discharge shower own little jug remain stationary watch effect face scorch 
23,"At last the fire became less and less, till it went totally out, but not before the nursery furniture had been reduced to perfect ruins, besides which, Betty had her arm sadly burned in the confusion. Mrs. Marmalade's cap was completely destroyed, and Mrs. Crabtree's best gown had so large a hole burned in the skirt, that she never could wear it again!",last fire become less less go nursery furniture reduce perfect ruin have arm burn confusion cap destroy good gown have large hole burn skirt wear 
24,"After all was quiet, and the fire completely extinguished, Major Graham took Laura down stairs to Lady Harriet's dressing-room, that she might tell the whole particulars of how this alarming accident happened in the nursery, for nobody could guess what had caused so sudden and dreadful a fire, which seemed to have been as unexpected as a flash of lightning.",quiet fire extinguish take stair dress room tell whole particular alarming accident happen nursery guess cause sudden dreadful fire seem unexpected flash lightning 
25,"Lady Harriet had felt so terrified by the noise and confusion, that she was out of bed, sitting up in an arm-chair, supported by pillows, when Laura entered, at the sight of whom, with her well-cropped head, she made an exclamation of perfect amazement.",feel terrified noise confusion bed sit arm chair support pillow enter sight croppe head make exclamation perfect amazement 
26,"""Why! who on earth is that! Laura! my dear child! what has become of all your hair? Were your curls burned off in the fire? or did the fright make you grow bald? What is the meaning of all this?""",earth dear child become hair curl burn fire fright make grow bald meaning 
27,"Laura turned perfectly crimson with shame and distress, for she now felt convinced of her own great misconduct about the scissors and curls, but she had been taught on all occasions to speak the truth, and would rather have died than told a lie, or even allowed any person to believe what was not true, therefore she answered in a low, frightened voice, while the tears came into her eyes, ""My hair has not been burned off, grandmama! but--but--""",turn crimson shame distress feel convince own great misconduct scissors curl teach occasion speak truth die tell lie allow person believe true answer low frighten voice tear come eye hair burn grandmama 
28,"""Well, child! speak out!"" said Lady Harriet, impatiently, ""did some hair-dresser come to the house and rob you?""",child speak say do hair dresser come house rob 
29,"""Or are you like the ladies of Carthage who gave their long hair for bows and arrows?"" asked Major Graham. ""I never saw such a little fright in my life as you look now; but tell us all about it?""",lady give long hair bow arrow ask see little fright life look tell 
30,"""I have been quite as naughty as Harry!"" answered Laura, bursting into tears and sobbing with grief; ""I was cutting off my hair with Mrs. Crabtree's scissors all the time that he was setting the nursery on fire!""",naughty answer burst tear sobb grief cut hair scissors time set nursery fire 
31,"""Did any mortal ever hear of two such little torments!"" exclaimed Major Graham, hardly able to help laughing. ""I wonder if anybody else in the world has such mischievous children!""",mortal hear such little torment exclaim able help laugh wonder else world have such mischievous child 
32,"""It is certainly very strange, that you and Harry never can contrive to be three hours out of a scrape!"" said Lady Harriet gravely; ""now Frank, on the contrary, never forgets what I bid him do. You might suppose he carried Mrs. Crabtree in his pocket, to remind him constantly of his duty; but there are not two such boys in the world as Frank!""",strange contrive hour scrape say contrary forget bid do suppose carry pocket remind duty be such boy world 
33,"""No,"" added Major Graham; ""Harry set the house on fire, and Frank will set the Thames on fire!""",add set house fire set fire 
34,"When Laura saw uncle David put on one of his funny looks, while he spoke in this way to Lady Harriet, she almost forgot her former fright, and became surprised to observe her grandmama busy preparing what she called a coach-wheel, which had been often given as a treat to Harry and herself when they were particularly good. This delightful wheel was manufactured by taking a whole round slice of the loaf, in the centre of which was placed a large tea-spoonful of jelly, after which long spokes of marmalade, jam, and honey, were made to diverge most tastefully in every direction towards the crust, and Laura watched the progress of this business with great interest and anxiety, wondering if it could be hoped that her grandmama really meant to forgive all her misconduct during the day.",see uncle put funny look speak way forget former fright become surprise observe grandmama busy prepare call coach wheel give treat good delightful wheel manufacture take whole round slice loaf centre place large tea spoonful jelly long spoke marmalade jam honey make diverge direction crust watch progress business great interest anxiety wonder hope grandmama mean forgive misconduct day 
35,"""That coach-wheel is, of course, meant for me!"" said Major Graham, pretending to be very hungry, and looking slyly at Laura; ""It cannot possibly be intended for our little hair-dresser here!""",coach wheel course mean say pretend hungry look intend little hair dresser 
36,"""Yes, it is!"" answered Lady Harriet, smiling. ""I have some thoughts of excusing Laura this time, because she always tells me the truth, without attempting to conceal any foolish thing she does. It will be very long before she has any hair to cut off again, so I hope she may be older and wiser by that time, especially considering that every looking-glass she sees for six months will make her feel ashamed of herself. She certainly deserves some reward for having prevented the house to-night from being burned to the ground.""",answer smile have thought excuse time tell truth attempt conceal foolish thing long have hair cut hope old wise time consider look glass see month make feel ashamed deserve reward prevent house night burn ground 
37,"""I am glad you think so, because here is a shilling that has been burning in my pocket for the last few minutes, as I wished to bestow it on Laura for having saved all our lives, and if she had behaved still better, I might perhaps have given her a gold watch!""",glad think shilling burn pocket last few minute wish bestow save life behave good give gold watch 
38,"Laura was busily employed in eating her coach-wheel, and trying to fancy what the gold watch would have looked like which she might probably have got from uncle David, when suddenly the door burst open, and Mrs. Crabtree hurried into the room, with a look of surprise and alarm, her face as red as a poppy, and her eye fixed on the hole in her best gown, while she spoke so loud and angrily, that Laura almost trembled.",employ eat coach wheel try fancy gold watch look get uncle door burst open hurry room look surprise alarm face red poppy eye fix hole good gown speak loud tremble 
39,"""If you please, my lady! where can Master Harry be? I cannot find him in any corner!--we have been searching all over the house, up stairs and down stairs, in vain. Not a garret or a closet but has been ransacked, and nobody can guess what has become of him!""",lady find corner search house stair stair vain garret closet ransack guess become 
40,"""Did you look up the chimney, Mrs. Crabtree?"" asked Major Graham, laughing to see how excited she looked.",look chimney ask laugh see excited look 
41,"""Indeed, Sir! it is no joke,"" answered Mrs. Crabtree, sulkily; ""I am almost afraid Master Harry has been burned in the fire! The last time Betty saw him, he was throwing a jug of water into the flames, and no one has ever seen or heard of him since! There is a great many ashes and cinders lying about the room, and----""",joke answer afraid burn fire last time see throw jug water flame see hear be great many ash cinder lie room 
42,"""Do you think, in sober seriousness, Mrs. Crabtree, that Harry would melt away like a wax doll, without asking any body to extinguish him?"" said Major Graham, smiling. ""No! no! little boys are not quite so easily disposed of. I shall find Harry in less than five minutes, if he is above ground.""",think sober seriousness melt wax doll ask body extinguish say smile little boy dispose find less minute ground 
43,"But uncle David was quite mistaken in expecting to discover Harry so easily, for he searched and searched in vain. He looked into every possible or impossible place--the library, the kitchen, the garrets, the laundry, the drawing-room, all without success,--he peeped under the tables, behind the curtains, over the beds, beneath the pillows, and into Mrs. Crabtree's bonnet-box,--he even opened the tea-chest, and looked out at the window, in case Harry had tumbled over, but nowhere could he be found.",uncle mistaken expect discover search search vain look possible impossible place library kitchen garret laundry draw room success peep table curtain bed pillow bonnet box open tea chest look window case tumble find 
44,"""Not a mouse is stirring!"" exclaimed Major Graham, beginning now to look exceedingly grave and anxious. ""This is very strange! The house-door is locked, therefore, unless Harry made his escape through the key-hole, he must be here! It is most unaccountable what the little pickle can have done with himself!""",mouse stir exclaim begin look grave anxious strange house door lock make escape key hole unaccountable little pickle do 
45,"When Major Graham chose to exert his voice, it was as loud as a trumpet, and could be heard half a mile off; so he now called out, like thunder, from the top of the stairs to the bottom, saying, ""Hollo, Harry! hollo! Come here, my boy! Nobody shall hurt you! Harry! where are you!""",choose exert voice loud trumpet hear mile call thunder top stair bottom say come boy hurt 
46,"Uncle David waited to listen, but all was still,--no answer could be heard, and there was not a sound in the house, except poor Laura at the bottom of the stairs, sobbing with grief and terror about Harry having been lost, and Mrs. Crabtree grumbling angrily to herself, on account of the large hole in her best gown.",wait listen answer hear be sound house poor bottom stair sobb grief terror lose grumble account large hole good gown 
47,"By this time Lady Harriet nearly fainted with fatigue, for she was so very old, and had been ill all day; so she grew worse and worse, till everybody said she must go to bed, and try if it would be possible to fall asleep, assuring her that Harry must soon be found, as nothing particular could have happened to him, or some person would have seen it.",time faint fatigue old ill day grow bad bad say go bed try possible fall asleep assure find particular happen person see 
48,"""Indeed, my lady! Master Harry is just like a bad shilling that is sure to come back,"" said Mrs. Crabtree, helping her to undress, while she continued to talk the whole time about the fire, showing her own unfortunate gown, describing the trouble she had taken to save the house from being burned, and always ending every sentence with a wish that she could lay her hands on Harry to punish him as he deserved.",lady bad shilling sure come say help undress continue talk whole time fire show own unfortunate gown describe trouble take save house burn end sentence wish lay hand punish deserve 
49,"""The truth is, I just spoil and indulge the children too much, my lady!"" added Mrs. Crabtree, in a self-satisfied tone of voice. ""I really blame myself often for being over easy and kind.""",truth spoil indulge child much lady add self satisfied tone voice blame easy kind 
50,"""You have nothing to accuse yourself of in that respect,"" answered Lady Harriet, unable to help smiling.",have accuse respect answer unable help smile 
51,"""Your ladyship is very good to say so. Major Graham is so fond of our young people, that it is lucky they have some one to keep them in order. I shall make a duty, my lady, of being more strict than ever. Master Harry must be made an example of this time!"" added Mrs. Crabtree, angrily glancing at the hole in her gown. ""I shall teach him to remember this day the longest hour he has to live!""",ladyship good say fond young person lucky have one keep order make duty lady strict make example time add glance hole gown teach remember day long hour have live 
52,"""Harry will not forget it any how,"" answered Lady Harriet languidly. ""Perhaps, Mrs. Crabtree, we might as well not be severe with the poor boy on this occasion. As the old proverb says, 'there is no use in pouring water on a drowned mouse.' Harry has got a sad fright for his pains, and at all events you must find him first, before he can be punished. Where can the poor child be hid?""",forget answer severe poor boy occasion old proverb say be use pour water drown mouse get sad fright pain event find punish poor child hide 
53,"""I would give sixpence to find out that, my lady!"" answered Mrs. Crabtree, helping Lady Harriet into bed, after which she closed the shutters, put out the candles, and left the room, angrily muttering, ""Master Harry cares no more for me than the poker cares for the tongs, but I shall teach him another story soon.""",give sixpence find lady answer help bed close shutter put candle leave room mutter care more poker care tong teach story 
54,"Lady Harriet now feebly closed her eyes, being quite exhausted, and was beginning to feel the pleasant, confused sensation that people have before going to sleep, when some noise made her suddenly start quite awake. She sat up in bed to listen, but could not be sure whether it had been a great noise at a distance, or a little noise in the room; so after waiting two or three minutes, she sunk back upon the pillows, and tried to forget it. Again, however, she distinctly heard something rustling in the bed curtains, and opened her eyes to see what could be the matter, but all was dark. Something seemed to be breathing very near her, however, and the curtains shook worse than before, till Lady Harriet became really alarmed.",close eye exhausted begin feel pleasant confused sensation person have go sleep noise make start awake sit bed listen sure great noise distance little noise room wait minute sink pillow try forget hear rustle bed curtain open eye see matter dark seem breathe curtain shake bad become alarmed 
55,"""It must surely be a cat in the room!"" thought she, hastily pulling the bell rope, till it nearly came down. ""That tiresome little animal will make such a noise, I shall not be able to sleep all night!""",cat room think pull bell rope come tiresome little animal make noise able sleep night 
56,"The next minute Lady Harriet was startled to hear a loud sob close beside her; and when everybody rushed up stairs to ask what was the matter, they brought candles to search the room, and there was Harry! He lay doubled up in a corner, and crying as if his heart would break, yet still endeavouring not to be seen; for Harry always thought it a terrible disgrace to cry, and would have concealed himself anywhere, rather than be observed weeping. Laura burst into tears also, when she saw what red eyes and pale cheeks Harry had; but Mrs. Crabtree lost no time in pulling him out of his place, being quite impatient to begin her scold, and to produce her tawse, though she received a sad disappointment on this occasion, as uncle David unexpectedly interfered to get him off.",next minute startle hear loud sob close rush stair ask matter bring candle search room be lay double corner cry heart break endeavour see think terrible disgrace cry conceal observe weep burst tear see red eye pale cheek have lose time pull place impatient begin scold produce tawse receive sad disappointment occasion uncle interfer get 
57,"""Come now, Mrs. Crabtree,"" said he good-naturedly; ""put up the tawse for this time; you are rather too fond of the leather. Harry seems really sorry and frightened, so we must be merciful. That cataract of tears he is shedding now, would have extinguished the fire if it had come in time! Harry is like a culprit with the rope about his neck; but he shall not be executed. Let me be judge and jury in this case; and my sentence is a very dreadful one. Harry must sleep all to-night in the burned nursery, having no other covering than the burned blankets, with large holes in them, that he may never forget",come say good put tawse time fond leather seem sorry frighten merciful cataract tear shed extinguish fire come time culprit rope neck execute let judge jury case sentence dreadful one sleep night burn nursery have other covering burn blanket large hole forget
