3,"The next morning, after breakfast, Tom, East, and Gower met as usual to learn their second lesson together. Tom had been considering how to break his proposal of giving up the crib to the others, and having found no better way (as indeed none better can ever be found by man or boy), told them simply what had happened; how he had been to see Arthur, who had talked to him upon the subject, and what he had said, and for his part he had made up his mind, and wasn’t going to use cribs any more; and not being quite sure of his ground, took the high and pathetic tone, and was proceeding to say “how that, having learnt his lessons with them for so many years, it would grieve him much to put an end to the arrangement, and he hoped, at any rate, that if they wouldn’t go on with him, they should still be just as good friends, and respect one another’s motives; but--”",next morning breakfast meet usual learn second lesson consider break proposal give crib other find good way good find man boy tell happen see talk subject say part make mind go use crib more sure ground take high pathetic tone proceed say learn lesson many year grieve much put end arrangement hope rate go good friend respect motive

6,"“O Tommy, Tommy!” said East, proceeding to do as he was bidden, “that it should ever have come to this! I knew Arthur’d be the ruin of you some day, and you of me. And now the time’s come.” And he made a doleful face.",say proceed do bidd come know ruin day time come make doleful face

13,"“I say, Tom,” cried East, having hit on a new idea, “don’t you remember, when we were in the upper fourth, and old Momus caught me construing off the leaf of a crib which I’d torn out and put in my book, and which would float out on to the floor, he sent me up to be flogged for it?”",say cry hit new idea remember upper fourth old catch construe leaf crib tear put book float floor send flogge

19,"The boys went on as usual, each taking a sentence in turn, and the crib being handed to the one whose turn it was to construe. Of course Tom couldn’t object to this, as, was it not simply lying there to be appealed to in case the sentence should prove too hard altogether for the construer? But it must be owned that Gower and East did not make very tremendous exertions to conquer their sentences before having recourse to its help. Tom, however, with the most heroic virtue and gallantry, rushed into his sentence, searching in a high-minded manner for nominative and verb, and turning over his dictionary frantically for the first hard word that stopped him. But in the meantime Gower, who was bent on getting to fives, would peep quietly into the crib, and then suggest, “Don’t you think this is the meaning?” “I think you must take it this way, Brown.” And as Tom didn’t see his way to not profiting by these suggestions, the lesson went on about as quickly as usual, and Gower was able to start for the fives court within five minutes of the half-hour.",boy go usual take sentence turn crib hand one turn construe course object lie appeal case sentence prove hard construer own make tremendous exertion conquer sentence have recourse help heroic virtue gallantry rush sentence search high minded manner nominative verb turn dictionary first hard word stop meantime bend get fives peep crib suggest think meaning think take way see way profit suggestion lesson go usual able start fives court minute half hour

Are you sure you remember what the Doctor said to you?”",shove hand back hair sure say fellow carry leg think try sentence sure remember say 
23,"“Yes. And I’ll swear I couldn’t make out one of my sentences to-day--no, nor ever could. I really don’t remember,” said East, speaking slowly and impressively, “to have come across one Latin or Greek sentence this half that I could go and construe by the light of nature. Whereby I am sure Providence intended cribs to be used.”",swear make sentence day remember say speak come latin greek sentence half go construe light nature sure intend crib use 
24,"“The thing to find out,” said Tom meditatively, “is how long one ought to grind at a sentence without looking at the crib.

25,"“To be sure, Tommy,” said East demurely, but with a merry twinkle in his eye. “Your new doctrine too, old fellow,” added he, “when one comes to think of it, is a cutting at the root of all school morality. You’ll take away mutual help, brotherly love, or, in the vulgar tongue, giving construes, which I hold to be one of our highest virtues. For how can you distinguish between getting a construe from another boy and using a crib? Hang it, Tom, if you’re going to deprive all our school-fellows of the chance of exercising Christian benevolence and being good Samaritans, I shall cut the concern.”",sure say merry twinkle eye new doctrine old fellow add come think cutting root school morality take mutual help brotherly love vulgar tongue give construe hold high virtue distinguish get construe boy use crib hang go deprive school fellow chance exercising christian benevolence good cut concern

Why, you Goth, ain’t we to take the benefit of the wisdom and admire and use the work of past generations? Not use old copy-books! Why, you might as well say we ought to pull down Westminster Abbey, and put up a go-to-meeting shop with churchwarden windows; or never read Shakespeare, but only Sheridan Knowles.

Fancy, then, the difference to them in looking over a vulgus which has been carefully touched and retouched by themselves and others, and which must bring them a sort of dreamy pleasure, as if they’d met the thought or expression of it somewhere or another--before they were born perhaps--and that of cutting up, and making picture-frames round all your and my false quantities, and other monstrosities. Why, Tom, you wouldn’t be so cruel as never to let old Momus hum over the ‘O genus humanum’ again, and then look up doubtingly through his spectacles, and end by smiling and giving three extra marks for it--just for old sake’s sake, I suppose.”",duty consult pleasure other own master fancy difference look vulgus touch retouch other bring sort dreamy pleasure meet thought expression bear cut make picture frame false quantity other monstrosity cruel let old hum o genus humanum look spectacle end smile give extra mark old sake sake suppose 
30,"“Well,” said Tom, getting up in something as like a huff as he was capable of, “it’s deuced hard that when a fellow’s really trying to do what he ought, his best friends’ll do nothing but chaff him and try to put him down.” And he stuck his books under his arm and his hat on his head, preparatory to rushing out into the quadrangle, to testify with his own soul of the faithlessness of friendships.",say get huff capable deuce fellow try do good friend do chaff try put stick book arm hat head preparatory rush quadrangle testify own soul faithlessness friendship 
31,"“Now don’t be an ass, Tom,” said East, catching hold of him; “you know me well enough by this time; my bark’s worse than my bite. You can’t expect to ride your new crotchet without anybody’s trying to stick a nettle under his tail and make him kick you off--especially as we shall all have to go on foot still.

I’ll be as serious as a judge.”",ass say catching hold know time bark bad bite expect ride new crotchet try stick nettle tail make kick have go foot sit let go serious judge 
32,"Then Tom sat himself down on the table, and waxed eloquent about all the righteousnesses and advantages of the new plan, as was his wont whenever he took up anything, going into it as if his life depended upon it, and sparing no abuse which he could think of, of the opposite method, which he denounced as ungentlemanly, cowardly, mean, lying, and no one knows what besides. “Very cool of Tom,” as East thought, but didn’t say, “seeing as how he only came out of Egypt himself last night at bedtime.”",sit table wax eloquent righteousness advantage new plan take go life depend spare abuse think opposite method denounce ungentlemanly cowardly mean lie know cool think say see come last night bedtime 
33,"“Well, Tom,” said he at last, “you see, when you and I came to school there were none of these sort of notions. You may be right--I dare say you are. Only what one has always felt about the masters is, that it’s a fair trial of skill and last between us and them--like a match at football or a battle. We’re natural enemies in school--that’s the fact. We’ve got to learn so much Latin and Greek, and do so many verses, and they’ve got to see that we do it. If we can slip the collar and do so much less without getting caught, that’s one to us. If they can get more out of us, or catch us shirking, that’s one to them. All’s fair in war but lying. If I run my luck against theirs, and go into school without looking at my lessons, and don’t get called up, why am I a snob or a sneak? I don’t tell the master I’ve learnt it. He’s got to find out whether I have or not. What’s he paid for? If he calls me up and I get floored, he makes me write it out in Greek and English. Very good. He’s caught me, and I don’t grumble. I grant you, if I go and snivel to him, and tell him I’ve really tried to learn it, but found it so hard without a translation, or say I’ve had a toothache, or any humbug of that kind, I’m a snob. That’s my school morality; it’s served me, and you too, Tom, for the matter of that, these five years. And it’s all clear and fair, no mistake about it.

35,"“Thank you, old fellow,” said he. “You’re a good old brick to be serious, and not put out with me. I said more than I meant, I dare say, only you see I know I’m right.

41,"As they walked out they got a message, to say that Arthur was just starting, and would like to say goodbye.

43,"East, who had fallen back into his usual humour, looked quaintly at Arthur, and said,--",fall usual humour look say 
44,"“So you’ve been at it again, through that hot-headed convert of yours there. He’s been making our lives a burden to us all the morning about using cribs.

48,"Tom renewed the discussion after second lesson, and succeeded so far as to get East to promise to give the new plan a fair trial.",renew discussion second lesson succeed get promise give new plan fair trial 
49,"Encouraged by his success, in the evening, when they were sitting alone in the large study, where East lived now almost, “vice Arthur on leave,”  after examining the new fishing-rod, which both pronounced to be the genuine article (“play enough to throw a midge tied on a single hair against the wind, and strength enough to hold a grampus”), they naturally began talking about Arthur. Tom, who was still bubbling over with last night’s scene and all the thoughts of the last week, and wanting to clinch and fix the whole in his own mind, which he could never do without first going through the process of belabouring somebody else with it all, suddenly rushed into the subject of Arthur’s illness, and what he had said about death.",encourage success evening sit large study live vice leave examine new fishing rod pronounce genuine article play throw midge tie single hair wind strength hold grampus begin talk bubble last night scene thought last week want clinch fix whole own mind do go process belabour else rush subject illness say death 
50,"East had given him the desired opening. After a serio-comic grumble, “that life wasn’t worth having, now they were tied to a young beggar who was always ‘raising his standard;’ and that he, East, was like a prophet’s donkey, who was obliged to struggle on after the donkey-man who went after the prophet; that he had none of the pleasure of starting the new crotchets, and didn’t half understand them, but had to take the kicks and carry the luggage as if he had all the fun,” he threw his legs up on to the sofa, and put his hands behind his head, and said,--",give desire opening serio comic grumble life worth have tie young beggar raise standard prophet donkey oblige struggle donkey man go prophet have pleasure start new crotchet half understand have take kick carry luggage have fun throw leg sofa put hand head say 
51,"“Well, after all, he’s the most wonderful little fellow I ever came across. There ain’t such a meek, humble boy in the school. Hanged if I don’t think now, really, Tom, that he believes himself a much worse fellow than you or I, and that he don’t think he has more influence in the house than Dot Bowles, who came last quarter, and isn’t ten yet. But he turns you and me round his little finger, old boy--there’s no mistake about that.” And East nodded at Tom sagaciously.",wonderful little fellow come meek humble boy school hange think believe bad fellow think have more influence house come last quarter turn little finger old boy be mistake nod 
52,"“Now or never!” thought Tom; so, shutting his eyes and hardening his heart, he went straight at it, repeating all that Arthur had said, as near as he could remember it, in the very words, and all he had himself thought. The life seemed to ooze out of it as he went on, and several times he felt inclined to stop, give it all up, and change the subject. But somehow he was borne on; he had a necessity upon him to speak it all out, and did so. At the end he looked at East with some anxiety, and was delighted to see that that young gentleman was thoughtful and attentive. The fact is, that in the stage of his inner life at which Tom had lately arrived, his intimacy with and friendship for East could not have lasted if he had not made him aware of, and a sharer in, the thoughts that were beginning to exercise him. Nor indeed could the friendship have lasted if East had shown no sympathy with these thoughts; so that it was a great relief to have unbosomed himself, and to have found that his friend could listen.",think shut eye harden heart go repeat say remember very word have think life seem ooze go several time feel inclined stop give change subject borne have necessity speak end look anxiety delighted see young gentleman thoughtful attentive fact stage inner life arrive intimacy friendship last make aware sharer thought begin exercise friendship last show sympathy thought great relief unbosom find friend listen 
53,"Tom had always had a sort of instinct that East’s levity was only skin-deep, and this instinct was a true one. East had no want of reverence for anything he felt to be real; but his was one of those natures that burst into what is generally called recklessness and impiety the moment they feel that anything is being poured upon them for their good which does not come home to their inborn sense of right, or which appeals to anything like self-interest in them. Daring and honest by nature, and outspoken to an extent which alarmed all respectabilities, with a constant fund of animal health and spirits which he did not feel bound to curb in any way, he had gained for himself with the steady part of the school (including as well those who wished to appear steady as those who really were so) the character of a boy with whom it would be dangerous to be intimate; while his own hatred of everything cruel, or underhand, or false, and his hearty respect for what he would see to be good and true, kept off the rest.",have sort instinct levity skin deep instinct true one have want reverence feel real nature burst call recklessness impiety moment feel pour good come inborn sense right appeal self interest daring honest nature outspoken extent alarm respectability constant fund animal health spirit feel bind curb way gain steady part school include wish appear steady character boy dangerous intimate own hatred cruel underhand false hearty respect see good true keep rest 
54,"Tom, besides being very like East in many points of character, had largely developed in his composition the capacity for taking the weakest side. This is not putting it strongly enough: it was a necessity with him; he couldn’t help it any more than he could eating or drinking. He could never play on the strongest side with any heart at football or cricket, and was sure to make friends with any boy who was unpopular, or down on his luck.",many point character develop composition capacity take weak side put necessity help more eat drink play strong side heart football cricket sure make friend boy unpopular luck 
55,"Now, though East was not what is generally called unpopular, Tom felt more and more every day, as their characters developed, that he stood alone, and did not make friends among their contemporaries, and therefore sought him out. Tom was himself much more popular, for his power of detecting humbug was much less acute, and his instincts were much more sociable. He was at this period of his life, too, largely given to taking people for what they gave themselves out to be; but his singleness of heart, fearlessness, and honesty were just what East appreciated, and thus the two had been drawn into great intimacy.",call unpopular feel day character develop stand make friend contemporary seek popular power detect humbug acute instinct sociable period life give take person give singleness heart fearlessness honesty appreciate draw great intimacy 
56,This intimacy had not been interrupted by Tom’s guardianship of Arthur.,intimacy interrupt guardianship 
57,"East had often, as has been said, joined them in reading the Bible; but their discussions had almost always turned upon the characters of the men and women of whom they read, and not become personal to themselves. In fact, the two had shrunk from personal religious discussion, not knowing how it might end, and fearful of risking a friendship very dear to both, and which they felt somehow, without quite knowing why, would never be the same, but either tenfold stronger or sapped at its foundation, after such a communing together.",say join read discussion turn character man woman read become personal fact shrink personal religious discussion know end fearful risk friendship dear feel know same strong sap foundation communing 
58,"What a bother all this explaining is! I wish we could get on without it. But we can’t. However, you’ll all find, if you haven’t found it out already, that a time comes in every human friendship when you must go down into the depths of yourself, and lay bare what is there to your friend, and wait in fear for his answer. A few moments may do it; and it may be (most likely will be, as you are English boys) that you will never do it but once. But done it must be, if the friendship is to be worth the name. You must find what is there, at the very root and bottom of one another’s hearts; and if you are at one there, nothing on earth can or at least ought to sunder you.",bother explain wish get find find time come human friendship go depth lay bare friend wait fear answer few moment do english boy do do friendship worth name find very root bottom heart earth least sunder 
59,"East had remained lying down until Tom finished speaking, as if fearing to interrupt him; he now sat up at the table, and leant his head on one hand, taking up a pencil with the other, and working little holes with it in the table-cover. After a bit he looked up, stopped the pencil, and said, “Thank you very much, old fellow. There’s no other boy in the house would have done it for me but you or Arthur. I can see well enough,” he went on, after a pause, “all the best big fellows look on me with suspicion; they think I’m a devil-may-care, reckless young scamp. So I am--eleven hours out of twelve, but not the twelfth. Then all of our contemporaries worth knowing follow suit, of course: we’re very good friends at games and all that, but not a soul of them but you and Arthur ever tried to break through the crust, and see whether there was anything at the bottom of me; and then the bad ones I won’t stand and they know that.”",remain lie finish speak fear interrupt sit table lean head hand take pencil other work little hole table cover bit look stop pencil say thank old fellow be other boy house do see go pause good big fellow look suspicion think care reckless young scamp hour twelfth contemporary worth know follow suit course good friend game soul try break crust see be bottom bad one stand know

65,"“Not I,” said East. Then with an effort he went on, “I’ll tell you what it is. I never stop the Sacrament. I can see, from the Doctor downwards, how that tells against me.”",say effort go tell stop see tell 
66,"“Yes, I’ve seen that,” said Tom, “and I’ve been very sorry for it, and Arthur and I have talked about it. I’ve often thought of speaking to you, but it’s so hard to begin on such subjects. I’m very glad you’ve opened it. Now, why don’t you?”",see say sorry talk think speak hard begin such subject glad open

69,"“No,” answered East sorrowfully; “you see this was how it happened. Last Confirmation was soon after Arthur came, and you were so taken up with him I hardly saw either of you. Well, when the Doctor sent round for us about it, I was living mostly with Green’s set. You know the sort. They all went in. I dare say it was all right, and they got good by it; I don’t want to judge them. Only all I could see of their reasons drove me just the other way. ‘Twas ‘because the Doctor liked it;’ ‘no boy got on who didn’t stay the Sacrament;’ it was the ‘correct thing,’ in fact, like having a good hat to wear on Sundays. I couldn’t stand it. I didn’t feel that I wanted to lead a different life.

70,"East stopped speaking, and pegged away more diligently than ever with his pencil. Tom was ready to cry. He felt half sorry at first that he had been confirmed himself. He seemed to have deserted his earliest friend--to have left him by himself at his worst need for those long years. He got up and went and sat by East, and put his arm over his shoulder.",stop speak peg pencil ready cry feel half sorry first confirm seem desert early friend leave bad need long year get go sit put arm shoulder

But then he made it out just as if it was taking the weak side before all the world--going in once for all against everything that’s strong and rich, and proud and respectable, a little band of brothers against the whole world. And the Doctor seemed to say so too, only he said a great deal more.”",tell say do hope honour make take weak side world go strong rich proud respectable little band brother whole world seem say say great deal more 
76,"“Ah!” groaned East, “but there again, that’s just another of my difficulties whenever I think about the matter. I don’t want to be one of your saints, one of your elect, whatever the right phrase is. My sympathies are all the other way--with the many, the poor devils who run about the streets and don’t go to church. Don’t stare, Tom; mind, I’m telling you all that’s in my heart--as far as I know it--but it’s all a muddle. You must be gentle with me if you want to land me. Now I’ve seen a deal of this sort of religion; I was bred up in it, and I can’t stand it. If nineteen-twentieths of the world are to be left to uncovenanted mercies, and that sort of thing, which means in plain English to go to hell, and the other twentieth are to rejoice at it all, why--”",groan difficulty think matter want saint elect right phrase sympathy other way many poor devil run street go church stare mind tell heart know muddle gentle want land see deal sort religion breed stand twentieth world leave uncovenanted mercie sort thing mean plain go hell other twentieth rejoice 
77,"“Oh! but, Harry, they ain’t, they don’t,” broke in Tom, really shocked. “Oh, how I wish Arthur hadn’t gone! I’m such a fool about these things. But it’s all you want too, East; it is indeed. It cuts both ways somehow, being confirmed and taking the Sacrament. It makes you feel on the side of all the good and all the bad too, of everybody in the world. Only there’s some great dark strong power, which is crushing you and everybody else. That’s what Christ conquered, and we’ve got to fight. What a fool I am! I can’t explain.

81,"“Well, when I came to take the Sacrament, I had a great struggle about that. I tried to put him out of my head; and when I couldn’t do that, I tried to think of him as evil--as something that the Lord who was loving me hated, and which I might hate too. But it wouldn’t do. I broke down; I believe Christ Himself broke me down. And when the Doctor gave me the bread and wine, and leant over me praying, I prayed for poor Flashman, as if it had been you or Arthur.”",come take have great struggle try put head do try think evil love hate hate break believe break give bread wine lean pray pray poor 
82,"East buried his face in his hands on the table. Tom could feel the table tremble. At last he looked up. “Thank you again, Tom,” said he; “you don’t know what you may have done for me to-night.

Do you want to speak to me, my man?”",very night prayer follow old verger bear candle watch see turn hear footstep follow close usual say want speak man

92,"“Well, I just told him all about it. You can’t think how kind and gentle he was, the great grim man, whom I’ve feared more than anybody on earth. When I stuck, he lifted me just as if I’d been a little child. And he seemed to know all I’d felt, and to have gone through it all. And I burst out crying--more than I’ve done this five years; and he sat down by me, and stroked my head; and I went blundering on, and told him all--much worse things than I’ve told you. And he wasn’t shocked a bit, and didn’t snub me, or tell me I was a fool, and it was all nothing but pride or wickedness, though I dare say it was. And he didn’t tell me not to follow out my thoughts, and he didn’t give me any cut-and-dried explanation. But when I’d done he just talked a bit. I can hardly remember what he said yet; but it seemed to spread round me like healing, and strength, and light, and to bear me up, and plant me on a rock, where I could hold my footing and fight for myself. I don’t know what to do, I feel so happy. And it’s all owing to you, dear old boy!”  And he seized Tom’s hand again.",tell think kind gentle great grim man fear more earth stick lift little child seem know feel go burst cry more do year sit stroke head go blunder tell bad thing tell shocked bit snub tell fool pride wickedness say tell follow thought give cut dry explanation do talk bit remember say seem spread healing strength light bear plant rock hold footing fight know do feel happy ow dear old boy seize hand

95,"Tom’s delight was as great as his friend’s. But he hadn’t yet had out all his own talk, and was bent on improving the occasion: so he proceeded to propound Arthur’s theory about not being sorry for his friends’ deaths, which he had hitherto kept in the background, and by which he was much exercised; for he didn’t feel it honest to take what pleased him, and throw over the rest, and was trying vigorously to persuade himself that he should like all his best friends to die off-hand.",delight great friend have own talk bend improve occasion proceed propound theory sorry friend death keep background exercise feel honest take pleased throw rest try persuade like good friend die hand
