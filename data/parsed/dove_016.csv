2," EBBO trusted that his kinsman of Wildschloss was safe gone with the Court, and his temper smoothed and his spirits rose in proportion while preparations for a return to Adlerstein were being completed—preparations by which the burgher lady might hope to render the castle far more habitable, not to say baronial, than it had ever been.",trust kinsman safe gone court temper smooth spirit rise proportion preparation return complete preparation burgher lady hope render castle habitable say baronial 
3,"The lady herself felt thankful that her stay at Ulm had turned out well beyond all anticipations in the excellent understanding between her uncle and her sons, and still more in Ebbo’s full submission and personal loyalty towards the imperial family.  The die was cast, and the first step had been taken towards rendering the Adlerstein family the peaceful, honourable nobles she had always longed to see them.",lady feel thankful stay turn anticipation excellent understanding uncle son more full submission personal loyalty imperial family die cast first step take rendering family peaceful honourable noble long see 
4,"She was one afternoon assisting her aunt in some of the duties of her wirthschaft, when Master Gottfried entered the apartment with an air of such extreme complacency that both turned round amazed; the one exclaiming, “Surely funds have come in for finishing the spire!” the other, “Have they appointed thee Provost for next year, house-father?”",afternoon assist aunt duty wirthschaft enter apartment air such extreme complacency turn amaze one exclaim fund come finish spire other appoint next year house father

7,"“And who will do so,” said Master Gottfried.  “For morning gift he promises the farms and lands of Grünau—rich both in forest and corn glebe.  Likewise, her dower shall be upon Wildschloss—where the soil is of the richest pasture, and there are no less than three mills, whence the lord obtains large rights of multure.  Moreover, the Castle was added to and furnished on his marriage with the late baroness, and might serve a Kurfürst; and though the jewels of Freiherrinn Valeska must be inherited by her daughter, yet there are many of higher price which have descended from his own ancestresses, and which will all be hers.”",do say morning gift promise farm land rich forest corn glebe dower soil rich pasture be less mill lord obtain large right multure add furnish marriage late baroness serve jewel inherit daughter be many high price descend own ancestress 
8,"“And what a wedding we will have!” exclaimed Johanna; “it shall be truly baronial.  I will take my hood and go at once to neighbour Sophie Lemsberg, who was wife to the Markgraf’s Under Keller-Meister.  She will tell me point device the ceremonies befitting the espousals of a baron’s widow.”",wedding have exclaim baronial take hood go neighbour wife tell point device ceremony befit espousal baron widow 
9,"Poor Christina had sat all this time with drooping head and clasped hands, a tear stealing down as the formal terms of the treaty sent her spirit back to the urgent, pleading, imperious voice that had said, “Now, little one, thou wilt not shut me out;” and as she glanced at the ring that had lain on that broad palm, she felt as if her sixteen cheerful years had been an injury to her husband in his nameless bloody grave. But protection was so needful in those rude ages, and second marriages so frequent, that reluctance was counted as weakness.  She knew her uncle and aunt would never believe that aught but compulsion had bound her to the rude outlaw, and her habit of submission was so strong that, only when her aunt was actually rising to go and consult her gossip, she found breath to falter,",poor sit time droop head clasp hand tear steal formal term treaty send spirit urgent plead imperious voice say little one shut glance ring lain broad palm feel cheerful year injury husband nameless bloody grave protection needful rude age second marriage frequent reluctance count weakness know uncle aunt believe aught compulsion bind rude outlaw habit submission strong aunt rise go consult gossip find breath falter

11,"“Nay, child, it is the best thing thou couldst do for them.  Wonders hast thou wrought, yet are they too old to be without fatherly authority.  I speak not of Friedel; the lad is gentle and pious, though spirited, but for the baron.  The very eye and temper of my poor brother Hugh—thy father, Stine—are alive again in him.  Yea, I love the lad the better for it, while I fear.

My boy will rule himself for the love of God and of his mother, but he will brook no hand over him—least of all now he is a knight and thinks himself a man.

16,"“Stay, house-father, the little one will doubtless hear reason and submit,” put in the aunt.  “Her sons were goodly and delightsome to her in their upgrowth, but they are well-nigh men.  They will be away to court and camp, to love and marriage; and how will it be with her then, young and fair as she still is?  Well will it be for her to have a stately lord of her own, and a new home of love and honour springing round her.”",stay house father little one hear reason submit put aunt son goodly delightsome upgrowth nigh man court camp love marriage young fair have stately lord own new home love honour spring 
17,"“True,” continued Sorel; “and though she be too pious and wise to reck greatly of such trifles, yet it may please her dreamy brain to hear that Sir Kasimir loves her even like a paladin, and the love of a tried man of six-and-forty is better worth than a mere kindling of youthful fancy.”",true continue pious wise reck such trifle please dreamy brain hear love paladin love try man good worth mere kindling youthful fancy

21,"“Yes, peace,” returned Gottfried in a conciliatory tone,—“peace to the brave Sir Eberhard.  Thine aunt meant no ill of him.  He truly would rejoice that the wisdom of his choice should receive such testimony, and that his sons should be thus well handled.  Nay, little as I heed such toys, it will doubtless please the lads that the baron will obtain of the Emperor letters of nobility for this house, which verily sprang of a good Walloon family, and so their shield will have no blank.  The Romish king promises to give thee rank with any baroness, and hath fully owned what a pearl thou art, mine own sweet dove!

I must to gossip Sophie!”",exclaim clad look widow garb time find procure other raiment father substantial man understand meal gossip

Have I your leave to retire?”",dear mother father say rally little have patience bet know do son willing leave retire

Much had I longed to see thee wedded ere thy sons outgrew thy care, but I shunned proposing even one of our worthy guildmasters, lest my young Freiherr should take offence; but this knight, of his own blood, true and wise as a burgher, and faithful and God-fearing withal, is a better match than I durst hope, and is no doubt a special reward from thy patron saint.”",grant child meditation show fair lot much long see wedd son outgrew care shunn propose worthy guildmaster young take offence knight own blood true wise burgher faithful fear good match durst hope doubt special reward patron saint

26,"She made her way to her own chamber, there to weep and flutter.  Marriage was a matter of such high contract between families that the parties themselves had usually no voice in the matter, and only the widowed had any chance of a personal choice; nor was this always accorded in the case of females, who remained at the disposal of their relatives.  Good substantial wedded affection was not lacking, but romantic love was thought an unnecessary preliminary, and found a vent in extravagant adoration, not always in reputable quarters.  Obedience first to the father, then to the husband, was the first requisite; love might shift for itself; and the fair widow of Adlerstein, telling her beads in sheer perplexity, knew not whether her strong repugnance to this marriage and warm sympathy with her son Ebbo were not an act of rebellion.  Yet each moment did her husband rise before her mind more vividly, with his rugged looks, his warm, tender heart, his dawnings of comprehension, his generous forbearance and reverential love—the love of her youth—to be equalled by no other.  The accomplished courtier and polished man of the world might be his superior, but she loathed the superiority, since it was to her husband.  Might not his one chosen dove keep heart-whole for him to the last?  She recollected that coarsest, cruellest reproach of all that her mother-in-law had been wont to fling at her,—that she, the recent widow, the new-made mother of Eberhard’s babes, in her grief, her terror, and her weakness had sought to captivate this suitor by her blandishments.  The taunt seemed justified, and her cheeks burned with absolute shame “My husband! my loving Eberhard! left with none but me to love thee, unknown to thine own sons!  I cannot, I will not give my heart away from thee!  Thy little bride shall be faithful to thee, whatever betide.  When we meet beyond the grave I will have been thine only, nor have set any before thy sons.  Heaven forgive me if I be undutiful to my uncle; but thou must be preferred before even him!  Hark!” and she started as if at Eberhard’s foot-step; then smiled, recollecting that Ebbo had his father’s tread.  But her husband had been too much in awe of her to enter with that hasty agitated step and exclamation, “Mother, mother, what insolence is this!”",make way own chamber weep flutter marriage matter such high contract family party have voice matter widowed have chance personal choice accord case female remain disposal relative good substantial wedd affection lack romantic love think unnecessary preliminary find vent extravagant adoration reputable quarter obedience father husband first requisite love shift fair widow tell bead sheer perplexity know strong repugnance marriage warm sympathy son act rebellion moment husband rise mind rugged look warm tender heart dawning comprehension generous forbearance reverential love love youth equall other accomplish courtier polished man world superior loath superiority husband one choose dove keep heart whole last recollect coarsest cruellest reproach mother law wont fling recent widow new make mother babe grief terror weakness seek captivate suitor blandishment taunt seem justify cheek burn absolute shame husband loving leave love unknown own son give heart little bride faithful betide meet grave set son heaven forgive undutiful uncle prefer start foot step smile recollect have father tread husband much awe enter hasty agitate step exclamation mother mother insolence

I would have soon silenced his overtures!”",believe assure aught say think know begin know head house tamper mechanical craftsman cap hand sprig nobility silence overture

Nor would I put any between you and me.  Fear me not, Ebbo.  I think the mothers and sons of this wider, fuller world do not prize one another as we do.

37,"“Moreover,” continued Christina, “thine uncle is highly gratified, and cannot believe that I can refuse.  He understands not my love for thy father, and sees many advantages for us all.  I doubt me if he believes I have power to resist his will, and for thee, he would not count thine opposition valid.

39,"“Such a flitting would scarce prove our wisdom,” said Christina, “to run away with thy mother like a lover in a ballad.  Nay, let me first deal gently with thine uncle, and speak myself with Sir Kasimir, so that I may show him the vanity of his suit.  Then will we back to Adlerstein without leaving wounds to requite kindness.”",flitting prove wisdom say run mother lover ballad let deal uncle speak show vanity suit leave wound requite kindness 
40,"Ebbo was wrought on to promise not to attack the burgomaster on the subject, but he was moody and silent, and Master Gottfried let him alone, considering his gloom as another proof of his need of fatherly authority, and as a peace-lover forbearing to provoke his fiery spirit.",wring promise attack burgomaster subject moody silent let consider gloom proof need fatherly authority peace lover forbear provoke fiery spirit

You have never blamed Friedel, at least; and verily, uncle, my mother’s eye will lead me where a stranger’s hand shall never drive me.  Did I even think she had for this man a quarter of the love she bears to my dead father, I would strive for endurance; but in good sooth we found her in tears, praying us to guard her from him.

Yet, if you look to mingling with your own proud kind, ye may fall among greater slights than ye can brook.  It may matter less to you, Sir Baron, but Friedel here, ay, and your sons, will be ineligible to the choicest orders of knighthood, and the canonries and chapters that are honourable endowments.”",spake manly spirit say uncle delighted worth have teach little prize gewgaw look mingling own proud kind fall great slight briok matter less son ineligible choicest order knighthood canonry chapter honourable endowment

62,"The Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss, unprepared for the opposition that awaited him, was riding down the street equipped point device, and with a goodly train of followers, in brilliant suits.  Private wooing did not enter into the honest ideas of the burghers, and the suitor was ushered into the full family assembly, where Christina rose and came forward a few steps to meet him, curtseying as low as he bowed, as he said, “Lady, I have preferred my suit to you through your honour-worthy uncle, who is good enough to stand my friend.”",unprepared opposition await ride street equip point device goodly train follower brilliant suit private woo enter honest idea burgher suitor usher full family assembly rise come few step meet curtsey low bow say prefer suit honour worthy uncle good stand friend

65,"Wildschloss did not talk like a young wooer; such days were over for both; but he spoke as a grave and honourable man, deeply penetrated with true esteem and affection.  He said that at their first meeting he had been struck with her sweetness and discretion, and would soon after have endeavoured to release her from her durance, but that he was bound by the contract already made with the Trautbachs, who were dangerous neighbours to Wildschloss.  He had delayed his distasteful marriage as long as possible, and it had caused him nothing but trouble and strife; his children would not live, and Thekla, the only survivor, was, as his sole heiress, a mark for the cupidity of her uncle, the Count of Trautbach, and his almost savage son Lassla; while the right to the Wildschloss barony would become so doubtful between her and Ebbo, as heir of the male line, that strife and bloodshed would be well-nigh inevitable.  These causes made it almost imperative that he should re-marry, and his own strong preference and regard for little Thekla directed his wishes towards the Freiherrinn von Adlerstein.  He backed his suit with courtly compliments, as well as with representations of his child’s need of a mother’s training, and the twins’ equal want of fatherly guidance, dilating on the benefits he could confer on them.",talk young wooer such day speak grave honourable man penetrate true esteem affection say first meeting strike sweetness discretion endeavour release durance bind contract make dangerous neighbour delay distasteful marriage possible cause trouble strife child live only survivor sole heiress mark cupidity uncle savage son right barony become doubtful heir male line strife bloodshed inevitable cause make imperative re-marry own strong preference regard little direct wish back suit courtly compliment representation child need mother training twin equal want fatherly guidance dilate benefit confer 
66,"Christina felt his kindness, and had full trust in his intentions.  “No” was a difficult syllable to her, but she had that within her which could not accept him; and she firmly told him that she was too much bound to both her Eberhards.  But there was no daunting him, nor preventing her uncle and aunt from encouraging him.  He professed that he would wait, and give her time to consider; and though she reiterated that consideration would not change her mind, Master Gottfried came forward to thank him, and express his confidence of bringing her to reason.",feel kindness have full trust intention difficult syllable have accept tell much bound be daunting prevent uncle aunt encourage profess wait give time consider reiterate consideration change mind come thank express confidence bring reason

Yet, after all, I do not know that any noble training has produced a more high-minded loving youth,” he added, half relenting as he looked at the gallant, earnest face, full of defiance indeed, but with a certain wistful appealing glance at “the motherling,” softening the liquid lustrous dark eye.  “Get thee gone, boy, I would not quarrel with you; and it may be, as Friedel says, that we are best out of one another’s way.

Master Gottfried could scarce refrain from shrugging his shoulders, and Hausfrau Johanna was exceedingly angry with the petulant pride and insolence of the young noble; but, in effect, all were too much relieved to avoid an absolute quarrel with the fiery lad to take exception at minor matters.  The old burgher was forbearing; Christina, who knew how much her son must have swallowed to bring him to this concession for love of her, thought him a hero worthy of all sacrifices; and peace-making Friedel, by his aunt’s side, soon softened even her, by some of the persuasive arguments that old dames love from gracious, graceful, great-nephews.",say emperor reconcile town scarce refrain shrugg shoulder angry petulant pride insolence young noble effect relieve avoid absolute quarrel fiery lad take exception minor matter old burgher forbear know much son swallow bring concession love think hero worthy sacrifice peace make aunt side soften persuasive argument old dame love gracious graceful great nephew 
83,"And when, by and by, Master Gottfried went out to call on Sir Kasimir, and explain how he had thought it best to yield to the hot-tempered lad, and let the family learn how to be thankful for the goods they had rejected, he found affairs in a state that made him doubly anxious that the young barons should be safe on their mountain without knowing of them.  The Trautbach family had heard of Wildschloss’s designs, and they had set abroad such injurious reports respecting the Lady of Adlerstein, that Sir Kasimir was in the act of inditing a cartel to be sent by Count Kaulwitz, to demand an explanation—not merely as the lady’s suitor, but as the only Adlerstein of full age.  Now, if Ebbo had heard of the rumour, he would certainly have given the lie direct, and taken the whole defence on himself; and it may be feared that, just as his cause might have been, Master Gottfried’s faith did not stretch to believing that it would make his sixteen-year-old arm equal to the brutal might of Lassla of Trautbach.  So he heartily thanked the Baron of Wildschloss, agreed with him that the young knights were not as yet equal to the maintenance of the cause, and went home again to watch carefully that no report reached either of his nephews.  Nor did he breathe freely till he had seen the little party ride safe off in the early morning, in much more lordly guise than when they had entered the city.",go call explain think good yield hot temper lad let family learn thankful goods reject find affair state make anxious young baron safe mountain know family hear design set such injurious report respect act indit cartel send demand explanation lady suitor only full age hear rumour give lie direct take whole defence fear cause faith stretch believe make year old arm equal brutal might thank agree young knight equal maintenance cause go watch report reach nephew breathe see little party ride safe early morning lordly guise enter city 
84,"As to Wildschloss and his nephew of Trautbach, in spite of their relationship they had a sharp combat on the borders of their own estates, in which both were severely wounded; but Sir Kasimir, with the misericorde in his grasp, forced Lassla to retract whatever he had said in dispraise of the Lady of Adlerstein.  Wily old Gottfried took care that the tidings should be sent in a form that might at once move Christina with pity and gratitude towards her champion, and convince her sons that the adversary was too much hurt for them to attempt a fresh challenge.",nephew spite relationship have sharp combat border own estate wound misericorde grasp force retract say dispraise old take care tiding send form move pity gratitude champion convince son adversary hurt attempt fresh challenge
