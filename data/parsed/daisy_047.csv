3,"   Then out into the world, my course I did determine;    Though, to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming.

4," In the meantime, the session of Parliament had begun, and the Rivers’ party had, since February, inhabited Park Lane. Meta had looked pale and pensive, as she bade her friends at Stoneborough good-bye; but only betrayed that she had rather have stayed at home, by promising herself great enjoyment in meeting them again at Easter.",meantime session begin party inhabit look pale pensive bid friend good bye betray stay home promise great enjoyment meet 
5,"Flora was, on the other hand, in the state of calm patronage that betokened perfect satisfaction. She promised wonders for Miss Bracy’s sisters--talked of inviting Mary and Blanche to see sights and take lessons; and undertook to send all the apparatus needed by Cocksmoor school; and she did, accordingly, send down so many wonderful articles, that curate and schoolmistress were both frightened; Mrs. Taylor thought the easels were new-fashioned instruments of torture; and Ethel found herself in a condition to be liberal to Stoneborough National School.",other hand state calm patronage betoken perfect satisfaction promise wonder sister talk invite see sight take lesson undertake send apparatus need school send many wonderful article curate schoolmistress frighten think easel new fashioned instrument torture find condition liberal national 
6,"Flora was a capital correspondent, and made it her business to keep Margaret amused, so that the home-party were well informed of the doings of each of her days--and very clever her descriptions were. She had given herself a dispensation from general society until after Easter; but, in the meantime, both she and Meta seemed to find great enjoyment in country rides and drives, and in quiet little dinners at home, to George’s agreeable political friends. With the help of two such ladies as Mrs. and Miss Rivers, Ethel could imagine George’s house pleasant enough to attract clever people; but she was surprised to find how full her sister’s letters were of political news.",capital correspondent make business keep amuse home party inform doing day clever description give dispensation general society meantime seem find great enjoyment country ride drive quiet little dinner home agreeable political friend help such lady imagine house pleasant attract clever person surprise find full sister letter political news 
7,"It was a period when great interests were in agitation; and the details of London talk and opinions were extremely welcome. Dr. Spencer used to come in to ask after “Mrs. Rivers’s Intelligencer”; and, when he heard the lucid statements, would say, she ought to have been a “special correspondent.” And her father declared that her news made him twice as welcome to his patients; but her cleverest sentences always were prefaced with “George says,” or “George thinks,” in a manner that made her appear merely the dutiful echo of his sentiments.",period great interest agitation detail talk opinion welcome use come ask hear lucid statement say special correspondent father declare news make welcome patient cleverest sentence preface say think manner make appear dutiful echo sentiment 
8,"In an early letter, Flora mentioned how she had been reminded of poor Harry, by finding Miss Walkinghame’s card. That lady lived with her mother at Richmond, and, on returning the visit, Flora was warmly welcomed by the kind old Lady Walkinghame, who insisted on her bringing her baby and spending a long day. The sisters-in-law had been enchanted with Miss Walkinghame, whose manners, wrote Flora, certainly merited papa’s encomium.",early letter mention remind poor find card lady live mother return visit welcome kind old insist bring baby spend long day sister law enchant manners write merite papa encomium 
9,"On the promised “long day,” they found an unexpected addition to the party, Sir Henry Walkinghame, who had newly returned from the continent. “A fine-looking, agreeable man, about five-and-thirty,” Flora described him, “very lively and entertaining. He talked a great deal of Dr. Spencer, and of the life in the caves at Thebes; and he asked me whether that unfortunate place, Cocksmoor, did not owe a great deal to me, or to one of my sisters. I left Meta to tell him that story, and they became very sociable over it.”",promise long day find unexpected addition party return continent fine look agreeable man describe lively entertaining talk great deal life cave ask unfortunate place owe great deal sister leave tell story become sociable

11,"By and by Sir Henry was the second cavalier, when they went to an oratorio, and Meta’s letter overflowed with the descriptions she had heard from him of Italian church music. He always went to Rome for Easter, and had been going as usual, this spring, but he lingered, and, for once, remained in England, where he had only intended to spend a few days on necessary business.",second cavalier go oratorio letter overflow description hear italian church music go go usual spring linger remain intend spend few day necessary business 
12,"The Easter recess was not spent at the Grange, but at Lady Leonora’s pretty house in Surrey. She had invited the party in so pressing a manner that Flora did not think it right to decline. Meta expressed some disappointment at missing Easter among her school-children, but she said a great deal about the primroses and the green corn-fields, and nightingales--all which Ethel would have set down to her trick of universal content, if it had not appeared that Sir Henry was there too, and shared in all the delicious rides.",recess spend house invite party press manner think right decline express disappointment miss school child say great deal primrose green corn field nightingale set trick universal content appear share delicious ride 
13,"“What would Ethel say,” wrote Flora, “to have our little Meta as Lady of the Manor of Cocksmoor? He has begun to talk about Drydale, and there are various suspicious circumstances that Lady Leonora marks with the eyes of a discreet dowager. It was edifying to see how, from smiles, we came to looks, and by and by to confidential talks, which have made her entirely forgive me for having so many tall brothers. Poor dear old Mr. Rivers! Lady Leonora owns that it was the best thing possible for that sweet girl that he did not live any longer to keep her in seclusion; it is so delightful to see her appreciated as she deserves, and with her beauty and fortune, she might make any choice she pleases. In fact, I believe Lady Leonora would like to look still higher for her, but this would be mere ambition, and we should be far better satisfied with such a connection as this, founded on mutual and increasing esteem, with a man so well suited to her, and fixing her so close to us. You must not, however, launch out into an ocean of possibilities, for the good aunt has only infected me with the castle-building propensities of chaperons, and Meta is perfectly unconscious, looking on him as too hopelessly middle-aged, to entertain any such evil designs, avowing freely that she likes him, and treating him very nearly as she does papa. It is my business to keep ‘our aunt,’ who, between ourselves, has, below the surface, the vulgarity of nature that high-breeding cannot eradicate, from startling the little humming-bird, before the net has been properly twined round her bright little heart. As far as I can see, he is much smitten, but very cautious in his approaches, and he is wise.”",say write have little begin talk be various suspicious circumstance mark eye discreet dowager edifying see smile come look confidential talk make forgive have many tall brother poor dear old own good thing possible sweet girl live keep seclusion delightful see appreciate deserve beauty fortune make choice please fact believe like look high mere ambition satisfied connection found mutual increase esteem man suit fix close launch ocean possibility good aunt infect castle building propensity chaperon unconscious look middle aged entertain such evil design avow like treat do papa business keep aunt surface vulgarity nature high breeding eradicate startling little hum bird net twin bright little heart see smitten cautious approach wise 
14,"Margaret did not know what dismay she conveyed, as she handed this letter to her sister. There was no rest for Ethel till she could be alone with her father. “Could nothing prevent it? Could not Flora be told of Mr. Rivers’s wishes?” she asked.",know dismay convey hand letter sister be rest alone father prevent tell wish ask

19,"“Absurd! The lad is hardly one-and-twenty. Very few marry a first love.” (Ah, Ethel!) “Poor old Rivers only mentioned it as a refuge from fortune-hunters, and it stands to reason that he would have preferred this. Anyway, it is awkward for a man with empty pockets to marry an heiress, and it is wholesomer for him to work for his living. Better that it should be out of his head at once, if it were there at all. I trust it was all our fancy. I would not have him grieved now for worlds, when his heart is sore.”",absurd lad few marry first love poor old river mention refuge fortune hunter stand reason prefer awkward man empty pocket marry heiress wholesomer work living good head trust fancy have grieve world heart sore

22,"Ethel did not know whether she desired a tete-a-tete with Norman or not. She was aware that he had seen Flora’s letter, and she did not believe that he would ever mention the hopes that must have been dashed by it; or, if he should do so, how could she ever guard her father’s secret? At least, she had the comfort of recognising the accustomed Norman in his manner, low-spirited, indeed, and more than ever dreamy and melancholy, but not in the unnatural and excited state that had made her unhappy about him. She could not help telling Dr. Spencer that this was much more the real brother.",know desire tete tete aware see letter believe mention hope dash do guard father secret least have comfort recognise accustom manner low spirit more dreamy melancholy unnatural excited state make unhappy help tell real brother

Self-examination notes the symptoms and combats them; self-contemplation does as I did when I was unstrung by that illness at Poonshedagore, and was always feeling my own pulse. It dwells on them, and perpetually deplores itself. Oh, dear! this is no better--what a wretch I am.

34,"How Ethel was to take care of him she did not know; she could only keep a heedful eye on him, and rejoice when he took Tom out for a long walk--a companion certainly not likely to promote the working of the brain--but though it was in the opposite direction to Cocksmoor, Tom came home desperately cross, snubbed Gertrude, and fagged Aubrey; but, then, as Blanche observed, perhaps that was only because his trousers were splashed.",take care know keep heedful eye rejoice take long walk companion likely promote working brain opposite direction come cross snubb fagg observe trousers splash 
35,"In her next solitary walk to Cocksmoor, Norman joined Ethel. She was gratified, but she could not think of one safe word worth saying to him, and for a mile they preserved an absolute silence, until he first began, “Ethel, I have been thinking--”",next solitary walk join gratified think safe word worth say mile preserve absolute silence begin think

I could always overthrow them, but when I came to glory in doing so, perhaps I prayed less. Anyway, they left a sting.

If you think my going would be too much grief for papa, or if Tom be set against helping him in his practice, there is an evident leading of Providence, showing that I am unworthy of this work.

111,"“It is far deeper,” said Ethel; and she related great part of what she had heard in the afternoon. It was not easy to make her father listen--his line was to be positively indignant, rather than compassionate, when he heard of the doubts that had assailed poor Norman. “Foolish boy, what business had he to meddle with those accursed books, when he knew what they were made of--it was tasting poison, it was running into temptation! He had no right to expect to come out safe--” and then he grasped tightly hold of Ethel’s hands, and, as if the terror had suddenly flashed on him, asked her, with dilated eye and trembling voice, whether she were sure that he was safe, and held the faith.",deep say relate great part hear afternoon easy make father listen line indignant compassionate hear doubt assail poor foolish boy business have meddle accurse book know make taste poison run temptation have right expect come safe grasp hold hand terror flash ask dilated eye tremble voice sure safe hold faith

Nothing could be done yet, he must wait patiently for the present, but he was to write to his uncle, Mr. Arnott, in New Zealand, and, without pledging himself, to make inquiries as to the mission; and in the meantime, return to Oxford, where, to his other studies, he was to add a course of medical lectures, which, as Dr. May said, would do him no harm, would occupy his mind, and might turn to use wherever he was.",hear warmest gratitude father kindness do wait present write uncle new pledg make inquiry mission meantime return other study add course medical lecture say do harm occupy mind turn use

Why should he tell any one so unsympathetic as Flora, who would think him wasted in either case?",surprise find write expression resolution find spare assist father physician give mission new tell one unsympathetic think waste case
