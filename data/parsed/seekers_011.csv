1,CHAPTER 11. CASTILIAN AMOROSO,castilian 
2,"One day when we suddenly found that we had half a crown we decided that we really ought to try Dicky’s way of restoring our fallen fortunes while yet the deed was in our power. Because it might easily have happened to us never to have half a crown again. So we decided to dally no longer with being journalists and bandits and things like them, but to send for sample and instructions how to earn two pounds a week each in our spare time. We had seen the advertisement in the paper, and we had always wanted to do it, but we had never had the money to spare before, somehow. The advertisement says: ‘Any lady or gentleman can easily earn two pounds a week in their spare time. Sample and instructions, two shillings. Packed free from observation.’ A good deal of the half-crown was Dora’s. It came from her godmother; but she said she would not mind letting Dicky have it if he would pay her back before Christmas, and if we were sure it was right to try to make our fortune that way. Of course that was quite easy, because out of two pounds a week in your spare time you can easily pay all your debts, and have almost as much left as you began with; and as to the right we told her to dry up.",day find have crown decide try way restore fall fortune deed power happen have crown decide dally journalist bandit thing send sample instruction earn pound week spare time see advertisement paper want do have money spare advertisement say lady gentleman earn pound week spare time sample instruction shilling pack free observation good deal half crown come godmother say mind let have pay sure right try make fortune way course easy pound week spare time pay debt have much left begin right tell dry 
3,"Dicky had always thought that this was really the best way to restore our fallen fortunes, and we were glad that now he had a chance of trying because of course we wanted the two pounds a week each, and besides, we were rather tired of Dicky’s always saying, when our ways didn’t turn out well, ‘Why don’t you try the sample and instructions about our spare time?’",think good way restore fall fortune glad have chance try course want pound week tired say way turn try sample instruction spare time 
4,"When we found out about our half-crown we got the paper. Noel was playing admirals in it, but he had made the cocked hat without tearing the paper, and we found the advertisement, and it said just the same as ever. So we got a two-shilling postal order and a stamp, and what was left of the money it was agreed we would spend in ginger-beer to drink success to trade.",find half crown get paper play admiral make cocked hat tear paper find advertisement say same get shilling postal order stamp leave money agree spend ginger beer drink success trade 
5,"We got some nice paper out of Father’s study, and Dicky wrote the letter, and we put in the money and put on the stamp, and made H. O. post it. Then we drank the ginger-beer, and then we waited for the sample and instructions. It seemed a long time coming, and the postman got quite tired of us running out and stopping him in the street to ask if it had come.",get nice paper study write letter put money put stamp make post drink ginger beer wait sample instruction seem long time come postman get tired run stop street ask come 
6,"But on the third morning it came. It was quite a large parcel, and it was packed, as the advertisement said it would be, ‘free from observation.’ That means it was in a box; and inside the box was some stiff browny cardboard, crinkled like the galvanized iron on the tops of chicken-houses, and inside that was a lot of paper, some of it printed and some scrappy, and in the very middle of it all a bottle, not very large, and black, and sealed on the top of the cork with yellow sealing-wax.",third morning come large parcel pack advertisement say free observation mean box box stiff browny cardboard crinkle galvanize iron top chicken house lot paper print scrappy very middle bottle large black seal top cork yellow sealing wax 
7,"We looked at it as it lay on the nursery table, and while all the others grabbed at the papers to see what the printing said, Oswald went to look for the corkscrew, so as to see what was inside the bottle. He found the corkscrew in the dresser drawer--it always gets there, though it is supposed to be in the sideboard drawer in the dining-room--and when he got back the others had read most of the printed papers.",look lay nursery table other grab paper see printing say go look corkscrew see bottle find corkscrew dresser drawer get suppose sideboard drawer dining room get other read most print paper 
8,"‘I don’t think it’s much good, and I don’t think it’s quite nice to sell wine,’ Dora said ‘and besides, it’s not easy to suddenly begin to sell things when you aren’t used to it.’",think good think nice sell wine say easy begin sell thing use 
9,"‘I don’t know,’ said Alice; ‘I believe I could.’ They all looked rather down in the mouth, though, and Oswald asked how you were to make your two pounds a week.",know say believe look mouth ask make pound week 
10,"‘Why, you’ve got to get people to taste that stuff in the bottle. It’s sherry--Castilian Amoroso its name is--and then you get them to buy it, and then you write to the people and tell them the other people want the wine, and then for every dozen you sell you get two shillings from the wine people, so if you sell twenty dozen a week you get your two pounds. I don’t think we shall sell as much as that,’ said Dicky.",get get person taste stuff bottle sherry name get buy write person tell other person want wine sell get shilling wine person sell week get pound think sell much say 
11,"‘We might not the first week,’ Alice said, ‘but when people found out how nice it was, they would want more and more. And if we only got ten shillings a week it would be something to begin with, wouldn’t it?’",first week say person find nice want more more get shilling week begin 
12,"Oswald said he should jolly well think it would, and then Dicky took the cork out with the corkscrew. The cork broke a good deal, and some of the bits went into the bottle. Dora got the medicine glass that has the teaspoons and tablespoons marked on it, and we agreed to have a teaspoonful each, to see what it was like.",say jolly think take cork corkscrew cork break good deal bit go bottle get medicine glass have teaspoon tablespoon mark agree have teaspoonful see 
13,"‘No one must have more than that,’ Dora said, ‘however nice it is.’",have more say nice 
14,"Dora behaved rather as if it were her bottle. I suppose it was, because she had lent the money for it.",behave bottle suppose loan money 
15,"Then she measured out the teaspoonful, and she had first go, because of being the eldest. We asked at once what it was like, but Dora could not speak just then.",measure teaspoonful go old ask speak 
16,"Then she said, ‘It’s like the tonic Noel had in the spring; but perhaps sherry ought to be like that.’",say tonic have spring sherry 
17,Then it was Oswald’s turn. He thought it was very burny; but he said nothing. He wanted to see first what the others would say.,turn think burny say want see first other say 
18,"Dicky said his was simply beastly, and Alice said Noel could taste next if he liked.",say say taste like

20,"Then H. O. had his, and he spat it out in the fire, which was very rude and nasty, and we told him so.",have spat fire rude nasty tell 
21,"Then it was Alice’s turn. She said, ‘Only half a teaspoonful for me, Dora. We mustn’t use it all up.’ And she tasted it and said nothing.",turn say teaspoonful use taste say 
22,"Then Dicky said: ‘Look here, I chuck this. I’m not going to hawk round such beastly stuff. Any one who likes can have the bottle. Quis?’",say look chuck go hawk such beastly stuff one like have bottle 
23,"And Alice got out ‘Ego’ before the rest of us. Then she said, ‘I know what’s the matter with it. It wants sugar.’",get rest say know matter want sugar 
24,"And at once we all saw that that was all there was the matter with the stuff. So we got two lumps of sugar and crushed it on the floor with one of the big wooden bricks till it was powdery, and mixed it with some of the wine up to the tablespoon mark, and it was quite different, and not nearly so nasty.",see matter stuff get lump sugar crush floor big wooden brick powdery mix wine tablespoon mark different nasty 
25,"‘You see it’s all right when you get used to it,’ Dicky said. I think he was sorry he had said ‘Quis?’ in such a hurry.",see right get use say think sorry say hurry 
26,"‘Of course,’ Alice said, ‘it’s rather dusty. We must crush the sugar carefully in clean paper before we put it in the bottle.’",course say dusty crush sugar clean paper put bottle 
27,"Dora said she was afraid it would be cheating to make one bottle nicer than what people would get when they ordered a dozen bottles, but Alice said Dora always made a fuss about everything, and really it would be quite honest.",say afraid cheating make bottle nice person get order bottle say make fuss honest 
28,"‘You see,’ she said, ‘I shall just tell them, quite truthfully, what we have done to it, and when their dozens come they can do it for themselves.’",see say tell do dozen come do 
29,"So then we crushed eight more lumps, very cleanly and carefully between newspapers, and shook it up well in the bottle, and corked it up with a screw of paper, brown and not news, for fear of the poisonous printing ink getting wet and dripping down into the wine and killing people. We made Pincher have a taste, and he sneezed for ever so long, and after that he used to go under the sofa whenever we showed him the bottle.",crush more lump newspaper shake bottle cork screw paper brown news fear poisonous printing ink get wet drip wine kill person make have taste sneez use go sofa show bottle 
30,"Then we asked Alice who she would try and sell it to. She said: ‘I shall ask everybody who comes to the house. And while we are doing that, we can be thinking of outside people to take it to. We must be careful: there’s not much more than half of it left, even counting the sugar.’",ask try sell say ask come house do think outside person take careful be much more half leave count sugar 
31,"We did not wish to tell Eliza--I don’t know why. And she opened the door very quickly that day, so that the Taxes and a man who came to our house by mistake for next door got away before Alice had a chance to try them with the Castilian Amoroso. But about five Eliza slipped out for half an hour to see a friend who was making her a hat for Sunday, and while she was gone there was a knock. Alice went, and we looked over the banisters. When she opened the door, she said at once, ‘Will you walk in, please?’ The person at the door said, ‘I called to see your Pa, miss. Is he at home?’",wish tell know open door day man come house mistake next door get have chance try castilian slip hour see friend make hat gone knock go look banister open door say walk person door say call see miss home

34,"But Alice only kept on saying, ‘Will you walk in, please?’ so at last the man did, rubbing his boots very loudly on the mat.",keep say walk last man rub boot mat 
35,"Then Alice shut the front door, and we saw that it was the butcher, with an envelope in his hand. He was not dressed in blue, like when he is cutting up the sheep and things in the shop, and he wore knickerbockers. Alice says he came on a bicycle. She led the way into the dining-room, where the Castilian Amoroso bottle and the medicine glass were standing on the table all ready.",shut front door see butcher envelope hand dress blue cut sheep thing shop wear knickerbocker say come bicycle lead way dining room castilian bottle medicine glass stand table ready 
36,"The others stayed on the stairs, but Oswald crept down and looked through the door-crack.",other stay stair creep look door crack 
37,"‘Please sit down,’ said Alice quite calmly, though she told me afterwards I had no idea how silly she felt. And the butcher sat down. Then Alice stood quite still and said nothing, but she fiddled with the medicine glass and put the screw of brown paper straight in the Castilian bottle.",sit say tell have idea silly feel butcher sit stand say fiddle medicine glass put screw brown paper castilian bottle

40,"And then she stood still again and said nothing. It was beginning to look very idiotic of her, and H. O. laughed. I went back and cuffed him for it quite quietly, and I don’t think the butcher heard.",stand say begin look idiotic laugh go cuff think butcher hear 
41,"But Alice did, and it roused her from her stupor. She spoke suddenly, very fast indeed--so fast that I knew she had made up what she was going to say before. She had got most of it out of the circular.",rouse stupor speak know make go say get most circular 
42,"She said, ‘I want to call your attention to a sample of sherry wine I have here. It is called Castilian something or other, and at the price it is unequalled for flavour and bouquet.’",say want call attention sample sherry wine have call castilian other price unequalled flavour bouquet

46,Alice poured some out.,pour 
47,"The butcher tasted a very little. He licked his lips, and we thought he was going to say how good it was. But he did not. He put down the medicine glass with nearly all the stuff left in it (we put it back in the bottle afterwards to save waste) and said, ‘Excuse me, miss, but isn’t it a little sweet?--for sherry I mean?’",butcher taste little lick lip think go say good put medicine glass stuff leave put bottle save waste say excuse miss little sweet sherry mean

49,"Alice did not speak for a minute, and then she said--",speak minute say

57,"‘No, thank you, miss,’ he said; ‘it’s my favourite wine, but it doesn’t agree with me; not the least bit. But I’ve an uncle drinks it. Suppose I ordered him half a dozen for a Christmas present? Well, miss, here’s the shilling commission, anyway,’ and he pulled out a handful of money and gave her the shilling.",thank miss say favourite wine agree least bit have uncle drink suppose order present miss shilling commission pull handful money give shilling 
58,"‘But I thought the wine people paid that,’ Alice said.",think wine person pay say

63,"Nobody came next day, but the day after a lady came to ask for money to build an orphanage for the children of dead sailors. And we saw her. I went in with Alice.

65,"She was not a young lady, and she had a mantle with beads, and the beads had come off in places--leaving a browny braid showing, and she had printed papers about the dead sailors in a sealskin bag, and the seal had come off in places, leaving the skin bare. We gave her a tablespoonful of the wine in a proper wine-glass out of the sideboard, because she was a lady. And when she had tasted it she got up in a very great hurry, and shook out her dress and snapped her bag shut, and said, ‘You naughty, wicked children! What do you mean by playing a trick like this? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves! I shall write to your Mamma about it. You dreadful little girl!--you might have poisoned me.

71,"So I said, ‘Don’t mention it,’ and shook hands with her, and let her out. Of course we couldn’t have asked her to buy the wine after what she’d said. But I think she was not a bad sort of person. I do like a person to say they’re sorry when they ought to be--especially a grown-up. They do it so seldom. I suppose that’s why we think so much of it.",say mention shake hand let course ask buy wine say think bad sort person like person say sorry grow do suppose think much

I am glad I am not made to think about it every day.",feel jolly go dining room see different mother different father different glad make think day 
73,"I went and found Alice, and told her what the lady had said, and when she had finished crying we put away the bottle and said we would not try to sell any more to people who came.

74,"The bottle got quite dusty where we had put it, and perhaps the dust of ages would have laid thick and heavy on it, only a clergyman called when we were all out. He was not our own clergyman--Mr Bristow is our own clergyman, and we all love him, and we would not try to sell sherry to people we like, and make two pounds a week out of them in our spare time. It was another clergyman, just a stray one; and he asked Eliza if the dear children would not like to come to his little Sunday school. We always spend Sunday afternoons with Father. But as he had left the name of his vicarage with Eliza, and asked her to tell us to come, we thought we would go and call on him, just to explain about Sunday afternoons, and we thought we might as well take the sherry with us.",bottle get dusty put dust age lay thick heavy clergyman call own clergyman own clergyman love try sell sherry person like make pound week spare time clergyman stray one ask dear child like come little school spend afternoon leave name vicarage ask tell come think go call explain afternoon think take sherry

He was stout and short, and wore spectacles.",let shut front door show tidy room bookcase full lot book cover black cotton white label dull picture harmonium write desk drawer copy book stout short wear spectacle
