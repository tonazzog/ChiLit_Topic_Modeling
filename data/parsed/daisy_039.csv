4," Etheldred was thankful for that confidence to Meta Rivers, for without it, she would hardly have succeeded in spurring Norman up to give the finishing touches to Decius, and to send him in. If she talked of the poem as the devotion of Decius, he was willing enough, and worked with spirit, for he liked the ideas, and enjoyed the expressing them, and trying to bring his lines to his notion of perfection, but if she called it the “Newdigate,” or the “Prize Poem,” and declared herself sure it would be successful, he yawned, slackened, leaned back in his chair, and began to read other people’s poetry, which Ethel was disrespectful enough not to think nearly as good as his own.",thankful confidence succeed spurr give finish touch send talk poem devotion willing work spirit like idea enjoy express try bring line notion perfection call declare sure successful yawn slacken learn chair begin read other person poetry disrespectful think good own 
5,"It was completed at last, and Ethel stitched it up with a narrow red and white ribbon--the Balliol colours; and set Meta at him till a promise was extorted that he would send it in.",complete last stitch narrow red white ribbon colour set promise extort send

10," They were too much accustomed to Norman’s successes to be extraordinarily excited; Ethel would have been much mortified if the prize had been awarded to any one else, but, as it was, it came rather as a matter of course. The doctor was greatly pleased, and said he should drive round by Abbotstoke to tell the news there, and then laughed beyond measure to hear that Meta had been in the plot, saying he should accuse the little humming-bird of being a magpie, stealing secrets.",accustom success excited mortify prize award one else come matter course doctor pleased say drive tell news laugh measure hear plot say accuse little hum bird magpie steal secret 
11,"By this time the bride and bridegroom were writing that they thought of soon returning; they had spent the early spring at Paris, had wandered about in the south of France, and now were at Paris again. Flora’s letters were long, descriptive, and affectionate, and she was eager to be kept fully informed of everything at home. As soon as she heard of Norman’s success, she wrote a whole budget of letters, declaring that she and George would hear of no refusal; they were going to spend a fortnight at Oxford for the Commemoration, and must have Meta and Ethel with them to hear Norman’s poem in the theatre.",time bride bridegroom write think return spend early spring wander south letter long descriptive affectionate eager keep inform home hear success write whole budget letter declare hear refusal go spend fortnight have hear poem theatre 
12,"Dr. May, who already had expressed a hankering to run up for the day and take Ethel with him, was perfectly delighted at the proposal, and so was Mr. Rivers, but the young ladies made many demurs. Ethel wanted Mary to go in her stead, and had to be told that this would not be by any means the same to the other parties--she could not bear to leave Margaret; it was a long time since there had been letters from the Alcestis, and she did not like to miss being at home when they should come; and Meta, on her side, was so unwilling to leave her father that, at last, Dr. May scolded them both for a pair of conceited, self-important damsels, who thought nothing could go on without them; and next, compared them to young birds, obliged to be shoved by force into flying.",express hankering run day take delighted proposal young lady make many demur want go stead have tell means same other party bear leave long time be letter like miss home come side unwilling leave father last scold pair conceited self important damsel think go compare young bird oblige shove force fly 
13,"Meta consented first, on condition that Ethel would; and Ethel found that her whole house would be greatly disappointed if she refused, so she proceeded to be grateful, and then discovered how extremely delightful the plan was. Oxford, of which she had heard so much, and which she had always wished to see! And Norman’s glory--and Meta’s company--nay, the very holiday, and going from home, were charms enough for a girl of eighteen, who had never been beyond Whitford in her life. Besides, to crown all, papa promised that, if his patients would behave well, and not want him too much, he would come up for the one great day.",consent condition find whole house disappoint refuse proceed grateful discover delightful plan hear much wish see glory company very holiday go home charm girl life crown promise patient behave want much come great day 
14,"Mr. and Mrs. George Rivers came to Abbotstoke to collect their party. They arrived by a railroad, whose station was nearer to Abbotstoke than to Stoneborough, therefore, instead of their visiting the High Street by the way, Dr. May, with Ethel and Mary, were invited to dine at the Grange, the first evening--a proposal, at least, as new and exciting to Mary as was the journey to Oxford to her sister.",come collect party arrive railroad station nearer visit high way invite dine first evening proposal least new exciting journey sister 
15,"The two girls went early, as the travellers had intended to arrive before luncheon, and, though Ethel said few words, but let Mary rattle on with a stream of conjectures and questions, her heart was full of longings for her sister, as well as of strange doubts and fears, as to the change that her new life might have made in her.",girl go traveller intend arrive luncheon say few word let rattle stream conjecture question heart full longing sister strange doubt fear change new life make

17,"Flora and Meta were both standing on the steps before the conservatory, and Mary made but one bound before she was hugging Flora. Ethel kissed her without so much violence, and then saw that Flora was looking very well and bright, more decidedly pretty and elegant than ever, and with certainly no diminution of affection; it was warmer, though rather more patronising.",stand step conservatory make bind hug kiss much violence see look well bright pretty elegant diminution affection warm patronising

I made bold to say the woman should show her to papa, to see if she had done her any harm, and he found that it was all a fabrication from one end to the other.

45,"Mr. Rivers was pretty well--George, quite well, and somewhere in the garden; and Meta said that he had such a beard that they would hardly know him; while Flora added that he was delighted with the Oxford scheme. Flora’s rooms had been, already, often shown to her sisters, when Mr. Rivers had been newly furnishing them, with every luxury and ornament that taste could devise. Her dressing-room, with the large bay window, commanding a beautiful view of Stoneborough, and filled, but not crowded, with every sort of choice article, was a perfect exhibition to eyes unaccustomed to such varieties.",garden say have beard know add delight scheme room show sister furnish luxury ornament taste devise dress room large bay window commanding beautiful view fill crowd sort choice article perfect exhibition eye unaccustom such variety

60,"“I’m sure I see no harm in myself,” said Ethel, turning towards the pier-glass, and surveying herself--in a white muslin, made high, a black silk mantle, and a brown hat. She had felt very respectable when she set out, but she could not avoid a lurking conviction that, beside Flora and Meta, it had a scanty, schoolgirl effect. “And,” she continued quaintly, “besides, I have really got a new gown on purpose--a good useful silk, that papa chose at Whitford--just the colour of a copper tea-kettle, where it turns purple.”",sure see harm say turn pier glass survey white muslin make high black silk mantle brown hat feel respectable set avoid lurk conviction have scanty schoolgirl effect continue get new gown purpose good useful silk papa choose colour copper tea kettle turn purple

No, my dear tea-kettle, I take you to Oxford on my own terms, and you had better submit, without a fuss, and be thankful it is no worse. George wanted me to buy you a white brocade, with a perfect flower-garden on it, that you could have examined with a microscope. I was obliged to let him buy that lace mantle, to make up to him.

63,"Meta opened the folding-doors into Flora’s bedroom, and thence came forward Bellairs and a little brisk Frenchwoman, whom Flora had acquired at Paris. The former, who was quite used to adorning Miss Ethel against her will, looked as amused as her mistresses; and, before Ethel knew what was going on, her muslin was stripped off her back, and that instrument of torture, a half made body, was being tried upon her. She made one of her most wonderful grimaces of despair, and stood still. The dresses were not so bad after all; they were more tasteful than costly, and neither in material nor ornament were otherwise than suitable to the occasion and the wearer. It was very kind and thoughtful of Flora--that she could not but feel--nothing had been forgotten, but when Ethel saw the mantles, the ribbons, the collars, the bonnet, all glistening with the French air of freshness and grace, she began to feel doubts and hesitations, whether she ought to let her sister go to such an expense on her account, and privately resolved that the accepting thanks should not be spoken till she should have consulted her father.",open fold door bedroom thence come little brisk acquire former use adorn will look amuse mistress know go muslin stripp back instrument torture half make body try make wonderful grimace despair stand dress bad tasteful costly material ornament suitable occasion wearer kind thoughtful feel forget see mantle ribbon collar bonnet glisten french air freshness grace begin feel doubt hesitation let sister go expense account resolve accept thanks speak consult father 
64,"In the meantime, she could only endure, be laughed at by her elders, and entertained by Mary’s extreme pleasure in her array. Good Mary--it was more than any comedy to her; she had not one moment’s thought of herself, till, when Flora dived into her box, produced a pair of bracelets, and fastened them on her comfortable plump arms, her eyes grew wide with wonder, and she felt, at least, two stages nearer womanhood.",meantime endure laugh elder entertain extreme pleasure array good more comedy have moment think dive box produce pair bracelet fasten comfortable plump arm eye grow wide wonder feel least stage nearer womanhood 
65,"Flora had omitted no one. There was a Paris present for every servant at home, and a needle-case even for Cherry Elwood, for which Ethel thanked her with a fervency wanting in her own case.",omit be present servant home needle case thank fervency want own case 
66,"She accomplished consulting her father on her scruples, and he set her mind at rest. He knew that the outlay was a mere trifle to the Riverses, and was greatly pleased and touched with the affection that Flora showed; so he only smiled at Ethel’s doubts, and dwelt with heartfelt delight on the beautiful print that she had brought him, from Ary Scheffer’s picture of the Great Consoler.",accomplish consult father scruple set mind rest know outlay mere trifle pleased touch affection show smile doubt dwele heartfelt delight beautiful print bring picture great 
67,"Flora was in her glory. To be able to bestow benefits on those whom she loved, had been always a favourite vision, and she had the full pleasure of feeling how much enjoyment she was causing. They had a very pleasant evening; she gave interesting accounts of their tour, and by her appeals to her husband, made him talk also. He was much more animated and agreeable than Ethel had ever seen him, and was actually laughing, and making Mary laugh heartily with his histories of the inns in the Pyrennees. Old Mr. Rivers looked as proud and happy as possible, and was quite young and gay, having evidently forgotten all his maladies, in paying elaborate attention to his daughter-in-law.",glory able bestow benefit love favourite vision have full pleasure feel much enjoyment cause have pleasant evening give interesting account tour appeal husband make talk animated agreeable see laugh make laugh history inn old look proud happy possible young gay forget malady pay elaborate attention daughter law

69,"The morning spent at home was equally charming. Flora came back, with love strengthened by absence. She was devoted to Margaret--caressing to all; she sat in her old places; she fulfilled her former offices; she gratified Miss Bracy by visiting her in the schoolroom, and talking of French books; and won golden opinions, by taking Gertrude in her hand, and walking to Minster Street to call on Mrs. Hoxton, as in old times, and take her the newest foreign device of working to kill time.",morning spend home charming come love strengthen absence devote caress sit old place fulfil former office gratified visit schoolroom talk french book win golden opinion take hand walk call old time take new foreign device work kill time 
70,"So a few days passed merrily away, and the great journey commenced. Ethel met the Abbotstoke party at the station, and, with a parting injunction to her father, that he was to give all his patients a sleeping potion, that they might not miss him, she was carried away from Stoneborough.",few day pass great journey commence meet station part injunction father give patient sleeping potion miss carry 
71,"Meta was in her gayest mood; Ethel full of glee and wonder, for once beyond Whitford, the whole world was new to her; Flora more quiet, but greatly enjoying their delight, and George not saying much, but smiling under his beard, as if well pleased to be so well amused with so little trouble.",gayest mood full glee wonder whole world new quiet enjoy delight say much smile beard pleased amuse little trouble 
72,"He took exceeding care of them, and fed them with everything he could make them eat at the Swindon Station, asking for impossible things, and wishing them so often to change for something better, that, if they had been submissive, they would have had no luncheon at all; and, as it was, Flora was obliged to whisk into the carriage with her last sandwich in her hand.",take exceed care feed make eat ask impossible thing wish change good submissive have luncheon oblige whisk carriage last sandwich hand

80,"“This man might be called the Master of Glenbracken at home,” said Ethel. “It is such a pretty title, and there is a beautiful history belonging to them. There was a Master of Glenbracken who carried James IV.’s standard at Flodden, and would not yield, and was killed with it wrapped round his body, and the Lion was dyed with his blood. Mamma knew some scraps of a ballad about him. Then they were out with Montrose, and had their castle burned by the Covenanters, and since that they have been Jacobites, and one barely escaped being beheaded at Carlisle!

This is the only son, and very good and clever--he preferred going to Balliol, that he might work; but he is a great sportsman, George,” added she; “you will get on with him very well, about fishing, and grouse shooting, I dare say.”",say come time present young heir seem worthy race pattern person build church have tenantry excellent order only son good clever prefer go work great sportsman add get fishing grouse shooting say 
82,"Norman met them at the station, and there was great excitement at seeing his long nose under his college cap. He looked rather thin and worn, but brightened at the sight of the party. After the question--whether there had been any letters from Harry? he asked whether his father were coming?--and Ethel thought he seemed nervous at the idea of this addition to his audience. He saw them to their hotel, and, promising them his two guests, departed.",meet station be great excitement see long nose college cap look thin wear brighten sight party question be letter ask father come think seem nervous idea addition audience see hotel promise guest depart 
83,"Ethel watched collegiate figures passing in the street, and recollected the gray buildings, just glimpsed at in her drive--it was dreamy and confused, and she stood musing, not discovering that it was time to dress, till Flora and her Frenchwoman came in, and laid violent hands on her.",watch collegiate figure pass street recollect gray building glimpse drive dreamy confused stand muse discover time dress come lay violent hand 
84,"The effect of their manipulations was very successful. Ethel was made to look well-dressed, and, still more, distinguished. Her height told well, when her lankiness was overcome, and her hair was disposed so as to set off her features to advantage. The glow of amusement and pleasure did still more for her; and Norman, who was in the parlour when the sisters appeared, quite started with surprise and satisfaction at her aspect.",effect manipulation successful make look dress more distinguished height tell lankiness overcome hair dispose set feature advantage glow amusement pleasure more parlour sister appear start surprise satisfaction aspect

86,"“Then, I hope we have been preparing an agreeable surprise for him,”  said Flora. “Ethel is very much obliged to you. By the bye,” she said, in her universal amity, “I must ask Harvey Anderson to dinner one of these days?” Norman started, and his face said “Don’t.”",hope prepare agreeable surprise say oblige bye say universal amity ask dinner day start face say

89,“Has he been doing anything wrong?” reiterated Flora.,do wrong reiterate 
90,"“Not that I know of,” was the blunt answer; and, at the same instant, Mr. Ogilvie arrived. He was a pleasant, high-bred looking gentleman, brown-complexioned, and dark-eyed, with a brisk and resolute cast of countenance, that, Ethel thought, might have suited the Norman of Glenbracken, who died on the ruddy Lion of Scotland, and speaking with the very same slight degree of Scottish intonation as she remembered in her mother, making a most home-like sound in her ears.",know blunt answer same instant arrive pleasant high breed look gentleman brown complexion dark eyed brisk resolute cast countenance think suit die ruddy speak same slight degree scottish intonation remember mother make home like sound ear

93,"The dinner went off well--there were few enough for the conversation to be general. The young men began to strike out sparks of wit against each other--Flora put in a word or two--Ethel grew so much interested in the discussion, that her face lighted up, and she joined in it, as if it had been only between her father and brother--keen, clear, and droll. After that, she had her full share in the conversation, and enjoyed it so much that, when she left the dinner-table, she fetched her writing-case to sketch the colloquy for Margaret and her father.",dinner go be few enough conversation general young man begin strike spark wit other put word grow interested discussion face light join father brother keen clear droll have full share conversation enjoy leave dinner table fetched writing case sketch colloquy father 
94,"Flora exclaimed at her for never allowing any one to think of rest. Meta said she should like to do the same, but it was impossible now; she did not know how she should ever settle down to write a letter. Ethel was soon interrupted--the gentlemen entered, and Mr. Ogilvie came to the window, where she was sitting, and began to tell her how much obliged to her he and his college were, for having insisted on her brother’s sending in his poem. “Thanks are due, for our being spared an infliction next week,” he said.",exclaim allow one think rest say like do same impossible know settle write letter interrupt gentleman enter come window sit begin tell much oblige college insist brother send poem thanks due spare infliction next week say
