2,"When breakfast was over the next morning, Ready observed, ""Now, Mr Seagrave, we must hold a council of war, and decide upon an exploring party for to-morrow; and, when we have settled that, we will find some useful way of employing ourselves for the rest of the day.  The first question is, of whom is the party to consist?--and upon that I wish to hear your opinion.""",breakfast next morning ready observe hold council war decide explore party settle find useful way employ rest day first question party consist wish hear opinion

5,"""I certainly should have liked to have Mr Seagrave to advise with, ma'am,"" replied Ready; ""but still I have thought upon it, and do not think that William would be quite sufficient protection for you; or, at all events, you would not feel that he was, which is much the same thing; and so, if Mr Seagrave has no objection, it would perhaps be better that he remained with you.""",like have advise reply ready think think sufficient protection event feel same thing have objection good remain 
6,"""Would you go alone, then, Ready?"" said Mr Seagrave.",go ready say 
7,"""No, sir, I do not think that would be right either,--some accident might happen; there is no saying what might happen, although there is every appearance of safety.  I should like, therefore, to have some one with me; the question is, whether it be William or Juno?""",sir think right accident happen be saying happen be appearance safety like have one question 
8,"""Take me,"" said Tommy.",take say 
9,"""Take you, Tommy!"" said Ready, laughing; ""then I must take Juno to take care of you.  No; I think they cannot spare you.

And now, will you not put trust in that Providence, when the dangers are, as I trust, only imaginary?""",dear wife say recollect preserve such awful danger land safety put trust danger trust imaginary 
14,"""I was wrong, my dear husband; but sickness and suffering have made me, I fear, not only nervous and frightened, but selfish: I must and will shake it off.  Hitherto I have only been a clog and an incumbrance to you; but I trust I shall soon behave better, and make myself useful.  If you think, then, that it would be better that you should go instead of William, I am quite content.  Go, then, with Ready, and may Heaven protect you both!""",wrong dear husband sickness suffering make fear nervous frighten selfish shake clog incumbrance trust behave good make useful think good go content go ready heaven protect 
15,"""No, ma'am,"" replied Ready, ""William will do just as well.  Indeed, I would go by myself with pleasure; but we know not what the day may bring forth.  I might be taken ill--I might hurt myself--I am an old man, you know; and then I was thinking that if any accident was to happen to me, you might miss me--that's all.""",reply ready do go pleasure know day bring take ill hurt old man know think accident happen miss

We must take some provisions and water with us, a gun and some ammunition, a large axe for me, and one of the hatchets for William; and, if you please, Romulus and Remus had better come with us.  Juno, put a piece of beef and a piece of pork into the pot.  William, will you fill four quart bottles with water, while I sew up a knapsack out of canvas for each of us?""",next prepare journey take provision water gun ammunition large axe hatchet come put piece beef piece pork pot fill quart bottle water sew knapsack canvas

22,"Tommy jumped up directly; he was quite strong enough to turn the grindstone, but he was much fonder of play than work; but as Ready had said that he was fond of it, he wished to prove that such was the case, and worked very hard.
