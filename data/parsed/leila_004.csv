2," Matilda’s idea, that their having a governess was a point determined on, proved more correct than her hasty conclusions generally did. Mr. Howard had been for some time aware that the mode of life which he must pursue in England would prevent him giving that undivided attention to Leila which his island home had afforded him, and which every day was becoming more necessary in the formation of her inquiring mind and impetuous character. He felt that Nurse, with all her fond affection, in her attempts to rule, was only fostering in his child a spirit of opposition and self-will; and that Leila was beginning to think in many things she knew better than Nurse, and that she did right to reject counsel, which, though always well intended, was often not judiciously given. Though resolved not to yield to the feeling, he had been too long accustomed to the exclusive society of his child, not to be aware that there would be many occasions in which the presence of a third person would prove irksome to him, and it was therefore with real gratitude that he listened to Mrs. Stanley’s proposal, that the intended governess should reside under their roof, yet still have the joint charge of the cousins. “The distance was so short,” she observed, “not two miles, it would only be healthful exercise for Leila to walk when the day was fine, and in bad weather she could easily be sent to them in the carriage. She should take care that Leila was always at home to dine with her papa when he was alone, and to read and sing to him in the evenings, as she had been accustomed to do.”",idea have governess point determine prove correct hasty conclusion time aware mode life pursue prevent give undivided attention island home afford day become necessary formation inquire mind impetuous character feel fond affection attempt rule foster child spirit opposition self will begin think many thing know good do right reject counsel intend give resolve yield feeling long accustom exclusive society child aware be many occasion presence third person prove irksome real gratitude listen proposal intend governess reside roof have joint charge cousin distance short observe mile healthful exercise walk day fine bad weather send carriage take care home dine papa alone read sing evening accustom do 
3,"When Mr. Howard sent for Leila next day to communicate this intelligence, she entered his room with an unusually grave expression; the dreaded idea of a governess had been haunting her imagination the whole morning, and gaining strength every minute. She advanced slowly, and taking her papa’s hand in hers, she looked up anxiously into his eyes:--“Is it a governess, papa?” she said, “is it? Oh, tell me quick.”",send next day communicate intelligence enter room grave expression dread idea governess haunting imagination whole morning gain strength minute advance take papa hand look eye governess papa say tell 
4,"“My dear child,” Mr. Howard answered, as he stooped down and kissed her forehead, “my dear, dear child, what is all this? Why do you look at me in this piteous manner? Indeed you must not agitate yourself in this way; you must not let your imagination get the better of you; it certainly was on this subject I wished to talk to you; but is the idea of a governess so very frightful to you?”",dear child answer stoop kiss forehead dear dear child look piteous manner agitate way let imagination get good subject wish talk idea governess frightful 
5,"“No, papa; perhaps she is not frightful, but you know I never saw one; perhaps she is like other ladies, but then you know she will be always there, always sticking to me; Matilda said something which made me know that; always _sticking_, papa; and then I shall never be alone with you. No more nice chats with your little friend.” Her voice failed, she could not continue.",papa frightful know see other lady know stick say make know _sticking_ papa alone nice chat little friend voice fail continue 
6,"Mr. Howard looked at her anxiously; “Leila, my dear child, you distress me; if you allow yourself to get into this way of anticipating imaginary evils, you will enervate your mind, and unfit yourself to bear as you ought to do the real trials of life; remember who says, ‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.’ Now listen to me; I can see that Matilda has made you aware that you are to have a governess, and all the morning you have probably been working yourself up with the idea of suffering from what I trust may prove the greatest blessing to you. I cannot now devote my mornings to you as I did in the island; I must frequently be absent, and you are now of an age to require superior instruction to that of your faithful and affectionate nurse; but you will still be my little friend; in the evenings you will sing and read to me as you used to do, and we shall always dine together.”",look dear child distress allow get way anticipate imaginary evil enervate mind unfit bear do real trial life remember say sufficient day evil listen see make aware have governess morning work idea suffer trust prove great blessing devote morning do island absent age require superior instruction faithful affectionate nurse little friend evening sing read use do dine 
7,"Leila’s face brightened. “O, what a comfort!” she exclaimed: then added, “but I don’t know that I shall be quite comfortable. My governess won’t like dining by herself; she will be melancholy.”",face brighten comfort exclaim add know comfortable governess like dining melancholy 
8,"“Now, dear child, you are again running on before the point, though I am glad that now it is that you are anxious for your governess’ comfort: but she is not to be exclusively your governess, Leila, and she is not to reside at Woodlands. Your aunt has most kindly proposed that you should spend the mornings with your cousins, and be educated with them. We are to breakfast together early as we used to do; when fine, you are to walk there immediately after breakfast, or be sent in the carriage when the weather is bad; and by five o’clock you are to be home to dine with your papa. I give you a general invitation to dinner, Miss Leila Howard, and pray give me a favourable answer.”",dear child run point glad anxious governess comfort governess reside aunt propose spend morning cousin educate breakfast use do fine walk breakfast send carriage weather bad o'clock dine papa give general invitation dinner pray give favourable answer 
9,"“Papa, papa, how delightful you are to me,” Leila exclaimed; “all my fears, all my sorrows; where are they? You are like the sun to me, papa; the sun chasing away the clouds, and now there is nothing but the blue sky and my beautiful governess.”",delightful exclaim fear sorrow sun papa sun chase cloud be blue sky beautiful governess 
10,Mr. Howard smiled; “And who told you she was to be beautiful?” he inquired.,smile tell beautiful inquire 
11,"“Nobody, papa; but I think she will be, and I am sure I shall like her so much.”",papa think sure like 
12,"“I hope indeed that you will like her, my love; for if your aunt succeeds in the application she is about to make, your governess is likely to prove a very estimable person; but I don’t suppose she ever was beautiful, and she can’t be very young now.”",hope like love aunt succeed application about make governess likely prove estimable person suppose beautiful young 
13,"Leila’s countenance fell. “As old as the hills, I reckon,” she ejaculated, in a very low voice.",countenance fall old hill reckon ejaculate low voice 
14,"But her papa caught the words: “‘As old as the hills, I _reckon_,’” he repeated; “Leila, from whom have you caught up that phrase?”",papa catch word old hill repeat catch phrase 
15,"“From Peggy Dobie,” she replied.",reply 
16,"“From Peggy Dobie; but, my love, have I not told you that I do not wish you to acquire Peggy Dobie’s mode of expressing yourself? I shall regret my promise of allowing Peggy to remove to Woodlands, if you are to adopt her phrases, and try to imitate her mode of speaking.”",love tell wish acquire mode express regret promise allow remove adopt phrase try imitate mode speak 
17,"“But, papa, I promise you I will not, and I dare say our governess would not like me to speak in that way either. I hope she will come to us very soon; how soon do you think, papa? in a few days?--our governess, I mean. I know Peggy Dobie cannot be here so soon, or my pets either: how delightful it will be when they all arrive, what a world of happiness it will be then!”",promise say governess like speak way hope come think few day governess mean know pet delightful arrive world happiness 
18,"“My dear Leila, I have already told you that I hope this lady, if we succeed in engaging her, may prove a real blessing and advantage to you; but you must not allow your imagination to run away with you in this way, or suppose that you are immediately to find her in every way delightful; she is a person who has experienced severe trials; her husband lost a large fortune by the failure of a bank with which he was connected; he died soon after, leaving her and one little girl totally unprovided for. Her sister has taken this little girl to be educated with her own children, and Mrs. Roberts has for some time past been looking out for a situation as governess. Your aunt has a high idea of her principles, and was much struck by the truly Christian way in which she has borne up under her misfortunes; and having resided several years abroad, she speaks both French and Italian with facility, and is besides an excellent musician. All this makes her a most desirable person, but the sorrows she has gone through may probably make her graver than you may at first think agreeable; and you must remember, besides, that a governess has an arduous task to perform, and many difficulties to combat.”",dear tell hope lady succeed engage prove real blessing advantage allow imagination run way suppose find way delightful person experience severe trial husband lose large fortune failure bank connect die leave little girl unprovide sister take little girl educate own child time look situation governess aunt have high idea principle strike christian way borne misfortune reside several year speak french facility excellent musician make desirable person sorrow go make graver think agreeable remember governess have arduous task perform many difficulty combat

21,Leila repeated the word _correct_.,repeat word _correct 
22,"“Yes, my love,” Mr. Howard continued, “Mrs. Roberts would be unworthy of our confidence, and neglectful of her duty, if she did not correct your faults.”",love continue unworthy confidence neglectful duty correct fault 
23,"“But, papa, she would only have two to correct: Selina is quite perfect; don’t you think so, papa?”",have correct perfect think papa 
24,"“No, my love; I know no one in this world who is perfect, and Selina, though several years older than you are, is still very young, and requires much care and instruction to form her character; but she has fewer faults than any other little girl I know--she is indeed singularly admirable; Mrs. Roberts, I have no doubt, will think herself very fortunate to have such a pupil.”",love know world perfect several year old young require much care instruction form character have few fault other little girl know admirable have doubt think fortunate have pupil 
25,"“And what will she think about me, papa?” she anxiously inquired.",think papa inquire 
26,"“Why, she will probably think that she has got rather an impetuous little woman to manage, one who often allows her imagination to get the better of her.” But seeing Leila’s downcast face, he added,--“yet I feel sure also that she will not be long of loving my little girl, though she is not _perfect_; and now Leila,” he continued, “have you any idea of what is to be done to-day?”",think get impetuous little woman manage allow imagination get good see downcast face add feel sure long love little girl _perfect_ continue have idea do day 
27,"“No, papa, I have no idea. Are we to begin our lessons again? Oh, no! I see you have a plan--I see it in your face. Do tell me: I am sure you have something pleasant to tell.”",papa have idea begin lesson see have plan see face tell sure have pleasant tell 
28,"“Yes,” Mr. Howard answered, “I think you will like the arrangement for this forenoon. I have just been proposing to your aunt that we should visit Woodlands, that you should see your future home, my child; and we have settled that you young folks are to walk there with Nurse and Amy, and I have ordered the open carriage to drive your uncle and aunt; we shall probably be there first to receive you.”",answer think like arrangement forenoon propose aunt visit see future home child settle young folk walk order open carriage drive uncle aunt first receive
