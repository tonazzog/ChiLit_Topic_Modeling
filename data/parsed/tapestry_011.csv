3," ""Little Charlotte climbed over the railings,"" continued Dudu, ""but she did not jump down on the other side, for Mademoiselle Eliane, who was tall, found that by standing half-way up the bank she could reach the child and hand her down to Mademoiselle Jeanne, a little way below. There was a good deal of laughing over it all, and this helped them to make friends more quickly than anything else would have done. But indeed Charlotte was not a shy child, she had travelled too much and seen too many people to be so, and our young ladies, besides, were so kind and merry that no little girl could long have been strange with them. She ran about the garden in the greatest delight; her new friends showed her all their favourite nooks, and allowed her to make a bouquet of the flowers she liked best; and when they were tired of standing about they all sat down together on a bank, and Charlotte told to the young ladies the story of her short life. It was a sad little story; her father had died when she was very young, and her mother, whose health had never been good after the shock of his death, had gone to Italy with the aunt who had brought her up, in hopes of growing stronger. But through two or three years of sometimes seeming better and sometimes worse, she had really been steadily failing, and at last she died, leaving her poor little girl almost alone, 'for the old aunt was now,' said Charlotte, 'always ill, and not ill as mamma used to be,' she added, for however tired _she_ was, she always liked her little girl to be beside her, and never wearied of listening to all she had to say.",little climb railing continue jump other side tall find stand half way bank reach child hand little way be good deal laugh help make friend else do shy child travel much see many person young lady kind merry little girl strange run garden great delight new friend show favourite nook allow make bouquet flower like good tired stand sit bank tell young lady story short life sad little story father die young mother health good shock death go aunt bring hope grow strong year seem good bad fail last die leave poor little girl alone old aunt say ill ill mamma use add tired _she_ like little girl weary listen have say 
4,"""'But now,' said the child, 'I am always alone, and it is _so_ sad. And I have watched you so often from the balcony, and wished I might come down to you. And now, if you will let me come to see you every day, I shall be _so_ happy.'",say child alone sad watch balcony wish come let come see day happy 
5,"""She was a dear little girl, so sweet, and simple, and loving. She quite gained our young ladies' hearts with her pretty ways and her funny little English, accent. They kissed her on both cheeks, and told her they would be very pleased for her to come to them in the garden whenever she saw them from the balcony, as she was so sure her aunt would not object to it. They could not invite her to the house, they explained, unless their mother and her aunt had made acquaintance. Of course it would not have done, as little Charlotte quite understood; for in those days,"" Dudu observed in passing, ""politeness and ceremony were much more observed than is at present, I am sorry to say, the case.",dear little girl sweet simple loving gain young lady heart pretty way funny little english accent kiss cheek tell pleased come garden see balcony sure aunt object invite house explain mother aunt make acquaintance course do little understand day observe passing politeness ceremony observe present sorry say case 
6,"""The little English girl, however,"" he went on, ""was only too delighted to have received permission to visit them in their garden. And not many days passed on which she did not join them there. It was a lovely summer that year--I remember it so well. Never now does the sun seem to me to shine quite so brightly as in those days. Perhaps it is that I am growing old, perhaps the sad days that soon after followed left a cloud on my memory and a mist on my spirit which have never since entirely cleared away; however that may be, I never remember so bright and beautiful a summer as the one I am telling you of. And little Charlotte's merry laugh was often heard on the terrace walk, as she ran races with Mademoiselle Eliane's dog, or made daisy wreaths for Mademoiselle Jeanne's dark hair. Kindness and companionship were all she required to make her a bright and happy child. But the pleasant summer faded, and with the first autumn days came a fresh sorrow for the little girl. One morning, before the usual time for meeting in the garden, I caught sight of her on the balcony, her face looking again like the little pale Charlotte I had first known her, her eyes red with weeping. And as by good chance the young ladies came out soon the reason was soon explained.",little english girl go delighted receive permission visit garden many day pass join lovely summer year remember sun seem shine day grow old sad day follow leave cloud memory mist spirit clear remember bright beautiful summer one tell little merry laugh hear terrace walk run race dog make daisy wreath dark hair kindness companionship require make bright happy child pleasant summer fade first autumn day come fresh sorrow little girl morning usual time meeting garden catch sight balcony face look little pale know eye red weeping good chance young lady come reason explain 
7,"""'I am going away, my dear young ladies,' cried Charlotte, as she threw herself into their arms. 'My aunt has just told me. We return to England in a few days. To England, where I have no friends, where I shall be again all alone. O Mademoiselle Eliane! O Mademoiselle Jeanne! what shall I do without you, and your pretty garden, and your kindness, and poor old Dudu, and the flowers, and everything?'",go dear young lady cry throw arm aunt tell return few day have friend alone do pretty garden kindness poor old flower

But the tears came to their own eyes when they saw how real and acute was the little girl's grief.",console kind young lady heart full sympathy tear come own eye see real acute little girl grief 
9,"""'You will come back to see us again, little Charlotte, perhaps,' they said. 'Your aunt has travelled so much, very likely she will not wish to remain always in England. And you would always find us here--in the winter at any rate; generally in the summer we spend some months at our château, though this summer our father had business which obliged him to stay here. But for that we should not have seen you so much.'",come see little say aunt travel much likely wish remain find winter rate summer spend month château summer father have business oblige stay see 
10,"""But Charlotte was not to be consoled. Her aunt, she was sure, would never travel any more. She had said only that very morning, that once she got back to England she would stay there for the rest of her life, she was too old to move about any more.",console aunt sure travel more say very morning get stay rest life old move more 
11,"""'And I,' added Charlotte, with a fresh burst of weeping, 'I am to be sent to an English school as soon as aunt can settle about it.'",add fresh burst weeping send english school aunt settle 
12,"""'But you will be happier at school, dear,' said Mademoiselle Eliane. 'You will have friends of your own age.'",happy school dear say have friend own age 
13,"""'I don't want friends of my own age. I shall never love _any_ friends as much as my dear Mademoiselle Jeanne and my dear Mademoiselle Eliane,' sobbed Charlotte; and the only thing that consoled her at all was when the two young ladies found for her among their little treasures a very prettily painted 'bonbonnière,' and a quaint little workcase, fitted with thimble, scissors, and all such things, which she promised them she would always keep, _always_, as souvenirs of their kindness.",want friend own age love friend much dear dear sobb only thing console young lady find little treasure paint bonbonnière quaint little workcase fit thimble scissors such thing promise keep souvenir kindness 
14,"""And in return, the poor little thing went out with her aunt's maid the next morning and bought two little keepsakes--a scent-bottle for Mademoiselle Jeanne, and a fan for Mademoiselle Eliane. She spent on them all the money she had; and at this very moment,"" added Dudu, ""the scent-bottle is downstairs in your mother's large old dressing-case, the dressing-case she got from her grandfather. What became of the fan I cannot say.",return poor little thing go aunt maid next morning buy little keepsake scent bottle fan spend money have very moment add scent bottle mother large old dress case dress case get grandfather become fan say 
15,"""Well, the few remaining days passed, and one cold, dreary morning poor Charlotte clambered over the railings for the last time, to embrace her friends and bid them farewell. She might have come in by the door and seen them in the salon; of course neither her aunt nor our young ladies' mother would have objected to such a thing, as she was going away, even though no visits of ceremony had been exchanged between the families. But this would not have suited Charlotte; it was in the garden she had first seen her friends, and in the garden must she bid them good-bye. I assisted at the interview,"" continued Dudu, ""and very touching it was. Had I been of a nature to shed tears, I really think my feelings would have been too much for me. And Charlotte would have kissed and hugged me too, no doubt, had I encouraged anything of the kind. But, fortunately perhaps for the preservation of my feathers and my dignity, I am not, and never have been, of a demonstrative disposition.""",few remain day pass cold dreary morning poor clamber railing last time embrace friend bid farewell come door see salon course aunt young lady mother object thing go visit ceremony exchange family suit garden see friend garden bid good bye assist interview continue touch nature shed tear think feeling much kiss hugge doubt encourage kind preservation feather dignity demonstrative disposition 
16,Dudu cleared his throat and stopped to rest for a moment. Then he continued--,clear throat stop rest moment continue 
17,"""The parting was over at last, and little Charlotte was away--quite away over the sea in cold, rainy England. Cold and rainy it must have been that winter in any case, for it was cold and rainy even here, and many changes happened, and shadows of strange events were already faintly darkening the future. It was the next year that our pretty Mademoiselle Jeanne married and went away with her husband from the old house, which yet was to be her home, and the home of her children in the end, for Mademoiselle Eliane never married, and so all came to be inherited by her sister's sons. But with that we have nothing to do at present. I wished only to tell you what concerns our young ladies' friendship with the little stranger. Years went on, as they always do, whether they leave the world happy or miserable, and the shadows I have told you of grew darker and darker. Then, at last, the terrible days began--the storm burst forth, our happy, peaceful home, with hundreds and thousands of others, was broken up, and its kindly inhabitants forced to flee. Mademoiselle Jeanne came hurrying up from her husband's home, where things were even worse than with us, with her boys, to seek for shelter and safety, which, alas! could not be given her here. For all had to flee--my poor old master, frail as he was, his delicate wife, our young ladies, and the boys--all fled together, and after facing perils such as I trust none of their descendants will ever know, they reached a safe refuge. And then they had to endure a new misery, for months and months went by before they had any tidings of poor Mademoiselle Jeanne's husband, your great-grandfather, my children, who, like all of his name--a name you may well be proud of, my little Mademoiselle Jeanne--stayed at the post of danger till every hope was passed. Then at last, in disguise, he managed to escape, and reached this place in safety, hoping here to find something to guide him as to where his wife and children were. But he found nothing--the house was deserted, not a servant or retainer of any kind left except myself, and what, alas! could _I_ do? He was worn out and exhausted, poor man; he hid in the house for a few days, creeping out at dusk in fear and trembling to buy a loaf of bread, trusting to his disguise and to his not being well known in the town. But he would have died, I believe, had he been long left as he was, for distress of mind added to his other miseries, not knowing anything as to what had become of your great-grandmother and his children.",parting last little sea cold rainy cold rainy winter case cold rainy many change happen shadow strange event darken future next year pretty marry go husband old house home home child end marry come inherit sister son have do present wish tell concern young lady friendship little stranger year go do leave world happy miserable shadow tell grow dark dark last terrible day begin storm burst happy peaceful home hundred thousand other break kindly inhabitant force flee come hurry husband home thing bad boy seek shelter safety give have flee poor old master frail delicate wife young lady boy flead face peril such trust descendant know reach safe refuge have endure new misery month month go have tiding poor husband great grandfather child name name proud little stay post danger hope pass last disguise manage escape reach place safety hope find guide wife child find house desert servant retainer kind leave do wear exhaust poor man hide house few day creep dusk fear tremble buy loaf bread trust disguise know town die believe long leave distress mind add other misery know become great grandmother child 
18,"""She was a good wife,"" continued Dudu, after another little pause. ""Our Mademoiselle Jeanne, I mean. Just when her poor husband was losing heart altogether, beginning to think they must all be dead, that there was nothing left for him to do but to die too, she came to him. She had travelled alone, quite alone, our delicate young lady--who in former days had scarcely been allowed to set her little foot on the pavement--from Switzerland to the old home, with a strange belief that here if anywhere she should find him. And she was rewarded. The worst of the terrible days were now past, but still disguise was necessary, and it was in the dress of one of her own peasants--the dress in which she had fled--that Mademoiselle Jeanne returned. But he knew her--through all disguises he would have known her--and she him. And the first evening they were together in the bare, deserted house, even with all the terrors behind them, the perils before them, the husband and wife were happy.""",good wife continue little pause mean poor husband lose heart begin think dead be leave do die come travel alone alone delicate young lady former day allow set little foot pavement old home strange belief find reward bad terrible day past disguise necessary dress own peasant dress flead return know disguise know first evening bare desert house terror peril husband wife happy 
19,"Dudu paused again. The children, too interested to speak, listened eagerly.",pause child interested speak listen 
20,"""Go on, dear Dudu,"" whispered Jeanne at last, softly.",go dear whisper last 
21,"""How were they to get away to safety? That was the question,"" continued Dudu. ""They dared not stay long where they were; yet they dared not go. Monsieur was far too feeble to stand much fatigue, and the two of them journeying together might attract notice.",get safety question continue stay go feeble stand much fatigue journey attract notice 
22,"""'If we could get to the sea,' said Mademoiselle Jeanne--Madame I should call her, but it never comes naturally--there we might find a ship to take us to England or Holland, and thence find our way to our dear ones again.'",get sea say call come find ship take find way dear one 
23,"""But Monsieur shook his head. 'Impossible,' he said. 'I have not the strength for even the four leagues' walk to the sea, and finding a ship that would take us is a mere chance. We have almost no money. Here at least we have shelter, and still some sous for bread. Jeanne, my beloved, you must make up your mind to leave me again--alone and unhindered you might find your way back in safety.'",shake head impossible say have strength league walk sea find ship take mere chance have money least have shelter sous bread beloved make mind leave alone unhindered find way safety 
24,"""'I will never leave you,' said Jeanne. 'We will die together, if it must be so. The boys are safe--my father and mother and Eliane will care for them. I will never leave you.'",leave say die boy safe father mother care leave 
25,"""And Monsieur said no more; but in his own mind I could see that he thought himself fast dying, that want of comforts and nourishment much longer would exhaust his little strength, and that his poor Jeanne would, in the end, be forced to attempt the journey back alone. They were sitting at the end of the terrace walk that evening--the end near little Charlotte's balcony; it was a mild, still evening--it seemed less dreary and miserable than in the house; from the distance came the sound of the children playing in the old streets, and near at hand some birds were singing still--for children will play and birds will sing whatever happens. Suddenly a sound close at hand made Mademoiselle Jeanne look up. And I too, for I was close beside them on the terrace, I looked up in amazement, half imagining it must be a dream. For we heard--both Mademoiselle Jeanne and I knew it again--the sound of the window on to the balcony opening, the window through which the little English girl used to come out to meet her friends. We looked and could scarcely believe our eyes. Out on to the balcony stepped a young lady, a young girl rather she seemed, for she was tall and slight and had fair curls about her sweet fresh face. She stood for one instant looking at us all as if bewildered, then, with a sudden cry, almost before we knew what she was doing, she was over the railings and down the bank.",say more own mind see think die want comfort nourishment exhaust little strength poor end force attempt journey sit end terrace walk evening end little balcony mild evening seem dreary miserable house distance come sound child play old street hand bird sing child play bird sing happen sound close hand make look close terrace look amazement half imagin dream hear know sound window balcony opening window little english girl use come meet friend look believe eye balcony step young lady young girl seem tall slight have fair curl sweet fresh face stand instant look bewilder sudden cry know do railing bank

28,"""'You know me?' she cried--'your little English Charlotte. See, here is the bonbonnière,' feeling for it in her pocket as she spoke. 'And you are Mademoiselle Jeanne. I know you now--if you had twenty peasant caps on I should know you. But how thin and pale you are, my poor Jeanne! And is this your husband? I knew you were married. I saw it in the newspapers ever so many years ago. Do you know it is fifteen years since I went away? And I am married, too. But tell me first how it is you are here and dressed like that, and why you look so sad and Monsieur so ill. Tell me all. You may trust me, you may indeed, and perhaps my husband and I may be able to be of some use. You may trust me,' seeing that Madame and her husband looked at each other in bewilderment; 'may they not, Dudu?' she added, turning to me.

31,"""'It is not that we do not trust you, my dear friend,' said Madame; 'and indeed you see all in seeing us here as you do. There is nothing to tell but the same sad story that has been to tell in so many once happy French homes. But explain to me, my dear Charlotte, how you are here. It is so strange, so extraordinary.'",trust dear friend say see see do be tell same sad story tell many happy french home explain dear strange extraordinary 
32,"""And Charlotte explained. Her husband was a sailor. To be near him, she had been in Spain at the outbreak of the revolution, and had remained there till he was ordered home. Now that the terror was subsiding, there was--for them, as foreigners--but little risk. She had persuaded her husband, whose vessel, owing to some slight accident at sea, had been obliged to put in at the neighbouring port, to let her come to have a look at the old town, at the old house, or garden rather, she still loved so dearly. 'The house we used to live in,' she said, 'was empty. I easily found my way in, and out on to the balcony, as you saw. I had a sort of wild idea that perhaps I might see or hear something of you. Yet I was almost afraid to ask, such terrible things have happened,' added Charlotte, with a shudder.",explain husband sailor outbreak revolution remain order terror subside be foreigner little risk persuade husband vessel ow slight accident sea oblige put neighbour port let come have look old town old house garden love house use live say empty find way balcony see have sort wild idea see hear afraid ask such terrible thing happen add shudder 
33,"""But nothing more terrible was in store for our young ladies, I am glad to say,"" continued Dudu. ""The faithful-hearted Charlotte and her husband were able to be of the greatest service to Mademoiselle Jeanne and _her_ husband. They conveyed them in safety to the port and saw them on board a friendly vessel, and not many weeks passed before they were again with their children and the old Monsieur and Madame and Mademoiselle Eliane in their home for the time in Switzerland.""",terrible store young lady glad say continue faithful hearted husband able great service husband convey safety port see board friendly vessel many week pass child old home time

37,"""Your great-grandfather, you mean,"" corrected Dudu.",great grandfather mean correct 
38,"""Oh, well then, my great-grandfather, _our_ great-grandfather, for he was Chéri's, too, you said. I do so hope he got better. Did he, Dudu?""",great grandfather great grandfather say hope get good 
39,"""Yes,"" said Dudu, ""he got better, but never quite well again. However, he lived some years, long enough to see his boys grown up and to return--after the death of our old Monsieur and Madame--to return to his own country with his wife and sister-in-law. But before very long, while still far from an old man, he died. Then our young ladies, young no longer, came back, after a time, to their childish home; and here they lived together quietly, kind and charitable to all, cheered from time to time by the visits of Madame's two sons, out in the world now and married, and with homes of their own. And time went on gently and uneventfully, and gradually Madame's hair became quite, quite white, and Mademoiselle Eliane took to limping a little in her walk with the rheumatism, and when they slowly paced up and down the terrace it was difficult for me to think they were really my pretty young ladies with the white dresses and blue ribbons of half a century ago. For it was now just thirty-five years since the last visit of their English friend. She too, if she were alive, must be a woman of more than sixty. They had never heard of her again. In the hurry and anxiety of their last meeting they had forgotten to ask and she to give her exact address, so they could not write. She might have written to them to the old house perhaps, on the chance of it finding them; but if so, they had never got the letter. Yet they often spoke of her, and never saw the balcony at the end of the terrace without a kindly thought of those long ago days.",say get good live year see boy grow return death old return own country wife sister law old man die young lady young come time childish home live kind charitable cheer time time visit son world marry home own time go hair become white take limp little walk rheumatism pace terrace difficult think pretty young lady white dress blue ribbon century year last visit english friend alive woman more hear hurry anxiety last meeting forget ask give exact address write write old house chance find get letter speak see balcony end terrace kindly thought long ago day 
40,"""One evening--an autumn evening--mild and balmy, the two old ladies were slowly pacing up and down their favourite walk, when a servant came out to say that they were wanted--a lady was asking for them. But not to disturb them, he added, the visitor would be glad to see them in the garden, if they would allow it. Wondering who it could be, Madame and her sister were hesitating what to do, when a figure was seen approaching them from the house.",evening autumn evening mild balmy old lady pace favourite walk servant come say want lady ask disturb add visitor glad see garden allow wonder sister hesitate do figure see approach house 
41,"""'I could not wait,' she said, almost before she reached them. 'I wished so much to see you once more in the old spot, dear friends;' and they knew her at once. They recognised in the bowed and worn but still sweet and lovely woman, their pretty child-friend of fifty years ago. She had come to bid them farewell, she said. She was on her way to the south--not to live but to die, for she had suffered much and her days were numbered.",wait say reach wish much see old spot dear friend know recognise bow wear sweet lovely woman pretty child friend year come bid farewell say way south live die suffer much day number

So I am an old woman now and quite alone, and I am glad to go to them all. My friends wished me to go to the south, for I have always loved the sunshine, and there my little daughter died, and perhaps death will there come to me in gentler shape.

43,"""And then they took each other's hands, gently and quietly, the three old ladies, and softly kissed each other's withered cheeks, down which a few tears made their way; the time was past for them for anything but gentle and chastened feelings. And whispering to their old friend not good-bye, but 'Au revoir, au revoir in a better country,' my ladies parted once more with their childish friend.",take other hand old lady kiss other wither cheek few tear make way time past gentle chasten feeling whisper old friend good good country lady part more childish friend
