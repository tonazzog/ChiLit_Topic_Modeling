2,WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was all dark to the front.,ride way draw door house dark front 
3,"Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid.",tell jump knock give stirrup descend door open maid 
4,"""Is Dr. Livesey in?"" I asked.",ask 
5,"No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire.",say come afternoon go hall dine pass evening squire 
6,"""So there we go, boys,"" said Mr. Dance.",go boy say 
7,"This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house.",time distance short mount run stirrup leather lodge gate long leafless moonlit avenue white line hall building look hand great old garden dismount take admit word house 
8,"The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a bright fire.",servant lead matt passage show end great library line bookcase bust top squire sit pipe hand side bright fire 
9,"I had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man, over six feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. His eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.",see squire hand tall man foot high broad proportion have bluff rough ready face roughen redden line long travel eyebrow black move give look temper bad say quick high 
10,"""Come in, Mr. Dance,"" says he, very stately and condescending.",come say stately condescending 
11,"""Good evening, Dance,"" says the doctor with a nod. ""And good evening to you, friend Jim. What good wind brings you here?""",good evening dance say doctor nod good evening friend good wind bring 
12,"The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest. When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried ""Bravo!"" and broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's name) had got up from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.",supervisor stand stiff tell story lesson see gentleman learn look other forget smoke surprise interest hear mother go inn slap thigh squire cry break long pipe grate do remember squire name get seat strid room doctor hear good take powdered wig sit look strange own close croppe black poll 
13,At last Mr. Dance finished the story.,last finish story 
14,"""Mr. Dance,"" said the squire, ""you are a very noble fellow. And as for riding down that black, atrocious miscreant, I regard it as an act of virtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach. This lad Hawkins is a trump, I perceive. Hawkins, will you ring that bell? Mr. Dance must have some ale.""",say squire noble fellow ride black atrocious miscreant regard act virtue sir stamp cockroach lad trump perceive ring bell have ale 
15,"""And so, Jim,"" said the doctor, ""you have the thing that they were after, have you?""",say doctor have thing 
16,"""Here it is, sir,"" said I, and gave him the oilskin packet.",sir say give oilskin packet 
17,"The doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat.",doctor look finger itching open do put pocket coat 
18,"""Squire,"" said he, ""when Dance has had his ale he must, of course, be off on his Majesty's service; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house, and with your permission, I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup.""",say have ale course service mean keep sleep house permission propose have cold pie let sup 
19,"""As you will, Livesey,"" said the squire; ""Hawkins has earned better than cold pie.""",say squire earn good cold pie 
20,"So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and I made a hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a hawk, while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed.",big pigeon pie bring put sidetable make hearty supper hungry hawk compliment last dismiss 
21,"""And now, squire,"" said the doctor.",squire say doctor 
22,"""And now, Livesey,"" said the squire in the same breath.",say squire same breath 
23,"""One at a time, one at a time,"" laughed Dr. Livesey. ""You have heard of this Flint, I suppose?""",time time laugh hear suppose 
24,"""Heard of him!"" cried the squire. ""Heard of him, you say! He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was a child to Flint. The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I've seen his top-sails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.""",heard cry squire heard say bloodthirstiest buccaneer sail child afraid tell sir proud see top sail eye cowardly son rum puncheon sail put put sir 
25,"""Well, I've heard of him myself, in England,"" said the doctor. ""But the point is, had he money?""",hear say doctor point have money 
26,"""Money!"" cried the squire. ""Have you heard the story? What were these villains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?""",money cry squire hear story villain money care money risk rascal carcass money 
27,"""That we shall soon know,"" replied the doctor. ""But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?""",know reply doctor hot headed exclamatory get word want know suppose have pocket clue bury treasure treasure amount much 
28,"""Amount, sir!"" cried the squire. ""It will amount to this: If we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year.""",amount sir cry squire amount have clue talk fit ship dock take have treasure search year 
29,"""Very well,"" said the doctor. ""Now, then, if Jim is agreeable, we'll open the packet""; and he laid it before him on the table.",say doctor agreeable open packet lay table 
30,"The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It contained two things--a book and a sealed paper.",bundle sew doctor have get instrument case cut stitche medical scissors contain thing book seal paper 
31,"""First of all we'll try the book,"" observed the doctor.",first try book observe doctor 
32,"The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search. On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the same as the tattoo mark, ""Billy Bones his fancy""; then there was ""Mr. W. Bones, mate,"" ""No more rum,"" ""Off Palm Key he got itt,"" and some other snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help wondering who it was that had ""got itt,"" and what ""itt"" was that he got. A knife in his back as like as not.",squire peer shoulder open motion come side table eat enjoy sport search first page be scrap writing such man pen hand make idleness practice same tattoo mark fancy be mate more rum get itt other snatch single word unintelligible help wonder get itt itt get knife back 
33,"""Not much instruction there,"" said Dr. Livesey as he passed on.",much instruction say pass 
34,"The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added, as ""Offe Caraccas,"" or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as ""62o 17' 20"", 19o 2' 40"".""",next page fill curious series entrie be date end line other sum money common account book explanatory writing vary number cross 12th instance sum pound become due be cross explain cause few case sure name place add mere entry latitude longitude o ' ' 
35,"The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words appended, ""Bones, his pile.""",record last year amount separate entrie grow large time go end grand total make wrong addition word append bones pile 
36,"""I can't make head or tail of this,"" said Dr. Livesey.",make head tail say 
37,"""The thing is as clear as noonday,"" cried the squire. ""This is the black-hearted hound's account-book. These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel's share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something clearer. 'Offe Caraccas,' now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her--coral long ago.""",thing clear noonday cry squire black hearted hound account book cross stand name ship town sink plunder sum scoundrel share fear ambiguity see add clear see unhappy vessel board coast help poor soul manned coral 
38,"""Right!"" said the doctor. ""See what it is to be a traveller. Right! And the amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.""",right say doctor see traveller right amount increase see rise rank 
39,"There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French, English, and Spanish moneys to a common value.",be little else volume few bearing place note blank leave end table reduce french english spanish money common value 
40,"""Thrifty man!"" cried the doctor. ""He wasn't the one to be cheated.""",thrifty man cry doctor one cheat 
41,"""And now,"" said the squire, ""for the other.""",say squire other 
42,"The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain's pocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of hills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was about nine miles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon standing up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the centre part marked ""The Spy-glass."" There were several additions of a later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink--two on the north part of the island, one in the southwest--and beside this last, in the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the captain's tottery characters, these words: ""Bulk of treasure here.""",paper seal several place thimble way seal very thimble find captain pocket doctor open seal great care fall map island latitude longitude sounding name hill bay inlet particular need bring ship safe anchorage shore mile long shape say fat dragon stand have fine land lock harbour hill centre part mark glass be several addition late date cross red ink north part island southwest last same red ink small neat hand different captain tottery character word bulk treasure

49,"That was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible, it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight.",brief incomprehensible fill squire delight 
50,"""Livesey,"" said the squire, ""you will give up this wretched practice at once. Tomorrow I start for Bristol. In three weeks' time--three weeks!--two weeks--ten days--we'll have the best ship, sir, and the choicest crew in England. Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy. You'll make a famous cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, are ship's doctor; I am admiral. We'll take Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter. We'll have favourable winds, a quick passage, and not the least difficulty in finding the spot, and money to eat, to roll in, to play duck and drake with ever after.""",say squire give wretch practice tomorrow start week time week week day have good ship sir choicest crew come cabin boy make famous cabin boy ship doctor admiral take have favourable wind quick passage least difficulty find spot money eat roll play duck drake 
51,"""Trelawney,"" said the doctor, ""I'll go with you; and I'll go bail for it, so will Jim, and be a credit to the undertaking. There's only one man I'm afraid of.""",say doctor go go bail credit undertaking be man afraid 
52,"""And who's that?"" cried the squire. ""Name the dog, sir!""",cry squire name dog sir 
53,"""You,"" replied the doctor; ""for you cannot hold your tongue. We are not the only men who know of this paper. These fellows who attacked the inn tonight--bold, desperate blades, for sure--and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all, through thick and thin, bound that they'll get that money. We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found.""",reply doctor hold tongue only man know paper fellow attack inn tonight bold desperate blade sure rest stay lugger more say thick thin bind get money go get sea stick meanwhile take ride first last breathe word find
