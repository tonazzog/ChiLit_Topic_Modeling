1,CHAPTER VII. HARD QUESTIONS.,hard question 
2," After waiting until the minister left the vestry Daniel found that Jessica had gone away by the side entrance. He had to wait, therefore, until Wednesday morning for an opportunity to speak to her, and the sight of her pinched little face was welcome to him when he saw it looking wistfully over the coffee-stall. Yet he had made up his mind to forbid her to come again, and to threaten her with the policeman if he ever caught her at the chapel, where for the future he intended to keep a sharper lookout. But before he could speak Jess had slipped under the stall and taken her old seat upon the upturned basket.",wait minister leave vestry find go side entrance have wait morning opportunity speak sight pinch little face welcome see look coffee stall make mind forbid come threaten policeman catch chapel future intend keep sharper lookout speak slip stall take old seat upturned basket

8,"“Jess,” continued Daniel, more gently, “you’re a sharp little girl, I see; and now, mind, I’m going to trust you. You’re never to say a word about me or my coffee-stall; because the folks at our chapel are very grand, and might think it low and mean of me to keep a coffee-stall. Very likely they’d say I mustn’t be chapel-keeper any longer, and I should lose a deal of money.”",continue sharp little girl see mind go trust say word coffee stall folk chapel grand think low mean keep coffee stall likely say chapel keeper lose deal money

11,“What do you want such a deal of money for?” she inquired; “do you give it to God?”,want deal money inquire give 
12,"Daniel did not answer, but the question went to his heart like a sword-thrust. What did he want so much money for? He thought of his bare and solitary room, where he lodged alone, a good way from the railway-bridge, with very few comforts in it, but containing a desk, strong, securely fastened, and in which were his savings’ bank book, his receipts for money put out at interest, and a bag of sovereigns, for which he had been toiling and slaving both on Sunday and week-days. He could not remember giving any thing away, except the dregs of the coffee and the stale buns for which Jessica was asking God to pay him. He coughed, and cleared his throat, and rubbed his eyes; and then, with nervous and hesitating fingers, he took a penny from his bag and slipped it into Jessica’s hand.",answer question go heart sword thrust want much money think bare solitary room lodg good way railway bridge few comfort contain desk strong fasten savings bank book receipt money put interest bag sovereign toil slave week day remember give thing dreg coffee stale bun ask pay cough clear throat rub eye nervous hesitate finger take penny bag slip hand

19,"“Mr. Daniel,” said Jessica, when they were about to separate, and he would not take back his gift of a penny, “if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to come and buy a cup of coffee to-morrow, like a customer, you know; and I wont let out a word about the stall to the minister next Sunday. Don’t you be afraid.”",say about separate take gift penny mind like come buy cup coffee customer know let word stall minister next afraid
