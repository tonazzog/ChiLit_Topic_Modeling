2,"In the morning, it appeared that it had been right to remove to the Red-hill the night before.  Only some fragments of the roof of the house remained.  Some beams and a quantity of rubbish had fallen into the room where the party had lived since the flood came; and a heap of this rubbish lay on the very spot where Mildred would have been sleeping if they had stayed.  All saw and considered this with awe.  Roger himself looked first at the little girl, and then at that part of the ruin, as if imagining what it would have been for her to be lying there, and wondering to see her standing here, alive and unhurt.",morning appear right remove red night fragment roof house remain beam quantity rubbish fall room party live flood come heap rubbish lay very spot sleep stay see consider awe look little girl part ruin imagin lie wonder see standing alive unhurt

9,"He could not go on about that.  Presently he said, ""When the flood came, I suppose, there were no boats to be had.  It would take the first day to bring them from a distance, and get them afloat.  Then the people would look round (as they ought to do) to see where they could do most good.  Nobody who looked through a glass this way, since the day before yesterday, and saw those rafters sticking up in the air,--the house in ruins as it is,--would suppose that any one could be left alive here. From a distance, they can hardly fancy that even any little mouse could help being either drowned or starved.  This will be about the last spot in the Levels that any boat will come to.--You see, Mildred, our Red-hill, though it is everything to us, is but a speck compared with the grounds that have stood above water since the waters began to sink.

10,"Roger did not want to hear anything more of this kind; so he went to where George was lying, and began to whistle softly to him.  The child was so altered that his own mother would hardly have known him: but he smiled when he heard the whistle; and the smile was his own.  He put up his hand and patted Roger's face, and even pulled his hair with a good stout pull.  Roger had been used to nurse his dog, though not little children.  He now took George into his arms, and laid him comfortably across his knees, while he whistled till the little fellow looked full in his face, and puckered up his poor white lips, as if he would whistle too.  This made Roger laugh aloud; and then George laughed.  Ailwin heard them, and peeped into the corner of the tent where they were.  She flew to Oliver, to tell him that Roger was at his tricks worse than ever,--he was bewitching the baby.  She was angry at Oliver for telling his sister, when he had looked in too, that they might have been very glad any of them, to bewitch poor baby in this manner, when he was crying so sadly all yesterday.  Mildred, for her part, ran to thank Roger, and say how glad she should be to be able to whistle as he could.",want hear more kind go lie begin whistle child alter own mother know smile hear whistle smile own put hand patt face pull hair good stout pull use nurse dog little child take arm lay knee whistle little fellow look full face pucker poor white lip whistle make laugh laugh hear peep corner tent fly tell trick bad bewitch baby angry tell sister look glad bewitch poor baby manner cry yesterday part run thank say glad able whistle

12,"""No, I never could.  One day, long ago, when mother was very busy, and I was tired of playing, she gave me some salt into my hand, and told me I might put it upon the birds' tails in the garden, and so catch them: but I did not get one.  At last, half the salt was spilt, and the other half was melted in my hand; and then dinner was ready.

15,"""How he cries after you!"" exclaimed Mildred.  It was the first time Roger had ever known anybody to be sorry for his going away.  The child was certainly crying after him.  He half turned back, but turned again, saying--",cry exclaim first time know sorry go child cry half turn turn say

17,"The truth was, Roger had never forgotten the chest--the oaken chest which looked so tempting when he saw it floating down, and Oliver would not stop to catch it,--the stout chest which he knew to be now safe and sound somewhere about the house, unless harm had happened to it during the night.  Oliver agreed that it was of importance to bring this chest on shore: and the boys lost no time in doing it.  Mildred came out with George to watch their proceedings, and found that Oliver had already made one trip, and brought over some articles of use and value.  He came up to his sister, with something which he held carefully covered up in both hands.  He said gravely--",truth forget chest oaken chest look tempting see float stop catch stout chest know safe sound house harm happen night agree importance bring chest shore boy lose time do come watch proceedings find make trip bring article use value come sister hold cover hand say

23,"Ailwin and Roger were meantime disputing about which should have the raft first,--Roger wanting to secure the chest, and Ailwin insisting that it was high time the cow was milked.  Oliver said he was master here in his father's absence, and he would have no quarrels.  All three should go on the raft.  Roger should be landed at the staircase, where he could be collecting what he wanted to bring over, while Oliver proceeded to set Ailwin ashore beside the cow.  By working to the number of three, in harmony, far more would be gained than by using up strength in fighting and disputing.  He did not care how many times he crossed the water this day, if those whom he rowed would but keep the peace.  He would willingly be their servant in rowing, though he chose to be their master in deciding.",dispute have raft want secure chest insist high time cow milk say master father absence have quarrel go raft land staircase collect want bring proceed set cow work number harmony more gain use strength fighting dispute care many time cross water day row keep peace servant rowing choose master decide 
24,"Ailwin stared at Oliver.  It had struck her, and Mildred too, that Oliver seemed to have grown many years older since the flood came.  He was no taller, and no stronger;--indeed he seemed to-day to be growing weaker with fatigue; but he was not the timid boy he had always appeared before.  He spoke like a man; and there was the spirit of a man in his eyes.  It was not a singular instance.  There have been other cases in which a timid boy has been made a man of, on a sudden, by having to protect, from danger or in sorrow, some weaker than himself.  Roger felt something of the truth; and this had as much to do with making him quiet and tractable to-day as his interest about George, or his liking to live in a tent with companions, rather than in the open air and alone.",stare strike seem grow many year old flood come tall strong seem day grow weak fatigue timid boy appear speak man be spirit man eye singular instance be other case timid boy make man sudden have protect danger sorrow weak feel truth have much do make quiet tractable day interest like live tent companion open air 
25,"Ailwin was but a short time gone.  She came up the bank to Mildred, swinging her empty milk-pail, and sobbing, as if from the bottom of her heart.  Mildred did not think she had ever seen Ailwin cry so before; and she could imagine nothing now but that Oliver was lost.  She turned so giddy in a moment that she could not see Ailwin, and so sick that she could not speak to her.",short time gone come bank swing empty milk pail sobb bottom heart think see cry imagine lose turn giddy moment see sick speak 
26,"""So you have heard, Mildred,--you have heard, I see by your being so white.  Oliver says she has been dead ever so many hours.  I say, if we had gone the first thing, instead of staring and poking about yon tumble-down house, we might have saved her.  I shall never milk her again,--not a drop!--nor any other either, so far as I see; for there is no saying that we shall ever get away.

29,"""Indeed I am very sorry,"" said Mildred; and as she saw George pulling about the empty can, she melted into tears, which would come faster and faster till Oliver again stood by her side.  She tried to tell him what she had been afraid of, and how she thought she should not have cried but for that;--or, at least, not so much; but she really could not explain what she felt, her sobs came so thick.",sorry say see pull empty can melt tear come fast fast stand side try tell afraid think cry least much explain feel sob come thick

I had rather have lost anything we have left than the cow, now George is so ill.""--Here he bit his lip, and looked away from George, lest he should cry like his sister.  He went on, however, talking rather quickly at first, but becoming more composed as he proceeded.  He said, ""I have been thinking that it will never do for us who may be near losing everything we have, and our lives, after all, to grieve over each separate loss as it happens.

""When we said our prayers that night, and whenever we have said them since, we begged that we might be able to bear dying in this flood,--to bear whatever it pleased God to do.  Now, our right way is to make up our minds at once to everything, and just in the way it pleases God.  Let us try to bear it cheerfully, whether we lose the cow or anything else first; or whether we all die together.  That is the way, Mildred!--And if you and I should not die together, that must be the way too.""",reply glad hear say say prayer night say begg able bear die flood bear pleased do right way make mind way please let try bear lose cow else die way die way

So come, dear, and see this chest; and help us to settle what should be done with it.""",think likely useless unhappy lose person death anxious seem have long live come dear see chest help settle do 
35,"There was nothing about the outside of the chest to show whose it might be.  Everybody agreed that it ought to be opened immediately, lest all that it contained should be spoiled by the wet.  But how to open it was the question; for it had a very stout lock, and strong hinges.  After many attempts, it was found that nothing short of proper tools would answer the purpose: and Oliver went to see if his could be reached. Through piles of rubbish, and a puddle of slimy water, he got to the spot where he had left them,--hidden behind straw, that the Redfurns might not discover and spoil them.  The straw was washed away, and his beautiful lump of alabaster reduced to slime; but his tools were there,--in no very bright condition, but safe.  He hastened away from the spot; for thoughts crowded upon his mind of the day when he had last used these tools, and the way of life in which he and Mildred had been so happy, and which seemed now to be over for ever.  He thought of the beautiful stone carvings over the doorway, and of what Pastor Dendel had said to him about them.  They had fallen; and who knew what had become of kind Pastor Dendel?  The garden, with all its fresh green and gay blossoms, was now a muddy stream; rank smells and thick mists now came up from what had been meadows and corn-fields; and his father, whose manly voice had been daily heard singing from the mill, where was he? It would not do to stay thinking of these things; so Oliver hastened back with his tools, and with the heavy kitchen hammer, which he also found.",be outside chest show agree open contain spoiled wet open question have stout lock strong hinge many attempt find short proper tool answer purpose go see reach pile rubbish puddle slimy water get spot leave hide straw discover spoil straw wash beautiful lump alabaster reduce slime tool bright condition safe hasten spot thought crowd mind day use tool way life happy seem think beautiful stone carving doorway say fall know become kind garden fresh green gay blossom muddy stream rank smell thick mist come meadow corn- field father manly voice hear sing mill do stay think thing hasten tool heavy kitchen hammer find 
36,"None of these would open the chest.  The party managed it at last by heating a large nail, which they drew out from a shattered door-post, and burning holes in the wood of the chest, close by the nails which fastened the hinges, so as to loosen them, and make them drop out.  The lid being raised, a great variety of articles was found within, so nicely packed that the wet had penetrated but a very little way. Mildred had looked on thoughtfully; and she saw that Oliver paused when the contents lay open to view.  She looked in her brother's face, and said--",open chest party manage last heat large nail draw shattered door post burn hole wood chest close nail fasten hinge loosen make drop lid raise great variety article find packed wet penetrate little way look see pause content lay open view look brother face say

63,"Roger was not long in finding a hole in a tree where he could hide his bag of money.  He cut a small cross in the bark by which he might know the tree again, and hastened back, to see what else he could secure.  He found plenty of pretty things hanging on the bushes, and did not wait for their being quite dry to dress himself as he had never been dressed before.  With the embroidered cap above mentioned on his head, a scarlet waistcoat, worked with silver thread, hanging loose about his body, and a light blue coat, whose skirts reached his heels, he looked so little like the dirty ragged Roger, that Geordie shrank back from him, at first sight, and did not smile till he heard the soft whistle again.  After that, he seemed more pleased with the finery than all the rest of the party together.  Ailwin glanced scornfully upon it, as if she had disapproved from the beginning its being touched; and Oliver and Mildred looked grave.",long find hole tree hide bag money cut small cross bark know tree hasten see else secure find plenty pretty thing hang bush wait dry dress dress embroider cap mention head scarlet waistcoat work silver thread hang body light blue coat skirt reach heel look little dirty ragged shrank first sight smile hear soft whistle seem pleased finery rest party glance disapprove beginning touch look grave 
64,"So very much pleased was Geordie with the gay waistcoat, that Roger took him into his arms, that he might be able to stroke it, and play with the silver flowers.  It was little fatigue, now, except to the spirits, to nurse poor George.  He was shrunk to skin and bone, and so light as to startle those who had been accustomed to lift him.  It was grievous, however, to look at the ghastly stretched features, the flabby tremulous little arms, and the suffering expression of countenance.  To hear his feeble cry was worse still.  Oliver was really glad to take Mildred away from seeing and hearing him, as long as the child would be quiet with Roger: so he asked her to filter more water through the gravel.  He begged her to get ready a great deal--enough for them all to drink, and to bathe George in; for the water about them was becoming of a worse quality every day.  It was unsafe even to live near; and much more to drink.  So he scraped up a quantity of clean dry gravel from the ledges of the precipice where the first flood had thrown it, and helped Mildred to press this gravel down in the worn old basket.  This basket they set across the tub, which they first thoroughly cleaned.  Mildred poured water upon the gravel by degrees; and it was astonishing how much purer and better it came out of the tub than it went into the basket.  When the tub was full, Ailwin heated some of the water presently over her large fire, and made a warm bath for the child.",pleased gay waistcoat take arm able stroke play silver flower little fatigue spirit nurse poor shrink skin bone light startle accustom lift grievous look ghastly stretch feature flabby tremulous little arm suffering expression countenance hear feeble cry bad glad take see hear child quiet ask filter more water gravel begg get ready great deal drink bathe water become bad quality day unsafe live more drink scrape quantity clean dry gravel ledge precipice first flood throw help press gravel wear old basket basket set tub clean pour water gravel degree astonish much purer good come tub go basket tub full heat water large fire make warm bath child 
65,"Roger was unwilling to give him up when the bath was ready, so new and so pleasant did he find it to be liked and loved by anybody--to have power over any one, so much more easy and delightful to exercise than that of force.  But, not only was the bath ready, and must not be left to cool, but Oliver beckoned him away on some very particular business.",unwilling give bath ready new pleasant find like love have power one easy delightful exercise force bath ready leave cool beckon particular business 
66,"This business was indeed pressing.  All the party had complained that the bad smells about the Red-hill became really oppressive.  They did not know how great was the danger of their all falling ill of fever, in consequence; but every one of them felt languid and uncomfortable. Oliver made the circuit of the hill, to discover whether there was any cause for this evil that could be removed.  He was surprised to find the number of dead animals that were lying about in holes and corners, as well as the heap of Roger's game, now actually putrefying in the sun. There was also a dead horse thrown up, on the side where the quarry was; and about this horse were such swarms of flies as Oliver had never seen. It was to consult about pushing back this horse into the stream, and clearing away all other dead things that they could find, that Oliver now called Roger.",business press party complain bad smell red hill become oppressive know great danger fall ill fever consequence one feel languid uncomfortable make circuit hill discover be cause evil remove surprise find number dead animal lie hole corner heap game putrefy sun be dead horse throw side quarry horse such swarm fly see consult push horse stream clear other dead thing find call 
67,"Roger was struck with what he observed.  He saw no difficulty in clearing away the game he ought never to have left lying in a heap in the sun.  He believed, too, that with stout poles he and Oliver could shove the horse into the water; and, with a line tied to its head, tow it out of the still water into the current which yet ran from the quarry.  But what troubled him more was, that there was evidently a mortality among the animals on the hill.  They were dying in all directions; some for want of proper food, and from being put out of their usual habits: others from being preyed upon by their stronger neighbours.  Nothing seemed to thrive but the ravenous birds which came in clusters, winging their way over the waters, and making a great rustling of their pinions as they descended to perch upon some dead animal, pulling it to pieces before the very eyes of the boys, as they stood consulting what to do.  It was a horrid sight: and it brought the horrid thought that soon probably there would be no game left for food for the party; and that what there was meantime might be unwholesome. Oliver had never imagined that the bold boy, Roger Redfurn, could look so alarmed as he did at this moment.",strike observe see difficulty clear game leave lie heap sun believe stout pole shove horse water line tie head tow still water current run quarry trouble more be mortality animal hill die direction want proper food put usual habit other prey strong neighbour seem thrive ravenous bird come cluster wing way water make great rustling pinion descend perch dead animal pull piece very eye boy stand consult do horrid sight bring horrid thought be game leave food party be meantime unwholesome imagine bold boy look alarmed do moment

""Our shy, pretty, innocent little birds, that used to be so pleased to pick up twigs and straws to build their nests with, and be satisfied with the worms and slugs and flies that they cleared away from the garden.

His master soon set him to work, and began to work himself, in a sort of desperation.  It was astonishing what a clearance was made in a short time.  But it did not do all the good that was expected.  There was so much vegetable decay in the region round, that the floating dead animals off to a distance caused only a partial relief.",come hesitation answer whistle master same master set work begin work sort desperation astonish clearance make short time do good expect be much vegetable decay region float dead animal distance cause partial relief 
74,"While the boys were hard at work at their disagreeable task, Mildred was enjoying seeing George in his warm bath.  Ailwin held him there, while Mildred continued her useful business of filtering water, talking to the child all the while.  The poor little fellow soon left off crying, and moved his weak limbs about in the tepid water, trying to splash Ailwin, as he had been wont to splash his mother in play, every morning when she washed and dressed him.",boy hard work disagreeable task enjoy see warm bath hold continue useful business filter water talk child while poor little fellow leave cry move weak limb tepid water try splash wont splash mother play morning wash dress

76,"Ailwin shook her head.  She saw how impossible it would be even to keep a healthy child well in the absence of proper food, in an unwholesome atmosphere, and without sufficient shelter from the changes of weather which might come at any hour, and must come soon.  How unlikely it was that a sick baby should recover under such circumstances, she was well aware.  Yet she little thought how near the end was.",shake head see impossible keep healthy child absence proper food unwholesome atmosphere sufficient shelter change weather come hour come unlikely sick baby recover such circumstance aware little think end 
77,"After his bath, Geordie lay, nicely covered up, on a mattress under the tent.  One or other of his nurses visited, him every few minutes; and both were satisfied that he was comfortably asleep.  The boys came for some dinner, at last; and while Oliver went to wash his hands in clean water, Roger stooped over the child to kiss him.  Before doing so, however, he started back, and asked Ailwin why the baby's eyes looked so strangely.  They were half closed, and seemed like neither sleep nor waking.  Ailwin sat down on the mattress, and took him into her arms, while Mildred ran to call Oliver.  The poor child stretched himself stiff across Ailwin's knees, and then breathed no more.",bath lay cover mattress tent other nurse visit few minute satisfied asleep boy come dinner last go wash hand clean water stoop child kiss do start ask baby eye look half close seem sleep wake sit mattress take arm run call poor child stretch knee breathe more 
78,"When Oliver and Mildred came running back, Ailwin was putting her cheek near the child's mouth, to feel if there was indeed no breath.  She shook her head, and her eyes ran over with tears.  Oliver kneeled down, and put his hand to the heart--it did not beat.  He lifted the wasted arm--it fell, as if it had never had life in it.  There lay the little body, still unmoved, with the face composed,--the eyes dim and half closed, the ear hearing nothing, the tongue silent, while all were calling on little George to say something he had been fond of saying, to hearken to something he had loved to hear, and--all in vain.",come run put cheek child mouth feel be breath shake head eye run tear kneel put hand heart beat lift waste arm fall have life lay little body unmoved face compose eye dim half close ear hear tongue silent call little say fond say hearken love hear vain

82,"""O hush!  All of you!"" exclaimed Oliver.  ""Be quiet, Mildred dear!  Our little brother is dead.""",exclaim quiet dear little brother dead 
83,"Roger threw himself on the grass, and hid his face on his arms.  He moaned and rocked himself about, so that, even in the first moments of their grief, the brother and sister looked at each other with awe.",throw grass hide face arm moan rock first moment grief brother sister look other awe

86,"""Give him to me,"" said Oliver.  He took the body from Ailwin's arms, carrying it as gently as if anything could have hurt it now; and he and Mildred walked away towards the spot where the bee-shed had stood. Ailwin gazed after them, dashing away the tears with the back of her hand, when they gathered so that she could not see.",give say take body arm carry hurt walk spot bee shed stand gaze dash tear back hand gather see 
87,"Oliver and Mildred walked on till they could descend the bank a little, and sit, just above the waters, where they knew they were out of sight of everybody.  This bank presented a strange appearance, such as the children had been wondering at for some days, till Ailwin remembered that she had often heard say that there was once a thick forest growing where the Levels were now spread, and that the old trees were, every one, somehow underground.  It now appeared that this was true.  As the earth was washed away in the channel, and cut down along the bank, large trunks of trees were seen lying along, black as coal.  Some others started out of the bank; and the roots of a few spread like network, holding the soil together, and keeping the bank firm in that part.  Upon one of the trunks, that jutted out, Oliver took his seat; and Mildred placed herself beside him.",walk descend bank little sit water know sight bank present strange appearance such child wonder day remember hear say be thick forest grow level spread old tree one underground appear true earth wash channel cut bank large trunk tree see lie black coal other start bank root few spread network hold soil keep bank firm part trunk jutt take seat place

98,"""If we die here,"" said Mildred, ""it will be easy to do without, him for such a little while.  But if we ever get away, if we grow up to be as old as father and mother, what shall we do, all those years, without once hearing Geordie laugh, or having him to wake us in the morning?

They found more than one that they liked; but suddenly remembered that the ground was hard, and that they had no spade, nor any tool with which they could make a deep hole.",child go tree fix spot grave find more like remember ground hard have spade tool make deep hole 
115,"Oliver was greatly disturbed at this,--more than he chose to show when he saw how troubled his sister also was.  After thinking for some time to no purpose,--feeling that he could not bear to commit the body to the foul flood, and remembering with horror how many animals were scratching up the earth all over the Red-hill, where the ground was not too hard, and how many odious birds of prey were now hovering in the air, at all hours,--after thinking over these things with a heavy heart, he begged Mildred to go home to Ailwin, and to ask Roger to come to him in the wood, to consult what must be done.",disturb more choose show see troubled sister think time purpose feel bear commit body foul flood remember horror many animal scratch earth red hill ground hard many odious bird prey hover air hour think thing heavy heart begg go ask come wood consult do 
116,"Mildred readily went: but she hardly liked to speak to Roger when she saw him.  He was watching, with a sulky air, what Ailwin was doing, as she bent over the mattress.  His eyes were red with crying; but he did not seem the more gentle for that.  When Mildred had given her message, he moved as if he thought it a great trouble to go; but Mildred then suspected what was indeed the truth,--that he was unhappy at the child's death, and was ashamed of appearing so, and put on a gruff manner to hide it.  Seeing this, the little girl ran after him, as he sauntered away, put her hand in his, and said,--",go like speak see watch sulky air do bend mattress eye red cry seem gentle give message move think great trouble go suspect truth unhappy child death ashamed appear put gruff manner hide see little girl run saunter put hand say

119,"""Are you, indeed?"" said Mildred, her eyes now filling with tears.",say eye fill tear 
120,"Roger could not bear to see that; and he hastened away.  Mildred found a great change when she looked on the baby's face again.  The eyes were quite closed, and Ailwin had tied a bandage round his head,--under the chin, and among the thick hair which used to curl so prettily, but which had hung straight and damp since he had been ill.  He was now strangely dressed, and laid out straight and stiff.  He did not look like Geordie; and now Mildred began to know the dreary feelings that death brings into families.  She longed for Oliver to come home; and would have gone to see what he was about, but that she did not like to leave the tent and the body while Ailwin was busy elsewhere, which was now the case.",bear see hasten find great change look baby face eye close tie bandage head chin thick hair use curl hang straight damp ill dress lay straight stiff look begin know dreary feeling death bring family long come go see like leave tent body busy case 
121,"When, at length, the boys returned, they reported that, for many reasons, there could not be a grave under the trees, as they would have liked.  They had hopes of making one which would save the body from the flood, and would serve at least till the day (if that day ever came) when it might be removed to some churchyard.  They had no tools to dig a deep hole with; and if there was a hole, it must be deep: but they found they could excavate a space in the bank, under the trunk of one of the large buried forest-trees.  They could line this hole with hewn stones brought from the shattered wall of the house, and could close it in also with a stone,--thus making the space at once a coffin and a grave, as secure from beast or bird of prey as any vault under any church-wall. Oliver had found among the ruins one of the beautiful carved stones which he had always admired as it surmounted the doorway of their home. With this he meant to close in the little vault.  At some future time, if no one should wish to disturb the remains, ivy might be led over the face of the bank, and about this sculptured stone; and then, he thought, even those who most loved little George could not wish him a better grave.",length boy return report many reason be grave tree like have hope make save body flood serve least day day come remove churchyard have tool dig deep hole be hole deep find excavate space bank trunk large bury forest tree line hole hewn stone bring shattered wall house close stone make space coffin grave secure beast bird prey vault church wall find ruin beautiful carve stone admire surmount doorway home mean close little vault future time wish disturb remains ivy lead face bank sculpture stone think love little wish good grave
