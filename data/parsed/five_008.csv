15,"A struggle on the edge of a water-butt is exciting but damp. When it was over, and the boys were partially dried, Anthea said--",struggle edge water butt exciting damp boy dry say

21,"The others consented. Bandits was hastily chosen for the game. ""It's as good as anything else,"" said Jane gloomily. It must be owned that Robert was at first but a half-hearted bandit, but when Anthea had borrowed from Martha the red-spotted handkerchief in which the keeper had brought her mushrooms that morning, and had tied up Robert's head with it so that he could be the wounded hero who had saved the bandit captain's life the day before, he cheered up wonderfully. All were soon armed. Bows and arrows slung on the back look well; and umbrellas and cricket stumps through the belt give a fine impression of the wearer's being armed to the teeth. The white cotton hats that men wear in the country nowadays have a very brigandish effect when a few turkey's feathers are stuck in them. The Lamb's mail-cart was covered with a red-and-blue checked table-cloth, and made an admirable baggage-wagon. The Lamb asleep inside it was not at all in the way. So the banditti set out along the road that led to the sand-pit.",other consent bandit choose game good else say own first half hearted bandit borrow red spot handkerchief keeper bring mushroom morning tie head wound hero save bandit captain life day cheer armed bow arrow sling back look umbrella cricket stump belt give fine impression wearer armed tooth white cotton hat man wear country have brigandish effect few turkey feather stuck mail cart cover red blue check table cloth make admirable baggage wagon way banditti set road lead sand pit

23,"It is all very well to make up your minds to play bandit--or chess, or ping-pong, or any other agreeable game--but it is not easy to do it with spirit when all the wonderful wishes you can think of, or can't think of, are waiting for you round the corner. The game was dragging a little, and some of the bandits were beginning to feel that the others were disagreeable things, and were saying so candidly, when the baker's boy came along the road with loaves in a basket. The opportunity was not one to be lost.",make mind play bandit chess ping pong other agreeable game easy do spirit wonderful wish think think wait corner game drag little bandit begin feel other disagreeable thing say baker boy come road loaf basket opportunity lose 
24,"""Stand and deliver!"" cried Cyril.",stand deliver cry 
25,"""Your money or your life!"" said Robert.",money life say 
26,"And they stood on each side of the baker's boy. Unfortunately, he did not seem to enter into the spirit of the thing at all. He was a baker's boy of an unusually large size. He merely said--",stand side baker boy seem enter spirit thing baker boy large size say 
27,"""Chuck it now, d'ye hear!"" and pushed the bandits aside most disrespectfully.",chuck hear push bandit most 
28,"Then Robert lassoed him with Jane's skipping-rope, and instead of going round his shoulders, as Robert intended, it went round his feet and tripped him up. The basket was upset, the beautiful new loaves went bumping and bouncing all over the dusty chalky road. The girls ran to pick them up, and all in a moment Robert and the baker's boy were fighting it out, man to man, with Cyril to see fair play, and the skipping-rope twisting round their legs like an interesting snake that wished to be a peace-maker. It did not succeed; indeed the way the boxwood handles sprang up and hit the fighters on the shins and ankles was not at all peace-making. I know this is the second fight--or contest--in this chapter, but I can't help it. It was that sort of day. You know yourself there are days when rows seem to keep on happening, quite without your meaning them to. If I were a writer of tales of adventure such as those which used to appear in _The Boys of England_ when I was young of course I should be able to describe the fight, but I cannot do it. I never can see what happens during a fight, even when it is only dogs. Also, if I had been one of these _Boys of England_ writers, Robert would have got the best of it. But I am like George Washington--I cannot tell a lie, even about a cherry-tree, much less about a fight, and I cannot conceal from you that Robert was badly beaten, for the second time that day. The baker's boy blacked his other eye, and being ignorant of the first rules of fair play and gentlemanly behaviour, he also pulled Robert's hair, and kicked him on the knee. Robert always used to say he could have licked the baker if it hadn't been for the girls. But I am not sure. Anyway, what happened was this, and very painful it was to self-respecting boys.",lassoe skip rope go shoulder intend go foot trip basket upset beautiful new loaf go bump bounce dusty chalky road girl run pick moment baker boy fight man man see fair play skip rope twist leg interesting snake wish peace maker succeed way boxwood handle spring hit fighter shin ankle peace making know second fight contest chapter help sort day know be day row seem keep happen meaning writer tale adventure such use appear young course able describe fight do see happen fight dog gboy writer get good tell lie cherry tree less fight conceal beat second time day baker boy black other eye ignorant first rule fair play gentlemanly behaviour pull hair kick knee use say lick baker girl sure happen painful self respect boy

30,"Cyril was just tearing off his coat so as to help his brother in proper style, when Jane threw her arms round his legs and began to cry and ask him not to go and be beaten too. That ""too"" was very nice for Robert, as you can imagine--but it was nothing to what he felt when Anthea rushed in between him and the baker's boy, and caught that unfair and degraded fighter round the waist, imploring him not to fight any more.",tear coat help brother proper style throw arm leg begin cry ask go beat nice imagine feel rush baker boy catch unfair degrade fighter waist implor fight more

32,"You see how unfair this was to Robert. Because, if the baker's boy had had any right and chivalrous instincts, and had yielded to Anthea's pleading and accepted her despicable apology, Robert could not, in honour, have done anything to him at any future time. But Robert's fears, if he had any, were soon dispelled. Chivalry was a stranger to the breast of the baker's boy. He pushed Anthea away very roughly, and he chased Robert with kicks and unpleasant conversation right down the road to the sand-pit, and there, with one last kick, he landed him in a heap of sand.",see unfair baker boy have right chivalrous instinct yield pleading accept despicable apology honour do future time fear have dispell stranger breast baker boy push chase kick unpleasant conversation road sand pit last kick land heap sand 
33,"""I'll larn you, you young varmint!"" he said, and went off to pick up his loaves and go about his business. Cyril, impeded by Jane, could do nothing without hurting her, for she clung round his legs with the strength of despair. The baker's boy went off red and damp about the face; abusive to the last, he called them a pack of silly idiots, and disappeared round the corner. Then Jane's grasp loosened. Cyril turned away in silent dignity to follow Robert, and the girls followed him, weeping without restraint.",larn young varmint say go pick loaf go business imped do hurt cling leg strength despair baker boy go red damp face abusive last call pack silly idiot disappear corner grasp loosen turn silent dignity follow girl follow weep restraint 
34,"It was not a happy party that flung itself down in the sand beside the sobbing Robert. For Robert was sobbing--mostly with rage. Though of course I know that a really heroic boy is always dry-eyed after a fight. But then he always wins, which had not been the case with Robert.",happy party flung sand sobbing sobb rage course know heroic boy dry eyed fight win case

41,"He dug his fingers in the sand, and sprang up, for his hand had touched something furry. It was the Psammead, of course--""On the look-out to make sillies of them as usual,"" as Cyril remarked later. And of course the next moment Robert's wish was granted, and he was bigger than the baker's boy. Oh, but much, much bigger! He was bigger than the big policeman who used to be at the crossing at the Mansion House years ago,--the one who was so kind in helping old ladies over the crossing,--and he was the biggest man _I_ have ever seen, as well as the kindest. No one had a foot-rule in its pocket, so Robert could not be measured--but he was taller than your father would be if he stood on your mother's head, which I am sure he would never be unkind enough to do. He must have been ten or eleven feet high, and as broad as a boy of that height ought to be. His suit had fortunately grown too, and now he stood up in it--with one of his enormous stockings turned down to show the gigantic bruise on his vast leg. Immense tears of fury still stood on his flushed giant face. He looked so surprised, and he was so large to be wearing a turned down collar outside of his jacket that the others could not help laughing.",dig finger sand spring hand touch furry course look make silly usual remark course next moment wish grant big baker boy much big big big policeman use crossing year one kind help old lady crossing big man see kindest have foot rule pocket measure tall father stand mother head sure unkind do foot high broad boy height suit grow stand enormous stocking turn show gigantic bruise vast leg immense tear fury stand flush giant face look surprised large wear turn collar jacket other help laugh

He pulled up his stocking, which was as large as a small bolster-case, and strode off. His strides were six or seven feet long, so that it was quite easy for him to be at the bottom of the hill, ready to meet the baker's boy when he came down swinging the empty basket to meet his master's cart, which had been leaving bread at the cottages along the road.",look hit say _kill give remember wait pull stock pull stock large small bolster case strode stride foot long easy bottom hill ready meet baker boy come swing empty basket meet master cart leave bread cottage road

59,"He lifted up the baker's boy and set him on the top of the haystack, which was about sixteen feet from the ground, and then he sat down on the roof of the barn and told the baker's boy exactly what he thought of him. I don't think the boy heard it all--he was in a sort of trance of terror. When Robert had said everything he could think of, and some things twice over, he shook the boy and said--",lift baker boy set top haystack foot ground sit roof barn tell baker boy think think boy hear sort trance terror say think thing shake boy say

62,"I don't know how the baker's boy got down, but I do know that he missed the cart and got into the very hottest of hot water when he turned up at last at the bakehouse. I am sorry for him, but after all, it was quite right that he should be taught that boys mustn't use their feet when they fight, but their fists. Of course the water he got into only became hotter when he tried to tell his master about the boy he had licked and the giant as high as a church, because no one could possibly believe such a tale as that.

63,"When Robert rejoined the others he found them in the garden. Anthea had thoughtfully asked Martha to let them have dinner out there--because the dining-room was rather small, and it would have been so awkward to have a brother the size of Robert in there. The Lamb, who had slept peacefully during the whole stormy morning, was now found to be sneezing, and Martha said he had a cold and would be better indoors.",rejoin other find garden ask let have dinner dining room small awkward have brother size sleep whole stormy morning find sneez say have cold good

66,"Martha brought out the dinner--it was cold veal and baked potatoes, with sago pudding and stewed plums to follow.",bring dinner cold veal bake potato sago pudding stew plum follow 
67,"She of course did not notice that Robert was anything but the usual size, and she gave him as much meat and potatoes as usual and no more. You have no idea how small your usual helping of dinner looks when you are many times your proper size. Robert groaned, and asked for more bread. But Martha would not go on giving more bread for ever. She was in a hurry, because the keeper intended to call on his way to Benenhurst Fair, and she wished to be smartly dressed before he came.",course notice usual size give much meat potato usual more have idea small usual help dinner look many time proper size groan ask more bread go give more bread hurry keeper intend call way wish dress come

72,"""No,"" she said, breathless from being thumped, ""it's--it's not a plum-stone. It's an idea. Let's take Robert to the Fair, and get them to give us money for showing him!

74,"And so it turned out. The idea appealed irresistibly to everyone but Robert, and even he was brought round by Anthea's suggestion that he should have a double share of any money they might make. There was a little old pony-cart in the coach-house--the kind that is called a governess-cart. It seemed desirable to get to the Fair as quickly as possible, so Robert--who could now take enormous steps and so go very fast indeed--consented to wheel the others in this. It was as easy to him now as wheeling the Lamb in the mail-cart had been in the morning. The Lamb's cold prevented his being of the party.",turn idea appeal bring suggestion have double share money make be little old pony cart coach house kind call governess cart seem desirable get possible take enormous step go consent wheel other easy wheel mail cart morning cold prevent being party

And we didn't bring him up to the Fair because people do stare so, and they seem to go into kind of standing-up fits when they see him.

91,"She had taken Anthea's hand, and was holding it very firmly; and Anthea could not help wondering what would happen if Robert should have wandered off or turned his proper size during the interval.

When the woman saw the hand she said ""My!"" but when she saw the foot she said ""Upon my word!"" and when, by slow and heavy degrees, the whole of Robert's enormous bulk was at last disclosed, she drew a long breath and began to say many things, compared with which ""balmy"" and ""crumpet"" seemed quite ordinary.

96,"This was not very small, and a crowd gathered quickly, so that it was at the head of an enthusiastic procession that Robert entered the trampled meadow where the Fair was held, and passed over the stubby yellow dusty grass to the door of the biggest tent. He crept in, and the woman went to call her Bill. He was the big sleeping man, and he did not seem at all pleased at being awakened. Cyril, watching through a slit in the tent, saw him scowl and shake a heavy fist and a sleepy head. Then the woman went on speaking very fast. Cyril heard ""Strewth,"" and ""biggest draw you ever, so help me!"" and he began to share Robert's feeling that fifteen shillings was indeed far too little. Bill slouched up to the tent and entered. When he beheld the magnificent proportions of Robert he said but little,--""Strike me pink!"" were the only words the children could afterwards remember,--but he produced fifteen shillings, mainly in sixpences and coppers, and handed it to Robert.",small crowd gather head enthusiastic procession enter trample meadow hold pass stubby yellow dusty grass door big tent creep woman go call big sleeping man seem pleased awaken watch slit tent see scowl shake heavy fist sleepy head woman go speak hear big draw help begin share feeling shilling little slouch tent enter beheld magnificent proportion say little strike pink only word child remember produce shilling sixpence copper hand

105,"Bill was a man who knew his business. In a very little while, the photographic views, the spyglasses you look at them through so that they really seem rather real, and the lights you see them by, were all packed away. A curtain--it was an old red-and-black carpet really--was run across the tent. Robert was concealed behind, and Bill was standing on a trestle-table outside the tent making a speech. It was rather a good speech. It began by saying that the giant it was his privilege to introduce to the public that day was the eldest son of the Emperor of San Francisco, compelled through an unfortunate love affair with the Duchess of the Fiji Islands to leave his own country and take refuge in England--the land of liberty--where freedom was the right of every man, no matter how big he was. It ended by the announcement that the first twenty who came to the tent door should see the giant for threepence apiece. ""After that,"" said Bill, ""the price is riz, and I don't undertake to say what it won't be riz to. So now's yer time.""",man know business little while photographic view spyglass look seem real light see pack curtain old red black carpet run tent conceal stand trestle table tent make speech good speech begin say giant privilege introduce public day old son emperor compel unfortunate love affair leave own country take refuge land liberty freedom right man matter big end announcement first come tent door see giant threepence apiece say price riz undertake say riz time

112,"The fierceness was only caused by Robert's trying not to laugh. But the desire to do that soon left him, and before sunset he was more inclined to cry than laugh, and more inclined to sleep than either. For, by ones and twos and threes, people kept coming in all the afternoon, and Robert had to shake hands with those who wished it, and to allow himself to be punched and pulled and patted and thumped, so that people might make sure he was really real.",fierceness cause try laugh desire do leave sunset inclined cry laugh inclined sleep one two three person keep come afternoon have shake hand wish allow punch pull patt thump person make sure real 
113,"The other children sat on a bench and watched and waited, and were very bored indeed. It seemed to them that this was the hardest way of earning money that could have been invented. And only fifteen shillings! Bill had taken four times that already, for the news of the giant had spread, and trades-people in carts, and gentlepeople in carriages, came from far and near. One gentleman with an eyeglass, and a very large yellow rose in his buttonhole, offered Robert, in an obliging whisper, ten pounds a week to appear at the Crystal Palace.

No, Jane, it's no good Robert going out and knocking people down. The police would follow him till he turned his proper size, and then arrest him like a shot. Go you must!

The front-door boy was Cyril; the back-door was Robert--now, since sunset, once more his proper size. They walked quickly through the field, along the road, where Robert caught Cyril up. Then they ran. They were home as soon as the girls were, for it was a long way, and they ran most of it. It was indeed a _very_ long way, as they found when they had to go and drag the pony-cart home next morning, with no enormous Robert to wheel them in it as if it were a mail-cart, and they were babies and he was their gigantic nursemaid.",corn say boy move lose crowd front door boy back door sunset proper size walk field road catch run girl long way run most _very_ long way find have go drag pony cart next morning enormous wheel mail cart baby gigantic nursemaid
