1,CHAPTER IV.,
2," When Leila entered the school-room Selina was reading, but Matilda stood gazing out at the window with rather a disturbed expression of countenance. “Well, Cousin Leila,” she said, “we have news for you, and not very good news either. Now all the day long it will be,--‘Hold up your head, Miss Leila,’ ‘Why do you walk in that awkward way, Miss Matilda?’ ‘How troublesome you are; I wish you would take example by your elder sister--one awkward trick after another--I really must complain of you to Mrs. Stanley.’ Yes, Selina, you need not shake your head at me and look so grave; Leila will look grave also when she knows the truth. Yes, Leila, I was quite right, it is all settled, we are to have a governess; so no more pleasant days for us. Botheration, botheration.”",enter school room read stand gaze window disturbed expression countenance cousin say have news good news day hold head walk awkward way troublesome wish take example elder sister awkward trick complain shake head look grave look grave know truth right settle have governess pleasant day botheration botheration 
3,"Leila had not been able to resist laughing at first; but she checked herself, and remained silent.",able resist laugh first check remain silent 
4,"Selina spoke. “Oh, Matilda! how can you speak in this way, and after all mamma has been just saying? and you seemed to feel it so.”",speak speak way mamma say seem feel 
5,"“Yes, I know I am wrong; and when mamma was speaking to me I felt very sorry, and I resolved I would try to please this Mrs. Roberts, or rather mamma, for I would rather please mamma than any one in the whole world; but, Leila, you looked when you came in as if you had something joyful to say; if you have, please to say it, for we need good news very much to-day.”",know wrong mamma speak feel sorry resolve try please mamma please mamma one whole world look come have joyful say have say need good news day 
6,"But no sooner had Leila communicated the pleasant intelligence of the proposed visit to Woodlands, than all traces of sorrow were banished from Matilda’s face; she was in ecstasies, and, flying across the room, she dashed the book from Selina’s hands, and throwing her arms round her neck, she exclaimed,--“Now no more reading to-day, if you please, _Mrs. Demure_; this is what I call the right kind of a holiday--how merry we shall be! Well, I do think Uncle Howard makes most delightful plans; how do you manage, Leila, to get him to do so many nice things?”",communicate pleasant intelligence propose visit trace sorrow banish face ecstasie fly room dash book hand throw arm neck exclaim more read day call right kind holiday merry think make delightful plan manage get do many nice thing 
7,"“I don’t manage,” Leila answered; “he is always thinking of doing kind things to me and every body, and he has told me all about our governess, and made me like having one more than I did at first; I will tell you about it as we go along, for we are to walk, you know, and we must make haste and get ready, that papa and uncle and aunt may not be there long before us.”",manage answer think do kind thing body tell governess make have more do first tell go walk know make haste get ready papa uncle aunt 
8,"The walk proved every way delightful. The sky so brightly blue, the sunshine splendid, and the woods, now tinted with the glowing hues of autumn, gave additional beauty to the scene. Here and there a solitary unprotected tree, standing out from the others, might have given warning to more contemplative minds that winter and its storms were approaching; but there was no winter in their young hearts--all was fresh, gay, and green, and withered leaves brought to them no memory of blighted hopes, and of a world of many sorrows.",walk prove way delightful sky blue sunshine splendid wood tint glow hue autumn give additional beauty scene solitary unprotected tree stand other give warning more contemplative mind winter storm approach be winter young heart fresh gay green wither leave bring memory blight hope world many sorrow 
9,"The distance could not be two miles, they all agreed, though Matilda and Alfred did their best to lengthen it, by continuing, during every few yards of their progress, to run up a little bank by the side of the road and down again, assuring the others that it was by far the quickest way of getting on, but Leila greatly preferred walking quietly straight forward with Selina; it was always a particular pleasure to her to have Selina entirely to herself. She now related to her all her papa had told her of Mrs. Roberts, and many were the good resolutions made by both, that they would do all they could to make her situation pleasant to her. As they came in sight of a pretty-looking house, standing in a small garden, Leila stopped.",distance mile agree do good lengthen continue few yard progress run little bank side road assure other quick way get prefer walk particular pleasure have relate papa tell many good resolution make do make situation pleasant come sight pretty look house stand small garden stop 
10,"“Look, Selina,” she said, “I think that must be Woodlands, had we not better ask some one if it is?”",look say think ask one 
11,"A countryman came up to them at that moment, walking very quickly, and was about to pass on before. Leila ran forward.",countryman come moment walk about pass run 
12,"“Pray do stop,” she said, “if you are not very busy, and tell us if that is Woodlands?”",pray stop say busy tell 
13,The man turned back and looked at her with astonishment.,man turn look astonishment 
14,"“Dear heart, young lady, but you must be a stranger in these parts--that Woodlands, _that_? It would be but a humble post indeed to open the park gates to them good people, a very decent family too, I mean to say nothing disrespectful, but Woodlands, bless your heart, Woodlands is one of the _principalest_ houses in the whole countryside. Do you see that beautiful great house standing on the height there, with the broad terrace and the pleasure-grounds sloping down to the river, and them grand woods on each side, shutting out the summer’s sun and the winter’s blasts?--_that’s_ Woodlands, and it’s not every day you will see its like; but you are pleasant-looking young ladies to my mind, and if you have a fancy to see Woodlands, though it’s not to every one I would say as much, I have no objections to unlock the gates for you, for once and away.”",dear heart young lady stranger part humble post open park gate good person decent family mean say disrespectful bless heart _principalest_ house whole countryside see beautiful great house stand height broad terrace pleasure grounds slope river grand wood side shut summer sun winter blast day see pleasant look young lady mind have fancy see one say much have objection unlock gate 
15,"“And are the gates always locked?” Leila timidly inquired; then added, “papa told us to go there.”",gate lock inquire add papa tell go 
16,"“No, no, my young lady; it’s not papas or mammas either that can give that permission. As long as my head’s above ground, there shall no promiscuous company enter there; but never vex your sweet heart,” he continued, more mildly, (observing Leila’s expression of blank dismay,) “never vex your heart; you shall see the place for all that;” then added with a sigh, “but Woodlands has gotten a new master, one Squire Howard, they tell me--a fine man from the Indies. Heaven send he may be a kind one; but they tell queer stories about him too. It was I that showed the two gentlemen that came to settle about it all over the place, and they said something of his having lived in a desert island, a Robinson Crusoe sort of an affair that I could not make out at all; but if we are to have a master from a desert island, I hope he will keep more company about him than his man Friday, or Woodlands will be a changed place.”",young lady papa mammas give permission head ground promiscuous company enter vex sweet heart continue observe expression blank dismay vex heart see place add sigh get new master tell fine man heaven send kind one tell queer story show gentleman come settle place say live desert island sort affair make have master desert island hope keep more company man change place 
17,"“My papa had no man Friday with him in the island,” Leila meekly answered; “but we do not live there now. We came into the world last May, and our man-servant’s name is John; in the island we had only Nurse--look, she is coming up to us now, and she is to be my papa’s housekeeper at Woodlands.”",papa have man island answer live come world last man-servant name island have nurse look come papa housekeeper 
18,"The ruddy face of the countryman became actually pale, as he pulled off his hat, and stood immovable before Leila.",ruddy face countryman become pale pull hat stand immovable 
19,“My master’s daughter; it’s not possible. Surely----”,master daughter possible 
20,"Matilda, who from the moment she had joined them, had continued walking with the others, and had hitherto remained wonderfully silent, could now no longer restrain herself.",moment join continue walk other remain silent restrain 
21,"“You may indeed look surprised,” she said, “for you have made a fine mistake. Yes, it is quite true: you have all this time been speaking to Miss Howard. She is the young mistress of Woodlands. And now will you open the gates?”",look surprise say make fine mistake true have time speak young mistress open gate 
22,"“Don’t, Matilda, pray don’t,” Leila exclaimed in a voice of entreaty; “do you not see how sorry he looks?” then turning with a smile to the poor man, who still remained uncovered before them, “Do put on your hat,” she said; “the sun is hurting your eyes, and you need not be the least sorry for what you have said. I dare say you were told to take care of it; that was just the way Nurse used to watch over every thing in the island, only there we had no gates to lock.”",pray exclaim voice entreaty see sorry look turn smile poor man remain uncover put hat say sun hurt eye least sorry say say tell take care way use watch thing island have gate lock 
23,"In a few minutes longer they had reached the lodge, a pretty small thatched house in the cottage style, with a profusion of China roses and honeysuckles on its white walls. Leila instantly thought how delightfully it would have suited Peggy Dobie, but she did not say so. The gates were no longer shut, they stood most invitingly open; a tidy, pleasant-looking young woman seemed to have been watching for them at the door of the cottage.",few minute reach lodge small thatch house cottage style profusion rose honeysuckle white wall think suit say gate shut stand open tidy pleasant look young woman seem watch door cottage 
24,"“Oh, Bill, Bill,” she exclaimed, “you have been long, and to have been away to-day of all days in the year, and a fine lady and gentleman away up the approach in the carriage, and the squire himself, and a kind, civil-spoken gentleman he seems to be.”",exclaim long day day year fine lady gentleman approach carriage squire kind civil speak gentleman seem 
25,"But the young people were too impatient to listen to further details; the moment they entered the gates they bounded forward. The windings of the approach, though calculated to show the finest trees on the property, they thought much too long, and by the time they reached the house they were breathless with impatience. Mr. Howard, who had been watching them from the window, was at the door to meet them. “Welcome to all of you,” he said, and he stooped down and kissed Leila repeatedly; “welcome to your future home, my Leila; may it be a happy home to you, my dearest child.”",young person impatient listen further detail moment enter gate bound winding approach calculate show fine tree property think time reach house breathless impatience watch window door meet say stoop kiss future home happy home dearest child 
26,"Leila seemed at first quite bewildered; the entrance hall seemed to be so large, the drawing-room larger _still_. The windows of the drawing-room opened on a trellised balcony, festooned with creeping plants, and filled with rare and beautiful flowers; a broad flight of steps, with stone balustrades on each side, and large vases, scarlet pomegranate and pink oleander in full bloom, led from this balcony to the terrace below; and beyond this terrace the velvet turf, interspersed with beds of gay and fragrant flowers, sloped down to the edge of the broad river, on which many little boats were gliding up and down; happily no steamboat being in sight on this first-favoured moment.",seem first bewilder entrance hall seem large draw room large _still_ window draw room open trellised balcony festoon creep plant fill rare beautiful flower broad flight step stone balustrade side large vase scarlet pomegranate pink oleander full bloom lead balcony terrace terrace velvet turf intersperse bed gay fragrant flower slope edge broad river many little boat glide steamboat sight first favour moment 
27,"All were loud in their expressions of admiration; they had never seen any thing more beautiful; but though Leila admired, she seemed still bewildered, and almost more oppressed than pleased.",loud expression admiration see thing beautiful admire seem bewilder oppress pleased 
28,“It is very beautiful; but how shall I ever be able to manage such a house as this?”,beautiful able manage house 
29,"Selina whispered, “Don’t distress yourself, Leila, it is not till you are grown up that you will have to manage; your papa will do it now, and my mamma will help him.”",whisper distress grow have manage papa do mamma help 
30,"Leila brightened a little, but still looked anxiously around the room: “Surely it is very large,” she said.",brighten little look room large say 
31,"It was Matilda’s observation, “Young mistress of Woodlands,” that had done all this; poor Leila was weighed down to the ground with a sudden sense of her responsibilities; to common observers she was a simple child, young, even for her years; but there was often a deep under-current of thought about her, to be discovered only in the changes of her expressive countenance, and in the hesitating, varied tones of her voice.",observation young mistress do poor weigh ground sudden sense responsibility common observer simple child young year be deep current thought discover change expressive countenance hesitate varied tone voice 
32,"Mr. Howard understood her: “We will manage all for you very nicely,” he said; “so, my dear Leila, do not be afraid; and this room will not look so large when it is furnished, and we have sofas, and chairs, and large tables, and little tables, and all sorts of pretty things in it; and it certainly will not be too large if we succeed in having all the kind friends around us at Christmas whom I hope we shall have. Your aunt, uncle, and cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Herbert, and Maria, and perhaps the Selbys, with Louisa, who knows?”",understand manage say dear afraid room look large furnish have sofa chair large table little table sort pretty thing large succeed have kind friend hope have aunt uncle cousin know 
33,"Leila, from the moment of entering the house, had been working herself up, and struggling against comfort; but comfort, in the shape of such a Christmas party as this, who could resist? She quickly gave herself up to all its happy influences, and when her papa led her into the adjoining breakfast-room, which was small, and leading into a spacious conservatory, she was in ecstasies.",moment enter house work struggle comfort comfort shape party resist give happy influence papa lead adjoin breakfast room small lead spacious conservatory ecstasie 
34,"“My birds, my birds,” she exclaimed, “my turtle-doves, my parrots, how they will enjoy it. They will think this more beautiful than their green parlour.”",bird bird exclaim turtle dove parrot enjoy think beautiful green parlour 
35,"All was sunshine to her again; it was a moment of exquisite happiness, such happiness as is only to be felt in very early life, before the sad memories of the past, “and the shadows of coming evils, have dimmed its brightness.”",sunshine moment exquisite happiness such happiness feel early life sad memory past shadow come evil dimm brightness 
36,"The young people returned home in high spirits; Leila forgetting every care in the remembrance of the beautiful conservatory, and in the anticipation of the enjoyment of her birds in taking possession of it; and Matilda far too much excited to allow any of them to rest, even for a moment.",young person return high spirit forget care remembrance beautiful conservatory anticipation enjoyment bird take possession excited allow rest moment 
37,"“Come,” she said, “we will act a play now;” and flying into the passage, she seized her papa’s hat, placed it on one side on her head, tied over her dress a green linen pinafore of Alfred’s to imitate a blouse, and returning into the room, “Now,” she said, “I will be Bill; you, Cousin Leila, are to be talking very gravely with Selina, consulting her how you are to order the dinner at Woodlands when I come up to you; and you, Alfred, are to be the pit, and stamp with your feet, and call out very loud.”",come say act play fly passage seize papa hat place side head tie dress green linen pinafore imitate blouse return room say talk consult order dinner come pit stamp foot call 
38,"“But why,” Leila exclaimed, “should poor Alfred be in the pit? I don’t like that, it puts me in mind of such melancholy things,--Joseph and his wicked brothers, you know,--and he called out and they would not listen; and the cruel thing we did ourselves; we put the poor goats into the pit; but papa said that was a necessary evil.”",exclaim poor pit like put mind such melancholy thing wicked brother know call listen cruel thing do put poor goat pit say necessary evil 
39,"Matilda laughed: “You are so odd,” she said; “it is not that sort of a pit at all. I never saw it myself, but Lydia told me about it,--it is a place where all the gentlemen sit in rows to see the play, and they stamp very loud with their feet, and call out encore; encore means--say it again; don’t forget that, Alfred.”",laugh odd say sort pit see tell place gentleman sit row see play stamp foot call encore encore mean say forget 
40,"Leila was quite relieved and satisfied, and the play proceeded; and so admirably did Matilda imitate Bill’s voice and manner, and so complete was the picture when she drew off the hat, and stood with a face of mute dismay before them, that Selina and Leila were convulsed with laughter; as to little Alfred, he stamped so loud, and called _encore_ so often, that even Matilda, with all her love of amusement, was fairly exhausted.",relieved satisfied play proceed imitate voice manner complete picture draw hat stand face mute dismay convulse laughter little stamp call love amusement exhausted 
41,"“Now,” she said, “we have had enough of this; let us play at Nurse’s play now, let us play at being rational beings, and sit down quietly to our work; now there’s a proposal for you, Selina, what do you say to that? I am going to turn over an entirely new leaf, and I will begin with putting back this hat into its right place, and folding up this crumpled pinafore so very nicely that Nurse will say it is fresh out of the fold. Now it is all done, and I declare you have got out your work already; well, here is mine, and we can sit down comfortably and converse about our future lives.”",say have enough let play play let play rational being sit work be proposal say go turn new leaf begin put hat right place fold crumple pinafore say fresh fold do declare get work sit converse future life 
42,"“Yes,” Leila said, “that will be a delightful subject.”",say delightful subject 
43,"“I don’t know that,” Matilda replied; “you are forgetting about the governess; she is to be here very soon, if she can come. Mamma wrote to her this morning; she bid me hold the taper when she was sealing the letter, and I could not help thinking how nice it would be if I could give a little push and set the letter on fire.”",know reply forget governess come write morning bid hold taper seal letter help think nice give little push set letter fire 
44,"“Oh, Matilda,” Selina exclaimed, “how sorry you make me; why do you talk in this way and why should your future life not be happy because we are to have a governess to save mamma trouble; you know she is not very strong, and she is not able to manage us herself.”",exclaim sorry make talk way future life happy have governess save mamma trouble know strong able manage 
45,"“To manage _me_, you should say, Selina; but how can my future life be happy, when she will be for ever finding fault with me?”",manage say future life happy find fault 
46,"“But why do you think so? It is quite in your own power to go on happily with her; she will not find fault with you unless you deserve it, and surely you would not wish to grow up in your faults; you could not have a happy future life if you are not good, for you have a conscience, Matilda, and after a little you are always sorry when you do wrong.”",think own power go find fault deserve wish grow fault have happy future life good have conscience little sorry do wrong 
47,"“I am, Selina; you know me very well; but then I am so often bad, and so often sorry, that there is no great happiness about my life after all, even though I have not a governess. Well, we shall see if she makes this great change.”",know bad sorry be great happiness life have governess see make great change 
48,"“She cannot make the _change_, Matilda, she can only tell you what is right; and you cannot do it either, of yourself. You must pray for the Spirit of God to come into your heart, and to make you really sorry for your faults, and really anxious to do what is right.”",make _change_ tell right do pray come heart make sorry fault anxious do right 
49,"“But I am really anxious,” Matilda answered; “and I am always wishing I could be as good as you are.”",anxious answer wish good

51,"“Oh, if _you_ are not good, and you expect me to be better than you are, it is a bad business! I need not try.”",good expect good bad business try 
52,"“Why do you talk in that way? You do not know all the foolish things I think of and wish to do; but remember, Matilda, the lesson I have had, and the great blessing God has given me. Before I had made up my mind to be always dumb, I used often to pray to Him, and promise that if He would open my lips, I would try to be more and more His child, and praise Him with my life as well as with my heart; and when I read of Jesus Christ opening the eyes of the blind, and making the dumb to speak, I used to have such deep sorrow, that sometimes I could scarcely bear it; I used to shut myself up alone and say to myself, Why did I not live then? Surely if I had asked Him myself, and He had seen my sorrow, He would have listened. Oh, it was a sinful thought.”",talk way know foolish thing think wish do remember lesson have great blessing give make mind dumb use pray promise open lip try more child praise life heart read open eye blind make dumb speak use have such deep sorrow bear use shut say live ask see sorrow listen sinful thought 
53,“But why was it sinful?” Matilda asked.,sinful ask 
54,"“It was sinful, because it was doubting His wisdom, for He knew what was best for me; it was also doubting his power, for in heaven He equally hears our prayers and sees our sorrows; and the miracles He worked on earth are not greater than those which are every where around us. The spring and summer coming again, and bringing up the flowers, and making the dead earth so green and beautiful, are miracles of His power; and the very miracle I asked for was granted--granted in a moment--my lips were opened; from that time I made my resolution----” She stopped and coloured.",sinful doub wisdom know good doub power heaven hear prayer see sorrow miracle work earth great spring summer come bring flower make dead earth green beautiful miracle power very miracle ask grant grant moment lip open time make resolution stop coloured 
55,“What resolution?” Matilda eagerly asked.,resolution ask

57,"“And so this is the reason,” Matilda said, “why you go away in the forenoon and lock your door. I never could find out what you were doing; once I thought I would look through the keyhole, and I went on tip-toe, but then I remembered mamma saying that was a mean, low habit, and I did not. But you do another thing, Selina, which you never used to do before; in the morning, after you have read the Bible, you turn over and over the pages, as if you were looking for something. What are you doing then, for you cannot be reading?”",reason say go forenoon lock door find do think look keyhole go tip toe remember mamma say mean low habit do thing use do morning read turn page look do read

60,"Selina looked distressed, and coloured. “I believe I was wrong, but I always feel ashamed to talk on those subjects before any one; I fear it is a false shame.”",look distressed coloured believe wrong feel ashamed talk subject one fear false shame 
61,"“No, Selina, no,” Leila said quickly: “my papa explained to me about that; to be sure, to Matilda or to me you might have said it, for he told me that with a very dear friend it was a delightful subject, but that in the world I must not talk about God as I used to do in the island; I must try to think of Him constantly just the same, and always ask myself how He would wish me to act, but I must not say so before indifferent people (that means worldly people). He says before worldly people it may do harm, for their minds may not be in a good frame at the moment, and it might make them worse, and might make them turn away; and even before good people I should not talk in this way, for good people may be shocked, and think it too sacred a subject to be talked of before many; but, Selina, I would like to do all that you have been telling me you do; I would like to find out texts also, and try to keep them in my mind, for it is not so easy to be good here as in the island, so many new things come into my mind here.
