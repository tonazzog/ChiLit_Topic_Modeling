2," ""What's these, what's these?"" he muttered, for there, on the farther bank of the stream, stood in the twilight of the sinking moon two strange, solitary figures, motionless, staring. Nod ran to Battle, and laid his long narrow hand on the glimmering gun-barrel. ""Oh, not shoot, not shoot!"" he said, ""black Oomgars--no; Mulla-mulgars, too, Nod's friends, Nod's brothers!""",mutter far bank stream stand twilight sink moon strange solitary figure motionless stare run lay long narrow hand glimmer gun -barrel shoot shoot say black mulgar friend brother 
3,"""What's he jabbering about?"" said Battle, with eyes fixed brightly on the two gaunt shapes.",jabber say eye fix gaunt shape 
4,"""Nod's brothers, there,"" said Nod--""Thumb, Thimble, Thimble, Thumb. Nod show Oomgar. Oh, wait softly!"" He ran swiftly over the snow till he came to the frozen bank of the stream. But still his brothers never stirred, ragged and hollow-eyed with hunger and cold.",nod brother say show wait run snow come freeze bank stream brother stirr ragged hollow eyed hunger cold 
5,"""Come,"" said Nod, lifting up his hands in salutation; ""there is no fear, no danger! Here is Nod, my brothers.""",come say lift hand salutation be fear danger brother 
6,"""What voice was that we heard?"" said Thumb, trembling. ""Can the mouth of the Oomgar speak after it is shut in death?""",voice hear say tremble mouth speak shut death 
7,"""The Oomgar is not dead, Thumb, my brother; the hunting-packs killed only that Beast of Shadows, Immanâla, who hoped to kill us all, and the Oomgar, too. Come over, my brothers! Every day, every night, Nod has talked in his quiet with you.""",dead brother hunting pack kill hope kill come brother day night talk quiet 
8,"""We do not understand the little Oomgar,"" said Thimble angrily. ""Who are you, the youngest of us all, to lie and make cunning against the people of the forest? Let your master, the blood-spilling Oomgar, shoot us, too. What are we in such a heap of bones? We have no fear of him. On all fours, back, parakeet; tell him where the Mulgars' hearts lie hid. Maybe he'll fling his Nizza-neela a bone.""",understand little say young lie make cunn person forest let master blood spill shoot heap bone have fear four parakeet tell heart lie hide fling bone 
9,"""O Thimble, Mulla-mulgar, why do you seek out all the black words for me? Haven't I done all for the best? Did I play false with you when I saved you from the spits of the Minimuls? The little Horse of Tishnar smelt out my wounded shoulder. And the Oomgar's strangling trap caught me. But he did not kill me. He took me, and was kind to me, fed me and shared his fire with me, and we were 'messimuts.' Yet all day, all night, moon and no-moon, I have talked in myself with you, and run looking for you in my dreams, while I slept in the hairless Oomgar's hut. The Nameless is gone for a little while. The Oomgar is wise with his hands and in little things. Now I may go. He kills only for meat, Mulla-mulgars. He will do no harm to Ummanodda's brothers. Come over with me!""",seek black word do good play false save spit little smell wound shoulder strangle trap catch kill take kind feed share fire messimut day night moon moon talk run look dream sleep hairless hut nameless gone little while wise hand little thing go kill meat mulgar do harm brother come 
10,"Thumb and Thimble, with toes a little turned in, and heads bent forward, stood listening in the snow.",toe little turn head bend stand listen snow 
11,"""Why, then,"" said Thumb, muttering, ""if he kills only for food, and relishes not his own flavour in the pot, let him hobble out here to us now and greet us, like with like--Oomgar-mulgar with Mulla-mulgar--and leave his spit-fire and his magic behind him. But into his hut, nor stumbling among his Munza bones, we will _not_ go. And if he will not come, brother to brother, then it is 'Gar Mulgar dusangee' between us three, O youngest son of Seelem. Go back to your cooking-pots. I and Thimble will journey on alone. All day would the Harp-strings be twangling over Mulgars smelling of blood.""",say mutter kill food relish own flavour pot let hobble greet mulgar mulgar leave spit fire magic hut stumble bone go come brother brother young son go cooking pot journey day string twangle smelling blood 
12,"So Nod, cold with misery, went back to Battle, who sat yawning, gun on knee, beside his fire.",cold misery go sit yawn gun knee fire 
13,"""Oomgar!"" he said, leaning a little on one small hand, and standing a few paces distant from the sailor, ""my brothers, the Mulla-mulgars, sons of Seelem, brother of Assasimmon, Prince of the Valleys of Tishnar, are here. They say Nod is not true, speaks lies, eater-of-flesh, no child of Tishnar."" He stared forlornly into Battle's face. ""Tired of his living is Nod now. Shoot straight with Oomgar Zbaffle's gun. Nod will be still.""",say lean little small hand stand few pace distant sailor brother mulgar son brother say nod true speak lie eater flesh child stare face tired living shoot gun nod 
14,"The Englishman crinkled up his eyelids, opened his mouth, and burst out laughing.",englishman crinkle eyelid open mouth burst laugh 
15,"""To tell ye sober truth, my son,"" he said, ""bullets and powder Battle haven't much left to waste. And what's lark-pie to a hungry sailor! As for them hunched-up hobbagoblins over yonder, don't 'ee heed what envy has to say. Battle is hands down on your side, my son, and let 'em meddle if they dare! But mercy on us,"" he added under his breath, ""what wouldn't my old mother have said to hear these Pongoes chatter? 'Shoot straight!' says he. 'Tired of his living!' says he. Button up your sheep's-jacket, my son. We'll home to England yet. And, what's more""--he waved his hand towards the lonely figures still standing motionless in the silvery dusk--""Andy Battle's best respects to the hairy gentlemen, and there's a warm welcome and fresh-picked bones for breakfast. But the night's creeping cold, and bed's bed, old friend, and Andy's eyes was never made for moth-hunting. So here goes."" He went in with his gun, and Nod heard him shut and bar the door.",tell sober truth son say bullet powder leave waste lark pie hungry sailor hunch hobbagoblin yonder heed envy have say battle hand side son let meddle dare mercy add breath old mother say hear chatter shoot straight say tired living say button sheep jacket son home wave hand lonely figure stand motionless silvery dusk good respect hairy gentleman be warm welcome fresh pick bone breakfast night creep cold bed bed old friend eye make moth hunting go go gun hear shut bar door 
16,"Nod listened awhile, with eyes fixed sorrowfully on the fast-shut door; then, having heaped more logs on to the fire, he went slowly back to his brothers.",nod listen eye fix fast shut door heap more log fire go brother 
17,"Now that the moon was down, and night at its darkest, the frost hardened. And Thumb and Thimble, when they were sure the Oomgar was asleep in his hut, were glad enough to hobble across the ice and to sit and warm themselves before the fire. Their jackets hung in tatters. Thumb's left second toe was frost-bitten, and Thimble's eyes were so sore from the glaring whiteness of the snow he could only dimly see. Moreover, they were weary of living and sleeping in their tree-houses among the scatter-brained Forest-mulgars, and though at first they sat shaky and sniffing, and started if but a dry leaf snapped in the fire, they listened in silence to Nod's long story of his doings, and began to see at last that what he had done by Mishcha's counsel had been for the best, and not for his own sake only.",moon night dark frost harden sure asleep hut glad hobble ice sit warm fire jacket hang tatter left second toe frost bit eye sore glaring whiteness snow see weary live sleep tree house scatter brain forest mulgar first sit shaky sniff start dry leaf snap fire listen silence long story doing begin see last do counsel good own sake 
18,"""But we cannot stay here, Ummanodda,"" said Thumb. ""We could not rub noses with the Oomgar. His voice, his smell! He is not of our kind, little brother. And now that all the peoples of Munza-mulgar are our enemies, we must press on, with no more idling and fine eating and sitting shanks to fire, or we shall never reach the Valleys alive.""",stay say rub nose voice smell kind little brother people mulgar enemy press more idling fine eating sit shank fire reach alive 
19,"""I am ready, Thumb, my brother,"" Nod answered. ""The Oomgar has been kind to me, his own kind's kind. It was my Tishnar's Wonderstone that saved him from the teeth of the Nine-and-ninety, and from Immanâla's magic, though why should I tell it is so? Now they will think it is his skin-bonneted Meermut that stalks to and fro with the ghost-gun of a ghost. They will forsake this place, every one--claw and talon, upright and fours, every one. How long shall a flesh-eater, hungry and gluttonous, live on dried berries and nuts? Me gone; unless the frost flies soon, or a great Bobberie, as he does say, comes up from that strange water, the Sea, over yonder, the Oomgar will die. O brothers, just as that Oomgar, the Portingal, died whose bones dangled over us when we stood by Mutta's knee and listened to them clicking. Do but let me stay to say good-bye, and we will go together at morning!""",ready brother answer kind own kind kind save tooth magic tell think skin bonnet stalk for ghost gun ghost forsake place one claw talon upright four one flesh eater hungry gluttonous live dry berries nut gone frost fly great say come strange water die brother die bone dangle stand knee listen click let stay say good bye go morning 
20,"So, when day began to break, Thumb and Thimble hastened away and hid themselves in the Ukka-trees till Nod should come out to them. Nod busied himself, and baked his last feast with his master. He broiled him some bones--they were little else--of the Jack-All the sailor had shot in the moonlight. And when Battle--strange and solitary as he seemed to Nod now, after talking with and looking on his brothers--when Battle opened the door and came out, Nod told him as best he could, in the few words of his English, of Immanâla and her hunting-dogs, and of his brothers. And he told him that he must leave him now, and go on his travels again. Battle listened, scratching his head, and with a patient, perplexed grin on his face, but he could understand only very little of what Nod meant. For even a Mulla-mulgar, though he can repeat like a child, or like a parrot, by rote, has small brains for really learning another language, so that it may be a telling picture of his thoughts. Indeed, Battle thought that poor Nod had fallen a little crazy with the cold. He fondled him and scratched his head--this Prince of Tishnar--as if he were at his hearth at home, and Nod his country cat. But at least he knew that the little Mulgar wished to leave him, and he made no hindrance except his own sadness to his going. He gave him out of his own pocket a silver groat with a hole in it, and a large piece of fine looking-glass, besides the necklet of clear blue Bamba-beads, and three rings of copper. He gave him, too, one leaf of his little fat book, and in this Nod wrapped his Wonderstone. Nor even in his kindness did Battle say the least word about his big coat and Ephelanto-belt and his Fulby's hairy hat--all which things he supposed (Mulgars being by nature thieves and robbers in his mind) Nod's brothers had stolen.",day begin break hasten hide tree nod come busy bake last feast master broil bone little else sailor shoot moonlight strange solitary seem talk look brother open door come tell good few word hunting dog brother tell leave go travel battle listen scratch head patient perplex grin face understand little mean mulgar repeat child parrot rote have small brain learn language tell picture thought think poor fall little crazy cold fondle scratch head hearth home country cat least know little wish leave make hindrance own sadness go give own pocket silver groat hole large piece fine look glass necklet clear blue bead ring copper give leaf little fat book wrap kindness say least word big coat belt hairy hat thing suppose nature thief robber mind brother steal 
21,"""Good-bye, my son,"" he said. ""'Bravely, ole sailor, take your lot!' There, there; I make no dwelling on fine words. Good-bye, and don't forget your larnin'. There's many a full-growed Christian Battle's come acrost in his seafarin'--but there, flattery butters no parsnips. Good-bye, once more, Mulgar _mio_, and thankee kindly.""",good son say sailor take lot make dwelling fine word good forget larnin be many full growed christian come seafarin flattery butter parsnip good more thankee 
22,"Nod raised his hands above his head. ""Oomgar, Oomgar,"" he said, with eyes shut and trembling lips, ""ah-mi, ah-mi; sulâni, ghar magleer."" Then, with a heavy heart, he turned away, and without looking back ran scampering as fast as he could to the five Ukka-trees. His brothers had long been awaiting him, and swang down gladly from their sleeping-bowers in the trees. Then, with the hut and the Oomgar's pillar of smoke upon their cudgel-hand, they set out once more, all but due North, towards the Valleys of Assasimmon.",raise hand head say eye shut tremble lip heavy heart turn look run scamper tree brother await swang sleeping bower tree hut pillar smoke cudgel hand set more due
