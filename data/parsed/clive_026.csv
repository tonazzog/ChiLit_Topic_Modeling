1,CHAPTER 25. Besieged In A Pagoda.,besiege pagoda 
2," A few days later Charlie received a message from the Rajah of Permacoil, saying that he was besieged by a strong native force, aided by the French. He at once moved his force to his assistance. He found that the besiegers, among whom were two hundred French troops, were too strong to be attacked. He therefore established himself in their rear, attacked and captured convoys, and prevented the country people from bringing in provisions. Several times the besieging infantry advanced against him, but before these he at once fell back, only to return as soon as they retired to their camp. Whenever their horse ventured out against him, he beat them back, with considerable loss.",few day receive message say besiege strong native force aid move force assistance find besieger french troops strong attack establish rear attack capture convoy prevent country person bring provision several time besieging infantry advance fall return retire camp horse venture beat considerable loss 
3,"Ten days after his arrival, the enemy, finding it impossible to maintain themselves in the face of so active an enemy, and suffering greatly from want of provisions, raised the siege and fell back.",day arrival enemy find impossible maintain face active enemy suffer want provision raise siege fall 
4,"As soon as they had drawn off, Charlie entered the fort. The rajah received him with the greatest warmth. He was, however, much distressed at the capture of a hill fort, at some distance from Permacoil. In this he had stowed his wives and treasure, thinking that it would be unmolested. The French, however, had, just before Charlie's arrival, detached a strong force with some guns, and these had captured the place. The force which had accomplished this had, he now heard, marched to Trinavody, a fort and town thirty miles away, upon the road by which the force which had besieged the town was retiring. The treasure was a considerable one, amounting to seven lacs of rupees, and as the rajah stated his willingness that the troops should take possession of this, if they could but rescue his women, Charlie at once determined to attempt the feat.",draw enter fort receive great warmth distress capture hill fort distance stow wife treasure think unmolested french arrival detach strong force gun capture place force accomplish hear march fort town mile road force besiege town retire treasure considerable one amount lac rupee state willingness troops take possession rescue woman determined attempt feat 
5,"The main body of the enemy would not reach the place, until the afternoon of the following day. Charlie soon collected his men and, making a detour through the country, arrived next morning within a mile of Trinavody.",main body enemy reach place afternoon follow day collect man make detour country arrive next morning mile 
6,"The town was a small one, and the fort one of the ordinary native forts, built in a parallelogram with flanking towers. The place, however, contained a very large and solidly built pagoda or temple. It was surrounded by a wall, forty feet high; and at the gateway stood an immense tower, with terraces rising one above the other.",town small one fort ordinary native fort build parallelogram flank tower place contain large build pagoda temple surround wall foot high gateway stand immense tower terrace rise other 
7,"Capturing a native, Charlie learnt that the fort was tenanted only by the troops of the native rajah of the place, the French detachment being encamped in the pagoda. He at once rode forward with his troops, dashed through the native town, and in through the wide gateway of the tower, into the courtyard within. Beyond two or three straggling shots from the sentries, he had so far encountered no opposition, and the native troops in the courtyard, thrown into wild confusion by this sudden appearance of a hostile force, threw down their arms and cried for mercy. From the temple within, however, the French infantry, a hundred strong, opened a brisk fire.",capture native learn fort tenant troops native rajah place french detachment encamp pagoda ride troops dash native town wide gateway tower courtyard straggle shot sentry encounter opposition native troops courtyard throw wild confusion sudden appearance hostile force throw arm cry mercy temple french infantry strong open brisk fire 
8,"Charlie sent some of his men on to the tower, whence their fire commanded the flat roof of the temple, and these speedily drove the defenders from that post. The field pieces were unlimbered, and directed towards the gate of the inner temple, while a musketry fire was kept up against every window and loophole in the building. The gate gave way after a few shots had been fired, and Charlie led his party to the assault.",send man tower fire command flat roof temple drive defender post field piece unlimber direct gate inner temple musketry fire keep window loophole building gate give way few shot fire lead party assault 
9,"The French defended themselves bravely, but they were outnumbered and were driven, fighting, from room to room, until the survivors laid down their arms. The assault, however, had cost the British a loss of twenty-five men.",defend outnumber drive fight room room survivor lay arm assault cost british loss man 
10,"The Rajah of Permacoil's treasure, and his women, fell into the hands of the captors. Charlie ordered the chests to be brought down, and placed in bullock waggons. Just as he was about to order his men, who were scattered through the temple looting, to form up, he heard a shout from the tower; and, looking up, saw one of his men there gesticulating wildly. He ran up the tower, and on reaching the first terrace saw, to his surprise, the whole of the force which he believed to be fifteen miles distant, already entering the town.",treasure woman fall hand captor order chest bring place bullock waggon about order man scatter temple looting form hear shout tower look see man gesticulate run tower reach first terrace see surprise whole force believe mile distant enter town 
11,"The French officer in command, knowing the activity and dash of his opponent, and fearing that an attempt might be made to carry Trinavody and recapture the rajah's treasure, had marched all night. When within a mile of the place, he heard what had happened, and at once pushed forward.",french officer command know activity dash opponent fear attempt make carry recapture treasure march night mile place hear happen push 
12,"Charlie saw that, already, his retreat was cut off; and, running to the edge of the terrace, shouted to Peters to hurry out with all the men already in the courtyard, to occupy the houses outside the gate, and to keep back the advancing enemy. Summoning another party to the tower, four guns upon the terrace were at once loaded, and these opened upon the head of the enemy's column, as they entered the street leading to the temple.",see retreat cut run edge terrace shout hurry man courtyard occupy house gate keep advance enemy summon party tower gun terrace load open head enemy column enter street lead temple 
13,"In a short time, a brisk fight began. The enemy planted guns to bear upon the tower. The cannon of the fort joined in the assault, the infantry pressed forward through the houses and inclosures to the temple, and were soon engaged with the men under Captain Peters, while the guns and musketry from the tower also opened upon them.",short time brisk fight begin enemy plant gun bear tower can non fort join assault infantry press house inclosure temple engage man gun musketry tower open 
14,"Having seen that the preparations to repulse an immediate attack were complete, Charlie again ran down to the courtyard. The weak point of the defences was the gateway. This was fifty feet wide, and unprovided with gates; and Charlie at once set a strong party to work, to form a barricade across it.",see preparation repulse immediate attack complete run courtyard weak point defence gateway foot wide unprovide gate set strong party work form barricade 
15,"For some hours, the party outside the gates maintained their position, but they were gradually driven back; and towards evening, by Charlie's orders, they retired within the temple. The barricade was now eight feet high. The face was formed of large slabs of stone, piled one upon another, backed by a considerable thickness of earthwork. This, however, although capable of resisting a sudden rush of infantry, would, Charlie knew, be incapable of resisting artillery.",hour party gate maintain position drive evening order retire temple barricade foot high face form large slab stone pile back considerable thickness earthwork capable resist sudden rush infantry know incapable resist artillery 
16,"During the night, he divided his men in two parties, which alternately slept and worked at the inner defences which he had designed. These consisted of two walls, running from each side of the gateway to the temple. They were placed a few feet farther back than the edge of the gateway, so that an enemy advancing to the storm would not see them, until within the gate. These walls he intended to be eight feet high; and to be backed with earth, four feet high, so as to form a bank on which the defenders could stand, and fire into the space between them. To obtain materials, he pulled down several buildings forming a part of the temple. The distance from the gateway to the temple was fifty yards, and although the men worked without ceasing, the wall had made but little progress when daylight dawned.",night divide man party sleep work inner defence design consist wall run side gateway temple place few foot edge gateway enemy advance storm see gate wall intend foot high back earth foot high form bank defender stand fire space obtain material pull several building form part temple distance gateway temple yard man work cease wall make little progress daylight dawn 
17,"During the night, Charlie lowered one of his men from the wall farthest from the enemy; with instructions to make his way, as fast as possible, to Madras to ask for succour. In the morning, Charlie found that the enemy had, on their side, been also busy. A house, which faced the end of the street leading to the temple, had been pulled down; and a battery of four guns erected there.",night lower man wall farthest enemy instruction make way possible ask succour morning find enemy side busy house face end street lead temple pull battery gun erect 
18,"As soon as it was light, the combat began. The enemy had sixteen pieces of artillery, besides those on the fort; and while the four guns in front played unceasingly upon the barricade across the gateway, the others cannonaded the tower, whence the English guns kept up a fire on the battery in front. So well were these directed, and so heavy was the musketry, that the enemy's guns were several times silenced, and the artillerymen driven from them.",light combat begin enemy have piece artillery fort gun front play barricade gateway other cannonade tower english gun keep fire battery front direct heavy musketry enemy gun several time silence artillerymen drive 
19,"Behind the barricade, a working party threw up fresh earth, to strengthen the part most shaken by the enemy's fire, and then set to work to form a similar barricade, in a line with the back of the gateway. This was completed by nightfall, by which time the enemy's guns had completely shattered the stone facing of the outer barricade, rendering it possible for it to be carried with a rush. As, from the windows of the houses, they could see the new work behind it; they would, Charlie judged, not attempt an assault, until this also was destroyed.",barricade working party throw fresh earth strengthen part shake enemy fire set work form similar barricade line back gateway complete nightfall time enemy gun shattered stone face outer barricade rendering possible carry rush window house see new work judge attempt assault destroy 
20,"During the night, large quantities of fresh earth were piled on the outer barricade, which was now useful as forming a screen to that behind it from the guns. All night the work at the parallel walls continued, and by morning these had reached a height of three feet.",night large quantity fresh earth pile outer barricade useful form screen gun night work parallel wall continue morning reach height foot 
21,"During the next two days the fight continued, without much advantage on either side. Each day the enemy's guns shattered the outer barricade, but this was as regularly repaired at night, in spite of the heavy artillery and matchlock fire which they kept up towards the spot.",next day fight continue much advantage side day enemy gun shattered outer barricade repair night spite heavy artillery matchlock fire keep spot 
22,"On the fourth day the enemy pulled down a house, standing just in the rear of their battery, and Charlie found that behind it they had erected another. It was a solidly built work, of fifteen feet in height, and the enemy must have laboured continuously at it, every night. It had a strong and high parapet, of sandbags, protecting the gunners from the musketry fire of the tower. The muzzles of four guns projected through embrasures, which had been left for them, and these opened fire over the heads of the gunners in the lower battery.",fourth day enemy pull house stand rear battery find erect build work foot height enemy laboure night have strong high parapet sandbag protect gunner musketry fire tower muzzle gun project embrasure leave open fire head gunner low battery 
23,"In spite of the efforts of the besieged, the enemy kept up so heavy a fire that, by the afternoon, the inner as well as the outer barricade was knocked to pieces. By this time, however, the inner walls were completed, and the English awaited the storm with confidence. The doorway of the temple had been closed, and blocked up behind; but the doors had been shattered to pieces, by the shot which had passed through the gateway, and the entrance now stood open.",spite effort besiege enemy keep heavy fire afternoon inner outer barricade knock piece time inner wall complete await storm confidence doorway temple close block door shattered piece shot pass gateway entrance stand open 
24,"Inside the temple, out of the line of fire, Charlie had the two little field pieces, each crammed to the muzzle with bullets, placed in readiness to fire. The lower floor of the tower had been pierced, above the gateway, and here two huge caldrons filled with boiling lead, stripped from the roof, stood ready for action.",temple line fire have little field piece cramm muzzle bullet place readiness fire low floor tower pierce gateway huge caldron fill boil lead stripp roof stand ready action 
25,"At three in the afternoon, after a furious cannonade, the fire of the enemy's battery suddenly ceased. They had formed communications between the houses, on either side of the street; and, at the signal, the troops poured out from these in large bodies, and rushed to the assault.",afternoon furious cannonade fire enemy battery cease form communication house side street signal troops pour large body rush assault 
26,"The guns from the tower, which had been awaiting the moment, poured showers of grape among them; but, believing that the temple now lay at their mercy, the enemy did not hesitate, but rushed at the gateway.",gun tower await moment pour shower grape believe temple lay mercy enemy hesitate rush gateway 
27,"Not a shot was fired, as they entered. Scrambling over the remains of the two barricades, the enemy poured with exulting shouts into the courtyard. Then those in front hesitated. On either hand, as far as the doorway of the temple, extended a massive wall, eight feet high; roughly built, certainly, but far too strong to be battered down, too steep to be scaled. They would have retreated, but they were driven forward by the mass which poured in through the gateway behind them; and, seeing that their only safety was in victory, they pressed forward again.",shot fire enter scramble remains barricade enemy pour exult shout courtyard front hesitate hand doorway temple extend massive wall foot high build strong batter steep scal retreat drive mass pour gateway see only safety victory press 
28,"Not a defender showed himself, until the head of the column had reached a point two-thirds of the distance across the courtyard. Then suddenly, on either side, the wall was lined by the British, who at once opened a tremendous fire on the mass below. At the same moment, the guns were run into the doorway, and poured their contents into the struggling mass.",defender show head column reach point third distance courtyard side wall line open tremendous fire mass same moment gun run doorway pour content struggle mass 
29,"Pent up between the walls, unable to return the fire poured down upon them, with lanes torn through them by the discharge of the cannon, the greater portion of the mass strove to turn and retire. The officer in command, a gallant Frenchman, called upon the survivors of the fifty French infantry, who had led the attack, to follow him; and rushed forward upon the guns. Here, however, Charlie had posted his Europeans, and these, swarming out from the temple, poured a volley into the advancing French, and then charged them with the bayonet.",pend wall unable return fire pour lane tear discharge cannon great portion mass strive turn retire officer command gallant call survivor french infantry lead attack follow rush gun post swarm temple pour volley advance charge bayonet 
30,"The pressure from behind had now ceased. Streams of boiling lead, poured through the holes above the archway, had effectually checked the advance; and through this molten shower, the shattered remnants of the assaulting column now fled for their lives, leaving two hundred and fifty of their best men dead behind them.",pressure cease stream boil lead pour hole archway check advance molten shower shattered remnant assault column flead life leave good man dead 
31,"As the last of the column issued out, the guns of the battery again angrily opened fire. As Charlie had anticipated, the enemy, finding how strong were the inner defences, abandoned all further idea of attack by the gateway; and, leaving only two guns there to prevent a sortie, placed their whole artillery on the western side of the pagoda, and opened fire to prepare a breach there.",last column issue gun battery open fire anticipate enemy find strong inner defence abandon further idea attack gateway leave gun prevent sortie place whole artillery western side pagoda open fire prepare breach 
32,"For a week the siege continued, and then Charlie determined to evacuate the place. The rajah's treasure was made up into small sacks, which were fastened to the horses' croups. Had it not been for these animals, he would have defended the place to the last, confident in his power to devise fresh means to repel fresh assaults. The store of forage, however, collected by the enemy for their own use in the temple, was now exhausted. Charlie directed Peters, with twenty men, to sally out from the gate at midnight, to enter the nearest house on the right hand side, and to follow the communications made by the enemy before the assault, until they came to the end of the street. Lieutenant Hallowes, with a similar party, was to take the left side. If they found any guards within the houses, they were to overpower these; and, rushing straight on, to attack the battery, and spike the guns. Should they find the houses deserted, they were to gather in the houses nearest the battery, when Peters was to fire his pistol as a signal to Hallowes, and both parties were to attack the battery.",week siege continue determine evacuate place treasure make small sack fasten horse croup animal defend place last confident power devise fresh means repel fresh assault store forage collect enemy own use temple exhaust direct man sally gate midnight enter near house right hand side follow communication make enemy assault come end street similar party take left side find guard house overpower rush attack battery spike gun find house desert gather house battery fire pistol signal party attack battery 
33,"One of the inner walls had been pulled down, and the main body of the force, having the wounded and the ladies of the rajah's zenana in their centre, were to sally out, the instant the guns were taken.",inner wall pull main body force have wound lady zenana centre sally instant gun take 
34,"The plan was carried out with the greatest success. The houses on both sides of the street were found to be deserted, and as Peters fired his pistol, the party dashed at the flanks of the battery. The French gunners leaped to their feet and, believing that they were attacked in front, discharged their cannon. The grapeshot swept along the empty street, and through the gateway; and Charlie, leading one of the troops, at once dashed down the street.",plan carry great success house side street find desert fire pistol party dash flank battery french gunner leap foot believe attack front discharge cannon grapeshot sweep empty street gateway lead troops dash street 
35,"At their first rush, Peters and Hallowes had carried the battery, cutting down the gunners. Immediately behind, however, the enemy had posted a support, several hundred strong, and these speedily advanced to recover the battery.",first rush carry battery cut gunner enemy post support several strong advance recover battery 
36,"Leaving their horses in charge of a small party, Charlie dismounted his men and joined Peters, and his fire quickly checked the assault. In the meantime, the rest of the defenders of the temple rode down the street and, leaving a few men with the horses of Peters' and Hallowes' detachments, rode out into the open country. After driving back his assailants, Charlie led his party back to their horses, mounted them, and speedily rejoined the main body. An hour later they were well on their way towards Permacoil, which they reached, next day.",leave horse charge small party dismount man join fire check assault meantime rest defender temple ride street leave few man horse detachment ride open country drive assailant lead party horse mount rejoin main body hour way reach next day 
37,"The rajah was delighted at recovering his family. The treasure was divided, and the portion belonging to the troops was, with the Company's share, sent down under a strong escort to Madras.",rajah delight recover family treasure divide portion belong troops company share send strong escort 
38,"For a considerable time, Charlie's force were occupied with small undertakings. Lally had now arrived, from France, and had taken the command. He had, at his orders, a European force considerably exceeding any that had hitherto been gathered in India, and he boasted that he was going to capture Madras, and drive the English out of India. Nothing could have been more unfortunate for the French than the choice of such a man, and his appointment was destined to give the last blow to French influence in India, as the supercession of Dupleix had given the first.",considerable time force occupy small undertaking arrive take command order european force exceed gather boast go capture drive unfortunate french choice man appointment destine give last blow french influence supercession give first 
39,"Monsieur Lally had one virtue. He was personally brave; but he was arrogant, passionate, and jealous. He had no capacity, whatever, for either awing or conciliating those with whom he came in contact. He treated the natives with open contempt, and was soon as much hated, by them, as by his own soldiers.",have virtue brave arrogant passionate jealous have capacity awing conciliate come contact treat native open contempt hate own soldier 
40,"His first step had been to order Bussy down, from Hyderabad, with the whole of his force. Bussy, a man of great genius, of extreme tact, of perfect knowledge of the Indian character; had, for eight years, maintained French influence supreme at that court, and had acquired for France the Northern Sirkars, a splendid and most valuable province, on the seacoast north of Madras. Salabut Jung, the ruler of Hyderabad, the protege of the French, heard with dismay the order which Bussy had received. To Bussy himself, the blow was a heavy one, and he saw that his departure would entail the ruin of the edifice of French influence, which he had built up by so many years of thought and toil.",first step order whole force man great genius extreme tact perfect knowledge indian character year maintain french influence supreme court acquire northern splendid valuable province seacoast north ruler protege hear dismay order receive blow heavy one see departure entail ruin edifice french influence build many year thought toil 
41,"However, he obeyed at once; and marched, with two hundred and fifty Europeans and five hundred native troops, into the Sirkars. He made over the charge of this treaty to the Marquis de Conflans, whom, although but just arrived from Europe, and entirely new to Indian affairs, Count de Lally had sent to replace Monsieur Moracin, who had, for years, ably managed the province. He then marched, with his troops, to join the main army under Count de Lally.",obey march native troops make charge treaty arrive new indian affair send replace year manage province march troops join main army 
42,"This force, having taken Fort Saint David, had operated against Tanjore, where it had suffered a repulse. The news of this reached the Northern Sirkars, soon after the departure of Bussy; and Anandraz, the most powerful chief of the country, rose in rebellion, and sent a messenger to Calcutta, begging the assistance of the English to drive out the French.",force take operate suffer repulse news reach northern departure powerful chief country rise rebellion send messenger begg assistance drive 
43,"While the rest of the Bengal council, seeing that Bengal was, at the time, threatened with invasion from the north, and menaced with troubles within, considered that it would be an act little short of madness to send troops, at a time when they could be so little spared, to assist a chief, who, even from his own accounts, was only able to raise three thousand irregular followers, Clive thought otherwise. He saw the great value of the Northern Sirkars, whose possession would complete the line of British territory, along the seacoast, from Calcutta down to Madras. He saw, too, that a movement here would effect a diversion, in favour of Madras. The situation there appeared very serious, and he could spare no troops which would suffice to turn the scale. But even should Madras be lost, the gain of the Northern Sirkars would almost compensate for the disaster.",rest bengal council see time threaten invasion north menace trouble consider act little short madness send troops time little spare assist chief own account able raise irregular follower think see great value northern possession complete line british territory seacoast see movement effect diversion favour situation appear serious spare troops suffice turn scale lose gain northern compensate disaster 
44,"Having gained the council to his views, he sent Lieutenant Colonel Forde, who commanded the Company's troops in Bengal, with five hundred Europeans, two thousand natives, and six six-pounders, by sea to Vizagapatam, a port which Anandraz had seized. These landed on the 20th of October, 1758.",gain council view send command troops native pounder sea port seize land 20th 
45,"Had Conflans been an efficient officer, he could have crushed Anandraz long before the arrival of the English. He had, under his orders, a force composed of five hundred European troops, men trained by Bussy, and accustomed to victory; four thousand native troops, and a brigade of artillery. Instead of marching at once to crush the rebellion, he sent messenger after messenger to Lally, begging for assistance. It was only when he heard, from Lally, that he had directed Moracin, with three hundred European troops, to support him, that he moved against Anandraz.",efficient officer crush arrival order force compose european troops man train accustom victory native troops brigade artillery march crush rebellion send messenger messenger begg assistance hear direct european troops support move 
46,"His opportunity had, however, slipped from his hands. He had thrown away six weeks; and when, upon the march, the news reached him of the landing of the English, he took up the very strong position within sight of the fort Peddapur, and intrenched himself there.",opportunity slip hand throw week march news reach landing take strong position sight intrench 
47,"Clive had sent to Madras the news that he was despatching Colonel Forde to the Sirkars, and begged that any body of troops who might be available might be forwarded. Charlie's corps had already been recalled towards Madras, to keep the bodies of French who were converging in that direction at a distance, as long as possible, so as to allow the victualling of Madras to go on uninterrupted. Mr. Pigot now instructed Charlie to hand over the command of that force to Peters; and, with fifty men, to make his way north and to effect a junction with Forde, who was entirely deficient in cavalry.",send news despatch begg body troops available forward corps recall keep body converg direction distance possible allow victualling go uninterrupted instruct hand command force man make way effect junction deficient cavalry 
48,"Avoiding the French force, Charlie reached Vizagapatam upon the 2nd of December, and found that Forde had marched on the previous day. He started at once, and on the evening of the 3rd came up to Forde, who had arrived in sight of the French position.",avoid french force reach 2nd find march previous day start evening 3rd come arrive sight french position 
49,"Charlie had already made the acquaintance of Colonel Forde in Bengal, and Forde was glad to obtain the assistance, and advice, of an officer who had seen so much service. An hour after arriving, Charlie rode out with his commander and reconnoitred the French position; which was, they concluded, too strong to be attacked. In point of numbers, the forces were about even. Conflans had, in addition to his five hundred Europeans, six thousand native infantry, five hundred native cavalry, and thirty guns. Forde had four hundred and seventy Europeans, one thousand nine hundred Sepoys, and six guns. Anandraz had forty Europeans, five thousand infantry, five hundred horsemen, and four guns. These five thousand men were, however, a mere ragged mob, of whom very few had firearms, and the rest were armed with bows and arrows. His horsemen were equally worthless, and Forde could only rely upon the troops he had brought with him from Calcutta, and the troop of fifty natives under Charlie Marryat.",make acquaintance glad obtain assistance advice officer see much service hour arrive ride commander reconnoitr french position conclude strong attack point number force addition native infantry native cavalry gun have sepoy gun have infantry horsemen gun man mere ragged mob few have firearm rest armed bow arrow horsemen worthless rely troops bring troop native 
50,"Finding that the French position was too strong to be attacked, Forde fell back to a strong position at Chambol, a village nearly four miles from the French camp. Here, for four days, the two armies remained watching each other, the leaders of both sides considering that the position of the other was too strong to be attacked.",find french position strong attack fall strong position village mile french camp day army remain watch other leader side consider position other strong attack
