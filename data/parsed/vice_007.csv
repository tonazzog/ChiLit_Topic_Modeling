5,"Paul went straight to the fire, and stood staring into it with lack-lustre eye, too apathetic even to be hopeless, for the work of enlightening the Doctor seemed more terrible and impossible than ever, and he began to see that, if the only way of escape lay there, he had better make up his mind with what philosophy he could to adapt himself to his altered circumstances, and stay on for the rest of the term.",go fire stand stare lack lustre eye apathetic hopeless work enlighten seem terrible impossible begin see only way escape lay make mind philosophy adapt alter circumstance stay rest term

8,"Mr. Bultitude looked up into his face, which had an honest interest and kindliness in it, and his heart warmed with a faint hope.

On the one hand, a father, undemonstrative, stern, easily provoked; on the other, a son, thoughtless, forgetful, and at times it may be even wilful. But you are too sensitive; you think too much of what seems to me a not unnatural (although of course improper) protest against coldness and injustice.

53,"But Mr. Bultitude could not tamely be mocked with the very platitudes that had brought him all his misery--he cut the master short in a violent passion.

55,"And he went back to his exercises, looking puzzled and pained. The fact was, he was an ardent believer in the Good Boy of a certain order of school tales--the boy who is seized with a sudden conviction of the intrinsic baseness of boyhood, and does all in his power to get rid of the harmful taint; the boy who renounces his old comrades and his natural tastes (which after all seldom have any serious harm in them), to don a panoply of priggishness which is too often kick-proof.",go exercise look puzzled pained fact ardent believer good certain order school tale boy seize sudden conviction intrinsic baseness boyhood power get rid harmful taint boy renounce old comrade natural taste have serious harm don panoply priggishness kick proof

57,"He was always waiting for some such boy to come to him with his confession of moral worthlessness and vows of unnatural perfection, and was too simple and earnest and good himself to realise that such states of the youthful mind are not unfrequently merely morbid and hysterical, and too often degenerate into Pharisaism, or worse still, hypocrisy.",wait such boy come confession moral worthlessness vow unnatural perfection simple earnest good realise such state youthful mind morbid hysterical degenerate bad hypocrisy

60,"Mr. Bultitude on his part was more angry and disgusted than ever. He began to see that there was a muddle somewhere, and that his identity was unsuspected still.

61,"As he brooded over this, the boys straggled down as before, and looked over their lessons for the day in a dull, lifeless manner.

93,"Perhaps a similar passiveness on Mr. Bultitude's part was due to a very natural and proper desire to do everything without scandal, and in a legitimate manner; to march out, as it were, with the honours of war.
