2,"On reaching Saint Dominic's the three boys discovered that the news of their afternoon's adventure had arrived there before them.  Paul, despite his promise of secrecy, had not been able to refrain from confiding to one or two bosom friends, in strict confidence, his version of the _fracas_ on the tow-path.  Of course the story became frightfully distorted in its progress from mouth to mouth, but it flew like wildfire through Saint Dominic's all the same.",reach boy discover news afternoon adventure arrive promise secrecy able refrain confide bosom friend strict confidence version _fracas_ tow path course story become distort progress mouth mouth fly wildfire same 
3,"When Oliver and his friend with Stephen entered the school-house, groups of inquisitive boys eyed them askance and whispered as they went by.  It seemed quite a disappointment to not a few that the three did not appear covered with blood, or as pale as sheets, or with broken limbs.  No one knew exactly what had happened, but every one knew something had happened, and it would have been much more satisfactory if the heroes of the hour had had something to show for it.",friend enter school house group inquisitive boy eye askance whisper go seem disappointment few appear cover blood pale sheet break limb know happen one know happen satisfactory hero hour have show

46,"This was a sad blow to the Fifth.  They saw no comfort anywhere.  They flocked to Oliver's study, but he was not there, and Wraysford's door was locked.  The news, however, was confirmed by other reporters, and in great grief and profound melancholy the Fifth swallowed their tea, and wondered if any set of fellows were so unlucky as they.",sad blow fifth see comfort flock study door lock news confirm other reporter great grief profound melancholy fifth swallow tea wonder set fellow unlucky

70,"Oliver meanwhile had settled down as best he could once more to work, and tried to forget all about the afternoon's adventures.  But for a long time they haunted him and disturbed him.

He entered, and waited inside a couple of minutes, expecting that the head master would return; but no one came. After all, he would have to put off his confession of Stephen's delinquencies till to-morrow; and, half relieved, half disappointed, he quitted the room.  As he came out he encountered Simon in the passage.",go study door stand half open enter wait couple minute expect head master return come have put confession delinquency half relieve half disappoint quit room come encounter passage
