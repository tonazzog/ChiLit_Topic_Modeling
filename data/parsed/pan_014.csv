1,CHAPTER 14. THE PIRATE SHIP,
2,"One green light squinting over Kidd’s Creek, which is near the mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY ROGER, lay, low in the water; a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul to the hull, every beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. She was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in the horror of her name.",green light squint mouth pirate river mark brig lay low water rakish look speedy look craft foul hull beam detestable like ground strewn mangle feather cannibal sea scarce need watchful eye float immune horror name 
3,"She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save the whir of the ship’s sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee. I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook’s tears and made it flow. Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.",wrap blanket night sound reach shore be little sound agreeable save whir ship sewing machine sit industrious obliging essence commonplace pathetic know pathetic unaware strong man have turn look more summer evening touch fount tear make flow else unconscious 
4,"A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma [putrid mist] of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook’s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing.",few pirate lean bulwark drink miasma putrid mist night other sprawl barrel game dice card exhaust carry little house lay prone deck sleep roll side reach claw passing 
5,"Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of triumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his success?",hook trod deck thought man unfathomable hour triumph remove path other boy brig walk plank grimmest deed day bring heel know do vain tabernacle man surprise pace deck bell wind success 
6,"But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.",be elation gait keep pace action sombre mind hook deject 
7,He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs. They were socially inferior to him.,commun board ship quietude night alone inscrutable man feel alone surround dog inferior 
8,"Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled [attacked] her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch. But above all he retained the passion for good form.",hook true name reveal date set country blaze read line guess famous public school tradition cling garment concerned offensive board ship same dress grapple attack adhere walk school distinguished slouch retain passion good form 
9,"Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this is all that really matters.",good form much degenerate know matter 
10,"From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep. “Have you been good form to-day?” was their eternal question.",hear creaking rusty portal come stern tap tap tap hammer night sleep good form day eternal question 
11,"“Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,” he cried.",fame glitter bauble cry 
12,“Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?” the tap-tap from his school replied.,good form distinguish tap tap school reply 
13,"“I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,” he urged, “and Flint feared Barbecue.”",only man fear urge fear 
14,"“Barbecue, Flint--what house?” came the cutting retort.",house come cutting retort 
15,"Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about good form?",disquieting reflection bad form think good form 
16,"His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped down his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.",vital torture problem claw sharper iron one tore perspiration dripp tallow waxy countenance streak doublet ofttime draw sleeve face be damming trickle 
17,"Ah, envy not Hook.",envy 
18,"There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution [death]. It was as if Peter’s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it.",come presentiment early dissolution death terrible oath board ship hook feel gloomy desire make die speech time 
19,"“Better for Hook,” he cried, “if he had had less ambition!” It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.",good hook cry have less ambition dark hour refer third person 
20,“No little children to love me!”,little child love 
21,"Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under the conviction that all children feared him.",strange think trouble sewing machine bring mind mutter stare hemm conviction child fear 
22,"Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with his fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on his spectacles.",fear fear be child board brig night love say horrid thing hit palm hand hit fist cling more try spectacle 
23,"To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it, but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made him so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself--“Good form?”",tell poor think lovable hook itch do seem brutal revolve mystery mind find lovable pursue problem sleuth hound lovable make terrible answer present good form 
24,"Had the bo’sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of all?",have bo’sun good form know good form 
25,He remembered that you have to prove you don’t know you have it before you are eligible for Pop [an elite social club at Eton].,remember have prove know have eligible elite social club 
26,With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee’s head; but he did not tear. What arrested him was this reflection:,cry rage raise iron hand head tear arrest reflection 
27,"“To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?”",claw man good form 
28,“Bad form!”,bad form 
29,"The unhappy Hook was as impotent [powerless] as he was damp, and he fell forward like a cut flower.",unhappy impotent powerless damp fall cut flower 
30,"His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian [drunken] dance, which brought him to his feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passed over him.",dog think way time discipline relaxed break bacchanalian drunken dance bring foot trace human weakness gone bucket water pass 
31,"“Quiet, you scugs,” he cried, “or I’ll cast anchor in you;” and at once the din was hushed. “Are all the children chained, so that they cannot fly away?”",quiet scug cry cast anchor din hushed child chain fly 
32,"“Ay, ay.”",
33,“Then hoist them up.”,hoist 
34,"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy, and ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.",wretch prisoner drag hold rang line front time seem unconscious presence loll ease hum snatch rude song finger pack card light cigar give touch colour face 
35,"“Now then, bullies,” he said briskly, “six of you walk the plank to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to be?”",bully say walk plank night have room cabin boy 
36,"“Don’t irritate him unnecessarily,” had been Wendy’s instructions in the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constant use of it.",irritate instruction hold step hate idea sign man instinct tell prudent lay responsibility absent person silly boy know mother willing buffer child know mother despise make constant use 
37,"So Tootles explained prudently, “You see, sir, I don’t think my mother would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Slightly?”",explain see sir think mother like pirate mother like pirate 
38,"He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, “I don’t think so,” as if he wished things had been otherwise. “Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Twin?”",wink say think wish thing mother like pirate 
39,"“I don’t think so,” said the first twin, as clever as the others. “Nibs, would--”",think say first twin clever other nib 
40,"“Stow this gab,” roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. “You, boy,” he said, addressing John, “you look as if you had a little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?”",stow gab roar spokesmen drag say address look have little pluck want pirate hearty 
41,Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and he was struck by Hook’s picking him out.,experience hankering math prep. strike pick 
42,"“I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,” he said diffidently.",think call red hand say 
43,"“And a good name too. We’ll call you that here, bully, if you join.”",good name call bully join 
44,"“What do you think, Michael?” asked John.",think ask 
45,“What would you call me if I join?” Michael demanded.,call join demand 
46,“Blackbeard Joe.”,
47,"Michael was naturally impressed. “What do you think, John?” He wanted John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.",impressed think want decide want decide 
48,“Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?” John inquired.,respectful subject inquire 
49,"Through Hook’s teeth came the answer: “You would have to swear, ‘Down with the King.’”",tooth come answer have swear 
50,"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.",behave shine 
51,"“Then I refuse,” he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.",refuse cry bang barrel front 
52,"“And I refuse,” cried Michael.",refuse cry 
53,“Rule Britannia!” squeaked Curly.,squeak curly 
54,"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out, “That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.”",infuriate pirate buffet mouth roar seal doom bring mother get plank ready 
55,"They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up.",boy go white see prepare fatal plank try look brave bring 
56,"No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger “Dirty pig”; and she had already written it on several. But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of course, save for them.",word tell despise pirate boy be least glamour pirate calling see ship tidy year be porthole grimy glass write finger dirty pig write several boy gather have thought course save 
57,"“So, my beauty,” said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, “you are to see your children walk the plank.”",beauty say speak syrup see child walk plank 
58,"Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.",fine gentleman intensity communing soil ruff know gaze hasty gesture try hide late 
59,"“Are they to die?” asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted.",die ask look such frightful contempt faint 
60,"“They are,” he snarled. “Silence all,” he called gloatingly, “for a mother’s last words to her children.”",snarl silence call mother last word child 
61,"At this moment Wendy was grand. “These are my last words, dear boys,”  she said firmly. “I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers, and it is this: ‘We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen.’”",moment grand last word dear boy say feel have message real mother hope son die english gentleman 
62,"Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, “I am going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?”",pirate awe cry go do mother hope do nib 
63,"“What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?”",mother hope do 
64,"“What my mother hopes. John, what are--”",mother hope 
65,But Hook had found his voice again.,find voice 
66,“Tie her up!” he shouted.,tie shout 
67,"It was Smee who tied her to the mast. “See here, honey,” he whispered, “I’ll save you if you promise to be my mother.”",tie mast see honey whisper save promise mother 
68,"But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. “I would almost rather have no children at all,” she said disdainfully [scornfully].",make promise have child say 
69,"It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they were about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.",sad know boy look tie mast eye plank last little walk about take able hope walk capacity think go stare shiver 
70,"Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy. His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something else instead.",hook smile tooth close take step intention turn face see boy walk plank reach hear cry anguish hope wring hear else 
71,It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.,terrible tick tick crocodile 
72,"They all heard it--pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone, and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.",hear pirate boy head blow direction water sound proceed know about happen concern actor become spectator 
73,Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.,frightful see change come clippe joint fall little heap 
74,"The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought, “The crocodile is about to board the ship!”",sound come advance come ghastly thought crocodile about board ship 
75,"Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.",iron claw hang inactive know intrinsic part attack force want left other man lain eye shut fall gigantic brain work guidance crawl knee deck sound go pirate clear passage bring bulwark speak 
76,“Hide me!” he cried hoarsely.,hide cry 
77,"They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.",gather eye avert thing come have thought fight 
78,Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship’s side to see the crocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid. It was Peter.,hide curiosity loosen limb boy rush ship side see crocodile climb get strangest surprise crocodile come aid 
79,He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.,sign give vent cry admiration rouse suspicion go ticking
