1,CHAPTER IX. THE HALL OF THE GOBLIN PALACE,palace 
2," A SOUND of many soft feet followed, but soon ceased. Then Curdie flew at the hole like a tiger, and tore and pulled. The sides gave way, and it was soon large enough for him to crawl through. He would not betray himself by rekindling his lamp, but the torches of the retreating company, departing in a straight line up a long avenue from the door of their cave, threw back light enough to afford him a glance round the deserted home of the goblins. To his surprise, he could discover nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary cave in the rock, upon many of which he had come with the rest of the miners in the progress of their excavations. The goblins had talked of coming back for the rest of their household gear: he saw nothing that would have made him suspect a family had taken shelter there for a single night. The floor was rough and stony; the walls full of projecting corners; the roof in one place twenty feet high, in another endangering his forehead; while on one side a stream, no thicker than a needle, it is true, but still sufficient to spread a wide dampness over the wall, flowed down the face of the rock. But the troop in front of him was toiling under heavy burdens. He could distinguish Helfer now and then, in the flickering light and shade, with his heavy chest on his bending shoulders; while the second brother was almost buried in what looked like a great feather-bed. ""Where do they get the feathers?"" thought Curdie; but in a moment the troop disappeared at a turn of the way, and it was now both safe and necessary for Curdie to follow them, lest they should be round the next turning before he saw them again, for so he might lose them altogether. He darted after them like a grayhound. When he reached the corner and looked cautiously round, he saw them again at some distance down another long passage. None of the galleries he saw that night bore signs of the work of man--or of goblin either. Stalactites far older than the mines hung from their roofs; and their floors were rough with boulders and large round stones, showing that there water must have once run. He waited again at this corner till they had disappeared round the next, and so followed them a long way through one passage after another. The passages grew more and more lofty, and were more and more covered in the roof with shining stalactites.",sound many soft foot follow cease fly hole tiger tore pull side give way large crawl betray rekindle lamp torche retreat company depart straight line long avenue door cave throw light afford glance desert home goblin surprise discover distinguish ordinary cave rock many come rest miner progress excavation goblin talk come rest household gear see make suspect family take shelter single night floor rough stony wall full project corner roof place foot high endanger forehead side stream thick needle true sufficient spread wide dampness wall flow face rock troop front toil heavy burden distinguish flicker light shade heavy chest bending shoulder second brother bury look great feather bed get feather think moment troop disappear turn way safe necessary follow next turning see lose dart grayhound reach corner look see distance long passage gallery see night bear sign work man goblin stalactite old mine hang roof floor rough boulder large round stone show water run wait corner disappear next follow long way passage passage grow lofty more cover roof shine stalactite 
3,"It was a strange enough procession which he followed. But the strangest part of it was the household animals which crowded amongst the feet of the goblins. It was true they had no wild animals down there--at least they did not know of any; but they had a wonderful number of tame ones. I must, however, reserve any contributions toward the natural history of these for a later position in my story.",strange enough procession follow strangest part household animal crowd foot goblin true have wild animal least know have wonderful number tame one reserve contribution natural history late position story 
4,"At length, turning a corner too abruptly, he had almost rushed into the middle of the goblin family; for there they had already set down all their burdens on the floor of a cave considerably larger than that which they had left. They were as yet too breathless to speak, else he would have had warning of their arrest. He started back, however, before any one saw him, and retreating a good way, stood watching till the father should come out to go to the palace. Before very long, both he and his son Helfer appeared and kept on in the same direction as before, while Curdie followed them again with renewed precaution. For a long time he heard no sound except something like the rush of a river inside the rock; but at length what seemed the far-off noise of a great shouting reached his ears, which however presently ceased. After advancing a good way farther, he thought he heard a single voice. It sounded clearer and clearer as he went on, until at last he could almost distinguish the words. In a moment or two, keeping after the goblins round another corner, he once more started back--this time in amazement.",length turn corner rush middle goblin family set burden floor cave large leave breathless speak have warning arrest start one see retreat good way stand watch father come go palace son appear keep same direction follow renew precaution long time hear sound rush river rock length seem noise great shouting reach ear cease advance good way think hear single voice sound clear clear go last distinguish word moment keep goblin corner start time amazement 
5,"He was at the entrance of a magnificent cavern, of an oval shape, once probably a huge natural reservoir of water, now the great palace hall of the goblins. It rose to a tremendous height, but the roof was composed of such shining materials, and the multitude of torches carried by the goblins who crowded the floor lighted up the place so brilliantly, that Curdie could see to the top quite well. But he had no idea how immense the place was, until his eyes had got accustomed to it, which was not for a good many minutes. The rough projections on the walls, and the shadows thrown upward from them by the torches, made the sides of the chamber look as if they were crowded with statues upon brackets and pedestals, reaching in irregular tiers from floor to roof. The walls themselves were, in many parts, of gloriously shining substances, some of them gorgeously colored besides, which powerfully contrasted with the shadows. Curdie could not help wondering whether his rhymes would be of any use against such a multitude of goblins as filled the floor of the hall, and indeed felt considerably tempted to begin his shout of _One, two, three!_ but as there was no reason for routing them, and much for endeavoring to discover their designs, he kept himself perfectly quiet, and peeping round the edge of the doorway, listened with both his sharp ears.",entrance magnificent cavern oval shape huge natural reservoir water great palace hall goblin rise tremendous height roof compose such shine material multitude torche carry goblin crowd floor light place see top have idea immense place eye accustom good many minute rough projection wall shadow throw torche make side chamber look crowd statue bracket pedestal reach irregular tier floor roof wall many part shine substance color contrast shadow help wonder rhyme use multitude goblin fill floor hall feel tempt begin shout be reason route much endeavor discover design keep quiet peep edge doorway listen sharp ear 
6,"At the other end of the hall, high above the heads of the multitude, was a terrace-like ledge of considerable height, caused by the receding of the upper part of the cavern wall. Upon this sat the king and his court, the king on a throne hollowed out of a huge block of green copper ore, and his court upon lower seats around it. The king had been making them a speech, and the applause which followed it was what Curdie had heard. One of the court was now addressing the multitude. What he heard him say was to the following effect:",other end hall high head multitude terrace like ledge considerable height cause receding upper part cavern wall sit king court king throne hollow huge block green copper ore court low seat king make speech applause follow hear court address multitude hear say follow effect 
7,"""Hence it appears that two plans have been for some time together working in the strong head of his Majesty for the deliverance of his people. Regardless of the fact that we were the first possessors of the regions they now inhabit, regardless equally of the fact that we abandoned that region from the loftiest motives; regardless also of the self-evident fact that we excel them as far in mental ability as they excel us in stature, they look upon us as a degraded race, and make a mockery of all our finer feelings. But the time has almost arrived when--thanks to his Majesty's inventive genius--it will be in our power to take a thorough revenge upon them once for all, in respect of their unfriendly behavior.""",appear plan time work strong head deliverance person fact first possessor region inhabit fact abandon region loftiest motive self evident fact excel mental ability excel stature look degrade race make mockery finer feeling time arrive thanks inventive genius power take thorough revenge respect unfriendly behavior

9,"""Who is he that interrupts the Chancellor?"" cried another from near the throne.",interrupt chancellor cry throne 
10,"""Glump,"" answered several voices.",glump answer several voice 
11,"""He is our trusty subject,"" said the king himself, in a slow and stately voice: ""let him come forward and speak.""",trusty subject say king slow stately voice let come speak 
12,"A lane was parted through the crowd, and Glump having ascended the platform and bowed to the king, spoke as follows:",lane part crowd ascend platform bow king speak follow 
13,"""Sire, I would have held my peace, had I not known that I only knew how near was the moment to which the Chancellor had just referred. In all probability, before another day is past, the enemy will have broken through into my house--the partition between being even now not more than a foot in thickness.""",sire hold peace know know moment refer probability day past enemy break house partition more foot thickness 
14,"""Not quite so much,"" thought Curdie to himself.",much think 
15,"""This very evening I have had to remove my household effects; therefore the sooner we are ready to carry out the plan, for the execution of which his Majesty has been making such magnificent preparations, the better. I may just add, that within the last few days I have perceived a small outbreak in my dining-room, which combined with observations upon the course of the river escaping where the evil men enter, has convinced me that close to the spot must lie a deep gulf in its channel. This discovery will, I trust, add considerably to the otherwise immense forces at his Majesty's disposal.""",very evening have remove household effect ready carry plan execution make such magnificent preparation good add last few day perceive small outbreak dining room combine observation course river escape evil man enter convince close spot lie deep gulf channel discovery trust add immense force disposal 
16,"He ceased, and the king graciously acknowledged his speech with a bend of his head; whereupon Glump, after a bow to his Majesty, slid down amongst the rest of the undistinguished multitude. Then the Chancellor rose and resumed.",cease king acknowledge speech bend head bow slide rest undistinguished multitude rise resume 
17,"""The information which the worthy Glump has given us,"" he said, ""might have been of considerable import at the present moment, but for that other design already referred to, which naturally takes precedence. His Majesty, unwilling to proceed to extremities, and well aware that such measures sooner or later result in violent reactions, has excogitated a more fundamental and comprehensive measure, of which I need say no more. Should his Majesty be successful--as who dares to doubt?--then a peace, all to the advantage of the goblin kingdom, will be established for a generation at least, rendered absolutely secure by the pledge which his royal Highness the prince will have and hold for the good behavior of his relatives. Should his Majesty fail--which who shall dare even to imagine in his most secret thoughts?--then will be the time for carrying out with rigor the design to which Glump referred, and for which our preparations are even now all but completed. The failure of the former will render the latter imperative.""",information worthy give say considerable import present moment other design refer take precedence unwilling proceed extremity aware such measure result violent reaction excogitate fundamental comprehensive measure need say more successful dare doubt peace advantage goblin kingdom establish generation least render secure pledge royal highness prince have hold good behavior relative fail dare imagine secret thought time carry rigor design refer preparation complete failure former render latter imperative 
18,"Curdie perceiving that the assembly was drawing to a close, and that there was little chance of either plan being more fully discovered, now thought it prudent to make his escape before the goblins began to disperse, and slipped quietly away.",perceive assembly draw close be little chance plan discover think prudent make escape goblin begin disperse slip 
19,"There was not much danger of meeting any goblins, for all the men at least were left behind him in the palace; but there was considerable danger of his taking a wrong turning, for he had now no light, and had therefore to depend upon his memory and his hands. After he had left behind him the glow that issued from the door of Glump's new abode, he was utterly without guide, so far as his eyes were concerned.",be much danger meet goblin man least leave palace be considerable danger take wrong turning have light have depend memory hand leave glow issue door new abode guide eye concerned 
20,"He was most anxious to get back through the hole before the goblins should return to fetch the remains of their furniture. It was not that he was in the least afraid of them, but, as it was of the utmost importance that he should thoroughly discover what the plans they were cherishing were, he must not occasion the slightest suspicion that they were watched by a miner.",anxious get hole goblin return fetch remains furniture least afraid utmost importance discover plan cherish occasion slight suspicion watch miner 
21,"He hurried on, feeling his way along the walls of rock. Had he not been very courageous, he must have been very anxious, for he could not but know that if he lost his way it would be the most difficult thing in the world to find it again. Morning would bring no light into these regions; and toward him least of all, who was known as a special rhymster and persecutor, could goblins be expected to exercise courtesy? Well might he wish that he had brought his lamp and tinder-box with him, of which he had not thought when he crept so eagerly after the goblins! He wished it all the more when, after a while, he found his way blocked up, and could get no farther. It was of no use to turn back, for he had not the least idea where he had begun to go wrong. Mechanically, however, he kept feeling about the walls that hemmed him in. His hand came upon a place where a tiny stream of water was running down the face of the rock. ""What a stupid I am!"" he said to himself. ""I am actually at the end of my journey!--and there are the goblins coming back to fetch their things!"" he added, as the red glimmer of their torches appeared at the end of the long avenue that led up to the cave. In a moment he had thrown himself on the floor, and wriggled backward through the hole. The floor on the other side was several feet lower, which made it easier to get back. It was all he could do to lift the largest stone he had taken out of the hole, but he did manage to shove it in again. He sat down on the ore-heap and thought.",hurry feel way wall rock courageous anxious know lose way difficult thing world find morning bring light region least know special rhymster persecutor goblin expect exercise courtesy wish bring lamp tinder box think creep goblin wish more while find way block get far use turn least idea begin go wrong keep feel wall hemm hand come place tiny stream water run face rock stupid say end journey be goblin come fetch thing add red glimmer torche appear end long avenue lead cave moment throw floor wriggle hole floor other side several foot low make easy get do lift large stone take hole manage shove sit ore heap thought 
22,"He was pretty sure that the latter plan of the goblins was to inundate the mine by breaking outlets for the water accumulated in the natural reservoirs of the mountain, as well as running through portions of it. While the part hollowed by the miners remained shut off from that inhabited by the goblins, they had had no opportunity of injuring them thus; but now that a passage was broken through, and the goblins' part proved the higher in the mountain, it was clear to Curdie that the mine could be destroyed in an hour. Water was always the chief danger to which the miners were exposed. They met with a little choke-damp sometimes, but never with the explosive fire-damp so common in coal mines. Hence they were careful as soon as they saw any appearance of water.",sure latter plan goblin inundate mine break outlet water accumulate natural reservoir mountain run portion part hollow miner remain shut inhabit goblin have opportunity injure passage break goblin part prove high mountain clear destroy hour water chief danger miner expose meet little choke damp explosive fire damp common coal mine careful see appearance water 
23,"As the result of his reflections while the goblins were busy in their old home, it seemed to Curdie that it would be best to build up the whole of this gang, filling it with stone, and clay or lime, so that there should be no smallest channel for the water to get into. There was not, however, any immediate danger, for the execution of the goblins' plan was contingent upon the failure of that unknown design which was to take precedence of it; and he was most anxious to keep the door of communication open, that he might if possible discover what that former plan was. At the same time they could not then resume their intermitted labors for the inundation without his finding it out; when by putting all hands to the work, the one existing outlet might in a single night be rendered impenetrable to any weight of water; for by filling the gang entirely up, their embankment would be buttressed by the sides of the mountain itself.",result reflection goblin busy old home seem good build whole gang fill stone clay lime be small channel water get be immediate danger execution goblin plan contingent failure unknown design take precedence anxious keep door communication open possible discover former plan same time resume intermitted labor inundation finding put hand work exist outlet single night render impenetrable weight water fill gang embankment buttress side mountain 
24,"As soon as he found that the goblins had again retired, he lighted his lamp, and proceeded to fill the hole he had made with such stones as he could withdraw when he pleased. He then thought it better, as he might have occasion to be up a good many nights after this, to go home and have some sleep.",find goblin retire light lamp proceed fill hole make such stone withdraw pleased think good have occasion good many night go have sleep 
25,"How pleasant the night-air felt upon the outside of the mountain after what he had gone through in the inside of it! He hurried up the hill, without meeting a single goblin on the way, and called and tapped at the window until he woke his father, who soon rose and let him in. He told him the whole story, and, just as he had expected, his father thought it best to work that lode no farther, but at the same time to pretend occasionally to be at work there still, in order that the goblins might have no suspicions. Both father and son then went to bed, and slept soundly until the morning.",pleasant night air feel outside mountain go inside hurry hill meet single goblin way call tap window wake father rise let tell whole story expect father think good work lode far same time pretend work order goblin have suspicion father son go bed sleep morning
