1,CHAPTER VI.,
2," The day had now arrived when Mrs. Roberts was expected; the young people were all assembled in the school-room busy with their different tasks; Selina and Leila were seated silently at their writing-desks, translating English into French; Alfred quietly in a corner, drawing birds and animals on a slate, his favourite employment. Matilda alone was restless and unquiet; she kept constantly running from the table to the window, holding a book of French dialogues in her hand, and looking out on the approach, while she rhymed the same phrase over and over again: “Il faudra faire comme nous pourrons, il faudra faire comme nous pourrons, il faudra faire comme nous pourrons; now surely this is knocked into my brains.”",day arrive expect young person assemble school room busy different task seat writing desk translate corner draw bird animal slate favourite employment restless unquiet keep run table window hold book french dialogue hand look approach rhyme same phrase knock brain

7,“But will running to the window and shaking the whole room make her come any sooner?” Selina inquired.,run window shake whole room make come inquire 
8,"“To be sure it will, that is, I shall see her sooner. Alfred, do run down and listen if you hear a carriage,” and she snatched the slate from his hand; “there’s a good boy, run down and do like Fine-ear, you know; stoop down and put your ear to the ground, there’s a man,” and she pushed him out at the door.",sure see run listen hear carriage snatch slate hand be good boy run do fine ear know stake put ear ground be man push door 
9,"Alfred returned again almost immediately. “I could not play at fine-ear, Matilda,” he said, “for I saw the carriage at a little distance the moment I went out; listen, it is stopping at the door now.”",return play fine ear say see carriage little distance moment go listen stop door 
10,"All the three young girls jumped up and ran instantly to the window. The steps of the carriage were let down, a ladylike person, rather slender, and rather above the middle height, stepped out, her bonnet entirely concealing her face. Mr. Stanley came forward, he seemed to welcome her kindly; they entered the house together. The next moment they heard the drawing-room door close. Matilda glided from the room.",young girl jump run window step carriage let ladylike person slender middle height step bonnet conceal face come seem welcome enter house next moment hear draw room door close glide room

15,The drawing-room bell rang; in a few minutes Amy tapped at the school-room door to say the young ladies were wanted in the drawing-room. They all went down.,draw room bell ring few minute tap school room door say young lady want draw room go 
16,"Mrs. Roberts seemed talking earnestly to their mamma when they entered; but she stopped, and as Mrs. Stanley introduced them, said a few kind words to each. Her face was not pretty till she smiled; her smile was very pleasing, and her voice was low and sweet. Leila felt she should like her; both she and Selina, when addressed, said something in return, and probably just what they ought to say, though no one heard it; Matilda said nothing. Almost immediately after Mrs. Stanley told them they might return to the school-room, that Mrs. Roberts was probably a little tired with her journey, but if she felt inclined by and by for a walk, they might join them in the garden.",seem talk mamma enter stop introduce say few kind word face smile smile pleasing voice low sweet feel like address say return say hear say tell return school room little tired journey feel inclined walk join garden

24,Selina saw that at this moment it was a hopeless case; she did not even attempt the vindication of the nose.,see moment hopeless case attempt vindication nose 
25,"Mrs. Stanley was not disappointed in her expectations with regard to Mrs. Roberts; she proved to be a highly principled, amiable, accomplished woman, and with a gentle steadiness about her which peculiarly fitted her for the task she had undertaken. With Selina and Leila she had comparatively little trouble, and they soon became fond of her, and anxious to give her satisfaction, but with Matilda she had a far more difficult task; besides having strong prejudices to combat, she had to struggle not only with careless inattentive habits, but often with an obstinate determination not to overcome them, for Matilda’s goodness as yet only came by fits and starts; there was no very steady improvement, and the arrival of Mrs. Roberts seemed rather to have thrown her back. She had fancied that she would not like her, and she seemed too often to have a wish to act up to the opinion she had formed. Mrs. Roberts’ patience with her was wonderful; indifferent observers might have fancied that Matilda was her favourite; she spoke more to her than to the others, often conversing cheerfully with her on interesting subjects, and trying to draw out her feelings and sentiments; and Matilda, though she gave her much trouble, was not quite insensible to this. There were times when she acknowledged that Mrs. Roberts was rather a kind person, though her nose did droop.",disappointed expectation regard prove principled amiable accomplish woman gentle steadiness fit task undertake have little trouble become fond anxious give satisfaction have difficult task have strong prejudice combat have struggle careless inattentive habit obstinate determination overcome goodness come fit start be steady improvement arrival seem throw fancy like seem have wish act opinion form patience wonderful indifferent observer fancy favourite speak more other convers interesting subject try draw feeling sentiment give much trouble insensible be time acknowledge kind person nose driop 
26,"The removal to Woodlands now took place, and the following morning Mrs. Roberts granted a holiday to the young people, that every room in the house might be visited and properly admired, and also that Leila might have time to settle with Susan as to a convenient arrangement for several of her pets, while, with the assistance of her cousins, she hung the cages with the parrots and the smaller birds up in the conservatory. She had for some time been bringing up a pair of turtle-doves as a gift to Mina, and teaching a young parrot to speak, which she intended for Louisa. The turtle-doves were now at a very interesting age, just beginning to be independent, and to coo to each other in a most melodious manner, and the parrot gave proof of fine abilities, and could already say, “I am Louisa’s pretty bird.”",removal take place follow morning grant holiday young person room house visit admire have time settle convenient arrangement several pet assistance cousin hang cage parrot small bird conservatory have time bring pair turtle dove gift teach young parrot speak intend turtle dove interesting age begin independent coo other melodious manner parrot give proof fine ability say bird 
27,"The house was most comfortably though simply furnished; but the conservatory delighted Leila more than any part of it: the flowers so fragrant, so bright and beautiful, and the birds so happy, they were already singing in the branches. Once more she walked about amongst the birds and flowers, and felt that but for one sad thought she would not have had a wish ungratified. She quite longed to give her papa an account of all her arrangements, and went in search of him. She found Mr. Howard reading in his library, but he answered her little tap at his door with his usual kind voice.",house furnish conservatory delight more part flower fragrant bright beautiful bird happy sing branch more walk bird flower feel sad think have wish ungratified long give papa account arrangement go search find read library answer little tap door usual kind voice 
28,"“Come in, I think I know who is there; what have you got to tell me, love?” and the book was thrown aside, and she, seated on a low stool at his knee, kept looking up in his face, and pouring out her little history, he entering into all her arrangements with all the attention and satisfaction her heart could desire. “And now, papa,” she continued, “you know I am of a great age now, I am eleven, and I want to talk to you a little about my responsibilities.”",come think know get tell love book throw seat low stool knee keep look face pour little history enter arrangement attention satisfaction heart desire continue know great age want talk little responsibility 
29,"“Your responsibilities, my love!--that is a very fine word for you; where did you pick up that word, Leila?”",responsibility love fine word pick word 
30,"“I think it is a very nice word, papa, and I understand it; and you must know I have responsibilities in my new home, for I heard Aunt Stanley say to Mrs. Roberts the other day, that Miss Palmer had gone now to keep her father’s house, and would have many responsibilities; that besides the regulating the house, and attending in every way to his comfort, she would also have the school to attend to, and the poor people to visit, and it was a large parish. I could not find out what a large parish meant, but I understood all the rest; and don’t you think, papa, I should have a school, also, and visit the poor people?”",think nice word papa understand know have responsibility new home hear say other day go keep father house have many responsibility regulate house attend way comfort have school attend poor person visit large parish find large parish mean understand rest think have school visit poor person 
31,"“No, dear Leila; I think you are too young to have a school at present; but don’t look so disappointed, my love; let us talk this matter over quietly. Miss Palmer is a great many years older than you are, she is a grown-up young lady, and it is quite right that she should in every way imitate her excellent mother’s example, and endeavour to make up as much as lies in her power for the loss they have sustained in Mrs. Palmer’s death: but you, my love, are still a child, and requiring too much instruction yourself to be able to instruct others; yet you, dear Leila, also have your responsibilities.”",dear think young have school present look disappointed love let talk matter great many year old grow young lady right way imitate excellent mother example endeavour make much lie power loss sustain death love child require much instruction able instruct other dear have responsibility 
32,"“I am so glad of that papa,”--and her countenance brightened again.",glad papa countenance brighten 
33,"“Yes,” Mr. Howard continued, “you are responsible for the talents God has entrusted to you, for the employment of your time, for the cultivation of the abilities He has given you; for the use you make of the religious instruction you receive in correcting your faults; you are by nature ardent and impetuous, you must struggle for the mastery over yourself; for more self-denial, in rejecting the sudden impulses by which you are governed; you must try to check that excessive sensibility which, if indulged in, must unfit you for the necessary exertion for the welfare of others which is so high a duty, and without which you would soon become a useless, selfish being--turning away from the misery of others, from the fear of what you yourself must feel in witnessing it.”",continue responsible talent entrust employment time cultivation ability give use make religious instruction receive correct fault nature ardent impetuous struggle mastery more self denial reject sudden impulse govern try check excessive sensibility indulge unfit necessary exertion welfare other high duty become useless selfish being turn misery other fear feel witness 
34,"“But, papa, if I am not to teach a school or visit the poor, and only to cultivate abilities, is not that turning away from others, is not that being selfish?”",teach school visit poor cultivate ability turn other selfish 
35,"“But, my dear Leila, it is by no means my wish that you should turn away from others; though you are as yet too young to teach a school yourself, you are not too young to accompany your Aunt Stanley when she goes to visit the school, in which she takes so much interest. Selina often accompanies her; I shall ask her to allow you to do so also; and in this way you will become acquainted with the duties you will, I trust, one day fulfil yourself. You will, also, accompany me in visiting the poor; you have now a weekly allowance, which, though not much, will still enable you, by practising self-denial in some of your own desires, to save a little each week for the benefit of others: with this you can sometimes buy materials which may be useful to poor children; and by employing some part of your time in making them up, you can bestow a double benefit; for remember, Leila, it is not real charity to give of your superfluity only.”",dear mean wish turn other young teach school young accompany go visit school take much interest accompany ask allow do way become acquainted duty trust day fulfil accompany visit poor have weekly allowance much enable practise self denial own desire save little week benefit other buy material useful poor child employ part time make bestow double benefit remember real charity give superfluity 
36,"“I know it, papa; I know that you are thinking now of the rich man throwing into the treasury, and the widow’s mite, and I will try to be the widow’s mite. Am I staying too long, papa?” she continued; “must I go now? perhaps you wish to have your book again?”",know papa know think rich man throw treasury widow mite try widow mite stay long papa continue go wish have book 
37,"“No, my dear child, I am in no hurry to resume my book; I am quite pleased to have a little talk with you; besides, if I had not heard your little tap at the door just then, I meant to have sent for you--I have got something to show you.”",dear child hurry resume book pleased have little talk hear little tap door mean send get show 
38,"“To show me, papa?”",show papa 
39,"“Yes, my love; something which will interest you, but will also bring to your mind sorrowful recollections.”",love interest bring mind sorrowful recollection 
40,"Leila looked up anxiously in her papa’s face. “Is it about Dash?” she said; “has any one answered the advertisement? or Peggy?--but no, about Peggy, that is impossible; poor Peggy!”",look papa face say one answer advertisement impossible poor 
41,"Mr. Howard smiled mournfully as he answered. “No, my child, I have heard nothing of them.”",smile answer child hear 
42,"Leila continued: “I have tried to bear it, papa, and not to give way; and I have prayed to God, and He has strengthened me, and often I feel quite comforted, sometimes I feel quite happy, just as if it had never been; but often when I am talking and laughing I am not really happy--I am only pretending, for Selina and Matilda always look so distressed when I am sorrowful; but night is the worst--I always think of Peggy at night;--and how kind she was to me; and there is nobody to be made sorrowful then, and so I often cry very much; but I won’t talk of it any more, and I am forgetting you had something to show me;” and she hastily brushed the tears from her eyes.",continue try bear papa give way pray strengthen feel comfort feel happy talk laugh happy pretend look distressed sorrowful night bad think night kind be make sorrowful cry talk more forget have show brush tear eye 
43,"Her papa carefully unfolded a small paper which he took from his pocket-book, and showed Leila a very few small seeds.",papa unfold small paper take pocket book show few small seed 
44,"“Flower-seeds?” she asked, inquiringly; “are they not, papa?”",flower seed ask papa 
45,"“Yes, my love, they are the seeds of Clara’s flower.”",love seed flower 
46,"She started. “Of Clara’s flowers! Who has been to visit her lonely grave? Who, papa?”",start flower visit lonely grave papa 
47,"“No, one, my love; I gathered those seeds the day we left the island; but I did not mention it to you, because I thought I had lost them, and that they had dropped from my pocket-book. This morning I found that this paper had fallen within another, and that the seeds were still there; there are only seven of them, but I don’t think there ever were more, for I remember I had difficulty in finding even these.”",love gather seed day leave island mention think lose drop pocket book morning find paper fall seed be think be more remember have difficulty find 
48,"Leila gazed at them earnestly. “I also tried to find seeds that day, and could get none--how interesting they will be to me. I will plant them instantly, and when they spring up, I will have some of Clara’s flower to give to her mamma.”",gaze try find seed day get interesting plant spring have flower give mamma 
49,"“But, my dear Leila,” Mr. Howard said, “had you not better wait till spring? I fear this is not a good time to sow flower-seeds;” but seeing her look of distress, he added,--“at least, it would be more prudent to sow only part now, and the others in spring, this will give you the best chance of securing some of the plants.”",dear say wait spring fear good time sow flower seed see look distress add least prudent sow only part other spring give good chance secure plant 
50,"“Well, papa, I will do that, and three I think will be prudent;” and selecting three of the seeds, she folded them into another paper. “You had better keep these, papa, that I may not be tempted; and I will go now to the gardener--he is very good-natured--he will give me a flower-pot and the proper earth, and I will plant them this moment and put them into the conservatory. In the conservatory it will be the same for them as in the island, for it is always so warm there; so you see, papa, I am very prudent about them, for I did not mean to put them out in the cold. Every day I shall watch for their coming up. You could not have given me any thing, papa, so very interesting to me--I will come back and tell you when they are planted;” and she darted off.",do think prudent select seed fold paper have good keep papa tempt go gardener good natured give flower pot proper earth plant moment put conservatory conservatory same island warm see papa prudent mean put cold day watch come give thing papa interesting come tell plant dart
