2," For the next four days, Charlie followed his uncle's instructions and amused himself. He visited Exeter Change, took a boat and rowed down the river to Greenwich, and a coach and visited the palace of Hampton Court. He went to see the coaches make their start, in the morning, for all places in England, and marvelled at the perfection of the turnouts. He went to the playhouses twice, in the evening, and saw Mr. Garrick in his performance as Richard the Third.",next day follow uncle instruction amuse visit take boat row river coach visit palace go see coach make start morning place marvel perfection turnout go playhouse evening see performance third 
3,"On the fifth day, a great surprise awaited him. His uncle, at breakfast, had told him briefly that he did not wish him to go out before dinner, as someone might want to see him; and Charlie, supposing that a messenger might be coming down from the India House, waited indoors; and an hour later he was astonished, when the door of the room opened and his mother and sisters entered.",fifth day great surprise await uncle breakfast tell wish go dinner want see suppose messenger come wait hour astonished door room open mother sister enter

8,"""Oh, my dear, he has been so kind,"" his mother said; ""and so funny! He wrote me such a scolding letter, just as if I had been a very naughty little girl. He said he wasn't going to allow me to bring disgrace upon him, by living in wretched lodgings at Yarmouth, nor by his grandnieces being sent out as governesses. So he ordered me at once--ordered me Charlie, as if I had no will of my own--to give up the lodgings, and to take our places in the coach, yesterday morning. He said we were not to shame him by appearing here in rags, and he sent me a hundred pounds, every penny of which, he said, was to be laid out in clothes. As to the future, he said it would be his duty to see that I brought no further disgrace upon the family.""",dear kind mother say funny write scold letter naughty little girl say go allow bring disgrace live wretch lodging grandniece send governess order order have will own give lodging take place coach yesterday morning say shame appear rag send pound penny say lay clothes future say duty see bring further disgrace family

""But of course, Uncle, if you object to be kissed, the girls will abstain from doing so.""",take much pain education way other say smile course object kiss girl abstain do 
24,"""No,"" Mr. Tufton said, thoughtfully. ""It is the duty of nieces to kiss their uncles, in moderation--in moderation, mind--and it is the duty of the uncles to receive those salutations, and I do not know that the duty is altogether an unpleasant one. I am, myself, unaccustomed to be kissed, but it is an operation to which I may accustom myself, in time.""",say duty niece kiss uncle moderation moderation mind duty uncle receive salutation know duty unpleasant one unaccustomed kiss operation accustom time

30,"The remainder of Charlie's stay in London passed most pleasantly. They visited all the sights of town, Mr. Tufton performing what he called his duty with an air of protest, but showing a general thoughtfulness and desire to please his visitors, which was very apparent even when he grunted and grumbled the most.",remainder stay pass visit sight town perform call duty air protest show general thoughtfulness desire please visitor apparent grunt grumble most

32,"""Tomorrow you are going to sail,"" he said, ""and to start in life on your own account, and I trust that you will, as far as possible, be steady, and do your duty to your employers. You will understand that, although the pay of a writer is not high, there are opportunities for advancement. The Company have the monopoly of the trade of India, and in addition to their great factories at Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, they have many other trading stations. Those who, by their good conduct, attract the attention of their superiors, rise to positions of trust and emolument. There are many who think that the Company will, in time, enlarge its operations; and as they do so, superior opportunities will offer themselves; and since the subject of India has been prominently brought before my notice, I have examined the question, and am determined to invest somewhat largely in the stock of the Company, a step which will naturally give me some influence with the board. That influence I shall, always supposing that your conduct warrants it, exercise on your behalf.",tomorrow go sail say start life own account trust possible steady do duty employer understand pay writer high be opportunity advancement company have monopoly trade addition great factory have many other trading station good conduct attract attention superior rise position trust emolument be many think company time enlarge operation do superior opportunity offer subject bring notice examine question determined invest stock company step give influence board influence suppose conduct warrant exercise behalf 
33,"""As we are now at war with France, and it is possible that the vessel in which you are proceeding may be attacked by the way, I have thought it proper that you should be armed. You will, therefore, find in your cabin a brace of pistols, a rifle, and a double-barrel shotgun: which last, I am informed, is a useful weapon at close quarters. Should your avocations in India permit your doing so, you will find them useful in the pursuit of game. I hope that you will not be extravagant; but as a matter of business I find that it is useful to be able to give entertainments, to persons who may be in a position to benefit or advance you. I have, therefore, arranged that you will draw from the factor at Madras the sum of two hundred pounds, annually, in addition to your pay.

36,"""Well, Mother,"" Charlie said, after telling her of his uncle's generosity, ""thank goodness you will be all right now, anyhow. No doubt Uncle intends to do something for you and the girls, though he has said nothing at present, beyond the fact that you are not to be in wretched lodgings, and they are not to go out as governesses. But even if he should change his mind, and I don't think he ever does that, I shall be able to help you.",mother say tell uncle generosity thank goodness intend do girl say present fact wretch lodging go governess change mind think do able help 
37,"""Oh, he is kind, isn't he?""",kind 
38,"The parting was far less sad than that which had taken place at Yarmouth. Charlie was now assured that his mother and sisters would be comfortable, and well cared for in his absence; while his mother, happy in the lightening of her anxiety as to the future of her daughters, and as to the prospects of her son, was able to bear with better heart the thought of their long separation.",parting sad take place assure mother sister comfortable care absence mother happy lightening anxiety future daughter prospect son able bear good heart thought long separation 
39,"Mrs. Marryat and the girls accompanied him on board ship. Mr. Tufton declined to join the party, under the plea that, in the first place, he was busy; and in the second, that he feared there would be an emotional display. He sent, however, his head clerk with them, to escort the ladies on their return from the docks.",girl accompany board ship decline join party plea first place busy second fear be emotional display send head clerk escort lady return dock 
40,"The Lizzie Anderson was a fine ship, of the largest size, and she was almost as clean and trim as a man of war. She carried twelve cannon, two of them thirty-two pounders, which were in those days considered large pieces of ordnance. All the ships of the Company, and, indeed, all ocean-going merchantmen of the day, were armed, as the sea swarmed with privateers, and the black flag of the pirates was still occasionally to be seen.",fine ship large size clean trim man war carry non pounder day consider large piece ordnance ship company ocean go merchantmen day armed sea swarm privateer black flag pirate see 
41,"The girls were delighted with all they saw, as, indeed, was Charlie; for accustomed, as they were, only to the coasting vessels which frequented the port of Yarmouth, this floating castle appeared to them a vessel of stupendous size and power.",girl delight see accustom coast vessel frequent port float castle appear vessel stupendous size power 
42,"This was Charlie's first visit, also, to the ship, for his uncle had told him that all directions had been given, that the trunks with the things necessary for the voyage would be found in his cabin, at the time of starting, and the rest of the luggage in the hold. Everything was in order, and Charlie found that his cabin companion was a doctor in the service, returning to Madras. He was a pleasant man, of some five or six and thirty, and assured Mrs. Marryat that he would soon make her son at home on board ship, and would, moreover, put him up to the ways of things upon his arrival in India. There were many visitors on board, saying goodbye to their friends, and all sat down to lunch, served in the saloon.",first visit ship uncle tell direction give trunk thing necessary voyage find cabin time start rest luggage hold order find cabin companion doctor service return pleasant man assure make son home board ship put way thing arrival be many visitor board say goodbye friend sit lunch serve saloon 
43,"When this was over, the bell rang for visitors to go ashore. There was a short scene of parting, in which Charlie was not ashamed to use his handkerchief as freely as did his mother and sisters. Five minutes later, the great vessel passed through the dock gates. Charlie stood at the stern, waving his handkerchief as long as he could catch a glimpse of the figures of his family; and then as, with her sails spread and the tide gaining strength every minute beneath her, the vessel made her way down the river, he turned round to examine his fellow passengers.",bell ring visitor go be short scene parting ashamed use handkerchief do mother sister minute great vessel pass dock gate stand stern wave handkerchief catch glimpse figure family sail spread tide gain strength minute vessel make way river turn examine fellow passenger 
44,"These were some twenty in number, and for the most part men. Almost all were, in some capacity or other, civil or military, in the service of the Company; for at that time their monopoly was a rigid one, and none outside its boundary were allowed to trade in India. The Company was, indeed, solely a great mercantile house of business. They had their own ships, their own establishments, and bought and sold goods like other traders. They owned a small extent of country, round their three great trading towns; and kept up a little army, composed of two or three white regiments; and as many composed of natives, trained and disciplined like Europeans, and known as Sepoys. Hence the clergyman, the doctor, a member of the council of Madras, four or five military officers, twice as many civilians, and three young writers, besides Charlie, were all in the employment of the Company.",number most part man capacity other civil military service company time monopoly rigid one boundary allow trade company great mercantile house business have own ship own establishment buy sell goods other trader own small extent country great trading town keep little army compose white regiment many compose native train disciplined know clergyman doctor member council military officer many civilian young writer employment company 
45,"""Well, youngster,"" a cheery voice said beside him, ""take your last look at the smoke of London, for it will be a good many years before you see it again, my lad.

48,"""I hope so,"" the captain said, ""but it all depends upon the wind. A finer ship never floated than the Lizzie Anderson; but the Company don't build their vessels for speed, and it's no use trying to run, when you meet a Frenchman. Those fellows understand how to build ships, and if they could fight them as well as they build them, we should not long be mistress of the sea.""",hope captain say depend wind finer ship float company build vessel speed use try run meet fellow understand build ship fight build mistress sea

That is his wife over there, with a companion holding her shawl for her. That pretty little woman, next to her, is the wife of Captain Tibbets, the tall man leaning against the bulwarks.

60,"A week later, the Lizzie Anderson was running down the Spanish coast, with all sail set. She was out of sight of land, and so far had seen nothing likely to cause uneasiness. They had met many vessels, homeward bound from the Mediterranean, and one or two big ships which the captain pronounced to be Indiamen. That morning, however, a vessel was seen coming out from the land. She seemed, to Charlie's eyes, quite a small vessel, and he was surprised to see how often the captain and officers turned their glasses towards her.",week run spanish coast sail set sight land see likely cause uneasiness meet many vessel bind big ship captain pronounce morning vessel see come land seem eye small vessel surprise see captain officer turn glasses

63,"""It's the size of the guns, not the size of the ship, that counts, my boy. She has the advantage of being able to sail three feet to our two; and probably, small as she is, she carries half as many men again as we do.

66,"""I thought so,"" he said to the first officer. ""I fancied that fellow wasn't alone. He would hardly have ventured to try his strength with us, if he had been.

69,"It soon became known that the belief of the captain was that the vessel in their wake, and that which could be seen approaching on the beam, were French privateers; and soon all were preparing, in their own way, for what might happen. The sailors cleared the decks, and loosed the guns. The gentlemen went below, and shortly returned bringing up rifles and fowling pieces.

70,"""Why don't you put on more sail, sir?"" Mr. Ashmead, the member of the council, said to the captain. ""My wife, sir, objects to the sound of firearms, and I must really beg that you will increase your speed. As it is, we are losing rather than gaining upon that vessel behind. The duty of the ships of the Company is to try not to fight.""",put more sail sir member council say captain wife sir object sound firearm beg increase speed lose gain vessel duty ship company try fight

But unfortunately, the choice upon the present occasion lies with the gentlemen yonder, and not with us. It is not of the slightest use adding to the sail we carry, for at our very best speed, those schooners could sail round and round us. As night comes on I intend to shorten sail, and put the ship into fighting trim. In the morning I shall again increase it, but I shall not make any attempt to escape a combat which it depends entirely on those privateers to bring on, or not, as they choose. I am sorry that Mrs. Ashmead should be exposed to the unpleasantness of listening to the explosion of firearms, and that my other lady passengers should be exposed to the danger which cannot but arise, more or less, from a naval conflict.",help captain add fight help choice present occasion lie gentleman yonder slight use add sail carry good speed schooner sail night come intend shorten sail put ship fighting trim morning increase make attempt escape combat depend privateer bring choose sorry expose unpleasantness listen explosion firearm other lady passenger expose danger arise naval conflict

73,"Seeing the gentlemen go below for their guns, Charlie asked one of the other young writers, a lad of about his own age, named Peters, with whom he had become very friendly, to go below with him. He had not yet examined the arms that his uncle had given him, for he had not thought of them since he saw the gun cases under his berth, on his first arrival on board ship. He found the doctor already in his cabin, putting together a heavy double-barrelled gun.",see gentleman go gun ask other young writer lad own age name become friendly go examine arm uncle give think see gun case berth first arrival board ship find doctor cabin put heavy double barrell gun

You'll find your shoulder ache, at first; but you'll get accustomed to it, in time. I'm always in favour of heavy barrels. They shoot stronger and straighter than your light guns, are not so liable to get bent or bruised, if a stupid servant drops one across a stone; and, after all, two or three pounds difference in weight does not make any material difference, when you're accustomed to it.

81,"""Do not you think,"" Charlie asked his friend the doctor, ""that they are likely to try and board us tonight?""",think ask friend doctor likely try board tonight 
82,"""No,"" the doctor said. ""These privateers generally depend upon their long guns. They know that we shall be on the watch all night, and that, in a hand-to-hand fight, they would lose a considerable number of men; while by keeping at a distance, and maintaining a fire with their long guns, they rely upon crippling their opponents; and then, ranging up under their stern, pouring in a fire at close quarters until they surrender.",doctor say privateer depend long gun know watch night hand hand fight lose considerable number man keep distance maintain fire long gun rely cripple opponent range stern pour fire close quarter surrender

No, I think you will see that at daylight, if the coast is clear, they will begin.""",thing prefer daylight see other vessel approach cruiser hear cannonade night come take unaware think see daylight coast clear begin 
84,"Such was evidently the captain's opinion also, as he ordered sail to be still further shortened, and all, save the watch on deck, to turn in at once. The lights were all extinguished, not that the captain had any idea of evading his pursuers, but that he wished to avoid offering them a mark for their fire, should they approach in the darkness.",such captain opinion order sail shorten save watch deck turn light extinguish captain have idea evade pursuer wish avoid offer mark fire approach darkness
