1,CHAPTER III. AN OLD FRIEND IN A NEW DRESS.,old friend new dress 
2," Week after week, through the three last months of the year, Jessica appeared every Wednesday at the coffee-stall and, after waiting patiently till the close of the breakfasting business, received her pittance from the charity of her new friend. After a while Daniel allowed her to carry some of his load to the coffee-house, but he never suffered her to follow him farther, and he was always particular to watch her out of sight before he turned off through the intricate mazes of the streets in the direction of his own home. Neither did he encourage her to ask him any more questions; and often but very few words passed between them during Jessica’s breakfast time.",week week last month year appear coffee stall wait close breakfasting business receive pittance charity new friend while allow carry load coffee house suffer follow particular watch sight turn intricate maze street direction own home encourage ask more question few word pass breakfast time 
3,"As to Jessica’s home, she made no secret of it, and Daniel might have followed her any time he pleased. It was a single room, which had once been a hay-loft, over the stable of an old inn, now in use for two or three donkeys, the property of costermongers dwelling in the court about it. The mode of entrance was by a wooden ladder, whose rungs were crazy and broken, and which led up through a trap-door in the floor of the loft. The interior of the home was as desolate and comfortless as that of the stable below, with only a litter of straw for the bedding and a few bricks and boards for the furniture. Every thing that could be pawned had disappeared long ago, and Jessica’s mother often lamented that she could not thus dispose of her child. Yet Jessica was hardly a burden to her. It was a long time since she had taken any care to provide her with food or clothing, and the girl had to earn or beg for herself the meat which kept a scanty life within her. Jess was the drudge and errand-girl of the court; and what with being cuffed and beaten by her mother, and overworked and ill-used by her numerous employers, her life was a hard one. But now there was always Wednesday morning to count upon and look forward to; and by and by a second scene of amazed delight opened upon her.",home make secret follow time pleased single room hay loft stable old inn use donkey property costermonger dwelling court mode entrance wooden ladder rung crazy break lead trap door floor loft interior home desolate comfortless stable litter straw bedding few brick board furniture thing pawn disappear mother lament dispose child burden long time take care provide food clothing girl have earn beg meat keep scanty life drudge errand girl court cuff beat mother overworked ill use numerous employer life hard one be morning count look second scene amaze delight open 
4,"Jessica had wandered far away from home in the early darkness of a winter’s evening, after a violent outbreak of her drunken mother, and she was still sobbing now and then with long-drawn sobs of pain and weariness, when she saw a little way before her the tall, well-known figure of her friend Mr. Daniel. He was dressed in a suit of black, with a white neckcloth, and he was pacing with brisk yet measured steps along the lighted streets. Jessica felt afraid of speaking to him, but she followed at a little distance, until presently he stopped before the iron gates of a large building and, unlocking them, passed on to the arched doorway, and with a heavy key opened the folding-doors and entered in. The child stole after him but paused for a few minutes, trembling upon the threshold, until the gleam of a light lit up within tempted her to venture a few steps forward, and to push a little way open an inner door, covered with crimson baize, only so far as to enable her to peep through at the inside. Then, growing bolder by degrees, she crept through herself, drawing the door to noiselessly behind her. The place was in partial gloom, but Daniel was kindling every gaslight, and each minute lit it up in more striking grandeur. She stood in a carpeted aisle, with high oaken pews on each side almost as black as ebony. A gallery of the same dark old oak ran round the walls, resting upon massive pillars, behind one of which she was partly concealed, gazing with eager eyes at Daniel, as he mounted the pulpit steps and kindled the lights there, disclosing to her curious delight the glittering pipes of an organ behind it. Before long the slow and soft-footed chapel-keeper disappeared for a moment or two into a vestry; and Jessica, availing herself of his short absence, stole silently up under the shelter of the dark pews until she reached the steps of the organ loft, with its golden show. But at this moment Mr. Daniel appeared again, arrayed in a long gown of black serge; and as she stood spell-bound gazing at the strange appearance of her patron, his eyes fell upon her, and he also was struck speechless for a minute, with an air of amazement and dismay upon his grave face.",wander home early darkness winter evening violent outbreak drunken mother sobb long draw sob pain weariness see little way tall know figure friend dress suit black white neckcloth pace brisk measure step light street feel afraid speak follow little distance stop iron gate large building unlock pass arched doorway heavy key open fold door enter child steal pause few minute tremble threshold gleam light light tempt venture few step push little way open inner door cover crimson baize enable peep inside grow bold degree creep draw door place partial gloom kindle gaslight minute light strike grandeur stand carpet aisle high oaken pew side black ebony gallery same dark old oak run wall rest massive pillar conceal gaze eager eye mount pulpit step kindle light disclose curious delight glitter pipe organ slow soft foot chapel keeper disappear moment vestry avail short absence steal shelter dark pew reach step organ loft golden show moment appear array long gown black serge stand spell bound gaze strange appearance patron eye fall strike speechless minute air amazement dismay grave face 
5,"“Come, now,” he exclaimed, harshly, as soon as he could recover his presence of mind, “you must take yourself out of this. This isn’t any place for such as you. It’s for ladies and gentlemen; so you must run away sharp before any body comes. How did you ever find your way here?”",come exclaim recover presence mind take place such lady gentleman run sharp body come find way 
6,"He had come very close to her, and bent down to whisper in her ear, looking nervously round to the entrance all the time. Jessica’s eager tongue was loosened.",come close bend whisper ear look entrance time eager tongue loosen 
7,"“Mother beat me,” she said, “and turned me into the streets, and I see you there, so I followed you up. I’ll run away this minute, Mr. Daniel; but it’s a nice place. What do the ladies and gentlemen do when they come here? Tell me, and I’ll be off sharp.”",mother beat say turn street see follow run minute nice place lady gentleman do come tell sharp 
8,"“They come here to pray,” whispered Daniel.",come pray whisper 
9,“What is pray?” asked Jessica.,pray ask 
10,"“Bless the child!” cried Daniel, in perplexity. “Why, they kneel down in those pews; most of them sit, though; and the minister up in the pulpit tells God what they want.”",bless child cry perplexity kneel pew most sit minister pulpit tell want 
11,Jessica gazed into his face with such an air of bewilderment that a faint smile crept over the sedate features of the pew-opener.,gaze face air bewilderment faint smile creep sedate feature pew opener 
12,"“What is a minister and God?” she said; “and do ladies and gentlemen want any thing? I thought they’d every thing they wanted, Mr. Daniel.”",minister say lady gentleman want thing think thing want 
13,"“Oh!” cried Daniel, “you must be off, you know. They’ll be coming in a minute, and they’d be shocked to see a ragged little heathen like you. This is the pulpit, where the minister stands and preaches to ’em; and there are the pews, where they sit to listen to him, or to go to sleep, may be; and that’s the organ to play music to their singing. There, I’ve told you every thing, and you must never come again; never.”",cry know come minute shocked see ragged little heathen pulpit minister stand preach be pew sit listen go sleep organ play music singing tell thing come 
14,"“Mr. Daniel,” said Jessica, “I don’t know nothing about it. Isn’t there a dark little corner somewhere that I could hide in?”",say know be dark little corner hide 
15,"“No, no,” interrupted Daniel impatiently; “we couldn’t do with such a little heathen, with no shoes or bonnet on. Come, now, it’s only a quarter to the time, and somebody will be here in a minute. Run away, do!”",interrupt do little heathen shoe bonnet come quarter time minute run do 
16,"Jessica retraced her steps slowly to the crimson door, casting many a longing look backwards; but Mr. Daniel stood at the end of the aisle, frowning upon her whenever she glanced behind. She gained the lobby at last, but already some one was approaching the chapel door, and beneath the lamp at the gate stood one of her natural enemies, a policeman. Her heart beat fast, but she was quickwitted, and in another instant she spied a place of concealment behind one of the doors, into which she crept for safety until the policeman passed on upon his beat.",retrace step crimson door cast many longing look stand end aisle frown glance gain lobby last one approach chapel door lamp gate stand natural enemy policeman heart beat quickwitt instant spy place concealment door creep safety policeman pass beat 
17," The congregation began to arrive quickly. She heard the rustling of silk dresses, and she could see the gentlemen and ladies pass by the niche between the door and the post. Once she ventured to stretch out a thin little finger and touch a velvet mantle as the wearer of it swept by, but no one caught her in the act, or suspected her presence behind the door. Mr. Daniel, she could see, was very busy ushering the people to their seats; but there was a startled look lingering upon his face, and every now and then he peered anxiously into the outer gloom and darkness, and even once called to the policeman to ask if he had seen a ragged child hanging about. After a while the organ began to sound, and Jessica crouched down in her hiding-place, listening entranced to the sweet music. She could not tell what made her cry, but the tears came so rapidly that it was of no use to rub the corners of her eyes with her hard knuckles; so she lay down upon the ground and buried her face in her hands and wept without restraint. When the singing was over she could only catch a confused sound of a voice speaking. The lobby was empty now, and the crimson doors closed. The policeman also had walked on. This was the moment to escape. She raised herself from the ground with a feeling of weariness and sorrow; and thinking sadly of the light, and warmth, and music that were within the closed doors, she stepped out into the cold and darkness of the streets, and loitered homeward with a heavy heart.",congregation begin arrive hear rustling silk dress see gentleman lady pass niche door post venture stretch thin little finger touch velvet mantle wearer sweep catch act suspect presence door see busy usher person seat be startle look linger face peer outer gloom darkness call policeman ask see ragged child hang while organ begin sound crouch hiding place listen entrance sweet music tell make cry tear come use rub corner eye hard knuckle lay ground bury face hand goot restraint singing catch confuse sound voice speak lobby empty crimson door close policeman walk moment escape raise ground feeling weariness sorrow think light warmth music close door step cold darkness street loiter heavy heart
