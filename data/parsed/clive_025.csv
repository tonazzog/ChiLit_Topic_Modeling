1,CHAPTER 24. Mounted Infantry.,mount infantry 
2," A few days after Plassey, Colonel Clive sent for Charlie.",few day send 
3,"""Marryat,"" he said, ""I must send you back, with two hundred men, to Madras. The governor there has been writing to me, by every ship which has come up the coast, begging me to move down with the bulk of the force, as soon as affairs are a little settled here. That is out of the question. There are innumerable matters to be arranged. Meer Jaffier must be sustained. The French under Law must be driven entirely out of Bengal. The Dutch must be dealt with. Altogether, I have need of every moment of my time, and of every man under my orders, for at least two years.",say send man governor write ship come coast begg move bulk force affair little settle question be innumerable matter arrange sustain drive deal need moment time man order least year 
4,"""However, I shall at once raise a Bengal native army, and so release the Sepoys of Madras. If there be any special and sore need, I must, of course, denude myself here of troops, to succour Madras; but I hope it will not come to that. In the meantime, I propose that you shall take back two hundred of the Madras Europeans. Lawrence will be glad to have you, and your chances of fighting are greater there than they will be here. Bengal is overawed, and so long as I maintain the force I now have, it is unlikely in the extreme to rise; whereas battles and sieges, great and small, are the normal condition of Madras.""",raise native army release be special sore need course denude troops succour hope come meantime propose take glad have chance fighting great overawed maintain force have unlikely extreme rise battle siege great small normal condition 
5,"The next day Charlie, with two hundred European troops, marched down towards Calcutta. Clive had told him to select any officer he pleased to accompany him, as second in command; and he chose Peters, who, seeing that there were likely to be far more exciting times in Madras than in Bengal at present, was very glad to accompany him. Three days after reaching Calcutta, Charlie and his party embarked on board a ship, which conveyed them without adventure to Madras.",next day european troops march tell select officer pleased accompany second command choose see be likely exciting time present glad accompany day reach party embark board ship convey adventure 
6,"The authorities were glad, indeed, of the reinforcement; for the country was disturbed from end to end. Since the departure of every available man for Calcutta, the Company had been able to afford but little aid to Muhammud Ali, and the authority of the latter had dwindled to a mere shadow, in the Carnatic. The Mahrattas made incursions in all directions. The minor chiefs revolted and refused to pay tribute, and many of them entered into alliance with the French. Disorder everywhere reigned in the Carnatic, and Trichinopoli was, again, the one place which Muhammud Ali held.",authority glad reinforcement country disturb end end departure available man company able afford little aid authority latter dwindle mere shadow make incursion direction minor chief revolt refuse pay tribute many enter alliance disorder reign place hold 
7,"The evening after landing, Charlie Marryat had a long chat with Colonel Lawrence; who, after explaining to him exactly the condition of affairs in the country, asked him to tell him, frankly, what command he would like to receive.",evening landing have long chat explain condition affair country ask tell command like receive 
8,"""I have thought for some time,"" Charlie said, ""that the establishment of a small force of really efficient cavalry, trained to act as infantry, also, would be invaluable. The Mahratta horsemen, by their rapid movements, set our infantry in defiance; and the native horse of our allies are useless against them. I am convinced that two hundred horsemen, trained and drilled like our cavalry at home, would ride through any number of them. In a country like this, where every petty rajah has his castle, cavalry alone could, however, do little. They must be able to act as infantry, and should have a couple of little four-pounders to take about with them. A force like this would do more to keep order in the Carnatic than one composed of infantry, alone, of ten times its strength. It could act as a police force, call upon petty chiefs who refuse to pay their share of the revenue, restore order in disturbed places, and permit the peasants to carry on their agricultural work, upon which the revenue of the Company depends; and, altogether, render valuable services.",think time say establishment small force efficient cavalry train act infantry invaluable horsemen rapid movement set infantry defiance native horse ally useless convinced horsemen train drill cavalry home ride number country petty rajah have castle cavalry do little able act infantry have couple little pounder take force do more keep order compose infantry alone time strength act police force call petty chief refuse pay share revenue restore order disturb place permit peasant carry agricultural work revenue company depend render valuable service 
9,"""Among the soldiers who came down with me is a sergeant who was at one time a trooper in an English regiment. He exchanged to come out with the 39th to India, and has again exchanged into the Company's service. I would make him drill instructor, if you will give him a commission as ensign. Peters I should like as my second in command; and, if you approve of the plan, I should be very much obliged if you would get him his step as captain. He's a good officer, but has not had such luck as I have.""",soldier come sergeant time trooper english regiment exchange come 39th exchange company service make drill instructor give commission ensign like second command approve plan oblige get step captain good officer have such luck have 
10,"Colonel Lawrence was very much pleased at the idea, and gave Charlie full authority to carry it out. The work of enlistment at once commenced. Hossein made an excellent recruiting sergeant. He went into the native bazaars; and by telling of the exploits of Charlie at Ambur and Suwarndrug, and holding out bright prospects of the plunder which such a force would be likely to obtain, he succeeded in recruiting a hundred and fifty of his co-religionists. In those days, fighting was a trade in India; and in addition to the restless spirits of the local communities, great numbers of the hardy natives of northern India, Afghans, Pathans, and others, were scattered over India, ever ready to enlist in the service of the highest bidder. Among such men as these, Hossein had no difficulty in obtaining a hundred and fifty picked horsemen.",pleased idea give full authority carry work enlistment commence make excellent recruiting sergeant go native bazaar tell exploit hold bright prospect plunder force likely obtain succeed recruiting co-religionist day fighting trade addition restless spirit local community great number hardy native northern other scatter ready enlist service high bidder such man have difficulty obtain pick horsemen 
11,"Charlie had determined that his force should consist of four troops, each of fifty strong. Of these one would be composed of Europeans, and he was permitted to take this number from the party he had brought down. He had no difficulty in obtaining volunteers, for as soon as the nature of the force was known, the men were eager to engage in it. To this troop, the two little field pieces would be committed.",determine force consist troops strong compose permit take number party bring have difficulty obtain volunteer nature force know man eager engage troop little field piece commit 
12,"A few days after the scheme had been sanctioned, Ensign Anstey was at work drilling the recruits as cavalry. Charlie and Peters were instructed by him, also, in the drill and words of command, and were soon able to assist. Two months were spent in severe work and, at the end of that time, the little regiment were able to execute all simple cavalry manoeuvres with steadiness and regularity. The natives were all men who had lived on horseback from their youth, and therefore required no teaching to ride.",few day scheme sanction work drill recruit cavalry instruct drill word command able assist month spend severe work end time little regiment able execute simple cavalry manoeuvre steadiness regularity native man live horseback youth require teaching ride 
13,"They were also, at the end of that time, able to act as infantry, with as much regularity as the ordinary Sepoys. When so engaged, four horses were held by one man, so that a hundred and fifty men were available for fighting on foot.",end time able act infantry much regularity ordinary sepoy engage horse hold man man available fight foot 
14,"The work had been unusually severe, but as the officers did not spare themselves, and Charlie had promised a present to each man of the troop, when fit for service, they had worked with alacrity, and had taken great interest in learning their new duties. At the end of two months, they were inspected by Colonel Lawrence and Governor Pigot, and both expressed their highest gratification and surprise at their efficiency, and anticipated great benefits would arise from the organization.",work severe officer spare promise present man troop fit service work alacrity take great interest learn new duty end month inspect express high gratification surprise efficiency anticipate great benefit arise organization 
15,"So urgent, indeed, was the necessity that something should be done for the restoration of order, that Charlie had with difficulty obtained the two months necessary to attain the degree of perfection which he deemed necessary.",urgent necessity do restoration order have difficulty obtain month necessary attain degree perfection deem necessary 
16,"The day after the inspection, the troop marched out from Madras. Ensign Anstey commanded the white troop, the other three were led by native officers. Captain Peters commanded the squadron composed of the white troop and one of the others. A Lieutenant Hallowes, whom Peters knew to be a hard working and energetic officer, was, at Charlie's request, appointed to the command of the other squadron. He himself commanded the whole.",day inspection troop march command white troop other lead native officer command squadron compose white troop other know hard work energetic officer request appoint command other squadron command whole 
17,"They had been ordered, in the first place, to move to Arcot, which was held by a garrison of Muhammud Ali. The whole of the country around was greatly disturbed. French intrigues, and the sight of the diminished power of the English, had caused most of the minor chiefs in that neighbourhood to throw off their allegiance. A body of Mahratta horse were ravaging the country districts; and it was against these that Charlie determined, in the first place, to act.",order first place move hold garrison whole country disturb french intrigue sight diminish power cause most minor chief neighbourhood throw allegiance body horse ravage country district determine first place act 
18,"He had been permitted to have his own way in the clothing and arming of his force. Each man carried a musket, which had been shortened some six inches, and hung in slings from the saddle, the muzzle resting in a piece of leather, technically termed a bucket. The ammunition pouch was slung on the other side of the saddle, and could be fastened in an instant, by two straps, to the belts which the troopers wore round their waists. The men were dressed in brown, thick cotton cloth, called karkee. Round their black forage caps was wound a long length of blue and white cotton cloth, forming a turban, with the ends hanging down to protect the back of the neck and spine from the sun.",permit have own way clothing arming force man carry musket shorten inch hang sling saddle muzzle rest piece leather term bucket ammunition pouch sling other side saddle fasten instant strap belt trooper wear waist man dress brown thick cotton cloth call karkee black forage cap wind long length blue white cotton cloth form turban end hang protect back neck spine sun 
19,"Having obtained news that the Mahratta horse, two thousand strong, were pillaging at a distance of six miles from the town, Charlie set off the day following his arrival to meet them. The Mahrattas had notice of his coming; but hearing that the force consisted only of two hundred horse, they regarded it with contempt.",obtain news horse strong pillage distance mile town set day follow arrival meet have notice come hear force consist horse regard contempt 
20,"When Charlie first came upon them they were in the open country; and, seeing that they were prepared to attack him, he drew up his little force in two lines. The second line he ordered to dismount, to act as infantry. The two guns were loaded with grape, and the men of the first line were drawn up at sufficient intervals to allow an infantryman to pass between each horse.",come open country see prepare attack draw little force line second line order dismount act infantry gun load grape man first line draw sufficient interval allow infantryman pass horse 
21,"With shouts of anticipated triumph, the Mahratta horse swept down. The front line of English horsemen had screened the movements of those behind, and when the enemy were within fifty yards, Charlie gave the word. The troopers already sat, musket in hand, and between each horse an infantry soldier now stepped forward; while towards each end, the line opened and the two field pieces were advanced.",shout anticipate triumph horse sweep front line english horsemen screen movement enemy yard give word trooper sit musket hand horse infantry soldier step end line open field piece advance 
22,"The Mahratta horsemen were astonished at this sudden manoeuvre; but, pressed by the mass from behind, they still continued their charge. When but fifteen yards from the English line, a stream of fire ran along this, from end to end. Every musket was emptied into the advancing force, while the guns on either flank swept them with grape.",horsemen astonished sudden manoeuvre press mass continue charge yard english line stream fire run end end musket empty advance force gun flank sweep grape 
23,"The effect was tremendous. Scarcely a man of the front line survived the fire, and the whole mass halted, and recoiled in confusion. Before they could recover themselves, another volley of shot and grape was fired into them. Then Charlie's infantry ran back; and the cavalry, closing up, dashed upon the foe, followed half a minute afterwards by the lately dismounted men of the other two troops; ten white soldiers, alone, remaining to work and guard the guns.",effect tremendous man front line survive fire whole mass halt recoil confusion recover volley shot grape fire infantry run cavalry close dash foe follow minute dismount man other troops white soldier remain work guard gun 
24,"The effect of the charge of these two hundred disciplined horse, upon the already disorganized mob of Mahratta horsemen, was irresistible; and in a few minutes the Mahrattas were scattered, and in full flight over the plain, pursued by the British cavalry, now broken up into eight half troops. The rout was complete, and in a very short time the last Mahratta had fled, leaving behind them three hundred dead upon the plain.",effect charge disciplined horse disorganized mob horsemen irresistible few minute scatter full flight plain pursue british cavalry break half troops rout complete short time last flead leave dead plain 
25,"Greatly gratified with their success; and feeling confident, now, in their own powers, the British force returned to Arcot.",gratified success feel confident own power british force return 
26,"Charlie now determined to attack the fort of Vellore, which was regarded as impregnable. The town lay at the foot of some very steep and rugged hills, which were surmounted by three detached forts. The rajah, encouraged by the French, had renounced his allegiance to Muhammud Ali, and had declared himself independent. As, however, it was certain that he was prepared to give assistance to the French, when they took the field against the English, Charlie determined to attack the place.",determine attack regard impregnable town lay foot steep rugged hill surmount detach fort encourage renounce allegiance declare independent certain prepare give assistance take field determine attack place 
27,"The French had received large reinforcements, and had already captured many forts and strong places, around Pondicherry. They were, however, awaiting the arrival of still larger forces, known to be on the way, before they made a decisive and, as they hoped, final attack upon the English.",receive large reinforcement capture many fort strong place await arrival large force know way make decisive hope final attack 
28,"The rajah's army consisted of some fifteen hundred infantry, and as many cavalry. These advanced to meet the English force. Charlie feigned a retreat, as they came on; and retired to a village, some thirty miles distant. The cavalry pursued at full speed, leaving the infantry behind.",army consist infantry many cavalry advance meet english force feign retreat come retire village mile distant cavalry pursue full speed leave infantry 
29,"Upon reaching the village, Charlie at once dismounted all his men, lined the inclosures, and received the enemy's cavalry, as they galloped up, with so heavy a fire that they speedily drew rein. After trying for some time to force the position, they began to fall back; and the English force again mounted, dashed upon them, and completed their defeat. The broken horsemen, as they rode across the plain, met their infantry advancing; and these, disheartened at the defeat of the cavalry, fell back in great haste; and, abandoning the town, which was without fortification, retired at once to the forts commanding it.",reach village dismount man line inclosure receive enemy cavalry gallop heavy fire draw rein try time force position begin fall english force mount dash complete defeat break horsemen ride plain meet infantry advance disheartened defeat cavalry fall great haste abandon town fortification retire fort commanding 
30,"Charlie took possession of the town, and spent the next two days in reconnoitering the forts. The largest, and nearest, of these faced the right of the town. It was called Suzarow. The second, on an even steeper hill, was called Guzarow. The third, which lay some distance behind this, and was much smaller, was called Mortz Azur.",take possession town spend next day reconnoiter fort large near face right town call second steeper hill call third lay distance small call 
31,"Charlie determined to attempt, in the first place, to carry Guzarow; as in this, which was considered the most inaccessible, the rajah himself had taken up his position, having with him all his treasure. Charlie saw that it would be next to impossible, with so small a force, to carry it by a direct attack, by the road which led to it, as this was completely covered by its guns. It appeared to him, however, that the rocks upon which it stood were, by no means, inaccessible.",determine attempt first place carry consider inaccessible take position have treasure see next impossible small force carry direct attack road lead cover gun appear rock stand means inaccessible 
32,"He left twenty men to guard his guns, placed a guard of ten upon the road leading up to the fort, to prevent the inhabitants from sending up news of his intentions to the garrison, who had, with that of Suzarow, kept up a fire from their guns upon the town, since his arrival there. The moon was not to rise until eleven o'clock, and at nine Charlie marched, with a hundred and seventy men, from the town. Making a considerable detour, he found himself, at half past ten, at the foot of the rocks, rising almost sheer from the upper part of the hill.",leave man guard gun place guard road lead fort prevent inhabitant send news intention garrison keep fire gun town arrival moon rise o'clock march man town make considerable detour find half foot rock rise sheer upper part hill 
33,"He was well provided with ropes and ladders. The most perfect silence had been enjoined upon the men and, in the darkness, the march had been unseen by the enemy. While waiting for the moon to rise, the troopers all wound pieces of cloth, with which they had come provided, round their boots, to prevent these from making a noise, by slipping or stumbling on the rocks.",provide rope ladder perfect silence enjoin man darkness march unseen enemy wait moon rise trooper wind piece cloth come provide boot prevent make noise slip stumble rock 
34,"When the moon rose, the ascent of the rocks began at the point which Charlie had, after a close inspection through a telescope, judged to be most accessible. The toil was very severe. One by one, the men climbed from ledge to ledge, some of the most active hill men, from northern India, leading the way, and aiding their comrades to follow them, by lowering ropes, and placing ladders at the most inaccessible spots. All this time, they were completely hidden from the observation of the garrison, above.",moon rise ascent rock begin point close inspection telescope judge accessible toil severe man climb ledge ledge active hill man northern lead way aid comrade follow lower rope place ladder inaccessible spot time hide observation garrison 
35,"At last, the leaders of the party stood at the foot of the walls, which rose a few feet from the edge of the cliff. The operation had been performed almost noiselessly. The ammunition pouches had been left behind, each man carrying ten rounds in his belt. Every piece of metal had been carefully removed from their uniforms, the very buttons having been cut off, lest these should strike against the rocks; and the muskets had been swathed up in thick coverings.",last leader party stand foot wall rise few foot edge cliff operation perform ammunition pouch leave man carry round belt piece metal remove uniform very button cut strike rock musket swath thick covering 
36,"The men, as they gained the upper ridge, spread along at the foot of the walls, until the whole body had gathered there. They could hear the voices of the sentries, thirty feet above them; but these, having no idea of the vicinity of an enemy, did not look over the edge of the wall. Indeed, the parapets of the Indian fortifications were always so high, that it was only from projecting towers that the foot of the wall could be seen.",man gain upper ridge spread foot wall whole body gather hear voice sentry foot have idea vicinity enemy look edge wall parapet indian fortification high project tower foot wall see 
37,"When the English force were assembled, the ladders, which, like everything else, had been muffled, were placed against the walls; and, headed by their officers, the troops ascended. The surprise was complete. Not until the leaders of the storming party stood upon the parapet was their presence perceived. The guards discharged their firelocks, and fled hastily.",english force assemble ladder else muffle place wall head officer troops ascend surprise complete leader storming party stand parapet presence perceive guard discharge firelock flead 
38,"As soon as twenty men were collected on the wall, Charlie took the command of these, and hurried forward towards the gate. Hallowes was to lead the next party along the opposite direction. Peters was to form the rest up, as they gained the wall, and to follow Charlie with fifty more; while Anstey was to hold the remainder in reserve, to be used as circumstances might demand.",man collect wall take command hurry gate lead next party opposite direction form rest gain wall follow more hold remainder reserve use circumstance demand 
39,"The resistance, however, was slight. Taken absolutely by surprise, the enemy rushed out from their sleeping places. They were immediately fired upon from the walls. The greater part ran back into shelter, while some of the more determined, gathering together, made for the gate. But of this Charlie had already taken possession, and received them with so vigorous a fire that they speedily fell back.",resistance slight take surprise enemy rush sleeping place fire wall great part run shelter determine gather make gate take possession receive vigorous fire fall 
40,"When the whole circuit of the walls was in his possession, Charlie took a hundred of his men, and descended into the fort. Each building, as he reached it, was searched; and the garrison it contained made to come out, and lay down their arms, and were then allowed to depart through the gate.",whole circuit wall possession take man descend fort building reach search garrison contain make come lay arm allow depart gate 
41,"Upon reaching the rajah's quarters, he at once came out and surrendered himself. Two guns were discharged, to inform the little body in the town of the complete success of the movement; and the guard on the road then fell back, and joined the party with the guns.",reach quarter come surrender gun discharge inform little body town complete success movement guard road fall join party gun 
42,"Thus, without losing a man, the fort of Guzarow, regarded by the natives as being impregnable, was carried. Fifteen lacs of rupees were found in the treasury. Of these, in accordance with the rules of the service, half was set aside for the Company, the remainder became the property of the force. Of this half fell to the officers, in proportion to their rank, and the rest was divided among the men. The share of each trooper amounted to nearly two hundred pounds.",lose man regard native impregnable carry lac rupee find treasury accordance rule service half set company remainder become property force half fall officer proportion rank rest divide man share trooper amount pound 
43,"Knowing how demoralizing the possession of such a sum would be, Charlie assembled his force next morning. He pointed out to them that, as the greater part of the plunder was in silver, it would be impossible for them to carry it on their persons. He advised them, then, to allow the whole sum to remain in the treasury, to be forwarded under an escort to Madras; each soldier to receive an order, for the amount of his share, upon the treasury there. This was agreed to, unanimously, and Charlie then turned his attention to the other forts.",know demoralize possession sum assemble force next morning point great part plunder silver impossible carry person advise allow whole sum remain treasury forward escort soldier receive order amount share treasury agree turn attention other fort 
44,"The guns of Guzarow were turned against these, and a bombardment commenced. Suzarow, which extended partly down the slope, was much exposed to the fire from Guzarow; and although no damage could be done to the walls at so great a distance, the garrison, suffering from the fire, and intimidated by the fall of Guzarow, lost heart. Large numbers deserted, and the governor, in the course of two days, thought it prudent to obey the orders which the rajah had, upon being made captive, sent to him to surrender. The next day the governor of Mortz Azur followed his example; and Vellore, and its three strong forts, were thus in the possession of the English.",gun turn bombardment commence extend slope expose fire damage do wall great distance garrison suffer fire intimidate fall lose heart large number desert governor course day think prudent obey order have make captive send surrender next day governor follow example strong fort possession 
45,"At Vellore, Charlie nearly lost one of his faithful followers. Early in the morning, Hossein came into Charlie's room.",lose faithful follower morning come room 
46,"""Sahib,"" he said, ""something is the matter with Tim.""",say matter 
47,"""What is the matter?"" Charlie said, sitting up in his bed.",matter say sit bed 
48,"""I do not know, sahib. When I went to him, he did not move. He was wide awake, and his eyes are staring. When I went beside him, he shook his head a little, and said, 'S-s-s-h.' He seems quite rigid, and is as pale as death.""",know go move wide awake eye stare go shake head little say seem rigid pale death 
49,"Charlie leaped out, and hurried to Tim. The latter was lying on the ground, in the next room. He had carried off three or four cushions, from the rajah's divan, and had thrown these down, and had spread a rug over him. He lay on his back, exactly as Hossein had described.",leap hurry latter lie ground next room carry cushion rajah divan throw spread rug lay back describe 
50,"As Charlie hurried up, Tim again gave vent to the warning ""S-s-s-h.""",hurry give vent warning 
51,"""What is the matter, Tim? What is the matter, my poor fellow?""",matter matter poor fellow 
52,"Tim made a slight motion, with his head, for his master to bend towards him. Charlie leant over him, and he whispered:",make slight motion head master bend lean whisper 
53,"""There is a sarpent in bed with me.""",be sarpent bed 
54,"""Are you quite sure, Tim?""",sure 
55,"""He woke me with his cold touch,"" Tim whispered. ""I felt him crawling against my foot, and now he is laying against my leg.""",wake cold touch whisper feel crawl foot lay leg 
56,"Charlie drew back for a minute, and consulted with Hossein.",draw minute consult 
57,"""Lie quite still, Tim,"" he said, ""and don't be afraid. We will try to kill him, without his touching you; but even if he should bite you, with help ready at hand, there will be no danger.""",lie say afraid try kill touch bite help ready hand be danger 
58,"Charlie now procured two knives; the one a sharp surgical knife, from a case which he had brought; the other he placed in a charcoal fire, which one of the men speedily fanned, until the blade had attained a white heat. Charlie had decided that, if the snake bit Tim, he would instantly make a deep cut through the line of the puncture of the fangs, cutting down as low as these could penetrate, and immediately cauterize it, by placing the hot knife in the gash so made. Six men were called in, with orders to seize Tim on the instant, and hold his leg firm, to enable the operation to be performed. Two others were to occupy themselves with the snake. These were armed with sticks.",procure knife one sharp surgical knife case bring other place charcoal fire man fann blade attain white heat decide snake bite make deep cut line puncture fang cut low penetrate cauterize place hot knife gash make man call order seize instant hold leg firm enable operation perform other occupy snake armed stick 
59,"Hossein now approached the bed, from which, hitherto, they had all kept well aloof. The snake, Tim said, lay against his leg, between the knee and the ankle, and the spot was marked by a slight elevation of the rug.",approach bed keep aloof snake say lay leg knee ankle spot mark slight elevation rug 
60,"Hossein drew his tulwar, examined the edge to see that nothing had blunted its razor-like keenness, and then took his stand at the foot of the bed. Twice he raised his weapon; and then let it fall, with a drawing motion. The keen blade cut through the rug, as if it had been pasteboard; and, at the same instant, Tim sprang from the other side of the bed, and fainted in the arms of the men. Hossein threw off the rug, and there, severed in pieces, lay the writhing body of a huge cobra.",draw tulwar examine edge see blunt razor like keenness take stand foot bed raise weapon let fall draw motion keen blade cut rug pasteboard same instant spring other side bed faint arm man throw rug sever piece lay writhing body huge cobra 
61,"Tim soon recovered, under the administration of water sprinkled in his face, and brandy poured down his throat. But he was some time, ere he thoroughly recovered from the effects of the trying ordeal through which he had passed. Many of the buildings in the fort were in a very bad condition, and Charlie had several of the most dilapidated destroyed, finding in their walls several colonies of cobras, which were all killed by the troops.",recover administration water sprinkle face brandy pour throat time recover effect try ordeal pass many building fort bad condition have several dilapidated destroy find wall several colony cobra kill troops
