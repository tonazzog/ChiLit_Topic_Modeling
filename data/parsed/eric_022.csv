5,"""Yes; too late for football, too early for cricket."" And Wildney stretched himself and yawned.",late football cricket stretch yawn

11,"On opening it they found it rich in dainties, among which were a pair of fowls and a large plum-cake.",open find rich dainty pair fowl large plum cake

13,"""Very well; only let's have it _before_ prayers, because we were so nearly caught last time.""",let have _before_ prayer catch last time 
14,"""Ay, and let it be in one of the class-rooms, Eric; not up here, lest we have another incursion of the 'Rosebuds.' I shall have to cut preparation, but that don't matter, It's Harley's night, and old Stupid will never twig.""",let class room have incursion have cut preparation matter night old stupid twig

17,"""Good; and Graham,"" suggested Eric. He and Wildney regarded their possessions so much as common property, that he hadn't the least delicacy in mentioning the boys whom he wanted to invite.",good suggest regard possession much common property least delicacy mention boy want invite

27,"""Yes; but two fowls isn't enough for six hungry boys.""",fowl enough hungry boy 
28,"""No, it isn't,"" said Wildney. He thought a little, and then, clapping his hands, danced about and said, ""Are you game for a _regular_ lark, Eric?""",say think little clap hand dance say game lark 
29,"""Yes; anything to make it less dull. I declare I've very nearly been taking to work again to fill up the time.""",make dull declare take work fill time 
30,"Eric often talked now of work in this slighting way partly as an excuse for the low places in form to which he was gradually sinking. Everybody knew that had he properly exerted his abilities he was capable of beating almost any boy; so, to quiet his conscience, he professed to ridicule diligence as an unboyish piece of muffishness, and was never slow to sneer at the ""grinders,"" as he contemptuously called all those who laid themselves out to win school distinctions.",talk work slight way excuse low place form sink know exert ability capable beat boy quiet conscience profess ridicule diligence unboyish piece muffishness slow sneer grinder call lay win school distinction 
31,"""Ha, ha!"" said Wildney, ""that's rather good! No, Eric, it's too late for you to turn 'grinder' now. I might as well think of doing it myself, and I've never been higher than five from lag in my form yet.""",say good late turn grinder think do high lag form 
32,"""Haven't you? But what's the regular lark you hinted at?""",regular lark hint 
33,"""Why, we'll go and seize the Gordonites' _pigeons_, and make another dish of them.""",go seize _pigeons_ make dish

37,"""Stealing?"" said Wildney, with a loud laugh. ""Pooh! '_convey_ the wise call it.'""",steal say loud laugh wise call 
38,"But Eric still looked serious. ""Why, my dear old boy,"" continued Wildney, ""the Gordonites'll be the first to laugh at the trick when we tell them of it next morning, as of course we will do. There, now, don't look grumpy. I shall cut away and arrange it with. Graham, and tell you the whole dodge ready prepared to-night at bed-time.""",look serious dear old boy continue first laugh trick tell next morning course do look grumpy cut arrange tell whole dodge ready prepare night bed time 
39,"After lights were put out, Wildney came up to the study according to promise, and threw out hints about the proposed plan. He didn't tell it plainly, because Duncan was there, but Duncan caught enough to guess what was intended, and said, when Wildney had gone--",light put come study accord promise throw hint propose plan tell catch guess intend say go 
40,"""Take my advice, and have nothing to do with this, Eric.""",take advice have do 
41,"Eric had grown very touchy lately about advice, particularly from any fellow of his own standing; and after the checks he had recently received, a coolness had sprung up between him and nearly all the study-boys, which made him more than ever inclined to assert his independence, and defy and thwart them in every way.",grow touchy advice fellow own standing check receive coolness spring study boy make more inclined assert independence defy thwart way 
42,"""Keep your advice to yourself, Duncan, till it's asked for,"" he answered, roughly. ""You've done nothing but _advise_ lately, and I'm rather sick of it.""",keep advice ask answer do _advise_ sick 
43,"""Comme vous voulez,"" replied Duncan, with a shrug. ""Gang your own gait; I'll have nothing more to do with trying to stop you, since you _will_ ruin yourself.""",reply shrug gang own gait have more do try stop ruin 
44,"Nothing more was said in the study that evening, and when Eric went down he didn't even bid Duncan goodnight.",more say study evening go bid goodnight 
45,"""Charlie,"" he said, as he stole on tiptoe into Wildney's dormitory.",say steal tiptoe dormitory 
46,"""Hush!"" whispered Wildney, ""the other fellows are asleep. Come and sit by my bedside, and I'll tell you what we're going to do.""",whisper other fellow asleep come sit bedside tell go do 
47,"Eric went and sat by him, and he sat up in his bed ""First of all, _you're_ to keep awake till twelve to-night,"" he whispered; ""old Rowley'll have gone round by that time, and it'll be all safe. Then come and awake me again, and I'll watch till one, Pietrie till two, and Graham till three. Then Graham'll awake us all, and we'll dress.""",go sit sit bed first _you're_ keep awake night whisper old go time safe come awake watch awake dress

49,"""Oh, I'll manage that,"" said Wildney, chuckling. ""But come again and awake me at twelve, will you?""",manage say chuckle come awake 
50,"Eric went to his room and lay down, but he didn't take off his clothes, for fear he should go to sleep. Dr. Rowlands came round as usual at eleven, and then Eric closed his eyes for a few minutes, till the head-master had disappeared. After that he lay awake thinking for an hour, but his thoughts weren't very pleasant.",go room lay take clothes fear go sleep come usual close eye few minute head master disappear lay think hour thought pleasant 
51,At twelve he went and awoke Wildney.,go awoke 
52,"""I don't feel very sleepy. Shall I sit with you for your hour, Charlie?""",feel sleepy sit hour 
53,"""Oh, do! I should like it of all things. But douse the glim there; we shan't want it, and it might give the alarm.""",do like thing douse glim want give alarm 
54,"""All right.""",right 
55,"So Eric went and sat by his dangerous little friend, and they talked in low voices until they heard the great school clock strike one. They then woke Pietrie, and Eric went off to bed again.",go sit dangerous little friend talk low voice hear great school clock strike wake go bed 
56,"At three Graham awoke him, and dressing hastily, he joined the others in the lavatory.",awoke dress join other lavatory 
57,"""Now, I'm going to get the key,"" said Wildney, ""and mean to have a stomach-ache for the purpose.""",go get key say mean have stomach ache purpose 
58,"Laughing quietly he went up to the door of Mr. Harley's bed-room, which opened out of the lavatory, and knocked.",laugh go door bed room open lavatory knock 
59,No answer. He knocked a little louder. Still no answer. Louder still.,answer knock little louder answer 
60,"""Bother the fellow,"" said Wildney; ""he sleeps like a grampus. Won't one of you try to wake him?""",bother fellow say sleep grampus try wake 
61,"""No,"" said Graham; ""'taint dignified for fifth-form boys to have stomach-aches.""",say taint dignified fifth form boy have stomach ache 
62,"""Well, I must try again."" But it seemed no use knocking, and Wildney at last, in a fit of impatience, thumped a regular tattoo on the bed-room door.",try seem use knock last fit impatience thump regular tattoo bed room door 
63,"""Who's there?"" said the startled voice of Mr. Harley.",say startle voice 
64,"""Only me, sir!"" answered Wildney, in a mild and innocent way.",sir answer mild innocent way 
65,"""What do you want?""",want 
66,"""Please, sir, I want the key of the lavatory. I'm indisposed,"" said Wildney again, in a tone of such disciplined suavity, that the others shook with laughing.",sir want key lavatory indispose say tone such disciplined suavity other shake laugh 
67,"Mr. Harley opened the door about an inch, and peered about suspiciously.",open door inch peer 
68,"""Oh, well, you must go and awake Mr. Rose. I don't happen to have the key to-night."" And so saying, he shut the door.",go awake happen have key night say shut door 
69,"""Phew! Here's a go!"" said Wildney, recovering immediately. ""It'll never do to awake old Rose. He'd smell a rat in no time.""",go say recover do awake old smell rat time 
70,"""I have it,"" said Pietrie. ""I've got an old nail, with which I believe I can open the lock quite simply. Let's try.""",have say get old nail believe open lock let try 
71,"""Quietly and quick, then,"" said Eric.",quick say 
72,"In ten minutes he had silently shot back the lock with the old nail, and the boys were on the landing. They carried their shoes in their hands, ran noiselessly down stairs, and went to the same window at which Eric and Wildney had got out before. Wildney had taken care beforehand to break the pane and move away the glass, so they had only to loosen the bar and slip through one by one.",minute shoot lock old nail boy landing carry shoe hand run stair go same window get take care break pane move glass have loosen bar slip 
73,"It was cold and very dark, and as on the March morning they stood out in the playground, all four would rather have been safe and harmlessly in bed. But the novelty and the excitement of the enterprise bore them up, and they started off quickly for the house at which Mr. Gordon and his pupils lived, which was about half a mile from the school. They went arm in arm to assure each other a little, for at first in their fright they were inclined to take every post and tree for a man in ambush, and to hear a recalling voice in every sound of wind and wave.",cold dark morning stand playground safe bed novelty excitement enterprise bear start house pupil live mile school go arm arm assure other little first fright inclined take post tree man ambush hear recall voice sound wind wave 
74,"Not far from Mr. Gordon's was a carpenter's shop, and outside of this there was generally a ladder standing. They had arranged to carry this ladder with them (as it was only a short one), climb the low garden wall with it, and then place it against the house, immediately under the dovecot which hung by the first story-windows. Wildney, as the lightest of the four, was to take the birds, while the others held the ladder.",carpenter shop ladder standing arrange carry ladder short one climb low garden wall place house dovecot hang first story window light take bird other hold ladder 
75,"Slanting it so that it should be as far from the side of the window as possible, Wildney ascended and thrust both hands into the cot. He succeeded in seizing a pigeon with each hand, but in doing so threw the other birds into a state of such alarm that they fluttered about in the wildest manner, and the moment his hands were withdrawn, flew out with a great flapping of hurried wings.",slant side window possible ascend thrust hand cot succeed seize pigeon hand do throw other bird state such alarm flutter wild manner moment hand withdraw fly great flap hurry wing 
76,"The noise they made alarmed the plunderer, and he hurried down the ladder as fast as he could. He handed the pigeons to the others, who instantly wrung their necks.",noise make alarm plunderer hurry ladder hand pigeon other wrung neck 
77,"""I'm nearly sure I heard somebody stir,"" said Wildney; ""we haven't been half quiet enough. Here! let's crouch down in this corner.""",sure hear stir say half quiet let crouch corner 
78,"All four shrank up as close to the wall as they could, and held their breath. Some one was certainly stirring, and at last they heard the window open. A head was thrust out, and Mr. Gordon's voice asked sternly--""Who's there?""",shrank close wall hold breath one stir last hear window open head thrust voice ask 
79,"He seemed at once to have caught sight of the ladder, and made an endeavor to reach it; but though he stretched out his arm at full length, he could not do so.",seem catch sight ladder make endeavor reach stretch arm full length do 
80,"""We must cut for it,"" said Eric; ""it's quite too dark for him to see us, or even to notice that we are boys.""",cut say dark see notice boy 
81,"They moved the ladder to the wall, and sprang over, one after the other, as fast as they could. Eric was last, and just as he got to the top of the wall he heard the back door open, and some one run out into the yard.",move ladder wall spring other last get top wall hear back door open run yard 
82,"""Run for your lives,"" said Eric hurriedly; ""it's Gordon, and he's raising the alarm.""",run life say raise alarm 
83,"They heard footsteps following them, and an occasional shout of ""thieves! thieves!""",hear footstep follow occasional shout thief thief 
84,"""We must separate and run different ways, or we've no chance of escape. We'd better turn towards the town to put them off the right scent,"" said Eric again.",separate run different way have chance escape turn town put right scent say 
85,"""Don't leave me,"" pleaded Wildney; ""you know I can't run very fast.""",leave plead know run 
86,"""No, Charlie, I won't;"" and grasping his hand, Eric hurried him over the style and through the fields, while Pietrie and Graham took the opposite direction.",grasp hand hurry style field take opposite direction 
87,"Some one (they did not know who it was, but suspected it to be Mr. Gordon's servant-man) was running after them, and they could distinctly hear his footsteps, which seemed to be half a field distant. He carried a light, and they heard him panting. They were themselves tired, and in the utmost trepidation; the usually courageous Wildney was trembling all over, and his fear communicated itself to Eric. Horrible visions of a trial for burglary, imprisonment in the castle jail, and perhaps transportation, presented themselves to their excited imaginations, as the sound of the footsteps came nearer.",one know suspect servant man run hear footstep seem field distant carry light hear pant tired utmost trepidation courageous tremble fear communicate horrible vision trial burglary imprisonment castle jail transportation present excited imagination sound footstep come 
88,"""I can't run any further, Eric,"" said Wildney. ""What shall we do? don't leave me, for heaven's sake.""",run say do leave heaven sake 
89,"""Not I, Charlie. We must hide the minute we get t'other side of this hedge.""",hide minute get t'other side hedge 
90,"They scrambled over the gate, and plunged into the thickest part of a plantation close by, lying down on the ground behind some bushes, and keeping as still as they could, taking care to cover over their white collars.",scramble gate plunge thickest part plantation lie ground bush keep take care cover white collar 
91,"The pursuer reached the gate, and no longer hearing footsteps in front of him, he paused. He went a little distance up the hedge on both sides and held up his light, but did not detect the cowering boys, and at last giving up the search in despair, went slowly home. They heard him plodding back over the field, and it was not until the sound of his footsteps had died away, that Eric cautiously broke cover, and looked over the hedge. He saw the man's light gradually getting more distant, and said, ""All right now, Charlie. We must make the best of our way home.""",pursuer reach gate hear footstep front pause go little distance hedge side hold light detect cower boy last give search despair go hear plodd field sound footstep die break cover look hedge see man light get distant say make good way 
92,"""Are you sure he's gone?"" said Wildney, who had not yet recovered from his fright.",sure gone say recover fright 
93,"""Quite; come along. I only hope Pietrie and Graham ain't caught.""",quite come hope catch 
94,"They got back about half-past four, and climbed in unheard and undetected through the window pane. They then stole up stairs with beating hearts, and sat in Eric's room to wait for the other two. To their great relief they heard them enter the lavatory about ten minutes after.",get half past climb unheard undetected window pane steal stair beat heart sit room wait other great relief hear enter lavatory minute 
95,"""Were you twigged?"" asked Wildney eagerly.",twigged ask 
96,"""No,"" said Graham; ""precious near it though. Old Gordon and some men were after us, but at last we doubled rather neatly, and escaped them. It's all serene, and we shan't be caught.""",say precious old man last double escape serene catch 
97,"""Well, we'd best to bed now,"" said Eric; ""and, to my thinking, we should be wise to keep a quiet tongue in our heads about this affair.""",good bed say thinking wise keep quiet tongue head affair 
98,"""Yes, we had better tell _no one_."" They agreed, and went off to bed again. So, next morning, they all four got up quite as if nothing had happened, and made no allusion to the preceding night, although, they could not help chuckling inwardly a little when the Gordonites came to morning school, brimful of a story about their house having been attacked in the night by thieves, who, after bagging some pigeons, had been chevied by Gordon and the servants. Wildney professed immense interest in the incident, and asked many questions, which showed that there was not a shadow of suspicion in any one's mind as to the real culprits.",have good tell _no one_ agree go bed next morning get happen make allusion preced night help chuckle little come morning school brimful story house attack night thief bagg pigeon chevied servant profess immense interest incident ask many question show be shadow suspicion mind real culprit 
99,"Carter, the school servant, didn't seem to have noticed that the lavatory door was unlocked, and Mr. Harley never alluded again to his disturbance in the night. So the theft of the pigeons remained undiscovered, and remains so till this day. If any old Roslyn boy reads this veracious history, he will doubtless be astounded to hear that the burglars on that memorable night were Brio, Pietrie, Graham, and Wildney.",school servant seem notice lavatory door unlock allude disturbance night theft pigeon remain undiscovered remain day old boy read veracious history astound hear burglar memorable night
