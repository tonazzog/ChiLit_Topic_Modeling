6,"The gentleman having come on foot, with nothing but his knapsack, had not made much sensation. There was a vague idea that he had gone on to the St. Gothard; but the guide who was likely to know, was not forthcoming, and all Guy’s inquiries only resulted in, ‘I dare say we shall hear of him elsewhere.’",gentleman come foot knapsack make much sensation be vague idea go guide likely know forthcoming guy inquiry result say hear 
7,"To tell the truth, Amabel was not much disappointed, and she could see, though he said nothing, that Guy was not very sorry. These two months had been so very happy, there had been such full enjoyment, such freedom from care and vexation, or aught that could for a moment ruffle the stream of delight. Scenery, cathedrals music, paintings, historical association, had in turn given unceasing interest and pleasure; and, above all, Amabel had been growing more and more into the depths of her husband’s mind, and entering into the grave, noble thoughts inspired by the scenes they were visiting. It had been a sort of ideal happiness, so exquisite, that she could hardly believe it real. A taste of society, which they had at Munich, though very pleasant, had only made them more glad to be alone together again; any companion would have been an interruption, and Philip, so intimate, yet with his carping, persecuting spirit towards Guy, was one of the last persons she could wish to meet; but knowing that this was by no means a disposition Guy wished to encourage, she held her peace.",tell truth disappointed see say sorry month happy be such full enjoyment such freedom care vexation aught moment ruffle stream delight scenery cathedral music painting historical association have turn give uncease interest pleasure grow depth husband mind enter grave noble thought inspire scene visit sort ideal happiness exquisite believe real taste society have pleasant make glad alone companion interruption intimate carping persecute spirit last person wish meet know means disposition guy wish encourage hold peace 
8,"For the present, no more was said about Philip; and they proceeded to Interlachen, where they spent a day or two, while Arnaud was with his relations; and they visited the two beautiful lakes of Thun and Brientz. On first coming among mountains, Amabel had been greatly afraid of the precipices, and had been very much alarmed at the way in which Guy clambered about, with a sureness of foot and steadiness of head acquired long ago on the crags of Redclyffe, and on which the guides were always complimenting him; but from seeing him always come down safe, and from having been enticed by him to several heights, which had at first seemed to her most dizzy and dangerous, she had gradually laid aside her fears, and even become slightly, very slightly, adventurous herself.",present more say proceed spend day relation visit beautiful lake first come mountain afraid precipice alarm way guy clamber sureness foot steadiness head acquire crag guide compliment see come safe entice several height first seem dizzy dangerous lay fear become adventurous 
9,"One beautiful evening, they were wandering on the side of the Beatenberg, in the little narrow paths traced by the tread of the goats and their herdsmen. Amabel sat down to try to sketch the outline of the white-capped Jung Frau and her attendant mountains, wishing she could draw as well as Laura, but intending her outline to aid in describing the scene to those whose eyes she longed to have with her. While she was drawing, Guy began to climb higher, and was soon out of sight, though she still heard him whistling. The mountains were not easy to draw, or rather she grew discontented with her black lines and white paper, compared with the dazzling snow against the blue sky, tinged by the roseate tints of the setting sun, and the dark fissures on the rocky sides, still blacker from the contrast.",beautiful evening wonder side little narrow path trace tread goat herdsmen sit try sketch outline white cap attendant mountain wish draw intend outline aid describe scene eye long have draw guy begin climb high sight hear whistle mountain easy draw grow discontent black line white paper compare dazzling snow blue sky ting roseate tint setting sun dark fissure rocky side blacker contrast 
10,"She put up her sketching materials, and began to gather some of the delightful treasury of mountain flowers. A gentle slope of grass was close to her, and on it grew, at some little distance from her, a tuft of deep purple, the beautiful Alpine saxifrage, which she well knew by description. She went to gather it, but the turf was slippery, and when once descending, she could not stop herself; and what was the horror of finding herself half slipping, half running down a slope, which became steeper every moment, till it was suddenly broken off into a sheer precipice! She screamed, and grasped with both hands at some low bushes, that grew under a rock at the side of the treacherous turf. She caught a branch, and found herself supported, by clinging to it with her hands, while she rested on the slope, now so nearly perpendicular, that to lose her hold would send her instantly down the precipice. Her whole weight seemed to depend on that slender bough, and those little hands that clenched it convulsively,--her feet felt in vain for some hold. ‘Guy! Guy!’ she shrieked again. Oh, where was he? His whistle ceased,--he heard her,--he called,",put sketching material begin gather delightful treasury mountain flower gentle slope grass close grow little distance tuft deep purple beautiful alpine saxifrage know description go gather turf slippery descend stop horror find half slip half run slope become steeper moment break sheer precipice scream grasp hand low bush grow rock side treacherous turf catch branch find support cling hand rest slope perpendicular lose hold send precipice whole weight seem depend slender bough little hand clench foot feel vain hold guy guy shriek whistle cease hear call

12,"‘Oh, help me!’ she answered. But with that moment’s joy came the horror, he could not help her--he would only fall himself. ‘Take care! don’t come on the grass!’ she cried. She must let go the branch in a short, time then a slip, the precipice,--and what would become of him? Those moments were hours.",help answer moment joy come horror help fall take care come grass cry let go branch short time slip precipice become moment hour 
13,"‘I am coming--hold fast!’ She heard his voice above her, very near. To find him so close made the agony of dread and of prayer even more intense. To be lost, with her husband scarcely a step from her! Yet how could he stand on the slippery turf, and so as to be steady enough to raise her up?",come hold hear voice find close make agony dread prayer intense lose husband step stand slippery turf steady raise

15,"It was a fearful moment. Amabel could not see him, and felt as if relinquishing her grasp of the tree was certain destruction. The instinct of self-preservation had been making her cling desperately with that left hand, especially as it held by the thicker part of the bough. But the habit of implicit confidence and obedience was stronger still; she did not hesitate, and tightening her hold with the other hand, she unclasped the left and stretched it upwards.",fearful moment see feel relinquish grasp tree certain destruction instinct self preservation make cling left hand hold thick part bough habit implicit confidence obedience strong hesitate tighten hold other hand unclasp left stretch 
16,"Joy unspeakable to feel his fingers close over her wrist, like iron, even while the bush to which she had trusted was detaching itself, almost uprooted by her weight! If she had waited a second she would have been lost, but her confidence had been her safety. A moment or two more, and with closed eyes she was leaning against him; his arm was round her, and he guided her steps, till, breathless, she found herself on the broad well-trodden path, out of sight of the precipice.",unspeakable feel finger wrist iron bush trust detach uproot weight wait second lose confidence safety moment more close eye lean arm guide step breathless find broad trodd path sight precipice

18,"She looked up and saw how pale he was, though his voice had been so steady throughout. She leant on his breast, and rested her head on his shoulder again in silence, for her heart was too full of awe and thankfulness for words, even had she not been without breath or power to speak, and needing his support in her giddiness and trembling.",look see pale voice steady lean breast rest head shoulder silence heart full awe thankfulness word breath power speak need support giddiness tremble

22,"She tried to stand alone, but the trembling returned. He made her sit down, and she rested against him, while he still made her assure him that she was unhurt. ‘Yes, quite unhurt--quite well; only this wrist is a little strained, and no wonder.

39,"Amabel was much impressed, as she thought what it would have been for him if his little wife bad been snatched from him so suddenly and frightfully. His return--his meeting her mother--his desolate home and solitary life. She could almost have wept for him. Yet, at the moment of relief from the fear of such misery, he could thus speak. He could look onward to the joy beyond, even while his cheek was still blanched with the horror and anguish of the apprehension; and how great they had been was shown by the broken words he uttered in his sleep, for several nights afterwards, while by day he was always watching and cautioning her. Assuredly his dependence on the joy that could not be lost did not make her doubt his tenderness; it only made her feel how far behind him she was, for would it have been the same with her, had the danger been his?",impressed think little wife snatch return meeting mother desolate home solitary life goot moment relief fear such misery speak look joy cheek blanch horror anguish apprehension great show break word utter sleep several night day watch caution dependence joy lose make doubt tenderness make feel same danger 
40,"In a couple of days they arrived at the beautiful Lugano, and, as usual, their first walk was to the post-office, but disappointment awaited them. There had been some letters addressed to the name of Morville, but the Signor Inglese had left orders that such should be forwarded to Como. Amabel, in her best Italian, strove hard to explain the difference between the captain and Sir Guy, the Cavaliere Guido, as she translated him, who stood by looking much amused by the perplexities of his lady’s construing; while the post-master, though very polite and sorry for the Signora’s disappointment, stuck to the address being Morville, poste restante.",couple day arrive beautiful usual first walk post office disappointment await be letter address name leave order such forward good strive explain difference captain translate stand look amuse perplexity lady construe post master polite sorry disappointment stick address restante

53,"On the second evening from that time, Philip Morville was walking, hot and dusty, between the high stone walls bordering the road, and shutting out the beautiful view of the lake, at the entrance of Ballagio, meditating on the note he had received from Guy, and intending to be magnanimous, and overlook former offences for Amabel’s sake. He would show that he considered the marriage to have cleared off old scores, and that as long as she was happy, poor little thing, her husband should be borne with, though not to the extent of the spoiling the Edmonstones gave him.",second evening time walk hot dusty high stone wall border road shut beautiful view lake entrance meditate note receive intend magnanimous overlook former offence sake show consider marriage clear old score happy poor little thing husband borne extent spoiling give 
54,"Thus reflecting, he entered the town, and walked on in search of the hotel. He presently found himself on a terrace, looking out on the deep blue lake, there divided by the promontory of Bellagio, into two branches, the magnificent mountain forms rising opposite to him. A little boat was crossing, and as it neared the landing-place, he saw that it contained a gentleman and lady, English--probably his cousins themselves. They looked up, and in another moment had waved their recognition. Gestures and faces were strangely familiar, like a bit of Hollywell transplanted into that Italian scene. He hastened to the landing-place, and was met by a hearty greeting from Guy, who seemed full of eagerness to claim their closer relationship, and ready to be congratulated.",reflect enter town walk search hotel find terrace look deep blue lake divide promontory branch magnificent mountain form rise little boat cross near landing place see contain gentleman lady cousin look moment wave recognition gesture face familiar bit transplant italian scene hasten landing place meet hearty greeting seem full eagerness claim close relationship ready congratulate

56,"If he had wished to annoy Philip, he could hardly have done so more effectually than by behaving as if nothing was amiss, and disconcerting his preparations for a reconciliation. But the captain’s ordinary manner was calculated to cover all such feelings; and as he shook hands, he felt much kindness for Amabel, as an unconscious victim, whose very smiles were melancholy, and plenty of them there were, for she rejoiced sincerely in the meeting, as Guy was pleased, and a home face was a welcome sight.",wish annoy do behave amiss disconcert preparation reconciliation captain ordinary manner calculate cover such feeling shake hand feel much kindness unconscious victim very smile melancholy plenty rejoice meeting pleased home face welcome sight

77,"They were fast losing the stiffness of first meeting. Philip could not but acknowledge to himself that Amy was looking very well, and so happy that Guy must be fulfilling the condition on which he was to be borne with. However, these were early days, and of course Guy must be kind to her at least in the honeymoon, before the wear and tear of life began. They both looked so young, that having advised them to wait four years, he was ready to charge them with youthfulness, if not as a fault, at least as a folly; indeed, the state of his own affairs made him inclined to think it a foible, almost a want of patience, in any one to marry before thirty. It was a conflict of feeling. Guy was so cordial and good-humoured, that he could not help being almost gained; but, on the other hand, he had always thought Guy’s manners eminently agreeable; and as happiness always made people good-humoured, this was no reason for relying on him. Besides, the present ease and openness of manner might only result from security.",fast lose stiffness first meeting acknowledge look happy guy fulfil condition borne early day course guy kind least honeymoon wear tear life begin look young advise wait year ready charge youthfulness fault least folly state own affair make inclined think foible want patience one marry conflict feeling guy cordial good humoured help gain other hand think guy manners agreeable happiness make person good humoured reason rely present ease openness manner result security 
78,"Other circumstances combined, more than the captain imagined, in what is popularly called putting him out. He had always been hitherto on equal terms with Guy; indeed, had rather the superiority at Hollywell, from his age and assumption of character, but here Sir Guy was somebody, the captain nobody, and even the advantage of age was lost, now that Guy was married and head of a family, while Philip was a stray young man and his guest. Far above such considerations as he thought himself, and deeming them only the tokens of the mammon worship of the time, Philip, nevertheless, did not like to be secondary to one to whom he had always been preferred; and this, and perhaps the being half ashamed of it, made him something more approaching to cross than ever before; but now and then, the persevering amiability of both would soften him, and restore him to his most gracious mood.",other circumstance combine more captain imagine call put equal term have superiority age assumption character captain advantage age lose married head family stray young man guest such consideration think deem token mammon worship time like secondary prefer half ashamed make approach cross persever amiability soften restore gracious mood

109,"There were times when, as Philip had once said, good temper annoyed him more than anything, and perhaps he was unconsciously disappointed at having lost his old power of fretting and irritating Guy, and watching him champ the bit, so as to justify his own opinion of him. Every proceeding of his cousins seemed to give him annoyance, more especially their being at home together, and Guy’s seeming to belong more to Hollywell than himself. He sat by, with a book, and watched them, as Guy asked for Laura’s letter, and Amy came to look over his half-finished answer, laughing over it, and giving her commands and messages, looking so full of playfulness and happiness, as she stood with one hand on the back of her husband’s chair, and the other holding the letter, and Guy watching her amused face, and answering her remarks with lively words and bright smiles. ‘People who looked no deeper than the surface would, say, what a well-matched pair,’ thought Philip; ‘and no doubt they were very happy, poor young things, if it would but last.’ Here Guy turned, and asked him a question about the line of perpetual snow, so much in his own style, that he was almost ready to accuse them of laughing at him. Next came what hurt him most of all, as they talked over Charles’s letter, and a few words passed about Laura, and the admiration of some person she had met at Allonby. The whole world was welcome to admire her: nothing could injure his hold on her heart, and no joke of Charles could shake his confidence; but it was hard that he should be forced to hear such things, and ask no questions, for they evidently thought him occupied with his book, and did not intend him to listen. The next thing they said, however, obliged him to show that he was attending, for it was about her being better.",be time say good temper annoy more disappointed lose old power fret irritate watch champ bit justify own opinion proceeding cousin seem give annoyance home seem belong more sit book watch guy ask letter come look half finish answer laugh give command message look full playfulness happiness stand hand back husband chair other hold letter guy watch amuse face answer remark lively word bright smile person look deep surface match pair think doubt happy poor young thing last guy turn ask question line perpetual snow much own style ready accuse laugh come hurt most talk letter few word pass admiration person meet whole world welcome admire injure hold heart joke shake confidence hard force hear such thing ask question think occupy book intend listen next thing say oblige show attend good

113,"Arnaud had brought rather antiquated notions to the renewal of his office as a courier: his mind had hardly opened to railroads and steamers, and changes had come over hotels since his time. Guy and Amabel, both young and healthy, caring little about bad dinners, and unwilling to tease the old man by complaints, or alterations of his arrangements, had troubled themselves little about the matter; took things as they found them, ate dry bread when the cookery was bad, walked if the road was ‘shocking’; went away the sooner, if the inns were ‘intolerable’; made merry over every inconvenience, and turned it into an excellent story for Charles.

Guy proposed to go together somewhere, spare the post-office further blunders, and get the Signor Capitano to be their interpreter. Philip thought it would be an excellent thing for his young cousins for him to take charge of them, and show them how people ought to travel; so out came his little pocket map, marked with his route, before he left Ireland, whereas they seemed to have no fixed object, but to be always going ‘somewhere.’ It appeared that they had thought of Venice, but were easily diverted from it by his design of coasting the eastern bank of the Lago di Como, and so across the Stelvio into the Tyrol, all together as far as Botzen, whence Philip would turn southward by the mountain paths, while they would proceed to Innsbruck on their return home.",compare note plan appear party have week day spare captain embark time fix return guy propose go spare post office further blunder get interpreter think excellent thing young cousin take charge show person travel come little pocket map mark route leave seem have fix object go appear think divert design coast eastern bank turn mountain path proceed return

172,"The argument lasted long. Philip by no means approved of Venice, especially after the long loitering at Munich, thinking that in both places there was danger of Guy’s being led into mischief by his musical connections. Therefore he did his best, for Amabel’s sake, to turn them from their purpose, persuaded in his own mind that the fever was a mere bugbear, raised up by Arnaud; and, perhaps, in his full health and strength, almost regarding illness itself as a foible, far more the dread of it. He argued, therefore, in his most provoking strain, becoming more vexatious as the former annoyance was revived at finding the impossibility of making Guy swerve from his purpose, while additional mists of suspicion arose before him, making him imagine that the whole objection was caused by Guy’s dislike to submit to him, and a fit of impatience of which Amy was the victim; nay, that his cousin wanted to escape from his surveillance, and follow the beat of his inclinations; and the whole heap of prejudices and half-refuted accusations resumed their full ascendancy. Never had his manner been more vexatious, though without departing from the coolness which always characterized it; but all the time, Guy, while firm and unmoved in purpose, kept his temper perfectly, and apparently without effort. Even Amabel glowed with indignation, at the assumption with which he was striving to put her husband down, though she rejoiced to see its entire failure: for some sensible argument, or some gay, lively, good-humoured reply, was the utmost he could elicit. Guy did not seem to be in the least irritated or ruffled by the very behaviour which used to cause him so many struggles. Having once seriously said that he did not think it right to run into danger, without adequate cause, he held his position with so much ease, that he could afford to be playful, and laugh at his own dread of infection, his changeableness, and credulity. Never had temper been more entirely subdued; for surely if he could bear this, he need never fear himself again.",argument last means approve long loitering think place be danger guy lead mischief musical connection do good sake turn purpose persuade own mind fever mere bugbear raise full health strength regard illness foible dread argue provoking strain become vexatious former annoyance revive find impossibility make guy swerve purpose additional mist suspicion arise make imagine whole objection cause dislike submit fit impatience victim cousin want escape surveillance follow beat inclination whole heap prejudice half refute accusation resume full ascendancy have manner vexatious depart coolness characterize time firm unmoved purpose keep temper effort glow indignation assumption striving put husband rejoice see entire failure sensible argument gay lively good humoured reply utmost elicit guy seem least irritated ruffle very behaviour use cause many struggle say think right run danger adequate cause hold position much ease afford playful laugh own dread infection changeableness credulity have temper subdued bear fear 
173,"So passed the hour; and Amabel was heartily glad when the debate was closed by Arnaud’s coming for orders. Guy went with him; Amabel began to collect her goods; and Philip, after a few moments’ reflection, spoke in the half-compassionate, half-patronizing manner with which he used, now and then, to let fall a few crumbs of counsel or commendation for silly little Amy.",pass hour glad debate close come order guy go begin collect goods few moment reflection speak half compassionate half patronizing manner use let fall few crumb counsel commendation silly little

176,"The gentlemanlike instinct made him reply, ‘I beg your pardon’--and there he stopped, as much taken by surprise as if a dove had flown in his face. He actually was confused; for in very truth, he had, after a fashion, forgotten that she was Lady Morville, not the cousin Amy with whom Guy’s character might be freely discussed. He had often presumed as far with his aunt; but she, though always turning the conversation, had never given him a rebuff. Amabel had not done; and in her soft voice, firmly, though not angrily, she spoke on. ‘One thing I wish to say, because we shall never speak on this subject again, and I was always afraid of you before. You have always misunderstood him, I might almost say, chosen to misunderstand him. You have tried his temper more than any one, and never appreciated the struggles that have subdued it. It is not because I am his wife that I say this--indeed I am not sure it becomes me to say it; yet I cannot bear that you should not be told of it, because you think he acts out of enmity to you.

179,"She left the room, and Philip held her in higher esteem. He saw there was spirit and substance beneath that soft girlish exterior, and hoped she would better be able to endure the troubles which her precipitate marriage was likely to cause her; but as to her husband, his combined fickleness and obstinacy had only become more apparent than ever--fickleness in forsaking his purpose, obstinacy in adherence to his own will.",leave room hold high esteem see be spirit substance soft girlish exterior hope able endure trouble precipitate marriage likely cause husband combine fickleness obstinacy become apparent fickleness forsake purpose obstinacy adherence own will 
180,"Displeased and contemptuous, Philip was not softened by Guy’s freedom and openness of manner and desire to help him as far as their roads lay together. He was gracious only to Lady Morville, whom he treated with kindness, intended to show that he was pleased with her for a reproof which became her position well, though it could not hurt him. Perhaps she thought this amiability especially insufferable: for when she arrived at Varenna her chief thought was that here they should be free of him.",displease contemptuous soften freedom openness manner desire help road lay gracious treat kindness intend show pleased reproof become position hurt think amiability insufferable arrive chief thought free

Good-bye, Amy, I hope you will have a pleasant journey.’",touch moment kind speech tone grave dignified remember write answer tell wear study good hope have pleasant journey 
187,"The farewells were exchanged and the carriage drove off. ‘Poor little Amy!’ said Philip to himself, ‘how she is improved. He has a sweet little wife in her. The fates have conspired to crown him with all man can desire, and little marvel if he should abuse his advantages. Poor little Amy! I have less hope than ever, since even her evident wishes could not bend his determination in this trifle; but she is a good little creature, happy in her blindness. May it long continue!
