1,CHAPTER XXIII.,
2," For two or three days, Mr. Campbell was very busy making out an inventory of the articles which he required. His funds at Quebec were rather low, but the communication which his agent had made to him of Mr. D. Campbell's intention of paying for the green-house and hot-house plants, made him feel very easy on that score; and he now determined to procure a small flock of sheep, and one or two of the Canadian ponies or galloways, as they would soon be required for the farm, as well as two carts or light wagons used in the country. In the meantime, Alfred, Martin, and Henry were very busy putting the seed in between the stumps of the felled timber, merely hoeing up the earth and raking it in, which was all that was required. The quantity of land cleared was about twelve acres, half of which was sowed with oats, and the other with wheat; the piece cleared on the other side of the stream by Malachi Bone, and railed in, was sown with maize, or Indian corn. As soon as the seed was in, they all set to putting up a high fence round the cleared land, which was done with split rails made from the white cedar, which grew in a swamp about half a mile distant, and which, it may be remembered, had in a great measure been provided by the soldiers who had been lent to assist them on their arrival. The piece of prairie land, on the side of the stream next to the house, was put apart for an early crop of hay, and as soon as they could, they intended to turn the cows into the bush, that is, to feed in the forest, that they might obtain hay from the other side, which had belonged to Malachi; but the prairie required to be fenced in, and this was the job that they took in hand as soon as the seeds were sown.",day busy make inventory article require fund low communication agent make intention pay green house hot house plant make feel easy score determine procure small flock sheep canadian pony galloway require farm cart light wagon use country meantime busy put seed stump fell timber hoeing earth rake require quantity land clear acre half sow oat other wheat piece clear other side stream rail sow maize indian corn seed set put high fence clear land do split rail make white cedar grow swamp mile distant remember have great measure provide soldier loan assist arrival piece prairie land side stream house put early crop hay intend turn cow bush feed forest obtain hay other side belong prairie require fence job take hand seed sow 
3,"""I hope, when the Colonel comes over,"" observed Martin to Alfred, ""that we shall persuade him to let us have some soldiers this summer, for we shall want them both for the fencing and getting the hay-crop in. Our summers are not very long, and there is plenty to do.""",hope come observe persuade let have soldier summer want fencing get hay crop summer long be plenty do 
4,"""I think my father intends to make the request,"" replied Alfred.",think father intend make request reply 
5,"""Ah, sir; he will now see the value of this bit of prairie land to a new settler; instead of having to go in search of hay, as they must do at the fort now, we have plenty for hay, and plenty for feed. So we are to have some sheep, I find?""",sir see value bit land new settler have go search hay do fort have plenty hay plenty feed have sheep find 
6,"""Yes, and I suppose we must build a winter-yard for them.""",suppose build winter yard 
7,"""To be sure we must, for the wolves are very partial to mutton; I think, on the whole, that they like pigs better. I wish we could get the fence up round the prairie, but that we never can do this year without we have help from the fort.""",sure wolf partial mutton think whole like pig good wish get fence prairie do year have help fort 
8,"""But will it be safe to turn the cows into the bush?""",safe turn cow bush 
9,"""Oh yes, sir; they will not be hurt by any thing in the summer time; sometimes we have trouble to find them again, but not when they have calves; they are certain to come home every evening to their young ones.""",sir hurt thing summer time have trouble find have calve certain come evening young one 
10,"""We shall have quite a herd of cattle; eight calves and eight cows.""",have herd cattle calve cow

12,"""Yes, we shall be great farmers by and by,"" replied Alfred with a sigh; for at the moment he was thinking of Captain Lumley and his nautical profession.",great farmer reply sigh moment think nautical profession 
13,"In the evening of the day on which this conversation took place, Malachi Bone was requested to resume his observations upon the beavers.",evening day conversation take place request resume observation beaver 
14,"""Well, ma'am, as I said the other night, as soon as they have dammed up the river and made the lake, they then build their houses; and how they manage to work under water and fix the posts in the ground is a puzzle to me, but they do fix six posts in the ground, and very firmly, and then they build their house, which is very curious; it is in the form of a large oven, and made of clay and fat earth, mixed up with branches and herbs of all sorts; they have three sets of rooms, one above the other, so that if the water rises from a freshet or sudden thaw, they may be able to move higher and keep themselves dry. Each beaver has his own little room, and the entrance is made under the water, so that they dive down to go into it, and nothing can harm them.""",say other night damm river make lake build house manage work water fix post ground puzzle fix post ground build house curious form large oven make clay fat earth mix branch herb sort have set room other water rise freshet sudden thaw able move high keep dry beaver have own little room entrance make water dive go harm 
15,"""How very curious! and what do they live upon? Malachi?""",curious live

17,"""Well, but how do you take them, Malachi?""",take 
18,"""There are many ways, ma'am; sometimes the Indians break down the dam, and let off the water, and then they kill them all except a dozen of the females and half a dozen males; after which they stop up the dam again, that the animals may breed and increase; sometimes, when the beaver lake is frozen hard, they break into the beaver house from the top; when they do that, the beavers all dive and escape, but as they must come up to breathe at the holes in the ice, they place nets and take them in that way, but they always leave a sufficient number to keep up the stock; they also take them in traps baited with the asp-wood; but that is more difficult.",be many way break dam let water kill female male stop dam animal breed increase beaver lake freeze break beaver house top do beaver dive escape come breathe hole ice place net take way leave sufficient number keep stock take trap bait asp wood difficult 
19,"""But there is another sort of beaver, ma'am, called the land-beaver, which is more easily taken,"" observed Martin; ""they make holes in the earth like rabbits. The Indians say that these beavers are those who are lazy and idle, and have been driven out by the others for not working.""",be sort beaver ma'am call land beaver take observe make hole earth rabbit say beaver lazy idle drive other work 
20,"""Now, tell us what you do when you go out to hunt the beaver in the winter, Malachi?""",tell do go hunt beaver winter 
21,"""We never hunt the beaver only, ma'am; we go out to hunt every thing; we go to the beaver lakes, and then we set our traps for beaver, otter, martin, minks, cats, foxes, and every other animal, some traps large and some small. We build our hut, and set our traps all about us, and examine them every day; we cut what flesh is good, and we employ ourselves skinning the animals which we take.""",hunt beaver go hunt thing go beaver lake set trap beaver otter martin mink cat fox other animal trap large small build hut set trap examine day cut flesh good employ skinn animal take 
22,"""Is the beaver flesh good?""",beaver flesh good 
23,"""Yes, ma'am, very tolerable eating; perhaps the best we find at that time.""",tolerable eating good find time 
24,"""But what a miserable life that must be,"" said Mrs. Campbell.",miserable life say 
25,"""Well, ma'am, you may think so, but we hunters think otherwise,"" replied Malachi; ""we are used to it, and to being left alone to our own thoughts.""",think hunter think reply use leave alone own thought 
26,"""That's true,"" observed Martin; ""I'd rather pass the winter hunting beavers, than pass it at Quebec, miserable as you may imagine the life to be.""",true observe pass winter hunting beaver pass miserable imagine life 
27,"""There must be a charm in the life, that is certain,"" observed Mr. Campbell; ""for how many are engaged in it who go out year after year, and never think of laying up any of their earnings.""",be charm life certain observe many engage go year year think lay earnings 
28,"""Very true, sir,"" replied Martin; ""what they make from their skins is spent as soon as they get to Quebec, as I know well, and then they set off again.""",true sir reply make skin spend get know set 
29,"""Why they are like sailors,"" observed Alfred, ""who, after a long cruise, spend all their wages and prize-money in a few days, and then go to sea again for more.""",sailor observe long cruise spend wage prize money few day go sea more 
30,"""Exactly,"" replied Malachi; ""and what's the use of money if you keep it? A trapper can always take up as much powder and ball as he wants upon credit, and pay with a portion of his skins on his return. What does he want with the rest? It's of no use to him, and so of course he spends it.""",reply use money keep trapper take much powder ball want credit pay portion skin return want rest use course spend 
31,"""But would it not be better to put it by until he had sufficient to buy a farm, and live comfortably?""",good put have sufficient buy farm live

33,"""It's very true philosophy, after all,"" observed Mr. Campbell; ""happy is the man who is content to be poor. If a man prefers to live entirely upon flesh, as the hunters do, there is no reason why he should work hard and till the ground to procure bread; when the wants are few, the cares are few also; but still, even the savage must feel the necessity of exertion when he has a wife and family.""",true philosophy observe happy man content poor man prefer live flesh hunter do be reason work ground procure bread want few care few savage feel necessity exertion have wife family 
34,"""Yes, sir, to be sure he does, and he works hard in his own way to procure their food; but trappers seldom have wives; they would be no use to them in the woods, and they have no one to provide for but themselves.""",sir sure work own way procure food trapper have wife use wood have provide 
35,"""It appears to me like a savage life, but a very independent one,"" said Mrs. Campbell, ""and I presume it is the independence which gives it such charms.""",appear savage life independent one say presume independence give such charm 
36,"""That's it, depend upon it, ma'am,"" replied Martin.",depend reply 
37,"""But what do you do all the summer time, Malachi?""",do summer time 
38,"""Why, ma'am, we take to our rifles then; there are the deer, and the lynx, and the wild cats, and squirrels, and the bear, and many other animals to look after; and sometimes we go bee-hunting, for the honey.""",take rifle be deer lynx wild cat squirrel bear many other animal look go bee hunting honey 
39,"""Pray tell us how you take the honey, Malachi.""",pray tell take honey 
40,"""Why, ma'am, the bees always live in the hollow of the old trees, and it's very difficult in a forest to find them out, for the hole which they enter by is very small and very high up sometimes; however, when we get a lead, we generally manage it.""",bee live hollow old tree difficult forest find hole enter small high get lead manage 
41,"""Tell us what you mean, Malachi.""",tell mean 
42,"""We catch the bees as they settle upon the flowers to obtain honey, and then we let them go again. The bee, as soon as it is allowed to escape, flies straight toward its hive; we watch it till we can no longer see it, and walk in that direction and catch another, and so we go on till we see them settle upon a tree, and then we know that the hive and honey must be in that tree, so we cut it down.""",catch bee settle flower obtain honey let go bee allow escape fly hive watch see walk direction catch go see settle tree know hive honey tree cut 
43,"""How very clever,"" said Percival.",clever say 
44,"""It requires a sharp eye though,"" said Martin, ""to watch the bee far; some of the trappers catch the bees and give them sugar mixed with whisky. This makes them tipsy, and they can not fly so fast, and then they discover the hive much sooner, as they can run almost as fast as the bee flies.""",require sharp eye say watch bee trapper catch bee give sugar mix whisky make tipsy fly discover hive run bee fly 
45,"""That's capital,"" cried Percival; ""but tell me, Martin, how do you kill the bears?""",capital cry tell kill bear 
46,"""Why, Master Percival, with our rifles, to be sure; the easiest way to kill them is when they are in their holes in the hollow trees.""",rifle sure easy way kill hole hollow tree 
47,"""How do you get them out?""",get 
48,"""Why, we knock the tree with our axes, and they come out to see what's the matter, and as soon as they put their heads out, we shoot them.""",knock tree axe come see matter put head shoot 
49,"""Are you in earnest, Martin?""",earnest 
50,"""Yes, ma'am; quite in earnest,"" replied Martin.",earnest reply 
51,"""It's all true, ma'am,"" said the hunter; ""the bears about here are not very savage. We had much worse down in Maine. I've seen the Indians in a canoe on a river watching the bears as they swam across, and kill in the water six or seven in one day.""",true say hunter bear savage have bad see canoe river watch bear swim kill water day 
52,"""Still a bear is an awkward sort of animal when it's angry,"" replied Martin; ""and, as we may have them down here in the autumn, it's as well not to let them be thought too lightly of.""",bear awkward sort animal angry reply have autumn let think 
53,"""Indeed, there's no fear of that,"" said Emma; ""as for Malachi, he thinks nothing dangerous; but I have no wish to see a bear. You say we may expect them, Martin. Why so?""",be fear say think dangerous have wish see bear say expect 
54,"""Because, miss, they are very fond of maize, and we have a field of it sown, which may tempt them.""",miss fond maize have field sow temp

57,"""Don't be afraid; I'll only fire in self-defense, Malachi; that is, when I have no other chance left. I had rather trust to my heels than my rifle. Were you ever hugged by a bear?""",afraid fire self defense have other chance leave have trust heel rifle hugge bear

59,"""Oh! when was that? Do, pray, tell us,"" said Emma.",pray tell say 
60,"""It was when I was young, that one day I sounded a tree in the forest with my ax, and I was certain that a bear was in it: but the animal did not show itself, so I climbed up the tree to examine the hole at the top, and see if the bear was at home; as, if so, I was determined to have him out. Well, miss, I was on the top of the hollow trunk, and was just putting my head down into the hole, when, all of a sudden, the edge of the tree which I kneeled upon gave way, like so much tinder, and down I went into the hollow; luckily for me I did not go down head foremost, or there I should have remained till this time, for the hole in the middle of the tree, as I found, was too narrow for me to have turned in, and there I must have stuck. As it was, I went down with the dust and crumbles smothering me almost, till I came right on the top of the bear, who lay at the bottom, and I fell with such force, that I doubled his head down so that he could not lay hold of me with his teeth, which would not have been pleasant; indeed, the bear was quite as much, if not more astonished than myself, and there he lay beneath me, very quiet, till I could recover a little. Then I thought of getting out, as you may suppose, fast enough, and the hollow of the tree, providentially, was not so wide but that I could work up again with my back to one side and my knees to the other. By this means I gradually got up again to the hole that I fell in at, and perched myself across the timber to fetch my breath. I had not been there more than a quarter of a minute, and I intended to have remained much longer, when I perceived, all of a sudden, the bear's head within a foot of me; he had climbed up after me, and I saw that he was very angry, so in a moment I threw myself off my perch, and down I went to the ground at the foot of the tree, a matter of near twenty feet, even faster than I went down inside of it. I was severely shaken with the fall, but no bones were broken; in fact, I was more frightened than hurt; I lay quite still for a little while, when the growl of the bear put me in mind of him; I jumped on my legs, and found that he was coming down the tree after me, and was within six feet of the ground. There was no time to lose; I caught up my rifle, and had just time to put it to his ear and settle him, as he was placing his fore-foot on the ground.""",young day sound tree forest ax certain bear animal show climb tree examine hole top see bear home determined have miss top hollow trunk put head hole edge tree kneel give way much tinder go hollow go head remain time hole middle tree find narrow turn stick go dust crumble smother come top bear lay bottom fall such force double head lay hold tooth pleasant bear much astonished lay quiet recover little think get suppose hollow tree wide work back side knee other mean get hole fall perch timber fetch breath more quarter minute intend remain perceive bear head foot climb see angry moment throw perch go ground foot tree matter foot fast go shake fall bone break fact frighten hurt lay little while growl bear put mind jump leg find come tree foot ground be time lose catch rifle have time put ear settle place fore foot ground
