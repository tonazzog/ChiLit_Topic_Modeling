2, The shadow of coming changes began to fall over us very soon after that.,shadow come change begin fall 
3,"Indeed, the very next morning at breakfast I noticed that mamma looked pale and almost as if she had been crying, and father was, so to say, ""extra"" kind to her and to me. He talked and laughed more than usual, partly perhaps to prevent our noticing how silent dear mamma was, but mostly I think because that is the way men do when they are really anxious or troubled.",next morning breakfast notice mamma look pale cry father say extra kind talk laugh more usual prevent notice silent dear mamma think way man do anxious troubled 
4,I don't fancy Haddie thought there was anything wrong--he was in a hurry to get off to school.,fancy think be wrong hurry get school 
5,"After breakfast mamma told me to go and practise for half an hour, and if she did not come to me then, I had better go on doing some of my lessons alone. She would look them over afterwards. And as I was going out of the room she called me back and kissed me again--almost as she had done the night before.",breakfast mamma tell go practise hour come go do lesson look go room call kiss do night 
6,"That gave me courage to say something. For children were not, in my childish days, on such free and easy terms with their elders as they are now. And kind and gentle as mamma was, we knew very distinctly the sort of things she would think forward or presuming on our part.",give courage say child childish day such free easy term elder kind gentle mamma know sort thing think presume part 
7,"""Mamma,"" I said, still hesitating a little.",say hesitate little 
8,"""Well, dear,"" she replied. She was buttoning, or pretending to button, the band of the little brown holland apron I wore, so that I could not see her face, but something in the tone of her voice told me that my instinct was not mistaken.",dear reply button pretend button band little brown apron wear see face tone voice tell instinct mistaken 
9,"""Mamma,"" I repeated, ""may I say something? I have a feeling that--that you are--that there is something the matter.""",repeat say have feeling be matter 
10,"Mamma did not answer at once. Then she said very gently, but quite kindly,",answer say 
11,"""Geraldine, my dear, you know that I tell you as much as I think it right to tell any one as young as you--I tell you more, of our plans and private matters and such things, than most mothers tell their little daughters. This has come about partly through your being so much alone with me. But when I _don't_ tell you anything, even though you may suspect there is something to tell, you should trust me that there is good reason for my not doing so.""",dear know tell much think right tell one young tell more plan private matter such thing most mother tell little daughter come alone tell suspect be tell trust be good reason do 
12,"""Yes,"" I said, but I could not stifle a little sigh. ""Would you just tell me one thing, mamma,"" I went on; ""it isn't anything that you're really unhappy about, is it?""",say stifle little sigh tell thing mamma go unhappy 
13,Again mamma hesitated.,mamma hesitate 
14,"""Dear child,"" she said, ""try to put it out of your mind. I can only say this much to you, I am _anxious_ more than troubled. There is nothing the matter that should really be called a trouble. But your father and I have a question of great importance to decide just now, and we are very--I may say really _terribly_--anxious to decide for the best. That is all I can tell you. Kiss me, my darling, and try to be your own bright little self. That will be a comfort and help to me.""",dear child say try put mind say much more troubled be matter call trouble father have question great importance decide say anxious decide good tell kiss darling try own bright little self comfort help 
15,"I kissed her and I promised I would try to do as she wished. But it was with rather a heavy heart that I went to my practising. What _could_ it be? I did try not to think of it, but it would keep coming back into my mind. And I was only a child. I had no experience of trouble or anxiety. After a time my spirits began to rise again--there was a sort of excitement in the wondering what this great matter could be. I am afraid I did not succeed in putting it out of my mind as mamma wished me to do.",kiss promise try do wish heavy heart go practising try think keep come mind child have experience trouble anxiety time spirit begin rise be sort excitement wonder great matter afraid succeed put mind mamma wish do 
16,"But the days went on without anything particular happening. I did not speak of what mamma had said to me to my brother. I knew she did not wish me to do so. And by degrees other things began to make me forget about it a little. It was just at that time, I remember, that some friend--an aunt on father's side, I think--sent me a present of _The Wide, Wide World_, and while I was reading it I seemed actually to live in the story. It was curious that I should have got it just then. If mamma had read it herself I am not sure that she would have given it to me. But after all, perhaps it served the purpose of preparing me a _little_--a very little--for what was before me in my own life.",day go particular happen speak mamma say brother know wish do degree other thing begin make forget little time remember friend aunt father side think send present wide wide read seem live story curious get mamma read sure give serve purpose prepare _little_ little own life 
17,"It was nearly three weeks after the time I have described rather minutely that the blow fell, that Haddie and I were told the whole. I think, however, I will not go on telling _how_ we were told, for I am afraid of making my story too long.",week time describe blow fall tell whole think go tell tell afraid make story 
18,"And of course, however good my memory is, I cannot pretend that the conversations I relate took place _exactly_ as I give them. I think I give the _spirit_ of them correctly, but now that I have come to the telling of distinct facts, perhaps it will be better simply to narrate them.",course good memory pretend conversation relate take place _exactly_ give think give _spirit_ come telling distinct fact good narrate 
19,"You will remember my saying that my father had lost money very unexpectedly, and that this was what had obliged him to come to live at Mexington and work so hard. He had got the post he held there--it was in a bank--greatly through the influence of Mrs. Selwood, mamma's godmother, who lived in the country at some hours' distance from the town, and whose name was well known there, as she owned a great many houses and other property in the immediate neighbourhood.",remember say father lose money oblige come live work get post hold bank influence godmother live country hour distance town name know own great many house other property immediate neighbourhood 
20,"Father was very glad to get this post, and very grateful to Mrs. Selwood. She took great interest in us all--that is to say, she was interested in Haddie and me because we were mamma's children, though she did not care for or understand children as a rule. But she was a faithful friend, and anxious to help father still more.",father glad get post grateful take great interest say interested mamma child care understand child rule faithful friend anxious help father more 
21,"Just about the time I have got to in my story, the manager of a bank in South America, in some way connected with the one at Great Mexington, became ill, and was told by the doctors that he must return to England and have a complete rest for two years. Mrs. Selwood had money connection with this bank too, and got to hear of what had happened. Knowing that father could speak both French and Spanish well, for he had been in the diplomatic service as a younger man, she at once applied for the appointment for him, and after some little delay she was told that he should have the offer of it for the two years.",time get story manager bank way connect one great become ill tell doctor return have complete rest year have money connection bank get hear happen know father speak french diplomatic service young man apply appointment little delay tell have offer year 
22,"Two years are not a very long time, even though the pay was high, but the great advantage of the offer was that the heads of the bank at Mexington promised, if all went well for that time, that some permanent post should be given to father in England on his return. This was what made him more anxious to accept the proposal than even the high pay. For Mrs. Selwood found out that he would not be able to save much of his salary, as he would have a large house to keep up, and would be expected to receive many visitors. On this account the post was never given to an unmarried man.",year long time pay high great advantage offer head bank promise go time permanent post give father return make anxious accept proposal high pay find able save much salary have large house keep expect receive many visitor account post give unmarried man 
23,"""If he accepts it,"" Mrs. Selwood wrote to mamma, ""you, my dear Blanche, must go with him, and some arrangement would have to be made about the children for the time. I would advise your sending them to school.""",accept write mamma dear go arrangement have make child time advise send school 
24,"_Now_ I think my readers will not be at a loss to understand why our dear mother had looked so troubled, even though on one side this event promised to be for our good in the end.",think reader loss understand dear mother look troubled side event promise good end 
25,"Father was allowed two or three weeks in which to make up his mind. The heads of the Mexington bank liked and respected him very much, and they quite saw that there were two sides to the question of his accepting the offer. The climate of the place was not very good--at least it was injurious to English people if they stayed there for long--and it was perfectly certain that it would be madness to take growing children like Haddie and me there.",father allow week make mind head bank like respect see be side question accept offer climate place good least injurious english person stay certain madness take grow child 
26,"_This_ was the dark spot in it all to mamma, and indeed to father too. They were not afraid for themselves. They were both strong and still young, but they could not for a moment entertain the idea of taking _us_. And the thought of separation was terrible.",dark spot mamma father afraid strong young moment entertain idea take thought separation terrible 
27,"You see, being a small family, and living in a place like Great Mexington, where my parents had not many congenial friends, and being poor were obliged to live carefully, _home_ was everything to us all. We four were the whole world to each other, and knew no happiness apart.",see small family live place great parent have many congenial friend poor oblige live whole world other know happiness 
28,"I do not mean to say that I felt or saw all this at once, but looking back upon it from the outside, as it were, I see all that made it a peculiarly hard case, especially--at the beginning, that is to say--for mamma.",mean say feel see look outside see make hard case beginning say mamma 
29,"It seems strange that I did _not_ take it all in--all the misery of it, I mean--at first, nor indeed for some time, not till I had actual experience of it. Even Haddie realised it more in anticipation than I did. He was two years older, and though he had never been at a boarding-school, still he knew something of school life. There were boarders at his school, and he had often seen and heard how, till they got accustomed to it at any rate, they suffered from home-sickness, and counted the days to the holidays.",seem strange take misery mean first time have actual experience realise more anticipation year old boarding school know school life be border school see hear accustom rate suffer home sickness count day holiday 
30,"And for us there were not to be any holidays! No certain prospect of them at best, though Mrs. Selwood said something vaguely about perhaps having us at Fernley for a visit in the summer. But it was very vague. And we had no near relations on mamma's side except Aunty Etta, who was in India, and on father's no one who could possibly have us regularly for our holidays.",be holiday certain prospect good say have visit summer vague have near relation mamma side father have holiday 
31,"All this mamma grasped at once, and her grief was sometimes so extreme that, but for Mrs. Selwood, I doubt if father would have had the resolution to accept. But Mrs. Selwood was what is called ""very sensible,"" perhaps just a little hard, and certainly not _sensitive_. And she put things before our parents in such a way that mamma felt it her duty to urge father to accept the offer, and father felt it _his_ duty to put feelings aside and do so.",mamma grasp grief extreme doubt father have resolution accept call sensible little hard put thing parent way mamma feel duty urge father accept offer father feel duty put feeling do 
32,"They went to stay at Fernley from a Saturday to a Monday to talk it well over, and it was when they came back on the Monday that we were told.",go stay talk come tell 
33,"Before then I think we had both come to have a strong feeling that something was going to happen. I, of course, had some reason for this in what mamma had said to me, though I had forgotten about it a good deal, till this visit to Fernley brought back the idea of something unusual. For it was _very_ seldom that we were left by ourselves.",think come have strong feeling go happen course have reason mamma say forget good deal visit bring idea unusual leave 
34,"We did not mind it much. After all, it was only two nights and one _whole_ day, and that a Sunday, when my brother was at home, so we stood at the door cheerfully enough, looking at our father and mother driving off in the clumsy, dingy old four-wheeler--though that is a modern word--which was the best kind of cab known at Mexington.",mind night _whole_ day brother home stand door look father mother drive clumsy dingy old wheeler modern word good kind cab know 
35,"But when they were fairly off Haddie turned to me, and I saw that he was very grave. I was rather surprised.",turn see grave surprised 
36,"""Why, Haddie,"" I said, ""do you mind so much? They'll be back on Monday.""",say mind much 
37,"""No, of course I don't mind _that_,"" he said. ""But I wonder why mamma looks so--so awfully trying-not-to-cry, you know.""",course mind say wonder mamma look try cry know 
38,"""Oh,"" I said, ""I don't think she's quite well. And she hates leaving us.""",say think well hate leave 
39,"""No,"" said my brother, ""there's something more.""",say brother be more 
40,"And when he said that, I remembered the feeling I had had myself. I felt rather cross with Haddie; I wanted to forget it quite.",say remember feeling have feel cross want forget 
41,"""You needn't try to frighten me like that,"" I said. ""I meant to be quite happy while they were away--to please mamma, you know, by telling her so when she comes back.""",try frighten say mean happy mamma know tell come 
42,"Then Haddie, who really was a very good-natured, kind boy, looked sorry.",good natured kind boy look sorry 
43,"""I didn't mean to frighten you,"" he said; ""perhaps it was my fancy. I don't want to be unhappy while they're away, I'm sure. I'm only too glad that to-day's Saturday and to-morrow Sunday.""",mean frighten say fancy want unhappy sure glad day 
44,"And he did his very best to amuse me. We went out a walk that afternoon with the housemaid--quite a long walk, though it was winter. We went as far out of the town as we could get, to where there were fields, which in spring and summer still looked green, and through the remains of a little wood, pleasant even in the dullest season. It was our favourite walk, and the only pretty one near the town. There was a brook at the edge of the wood, which still did its best to sing merrily, and to forget how dingy and grimy its clear waters became a mile or two farther on; there were still a few treasures in the shape of ivy sprays and autumn-tinted leaves to gather and take home with us to deck our nursery.",do good amuse go walk afternoon housemaid long walk winter go town get be field spring summer look green remains little wood pleasant dullest season favourite walk only pretty one town be brook edge wood do good sing forget dingy grimy clear water become mile be few treasure shape ivy spray autumn tint leave gather take deck nursery 
45,"I remember the look of it all so well. It was the favourite walk of many besides ourselves, especially on a Saturday, when the hard-worked Mexington folk were once free to ramble about--boys and girls not much older than ourselves among them, for in those days children were allowed to work in factories much younger than they do now. We did not mind meeting some of our townsfellows. On the contrary, we felt a good deal of interest in them and liked to hear their queer way of talking, though we could scarcely understand anything they said. And we were very much interested indeed in some of the stories Lydia, who belonged to this part of the country, told us of her own life, in a village a few miles away, where there were two or three great factories, at which all the people about worked--men, women, and children too, so that sometimes, except for babies and very old people, the houses seemed quite deserted.",remember look favourite walk many hard work folk free ramble boy girl old day child allow work factory young do mind meet townsfelloww contrary feel good deal interest like hear queer way talk understand say interested story belong part country tell own life village few mile be great factory person work man woman child baby old person house seem desert 
46,"""And long ago before that,"" said Lydia, ""when mother was a little lass, it was such a pretty village--cottages all over with creepers and honeysuckle--not ugly rows of houses as like each other as peas. The people worked at home on their own hand-looms then.""",say mother little lass pretty village cottage creeper honeysuckle ugly row house other pea person work home own hand loom 
47,Lydia had a sense of the beautiful!,have sense beautiful 
48,"On our way home, of course, we called at Miss Fryer's--this time we had a whole shilling to spend, for there was Sunday's tea to think of as well as to-day's. We had never had so much at a time, and our consultation took a good while. We decided at last on seven crumpets and seven Bath buns as usual, and in addition to these, three large currant tea-cakes, which our friend Susan told us would be all the better for toasting if not too fresh. And the remaining threepence we invested in a slice of sweet sandwich, which she told us would be perfectly good if kept in a tin tightly closed. The old Quakeress for once, I have always suspected, departed on this occasion from her rule of exact payment for all purchases, for it certainly seemed a very large slice of sweet sandwich for threepence.",way course call time have whole shilling spend be tea think day have much time consultation take good while decide last crumpet bun usual addition large currant tea cake friend tell good toasting fresh remain threepence invest slice sweet sandwich tell good keep tin close old suspect depart occasion rule exact payment purchase seem large slice sweet sandwich threepence 
49,"We were rather tired with our walk that evening and went to bed early. Nothing more was said by Haddie about his misgivings. I think he hoped I had forgotten what had passed, but I had not. It had all come back again, the strange feeling of change and trouble in the air which had made me question mamma that morning two or three weeks ago.",tired walk evening go bed more say misgiving think hope forget pass come strange feeling change trouble air make question mamma morning week 
50,"But I did not as yet really believe it. I had never known what sorrow and trouble actually are. It is not many children who reach even the age I was then with so sunny and peaceful an experience of life. That anything could happen to us--to _me_--like what happened to ""Ellen"" in _The Wide, Wide World_, I simply could not believe; even though if any one had talked to me about it and said that troubles must come and _do_ come to all, and to some much more than to others, and that they might be coming to us, I should have agreed at once and said yes, of course I knew that was true.",believe know sorrow trouble many child reach age sunny peaceful experience life happen happen wide believe one talk say trouble come come more other come agree say course know true 
51,"The next day, Sunday, was very rainy. It made us feel dull, I think, though we did not really mind a wet Sunday as much as another day, for we never went a walk on Sunday. It was not thought right, and as we had no garden the day would have been a very dreary one to us, except for mamma.",next day rainy make feel dull think mind wet much day go walk think right have garden day dreary one mamma 
52,"She managed to make it pleasant. We went to church in the morning, and in the evening too sometimes. I think all children like going to church in the evening; there is something grown-up about it. And the rest of the day mamma managed to find interesting things for us to do. She generally had some book which she kept for reading aloud on Sunday--Dr. Adams's _Allegories_, ""The Dark River"" and others, were great favourites, and so were Bishop Wilberforce's _Agathos_. Some of them frightened me a little, but it was rather a pleasant sort of fright, there was something grand and solemn about it.",manage make pleasant go church morning evening think child like go church evening be grow rest day mamma manage find interesting thing do have book keep read dark other great favourite frighten little pleasant sort fright be grand solemn 
53,"Then we sang hymns sometimes, and we always had a very nice tea, and mamma, and father too now and then, told us stories about when they were children and what they did on Sundays. It was much stricter for them than for us, though even for us many things were forbidden on Sundays which are now thought not only harmless but right.",sing hymn have nice tea mamma father tell story child do stricter many thing forbidden think harmless right 
54,"Still, I never look back to the quiet Sundays in the dingy Mexington street with anything but a feeling of peace and gentle pleasure.",look quiet dingy street feeling peace gentle pleasure
