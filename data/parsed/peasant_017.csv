1,CHAPTER 13. THE FAMILY SEPARATED.,family separate 
2,"Their sorrows increased as time went on.  The king was separated from his family: but when the queen's grief alarmed the gaolers, the party were allowed to take their meals together, on condition of their speaking so as to be heard, and only in French.  It now became more necessary than ever for Clery to learn what he could of what was passing out of doors; and Louis helped in a plan by which Clery was to tell whatever he could learn.  Louis and his sister now played battledore and other games after dinner, in an outer room, their aunt sitting by with her book or work.  Clery sat down with his book, and the children made all the noise they could with their play, that Clery might speak to the princess unheard by the guard.  Neither he nor the princess raised their heads from their books, and Clery moved his lips as little as he could; so that no one who was not listening could have supposed that he was speaking.",sorrow increase time go king separate family queen grief alarm gaoler party allow take meal condition speak hear become necessary learn pass door help plan tell learn sister play battledore other game dinner outer room aunt sit book work sit book child make noise play speak princess unheard guard princess raise head book move lip little listen suppose speak 
3,"The Dauphin cheered and amused his parents by his childish fun and little pranks; but yet, every one observed that he never forgot that he was in a prison.  It was painful to see a boy so young acting with the caution of an old person, from the consciousness of being surrounded by enemies.  Some of his caution was owing to fear, and some to the gentleness of his temper.  He was never heard to speak of the Tuileries or of Versailles, though it was certain that he had a vivid remembrance of the kind of life he had led there.  He thought it would grieve his parents to be reminded of their palaces, and of the days of their power. One morning, he declared, when asked, that he had seen before an officer who came to guard them for the first time.  The officer asked him repeatedly where he had seen him, but Louis would not say.  At last, he whispered to his mother, ""It was when we were coming back from Varennes.""  When any guard more civil than the rest appeared on duty, Louis always ran with the good news to the queen.  One day, a stone-mason was employed in making holes in the doorway of the outer room, in which large bolts were to be fixed.  While the man was at breakfast, Louis amused himself with his tools.  This was an opportunity for the king to gratify his well-known taste; and he began to work with the mallet and chisel, to show his boy the way.  The mason came back, and, moved by seeing the king so employed, said, ""When you get out, you will be able to say that you worked at your own bars.""",cheer amuse parent childish fun little prank one observe forget prison painful see boy young act caution old person consciousness surround enemy caution ow fear gentleness temper hear speak certain have vivid remembrance kind life lead think grieve parent remind palace day power morning declare ask see officer come guard first time officer ask see say last whisper mother come guard civil rest appear duty run good news queen day stone mason employ make hole doorway outer room large bolt fix man breakfast amuse tool opportunity king gratify know taste begin work mallet chisel show boy way mason come move see king employ say get able say work own bar 
4,"""Ah!"" said the king, ""when and how shall I get out?""  Louis burst out a-crying; and the king, throwing down the tools, went into his chamber, and paced up and down with long strides.",say king get burst cry king throw tool go chamber pace long stride 
5,"It appears that the king was touched with somewhat of the same superstition of which the queen gave occasional tokens,--like many other sufferers in a time of suspense.  No one liked to refuse to play with Louis when he wanted to play; so, one afternoon, when the king was very sad, he consented to a game at nine-pins, because his boy asked him. The Dauphin twice counted sixteen, and then lost the game.  ""Whenever I get sixteen,"" exclaimed he, a little vexed, ""I always lose the game."" The king, remembering that he was the sixteenth Louis, looked very grave; and Clery thought his mind was superstitiously impressed by the boy's words.",appear king touch same superstition queen give occasional token many other sufferer time suspense like refuse play want play afternoon king sad consent game pin boy ask count lose game get exclaim little vexed lose game king remember sixteenth look grave think mind impressed boy word 
6,"In the beginning of November a feverish complaint attacked the king, and then the whole family in turn.  The wife and sister of the king assisted Clery to nurse him, and often made his bed with their own hands.  Louis, who had slept in the king's room since the partial separation of the family, was the next attacked.  Not all that the queen could say availed to procure permission to remain with her child during the night.  Clery, however, never left him; and Louis had soon an opportunity of showing that he was grateful.",beginning feverish complaint attack king whole family turn wife sister king assist nurse make bed own hand sleep king room partial separation family next attack queen say avail procure permission remain child night leave have opportunity show grateful 
7,"Before the princesses had recovered, poor Clery was more ill, with rheumatic fever, than any of them had been.  He made a great effort to rise and attend the king, the first day; but his master, seeing the condition he was in, sent him to bed again, and himself took up his son, and dressed him.  Louis scarcely left Clery's bedside all day, bringing him drink, and doing all the little services he could think of.  The king found a moment to tell Clery, unobserved, that he should see the physician the next day; and the princesses went to visit him in the evening, when the Princess Elizabeth slipped into his hand some medicine which had been brought for her, as she was yet far from well.  It distressed Clery to accept this, and to know how the ladies undertook his duties,--the queen putting Louis to bed, and the Princess Elizabeth dressing the king's hair.  The Princess Elizabeth asked for medicines, as if for herself, that Clery might have them, even after he had left his bed, to which he was confined for six days.  Among other things she had obtained a box of ipecacuanha lozenges for his cough.  Having had no opportunity of giving these to Clery during the day, she left them with Louis when she bade him good-night, thinking that Clery would be up-stairs presently.  This was before nine.  It was just eleven when Clery came up, to turn down the king's bed.  Louis called to him in a low voice; and Clery was afraid that he was ill, as he was not asleep. ""No,"" Louis said, ""I am not ill; but I have a little box to give you.  I am glad you are come, at last, for I could hardly keep my eyes open; and they have been shut several times, I believe.""  Seeing that Clery was moved, Louis kissed him; and then was asleep in a minute.",princess recover poor ill rheumatic fever make great effort rise attend king first day master see condition send bed take son dress leave bedside day bring drink do little service think king find moment tell unobserve see physician next day princess go visit evening slip hand medicine bring distress accept know lady undertake duty queen put bed dress king hair ask medicine have leave bed confine day other thing obtain box ipecacuanha lozenge cough have opportunity give day leave bid good night think stair come turn king bed call low voice afraid ill asleep say ill have little box give glad come last keep eye open shut several time believe see move kiss asleep minute 
8,"At five in the morning of the 11th of December, everybody in the Temple was awakened by the noise of cavalry and cannon entering the garden, and the drums beating throughout the city.  Louis did not know what this meant; but his parents understood that the king was to be brought to trial, and that this noise arose from the military preparations for the great event.  His father took him by the hand, and led him to breakfast, as usual, at nine o'clock.  Nobody said much, because the guards were in the room; but he saw his father and mother look very expressively at each other when he and his father were going downstairs again, at ten o'clock.  He went to his lessons, as usual, and was reading to the king, when two officers came from the magistrates, to say that they must immediately take Louis to his mother.  Argument was useless; so Clery was desired to go with the boy.  On his return, Clery gave comfort to the king by assuring him that Louis really was with his mother.",morning 11th awaken noise cavalry enter garden drum beat city know mean parent understand king bring trial noise arise military preparation great event father take hand lead breakfast usual o'clock say much guard room see father mother look other father go o'clock go lesson usual read king officer come magistrate say take mother argument useless desire go boy return give comfort king assure mother 
9,"The king was soon after taken to the Convention, before whom he was to be tried.  Never till this day had the queen asked any question of her guards: and to-day she obtained no information, though she made every inquiry she could devise.  The king returned at six o'clock; but he was immediately locked up, without seeing any one.  No bed had yet been provided for Louis in his mother's room: and this night, she gave up hers to him, and sat up.  The princesses were most unwilling to leave her in the state of agitation she was in; but she insisted upon their going to rest.  The next day, she implored that if the king might see his wife and sister, his children should not be separated from him.  The reply was what might have been expected;--that the children must not be made messengers between their parents; but that they might be with their father, if they did not see the queen, till the trial was over. Occupied as the king was with his defence, this could not be: nor would he deprive their mother of the solace of their society: so Louis's bed was removed to his mother's room, and no one knew when he would see his father again.",king take try day queen ask question guard day obtain information make inquiry devise king return o'clock lock see one bed provide mother room night give sit princess unwilling leave state agitation insist go rest next day implore king see wife sister child separate reply expect child make messenger parent father see queen trial occupy king defence deprive mother solace society bed remove mother room know see father 
10,"Louis saw his father but once more.  It was in the evening of Sunday, the 20th of January.  The crier, who came into the street at seven o'clock, proclaimed the sentence that Louis Capet was to be executed the next day.",see father evening 20th crier come street o'clock proclaim sentence execute next day 
11,"The family were at last permitted to see the king; and at half-past eight were told that he was ready.  The queen took Louis by the hand, and led him downstairs, the princesses following.  It appears that the guards had some idea that the king would attempt suicide; for they would not allow him to have a knife at his dinner; and they now would not lose sight of him, even while meeting his family.  They would not have allowed the door to be shut, but that it was a glass door, through which they could look, on any alarm.  So far from the king having thought of suicide, it is now believed by most people that he allowed himself to be persuaded by his counsel and friends that there was not really much danger of his execution taking place, and that he would be permitted, at the last moment, to appeal to the Primary Assemblies, where an appeal would be successful.  This seems confirmed by his conduct on the scaffold.  He was, as he had been through life, deceived and mistaken; and the moment of his being undeceived was one of dreadful agony of mind.  It deprived him of all dignity and fortitude; and his struggles were such that it required the strength of three executioners to overpower him, and fulfil the sentence.  It is to be hoped that his family never knew this; and the mass of the crowd did not see what happened on the scaffold; but some who did see the whole, have proved beyond a doubt that Louis the Sixteenth showed, at last, no more dignity in his death than in his life.",family last permit see king half past tell ready queen take hand lead princess follow appear guard have idea king attempt suicide allow have knife dinner lose sight meet family allow door shut glass door look alarm king think suicide believe most person allow persuade counsel friend be much danger execution take place permit last moment appeal primary appeal successful seem confirm conduct scaffold life deceive mistaken moment undeceive dreadful agony mind deprive dignity fortitude struggle such require strength executioner overpower fulfil sentence hope family know mass crowd see happen scaffold see whole prove doubt sixteenth show last more dignity death life 
12,"How much hope he imparted to his family during their evening interview can now never be known; but his legal advisers and his servants gave him such abundant assurances that the sentence could never be really executed upon a king, that the hopes of his family were probably sustained by their words.  Not a sound, however, was heard by Clery outside the door.  The king sat between his wife and sister, and kept Louis standing between his knees,--the Princess Royal sitting nearly in front.  There was much weeping; and most that was said was by the king. He desired his boy to harbour no revenge against the authors of his death, and then gave him his blessing.",much hope impart family evening interview know legal adviser servant give such abundant assurance sentence execute king hope family sustain word sound hear door king sit wife sister keep stand knee sit front be much weeping most say king desire boy harbour revenge author death give blessing 
13,"When the peasant-child sees his father dying on his fever-bed, and knows that the question is in the heart of both parents, what is to become of the widow and her children, he may feel his little heart bursting with fear and sorrow, and may think that no one can be more unhappy than he. But Louis was more unhappy.  Here was his father, in the full vigour of his years, about to die a violent death, amidst the hatred of millions of men who, if all had done right, should have been attached to him, and have defended his life at the peril of their own.  For the peasant-child there is comfort in prospect.  His father's grave is respected in the churchyard; the neighbours are kind; there is the consolation of work for those who survive, and the free air, and the spring flowers, and the mowing, and the harvest, and all the pleasures which cannot be withheld from those who live at liberty in the country.  For the princely child there were none of these comforts.  As far as he could see, his father and mother had no friends; he and his family were in a dismal prison, with insulting enemies about them, and no prospect of any change for the better, when his father should have been thus violently torn away. Never, perhaps, was there a more miserable child than Louis was now.",peasant child see father die fever bed know question heart parent become widow child feel little heart burst fear sorrow think unhappy unhappy father full vigour year die violent death hatred million man do right attach defend life peril own peasant child be comfort prospect father grave respect churchyard neighbour kind be consolation work survive free air spring flower mowing harvest pleasure withhold live liberty country princely child be comfort see father mother have friend family dismal prison insult enemy prospect change good father tear be miserable child 
14,"The queen much wished to remain with the king all night; but the king saw that it was better that their strength should not be thus worn-out in grief, and he said that he needed some hours of rest and stillness. He promised that the family should come to him in the morning: and they therefore left him at a quarter past ten, having spent an hour and three-quarters with him.  He told Clery that he never intended to keep this promise, and should spare them and himself the affliction of such an interview.  The queen chose to put Louis to bed, as usual; but had hardly strength to do it.  She then threw herself, dressed, upon her own bed, where the princesses heard her shivering and sobbing with cold and grief, all night long.  The whole family were dressed by six, in expectation of being sent for by the king; and when the door opened, in a quarter of an hour, they thought the summons was come; but it was only an attendant, looking for a prayer-book, as a priest was going to say mass in the king's apartment.  Then they waited hour after hour, and do not seem to have suspected that the king would not keep his promise.  At a little after ten, the firing of the artillery, and the shouts in the streets of ""Long live the Republic,"" told them but too plainly that all was over.",queen wish remain king night king see good strength wear grief say need hour rest stillness promise family come morning leave quarter past spend hour quarter tell intend keep promise spare affliction interview queen choose put bed usual have strength do throw dress own bed princess hear shiver sobb cold grief night whole family dress expectation send king door open quarter hour think summons come attendant look prayer book priest go say mass king apartment wait hour hour seem suspect king keep promise little fire artillery shout street long live tell 
15,"The melancholy life they led went on through the rest of the winter and spring with little variety.  The parapet of the leads was raised, and every chink stopped up, to prevent the family seeing anything, or being seen when they walked; so that his daily exercise could have been but little of an amusement to the poor boy.  On the 25th of March, he was snatched up from sleep, in the middle of the night, in order that his bed might be searched, as it was believed that his mother and aunt carried on a correspondence with people without, by some secret means. Nothing was found in Louis's bed; and only a tradesman's address, and a stick of sealing-wax, in any of the apartments.  The princesses certainly contrived to conceal some pencils; for they had some remaining in the following October.  While the king was separated from them, they corresponded with him by putting small notes into the middle of balls of cotton, which were found by Clery in the linen-press, occasionally, and which would hardly have excited any suspicion if they had been seen there by the most watchful of the gaolers.  It is probable that the princesses communicated by the same method with people out of doors, when their linen went out or was brought in.  It certainly appears that they did carry on a correspondence by some means.  No one would blame them for this: but neither, when the situation and the fears of the new republicans are considered, assailed and invaded as they were by the powerful friends of royalty, can we wonder at the frequency and strictness of their searches, while certain that their orders were evaded by the prisoners.",melancholy life lead go rest winter spring little variety parapet lead raise chink stop prevent family see see walk daily exercise little amusement poor boy 25th snatch sleep middle night order bed search believe mother aunt carry correspondence person secret means find bed tradesman address stick sealing wax apartment princess contrive conceal pencil have remain follow king separate correspond put small note middle ball cotton find linen press excite suspicion see watchful gaoler probable princess communicate same method person door linen go bring appear carry correspondence means blame situation fear new consider assail invade powerful friend royalty wonder frequency strictness search certain order evade prisoner 
16,"On the 9th of May, poor Louis was taken ill with fever.  It was a very serious illness, and lasted nearly a month; and he never was in good health again.  The want of proper air, exercise, and play, and the dull life he led among melancholy companions, were quite enough to destroy the health _of any_ boy.  He was tenderly nursed by his mother and aunt, and his sister played with him; but there was no peace in their minds, and no mirth in their faces, to cheer his young heart.  One anecdote shows how sad their manners were now.  Tison's wife, who did some of the work of their chambers, went mad, and talked to herself in a way so ridiculous, that the Princess Royal could not help laughing.  This made the queen and Princess Elizabeth look at her with pleasure--it was so long since they had seen her laugh!  And yet this poor girl who never laughed was then only fifteen years old, and her brother not yet nine.",9th poor take ill fever serious illness last month good health want proper air exercise play dull life lead melancholy companion enough destroy health any_ boy nurse mother aunt sister play be peace mind mirth face cheer young heart anecdote show sad manners wife do work chamber go mad talk way ridiculous help laugh make queen look pleasure long see laugh poor girl laugh year old brother
