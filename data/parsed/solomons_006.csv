1,CHAPTER V. OUR MARCH INTO THE DESERT,
2,"We had killed nine elephants, and it took us two days to cut out the tusks, and having brought them into camp, to bury them carefully in the sand under a large tree, which made a conspicuous mark for miles round. It was a wonderfully fine lot of ivory. I never saw a better, averaging as it did between forty and fifty pounds a tusk. The tusks of the great bull that killed poor Khiva scaled one hundred and seventy pounds the pair, so nearly as we could judge.",kill elephant take day cut tusk bring camp bury sand large tree make conspicuous mark mile fine lot ivory see good average do pound tusk tusk great bull kill poor scal pound pair judge 
3,"As for Khiva himself, we buried what remained of him in an ant-bear hole, together with an assegai to protect himself with on his journey to a better world. On the third day we marched again, hoping that we might live to return to dig up our buried ivory, and in due course, after a long and wearisome tramp, and many adventures which I have not space to detail, we reached Sitanda's Kraal, near the Lukanga River, the real starting-point of our expedition. Very well do I recollect our arrival at that place. To the right was a scattered native settlement with a few stone cattle kraals and some cultivated lands down by the water, where these savages grew their scanty supply of grain, and beyond it stretched great tracts of waving ""veld"" covered with tall grass, over which herds of the smaller game were wandering. To the left lay the vast desert. This spot appears to be the outpost of the fertile country, and it would be difficult to say to what natural causes such an abrupt change in the character of the soil is due. But so it is.",bury remain ant bear hole assegai protect journey good world third day march hope live return dig bury ivory due course long wearisome tramp many adventure have space detail reach real starting point expedition recollect arrival place right scatter native settlement few stone cattle kraal cultivate land water savage grow scanty supply grain stretch great tract wave veld cover tall grass herd small game wonder left lay vast desert spot appear outpost fertile country difficult say natural cause abrupt change character soil due 
4,"Just below our encampment flowed a little stream, on the farther side of which is a stony slope, the same down which, twenty years before, I had seen poor Silvestre creeping back after his attempt to reach Solomon's Mines, and beyond that slope begins the waterless desert, covered with a species of karoo shrub.",encampment flow little stream far side stony slope same year see poor creep attempt reach slope begin waterless desert cover species karoo shrub 
5,"It was evening when we pitched our camp, and the great ball of the sun was sinking into the desert, sending glorious rays of many-coloured light flying all over its vast expanse. Leaving Good to superintend the arrangement of our little camp, I took Sir Henry with me, and walking to the top of the slope opposite, we gazed across the desert. The air was very clear, and far, far away I could distinguish the faint blue outlines, here and there capped with white, of the Suliman Berg.",evening pitch camp great ball sun sink desert send glorious ray many coloured light fly vast expanse leave good superintend arrangement little camp take walk top slope gaze desert air clear distinguish faint blue outline cap white

10,"""Is it to that land that thou wouldst journey, Incubu?"" (a native word meaning, I believe, an elephant, and the name given to Sir Henry by the Kafirs), he said, pointing towards the mountain with his broad assegai.",land journey native word meaning believe elephant name give say point mountain broad assegai 
11,"I asked him sharply what he meant by addressing his master in that familiar way. It is very well for natives to have a name for one among themselves, but it is not decent that they should call a white man by their heathenish appellations to his face. The Zulu laughed a quiet little laugh which angered me.",ask mean address master familiar way native have name decent call white man heathenish appellation face laugh quiet little laugh anger 
12,"""How dost thou know that I am not the equal of the Inkosi whom I serve?"" he said. ""He is of a royal house, no doubt; one can see it in his size and by his mien; so, mayhap, am I.

13,"I was angry with the man, for I am not accustomed to be talked to in that way by Kafirs, but somehow he impressed me, and besides I was curious to know what he had to say. So I translated, expressing my opinion at the same time that he was an impudent fellow, and that his swagger was outrageous.",angry man accustom talk way impress curious know have say translate express opinion same time impudent fellow swagger outrageous

25,"""Yes,"" answered Sir Henry, ""it is far. But there is no journey upon this earth that a man may not make if he sets his heart to it. There is nothing, Umbopa, that he cannot do, there are no mountains he may not climb, there are no deserts he cannot cross, save a mountain and a desert of which you are spared the knowledge, if love leads him and he holds his life in his hands counting it as nothing, ready to keep it or lose it as Heaven above may order.""",answer be journey earth man make set heart be do be mountain climb be desert cross save mountain desert spare knowledge love lead hold life hand count ready keep lose order

But if that seed be good and heavy it may perchance travel a little way on the road it wills. It is well to try and journey one's road and to fight with the air. Man must die.

28,"He paused awhile, and then went on with one of those strange bursts of rhetorical eloquence that Zulus sometimes indulge in, which to my mind, full though they are of vain repetitions, show that the race is by no means devoid of poetic instinct and of intellectual power.",pause go strange burst rhetorical eloquence indulge mind full vain repetition show race means devoid poetic instinct intellectual power

40,"Next day we made our arrangements for starting. Of course it was impossible to drag our heavy elephant rifles and other kit with us across the desert, so, dismissing our bearers, we made an arrangement with an old native who had a kraal close by to take care of them till we returned. It went to my heart to leave such things as those sweet tools to the tender mercies of an old thief of a savage whose greedy eyes I could see gloating over them. But I took some precautions.",next day make arrangement start course impossible drag heavy elephant rifle other kit desert dismiss bearer make arrangement old native have kraal take care return go heart leave such thing sweet tool tender mercie old thief savage greedy eye see gloat take precaution 
41,"First of all I loaded all the rifles, placing them at full cock, and informed him that if he touched them they would go off. He tried the experiment instantly with my eight-bore, and it did go off, and blew a hole right through one of his oxen, which were just then being driven up to the kraal, to say nothing of knocking him head over heels with the recoil. He got up considerably startled, and not at all pleased at the loss of the ox, which he had the impudence to ask me to pay for, and nothing would induce him to touch the guns again.",first load rifle place full cock inform touch go try experiment bore go blow hole oxen drive kraal say knock head heel recoil get startle pleased loss ox have impudence ask pay induce touch gun

44,"Having thus disposed of our superfluous gear we arranged the kit we five--Sir Henry, Good, myself, Umbopa, and the Hottentot Ventvögel--were to take with us on our journey. It was small enough, but do what we would we could not get its weight down under about forty pounds a man.

53,"This was our total equipment, a small one indeed for such a venture, but we dared not attempt to carry more. Indeed, that load was a heavy one per man with which to travel across the burning desert, for in such places every additional ounce tells. But we could not see our way to reducing the weight. There was nothing taken but what was absolutely necessary.",total equipment small one venture attempt carry more load heavy one man travel burning desert such place additional ounce tell see way reduce weight be take necessary 
54,"With great difficulty, and by the promise of a present of a good hunting-knife each, I succeeded in persuading three wretched natives from the village to come with us for the first stage, twenty miles, and to carry a large gourd holding a gallon of water apiece. My object was to enable us to refill our water-bottles after the first night's march, for we determined to start in the cool of the evening. I gave out to these natives that we were going to shoot ostriches, with which the desert abounded. They jabbered and shrugged their shoulders, saying that we were mad and should perish of thirst, which I must say seemed probable; but being desirous of obtaining the knives, which were almost unknown treasures up there, they consented to come, having probably reflected that, after all, our subsequent extinction would be no affair of theirs.",great difficulty promise present good hunting knife succeed persuade wretch native village come first stage mile carry large gourd hold gallon water apiece object enable refill water bottle first night march determine start cool evening give native go shoot ostriche desert abound jabber shrugg shoulder say mad perish thirst say seem probable desirous obtain knife unknown treasure consent come reflect subsequent extinction affair 
55,"All next day we rested and slept, and at sunset ate a hearty meal of fresh beef washed down with tea, the last, as Good remarked sadly, we were likely to drink for many a long day. Then, having made our final preparations, we lay down and waited for the moon to rise. At last, about nine o'clock, up she came in all her glory, flooding the wild country with light, and throwing a silver sheen on the expanse of rolling desert before us, which looked as solemn and quiet and as alien to man as the star-studded firmament above. We rose up, and in a few minutes were ready, and yet we hesitated a little, as human nature is prone to hesitate on the threshold of an irrevocable step. We three white men stood by ourselves. Umbopa, assegai in hand and a rifle across his shoulders, looked out fixedly across the desert a few paces ahead of us; while the hired natives, with the gourds of water, and Ventvögel, were gathered in a little knot behind.",next day rest sleep sunset eat hearty meal fresh beef wash tea last remark likely drink many long day make final preparation lay wait moon rise last o'clock come glory flood wild country light throw silver sheen expanse roll desert look solemn quiet alien man star studd firmament rise few minute ready hesitate little human nature prone hesitate threshold irrevocable step white man stand assegai hand rifle shoulder look desert few pace hire native gourd water gather little knot 
56,"""Gentlemen,"" said Sir Henry presently, in his deep voice, ""we are going on about as strange a journey as men can make in this world. It is very doubtful if we can succeed in it. But we are three men who will stand together for good or for evil to the last. Now before we start let us for a moment pray to the Power who shapes the destinies of men, and who ages since has marked out our paths, that it may please Him to direct our steps in accordance with His will.""",gentlemen say deep voice go strange journey man make world doubtful succeed man stand good evil last start let moment pray power shape destiny man age mark path please direct step accordance will

58,"I do not say that I am a first-rate praying man, few hunters are, and as for Sir Henry, I never heard him speak like that before, and only once since, though deep down in his heart I believe that he is very religious. Good too is pious, though apt to swear. Anyhow I do not remember, excepting on one single occasion, ever putting up a better prayer in my life than I did during that minute, and somehow I felt the happier for it. Our future was so completely unknown, and I think that the unknown and the awful always bring a man nearer to his Maker.",say first rate praying man few hunter hear speak deep heart believe religious good pious apt swear remember except single occasion put good prayer life do minute feel happy future unknown think unknown awful bring man nearer 
59,"""And now,"" said Sir Henry, ""_trek_!""",say 
60,So we started.,start 
61,"We had nothing to guide ourselves by except the distant mountains and old José da Silvestre's chart, which, considering that it was drawn by a dying and half-distraught man on a fragment of linen three centuries ago, was not a very satisfactory sort of thing to work with. Still, our sole hope of success depended upon it, such as it was. If we failed in finding that pool of bad water which the old Dom marked as being situated in the middle of the desert, about sixty miles from our starting-point, and as far from the mountains, in all probability we must perish miserably of thirst. But to my mind the chances of our finding it in that great sea of sand and karoo scrub seemed almost infinitesimal. Even supposing that da Silvestra had marked the pool correctly, what was there to prevent its having been dried up by the sun generations ago, or trampled in by game, or filled with the drifting sand?",have guide distant mountain old chart consider draw die half distraught man fragment linen century satisfactory sort thing work sole hope success depend such fail find pool bad water old dom mark situate middle desert mile starting point mountain probability perish thirst mind chance find great sea sand karoo scrub seem infinitesimal suppose mark pool prevent dry sun generation trample game fill drifting sand 
62,"On we tramped silently as shades through the night and in the heavy sand. The karoo bushes caught our feet and retarded us, and the sand worked into our veldtschoons and Good's shooting-boots, so that every few miles we had to stop and empty them; but still the night kept fairly cool, though the atmosphere was thick and heavy, giving a sort of creamy feel to the air, and we made fair progress. It was very silent and lonely there in the desert, oppressively so indeed. Good felt this, and once began to whistle ""The Girl I left behind me,"" but the notes sounded lugubrious in that vast place, and he gave it up.",tramp shade night heavy sand karoo bush catch foot retarded sand work veldtschon shooting boot few mile have stop empty night keep cool atmosphere thick heavy give sort creamy feel air make fair progress silent lonely desert good feel begin whistle leave note sound lugubrious vast place give 
63,"Shortly afterwards a little incident occurred which, though it startled us at the time, gave rise to a laugh. Good was leading, as the holder of the compass, which, being a sailor, of course he understood thoroughly, and we were toiling along in single file behind him, when suddenly we heard the sound of an exclamation, and he vanished. Next second there arose all around us a most extraordinary hubbub, snorts, groans, and wild sounds of rushing feet. In the faint light, too, we could descry dim galloping forms half hidden by wreaths of sand. The natives threw down their loads and prepared to bolt, but remembering that there was nowhere to run to, they cast themselves upon the ground and howled out that it was ghosts. As for Sir Henry and myself, we stood amazed; nor was our amazement lessened when we perceived the form of Good careering off in the direction of the mountains, apparently mounted on the back of a horse and halloaing wildly. In another second he threw up his arms, and we heard him come to the earth with a thud.",little incident occur startle time give rise laugh good lead holder compass sailor course understand toil single file hear sound exclamation vanish second arise extraordinary hubbub snort groan wild sound rush foot faint light descry dim gallop form half hide wreath sand native throw load prepare bolt remember be run cast ground howl ghost stand amaze amazement lessen perceive form good career direction mountain mount back horse halloa second throw arm hear come earth thud 
64,"Then I saw what had happened; we had stumbled upon a herd of sleeping quagga, on to the back of one of which Good actually had fallen, and the brute naturally enough got up and made off with him. Calling out to the others that it was all right, I ran towards Good, much afraid lest he should be hurt, but to my great relief I found him sitting in the sand, his eye-glass still fixed firmly in his eye, rather shaken and very much frightened, but not in any way injured.",see happen stumble herd sleeping quagga back fall brute get make calling other right run afraid hurt great relief find sit sand eye glass fix eye shake frighten way injure 
65,"After this we travelled on without any further misadventure till about one o'clock, when we called a halt, and having drunk a little water, not much, for water was precious, and rested for half an hour, we started again.",travel further misadventure o'clock call halt drink little water much water precious rest hour start 
66,"On, on we went, till at last the east began to blush like the cheek of a girl. Then there came faint rays of primrose light, that changed presently to golden bars, through which the dawn glided out across the desert. The stars grew pale and paler still, till at last they vanished; the golden moon waxed wan, and her mountain ridges stood out against her sickly face like the bones on the cheek of a dying man. Then came spear upon spear of light flashing far away across the boundless wilderness, piercing and firing the veils of mist, till the desert was draped in a tremulous golden glow, and it was day.",go last east begin blush cheek girl come faint ray primrose light change golden bar dawn glide desert star grow pale paler last vanish golden moon wax want mountain ridge stand sickly face bone cheek die man come spear spear light flash boundless wilderness pierce fire veil mist desert drape tremulous golden glow day 
67,"Still we did not halt, though by this time we should have been glad enough to do so, for we knew that when once the sun was fully up it would be almost impossible for us to travel. At length, about an hour later, we spied a little pile of boulders rising out of the plain, and to this we dragged ourselves. As luck would have it, here we found an overhanging slab of rock carpeted beneath with smooth sand, which afforded a most grateful shelter from the heat. Underneath this we crept, and each of us having drunk some water and eaten a bit of biltong, we lay down and soon were sound asleep.",halt time glad do know sun impossible travel length hour spy little pile boulder rise plain drag luck have find overhang slab rock carpet smooth sand afford grateful shelter heat creep drink water eat bit biltong lay sound asleep 
68,"It was three o'clock in the afternoon before we woke, to find our bearers preparing to return. They had seen enough of the desert already, and no number of knives would have tempted them to come a step farther. So we took a hearty drink, and having emptied our water-bottles, filled them up again from the gourds that they had brought with them, and then watched them depart on their twenty miles' tramp home.",o'clock afternoon wake find bearer prepare return see enough desert number knife tempt come step take hearty drink empty water bottle fill gourd bring watch depart mile tramp home 
69,"At half-past four we also started. It was lonely and desolate work, for with the exception of a few ostriches there was not a single living creature to be seen on all the vast expanse of sandy plain. Evidently it was too dry for game, and with the exception of a deadly-looking cobra or two we saw no reptiles. One insect, however, we found abundant, and that was the common or house fly. There they came, ""not as single spies, but in battalions,"" as I think the Old Testament[1] says somewhere. He is an extraordinary insect is the house fly. Go where you will you find him, and so it must have been always. I have seen him enclosed in amber, which is, I was told, quite half a million years old, looking exactly like his descendant of to-day, and I have little doubt but that when the last man lies dying on the earth he will be buzzing round--if this event happens to occur in summer--watching for an opportunity to settle on his nose.",half past start lonely desolate work exception few ostriche single living creature see vast expanse sandy plain dry game exception deadly look cobra see reptile insect find abundant common house fly come single spy battalion think old say extraordinary insect house fly go find see enclose amber tell year old look descendant day have little doubt last man lie die earth buzz event happen occur summer watch opportunity settle nose 
70,"At sunset we halted, waiting for the moon to rise. At last she came up, beautiful and serene as ever, and, with one halt about two o'clock in the morning, we trudged on wearily through the night, till at last the welcome sun put a period to our labours. We drank a little and flung ourselves down on the sand, thoroughly tired out, and soon were all asleep. There was no need to set a watch, for we had nothing to fear from anybody or anything in that vast untenanted plain. Our only enemies were heat, thirst, and flies, but far rather would I have faced any danger from man or beast than that awful trinity. This time we were not so lucky as to find a sheltering rock to guard us from the glare of the sun, with the result that about seven o'clock we woke up experiencing the exact sensations one would attribute to a beefsteak on a gridiron. We were literally being baked through and through. The burning sun seemed to be sucking our very blood out of us. We sat up and gasped.",sunset halt wait moon rise last come beautiful serene halt o'clock morning trudge night last welcome sun put period labour drink little flung sand tired asleep be need set watch have fear vast untenanted plain only enemy heat thirst fly face danger man beast awful trinity time lucky find shelter rock guard glare sun result o'clock wake experience exact sensation attribute beefsteak gridiron bake burning sun seem suck very blood sit gasp

74,"It was hot, indeed, and there was not a bit of shelter to be found.

78,"It did not seem a very promising suggestion, but at least it was better than nothing, so we set to work, and, with the trowel we had brought with us and the help of our hands, in about an hour we succeeded in delving out a patch of ground some ten feet long by twelve wide to the depth of two feet. Then we cut a quantity of low scrub with our hunting-knives, and creeping into the hole, pulled it over us all, with the exception of Ventvögel, on whom, being a Hottentot, the heat had no particular effect. This gave us some slight shelter from the burning rays of the sun, but the atmosphere in that amateur grave can be better imagined than described. The Black Hole of Calcutta must have been a fool to it; indeed, to this moment I do not know how we lived through the day. There we lay panting, and every now and again moistening our lips from our scanty supply of water. Had we followed our inclinations we should have finished all we possessed in the first two hours, but we were forced to exercise the most rigid care, for if our water failed us we knew that very soon we must perish miserably.",seem promising suggestion least good set work trowel bring help hand hour succeed delve patch ground foot wide depth foot cut quantity low scrub hunting knife creep hole pull exception heat have particular effect give slight shelter burning ray sun atmosphere amateur grave imagine describe black fool moment know live day lay panting moisten lip scanty supply water follow inclination finish possess first hour force exercise rigid care water fail know perish 
79,"But everything has an end, if only you live long enough to see it, and somehow that miserable day wore on towards evening. About three o'clock in the afternoon we determined that we could bear it no longer. It would be better to die walking that to be killed slowly by heat and thirst in this dreadful hole. So taking each of us a little drink from our fast diminishing supply of water, now warmed to about the same temperature as a man's blood, we staggered forward.",have end live see miserable day wear evening o'clock afternoon determine bear good die walk kill heat thirst dreadful hole take little drink fast diminish supply water warm same temperature man blood stagger 
80,"We had then covered some fifty miles of wilderness. If the reader will refer to the rough copy and translation of old da Silvestra's map, he will see that the desert is marked as measuring forty leagues across, and the ""pan bad water"" is set down as being about in the middle of it. Now forty leagues is one hundred and twenty miles, consequently we ought at the most to be within twelve or fifteen miles of the water if any should really exist.",cover mile wilderness reader refer rough copy translation old map see desert mark measure league pan bad water set middle league mile most mile water exist 
81,"Through the afternoon we crept slowly and painfully along, scarcely doing more than a mile and a half in an hour. At sunset we rested again, waiting for the moon, and after drinking a little managed to get some sleep.",afternoon creep do more mile half hour sunset rest wait moon drink little manage get sleep 
82,"Before we lay down, Umbopa pointed out to us a slight and indistinct hillock on the flat surface of the plain about eight miles away. At the distance it looked like an ant-hill, and as I was dropping off to sleep I fell to wondering what it could be.",lay point slight indistinct hillock flat surface plain mile distance look ant hill drop sleep fall wonder 
83,"With the moon we marched again, feeling dreadfully exhausted, and suffering tortures from thirst and prickly heat. Nobody who has not felt it can know what we went through. We walked no longer, we staggered, now and again falling from exhaustion, and being obliged to call a halt every hour or so. We had scarcely energy left in us to speak. Up to this Good had chatted and joked, for he is a merry fellow; but now he had not a joke in him.",moon march feel exhaust suffer torture thirst prickly heat feel know go walk stagger fall exhaustion oblige call halt hour have energy leave speak chate joke merry fellow have joke 
84,"At last, about two o'clock, utterly worn out in body and mind, we came to the foot of the queer hill, or sand koppie, which at first sight resembled a gigantic ant-heap about a hundred feet high, and covering at the base nearly two acres of ground.",last o'clock wear body mind come foot queer hill sand koppie first sight resemble gigantic ant heap foot high cover base acre ground 
85,"Here we halted, and driven to it by our desperate thirst, sucked down our last drops of water. We had but half a pint a head, and each of us could have drunk a gallon.",halt drive desperate thirst suck last drop water have pint head drink gallon 
86,Then we lay down. Just as I was dropping off to sleep I heard Umbopa remark to himself in Zulu--,lay drop sleep hear remark
