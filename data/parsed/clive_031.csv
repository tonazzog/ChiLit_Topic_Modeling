2," The fire of the batteries increased, and by the 13th of January the enemy's fire was completely silenced. The provisions in the town were wholly exhausted, and on the 16th the town surrendered, and the next morning the English took possession. Three days afterwards Lally was embarked on board ship, to be taken a prisoner to Madras; and so much was he hated that the French officers and civilians assembled, and hissed and hooted him; and, had he not been protected by his guard, would have torn him to pieces. After his return to France he was tried for having, by his conduct, caused the loss of the French possessions in India, and being found guilty of the offence, was beheaded.",fire battery increase 13th enemy fire silence provision town exhaust 16th town surrender next morning take possession day embark board ship take prisoner much hate french officer civilian assemble hiss hoot protect guard tear piece return try conduct cause loss french possession find guilty offence behead 
3,"At Pondicherry two thousand and seventy-two military prisoners were taken, and three hundred and eighty-one civilians. Five hundred cannon and a hundred mortars, fit for service; and immense quantities of ammunition, arms, and military stores fell into the hands of the captors.",military prisoner take civilian cannon mortar fit service immense quantity ammunition arm military store fall hand captor 
4,"Pondicherry was handed over to the Company; who, a short time afterwards, entirely demolished both the fortress and town. This hard measure was the consequence of a letter which had been intercepted, from the French government to Lally, ordering him to raze Madras to the ground, when it fell into his hands.",hand company short time demolish fortress town hard measure consequence letter intercept french government order raze ground fall hand 
5,"Charlie, after the siege, in which he had rendered great services, received from the Company, at Colonel Coote's earnest recommendation, his promotion to the step of lieutenant colonel; while Peters was raised to that of major. A fortnight after the fall of Pondicherry, they returned to Madras, and thence took the first ship for England. It was now just ten years since they had sailed, and in that time they had seen Madras and Calcutta rise, from the rank of two trading stations, in constant danger of destruction by their powerful neighbours, to that of virtual capitals of great provinces. Not as yet, indeed, had they openly assumed the sovereignty of these territories; but Madras was, in fact, the absolute master of the broad tract of land extending from the foot of the mountains to the sea, from Cape Comorin to Bengal; while Calcutta was master of Bengal and Oressa, and her power already threatened to extend itself as far as Delhi. The conquest of these vast tracts of country had been achieved by mere handfuls of men, and by a display of heroic valour and constancy scarce to be rivalled in the history of the world.",siege render great service receive earnest recommendation promotion step lieutenant colonel raise major fortnight fall return thence take first ship year sail time see rise rank trading station constant danger destruction powerful neighbour virtual capital great province assume sovereignty territory fact absolute master broad tract land extend foot mountain sea master power threaten extend conquest vast tract country achieve mere handful man display heroic valour constancy scarce rivall history world 
6,"The voyage was a pleasant one, and was, for the times, quick, occupying only five months. But to the young men, longing for home after so long an absence, it seemed tedious in the extreme.",voyage pleasant one time quick occupy month young man long home absence seem tedious extreme 
7,"Tim and Hossein were well content with their quiet, easy life, after their long toils. They had nothing whatever to do, except that they insisted upon waiting upon Charlie and Peters, at meals. The ship carried a large number of sick and wounded officers and men, and as these gained health and strength, the life on board ship became livelier, and more jovial. Singing and cards occupied the evenings, while in the daytime they played quoits, rings of rope being used for that purpose, and other games with which passengers usually wile away the monotony of long voyages.",content quiet easy life long toil have do insist wait meal ship carry large number sick wound officer man gain health strength life board ship become lively jovial sing card occupy evening daytime play quoit ring rope use purpose other game passenger wile monotony long voyage 
8,"It was late in June when the Madras sailed up the Thames; and, as soon as she came to anchor, the two officers and their followers landed. The din and bustle of the streets seemed almost as strange, to Charlie, as they had done when he came up a boy, from Yarmouth. Hossein was astonished at the multitude of white people, and inquired of Charlie why, when there were so many men, England had sent so few soldiers to fight for her in India; and for once, Charlie was unable to give a satisfactory reply.",late sail come anchor officer follower land din bustle street seem strange do come boy astonished multitude white person inquire be many man send few soldier fight unable give satisfactory reply 
9,"""It does seem strange,"" he said to Peters, ""that when such mighty interests were at stake, a body of even ten thousand troops could not have been raised, and sent out. Such a force would have decided the struggle at once; and in three months the great possessions, which have cost the Company twelve years' war, would have been at their feet. It would not have cost them more; indeed, nothing like as much as it now has done, nor one tithe of the loss in life. Somehow, England always seems to make war in driblets.""",seem strange say such mighty interest stake body troops raise send force decide struggle month great possession cost company year war foot cost more much do tithe loss life seem make war driblet 
10,"Charlie knew that his mother and Kate had, for some years, been residing at a house which their uncle had taken, in the fashionable quarter of Chelsea. They looked in at the office, however, to see if Charlie's uncle was there; but found that he was not in the city, and, indeed, had now almost retired from the business. They therefore took a coach, placed the small articles of luggage which they had brought with them, from the ship, on the front seats; and then, Hossein and Tim taking their places on the broad seat beside the driver, they entered the coach and drove to Chelsea.",know mother year reside house uncle take fashionable quarter look office see uncle find city retire business take coach place small article luggage bring ship front seat take place broad seat driver enter coach drive 
11,"Charlie had invited Peters, who had no home of his own, to stay with him, at least for a while. Both were now rich men, from their shares of the prize money of the various forts and towns, in whose capture they had taken part; although Charlie possessed some twenty thousand pounds more than his friend, this being the amount of the presents he had received, from the Rajah of Ambur.",invite have home own stay least while rich man share prize money various fort town capture take part possess pound more friend amount present receive 
12,"Alighting from the carriage, Charlie ran up to the door and knocked. Inquiring for Mrs. Marryat, he was shown into a room in which a lady, somewhat past middle age, and three younger ones were sitting. They looked up, in surprise, as the young man entered. Ten years had changed him almost beyond recognition, but one of the younger ones at once leaped to her feet, and exclaimed, ""Charlie!""",alight carriage run door knock inquir show room lady middle age young one sit look surprise young man enter year change recognition young one leap foot exclaim 
13,"His mother rose with a cry of joy, and threw herself into his arms. After rapturously kissing her, he turned to the others. Their faces were changed, yet all seemed equally familiar to him, and in his delight he equally embraced them all.",mother rise cry joy throw arm kiss turn other face change seem familiar delight embrace 
14,"""Hullo!"" he exclaimed, when he freed himself from their arms. ""Why, there are three of you! What on earth am I doing? I have somebody's pardon to beg; and yet, although your faces are changed, they seem equally familiar to me. Which is it?",exclaim free arm be earth do have pardon beg face change seem familiar 
15,"""But I need not ask,"" he said, as a cloud of colour flowed over the face of one of the girls, while the others smiled mischievously.",ask say cloud colour flow face girl other smile 
16,"""You are Katie,"" he said, ""and you are Lizzie, certainly, and this is--why, it is Ada!",say 
17,"""This is a surprise, indeed; but I sha'n't beg your pardon, Ada, for I kissed you at parting, and quite intended to do so when I met again, at least if you had offered no violent objection.",surprise beg pardon kiss parting intend do meet least offer violent objection 
18,"""How you are all grown and changed, while you, Mother, look scarcely older than when I left you.",grow change mother look old leave 
19,"""But there, I have quite forgotten Peters. He has come home with me, and will stay till he has formed his own plans.""",forget come stay form own plan 
20,"He hurried out and brought in Peters; who, not wishing to be present at the family meeting, had been paying the coachman, and seeing to the things being brought into the house. He was warmly received, by the ladies, as the friend and companion of Charlie in his adventures; scarcely a letter having been received, from the latter, without mention having been made of his comrade.",hurry bring wish present family meeting pay coachman see thing bring house receive lady friend companion adventure letter receive latter mention make comrade 
21,"In a minute or two Mr. Tufton, who had been in the large garden behind the house, hurried in. He was now quite an old man; and under the influence of age, and the cheerful society of Mrs. Marryat and her daughters, he had lost much of the pomposity which had before distinguished him.",minute large garden house hurry old man influence age cheerful society daughter lose much pomposity distinguish 
22,"""Ah! Nephew,"" he said, when the happy party had sat down to dinner, their number increased by the arrival of Mrs. Haines, who had a house close by; ""wilful lads will go their own way. I wanted to make a rich merchant of you, and you have made of yourself a famous soldier. But you've not done badly for yourself after all; for you have, in your letters, often talked about prize money.""",nephew say happy party sit dinner number increase arrival have house wilful lad go own way want make rich merchant make famous soldier do letter talk prize money 
23,"""Yes, Uncle. I have earned, in my way, close upon a hundred thousand pounds; and I certainly shouldn't have made that if I had stuck to the office at Madras, even with the aid of the capital you offered to lend me, to trade with on my own account.""",earn way close pound make stick office aid capital offer lend trade own account 
24,"There was a general exclamation of surprise and pleasure, at the mention of the sum; although this amount was small, in comparison to that which many acquired, in those days, in India.",be general exclamation surprise pleasure mention sum amount small comparison many acquire day 
25,"""And you're not thinking of going back again, Charlie?"" his mother said, anxiously. ""There can be no longer any reason for your exposing yourself to that horrible climate, and that constant fighting.""",think go mother say be reason expose horrible climate constant fighting 
26,"""The climate is not so bad, Mother, and the danger and excitement of a soldier's life there, at present, render it very fascinating. But I have done with it. Peters and I intend, on the expiration of our leave, to resign our commissions in the Company's service, and to settle down under our own vines and fig trees. Tim has already elected himself to the post of my butler, and Hossein intends to be my valet and body servant.""",climate bad mother danger excitement soldier life present render fascinating do intend expiration leave resign commission company service settle own vine fig tree elect post butler intend valet body servant 
27,"Immediately after their arrival, Charlie had brought in his faithful followers and introduced them to the ladies; who, having often heard of their devotion and faithful services, had received them with a kindness and cordiality which had delighted them.",arrival bring faithful follower introduce lady hear devotion faithful service receive kindness cordiality delight 
28,"Lizzie, whose appearance at home had been unexpected by Charlie, for her husband was a landed gentleman at Seven Oaks, in Kent, was, it appeared, paying a visit of a week to her mother; and her three children, two boys and a little girl, were duly brought down to be shown to, and admired by, their Uncle Charles.",appearance home unexpected husband land gentleman appear pay visit week mother child boy little girl bring show admire 
29,"""And how is it you haven't married, Katie? With such a pretty face as yours, it is scandalous that the men have allowed you to reach the mature age of twenty-two, unmarried.""",marry pretty face scandalous man allow reach mature age unmarried 
30,"""It is the fault of the hussy herself,"" Mr. Tufton said. ""It is not from want of offers, for she has had a dozen, and among them some of the nobility at court; for it is well known that John Tufton's niece will have a dowry such as many of the nobles could not give, to their daughters.""",fault hussy say want offer have nobility court know niece have dowry such many noble give daughter 
31,"""This is too bad, Kate,"" Charlie said, laughing. ""What excuse have you to make for yourself for remaining single, with all these advantages of face and fortune?""",bad say laugh excuse have make remain single advantage face fortune 
32,"""Simply that I didn't like any of them,"" Katie said. ""The beaux of the present day are contemptible. I would as soon think of marrying a wax doll. When I do marry; that is, if ever I do, it shall be a man, and not a mere tailor's dummy.""",like say beaux present day contemptible think marry wax doll marry do man mere tailor dummy 
33,"""You are pert, miss,"" her uncle said.",pert miss uncle say 
34,"""Do what I will, Charlie, I cannot teach the hussy to order her tongue.""",do teach hussy order tongue 
35,"""Katie's quite right, Uncle,"" Charlie laughed. ""And I must make it my duty to find a man who will suit her taste; though, according to your account of her, he will find it a hard task to keep such a Xanthippe in order.""",right laugh make duty find man suit taste accord account find hard task keep order 
36,Katie tossed her head.,toss head 
37,"""He'd better not try,"" she said saucily, ""or it will be worse for him.""",try say bad 
38,"Two days later, Charlie's elder sister returned with her family to her house at Sevenoaks; where Charlie promised, before long, to pay her a visit. After she had gone, Charlie and Peters, with Katie, made a series of excursions to all the points of interest, round London; and on these occasions Ada usually accompanied them.",day elder sister return family house promise pay visit go make series excursion point interest occasion accompany 
39,"The natural consequences followed. Charlie had, for years, been the hero of Ada's thoughts; while Katie had heard so frequently of Peters that she was, from the first, disposed to regard him in the most favourable light. Before the end of two months, both couples were engaged; and as both the young officers possessed ample means, and the ladies were heiresses, there was no obstacle to an early union.",natural consequence follow year hero thought hear first dispose regard favourable light end month couple engage young officer possess ample means lady heiress be obstacle early union 
40,"The weddings took place a month later; and Tim was, in the exuberance of his delight, hilariously drunk for the first and only time during his service with Charlie. Both gentlemen bought estates in the country, and later took their seats in Parliament, where they vigorously defended their former commander, Lord Clive, in the assaults which were made upon him.",wedding take place month exuberance delight drunk first only time service gentleman buy estate country take seat defend former commander assault make 
41,"Tim married, seven or eight years after his master, and settled down in a nice little house upon the estate. Although, henceforth, he did no work whatever; he insisted, to the end of his life, that he was still in Colonel Marryat's service.",marry year master settle nice little house estate do work insist end life service 
42,"Hossein, to the great amusement of his master and mistress, followed Tim's example. The pretty cook of Charlie's establishment made no objection to his swarthy hue. Charlie built a snug cottage for them, close to the house, where they took up their residence; but Hossein, though the happy father of a large family, continued, to the end of a long life, to discharge the duties of valet to his master.",great amusement master mistress follow example pretty cook establishment make objection swarthy hue build snug cottage close house take residence happy father large family continue end long life discharge duty valet master 
43,"Both he and Tim were immense favourites with the children of Charlie and Peters, who were never tired of listening to their tales of the exploits of their fathers, when with Clive in India. ",immense favourite child tired listen tale exploit father
