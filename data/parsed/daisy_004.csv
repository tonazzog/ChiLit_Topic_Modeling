26,"“Oh, my frock! my frock!

28,"“I shall wait for her,” said Norman. “Go on, Flora, we shall catch you up in no time;” and, as Flora went, he continued, “Never mind your aims and fames and trumpery English rhymes. Your verses will be much the best, Ethel; I only went on a little about Mount Vesuvius and the landscape, as Alan described it the other day, and Decius taking a last look, knowing he was to die. I made him beg his horse’s pardon, and say how they will both be remembered, and their self-devotion would inspire Romans to all posterity, and shout with a noble voice!” said Norman, repeating some of his lines, correcting them as he proceeded.",wait say go catch time go continue mind aim fame trumpery english rhyme verse good go little landscape describe other day take last look know die make beg horse pardon say remember self devotion inspire posterity shout noble voice say repeat line correct proceed

30,"“Yes, you have made a capital beginning. If you won’t break down somewhere, as you always do, with some frightful false quantity, that you would get an imposition for, if you were a boy.

33,"“Oh, no, no,” said Ethel. “Fame is coarse and vulgar--blinder than ever they draw Love or Fortune--she is only a personified newspaper, trumpeting out all that is extraordinary, without minding whether it is good or bad. She misses the delicate and lovely--I wished they would give us a theme to write about her. I should like to abuse her well.”",say coarse vulgar blinder draw personify newspaper trumpet extraordinary mind good bad misse delicate lovely wish give theme write like abuse 
34,"“It would make a very good theme, in a new line,” said Norman; “but I don’t give into it, altogether. It is the hope and the thought of fame, that has made men great, from first to last. It is in every one that is not good for nothing, and always will be! The moving spirit of man’s greatness!”",make good theme new line say give hope thought fame make man great first last one good move spirit man greatness

38,"“But!” said Norman, and both were silent for some short interval, as they left the last buildings of the town, and began to mount a steep hill. Presently Norman slackened his pace, and driving his stick vehemently against a stone, exclaimed, “It is no use talking, Ethel, it is all a fight and a race. One is always to try to be foremost. That’s the spirit of the thing--that’s what the great, from first to last, have struggled, and fought, and lived, and died for.”",say silent short interval leave last building town begin mount steep hill slacken pace drive stick stone exclaim use talk fight race try foremost spirit thing great first last struggle fight live die 
39,"“I know it is a battle, I know it is a race. The Bible says so,” replied Ethel; “but is not there the difference, that here all may win--not only one? One may do one’s best, not care whether one is first or last. That’s what our reading to-day said.”",know battle know race say reply difference win do good care first last reading day say

41,"“Of course! That they do. I say, Norman, didn’t you mean Harvey Anderson?”",course say mean 
42,"Instead of answering, Norman exclaimed, “It is pretension that is hateful--true excelling is what one’s life is for. No, no, I’ll never be beat, Ethel--I never have been beat by any one, except by you, when you take pains,” he added, looking exultingly at his sister, “and I never will be.”",answer exclaim pretension hateful true excelling life beat beat one take pain add look sister

That examination paper he broke down in--I could have done it as easily as possible.”",excellent fellow else say wish more slow imagine examination paper break do possible

50,"“And I believe I had better not be there with Richard,” added Norman. “I don’t like coming into contrast with him, and I don’t think he can like it, poor fellow, and it isn’t his fault. I had rather stay another year here, get one of the open scholarships, and leave the Stoneborough ones for those who can do no better.”",believe add like come contrast think like poor fellow fault stay year get open scholarship leave one do good 
51,"In justice to Norman, we must observe that this was by no means said as a boast. He would scarcely have thus spoken to any one but Etheldred, to whom, as well as to himself, it seemed mere matter-of-fact. The others had in the meantime halted at the top of the hill, and were looking back at the town--the great old Minster, raising its twin towers and long roof, close to the river, where rich green meadows spread over the valley, and the town rising irregularly on the slope above, plentifully interspersed with trees and gardens, and one green space on the banks of the river, speckled over with a flock of little black dots in rapid motion.",justice observe means say boast speak one seem mere matter fact other have meantime halt top hill look town great old raise twin tower long roof close river rich green meadow spread valley town rise slope intersperse tree garden green space bank river speckle flock little black dot rapid motion

54,"“Ethel!” said Norman, “how is any one to understand you? The argument is this: Ethel wants people to do great deeds, and be utterly careless of the fame of them; I say, that love of glory is a mighty spring.”",say one understand argument want person do great deed careless fame say love glory mighty spring

65,"There they were cut short. There was a plantation to be crossed, with a gate that would not open, and that seemed an effectual barrier against both Miss Winter and the donkey, until by persuasive eloquence and great gallantry, Mr. Ernescliffe performed the wonderful feat of getting the former over the tall fence, while Norman conducted the donkey a long way round, undertaking to meet them at the other side of the plantation.",cut short be plantation cross gate open seem effectual barrier donkey persuasive eloquence great gallantry perform wonderful feat get former tall fence conduct donkey long way undertake meet other side plantation 
66,"The talk became desultory, as they proceeded for at least a mile along a cart-track through soft-tufted grass and heath and young fir-trees. It ended in a broad open moor, stony; and full of damp boggy hollows, forlorn and desolate under the autumn sky. Here they met Norman again, and walked on along a very rough and dirty road, the ground growing more decidedly into hills and valleys as they advanced, till they found themselves before a small, but very steep hillock, one side of which was cut away into a slate quarry. Round this stood a colony of roughly-built huts, of mud, turf, or large blocks of the slate. Many workmen were engaged in splitting up the slates, or loading wagons with them, rude wild-looking men, at the sight of whom the ladies shrank up to their protectors, but who seemed too busy even to spare time for staring at them.",talk become desultory proceed least mile cart track soft tuft grass heath young fir tree end broad open moor stony full damp boggy hollow forlorn desolate autumn sky meet walk rough dirty road ground grow hill valley advance find small steep hillock side cut slate quarry stand colony build hut mud turf large block slate many workmen engage split slate loading wagon rude wild look man sight lady shrank protector seem busy spare time stare

68,"Inside they found more cleanliness and neatness than they had expected, but there was a sad appearance of poverty, insufficient furniture, and the cups and broken tea-pot on the table, holding nothing but toast and water, as a substitute for their proper contents. The poor woman was sitting by the fire with one twin on her lap, and the other on a chair by her side, and a larger child was in the corner by the fire, looking heavy and ill, while others of different ages lounged about listlessly. She was not untidy, but very pale, and she spoke in a meek, subdued way, as if the ills of life were so heavy on her that she had no spirit even to complain. She thanked them for their gifts but languidly, and did not visibly brighten when told that her husband was better.",find more cleanliness neatness expect be sad appearance poverty insufficient furniture cup break tea pot table hold toast water substitute proper content poor woman sit fire twin lap other chair side large child corner fire look heavy ill other different age lounge untidy pale speak meek subdued way ill life heavy have spirit complain thank gift bright tell husband good

75,"No one could deny it, and the party left the cottage gravely. Alan and Norman joined them, having heard a grievous history of the lawlessness of the people from a foreman with whom they had met. There seemed to be no visible means of improvement. The parish church was Stoneborough, and there the living was very poor, the tithes having been appropriated to the old Monastery, and since its dissolution having fallen into possession of a Body that never did anything for the town. The incumbent, Mr. Ramsden, had small means, and was not a high stamp of clergyman, seldom exerting himself, and leaving most of his parish work to the two under masters of the school, Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Harrison, who did all they had time and strength for, and more too, within the town itself. There was no hope for Cocksmoor!",deny party leave cottage join hear grievous history lawlessness person foreman meet seem be visible means improvement parish church living poor tithe appropriate old dissolution fall possession body do town incumbent have small means high stamp clergyman exert leave most parish work master school do have time strength town be hope

82,"“I may safely do so,” he answered, smiling. Miss Winter looked at Etheldred reprovingly, and she shrank into herself, drew apart, and indulged in a reverie. She had heard in books of girls writing poetry, romance, history--gaining fifties and hundreds. Could not some of the myriads of fancies floating in her mind thus be made available? She would compose, publish, earn money--some day call papa, show him her hoard, beg him to take it, and, never owning whence it came, raise the building. Spire and chancel, pinnacle and buttress, rose before her eyes, and she and Norman were standing in the porch with an orderly, religious population, blessing the unknown benefactor, who had caused the news of salvation to be heard among them.",do answer smile look shrank draw indulge reverie hear book girl write poetry romance history gain fifties hundred myriad fancy float mind make available compose publish earn money day call papa show hoard beg take own come raise building spire chancel pinnacle buttress rise eye stand porch orderly religious population bless unknown benefactor cause news salvation hear

85,"He was gone in an instant, and they obeyed in silence. Whence came Ethel’s certainty that the accident concerned themselves? In an agony of apprehension, though without one outward sign of it, she walked home. They were in the garden--all was apparently as usual, but no one was in sight. Ethel had been first, but she held back, and let Miss Winter go forward into the house. The front door was open--servants were standing about in confusion, and one of the maids, looking dreadfully frightened, gave a cry, “Oh!

94,"“Oh, Norman, Norman, speak! What is it?” He groaned, but could not speak; he rested his head against her, and gasped. She was terribly frightened. “I’ll call--” and she would have gone, but he held her. “No--no--they can’t!” He was prevented from saying more, by chattering teeth and deadly faintness. She tried to support him, but could only guide him as he sank, till he lay at full length on the floor, where she put a pillow under his head, and gave him some water. “Is it--oh, tell me!

Some minutes passed in silence, Norman lying still, excepting a nervous trembling that agitated his whole frame.

Harry had gone back to his refuge in the nursery, and Ethel returned to Norman. There they remained for a long time, both unwilling to speak or stir, or even to observe to each other on the noises that came in to them, as their door was left ajar, though in those sounds they were so absorbed, that they did not notice the cold of a frosty October evening, or the darkness that closed in on them.",relief shrank have behold hasten busy useful have time think go refuge nursery return remain long time unwilling speak stir observe other noise come door leave ajar sound absorb notice cold frosty evening darkness close 
138,"They heard the poor babe crying, one of the children going down to call nurse, and nurse coming up; then Harry, at the door of the room where the boys slept, calling Norman in a low voice. Norman, now nearly recovered, went and brought him into his sister’s room, and his tidings were, that their father’s arm had been broken in two places, and the elbow frightfully injured, having been crushed and twisted by the wheel. He was also a good deal bruised, and though Mr. Ward trusted there was no positive harm to the head, he was in an unconscious state, from which the severe pain of the operation had only roused him, so far as to evince a few signs of suffering. Margaret was still insensible.",hear poor babe cry child go call nurse nurse come door room boy sleep call low voice recover go bring sister room tiding father arm break place elbow injure crush twist wheel good deal bruise trust be positive harm head unconscious state severe pain operation rouse evince few sign suffering insensible 
139,"The piteous sound of the baby’s wailing almost broke their hearts. Norman walked about the room in the dark, and said he should go down, he could not bear it; but he could not make up his mind to go, and after about a quarter of an hour, to their great relief, it ceased.",piteous sound baby wail break heart walk room dark say go bear make mind go quarter hour great relief cease 
140,"Next Mary opened the door, saying, “Norman, here’s Mr. Wilmot come to ask if he can do anything--Miss Winter sent word that you had better go to him.”",open door say come ask do send word good go 
141,“How is baby?” asked Harry.,baby ask

147,"“No, thank you, I had rather be in the dark. Come up as soon as you have seen him,” said Etheldred.",thank dark come see say 
148,"Norman went slowly down, with failing knees, hardly able to conquer the shudder that came over him, as he passed those rooms. There were voices in the drawing-room, and he found a sort of council there, Alan Ernescliffe, the surgeon, and Mr. Wilmot. They turned as he came in, and Mr. Wilmot held out his hand with a look of affection and kindness that went to his heart, making room for him on the sofa, while going on with what he was saying. “Then you think it would be better for me not to sit up with him.”",go fail knee able conquer shudder come pass room be voice draw room find sort council surgeon turn come hold hand look affection kindness go heart make room sofa go say think good sit 
149,"“I should decidedly say so,” replied Mr. Ward. “He has recognised Mr. Ernescliffe, and any change might excite him, and lead him to ask questions. The moment of his full consciousness is especially to be dreaded.”",say reply recognise change excite lead ask question moment full consciousness dread 
150,“But you do not call him insensible?”,call insensible 
151,"“No, but he seems stunned--stupified by the shock, and by pain. He spoke to Miss Flora when she brought him some tea.”",seem stunn stupify shock pain speak bring tea 
152,"“And admirably she managed,” said Alan Ernescliffe. “I was much afraid of some answer that would rouse him, but she kept her self-possession beautifully, and seemed to compose him in a moment.”",manage say afraid answer rouse keep self possession seem compose moment 
153,"“She is valuable indeed--so much judgment and activity,” said Mr. Ward. “I don’t know what we should have done without her. But we ought to have Mr. Richard--has no one sent to him?”",valuable much judgment activity say know do have send 
154,Alan Ernescliffe and Norman looked at each other.,look other 
155,"“Is he at Oxford, or at his tutor’s?” asked Mr. Wilmot.",tutor ask

158,"Poor Norman! he knew he was the one who ought to write, but his icy trembling hand seemed to shake more helplessly than ever, and a piteous glance fell upon Mr. Wilmot.",poor know one write icy tremble hand seem shake piteous glance fall 
159,"“The best plan would be,” said Mr. Wilmot, “for me to go to him at once and bring him home. If I go by the mail-train, I shall get to him sooner than a letter could.”",good plan say go bring go mail train get letter 
160,"“And it will be better for him,” said Mr. Ward. “He will feel it dreadfully, poor boy. But we shall all do better when we have him. You can get back to-morrow evening.”",good say feel poor boy do good have get evening 
161,"“Sunday,” said Mr. Wilmot, “I believe there is a train at four.”",say believe be train

164,"“How fortunate that that youth is here,” said Mr. Wilmot--“he seems to be quite taking Richard’s place.”",fortunate youth say seem take place 
165,"“And to feel it as much,” said Mr. Ward. “He has been invaluable with his sailor’s resources and handiness.”",feel much say invaluable sailor resource handiness 
166,"“Well, what shall I tell poor Richard?” asked Mr. Wilmot.",tell poor ask 
167,"“Tell him there is no reason his father should not do very well, if we can keep him from agitation--but there’s the point. He is of so excitable a constitution, that his faculties being so far confused is the best thing, perhaps, that could be. Mr. Ernescliffe manages him very well--used to illness on that African coast, and the doctor is very fond of him. As to Miss May, one can’t tell what to say about her yet--there’s no fracture, at least--it must be a work of time to judge.”",tell be reason father do keep agitation be point excitable constitution faculty confuse good thing manage use illness african coast doctor fond tell say be fracture least work time judge 
168,"Flora at that moment half-opened the door, and called Mr. Ward, stopping for a moment to say it was for nothing of any consequence. Mr. Wilmot and Norman were left together. Norman put his hands over his face and groaned--his master looked at him with kind anxiety, but did not feel as if it were yet time to speak of consolation.",moment half open door call stop moment say consequence leave put hand face groan master look kind anxiety feel time speak consolation 
169,"“God bless and support you, and turn this to your good, my dear boy,”  said he affectionately, as he pressed his hand; “I hope to bring your brother to-morrow.”",bless support turn good dear boy say press hand hope bring brother 
170,"“Thank you, sir,” was all Norman could say; and as Mr. Wilmot went out by the front door, he slowly went up again, and, lingering on the landing-place, was met by Mr. Ward, who told him to his relief--for the mere thinking of it renewed the faint sensation--that he had better not go to his father’s room.",thank say go front door go linger landing place meet tell relief mere thinking renew faint sensation go father room 
171,"There was nothing to be done but to return to Ethel and Harry, and tell them all; with some humiliation at being helpless, where Flora was doing so much, and to leave their father to be watched by a stranger. If he had been wanted, Norman might have made the effort, but being told that he would be worse than useless, there was nothing for him but to give way.",be do return tell humiliation helpless do leave father watch stranger want make effort tell bad useless be give way 
172,"They sat together in Ethel’s room till somewhere between eight and nine o’clock, when good old nurse, having put her younger ones to bed, came in search of them. “Dear, dear! poor darlings,” said she, as she found them sitting in the dark; she felt their cold hands, and made them all come into the nursery, where Mary was already, and, fondling them, one by one, as they passively obeyed her, she set them down on their little old stools round the fire, took away the high fender, and gave them each a cup of tea. Harry and Mary ate enough to satisfy her, from a weary craving feeling, and for want of employment; Norman sat with his elbow on his knee, and a very aching head resting on his hand, glad of drink, but unable to eat; Ethel could be persuaded to do neither, till she found old nurse would let her have no peace.",sit room o'clock good old nurse put young one bed come search dear dear poor darling say find sit dark feel cold hand make come nursery fondle obey set little old stool fire take high fender give cup tea eat satisfy weary craving feeling want employment sit elbow knee aching head rest hand glad drink unable eat persuade do find old nurse let have peace 
173,"The nurse sent them all to bed, taking the two girls to their own room, undressing them, and never leaving them until Mary was in a fair way of crying herself to sleep--for saying her prayers had brought the tears; while Ethel lay so wide awake that it was of no use to wait for her, and then she went to the boys, tucked them each in, as when they were little children, and saying, “Bless your dear hearts!” bestowed on each of them a kiss which came gratefully to Norman’s burning brow, and which even Harry’s boyish manliness could not resist.",nurse send bed take girl own room undress leave fair way cry sleep say prayer bring tear lay use wait go boy tuck little child say bless dear heart bestow kiss come burning brow boyish manliness resist
