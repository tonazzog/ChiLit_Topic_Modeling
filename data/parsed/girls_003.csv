1,CHAPTER 3. AT LAVENDER HOUSE.,chapter 
2,"Hester's journey had really proved wonderfully agreeable.  She had taken a great fancy to the little old ladies who had fussed over her and made themselves pleasant in her behalf.  She felt herself something like a heroine as she poured out a little, just a little, of her troubles into their sympathising ears; and their cheerful remarks with regard to school and school-life had caused her to see clearly that there might be another and a brighter side to the gloomy picture she had drawn with regard to her future.",journey prove agreeable take great fancy little old lady fuss make pleasant behalf feel heroine pour little little trouble sympathise ear cheerful remark regard school school life cause see be bright side gloomy picture draw regard future 
3,"But during the drive of two and a half miles from Sefton to Lavender House, Hester once more began to feel anxious and troubled.  The Misses Bruce had gone off with some other passengers in a little omnibus to their small villa in the town, but Lavender House was some distance off, and the little omnibus never went so far.",drive half mile begin feel anxious troubled go other passenger little omnibus small villa town distance little omnibus go 
4,"An old-fashioned carriage, which the ladies told Hester belonged to Mrs Willis, had been sent to meet her, and a man whom the Misses Bruce addressed as ""Thomas"" helped to place her trunk and a small portmanteau on the roof of the vehicle.  The little girl had to take her drive alone, and the rather ancient horse which drew the old carriage climbed up and down the steep roads in a most leisurely fashion.  It was a cold winter's day, and by the time Thomas had executed some commissions in Sefton, and had reached the gates of the avenue which led to Lavender House, it was very nearly dark.  Hester trembled at the darkness, and when the gates were shut behind them by a rosy-faced urchin of ten, she once more began to feel the cruel and desolate idea that she was going to prison.",old fashioned carriage lady tell belong send meet man address help place trunk small portmanteau roof vehicle little girl have take drive ancient horse draw old carriage climb steep road leisurely fashion cold winter day time execute commission reach gate avenue lead dark tremble darkness gate shut rosy face urchin begin feel cruel desolate idea go prison 
5,"They drove slowly down a long and winding avenue, and, although Hester could not see, she knew they must be passing under trees, for several times their branches made a noise against the roof of the carriage.  At last they came to a standstill.  The old servant scrambled slowly down from his seat on the box, and, opening the carriage-door, held out his hand to help the little stranger to alight.",drive long wind avenue see know pass tree several time branch make noise roof carriage last come standstill old servant scramble seat box open carriage door hold hand help little stranger aligh 
6,"""Come now, missy,"" he said in cheering tones, ""come out, and you'll be warm and snug in a minute.  Dear, dear!  I expect you're nearly froze up, poor little miss, and it _is_ a most bitter cold night.""",come say cheer tone come warm snug minute dear dear expect frize poor little miss bitter cold night 
7,"He rang a bell which hung by the entrance of a deep porch, and the next moment the wide hall door was flung open by a neat maid-servant, and Hester stepped within.",ring bell hang entrance deep porch next moment wide hall door flung open neat maid servant step 
8,"""She's come,"" exclaimed several voices in different keys, and proceeding apparently from different quarters.  Hester looked around her in a half-startled way, but she could see no one, except the maid, who smiled at her and said--",come exclaim several voice different key proceeding different quarter look half startle way see maid smile say 
9,"""Welcome to Lavender House, miss.  If you'll step into the porter's room for one moment, there is a good fire there, and I'll acquaint Miss Danesbury that you have arrived.""",miss step porter room moment be good fire acquaint arrive 
10,"The little room in question was at the right-hand side of a very wide and cheerful hall, which was decorated in pale tints of green, and had a handsome encaustic-tiled floor.  A blazing fire and two lamps made the hall look cheerful, but Hester was very glad to take refuge from the unknown voices in the porter's small room.  She found herself quite trembling with shyness, and cold, and an indescribable longing to get back to Nan; and as she waited for Miss Danesbury and wondered fearfully who or what Miss Danesbury was, she scarcely derived any comfort from the blazing fire near which she stood.",little room question right hand side wide cheerful hall decorate pale tint green have handsome encaustic tile floor blaze fire lamp make hall look cheerful glad take refuge unknown voice porter small room find tremble shyness cold indescribable longing get wait wonder derive comfort blaze fire stand 
11,"""Rather tall for her age, but I fear, I greatly fear, a little sulky,"" said a voice behind her; and when she turned round in an agony of trepidation and terror, she suddenly found herself face to face with a tall, kind-looking, middle-aged lad and also with a bright gipsy-looking girl.",tall age fear fear little sulky say voice turn agony trepidation terror find face face tall kind look middle aged lad bright gipsy look girl 
12,"""Annie Forest, how very naughty of you to hide behind the door!  You are guilty of disobedience in coming into the room without leave.  I must report you, my dear; yes, I really must.  You lose two good conduct marks for this, and will probably have thirty lines in addition to your usual quantity of French poetry.""",naughty hide door guilty disobedience come room leave report dear lose good conduct mark have line addition usual quantity french poetry 
13,"""But she won't tell on me, she won't, dear old Danesbury,"" said the girl; ""she couldn't be so hard-hearted, the precious love, particularly as curiosity happens to be one of her own special little virtues!  Take a kiss, Danesbury, and now, a you love me you'll be merciful!""  The girl flitted away, and Miss Danesbury turned to Hester, whose face had changed from red to pale during this little scene.",tell dear old say girl hard hearted precious love curiosity happen own special little virtue take kiss love merciful girl flite turn face change red pale little scene 
14,"""What a horrid, vulgar, low-bred girl!"" she exclaimed with passion, for in all the experiences of her short life Hester had never even imagined that personal remarks could be made of any one in their very presence. ""I hope she'll get a lot of punishment--I hope you are not going to forgive her,"" she continued, for her anger had for the time quite overcome her shyness.",horrid vulgar low breed girl exclaim passion experience short life imagine personal remark make one very presence hope get lot punishment hope go forgive continue anger have time overcome shyness 
15,"""Oh, my dear, my dear! we should all be forgiving,"" exclaimed Miss Danesbury in her gentle voice.  ""Welcome to Lavender House, love; I am sorry I was not in the hall to receive you.  Had I been, this little _rencontre_ would not have occurred.  Annie Forest meant no harm, however--she's a wild little sprite, but affectionate.  You and she will be the best friends possible by-and-by.  Now, let me take you to your room; the gong for tea will sound in exactly five minutes, and I am sure you will be glad of something to eat.""",dear dear forgiving exclaim gentle voice love sorry hall receive little _rencontre_ occur mean harm wild little sprite affectionate good friend possible let take room gong tea sound minute sure glad eat 
16,"Miss Danesbury then led Hester across the hall and up some broad, low, thickly-carpeted stairs.  When they had ascended two flights, and were standing on a handsome landing, she paused.",lead hall broad low carpet stair ascend flight stand handsome landing pause 
17,"""Do you see this baize door, dear?"" she said.  ""This is the entrance to the school part of the house.  This part that we are now in belongs exclusively to Mrs Willis, and the girls are never allowed to come here without leave.  All the school-life is lived at the other side of this baize door, and a very happy life I assure you it is for those little girls who make up their minds to be brave and good.  Now kiss me, my dear, and let me bid you welcome once again to Lavender House.""",see baize door dear say entrance school part house part belong girl allow come leave school life live other side baize door happy life assure little girl make mind brave good kiss dear let bid 
18,"""Are you our principal teacher, then?"" asked Hester.",principal teacher ask 
19,"""I? oh dear, no, my love.  I teach the younger children English, and I look after the interests and comforts of all.  I am a very useful sort of person, I believe, and I have a motherly heart, dear, and it is a way with little girls to come to me when they are in trouble.  Now, my love, we must not chatter any longer.  Take my hand, and let us get to your room as fast as possible.""",love teach young child look interest comfort useful sort person believe have motherly heart dear way little girl come trouble love chatter take hand let get room possible 
20,"Miss Danesbury pushed open the baize door, and instantly Hester found herself in a different region.  Mrs Willis's part of the house gave the impression of warmth, luxuriance, and even elegance of arrangement.  At the other side of the door were long, narrow corridors, with snow-white, but carpetless floors, and rather cold, distempered walls.  Miss Danesbury, holding the new pupil's hand, led her down two corridors, and past a great number of shut doors, behind which Hester could near suppressed laughter and eager, chattering voices.  At last, however, they stopped at a door which had the number ""32"" written over it.",push open baize door find different region part house give impression warmth luxuriance elegance arrangement other side door long narrow corridor snow white carpetless floor cold distemper wall hold new pupil hand lead corridor great number shut door near suppress laughter eager chatter voice last stop door have number write 
21,"""This is your bedroom, dear,"" said the English teacher, ""and to-night you will not be sorry to have it alone.  Mrs Willis received a telegram from Susan Drummond, your room-mate, this afternoon, and she will not arrive until to-morrow.""",bedroom dear say english teacher night sorry have receive telegram room mate afternoon arrive 
22,"However bare and even cold the corridors looked, the bedroom into which Hester was ushered by no means corresponded with this appearance.  It was a small, but daintily-furnished little room.  The floor was carpeted with green felt, the one window was hung with pretty draperies, and two little, narrow, white beds were arranged gracefully with French canopies.  All the furniture in the room was of a minute description, but good of its kind.  Beside each bed stood a mahogany chest of drawers.  At two corresponding corners were marble washhand-stands, and even two pretty, toilet tables stood side by side in the recess of the window.  But the sight that perhaps pleased Hester most was a small bright fire which burnt in the grate.",bare cold corridor look bedroom usher means correspond appearance small furnish little room floor carpet green feel window hang pretty drapery little narrow white bed arrange french canopy furniture room minute description good kind bed stand mahogany chest drawer corresponding corner marble washhand stand pretty toilet table stand side side recess window sight pleased most small bright fire burn grate 
23,"""Now, dear, this is your room.  As you have arrived first you can choose your own bed and your own chest of drawers.  Ah, that is right, Ellen has unfastened your portmanteau; she will unpack your trunk to-night, and take it to the box-room.  Now, dear, smooth your hair and wash your hands.  The gong will sound instantly.  I will come for you when it does.""",dear room arrive choose own bed own chest drawer right unfasten portmanteau unpack trunk night take box room dear smooth hair wash hand gong sound come
