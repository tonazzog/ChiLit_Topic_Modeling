2," THE reconciliation made Ebbo retract his hasty resolution of relinquishing all the benefits resulting from his connection with the Sorel family, and his mother’s fortune made it possible to carry out many changes that rendered the castle and its inmates far more prosperous in appearance than had ever been the case before.  Christina had once again the appliances of a _wirthschaft_, such as she felt to be the suitable and becoming appurtenance of a right-minded Frau, gentle or simple, and she felt so much the happier and more respectable.",reconciliation make retract hasty resolution relinquish benefit result connection family mother fortune make possible carry many change render castle inmate prosperous appearance case have appliance _wirthschaft_ such feel suitable become appurtenance right minded gentle simple feel happy respectable 
3,"A chaplain had also been secured.  The youths had insisted on his being capable of assisting their studies, and, a good man had been found who was fearfully learned, having studied at all possible universities, but then failing as a teacher, because he was so dreamy and absent as to be incapable of keeping the unruly students in order.  Jobst Schön was his proper name, but he was translated into Jodocus Pulcher.  The chapel was duly adorned, the hall and other chambers were fitted up with some degree of comfort; the castle court was cleansed, the cattle sheds removed to the rear, and the serfs were presented with seed, and offered payment in coin if they would give their labour in fencing and clearing the cornfield and vineyard which the barons were bent on forming on the sunny slope of the ravine.  Poverty was over, thanks to the marriage portion, and yet Ebbo looked less happy than in the days when there was but a bare subsistence; and he seemed to miss the full tide of city life more than did his brother, who, though he had enjoyed Ulm more heartily at the time, seemed to have returned to all his mountain delights with greater zest than ever.  At his favourite tarn, he revelled in the vast stillness with the greater awe for having heard the hum of men, and his minstrel dreams had derived fresh vigour from contact with the active world.  But, as usual, he was his brother’s chief stay in the vexations of a reformer. The serfs had much rather their lord had turned out a freebooter than an improver.  Why should they sow new seeds, when the old had sufficed their fathers?  Work, beyond the regulated days when they scratched up the soil of his old enclosure, was abhorrent to them.  As to his offered coin, they needed nothing it would buy, and had rather bask in the sun or sleep in the smoke.  A vineyard had never been heard of on Adlerstein mountain: it was clean contrary to his forefathers’ habits; and all came of the bad drop of restless burgher blood, that could not let honest folk rest.",chaplain secure youth insist capable assist study good man find learn study possible university fail teacher dreamy absent incapable keep unruly student order proper name translate chapel adorn hall other chamber fit degree comfort castle court cleanse cattle shed remove rear serf present seed offer payment coin give labour fencing clear cornfield vineyard baron bend form sunny slope ravine poverty thanks marriage portion look happy day be bare subsistence seem miss full tide city life more do brother enjoy time seem return mountain delight great zest favourite tarn revell vast stillness great awe hear hum man minstrel dream derive fresh vigour contact active world usual brother chief stay vexation reformer serf have much lord turn freebooter improver sow new seed old suffice father work regulate day scratch soil old enclosure abhorrent offer coin need buy have bask sun sleep smoke vineyard hear mountain clean contrary forefather habit come bad drop restless burgher blood let honest folk rest 
4,"Ebbo stormed, not merely with words, but blows, became ashamed of his violence, tried to atone for it by gifts and kind words, and in return was sulkily told that he would bring more good to the village by rolling the fiery wheel straight down hill at the wake, than by all his new-fangled ways.  Had not Koppel and a few younger men been more open to influence, his agricultural schemes could hardly have begun; but Friedel’s persuasions were not absolutely without success, and every rood that was dug was achieved by his patience and perseverance.",storm word blow become ashamed violence try atone gift kind word return tell bring good village roll fiery wheel hill wake new fangled way few young man open influence agricultural scheme begin persuasion success rood dig achieve patience perseverance 
5,"Next came home the Graf von Schlangenwald.  He had of late inhabited his castle in Styria, but in a fierce quarrel with some of his neighbours he had lost his eldest son, and the pacification enforced by the King of the Romans had so galled and infuriated him that he had deserted that part of the country and returned to Swabia more fierce and bitter than ever. Thenceforth began a petty border warfare such as had existed when Christina first knew Adlerstein, but had of late died out.  The shepherd lad came home weeping with wrath.  Three mounted Schlangenwaldern had driven off his four best sheep, and beaten himself with their halberds, though he was safe on Adlerstein ground.  Then a light thrown by a Schlangenwald reiter consumed all Jobst’s pile of wood.  The swine did not come home, and were found with spears sticking in them; the great broad-horned bull that Ebbo had brought from the pastures of Ulm vanished from the Alp below the Gemsbock’s Pass, and was known to be salted for winter use at Schlangenwald.",come home have late inhabit castle fierce quarrel neighbour lose old son pacification enforce gall infuriate desert part country return fierce bitter begin petty border warfare such exist know late die shepherd lad come weep wrath mount drive good sheep beat halberd safe ground light throw reiter consume pile wood swine come find spear stick great broad horned bull bring pasture vanish know salt winter use 
6,"Still Christina tried to persuade her sons that this might be only the retainers’ violence, and induced Ebbo to write a letter, complaining of the outrages, but not blaming the Count, only begging that his followers might be better restrained.  The letter was conveyed by a lay brother—no other messenger being safe.  Ebbo had protested from the first that it would be of no use, but he waited anxiously for the answer.",try persuade son retainer violence induce write letter complain outrage blame begg follower restrain letter convey lay brother other messenger safe protest first use wait answer

Your grandfather stole my cattle and     burnt my mills.  Then, in the war, he slew my brother Johann and     lamed for life my cousin Matthias.  Your father slew eight of my     retainers and spoiled my crops.  You yourself claim my land at the     ford, and secure the spoil which is justly mine.

15,"“We must appeal to the Markgraf of Wurtemburg,” said Friedel.",appeal say 
16,"It was the only measure in their power, though Ebbo winced at it; but his oaths were recent, and his conscience would not allow him to transgress them by doing himself justice.  Besides, neither party could take the castle of the other, and the only reprisals in his power would have been on the defenceless peasants of Schlangenwald.  He must therefore lay the whole matter before the Markgraf, who was the head of the Swabian League, and bound to redress his wrongs.  He made his arrangements without faltering, selecting the escort who were to accompany him, and insisting on leaving Friedel to guard his mother and the castle.  He would not for the world have admitted the suggestion that the counsel and introduction of Adlerstein Wildschloss would have been exceedingly useful to him.",only measure power wince oath recent conscience allow transgress do justice party take castle other only reprisal power defenceless peasant lay whole matter head swabian bind redress wrong make arrangement falter select escort accompany insist leave guard mother castle world admit suggestion counsel introduction useful 
17,"Poor Christina!  It was a great deal too like that former departure, and her heart was heavy within her!  Friedel was equally unhappy at letting his brother go without him, but it was quite necessary that he and the few armed men who remained should show themselves at all points open to the enemy in the course of the day, lest the Freiherr’s absence should be remarked.  He did his best to cheer his mother, by reminding her that Ebbo was not likely to be taken at unawares as their father had been; and he shared the prayers and chapel services, in which she poured out her anxiety.",poor great deal former departure heart heavy unhappy let brother go necessary few armed man remain show point open enemy course day absence remark do good cheer mother remind likely take unawares father share prayer chapel service pour anxiety 
18,"The blue banner came safe up the Pass again, but Wurtemburg had been formally civil to the young Freiherr; but he had laughed at the fend letter as a mere old-fashioned habit of Schangenwald’s that it was better not to notice, and he evidently regarded the stealing of a bull or the misusing of a serf as far too petty a matter for his attention.  It was as if a judge had been called by a crying child to settle a nursery quarrel.  He told Ebbo that, being a free Baron of the empire, he must keep his bounds respected; he was free to take and hang any spoiler he could catch, but his bulls were his own affair: the League was not for such gear.",blue banner come safe pass civil young laugh fend letter mere old fashioned habit good notice regard steal bull misusing serf petty matter attention judge call cry child settle nursery quarrel tell free empire keep bound respect free take hang spoiler catch bull own affair such gear 
19,"And a knight who had ridden out of Stuttgard with Ebbo had told him that it was no wonder that this had been his reception, for not only was Schlangenwald an old intimate of the Markgraf, but Swabia was claimed as a fief of Wurtemburg, so that Ebbo’s direct homage to the Emperor, without the interposition of the Markgraf, had made him no object of favour.",knight ride tell wonder reception old intimate claim fief direct homage interposition make object favour

30,"“That may never be,” said Ebbo, haughtily.  And, sure that he should receive the same advice, he decided against turning aside to consult his uncle at Ulm, and returned home in a mood that rejoiced Heinz and Hatto with hopes of the old days, while it filled his mother with dreary dismay and apprehension.",say sure receive same advice decide turn consult uncle return mood rejoice hope old day fill mother dreary dismay apprehension

32,"The “next time” was when the first winter cold was setting in.  A party of reitern came to harry an outlying field, where Ulrich had raised a scanty crop of rye.  Tidings reached the castle in such good time that the two brothers, with Heinz, the two Ulm grooms, Koppel, and a troop of serfs, fell on the marauders before they had effected much damage, and while some remained to trample out the fire, the rest pursued the enemy even to the village of Schlangenwald.",next time first winter cold set party reitern come harry outly field raise scanty crop rye tiding reach castle such good time brother groom troop serf fall marauder effect much damage remain trample fire rest pursue enemy village

39,"The serfs flung themselves before him in transports of gratitude, but he turned hastily away and strode up the mountain, his cheek glowing as he remembered, too late, that his defiance would be scoffed at, as a boy’s vaunt.  By and by he arrived at the hamlet, where he found a prisoner, a scowling, abject fellow, already well beaten, and now held by two serfs.",serf flung transport gratitude turn strode mountain cheek glow remember late defiance scoff boy vaunt arrive hamlet find prisoner scowl abject fellow beat hold serf

42,“Has he seen the priest?” asked Friedel.,see priest ask 
43,"The peasants looked as if this were one of Sir Friedel’s unaccountable fancies.  Ebbo paused, frowned, and muttered, but seeing a move as if to drag the wretch towards the stunted bush overhanging an abyss, he shouted, “Hold, Ulrich!  Little Hans, do thou run down to the castle, and bring Father Jodocus to do his office!”",peasant look unaccountable fancy pause frown mutter see move drag wretch stunt bush overhang abyss shout hold little run castle bring do office

Unless we hold the folk in some check there will be no right execution.  They will torture him to death ere the priest comes.”",muttering ensue purport catch make say escape disagreeableness scene have good tarry hand hold folk check be right execution torture death priest come 
50,"Ebbo yielded, and began to pace the scanty area of the flat rock where the need-fire was wont to blaze.  After a time he exclaimed: “Friedel, how couldst ask me?  Knowst not that it sickens me to see a mountain cat killed, save in full chase.  And thou—why, thou art white as the snow crags!”",yield begin pace scanty area flat rock need fire blaze time exclaim ask sicken see mountain cat kill save full chase art white snow crag

54,"“By heavens, when I forbade torture!” cried Ebbo, leaping from the rock in time to see the disgusting draught held to the lips of the captive, whose hands were twisted back and bound with cruel tightness; for the German boor, once roused from his lazy good-nature, was doubly savage from stolidity.",heaven forbid torture cry leap rock time see disgusting draught hold lip captive hand twist bind cruel tightness german boor rouse lazy good nature savage stolidity

58,"“What brought thee here?” continued Ebbo, in hopes of extracting some excuse for pardon; but the prisoner only hung his head as one stupefied, brutally indifferent and hardened against the mere trouble of answering. Not another word could be extracted, and Ebbo’s position was very uncomfortable, keeping guard over his condemned felon, with the sulky peasants herding round, in fear of being balked of their prey; and the reluctance growing on him every moment to taking life in cold blood. Right of life and death was a heavy burden to a youth under seventeen, unless he had been thoughtless and reckless, and from this Ebbo had been prevented by his peculiar life.  The lion cub had never tasted blood.",bring continue hope extract excuse pardon prisoner hang head stupefy indifferent harden mere trouble answer word extract position uncomfortable keep guard condemn felon sulky peasant herding fear balk prey reluctance grow moment take life cold blood right life death heavy burden youth thoughtless reckless prevent peculiar life lion cub taste blood

60,"Many a time had the brothers paced their platform of rock, the criminal had fallen into a dose, and women and boys were murmuring that they must call home their kine and goats, and it was a shame to debar them of the sight of the hanging, long before Hans came back between crying and stammering, to say that Father Jodocus had fallen into so deep a study over his book, that he only muttered “Coming,” then went into another musing fit, whence no one could rouse him to do more than say “Coming!

And whoso would follow him, let him do so at his peril!”",dare thunder flash eye rascal think hinder dare will fellow pass follow let do peril 
68,"The prisoner was prompt to gather himself up and rush like a hunted animal to the path, at the entrance of which stood both twins, with drawn swords, to defend the escape.  Of course no one ventured to follow; and surly discontented murmurs were the sole result as the peasants dispersed.  Ebbo, sheathing his sword, and putting his arm into his brother’s, said: “What, Friedel, turned stony-hearted?  Hadst never a word for the poor caitiff?”",prisoner prompt gather rush hunt animal path entrance stand twin draw sword defend escape course venture follow surly discontent murmur sole result peasant disperse sheath sword put arm brother say turn stony hearted word poor caitiff

71,"And even his mother’s satisfaction did not greatly comfort Ebbo, for he was of the age to feel more ashamed of a solecism than a crime. Christina perceived that this was one of his most critical periods of life, baited as he was by the enemy of his race, and feeling all the disadvantages which heart and conscience gave him in dealing with a man who had neither, at a time when public opinion was always with the most masterful.  The necessity of arming his retainers and having fighting men as a guard were additional temptations to hereditary habits of violence; and that so proud and fiery a nature as his should never become involved in them was almost beyond hope.  Even present danger seemed more around than ever before.  The estate was almost in a state of siege, and Christina never saw her sons quit the castle without thinking of their father’s fate, and passing into the chapel to entreat for their return unscathed in body or soul.  The snow, which she had so often hailed as a friend, was never more welcome than this winter; not merely as shutting the enemy out, and her sons in, but as cutting off all danger of a visit from her suitor, who would now come armed with his late sufferings in her behalf; and, moreover, with all the urgent need of a wise and respected head and protector for her sons.  Yet the more evident the expediency became, the greater grew her distaste.",mother satisfaction comfort age feel ashamed solecism crime perceive critical period life bait enemy race feel disadvantage heart conscience give deal man have time public opinion masterful necessity arme retainer have fight man guard additional temptation hereditary habit violence proud fiery nature become involve hope present danger seem estate state siege see son quit castle think father fate pass chapel entreat return unscathed body soul snow hail friend welcome winter shut enemy son cut danger visit suitor come armed late suffering behalf urgent need wise respect head protector son evident expediency become great grow distaste 
72,"Still the lonely life weighed heavily on Ebbo.  Light-hearted Friedel was ever busy and happy, were he chasing the grim winter game—the bear and wolf—with his brother, fencing in the hall, learning Greek with the chaplain, reading or singing to his mother, or carving graceful angel forms to adorn the chapel.  Or he could at all times soar into a minstrel dream of pure chivalrous semi-allegorical romance, sometimes told over the glowing embers to his mother and brother.  All that came to Friedel was joy, from battling with the bear on a frozen rock, to persuading rude little Hans to come to the Frau Freiherrinn to learn his Paternoster. But the elder twin might hunt, might fence, might smile or kindle at his brother’s lay, but ever with a restless gloom on him, a doubt of the future which made him impatient of the present, and led to a sharpness and hastiness of manner that broke forth in anger at slight offences.",lonely life weigh light hearted busy happy chase grim winter game bear wolf brother fencing hall learn chaplain read sing mother carve graceful angel form adorn chapel time soar minstrel dream pure chivalrous semi allegorical romance tell glow ember mother brother come joy battle bear freeze rock persuade rude little come learn elder twin hunt fence smile kindle brother lay restless gloom doubt future make impatient present lead sharpness hastiness manner break anger slight offence 
73,"“The matron’s coif succeeding the widow’s veil,” Friedel heard him muttering even in sleep, and more than once listened to it as Ebbo leant over the battlements—as he looked over the white world to the gray mist above the city of Ulm.",matron coif succeed widow veil hear mutter sleep more listen lean battlement look white world gray mist city

75,"“The answer is in mine own heart,” answered Ebbo.  “Since our stay at Ulm, I have ever felt as though the sweet motherling were less my own! And the same with my house and lands.  Rule as I will, a mocking laugh comes back to me, saying: ‘Thou art but a boy, Sir Baron, thou dost but play at lords and knights.’  If I had hung yon rogue of a reiter, I wonder if I had felt my grasp more real?”",answer own heart answer stay feel sweet motherling own same house land rule mocking laugh come say art boy play lord knight hang rogue reiter wonder feel grasp real
