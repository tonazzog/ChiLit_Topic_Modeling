3," As soon as the gate was opened, Paul went through mechanically with the others on to the platform, and waited at the bookstall while they changed the paper. He knew well enough that what had seemed at the time a stroke of supreme cunning would now only land him in fresh difficulties, if indeed it did not lead to the detection of his scheme. But he dared not interfere and prevent them from making the unlucky exchange. Something seemed to tie his tongue, and in sullen leaden apathy he resigned himself to whatever might be in store for him.",gate open go other platform wait bookstall change paper know seem time stroke supreme cunning land fresh difficulty lead detection scheme interfere prevent make unlucky exchange seem tie tongue sullen leaden apathy resign store 
4,"They passed out again by the booking-office. There was the old lady still at the pigeon-hole, trying to persuade the much-enduring clerk to restore a lucky sixpence she had given him by mistake, and was quite unable to describe. Mr. Bultitude would have given much just then to go up and shake her into hysterics, or curse her bitterly for the mischief she had done; but he refrained, either from an innate chivalry, or from a feeling that such an outburst would be ill-judged.",pass booking office be old lady pigeon hole try persuade much endure clerk restore lucky sixpence give mistake unable describe give much go shake hysterics curse mischief do refrain innate chivalry feeling outburst ill judge

22,"They drew a line on the path with their feet to mark Paul's starting point, and went on to the next lamp. After a moment or two of anxious waiting he heard Coggs shout, all in one breath, ""One-two-three-off!"" and the sound of scampering feet followed immediately.",draw line path foot mark starting point go next lamp moment anxious waiting hear shout breath sound scampering foot follow 
23,"It was a most exciting and hotly contested race. Paul saw them for one brief moment in the lamplight. He saw Chawner scudding down the path like some great camel, and Coker squaring his arms and working them as if they were wings. Coggs seemed to be last.",exciting contest race see brief moment lamplight see scudd path great camel squar arm work wing cogg seem last 
24,"He ran a little way himself just to encourage them, but, as the sound of their feet grew fainter and fainter, he felt that his last desperate ruse had taken effect, and with a chuckle at his own cleverness, turned round and ran his fastest in the opposite direction.

26,The next train was not until 7.25. A whole hour and twenty-five minutes to wait! What was he to do? Where was he to pass the weary time till then?

His absence could not remain long undiscovered and the station would be the first place they would search for him.,next train whole hour minute wait do pass weary time linger platform recapture absence remain undiscovered station first place search 
27,"And yet he dared not wander away from the neighbourhood of the station. If he kept to the shops and lighted thoroughfares he might be recognised or traced.

29,"He walked out upon the platform, and on past the refreshment and waiting rooms, past the weighing machine, the stacked trucks and the lamp-room, meeting and seen by none--even the boy at the bookstall was busy with bread and butter and a mug of tea in a dark corner, and never noticed him.",walk platform refreshment waiting room weighing machine stack truck lamp room meeting see boy bookstall busy bread butter mug tea dark corner notice 
30,"He went on to the end of the platform where the planks sloped gently down to a wilderness of sheds, coaling stages and sidings; he could just make out the bulky forms of some tarpaulined cattle-vans and open coal-trucks standing on the lines of metals which gleamed in the scanty gaslights.",go end platform plank slope wilderness shed coaling stage siding make bulky form tarpaulined cattle van open coal truck stand line metal gleam scanty gaslight

33,"He stepped in and lay down in one corner of it, listening anxiously for any sound of search, but hearing nothing more than the dismal dirge of the telegraph wires overhead; he soon grew cold and stiff, for his enforced attitude was far from comfortable, and there was more coal-dust in his chosen retreat than he could have wished. Still it was secluded enough; it was not likely that it would occur to anyone to look for him there. Ten days ago Mr. Paul Bultitude would have found it hard to conceive himself lying down in a hard and grimy coal-truck to escape his son's schoolmaster, but since then he had gone through too much that was unprecedented and abnormal to see much incongruity in his situation--it was all too hideously real to be a nightmare.",step lay corner listen sound search hear more dismal dirge telegraph wire grow cold stiff enforce attitude comfortable be more coal dust choose retreat wish secluded likely occur look day find hard conceive lie hard grimy coal truck escape son schoolmaster go much unprecedented abnormal see much incongruity situation real nightmare

113,"""Ah!"" said the other. ""Was he violent or insulting, then?""",say other violent insulting 
114,"""No, no! I can only describe his conduct as eccentric--what one might call reprehensibly eccentric and extravagant. I didn't call exactly in the way of business, but about a poor young fellow in my house, who is, I fear, rather far gone in consumption, and, knowing he was a Life Governor, y'know, I thought he might give me a letter for the hospital.

The clerk who showed me in said: 'You'll find him a good deal changed, if you knew him, sir. We're very uneasy about him here,' which prepared me for something out of the common. Well, I went into a sort of inner room, and there he was, in his shirt-sleeves, busy over some abomination he was cooking at the stove, with the office-boy helping him!

127,"The conversation fell back into a less personal channel again after this; they talked of ""risks,"" of some one who had only been ""writing"" a year and was doing seven thousand a week, of losses they had been ""on,"" and of the uselessness of ""writing five hundred on everything,"" and while at this point the train slackened and stopped--they had reached Dufferton.",conversation fall personal channel talk risk one write year do week loss uselessness write point train slacken stop reach 
128,"There was an opening of doors all along the train, and sounds of some inquiry and answer at each.

164,"Then they noticed the pitiable state Mr. Bultitude was in, and he had to give them a fair account of his escape and subsequent adventures, at which even their sympathy could not restrain delighted shouts of laughter--though Paul himself saw little enough in it all to laugh at; they asked his name, which he thought more prudent, for various reasons, to give as ""Jones,"" and other details, which I am afraid he invented as he went on, and altogether they reached Kentish Town in a state of high satisfaction with themselves and their protégé.",notice pitiable state have give fair account escape subsequent adventure sympathy restrain delight shout laughter see little laugh ask name think prudent various reason give other detail afraid invent go reach kentish state high satisfaction protégé
