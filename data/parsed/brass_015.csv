1,CHAPTER XV. BLUSHING HONOURS,blushing honoury 
2," It was rather late the next morning when Ventimore opened his eyes, to discover the Jinnee standing by the foot of his bed. ""Oh, it's _you_, is it?"" he said sleepily. ""How did you--a--get on last night?""",late next morning open eye discover stand foot bed say get last night 
3,"""I gained such information as I desired,"" said Fakrash, guardedly; ""and now, for the last time, I am come to ask thee whether thou wilt still persist in refusing to wed the illustrious Bedeea-el-Jemal? And have a care how thou answerest.""",gain such information desire say last time come ask persist refuse wed illustrious have care answerest 
4,"""So you haven't given up the idea?"" said Horace. ""Well, since you make such a point of it, I'll meet you as far as this. If you produce the lady, and she consents to marry me, I won't decline the honour. But there's one condition I really _must_ insist on.""",give idea say make point meet produce lady consent marry decline honour be condition insist 
5,"""It is not for thee to make stipulations. Still, yet this once I will hear thee.""",make stipulation hear 
6,"""I'm sure you'll see that it's only fair. Supposing, for any reason, you can't persuade the Princess to meet me within a reasonable time--shall we say a week?----""",sure see fair suppose reason persuade meet reasonable time say week 
7,"""Thou shalt be admitted to her presence within twenty-four hours,"" said the Jinnee.",admit presence hour say 
8,"""That's better still. Then, if I don't see her within twenty-four hours, I am to be at liberty to infer that the negotiations are off, and I may marry anybody else I please, without any opposition from you? Is that understood?""",good see hour liberty infer negotiation marry else opposition understand 
9,"""It is agreed,"" said Fakrash, ""for I am confident that Bedeea will accept thee joyfully.""",agree say confident accept 
10,"""We shall see,"" said Horace. ""But it might be as well if you went and prepared her a little. I suppose you know where to find her--and you've only twenty-four hours, you know.""",see say go prepare little suppose know find hour know 
11,"""More than is needed,"" answered the Jinnee, with such childlike confidence, that Horace felt almost ashamed of so easy a victory. ""But the sun is already high. Arise, my son, put on these robes""--and with this he flung on the bed the magnificent raiment which Ventimore had last worn on the night of his disastrous entertainment--""and when thou hast broken thy fast, prepare to accompany me.""",more need answer such childlike confidence feel ashamed easy victory sun high arise son put robe flung bed magnificent raiment wear night disastrous entertainment break prepare accompany 
12,"""Before I agree to that,"" said Horace, sitting up in bed, ""I should like to know where you're taking me to.""",agree say sit bed like know take 
13,"""Obey me without demur,"" said Fakrash, ""or thou knowest the consequences.""",obey demur say knowest consequence 
14,"It seemed to Horace that it was as well to humour him, and he got up accordingly, washed and shaved, and, putting on his dazzling robe of cloth-of-gold thickly sewn with gems, he joined Fakrash--who, by the way, was similarly, if less gorgeously, arrayed--in the sitting-room, in a state of some mystification.",seem humour get wash shave put dazzling robe cloth gold sew gem join way array sitting room state mystification 
15,"""Eat quickly,"" commanded the Jinnee, ""for the time is short."" And Horace, after hastily disposing of a cold poached egg and a cup of coffee, happened to go to the windows.",eat command time short dispose cold poach egg cup coffee happen go window 
16,"""Good Heavens!"" he cried. ""What does all this mean?""",good heavens cry mean 
17,"He might well ask. On the opposite side of the road, by the railings of the square, a large crowd had collected, all staring at the house in eager expectation. As they caught sight of him they raised a cheer, which caused him to retreat in confusion, but not before he had seen a great golden chariot with six magnificent coal-black horses, and a suite of swarthy attendants in barbaric liveries, standing by the pavement below. ""Whose carriage is that?"" he asked.",ask opposite side road railing square large crowd collect stare house eager expectation catch sight raise cheer cause retreat confusion see great golden chariot magnificent coal black horse suite swarthy attendant barbaric livery stand pavement carriage ask 
18,"""It belongs to thee,"" said the Jinnee; ""descend then, and make thy progress in it through the City.""",belong say descend make progress 
19,"""I will not,"" said Horace. ""Even to oblige you I simply can't drive along the streets in a thing like the band-chariot of a travelling circus.""",say oblige drive street thing band chariot travelling circus 
20,"""It is necessary,"" declared Fakrash. ""Must I again recall to thee the penalty of disobedience?""",necessary declare recall thee penalty disobedience 
21,"""Oh, very well,"" said Horace, irritably. ""If you insist on my making a fool of myself, I suppose I must. But where am I to drive, and why?""",say insist make fool suppose drive 
22,"""That,"" replied Fakrash, ""thou shalt discover at the fitting moment."" And so, amidst the shouts of the spectators, Ventimore climbed up into the strange-looking vehicle, while the Jinnee took his seat by his side. Horace had a parting glimpse of Mr. and Mrs. Rapkin's respective noses flattened against the basement window, and then two dusky slaves mounted to a seat at the back of the chariot, and the horses started off at a stately trot in the direction of Rochester Row.",reply discover fitting moment shout spectator climb strange look vehicle take seat side have part glimpse respective nose flateen basement window dusky slave mount seat back chariot horse start stately trot direction 
23,"""I think you might tell me what all this means,"" he said. ""You've no conception what an ass I feel, stuck up here like this!""",think tell mean say have conception ass feel stick 
24,"""Dismiss bashfulness from thee, since all this is designed to render thee more acceptable in the eyes of the Princess Bedeea,"" said the Jinnee.",dismiss bashfulness design render acceptable eye say 
25,"Horace said no more, though he could not but think that this parade would be thrown away.",say more think parade throw 
26,"But as they turned into Victoria Street and seemed to be heading straight for the Abbey, a horrible thought occurred to him. After all, his only authority for the marriage and decease of Bedeea was the ""Arabian Nights,"" which was not unimpeachable evidence. What if she were alive and waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom? No one but Fakrash would have conceived such an idea as marrying him to a Jinneeyeh in Westminster Abbey; but he was capable of any extravagance, and there were apparently no limits to his power.",turn seem head horrible thought occur only authority marriage decease arabian unimpeachable evidence alive wait arrival bridegroom conceive idea marry capable extravagance be limit power 
27,"""Mr. Fakrash,"" he said hoarsely, ""surely this isn't my--my wedding day? You're not going to have the ceremony _there_?""",say wedding day go have ceremony _there_ 
28,"""Nay,"" said the Jinnee, ""be not impatient. For this edifice would be totally unfitted for the celebration of such nuptials as thine.""",say impatient edifice unfitt celebration such nuptial 
29,"As he spoke, the chariot left the Abbey on the right and turned down the Embankment. The relief was so intense that Horace's spirits rose irrepressibly. It was absurd to suppose that even Fakrash could have arranged the ceremony in so short a time. He was merely being taken for a drive, and fortunately his best friends could not recognise him in his Oriental disguise. And it was a glorious morning, with a touch of frost in the air and a sky of streaky turquoise and pale golden clouds; the broad river glittered in the sunshine; the pavements were lined with admiring crowds, and the carriage rolled on amidst frantic enthusiasm, like some triumphal car.",speak chariot leave right turn relief intense spirit rise absurd suppose arrange ceremony short time take drive good friend recognise oriental disguise glorious morning touch frost air sky streaky turquoise pale golden cloud broad river glitter sunshine pavement line admire crowd carriage roll frantic enthusiasm triumphal car 
30,"""How they're cheering us!"" said Horace. ""Why, they couldn't make more row for the Lord Mayor himself.""",cheer say make more row 
31,"""What is this Lord Mayor of whom thou speakest?"" inquired Fakrash.",speakest inquire 
32,"""The Lord Mayor?"" said Horace. ""Oh, he's unique. There's nobody in the world quite like him. He administers the law, and if there's any distress in any part of the earth he relieves it. He entertains monarchs and Princes and all kinds of potentates at his banquets, and altogether he's a tremendous swell.""",say unique be world administer law be distress part earth relieve entertain monarch kind potentate banquet tremendous swell 
33,"""Hath he dominion over the earth and the air and all that is therein?""",hath dominion earth air 
34,"""Within his own precincts, I believe he has,"" said Horace, rather lazily, ""but I really don't know precisely how wide his powers are."" He was vainly trying to recollect whether such matters as sky-signs, telephones, and telegraphs in the City were within the Lord Mayor's jurisdiction or the County Council's.",own precinct believe say know wide power try recollect such matter sky sign telephone telegraph jurisdiction 
35,"Fakrash remained silent just as they were driving underneath Charing Cross Railway Bridge, when he started perceptibly at the thunder of the trains overhead and the piercing whistles of the engines. ""Tell me,"" he said, clutching Horace by the arm, ""what meaneth this?""",remain silent drive start thunder train piercing whistle engine tell say clutch arm meaneth 
36,"""You don't mean to say,"" said Horace, ""that you have been about London all these days, and never noticed things like these before?""",mean say say day notice thing 
37,"""Till now,"" said the Jinnee, ""I have had no leisure to observe them and discover their nature.""",say have leisure observe discover nature 
38,"""Well,"" said Horace, anxious to let the Jinnee see that he had not the monopoly of miracles, ""since your days we have discovered how to tame or chain the great forces of Nature and compel them to do our will. We control the Spirits of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, and make them give us light and heat, carry our messages, fight our quarrels for us, transport us wherever we wish to go, with a certainty and precision that throw even your performances, my dear sir, entirely into the shade.""",say anxious let see have monopoly miracle day discover tame chain great force compel do will control make give light heat carry message fight quarrel transport wish go certainty precision throw performance dear sir shade 
39,"Considering what a very large majority of civilised persons would be as powerless to construct the most elementary machine as to create the humblest kind of horse, it is not a little odd how complacently we credit ourselves with all the latest achievements of our generation. Most of us accept the amazement of the simple-minded barbarian on his first introduction to modern inventions as a gratifying personal tribute: we feel a certain superiority, even if we magnanimously refrain from boastfulness. And yet our own particular share in these discoveries is limited to making use of them under expert guidance, which any barbarian, after overcoming his first terror, is quite as competent to do as we are.",consider large majority civilised person powerless construct elementary machine create humblest kind horse little odd credit late achievement generation most accept amazement simple minded barbarian first introduction modern invention gratifying personal tribute feel certain superiority refrain boastfulness own particular share discovery limit make use expert guidance barbarian overcome first terror competent do 
40,"It is a harmless vanity enough, and especially pardonable in Ventimore's case, when it was so desirable to correct any tendency to ""uppishness"" on the part of the Jinnee.",harmless vanity pardonable case desirable correct tendency uppishness part 
41,"""And doth the Lord Mayor dispose of these forces at his will?"" inquired Fakrash, on whom Ventimore's explanation had evidently produced some impression.",dispose force will inquire explanation produce impression

46,"""Not yet,"" said the Jinnee, enigmatically, and indeed it proved to be another false alarm, for they turned down Cannon Street and towards the Mansion House.",say prove false alarm turn 
47,"""Perhaps you can tell me why we're going through Victoria Street, and what all this crowd has come out for?"" asked Ventimore. For the throng was denser than ever; the people surged and swayed in serried ranks behind the City police, and gazed with a wonder and awe that for once seemed to have entirely silenced the Cockney instinct of _persiflage_.",tell go crowd come ask throng denser person surge sway serry rank police gaze wonder awe seem silence instinct

51,"Horace glanced up at the hastily improvised decorations; on one large strip of bunting which spanned the street he read: ""Welcome to the City's most distinguished guest!"" ""They can't mean me,"" he thought; and then another legend caught his eye: ""Well done, Ventimore!"" And an enthusiastic householder next door had burst into poetry and displayed the couplet--",glance improvise decoration large strip bunting span street read distinguished guest mean think legend catch eye do enthusiastic householder next door burst poetry display couplet

55,"""I may have said something of the sort. But, good heavens! you don't mean that you have contrived that _I_ should receive the freedom of the City?""",say sort good heaven mean contrive receive freedom

60,"""This really won't do!"" urged Horace. ""It's not fair to me. Either I've done something, or you must have made the Corporation _believe_ I've done something, to be received like this. And, as we shall be in the Guildhall in a very few seconds, you may as well tell me what it is!""",do urge fair do make _believe_ do receive few second tell

65,"Their entrance was greeted by a politely-subdued buzz of applause and admiration, and an official, who introduced himself as the Prime Warden of the Candlestick-makers' Company, advanced to meet them. ""The Lord Mayor will receive you in the library,"" he said. ""If you will have the kindness to follow me----""",entrance greet subdued buzz applause admiration official introduce prime maker company advance meet receive library say have kindness follow

67,"As they came into the noble Library of the Guildhall a fine string band struck up, and Horace, with the Jinnee in his rear, made his way through a lane of distinguished spectators towards a dais, on the steps of which, in his gold-trimmed robes and black-feather hat, stood the Lord Mayor, with his sword and mace-bearers on either hand, and behind him a row of beaming sheriffs.",come noble fine string band strike rear make way lane distinguished spectator dais step gold trim robe black feather hat stand sword mace bearer hand row beam sheriff
