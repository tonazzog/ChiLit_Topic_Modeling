2, Haddie and I were not at all sorry to hear that mamma's call at Cranston's was not to be a hurried one.,sorry hear mamma call hurry one 
3,"""We don't mind if you are ever so long,"" I said; ""do we, Haddie?""",mind long say 
4,"""No, of course we don't,"" Haddie agreed. ""I should like to spend a whole day in those big show-rooms of his. Couldn't we have jolly games of hide-and-seek, Sis? And then riding the lions! I wish you were rich enough to buy one of the lions, mamma, and have it for an ornament in the hall, or in the drawing-room.""",course agree like spend whole day big show room have jolly game hide seek ride lion wish rich buy lion mamma have ornament hall draw room 
5,"""We should need to build a hall or a drawing-room to hold it,"" said mamma, laughing. ""I'm afraid your lion would turn into a white elephant, Haddie, if it became ours.""",need build hall draw room hold say mamma laugh afraid lion turn white elephant become 
6,"I remember wondering what she meant. How could a lion turn into an elephant? But I was rather a slow child in some ways. Very often I thought a thing over a long time in my mind if I did not understand it before asking any one to explain it. And so before I said anything it went out of my head, for here we were at Cranston's door.",remember wonder mean lion turn elephant slow child way think thing long time mind understand ask one explain say go head door 
7,"There was only a young shopman to be seen, but when mamma told him she particularly wanted to see Mr. Cranston himself, he asked us to step in and take a seat while he went to fetch him.",be young shopman see mamma tell want see ask step take seat go fetch 
8,"We passed between the lions. It seemed quite a long time since we had seen them, and I thought they looked at us very kindly. I was just nudging Haddie to whisper this to him when mamma stopped to say to us that we might stay in the outer room if we liked; she knew it was our favourite place, and in a few minutes we heard her talking to old Mr. Cranston, who had come to her in the inner show-room through another door.",pass lion seem long time see think look nudge whisper mamma stop say stay outer room like know favourite place few minute hear talk old come inner show room door 
9,"Haddie's head was full of climbing up onto one of the lions to go a ride. But luckily he could not find anything to climb up with, which was a very good thing, as he would have been pretty sure to topple over, and Mr. Cranston would not have been at all pleased if he had scratched the lion.",head full climb lion go ride find climb good thing sure topple pleased scratch lion 
10,"To keep him quiet I began talking to him about my fancies. I made him look close into the lions' faces--it was getting late in the afternoon, and we had noticed before we came in that the sun was setting stormily. A ray of bright orange-coloured light found its way in through one of the high-up windows which were at the back of the show-room, and fell right across the mane of one of the lions and almost into the eyes of the other. The effect on the dark, almost black, wood of which they were made was very curious.",keep quiet begin talk fancy make look close lion face get afternoon notice come sun set ray bright orange coloured light find way high window back show room fall mane lion eye other effect dark black wood make curious 
11,"""Look, Haddie,"" I said suddenly, catching his arm, ""doesn't it really look as if they were smiling at us--the one with the light on its face especially? I really do think there's something funny about them--I wonder if they are enchanted.""",look say catching arm look smile one light face think be funny wonder enchanted 
12,"Haddie did not laugh at me. I think in his heart he was fond of fancies too, though he might not have liked the boys at school to know it. He sat staring at our queer friends nearly as earnestly as I did myself. And as the ray of light slowly faded, he turned to me.",laugh think heart fond fancy like boy school know sit stare queer friend do ray light fade turn 
13,"""Yes,"" he said, ""their faces do seem to change. But I think they always look kind.""",say face seem change think look kind 
14,"""They do to _us_,"" I said confidently, ""but sometimes they are quite fierce. I don't think they looked at us the way they do now the first time they saw us. And one day one of the men in the shop shoved something against one of them and his face frowned--I'm sure it did.""",do say fierce think look way do first time see day man shop shove face frown sure 
15,"""I wonder if he'd frown if I got up on his back,"" said Haddie.",wonder frown get back say 
16,"""Oh, do leave off about climbing on their backs,"" I said. ""It wouldn't be at all comfortable--they're so broad, you couldn't sit cross-legs, and they'd be as slippery as anything. It's much nicer to make up stories about them coming alive in the night, or turning into black princes and saying magic words to make the doors open like in the Arabian Nights.""",leave climb back say comfortable broad sit cross-leg slippery nice make story come alive night turn black prince say magic word make door open arabian 
17,"""Well, tell me stories of all they do then,"" said Haddie condescendingly.",tell story do say 
18,"""I will if you'll let me think for a minute,"" I said. ""I wish Aunty Etta was here--she does know such lovely stories.""",let think minute say wish know such lovely story 
19,"""I like yours quite as well,"" said Haddie encouragingly, ""I don't remember Aunty Etta's; it's such a long time since I saw her. You saw her last year, you know, but I didn't.""",like say remember long time see see last year know 
20,"""She told me one about a china parrot, a most beautiful green and gold parrot, that was really a fairy,"" I said. ""I think I could turn it into a lion story, if I thought about it.""",tell china parrot beautiful green gold parrot fairy say think turn lion story think 
21,"""No,"" said Haddie, ""you can tell the parrot one another time. I'd rather hear one of your own stories, new, about the lions. I know you've got some in your head. Begin, do--I'll help you if you can't get on.""",say tell parrot one time hear own story new lion know get head begin do help get 
22,"But my story that afternoon was not to be heard. Just as I was beginning with, ""Well, then, there was once an old witch who lived in a very lonely hut in the middle of a great forest,"" there came voices behind us, and in another moment we heard mamma saying,",story afternoon hear begin be old witch live lonely hut middle great forest come voice moment hear mamma say 
23,"""Haddie, my boy, Geraldine, I am quite ready.""",boy ready 
24,"I was not very sorry. I liked to have more time to make up my stories, and Haddie sometimes hurried me so. It was Aunty Etta, I think, who had first put it into my head to make them. She was _so_ clever about it herself, both in making stories and in remembering those she had read, and she _had_ read a lot. But she was away in India at the time I am now writing about; her going so far off was a great sorrow to mamma.",sorry like have more time make story hurry think put head make clever make story remember read read lot time write go great sorrow mamma 
25,"Haddie and I started up at once. We had to be very obedient, what father called ""quickly obedient,"" and though he was so kind he was very strict too.",start have obedient father call obedient kind strict 
26,"""My children are great admirers of your lions, Mr. Cranston,"" mamma said; and the old man smiled.",child great admirer lion mamma say old man smile 
27,"""They are not singular in their taste, madam,"" he said. ""I own that I am very proud of them myself, and when my poor daughter was a child there was nothing pleased her so much as when her mother or I lifted her on to one of them, and made believe she was going a ride.""",singular taste madam say own proud poor daughter child be pleased mother lift make believe go ride

31,"""Oh, by the bye, Mr. Cranston,"" she went on, ""I was forgetting to ask how your little grandchild is. Have you seen her lately?""",bye go forget ask little grandchild see 
32,Old Cranston's face brightened.,old face brighten 
33,"""She is very well, madam, I thank you,"" he replied. ""And I am pleased to say that she is coming to stay with us shortly. We hope to keep her through the winter. Her stepmother is very kind, but with little children of her own, it is not always easy for her to give as much attention as she would like to Myra, and she and Mr. Raby have responded cordially to our invitation.""",madam thank reply pleased say come stay hope keep winter stepmother kind little child own easy give much attention like respond invitation

39,"And then we left, Mr. Cranston respectfully holding the door open.",leave hold door open 
40,"It was growing quite dark; the street-lamps were lighted and their gleam was reflected on the pavement, for it had been raining and was still quite wet underfoot. Mamma looked round her.",grow dark street lamp light gleam reflect pavement rain wet underfoot look 
41,"""You had better put on your mackintosh, Haddie,"" she said. ""It may rain again. No, Geraldine dear, there is no use opening your umbrella till it does rain.""",have good put say rain dear be use open umbrella rain 
42,"My feelings were divided between pride in my umbrella and some reluctance to have it wet! I took hold of mamma's arm again, while Haddie walked at her other side. It was not a very cheerful prospect before us--the gloomy dirty streets of Mexington were now muddy and sloppy as well--though on the whole I don't know but that they looked rather more cheerful by gaslight than in the day. It was chilly too, for the season was now very late autumn, if not winter. But little did we care--I don't think there could have been found anywhere two happier children than my brother and I that dull rainy evening as we trotted along beside our mother. There was the feeling of _her_ to take care of us, of our cheerful home waiting for us, with a bright fire and the tea-table all spread. If I had not been a little tired--for we had walked a good way--in my heart I was just as ready to skip along on the tips of my toes as when we first came out.",feeling divide pride umbrella reluctance have wet take hold mamma arm walk other side cheerful prospect gloomy dirty street muddy sloppy whole know look cheerful gaslight day chilly season late autumn winter little care think find happy child brother dull rainy evening trotet mother be feeling _her_ take care cheerful home waiting bright fire tea table spread little tired walk good way heart ready skip tip toe come

47,"""We'd offer it her of course, but you know she wouldn't take it,"" he replied. ""So it's much better to have really enough for all.""",offer course know take reply good have enough

54,"I remember exactly what we bought, partly, perhaps, because it was our usual choice. We used to think it over a good deal first and each would suggest something different, but in the end we nearly always came back to the old plan for the outlay of our sixpence, namely, half-penny crumpets for threepence--that meant _seven_, not six; it was the received custom to give seven for threepence--and half-penny Bath buns for the other threepence--seven of them too, of course. And _Bath_ buns, not plain ones. You cannot get these now--not at least in any place where I have lived of late years. And I am not sure but that even at Mexington they were a _spécialité_ of dear old Miss Fryer's. They were so good; indeed, everything she sold was thoroughly good of its kind. She was so honest, using the best materials for all she made.",remember buy usual choice use think good deal suggest different end come old plan outlay sixpence half penny crumpet threepence mean receive custom give threepence half penny bun other threepence course bun plain one get least place live late year sure _spécialité_ dear old good sell good kind honest use good material make 
55,"That evening she stood with her usual gentle gravity while we discussed what we should have, and when after discarding sponge-cakes and finger-biscuits, which we had thought of ""for a change,"" and partly because finger-biscuits weighed light and made a good show, we came round at last to the seven crumpets and seven buns, she listened as seriously and put them up in their little paper bags with as much interest as though the ceremony had never been gone through before. And then just as we were turning to leave, she lifted up a glass shade and drew out two cheese-cakes, which she proceeded to put into another paper bag.",evening stand usual gentle gravity discuss have discard sponge cake finger biscuit think change finger biscuit weigh light make good show come last crumpet bun listen put little paper bag much interest ceremony go turn leave lift glass shade draw cheese cake proceed put paper bag

61,"Mamma sighed a little as she spoke. I felt sorry for her disappointment, but, selfishly speaking, we sometimes rather enjoyed the evenings father was late, for then mamma gave us her whole attention, as she was not able to do when he was at home. And though we were very fond of our father, we were--I especially, I think--much more afraid of him than of our mother.",sigh little speak feel sorry disappointment speak enjoy evening father late mamma give whole attention able do home fond father think afraid mother 
62,"And that was such a happy evening! I have never forgotten it. Mamma was so good and thoughtful for us, she did not let us find out in the least that she was feeling anxious on account of something father had said in his note to her. She was just perfectly sweet.",happy evening forget good thoughtful let find least feel anxious account father say note sweet 
63,"We were very proud of our spoils from Miss Fryer's. We wanted mamma to have one cheesecake and Haddie and I to divide the other between us. But mamma would not agree to that. She would only take a half, so that we had three-quarters each.",proud spoil want mamma have cheesecake divide other mamma agree take half have quarter

75,"""There are very different kinds of shopkeepers, Haddie,"" said mamma. ""Mr. Cranston is very rich, and his daughter was very well educated and very nice. Still, no doubt Mr. Raby was in a higher position than she, and both Mr. Cranston and his wife are very right-minded people, and never pretend to be more than they are. That is why I was so glad to hear that little Myra is coming to stay with them. I was afraid the second Mrs. Raby might have looked down upon them perhaps.""",be different kind shopkeeper say mamma rich daughter educate nice doubt high position wife right minded person pretend more glad hear little come stay afraid second look 
76,"Haddie said no more about it. And though I listened to what mamma said, I don't think I quite took in the sense of it till a good while afterwards. It has often been like that with me in life. I have a curiously ""retentive"" memory, as it is called. Words and speeches remain in my mind like unread letters, till some day, quite unexpectedly, something reminds me of them, and I take them out, as it were, and find what they really meant.",say more listen mamma say think take sense good while life have retentive memory call word speech remain mind unread letter day remind take find mean

I have never had any little girl to play with, and it is so dull sometimes--the days that Haddie is late at school and when you are busy. Do say I may have her--I'm sure old Mr. Cranston would let her come, and then I might go and play with her sometimes perhaps. Do you think she will play among the furniture--where the lions are?""",say nice little girl mamma have come see play have little girl play dull day late school busy say have sure old let come go play think play furniture lion
