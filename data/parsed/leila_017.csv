2," Many weeks now passed on tranquilly and without any marked event. The poor widow Barlow and her family had been frequently visited. Mr. Howard had been liberal in rendering her assistance, and Leila and her cousins had employed many of their leisure hours in working for the children, who were now comfortably clothed, and the elder ones put to school. Matilda had most cheerfully contributed her share, both in money and in work, and Mrs. Roberts gave a favourable report of her general improvement; her constant association with Selina and Leila was certainly producing a favourable effect on her character, but she was still easily misled by bad example, and often unprepared to meet the hour of trial; present gratification was generally yielded to, and though in most cases deep repentance followed, her feelings were as yet stronger than her principles, and the many good resolutions made in the hour of sorrow too often gave way before fresh temptation.",many week pass tranquilly mark event poor widow family visit liberal rendering assistance cousin employ many leisure hour work child cloth elder one put school contribute share money work give favourable report general improvement constant association produce favourable effect character misl bad example unprepared meet hour trial present gratification yield most case deep repentance follow feeling strong principle many good resolution make hour sorrow give way fresh temptation 
3,"It was now nearly Midsummer; the precious seeds had not only sprung up into three healthy plants, but each plant presented flower-buds of promising appearance. The old gardener, however, would not hear of their being transplanted into separate pots till the autumn, assuring Leila that were he to do so sooner it would prevent the flower-buds from opening, and in every way retard the growth of the plant. This was a disappointment; but she consoled herself by having the flower-pot removed into her own room and placed on a flower-stand before the window, that she might watch the opening of the blossoms, having resolved to gather the first-blown flower for Mrs. Herbert.",precious seed spring healthy plant plant present flower bud promising appearance old gardener hear transplant separate pot autumn assure do prevent flower bud opening way retard growth plant disappointment console have flower pot remove own room place flower stand window watch opening blossom resolve gather first blow flower 
4,"Mr. and Mrs. Stanley, with Selina and Matilda, were now passing a few days at Woodlands, and Leila had obtained permission from her papa to invite Lydia Mildmay to spend the following day with them, as it was Matilda’s birthday, and she knew it would give her pleasure.",pass few day obtain permission papa invite spend follow day birthday know give pleasure 
5,"A brilliant sun awoke the sisters at an early hour, yet they found that Leila must have already visited them, for their pretty white bed was strewed with fresh flowers. The dew of the morning was still upon them, and Matilda thought no flowers before had ever smelt so sweet; she sprang up to rush into Leila’s room to thank her, when her steps were arrested by seeing a little table placed by her bed-side, over which a covering of embroidered muslin was thrown.",brilliant sun awoke sister early hour find visit pretty white bed strew fresh flower dew morning think flower smell sweet spring rush room thank step arrest see little table place bed side covering embroider muslin throw 
6,"“This is Cousin Leila again,” she exclaimed, as she hastily lifted the white drapery, which proved to be an embroidered apron, worked by Leila for this happy occasion. On the table was placed a pretty little writing-desk, a present from her papa and mamma, a case in mother-of-pearl, with pens, pencil, sealing-wax, &c., from her Uncle Herbert, and a beautiful purse worked by Selina. Matilda was in ecstasies; how she got dressed she never very well knew; she had no distinct remembrance but of being half smothered with heat from being closely wrapped up in a shawl and carried back to her room by Nurse, who looked unutterable things. How she longed for twelve o’clock, the hour at which her friend was to arrive; for to show all those beauties to Lydia Mildmay would be such a renewal of her pleasure!",cousin exclaim lift white drapery prove embroider apron work happy occasion table place little writing desk present papa mamma case mother pearl pen pencil sealing wax &c. beautiful purse work ecstasie dress know have distinct remembrance half smother heat wrap shawl carry room look unutterable thing long o'clock hour friend arrive show beauty renewal pleasure 
7,"Twelve o’clock came at last; but Matilda was disappointed when Lydia saw her pretty bed, (for Matilda had carefully preserved the flowers upon it,) she only shrugged her shoulders, exclaiming, “How vastly poetical we are.” And though she said all that was civil when she saw the presents, her admiration fell far short of what had been expected; and all, that but the moment before had appeared so beautiful in Matilda’s eyes, fell considerably in her estimation, when Lydia, with an affected air of indifference, observed, “This seems a day for showing presents, so perhaps you would like to see a little trifle which my godmother presented to me some little time ago; at first I thought it rather pretty, though now I don’t think much of it;” and she took from her reticule a beautiful little _etui_ of the most finished workmanship. It was a walnut-shell, bound and lined with gold, containing scissors, bodkin, and thimble, with small tablets of mother-of-pearl, and a gold pencil-case with an amethyst top. Matilda gazed in speechless admiration. If Lydia’s intention was to mortify her, she might have been satisfied with the look with which Matilda now contemplated all that had before given her so much pleasure; but after a little time she rallied again, and whispering to Leila that if her presents were not quite so beautiful, they were at least far more useful, she quite brightened up, and proposed that they should go into the conservatory to visit the parrots, and then into the garden.",o'clock come last disappoint see pretty bed preserve flower shrugg shoulder exclaim poetical say civil see present admiration fall short expect moment appear beautiful eye fall estimation affect air indifference observe seem day show present like see little trifle godmother present little time first think pretty think much take reticule beautiful little _etui_ finish workmanship walnut shell bind line gold contain scissors bodkin thimble small tablet mother pearl gold pencil case amethyst top gaze speechless admiration intention mortify satisfy look contemplate give much pleasure little time rally whisper present beautiful least useful brighten propose go conservatory visit parrot garden 
8,"The day seemed to pass very pleasantly to all; for though Lydia and Matilda were always going off by themselves, the hours never seemed long when Selina and Leila were together. Immediately after dinner the carriage was sent for. Lydia, to convey her home, as there was a large dinner party, and her mamma wished her to be present in the drawing-room. Matilda seemed quite unhappy in parting with her; indeed, having this intelligence communicated to her just as they were sitting down to dinner seemed quite to overset her. She held her hand at parting, and looked anxiously up in her face, then followed her a few steps as she was leaving the room, and for some minutes they whispered together. When Matilda returned, Leila observed that her eyes were full of tears. She went up to her, and took her kindly by the hand, but Matilda hastily pushed her away, and ran out of the room.",day seem pass go hour seem dinner carriage send convey home be large dinner party mamma wish present draw room seem unhappy part have intelligence communicate sit dinner seem overset hold hand parting look face follow few step leave room minute whisper return observe eye full tear go take hand push run room 
9,"“What can be the matter with Matilda?” Leila inquired; “did you observe, Selina, she appeared quite angry with me? Do you think it is only that she is sorry Lydia has gone away, or have I done any thing to offend her? Should I go and ask her, do you think?”",matter inquire observe appear angry think sorry go do thing offend go ask think 
10,"“No, Leila, I think you had better not. You have done nothing to make her angry. I am sure it is not that. Matilda is never the better of being alone with Lydia Mildmay; I am quite sorry now we left them so much together; but I so dislike appearing to watch them; I fear something has happened, for I know the expression of Matilda’s face so well--it was not only at the moment of parting she was so much overset. Did you not observe her at dinner?”",think have good do make angry sure good alone sorry leave dislike appear watch fear happen know expression face moment part overset observe dinner

12,"“Yes, she tried to laugh; but she looked very unhappy; and it was only when she saw me looking at her that she laughed. At one time she kept crumbling all her bread down on the carpet, as if she did not know what she was about, and once or twice she could scarcely swallow. Then mamma said something to her, and she grew very red, and seemed to wish to hide her hands under the table.”",try laugh look unhappy see look laugh time keep crumble bread carpet know swallow mamma say grow red seem wish hide hand table 
13,"“O I can tell you what made her grow red then.

14,"Selina shook her head. “I don’t understand it,” she said; “but I fear Matilda has done something wrong.”",shake head understand say fear do wrong 
15,"“Then I am sure it must be Lydia’s fault if she has,” Leila said eagerly: “for Mrs. Roberts says she improved so much of late. I am so sorry I invited Lydia, and papa advised me not; he said he thought we three would be quite happy together. I wish he had said steadily, ‘No, Leila, I don’t wish it;’ but he very seldom now tells me I am not to do a thing, as he used to do in the island; he says now that I am older I should learn to govern myself, and that in most cases he wishes only to advise. So it is my fault also if Matilda has done wrong, for I invited Lydia.”",sure fault say say improve much late sorry invite advise say think happy wish say wish tell do thing use do island say old learn govern most case wish advise fault do wrong invite 
16,"“But, Leila, we must not blame Lydia without knowing. How can we but----” She was interrupted by Matilda looking into the room, she drew hastily back, but on Selina calling to her, she advanced a few steps, hesitated, and looking anxiously in Leila’s face for a moment, again left the room. They both observed that her eyes were swoln with weeping, and Selina, now seriously alarmed, said she must go into the drawing-room, and find out if her mamma was aware if any thing was wrong. She thought now she should speak to her mamma, and she would come up into Leila’s room and tell her what she had heard.",blame know interrupt look room draw call advance few step hesitate look face moment leave room observe eye swoln weeping alarm say go draw room find mamma aware thing wrong think speak mamma come room tell hear

18,"They all followed her into her room--every thing seemed in perfect order, and the flower-pot stood exactly where Leila had placed it; but two of the plants seemed withered, and when Mrs. Stanley touched them they fell from her hand on the carpet, they evidently had been broken off and carefully stuck into the earth again.",follow room thing seem perfect order flower pot stand place plant seem wither touch fall hand carpet break stick earth

25,"When the flowers fell to the ground, Leila had hidden her face on her papa’s shoulder, and was struggling with her emotion; she now looked up, and turning to Mrs. Stanley, she said, “Aunt, there is still one plant left, and it must have been an accident. O don’t say any thing more about it.”",flower fall ground hide face papa shoulder struggle emotion look turn say be plant leave accident say thing more 
26,"But Mrs. Stanley would not yield to this. “No, my love,” she said, “it is quite necessary that I should endeavour to discover the truth. The overturning of the flower-pot might have been an accident, but the attempt to deceive, the replanting the flowers in the earth, could not have been accidental. Now, Amy, recollect yourself, and tell me if you have seen any one leaving this room lately?”",yield love say necessary endeavour discover truth overturning flower pot accident attempt deceive replant flower earth accidental recollect tell see one leave room

37,"Amy left the room. Mr. Howard also rose and quitted the room just as Matilda was entering it; she came in trembling excessively, and looking very pale, but the moment Mrs. Stanley placed the flower-pot before her and said, “Matilda, do you know any thing of this?” the deepest colour suffused her face, and mounted to her temples. She remained silent.",leave room rise quit room enter come tremble look pale moment place flower pot say know thing deep colour suffuse face mount temple remain silent

40,"Mrs. Stanley fixed her eyes upon her face. “Matilda,” she said, “I happened to be in your cousin’s room immediately before dinner; I went to look for a book. The flowers then looked perfectly fresh; you must have overturned the flower-pot when Amy saw you coming out of the room this evening.”",fix eye face say happen cousin room dinner go look book flower look fresh overturn flower pot see come room evening 
41,"Matilda’s agitation increased; she tried to speak, but Mrs. Stanley with difficulty could make out the words, “No, mamma.”",agitation increase try speak difficulty make word mamma 
42,"Mrs. Stanley herself now became much agitated. “Oh, Matilda,” she said, “I conjure you to speak out, and tell me clearly what did happen; do not let me have the pain of feeling that my child has not only shown duplicity in the attempt to conceal what at first was probably only an accident, but is now adding falsehood to her fault; tell me distinctly, did you or did you not overthrow that flower-pot and break those flowers?”",become agitated say conjure speak tell happen let have pain feeling child show duplicity attempt conceal first accident add falsehood fault tell overthrow flower pot break flower

44,"Leila went up to her and whispered, “Matilda, dear Matilda, speak the truth, don’t be afraid; I am not angry, I don’t care now for the flowers, that is, I don’t care very much, I am not so sorry for them now, indeed I am not. But say you did it, O do say it; don’t make God angry with you. O pray that this temptation may be taken from you; He will give you strength.”",go whisper dear speak truth afraid angry care flower care sorry say do say make angry pray temptation take give strength 
45,"Matilda was still silent, but the piteous look she cast on Leila was heart-rending.",silent piteous look cast heart rending 
46,"Mrs. Stanley again spoke. “Matilda,” she said, “I see it is vain to prolong this scene. Go to your room, and on your knees pray earnestly to your heavenly Father to touch your sinful heart; when you have asked forgiveness of Him, and have resolved to make a full and free confession of your fault, send for me, I will be ready to come to you at any moment.”",speak say see vain prolong scene go room knee pray heavenly father touch sinful heart ask forgiveness resolve make full free confession fault send ready come moment 
47,"Matilda left the room; Mrs. Stanley soon after followed. Selina and Leila were left alone; Selina was silently weeping. Neither of them spoke for several minutes. Leila then said, “Selina, we cannot be quite certain that Matilda is deceiving us; Lydia may have done this.”",leave room follow leave alone weep speak several minute say certain deceive do 
48,"Selina shook her head. “O that I could think so, but I cannot. I know the expression of Matilda’s face too well. I always know when she has done wrong; and you forget, Leila, that mamma saw the flowers just before dinner, and they looked quite fresh then; and Lydia was not in your room after dinner, you know we were all with her till the moment she went away. When did you last observe them yourself? You must have been in the room when you were changing your dress for dinner.”",shake head think know expression face know do wrong forget mamma see flower dinner look fresh room dinner know moment go observe room change dress dinner 
49,"Leila looked much distressed as she answered, “Yes, I saw them, and they did look fresh; I remember it, because I observed drops of water on the leaves, and the earth looked wet, and I knew that Amy must have watered them--she often does so when the day has been warm; Amy was very fond of my poor flowers.” She had no sooner uttered the words than she coloured. “It was very wrong in me to say this, and to make you more sorry, for indeed it is not the flowers I am thinking most of now: and you know, Selina, I have still three more seeds to sow. How wise it was of papa to advise me to keep them in case of accidents, and not to risk all at once. O if I would always take papa’s advice, every thing would be well; if I had taken his advice about Lydia, and had not invited her, Matilda would have been with us as usual during the whole time, and this would not have happened. And yet papa says I must learn to judge for myself, I must not lean too much on others; how difficult all this is.

52,The door of Matilda’s room they saw was not entirely shut as they passed.,door room see shut pass 
53,"“Perhaps she might speak to me,” Selina said. She advanced a few steps into the room; Matilda had thrown herself upon the bed. The flowers with which it had been so lately decked now lay scattered on the floor. Matilda evidently saw her, for she looked up for a moment, but she did not speak, and they passed on to the garden.",speak say advance few step room throw bed flower deck scatter floor see look moment speak pass garden 
54,"The whole evening wore slowly away, and no message came from Matilda; every time the drawing-room door opened, Selina and Leila were in anxious expectation--but still no message came. The young people went early to bed: how brightly had the morning dawned upon them, and now all was turned to sorrow. The first thing which struck Leila on entering her room was the muslin apron which she had embroidered for Matilda folded up and laid upon her bed; had she looked into her aunt’s room, she would have seen the writing-desk also returned, and placed upon the table. Had Matilda done this? had she felt that she was unworthy of retaining those gifts which had been given her as marks of love and affection? Leila prayed earnestly for Matilda, but it was long before she could compose herself to sleep; the piteous look which Matilda had cast upon her haunted her imagination.",whole evening wear message come time draw room door open anxious expectation message come young person go bed have morning dawn turn sorrow first thing strike enter room muslin apron embroider fold lay bed look aunt room see writing desk return place table do feel unworthy retain gift give mark love affection pray long compose sleep piteous look cast haunt imagination 
55,"Meanwhile poor Selina was not less unhappy. On entering the bed-room, she found Matilda seated at the table writing a letter. She looked much fluttered when Selina entered, and hastily threw her pocket-handkerchief over something on the table. Selina felt almost certain it was the _etui_ which Matilda had admired so much. Matilda seemed unwilling to begin to undress; after a short time she said, making a visible effort to speak calmly, “Selina, do go to bed, and go quickly. I can’t come just yet; don’t ask me why.”",poor unhappy enter bed room find seat table write letter look flutter enter throw pocket handkerchief table feel certain _etui_ admire much seem unwilling begin undress short time say make visible effort speak go bed go come ask 
56,"Selina began to undress. She then took her Bible to read as usual before saying her prayers. “Matilda,” she said, after a few minutes, “may I read you this text which I have turned up?”",begin undress take read usual say prayer say few minute read text turn 
57,There seemed a silent assent.,seem silent assent 
58,"Selina read, “There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.” “Yes,” Selina said, “and it is by praying to God that we shall obtain His assistance,” and she knelt down by the side of her bed.",read have temptation take such common man faithful suffer tempt able temptation make way escape able bear say pray obtain assistance knolt side bed 
59,"For some time after she had lain down, all was still in the room. Selina had turned her face from her sister, that she might not seem to watch her. After some time Matilda rose; she stood for a moment by the bed, then put something very gently below the pillow; she started when Selina said, “Matilda, I am not asleep;” but she knelt down, said her prayers, and then got into bed.",time lain room turn face sister seem watch time rise stand moment bed put pillow start say asleep knolt say prayer get bed 
60,"“How very cold you are, dear Matilda,” Selina said; “and how you tremble. O why will you not tell me all?”",cold dear say tremble tell 
61,"Matilda pressed her hand. “Good night, dearest; try to sleep.”",press hand good night dearest try sleep 
62,"Matilda seemed more composed; Selina felt comfort, she knew not why. After a considerable time Selina did sleep. She was awakened early by the bright morning sun, but when she opened her eyes she saw Matilda was not there. She called to her, there was no answer. Much alarmed, she sprang out of bed and flew to the window. She saw Matilda fully dressed, standing below a tree speaking to the gardener’s boy; she put a small packet into his hand, and pointed across the lawn in the direction of Mr. Mildmay’s. The packet was larger than a letter, Selina felt sure it was the _etui_. She retreated from the window, and when Matilda returned, took no notice of what she had seen. At the breakfast-table there was no Matilda with her smiling face. All the morning she continued in her room, seated by the window; she had her work in her hand, but was generally looking out along the approach as if she expected some one. About the middle of the day a servant in livery was seen approaching; he held a letter in his hand; as he stopped below her window, she strained her eyes to catch the address, but could not. Poor Matilda! how her heart beat, and how her colour went and came; but no one entered her room--the letter then could not have been for her. She called to Amy, who said she believed the servant had brought a letter for Mrs. Stanley. At that moment Selina came running in. “Matilda,” she said, “Mrs. Mildmay has written to say that Lydia has lost her ruby ring, and she begs it may be carefully looked for; she returned home, she says, with only one glove, and Mrs. Mildmay thinks she may have pulled it off in the glove, and trusts we may be able to find it.”",seem compose feel comfort know considerable time sleep awaken bright morning sun open eye see call be answer alarm spring bed fly window see dress stand tree speak gardener boy put small packet hand point lawn direction packet large letter feel sure _etui_ retreat window return take notice see breakfast table be smile face morning continue room seat window have work hand look approach expect one middle day servant livery see approach hold letter hand stop window strain eye catch address poor heart beat colour go come enter room letter call say believe servant bring letter moment come run say write say lose ruby ring beg look return say glove think pull glove trust able find 
63,"Selina looked earnestly at Matilda, but her expression she could not make out; she had brightened up considerably at first, but now there was only agitation visible, and she made no effort to assist in looking for the lost glove. It was not to be found in Matilda’s room; the drawing-room and dining-room had already been searched. They now proceeded to Leila’s apartment. Here they were equally unsuccessful: under the bed, under every chair, they searched in vain. Suddenly it struck Selina that it was at dinner, while Lydia was still there, that her mamma had observed that Matilda’s nails were black. There was a small window in one corner of Leila’s room which looked out upon the court; she threw open this window and gazed eagerly out; she saw something lying which might be a glove. Amy ran down into the court, and returned with the glove in her hand. The ring was sticking in one of the fingers, but the pale kid glove was much stained with earth, and could not have been used again. A new light seemed to dawn on Mrs. Stanley; “Amy,” she said, “go to the coachman, and tell him I shall require the carriage as quickly as possible, I must drive over to Mrs. Mildmay’s.” Then turning to Selina, she whispered, “I wish Matilda to return to her room, and let no one question her.”",look expression make brighten first be agitation visible make effort assist look lose glove find room draw room dining room search proceed apartment unsuccessful bed chair search vain strike dinner mamma observe nail black be small window corner room look court throw open window gaze see lie glove run court return glove hand ring stick finger pale kid glove stain earth use new light seem dawn say go coachman tell require carriage possible drive turn whisper wish return room let question 
64,"The hour of Mrs. Stanley’s absence was an anxious hour to all. Selina and Leila were both with Matilda when the carriage was seen returning; when it stopped before the door Matilda seemed scarcely able to breathe. Mrs. Stanley entered and took her in her arms. “My poor child,” she said, “you have been very, very wrong; but, thank God, you have not told an untruth. O Matilda, how you have been injured by bad example, and how far the evil might have spread, had I not discovered Lydia’s artful character! Mrs. Mildmay told me she suspected something was wrong when she found you had written to Lydia, and sent back her _etui_; and even before I went she had extracted from her a sort of half confession. Unhappy girl! but she now seems completely penitent.” Then turning to Leila and Selina, she continued, “She seemed anxious to tell me all; she said that she had insisted on going into Leila’s room, as she wished to see her books and some pretty ornaments she had observed on the mantel-piece; that when she overturned the flower-stand, Matilda had wished her immediately to confess it, but she would not; that she had stuck the flowers into the earth and watered them, in the hope of keeping them fresh as long as she remained, and that she had bribed Matilda to perfect silence by offering her the _etui_; that Matilda at first refused, but afterwards yielded, and that Lydia had made her promise that she was to answer no questions, that she was not on any account to say she had not done it. Alas! my child, how you grieved the Holy Spirit when you took that wicked bribe; but deeply have you suffered, and I will inflict no further punishment upon you, than that you should remain in your room during the day. Think deeply of all that has passed, and of the misery you have endured, and pray earnestly to God for his forgiveness, and for strength to resist future temptation. Also you must give me your promise to give up all intimacy with Lydia Mildmay, and never to trust yourself alone with her again, unless in after years I give you leave to do so.”",hour absence anxious hour carriage see return stop door seem able breathe enter take arm poor child say wrong thank tell untruth injure bad example evil spread discover artful character tell suspect wrong find write send _etui_ go extract sort half confession unhappy girl seem penitent turn continue seem anxious tell say insist go room wish see book pretty ornament observe mantel piece overturn flower stand wish confess stick flower earth water hope keep fresh remain bribe perfect silence offer _etui_ refuse yield make promise answer question account say do child grieve holy take wicked bribe suffer inflict further punishment remain room day think pass misery endure pray forgiveness strength resist future temptation give promise give intimacy trust year give leave do 
65,"Matilda threw herself again into her mamma’s arms, but she could not speak. She then slowly left the room.",throw mamma arm speak leave room 
66,"“Selina,” she said, when soon after she was alone with her sister, “you can never know how unhappy I have been. I cannot tell it you. O it was so dreadful when mamma questioned me, and I dared not tell! And when I thought you all believed I was telling untruths, and that you could never love me again, I thought my heart would break. I did not know what was right and what was wrong, and for a long time I could not pray. But then I did, and God seemed to put it into my heart to send back the _etui_, and ask leave to tell; and I was a little happier after that. But when you took my hand in bed, and asked me again to tell, I grew worse again. I could not sleep; (only now and then a little;) my best time was when I stood under the tree, and saw the gardener’s boy running across the lawn with my letter, the air was so fresh, and the birds were singing, and the sun made every thing so beautiful.
