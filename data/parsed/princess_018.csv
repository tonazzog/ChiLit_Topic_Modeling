1,CHAPTER XVIII. CURDIE'S CLUE,clue 
2," CURDIE was as watchful as ever, but was almost getting tired of his ill-success. Every other night or so he followed the goblins about, as they went on digging and boring, and getting as near them as he could, watched them from behind stones and rocks; but as yet he seemed no nearer finding out what they had in view. As at first, he always kept hold of the end of his string, while his pickaxe left just outside the hole by which he entered the goblins' country from the mine, continued to serve as an anchor and hold fast the other end. The goblins hearing no more noise in that quarter, had ceased to apprehend an immediate invasion, and kept no watch.",watchful get tired ill success other night follow goblin go digg boring get watch stone rock seem find have view keep hold end string pickaxe leave hole enter goblin country continue serve anchor hold other end goblin hear more noise quarter cease apprehend immediate invasion keep watch 
3,"One night, after dodging about and listening till he was nearly falling asleep with weariness, he began to roll up his ball, for he had resolved to go home to bed. It was not long, however, before he began to feel bewildered. One after another he passed goblin-houses, caves that is, occupied by goblin families, and at length was sure they were many more than he had passed as he came. He had to use great caution to pass unseen--they lay so close together. Could his string have led him wrong? He still followed winding it, and still it led him into more thickly populated quarters, until he became quite uneasy, and indeed apprehensive; for although he was not afraid of the _cobs_, he was afraid of not finding his way out. But what could he do? It was of no use to sit down and wait for the morning--the morning made no difference here. It was all dark, and always dark; and if his string failed him he was helpless. He might even arrive within a yard of the mine, and never know it. Seeing he could do nothing better, he would at least find where the end of the string was, and if possible how it had come to play him such a trick. He knew by the size of the ball that he was getting pretty near the last of it, when he began to feel a tugging and pulling at it. What could it mean? Turning a sharp corner, he thought he heard strange sounds. These grew, as he went on, to a scuffling and growling and squeaking; and the noise increased, until, turning a second sharp corner, he found himself in the midst of it, and the same moment tumbled over a wallowing mass, which he knew must be a knot of the cobs' creatures. Before he could recover his feet, he had caught some great scratches on his face, and several severe bites on his legs and arms. But as he scrambled to get up, his hand fell upon his pickaxe, and before the horrid beasts could do him any serious harm, he was laying about with it right and left in the dark. The hideous cries which followed gave him the satisfaction of knowing that he had punished some of them pretty smartly for their rudeness, and by their scampering and their retreating howls, he perceived that he had routed them. He stood a little, weighing his battle-axe in his hand as if it had been the most precious lump of metal--but indeed no lump of gold itself could have been so precious at that time as that common tool--then untied the end of the string from it, put the ball in his pocket, and still stood thinking. It was clear that the cobs' creatures had found his axe, had between them carried it off, and had so led him he knew not where. But for all his thinking he could not tell what he ought to do, until suddenly he became aware of a glimmer of light in the distance. Without a moment's hesitation he set out for it, as fast as the unknown and rugged way would permit. Yet again turning a corner, led by the dim light, he spied something quite new in his experience of the underground regions--a small irregular shape of something shining. Going up to it, he found it was a piece of mica, or Muscovy glass, called sheep-silver in Scotland, and the light flickering as if from a fire behind it. After trying in vain for some time to discover an entrance to the place where it was burning, he came at length to a small chamber in which an opening high in the wall revealed a glow beyond. To this opening he managed to scramble up, and then he saw a strange sight.",night dodg listen fall asleep weariness begin roll ball resolve go bed long begin feel bewilder pass goblin house cave occupy goblin family length sure many more pass come have use great caution pass unseen lay string lead wrong follow wind lead populate quarter become uneasy apprehensive afraid _cobs_ afraid find way do use sit wait morning morning make difference dark dark string fail helpless arrive yard know see do good least find end string possible come play trick know size ball get last begin feel tug pull mean turn sharp corner think hear strange sound grow go scuffling growling squeaking noise increase turn second sharp corner find midst same moment tumble wallow mass know knot cob creature recover foot catch great scratch face several severe bite leg arm scramble get hand fall pickaxe horrid beast do serious harm lay leave dark hideous cry follow give satisfaction know punish rudeness scampering retreating howl perceive rout stand little weigh battle axe hand precious lump metal lump gold precious time common tool unty end string put ball pocket stand think clear cob creature find axe have carry lead know thinking tell do become aware glimmer light distance moment hesitation set unknown rugged way permit turn corner lead dim light spy new experience underground region small irregular shape shine go find piece mica glass call sheep silver light flicker fire try vain time discover entrance place burn come length small chamber opening high wall reveal glow opening manage scramble see strange sight 
4,"Below sat a little group of goblins around a fire, the smoke of which vanished in the darkness far aloft. The sides of the cave were full of shining minerals like those of the palace-hall; and the company was evidently of a superior order, for every one wore stones about head, or arms, or waist, shining, dull, gorgeous colors in the light of the fire. Nor had Curdie looked long before he recognized the king himself, and found that he had made his way into the inner apartment of the royal family. He had never had such a good chance of hearing something! He crept through the hole as softly as he could, scrambled a good way down the wall toward them without attracting attention, and then sat down and listened. The king, evidently the queen, and probably the crown-prince and the prime minister were talking together. He was sure of the queen by her shoes, for as she warmed her feet at the fire, he saw them quite plainly.",sit little group goblin fire smoke vanish darkness side cave full shine mineral palace hall company superior order one wear stone head arm waist shine dull gorgeous color light fire look recognize king find make way inner apartment royal family have good chance hear creep hole scramble good way wall attract attention sit listen king queen crown prince prime minister talk sure queen shoe warm foot fire see

12,"""You must acknowledge, however,"" the king said, with a little groan, ""that this at least is no whim of Harelip's, but a matter of state-policy. You are well aware that his gratification comes purely from the pleasure of sacrificing himself to the public good. Does it not, Harelip?""",acknowledge king say little groan least whim matter state policy aware gratification come pleasure sacrifice public good 
13,"""Yes, father; of course it does. Only it _will_ be nice to make her cry. I'll have the skin taken off between her toes, and tie them up till they grow together. Then her feet will be like other people's, and there will be no occasion for her to wear shoes.""",father course nice make cry have skin take toe tie grow foot other person be occasion wear shoe 
14,"""Do you mean to insinuate _I've_ got toes, you unnatural wretch?"" cried the queen; and she moved angrily toward Harelip. The councilor, however, who was betwixt them, leaned forward so as to prevent her touching him, but only as if to address the prince.",mean insinuate get toe unnatural wretch cry queen move councilor betwixt learn prevent touch address prince

19,"""Ha! ha! ha!"" laughed the queen, louder than before, and the king and the minister joined in the laugh. It was anything but a laughing matter to Harelip. He growled, and for a few moments the others continued to express their enjoyment of his discomfiture.",laugh queen louder king minister join laugh laugh matter growl few moment other continue express enjoyment discomfiture 
20,"The queen was the only one Curdie could see with any distinctness. She sat sideways to him, and the light of the fire shone full upon her face. He could not consider her handsome. Her nose was certainly broader at the end than its extreme length, and her eyes, instead of being horizontal, were set up like two perpendicular eggs, one on the broad, the other on the small, end. Her mouth was no bigger than a small buttonhole until she laughed, when it stretched from ear to ear--only to be sure her ears were very nearly in the middle of her cheeks.",queen only one see distinctness sit light fire shine full face consider handsome nose broad end extreme length eye horizontal set perpendicular egg broad other small end mouth big small buttonhole laugh stretch ear ear sure ear middle cheek 
21,"Anxious to hear everything they might say, Curdie ventured to slide down a smooth part of the rock just under him, to a projection below, upon which he thought to rest. But whether he was not careful enough, or the projection gave way, down he came with a rush on the floor of the cavern, bringing with him a great rumbling shower of stones.",anxious hear say venture slide smooth part rock projection think rest careful projection give way come rush floor cavern bring great rumble shower stone 
22,"The goblins jumped from their seats in more anger than consternation, for they had never yet seen anything to be afraid of in the palace. But when they saw Curdie with his pick in his hand, their rage was mingled with fear, for they took him for the first of an invasion of miners. The king notwithstanding drew himself up to his full height of four feet, spread himself to his full breadth of three and a half, for he was the handsomest and squarest of all the goblins, and strutting up to Curdie, planted himself with outspread feet before him, and said with dignity--",goblin jump seat more anger consternation see afraid palace see pick hand rage mingle fear take first invasion miner king notwithstand draw full height foot spread full breadth half handsomest squarest goblin strutt plant outspread foot say dignity

35,"""One will be quite sufficient,"" said Curdie.",sufficient say 
36,"But the king uttered a strange shout, half halloo, half roar, and in rushed goblins till the cave was swarming. He said something to the first of them which Curdie could not hear, and it was passed from one to another till in a moment the farthest in the crowd had evidently heard and understood it. They began to gather about him in a way he did not relish, and he retreated toward the wall. They pressed upon him.",king utter strange shout half halloo half roar rush goblin cave swarm say first hear pass moment farthest crowd hear understand begin gather way relish retreat wall press

43,"The goblins fell back a little when he began, and made horrible grimaces all through the rhyme, as if eating something so disagreeable that it set their teeth on edge and gave them the creeps; but whether it was that the rhyming words were most of them no words at all, for a new rhyme being considered more efficacious, Curdie had made it on the spur of the moment, or whether it was that the presence of the king and queen gave them courage, I cannot tell; but the moment the rhyme was over, they crowded on him again, and out shot a hundred long arms, with a multitude of thick nailless fingers at the end of them, to lay hold upon him. Then Curdie heaved up his axe. But being as gentle as courageous and not wishing to kill any of them, he turned the end which was square and blunt like a hammer, and with that came down a great blow on the head of the goblin nearest him. Hard as the heads of all goblins are, he thought he must feel that. And so he did, no doubt; but he only gave a horrible cry, and sprung at Curdie's throat. Curdie however drew back in time, and just at that critical moment, remembered the vulnerable part of the goblin-body. He made a sudden rush at the king, and stamped with all his might on his Majesty's feet. The king gave a most unkingly howl, and almost fell into the fire. Curdie then rushed into the crowd, stamping right and left. The goblins drew back howling on every side as he approached, but they were so crowded that few of those he attacked could escape his tread; and the shrieking and roaring that filled the cave would have appalled Curdie, but for the good hope it gave him. They were tumbling over each other in heaps in their eagerness to rush from the cave, when a new assailant suddenly faced him:--the queen, with flaming eyes and expanded nostrils, her hair standing half up from her head, rushed at him. She trusted in her shoes; they were of granite--hollowed like French _sabots_. Curdie would have endured much rather than hurt a woman, even if she was a goblin; but here was an affair of life and death: forgetting her shoes, he made a great stamp on one of her feet. But she instantly returned it with very different effect, causing him frightful pain and almost disabling him. His only chance with her would have been to attack the granite shoes with his pickaxe, but before he could think of that, she had caught him up in her arms, and was rushing with him across the cave. She dashed him into a hole in the wall, with a force that almost stunned him. But although he could not move, he was not too far gone to hear her great cry, and the rush of multitudes of soft feet, followed by the sounds of something heaved up against the rock; after which came a multitudinous patter of stones falling near him. The last had not ceased when he grew very faint, for his head had been badly cut, and at last insensible.",goblin fall little begin make horrible grimace rhyme eat disagreeable set tooth edge give creep rhyming word most word new rhyme consider efficacious make spur moment presence king queen give courage tell moment rhyme crowd shoot long arm multitude thick nailless finger end lay hold heave axe gentle courageous wish kill turn end square blunt hammer come great blow head goblin near hard head goblin think feel doubt give horrible cry spring throat draw time critical moment remember vulnerable part goblin body make sudden rush king stamp foot king give unkingly howl fall fire rush crowd stamp left goblin draw howl side approach crowded few attack escape tread shrieking roaring fill cave appall good hope give tumble other heap eagerness rush cave new assailant face queen flame eye expand nostril hair stand half head rush trust shoe granite hollow french endure much hurt woman goblin affair life death forget shoe make great stamp foot return different effect cause frightful pain disabl only chance attack granite shoe pickaxe think catch arm rush cave dash hole wall force stunn move go hear great cry rush multitude soft foot follow sound heave rock come multitudinous patter stone fall last cease grow faint head cut last insensible 
44,"When he came to himself, there was perfect silence about him, and utter darkness, but for the merest glimmer in one tiny spot. He crawled to it, and found that they had heaved a slab against the mouth of the hole, past the edge of which a poor little gleam found its way from the fire. He could not move it a hair's breadth, for they had piled a great heap of stones against it. He crawled back to where he had been lying, in the faint hope of finding his pickaxe. But after a vain search, he was at last compelled to acknowledge himself in an evil plight. He sat down and tried to think, but soon fell fast asleep.",come be perfect silence utter darkness merest glimmer tiny spot crawl find heave slab mouth hole edge poor little gleam find way fire move hair breadth pile great heap stone crawl lie faint hope find pickaxe vain search last compel acknowledge evil plight sit try think fall asleep
