3,"After prayers the next morning Dr. Rowlands spoke to his boarders on the previous day's discovery, and in a few forcible vivid words set before them, the enormity of the offence. He ended by announcing that the boys who were caught would be birched,--""except the elder ones, Bull and Brigson, who will bring me one hundred lines every hour of the half-holidays till further notice. There are some,"" he said, ""I am well aware, who, though present yesterday, were not detected. I am sorry for it, for _their_ sakes; they will be more likely to sin again. In cases like this, punishment is a blessing, and impunity a burden."" On leaving the room he bade Eric follow him into his study. Eric obeyed, and stood before the head-master with downcast eyes.",prayer next morning speak border previous day discovery few forcible vivid word set enormity offence end announce boy catch birch elder one bring line hour half holiday further notice be say aware present yesterday detect sorry sake likely sin case punishment blessing impunity burden leave room bid follow study obey stand head master downcast eye 
4,"""Williams,"" he said, ""I have had a great regard for you, and felt a deep interest in you from the day I first saw you, and knew your excellent parents. At one time I had conceived great hopes of your future course, and your abilities seemed likely to blossom into noble fruit. But you fell off greatly, and grew idle and careless. At last an event happened, in which for a time you acted worthily of yourself, and which seemed to arouse you from your negligence and indifference. All my hopes in you revived; but as I continued to watch your course (more closely, perhaps, than you supposed), I observed with pain that those hopes must be again disappointed. It needs but a glance at your countenance to be sure that you are not so upright or right-minded a boy as you were two years ago. I can judge only from your outward course; but I deeply fear, Williams, I deeply fear, that in _other_ respects also you are going the down-hill road. And what am I to think now, when on the _same_ morning, you and your little brother _both_ come before me for such serious and heavy faults? I cannot free you from blame even for _his_ misdoings, for you are his natural guardian here; I am only glad that you were not involved with him in that charge.""",say have great regard feel deep interest day see know excellent parent time conceive great hope future course ability seem likely blossom noble fruit fall grow idle careless last event happen time act seem arouse negligence indifference hope revive continue watch course suppose observe pain hope disappoint need glance countenance sure upright right minded boy year judge outward course fear fear _other_ respect go hill road think _same_ morning little brother come such serious heavy fault free blame _his_ misdoing natural guardian glad involve charge

11,"Eric, with trembling hand, wrote his apology, and Dr Rowlands glanced at it. ""Come to me again at twelve,"" he said.",tremble hand write apology glance come say 
12,"At twelve all the school were assembled, and Eric, pale and miserable, followed the Doctor into the great school-room. The masters stood at one end of the room, and among them Mr. Rose, who, however, appeared an indifferent and uninterested spectator of the transaction. Every eye was fixed on Eric, and every one pitied him.",school assemble pale miserable follow doctor great school room master stand end room appear indifferent uninterested spectator transaction eye fix one pity 
13,"""We are assembled,"" said Dr. Rowlands, ""for an act of justice. One of your number has insulted a master publicly, and is ashamed of his conduct, and has himself written the apology which he will read. I had intended to add a still severer punishment, but Mr. Rose has earnestly begged me not to do so, and I have succumbed to his wishes. Williams, read your apology.""",assemble say act justice number insult master ashamed conduct write apology read intend add severer punishment begg do succumb wish read apology

At last, by a spasmodic effort, he regained his voice, and read, but in so low and nervous a tone, that not even those nearest him heard what he was saying.",be dead hush try vain utter word last spasmodic effort regain voice read low nervous tone near hear say 
15,"Dr. Rowlands took the paper from him. ""Owing,"" he said, ""to a very natural and pardonable emotion, the apology has been read in such a way that you could not have understood it. I will therefore read it myself. It is to this effect--",take paper owe say natural pardonable emotion apology read way understand read effect

18,"They left the room and dispersed, and Eric fancied that all shunned and looked coldly on his degradation But not so: Montagu came, and taking his arm in the old friendly way, went a walk with him. It was a constrained and silent walk, and they were both glad when it was over, although Montagu did all he could to show that he loved Eric no less than before. Still it was weeks since they had been much together, and they had far fewer things in common now than they used to have.",leave room disperse fancy shunn look degradation come take arm old friendly way go walk constrain silent walk glad do show love less week have few thing common use have

23,"They reached the school-door, and Eric went straight to the library. Mr. Rose was there alone. He received him kindly, as usual, and Eric went up to the fire-place where he was standing. They had often stood by that library fire on far different terms.",reach school door go library receive usual go fire place stand stand library fire different term 
24,"""Forgive me, sir,"" was all Eric could say, as the tears rushed to his eyes.",forgive sir say tear rush eye 
25,"""Freely, my boy,"" said Mr. Rose, sadly. ""I wish you could feel how fully I forgive you; but,"" he added, laying his hand for the last time on Eric's head, ""you have far more, Eric, to forgive yourself.

27,"Alas for gratitude! there was not a boy in that group to whom Mr. Rose had not done many an act of kindness; and to most of them far more than they ever knew. Many a weary hour had he toiled for them in private, when his weak frame was harassed by suffering; many a sleepless night had he wrestled for them in prayer, when, for their sakes, his own many troubles were laid aside. Work on, Walter Rose, and He who seeth in secret will reward you openly! but expect no gratitude from those for whose salvation you, like the great tenderhearted apostle, would almost be ready to wish yourself accursed.",gratitude be boy group do many act kindness most more know many weary hour toil private weak frame harass suffer many sleepless night wrestle prayer sake own many trouble lay work seeth secret reward expect gratitude salvation great tenderhearted apostle ready wish accurse 
28,"Nearly every one in that noisy group was abusing Mr. Rose. It had long been Brigson's cue to do so; he derided him on every opportunity, and delighted to represent him as hypocritical and insincere. Even his weak health was the subject of Brigson's coarse ridicule, and the bad boy paid, in deep hatred, the natural tribute which vice must ever accord to excellence.",one noisy group abuse cue do deride opportunity delight represent hypocritical insincere weak health subject coarse ridicule bad boy pay deep hatred natural tribute vice accord excellence

35,"""I say, you fellows,"" remonstrated Wright, who, with Vernon, was sitting reading a book at one of the desks, ""all that isn't fair.

50,"First two or three more offered, and then a whole lot, gaining courage by numbers. So the plot was regularly laid. Pietrie and Graham were to put out the lights at each end of one table immediately after tea, and Wildney and Brooking at the other, when the study fellows had gone out. There would then be only Mr. Rose's candle burning, and the two middle candles, which, in so large a room, would just give enough light for their purpose. Then all the conspirators were to throng around the door, and from it aim their crusts at Mr. Rose's head, Not nearly so many would have volunteered to join, but that they fancied Mr. Rose was too gentle to take up the matter with vigor, and they were encouraged by his quiet leniency towards Eric the night before. It was agreed that no study-boy should be told of the intention, lest any of them should interfere.",offer whole lot gain courage number plot lay put light end table tea other study fellow go be candle burning middle candle large room give enough light purpose conspirator throng door aim crust head many volunteer join fancy gentle take matter vigor encourage quiet leniency night agree study boy tell intention interfere 
51,"Many hearts beat fast at tea that night as they observed that numbers of boys, instead of eating all their bread, were cutting off the crusts, and breaking them into good-sized bits.",many heart beat tea night observe number boy eat bread cut crust break good sized bit 
52,"Tea finished, Mr. Rose said grace, and then sat down quietly reading in his desk. The signal agreed on was the (accidental) dropping of a plate by Brigson. The study-boys left the room.",tea finish say grace sit read desk signal agree accidental drop plate study boy leave room

55,"""Now then,"" said Brigson, in a loud whisper, ""what a funky set you are! Here goes?""",say loud whisper funky set go 
56,"The master, surprised at the sudden gloom and confusion, had just looked up, unable to conjecture what was the matter. Brigson's crust caught him a sharp rap on the forehead as he moved.",master surprise sudden gloom confusion look unable conjecture matter crust catch sharp rap forehead move 
57,"In an instant he started up, and ten or twelve more crusts flew by or hit him on the head, as he strode out of the desk towards the door. Directly he stirred, there was a rush of boys into the passage, and if he had once lost his judgment or temper, worse harm might have followed. But he did not. Going to the door, he said, ""Preparation will be in five minutes; every boy not then in his place will be punished.""",instant start more crust fly hit head strode desk door stirr be rush boy passage lose judgment temper bad harm follow go door say preparation minute boy place punish 
58,"During that five minutes the servants had cleared away the tea, full of wonder; but Mr. Rose paced up and down the room, taking no notice of any one. Immediately after, all the boys were in their places, with their books open before them, and in the thrilling silence you might have heard a pin drop. Every one felt that Mr. Rose was master of the occasion, and awaited his next step in terrified suspense.",minute servant clear tea full wonder pace room take notice one boy place book open thrilling silence hear pin drop one feel master occasion await next step terrified suspense 
59,"They all perceived how thoroughly they had mistaken their subject. The ringleaders would have given all they had to be well out of the scrape. Mr. Rose ruled by kindness, but he never suffered his will to be disputed for an instant. He governed with such consummate tact, that they hardly felt it to be government at all, and hence arose their stupid miscalculation. But he felt that the time was now come to assert his paramount authority, and determined to do so at once and for ever.",perceive mistaken subject ringleader give have scrape rule kindness suffer will dispute instant govern such consummate tact feel government arise stupid miscalculation feel time come assert paramount authority determined do 
60,"""Some of you have mistaken me,"" he said, in a voice so strong and stern that it almost startled them. ""The silly display of passion in one boy yesterday has led you to presume that you may trifle with me. You are wrong. For Williams' sake, as a boy who has, or at least once _had_, something noble in him, I left that matter in the Doctor's hands. I shall _not_ do so to-night.

I shall now _ask_ all the rest, one by one, if they took any part in this. And beware of telling me a lie.""",know many boy guilty see part room throw impossible _ask rest take part beware tell lie 
66,"There was an uneasy sensation in the room, and several boys began to whisper aloud, ""Brigson! Brigson!"" The whisper grew louder, and Mr. Rose heard it. He turned on Brigson like a lion, and said--",be uneasy sensation room several boy begin whisper whisper grow louder hear turn lion say 
67,"""They call your name; stand out!""",call name stand 
68,"The awkward, big, ungainly boy, with his repulsive countenance, shambled out of his place into the middle of the room. Mr. Rose swept him with one flashing glance. ""_That_ is the boy,"" thought he to himself, ""who has been like an ulcer to this school. These boys shall have a good look at their hero."" It was but recently that Mr. Rose knew all the harm which Brigson had been doing, though he had discovered, almost from the first, what _sort_ of character he had.",awkward big ungainly boy repulsive countenance shamble place middle room sweep flash glance boy think ulcer school boy have good look hero know harm do discover first _sort_ character have 
69,"So Brigson stood out in the room, and as they looked at him, many a boy cursed him in their hearts for evil taught them, such as a lifetime's struggle could not unteach. And it was _that_ fellow, that stupid, clumsy, base compound of meanness and malice, that had ruled like a king among them.

73,"""You have told me a lie!"" said Mr. Rose, slowly, and with ineffable contempt. ""No words can express my loathing for your false and dishonorable conduct. Nor shall your lie save you, as you shall find immediately. Still, you shall escape if you can or dare to deny it again. I repeat my question--Were you engaged in this?""",tell lie say ineffable contempt word express loathing false dishonorable conduct lie save find escape dare deny repeat question engage

77,"""Were you one of those who threw?""",throw 
78,"Wildney, full as he was of dangerous and deadly faults, was no coward, and not a liar. He knew, or at least feared, that this new scrape might be fatal to him, but, raising his dark and glistening eyes to Mr. Rose, he said penitently--",full dangerous deadly fault coward liar know least fear new scrape fatal raise dark glisten eye say

81,"""Good! stand back. Pietrie, come up.""",good stand come

99,"Corporal punishment was avoided with the bigger boys, and Brigson had never undergone it before. At the first stroke he writhed and yelled; at the second he retreated, twisting like a serpent, and blubbering like a baby; at the third he flung himself on his knees, and, as the strokes fell fast, clasped Mr. Rose's arm, and implored and besought for mercy.",corporal punishment avoid big boy undergone first stroke writh yell second retreat twist serpent blubber baby third flung knee stroke fall clasp arm implore besig mercy 
100,"""_Miserable_ coward,"" said Mr. Rose, throwing into the word such ringing scorn that no one who heard it ever forgot it. He indignantly shook the boy off, and caned him till he rolled on the floor, losing every particle of self-control, and calling out, ""The devil--the devil--the devil!""

A long catalogue of sins is visited on you to-day, and not only on your shrinking body, but on your conscience too, if you have one left. Let those red marks betoken that your reign is ended. Liar and tempter, you have led boys into the sins which you then meanly deny!

103,"Trembling violently, and cowed beyond description, he did as he was bid.

106,"But, as he had said, Brigson's reign was over. Looks of the most unmitigated disgust and contempt were darted at him, as he sat alone and shunned at the end of the table; and the boys seemed now to loathe and nauseate the golden calf they had been worshipping. He had not done blubbering even yet, when the prayer-bell rang. No sooner had Mr. Rose left the room than Wildney, his dark eyes sparkling with rage, leaped on the table, and shouted--",say reign look unmitigated disgust contempt dart sit shunn end table boy seem loathe nauseate golden calf worshipp do blubbering prayer bell ring have leave room dark eye sparkling rage leap table shout

The news had spread like wildfire to the studies, and the other boys came flocking in during the uproar, to join in it heartily.

112,"But Mr. Rose, in the library, was on his knees, with moving lips and lifted hands. He coveted the popular applause as little as he had dreaded the popular opposition; and the evening's painful experiences had taught him anew the bitter lesson to expect no gratitude, and hope for no reward, but simply, and contentedly, and unmurmuringly, to work on in God's vineyard so long as life and health should last.",library knee move lip lift hand covete popular applause little dread popular opposition evening painful experience teach bitter lesson expect gratitude hope reward work vineyard life health last 
113,"Brigson's brazen forehead bore him through the disgrace which would have crushed another. But still he felt that his position at Roslyn could never be what it had been before, and he therefore determined to leave at once. By grossly calumniating the school, he got his father to remove him, and announced, to every one's great delight, that he was going in a fortnight. On his last day, by way of bravado, he smashed and damaged as much of the school property as he could, a proceeding which failed to gain him any admiration, and merely put his father to ruinous expense.",brazen forehead bear disgrace crush feel position determine leave calumniate school get father remove announce one great delight go fortnight last day way bravado smash damage much school property proceeding fail gain admiration put father ruinous expense
