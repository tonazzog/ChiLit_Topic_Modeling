1,CHAPTER XXX.,xxx 
2," The party had proceeded many miles before they arrived at the spot where Malachi thought that they would fall in with some venison, which was the principal game that they sought. It was not till near ten o'clock in the morning that they stood on the ground which had been selected for the sport. It was an open part of the forest, and the snow lay in large drifts, but here and there on the hill-sides the grass was nearly bare, and the deer were able, by scraping with their feet, to obtain some food. They were all pretty well close together when they arrived. Percival and Henry were about a quarter of a mile behind, for Percival was not used to the snow-shoes, and did not get on so well as the others. Malachi and the rest with him halted, that Henry and Percival might come up with them, and then, after they had recovered their breath a little, he said,",party proceed many mile arrive spot think fall venison principal game seek o'clock morning stand ground select sport open part forest snow lay large drift hill side grass bare deer able scrape foot obtain food close arrive quarter mile use snow shoe get other rest halt come recover breath little say 
3,"""Now, you see there's a fine lot of deer here, Master Percival, but as you know nothing about woodcraft, and may put us all out, observe what I say to you. The animals are not only cute of hearing and seeing, but they are more cute of smell, and they can scent a man a mile off if the wind blows down to them; so you see it would be useless to attempt to get near to them if we do not get to the lee side of them without noise and without being seen. Now, the wind has been from the eastward, and as we are to the southward, we must get round by the woods to the westward, before we go upon the open ground, and then, Master Percival, you must do as we do, and keep behind, to watch our motions. If we come to a swell in the land, you must not run up, or even walk up, as you might show yourself; the deer might be on the other side, within twenty yards of you; but you must hide yourself, as you will see that we shall do, and when we have found them, I will put you in a place where you shall have your shot as well as we. Do you understand, Master Percival?""",see be fine lot deer know woodcraft put observe say animal cute hear see cute smell scent man mile wind blow see useless attempt get get side noise see wind eastward southward get wood westward go open ground do do keep watch motion come swell land run walk show deer other side yard hide see do find put place have shot understand 
4,"""Yes, I do, and I shall stop behind, and do as you tell me.""",stop do tell 
5,"""Well then, now, we will go back into the thick of the forest till we go to the leeward, and then we shall see whether you will make a hunter or not.""",go thick forest go leeward see make hunter 
6,"The whole party did as Malachi directed, and for more than an hour they walked through the wood, among the thickest of the trees, that they might not be seen by the animals. At last they arrived at the spot which Malachi desired, and then they changed their course eastward toward the more open ground, where they expected to find the deer.",whole party direct more hour walk wood thickest tree see animal last arrive spot desire change course open ground expect find deer 
7,"As they entered upon the open ground, they moved forward crouched to the ground, Malachi and Martin in the advance. When in the hollows, they all collected together, but on ascending a swell of the land, it was either Malachi or Martin who first crept up, and, looking over the summit, gave notice to the others to come forward. This was continually repeated for three or four miles, when Martin having raised his head just above a swell, made a signal to those who were below that the deer were in sight. After a moment or two reconnoitering, he went down and informed them that there were twelve or thirteen head of deer scraping up the snow about one hundred yards ahead of them upon another swell of the land; but that they appeared to be alarmed and anxious, as if they had an idea of danger being near.",enter open ground move crouch ground advance hollow collect ascend swell land creep look summit give notice other come repeat mile raise head swell make signal deer sight moment reconnoitering go inform be head deer scrape snow yard swell land appear alarm anxious have idea danger 
8,"Malachi then again crawled up to make his observations, and returned.",crawl make observation return 
9,"""It is sartin,"" said he, ""that they are flurried about something; they appear just as if they had been hunted, and yet that is not likely. We must wait and let them settle a little, and find out whether any other parties have been hunting them.""",sartin say flurry appear hunt likely wait let settle little find other party hunt 
10,"They waited about ten minutes, till the animals appeared more settled, and then, by altering their position behind the swell, gained about twenty-five yards of distance. Malachi told each party which animal to aim at, and they fired nearly simultaneously. Three of the beasts fell, two others were wounded, the rest of the herd bounded off like the wind. They all rose from behind the swell, and ran forward to their prey. Alfred had fired at a fine buck which stood apart from the rest, and somewhat further off; it was evident that the animal was badly wounded, and Alfred had marked the thicket into which it had floundered; but the other deer which was wounded was evidently slightly hurt, and there was little chance of obtaining it, as it bounded away after the rest of the herd. They all ran up to where the animals lay dead, and as soon as they had reloaded their rifles, Alfred and Martin went on the track of the one that was badly wounded. They had forced their way through the thicket for some fifty yards, guided by the track of the animal, when they started back at the loud growl of some beast. Alfred, who was in advance, perceived that a puma (catamount, or painter, as it is usually termed) had taken possession of the deer, and was lying over the carcass. He leveled his rifle and fired; the beast, although badly wounded, immediately sprang at him and seized him by the shoulder. Alfred was sinking under the animal's weight and from the pain he was suffering, when Martin came to his rescue, and put his rifle ball through the head of the beast, which fell dead.",wait minute animal appear settle alter position swell gain yard distance tell party animal aim fire beast fall other wound rest herd bound wind rise swell run prey fire fine buck stand rest evident animal wound mark thicket flounder other deer wound hurt be little chance obtain bound rest herd run animal lay dead reload rifle go track one wound force way thicket yard guide track animal start loud growl beast advance perceive puma catamount painter term take possession deer lie carcass level rifle fire beast wound spring seize shoulder sink animal weight pain suffer come rescue put rifle ball head beast fall dead 
11,"""Are you much hurt, sir?"" said Martin.",hurt sir say 
12,"""No, not much,"" replied Alfred; ""at least I think not, but my shoulder is badly torn, and I bleed freely.""",much reply least think shoulder torn ble 
13,"Malachi and the others now came up, and perceived what had taken place. Alfred had sunk down and was sitting on the ground by the side of the dead animals.",other come perceive take place sink sit ground side dead animal 
14,"""A painter!"" exclaimed Malachi; ""well, I didn't think we should see one so far west. Are you hurt, Mr. Alfred?""",painter exclaim think see hurt 
15,"""Yes, a little,"" replied Alfred, faintly.",little reply 
16,"Malachi and Martin, without saying another word, stripped off Alfred's hunting-coat, and then discovered that he had received a very bad wound in the shoulder from the teeth of the beast, and that his side was also torn by the animal's claws.",say word stripp hunting coat discover receive bad wound shoulder tooth beast side tear animal claw 
17,"""John, run for some water,"" said Malachi; ""you are certain to find some in the hollow.""",run water say certain find hollow 
18,"John and Percival both hastened in search of water, while Malachi and Martin and Henry tore Alfred's shirt into strips and bound up the wounds, so as to stop in a great measure the flow of blood. As soon as this was done and he had drunk the water brought to him in John's hat, Alfred felt revived.",hasten search water tore shirt strip bind wound stop great measure flow blood do drink water bring hat feel revive 
19,"""I will sit down for a little longer,"" said he, ""and then we will get home as fast as we can. Martin, look after the game, and when you are ready I will get up. What a tremendous heavy brute that was; I could not have stood against him for a minute longer, and I had no hunting-knife.""",sit little say get look game ready get tremendous heavy brute stand minute have hunting knife 
20,"""It's a terrible beast, sir,"" replied Malachi. ""I don't know that I ever saw one larger; they are more than a match for one man, sir, and never should be attempted single-handed, for they are so hard to kill.""",terrible beast sir reply know see large more match man sir attempt single handed hard kill 
21,"""Where did my ball hit him?"" said Alfred.",ball hit say 
22,"""Here, sir, under the shoulder, and well placed too. It must have gone quite close to his heart; but unless you hit them through the brain or through the heart, they are certain to make their dying spring. That's an ugly wound on your shoulder, and will put a stop to your hunting for five or six weeks, I expect. However, it's well that it's no worse.""",sir shoulder place go close heart hit brain heart certain make die spring ugly wound shoulder put stop hunting week expect bad 
23,"""I feel quite strong now,"" replied Alfred.",feel strong reply 
24,"""Another ten minutes, sir; let John and me whip off his skin, for we must have it to show, if we have all the venison spoiled. Mr. Henry, tell Martin only to take the prime pieces, and not to mind the hides, for we shall not be able to carry much. And tell him to be quick, Mr. Henry, for it will not do for Mr. Alfred to remain till his arm gets stiff. We have many miles to get home again.""",minute sir let whip skin have show have venison spoiled tell take prime piece mind hide able carry much tell quick do remain arm get stiff have many mile get 
25,"In the course of ten minutes Malachi and John had skinned the puma, and Martin made his appearance with the haunches of two of the deer, which, he said, was as much as they well could carry, and they all set off on their return home.",course minute skinned puma make appearance haunch deer say much carry set return 
26,"Alfred had not proceeded far when he found himself in great pain, the walking upon snow-shoes requiring so much motion as to open the wounds and make them bleed again; but Malachi gave him his assistance, and having procured him some more water they continued their route.",proceed find great pain walking snow shoe require much motion open wound make ble give assistance procure more water continue route 
27,"After a time the wounds became more stiff, and Alfred appeared to be more oppressed by the pain. They proceeded, however, as fast as they could, and at nightfall they were not far from home. But Alfred moved with great difficulty; he had become very faint, so much so, that Martin requested John would put down the venison and hasten before them to the house to request Mr. Campbell to send some brandy or other cordial to support Alfred, who was scarcely able to move on from weakness and loss of blood. As they were not more than a mile from the house, John was soon there, and hastening in at the door, he gave his message in presence of Mrs. Campbell and his cousins, who were in a state of great distress at the intelligence. Mr. Campbell went to his room for the spirits, and as soon as he brought it out Emma seized her bonnet, and said that she would accompany John.",time wound become stiff appear oppress pain proceed nightfall home move great difficulty become faint request put venison hast house request send brandy other cordial support able move weakness loss blood more mile house hasten door give message presence cousin state great distress intelligence go room spirit bring seize bonnet say accompany 
28,"Mr. and Mrs. Campbell had no time to raise any objection, if they were inclined, for Emma was out of the door in a moment, with John at her heels. But Emma quite forgot that she had no snow shoes, and before she had gone half the distance she found herself as much fatigued as if she had walked miles; and she sank deeper and deeper in the snow every step that she advanced. At last they arrived, and found the party: Alfred was lying insensible on the snow, and the others making a litter of branches that they might carry him to the house.",have time raise objection inclined door moment heel forget have snow shoe go distance find fatigued walk mile sink deep deep snow step advance last arrive find party lie insensible snow other make litter branch carry house 
29,"A little brandy poured down his throat brought Alfred to his senses; and as he opened his eyes, he perceived Emma hanging over him.",little brandy pour throat bring sense open eye perceive hang 
30,"""Dear Emma, how kind of you,"" said he, attempting to rise.",dear kind say attempt rise 
31,"""Do not move, Alfred; they will soon have the litter ready, and then you will be carried to the house. It is not far off.""",move have litter ready carry house 
32,"""I am strong again now, Emma,"" replied Alfred. ""But you must not remain here in the cold. See, the snow is falling again.""",strong reply remain cold see snow fall 
33,"""I must remain now till they are ready to carry you, Alfred, for I dare not go back by myself.""",remain ready carry go 
34,"By this time the litter was prepared, and Alfred placed on it. Malachi, Henry, Martin and John took it up.",time litter prepare place take 
35,"""Where is Percival?"" said Emma.",say 
36,"""He's behind a little way,"" replied John. ""The snow-shoes hurt him, and he could not walk so fast. He will be here in a minute.""",little way reply snow shoe hurt walk minute 
37,"They carried Alfred to the house, where Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Mary were waiting at the door in great anxiety; poor Emma was quite knocked up by the time that they arrived, and went into her own room.",carry house wait door great anxiety poor knock time arrive go own room 
38,"Alfred was laid on his bed, and his father then examined his wounds, which he considered very dangerous, from the great laceration of the flesh. Mr. Campbell dressed them, and then they left Alfred to the repose which he so much required. The state of Alfred so occupied their minds and their attention, that nothing and nobody else was thought of for the first hour. Emma, too, had been taken very ill soon after she came in, and required the attention of Mrs. Campbell and Mary. It was not until they were about to sit down to supper that Mr. Campbell said, ""Why, where's Percival?""",lay bed father examine wound consider dangerous great laceration flesh dress leave repose require state occupy mind attention else think first hour take ill come require attention about sit supper say 
39,"""Percival! Is he not here?"" was the question anxiously uttered by all the party who had been hunting.",question utter party hunt 
40,"""Percival not here!"" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell, starting up. ""Where--where is my child?""",exclaim start child 
41,"""He was just behind us,"" said John; ""he sat down to alter his snow-shoes; the ties hurt him.""",say sit alter snow shoe tie hurt 
42,"Malachi and Martin ran out of doors in consternation; they knew the danger, for the snow was now falling in such heavy flakes that it was impossible to see or direct their steps two yards in any direction.",run door consternation know danger snow fall such heavy flake impossible see direct step yard direction 
43,"""The boy will be lost for sartin,"" said Malachi to Martin; ""if he has remained behind till this fall of snow, he never will find his way, but wander about till he perishes.""",boy lose sartin say remain fall snow find way wander perish 
44,"""Yes,"" said Martin, ""he has but a poor chance, that is the truth; I would have given my right arm this had not happened.""",say have poor chance truth give right arm happen 
45,"""Misfortune never comes single,"" replied Malachi; ""what can we do? Madam Campbell will be beside herself, for she loves that boy beyond all measure.""",misfortune come single reply do love boy measure 
46,"""It's useless our going out,"" observed Martin; ""we should never find him, and only lose ourselves; but still we had better go back, and say that we will try. At all events we can go to the edge of the forest, and halloo every minute or so; if the boy is still on his legs, it will guide him to us.""",useless go observe find lose good go say try event go edge forest halloo minute boy leg guide 
47,"""Yes,"" replied Malachi, ""and we may light a pine torch; it might be of some use. Well, then, let's go in, and tell them that we are going in search of the boy; as long as madam knows that we are seeking him she will not lose hope, and hope will keep up her spirits for the time, till she is better prepared for her loss.""",reply light pine torch use let go tell go search boy madam know seek lose hope hope keep spirit time prepare loss 
48,"There was much good sense and knowledge of the human heart in the observation of Malachi, who, although he was aware that all search would be useless, could not resolve to destroy at once all hope in the mind of the afflicted and anxious mother.",be much good sense knowledge human heart observation aware search useless resolve destroy hope mind afflict anxious mother 
49,"They went in, and found Mrs. Campbell weeping bitterly, supported by her husband and Mary. They stated that they were going to search for the boy, and bring him home if they could, and, taking three or four pine torches, one of which they lighted, they set off for the edge of the forest, where they remained for two hours with the light, shouting at intervals; but the snow fell so fast, and the cold was so intense, for the wind blew fresh from the northward, that they could remain no longer. They did not, however, return to the house, but went to their own lodge to recover themselves, and remained there till daylight. They then went out again; the snow-storm had ceased, and the morning was clear and bright; they went back into the forest (on the road by which they had come home) for three or four miles, but the snow had now fallen and covered all the tracks which they had made the day before, and was in many places several feet deep. They proceeded to where Percival was last seen by John, who had described the spot very exactly; they looked every where about, made circuits round and round, in hopes of perceiving the muzzle of his rifle peeping out above the snow, but there was nothing to be discovered, and after a search of four or five hours, they returned to the house. They found Mr. Campbell and Henry in the kitchen, for Mrs. Campbell was in such a state of anxiety and distress, that she was in her room attended by Mary. Mr. Campbell perceived by their countenances that they brought no satisfactory tidings. Malachi shook his head mournfully, and sat down.",go find weep support husband state go search boy bring take pine torche light set edge forest remain hour light shouting interval snow fall cold intense wind blow fresh northward remain return house go own lodge recover remain daylight go snow storm cease morning clear bright go forest road come mile snow fall cover track make day many place several foot deep proceed see describe spot look make circuit hope perceive muzzle rifle peep snow be discover search hour return house find kitchen state anxiety distress room attend perceive countenance bring satisfactory tiding shake head sit

51,"""He is, I fear, sir; he must have sat down to rest himself, and has been overpowered and fallen asleep. He has been buried in the snow, and he will not wake till the day of resurrection.""",fear sir sit rest overpower fall asleep bury snow wake day resurrection 
52,"Mr. Campbell covered his face with his hands, and after a time exclaimed, ""His poor mother!""",cover face hand time exclaim poor mother 
53,"After a few minutes, he rose and went into Mrs. Campbell's room.",few minute rise go room 
54,"""What of my child,--my dear, dear Percival?"" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell.",child dear dear exclaim 
55,"""The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,"" replied Mr. Campbell; ""your child is happy.""",give take reply child happy 
56,"Mrs. Campbell wept bitterly; and having thus given vent to the feelings of nature, she became gradually more calm and resigned; her habitually devout spirit sought and found relief in the God of all comfort.",goot give vent feeling nature become calm resign devout spirit seek find relief comfort
