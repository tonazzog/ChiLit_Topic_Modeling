1,CHAPTER III. _About the Firedrake._,
2,"OF all the people who did not like Prigio, his own dear papa, King Grognio, disliked him most. For the king knew he was not clever himself. When he was in the counting-house, counting out his money, and when he happened to say, “Sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three pounds, fifteen,” it made him wild to hear Prigio whisper, “One pound, ten and twopence,”--which, of course, it _is_. And the king was afraid that Prigio would conspire, and get made king himself--which was the last thing Prigio really wanted. He much preferred to idle about, and know everything without seeming to take any trouble.",person like own dear papa dislike most king know clever counting house count money happen say shilling twopence pound make wild hear whisper pound twopence course king afraid conspire make king last thing want prefer idle know seem take trouble 
3,"Well, the king thought and thought. How was he to get Prigio out of the way, and make Enrico or Alphonso his successor? He read in books about it; and all the books showed that, if a king sent his three sons to do anything, it was always the youngest who did it, and got the crown. And he wished he had the chance. Well, it arrived at last.",king think think get way make successor read book book show king send son do young do get crown wish have chance arrive last 
4," There was a very hot summer! It began to be hot in March.’ All the rivers were dried up. The grass did not grow. The corn did not grow. The thermometers exploded with heat. The barometers stood at Set Fair. The people were much distressed, and came and broke the palace win-dows--as they usually do when things go wrong in Pantouflia.",be hot summer begin hot river dry grass grow corn grow thermometer explode heat barometer stand person distress come break palace win dow do thing go wrong 
5,"The king consulted the learned men about the Court, who told him that probably a FIREDRAKE was in the neighbourhood.",king consult learn man court tell neighbourhood 
6,"Now, the Firedrake is a beast, or bird, about the bigness of an elephant. Its body is made of iron, and it is always red-hot. A more terrible and cruel beast cannot be imagined; for, if you go near it, you are at once broiled by the Firedrake.",beast bird bigness elephant body make iron red hot terrible cruel beast imagine go broil 
7,"But the king was not ill-pleased: “for,” thought he, “of course my three sons must go after the brute, the eldest first; and, as usual, it will kill the first two, and be beaten by the youngest. It is a little hard on Enrico, poor boy; but _anything_ to get rid of that Prigio!”",king ill pleased think course son go brute old first usual kill first beat young little hard poor boy get rid 
8,"Then the king went to Prigio, and said that his country was in danger, and that he was determined to leave the crown to whichever of them would bring him the horns (for it has horns) and tail of the Firedrake.",king go say country danger determined leave crown bring horn have horn tail 
9,"“It is an awkward brute to tackle,” the king said, “but you are the oldest, my lad; go where glory waits you! Put on your armour, and be off with you!”",awkward brute tackle king say old lad go glory wait put armour 
10," This the king said, hoping that either the Firedrake would roast Prince Prigio alive (which he could easily do, as I have said; for he is all over as hot as a red-hot poker), or that, if the prince succeeded, at least his country would be freed from the monster.",king say hope roast alive do say hot red hot poker prince succeed least country free monster 
11,"But the prince, who was lying on the sofa doing sums in compound division, for fun, said in the politest way:",prince lie sofa do sum compound division fun say politest way 
12,"“Thanks to the education your majesty has given me, I have learned that the Firedrake, like the siren, the fairy, and so forth, is a fabulous animal which does not exist. But even granting, for the sake of argument, that there is a Firedrake, your majesty is well aware that there is no kind of use in sending _me_. It is always the eldest son who goes out first, and comes to grief on these occasions, and it is always the third son that succeeds. Send Alphonso” (this was the youngest brother), “and _he_ will do the trick at once. At least, if he fails, it will be most unusual, and Enrico can try his luck.”",thanks education majesty give learn siren fairy fabulous animal exist grant sake argument be firedrake majesty aware be kind use send old son go come grief occasion third son succeed send young brother do trick least fail unusual try luck 
13,"Then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate, and the king had to send for Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico. They both came in very warm; for they had been whipping tops, and the day was unusually hot.",go arithmetic slate king have send come warm whip top day hot 
14,"“Look here,” said the king, “just you two younger ones look at Prigio! You see how hot it is, and how coolly he takes it, and the country suffering; and all on account of a Firedrake, you know, which has apparently built his nest not far off. Well, I have asked that lout of a brother of yours to kill it, and he says--”",look say king young one look see hot take country suffering account know build nest ask lout brother kill say 
15,"“That he does not believe in Firedrakes,” interrupted Prigio, “The weather’s warm enough without going out hunting!”",believe interrupt weather warm go hunt 
16,"“Not believe in Firedrakes!” cried Alphonso. “I wonder what you _do_ believe in! Just let me get at the creature!” for he was as brave as a lion. “Hi! Page, my chain-armour, helmet, lance, and buckler! _A Molinda! A Molinda!_” which was his _war-cry_.",believe firedrake cry wonder believe let get creature brave lion page chain armour helmet lance buckler _war cry_ 
17,"The page ran to get the armour; but it was_ so uncommonly hot_ that he dropped it, and put his fingers in his mouth, crying!",page run get armour hot_ drop put finger mouth cry 
18,"“You had better put on flannels, Alphonso, for this kind of work,” said Prigio. “And if I were you, I’d take a light garden-engine, full of water, to squirt at the enemy.”",have good put flannel kind work say take light garden engine full water squirt enemy 
19,"“Happy thought!” said Alphonso. “I will!” And off he went, kissed his dear Molinda, bade her keep a lot of dances for him (there was to be a dance when he had killed the Firedrake), and then he rushed to the field!",happy thought say go kiss dear bid keep lot dance be be dance kill rush field 
20,But he never came back any more!,come more 
21,"Everyone wept bitterly--everyone but Prince Prigio; for he thought it was a practical joke, and said that Alphonso had taken the opportunity to start off on his travels and see the world.",goot think practical joke say take opportunity start travel see world 
22,"“There is some dreadful mistake, sir,” said Prigio to the king. “You know as well as I do that the youngest son has always succeeded, up to now. But I entertain great hopes of Enrico!”",be dreadful mistake sir say king know do young son succeed entertain great hope 
23,"And he grinned; for he fancied it was all _nonsense_, and that there were no Firedrakes.",grin fancy _nonsense_ be firedrake 
24,Enrico was present when Prigio was consoling the king in this unfeeling way.,present consol king unfeeling way 
25,"“Enrico, my boy,” said his majesty, “the task awaits you, and the honour. When _you_ come back with the horns and tail of the Fire-drake, you shall be crown prince; and Prigio shall be made an usher at the Grammar School--it is all he is fit for.”",boy say majesty task await honour come horn tail crown prince make usher fit 
26,Enrico was not quite so confident as Alphonso had been. He insisted on making his will; and he wrote a poem about the pleasures and advantages of dying young. This is part of it:,confident insist make will write poem pleasure advantage die young part 
27,"     The violet is a blossom sweet,        That droops before the day is done--      Slain by thine overpowering heat, O Sun!        And I, like that sweet purple flower,      May roast, or boil, or broil, or bake,        If burned by thy terrific power, Firedrake!",violet blossom sweet droop day do slain overpower heat sweet purple flower roast boil broil bake burn terrific power 
28,"This poem comforted Enrico more or less, and he showed it to Prigio. But the prince only laughed, and said that the second line of the last verse was not very good; for violets do not “roast, or boil, or broil, or bake.”",poem comfort more less show prince laugh say second line last verse good violet roast boil broil bake 
29,"Enrico tried to improve it, but could not. So he read it to his cousin, Lady Kathleena, just as it was; and she cried over it (though I don’t think she understood it); and Enrico cried a little, too.",try improve read cousin cry think understand cry little 
30,"However, next day he started, with a spear, a patent refrigerator, and a lot of the bottles people throw at fires to put them out.",next day start spear patent refrigerator lot bottle person throw fire put 
31,But _he_ never came back again!,come 
32,"After shedding torrents of tears, the king summoned Prince Prigio to his presence.",shed torrent tear king summon presence 
33,"“Dastard!” he said. “Poltroon! _Your_ turn, which should have come first, has arrived at last. _You_ must fetch me the horns and the tail of the Fired rake. Probably you will be grilled, thank goodness; but who will give me back Enrico and Alphonso?”",say turn come arrive last fetch horn tail fire rake grill thank goodness give 
34,"“Indeed, your majesty,” said Prigio, “you must permit me to correct your policy. Your only reason for dispatching your sons in pursuit of this dangerous but I believe _fabulous_ animal, was to ascertain which of us would most worthily succeed to your throne, at the date--long may it be deferred!--of your lamented decease. Now, there can be no further question about the matter. I, unworthy as I am, represent the sole hope of the royal family. Therefore to send me after the Firedrake were* both dangerous and unnecessary. Dangerous, because, if he treats me as you say he did my brothers--my unhappy brothers,--the throne of Pantouflia will want an heir. But, if I do come back alive--why, I cannot be more the true heir than I am at present; now _can_ I? Ask the Lord Chief Justice, if you don’t believe _me_.”",majesty say permit correct policy only reason dispatch son pursuit dangerous believe animal ascertain succeed throne date deferre lament decease be further question matter unworthy represent sole hope royal family send dangerous unnecessary dangerous treat say do brother unhappy brother throne want heir come alive true heir present ask chief believe
