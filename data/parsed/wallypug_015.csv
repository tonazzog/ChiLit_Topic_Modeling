4,"“Hm! Eggshell blue,” said the Kangaroo, examining the Wallypug critically. “Very extraordinary tint. Never seen a face that shade before.”",eggshell blue say examine extraordinary tint see face shade 
5,"“The other one is worse,” declared the Cockatoo, pointing at me derisively. “I always knew he was something disreputable. I believe,” she added, sinking her voice into a hoarse whisper, “I believe he has let himself out as an advertisement for Stephen’s Blue-black Ink, or Ricket’s Paris Blue. What depravity. Down with him! Duck him in the pond! Scrub him with sandpaper! Boil him!” and so she went on.",other one bad declare point know disreputable believe add sink voice hoarse whisper believe let advertisement blue black depravity duck pond scrub sandpaper boil go

7,"“Oh! will you indeed,” exclaimed the Cockatoo excitedly, “I should like to see you attempt it. It strikes me that _you_ are the one that will be put out. We can stand a good deal down here, but a hatless object with a _blue_ face. Ough!”",exclaim like see attempt strike one put stand good deal hatless object _blue_ face 
8,"“Here, come and do your duty,” she shouted, going to the door, and the two Crocodiles entered and caught hold of me roughly by the collar. “Bring them out into the courtyard,” shouted the infuriated bird, and before I could protest I was bundled unceremoniously out of the house by the Crocodiles, the Kangaroo and Oom Hi following with the Wallypug.",come do duty shout go door crocodile enter catch hold collar bring courtyard shout infuriate bird protest bundle house follow

18,"“Oh! don’t! don’t!” cried the poor Wallypug. “I’m not going to take any of that stuff. It killed the lady who called herself my Sister-in-Law you know, and it made the Doctor-in-Law ill. Take it away.”",cry poor go take stuff kill lady call know make ill take 
19,"“Of course you are not going to take any, Wallypug,” said Oom Hi soothingly, “but there will be no harm in trying the effect upon your complexion. It _might_ make you the proper color again you know, and in that case I could alter the name and call it ‘Wallypug’s Blush,’ and advertise it well; no doubt it would be a great success. Put some on the sponge,” he continued, holding it out to the Kangaroo, who poured out some of the nasty looking stuff.",course go take say be harm try effect complexion _might_ make proper color know case alter name call advertise doubt great success put sponge continue hold pour nasty look stuff

25,[HIS MAJESTY IN THE STOCKS.],majesty stocks 
26,"The last view that I had of his Majesty was of the poor little fellow, utterly worn out with his exertions, meekly sitting in the stocks and falling into an uneasy slumber, from which, however, he was frequently awakened by the bees and flies, which, attracted by the sticky stuff on his face and hands, flocked around him as though he were a pot of jam.",last view have poor little fellow wear exertion sit stock fall uneasy slumber awaken bee fly attract sticky stuff face hand flock pot jam 
27,"“We might keep _this_ as a curiosity,” said the Cockatoo, turning her attention to me next. “Put in a cage with a large label, ‘Blue-faced and hatless man, Dangerous!’ he ought to be an attraction to our menagerie. I think that’s what we’ll do with him,” and despite my struggles and protests I was ignominiously marched off by the Crocodiles, who continued to make rude and personal remarks about my appearance all the way to the dungeon, where it appeared I was to spend my time till a cage could be prepared for me.",keep curiosity say turn attention put cage large label blue face hatless man dangerous attraction menagerie think do struggle protest march continue make rude personal remark appearance way dungeon appear spend time cage prepare

30,"I was pondering seriously upon this question, when suddenly I remembered the Gombobble with which the little blue people had presented me when I left Wer-har-wei. Taking it from my pocket I idly wondered if it were good to eat or not. It felt soft and looked something like a huge blue orange or a melon; getting out my penknife I plunged it in and cut the fruit open. Inside was a white juicy pulp which looked very tempting, so trusting to its being good to eat I took a bite.",ponder question remember little blue person present leave take pocket wonder good eat feel soft look huge blue orange melon get penknife plunge cut fruit open white juicy pulp look tempting trust good eat take bite
