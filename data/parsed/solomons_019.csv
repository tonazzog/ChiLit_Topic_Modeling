1,CHAPTER XVIII. WE ABANDON HOPE,aband hope 
2,"I can give no adequate description of the horrors of the night which followed. Mercifully they were to some extent mitigated by sleep, for even in such a position as ours wearied nature will sometimes assert itself. But I, at any rate, found it impossible to sleep much. Putting aside the terrifying thought of our impending doom--for the bravest man on earth might well quail from such a fate as awaited us, and I never made any pretensions to be brave--the _silence_ itself was too great to allow of it. Reader, you may have lain awake at night and thought the quiet oppressive, but I say with confidence that you can have no idea what a vivid, tangible thing is perfect stillness. On the surface of the earth there is always some sound or motion, and though it may in itself be imperceptible, yet it deadens the sharp edge of absolute silence. But here there was none. We were buried in the bowels of a huge snow-clad peak. Thousands of feet above us the fresh air rushed over the white snow, but no sound of it reached us. We were separated by a long tunnel and five feet of rock even from the awful chamber of the Dead; and the dead make no noise. Did we not know it who lay by poor Foulata's side? The crashing of all the artillery of earth and heaven could not have come to our ears in our living tomb. We were cut off from every echo of the world--we were as men already in the grave.",give adequate description horror night follow extent mitigate sleep position weary nature assert rate find impossible sleep much put terrifying thought impending doom bravest man earth quail fate await make pretension brave _silence_ great allow reader lain night think quiet oppressive say confidence have idea vivid tangible thing perfect stillness surface earth be sound motion imperceptible deaden sharp edge absolute silence be bury bowel huge snow clad peak thousand foot fresh air rush white snow sound reach separate long tunnel foot rock awful chamber dead make noise know lay poor side crashing artillery earth heaven come ear living tomb cut echo world man grave 
3,"Then the irony of the situation forced itself upon me. There around us lay treasures enough to pay off a moderate national debt, or to build a fleet of ironclads, and yet we would have bartered them all gladly for the faintest chance of escape. Soon, doubtless, we should be rejoiced to exchange them for a bit of food or a cup of water, and, after that, even for the privilege of a speedy close to our sufferings. Truly wealth, which men spend their lives in acquiring, is a valueless thing at the last.",irony situation force lay treasure pay moderate national debt build fleet ironclad barter faintest chance escape rejoice exchange bit food cup water privilege speedy close suffering wealth man spend life acquire valueless thing last

8,"He did so, and in contrast to the dense darkness the flame nearly blinded us. It was five o'clock by my watch. The beautiful dawn was now blushing on the snow-wreaths far over our heads, and the breeze would be stirring the night mists in the hollows.",contrast dense darkness flame blind o'clock watch beautiful dawn blush snow wreath head breeze stir night mist hollow

11,"""While there is life there is hope,"" said Sir Henry.",be life be hope say 
12,"Accordingly we ate and sipped some water, and another period of time elapsed. Then Sir Henry suggested that it might be well to get as near the door as possible and halloa, on the faint chance of somebody catching a sound outside. Accordingly Good, who, from long practice at sea, has a fine piercing note, groped his way down the passage and set to work. I must say that he made a most diabolical noise. I never heard such yells; but it might have been a mosquito buzzing for all the effect they produced.",eat sipp water period time elapse suggest well get door possible halloa faint chance catching sound good long practice sea have fine piercing note grope way passage set work say make diabolical noise hear such yell mosquito buzzing effect produce 
13,"After a while he gave it up and came back very thirsty, and had to drink. Then we stopped yelling, as it encroached on the supply of water.",while give come thirsty have drink stop yell encroach supply water 
14,"So we sat down once more against the chests of useless diamonds in that dreadful inaction which was one of the hardest circumstances of our fate; and I am bound to say that, for my part, I gave way in despair. Laying my head against Sir Henry's broad shoulder I burst into tears; and I think that I heard Good gulping away on the other side, and swearing hoarsely at himself for doing so.",sit more chest useless diamond dreadful inaction hard circumstance fate bound say part give way despair lay head broad shoulder burst tear think hear good gulp other side swear do 
15,"Ah, how good and brave that great man was! Had we been two frightened children, and he our nurse, he could not have treated us more tenderly. Forgetting his own share of miseries, he did all he could to soothe our broken nerves, telling stories of men who had been in somewhat similar circumstances, and miraculously escaped; and when these failed to cheer us, pointing out how, after all, it was only anticipating an end which must come to us all, that it would soon be over, and that death from exhaustion was a merciful one (which is not true). Then, in a diffident sort of way, as once before I had heard him do, he suggested that we should throw ourselves on the mercy of a higher Power, which for my part I did with great vigour.",good brave great man frighten child nurse treat forgett own share misery do soothe break nerve tell story man similar circumstance escape fail cheer point anticipate end come death exhaustion merciful one true diffident sort way hear do suggest throw mercy high power part do great vigour 
16,"His is a beautiful character, very quiet, but very strong.",beautiful character quiet strong

18,"Once more we ate and drank, and as we did so an idea occurred to me.",eat drink do idea occur 
19,"""How is it,"" said I, ""that the air in this place keeps fresh? It is thick and heavy, but it is perfectly fresh.""",say air place keep fresh thick heavy fresh 
20,"""Great heavens!"" said Good, starting up, ""I never thought of that. It can't come through the stone door, for it's air-tight, if ever a door was. It must come from somewhere. If there were no current of air in the place we should have been stifled or poisoned when we first came in. Let us have a look.""",great heaven say good start think come stone door air tight door come be current air place stifle poison come let have look 
21,"It was wonderful what a change this mere spark of hope wrought in us. In a moment we were all three groping about on our hands and knees, feeling for the slightest indication of a draught. Presently my ardour received a check. I put my hand on something cold. It was dead Foulata's face.",wonderful change mere spark hope wring moment grope hand knee feel slight indication draught ardour receive check put hand cold dead face 
22,"For an hour or more we went on feeling about, till at last Sir Henry and I gave it up in despair, having been considerably hurt by constantly knocking our heads against tusks, chests, and the sides of the chamber. But Good still persevered, saying, with an approach to cheerfulness, that it was better than doing nothing.",hour more go feeling last give despair hurt knock head tusk chest side chamber persever say approach cheerfulness good do

27,"""Now listen."" He rose and stamped upon the place, and a flame of hope shot up in our hearts. _It rang hollow._",listen rise stamp place flame hope shoot heart ring hollow 
28,"With trembling hands I lit a match. I had only three left, and we saw that we were in the angle of the far corner of the chamber, a fact that accounted for our not having noticed the hollow sound of the place during our former exhaustive examination. As the match burnt we scrutinised the spot. There was a join in the solid rock floor, and, great heavens! there, let in level with the rock, was a stone ring. We said no word, we were too excited, and our hearts beat too wildly with hope to allow us to speak. Good had a knife, at the back of which was one of those hooks that are made to extract stones from horses' hoofs. He opened it, and scratched round the ring with it. Finally he worked it under, and levered away gently for fear of breaking the hook. The ring began to move. Being of stone it had not rusted fast in all the centuries it had lain there, as would have been the case had it been of iron. Presently it was upright. Then he thrust his hands into it and tugged with all his force, but nothing budged.",tremble hand light match have left see angle far corner chamber fact account notice hollow sound place former exhaustive examination match burn scrutinise spot be join solid rock floor great heaven let level rock stone ring say word excited heart beat hope allow speak good have knife back hook make extract stone horse hoof open scratch ring work lever fear break hook ring begin move stone rust century lain case iron upright thrust hand tug force budge 
29,"""Let me try,"" I said impatiently, for the situation of the stone, right in the angle of the corner, was such that it was impossible for two to pull at once. I took hold and strained away, but no results.",let try say situation stone angle corner such impossible pull take hold strain result 
30,Then Sir Henry tried and failed.,try fail 
31,"Taking the hook again, Good scratched all round the crack where we felt the air coming up.",take hook scratch crack feel air come 
32,"""Now, Curtis,"" he said, ""tackle on, and put your back into it; you are as strong as two. Stop,"" and he took off a stout black silk handkerchief, which, true to his habits of neatness, he still wore, and ran it through the ring. ""Quatermain, get Curtis round the middle and pull for dear life when I give the word. _Now._""",say tackle put back strong stop take stout black silk handkerchief true habit neatness wear run ring get middle pull dear life give word 
33,"Sir Henry put out all his enormous strength, and Good and I did the same, with such power as nature had given us.",put enormous strength do same such power nature give 
34,"""Heave! heave! it's giving,"" gasped Sir Henry; and I heard the muscles of his great back cracking. Suddenly there was a grating sound, then a rush of air, and we were all on our backs on the floor with a heavy flag-stone upon the top of us. Sir Henry's strength had done it, and never did muscular power stand a man in better stead.",heave heave give gasp hear muscle great back cracking be grate sound rush air back floor heavy flag stone top strength do do muscular power stand man good stead 
35,"""Light a match, Quatermain,"" he said, so soon as we had picked ourselves up and got our breath; ""carefully, now.""",light match say pick get breath

38,"""Follow the stair, of course, and trust to Providence.""",follow stair course trust 
39,"""Stop!"" said Sir Henry; ""Quatermain, get the bit of biltong and the water that are left; we may want them.""",stop say get bit biltong water leave want 
40,"I went, creeping back to our place by the chests for that purpose, and as I was coming away an idea struck me. We had not thought much of the diamonds for the last twenty-four hours or so; indeed, the very idea of diamonds was nauseous, seeing what they had entailed upon us; but, reflected I, I may as well pocket some in case we ever should get out of this ghastly hole. So I just put my fist into the first chest and filled all the available pockets of my old shooting-coat and trousers, topping up--this was a happy thought--with a few handfuls of big ones from the third chest. Also, by an afterthought, I stuffed Foulata's basket, which, except for one water-gourd and a little biltong, was empty now, with great quantities of the stones.",go creep place chest purpose come idea strike think much diamond last hour very idea diamond nauseous see entail reflect pocket case get ghastly hole put fist first chest fill available pocket old shooting coat trousers topp happy thought few handful big one third chest afterthought stuff basket water gourd little biltong empty great quantity stone

42,"""Oh, come on, Quatermain! and hang the diamonds!"" said Sir Henry. ""I hope that I may never see another.""",come hang diamond say hope see 
43,"As for Good, he made no answer. He was, I think, taking his last farewell of all that was left of the poor girl who had loved him so well. And curious as it may seem to you, my reader, sitting at home at ease and reflecting on the vast, indeed the immeasurable, wealth which we were thus abandoning, I can assure you that if you had passed some twenty-eight hours with next to nothing to eat and drink in that place, you would not have cared to cumber yourself with diamonds whilst plunging down into the unknown bowels of the earth, in the wild hope of escape from an agonising death. If from the habits of a lifetime, it had not become a sort of second nature with me never to leave anything worth having behind if there was the slightest chance of my being able to carry it away, I am sure that I should not have bothered to fill my pockets and that basket.",make answer think take last farewell leave poor girl love curious seem reader sit home ease reflect vast immeasurable wealth abandon assure pass hour next eat drink place care cumber diamond plung unknown bowel earth wild hope escape agonise death habit lifetime become sort second nature leave worth have be slight chance able carry sure bother fill pocket basket

45,"""Mind where you put your feet, there may be some awful hole underneath,"" I answered.",mind put foot be awful hole answer 
46,"""Much more likely to be another room,"" said Sir Henry, while he descended slowly, counting the steps as he went.",likely room say descend count step go 
47,"When he got to ""fifteen"" he stopped. ""Here's the bottom,"" he said. ""Thank goodness! I think it's a passage. Follow me down.""",get stop bottom say thank goodness think passage follow 
48,"Good went next, and I came last, carrying the basket, and on reaching the bottom lit one of the two remaining matches. By its light we could just see that we were standing in a narrow tunnel, which ran right and left at right angles to the staircase we had descended. Before we could make out any more, the match burnt my fingers and went out. Then arose the delicate question of which way to go. Of course, it was impossible to know what the tunnel was, or where it led to, and yet to turn one way might lead us to safety, and the other to destruction. We were utterly perplexed, till suddenly it struck Good that when I had lit the match the draught of the passage blew the flame to the left.",good go come last carry basket reach bottom light remain match light see stand narrow tunnel run leave right angle staircase descend make more match burn finger go arise delicate question way go course impossible know tunnel lead turn way lead safety other destruction perplexed strike good light match draught passage blow flame left 
49,"""Let us go against the draught,"" he said; ""air draws inwards, not outwards.""",let go draught say air draw 
50,"We took this suggestion, and feeling along the wall with our hands, whilst trying the ground before us at every step, we departed from that accursed treasure chamber on our terrible quest for life. If ever it should be entered again by living man, which I do not think probable, he will find tokens of our visit in the open chests of jewels, the empty lamp, and the white bones of poor Foulata.",take suggestion feel wall hand try ground step depart accurse treasure chamber terrible quest life enter live man think probable find token visit open chest jewel empty lamp white bone poor 
51,"When we had groped our way for about a quarter of an hour along the passage, suddenly it took a sharp turn, or else was bisected by another, which we followed, only in course of time to be led into a third. And so it went on for some hours. We seemed to be in a stone labyrinth that led nowhere. What all these passages are, of course I cannot say, but we thought that they must be the ancient workings of a mine, of which the various shafts and adits travelled hither and thither as the ore led them. This is the only way in which we could account for such a multitude of galleries.",grope way quarter hour passage take sharp turn bisect follow course time lead third go hour seem stone labyrinth lead passage course say think ancient working various shaft adit travel ore lead only way account multitude gallery 
52,"At length we halted, thoroughly worn out with fatigue and with that hope deferred which maketh the heart sick, and ate up our poor remaining piece of biltong and drank our last sup of water, for our throats were like lime-kilns. It seemed to us that we had escaped Death in the darkness of the treasure chamber only to meet him in the darkness of the tunnels.",length halt wear fatigue hope deferre maketh heart sick eat poor remain piece biltong drink last sup water throat lime kiln seem escape death darkness treasure chamber meet darkness tunnel 
53,"As we stood, once more utterly depressed, I thought that I caught a sound, to which I called the attention of the others. It was very faint and very far off, but it _was_ a sound, a faint, murmuring sound, for the others heard it too, and no words can describe the blessedness of it after all those hours of utter, awful stillness.",stand depressed think catch sound call attention other faint sound faint murmure sound other hear word describe blessedness hour utter awful stillness 
54,"""By heaven! it's running water,"" said Good. ""Come on.""",heaven run water say good come 
55,"Off we started again in the direction from which the faint murmur seemed to come, groping our way as before along the rocky walls. I remember that I laid down the basket full of diamonds, wishing to be rid of its weight, but on second thoughts took it up again. One might as well die rich as poor, I reflected. As we went the sound became more and more audible, till at last it seemed quite loud in the quiet. On, yet on; now we could distinctly make out the unmistakable swirl of rushing water. And yet how could there be running water in the bowels of the earth? Now we were quite near it, and Good, who was leading, swore that he could smell it.",start direction faint murmur seem come grope way rocky wall remember lay basket full diamond wish rid weight second thought take die rich poor reflect go sound become audible last seem loud quiet make unmistakable swirl rush water be run water bowel earth lead swore smell

58,"""Good! Good! where are you?"" we shouted, in terrified distress. To our intense relief an answer came back in a choky voice.",good good shout terrified distress intense relief answer come choky voice 
59,"""All right; I've got hold of a rock. Strike a light to show me where you are.""",right get hold rock strike light show 
60,"Hastily I lit the last remaining match. Its faint gleam discovered to us a dark mass of water running at our feet. How wide it was we could not see, but there, some way out, was the dark form of our companion hanging on to a projecting rock.",light last remain match faint gleam discover dark mass water run foot wide see way dark form companion hang project rock 
61,"""Stand clear to catch me,"" sung out Good. ""I must swim for it.""",stand clear catch sung good swim 
62,"Then we heard a splash, and a great struggle. Another minute and he had grabbed at and caught Sir Henry's outstretched hand, and we had pulled him up high and dry into the tunnel.",hear splash great struggle minute grab catch outstretched hand pull high dry tunnel 
63,"""My word!"" he said, between his gasps, ""that was touch and go. If I hadn't managed to catch that rock, and known how to swim, I should have been done. It runs like a mill-race, and I could feel no bottom.""",word say gasp touch go manage catch rock know swim do run mill race feel bottom 
64,"We dared not follow the banks of the subterranean river for fear lest we should fall into it again in the darkness. So after Good had rested a while, and we had drunk our fill of the water, which was sweet and fresh, and washed our faces, that needed it sadly, as well as we could, we started from the banks of this African Styx, and began to retrace our steps along the tunnel, Good dripping unpleasantly in front of us. At length we came to another gallery leading to our right.",follow bank subterranean river fear fall darkness good rest while drink fill water sweet fresh wash face need start bank african begin retrace step tunnel good drip front length come gallery lead right 
65,"""We may as well take it,"" said Sir Henry wearily; ""all roads are alike here; we can only go on till we drop.""",take say road alike go drop 
66,"Slowly, for a long, long while, we stumbled, utterly exhausted, along this new tunnel, Sir Henry now leading the way. Again I thought of abandoning that basket, but did not.",long long while stumble exhaust new tunnel lead way think abandon basket 
67,"Suddenly he stopped, and we bumped up against him.",stop bump 
68,"""Look!"" he whispered, ""is my brain going, or is that light?""",look whisper brain go light 
69,"We stared with all our eyes, and there, yes, there, far ahead of us, was a faint, glimmering spot, no larger than a cottage window pane. It was so faint that I doubt if any eyes, except those which, like ours, had for days seen nothing but blackness, could have perceived it at all.",stare eye faint glimmering spot large cottage window pane faint doubt eye have day see blackness perceive 
70,"With a gasp of hope we pushed on. In five minutes there was no longer any doubt; it _was_ a patch of faint light. A minute more and a breath of real live air was fanning us. On we struggled. All at once the tunnel narrowed. Sir Henry went on his knees. Smaller yet it grew, till it was only the size of a large fox's earth--it was _earth_ now, mind you; the rock had ceased.",gasp hope push minute be doubt patch faint light minute more breath real live air fann struggle tunnel narrow go knee smaller grow size large fox earth _earth_ mind rock cease 
71,"A squeeze, a struggle, and Sir Henry was out, and so was Good, and so was I, dragging Foulata's basket after me; and there above us were the blessed stars, and in our nostrils was the sweet air. Then suddenly something gave, and we were all rolling over and over and over through grass and bushes and soft, wet soil.",squeeze struggle good drag basket bless star nostril sweet air give roll grass bush soft wet soil 
72,"The basket caught in something and I stopped. Sitting up I halloed lustily. An answering shout came from below, where Sir Henry's wild career had been checked by some level ground. I scrambled to him, and found him unhurt, though breathless. Then we looked for Good. A little way off we discovered him also, hammed in a forked root. He was a good deal knocked about, but soon came to himself.",basket catch stop sit halloe answer shout come wild career check level ground scramble find unhurt breathless look little way discover hamm fork root good deal knock come 
73,"We sat down together, there on the grass, and the revulsion of feeling was so great that really I think we cried with joy. We had escaped from that awful dungeon, which was so near to becoming our grave. Surely some merciful Power guided our footsteps to the jackal hole, for that is what it must have been, at the termination of the tunnel. And see, yonder on the mountains the dawn we had never thought to look upon again was blushing rosy red.",sit grass revulsion feeling great think cry joy escape awful dungeon become grave merciful guide footstep jackal hole termination tunnel see mountain dawn think look blush rosy red 
74,"Presently the grey light stole down the slopes, and we saw that we were at the bottom, or rather, nearly at the bottom, of the vast pit in front of the entrance to the cave. Now we could make out the dim forms of the three Colossi who sat upon its verge. Doubtless those awful passages, along which we had wandered the livelong night, had been originally in some way connected with the great diamond mine. As for the subterranean river in the bowels of the mountain, Heaven only knows what it is, or whence it flows, or whither it goes. I, for one, have no anxiety to trace its course.",grey light steal slope see bottom bottom vast pit front entrance cave make dim form sit verge awful passage wander livelong night way connect great diamond subterranean river bowel mountain know flow go have anxiety trace course 
75,"Lighter it grew, and lighter yet. We could see each other now, and such a spectacle as we presented I have never set eyes on before or since. Gaunt-cheeked, hollow-eyed wretches, smeared all over with dust and mud, bruised, bleeding, the long fear of imminent death yet written on our countenances, we were, indeed, a sight to frighten the daylight. And yet it is a solemn fact that Good's eye-glass was still fixed in Good's eye. I doubt whether he had ever taken it out at all. Neither the darkness, nor the plunge in the subterranean river, nor the roll down the slope, had been able to separate Good and his eye-glass.",lighter grow light see other spectacle present set eye cheeked hollow eyed wretche smear dust mud bruise bleeding long fear imminent death write countenance sight frighten daylight solemn fact eye glass fix eye doubt take darkness plunge subterranean river roll slope able separate good eye glass 
76,"Presently we rose, fearing that our limbs would stiffen if we stopped there longer, and commenced with slow and painful steps to struggle up the sloping sides of the great pit. For an hour or more we toiled steadfastly up the blue clay, dragging ourselves on by the help of the roots and grasses with which it was clothed. But now I had no more thought of leaving the basket; indeed, nothing but death should have parted us.",rise fear limb stiff stop commence slow painful step struggle slope side great pit hour more toil blue clay drag help root grasse cloth have more thought leave basket death part

We staggered towards them, supporting one another, and halting every few paces.
