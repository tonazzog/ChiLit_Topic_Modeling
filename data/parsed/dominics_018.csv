2,"The _Dominican_ appeared once more before the holidays, and, as might have been expected (besides its usual articles at the expense of the Sixth Form), made itself particularly merry over the rebellion of the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles.",appear holiday expect usual article expense sixth make merry rebellion guinea pig

5,"""Thank goodness, we are at last rid of the pest which has made Saint Dominic's hideous for months past!  At a single blow, with a single clap of the hands, we have sent Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles packing, and can now breathe pure air.  No longer shall we have to put up with the plague. We are to be spared the disgust of seeing them, much more of talking to them or hearing their hideous voices.  No longer will our morning milk be burned; no longer will our herrings be grilled to cinders; no longer will our jam be purloined; no longer will our books and door-handles be made abominable by contact with their filthy hands!  Thank goodness! The Doctor never did a more patriotic deed than this!  The small animals are in future to be kept to their own quarters, and will be forbidden the liberty they have so long abused of mixing with their betters.  It is as well for all parties; and if any event could have brightened the last days of this term, it is this--"" and so on.",thank goodness last rid pest make hideous month single blow single clap hand send guinea pig tadpole pack breathe pure air have put plague spare disgust see more talk hear hideous voice morning milk burn herring grill cinder jam purloin book door handle make abominable contact filthy hand thank goodness do patriotic deed small animal future keep own quarter forbidden liberty abuse mix better party event brighten last day term 
6,"Before this manifesto, a swarm of youngsters puzzled on the day of publication with no little bewilderment and fury.  They had refused to allow any of their number to act as policeman, and had secretly been making merry over the embarrassment of their late persecutors, and wondering whatever they would be able to say for their humiliated selves in the _Dominican_--and lo! here was an article which, if it meant anything, meant that the heroic rebellion of the juniors was regarded not with dismay, but with positive triumph, by the very fellows it had been intended to ""squash!""",manifesto swarm youngster puzzle day publication little bewilderment fury refuse allow number act policeman make merry embarrassment late persecutor wonder able say humiliate selve article mean mean heroic rebellion junior regard dismay positive triumph very fellow intend squash

14,"""Hullo, I say, look here!"" cried Stephen, turning quite yellow; ""the Doctor's in it, they say, Bramble.  `The small animals'--that's you and Padger--`are to be kept in their own quarters.'  Whew! there's a go.""",say look cry turn yellow say small animal keep own quarter be go

17,"The head master was in the most favourable times an object of terror to the ""guilty-conscienced youth"" of the Fourth Junior, and the sight even of his back often sufficed to quell their tumults.  But here he stood face to face with his unhappy victims, one of whom had just cried, ""Bother the Doctor!"" and all of whom had by word and gesture approved of the sentiment.  Why would not the pavement yawn and swallow them?  And which of them would not at that moment have given a thousand pounds (if he had it) to be standing anywhere but where he was?",head master favourable time object terror guilty conscience youth fourth sight back suffice quell tumult stand face face unhappy victim cry bother have word gesture approve sentiment pavement yawn swallow moment give pound have stand

26,"A groan of horror passed through the ranks of the unhappy Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles at these words.  Bramble looked wildly about him, if haply he might escape by a window or lie hid in a desk; while Stephen, Paul, Padger, and the other ringleaders, gave themselves up for lost, and mentally bade farewell to joy for ever.",groan horror pass rank unhappy guinea pig tadpole word look escape window lie hide desk other ringleader give lose bid farewell joy

31,"""The first boy,--what can you tell me about the curfew?""  The first boy was well up in the curfew, and rattled off a ""full, true, and particular account"" of that fine old English institution, much to everybody's satisfaction.

38,"Now and again he stopped short and demanded an explanation of some obscure phrase, the answers to which were now correct, now hazy, now brilliantly original.  On the whole it was not satisfactory; and when for a change the Doctor gave up reciting, and made the boys read, the effect was still worse.  One boy, quite a master of elocution, spoilt the whole beauty of the lines,--",stop short demand explanation obscure phrase answer correct hazy original whole satisfactory change give recit make boy read effect bad boy master elocution spoil whole beauty line

55,"As might be expected, the exhibition was a miserable one; Bramble was found wanting in every particular.  The simplest questions could hardly coax a correct answer out of him, whereas an ordinary inquiry was hopelessly beyond his powers.  He mixed up William the Conqueror and William of Orange; he subtracted what ought to be multiplied, and floundered about between conjunctions and prepositions in a sickening way.  The Doctor did not spare him.  He went ruthlessly on--exposing the boy's ignorance, first in one thing, then another.  Bramble stood and trembled and perspired before him, and wished he was dead, but the questions still came on.  If he had answered a single thing correctly it would have been a different matter, but he knew nothing.  I believe he did know what twice two was, but that was the one question the Doctor did not ask him.  As to French, Latin, Grammar, and Euclid, the clock on the wall knew as much of them as Bramble.  It came to an end at last.",expect exhibition miserable one find want particular simple question coax correct answer ordinary inquiry power mix subtract multiply flounder conjunction preposition sickening way spare go expose boy ignorance thing stand tremble perspire wish dead question come answer single thing different matter know believe know question ask french clock wall know much come end last

57,"The luckless youngsters obeyed, and when they stood in a row before the dreaded Doctor, the bottom form and half of the bottom form but one were empty.",luckless youngster obey stand row dread bottom form half bottom form empty 
58,"""Now, you boys,"" began the head master, very gravely, ""I hadn't intended to examine you to-day; but, from something I heard one of you say, I felt rather anxious to know how some of you are doing in your studies. These half-dozen boys I was particularly anxious to know of, because I heard them talking to-day as if they were the most important boys in the whole school.  They _are_ the most important; for they are the most ignorant, and require, and in future will receive, the closest looking after.  You, little boys,"" said the Doctor, turning to the row of abashed culprits, ""take a word of warning from me.  Do not be silly as well as dunces.  Do not think, as long as you know least of any one in the school you can pretend to rule the school.  I hope some of you have been led to see to-day you are not as clever as you would like to be. If you try, and work hard, and stick like men to your lessons, you will know more than you do now; and when you do know more you will see that the best way for little boys to get on is not by giving themselves ridiculous airs, but by doing their duty steadily in class, and living at peace with one another, and submitting quietly to the discipline of the school.  Don't let me hear any more of this recent nonsense.  You'll be going off in a day or two for the holidays.  Take my advice, and think over what I have said; and next term let me see you in your right minds, determined to work hard and do your part honestly for the credit of the good old school.

59,"And so the Doctor's visitation came to an end.  It made a very deep impression on the youthful members of the Fourth Junior.  Most of them felt very much ashamed of themselves; and nearly every one felt his veneration and admiration for the Doctor greatly heightened.  Only a few incorrigibles like Bramble professed to make light of the scene through which they had just passed, and even he, it was evident, was considerably chastened by his experience.",visitation come end make deep impression youthful member fourth most feel ashamed one feel veneration admiration heighten few incorrigible profess make light scene pass evident chasten experience

I think we might venture out and peruse it where it hangs.""  So half-stealthily, when the whole school was falling asleep, Dr Senior and his colleagues stepped out into the passage, and by the aid of a candle satisfied their curiosity as to the mysterious _Dominican_.",do say mountain come know disciple go mountain think venture peruse hang half whole school fall asleep colleague step passage aid candle satisfy curiosity mysterious 
68,"A good deal of its humour was, of course, lost upon them, as they could hardly be expected to understand the force of all the allusions it contained.  But they saw quite enough to enable them to gather the general tenor of the paper; it amused and it concerned them.",good deal humour course lose expect understand force allusion contain see enough enable gather general tenor paper amuse concern

I was sorry to see in the present number a good deal that might have been well omitted of that kind.  Remember this, Pembury, I want all you boys, instead of separating off one set from another, and making divisions between class and class, to try to make common cause over the whole school, and unite all the boys in common cause for the good of Saint Dominic's.  Now your paper could help not a little in this direction.  Indeed, if it does not help, it had better not be issued.  There!  I shall not refer to the matter again unless you give me cause.  I do not want to discourage you in your undertaking, for it's really an excellent idea, and capitally carried out.
