1,CHAPTER XII. MOBILISATION.,mobilisation 
2," Generally speaking, Hugh John despised Sammy Carter--first, because he could lick him with one hand, and, secondly, because Sammy Carter was a clever boy and could discover ways of getting even without licking him. Clever boys are all cheeky and need hammering. Besides, Sammy Carter was in love with Prissy, and every one knew what that meant. But then Sammy Carter had a sister, Cissy by name, and she was quite a different row of beans.",speak despise lick hand clever boy discover way get lick clever boy cheeky need hammer love one know mean have sister name different row bean 
3,"Furthermore, Sammy Carter read books--a degrading pursuit, unless they had to do with soldiering, and especially with the wars of Napoleon, Hugh John's great ancestor. In addition, Sammy knew every date that was, and would put you right in a minute if you said that Bannockburn happened after Waterloo, or any little thing like that. A disposition so perverse as this could only be cured with a wicket or with Hugh John's foot, and our hero frequently applied both corrections.",read book degrade pursuit have do soldiering war great ancestor addition know date put minute say happen little thing disposition perverse cure wicket foot hero apply correction 
4,"But Cissy Carter--ah! now there was a girl if you like. She never troubled about such things. She could not run so fast as Prissy, but then she had a perfect colt's mane of hair, black and glossy, which flew out behind her when she did. Moreover, she habitually did what Hugh John told her, and burned much incense at his shrine, so that modest youth approved of her. It was of her he first thought when he set about organising his army for the assault upon the Black Sheds, where, like Hofer at Mantua, the gallant Donald lay in chains.",be girl like trouble such thing run have perfect colt mane hair black glossy fly do tell burn much incense shrine modest youth approve think set organise army assault black gallant lay chain 
5,"But it was written in the chronicles of Oaklands that Cissy Carter could not be allowed over the river without Sammy, so Sammy would have to be permitted to join too. Hugh John resolved that he would keep his eye very sharply upon Prissy and Sammy Carter, for the abandoned pair had been known to compose poetry in the heat of an engagement, and even to read their compositions to one another on the sly. For this misdemeanour Prissy would certainly have been court-martialled, only that her superior officer could not catch her at the time. But the wicked did not wholly escape, for Hugh John tugged her hair afterwards till she cried; whereat Janet Sheepshanks, coming suddenly upon him and cornering him, spanked him till _he_ cried. He cried solely as a measure of military necessity, because it was the readiest way of getting Janet to stop, and also because that day Janet wore a new pair of slippers, with heels upon which Hugh John had not been counting. So he cried till he got out of Janet's reach, when he put out his tongue at her and said, ""Hum-m! Thought you hurt, didn't you? Well, it just didn't a bit!""",write chronicle allow river have permit join resolve keep eye abandon pair know compose poetry heat engagement read composition sly misdemeanour prissy court martiall superior officer catch time wicked escape tug hair cry come corner spank cry cry measure military necessity readiest way get stop day wear new pair slipper heel count cry get reach put tongue say think hurt do bit 
6,"And Sir Toady Lion, who was feeding his second-best wooden horses with wild sand-oats gathered green, remarked, ""When I have childwens I sail beat them wif a big boot and tackets in the heel.""",feed second good wooden horse wild sand oat gather green remark have childwen sail beat big boot tacket heel 
7,Which voiced with great precision Janet Sheepshanks' mood at that moment.,voice great precision mood moment 
8,"The army of Windy Standard, then, when fully mustered, consisted of General-Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith, Commander-in-Chief and regimental Sergeant-Major (also, on occasions of parade, Big Big-Drummer); Adjutant-General Cissy Carter, promoted to her present high position for always agreeing with her superior officer--a safe rule in military politics; Commissariat-Sergeant Sir Toady Lion, who declined any other post than the care of the provisions, and had to be conciliated; together with Privates Sammy Carter and Prissy Smith. Sammy Carter had formerly been Adjutant, because he had a pony, but gallantly resigned in order to be of the same rank as Prissy, who was the sole member of the force wholly without military ambition.",army windy muster consist chief regimental occasion parade big promote present high position agree superior officer safe rule military politics commissariat decline other post care provision have conciliate have pony resign order same rank sole member force military ambition 
9,"At the imposing review which was held on the plains of Windy Standard, the Commander-in-Chief insisted on carrying the blue banner himself, as well as the big-big drum, till Sammy Carter, who had not yet resigned, offered him his pony to ride upon. This he did with guile and malice aforethought, for on the drum being elevated in front of the mounted officer, Polo promptly ran away, and deposited General-Field-Marshal Smith in the horse pond.",impose review hold plain windy insist carry blue banner big big drum resign offer pony ride do guile malice aforethought drum elevate front mount officer run deposit horse pond 
10,"[""DEPOSITED GENERAL-FIELD-MARSHAL SMITH IN THE HORSE POND.""]",deposite horse pond 
11,"But this force, though officered with consummate ability, was manifestly insufficient for the attack upon the Black Sheds. This was well shown by Sammy Carter, who also pointed out that the armies of all ages had never been exclusively composed of those of noble birth. There were, for example, at Bannockburn, the knights, the esquires, the sturdy yeomanry, the spearmen, the bowmen, and the camp-followers. He advised that the stable boys, Mike and Peter, should be approached.",force officer consummate ability insufficient attack black show point army age compose noble birth be example knight esquire sturdy yeomanry spearmen bowmen camp follower advise stable boy approach 
12,"Now the head stable boy, Mike O'Donelly by name, was a scion of the noblest Bourbon race. His father was an exile, who spoke the language with a strong foreign accent, and drove a fish cart--which also had a pronounced accent, reputed deadly up to fifty yards with a favourable wind.",head stable boy name scion noblest race father exile speak language strong foreign accent drive fish cart have pronounce accent reput deadly yard favourable wind 
13,"""Foine frish hirrings--foive for sixpince!"" was the way he said it. This proved to demonstration that he came from a far land, and was the descendant of kings. When taxed directly with being the heir to a crown, he did not deny it, but said, ""Yus, Masther Smith, wanst I had a crown, but I lost it. 'Twas the Red Lion, bad scran to ut, that did the deed!""",foine frish hirring sixpince way say prove demonstration come far land descendant king tax heir crown deny say have crown lose twa red bad scran do deed 
14,"Now this was evidently only a picturesque and regal way of referring to the bloody revolution by which King Michael O'Donowitch had been dethroned and reduced to driving a fish-cart--the old, old story, doubtless, of royal license and popular ingratitude. But there was no such romantic mystery about Peter Greg. He was simply junior stable boy, and his father was general utility man--or, as it was more generally called, ""odd man,"" about the estate of Windy Standard. Peter occupied most of his time in keeping one eye on his work and the other on his father, who, on general utility principles, ""welted"" him every time that he caught him. This exercise, and his other occupation of perpetual fisticuffs with Prince Mike O'Donelly, had so developed his muscles and trained his mind, that he could lick any other two boys of his size in the parish. He said so himself, and he usually had at least one black eye to show for it. So no one contradicted him, and, indeed, who had a better right to know?",picturesque regal way refer bloody revolution dethron reduce drive fish cart old old story royal license popular ingratitude be such romantic mystery junior stable boy father general utility man call odd man estate windy occupy most time keep eye work other father general utility principle welt time catch exercise other occupation perpetual fisticuff develop muscle train mind lick other boy size parish say have least black eye show contradict have good right know 
15,"Prince Michael O'Donowitch (the improvement in style was Sammy Carter's) put the matter differently. He said, ""I can lick Peter Greg till he can't stand"" (""shtand"" was how the royal exile pronounced it), ""but Peter an' me can knock the stuffin' out of any half-dozen spalpeens in this dirthy counthry.""",improvement style put matter say lick stand shtand royal exile pronounce knock stuffin half spalpeen dirthy counthry 
16,"Both Mike and Peter received commissions in the army at the same moment. The ceremony took place at the foot of the great hay mow at the back of the stable yard. In view of his noble ancestry, Prince Michael O'Donowitch was made a major-general, and Peter a lieutenant of marines. The newly appointed officers instantly clinched, fell headlong, rolled over and over one another, pommelled each other's heads, bit, scratched, and kicked till the hay and straw flew in all directions.",receive commission army same moment ceremony take place foot great hay mow back stable yard view noble ancestry make major general lieutenant marine appoint officer clinch fall roll pommell other head bit scratch kick hay straw fly direction 
17,"When the dust finally cleared away, Peter was found sitting astride of Prince Michael, and shouting, ""Are you the general-major, or am I?""",dust clear find sit shouting general major 
18,"Then when they had risen to their feet and dusted themselves, it was found that the distinguished officers had exchanged commissions, and that Peter Greg had become major-general, while Prince Michael O'Donowitch was lieutenant of marines, with a new and promising black eye!",rise foot dust find distinguished officer exchange commission become major general lieutenant marine new promising black eye 
19,"[""GENERALS OF DIVISION, EQUAL IN RANK.""]",general division equal rank 
20,"But at the first drill, upon General Peter issuing some complicated order, such as ""Attention! eyes right!"" Lieutenant O'Donowitch remarked, ""Me eyes is as roight as yours, ye dirthy baste av a Scotchy!"" Whereupon, as the result of another appeal to arms, the former judgment was reversed, and Prince Michael regained his commission at the price of another black eye. Indeed he would have had three, but for the fact that the number of his eyes was somewhat strictly limited to two.",first drill issue complicated order such attention eye right remark eye roight baste result appeal arm former judgment reverse regain commission price black eye have fact number eye limit 
21,"Now it was felt by all parties that in a well-disciplined army such transitions were altogether too sudden, and so a compromise was suggested--as usual by Sammy Carter. Prince Michael and Peter Greg were both made generals of division, equal in rank, under Field-Marshal Smith. The division commanded by General Peter was composed of Cissy and Sir Toady Lion. The command of this first division proved, however, to be purely nominal, for Cissy was much too intimate with the Commander-in-Chief to be ordered about, and as for Toady Lion he was so high minded and irresponsible that he quite declined to obey anybody whatsoever. Still, the title was the thing, and ""the division of General Peter Greg"" sounded very well.",feel party disciplined army such transition sudden compromise suggest usual make general division equal rank division command compose command first division prove nominal intimate order high minded irresponsible decline obey title thing division sound 
22,"The other division was much more subordinate. Prissy and Sammy Carter were the only genuine privates, and they were quite ready to be commanded by General Mike, Prissy upon conscientious non-resistance principles, and Sammy with a somewhat humorous aside to his fellow-soldier that it wouldn't be very bad, because Mike's father (the royal fish-hawker) lived on Sammy's ancestral domain, and owed money to Mr. Davenant Carter.",other division subordinate prissy only genuine private ready command conscientious non-resistance principle humorous fellow soldier bad father royal fish hawker live ancestral domain owe money 
23,Thus even the iron discipline of a British army is tempered to the sacred property holder.,iron discipline british army temper sacred property holder 
24,The immediate advance of the army of Windy Standard upon the Black Sheds was only hindered by a somewhat serious indisposition which suddenly attacked the Commander-in-Chief. The facts were these.,immediate advance army windy black hinder serious indisposition attack fact 
25,"Attached to the castle, but lying between it and the stepping-stones on the steep side of the hill, was an ancient enclosed orchard. It had doubtless been the original garden of the fortress, but the trees had gone back to their primitive ""crabbiness"" (as Hugh John put it), and in consequence the children were forbidden to eat any of the fruit--an order which might just as well not have been issued. But on a day it was reported to Janet Sheepshanks that Prissy and Hugh John were in the crab orchard. On tip-toe she stole down to catch them. She caught Hugh John. Prissy was up in one of the oldest and leafiest trees, and Hugh John, as in honour bound, persistently made signals in another direction to distract attention, as he was being hauled off to condign punishment.",attach castle lie step stone steep side hill ancient enclose orchard original garden fortress tree go primitive crabbiness put consequence child forbidden eat fruit order issue day report crab orchard tip toe steal catch catch prissy old leafiest tree honour bind make signal direction distract attention haul cond punishment 
26,"He had an hour to wait in the study for his father, who was away at the county town. During this time Hugh John suffered strange qualms, not of apprehension, which presently issued in yet keener and more definitely located agony. At last Mr. Picton Smith entered.",have hour wait study father county town time suffer strange qualm apprehension issue keener locate agony last enter 
27,"""Well, sir, and what is this I hear?"" he said severely, throwing down his riding-whip on the couch as if he meant to pick it up again soon.",sir hear say throw riding whip couch mean pick 
28,"Hugh John was silent. He saw that his father knew all there was to know about his evil doings from Janet Sheepshanks, and he was far too wise to plead guilty.",silent see father know know evil doing wise plead guilty 
29,"""Did I not tell you not to go to the orchard?""",tell go orchard 
30,"Hugh John hung his head, and made a slight grimace at the pattern on the carpet, as a severer pang than any that had gone before assailed him.",hang head make slight grimace pattern carpet severer pang go assail 
31,"""Now, look here, sir,"" said his father, shaking his finger at him in a solemnising manner, ""If ever I catch you again in that orchard, I'll--I'll give you as sound a thrashing, sir, as ever you got in your life.""",look sir say father shake finger solemnising manner catch orchard give sound thrashing sir get life 
32,Hugh John rubbed his hand across his body just above the second lowest button of his jacket.,rub hand body second low button jacket 
33,"""Oh, father,"" he said plaintively, ""I wish dreadfully that you had caught me before the last time I was in the orchard.""",father say wish catch last time orchard 
34,The treatment with pills and rhubarb which followed considerably retarded the operations of the army of Windy Standard. It was not the first time that the stomach of a commander-in-chief has had an appreciable effect on the conduct of a campaign.,treatment pill rhubarb follow retarded operation army windy first time stomach commander chief have appreciable effect conduct campaign
