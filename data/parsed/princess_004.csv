But, as it became more and more plain during the evening in every motion and look, that, although she tried to amuse herself with her toys, her heart was too vexed and troubled to enjoy them, her nurse's discomfort grew and grew. When bedtime came, she undressed and laid her down, but the child, instead of holding up her little mouth to be kissed, turned away from her and lay still. Then nursie's heart gave way altogether, and she began to cry. At the sound of her first sob, the princess turned again, and held her face to kiss her as usual. But the nurse had her handkerchief to her eyes, and did not see the movement.",course nurse comfortable mind suspect least truth story love vex cross think crossness cause princess unhappiness have idea hurt believe become plain evening motion look try amuse toy heart vexed troubled enjoy nurse discomfort grow grow bedtime come undress lay child hold little mouth kiss turn lay heart give way begin cry sound first sob princess turn hold face kiss usual nurse have handkerchief eye see movement
