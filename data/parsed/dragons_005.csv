1,CHAPTER V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools,
2," The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too.",dark arch lead witch cave hang black yellow fringe live snake go keep middle arch snake lift wicked flat head stare wicked yellow eye know good manners stare course cat snake bring put tongue poor lady nasty thin sharp tongue 
3,"Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron.",husband course enchanter consider top profession wise know want child go see witch give witch address call frighten like witch sit fire stick stir bubbly shiny copper cauldron

28,"Then she said to the Queen: ""Your child will have hair as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires.

39,"So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children.

But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil.",drink stuff pot cool time go fringe snake behave good school child try drop curtsy go easy hang wrong tail snake know friend mistress course have do good civil 
40,"When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury.",get sure be baby lie cradle royal arm blazon cry possible have pink ribbon tie sleeve see girl know tore black hair fury 
41,"""Oh, you silly, silly Queen!"" he said. ""Why didn't I marry a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted--a boy, an heir, a Prince--to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and to rule the kingdom after me.

44,"The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms.

45,"The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master.",feed goldfish courtyard fountain crumb eighteenth birthday cake come courtyard look black thunder black raven hopping shake fist family do meet pretty home manners raven sit edge marble basin try peck goldfish do show same temper master

49,"And to her husband she said, ""My dear, why do you go on worrying about it?

56,"The next day his plan was all arranged. He took the poor Princess to the Lone Tower, which stands on an island in the sea, a thousand miles from everywhere. He gave her a dowry, and settled a handsome income on her. He engaged a competent dragon to look after her, and also a respectable griffin whose birth and upbringing he knew all about. And he said: ""Here you shall stay, my dear, respectful daughter, till the clever man comes to marry you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through the Nine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to kill the dragon and the griffin. Till he comes you'll never get any older or any wiser. No doubt he will soon come. You can employ yourself in embroidering your wedding gown.

57,"And his carriage, drawn by live thunderbolts (thunder travels very fast), rose in the air and disappeared, and the poor Princess was left, with the dragon and the griffin, on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools.",carriage draw live thunderbolt thunder travel rise air disappear poor leave dragon griffin 
58,"The Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and then she remembered the witch and called to her. And the witch came, and the Queen told her all.",leave home cry day night remember witch call witch come tell 
59,"""For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave me,"" said the witch, ""I will help you. But it is the last thing I can do, and it is not much.

But, if I do, you will have to be turned to stone, and to stay so till the spell is taken off the child.""",sake kisse give say witch help last thing do much daughter spell take have turn stone stay spell take child 
60,"""I would be a stone for a thousand years,"" said the poor Queen, ""if at the end of them I could see my dear again.""",stone year say poor end see dear 
61,"So the witch took the Queen in a carriage drawn by live sunbeams (which travel more quickly than anything else in the world, and much quicker than thunder), and so away and away to the Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools. And there was the Princess sitting on the floor in the best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if her heart would break, and the dragon and the griffin were sitting primly on each side of her.",witch take carriage draw live sunbeam travel else world quick thunder lone be sit floor good room lone cry heart break dragon griffin sit side 
62,"""Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother,"" she cried, and hung around the Queen's neck as if she would never let go.",cry hang neck let go 
63,"""Now,"" said the witch, when they had all cried as much as was good for them, ""I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not make the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer comes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the tower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if ever we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a happy old woman.""",say witch cry much good do other little thing time make sad day day deliverer come dear sit stone gate tower do lose witch power say spell change stone change come stone witch more happy old woman 
64,"Then the three kissed one another again and again, and the witch said the spell, and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. One of them had a stone crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand; but the other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin and the dragon could not read, though they had both had a very good education.",kiss witch say spell side door be stone lady have stone crown head stone scepter hand other hold stone tablet word griffin dragon read have good education 
65,"And now all days seemed like one day to the Princess, and the next day always seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and kiss her again. And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and some one else took his kingdom, and many things were changed in the world; but the island did not change, nor the Nine Whirlpools, nor the griffin, nor the dragon, nor the two stone ladies. And all the time, from the very first, the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming, creeping nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming except the Princess, and she only in dreams. And the years went by in tens and in hundreds, and still the Nine Whirlpools spun around, roaring in triumph the story of many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl, bearing with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess and her dowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories of the Princes who had come from very far, and had seen the whirlpools, and had shaken their wise young heads and said: ""'Bout ship!"" and gone discreetly home to their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms.",day seem day next day seem day mother come stone kiss year go wicked die one else take kingdom many thing change world island change whirlpool griffin dragon stone lady time very first day deliverance come creep see come dream year go ten hundred whirlpool spun roar triumph story many good ship go swirl bear try win dowry great sea know other story come see whirlpool shake wise young head say bout ship go nice safe comfortable kingdom 
66,But no one told the story of the deliverer who was to come. And the years went by.,tell story deliverer come year go 
67,"Now, after more scores of years than you would like to add up on your slate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the high seas with his uncle, who was a skilled skipper. And the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and keep the ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a boy as you would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy to be a Prince.",more score year like add slate certain sailor boy sail high sea uncle skilled skipper boy reef sail coil rope keep ship nose steady wind good boy find month worthy 
68,"Now there is Something which is wiser than all the world--and it knows when people are worthy to be Princes. And this Something came from the farther side of the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear.",be wise world know person worthy come far side seventh world whisper boy ear 
69,"And the boy heard, though he did not know he heard, and he looked out over the black sea with the white foam-horses galloping over it, and far away he saw a light. And he said to the skipper, his uncle: ""What light is that?""",boy hear know hear look black sea white foam horse gallop see light say skipper uncle light 
70,"Then the skipper said: ""All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing near that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked in the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me, and his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my father's father was young he heard from the very old man, his great-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess, fairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance, so never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real.""",skipper say good thing defend sail light mention chart mark old chart steer father father father father light shine lone stand father father young hear old man great great grandfather tower enchanted fair day wait deliver be deliverance steer way think more idle tale whirlpool real 
71,"So, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing else. And as he sailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time the light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine Whirlpools. And one night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper asleep in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered alone over the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go very near till daylight should show him what, indeed, were the whirlpools he had to dread.",course day think else sail high sea see time time light shine sea wild swirl night ship anchor skipper asleep bunk launch ship boat steer dark sea light go daylight show whirlpool have dread 
72,"But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the pink and primrose of the East, and about its base the sullen swirl of black water, and he heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and on, all that day and for six days besides. And when he had watched seven days he knew something. For you are certain to know something if you give for seven days your whole thought to it, even though it be only the first declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the Norman Kings.",dawn come see lone stand dark pink primrose base sullen swirl black water hear wonderful roar hang day day watch day know certain know give day whole thought first declension time table date 
73,"What he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the 1,440 minutes that make up a day the whirlpools slipped into silence, while the tide went down and left the yellow sand bare. And every day this happened, but every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day before. He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he had thoughtfully brought with him.",know minute minute make day whirlpool slip silence tide go leave yellow sand bare day happen day minute day make sure ship chronometer bring 
74,"[""The Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools."" _See page 88._]",lone see page 
75,"So on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel got ready. And when the whirlpools suddenly stopped whirling and the tide sank, like water in a basin that has a hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put his back into his stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow sand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to wait.",eighth day minute noon get ready whirlpool stop whirl tide sink water basin have hole stick oar put back stroke beach boat yellow sand drag cave sit wait 
76,"By five minutes and one second past noon, the whirlpools were black and busy again, and Nigel peeped out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge overhanging the sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with golden hair and a green gown--and he went out to meet her.",minute second noon whirlpool black busy peep cave rocky ledge overhang sea see beautiful day golden hair green gown go meet 
77,"""I've come to save you,"" he said. ""How darling and beautiful you are!""",come save say darling beautiful 
78,"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands.",good clever dear say smile give hand 
79,He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.,shut little kiss hand let go 
80,"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"" he said.",tide low take boat say 
81,"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess.",dragon ask 
82,"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?""",say know suppose kill 
83,"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!""",silly boy say pretend grow island time know many year like pretend have sword shield 
84,"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?""",beast go sleep 
85,"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before.""",say hour dragon turn stone griffin have dream griffin sleep teatime day dragon sleep day minute day minute day

89,"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them.""",say good 
90,"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days.""",say slow work make unhappy take day day 
91,"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself.""",begin say have plenty time unhappy tell 
92,So he did. And then she told him all about herself.,tell 
93,"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework--his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking--he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready.""",know long time say know time busy sew silk flower golden gown wedding day do housework wing convenient feathery sweep dust dragon do cooking hot course trouble know time sure time wedding day golden gown want more white daisy sleeve lily bosom ready 
94,"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly. ""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic.",hear dry rustle clatter rock snort sound dragon say good bye good boy get sum do run leave arithmetic 
95,"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?""",sum whirlpool stop tide go hour do minute hour dragon sleep day do minute day many day time day tide go minute dragon fall asleep 
96,"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right.",simple sum see do minute good school take pain lesson poor sit work sum piece chalk smooth stone try practice unitary method multiplication rule quarter try decimal compound interest try square root cube root try addition simple try mix example vulgar fraction use try do sum algebra simple quadratic equation trigonometry logarithm conic section do get answer time true different one feel sure answer right

98,"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it.

And it came right every time.",dear say know right answer say r see prove work sum decimal equation conic section rule think come time 
103,"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited.",wait say wait 
104,"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans.",day come see bring food cook dragon live cave talk think happy long day summer last come lay plan

108,"So when the tide began to go down, Nigel and the Princess ran out on to the sands, and there, in full sight of the terrace where the dragon kept watch, Nigel took his Princess in his arms and kissed her. The griffin was busy sweeping the stairs of the Lone Tower, but the dragon saw, and he gave a cry of rage--and it was like twenty engines all letting off steam at the top of their voices inside Cannon Street Station.",tide begin go run sand full sight terrace dragon keep watch take arm kiss busy sweep stair lone dragon see give cry rage engine let steam top voice 
109,"And the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. He was dreadful to look at. His head was white with age--and his beard had grown so long that he caught his claws in it as he walked. His wings were white with the salt that had settled on them from the spray of the sea. His tail was long and thick and jointed and white, and had little legs to it, any number of them--far too many--so that it looked like a very large fat silkworm; and his claws were as long as lessons and as sharp as bayonets.",lover stand look dragon dreadful look head white age beard grow catch claw walk wing white salt settle spray sea tail long thick jointed white have little leg number many look large fat silkworm claw lesson sharp bayonet

111,"The dragon was clambering down the face of the cliff, and next moment he was crawling and writhing and sprawling and wriggling across the beach after Nigel, making great holes in the sand with his heavy feet--and the very end of his tail, where there were no legs, made, as it dragged, a mark in the sand such as you make when you launch a boat; and he breathed fire till the wet sand hissed again, and the water of the little rock pools got quite frightened, and all went off in steam.",dragon clamber face cliff next moment crawl writhe sprawl wriggle beach make great hole sand heavy foot very end tail be leg make drag mark sand such make launch boat breathe fire wet sand hiss water little rock pool get frighten go steam 
112,"Still Nigel held on and the dragon after him. The Princess could see nothing for the steam, and she stood crying bitterly, but still holding on tight with her right hand to the other end of the cord that Nigel had told her to hold; while with her left she held the ship's chronometer, and looked at it through her tears as he had bidden her look, so as to know when to pull the rope.",hold dragon see steam stand cry hold tight right hand other end cord tell hold left hold ship chronometer look tear bidd look know pull rope

114,"Now at the lip of the water, Nigel paused and looked back, and the dragon made a bound, beginning a scream of rage that was like all the engines of all the railways in England. But it never uttered the second half of that scream, for now it knew suddenly that it was sleepy--it turned to hurry back to dry land, because sleeping near whirlpools is so unsafe. But before it reached the shore sleep caught it and turned it to stone. Nigel, seeing this, ran shoreward for his life--and the tide began to flow in, and the time of the whirlpools' sleep was nearly over, and he stumbled and he waded and he swam, and the Princess pulled for dear life at the cord in her hand, and pulled him up on to the dry shelf of rock just as the great sea dashed in and made itself once more into the girdle of Nine Whirlpools all around the island.",lip water pause look dragon make bind begin scream rage engine railway utter second half scream know sleepy turn hurry dry land sleep whirlpool unsafe reach shore sleep catch turn stone see run shoreward life tide begin flow time whirlpool sleep stumble wade swim pull dear life cord hand pull dry shelf rock great sea dash make girdle island 
115,"But the dragon was asleep under the whirlpools, and when he woke up from being asleep he found he was drowned, so there was an end of him.",dragon asleep whirlpool wake asleep find drown be end 
116,"""Now, there's only the griffin,"" said Nigel. And the Princess said: ""Yes--only--"" And she kissed Nigel and went back to sew the last leaf of the last lily on the bosom of her wedding gown. She thought and thought of what was written on the stone about the griffin being artificial--and next day she said to Nigel: ""You know a griffin is half a lion and half an eagle, and the other two halves when they've joined make the leo-griff. But I've never seen him. Yet I have an idea.""",be griffin say say kiss go sew last leaf last lily bosom wedding gown think think write stone griffin artificial next day say know lion eagle other half join make leo griff see have idea 
117,So they talked it over and arranged everything.,talk arrange 
118,"When the griffin fell asleep that afternoon at teatime, Nigel went softly behind him and trod on his tail, and at the same time the Princess cried: ""Look out! There's a lion behind you.""",griffin fall afternoon teatime go trod tail same time cry look be lion 
119,"And the griffin, waking suddenly from his dreams, twisted his large neck around to look for the lion, saw a lion's flank, and fastened its eagle beak in it. For the griffin had been artificially made by the King-enchanter, and the two halves had never really got used to each other. So now the eagle half of the griffin, who was still rather sleepy, believed that it was fighting a lion, and the lion part, being half asleep, thought it was fighting an eagle, and the whole griffin in its deep drowsiness hadn't the sense to pull itself together and remember what it was made of. So the griffin rolled over and over, one end of it fighting with the other, till the eagle end pecked the lion end to death, and the lion end tore the eagle end with its claws till it died. And so the griffin that was made of a lion and an eagle perished, exactly as if it had been made of Kilkenny cats.",griffin wake dream twist large neck look lion see lion flank fasten eagle beak make enchanter half use other eagle half griffin sleepy believe fight lion lion part half asleep think fight eagle whole griffin deep drowsiness have sense pull remember make griffin roll end fight other eagle end peck lion end death lion end tore eagle end claw die griffin make lion eagle perish make cat 
120,"""Poor griffin,"" said the Princess, ""it was very good at the housework. I always liked it better than the dragon: It wasn't so hot-tempered.""",poor say good housework like good dragon hot temper 
121,"At that moment there was a soft, silky rush behind the Princess, and there was her mother, the Queen, who had slipped out of the stone statue at the moment the griffin was dead, and now came hurrying to take her dear daughter in her arms. The witch was clambering slowly off her pedestal. She was a little stiff from standing still so long.",moment be soft silky rush be mother slip stone statue moment griffin dead come hurry take dear daughter arm witch clamber pedestal little stiff stand 
122,"When they had all explained everything over and over to each other as many times as was good for them, the witch said: ""Well, but what about the whirlpools?""",explain other many time good witch say whirlpool 
123,"And Nigel said he didn't know. Then the witch said: ""I'm not a witch anymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I know some things still. Those whirlpools were made by the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his blood into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has been trying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the whirlpools. Now you've only got to go out at low tide.""",say know witch say witch happy old woman know thing whirlpool make enchanter drop drop blood sea blood wicked sea try get rid make whirlpool get go low tide 
124,"So Nigel understood and went out at low tide, and found in the sandy hollow left by the first whirlpool a great red ruby. That was the first drop of the wicked King's blood. The next day Nigel found another, and next day another, and so on till the ninth day, and then the sea was as smooth as glass.",understand go low tide find sandy hollow leave first whirlpool great red ruby first drop wicked blood next day find next day ninth day sea smooth glass 
125,"The nine rubies were used afterwards in agriculture. You had only to throw them out into a field if you wanted it plowed. Then the whole surface of the land turned itself over in its anxiety to get rid of something so wicked, and in the morning the field was found to be plowed as thoroughly as any young man at Oxford. So the wicked King did some good after all.",ruby use agriculture have throw field want plow whole surface land turn anxiety get rid wicked morning field find plow young man wicked do good 
126,"When the sea was smooth, ships came from far and wide, bringing people to hear the wonderful story. And a beautiful palace was built, and the Princess was married to Nigel in her gold dress, and they all lived happily as long as was good for them.",sea smooth ship come wide bring person hear wonderful story beautiful palace build marry gold dress live good 
127,"The dragon still lies, a stone dragon on the sand, and at low tide the little children play around him and over him. But the pieces that were left of the griffin were buried under the herb-bed in the palace garden, because it had been so good at housework, and it wasn't its fault that it had been made so badly and put to such poor work as guarding a lady from her lover.",dragon lie stone dragon sand low tide little child play piece leave griffin bury herb bed palace garden good housework fault make put such poor work guard lady lover 
128,"I have no doubt that you will wish to know what the Princess lived on during the long years when the dragon did the cooking. My dear, she lived on her income--and that is a thing that a great many people would like to be able to do.",have doubt wish know live long year dragon do cooking dear live income thing great many person like able do
