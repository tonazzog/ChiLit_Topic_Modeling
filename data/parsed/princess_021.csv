1,CHAPTER XXI. THE ESCAPE,escape 
2," AS the princess lay and sobbed, she kept feeling the thread mechanically, following it with her finger many times up the stones in which it disappeared. By and by she began, still mechanically, to poke her finger in after it between the stones as far as she could. All at once it came into her head that she might remove some of the stones and see where the thread went next. Almost laughing at herself for never having thought of this before, she jumped to her feet. Her fear vanished: once more she was certain her grandmother's thread could not have brought her there just to leave her there; and she began to throw away the stones from the top as fast as she could, sometimes two or three at a handful, sometimes taking both hands to lift one. After clearing them away a little, she found that the thread turned and went straight downward. Hence, as the heap sloped a good deal, growing of course wider toward its base, she had to throw away a multitude of stones to follow the thread. But this was not all, for she soon found that the thread, after going straight down for a little way, turned first sideways in one direction, then sideways in another, and then shot, at various angles, hither and thither inside the heap, so that she began to be afraid that to clear the thread, she must remove the whole huge gathering. She was dismayed at the very idea, but, losing no time, set to work with a will; and with aching back, and bleeding fingers and hands, she worked on, sustained by the pleasure of seeing the heap slowly diminish, and begin to show itself on the opposite side of the fire. Another thing which helped to keep up her courage was, that as often as she uncovered a turn of the thread, instead of lying loose upon the stones, it tightened up; this made her sure that her grandmother was at the end of it somewhere.",princess lay sobb keep feel thread follow finger many time stone disappear begin poke finger stone come head remove stone see thread go laugh think jump foot fear vanish more certain grandmother thread bring leave begin throw stone top handful take hand lift clear little find thread turn go heap slope good deal grow course wide base have throw multitude stone follow thread find thread go little way turn direction shoot various angle heap begin afraid clear thread remove whole huge gathering dismay very idea lose time set work will ach back bleed finger hand work sustain pleasure see heap diminish begin show opposite side fire thing help keep courage uncover turn thread lie stone tighten make sure grandmother end

30,"""You will see when you get out of here,"" answered the princess, and then she went on harder than ever.",see get answer princess go hard 
31,"But she was soon satisfied that what Curdie wanted done, and what the thread wanted done, were one and the same thing. For she not only saw that by following the turns of the thread she had been clearing the face of the slab, but that, a little more than half way down, the thread went through the chink between the slab and the wall into the place where Curdie was confined, so that she could not follow it any farther until the slab was out of her way. As soon as she found this, she said in a right joyous whisper--",satisfied want do thread want do same thing see follow turn thread clear face slab little more half way thread go chink slab wall place confine follow slab way find say right joyous whisper 
32,"""Now, Curdie! I think if you were to give a great push, the slab would tumble over.""",think give great push slab tumble

34,"Irene got off the heap, and stood on one side of it.",get heap stand side 
35,"""Now, Curdie!"" she cried.",cry

38,"""Oh, Curdie! I'm so glad! Let's get out of this horrid place as fast as we can.""",glad let get horrid place 
39,"""That's easier said than done,"" returned he.",easy say do return 
40,"""Oh, no! it's quite easy,"" said Irene. ""We have only to follow my thread. I am sure that it's going to take us out now.""",easy say have follow thread sure go take 
41,"She had already begun to follow it over the fallen slab into the hole, while Curdie was searching the floor of the cavern for his pickaxe.",begin follow fall slab hole search floor cavern pickaxe 
42,"[Curdie went on after her, flashing his torch about.]",go flash torch 
43,"""Here it is!"" he cried. ""No, it is not!"" he added, in a disappointed tone. ""What can it be then?--I declare it's a torch. That _is_ jolly! It's better almost than my pickaxe. Much better if it weren't for those stone shoes!"" he went on, as he lighted the torch by blowing the last embers of the expiring fire.",cry add disappointed tone declare torch jolly good pickaxe good stone shoe go light torch blow last ember expire fire 
44,"When he looked up, with the lighted torch casting a glare into the great darkness of the huge cavern, he caught sight of Irene disappearing in the hole out of which he had himself just come.",look light torch cast glare great darkness huge cavern catch sight disappear hole have come 
45,"""Where are you going there?"" he cried. ""That's not the way out. That's where I couldn't get out.""",go cry way get 
46,"""I know that,"" whispered Irene. ""But this is the way my thread goes, and I must follow it.""",know whisper way thread go follow 
47,"""What nonsense the child talks!"" said Curdie to himself. ""I must follow her, though, and see that she comes to no harm. She will soon find she can't get out that way, and then she will come with me.""",nonsense child talk say follow see come harm find get way come 
48,"So he crept once more over the slab into the hole with his torch in his hand. But when he looked about in it, he could see her nowhere. And now he discovered that although the hole was narrow, it was much larger than he had supposed; for in one direction the roof came down very low, and the hole went off in a narrow passage, of which he could not see the end. The princess must have crept in there. He got on his knees and one hand, holding the torch with the other, and crept after her. The hole twisted about, in some parts so low that he could hardly get through, in others so high that he could not see the roof, but everywhere it was narrow--far too narrow for a goblin to get through, and so I presume they never thought that Curdie might. He was beginning to feel very uncomfortable lest he could not see the end. The princess when he heard her voice almost close to his ear, whispering--",creep slab hole torch hand look see discover hole narrow large suppose direction roof come low hole go narrow passage see end princess creep get knee hand hold torch other creep hole twist part low get other high see roof narrow narrow goblin get presume think begin feel uncomfortable see end princess hear voice close ear whisper

50,"And when he turned the next corner, there she stood waiting for him.",turn next corner stand wait 
51,"""I knew you couldn't go wrong in that narrow hole, but now you must keep by me, for here is a great wide place,"" she said.",know go wrong narrow hole keep great wide place say 
52,"""I can't understand it,"" said Curdie, half to himself, half to Irene.",understand say half half 
53,"""Never mind,"" she returned. ""Wait till we get out.""",mind return wait get 
54,"Curdie, utterly astonished that she had already got so far, and by a path he had known nothing of, thought it better to let her do as she pleased.",astonished get path know think good let do pleased 
55,"""At all events,"" he said again to himself, ""I know nothing about the way, miner as I am; and she seems to think she does know something about it, though how she should, passes my comprehension. So she's just as likely to find her way as I am, and as she insists on taking the lead, I must follow. We can't be much worse off than we are, anyhow.""",event say know way miner seem think know pass comprehension likely find way insist take lead follow bad 
56,"Reasoning thus, he followed her a few steps, and came out in another great cavern, across which Irene walked in a straight line, as confidently as if she knew every step of the way. Curdie went on after her, flashing his torch about, and trying to see something of what lay around them. Suddenly he started back a pace as the light fell upon something close by which Irene was passing. It was a platform of rock raised a few feet from the floor and covered with sheep skins, upon which lay two horrible figures asleep, at once recognized by Curdie as the king and queen of the goblins. He lowered his torch instantly lest the light should awake them. As he did so, it flashed upon his pickaxe, lying by the side of the queen, whose hand lay close by the handle of it.",reason follow few step come great cavern walk straight line know step way go flash torch try see lay start pace light fall close pass platform rock raise few foot floor cover sheep skin lay horrible figure asleep recognize king queen goblin lower torch light awake do flash pickaxe lie side queen hand lay close handle 
57,"""Stop one moment,"" he whispered. ""Hold my torch, and don't let the light on their faces.""",stop moment whisper hold torch let light face 
58,"Irene shuddered when she saw the frightful creatures whom she had passed without observing them, but she did as he requested, and turning her back, held the torch low in front of her. Curdie drew his pickaxe carefully away, and as he did so, spied one of her feet, projecting from under the skins. The great clumsy granite shoe, exposed thus to his hand, was a temptation not to be resisted. He laid hold of it, and with cautious efforts, drew it off. The moment he succeeded, he saw to his astonishment that what he had sung in ignorance, to annoy the queen, was actually true: she had six horrible toes. Overjoyed at his success, and seeing by the huge bump in the sheep skins where the other foot was, he proceeded to lift them gently, for, if he could only succeed in carrying away the other shoe as well, he would be no more afraid of the goblins than of so many flies. But as he pulled at the second shoe, the queen gave a growl and sat up in bed. The same instant the king awoke also, and sat up beside her.",shudder see frightful creature pass observe request turn hold torch low front draw pickaxe spy foot project skin great clumsy granite shoe expose hand temptation resist lay hold cautious effort draw moment succeed see astonishment sung ignorance annoy queen true have horrible toe overjoy success see huge bump sheep skin other foot proceed lift succeed carry other shoe afraid goblin many fly pull second shoe queen give growl sit bed same instant king awoke sit 
59,"""Run, Irene!"" cried Curdie, for though he was not now in the least afraid for himself, he was for the princess.",cry least afraid princess 
60,"Irene looked once round, saw the fearful creatures awake, and like the wise princess she was, dashed the torch on the ground and extinguished it, crying out--",look see fearful creature awake wise princess dash torch ground extinguish cry 
61,"""Here, Curdie, take my hand.""",take hand 
62,"He darted to her side, forgetting neither the queen's shoe nor his pickaxe, and caught hold of her hand, as she sped fearlessly where her thread guided her. They heard the queen give a great bellow; but they had a good start, for it would be some time before they could get torches lighted to pursue them. Just as they thought they saw a gleam behind them, the thread brought them to a very narrow opening, through which Irene crept easily, and Curdie with difficulty.",dart side forget queen shoe pickaxe catch hold hand spe thread guide hear queen give great bellow have good start time get torche light pursue think see gleam thread bring narrow opening creep difficulty

75,"""Their own people do, though,"" answered Curdie.",own person answer 
76,"The princess asked more questions, and Curdie, as they walked leisurely along, gave her a full account, not only of the character and habits of the goblins, so far as he knew them, but of his own adventures with them, beginning from the very night after that in which he had met her and Lootie upon the mountain. When he had finished, he begged Irene to tell him how it was that she had come to his rescue. So Irene too had to tell a long story, which she did in rather a roundabout manner, interrupted by many questions concerning things she had not explained. But her tale, as he did not believe more than half of it, left everything as unaccountable to him as before, and he was nearly as much perplexed as to what he must think of the princess. He could not believe that she was deliberately telling stories, and the only conclusion he could come to was that Lootie had been playing the child tricks, inventing no end of lies to frighten her for her own purposes.",princess ask more question walk give full account character habit goblin know own adventure begin very night meet mountain finish begg tell come rescue have tell long story do roundabout manner interrupt many question concern thing explain tale believe more half leave unaccountable perplexed think princess believe tell story only conclusion come play child trick invent end lie frighten own purpose

They went on, down and down with the running water, Curdie getting more and more afraid it was leading them to some terrible gulf in the heart of the mountain. In one or two places he had to break away the rock to make room before even Irene could get through--at least without hurting herself. But at length they spied a glimmer of light, and in a minute more, they were almost blinded by the full sunlight into which they emerged. It was some little time before the princess could see well enough to discover that they stood in her own garden, close by the seat on which she and her king-papa had sat that afternoon. They had come out by the channel of the little stream.
