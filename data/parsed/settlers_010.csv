1,CHAPTER 10. GRAVES IN THE LEVELS.,levels 
2,"Oliver so much wished that the next day (Sunday, and the day of his little brother's funeral) should be one of rest and decent quiet, that he worked extremely hard, as long as the light lasted, and was glad of all the help the rest of the party could give.",wish next day day little brother funeral rest decent quiet work light last glad help rest party give 
3,"To make an excavation large enough for the body was no difficult task;-- the earth being soft, and easily removed from the trunks, roots, and branches of buried trees, which seemed to run all through the interior of the bank.  But the five stones with which the grave was to be lined were of considerable thickness; and Oliver chose to have them nicely fitted in, that no living creature should be able to enter this place sacred to the dead.",make excavation large body difficult task earth soft remove trunk root branch bury tree seem run interior bank stone grave line considerable thickness choose have fit living creature able enter place sacred dead 
4,"How astonished were they all to find that this was already a place of the dead!  While Ailwin was holding one of the stones against one end of the excavation, and Oliver was striking and fixing it with the great hammer, Roger was emptying out soil from the other end.  He exclaimed that he had come upon some large thing made of leather.",astonished find place dead hold stone end excavation strike fix great hammer empty soil other end exclaim come large thing make leather 
5,"""I dare say you have,"" said Ailwin.  ""There are all manner of things found by those who dig in the Levels--except useful things, I mean.  No one ever knew anything useful come out of these odd places.""",say say be manner thing find dig level useful thing mean know useful come odd place 
6,"""You are wrong there,"" said Roger.  ""I have got useful things myself from under the carr, that brought me more money than any fish and fowl I ever took out of the ponds on it.  Uncle and I found some old red earthenware things...""",wrong say get useful thing carr bring more money fish fowl take pond find old red earthenware thing 
7,"""Old red earthenware!"" exclaimed Ailwin.  ""As if old earthenware was better than fish and fowl, when there is so much new to be had now-a-days!  My uncle is a sailor, always going between this and Holland; and he says the quantity of ware they bring over in a year will hold victuals for all Lincolnshire.  And Dutch ware does not cost above half what it did in my grandfather's time: so don't you be telling your wonderful tales, Roger.  We sha'n't believe them.""",old red earthenware exclaim old earthenware good fish fowl be much new have day uncle sailor go say quantity ware bring year hold victual dutch ware cost half do grandfather time tell wonderful tale believe 
8,"""Well, then don't.  But I say again, uncle Stephen and I took gold for the old red ware we got out of a deep hole in the carr.""",say uncle take gold old red ware get deep hole carr 
9,"""Very likely, indeed.  I wonder who has gold to throw away in that manner.  However, I don't say but there may be such.  `Fools and their money are soon parted,' some folks say.""",likely wonder have gold throw manner say be such fool money part folk say 
10,"""Who gave you the gold?"" asked Oliver.",give gold ask 
11,"""You may ask that,"" said Roger; ""but you may not believe me when I tell you.  You know the Earl of Arundel comes sometimes into these parts. Well,--it was he.""",ask say believe tell know come part 
12,"""When?  Why?""",
13,"""He often comes down to see the Trent, having the care of the forests upon it: and one time he stopped near here, on his way into Scotland, about some business.  They say he has a castle full of wonderful things somewhere.""",come see have care forest time stop way business say have castle full wonderful thing

15,"""Perhaps,"" replied Roger, ""But I heard nothing of them.  What I heard of was old bricks, and stone figures, and all manner of stone jars.  Well, a gentleman belonging to the Earl of Arundel chanced to come across us, just after we had found a pitcher or two down in the moss; and he made us go with him to the Earl...""",reply hear hear old brick stone figure manner stone jar gentleman belong chance come find pitcher moss make go

18,"Ailwin muttered that she did not believe a word of it; but her altered manner towards Roger at the moment, and ever after, showed that she did.",mutter believe word alter manner moment show 
19,"""He asked us all manner of questions about the Levels,"" continued Roger:--""I mean about the things that lie in the moss.  He did not seem to care about the settlers and the crops, otherwise than in the way of business.  All that he did about the earthenware was plainly for his pleasure.  He bought all we could find on that spot; and he said if we found any more curiosities at any time, we were ...  But I can't stand talking any more.""",ask manner question continue mean thing lie moss seem care settler crop way business do earthenware pleasure buy find spot say find more curiosity time stand talk more 
20,And Roger glanced with suspicious eyes from the piece of leather (as he called it) that he had met with in the bank to Oliver.  He wanted to have the sole benefit of this new discovery.,glance suspicious eye piece leather call meet bank want have sole benefit new discovery 
21,"""And what were you to do, if you found anything more?"" asked Ailwin. ""One might easily bury some of the ware my uncle brings, and keep it in the moss till it is well wetted; and then some earl might give one gold for it.  Come, Roger, tell me what you were to do with your findings. You owe it to me to tell me; considering that your people have got away my cloak and warm stockings.""",do find more ask bury ware uncle bring keep moss wett earl give gold come tell do finding owe tell consider person get cloak warm stocking

23,Not a word more would he say of his own concerns.,word say own concern 
24,"Oliver did not want to hear more.  On being told of the Earl of Arundel's statues and vases, he had, for a moment, longed to see them, and wondered whether there were any alabaster cups in the collection; but his thoughts were presently with George again.  He remembered that Mildred had been left long enough alone with the body; and he dismissed Ailwin, saying that he himself should soon have done, it was now growing so dark.",want hear more tell statue vase moment long see wonder be alabaster cup collection thought remember leave alone body dismiss say do grow dark 
25,"As he worked on silently and thoughtfully, Roger supposed he was observing nothing; and therefore ventured, turning his back on Oliver, to investigate a little more closely the leathern curiosity he had met with.  He disengaged the earth more and more, drew something out, and started at what he saw.",work suppose observe venture turn back investigate little leathern curiosity meet disengage earth more draw start see 
26,"""You _have_ found a curiosity,"" observed Oliver, quietly.  ""That is a mummy.""",find curiosity observe mummy 
27,"""No--'tis a man,"" exclaimed Roger, in some agitation.  ""At least it is something like a man.  Is not this like an arm, with a hand at the end of it?--a little dried, shrunk, ugly arm.  'Tis not stiff, neither. Look!  It can't be Uncle Stephen, sure--or Nan!""",man exclaim agitation least man arm hand end little dry shrink ugly arm stiff look sure 
28,"""No, no: it is a mummy--a human body which has been buried for hundreds and thousands of years.""",mummy human body bury hundred thousand year 
29,"Roger had never heard of a mummy; and there was no great wonder in that, when even Oliver did not rightly know the meaning of the word.  All animal bodies (and not only human bodies) which remain dry, by any means, instead of putrefying, are called mummies.",hear mummy be great wonder know meaning word animal body human body remain dry means putrefy call mummy 
30,"""What do you mean by hundreds and thousands of years?"" said Roger. ""Look here, how the arm bends, and the wrist!  I believe I could make its fingers close on mine,"" he continued, stepping back--evidently afraid of the remains which lay before him.  ""If I was sure now, that it was not Stephen or Nan ...  But the peat water does wonders, they say, with whatever lies in it.""",mean hundred thousand year say look arm bend wrist believe make finger close continue step afraid remains lay sure peat water wonder say lie

32,"And Oliver took from Roger's hand the slip of wood with which he had been working, and began to clear out more soil about the figure.",take hand slip wood work begin clear more soil figure 
33,"""Don't, don't now!"" exclaimed Roger.  ""Don't uncover the face!  If you do, I will go away.""",exclaim uncover face go 
34,"""Go, then,"" replied Oliver.  It appeared as if the bold boy and the timid one had changed characters.  The reason was that Roger had some very disagreeable thoughts connected with Stephen and Nan Redfurn.  He never forgot, when their images were before him, that they had died in the midst of angry and contemptuous feelings between them and him. Oliver, on the other hand, was religious.  Though, in easy times, more afraid than he ought to have been of dishonest and violent persons, he had yet enough trust in God to support his spirits and his hope in trial, as we have seen: and about death and the grave, and the other world, where he believed the dead went to meet their Maker and Father, he had no fear at all.  Nothing that Roger now said, therefore, made him desist, till he had uncovered half the dried body.",go reply appear bold boy timid one change character reason have disagreeable thought connect forget image die midst angry contemptuous feeling other hand religious easy time afraid dishonest violent person have enough trust support spirit hope trial see death grave other world believe dead go meet have fear say make desist uncover dry body 
35,"""Look here!"" said he--for Roger had not gone away as he had threatened--""come closer and look, or you will see nothing in the dusk. Did either Stephen or Nan wear their hair this way?  And is this dress anything like Ailwin's cloak?  Look at the long black hair hanging all round the little flat brown face.  And the dress: it is the skin of some beast, with the hair left on--a rough-edged skin, fastened with a bit of something like coal on the left shoulder.  I dare say it was once a wooden skewer.  I wonder how long ago this body was alive.  I wonder what sort of a country this was to live in, at that day.""",look say go threaten come close look see dusk wear hair way dress cloak look long black hair hang little flat brown face dress skin beast hair leave rough edged skin fasten bit coal left shoulder say wooden skewer wonder body alive wonder sort country live day 
36,"Roger's fear having now departed, his more habitual feelings again prevailed.",fear depart habitual feeling prevail 
37,"""I say,"" said he, returning to the spot, and wrenching the tool from Oliver's hand; ""I say--don't you meddle any more.  The curiosity is mine, you know.  I found it, and it's mine.""",say say return spot wrench tool hand say meddle more curiosity know find 
38,"""What will you do with it?"" asked Oliver, who saw that, even now, Roger rather shrank from touching the limbs, and turned away from the open eyes of the body.",do ask see shrank touch limb turn open eye body 
39,"""It will make a show.  If I don't happen to see the earl, so as to get gold for it, I'll make people give me a penny a piece to see it; and that will be as good as gold presently.""",make show happen see earl get gold make person give penny piece see good gold 
40,"""I wish you would bury it,"" earnestly exclaimed Oliver, as the thought occurred to him that the time might come, though perhaps hundreds of years hence, when dear little George's body might be found in like manner.  He could not endure the idea of that body being ever made a show of.",wish bury exclaim thought occur time come hundred year dear little body find like manner endure idea body make show 
41,"Of course, Roger would not hear of giving up his treasure; and Oliver was walking away, when Roger called after him--",course hear give treasure walk call 
42,"""Don't go yet, Oliver.  Wait a minute, and I will come with you.""",go wait minute come 
43,"Oliver proceeded, however, thinking that Roger would have to acquire some courage yet before he could carry about his mummy for a show.",proceed think have acquire courage carry mummy show 
44,"Oliver was only going for Mildred--to let her see, before it was quite dark, what had been done, and what found.  When they returned, Roger was standing at some distance from the bank, apparently watching his mummy as it lay in the cleft that he had cleared.  He started when he heard Mildred's gentle voice exclaiming at its being so small and so dark-coloured.  She next wondered how old it was.",go let see dark do find return stand distance bank watch mummy lay cleft clear start hear gentle voice exclaim small dark coloured wonder old 
45,"After the boys had examined the ground again, and put together all they had heard about the ancient condition of the Levels, they agreed that this person must have been buried, or have died alone in the woods, before the district became a marsh.  Pastor Dendel had told Oliver about the thick forest that covered these lands when the Romans invaded Britain; and how the inhabitants fled to the woods, and so hid themselves there that the Roman soldiers had to cut down the woods to get at them; and how the trees, falling across the courses of the streams, dammed them up, so that the surrounding soil was turned into a swamp; and how mosses and water-plants grew over the fallen trees, and became matted together, so that more vegetation grew on the top of that, till the ancient forest was, at length, quite buried in the carr. Oliver now reminded his sister of all this: and they looked with a kind of veneration on the form which they supposed was probably that of an ancient Briton, who, flying from the invaders, into the recesses of the forest, had perished there alone.  There was no appearance of his having been buried.  No earthen vessels, or other remains, such as were usually found in the graves of the ancients, appeared to be contained in the bank.  If he had died lying along the ground, his body would have decayed like other bodies, or been devoured by wild beasts.  Perhaps he was drowned in one of the ponds or streams of the forest, and the body, being immediately washed over with sand or mud, was thus preserved.",boy examine ground put hear ancient condition level agree person bury die wood district become marsh tell thick forest cover land invade inhabitant flead wood hide roman soldier have cut wood get tree fall course stream damm surround soil turn swamp mosse water plant grow fall tree become matt more vegetation grow top ancient forest length bury carr remind sister look kind veneration form suppose ancient fly invader recesse forest perish be appearance bury earthen vessel other remains such find grave ancient appear contain bank die lie ground body decay other body devoure wild beast drown pond stream forest body wash sand mud preserve 
46,"""What is the use of guessing and guessing?"" exclaimed Roger.  ""If people should dig up George's bones, out of this bank, a thousand years hence, and find them lying in a sort of oven, as they would call it, with a fine carved stone for one of the six sides, do you think they could ever guess how all these things came to be here?""",use guess guess exclaim person dig bone bank year find lie sort oven call fine carve stone side think guess thing come 
47,"""This way of burying is an accident, such as no one would think of guessing,"" said Oliver, sighing.  ""And this dried body may be here, to be sure, by some other accident that we know nothing about.  I really wish, Roger, you would cover up the corpse again; at least, till we know whether we shall all die together here.""",way bury accident such think guess say sigh dry body sure other accident know wish cover corpse least know die 
48,"This was what Roger could never bear to hear of.  He always ran away from it: and so he did now.  Dark as it was growing, he passed over to the house, and mounted the staircase (which stood as firm as ever, and looked something like a self-supported ladder).  While he was vainly looking abroad for boats, which the shadows of the evening would have prevented his seeing if they had been there by hundreds, the brother and sister speculated on one thing more, in connection with the spectacle which had powerfully excited their imaginations.  Mildred whispered to Oliver--",bear hear run dark grow pass house mount staircase stand firm look self support ladder look boat shadow evening prevent see hundred brother sister speculate thing more connection spectacle excite imagination whisper 
49,"""If this old man and George lie together here, I wonder whether their spirits will know it, and come together in heaven.""",old man lie wonder spirit know come heaven 
50,"They talked for some time about the difference there must be between the thoughts of an ancient Briton, skin-clothed, a hunter of the wolf, and living on the acorns and wild animals of the forest, and the mind of a little child, reared in the Levels, and nourished and amused between the farm-yard and the garden.  Yet they agreed that there must have been some things in which two so different thought and felt alike.  The sky was over the heads of both, and the air around them, and the grass spread under their feet:--both, too, had, no doubt, had relations, by whom they had been beloved: and there is no saying how many things may become known alike to all, on entering upon the life after death. Oliver and Mildred resolved that if ever they should see Pastor Dendel again, they would ask him what he thought of all this.  They agreed that they would offer to help Roger to seek for other curiosities, to make a show of; and would give him, for his own, all they could find, if he would but consent to bury this body again, decently, and beside little George.",talk time difference thought ancient skin cloth hunter wolf live acorn wild animal forest mind little child rear nourish amuse farm yard garden agree be thing different thought feel alike sky head air grass spread foot doubt have relation beloved be say many thing become know alike enter life death resolve see ask think agree offer help seek other curiosity make show give own find consent bury body little 
51,"The supper was eatable to-night; and so was the breakfast on the Sunday morning; and yet Roger scarcely touched anything.  Oliver heard him tossing and muttering during the night, and was sure that he was ill. He was ill.  He would not allow that he was so, however; and dressed himself again in the fine clothes he had taken from the chest.  It was plain, from his shaking hand and his heavy eye, that he was too weak, and his head aching too much for him to be able to do any work; therefore Ailwin helped Oliver to finish the grave.",supper eatable night breakfast morning touch hear toss mutter night sure ill ill allow dress fine clothes take chest plain shaking hand heavy eye weak head ach much able do work help finish grave 
52,"Roger inquired how the work proceeded: and it appeared that he meant to attend the funeral, when he found that it was to be in the afternoon. His companions did not believe him able: and he himself doubted it in his heart, resolved as he was to refuse to believe himself very ill, as long as he could keep off the thought.  He found an excuse, however, for lying on the grass while the others were engaged at the grave.  Oliver hinted to him, very gently, that Mildred and he had rather see him dressed in the shabbiest clothes of his own, than following their little brother to his grave in fine things which they could not but consider stolen.  Roger was, in reality, only ashamed; but he pretended to be angry; and made use of the pretence to stay behind.  While he lay, ill and miserable, remembering that little George alone had seemed to love him, and that George was dead, he believed it impossible that any one should mourn the child as he did in his heart.",inquire work proceed appear mean attend funeral find afternoon companion believe able doubt heart resolve refuse believe ill keep thought find excuse lie grass other engage grave hint see dress shabbiest clothes own follow little brother grave fine thing consider steal reality ashamed pretend angry make use pretence stay lay ill miserable remember little seem love dead believe impossible mourn child do heart 
53,"Oliver himself took something from the chest--carefully and reverently; and carefully and reverently he put it back before night.  There was a Bible, in Dutch; and with it a Prayer-book.  He carried these, while Ailwin carried the body, wrapped in cloth, with another piece hanging over it, like a pall.  As Oliver took Mildred's hand, and saw how pale and sorrowful she looked (though quite patient), he felt how much need they all had of the consolations and hopes which speak to mourners from the book he held.",take chest put night be prayer book carry carry body wrap cloth piece hang pall take hand see pale sorrowful look patient feel much need have consolation hope speak mourner book hold 
54,"Ailwin did not understand Dutch; so Oliver thought it kindest and best to say in English what he read, both from the Bible and Prayer-book.  He read a short portion of what Saint Paul says about the dead and their rising again.  Then all three assisted in closing the tomb, firmly and completely; and then they kneeled down, and Oliver read a prayer for mourners from his book.  They did not sing; for he was not sure that Mildred could go through a hymn.  He made a sign to her to stay when Ailwin went home; and they two sat down on the grass above the bank, and read together that part of the Scripture in which Jesus desires his followers not to let their hearts be troubled, but to believe in God and in him.",understand think kindest good say read book read short portion say dead rising assist close tomb kneel read prayer mourner book sing sure go hymn make sign stay go sit grass bank read part desire follower let heart trouble believe 
55,"Mildred was soon quite happy; and Oliver was cheered to see her so.  He even began, after a time, to talk of the future.  He pointed out how the waters had sunk, leaving now, he supposed, only about three feet of depth, besides mud and slime.  This mud would make the soil more fertile than it had ever been, if the remainder of the flood could by any means be drawn off.  He thought his father might return, and drain his ground, and rebuild the house.  Then the bank they sat on would overlook a more beautiful garden than they had ever yet possessed.  The whole land had been so well _warped_ (that is, flooded with fertilising mud) that everything that was planted would flourish.  They might get the finest tulip-roots from Holland, and have a bed of them; and another of choice auriculas, just below George's tomb; and honeysuckles might be trained round it, to attract the bees.",happy cheer see begin time talk future point water sink leave suppose foot depth mud slime mud make soil fertile remainder flood means draw think father return drain ground rebuild house bank sit overlook beautiful garden possess whole land _warped_ flood fertilise mud plant flourish get fine tulip root have bed choice auricula tomb honeysuckle train attract bee 
56,"Mildred liked to hear all this; and she said so; but she added that she should like it better still to-morrow, perhaps.  She felt so strangely tired now, that she could not listen any more, even to what she liked to hear.",like hear say add like feel tired listen more like hear

60,"""Well--never mind about me, Oliver.  I am only very, very tired yet.""",mind tired

62,"He led her home, and laid her down, and scarcely left her for many hours.  It was plain now that the fever had seized upon them; and where it would stop, who could tell?  During the night he and Ailwin watched by turns beside their sick companions.  This would not have been necessary for Mildred; but Roger was sometimes a little delirious; and they were afraid of his frightening Mildred by his startings and strange sayings.",lead home lay leave many hour plain fever seize stop tell night watch turn sick companion necessary little delirious afraid frightening starting strange saying 
63,"When Ailwin came, at dawn, to take Oliver's place, she patted him on the shoulder, and bade him go to sleep, and be in no hurry to rouse himself again; for he would not be wanted for anything if he should sleep till noon.",come dawn take place patt shoulder bid go sleep hurry rouse want sleep noon 
64,"Oliver was tired enough; but there was one thing which he had a great mind to do before he slept.  He wished to look out once again from the staircase, when the sun should have risen, to see whether there was no moving speck on the wide waters--no promise of help in what now threatened to be his extremity.  Ailwin thought him perverse; but did not oppose his going when he said he was sure he should sleep better after it.  She soon, therefore, saw his figure among the ruins of the roof, standing up between her and the brightening sky.",tired be thing have great mind do sleep wish look staircase sun rise see be moving speck wide water promise help threaten extremity think perverse oppose go say sure sleep good see figure ruin roof stand brighten sky
