4," Tea had just been brought in on the eighth evening from Norman’s departure, when there was a ring at the bell. There was a start, and look of expectation. “Only a patient,” said the doctor; but it surely was not for that reason that he rose with so much alacrity and opened the door, nor was “Well, old fellow?” the greeting for his patients--so everybody sprang after him, and beheld something tall taking off a coat, while a voice said, “I have got it.”",tea bring eighth evening departure be ring bell be start look expectation patient say doctor reason rise much alacrity open door old fellow greeting patient spring beheld tall take coat voice say get 
5,"The mass of children rushed back to Margaret, screaming, “He has got it!” and then Aubrey trotted out into the hall again to see what Norman had got.",mass child rush scream get trotet hall see get 
6,"“A happy face at least,” said Margaret, as he came to her. And that was not peculiar to Norman. The radiance had shone out upon every one in that moment, and it was one buzz of happy exclamation, query, and answer--the only tone of regret when Mary spoke of Harry, and all at once took up the strain--how glad poor Harry would be. As to the examination, that had been much less difficult than Norman had expected; in fact, he said, it was lucky for him that the very subjects had been chosen in which he was most up--luck which, as the doctor could not help observing, generally did attend Norman. And Norman had been so happy with Richard; the kind, wise elder brother had done exactly what was best for him in soothing his anxiety, and had fully shared his feelings, and exulted in his success. Margaret had a most triumphant letter, dwelling on the abilities of the candidates whom Norman had outstripped, and the idea that every one had conceived of his talent. “Indeed,” wrote Richard, “I fancy the men had never believed that I could have a clever brother. I am glad they have seen what Norman can do.”",happy face least say come peculiar radiance shine one moment buzz happy exclamation query answer only tone regret speak take strain glad poor examination difficult expect fact say lucky very subject choose luck doctor help observe attend happy kind wise elder brother do good soothing anxiety share feeling exult success have triumphant letter dwelling ability candidate outstripp idea one conceive talent write fancy man believe have clever brother glad see do 
7,"Margaret could not help reading this aloud, and it made Norman blush with the compunction that Richard’s unselfish pride in him always excited. He had much to tell of his ecstasy with Oxford. Stoneborough Minster had been a training in appreciation of its hoary beauty, but the essentially prosaic Richard had never prepared him for the impression that the reverend old university made on him, and he was already, heart and soul, one of her most loyal and loving sons, speaking of his college and of the whole university as one who had a right of property in them, and looking, all the time, not elated, but contented, as if he had found his sphere and was satisfied. He had seen Cheviot, too, and had been very happy in the renewed friendship; and had been claimed as a cousin by a Balliol man, a certain Norman Ogilvie, a name well known among the Mays. “And how has Tom been getting on?” he asked, when he returned to home affairs.",help read make blush compunction unselfish pride excite have much tell ecstasy training appreciation hoary beauty prosaic prepare impression reverend old university make heart soul loyal loving son speak college whole university have right property look time elate content find sphere satisfied see happy renew friendship claim cousin man certain name know get ask return home affair

13,"The little, pale, rough-haired Tom, in his perpetual coating of dust, softly crept into the room, as if he only wanted to elude observation; but Mary and Blanche were at once vociferating their news in his ears, though with little encouragement--he only shook them off abruptly, and would not answer when they required him to be glad.",little pale rough haired perpetual coating dust creep room want elude observation vociferate news ear little encouragement shake answer require glad

18,"“Thirteenth!” muttered Tom in his throat, and well he might, for two or three voices cried out that was too bad, and that it was all his own fault, for not accepting Ethel’s help. He took little heed, but crept to his corner without another word, and Mary knew she should be thumped if she should torment him there.",thirteenth mutter throat voice cry bad own fault accept help take little heed creep corner word know thump torment 
19,"Norman left him alone, but the coldness of the little brother for whom he had worked gave a greater chill to his pleasure than he could have supposed possible. He would rather have had some cordiality on Tom’s part, than all the congratulations that met him the next day.",leave coldness little brother work give great chill pleasure suppose possible have cordiality part congratulation meet next day 
20,"He could not rest contented while Tom continued to shrink from him, and he was the more uneasy when, on Saturday morning, no calls from Mary availed to find the little boy, and bring him to the usual reading and Catechism.",rest content continue shrink uneasy morning call avail find little boy bring usual reading catechism 
21,"Margaret decided that they must begin without him, and poor Mary’s verse was read, in consequence, with a most dolorous tone. As soon as the books were shut, she ran off, and a few words passed among the elder ones about the truant--Flora opining that the Andersons had led him away; Ethel suggesting that his gloom must arise from his not being well; and Margaret looking wistfully at Norman, and saying she feared they had judged much amiss last spring. Norman heard in silence, and walked thoughtfully into the garden. Presently he caught Mary’s voice in expostulation: “How could you not come to read?”",decide begin poor verse read consequence dolorous tone book shut run few word pass elder one truant opine lead suggest gloom arise look say fear judge much amiss last spring hear silence walk garden catch voice expostulation come read

24,"Norman, who was going round the shrubs that concealed the speakers from him, here lost their voices, but, as he emerged in front of the old tool-house, he heard a little scream from Mary, and, at the same moment, she darted back, and fell over a heap of cabbage-stumps in front of the old tool-house. It was no small surprise to her to be raised by him, and tenderly asked whether she were hurt. She was not hurt, but she could not speak without crying, and when Norman begged to hear what was the matter, and where Tom was, she would only plead for him--that he did not intend to hurt her, and that she had been teasing him. What had he done to frighten her? Oh! he had only run at her with a hoe, because she was troublesome; she did not mind it, and Norman must not--and she clung to him as if to keep him back, while he pursued his researches in the tool-house, where, nearly concealed by a great bushel-basket, lurked Master Thomas, crouching down, with a volume of Gil Blas in his hand.",go shrub conceal speaker lose voice emerge front old tool house hear little scream same moment dart fall heap cabbage stump front old tool house small surprise raise ask hurt hurt speak cry begg hear matter plead intend hurt tease do frighten run hoe troublesome mind cling keep pursue researche tool house conceal great bushel basket lurk crouch volume hand

27,"Norman sent Mary away, pacifying her by promises that he would not revenge her quarrel upon Tom, and then, turning the basket upside down, and perching himself astride on it, he began: “That is the kindest, most forgiving little sister I ever did see. What possesses you to treat her so ill?”",send pacify promise revenge quarrel turn basket perch begin kindest forgiving little sister see possess treat ill 
28,“I wasn’t going to hurt her.”,go hurt 
29,"“But why drive her away? Why don’t you come to read?” No answer; and Norman, for a moment, felt as if Tom were really hopelessly ill-conditioned and sullen, but he persevered in restraining his desire to cuff the ill-humour out of him, and continued, “Come! there’s something wrong, and you will never be better till it is out. Tell me--don’t be afraid. Those fellows have been at you again?”",drive come read answer moment feel ill condition sullen persever restrain desire cuff ill humour continue come be wrong good tell afraid fellow

31,“They said they would spiflicate me if I told!” sighed Tom.,say spiflicate tell sigh 
32,"“They shall never do anything to you;” and, by-and-by, a sobbing confession was drawn forth, muttered at intervals, as low as if Tom expected the strings of onions to hear and betray him to his foes. Looking on him as a deserter, these town-boys had taken advantage of his brother’s absence to heap on him every misery they could inflict. There had been a wager between Edward Anderson and Sam Axworthy as to what Tom could be made to do, and his personal timidity made him a miserable victim, not merely beaten and bruised, but forced to transgress every rule of right and wrong that had been enforced on his conscience. On Sunday, they had profited by the absence of their dux to have a jollification at a little public-house, not far from the playing-fields; and here had Tom been dragged in, forced to partake with them, and frightened with threats that he had treated them all, and was liable to pay the whole bill, which, of course, he firmly believed, as well as that he should be at least half murdered if he gave his father any suspicion that the whole had not been consumed by himself. Now, though poor Tom’s conscience had lost many scruples during the last spring, the offence, into which he had been forced, was too heinous to a child brought up as he had been to be palliated even in his own eyes. The profanation of Sunday, and the carousal in a public-house, had combined to fill him with a sense of shame and degradation, which was the real cause that he felt himself unworthy to come and read with his sisters. His grief and misery were extreme, and Norman’s indignation was such as could find no utterance. He sat silent, quivering with anger, and clenching his fingers over the handle of the hoe.",do sobb confession draw mutter interval low expect string onion hear betray foe look deserter town boy take advantage brother absence heap misery inflict be wager make do personal timidity make miserable victim beat bruise force transgress rule right wrong enforce conscience profit absence dux have jollification little public house playing field drag force partake frighten threat treat liable pay whole bill course believe least half murder give father suspicion whole consume poor conscience lose many scruple last spring offence force heinous child bring palliate own eye profanation carousal public house combine fill sense shame degradation real cause feel unworthy come read sister grief misery extreme indignation such find utterance sit silent quiver anger clench finger handle hoe

39,"It did not produce the ecstasy Norman had expected. The boy still sat on the ground, staring at his brother, as if the good news hardly penetrated the gloom; and, after a disappointing silence, recurred to the most immediate cause of distress: “Eight shillings and tenpence halfpenny! Norman, if you would only lend it to me, you shall have all my tin till I have made it up--sixpence a week, and half-a-crown on New Year’s Day.”",produce ecstasy expect boy sit ground stare brother good news penetrate gloom disappointing silence recurr immediate cause distress shilling tenpence halfpenny lend have tin make week half crown new

44,"Norman assured him that there was not the slightest reason that these passages should ever come to the knowledge of his sisters. Tom was excessively afraid of his father, but he could not well be more wretched than he was already; and he was brought to assent when Norman showed him that he had never been happy since the affair of the blotting-paper, when his father’s looks and tones had become objects of dread to his guilty conscience. Was not the only means of recovering a place in papa’s esteem to treat him with confidence?",assure be slight reason passage come knowledge sister afraid father wretched bring assent show happy affair blotting paper father look tone become object dread guilty conscience only means recover place esteem treat confidence 
45,"Tom answered not, and would only shudder when his brother took upon him to declare that free confession would gain pardon even for the doings at the Green Man.",answer shudder brother take declare free confession gain pardon doing green 
46,"Tom had grown stupefied and passive, and his sole dependence was on Norman, so, at last, he made no opposition when his brother offered to conduct him to his father and speak for him. The danger now was that Dr. May should not be forthcoming, and the elder brother was as much relieved, as the younger was dismayed, to see, through the drawing-room window, that he was standing beside Margaret.",grow stupefied passive sole dependence last make opposition brother offer conduct father speak danger forthcoming elder brother relieved young dismay see draw room window stand

48,"“Coming! What now?” said the doctor, entering the hall. “What, Tom, my boy, what is it?” as he saw the poor child, white, cold, almost sick with apprehension, with every pulse throbbing, and looking positively ill. He took the chilly, damp hand, which shook nervously, and would fain have withdrawn itself.",come say doctor enter hall boy see poor child white cold sick apprehension pulse throbbing look ill take chilly damp hand shake withdraw 
49,"“Come, my dear, let us see what is amiss;” and before Tom knew what he was doing, he had seated him on his knee, in the arm-chair in the study, and was feeling his pulse. “There, rest your head! Has it not been aching all day?”",come dear let see amiss know do seat knee arm chair study feel pulse rest head ach day

51,"Tom would fain have been on his feet, yet the support of that shoulder was inexpressibly comfortable to his aching temples, and he could not but wait for the shock of being roughly shaken and put down. So, as his brother related what had occurred, he crouched and trembled more and more on his father’s breast, till, to his surprise, he found the other arm passed round him in support, drawing him more tenderly close.",foot support shoulder comfortable ach temple wait shock shake put brother relate occur crouch tremble more father breast surprise find other arm pass support draw close

61,"“He shall never be under their power again! Thanks to you, Norman. Do you hear that, Tommy?”",power thanks hear 
62,"The answer was hardly audible. The little boy was already almost asleep, worn out with all he had undergone. Norman began to clear the sofa, that they might lay him down, but his father would not hear of disturbing him, and, sending Norman away, sat still for more than an hour, until the child slowly awoke, and scarcely recalling what had happened, stood up between his father’s knees, rubbing his eyes, and looking bewildered.",answer audible little boy asleep wear undergone begin clear sofa lay father hear disturbing send sit more hour child awoke recall happen stand father knee rub eye look bewilder

72,"Tom was still giddy and unwell, his whole frame affected by the troubles of the last week, and Dr. May arranged him on the sofa, and desired him to be quiet, offering to send Mary to be his companion. Tom was languidly pleased, but renewed his entreaty, that his confession might be a secret from his sisters. Dr. May promised, and Mary, quite satisfied at being taken into favour, asked no questions, but spent the rest of the morning in playing at draughts with him, and in having inflicted on her the history of the Bloody Fire King’s Ghost--a work of Tom’s imagination, which he was wont to extemporise, to the extreme terror of much enduring Mary.",giddy unwell whole frame affect trouble last week arrange sofa desire quiet offer send companion pleased renew entreaty confession secret sister promise satisfied take favour ask question spend rest morning play draught inflict history bloody work imagination wont extemporise extreme terror endure

78,"“Hush! don’t argue against it,” said Dr. May, almost petulantly. “I have stood a great deal to oblige you, but I cannot stand this. When it is a matter of corruption, base cruelty--no, Norman, it is not right--not another word!”",argue say stand great deal oblige stand matter corruption base cruelty right word 
79,"Norman’s words had not been many, but he felt a conviction that, in spite of the dismay and pain to himself, Dr. May ought to meet with submission to his judgment, and he acquiesced by silence.",word many feel conviction spite dismay pain meet submission judgment acquiesce silence

93,"The doctor let himself out at the garden gate, and strode off at a rapid pace, conscious perhaps, in secret, that if he did not at once yield to the impulse of resentment, good nature would overpower the sense of justice. His son returned to the house with a heavy sigh, yet honouring the generosity that had respected his scruples, when merely his own worldly loss was involved, but set them aside when the good of others was concerned. By-and-by Dr. May reappeared. The head-master had been thoroughly roused to anger, and had begged at once to examine May junior, for whom his father was now come.",doctor let garden gate strode rapid pace conscious secret yield impulse resentment good nature overpower sense justice son return house heavy sigh honour generosity respect scruple own worldly loss involve set good other concerned reappear head master rouse anger begg examine junior father come 
94,"Tom was quite unprepared for such formidable consequences of his confession, and began by piteous tears and sobs, and when these had, with some difficulty, been pacified, he proved to be really so unwell and exhausted, that his father could not take him to Minster Street, and was obliged to leave him to his brother’s keeping, while he returned to the school.",unprepared such formidable consequence confession begin piteous tear sob difficulty pacify prove unwell exhausted father take oblige leave brother keep return school

96,"Then away went the gentlemen; and Mary was again called to comfort Tom, who, broken down into the mere longing for sympathy, sobbed out all his troubles to her, while her eyes expanded more and more in horror, and her soft heart giving way, she cried quite as pitifully, and a great deal more loudly; and so the other sisters learned the whole, and Margaret was ready for her father when he came in, in the evening, harassed and sorrowful. His anger was all gone now, and he was excessively grieved at finding that the ringleaders, Samuel Axworthy and Edward Anderson, could, in Dr. Hoxton’s opinion, receive no sentence but expulsion, which was to be pronounced on them on Monday.",go gentleman call comfort break mere longing sympathy sobb trouble eye expand more horror soft heart give way cry great deal other sister learn whole ready father come evening harass sorrowful anger gone grieve find ringleader opinion receive sentence expulsion pronounce 
97,"Sam Axworthy was the son of a low, uneducated man, and his best chance had been the going to this school; but he was of a surly, obstinate temper, and showed so little compunction, that even such superabundant kindness as Dr. May’s could not find compassion for him; especially since it had appeared that Tom had been by no means the only victim, and that he had often been the promoter of the like malpractices, which many boys were relieved to be forced to expose.",son low uneducated man good chance go school surly obstinate temper show little compunction such superabundant kindness find compassion appear means only victim promoter like malpractice many boy relieve force expose 
98,"For Edward Anderson, however, or rather for his mother, Dr. May was very sorry, and had even interceded for his pardon; but Dr. Hoxton, though slow to be roused, was far less placable than the other doctor, and would not hear of anything but the most rigorous justice.",mother sorry interced pardon slow rouse placable other doctor hear rigorous justice

109,"Poor Mrs. Anderson! her shower of notes rent the heart of the one doctor, but were tossed carelessly aside by the other. On that Sunday, Norman held various conversations with his probable successor, Ashe, a gentle, well-disposed boy, hitherto in much dread of the post of authority, but owning that, in Axworthy’s absence, the task would be comparatively easy, and that Anderson would probably originate far less mischief.",poor shower note rent heart doctor toss other hold various conversation probable successor gentle dispose boy much dread post authority own absence task easy originate less mischief

116,"Edward’s eyes were full of tears; he almost owned the whole. He had not thought of such things, and then Axworthy--It was more evident from manner than words that the boy did repent and was greatly overcome, both by his own disgrace and his mother’s distress, wishing earnestly to redeem his character, and declaring, from the bottom of his heart, that he would avoid his former offences. He was emboldened at last to say, with hesitation, “Could not you speak to Dr. Hoxton for me?”",eye full tear own whole think such thing evident manner word boy repent overcome own disgrace mother distress wish redeem character declare bottom heart avoid former offence embolden last say hesitation speak

119,"Norman took another turn, looked up at the sky, twisted his hands together in perplexity, mumbled something about hating to do a thing when it was all for no use, and then marched off towards Minster Street, with a pace like his father’s the day before.",take turn look sky twist hand perplexity mumble hate do thing use march pace father day 
120,"When he came forth again from Dr. Hoxton’s study, he did not believe that his intercession had produced the least effect, and there was a sense of vexation at the position which he had assumed. He went home, and said nothing on the subject; but when, on Monday, the school was assembled, and the judgment announced, it was Axworthy alone whose friends had been advised to remove him.",come study believe intercession produce least effect be sense vexation position assume go say subject school assemble judgment announce alone friend advise remove 
121,"Anderson received a severe punishment, as did all those who had shared in the revel at the Green Man. Even Tom, and another little boy, who had been likewise drawn in, were obliged to stay within narrow bounds, and to learn heavy impositions; and a stern reprimand and exhortation were given to the school collectively. Anderson, who had seen from the window that turn towards Minster Street, drew his own conclusions, and was not insensible to the generosity that had surpassed his hopes, though to his faltering attempt at thanks, Norman replied that he did not believe it was owing to him, and never exposed himself to Flora’s wonder by declaring at home what he had done.",receive severe punishment do share revel green little boy draw oblige stay narrow bound learn heavy imposition stern reprimand exhortation give school see window turn draw own conclusion insensible generosity surpass hope falter attempt thanks reply believe ow expose wonder declare home do 
122,"So the last weeks of the half-year passed away with the boys in a subdued, but hopeful manner, and the reformation, under Norman’s auspices, progressed so well, that Ashe might fairly expect to reap the benefit of the discipline, established at so much cost.",last week half year pass boy subdued hopeful manner reformation auspices progress expect reap benefit discipline establish much cost 
123,"Mr. Wilmot had looked on, and given his help, but he was preparing to leave Stoneborough, and there was great concern at the parting with such a friend. Ethel, especially, mourned the loss to Cocksmoor, and, for though hers had been the executive part, his had been the head, and he was almost equally grieved to go from the newly-begun work.",look give help prepare leave be great concern parting friend mourn loss executive part head grieve go begin work 
124,"Margaret lamented the loss of her kind counsellor, and the ready hearer of her anxieties for the children. Writing could ill supply the place of their conversations, and she feared likewise that her father would feel the want of his companionship. The promise of visits, and the intercourse kept up by Tom’s passing to and fro, was the best consolation.",lament loss kind counsellor ready hearer anxiety child write supply place conversation fear father feel want companionship promise visit intercourse keep pass for good consolation 
125,"Poor Margaret had begun to flag, both in strength and spirits, as winter approached, but there came a revival in the shape of “Ship Letters!”  Alan wrote cheerfully and graphically, with excellent accounts of Harry, who, on his side, sent very joyous and characteristic despatches, only wishing that he could present Mary with all the monkeys and parrots he had seen at Rio, as well as the little ruby-crested humming-birds, that always reminded him of Miss Rivers.",poor begin flag strength spirit winter approach come revival shape ship letter write excellent account side send joyous characteristic despatche wish present monkey parrot see little ruby crest hum bird remind 
126,"With the Christmas holidays, Hector Ernescliffe came from Eton, as to a home, and was received by Margaret as a sort of especial charge. It was pretty to see how he turned to her as something peculiarly his own, and would sit on a footstool by her, letting himself be drawn into confidence, and dwelling on his brother’s past doings, and on future schemes for Maplewood. For the rest, he restored to the house the atmosphere of boy, which had somewhat departed with Harry. Mary, who had begun to be tamed down, ran more wild than ever, to the utter despair of Miss Winter; and Tom, now that his connection with the Whichcote foundation was over, and he was no more cowed by the sight of his tyrants, came out in a new light. He put on his boy-nature, rioted like the rest, acquired colour in his cheeks, divested his jacket of perpetual dust, had his hair cut, brushed up a crest on his head, and ran about no longer a little abject, but a merry lad.",holiday come home receive sort especial charge see turn own sit footstool let draw confidence dwelling brother past doing future scheme rest restore house atmosphere boy depart begin tame run wild utter despair connection foundation cow sight tyrant come new light put boy nature riot rest acquire colour cheek divest jacket perpetual dust have hair cut brush crest head run little abject merry lad 
127,"Ethel said it was a change from Horrid-locks to Harfagre; Margaret said little, but, like her father, she blessed Norman in her heart for having given back the boy to his father’s confidence, and saved him so far from the terrible course of deceit and corruption. She could not much take to heart the mad exploits of the so-called boys, even though she spent three hours in heart-beatings on Christmas Eve, when Hector, Mary, Tom, Blanche, and the dog Toby, were lost the whole day. However, they did come back at six o’clock, having been deluded by an old myth of George Larkins, into starting for a common, three miles beyond Cocksmoor, in search of mistletoe, with scarlet berries, and yellow holly, with leaves like a porcupine! Failing these wonders, they had been contenting themselves with scarlet holly, in the Drydale plantations, when a rough voice exclaimed, “Who gave you leave to take that?” whereupon Tom had plunged into a thicket, and nearly “scratched out both his eyes”; but Hector boldly standing his ground, with Blanche in his hand, the woodman discovered that here was the Miss Mary, of whom his little girls talked so much, thereupon cut down the choicest boughs, and promised to leave a full supply at Dr. May’s. Margaret could have been angry at the taking the young ladies on so mad a scheme, but then Mary was so happy, and as to Hector, how scold him, when he had lifted Blanche over every ditch, and had carried her home one mile on his back, and another, queen’s-cushion fashion, between him and Mary?",say change horrid lock say little father bless heart give boy father confidence save terrible course deceit corruption take heart mad exploit call boy spend hour heart beating dog lose whole day come o'clock delude old myth start common mile search mistletoe scarlet berries yellow holly leave porcupine fail wonder content scarlet holly plantation rough voice exclaim give leave take plunge thicket scratch eye stand ground hand woodman discover little girl talk cut choicest bough promise leave full supply angry take young lady mad scheme happy scold lift ditch carry home mile back queen cushion fashion 
128,"Flora, meanwhile, went her own way. The desire of compensating for what had passed with Norman, led to great civilities from Dr. and Mrs. Hoxton, which nobody was at liberty to receive except Flora. Pretty, graceful, and pleasing, she was a valuable companion to a gentle little, inane lady, with more time and money than she knew what to do with; and Mrs. Hoxton, who was of a superior grade to the Stoneborough ladies in general, was such a chaperon as Flora was glad to secure. Dr. May’s old loyal feelings could not help regarding her notice of his daughter as a favour and kindness, and Margaret could find no tangible objections, nor any precedent from her mother’s conduct, even had any one had the power to interfere with one so quiet, reasonable, and determined as Flora.",go own way desire compensate pass lead great civility liberty receive graceful pleasing valuable companion gentle little inane lady more time money know do superior grade lady general chaperon glad secure old loyal feeling help regard notice daughter favour kindness find tangible objection precedent mother conduct have one have power interfere quiet reasonable determine 
129,"So the intimacy became closer and closer, and as the winter passed on, Flora gradually became established as the dear friend and assistant, without whom Mrs. Hoxton could give no party. Further, Flora took the grand step of setting up a copper-plate and cards of “Miss Flora May,”  went out frequently on morning calls with Mrs. Hoxton and her bay horses, and when Dr. May refused his share of invitations to dinner with the neighbours in the county, Flora generally found that she could go under the Hoxtons’ guardianship.",intimacy become close close winter pass become establish dear friend assistant give party take grand step set copper plate card go morning call horse refuse share invitation dinner neighbour county find go guardianship
