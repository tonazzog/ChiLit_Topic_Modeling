1,CHAPTER 46. FOR LOVE OF NAN.,chapter love nan 
2,"Now was Annie's time.  ""Tiger,"" she said, for she had heard the men calling the dog's name.  ""I want to go right down into that hole in the ground, and you are to come with me.  Don't let us lose a moment, good dog.""",time say hear man call dog name want go hole ground come let lose moment good dog 
3,"The dog wagged his tail, capered about in front of Annie, and then with a wonderful shrewdness ran before her to the broken wall, where he stood with his head bent downwards and his eyes fixed on the ground.",dog wagg tail caper front wonderful shrewdness run broken wall stand head bend eye fix ground 
4,"Annie pulled and tugged at the loose stones; they were so heavy and so cunningly arranged that she wondered how the little maid, who was smaller than herself, had managed to remove them.  She saw quickly, however, that they were arranged with a certain leverage, and that the largest stone that which formed the real entrance to the underground passage, was balanced in its place in such a fashion that when she leant on a certain portion of it, it moved aside, and allowed plenty of room for her to go down into the earth.",pull tug loose stone heavy arrange wonder little maid small manage remove see arrange certain leverage large stone form real entrance underground passage balance place fashion lean certain portion move allow plenty room go earth 
5,"Very dark and dismal and uninviting did the rude steps, which led nobody knew where, appear.  For one moment Annie hesitated; but the thought of Nan hidden somewhere in this awful wretchedness nerved her courage.",dark dismal uninviting rude step lead know appear moment hesitate thought hide awful wretchedness nerve courage 
6,"""Go first, Tiger, please,"" she said, and the dog scampered down, sniffing the earth as he went.  Annie followed him, but she had scarcely got her head below the level of the ground before she found herself in total and absolute darkness; she had unwittingly touched the heavy stone, which had swung back into its place.  She heard Tiger sniffing below, and, calling to him to keep by her side, she went very carefully down and down and down, until at last she knew by the increase of air that she must have come to the end of the narrow entrance passage.",go say dog scamper sniff earth go follow get head level ground find total absolute darkness touch heavy stone swing place hear sniff call keep side go last know increase air come end narrow entrance passage 
7,"She was now able to stand upright, and raising her hand, she tried in vain to find a roof.  The room where she stood, then, must be lofty. She went forward in the utter darkness very, very slowly; suddenly her head again came in contact with the roof; she made a few steps farther on, and then found that to proceed at all she must go on her hands and knees.  She bent down and peered through the darkness.",able stand raise hand try vain find roof room stand lofty go utter darkness head come contact roof make few step find proceed go hand knee bend peer darkness 
8,"""We'll go on, Tiger,"" she said, and, holding the dog's collar and clinging to him for protection, she crept along the narrow passage.",go say hold dog collar cling protection creep narrow passage 
9,"Suddenly she gave an exclamation of joy--at the other end of this gloomy passage was light--faint twilight surely, but still undoubted light, which came down from some chink in the outer world.  Annie came to the end of the passage, and, standing upright, found herself suddenly in a room; a very small and miserable room, certainly, but with the twilight shining through it, which revealed not only that it was a room, but a room which contained a heap of straw, a three-legged stool, and two or three cracked cups and saucers.  Here, then, was Mother Rachel's lair, and here she must look for Nan.",give exclamation joy other end gloomy passage light faint twilight undoubted light come chink outer world come end passage stand find room small miserable room twilight shine reveal room room contain heap straw legged stool crack cup saucer lair look 
10,"The darkness had been so intense that even the faint twilight of this little chamber had dazzled Annie's eyes for a moment; the next, however, her vision became clear.  She saw that the straw bed contained a bundle; she went near--out of the wrapped-up bundle of shawls appeared the head of a child.  The child slept, and moaned in its slumbers.",darkness intense faint twilight little chamber dazzle eye moment next vision become clear see straw bed contain bundle go wrap bundle shawl appear head child child sleep moan slumber 
11,"Annie bent over it and said, ""Thank God!"" in a tone of rapture, and then, stooping down, she passionately kissed the lips of little Nan.",bend say thank tone rapture stoop kiss lip little 
12,"Nan's skin had been dyed with the walnut-juice, her pretty soft hair had been cut short, her dainty clothes had been changed for the most ragged gipsy garments, but still she was undoubtedly Nan, the child whom Annie had come to save.",skin dyed walnut juice pretty soft hair cut short dainty clothes change ragged gipsy garment child come save 
13,"From her uneasy slumbers the poor little one awoke with a cry of terror. She could not recognise Annie's changed face, and clasped her hands before her eyes, and said piteously--",uneasy slumber poor little one awoke cry terror recognise change face clasp hand eye say 
14,"""Me want to go home--go 'way, naughty woman, me want my Annie.""",want go go way naughty woman want 
15,"""Little darling!"" said Annie, in her sweetest tones.  The changed face had not appealed to Nan, but the old voice went straight to her baby heart; she stopped crying and looked anxiously toward the entrance of the room.",little darling say sweetest tone change face appeal old voice go baby heart stop cry look entrance room 
16,"""Turn in, Annie--me here, Annie--little Nan want 'oo.""",turn little want 
17,"Annie glanced around her in despair.  Suddenly her quick eyes lighted on a jug of water.  She flew to it, and washed and laved her face.",glance despair quick eye light jug water fly wash lave face 
18,"""Coming, darling,"" she said, as she tried to remove the hateful dye. She succeeded partly, and when she came back, to her great joy, the child recognised her.",come darling say try remove hateful dye succeed come great joy child recognise 
19,"""Now, little precious, we will get out of this as fast as we can,"" said Annie, and clasping Nan tightly in her arms, she prepared to return by the way she had come.  Then and there, for the first time, there flashed across her memory the horrible fact that the stone door had swung back into its place, and that by no possible means could she open it.  She and Nan and Tiger were buried in a living tomb, and must either stay there and perish, or await the tender mercies of the cruel Mother Rachel.",little precious get say clasp arm prepare return way come first time flash memory horrible fact stone door swing place possible means open bury living tomb stay perish await tender mercie cruel 
20,"Nan, with her arms tightly clasped round Annie's neck, began to cry fretfully.  She was impatient to get out of this dismal place; she was no longer oppressed by fears, for with the Annie whom she loved she felt absolutely safe; but she was hungry and cold and uncomfortable, and it seemed but a step, to little inexperienced Nan, from Annie's arms to her snug, cheerful nursery at Lavender House.",arm clasp neck begin cry impatient get dismal place oppress fear love feel safe hungry cold uncomfortable seem step little inexperienced arm snug cheerful nursery 
21,"""Turn, Annie--turn home, Annie,"" she begged, and, when Annie did not stir, she began to weep.",turn turn begg stir begin weep 
22,"In truth, the poor, brave little girl was sadly puzzled, and her first gleam of returning hope lay in the remembrance of Zillah's words, that there were generally two entrances to these old underground forts. Tiger, who seemed thoroughly at home in this little room, and had curled himself up comfortably on the heap of straw, had probably often been here before.  Perhaps Tiger knew the way to the second entrance.  Annie called him to her side.",truth poor brave little girl puzzled first gleam return hope lay remembrance word be entrance old underground fort seem home little room curl heap straw know way second entrance call side 
23,"""Tiger,"" she said, going down on her knees, and looking full into his ugly but intelligent face, ""Nan and I want to go out of this.""",say go knee look full ugly intelligent face want go 
24,Tiger wagged his stumpy tail.,wagg stumpy tail 
25,"""We are hungry, Tiger, and we want something to eat, and you'd like a bone, wouldn't you?""",hungry want eat like bone 
26,"Tiger's tail went with ferocious speed, and he licked Annie's hand.",tail go ferocious speed lick hand 
27,"""There's no use going back that way, dear dog,"" continued the girl, pointing with her arm in the direction they had come.  ""The door is fastened, Tiger, and we can't get out.  We can't get out because the door is shut.""",be use go way dear dog continue girl point arm direction come door fasten get get door shut 
28,"The dog's tail had ceased to wag; he took in the situation, for his whole expression showed dejection, and he drooped his head.",dog tail cease be take situation whole expression show dejection droop head 
29,"It was now quite evident to Annie that Tiger had been here before, and that on some other occasion in his life he had wanted to get out and could not because the door was shut.",evident other occasion life want get door shut 
30,"""Now, Tiger,"" said Annie, speaking cheerfully, and rising to her feet, ""we must get out.  Nan and I are hungry, and you want your bone.  Take us out the other way, good Tiger--the other way, dear dog.""",say speak rise foot get hungry want bone take other way good other way dear dog 
31,She moved instantly toward the little passage; the dog followed her.,move little passage dog follow 
32,"""The other way,"" she said, and she turned her back on the long narrow passage, and took a step or two into complete darkness.  The dog began to whine, caught hold of her dress, and tried to pull her back.",other way say turn long narrow passage take step complete darkness dog begin whine catch hold dress try pull 
33,"""Quite right, Tiger, we won't go that way,"" said Annie instantly.  She returned into the dimly-lighted room.",right go way say return light room 
34,"""Find a way--And a way out, Tiger,"" she said.",find way way say 
35,"The dog evidently understood her; he moved restlessly about the room. Finally he got up on the bed, pulled and scratched and tore away the straw at the upper end, then, wagging his tail, flew to Annie's side. She came back with him.  Beneath the straw was a tiny, tiny trap-door.",dog understand move room get bed pull scratch tore straw upper end wag tail fly side come straw tiny tiny trap door 
36,"""Oh, Tiger!"" said the girl; she went down on her knees, and, finding she could not stir it, wondered if this also was kept in its place by a system of balancing.  She was right; after a very little pressing the door moved aside, and Annie saw four or five rudely carved steps.",say girl go knee find stir wonder keep place system balancing right little press door move see carve step 
37,"""Come, Nan,"" she said joyfully, ""Tiger has saved us; these steps must lead us out.""",come say save step lead 
38,"The dog, with a joyful whine, went down first, and Annie, clasping Nan tightly in her arms, followed him.  Four, five, six steps they went down; then, to Annie's great joy, she found that the next step began to ascend.  Up and up she went, cheered by a welcome shaft of light. Finally she, Nan, and the dog found themselves emerging into the open air, through a hole which might have been taken for a large rabbit burrow.",dog joyful whine go clasp arm follow step go great joy find next step begin ascend go cheer welcome shaft light dog find emerge open air hole take large rabbit burrow
