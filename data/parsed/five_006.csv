2," The others were to be kept in as a punishment for the misfortunes of the day before. Of course Martha thought it was naughtiness, and not misfortune--so you must not blame her. She only thought she was doing her duty. You know, grown-up people often say they do not like to punish you, and that they only do it for your own good, and that it hurts them as much as it hurts you--and this is really very often the truth.",other keep punishment misfortune day course think naughtiness misfortune blame think do duty know grow person say like punish do own good hurt much hurt truth

10,"""Wish away,"" said the Psammead, twisting itself round in the sand. But Robert couldn't wish away. He forgot all the things he had been thinking about, and nothing would come into his head but little things for himself, like candy, a foreign stamp album, or a knife with three blades and a corkscrew. He sat down to think better of things the others would not have cared for--such as a football, or a pair of leg-guards, or to be able to lick Simpkins Minor thoroughly when he went back to school.",wish say twist sand wish forget thing think come head little thing candy foreign stamp album knife blade corkscrew sit think good thing other care such football pair leg guard able lick go school

13,"But it was too late. The Psammead had blown itself out to about three times its proper size, and now it collapsed like a pricked bubble, and with a deep sigh leaned back against the edge of the sand-pool, quite faint with the effort.",late blow time proper size collapse prick bubble deep sigh learn edge sand pool faint effort

15,"They were--quite sure; Robert felt this, and as he ran home his mind was deeply occupied with the sort of wishes he might find they had wished in his absence. They might wish for rabbits, or white mice, or chocolate, or a fine day to-morrow, or even--and that was most likely--someone might have said, ""I do wish to goodness Robert would hurry up."" Well, he _was_ hurrying up, and so they would have had their wish, and the day would be wasted. Then he tried to think what they could wish for--something that would be amusing indoors. That had been his own difficulty from the beginning. So few things are amusing indoors when the sun is shining outside and you mayn't go out, however much you want to do so.",sure feel run mind occupy sort wish find wish absence wish rabbit white mouse chocolate fine day likely say wish goodness hurry hurry have wish day waste try think wish amusing own difficulty beginning few thing amusing sun shine go much want do 
16,"Robert was running as fast as he could, but when he turned the corner that ought to have brought him within sight of the architect's nightmare--the ornamental iron-work on the top of the house--he opened his eyes so wide that he had to drop into a walk; for you cannot run with your eyes wide open. Then suddenly he stopped short, for there was no house to be seen. The front garden railings were gone too, and where the house had stood--Robert rubbed his eyes and looked again. Yes, the others _had_ wished,--there was no doubt about it,--and they must have wished that they lived in a castle; for there the castle stood, black and stately, and very tall and broad, with battlements and lancet windows, and eight great towers; and, where the garden and the orchard had been, there were white things dotted like mushrooms. Robert walked slowly on, and as he got nearer he saw that these were tents, and men in armor were walking about among the tents--crowds and crowds of them.",run turn corner bring sight architect nightmare ornamental iron work top house open eye wide have drop walk run eye open stop short be house see front garden railing gone house stand rub eye look other wish be doubt wish live castle castle stand black stately tall broad battlement lancet window great tower garden orchard be white thing dot mushroom walk get see tent man armor walk tent crowd crowd

19,"At the little window above the great gateway, across the moat that now lay where the garden had been but half an hour ago, someone was waving something pale dust-colored. Robert thought it was one of Cyril's handkerchiefs. They had never been white since the day when he had upset the bottle of ""Combined Toning and Fixing Solution"" into the drawer where they were. Robert waved back, and immediately felt that he had been unwise. For this signal had been seen by the besieging force, and two men in steel-caps were coming towards him. They had high brown boots on their long legs, and they came towards him with such great strides that Robert remembered the shortness of his own legs and did not run away. He knew it would be useless to himself, and he feared it might be irritating to the foe. So he stood still--and the two men seemed quite pleased with him.",little window great gateway moat lay garden hour wave pale dust color think handkerchief white day upset bottle combine fix drawer wave feel unwise signal see besieg force man steel cap come have high brown boot long leg come such great stride remember shortness own leg run know useless fear irritating foe stand man seem pleased

32,"The leader was the most glorious creature Robert had ever seen. He was exactly like the pictures Robert had so often admired in the historical romances. He had armor, and a helmet, and a horse, and a crest, and feathers, and a shield and a lance and a sword. His armor and his weapons were all, I am almost sure, of quite different periods. The shield was thirteenth century, while the sword was of the pattern used in the Peninsular War. The cuirass was of the time of Charles I., and the helmet dated from the Second Crusade. The arms on the shield were very grand--three red running lions on a blue ground. The tents were of the latest brand approved of by our modern War Office, and the whole appearance of camp, army, and leader might have been a shock to some. But Robert was dumb with admiration, and it all seemed to him perfectly correct, because he knew no more of heraldry or archæology than the gifted artists who usually drew the pictures for the historical romances. The scene was indeed ""exactly like a picture."" He admired it all so much that he felt braver than ever.",leader glorious creature see picture admire historical romance have armor helmet horse crest feather shield lance sword armor weapon sure different period shield thirteenth century sword pattern use peninsular cuirass time helmet date second arm shield grand red running lion blue ground tent late brand approve modern whole appearance camp army leader shock dumb admiration seem correct know more heraldry archæology gift artist draw picture historical romance scene picture admire feel brave 
33,"""Come hither, lad,"" said the glorious leader, when the men in Cromwellian steel-caps had said a few low eager words. And he took off his helmet, because he could not see properly with it on.

The only difficulty was that he knew he could never remember enough ""quothas"" and ""beshrew me's,"" and things like that, to make his talk sound like the talk of a boy in a historical romance. However, he began boldly enough, with a sentence straight out of _Ralph de Courcy; or, The Boy Crusader_.

There was a window in a little room at the bottom of the round turret up which the stair wound, rather larger than the other windows, and looking through it they saw that the drawbridge was up and the portcullis down; the moat looked very wide and deep.
