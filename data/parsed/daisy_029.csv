4," Tranquility only lasted until Mr. Ernescliffe found it necessary to understand on what terms he was to stand. Every one was tender of conscience, anxious to do right, and desirous to yield to the opinion that nobody could, or would give. While Alan begged for a positive engagement, Margaret scrupled to exchange promises that she might never be able to fulfil, and both agreed to leave all to her father, who, in every way, ought to have the best ability to judge whether there was unreasonable presumption in such a betrothal; but this very ability only served to perplex the poor doctor more and more. It is far easier for a man to decide when he sees only one bearing of a case, than when, like Dr. May, he not only sees them, but is rent by them in his inmost heart. Sympathising in turn with each lover, bitterly accusing his own carelessness as the cause of all their troubles, his doubts contending with his hopes, his conviction clashing with Sir Matthew Fleet’s opinion, his conscientious sincerity and delicacy conflicting with his affection and eagerness, he was perfectly incapable of coming to a decision, and suffered so cruelly, that Margaret was doubly distressed for his sake, and Alan felt himself guilty of having rendered everybody miserable.",tranquility last find necessary understand term stand one tender conscience anxious do right desirous yield opinion give begg positive engagement scruple exchange promise able fulfil agree leave father way have good ability judge be unreasonable presumption betrothal very ability serve perplex poor doctor more easy man decide see bear case see rent inmost heart sympathise turn lover accuse own carelessness cause trouble doubt contend hope conviction clash opinion conscientious sincerity delicacy conflict affection eagerness incapable come decision suffer distressed sake feel guilty render miserable 
5,"Dr. May could not conceal his trouble, and rendered Ethel almost as unhappy as himself, after each conversation with her, though her hopes usually sprang up again, and she had a happy conviction that this was only the second volume of the novel. Flora was not often called into his councils; confidence never came spontaneously from Dr. May to her; there was something that did not draw it forth towards her, whether it resided in that half-sarcastic corner of her steady blue eye, or in the grave common-sense of her gentle voice. Her view of the case was known to be that there was no need for so much perplexity--why should not Alan be the best judge of his own happiness? If Margaret were to be delicate for life, it would be better to have such a home to look to; and she soothed and comforted Margaret, and talked in a strain of unmixed hope and anticipation that often drew a smile from her sister, though she feared to trust to it.",conceal trouble render unhappy conversation hope spring have happy conviction second volume novel call council confidence come be draw reside half sarcastic corner steady blue eye grave common sense gentle voice view case know be need much perplexity good judge own happiness delicate life good have home look sooth comfort talk strain unmixed hope anticipation draw smile sister fear trust 
6,"Flora’s tact and consideration in keeping the children away when the lovers could best be alone, and letting them in when the discussion was becoming useless and harassing, her cheerful smiles, her evening music that covered all sounds, her removal of all extra annoyances, were invaluable, and Margaret appreciated them, as, indeed, Flora took care that she should.",tact consideration keep child lover alone let discussion become useless harass cheerful smile evening music cover sound removal extra annoyance invaluable appreciate take care 
7,"Margaret begged to know her eldest brother’s judgment, but had great difficulty in dragging it out. Diffidently as it was proposed, it was clear and decided. He thought that his father had better send Sir Matthew Fleet a statement of Margaret’s present condition, and abide by his answer as to whether her progress warranted the hope of her restoration.",begg know old brother judgment have great difficulty drag propose clear decide think father send statement present condition abide answer progress warrant hope restoration 
8,"Never was Richard more surprised than by the gratitude with which his suggestion was hailed, simple as it was, so that it seemed obvious that others should have already thought of it. After the tossings of uncertainty, it was a positive relief to refer the question to some external voice, and only Ethel and Norman expressed strong dislike to Sir Matthew becoming the arbiter of Margaret’s fate, and were scarcely pacified by Dr. May’s assurance that he had not revealed the occasion of his inquiry. The letter was sent, and repose returned, but hearts beat high on the morning when the answer was expected.",surprise gratitude suggestion hail simple seem obvious other think tossing uncertainty positive relief refer question external voice express strong dislike become arbiter fate pacify assurance reveal occasion inquiry letter send repose return heart beat high morning answer expect 
9,"Dr. May watched the moment when his daughter was alone, carried the letter to her, and kissing her, said, with an oppressed voice, “I give you joy, my dear.”",watch moment daughter alone carry letter kiss say oppress voice give joy dear 
10,"She read with suspended breath and palpitating heart. Sir Matthew thought her improvement sure, though slow, and had barely a doubt that, in a year, she would have regained her full strength and activity.",read suspend breath palpitate heart think improvement sure slow have doubt year regain full strength activity 
11,"“You will show it to Alan,” said Dr. May, as Margaret lifted her eyes to his face inquiringly.",show say lift eye face 
12,“Will not you?” she said.,say 
13,"“I cannot,” he answered. “I wish I was more helpful to you, my child,”  he added wistfully, “but you will rest on him, and be happy together while he stays, will you not?”",answer wish helpful child add rest happy stay 
14,"“Indeed I will, dear papa.”",dear papa 
15,"Mr. Ernescliffe was with her as the doctor quitted her. She held the letter to him, “But,” she said slowly, “I see that papa does not believe it.”",doctor quit hold letter say see papa believe 
16,"“You promised to abide by it!” he exclaimed, between entreaty and authority.",promise abide exclaim entreaty authority 
17,“I do; if you choose so to risk your hopes.”,choose risk hope

20,"“Despondency and self-reproach made him morbidly anxious. Believe so, my Margaret! You know he is no surgeon!”",despondency self reproach make anxious believe know surgeon 
21,"“His education included that line,” said Margaret. “I believe he has all but the manual dexterity. However, I would fain have faith in Sir Matthew,” she added, smiling, “and perhaps I am only swayed by the habit of thinking that papa must know best.”",education include line say believe have manual dexterity have faith add smile sway habit think papa know good 
22,"“He does in indifferent cases; but it is an old axiom, that a medical man should not prescribe for his own family; above all, in such a case, where it is but reasonable to believe an unprejudiced stranger, who alone is cool enough to be relied on. I absolutely depend on him!”",do indifferent case old axiom medical man prescribe own family case reasonable believe unprejudiced stranger cool rely depend 
23,"Margaret absolutely depended on the bright cheerful look of conviction. “Yes,” she said, “we will try to make papa take pleasure in the prospect. Perhaps I could do more if I made the attempt.”",depend bright cheerful look conviction say try make papa take pleasure prospect do more make attempt 
24,"“I am sure you could, if you would let me give you more support. If I were but going to remain with you!”",sure let give more support go remain 
25,"“Don’t let us be discontented,” said Margaret, smiling, “when so much more has been granted than I dare to hope. Be it as it may, let us be happy in what we have.”",let discontent say smile more grant dare hope let happy have 
26,"“It makes you happy?” said he, archly reading her face to draw out the avowal, but he only made her hide it, with a mute caress of the hand that held hers. She was glad enough to rest in the present, now that everything concurred to satisfy her conscience in so doing, and come what might, the days now spent together would be a possession of joy for ever.",make happy say read face draw avowal make hide mute caress hand hold glad rest present concurr satisfy conscience do come day spend possession joy 
27,"Captain Gordon contrived to afford his lieutenant another fortnight’s leave, perhaps because he was in dread of losing him altogether, for Alan had some doubts, and many longings to remain. Had it been possible to marry at once, he would have quitted the navy immediately; and he would have given worlds to linger beside Margaret’s couch, and claim her the first moment possible, believing his care more availing than all. He was, however, so pledged to Captain Gordon, that, without strong cause, he would not have been justified in withdrawing; besides, Harry was under his charge, and Dr. May and Margaret both thought, with the captain, that an active life would be a better occupation for him than watching her. He would never be able to settle down at his new home comfortably without her, and he would be more in the way of duty while pursuing his profession, so Margaret nerved herself against using her influence to detain him, and he thanked her for it.",contrive afford lieutenant fortnight leave dread lose have doubt many longing remain possible marry quit navy give world linger couch claim first moment possible believe care avail pledge strong cause justify withdraw charge think captain active life good occupation watch able settle new home way duty pursue profession nerve use influence detain thank 
28,"Though hope and affection could not an once repair an injured spine, they had wonderful powers in inciting Margaret to new efforts. Alan was as tender and ready of hand as Richard, and more clever and enterprising; and her unfailing trust in him prevented all alarms and misgivings, so that wonders were effected, and her father beheld her standing with so little support, looking so healthful and so blithe, that his forebodings melted away, and he talked joyously of the future.",hope affection repair injure spine have wonderful power incite new effort tender ready hand clever enterprising unfailing trust prevent alarm misgiving wonder effect father beheld standing little support look healthful blithe foreboding melt talk future 
29,"The great achievement was taking her round the garden. She could not bear the motion of wheels, but Alan adopted the hammock principle, and, with the aid of Richard and his crony, the carpenter, produced a machine in which no other power on earth could have prevailed on her to trust herself, but in which she was carried round the garden so successfully, that there was even a talk of next Sunday, and of the Minster.",great achievement take garden bear motion wheel adopt hammock principle aid crony carpenter produce machine other power earth prevail trust carry garden be talk next 
30,"It was safely accomplished, and tired as she was, Margaret felt, as she whispered to Alan, that he had now crowned all the joy that he had brought to her.",accomplish tired feel whisper crown joy bring 
31,"Ethel used to watch them, and think how beautiful their countenances were, and talk them over with her father, who was quite happy about them now. She gave assistance, which Alan never once called unhandy, to all his contrivances, and often floundered in upon his conferences with Margaret, in a way that would have been very provoking, if she had not always blushed and looked so excessively discomfited, and they had only to laugh and reassure her.",use watch think beautiful countenance talk father happy give assistance call unhandy contrivance flounder conference way provoking blush look discomfite have laugh reassure 
32,"Alan was struck by finding that the casual words spoken on the way from Cocksmoor had been so strenuously acted on, and he brought on himself a whole torrent of Ethel’s confused narratives, which Richard and Flora would fain have checked; but Margaret let them continue, as she saw him a willing listener, and was grateful to him for comprehending the ardent girl.",strike find casual word speak way act bring whole torrent confuse narrative check let continue see willing listener grateful comprehend ardent girl 
33,"He declared himself to have a share in the matter, reminding Ethel of her appeal to him to bind himself to the service of Cocksmoor. He sent a sovereign at once, to aid in a case of the sudden death of a pig; and when securely established in his brotherly right, he begged Ethel to let him know what would help her most. She stood colouring, twisting her hands, and wondering what to say, whereupon he relieved her by a proposal to leave an order for ten pounds, to be yearly paid into her hands, as a fixed income for her school.",declare have share matter remind appeal bind service send sovereign aid case sudden death pig establish brotherly right begg let know help most stand colour twist hand wonder say relieve proposal leave order pound pay hand fix income school 
34,"A thousand a year could hardly have been so much to Ethel. “Thank you! Oh, this is charming! We could set up a regular school! Cherry Elwood is the very woman! Alan, you have made our fortune! Oh, Margaret, Margaret! I must go and tell Ritchie and Mary! This is the first real step to our church and all!”",year much thank charming set regular school very woman make fortune go tell first real step church 
35,"“May I do it?” said Alan, turning to Margaret, as Ethel frantically burst out of the room; “perhaps I should have asked leave?”",do say turn burst room ask leave 
36,"“I was going to thank you,” said Margaret. “It is the very kindest thing you could have done by dear Ethel! the greatest comfort to us. She will be at peace now, when anything hinders her from going to Cocksmoor.”",go thank say kindest thing do dear great comfort peace hinder go 
37,"“I wonder,” said Alan, musing, “whether we shall ever be able to help her more substantially. I cannot do anything hastily, for you know Maplewood is still in the hands of the executors, and I cannot tell what claims there may be upon me; but by-and-by, when I return, if I find no other pressing duty, might not a church at Cocksmoor be a thankoffering for all I have found here?”",wonder say musing able help do know hand executor tell claim return find other press duty church thankoffering find 
38,"“Oh, Alan, what joy it would be!”",joy 
39,"“It is a long way off,” he said sadly; “and perhaps her force of perseverance will have prevailed alone.”",long way say force perseverance prevail 
40,"“I suppose I must not tell her, even as a vision.”",suppose tell vision 
41,"“It is too uncertain; I do not know the wants of the Maplewood people, and I must provide for Hector. I would not let these vague dreams interfere with her resolute work; but, Margaret, what a vision it is! I can see you laying the first stone on that fine heathy brow.”",uncertain know want person provide let vague dream interfere resolute work vision see lay first stone fine heathy brow 
42,"“Oh, your godchild should lay the first stone!”",godchild lay first stone 
43,"“She shall, and you shall lead her. And there shall be Ethel’s sharp face full of indescribable things as she marshals her children, and Richard shall be curate, and read in his steady soft tone, and your father shall look sunny with his boys around him, and you--”",lead sharp face full indescribable thing marshal child curate read steady soft tone father look sunny boy 
44,"“Oh, Alan,” said Margaret, who had been listening with a smile, “it is, indeed, a long way off!”",say listen smile long way 
45,"“I shall look to it as the haven where I would be,” said the sailor.",look haven say sailor 
46,"They often spoke together of this scheme, ever decking it in brighter colours. The topic seemed to suit them better than their own future, for there was no dwelling on that without an occasional misgiving, and the more glad the anticipation, the deeper the sigh that followed on Margaret’s part, till Mr. Ernescliffe followed her lead, and they seldom spoke of these uncertainties, but outwardly smiled over the present, inwardly dwelt on the truly certain hopes. There were readings shared together, made more precious than all, by the conversations that ensued.",speak scheme decking bright colour topic seem suit good own future be dwelling occasional misgiving glad anticipation deep sigh follow part follow lead speak uncertainty smile present dwele certain hope be reading share make precious conversation ensue 
47,"The hour for parting came at last. Ethel never knew what passed in the drawing-room, whence every one was carefully excluded. Dr. May wandered about, keeping guard over the door, and watching the clock, till, at the last moment, he knocked, and called in a trembling voice, “Ernescliffe! Alan! it is past the quarter! You must not stay!”",hour parting come last know pass draw room one exclude wander keep guard door watch clock last moment knock call tremble voice quarter stay 
48,"The other farewells were hurried; Alan seemed voiceless, only nodding in reply to Mary’s vociferous messages to Harry, and huskily whispering to Ethel, “Good luck to Cocksmoor!”",other farewell hurry seem voiceless nodd reply vociferous message whisper good luck 
49,"The next moment the door had shut on him, and Dr. May and Flora had gone to her sister, whom she found not tearful, but begging to be left alone.",next moment door shut go sister find tearful begg leave alone 
50,"When they saw her again, she was cheerful; she kept up her composure and animation without flagging, nor did she discontinue her new exertions, but seemed decidedly the happier for all that had passed.",see cheerful keep composure animation flagg discontinue new exertion seem happy pass 
51,"Letters came every day for her, and presents to every one. Ethel had a gold chain and eyeglass, which, it was hoped, might cure her of frowning and stooping, though her various ways of dangling her new possession caused her to be so much teased by Flora and Norman, that, but for regard to Margaret’s feelings, she would not have worn it for three days.",letter come day present one have gold chain eyeglass hope cure frown stoop various way dangle new possession cause tease regard feeling wear day 
52,"To Mary was sent a daguerreotype of Harry, her glory and delight. Say, who would, that it had pig’s eyes, a savage frown, a pudding chin, there were his own tight rings of hair, his gold-banded cap, his bright buttons, how could she prize it enough? She exhibited it to the little ones ten times a day, she kissed it night and morning, and registered her vow always to sleep with it under her “pilow,” in a letter of thanks, which Margaret defended and despatched, in spite of Miss Winter’s horrors at its disregard of orthography.",send daguerreotype glory delight say have pig eye savage frown pudding chin be own tight ring hair gold band cap bright button prize exhibit little one time day kiss night morning register vow sleep pilow letter thanks defend despatch spite horror disregard orthography 
53,"It was nearly the last letter before the Alcestis was heard of at Spithead. Then she sailed; she sent in her letters to Plymouth, and her final greetings by a Falmouth cutter--poor Harry’s wild scrawl in pencil looking very sea-sick.",last letter hear sail send letter final greeting cutter poor wild scrawl pencil look sea sick 
54," “Dear papa and all, good-bye. We are out of sight of land. Three years, and keep up a good heart. I shall soon be all right.",dear papa good bye sight land year keep good heart right 
55,                                       “Your H. MAY.”,
56," It was enclosed in Mr. Ernescliffe’s envelope, and with it came tidings that Harry’s brave spirit was not failing, even under untoward circumstances, but he had struggled on deck, and tried to write, when all his contemporaries had given in; in fact, he was a fine fellow--every one liked him, and Captain Gordon, though chary of commendation, had held him up to the other youngsters as an example of knowing what a sailor was meant to be like.",enclose envelope come tiding brave spirit fail untoward circumstance struggle deck try write contemporary give fact fine fellow one like chary commendation hold other youngster example know sailor mean 
57,"Margaret smiled, and cried over the news when she imparted it--but all serenely--and though she was glad to be alone, and wrote journals for Alan, when she could not send letters, she exerted herself to be the same sister as usual to the rest of the household, and not to give way to her wandering musings.",smile cry news impart glad alone write journal send letter exert same sister usual rest household give way wonder musing 
58,"From one subject her attention never strayed. Ethel had never found any lack of sympathy in her for her Cocksmoor pursuits; but the change now showed that, where once Margaret had been interested merely as a kind sister, she now had a personal concern, and she threw herself into all that related to it as her own chief interest and pursuit--becoming the foremost in devising plans, and arranging the best means of using Mr. Ernescliffe’s benefaction.",subject attention stray find lack sympathy pursuit change show interested kind sister have personal concern throw related own chief interest pursuit become foremost devise plan arrange good means use benefaction 
59,"The Elwood family had grown in the good opinion of the Mays. Charity had hobbled to church, leaning on her father’s arm, and being invited to dinner in the kitchen, the acquaintance had been improved, and nurse herself had pronounced her such a tidy, good sort of body, that it was a pity she had met with such a misfortune. If Miss Ethel brought in nothing but the like of her, they should be welcome; poor thing, how tired she was!",family grow good opinion hobble church lean father arm invite dinner kitchen acquaintance improve nurse pronounce tidy good sort body pity meet misfortune bring like welcome poor thing tired 
60,"Nurse’s opinions were apt to be sagacious, especially when in the face of her prejudices, and this gave Margaret confidence. Cherry proved to have been carefully taught by a good clergyman and his wife, and to be of very different stamp from the persons to whom the girls were accustomed. They were charmed with her, and eagerly offered to supply her with books--respecting her the more when they found that Mr. Hazlewood had already lent her their chief favourites. Other and greater needs they had no power to fill up.",nurse opinion apt sagacious face prejudice give confidence prove teach good clergyman wife different stamp person girl accustom charm offer supply book respect more find loan chief favourite other great need have power fill 
61,"“It is so lone without the church bells, you see, miss,” said Mrs. Elwood. “Our tower had a real fine peal, and my man was one of the ringers. I seems quite lost without them, and there was Cherry, went a’most every day with the children.”",lone church bell see miss say tower have real fine peal man ringer seem lose be go day child 
62,"“Every day!” cried Mary, looking at her with respect.",day cry look respect 
63,"“It was so near,” said Cherry, “I could get there easy, and I got used to it when I was at school.”",near say get easy use school 
64,“Did it not take up a great deal of time?” said Ethel.,take great deal time say 
65,"“Why, you see, ma’am, it came morning and night, out of working times, and I can’t be stirring much.”",see come morning night working time stir much 
66,“Then you miss it sadly?” said Ethel.,miss say 
67,"“Yes, ma’am, it made the day go on well like, and settled a body’s mind, when I fretted for what could not be helped. But I try not to fret after it now, and Mr. Hazlewood said, if I did my best wherever I was, the Lord would still join our prayers together.”",make day go settle body mind fret help try fret say do good join prayer 
68,"Mr. Hazlewood was recollected by Mr. Wilmot as an old college friend, and a correspondence with him fully confirmed the favourable estimate of the Elwoods, and was decisive in determining that the day-school, with Alan’s ten pounds as salary, and a penny a week from each child, should be offered to Cherry.",recollect old college friend correspondence confirm favourable estimate decisive determine day school pound salary penny week child offer 
69,"Mr. Hazlewood answered for her sound excellence, and aptitude for managing little children, though he did not promise genius, such as should fulfil the requirements of modern days. With these Cocksmoor could dispense at present; Cherry was humbly gratified, and her parents delighted with the honour and profit; there was a kitchen which afforded great facilities, and Richard and his carpenter managed the fitting to admiration; Margaret devised all manner of useful arrangements, settled matters with great earnestness, saw Cherry frequently, discussed plans, and learned the history and character of each child, as thoroughly as Ethel herself. Mr. Ramsden himself came to the opening of the school, and said so much of the obligations of Cocksmoor to the young ladies, that Ethel would not have known which way to look, if Flora had not kindly borne the brunt of his compliments.",answer sound excellence aptitude manage little child promise genius such fulfil requirement modern day dispense present gratified parent delight honour profit be kitchen afford great facility carpenter manage fitting admiration devise manner useful arrangement settle matter great earnestness see discuss plan learn history character child come opening school say much obligation young lady know way look borne brunt compliment 
70,"Every one was pleased, except Mrs. Green, who took upon herself to set about various malicious reports of Cherry Elwood; but nobody cared for them, except Mrs. Elwood, who flew into such passions, that Ethel was quite disappointed in her, though not in Cherry, who meekly tried to silence her mother, begged the young ladies not to be vexed, and showed a quiet dignity that soon made the shafts of slander fall inoffensively.",one pleased take set various malicious report care fly such passion disappointed try silence mother begg young lady vex show quiet dignity make shaft slander fall 
71,"All went well; there was a school instead of a hubbub, clean faces instead of dirty, shining hair instead of wild elf-locks, orderly children instead of little savages. The order and obedience that Ethel could not gain in six months, seemed impressed in six days by Cherry; the neat work made her popular with the mothers, her firm gentleness won the hearts of the children, and the kitchen was filled not only with boys and girls from the quarry, but with some little ones from outlying cottages of Fordholm and Abbotstoke, and there was even a smart little farmer, who had been unbearable at home.",go be school hubbub clean face dirty shine hair wild elf lock orderly child little savage order obedience gain month seem impressed day neat work make popular mother firm gentleness win heart child kitchen fill boy girl quarry little one outly cottage be smart little farmer unbearable home 
72,"Margaret’s unsuccessful bath-chair was lent to Cherry, and in it her scholars drew her to Stoneborough every Sunday, and slowly began to redeem their character with the ladies, who began to lose the habit of shrinking out of their way--the Stoneborough children did so instead; and Flora and Ethel were always bringing home stories of injustice to their scholars, fancied or real, and of triumphs in their having excelled any national school girl. The most stupid children at Cocksmoor always seemed to them wise in comparison with the Stoneborough girls, and the Sunday-school might have become to Ethel a school of rivalry, if Richard had not opened her eyes by a quiet observation, that the town girls seemed to fare as ill with her, as the Cocksmoor girls did with the town ladies. Then she caught herself up, tried to be candid, and found that she was not always impartial in her judgments. Why would competition mingle even in the best attempts?",unsuccessful bath chair loan scholar draw begin redeem character lady begin lose habit shrink way child bring home story injustice scholar fancy real triumph excell national school girl stupid child seem wise comparison girl school become school rivalry open eye quiet observation town girl seem fare ill girl do town lady catch try candid find impartial judgment competition mingle good attempt 
73,"Cherry did not so bring forward her scholars that Ethel could have many triumphs of this dangerous kind. Indeed, Ethel was often vexed with her; for though she taught needlework admirably, and enforced correct reading, and reverent repetition, her strong provincial dialect was a stumbling-block; she could not put questions without book, and nothing would teach her Ethel’s rational system of arithmetic. That she was a capital dame, and made the children very good, was allowed; but now and then, when mortified by hearing what was done at Stoneborough, Fordholm, or Abbotstoke, Ethel would make vigorous efforts, which resulted only in her coming home fuming at Cherry’s “outrageous dullness.”",bring scholar have many triumph dangerous kind vex teach needlework enforce correct reading reverent repetition strong provincial dialect stumbling block put question book teach rational system arithmetic capital dame make child good allow mortify hear do make vigorous effort result come home fume outrageous dullness 
74,"These railings always hurt Margaret, who had made Cherry almost into a friend, and generally liked to have a visit from her during the Sunday, when she always dined with the servants. Then school questions, Cocksmoor news, and the tempers of the children, were talked over, and Cherry was now and then drawn into home reminiscences, and descriptions of the ways of her former school. There was no fear of spoiling her--notice from her superiors was natural to her, and she had the lady-likeness of womanly goodness, so as never to go beyond her own place. She had had many trials too, and Margaret learned the true history of them, as she won Cherry’s confidence, and entered into them, feeling their likeness, yet dissimilarity, to her own.",railing hurt make friend like have visit dine servant school question news temper child talk draw home reminiscence description way former school be fear spoil notice superior natural have lady likeness womanly goodness go own place have many trial learn true history win confidence enter feel likeness dissimilarity own 
75,"Cherry had been a brisk happy girl in a good place, resting in one of the long engagements that often extend over half the life of a servant, enjoying the nod of her baker as he left his bread, and her walk from church with him on alternate Sundays. But poor Cherry had been exposed to the perils of window-cleaning; and, after a frightful fall, had wakened to find herself in a hospital, and her severe sufferings had left her a cripple for life.",brisk happy girl good place rest long engagement extend life servant enjoy nod baker leave bread walk church alternate poor expose peril window cleaning frightful fall waken find hospital severe suffering leave cripple life 
76,"And the baker had not been an Alan Ernescliffe! She did not complain of him--he had come to see her, and had been much grieved, but she had told him she could never be a useful wife; and, before she had used her crutches, he was married to her pretty fellow-servant.",baker complain come see grieve tell useful wife use crutch marry pretty fellow servant 
77,"Cherry spoke very simply; she hoped it was better for Long, and believed Susan would make him a good wife. Ethel would have thought she did not feel, but Margaret knew better.",speak hope good believe make good wife think feel know good 
78,"She stroked the thin slight fingers, and gently said, “Poor Cherry!” and Cherry wiped away a tear, and said, “Yes, ma’am, thank you, it is best for him. I should not have wished him to grieve for what cannot be helped.”",stroke thin slight finger say poor wipe tear say thank good wish grieve help 
79,“Resignation is the great comfort.”,resignation great comfort

81,"Margaret sighed, as she remembered certain thoughts before Alan’s return.",sigh remember certain thought return 
82,"“Then, ma’am, there has been such goodness! I did vex at being a poor helpless thing, nothing but a burden on father; and when we had to go from home, and Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood and all, I can’t tell you how bad it was, ma’am.”",be such goodness vex poor helpless thing burden father have go home tell bad 
83,“Then you are comforted now?”,comfort 
84,"“Yes, ma’am,” said Cherry, brightening. “It seems as if He had given me something to do, and there are you, and Mr. Richard, and Miss Ethel, to help. I should like, please God, to be of some good to those poor children.”",say brighten seem give do be help like good poor child 
85,"“I am sure you will, Cherry; I wish I could do as much.”",sure wish do much 
86,"Cherry’s tears had come again. “Ah! ma’am, you--” and she stopped short, and rose to depart. Margaret held out her hand to wish her good-bye. “Please, miss, I was thinking how Mr. Hazlewood said that God fits our place to us, and us to our place.”",tear come stop short rise depart hold hand wish good bye miss think say fit place place 
87,"“Thank you, Cherry, you are leaving me something to remember.”",thank leave remember 
88,"And Margaret lay questioning with herself, whether the schoolmistress had not been the most self-denying of the two; but withal gazing on the hoop of pearls which Alan had chosen as the ring of betrothal.",lay question schoolmistress self deny gaze hoop pearl choose ring betrothal 
89,"“The pearl of great price,” murmured she to herself; “if we hold that, the rest will soon matter but little. It remaineth that both they that have wives, be as they that have none, and they that weep, as though they wept not, and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not! If ever Alan and I have a home together upon earth, may all too confident joy be tempered by the fears that we have begun with! I hope this probation may make me less likely to be taken up with the cares and pleasures of his position than I might have been last year. He is one who can best help the mind to go truly upward.
