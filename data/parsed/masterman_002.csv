1,CHAPTER 2.,
2,"Master William, whom we have introduced to the reader, was the eldest boy of a family who were passengers on board, consisting of the father, mother, and four children: his father was a Mr Seagrave, a very well-informed, clever man, who having for many years held an office under government at Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, was now returning from a leave of absence of three years.  He had purchased from the government several thousand acres of land; it had since risen very much in value, and the sheep and cattle which he had put on it were proving a source of great profit.  His property had been well managed by the person who had charge of it during his absence in England, and he was now taking out with him a variety of articles of every description for its improvement, and for his own use, such as furniture for his house, implements of agriculture, seeds, plants, cattle, and many other things too numerous to mention.",introduce reader old boy family passenger board consist father mother child father inform clever man have many year hold office government capital new return leave absence year purchase government several acre land rise value sheep cattle put prove source great profit property manage person have charge absence take variety article description improvement own use such furniture house implement agriculture seed plant cattle many other thing numerous mention 
3,"Mrs Seagrave was an amiable woman, but not in very strong health.  The family consisted of William, who was the eldest, a clever, steady boy, but, at the same time, full of mirth and humour; Thomas, who was six years old, a very thoughtless but good-tempered boy, full of mischief, and always in a scrape; Caroline, a little girl of seven years; and Albert, a fine strong little fellow, who was not one year old: he was under the charge of a black girl, who had come from the Cape of Good Hope to Sydney, and had followed Mrs Seagrave to England.  We have now mentioned all the people on board of the Pacific: perhaps we ought not to forget two shepherd's dogs, belonging to Mr Seagrave, and a little terrier, which was a great favourite of Captain Osborn, to whom she belonged.",amiable woman strong health family consist old clever steady boy same time full mirth humour year old thoughtless good temper boy full mischief scrape little girl year fine strong little fellow year old charge black girl come good follow mention person board forget shepherd dog belong little terrier great favourite belong 
4,"It was not until the fourth day from its commencement that the gale abated, and then it gradually subsided until it was nearly a calm.  The men who had been watching night after night during the gale now brought all their clothes which had been drenched by the rain and spray, and hung them up in the rigging to dry: the sails, also, which had been furled, and had been saturated by the wet, were now loosened and spread out that they might not be mildewed.  The wind blew mild and soft, the sea had gone down, and the ship was running through the water at the speed of about four miles an hour.  Mrs Seagrave, wrapped up in a cloak, was seated upon one of the arm-chests near the stern of the ship, her husband and children were all with her enjoying the fine weather, when Captain Osborn, who had been taking an observation of the sun with his sextant, came up to them.",fourth day commencement gale abate subside calm man watch night night gale bring clothes drench rain spray hang rigging dry sail furl saturate wet loosen spread mildew wind blow mild soft sea go ship run water speed mile hour wrap cloak seat arm chest stern ship husband child enjoy fine weather take observation sun sextant come

16,"""Romulus and Remus,"" replied Mr Seagrave, ""were the names of two shepherds, brothers, who in ancient days founded the city of Rome, which eventually became the largest and most celebrated empire in the world. They were the first kings of Rome, and reigned together.  History says that Remus affronted Romulus by leaping over a wall he had raised, and Romulus, in his anger, took away his life; but the history of early days is not to be depended upon.""",reply name shepherd brother ancient day found city become large celebrate empire world first king reign history say affront leap wall raise anger take life history early day depend

19,"""Well, one lives and learns,"" said Ready.  ""I have learnt something to-day, which everyone will to the last day of his life, if he will only ask questions.  I'm an old man, and perhaps don't know much, except in the seafaring way; but I should have known much less if I did not ask for information, and was not ashamed to acknowledge my ignorance; that's the way to learn, Master William.""",life learn say ready learn day last day life ask question old man know much seafare way know less ask information ashamed acknowledge ignorance way learn
