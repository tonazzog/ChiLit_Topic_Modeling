2,"You will understand that the adventure of the Babylonian queen in London was the only one that had occupied any time at all. But the children’s time was very fully taken up by talking over all the wonderful things seen and done in the Past, where, by the power of the Amulet, they seemed to spend hours and hours, only to find when they got back to London that the whole thing had been briefer than a lightning flash.",understand adventure babylonian queen only one occupy time child time take talk wonderful thing see do power seem spend hour hour find get whole thing briefer lightning flash 
3,"They talked of the Past at their meals, in their walks, in the dining-room, in the first-floor drawing-room, but most of all on the stairs. It was an old house; it had once been a fashionable one, and was a fine one still. The banister rails of the stairs were excellent for sliding down, and in the corners of the landings were big alcoves that had once held graceful statues, and now quite often held the graceful forms of Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane.",talk meal walk dining room first floor draw room most stair old house fashionable one fine one banister rail stair excellent slide corner landing big alcove hold graceful statue hold graceful form

But the show ended abruptly because Robert wanted to be the Venus of Milo, and for this purpose pulled at the sheet which served for drapery at the very moment when Cyril, looking really quite like the Discobolos--with a gold and white saucer for the disc--was standing on one foot, and under that one foot was the sheet.",day tight white underclothing spend pleasant hour reproduce attitude statue see british big photograph book show end want purpose pull sheet serve drapery very moment look gold white saucer disc stand foot foot sheet

The quay was of marble, white and sparkling with a veining bright as gold. The city was of marble, red and white. The greater buildings that seemed to be temples and palaces were roofed with what looked like gold and silver, but most of the roofs were of copper that glowed golden-red on the houses on the hills among which the city stood, and shaded into marvellous tints of green and blue and purple where they had been touched by the salt sea spray and the fumes of the dyeing and smelting works of the lower town.",blue sea sparkle soft sunlight little white cap wave break marble breakwater guard shipping great city wilderness winter wind sea quay marble white sparkling veining bright gold city marble red white great building seem temple palace roof look gold silver most roof copper glow golden red house hill city stand shade marvellous tint green blue purple touch salt sea spray fume dyeing smelting work low town
