2," ""So _you_ were inside that bottle, were you?"" said Horace, blandly. ""How singular!"" He began to realise that he had to deal with an Oriental lunatic, and must humour him to some extent. Fortunately he did not seem at all dangerous, though undeniably eccentric-looking. His hair fell in disorderly profusion from under his high turban about his cheeks, which were of a uniform pale rhubarb tint; his grey beard streamed out in three thin strands, and his long, narrow eyes, opal in hue, and set rather wide apart and at a slight angle, had a curious expression, part slyness and part childlike simplicity.",bottle say singular begin realise have deal oriental lunatic humour extent seem dangerous eccentric look hair fall disorderly profusion high turban cheek uniform pale rhubarb tint grey beard stream thin strand long narrow eye opal hue set slight angle have curious expression part slyness part childlike simplicity 
3,"""Dost thou doubt that I speak truth? I tell thee that I have been confined in that accursed vessel for countless centuries--how long, I know not, for it is beyond calculation.""",doubt speak truth tell confine accurse vessel countless century know calculation 
4,"""I should hardly have thought from your appearance, sir, that you had been so many years in bottle as all that,"" said Horace, politely, ""but it's certainly time you had a change. May I, if it isn't indiscreet, ask how you came into such a very uncomfortable position? But probably you have forgotten by this time.""",think appearance sir many year bottle say time have change indiscreet ask come uncomfortable position forget time 
5,"""Forgotten!"" said the other, with a sombre red glow in his opal eyes. ""Wisely was it written: 'Let him that desireth oblivion confer benefits--but the memory of an injury endureth for ever.' _I_ forget neither benefits nor injuries.""",forgott say other sombre red glow opal eye write let desireth oblivion confer benefit memory injury endureth forget benefit injury 
6,"""An old gentleman with a grievance,"" thought Ventimore. ""And mad into the bargain. Nice person to have staying in the same house with one!""",old gentleman grievance think mad bargain nice person have stay same house 
7,"""Know, O best of mankind,"" continued the stranger, ""that he who now addresses thee is Fakrash-el-Aamash, one of the Green Jinn. And I dwelt in the Palace of the Mountain of the Clouds above the City of Babel in the Garden of Irem, which thou doubtless knowest by repute?""",know good mankind continue stranger address green dwele knowest repute 
8,"""I fancy I _have_ heard of it,"" said Horace, as if it were an address in the Court Directory. ""Delightful neighbourhood.""",fancy hear say address delightful neighbourhood 
9,"""I had a kinswoman, Bedeea-el-Jemal, who possessed incomparable beauty and manifold accomplishments. And seeing that, though a Jinneeyeh, she was of the believing Jinn, I despatched messengers to Suleyman the Great, the son of Daood, offering him her hand in marriage. But a certain Jarjarees, the son of Rejmoos, the son of Iblees--may he be for ever accursed!--looked with favour upon the maiden, and, going secretly unto Suleyman, persuaded him that I was preparing a crafty snare for the King's undoing.""",have kinswoman possess incomparable beauty manifold accomplishment see believe despatch messenger great son offer hand marriage certain son son accurse look favour maiden go persuade prepare crafty snare undoing 
10,"""And, of course, _you_ never thought of such a thing?"" said Ventimore.",course think thing say 
11,"""By a venomous tongue the fairest motives may be rendered foul,"" was the somewhat evasive reply. ""Thus it came to pass that Suleyman--on whom be peace!--listened unto the voice of Jarjarees and refused to receive the maiden. Moreover, he commanded that I should be seized and imprisoned in a bottle of brass and cast into the Sea of El-Karkar, there to abide the Day of Doom.""",venomous tongue fair motive render foul evasive reply come pass peace listen voice refuse receive maiden command seize imprison bottle brass cast abide 
12,"""Too bad--really too bad!"" murmured Horace, in a tone that he could only hope was sufficiently sympathetic.",bad bad murmure tone hope sympathetic 
13,"""But now, by thy means, O thou of noble ancestors and gentle disposition, my deliverance hath been accomplished; and if I were to serve thee for a thousand years, regarding nothing else, even thus could I not requite thee, and my so doing would be a small thing according to thy desserts!""",means noble ancestor gentle disposition deliverance have accomplish serve year regard else requite do small thing accord dessert 
14,"""Pray don't mention it,"" said Horace; ""only too pleased if I've been of any use to you.""",pray mention say pleased use 
15,"""In the sky it is written upon the pages of the air: 'He who doth kind actions shall experience the like.' Am I not an Efreet of the Jinn? Demand, therefore, and thou shalt receive.""",sky write page air kind action experience like demand receive 
16,"""Poor old chap!"" thought Horace, ""he's very cracked indeed. He'll be wanting to give me a present of some sort soon--and of course I can't have that.... My dear Mr. Fakrash,"" he said aloud, ""I've done nothing--nothing at all--and if I had, I couldn't possibly accept any reward for it.""",poor old chap think crack want give present sort course have dear say do have accept reward 
17,"""What are thy names, and what calling dost thou follow?""",name calling follow 
18,"""I ought to have introduced myself before--let me give you my card;"" and Ventimore gave him one, which the other took and placed in his girdle. ""That's my business address. I'm an architect, if you know what that is--a man who builds houses and churches--mosques, you know--in fact, anything, when he can get it to build.""",introduce let give card give other take place girdle business address architect know man build house church mosque know fact get build 
19,"""A useful calling indeed--and one to be rewarded with fine gold.""",useful calling reward fine gold 
20,"""In my case,"" Horace confessed, ""the reward has been too fine to be perceived. In other words, I've never _been_ rewarded, because I've never yet had the luck to get a client.""",case confess reward fine perceive other word reward have luck get client 
21,"""And what is this client of whom thou speakest?""",client speakest 
22,"""Oh, well, some well-to-do merchant who wants a house built for him and doesn't care how much he spends on it. There must be lots of them about--but they never seem to come in _my_ direction.""",do merchant want house build care much spend be lot seem come direction 
23,"""Grant me a period of delay, and, if it be possible, I will procure thee such a client.""",grant period delay possible procure client 
24,"Horace could not help thinking that any recommendation from such a quarter would hardly carry much weight; but, as the poor old man evidently imagined himself under an obligation, which he was anxious to discharge, it would have been unkind to throw cold water on his good intentions.",help think recommendation quarter carry much weight poor old man imagine obligation anxious discharge unkind throw cold water good intention 
25,"""My dear sir,"" he said lightly, ""if you _should_ come across that particular type of client, and can contrive to impress him with the belief that I'm just the architect he's looking out for--which, between ourselves, I am, though nobody's discovered it yet--if you can get him to come to me, you will do me the very greatest service I could ever hope for. But don't give yourself any trouble over it.""",dear sir say come particular type client contrive impress belief architect look discover get come do great service hope give trouble 
26,"""It will be one of the easiest things that can be,"" said his visitor, ""that is"" (and here a shade of rather pathetic doubt crossed his face) ""provided that anything of my former power yet remains unto me.""",easy thing say visitor shade pathetic doubt cross face provide former power remain 
27,"""Well, never mind, sir,"" said Horace; ""if you can't, I shall take the will for the deed.""",mind sir say take will deed 
28,"""First of all, it will be prudent to learn where Suleyman is, that I may humble myself before him and make my peace.""",first prudent learn humble make peace 
29,"""Yes,"" said Horace, gently, ""I would. I should make a point of that, sir. Not _now_, you know. He might be in bed. To-morrow morning.""",say make point sir know bed morning 
30,"""This is a strange place that I am in, and I know not yet in what direction I should seek him. But till I have found him, and justified myself in his sight, and had my revenge upon Jarjarees, mine enemy, I shall know no rest.""",strange place know direction seek find justify sight have revenge enemy know rest 
31,"""Well, but go to bed now, like a sensible old chap,"" said Horace, soothingly, anxious to prevent this poor demented Asiatic from falling into the hands of the police. ""Plenty of time to go and call on Suleyman to-morrow.""",go bed sensible old chap say anxious prevent poor demented fall hand police plenty time go call 
32,"""I will search for him, even unto the uttermost ends of the earth!""",search uttermost end earth 
33,"""That's right--you're sure to find him in one of them. Only, don't you see, it's no use starting to-night--the last trains have gone long ago."" As he spoke, the night wind bore across the square the sound of Big Ben striking the quarters in Westminster Clock Tower, and then, after a pause, the solemn boom that announced the first of the small hours. ""To-morrow,"" thought Ventimore, ""I'll speak to Mrs. Rapkin, and get her to send for a doctor and have him put under proper care--the poor old boy really isn't fit to go about alone!""",right sure find see use start night last train go speak night wind bear square sound big strike quarter pause solemn boom announce first small hour think speak get send doctor have put proper care poor old boy fit go alone

35,"""Oh, come!"" said Horace, ""after so many thousand years, a few hours more or less won't make any serious difference. And you _can't_ go out now--they've shut up the house. Do let me take you upstairs to your room, sir.""",come say many year few hour more make serious difference go shut house let take room sir 
36,"""Not so, for I must leave thee for a season, O young man of kind conduct. But may thy days be fortunate, and the gate never cease to be repaired, and the nose of him that envieth thee be rubbed in the dust, for love for thee hath entered into my heart, and if it be permitted unto me, I will cover thee with the veils of my protection!""",leave season young man kind conduct day fortunate gate cease repair nose envieth rub dust love have enter heart permit cover veil protection 
37,"As he finished this harangue the speaker seemed, to Ventimore's speechless amazement, to slip through the wall behind him. At all events, he had left the room somehow--and Horace found himself alone.",finish harangue speaker seem speechless amazement slip wall event leave room find alone 
38,"He rubbed the back of his head, which began to be painful. ""He can't really have vanished through the wall,"" he said to himself. ""That's too absurd. The fact is, I'm over-excited this evening--and no wonder, after all that's happened. The best thing I can do is to go to bed at once.""",rub back head begin painful vanish wall say absurd fact excite evening wonder happen good thing do go bed
