1,CHAPTER XIII. THE ATTACK,attack 
2,"Slowly, and without the slightest appearance of haste or excitement, the three columns crept on. When within about five hundred yards of us, the main or centre column halted at the root of a tongue of open plain which ran up into the hill, to give time to the other divisions to circumvent our position, which was shaped more or less in the form of a horse-shoe, with its two points facing towards the town of Loo. The object of this manoeuvre was that the threefold assault should be delivered simultaneously.",slight appearance haste excitement column creep yard main centre column halt root tongue open plain run hill give time other division circumvent position shape less form horse shoe point face town object manoeuvre threefold assault deliver 
3,"""Oh, for a gatling!"" groaned Good, as he contemplated the serried phalanxes beneath us. ""I would clear that plain in twenty minutes.""",gatling groan good contemplate serry phalanxe clear plain minute 
4,"""We have not got one, so it is no use yearning for it; but suppose you try a shot, Quatermain,"" said Sir Henry. ""See how near you can go to that tall fellow who appears to be in command. Two to one you miss him, and an even sovereign, to be honestly paid if ever we get out of this, that you don't drop the bullet within five yards.""",get use yearn suppose try shot say see go tall fellow appear command miss sovereign pay get drop bullet yard 
5," This piqued me, so, loading the express with solid ball, I waited till my friend walked some ten yards out from his force, in order to get a better view of our position, accompanied only by an orderly; then, lying down and resting the express on a rock, I covered him. The rifle, like all expresses, was only sighted to three hundred and fifty yards, so to allow for the drop in trajectory I took him half-way down the neck, which ought, I calculated, to find him in the chest. He stood quite still and gave me every opportunity, but whether it was the excitement or the wind, or the fact of the man being a long shot, I don't know, but this was what happened. Getting dead on, as I thought, a fine sight, I pressed, and when the puff of smoke had cleared away, to my disgust, I saw my man standing there unharmed, whilst his orderly, who was at least three paces to the left, was stretched upon the ground apparently dead. Turning swiftly, the officer I had aimed at began to run towards his men in evident alarm.",pique load express solid ball wait friend walk yard force order get good view position accompany orderly lie rest express rock cover rifle express sight yard allow drop trajectory take half way neck calculate find chest stand give opportunity excitement wind fact man long shot know happen get dead think fine sight press puff smoke clear disgust see man stand unharmed orderly least pace left stretch ground dead turn officer aim begin run man evident alarm 
6,"""Bravo, Quatermain!"" sang out Good; ""you've frightened him.""",sing good frighten 
7,"This made me very angry, for, if possible to avoid it, I hate to miss in public. When a man is master of only one art he likes to keep up his reputation in that art. Moved quite out of myself at my failure, I did a rash thing. Rapidly covering the general as he ran, I let drive with the second barrel. Instantly the poor man threw up his arms, and fell forward on to his face. This time I had made no mistake; and--I say it as a proof of how little we think of others when our own safety, pride, or reputation is in question--I was brute enough to feel delighted at the sight.",make angry possible avoid hate miss public man master art like keep reputation art move failure do rash thing cover general run let drive second barrel poor man throw arm fall face time make mistake say proof little think other own safety pride reputation question brute feel delighted sight 
8,"The regiments who had seen the feat cheered wildly at this exhibition of the white man's magic, which they took as an omen of success, while the force the general had belonged to--which, indeed, as we ascertained afterwards, he had commanded--fell back in confusion. Sir Henry and Good now took up their rifles and began to fire, the latter industriously ""browning"" the dense mass before him with another Winchester repeater, and I also had another shot or two, with the result, so far as we could judge, that we put some six or eight men _hors de combat_ before they were out of range.",regiment see feat cheer exhibition white man magic take omen success force general belong ascertain command fall confusion take rifle begin fire latter brown dense mass repeater have shot result judge put man range 
9,"Just as we stopped firing there came an ominous roar from our far right, then a similar roar rose on our left. The two other divisions were engaging us.",stop fire come ominous roar right similar roar rise left other division engage 
10,"At the sound, the mass of men before us opened out a little, and advanced towards the hill and up the spit of bare grass land at a slow trot, singing a deep-throated song as they ran. We kept up a steady fire from our rifles as they came, Ignosi joining in occasionally, and accounted for several men, but of course we produced no more effect upon that mighty rush of armed humanity than he who throws pebbles does on the breaking wave.",sound mass man open little advance hill spit bare grass land slow trot sing deep throated song run keep steady fire rifle come join account several man course produce more effect mighty rush armed humanity throw pebble breaking wave 
11,"On they came, with a shout and the clashing of spears; now they were driving in the pickets we had placed among the rocks at the foot of the hill. After that the advance was a little slower, for though as yet we had offered no serious opposition, the attacking forces must climb up hill, and they came slowly to save their breath. Our first line of defence was about half-way down the side of the slope, our second fifty yards further back, while our third occupied the edge of the plateau.",come shout clashing spear drive picket place rock foot hill advance little slow offer serious opposition attack force climb hill come save breath first line defence half way side slope second yard third occupy edge plateau 
12,"On they stormed, shouting their war-cry, ""_Twala! Twala! Chiele! Chiele!_"" (Twala! Twala! Smite! Smite!) ""_Ignosi! Ignosi! Chiele! Chiele!_"" answered our people. They were quite close now, and the _tollas_, or throwing-knives, began to flash backwards and forwards, and now with an awful yell the battle closed in.",storm shouting war cry smite smite answer person close _tollas_ throw knife begin flash forward awful yell battle close 
13,"To and fro swayed the mass of struggling warriors, men falling fast as leaves in an autumn wind; but before long the superior weight of the attacking force began to tell, and our first line of defence was slowly pressed back till it merged into the second. Here the struggle was very fierce, but again our people were driven back and up, till at length, within twenty minutes of the commencement of the fight, our third line came into action.",sway mass struggle warrior man fall leave autumn wind superior weight attack force begin tell first line defence press merge second struggle fierce person drive length minute commencement fight third line come action 
14,"But by this time the assailants were much exhausted, and besides had lost many men killed and wounded, and to break through that third impenetrable hedge of spears proved beyond their powers. For a while the seething lines of savages swung backwards and forwards, in the fierce ebb and flow of battle, and the issue was doubtful. Sir Henry watched the desperate struggle with a kindling eye, and then without a word he rushed off, followed by Good, and flung himself into the hottest of the fray. As for myself, I stopped where I was.",time assailant exhaust lose many man kill wound break third impenetrable hedge spear prove power while seethe line savage swing forward fierce ebb flow battle issue doubtful watch desperate struggle kindle eye word rush follow flung hot fray stop 
15,"The soldiers caught sight of his tall form as he plunged into battle, and there rose a cry of--",soldier catch sight tall form plunge battle rise cry 
16,"""_Nanzia Incubu! Nanzia Unkungunklovo!_"" (Here is the Elephant!) ""_Chiele! Chiele!_""",
17,"From that moment the end was no longer in doubt. Inch by inch, fighting with splendid gallantry, the attacking force was pressed back down the hillside, till at last it retreated upon its reserves in something like confusion. At that instant, too, a messenger arrived to say that the left attack had been repulsed; and I was just beginning to congratulate myself, believing that the affair was over for the present, when, to our horror, we perceived our men who had been engaged in the right defence being driven towards us across the plain, followed by swarms of the enemy, who had evidently succeeded at this point.",moment end doubt inch inch fight splendid gallantry attack force press hillside last retreat reserve confusion instant messenger arrive say left attack repulse begin congratulate believe affair present horror perceive man engage right defence drive plain follow swarm enemy succeed point 
18,"Ignosi, who was standing by me, took in the situation at a glance, and issued a rapid order. Instantly the reserve regiment around us, the Greys, extended itself.",stand take situation glance issue rapid order reserve regiment extend 
19,"Again Ignosi gave a word of command, which was taken up and repeated by the captains, and in another second, to my intense disgust, I found myself involved in a furious onslaught upon the advancing foe. Getting as much as I could behind Ignosi's huge frame, I made the best of a bad job, and toddled along to be killed as though I liked it. In a minute or two--we were plunging through the flying groups of our men, who at once began to re-form behind us, and then I am sure I do not know what happened. All I can remember is a dreadful rolling noise of the meeting of shields, and the sudden apparition of a huge ruffian, whose eyes seemed literally to be starting out of his head, making straight at me with a bloody spear. But--I say it with pride--I rose--or rather sank--to the occasion. It was one before which most people would have collapsed once and for all. Seeing that if I stood where I was I must be killed, as the horrid apparition came I flung myself down in front of him so cleverly that, being unable to stop himself, he took a header right over my prostrate form. Before he could rise again, _I_ had risen and settled the matter from behind with my revolver.",give word command take repeat captain second intense disgust find involve furious onslaught advance foe get much huge frame make good bad job toddle kill like minute plung fly group man begin re-form sure know happen remember dreadful roll noise meeting shield sudden apparition huge ruffian eye seem start head make bloody spear say pride rise sink occasion most person collapse see stand kill horrid apparition come flung front unable stop take header prostrate form rise rise settle matter revolver

27,"""They are repulsed at every point for a while. The loss is dreadfully heavy; we have quite two thousand killed and wounded, and they must have lost three. Look, there's a sight!"" and he pointed to long lines of men advancing by fours.",repulse point while loss heavy have kill wound lose look be sight point long line man advance four 
28,"In the centre of every group of four, and being borne by it, was a kind of hide tray, of which a Kukuana force always carries a quantity, with a loop for a handle at each corner. On these trays--and their number seemed endless--lay wounded men, who as they arrived were hastily examined by the medicine men, of whom ten were attached to a regiment. If the wound was not of a fatal character the sufferer was taken away and attended to as carefully as circumstances would allow. But if, on the other hand, the injured man's condition proved hopeless, what followed was very dreadful, though doubtless it may have been the truest mercy. One of the doctors, under pretence of carrying out an examination, swiftly opened an artery with a sharp knife, and in a minute or two the sufferer expired painlessly. There were many cases that day in which this was done. In fact, it was done in the majority of cases when the wound was in the body, for the gash made by the entry of the enormously broad spears used by the Kukuanas generally rendered recovery impossible. In most instances the poor sufferers were already unconscious, and in others the fatal ""nick"" of the artery was inflicted so swiftly and painlessly that they did not seem to notice it. Still it was a ghastly sight, and one from which we were glad to escape; indeed, I never remember anything of the kind that affected me more than seeing those gallant soldiers thus put out of pain by the red-handed medicine men, except, indeed, on one occasion when, after an attack, I saw a force of Swazis burying their hopelessly wounded _alive_.",centre group borne kind hide tray force carry quantity loop handle corner tray number seem endless lay wound man arrive examine medicine man attach regiment wound fatal character sufferer take attend circumstance allow other hand injured man condition prove hopeless follow dreadful truest mercy doctor pretence carry examination open artery sharp knife minute sufferer expire be many case day do fact do majority case wound body gash make entry broad spear use render recovery impossible most instance poor sufferer unconscious other fatal nick artery inflict seem notice ghastly sight glad escape remember kind affect more see gallant soldier put pain red handed medicine man occasion attack see force bury wound _alive_ 
29,"Hurrying from this dreadful scene to the further side of the koppie, we found Sir Henry, who still held a battle-axe in his hand, Ignosi, Infadoos, and one or two of the chiefs in deep consultation.",hurry dreadful scene further side koppie find hold battle axe hand chief deep consultation 
30,"""Thank Heaven, here you are, Quatermain! I can't quite make out what Ignosi wants to do. It seems that though we have beaten off the attack, Twala is now receiving large reinforcements, and is showing a disposition to invest us, with the view of starving us out.""",thank make want do seem beat attack receive large reinforcement show disposition invest view starve

33,"""My lord, that is so,"" said Infadoos; ""the spring cannot supply the wants of so great a multitude, and it is failing rapidly. Before night we shall all be thirsty. Listen, Macumazahn. Thou art wise, and hast doubtless seen many wars in the lands from whence thou camest--that is if indeed they make wars in the Stars. Now tell us, what shall we do? Twala has brought up many fresh men to take the place of those who have fallen. Yet Twala has learnt his lesson; the hawk did not think to find the heron ready; but our beak has pierced his breast; he fears to strike at us again. We too are wounded, and he will wait for us to die; he will wind himself round us like a snake round a buck, and fight the fight of 'sit down.'""",lord say spring supply want great multitude fail night thirsty listen wise see many war land camest make war tell do bring many fresh man take place fall learn lesson hawk think find heron ready beak pierce breast fear strike wound wait die wind snake buck fight fight sit

35,"""So, Macumazahn, thou seest we have no water here, and but a little food, and we must choose between these three things--to languish like a starving lion in his den, or to strive to break away towards the north, or""--and here he rose and pointed towards the dense mass of our foes--""to launch ourselves straight at Twala's throat. Incubu, the great warrior--for to-day he fought like a buffalo in a net, and Twala's soldiers went down before his axe like young corn before the hail; with these eyes I saw it--Incubu says 'Charge'; but the Elephant is ever prone to charge. Now what says Macumazahn, the wily old fox, who has seen much, and loves to bite his enemy from behind? The last word is in Ignosi the king, for it is a king's right to speak of war; but let us hear thy voice, O Macumazahn, who watchest by night, and the voice too of him of the transparent eye.""",seest have water little food choose thing languish starve lion dan strive break north rise point dense mass foe launch throat great warrior day fight buffalo net soldier go axe young corn hail eye see say charge elephant prone charge say wily old fox see much love bite enemy last word king king right speak war let hear voice watchest night voice transparent eye

38,"Thus adjured, after taking hasty counsel with Good and Sir Henry, I delivered my opinion briefly to the effect that, being trapped, our best chance, especially in view of the failure of our water supply, was to initiate an attack upon Twala's forces. Then I recommended that the attack should be delivered at once, ""before our wounds grew stiff,"" and also before the sight of Twala's overpowering force caused the hearts of our soldiers ""to wax small like fat before a fire."" Otherwise, I pointed out, some of the captains might change their minds, and, making peace with Twala, desert to him, or even betray us into his hands.",adjure take hasty counsel deliver opinion effect trap good chance view failure water supply initiate attack force recommend attack deliver wound grow stiff sight overpowering force cause heart soldier wax small fat fire point captain change mind make peace desert betray hand 
39,"This expression of opinion seemed, on the whole, to be favourably received; indeed, among the Kukuanas my utterances met with a respect which has never been accorded to them before or since. But the real decision as to our plans lay with Ignosi, who, since he had been recognised as rightful king, could exercise the almost unbounded rights of sovereignty, including, of course, the final decision on matters of generalship, and it was to him that all eyes were now turned.",expression opinion seem whole receive utterance meet respect accord real decision plan lay recognise rightful king exercise unbounded right sovereignty include course final decision matter generalship eye turn

I will strike at Twala this day, and set my fortunes on the blow, ay, and my life--my life and your lives also. Listen; thus will I strike.

But the spot is narrow, and the regiments can come against thee one at a time only; so may they be destroyed one by one, and the eyes of all Twala's army shall be fixed upon a struggle the like of which has not been seen by living man. And with thee, my uncle, shall go Incubu my friend, that when Twala sees his battle-axe flashing in the first rank of the Greys his heart may grow faint. And I will come with the second regiment, that which follows thee, so that if ye are destroyed, as it might happen, there may yet be a king left to fight for; and with me shall come Macumazahn the wise.""",good mid-day man eat rest toil battle sun turn travel little way darkness let regiment uncle advance other green tongue see hurl force crush spot narrow regiment come one time destroy one eye army fix struggle like see live man uncle go friend see battle axe flash first rank heart grow faint come second regiment follow destroy happen be king leave fight come wise 
44,"""It is well, O king,"" said Infadoos, apparently contemplating the certainty of the complete annihilation of his regiment with perfect calmness. Truly, these Kukuanas are a wonderful people. Death has no terrors for them when it is incurred in the course of duty.",well king say contemplate certainty complete annihilation regiment perfect calmness wonderful person death have terror incur course duty 
45,"""And whilst the eyes of the multitude of Twala's soldiers are thus fixed upon the fight,"" went on Ignosi, ""behold, one-third of the men who are left alive to us (i.e. about 6,000) shall creep along the right horn of the hill and fall upon the left flank of Twala's force, and one-third shall creep along the left horn and fall upon Twala's right flank. And when I see that the horns are ready to toss Twala, then will I, with the men who remain to me, charge home in Twala's face, and if fortune goes with us the day will be ours, and before Night drives her black oxen from the mountains to the mountains we shall sit in peace at Loo. And now let us eat and make ready; and, Infadoos, do thou prepare, that the plan be carried out without fail; and stay, let my white father Bougwan go with the right horn, that his shining eye may give courage to the captains.""",eye multitude soldier fix fight go third man leave alive creep right horn hill fall left flank force third creep left horn fall right flank see horn ready toss man remain charge home face fortune go day night drive black oxen mountain mountain sit peace let eat make ready prepare plan carry fail stay let white father go right horn shine eye give courage captain 
46,"The arrangements for attack thus briefly indicated were set in motion with a rapidity that spoke well for the perfection of the Kukuana military system. Within little more than an hour rations had been served out and devoured, the divisions were formed, the scheme of onslaught was explained to the leaders, and the whole force, numbering about 18,000 men, was ready to move, with the exception of a guard left in charge of the wounded.",arrangement attack indicate set motion rapidity speak perfection military system little more hour ration serve devoure division form scheme onslaught explain leader whole force number man ready move exception guard leave charge wound

So far as I can make out, the Greys, with whom I am to go, are to fight until they are wiped out in order to enable the wings to slip round unawares and outflank Twala. Well, so be it; at any rate, it will be a man's death. Good-bye, old fellow. God bless you!
