12,‘It is healthy?’,healthy 
13,"‘All a babe ought to be, they say, all that could be expected of it, except the not being of the right sort, and if Amy does not mind that, I don’t know who should,’ and Charles deposited himself on the sofa, heaving a deep sigh, intended to pass for the conclusion of the exertion.",babe say expect right sort mind know deposit sofa heave deep sigh intend pass conclusion exertion 
14,‘Then you think she is not disappointed?’,think disappointed 
15,"‘Certainly not. The first thing she said when she was told it was a girl, was, “I am so glad!” and she does seem very happy with it, poor little thing! In fact, mamma thinks she had so little expected that it would go well with herself, or with it, that now it is all like a surprise.’",first thing say tell girl glad seem happy poor little thing fact mamma think little expect go surprise 
16,"There was a silence, first broken by Charles saying, ‘You must be content with me--I can’t send for anyone. Bustle has taken papa and Charlotte for a walk, and Laura is on guard over Amy, for we have made mamma go and lie down. It was high time, after sitting up two nights, and meaning to sit up a third.’",be silence break say content send bustle take papa walk guard make mamma go lie high time sit night mean sit third

18,"‘Yes; I am afraid I have trained her in sitting up, and Amy and all of us know that anxiety hurts her more than fatigue. She would only lie awake worrying herself, instead of sitting peaceably by the fire, holding the baby, or watching Amy, and having a quiet cry when she is asleep. For, after all, it is very sad!’ Charles was trying to brave his feelings, but did not succeed very well. ‘Yesterday morning I was properly frightened. I came into the dressing-room, and found mamma crying so, that I fully believed it was all wrong, but she was just coming to tell us, and was only overcome by thinking of not having him to call first, and how happy he would have been.’",afraid train sit know anxiety hurt more fatigue lie worry sit fire hold baby watch have quiet cry asleep sad try brave feeling succeed yesterday morning frighten come dress room find mamma cry believe wrong come tell overcome think have call happy

I see she has his picture in full view, but she says not a word, except that mamma saw her to-day, when she thought no one was looking, fondling the little thing, and whispering to it--“Guy’s baby!”  and “Guy’s little messenger!”’ Charles gave up the struggle, and fairly cried, but in a moment rallying his usual tone, he went on, half laughing,--‘To be sure, what a morsel of a creature it is!

I have no doubt that he was thoroughly cut up, and I could even go the length of believing that distress of mind helped to bring on the relapse, but it is some time ago. And as to his breaking his heart after the first ten minutes at finding himself what he has all his life desired to be, in a situation where the full influence of his talents may be felt,’ said Charles, with a shade of imitation of his measured tones, ‘why that, no one but silly little Amy would ever dream of.’",have fear console think good do have doubt cut go length believe distress mind help bring relapse time break heart first minute find have life desire situation full influence talent feel say shade imitation measure tone silly little dream

Poor man! what a state he must be in; all the more pitiable because he evidently had entirely forgotten that there could ever be a creature of the less worthy gender born to the house of Morville; so it will take him quite by surprise. What will he do, and how will he ever forgive Mrs. Ashford, who, I see in the paper, has a son whom nobody wants, as if for the express purpose of insulting Markham’s feelings! Well-a-day! I should have liked to have had the sound of Sir Guy Morville still in my ears, and yet I don’t know that I could have endured its being applied to a little senseless baby! And, after all, we are the gainers; for it would have been a forlorn thing to have seen Amy go off to reign queen-mother at Redclyffe,--and most notably well would she have reigned, with that clear little head. I vow ‘tis a talent thrown away! However, I can’t grumble. She is much happier without greatness thrust on her, and for my own part, I have my home-sister all to myself, with no rival but that small woman--and how she will pet her!’",way let indignation ooze finger end begin write condole poor man state pitiable forget be creature worthy gender bear house take surprise do forgive see paper have son want express purpose insult feeling day like have sound ear know endure apply little senseless baby gainer forlorn thing see go reign queen mother reign clear little head vow talent throw grumble happy greatness thrust own part have home sister rival small woman pet

35,"Charles had not talked so like himself for months; and Mary felt that Amabel’s child, if she had disappointed some expectations, had come like a spring blossom, to cheer Hollywell, after its long winter of sorrow and anxiety. She seemed to have already been received as a messenger to comfort them for the loss, greatest of all to her, poor child, though she would never know how great. Next Mary wondered what kind of letter Charles would indite, and guessed it would be all the kinder for the outpouring he had made to her, the only person with whom he ventured to indulge in a comfortable abuse of Philip, since his good sense taught him that, ending as affairs must, it was the only wise way to make the best of it, with father, mother, and Charlotte, all quite sufficiently disposed to regard Philip with aversion without his help.",talk month feel child disappoint expectation come spring blossom cheer long winter sorrow anxiety seem receive messenger comfort loss great poor child know great wonder kind letter indite guess kinder outpouring make only person venture indulge comfortable abuse good sense teach end affair only wise way make good father mother dispose regard aversion help 
36,"Philip was at breakfast with the Henleys, on the following morning, a Sunday,--or rather, sitting at the breakfast-table, when the letters were brought in. Mrs. Henley, pretending to be occupied with her own, had an eager, watchful eye on her brother, as one was placed before him. She knew Mr. Edmonstone’s writing, but was restrained from exclaiming by her involuntary deference for her brother. He flushed deep red one moment, then turned deadly pale, his hand, when first he raised it, trembled, but then became firm, as if controlled by the force of his resolution. He broke the black seal, drew out the letter, paused another instant, unfolded it, glanced at it, pushed his chair from the table, and hastened to me door.",breakfast follow morning sit breakfast table letter bring pretend occupy own have eager watchful eye brother place know writing restrain exclaim involuntary deference brother flush deep red moment turn deadly pale hand raise tremble become firm control force resolution break black seal draw letter pause instant unfold glance push chair table hasten door

One or two of her many tame gentlemen came home with her to luncheon, and she had the satisfaction of dilating on the grandeur of Redclyffe. Her brother was not in the drawing-room, but answered when she knocked at his door.",interrupt acquaintance look see oblige content tell one news many tame gentleman come luncheon have satisfaction dilate grandeur brother draw room answer knock door

He received the congratulations of the gentlemen without the shadow of a smile, and made them think him the haughtiest and most dignified landed proprietor in England.",go tell visitor illness brother suffer much excitement unwell derive much pleasure tiding appear air correspond account look gravest sternest receive congratulation gentleman shadow smile make think haughtiest dignified land proprietor 
59,"Mrs. Henley advised strongly against his going to church, but without effect, and losing him in the crowd coming out, saw him no more till just before dinner-time. He had steeled himself to endure all that she and the Doctor could inflict on him that evening, and he had a hope of persuading Amabel that it would be only doing justice to her child to let him restore her father’s inheritance, which had come to him through circumstances that could not have been foreseen. He was determined to do nothing like an act of possession of Redclyffe till he had implored her to accept the offer; and it was a great relief thus to keep it in doubt a little longer, and not absolutely feel himself profiting by Guy’s death and sitting in his seat. Not a word, however, must be said to let his sister guess at his resolution, and he must let her torture him in the meantime. He was vexed at having been startled into betraying his suffering, and was humiliated at the thought of the change from that iron imperturbability, compounded of strength, pride, and coldness in which he had once gloried.",advise go church effect lose crowd come see more dinner time steel endure inflict evening have hope persuade do justice child let restore father inheritance come circumstance forese determined do act possession implore accept offer great relief keep doubt little feel profit death sit seat word say let sister guess resolution let torture meantime vex startle betray suffering humiliate thought change iron imperturbability compound strength pride coldness glory

65,"He patiently endured the conversation on the extent and beauty of Redclyffe, wearing all the time a stern, resolute aspect, that his sister knew to betoken great unhappiness. She earnestly wished to understand him, but at last, seeing how much her conversation increased his headache, she desisted, and left him to all the repose his thoughts could give him. He was very much concerned at the tone of the note from his uncle, as if it was intended to show that all connection with the family was to be broken off. He supposed it had been concerted with some one; with Charles, most likely,--Charles, who had judged him too truly, and with his attachment to Guy, and aversion to himself, was doubtless strengthening his father’s displeasure, all the more for this hateful wealth. And Laura?

66,"Monday morning brought another letter. At first, he was struck with the dread of evil tidings of Amabel or her babe, especially when he recognized Charles’s straggling handwriting; and, resolved not to be again betrayed, he carried it up to read in his own room before his sister had noticed it. He could hardly resolve to open it, for surely Charles would not write to him without necessity; and what, save sorrow, could cause that necessity? He saw that his wretchedness might be even more complete! At length he read it, and could hardly believe his own eyes as he saw cheering words, in a friendly style of interest and kindliness such as he would never have expected from Charles, more especially now.",morning bring letter strike dread evil tiding babe recognize straggle handwriting resolve betray carry read own room sister notice resolve open write necessity save sorrow cause necessity see wretchedness complete length read believe own eye see cheer word friendly style interest kindliness such expect

She begs me to tell you of her welfare, and to assure you that she is particularly pleased to have a daughter; or, perhaps, it will be more satisfactory to have her own words. “You must tell him how well I am, Charlie, and how very glad. And tell him that he must not vex himself about her being a girl, for that is my great pleasure; and I do believe, the very thing I should have chosen if I had set to work to wish.” You know Amy never said a word but in all sincerity, so you must trust her, and I add my testimony that she is in placid spirits, and may well be glad to escape the cares of Redclyffe.

73,"It gave him spirit enough to undertake what he had long been meditating, but without energy to set about it--an expedition to Stylehurst. Hitherto it had been his first walk on coming to St. Mildred’s, but now the distance across the moor was far beyond his powers; and even that length of ride was a great enterprise. It was much further by the carriage road, and his sister never liked going there. He had never failed to visit his old home till last year, and he felt almost glad that he had not carried his thoughts, at that time, to his father’s grave. It was strange that, with so many more important burdens on his mind, it had been this apparent trivial omission, this slight to Stylehurst, that, in both his illnesses, had been the most frequently recurring idea that had tormented him in his delirium. So deeply, securely fixed is the love of the home of childhood in men of his mould, in whom it is perhaps the most deeply rooted of all affections.",give spirit undertake meditate energy set expedition first walk come distance moor power length ride great enterprise carriage road sister like go fail visit old home last year feel glad carry thought time father grave strange many more important burden mind apparent trivial omission slight illness recur idea torment delirium fix love home childhood man mould rooted affection 
74,"Without telling his sister his intention, he hired a horse, and pursued the familiar moorland tracks. He passed South Moor Farm; it gave him too great a pang to look at it; he rode on across the hills where he used to walk with his sisters, and looked down into narrow valleys where he had often wandered with his fishing-rod, lost in musings on plans for attaining distinction, and seeing himself the greatest man of his day. Little had he then guessed the misery which would place him in the way to the coveted elevation, or how he would loathe it when it lay within his grasp.",tell sister intention hire horse pursue familiar moorland track pass give great pang look ride hill use walk sister look narrow valley wander fishing rod lose musing plan attain distinction see great man day guess misery place way covete elevation loathe lay grasp 
75,"There were the trees round the vicarage, the church spire, the cottages, whose old rough aspect, he knew so well, the whole scene, once ‘redolent of joy and youth:’ but how unable to breathe on him a second spring! He put up his horse at the village inn, and went to make his first call on Susan, the old clerk’s wife, and one of the persons in all the world who loved him best. He knocked, opened the door, and saw her, startled from her tea-drinking, looking at him as a stranger.",be tree vicarage church spire cottage old rough aspect know whole scene redolent joy youth unable breathe second spring put horse village inn go make first call old clerk wife person world love good knock open door see startle tea drinking look stranger

77,"He sat down and talked with her, with feelings of comfort. Tidings of Sir Guy’s death had reached the old woman, and she was much grieved for the nice, cheerful-spoken young gentleman, whom she well remembered; for she, like almost every one who had ever had any intercourse with him, had an impression left of him, as of something winning, engaging, brightening, like a sunbeam. It was a refreshment to meet with one who would lament him for his own sake, and had no congratulations for Philip himself; and the ‘Sure, sure, it must have been very bad for you,’ with which old Susan heard of the circumstances, carried more of the comfort of genuine sympathy than all his sister’s attempts at condolence.",sit talk feeling comfort tiding death reach old woman grieve nice cheerful speak young gentleman remember one have intercourse have impression leave win engage brighten sunbeam refreshment meet lament own sake have congratulation sure bad old hear circumstance carry more comfort genuine sympathy sister attempt condolence 
78,"She told him how often Sir Guy had been at Stylehurst, how he had talked to her about the archdeacon; and especially she remembered his helping her husband one day when he found him trimming the ash over the archdeacon’s grave. He used to come very often to church there, more in the latter part of his stay; there was one Sunday--it was the one before Michaelmas--he was there all day, walking in the churchyard, and sitting in the porch between services.",tell talk archdeacon remember help husband day find trimm ash archdeacon grave use come church latter part stay be one day walk churchyard sit porch service

He had come with a whole freight of prizes, and letters full of praises; and as he stood, in expectation of the expression of delighted satisfaction, his father laid his hand on his trophy, the pile of books, saying, gravely,--’ All this would I give, Philip, for one evidence of humility of mind.’",paved path trodd early childhood hold mother hand recur vacation school day walk admire sister consciousness pride family parish family remember return last time summon father death come whole freight prize letter full praise stand expectation expression delight satisfaction father lay hand trophy pile book say give evidence humility mind

His real feelings had been told to her, because she flattered them and shared them, he had been reserved and guarded with the father who would have perceived and repressed that ambition and the self-sufficiency which he himself had never known to exist, nor regarded as aught but sober truth. It had been his bane, that he had been always too sensible to betray outwardly his self-conceit, in any form that could lead to its being noticed.",father reproof think unjust unreasonable turn caress admire real feeling tell flatter share reserve guard father perceive repress ambition self sufficiency know exist regard aught sober truth bane sensible betray self conceit form lead notice

He would not have sorrowed that robust frame was wasted, and great strength brought low; that the noble features were worn, the healthful cheek pale, and the powerful intellect clouded and weakened; he would hardly have mourned for the cruel grief and suffering, such would have been his joy that the humble, penitent, obedient heart had been won at last. Above all, he would have rejoiced that the words that most soothed that wounded spirit were,--‘A broken and contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.’",knolt bow head hand clasp father beheld rejoice sorrow robust frame waste great strength bring low noble feature wear healthful cheek pale powerful intellect cloude weaken mourn cruel grief suffering such joy humble penitent obedient heart win last rejoice word sooth wound spirit broken contrite heart despise 
86,"There was solace in that solemn silence; the throbs of head and heart were stilled in the calm around. It was as if the influences of the prayers breathed for him by his father, and the forgiveness and loving spirit there won by Guy, had been waiting for him there till he came to take them up, for thenceforth the bitterest of his despair was over, and he could receive each token of Amabel’s forgiveness, not as heaped coals of fire, but as an earnest of forgiveness sealed in heaven.",be solace solemn silence throb head heart still calm influence prayer breathe father forgiveness loving spirit win wait come take thenceforth bitterest despair receive token forgiveness heap coal fire earnest forgiveness seal heaven

I was then too ill to be able to express my contrition for all that has passed; in fact, I doubt whether it was even then so deep as at present, since every succeeding week has but added to my sense of the impropriety of my conduct, and my earnest desire for pardon. I can hardly venture at such a time to ask anything further, but I must add that my sentiments towards your daughter are unaltered, and can never cease but with my life, and though I know I have rendered myself unworthy of her, and my health, both mental and bodily, is far from being re-established, I cannot help laying my feelings before you, and entreating that you will put an end to the suspense which has endured for so many months, by telling me to hope that I have not for ever forfeited your consent to my attachment. At least, I trust to your kindness for telling me on what terms I am for the present to stand with your family. I am glad to hear such favourable reports of Lady Morville, and with all my heart I thank Charles for his letter.",dear full sense unfitness intrude subject present state family address same topic write first moment feel possible ask attention ill able express contrition pass fact doubt deep present succeed week add sense impropriety conduct earnest desire pardon venture time ask add sentiment daughter unaltered cease life know render unworthy health mental bodily re-establish help lay feeling entreat put end suspense endure many month tell hope forfeit consent attachment least trust kindness tell term present stand family glad hear such favourable report heart thank letter

94," He ardently watched for a reply. He could not endure the idea of receiving it where Margaret’s eyes could scan the emotion he could now only conceal by a visible rigidity of demeanour, and he daily went himself to the post-office, but in vain. He received nothing but business letters, and among them one from Markham, with as much defiance and dislike in its style as could be shown, in a perfectly formal, proper letter. Till he had referred to Lady Morville, he would not make any demonstration towards Redclyffe, and evaded all his sister’s questions as to what he was doing about it, and when he should take measures for leaving the army, or obtaining a renewal of the baronetcy.",watch reply endure idea receive eye scan emotion conceal visible rigidity demeanour go post office vain receive business letter much defiance dislike style show formal proper letter refer make demonstration evade sister question do take measure leave army obtain renewal baronetcy

I hope to take our dear little girl to be christened on that day, and I want you to be so kind as to be her godfather. I ask it of you, not only in my own name, but in her father’s, for I am sure it is what he would choose. Her Aunt Laura and Mary Ross are to be her godmothers, I hope you will not think me very foolish and fanciful for naming her Mary Verena, in remembrance of our old readings of Sintram. She is a very healthy, quiet creature, and I am getting on very well. I am writing from the dressing-room, and I expect to be down-stairs in a few days. If you do not dislike it very much, could you be so kind as to call upon Miss Wellwood, and pay little Marianne Dixon’s quarter for me? It is £1O, and it will save trouble if you would do it; besides that, I should like to hear of her and the little girl. I am sorry to hear you are not better,--perhaps coming here may do you good.--Four o’clock.
