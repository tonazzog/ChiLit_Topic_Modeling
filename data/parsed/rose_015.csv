1,CHAPTER XIV. WHAT BECAME OF GIGLIO,became 
2,"The idea of marrying such an old creature as Gruffanuff frightened Prince Giglio so, that he ran up to his room, packed his trunks, fetched in a couple of porters, and was off to the diligence office in a twinkling.",idea marry old creature frighten run room pack trunk fetched couple porter diligence office twinkling 
3,"It was well that he was so quick in his operations, did not dawdle over his luggage, and took the early coach, for as soon as the mistake about Prince Bulbo was found out, that cruel Glumboso sent up a couple of policemen to Prince Giglio’s room, with orders that he should be carried to Newgate, and his head taken off before twelve o’clock. But the coach was out of the Paflagonian dominions before two o’clock; and I dare say the express that was sent after Prince Giglio did not ride very quick, for many people in Paflagonia had a regard for Giglio, as the son of their old sovereign; a Prince who, with all his weaknesses, was very much better than his brother, the usurping, lazy, careless, passionate, tyrannical, reigning monarch. That Prince busied himself with the balls, fetes, masquerades, hunting-parties, and so forth, which he thought proper to give on occasion of his daughter’s marriage to Prince Bulbo; and let us trust was not sorry in his own heart that his brother’s son had escaped the scaffold.",quick operation dawdle luggage take early coach mistake find cruel send couple policemen room order carry head take o'clock coach dominion o'clock say express send ride many person have regard son old sovereign weakness good brother usurp lazy careless passionate tyrannical reign monarch busy ball fete masquerade hunting party think proper give occasion daughter marriage let trust sorry own heart brother son escape scaffold 
4,"It was very cold weather, and the snow was on the ground, and Giglio, who gave his name as simple Mr. Giles, was very glad to get a comfortable place in the coupe of the diligence, where he sat with the conductor and another gentleman. At the first stage from Blombodinga, as they stopped to change horses, there came up to the diligence a very ordinary, vulgar-looking woman, with a bag under her arm, who asked for a place. All the inside places were taken, and the young woman was informed that if she wished to travel, she must go upon the roof; and the passenger inside with Giglio (a rude person, I should think), put his head out of the window, and said, ‘Nice weather for travelling outside! I wish you a pleasant journey, my dear.’ The poor woman coughed very much, and Giglio pitied her. ‘I will give up my place to her,’ says he, ‘rather than she should travel in the cold air with that horrid cough.’ On which the vulgar traveller said, ‘YOU’D keep her warm, I am sure, if it’s a MUFF she wants.’ On which Giglio pulled his nose, boxed his ears, hit him in the eye, and gave this vulgar person a warning never to call him MUFF again.",cold weather snow ground give name simple glad get comfortable place coupe diligence sit conductor gentleman first stage stop change horse come diligence ordinary vulgar look woman bag arm ask place inside place take young woman inform wish travel go roof passenger rude person think put head window say nice weather travel wish pleasant journey dear poor woman cough pity give place say travel cold air horrid cough vulgar traveller say keep warm sure muff want pull nose box ear hit eye give vulgar person warning call 
5,"Then he sprang up gaily on to the roof of the diligence, and made himself very comfortable in the straw.",spring roof diligence make comfortable straw 
6,"The vulgar traveller got down only at the next station, and Giglio took his place again, and talked to the person next to him. She appeared to be a most agreeable, well-informed, and entertaining female. They travelled together till night, and she gave Giglio all sorts of things out of the bag which she carried, and which indeed seemed to contain the most wonderful collection of articles. He was thirsty--out there came a pint bottle of Bass’s pale ale, and a silver mug! Hungry--she took out a cold fowl, some slices of ham, bread, salt, and a most delicious piece of cold plum-pudding, and a little glass of brandy afterwards.",vulgar traveller get next station take place talk person appear agreeable inform entertaining female travel night give sort thing bag carry seem contain wonderful collection article thirsty come pint bottle pale ale silver mug hungry take cold fowl slice ham bread salt delicious piece cold plum pudding little glass brandy 
7,"As they travelled, this plain-looking, queer woman talked to Giglio on a variety of subjects, in which the poor Prince showed his ignorance as much as she did her capacity. He owned, with many blushes, how ignorant he was; on which the lady said, ‘My dear Gigl--my good Mr. Giles, you are a young man, and have plenty of time before you. You have nothing to do but to improve yourself. Who knows but that you may find use for your knowledge some day? When--when you may be wanted at home, as some people may be.’",travel plain look queer woman talk variety subject poor show ignorance much do capacity own many blush ignorant lady say dear good young man have plenty time have do improve know find use knowledge day want home person

9,"‘I know a number of funny things,’ says the lady. ‘I have been at some people’s christenings, and turned away from other folks’ doors. I have seen some people spoilt by good fortune, and others, as I hope, improved by hardship. I advise you to stay at the town where the coach stops for the night.

13,"‘To the Fairy Blackstick,’ says the lady, flying out of the window. And then Giglio asked the conductor if he knew where the lady was?",say lady fly window ask conductor know lady 
14,"‘What lady?’ says the man; ‘there has been no lady in this coach, except the old woman, who got out at the last stage.’ And Giglio thought he had been dreaming. But there was the bag which Blackstick had given him lying on his lap; and when he came to the town he took it in his hand and went into the inn.",lady say man be lady coach old woman get last stage think dreaming be bag give lie lap come town take hand go inn 
15,"They gave him a very bad bedroom, and Giglio, when he woke in the morning, fancying himself in the Royal Palace at home, called, ‘John, Charles, Thomas! My chocolate--my dressing-gown--my slippers’; but nobody came. There was no bell, so he went and bawled out for water on the top of the stairs.",give bad bedroom wake morning fancy royal home call chocolate dress gown slipper come be bell go bawl water top stair

23,"The landlady of the Bear went away GROWLING. And Giglio returned to his room, where the first thing he saw was the fairy bag lying on the table, which seemed to give a little hop as he came in. ‘I hope it has some breakfast in it,’ says Giglio, ‘for I have only a very little money left.’ But on opening the bag, what do you think was there? A blacking-brush and a pot of Warren’s jet, and on the pot was written:",landlady go growling return room first thing see fairy bag lie table seem give little hop come hope have breakfast say have little money leave open bag think blacking brush pot jet pot write

43,"So he sat down and worked away, very, very hard for a whole year, during which ‘Mr. Giles’ was quite an example to all the students in the University of Bosforo.

But her death seemed to be certain. The mangled remains of a cloak, and a little shoe, were found in the forest, during a hunting-party, in which the intrepid sovereign of Crim Tartary slew two of the lions’ cubs with his own spear. And these interesting relics of an innocent little creature were carried home and kept by their finder, the Baron Spinachi, formerly an officer in Cavolfiore’s household. The Baron was disgraced in consequence of his known legitimist opinions, and has lived for some time in the humble capacity of a wood-cutter, in a forest on the outskirts of the Kingdom of Crim Tartary.",have kindest heart world grieve accident occur harmless little know benevolence provide fitting establishment death seem certain mangle remains cloak little shoe find forest hunting party intrepid sovereign slew lion cub own spear interesting relic innocent little creature carry keep finder officer household disgrace consequence know legitimist opinion live time humble capacity wood cutter forest outskirt

I should espouse his daughter, young Angelica; we two indeed should reign in Paflagonia. His words were false--false as Angelica’s heart!--false as Angelica’s hair, colour, front teeth!

It was all in blank verse (in which, from this time, he invariably spoke, as more becoming his majestic station). It lasted for three days and three nights, during which not a single person who heard him was tired, or remarked the difference between daylight and dark. The soldiers only cheering tremendously, when occasionally, once in nine hours, the Prince paused to suck an orange, which Jones took out of the bag. He explained, in terms which we say we shall not attempt to convey, the whole history of the previous transaction, and his determination not only not to give up his sword, but to assume his rightful crown; and at the end of this extraordinary, this truly GIGANTIC effort, Captain Hedzoff flung up his helmet, and cried, ‘Hurray!
