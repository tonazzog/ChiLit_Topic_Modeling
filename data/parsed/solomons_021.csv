3,"I was walking along quietly, some way in front of the other two, down the banks of the stream which runs from the oasis till it is swallowed up in the hungry desert sands, when suddenly I stopped and rubbed my eyes, as well I might. There, not twenty yards in front of me, placed in a charming situation, under the shade of a species of fig-tree, and facing to the stream, was a cosy hut, built more or less on the Kafir principle with grass and withes, but having a full-length door instead of a bee-hole.",walk way front other bank stream run oasis swallow hungry desert sand stop rub eye yard front place charming situation shade species fig tree face stream cosy hut build more less principle grass withe have full length door bee hole 
4,"""What the dickens,"" said I to myself, ""can a hut be doing here?"" Even as I said it the door of the hut opened, and there limped out of it a _white man_ clothed in skins, and with an enormous black beard. I thought that I must have got a touch of the sun. It was impossible. No hunter ever came to such a place as this. Certainly no hunter would ever settle in it. I stared and stared, and so did the other man, and just at that juncture Sir Henry and Good walked up.",dicken say hut do say door hut open limp _white man_ cloth skin enormous black beard think get touch sun impossible hunter come place hunter settle stare stare do other man juncture walk 
5,"""Look here, you fellows,"" I said, ""is that a white man, or am I mad?""",look fellow say white man mad 
6,"Sir Henry looked, and Good looked, and then all of a sudden the lame white man with a black beard uttered a great cry, and began hobbling towards us. When he was close he fell down in a sort of faint.",look look lame white man black beard utter great cry begin hobble close fall sort faint 
7,With a spring Sir Henry was by his side.,spring side

9,"At the sound of this disturbance, another figure, also clad in skins, emerged from the hut, a gun in his hand, and ran towards us. On seeing me he too gave a cry.",sound disturbance figure clad skin emerge hut gun hand run see give cry 
10,"""Macumazahn,"" he halloed, ""don't you know me, Baas? I'm Jim the hunter. I lost the note you gave me to give to the Baas, and we have been here nearly two years."" And the fellow fell at my feet, and rolled over and over, weeping for joy.",halloe know hunter lose note give give year fellow fall foot roll weep joy 
11,"""You careless scoundrel!"" I said; ""you ought to be well _sjambocked_""--that is, hided.",careless scoundrel say _sjambocked_ hide 
12,"Meanwhile the man with the black beard had recovered and risen, and he and Sir Henry were pump-handling away at each other, apparently without a word to say. But whatever they had quarrelled about in the past--I suspect it was a lady, though I never asked--it was evidently forgotten now.",man black beard recover rise pump handle other word say quarrell past suspect lady ask forget 
13,"""My dear old fellow,"" burst out Sir Henry at last, ""I thought you were dead. I have been over Solomon's Mountains to find you. I had given up all hope of ever seeing you again, and now I come across you perched in the desert, like an old _assvögel_.""[1]",dear old fellow burst last think dead find give hope see come perch desert old _assvögel_ 
14,"""I tried to cross Solomon's Mountains nearly two years ago,"" was the answer, spoken in the hesitating voice of a man who has had little recent opportunity of using his tongue, ""but when I reached here a boulder fell on my leg and crushed it, and I have been able to go neither forward nor back.""",try cross year answer speak hesitate voice man have little recent opportunity use tongue reach boulder fall leg crush able go 
15,"Then I came up. ""How do you do, Mr. Neville?"" I said; ""do you remember me?""",come do say remember 
16,"""Why,"" he said, ""isn't it Hunter Quatermain, eh, and Good too? Hold on a minute, you fellows, I am getting dizzy again. It is all so very strange, and, when a man has ceased to hope, so very happy!""",say hold minute fellow get dizzy strange man cease hope happy 
17,"That evening, over the camp fire, George Curtis told us his story, which, in its way, was almost as eventful as our own, and, put shortly, amounted to this. A little less than two years before, he had started from Sitanda's Kraal, to try to reach Suliman's Berg. As for the note I had sent him by Jim, that worthy lost it, and he had never heard of it till to-day. But, acting upon information he had received from the natives, he headed not for Sheba's Breasts, but for the ladder-like descent of the mountains down which we had just come, which is clearly a better route than that marked out in old Dom Silvestra's plan. In the desert he and Jim had suffered great hardships, but finally they reached this oasis, where a terrible accident befell George Curtis. On the day of their arrival he was sitting by the stream, and Jim was extracting the honey from the nest of a stingless bee which is to be found in the desert, on the top of a bank immediately above him. In so doing he loosened a great boulder of rock, which fell upon George Curtis's right leg, crushing it frightfully. From that day he had been so lame that he found it impossible to go either forward or back, and had preferred to take the chances of dying in the oasis to the certainty of perishing in the desert.",evening camp fire tell story way eventful own put amount little less year start try reach note send worthy lose hear day act information receive native head breast ladder descent mountain come good route mark old plan desert suffer great hardship reach oasis terrible accident befell day arrival sit stream extract honey nest stingless bee find desert top bank do loosen great boulder rock fall right leg crush day lame find impossible go prefer take chance die oasis certainty perish desert 
18,"As for food, however, they got on pretty well, for they had a good supply of ammunition, and the oasis was frequented, especially at night, by large quantities of game, which came thither for water. These they shot, or trapped in pitfalls, using the flesh for food, and, after their clothes wore out, the hides for clothing.",food get have good supply ammunition oasis frequent night large quantity game come water shoot trap pitfall use flesh food clothes wear hide clothing 
19,"""And so,"" George Curtis ended, ""we have lived for nearly two years, like a second Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday, hoping against hope that some natives might come here to help us away, but none have come. Only last night we settled that Jim should leave me, and try to reach Sitanda's Kraal to get assistance. He was to go to-morrow, but I had little hope of ever seeing him back again. And now _you_, of all people in the world, _you_, who, as I fancied, had long ago forgotten all about me, and were living comfortably in old England, turn up in a promiscuous way and find me where you least expected. It is the most wonderful thing that I have ever heard of, and the most merciful too.""",end live year second man hope hope native come help come last night settle leave try reach get assistance go have little hope see person world fancy forget live old turn promiscuous way find least expect wonderful thing hear merciful 
20,"Then Sir Henry set to work, and told him the main facts of our adventures, sitting till late into the night to do it.",set work tell main fact adventure sit night do 
21,"""By Jove!"" said George Curtis, when I showed him some of the diamonds: ""well, at least you have got something for your pains, besides my worthless self.""",say show diamond least get pain worthless self 
22,"Sir Henry laughed. ""They belong to Quatermain and Good. It was a part of the bargain that they should divide any spoils there might be.""",laugh belong part bargain divide spoil 
23,"This remark set me thinking, and having spoken to Good, I told Sir Henry that it was our joint wish that he should take a third portion of the diamonds, or, if he would not, that his share should be handed to his brother, who had suffered even more than ourselves on the chance of getting them. Finally, we prevailed upon him to consent to this arrangement, but George Curtis did not know of it until some time afterwards.",remark set think speak tell joint wish take third portion diamond share hand brother suffer more chance get prevail consent arrangement know time

25,"Here, at this point, I think that I shall end my history. Our journey across the desert back to Sitanda's Kraal was most arduous, especially as we had to support George Curtis, whose right leg was very weak indeed, and continually threw out splinters of bone. But we did accomplish it somehow, and to give its details would only be to reproduce much of what happened to us on the former occasion.",point think end history journey desert arduous have support right leg weak throw splinter bone accomplish give detail reproduce much happen former occasion 
26,"Six months from the date of our re-arrival at Sitanda's, where we found our guns and other goods quite safe, though the old rascal in charge was much disgusted at our surviving to claim them, saw us all once more safe and sound at my little place on the Berea, near Durban, where I am now writing. Thence I bid farewell to all who have accompanied me through the strangest trip I ever made in the course of a long and varied experience.",month date re-arrival find gun other goods safe old rascal charge disgusted survive claim see safe sound little place write thence bid farewell accompany strangest trip make course long varied experience 
27,"P.S.--Just as I had written the last word, a Kafir came up my avenue of orange trees, carrying a letter in a cleft stick, which he had brought from the post. It turned out to be from Sir Henry, and as it speaks for itself I give it in full.",write last word come avenue orange tree carry letter cleft stick bring post turn speak give full

30,"  I send you a line a few mails back to say that the three of us,   George, Good, and myself, fetched up all right in England. We got   off the boat at Southampton, and went up to town. You should have   seen what a swell Good turned out the very next day, beautifully   shaved, frock coat fitting like a glove, brand new eye-glass,   etc., etc. I went and walked in the park with him, where I met   some people I know, and at once told them the story of his   ""beautiful white legs.""",send line few mail say fetched get boat go town see swell turn very next day shave frock coat fit glove brand new eye glass etc. etc. go walk park meet person know tell story beautiful white leg

32,"  To come to business, Good and I took the diamonds to Streeter's to   be valued, as we arranged, and really I am afraid to tell you what   they put them at, it seems so enormous. They say that of course it   is more or less guess-work, as such stones have never to their   knowledge been put on the market in anything like such quantities.   It appears that (with the exception of one or two of the largest)   they are of the finest water, and equal in every way to the best   Brazilian stones. I asked them if they would buy them, but they   said that it was beyond their power to do so, and recommended us   to sell by degrees, over a period of years indeed, for fear lest   we should flood the market. They offer, however, a hundred and   eighty thousand for a very small portion of them.",come business take diamond value arrange afraid tell put seem enormous say course more guess work such stone knowledge put market such quantity appear exception large fine water equal way good brazilian stone ask buy say power do recommend sell degree period year fear flood market offer small portion 
33,"  You must come home, Quatermain, and see about these things,   especially if you insist upon making the magnificent present of   the third share, which does _not_ belong to me, to my brother   George. As for Good, he is _no good_. His time is too much   occupied in shaving, and other matters connected with the vain   adorning of the body. But I think he is still down on his luck   about Foulata. He told me that since he had been home he hadn't   seen a woman to touch her, either as regards her figure or the   sweetness of her expression.",come see thing insist make magnificent present third share belong brother good_ time occupy shaving other matter connect vain adorning body think luck tell home see woman touch regards figure sweetness expression 
34,"  I want you to come home, my dear old comrade, and to buy a house   near here. You have done your day's work, and have lots of money   now, and there is a place for sale quite close which would suit   you admirably. Do come; the sooner the better; you can finish   writing the story of our adventures on board ship. We have refused   to tell the tale till it is written by you, for fear lest we shall   not be believed. If you start on receipt of this you will reach   here by Christmas, and I book you to stay with me for that. Good   is coming, and George; and so, by the way, is your boy Harry   (there's a bribe for you). I have had him down for a week's   shooting, and like him. He is a cool young hand; he shot me in the   leg, cut out the pellets, and then remarked upon the advantages of   having a medical student with every shooting party!",want come dear old comrade buy house do day work have lot money be place sale close suit come good finish write story adventure board ship refuse tell tale write fear believe start receipt reach book stay good come way boy be bribe have week shooting cool young hand shoot leg cut pellet remark advantage have medical student shooting party

I wish that we   could have managed to bring away the coats of chain armour.

There is a steamer going on Friday, and I really think that I must take Curtis at his word, and sail by her for England, if it is only to see you, Harry, my boy, and to look after the printing of this history, which is a task that I do not like to trust to anybody else.",day be steamer go think take word sail see boy look printing history task like trust else
