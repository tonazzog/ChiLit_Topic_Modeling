4,"He was not sleeping as any respectable bird would have done, with his head tucked under his wing; but was lying stretched out on a rug in the hall, with his head resting on a cushion.

7,"“Bless my shell and fins!” he muttered; “what’s the creature wandering about this time of the morning for; they’ll be getting up in the middle of the night next.

18,"“Oh, that’s another thing entirely,” said the Turtle, handing me some matches from his waistcoat pocket, and accepting a cigarette in return. “But really we have got so sick of those advertisement catchwords since the Doctor-in-Law returned from London with agencies for all sorts of things, that we hate the very sound of them. We are continually being told to ‘Call a spade a spade,’ which will be ‘grateful and comforting’ to ‘an ox in a teacup’ who is ‘worth a guinea a box,’ and who ‘won’t be happy till he gets it.’”",thing say hand match waistcoat pocket accept cigarette return get sick advertisement catchword return agency sort thing hate very sound tell call spade spade grateful comforting ox teacup worth guinea box happy get

29,“What’s the matter?” I ventured to ask of the little man.,matter venture ask little man 
30,"“Matter?” was the reply. “Why, these wretched rosebushes, they _will_ get out their beds at night, and wander about.

Why, you can’t have been in a garden at night-time, or you wouldn’t talk such nonsense. All the plants are allowed to leave their beds at midnight. They are expected to be back again by daylight, though, and not go wandering about goodness knows where like this beauty,” and he shook the rosebush violently.",hear absurd declare course have hedge fence garden garden night time talk such nonsense plant allow leave bed midnight expect daylight go wonder goodness know beauty shake rosebush
