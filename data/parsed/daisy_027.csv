9,"There were transports till it was recollected that on Thursday morning school would recommence, and that on Friday Harry must join his ship.",be transport recollect morning school recommence join ship 
10,"However, the Roman camp had long been an object of their desires, and Margaret was glad that the last day should have a brilliancy, so she would not hear of any one remaining to keep her company, talked of the profit she should gain by a leisure day, and took ardent interest in every one’s preparations and expectations, in Ethel’s researches into county histories and classical dictionaries, Flora’s sketching intentions, Norman’s promises of campanula glomerata, and a secret whispered into her ear by Mary and Harry.",roman camp object desire glad last day have brilliancy hear one remain keep company talk profit gain leisure day take ardent interest one preparation expectation researche county history classical dictionary sketch intention promise campanula glomerata secret whisper ear 
11,"“Meta’s weather,” as they said, when the August sun rose fresh and joyous; and great was the unnecessary bustle, and happy confusion from six o’clock till eleven, when Dr. May, who was going to visit patients some way farther on the same road, carried off Harry and Mary, to set them down at the place.",weather say sun rise fresh joyous great unnecessary bustle happy confusion o'clock go visit patient same road carry set place 
12,"The rest were called for by Mr. Rivers’s carriage and brake. Mrs. Charles Wilmot and her little girl were the only additions to the party, and Meta, putting Blanche into the carriage to keep company with her contemporary, went herself in the brake. What a brilliant little fairy she was, in her pink summer robes, fluttering like a butterfly, and with the same apparent felicity in basking in joy, all gaiety, glee, and light-heartedness in making others happy. On they went, through honeysuckled lanes, catching glimpses of sunny fields of corn falling before the reaper, and happy knots of harvest folks dining beneath the shelter of their sheaves, with the sturdy old green umbrella sheltering them from the sun.",rest call carriage brake little girl only addition party put carriage keep company contemporary go brake brilliant little fairy pink summer robe flutter butterfly same apparent felicity bask joy gaiety glee light heartedness make other happy go honeysuckled lane catching glimpse sunny field corn fall reaper happy knot harvest folk dine shelter sheave sturdy old green umbrella shelter sun 
13,"Snatches of song, peals of laughter, merry nonsense, passed from one to the other; Norman, roused into blitheness, found wit, the young ladies found laughter, and Richard’s eyes and mouth looked very pretty, as they smiled their quiet diversion.",snatche song peal laughter merry nonsense pass other rouse blitheness find wit young lady find laughter eye mouth look pretty smile quiet diversion 
14,"At last, his face drawn all into one silent laugh, he directed the eyes of the rest to a high green mound, rising immediately before them, where stood two little figures, one with a spy-glass, intently gazing the opposite way.",last face draw silent laugh direct eye rest high green mound rise stand little figure spy glass gaze opposite way 
15,"At the same time came the halt, and Norman, bounding out, sprang lightly and nimbly up the side of the mound, and, while the spy-glass was yet pointed full at Wales, had hold of a pair of stout legs, and with the words, “Keep a good lockout!” had tumbled Mr. May headforemost down the grassy slope, with Mary rolling after.",same time come halt bound spring side mound spy glass point full hold pair stout leg word keep good lockout tumble grassy slope roll 
16,"Harry’s first outcry was for his precious glass--his second was, not at his fall, but that they should have come from the east, when, by the compass, Stoneborough was north-north-west. And then the boys took to tumbling over one another, while Meta frolicked joyously, with Nipen after her, up and down the mounds, chased by Mary and Blanche, who were wild with glee.",first outcry precious glass second fall come east compass north north west boy take tumble frolick mound chase wild glee 
17,"By-and-by she joined Ethel, and Norman was summoned to help them to trace out the old lines of encampment, ditch, rampart, and gates--happy work on those slopes of fresh turf, embroidered with every minute blossom of the moor--thyme, birdsfoot, eyebright, and dwarf purple thistle, buzzed and hummed over by busy, black-tailed, yellow-banded dumbledores, the breezy wind blowing softly in their faces, and the expanse of country--wooded hill, verdant pasture, amber harvest-field, winding river, smoke-canopied town, and brown moor, melting grayly away to the mountain heads.",join summon help trace old line encampment ditch rampart gate happy work slope fresh turf embroider minute blossom moor thyme birdsfoot eyebright dwarf purple thistle buzz humm busy black tail yellow band dumbledore breezy wind blow face expanse country wood hill verdant pasture amber harvest field wind river smoke canopy town brown moor melt mountain head 
18,"Now in sun, now in shade, the bright young antiquaries surveyed the old banks, and talked wisely of vallum and fossa, of legion and cohort, of Agricola and Suetonius, and discussed the delightful probability, that this might have been raised in the war with Caractacus, whence, argued Ethel, since Caractacus was certainly Arviragus, it must have been the very spot where Imogen met Posthumus again. Was not yonder the very high-road to Milford Haven, and thus must not “fair Fidele’s grassy tomb” be in the immediate neighbourhood?",sun shade bright young antiquary survey old bank talk vallum fossa legion cohort discuss delightful probability raise war argue very spot meet high road fair grassy tomb immediate neighbourhood 
19,"Then followed the suggestion that the mound in the middle was a good deal like an ancient tomb, where, as Blanche interposed with some of the lore lately caught from Ethel’s studies, “they used to bury their tears in wheelbarrows,” while Norman observed it was the more probable, as fair Fidele never was buried at all.",follow suggestion mound middle good deal ancient tomb interpose lore catch study use bury tear wheelbarroww observe probable fair bury 
20,"The idea of a search enchanted the young ladies. “It was the right sort of vehicle, evidently,” said Norman, looking at Harry, who had been particularly earnest in recommending that it should be explored; and Meta declared that if they could but find the least trace, her papa would be delighted to go regularly to work, and reveal all the treasures.",idea search enchant young lady right sort vehicle say look earnest recommend explore declare find least trace papa delight go work reveal treasure 
21,"Richard seemed a little afraid of the responsibility of treasure-trove, but he was overruled by a chorus of eager voices, and dispossessed of the trowel, which he had brought to dig up some down-gentians for the garden. While Norman set to work as pioneer, some skipped about in wild ecstasy, and Ethel knelt down to peer into the hole.",seem little afraid responsibility treasure trove overrule chorus eager voice dispossess trowel bring dig gentian garden set work pioneer skip wild ecstasy knolt peer hole 
22,"Very soon there was a discovery--an eager outcry--some pottery! Roman vessels--a red thing that might have been a lamp, another that might have been a lachrymatory.",be discovery eager outcry pottery roman vessel red thing lamp lachrymatory

25,"“You see it is very small,” added Harry; “she could not squeeze out many.”",see small add squeeze many 
26,"“Come now, I do believe you are laughing at it!” said Meta, taking the derided vessels into her hands. “Now, they really are genuine, and very curious things, are not they, Flora?”",come believe laugh say take deride vessel hand genuine curious thing 
27,"Flora and Ethel admired and speculated till there was a fresh, and still more exciting discovery--a coin, actually a medal, with the head of an emperor upon it--not a doubt of his high nose being Roman. Meta was certain that she knew one exactly like him among her father’s gems. Ethel was resolved that he should be Claudius, and began decyphering the defaced inscription THVRVS. She tried Claudius’s whole torrent of names, and, at last, made it into a contraction of Tiberius, which highly satisfied her.",admire speculate be fresh exciting discovery coin medal head emperor doubt high nose roman certain know father gem resolve begin decypher deface inscription thvrvs try whole torrent name last make contraction satisfy 
28,"Then Meta, in her turn, read D.V.X., which, as Ethel said, was all she could wish--of course it was dux et imperator, and Harry muttered into Norman’s ear, “ducks and geese!” and then heaved a sigh, as he thought of the dux no longer. “V.V.,” continued Meta; “what can that mean?”",turn read say wish course mutter ear duck geese heave sigh think dux continue mean

32,"“Something about Aeneas,” suggested Norman gravely. But Ethel was sure that could not be, because there was no diphthong; and a fresh theory was just being started, when Blanche’s head was thrust in to know what made them all so busy.",suggest sure be diphthong fresh theory start head thrust know make busy 
33,"“Why, Ethel, what are you doing with Harry’s old medal of the Duke of Wellington?”",do old medal 
34,"Poor Meta and Ethel, what a downfall! Meta was sure that Norman had known it the whole time, and he owned to having guessed it from Harry’s importunity for the search. Harry and Mary had certainly made good use of their time, and great was the mirth over the trap so cleverly set--the more when it was disclosed that Dr. May had been a full participator in the scheme, had suggested the addition of the pottery, had helped Harry to some liquid to efface part of the inscription, and had even come up with them to plant the snare in the most plausible corner for researches.",poor downfall sure know whole time own guess importunity search make good use time great mirth trap set more disclose full participator scheme suggest addition pottery help liquid efface part inscription come plant snare plausible corner researche

36,"The sight of those great baskets of good fare was appetising, and the company soon collected on the shady turf, where Richard made himself extremely useful, and the feast was spread without any worse mishap than Nipen’s running away with half a chicken, of which he was robbed, as Tom reported, by a surly-looking dog that watched in the outskirts of the camp, and caused Tom to return nearly as fast as the poor little white marauder.",sight great basket good fare appetising company collect shady turf make useful feast spread bad mishap run chicken rob report surly look dog watch outskirt camp cause return poor little white marauder 
37,"Meta “very immorally,” as Norman told her, comforted Nipen with a large share of her sandwiches. Harry armed himself with a stick and Mary with a stone, and marched off to the attack, but saw no signs of the enemy, and had begun to believe him a figment of Tom’s imagination, when Mary spied him under a bush, lying at the feet of a boy, with whom he was sharing the spoil.",meta tell comfort large share sandwich arm stick stone march attack see sign enemy begin believe figment imagination spy bush lie foot boy share spoil

49,"The boy was desired to wait while the brother and sister, in breathless excitement, rushed back with their story.",boy desire wait brother sister breathless excitement rush story 
50,"Mrs. Wilmot was at first inclined to fear that the naval part of it had been inspired by Harry’s uniform, but the examination of Jem Jennings put it beyond a doubt that he spoke nothing but the truth; and the choicest delight of the feast was the establishing him and Toby behind the barrow, and feeding them with such viands as they had probably never seen before.",first inclined fear naval part inspire uniform examination put doubt speak truth choicest delight feast establish barrow feed such viand see 
51,"The boy could not read writing, but he had his father’s letter in his pocket, and Mary capered at the delightful coincidence, on finding that Jem Jennings was actually a quarter-master on board the Alcestis. It gave a sort of property in the boy, and she almost grudged Meta the having been first to say that she would pay for the rest of his journey, instead of doing it by subscription.",boy read writing have father letter pocket caper delightful coincidence find quarter master board give sort property boy grudge first say pay rest journey do subscription 
52,"However, Mary had a consolation, she would offer to take charge of Toby, who, as Harry observed, would otherwise have been drowned--he could not be taken on board. To be sure, he was a particularly ugly animal, rough, grisly, short-legged, long-backed, and with an apology for a tail--but he had a redeeming pair of eyes, and he and Jem lived on terms of such close friendship, that he would have been miserable in leaving him to the mercy of Nanny Brooks.",have consolation offer take charge observe drown take board sure ugly animal rough grisly short legged long back apology tail have redeem pair eye live term such close friendship miserable leave mercy 
53,"So, after their meal, Jem and Toby were bidden to wait for Dr. May’s coming, and fell asleep together on the green bank, while the rest either sketched, or wandered, or botanised. Flora acted the grown-up lady with Mrs. Wilmot, and Meta found herself sitting by Ethel, asking her a great many questions about Margaret, and her home, and what it could be like to be one of such a numerous family. Flora had always turned aside from personal matters, as uninteresting to her companion, and, in spite of Meta’s admiration, and the mutual wish to be intimate, confidence did not spring up spontaneously, as it had done with the doctor, and, in that single hour, with Margaret. Blunt as Ethel was, her heartiness of manner gave a sense of real progress in friendship. Their Confirmation vows seemed to make a link, and Meta’s unfeigned enthusiasm for the doctor was the sure road to Ethel’s heart. She was soon telling how glad Margaret was that he had been drawn into taking pleasure in to-day’s scheme, since, not only were his spirits tried by the approach of Harry’s departure, but he had, within the last few days, been made very sad by reading and answering Aunt Flora’s first letter on the news of last October’s misfortune.",meal bidd wait come fall green bank rest sketch wander botanise act grow lady find sit ask great many question home numerous family turn personal matter uninteresting companion spite admiration mutual wish intimate confidence spring do doctor single hour heartiness manner give sense real progress friendship confirmation vow seem make link unfeigned enthusiasm doctor sure road heart tell glad draw take pleasure day scheme spirit try approach departure last few day make sad read answer first letter news last misfortune

He was an officer at Edinburgh, and fell in love with Aunt Flora, but my grandfather Mackenzie thought him too poor to marry her, and it was all broken off, and they tried to think no more of it. But grandpapa died, and she came to live here, and somehow Mr. Arnott turned up again, quartered at Whitford, and papa talked over my Uncle Mackenzie, and helped them--and Mr. Arnott thought the best way would be to go out to the colonies. They went when New Zealand was very new, and a very funny life they had! Once they had their house burned in Heki’s rebellion--and Aunt Flora saw a Maori walking about in her best Sunday bonnet; but, in general, everything has gone on very well, and he has a great farm, besides an office under government.”",have much do pretty story officer fall love grandfather think poor marry break try think more die come live turn quarter talk help think good way go colony go new new funny life have have house burn rebellion see walking good bonnet general go have great farm office government

77,"“Oh, no rational person,” cried Meta. “It was so nice to think of her being with the poor mother, and I was quite interested in managing for myself; besides, you know, it was just a proof how one learns to be selfish, that it had never occurred to me that I ought to spare her.”",rational person cry nice think poor mother interested manage know proof learn selfish occur spare

I never liked any lessons as well as those I did without being obliged, and always, when there is a thing I hate very much in itself, I can get up an interest in it, by resolving that I will do it well, or fast, or something--if I can stick my will to it, it is like a lever, and it is done.

I was born with it; I never did mind anything, not even being punished, they say, unless I knew papa was grieved, which always did make me unhappy enough. I laughed, and went to play most saucily, whatever they did to me. If I had striven for the temper, it would be worth having, but it is my nature. And Ethel,”  she added, in a low voice, as the tears came into her eyes, “don’t you remember last Sunday? I felt myself so vain and petted a thing! as if I had no share in the Cup of suffering, and did not deserve to call myself a member--it seemed ungrateful.”",sort temper goodness bear mind punish say know papa grieve make unhappy laugh go play most do strive temper worth have nature add low voice tear come eye remember last feel vain pett thing have share cup suffering deserve call member seem ungrateful 
94,"Ethel felt ashamed, as she heard of warmer feelings than her own had been, expressed in that lowered trembling voice, and she sought for the answer that would only come to her mind in sense, not at first in words. “Discipline,” said she, “would not that show the willingness to have the part? Taking the right times for refusing oneself some pleasant thing.”",feel ashamed hear warm feeling own express lower tremble voice seek answer come mind sense first word discipline say show willingness have part take right time refuse pleasant thing

111,"Meta was much affected, and began to put together what the father and daughter had said. Perhaps the little modes of secret discipline, of which Ethel had spoken, might be the true means of clasping the staff--perhaps she had been impatient, and wanting in humility in craving for the strife, when her armour was scarce put on.",affect begin put father daughter say little mode secret discipline speak true means clasp staff impatient want humility craving strife armour scarce put 
112,"Dr. May spoke once again. “Don’t let any one long for external trial. The offering of a free heart is the thing. To offer praise is the great object of all creatures in heaven and earth. If the happier we are, the more we praise, then all is well.”",speak let one long external trial offering free heart thing offer praise great object creature heaven earth happy praise well 
113,But the serious discussion was suddenly broken off.,serious discussion break 
114,"Others had seen Dr. May’s approach, and Harry and Mary rushed down in dismay at their story having, as they thought, been forestalled. However, they had it all to themselves, and the doctor took up the subject as keenly as could have been hoped, but the poor boy being still fast asleep, after, probably, much fatigue, he would not then waken him to examine him, but came and sat down in the semicircle, formed by a terraced bank of soft turf, where Mrs. Larpent, Mrs. Wilmot, Richard, and Flora, had for some time taken up their abode. Meta brought him the choice little basket of fruit which she had saved for him, and all delighted in having him there, evidently enjoying the rest and sport very much, as he reposed on the fragrant slope, eating grapes, and making inquiries as to the antiquities lately discovered.",other see approach rush dismay story think forestall have doctor take subject hope poor boy fast asleep much fatigue wake examine come sit semicircle form terrace bank soft turf time take abode bring choice little basket fruit save delight have enjoy rest sport repose fragrant slope eat grape make inquiry antiquity discover 
115,"Norman gave an exceedingly droll account of the great Roman Emperor, Tiberius V.V., and Meta correcting it, there was a regular gay skirmish of words, which entertained every one extremely--above all, Meta’s indignation when the charge was brought home to her of having declared the “old Duke” exactly like in turns to Domitian and Tiberius--his features quite forbidding.",give droll account great roman emperor correct be regular gay skirmish word entertain one indignation charge bring declare old turn feature forbid

117,"Meta proposed what she called the story play. One was to be sent out of earshot, and the rest to agree upon a word, which was then to be guessed by each telling a story, and introducing the word into it, not too prominently. Meta volunteered to guess, and Harry whispered to Mary it would be no go, but, in the meantime, the word was found, and Blanche eagerly recalled Meta, and sat in the utmost expectation and delight. Meta turned first to Richard, but he coloured distressfully, and begged that Flora might tell his story for him--he should only spoil the game. Flora, with a little tinge of graceful reluctance, obeyed. “No woman had been to the summit of Mont Blanc,” she said, “till one young girl, named Marie, resolved to have this glory. The guides told her it was madness, but she persevered. She took the staff, and everything requisite, and, following a party, began the ascent. She bravely supported every fatigue, climbed each precipice, was undaunted by the giddy heights she attained, bravely crossed the fields of snow, supported the bitter cold, and finally, though suffering severely, arrived at the topmost peak, looked forth where woman had never looked before, felt her heart swell at the attainment of her utmost ambition, and the name of Marie was inscribed as that of the woman who alone has had the glory of standing on the summit of the Giant of the Alps.”",propose call story play send earshot rest agree word guess tell story introduce word volunteer guess whisper go meantime word find recall sit utmost expectation delight turn coloured begg tell story spoil game little tinge graceful reluctance obey woman summit say young girl name resolve have glory guide tell madness persever take staff requisite follow party begin ascent support fatigue climb precipice undaunt giddy height attain cross field snow support bitter cold suffer arrive topmost peak look woman look feel heart swell attainment utmost ambition name inscribe woman have glory stand summit

The captain had a glorious collection of old coins, and the like, dug up in some of the old Greek colonies, and whenever Master Monkey saw him overhauling them, he would get out a brass button, or a card or two, and turn ‘em over, and chatter at them, and glory over them, quite knowing,” said Harry, imitating the gesture, “and I dare say he saw V.V., and Tiberius Caesar, as well as the best of them.”",stupid say have old sailor board giant voice sail have monkey pick day old fellow find queer messmate call spying glass captain captain have glorious collection old coin like dig old greek colony see overhaul get brass button card turn chatter glory know say imitate gesture say see good

121,"“I shall blunder, I forewarn you,” said Ethel, “but this is mine: There was a young king who had an old tutor, whom he despised because he was so strict, so he got rid of him, and took to idle sport. One day, when he was out hunting in a forest, a white hind came and ran before him, till she guided him to a castle, and there he found a lady all dressed in white, with a beamy crown on head, and so nobly beautiful that he fell in love with her at once, and was only sorry to see another prince who was come to her palace too. She told them her name was Gloria, and that she had had many suitors, but the choice did not depend on herself--she could only be won by him who deserved her, and for three years they were to be on their probation, trying for her. So she dismissed them, only burning to gain her, and telling them to come back in three years’ time. But they had not gone far before they saw another palace, much finer, all glittering with gold and silver, and their Lady Gloria came out to meet them, not in her white dress, but in one all gay and bright with fine colours, and her crown they now saw was of diamonds. She told them they had only seen her everyday dress and house, this was her best; and she showed them about the castle, and all the pictures of her former lovers. There was Alexander, who had been nearer retaining her than any one, only the fever prevented it; there was Pyrrhus, always seeking her, but slain by a tile; Julius Caesar--Tamerlane--all the rest, and she hoped that one of these two would really prove worthy and gain her, by going in the same path as these great people.",blunder forewarn say be young king have old tutor despise strict get rid take idle sport day hunt forest white hind come run guide castle find lady dress white beamy crown head beautiful fall love sorry see prince come palace tell name have many suitor choice depend win deserve year probation try dismiss burn gain tell come year time go see palace finer glitter gold silver come meet white dress gay bright fine colour crown see diamond tell see everyday dress house good show castle picture former lover be retain one fever prevent be seek slain tile rest hope prove worthy gain go same path great person 
122,"“So our prince went home; his head full of being like Alexander and all the rest of them, and he sent for his good old tutor to reckon up his armies, and see whom he could conquer in order to win her. But the old tutor told him he was under a mistake; the second lady he had seen was a treacherous cousin of Gloria, who drew away her suitors by her deceits, and whose real name was Vana Gloria. If he wished to earn the true Gloria, he must set to work to do his subjects good, and to be virtuous. And he did; he taught them, and he did justice to them, and he bore it patiently and kindly when they did not understand. But by-and-by the other king, who had no good tutor to help him, had got his armies together, and conquered ever so many people, and drawn off their men to be soldiers; and now he attacked the good prince, and was so strong that he gained the victory, though both prince and subjects fought manfully with heart and hand; but the battle was lost, and the faithful prince wounded and made prisoner, but bearing it most patiently, till he was dragged behind the other’s triumphal car with all the rest, when the three years were up, to be presented to Vana Gloria. And so he was carried into the forest, bleeding and wounded, and his enemy drove the car over his body, and stretched out his arms to Vana Gloria, and found her a vain, ugly wretch, who grew frightful as soon as he grasped her. But the good dying prince saw the beautiful beamy face of his lady--love bending over him. ‘Oh!’ he said, ‘vision of my life, hast thou come to lighten my dying eyes? Never--never, even in my best days, did I deem that I could be worthy of thee; the more I strove, the more I knew that Gloria is for none below--for me less than all.’",prince go head full rest send good old tutor reckon army see conquer order win old tutor tell mistake second lady see treacherous cousin draw suitor deceit real name wish earn true set work do subject good virtuous teach do justice bear understand other king have good tutor help get army conquer many person draw man soldier attack good prince strong gain victory prince subject fight heart hand battle lose faithful prince wound make prisoner bear drag other triumphal car rest year present carry forest bleed wound enemy drive car body stretch arm find vain ugly wretch grow frightful grasp good die prince see beautiful beamy face lady love bending say vision life come lighten die eye good day deem worthy more strive more know less

129,"“My story will not be as long as Ethel’s,” said the doctor, yielding with a half-reluctant smile. “My story is of a humming-bird, a little creature that loved its master with all its strength, and longed to do somewhat for him. It was not satisfied with its lot, because it seemed merely a vain and profitless creature. The nightingale sang praise, and the woods sounded with the glory of its strains; the fowl was valued for its flesh, the ostrich for its plume, but what could the little humming-bird do, save rejoice in the glory of the flood of sunbeams, and disport itself over the flowers, and glance in the sunny light, as its bright breastplate flashed from rich purple to dazzling flame-colour, and its wings supported it, fluttering so fast that the eye could hardly trace them, as it darted its slender beak into the deep-belled blossoms. So the little bird grieved, and could not rest, for thinking that it was useless in this world, that it sought merely its own gratification, and could do nothing that could conduce to the glory of its master. But one night a voice spoke to the little bird, ‘Why hast thou been placed here,’ it said, ‘but at the will of thy master? Was it not that he might delight himself in thy radiant plumage, and see thy joy in the sunshine? His gifts are thy buoyant wing, thy beauteous colours, the love of all around, the sweetness of the honey-drop in the flowers, the shade of the palm leaf. Esteem them, then, as his; value thine own bliss, while it lasts, as the token of his care and love; and while thy heart praises him for them, and thy wings quiver and dance to the tune of that praise, then, indeed, thy gladness conduces to no vain-glory of thine own, in beauty, or in graceful flight, but thou art a creature serving--as best thou canst to his glory.’”",story say doctor yield half reluctant smile story hum bird little creature love master strength long do satisfied lot seem vain profitless creature nightingale sing praise wood sound glory strain fowl value flesh ostrich plume little hum bird do save rejoice glory flood sunbeam disport flower glance sunny light bright breastplate flash rich purple dazzle flame colour wing support flutter eye trace dart slender beak deep bell blossom little bird grieve rest think useless world seek own gratification do conduce glory master night voice speak little bird place say will master delight radiant plumage see joy sunshine gift buoyant wing beauteous colour love sweetness honey drop flower shade palm leaf esteem value own bliss last token care love heart praise wing quiver dance tune praise gladness conduce vain glory own beauty graceful flight art creature serve good glory

131,"The elder ladies had begun to look at watches, and talk of time to go home; and Jem Jemmings having been seen rearing himself up from behind the barrow, the doctor proceeded to investigate his case, was perfectly satisfied of the boy’s truth, and as ready as the young ones to befriend him. A letter should be written at once, desiring his father to look out for him on Friday, when he should go by the same train as Harry, who was delighted at the notion of protecting him so far, and begged to be allowed to drive him home to Stoneborough in the gig.",elder lady begin look watch talk time go see rear barrow doctor proceed investigate case satisfied boy truth ready young one befriend letter write desire father look go same train delight notion protect begg allow drive gig 
132,"Consent was given; and Richard being added to give weight and discretion, the gig set out at once--the doctor, much to Meta’s delight, took his place in the brake. Blanche, who, in the morning, had been inclined to despise it as something akin to a cart, now finding it a popular conveyance, was urgent to return in it; and Flora was made over to the carriage, not at all unwillingly, for, though it separated her from Meta, it made a senior of her.",consent give add give weight discretion gig set doctor much delight take place brake morning inclined despise akin cart find popular conveyance urgent return make carriage separate make senior

He had enjoyed the day exceedingly, with that sort of abandon more than ordinarily delicious to grave or saddened temperaments, when roused or drawn out for a time. Meta’s winning grace and sweetness had a peculiar charm for him, and, perhaps, his having been originally introduced to her as ill, and in sorrow, had given her manner towards him a sort of kindness which was very gratifying.",fate convey exalt seat driver brake catch sound mirth enjoy day sort abandon more delicious grave sadden temperament rouse draw time win grace sweetness have peculiar charm introduce ill sorrow give manner sort kindness gratifying

Dr. Hoxton’s dull scholarship would chill all pleasure in his studies--there would be no companionship among the boys--even his supporters, Ernescliffe and Larkins, were gone, and Harry would leave him still under a cloud.",feel go dusky dusty world last blith day holiday past return misapprehension injustice blight school career keep boy ability generous feeling find attainment useless restore position dull scholarship chill pleasure study be companionship boy supporter gone leave cloud

142,"Little Larkins had told all, and his father had no scruple in repeating it, and causing the investigation to be set on foot. Nay, he deemed that Norman’s influence had saved his son, and came, as anxious to thank him, as Dr. Hoxton, warm-hearted, though injudicious, was to repair his injustice. They were much surprised and struck by finding that Dr. May had been aware of the truth the whole time, and had patiently put up with the injustice, and the loss of the scholarship--a loss which Dr. Hoxton would have given anything to repair, so as to have sent up a scholar likely to do him so much credit; but it was now too late, and he had only been able to tell Margaret how dismayed he was at finding out that the boy to whom all the good order in his school was owing had been so ill-used. Kind Dr. May’s first feeling really seemed to be pity and sympathy for his old friend, the head-master, in the shock of such a discovery. Harry was vociferously telling his version of the story to Ethel and Mary. Tom stood transfixed in attention.
