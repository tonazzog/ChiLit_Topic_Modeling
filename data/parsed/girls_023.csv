2,"All the stupor and languor which immediately followed Nan's fall passed off during her drive home; she chatted and laughed, her cheeks were flushed, her eyes bright.

Please God, there _is_ nothing wrong; cut one cannot be too careful.""",careful keep sun dear hold parasol good get put bed god wrong cut careful 
6,"Something in Miss Danesbury's manner affected Hester strangely; she clasped Nan's slight baby form closer and closer to her heart, and no longer joined in the little one's mirth.  As the drive drew to a close, Nan again ceased talking, and fell into a heavy sleep.",manner affect clasp slight baby form close close heart join little one mirth drive draw close cease talk fall heavy sleep 
7,"Miss Danesbury's face grew graver and graver, and, when the waggonette drew up at Lavender House, she insisted on lifting the sleeping child out of Hester's arms, and carrying her up to her little crib.  When Nan's little head was laid on the cool pillow, she again opened her eyes, and instantly asked for a drink.  Miss Danesbury gave her some milk and water, but the moment she drank it she was sick.",face grow graver graver waggonette draw insist lift sleeping child arm carry little crib little head lay cool pillow open eye ask drink give milk water moment drink sick

11,"""Don't, my dear,"" said the governess; ""you must keep quiet for Nan's sake.  Please God, she will soon be better.  All I really apprehend is a little excitement and feverishness, which will pass off in a few days with care.  Hester, my dear, I suddenly remember that the house is nearly empty, for all the servants are also enjoying a holiday.  I think I must send you for Dr Mayflower.  The waggonette is still at the door. Drive at once to town, my dear, and ask the coachman to take you to Number 10, The Parade.  If you are very quick, you will catch Dr Mayflower before he goes out on his afternoon rounds.""",dear say governess keep quiet sake good apprehend little excitement feverishness pass few day care dear remember house empty servant enjoy holiday think send waggonette door drive town dear ask coachman take quick catch go afternoon round

14,"Hester snatched up her hat and flew downstairs.  In a moment she was in the waggonette, and the driver was speedily urging his horses in the direction of the small town of Sefton, two miles and a half away. Hester was terrified now--so terrified, in such an agony, that she even forgot Annie; her hatred toward Annie became of secondary importance to her.  All her ideas, all her thoughts, were swallowed up in the one great hope--Should she be in time to reach Dr Mayflower's house before he set off on his afternoon rounds?  As the waggonette approached Sefton she buried her face in her hands and uttered a sharp inward cry of agony.",snatch hat fly moment waggonette driver urge horse direction small town mile half terrify terrified agony forget hatred become secondary importance idea thought swallow great hope time reach house set afternoon round waggonette approach bury face hand utter sharp inward cry agony 
15,"""Please God, let me find the doctor!""  It was a real prayer from her heart of hearts.  The waggonette drew up at the doctor's residence, to discover him stepping into his brougham.  Hester was a shy child, and had never seen him before; but she instantly raised her voice, and almost shouted to him--""You are to come with me; please, you are to come at once.  Little Nan is ill--she is hurt.  Please, you are to come at once.""",let find doctor real prayer heart heart waggonette draw doctor residence discover step brougham shy child see raise voice shout come come little ill hurt come

19,"Hester sat back in the soft-cushioned carriage, which bowled smoothly along the road.  It seemed to her impatience that the pace at which they went was not half quick enough--she longed to put her head out of the window to shout to the coachman to go faster.  She felt intensely provoked with the doctor, who sat placidly by her side reading a newspaper.",sit soft cushion carriage bowl road seem impatience pace go half quick long put head window shout coachman go fast feel provoke doctor sit side read newspaper

21,"""We always take precisely twenty minutes to drive from the Parade to Lavender House--twenty minutes, neither more nor less.  We shall be there now in exactly ten minutes.""  Hester tried to smile, but failed; her agony of apprehension grew and grew.  She breathed more freely when they turned into the avenue.  When they stopped at the wide stone porch, and the doctor got out, she uttered a sigh of relief.",take minute drive minute more less minute try smile fail agony apprehension grow grow breathe turn avenue stop wide stone porch doctor get utter sigh relief 
22,"She took Dr Mayflower herself up to Nan's room.  Miss Danesbury opened the door, the doctor went inside, and Hester crouched down on the landing and waited.  It seemed to her that the good physician would never come out.  When he did she raised a perfectly blanched face to his, she opened her lips, tried to speak, but no words would come.  Her agitation was so intense that the kind-hearted doctor took instant pity on her.",take room open door doctor go crouch landing wait seem good physician come raise blanch face open lip try speak word come agitation intense kind hearted doctor take instant pity
