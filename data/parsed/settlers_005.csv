1,CHAPTER 5. SUNRISE OVER THE LEVELS.,chapter levels 
2,"All the party slept for some hours, as quietly and unconsciously as little George himself.  If the children were so weary that the dreadful uncertainty about their father's fate could not keep them awake, it is probable that a knowledge of their own danger might have failed to disturb them.  But they had little more idea than George himself of the extent of the peril they were in.  They did not know that the Levels were surrounded by hills on every side but towards the sea; or, if they knew, they did not consider this, because the hills were a great way off.  But, whether they were far or near, this circle of hills was the cause of the waters rising to a great height in the Levels, when once the defences that had kept out the sea and the rivers were broken down. As the hills prevented the overflowing waters from running off on three sides, it was clear that the waters must rise to the level of the sea and the rivers from which they flowed in.  They had not reached this height when the children lay down to rest, though Ailwin was so sure that the worst was over; and the danger increased as they slept; slept too soundly even to dream of accidents.",party sleep hour little child weary dreadful uncertainty father fate keep probable knowledge own danger fail disturb have little more idea extent peril know level surround hill side sea know consider hill great way circle hill cause water rise great height defence keep sea river break hill prevent overflow water run side clear water rise level sea river flow reach height child lay rest sure bad danger increase sleep sleep dream accident 
3,"The first disturbance was from the child.  Oliver became aware, through his sleep, that little George was moving about and laughing.  Oliver murmured, ""Be quiet, George.  Lie still, dear,"" and the child was quiet for a minute.  Presently, however, he moved again, and something like a dabbling in water was heard, while, at the same moment, Oliver found his feet cold.  He roused himself with a start, felt that his bed was wet, and turning out, was up to the ankles in water.  By the light of the embers, he saw that the floor was a pond, with some shoes floating on it.  His call woke Ailwin and Mildred at once.  Roger did not stir, though there was a good deal of bustle and noise.",first disturbance child become aware sleep little move laugh murmure quiet lie dear child quiet minute move dabbling water hear same moment find foot cold rouse start feel bed wet turn ankle water light ember see floor pond shoe float call wake stir be good deal bustle noise 
4,"Mildred's bed was so high above the floor as to be still quite dry. Oliver told her to stay there till he should settle what was to be done next: and he took up the child to put him with Mildred, asking her to strip off his drenched clothes, and keep him warm.  All the apparel that had been taken off was luckily on the top of a chest, far above the water.  Oliver handed this to his sister, bidding her dress herself, as well as the child.  He then carefully put the fire together, to make as much light as possible, and then told Ailwin that they must bestir themselves, as the fire would presently be drowned out.",bed high floor dry tell stay settle do take child put ask strip drench clothes keep warm apparel take top chest water hand sister bid dress child put fire make much light possible tell bestir fire drown 
5,"Ailwin was quite ready to bestir herself; but she had no idea beyond mounting on chests, chairs, and drawers; unless, indeed, she thought of the beam which crossed the ceiling, to which she was seen to cast her eyes, as if envying the chicks which hung there, or the hen which still slept, with her head beneath her wing, out of present reach of the flood.",ready bestir have idea mount chest chair drawer think beam cross ceiling see cast eye envy chick hang hen sleep head wing present reach flood 
6,"Oliver disapproved of the plan of mounting on the furniture of the room. It might be all very well, he said, if there were nothing better to be done.  But, by the time the water would reach the top of the chests, it would be impossible to get out by the door.  He thought it would be wisest to reach the roof of the house while they could, and to carry with them all the comforts they could collect, while they might be removed in a dry condition.  Ailwin agreed, and was going to throw open the door, when Oliver stopped her hand.",disapprove plan mount furniture room say be good do time water reach top chest impossible get door think wisest reach roof house carry comfort collect remove dry condition agree go throw open door stop hand 
7,"""Why, Oliver,"" she cried, ""you won't let one do anything; and you say, all the time, that there is not a minute to be lost.""",cry let do say time be minute lose 
8,"Oliver showed her that water was streaming in at the sides of the door, a good way higher up than it stood on the floor.  He said that the door was a defence at present,--that the water was higher on the stairs than in the room, and that there would be a great rush as soon as the door should be opened.  He wished, therefore, that the bedding, and the clothes from the drawers, and all else that they could remove to the top of the house, should be bundled up, and placed on the highest chest of drawers, before the water should be let in.  They must borrow the line from the clothes' basket, to tie round George's waist, that they might not lose him in the confusion.  One other thing must be done: they must rouse Roger, or he might be drowned.",show water stream side door good way high stand floor say door defence present water high stair room be great rush door open wish bedding clothes drawer else remove top house bundle place high chest drawer water let borrow line clothes basket tie waist lose confusion other thing do rouse drown 
9,"Ailwin was anxious that this last piece of duty should be omitted:--not that she exactly wished that Roger should be drowned,--at least, not through her means; but she, ignorant as she was,--had a superstitious feeling that Roger and his family had caused this flood, and that he could save himself well enough, though he appeared to be sunk in a drunken sleep.  She indulged Oliver, however, so far as to help him to seize the lad, neck and heels, and lay him, dripping as he was, upon the table.",anxious last piece duty omit wish drown least means ignorant have superstitious feeling family cause flood save appear sink drunken sleep indulge help seize lad neck heel lay drip table 
10,"Before the bedding and clothes were all tied up, the door of the room shook so as to threaten to burst in, from the latch giving way.  It struck everybody that the person who should open it would run the risk of being suffocated, or terribly knocked about; and yet, it was hardly wise to wait for its bursting.  Oliver, therefore, tied a string to the knob of the bolt, then slipped the bolt, to keep the door fastened while he lifted and tied up the latch.  The door shook more and more; so, having set the window wide open, he made haste to scramble up to where Mildred was, wound the cord which was about George's waist round his own arm, bade Mildred hold the child fast, and gave notice that he was going to open the door.  It was a strange party, as the boy could not help noting at the moment,--the maid standing on the bed, hugging the bed-post, and staring with frightened eyes; Roger snoring on the table, just under the sleeping hen on the beam; and the three children perched on the top of a high chest of drawers.  George took it all for play,-- the new sash he had on and the bolting the door, and the climbing and scrambling.  He laughed and kicked, so that his sister could scarcely hold him.  ""Now for it!"" cried Oliver.",bedding clothes tie door room shake threaten burst latch give way strike person open run risk suffocate knock wise wait burst tie string knob bolt slip bolt keep door fasten lift tie latch door shake more more set window open make haste scramble wind cord waist own arm bid hold child give notice go open door strange party boy help note moment maid stand bed hug bed post stare frighten eye snore table sleeping hen beam child perch top high chest drawer take play new sash have bolt door climb scramble laugh kick sister hold cry 
11,"""Oh, Oliver, stop a minute!"" cried Ailwin.  ""Don't be in such a hurry to drown us all, Oliver.  Stop a moment, Oliver.""",stop minute cry hurry drown stop moment 
12,"Oliver knew, however, that the way to drown them all was to stop.  At the first pull the bolt gave way, the door burst open, as if it would break from its hinges, and a great body of water dashed in.  The first thing the wave did was to wash Roger off the table; the next, to put out the fire with a fizz,--so that there was no other light but the dawn, now advancing.  The waters next dashed up against the wall opposite the door; and then by the rebound, with less force, against the drawers on which the children sat.  It then leaped out of the window, leaving a troubled surface at about half the height of the room.  Above the noise, Ailwin was heard lamenting, the chicks cluttering, the hen fluttering, and George laughing and clapping his hands.",know way drown stop first pull bolt give way door burst open break hinge great body water dash first thing wave wash table next put fire fizz be other light dawn advance water dash wall door rebound less force drawer child sit leap window leave troubled surface height room noise hear lament chick clutter hen flutter laugh clap hand 
13,"""You have George safe?"" said Oliver.  ""Very well!  I believe we can all get out.  There is Roger's head above water; and I don't think it is more than up to my neck; though everybody laughs at me for being a short boy.""",have safe say believe get be head water think more neck laugh short boy 
14,"He stepped down upon a chair, and then cautiously into the water.  It was very nearly up to his chin.",step chair water chin 
15,"""That will do,"" said he, cheerfully.  ""Now, Ailwin, you are the tallest;--please carry George out on the roof of the house, and stay there with him till I come.""",do say tall carry roof house stay come 
16,"Ailwin made many lamentations at having to step down into the water; but she took good care of the child, carrying him quite high and dry. Oliver followed, to see that he was tied securely to the balustrade on the roof.  While he was doing this, Ailwin brought Mildred in the same way.  Mildred wanted to be of use below; but her brother told her the best thing she could do was to watch and amuse George, and to stand ready to receive the things saved from the chambers,--she not being tall enough to do any service in four feet of water.",make many lamentation have step water take good care child carry high dry follow see tie balustrade roof do bring same way want use brother tell good thing do watch amuse stand ready receive thing save chamber tall do service foot water 
17,"It was a strange forlorn feeling to Mildred,--the being left on the house-top in the cold grey morning, at an hour when she had always hitherto been asleep in bed.  The world itself, as she looked round her, seemed unlike the one she had hitherto lived in.  The stars were in the sky; but they were dim,--fading before the light of morning.  There were no fields, no gardens, no roads to be seen;--only grey water, far away on every side.  She could see nothing beyond this grey water, except towards the east, where a line of low hills stood between her and the brightening sky.  Poor Mildred felt dizzy, with so much moving water before her eyes, and in her ears the sound of the current below.  The house shook and trembled, too, under the force of the flood: so that she was glad to fix her sight on the steady line of the distant hills.  She spoke to George occasionally, to keep him quiet; and she was ready to receive every article that was handed up the stairs from below: but, in all the intervals, she fixed her eyes on the distant hills.  She thought how easy it would be to reach that ridge, if she were a bird; and how hard it would be to pine away on this house-top, or to sink to death in these waters, for want of the wings which inferior creatures had.  Then she thought of superior creatures that had wings too: and she longed to be an angel.  She longed to be out of all this trouble and fear; and considered that it would be worth while to be drowned, to be as free as a bird or an angel.  She resolved to remember this, and not to be frightened, if the water should rise and rise, till it should sweep her quite away.  She thought that this might have befallen her mother yesterday.  No boat had been seen on the waters in the direction of Gainsborough; no sign had reached the family that any one was thinking of them at a distance, and trying to save them: and Oliver and Mildred had agreed that it was likely that Mrs Linacre had heard some report of the pulling up of the sluices, and might have been on her way home when the flood overtook and drowned her.  If so, she might be now an angel. If an angel, Mildred was sure her first thought would be, as it had ever been, of her home and her children; and the little girl looked up to see whether there was anything like the shadow of wings between her and the dim stars.  She saw nothing; but still, in some kind of hope, she softly breathed the words, ""O, mother!  Mother!""",strange forlorn feeling leave house top cold grey morning hour asleep bed world look seem one live star sky dim fade light morning be field garden road see grey water side see grey water east line low hill stand brighten sky poor feel dizzy much move water eye ear sound current house shake tremble force flood glad fix sight steady line distant hill speak keep quiet ready receive article hand stair interval fix eye distant hill think easy reach ridge bird hard pine house top sink death water want wing inferior creature have think superior creature have wing long angel long trouble fear consider worth while drown free bird angel resolve remember frighten water rise rise sweep think befall mother yesterday boat see water direction sign reach family one think distance try save agree likely hear report pull sluice way flood overtake drown angel angel sure first thought home child little girl look see be shadow wing dim star see kind hope breathe word mother mother 
18,"""Mother!  Mother!"" shouted little George, as he overheard her.  Oliver leaped up the stairs, and inquired whether there was a boat,--whether mother was coming.",mother mother shout little overhear leap stair inquire be boat mother come 
19,"""No, Oliver, no.  I was only thinking about mother; and so, I suppose, was George.  I am afraid you are disappointed;--I am sorry.""",think mother suppose afraid disappointed sorry 
20,"Oliver bit his lip to prevent crying, and could not speak directly; but seemed to be gazing carefully all around the waste.  He said, at last, that he had many times thought that his mother might come in a boat: and he thought she might still, unless...",bite lip prevent cry speak seem gaze waste say last have many time think mother come boat think 
21,"""Unless she should be an angel now,"" whispered Mildred,--""unless she died yesterday; and then she might be with us now, at this very moment, though we cannot see her;--might not she?""",angel whisper die yesterday very moment see 
22,"""Yes, I believe so, dear.  And, for one thing, I almost wish she may not come in a boat.  Who should tell her that father was carried away into all those waters, without having spoken one word to us?""",believe dear thing wish come boat tell father carry water speak word 
23,"""If they are both dead, do you not think they are together now?"" asked Mildred.",dead think ask 
24,"""Certainly.  Pastor Dendel says that all who love one another well enough will live together, where they will never die any more.""",say love live die more 
25,"""And I am sure they did,"" said Mildred.",sure say 
26,"""If they see us now,"" said Oliver, ""it must make a great difference to them whether we are frightened and miserable, or whether we behave as we ought to do.  Let us try not to be frightened, for their sakes, dear.""",see say make great difference frighten miserable behave do let try frighten sake dear 
27,"""And if they are not with us all the while, God is,"" whispered Mildred.",while whisper 
28,"""O, yes; but God knows ...  God will not expect...""",know expect 
29,"""Surely He will feel in some way as they do about us,"" said Mildred, remembering and repeating the verse Pastor Dendel had taught her. ""`Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.'""",feel way do say remember repeat verse teach father child pitieth fear 
30,"""`For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.'""  So Oliver continued the psalm.",knoweth frame remembereth dust continue psalm 
31,"""There comes the sun!"" exclaimed Mildred, happy to greet some one familiar object amidst this strange scene.",come sun exclaim happy greet familiar object strange scene 
32,"The scene hardly appeared the same when the sun, after first peeping above the hills like a golden star, flamed up to its full size, and cast a broad glittering light over the wide waters, and into the very eyes of the children.  They felt the warmth too, immediately; and it was very cheering.  The eastern hills now almost disappeared in the sun's blaze; and those to the west shone very clearly; and the southern ridge near Gainsborough, looked really but a little way off.  The children knew, however, that there were three full miles between them and any land, except their Red-hill, and a few hillocks which peeped above the flood in the Levels: and there was no sign of a boat, far or near.  Oliver checked a sigh, when he had convinced himself of this; and began to look what had become of the people they knew in the Levels.",scene appear same sun peep hill golden star flame full size cast broad glitter light wide water very eye child feel warmth cheer eastern hill disappear sun blaze west shine southern ridge look little child know be full mile land red hill few hillock peep flood be sign boat check sigh convince begin look become person know 
33,"Neighbour Gool's dwelling stood low; and nothing was now to be seen of it but a dark speck, which might be the top of a chimney.  It was possible that the whole family might have escaped; for Gool and his wife were to be at Haxey yesterday; and they might there hear of the mischief intended or done to the sluices, in time to save the rest of the household.  Some of the roofs of the hamlet of Sandtoft stood above the waters; and the whole upper part of the chapel used by the foreigners; and many might easily have found a refuge there.  Further off, a conspicuous object was the elegant crocketed spire of one of the beautiful Lincolnshire churches, standing high, as if inviting those who were dismayed to come and save themselves in the air from the dangers of the waters.  Oliver wondered whether any sufferers were now watching the sunrise from the long ridge of the church-roof, or from the windows of the spire.",neighbour dwelling stand low see dark speck top chimney possible whole family escape wife yesterday hear mischief intend do sluice time save rest household roof hamlet stand water whole upper part chapel use foreigner many find refuge conspicuous object elegant crocket spire beautiful church stand high invite dismay come save air danger water wonder sufferer watch sunrise long ridge church roof window spire 
34,"One of the most curious sights was the fleets of haystacks that were sailing along in the courses of the currents.  As the smaller stacks were sometimes shot forward rapidly, and whirled round by an eddy, while a large stately stack followed forwards, performing the same turns of the voyage, Mildred compared them to a duck and her ducklings in the pond, and Oliver to a great ship voyaging with a fleet of small craft. They saw sights far more sorrowful than this.  They grieved over the fine large trees--some in full leaf--that they saw tumbling about in the torrents which cut through the stiller waters; but it was yet worse to see dead cows, horses, pigs, and sheep carried past--some directly through the garden, or over the spot where the mill had stood.  There were also thatched roofs carried away entire; and many a chest, chair, and cow-rack--showing the destruction that had gone on during the night. While the distant scene was all bright and lovely in the sunrise, these nearer objects, thickly strewn in the muddy waters, were ugly and dismal; and Oliver saw that it did him and his sister no good to watch them.  He started, and said they must not be idle any longer.",curious sight fleet haystack sail course current small stack shoot whirl eddy large stately stack follow forward perform same turn voyage compare duck duckling pond great ship voyage fleet small craft see sight sorrowful grieve fine large tree full leaf see tumble torrent cut stiller water bad see dead cow horse pig sheep carry garden spot mill stand be thatch roof carry entire many chest chair cow rack show destruction go night distant scene bright lovely sunrise nearer object strewn muddy water ugly dismal see do sister good watch start say idle 
35,"Just then Ailwin called from the stairs,--",call stair

37,"""I am afraid it was only George,"" said Mildred.  ""He was lowing like the cow, a minute ago.""",afraid say low cow minute 
38,"""That might be because he heard the real cow,"" cried Oliver, with new hope.  ""I had rather save the cow than anything.  I will see if I cannot get into one of the upper rooms that looks towards the yard.  We might have a bridge-rope from more windows than one.  Where is Roger?  What is he fit for?  Is he awake?""",hear real cow cry new hope save cow see get upper room look yard have bridge rope more window fit awake 
39,"""Awake!  Yes, indeed,"" whispered Ailwin, coming close up to the children.  ""There is more mischief about that boy than you think for. He is now on the stairs, with more mice, and rats, and spiders, and creeping things about him than I ever saw before in all my days.  We are like to be devoured as we stand on our feet; to say nothing of what is to become of us if we lie down.""",awake whisper come child be more mischief boy think stair more mouse rat spider creep thing see day devoure stand foot say become lie 
40,Mildred looked at her brother in great terror.,look brother great terror 
41,"""We must get rid of them, if they really do us hurt,"" said Oliver, decidedly, though with an anxious look.  ""We must drown them, if they are mischievous.  We can do that, you know--at least with the larger things.  They cannot get away from us.""",get rid do hurt say anxious look drown mischievous do know least large thing get 
42,"""Drown away!"" said Ailwin, mysteriously.  ""Drown away!  The more you drown the more will come up.  Why, did you never hear of the plagues of Egypt?""",drow say drow more drown more come hear plague 
43,"""Yes, to be sure.  What then?""",sure

45,"Mildred's eyes were on her brother's face as he stood where Ailwin desired him, watching Roger.  After looking very thoughtful for some moments, he turned and exclaimed,--",eye brother face stand desire watch look thoughtful moment turn exclaim 
46,"""There is not one word of sense in it all, Mildred.  There is a wonderful number of live things there, to be sure; and here, too, all over the roof--if you look.  But Roger is not making friends with them. He is teasing them--hurting all he can get hold of.  I think the creatures have come up here because the water has driven them out of their holes; and that there would have been quite as many if Roger had been drowned in the carr.

47,"""Then I wish Ailwin would not say such things,"" replied Mildred.",wish say such thing reply 
48,"Ailwin persisted that time would show what Roger was--to which they all agreed.  Oliver observed that meanwhile Ailwin, who was the oldest person among them, should not try to frighten a little girl, who was the youngest of all, except George.  Ailwin said she should keep her own thoughts; though, to be sure, she need not always say what they were to everybody.",persist time show agree observe old person try frighten little girl young say keep own thought sure say

50,"""Take care!"" exclaimed Mildred, as he began to descend the stairs.  But the words were scarcely out of her mouth when her brother called to her that the water had sunk.  She ran to see, and saw, with her own eyes, that the water did not quite come up to the wet mark it had left on the wall of the stairs.  Ailwin thought but little of it--it was such a trifle; and Oliver allowed that it might be a mere accident, arising from the flood having found some new vent about the house; but still, the water had sunk; and that was a sight full of hope.",take care exclaim begin descend stair word mouth brother call water sink run see see own eye water come wet mark leave wall stair think little trifle allow mere accident arise flood find new vent house water sink sight full hope

54,"Ailwin called down-stairs to Oliver, to say that there was a washtub floating about in the room they had slept in.  If he could find it, he might row himself about in that, in the chambers, instead of always wading in the water, catching his death of cold.",call stair say be washtub float room sleep find row chamber wading water catching death cold 
55,"Oliver took the hint, and presently appeared in the tub, rowing himself with a slip of the wood he had brought over from the Red-hill.  Roger stared at him as he rowed himself out of one chamber, and opened the door of another, entering it in fine style.  Roger presently followed to see what was doing, and perhaps to try how he liked a voyage in a tub in a large chamber.",take hint appear tub row slip wood bring red hill stare row chamber open door enter fine style follow see do try like voyage tub large chamber

57,"Roger came splashing to the window to look, and jumped into the tub, making it sink a good deal; but it held both the boys very well.  Roger thought the cow very stupid that she did not get upon the great dunghill behind her, which would keep her whole body out of the water.  Oliver thought that, as the dunghill was behind her, she could not see it.  He wished he could go, and put her in mind of it.  He thought he would try to cross in the tub, if he could so connect it with the window as that it might be drawn back, in case of his being unable to pass the little current that there was between the house and the ruins of the yard-buildings--of which little remained.",come splash window look jump tub make sink good deal hold boy think cow stupid get great dunghill keep whole body water think dunghill see wish go put mind think try cross tub connect window draw case unable pass little current be house ruin yard building little remain

60,"Roger, however, chose to go.  Oliver asked him whether he could milk a cow; because some milk must be got for George, if possible.  He said, very gravely, that his poor little brother would die, he thought, if they could not get milk for him.",choose go ask milk cow milk get possible say poor little brother die think get milk 
61,"Roger laughed at the doubt whether he could milk cows.  He did it every day of his life, when fishing and fowling, with his uncle, in the carr. Oliver now guessed how it was that the milk of their good cow had sometimes unaccountably run short.  Ailwin had observed that this never happened but when the Redfurns were in the neighbourhood; and she had always insisted upon it that they had bewitched the cow.  Oliver knew that she would say so now.  He said so much, and said it so seriously, about the necessity of milk for little George, that he thought not even a Redfurn could have the heart to drink up all the milk.  He gave Roger a brown pitcher for the milk, and helped, very cleverly, to fasten the cord to the tub.  They passed the cord through the back of a heavy old-fashioned chair that stood in the room, lest any sudden pull should throw Oliver out of the window; he then established himself on the window-sill, above the water, to manage his line, and watch what Roger would do.",laugh doubt milk cow do day life fishing fowling uncle carr guess milk good cow run short observe happen neighbourhood insist bewitch cow know say say much say necessity milk little think have heart drink milk give brown pitcher milk help fast cord tub pass cord back heavy old fashioned chair stand room sudden pull throw window establish window sill water manage line watch do 
62,"Roger pulled very skilfully;--much more so, from his strength and from practice, than Oliver could have done.  He avoided logs of wood, trees, and other heavy things that floated past; and this was nearly all he did till the line had quite run out, so that he could not be carried any further down.  Then he began diligently working his way up towards the cow.  He had got half-way to his object, when he paused a moment, and then changed his course--to Oliver's surprise; for the thing which appeared to have attracted his attention was a small copper boiler. Plenty of such things swept past before, and nobody had thought of wanting them.  It was plain, however, that Roger had a fancy for this particular copper boiler; for he carefully waylaid it, and arrested it with his paddle.  Oliver then saw that some live animal leaped from the boiler into the tub.  He saw Roger seize the boiler, and take it into the tub; catch up the animal, whatever it might be, and nurse it in his arms; and then take something out of his pocket, and stoop down.  Oliver was pretty sure he was killing something with his knife.",pull strength practice do avoid log wood tree other heavy thing float do line run carry begin work way cow get half way object pause moment change course surprise thing appear attract attention small copper boiler plenty such thing sweep think want plain have fancy particular copper boiler waylaid arrest paddle see live animal leap boiler tub see seize boiler take tub catch animal nurse arm take pocket stake sure kill knife 
63,"Whatever Roger was doing he had soon done.  By this time he had again been carried down as far as the line would allow; and the additional weight he had now on board his tub made it harder work for him to paddle up again.  He did it, however, and brought his odd little boat into still water, between the dunghill and the cow.  After looking about him for a while, he threw out the boiler and the pitcher upon the dunghill, seized a pitchfork which was stuck upright in it, and, his craft being thus lightened, made for the ruins of the cart shed and stable.",do do time carry line allow additional weight board tub make hard work paddle do bring odd little boat water dunghill cow look while throw boiler pitcher dunghill seize pitchfork stick craft lighten make ruin cart shed stable 
64,"Of these buildings there remained only wrecks of the walls, and a few beams and rafters standing up in the air, or lying across each other, without any thatch to cover them.  Something must be left inside, however; for Roger was busy with his pitchfork.  This something must be valuable, too; for Roger, after carefully feeling the depth, jumped out of the tub, and went on filling it, while he stood in the water.  Oliver thought this very daring, till, glancing at the cow, he was sure he saw more of her neck and back; and examining the wall of the house, he perceived that the flood had sunk some inches since Roger began to cross.",building remain wreck wall few beam rafter stand air lie other thatch cover leave busy pitchfork valuable feel depth jump tub go fill stand water think dare glance cow sure see more neck back examine wall house perceive flood sink inch begin cross 
65,"When the tub was heaped up with what looked like wet straw, Roger pushed it before him towards the cow, carefully feeling his way, but never sinking so much as to have the water above his shoulders.",tub heap look wet straw push cow feel way sink have water shoulder 
66,"""Capital!  Now that is clever!"" said Oliver, aloud, as he sat at the window, and saw what Roger was about.  ""He is going to lift her up out of the water.  How she struggles to help herself!  She knows there is somebody caring for her; and she will do what she can for herself.""",capital clever say sit window see go lift water struggle help know be care do 
67,"This was true.  Roger thrust the straw he had brought under the cow, with his pitchfork.  He had to bring three loads before she could raise her whole body; but then she stood, poor thing!  With only her trembling legs in the water.  Roger turned her head so that she saw the dunghill just behind her, and with some encouragement, made one more vigorous scramble to reach it.  She succeeded; and Roger whipped up the pitcher, and was certainly trying to milk her.  She could not, however, be prevented from lying down.  Oliver was more angry than he had almost ever been in his life, when he saw Roger kick her repeatedly, in different parts of her body, pull her by the tail, and haul up her head with a rope he had found in the stable.  The poor cow never attempted to rise; and it was clear that she wanted comfort, and not ill-usage. Oliver determined that, when Roger came back, he would not speak a word to him.",true thrust straw bring cow pitchfork have bring load raise whole body stand poor thing tremble leg water turn head see dunghill encouragement make vigorous scramble reach succeed whip pitcher try milk prevent lie angry life see kick different part body pull tail haul head rope find stable poor cow attempt rise clear want comfort ill usage determine come speak word 
68,"Roger set about returning presently, when he found that nothing could be got from the cow.  He took his boiler on board, and pulled himself in by the line, without troubling himself to paddle.",set return find get cow take boiler board pull line trouble paddle 
69,"When he came in at the window, he threw down the pitcher, swearing at himself for the trouble he had taken about a good-for-nothing beast that had been standing starving in the water till she had not a drop of milk to give.  He looked at Oliver, as if rather surprised that he did not speak; but Oliver took no notice of him.",come window throw pitcher swear trouble take good beast stand starve water have drop milk give look surprise speak take notice 
70,"It was a hare that Roger had in his boiler,--a hare that had, no doubt, leaped into the boiler when pressed by a still more urgent danger than sailing down the stream in such a boat.  Roger had cut her throat with his pocket-knife; and there she lay in her own blood.",hare have boiler hare doubt leap boiler press urgent danger sail stream boat cut throat pocket knife lay own blood 
71,"""Don't you touch that,"" said Roger, as he landed his booty upon the window-sill.  ""If you lay a finger on that, it will be the worse for you.  They are mine--both puss and the boiler.""",touch say land booty window sill lay finger bad puss boiler 
72,"Still Oliver did not speak.  He wondered what Roger meant to do with these things, if nobody else was to touch them.",speak wonder mean do thing else touch 
73,"Roger soon made it clear what his intentions were.  He whistled to his dog, which scampered down-stairs to him from the top of the house; put dog, puss, and boiler into the clothes' basket, and pulled himself over with them to the Red-hill, taking care to carry the tinder-box with him. There he made a fire, skinned and cooked his hare, and, with his dog, made a feast of it, under a tree.",make clear intention whistle dog scamper stair top house put dog puss boiler clothes basket pull red hill take care carry tinder box make fire skinned cook hare dog make feast tree 
74,"Nobody grudged him his feast; though the children were sorry to find that any one could be so selfish.  Ailwin was glad to be rid of him, on any terms; and, as soon as Oliver was sure that he was occupied for some time to come, so that he would not be returning to make mischief, he resolved to go over to the cow, and give her something better than kicks;--food, if, as he thought, he could procure some.  Saying nothing to any one, he tied the tub-line to a bed-post, as being more trustworthy still than the heavy chair, and carried with him the great knife that the meat had been cut with the evening before.  He made for the stable first, and joined the rope he knew to be there to his line, so as to make it twice the length it was before.  He could now reach the field behind the stable, where the corn, just turning from green to yellow, had been standing high at this hour yesterday.  He had to paddle very carefully here, lest his tub should be knocked to pieces against the stone wall.  But the wall, though not altogether thrown down, had so many breaches made in it, that he found himself in the field, without exactly knowing whether he had come through the gate-posts or through the wall.  He lost no time in digging with his paddle; and, as he had hoped, he turned up ears of corn from under the water, which he could catch hold of, a handful at a time, and cut off with his knife.  It was very tiresome, slow work; and sometimes he was near losing his paddle, and sometimes his knife.  He persevered, however: now resting for a minute or two, and then eating a few of the ears, and thinking that only very hungry people could swallow them, soaked as they were with bad water.  He ate more than he would have done, remembering that the more he took now, the less he should want of the portion he meant to carry to the house, when he should have fed the cow.  He hoped they should obtain some better food; but, if no flour was to be had, and no other vegetable than this, it would be better than none.",grudge feast child sorry find one selfish glad rid term sure occupy time come return make mischief resolve go cow give good kick food think procure say one tie tub line bed post trustworthy heavy chair carry great knife meat cut evening make stable first join rope know line make length reach field stable corn turn green yellow stand high hour yesterday have paddle tub knock piece stone wall wall throw have many breach make find field know come gate post wall lose time digg paddle hope turn ear corn water catch hold handful time cut knife tiresome slow work lose paddle knife persever rest minute eat few ear think hungry person swallow soak bad water eat more do remember more take less want portion mean carry house feed cow hope obtain good food flour have other vegetable good 
75,"When he reached the cow, she devoured the heads of corn ravenously.  She could not have appeared better satisfied with the sweetest spring grass. It was a pleasure to see her eyes as she lay, receiving her food from Oliver's hand.  He emptied out all he had brought beside her, and patted her, saying he hoped she would give George some milk in the afternoon, in return for what had been done for her now.",reach cow devoure head corn appear satisfy sweetest spring grass pleasure see eye lay receive food hand empty bring patt say hope give milk afternoon return do 
76,"Oliver felt so tired and weak when he got home with his tub half full of soaked corn ears, that he felt as if he could not do anything more.  He was very near crying when he found that there was not a morsel to eat; that the very water was too bad to drink; and that there was no fire, from Roger having carried off the tinder-box.  But George was crying with hunger; and that made Oliver ashamed to do the same, and put him upon thinking what was to be done next.",feel tired weak get tub half full soak corn ear feel do more cry find be morsel eat very water bad drink be fire carry tinder box cry hunger make ashamed do same put think do 
77,"Ailwin was the only person who, being as strong as Roger could have got anything from him by force; and there was no use in asking Ailwin to cross the bridge-rope, or to do anything which would bring her nearer to the boy she feared so much.  Besides that, Roger had carried over the clothes' basket without leaving any line to pull it back by.  Oliver felt that he (if he were only a little less hungry and tired) could make the trip in a sack, or a tub, or even a kettle; but a tall woman like Ailwin could cross in nothing smaller than the missing clothes' basket. It was clear that Oliver alone could go; and that he must go for the tinder-box before any comfort was to be had.",only person strong get force be use ask cross bridge rope do bring boy fear carry clothes basket leave line pull feel little hungry tired make trip sack tub kettle tall woman cross small missing clothes basket clear go go tinder box comfort have 
78,"He made up his mind to this, therefore; and having, with Ailwin's help, slung the useful tub upon the bridge-rope, so that he might start the first moment that Roger should be out of sight or asleep, he rested himself in the window, watching what passed on the Red-hill.  He observed that Roger seemed quite secure that no one could follow him, as he had carried off the basket.  There he lay, near the fire, eating the meat he had broiled, and playing with his dog.  It seemed to the hungry watchers as if he meant to lie there all day.  After awhile, however, he rose, and sauntered towards the trees, among which he disappeared, as if going to the other side of the hill, to play, or to set his dog upon game.",make mind have help sling useful tub bridge rope start first moment sight asleep rest window watch pass red observe seem secure follow carry basket lay fire eat meat broil play dog seem hungry watcher mean lie day rise saunter tree disappear go other side hill play set dog game 
79,"Oliver was off, sliding along the bridge-rope in his tub.  He did not forget to carry the line with which to bring back the basket.  It seemed to him that Roger intended to live by himself on the Red-hill; and to this none of the party had any objection.  He had swum over to the house once, when the stream was higher and more rapid than now; and he could come again, if he found himself really in want of anything; so that nobody need be anxious for him.  Meantime, no one at the house desired his company.  Oliver therefore took with him a blanket and a rug, and a knife and fork for his accommodation.",slide bridge rope tub forget carry line bring basket seem intend live red hill party have objection swum house stream high rapid come find want anxious house desire company take blanket rug knife fork accommodation 
80,"He alighted under the beech without difficulty, and laid down the articles he brought under the tree, where Roger would be sure to see them.  He took the flint and the tinder from the tinder-box, and pocketed them, leaving the steel and the box for Roger's use, as there were knives at home, and Roger might perhaps find a flint on the hill. There were plenty in the quarry.  Oliver knew he must be quick; but he could not help looking round for something to eat,--some one of the many animals and birds that he knew to be on the hill, and heard moving about him on every side.  But he had no means of catching any.  The bones of the hare were lying about, picked quite clean by the dog; but not a morsel of meat was left in sight.",alight beech difficulty lay article bring tree sure see take flint tinder tinder box pocket leave steel box use be knife home find flint hill be plenty quarry know quick help look eat many animal bird know hill hear move side have means catching bone hare lie pick clean dog morsel meat leave sight 
81,"Something very precious, however, caught Oliver's eye;--a great heap of pebbly gravel thrown up by the flood.  The water in the Levels was usually so bad that the settlers had to filter it; and Oliver knew that no water was purer than that which had been filtered through gravel.  He believed now that poor George could have a good drink of water, at least; and he scooped up with his hands enough gravel to half fill the tub.  It took a long time to heap up as much as he could carry upon the rug; and then it was hard work to empty it into the tub; and he fancied every moment that he heard Roger coming.  It was a pity he did not know that Roger had fallen fast asleep in the sun, on the other side of the hill; and that his dog lay winking beside him, not thinking of stirring.",precious catch eye great heap pebbly gravel throw flood water bad settler have filter know water purer filter gravel believe poor have good drink water least scoop hand enough gravel half fill tub take long time heap much carry rug hard work empty tub fancy moment hear come pity know fall sun other side hill dog lay wink think stir 
82,"One thing more must be had;--chips for fuel.  When Oliver had got enough of these, and of sticks too, he found courage and strength to stay a few minutes more, to make up such a fire for Roger as would probably last till after he should have discovered the loss of the flint, and so prevent his being without fire till he could find another flint.  In order to give him a broad hint, Oliver spread out the blanket on the ground, and set the tinder-box in the middle of it, where it would be sure to invite attention.  He then climbed into the tub, and was glad to be off, drawing the basket with the fire-wood after him.",thing more have chip fuel get enough stick find courage strength stay few minute make fire last discover loss flint prevent fire find flint order give broad hint spread blanket ground set tinder box middle sure invite attention climb tub glad draw basket fire wood

89,"And the good-natured woman carried him up to the roof, and laid him down on a bundle of bedding there, promising to bring him breakfast presently.  She threw an apron over his head, to cover it from the hot sun, and bade him lie still, and not think of anything till she came.",good natured woman carry roof lay bundle bedding promise bring breakfast throw apron head cover hot sun bid lie think come

94,"He tried to rouse himself, and sat up; but his eyes were so dim, and the light so dazzling, that he could not see, at first, what Mildred had in her hands.  It was one of her mother's best china plates,--one of the set that was kept in a closet up-stairs; and upon it was a nice brown toasted fish, steaming hot.",try rouse sit eye dim light dazzling see have hand mother good china plate set keep closet stair nice brown toast fish steam hot

96,"""Yes, indeed, for who but you?"" said Ailwin, whose smiling face popped up from the stairs.  ""Who deserves it, if you do not, I should like to know?  It is not so good as I could have wished, though, Oliver.  I could not broil it, for want of butter and everything; and we have no salt, you know.  But, come!  Eat it, such as it is.

100,"""All this time!"" exclaimed Mildred.  ""Why, you have been asleep only half an hour; hardly so much.

And if you will come down, you will find that there is scarcely any water in the upper rooms now. Geordie might play at paddling there, as he is so fond of doing in his tub.

110,"Oliver ran down, and convinced himself that the flood was abating fast. It must have swelled up higher within the house than outside; for it had sunk three feet in the upper rooms, and two on the outer walls of the house.  Now that the worst of the danger seemed to be past, the children worked with fresh spirit, making all possible use of the sunshine for drying their bedding and clothes, in hopes of sleeping in a chamber this night, instead of on the house-top, which they had feared would be necessary.  Nothing could have made them believe, if they had been told at sunrise, how cheerfully they would sit down, in the afternoon, to rest and talk, and hope that they might, after all, meet their father and mother again soon, alive and well.",run convince flood abate swell high house sink foot upper room outer wall house bad danger seem past child work fresh spirit make possible use sunshine drying bedding clothes hope sleep chamber night house top fear necessary make believe tell sunrise sit afternoon rest talk hope meet father mother alive
