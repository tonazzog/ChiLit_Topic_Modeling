14,"""What nonsense! and all because I don't admire those nasty red-jelly things, which one may see on the shore by thousands any day. What a little goose you are, Vernon!""",nonsense admire nasty red jelly thing see shore thousand day little goose 
15,"Vernon made no reply, but was putting away his sea-anemones with a sigh, when in came Russell to fetch Eric to the cricket.",make reply put sea anemone sigh come fetch cricket 
16,"""Well, Verny,"" he said, ""have you been getting those pretty sea-anemones? come here and show me them. Ah, I declare you've got one of those famous white plumosa fellows among them.

20,"""And have you had a pleasant morning?""",have pleasant morning 
21,"""Yes, Russell, thank you. Only it is rather dull being always by myself, and Eric never comes with me now.""",thank dull come 
22,"""Naughty Eric,"" said Russell, playfully. ""Never mind, Verny; you and I will cut him, and go by ourselves.""",naughty say mind cut go 
23,"Eric had stood by during the conversation, and the contrast of Russel's unselfish kindness with his own harsh want of sympathy, struck him. He threw his arms round his brother's neck, and said, ""We will both go with you, Verny, next half holiday.""",stand conversation contrast unselfish kindness own harsh want sympathy strike throw arm brother neck say go next half holiday 
24,"""O, thank you, Eric,"" said his brother; and the two schoolboys ran out. But when the next half holiday came, warm and bright, with the promise of a good match that afternoon, Eric repented his promise, and left Russell to amuse his little brother, while he went off, as usual, to the playground.",thank say brother schoolboy run next half holiday come warm bright promise good match afternoon repent promise leave amuse little brother go usual playground 
25,"There was one silent witness of scenes like these, who laid them up deeply in her heart. Mrs. Williams was not unobservant of the gradual but steady falling off in Eric's character, and the first thing she noticed was the blunting of his home affections. When they first came to Roslyn, the boy used constantly to join his father and mother in their walks; but now he went seldom or never; and even if he did go, he seemed ashamed, while with them, to meet any of his schoolfellows. The spirit of false independence was awake and growing in her darling son. The bright afternoons they had spent together on the sunny shore, or seeking for sea-flowers among the lonely rocks of the neighboring headlands,--the walks at evening and sunset among the hills, and the sweet counsel they had together, when the boy's character opened like a flower in the light and warmth of his mother's love,--the long twilights when he would sit on a stool with his young head resting on her knees, and her loving hand among his fair hair,--all these things were becoming to Mrs. Williams memories, and nothing more.",be silent witness scene lay heart unobservant gradual steady falling character first thing notice blunting home affection come boy use join father mother walk go go seem ashamed meet schoolfellow spirit false independence awake grow darling son bright afternoon spend sunny shore seek sea flower lonely rock neighbor headland walk evening sunset hill sweet counsel have boy character open flower light warmth mother love long twilight sit stool young head rest knee loving hand fair hair thing become memory more 
26,"It was the trial of her life, and very sad to bear; the more so because they were soon to be parted, certainly for years, perhaps for ever. The time was drawing nearer and nearer; it was now June, and Mr. Williams' term of furlough ended in two months. The holidays at Roslyn were the months of July and August, and towards their close Mr. and Mrs. Williams intended to leave Vernon at Fairholm, and start for India--sending back Eric by himself as a boarder in Dr. Rowlands' house.",trial life sad bear part year time draw nearer term furlough end month holiday month close intend leave start send border house 
27,"After morning school, on fine days, the boys used to run straight down to the shore and bathe. A bright and joyous scene it was. They stripped off their clothes on the shingle that adjoined the beach, and then running along the sands, would swim out far into the bay till their heads looked like small dots glancing in the sunshine. This year Eric had learned to swim, and he enjoyed the bathing more than any other pleasure.",morning school fine day boy use run shore bathe bright joyous scene stripp clothes shingle adjoin beach run sand swim bay head look small dot glance sunshine year learn swim enjoy bathing more other pleasure 
28,"One day after they had dressed, Russell and he began to amuse themselves on the sea-shore. The little translucent pools left on the sands by the ebbing tide always swarm with life, and the two boys found great fun in hunting audacious little crabs, or catching the shrimps that shuffled about in the shallow water. At last Eric picked up a piece of wood which he found lying on the beach, and said, ""What do you say to coming crabfishing, Edwin? this bit of stick will do capitally to thrust between the rocks in the holes where they lie?""",day dress begin amuse sea shore little translucent pool leave sand ebbing tide swarm life boy find great fun hunt audacious little crab catching shrimp shuffle shallow water last pick piece wood find lie beach say say come crabfish bit stick do thrust rock hole lie 
29,"Russell agreed, and they started to the rocks of the Ness to seek a likely place for their purpose. The Ness was a mile off, but in the excitement of their pleasure they were oblivious of time.",agree start rock seek likely place purpose mile excitement pleasure oblivious time 
30,"The Williams', for the boys' convenience, usually dined at one, but on this day they waited half an hour for Eric. Since, however, he didn't appear, they dined without him, supposing that he was accidentally detained, and expecting him to come in every minute. But two o'clock came, and no Eric; half-past two, and no Eric; three, but still no Eric. Mrs. Williams became seriously alarmed, and even her husband grew uneasy.",boy convenience dine day wait hour appear dine suppose detain expect come minute o'clock come half past become alarmed husband grow uneasy 
31,"Vernon was watching for his brother at the window, and seeing Duncan pass by, ran down to ask him, ""If he knew where Eric was?""",watch brother window see pass run ask know 
32,"""No,"" said Duncan; ""last time I saw him was on the shore. We bathed together, and I remember his clothes were lying by mine when I dressed. But I hav'n't seen him since. If you like we'll go and look for him. I daresay he's on the beach somewhere.""",say last time see shore bath remember clothes lie dress see like go look daresay beach 
33,"But they found no traces of him there; and when they returned with this intelligence, his mother got so agitated that it required all her husband's firm gentleness to support her sinking spirits. There was enough to cause anxiety, for Vernon repeatedly ran out to ask the boys who were passing if they had seen his brother, and the answer always was, that they had left him bathing in the sea.",find trace return intelligence mother get agitated require husband firm gentleness support sink spirit be enough cause anxiety run ask boy pass see brother answer leave bathing sea 
34,"Meanwhile our young friends, having caught several crabs, suddenly noticed by the sun that it was getting late.",young friend catch several crab notice sun get late 
35,"""Good gracious, Edwin,"" said Eric, pulling out his watch, ""it's half-past three; what have we been thinking of? How frightened they'll be at home;"" and running back as fast as they could, they reached the house at five o'clock, and rushed into the room.",good gracious say pull watch half past think frighten home run reach house o'clock rush room 
36,"""Eric, Eric,"" said Mrs. Williams faintly, ""where have you been? has anything happened to you, my child?""",say happen child 
37,"""No, mother, nothing. I've only been crabfishing with Russell, and we forgot the time.""",mother crabfish forget time 
38,"""Thoughtless boy,"" said his father, ""your mother has been in an agony about you.""",thoughtless boy say father mother agony 
39,"Eric saw her pale face and tearful eyes, and flung himself in her arms, and mother and son wept in a long embrace. ""Only two months,"" whispered Mrs. Williams, ""and we shall leave you, dear boy, perhaps forever. O do not forget your love for us in the midst of new companions.""",see pale face tearful eye flung arm mother son goot long embrace month whisper leave dear boy forget love midst new companion 
40,"The end of term arrived; this time Eric came out eighth only instead of first, and, therefore, on the prize day, was obliged to sit among the crowd of undistinguished boys. He saw that his parents were disappointed, and his own ambition was grievously mortified. But he had full confidence in his own powers, and made the strongest resolutions to work hard the next half-year, when he had got out of ""that Gordon's"" clutches.",end term arrive time come eighth prize day oblige sit crowd undistinguished boy see parent disappoint own ambition mortify have full confidence own power make strong resolution work next half year get clutch 
41,"The Williams' spent the holidays at Fairholm, and now, indeed, in the prospect of losing them, Eric's feelings to his parents came out in all their strength. Most happily the days glided by, and the father and mother used them wisely. All their gentle influence, all their deep affection, were employed in leaving on the boy's heart lasting impressions of godliness and truth. He learnt to feel that their love would encircle him for ever with its heavenly tenderness, and their pure prayers rise for him night and day to the throne of God.",spend holiday prospect lose feeling parent come strength day glide father mother use gentle influence deep affection employ leave boy heart last impression godliness truth learn feel love encircle heavenly tenderness pure prayer rise night day throne 
42,"The day of parting came, and most bitter and heartrending it was. In the wildness of their passionate sorrow, Eric and Vernon seemed to hear the sound of everlasting farewells. It is God's mercy that ordains how seldom young hearts have to endure such misery.",day parting come bitter heartrending wildness passionate sorrow seem hear sound everlasting farewell mercy ordain young heart have endure such misery 
43,"At length it was over. The last sound of wheels had died away; and during those hours the hearts of parents and children felt the bitterness of death. Mrs. Trevor and Fanny, themselves filled with grief, still used all their unselfish endeavors to comfort their dear boys. Vernon, weary of crying, soon sank to sleep; but not so Eric. He sat on a low stool, his face buried in his hands, breaking the stillness every now and then with his convulsive sobs.",length last sound wheel die hour heart parent child feel bitterness death fill grief use unselfish endeavor comfort dear boy weary cry sink sleep sit low stool face bury hand break stillness convulsive sob 
44,"""O Aunty,"" he cried, ""do you think I shall ever see them again? I have been so wicked, and so little grateful for all their love. O, I wish I had thought at Roslyn how soon I was to lose them.""",cry think see wicked little grateful love wish think lose 
45,"""Yes, dearest,"" said Mrs. Trevor, ""I have no doubt we shall all meet again soon. Your father is only going for five years, you know, and that will not seem very long. And then they will be writing continually to us, and we to them. Think, Eric, how gladdened their hearts will be to hear that you and Vernon are good boys, and getting on well.""",say have doubt meet father go year know seem long write think gladden heart hear good boy get 
46,"""O, I _will_ be a better boy, I _will_ indeed,"" said Eric; ""I mean to do great things, and they shall have nothing but good reports of me.""",good boy _will say mean do great thing have good report 
47,"""God helping you, dear,"" said his aunt, pushing back his hair from his forehead, and kissing it softly; ""without his help, Eric, we are all weak indeed.""",help dear say aunt push hair forehead kiss help weak
