1,CHAPTER III. BULLYING,bullying 
2,"""Give to the morn of life its natural blessedness."" Wordsworth.",give morn life natural blessedness 
3,"Why is it that new boys are almost invariably ill-treated? I have often fancied that there must be in boyhood a pseudo-instinctive cruelty, a sort of ""wild trick of the ancestral savage,"" which, no amount of civilization can entirely repress. Certain it is, that to most boys the first term is a trying ordeal. They are being tested and weighed. Their place in the general estimation is not yet fixed, and the slightest circumstances are seized upon to settle the category under which the boy is to be classed. A few apparently trivial accidents of his first few weeks at school often decide his position in the general regard for the remainder of his boyhood. And yet these are _not_ accidents; they are the slight indications which give an unerring proof of the general tendencies of his character and training. Hence much of the apparent cruelty with which new boys are treated is not exactly intentional. At first, of course, as they can have no friends worth speaking of, there are always plenty of coarse and brutal minds that take a pleasure in their torment, particularly if they at once recognise any innate superiority to themselves. Of this class was Barker. He hated Eric at first sight, simply because his feeble mind could only realise one idea about him, and that was the new boy's striking contrast with his own imperfections. Hence he left no means untried to vent on Eric his low and mean jealousy. He showed undisguised pleasure when he fell in form, and signs of disgust when he rose; he fomented every little source of disapproval or quarrelling which happened to arise against him; he never looked at him without a frown or a sneer; he waited for him to kick and annoy him as he came out of, or went into, the school-room. In fact, he did his very best to make the boy's life miserable, and the occupation of hating him seemed in some measure to fill up the vacuity of an ill-conditioned and degraded mind.",new boy ill treat fancy be boyhood pseudo instinctive cruelty sort wild trick ancestral savage amount civilization repress certain most boy first term try ordeal test weigh place general estimation fix slight circumstance seize settle category boy class few trivial accident first few week school decide position general regard remainder boyhood _not_ accident slight indication give unerr proof general tendency character training much apparent cruelty new boy treat intentional first course have friend worth speak be plenty coarse brutal mind take pleasure torment recognise innate superiority class hate first sight feeble mind realise idea new boy strike contrast own imperfection leave means untried vent low mean jealousy show undisguised pleasure fall form sign disgust rise foment little source disapproval quarrelling happen arise look frown sneer wait kick annoy come go school room fact do very good make boy life miserable occupation hate seem measure fill vacuity ill condition degrade mind 
4,"Hatred is a most mysterious and painful phenomenon to the unhappy person who is the object of it, and more especially if he have incurred it by no one assignable reason. To Eric it was peculiarly painful; he was utterly unprepared for it. In his bright joyous life at Fairholm, in the little he saw of the boys at the Latin school, he had met with nothing but kindness and caresses, and the generous nobleness of his character had seemed to claim them as a natural element. ""And now, why,"" he asked impatiently, ""should this bull-dog sort of fellow have set his whole aim to annoy, vex, and hurt me?"" Incapable himself of so mean a spirit of jealousy at superior excellence, he could not make it out; but such, was the fact, and the very mysteriousness of it made it more intolerable to bear.",hatred mysterious painful phenomenon unhappy person object incur assignable reason painful unprepared bright joyous life little see boy latin school meet kindness caresse generous nobleness character seem claim natural element ask bull dog sort fellow set whole aim annoy vex hurt incapable mean spirit jealousy superior excellence make such fact very mysteriousness make intolerable bear 
5,"But it must be admitted that he made matters worse by his own bursts of passion. His was not the temper to turn the other cheek; but, brave and spirited as he was, he felt how utterly hopeless would be any attempt on his part to repel force by force. He would have tried some slight conciliation, but it was really impossible with such a boy as his enemy. Barker never gave him even so much as an indifferent look, much less a civil word. Eric loathed him, and the only good and happy part of the matter to his own mind was, that conscientiously his only desire was to get rid of him and be left alone, while he never cherished a particle of revenge.",admit make matter bad own burst passion temper turn other cheek brave spirit feel hopeless attempt part repel force force try slight conciliation impossible boy enemy give much indifferent look civil word loath only good happy part matter own mind only desire get rid leave alone cherish particle revenge 
6,"While every day Eric was getting on better in form, and winning himself a very good position with the other boys, who liked his frankness, his mirth, his spirit, and cleverness, he felt this feud with Barker like a dark background to all his enjoyment. He even had to manoeuvre daily how to escape him, and violent scenes were of constant occurrence between them. Eric could not, and would not, brook his bullying with silence. His resentment was loud and stinging, and, Ishmaelite as Barker was, even _his_ phlegmatic temperament took fire when Eric shouted his fierce and uncompromising retorts in the hearing of the others.",day get good form win good position other boy like frankness mirth spirit cleverness feel feud dark background enjoyment have manoeuvre escape violent scene constant occurrence briok bullying silence resentment loud sting phlegmatic temperament take fire shout fierce uncompromising retort hearing other 
7,"Meanwhile Eric was on the best of terms with the rest of the form, and such of the other boys as he knew, although, at first, his position as a home-boarder prevented his knowing many. Besides Russell, there were three whom he liked best, and respected most--Duncan, Montagu, and Owen. They were very different boys, but all of them had qualities which well deserved his esteem. Duncan was the most boyish of boys, intensely full of fun, good-nature, and vigor; with fair abilities, he never got on well, because he could not be still for two minutes, and even if, in some fit of sudden ambition, he got up high in the form, he was sure to be put to the bottom again before the day was over, for trifling or talking. But out of school he was the soul of every game; whatever _he_ took up was sure to be done pleasantly, and no party of amusement was ever planned without endeavoring to secure him as one of the number.",good term rest form such other boy know first position home border prevent know many be like good respect most different boy have quality deserve esteem boyish boy full fun good nature vigor fair ability get minute fit sudden ambition get high form sure put bottom day trifl talk school soul game take sure do party amusement plan endeavor secure number 
8,"Montagu's chief merit was, that he was such a thorough little gentleman; ""such a jolly little fellow"" every one said of him. Without being clever or athletic, he managed to do very fairly both at work and at the games, and while he was too exclusive to make many _intimate_ friends, everybody liked walking about or talking with him. Even Barker, blackguard as he was, seemed to be a little uneasy when confronted with Montagu's naturally noble and chivalrous bearing. In nearly all respects his influence was thoroughly good, and few boys were more generally popular.",chief merit thorough little gentleman jolly little fellow one say clever athletic manage do work game exclusive make many _intimate_ friend like walk talk blackguard seem little uneasy confront noble chivalrous bear respect influence good few boy popular 
9,"Owen, again, was a very different boy. His merit was a ceaseless diligence, in which it was doubtful whether ambition or conscientiousness had the greatest share. Reserved and thoughtful, unfitted for or indifferent to most games, he was anything but a favorite with the rest, and Eric rather respected than liked him. When he first came, he had been one of the most natural butts for Barker's craving ill-nature, and for a time he had been tremendously bullied. But gradually his mental superiority asserted itself. He took everything without tears and without passion, and this diminished the pleasure of annoying him. One day when Barker had given him an unprovoked kick, he quietly said,",different boy merit ceaseless diligence doubtful ambition conscientiousness have great share reserve thoughtful unfitted indifferent most game favorite rest respect like come natural butt craving ill nature time bull mental superiority assert take tear passion diminish pleasure annoy day give unprovoked kick say 
10,"""Barker, next time you do that, I'll tell Mr. Gordon.""",next time do tell 
11,"""Sneak! do it if you dare."" And he kicked him again; but the moment after he was sorry for it, for there was a dark look in Owen's eyes, as he turned instantly into the door of the master's room, and laid a formal complaint against Barker for bullying.",sneak do dare kick moment sorry be dark look eye turn door master room lay formal complaint bullying 
12,"Mr. Gordon didn't like ""telling,"" and he said so to Owen, without reserve. An ordinary boy would have broken into a flood of explanations and palliations, but Owen simply bowed, and said nothing. ""He stood there for justice,"" and he had counted the cost. Strong-minded and clear-headed, he calculated correctly that the momentary dislike of his schoolfellows, with whom he well knew that he never could be popular, would be less unbearable than Barker's villanous insults. The consequence was that Barker was caned soundly, although, with some injustice, Mr. Gordon made no attempt to conceal that he did it unwillingly.",like tell say reserve ordinary boy break flood explanation palliation bow say stand justice count cost strong minded clear head calculate momentary dislike schoolfellow know popular unbearable villanous insult consequence cane injustice make attempt conceal do 
13,"Of course the fellows were very indignant with Owen for sneaking, as they called it, and for a week or two he had the keen mortification of seeing ""Owen is a sneak,"" written up all about the walls. But he was too proud or too cold to make any defence till called upon, and bore it in silence. Barker vowed eternal vengeance, and the very day after, had seized Owen with the avowed intention of ""half murdering him."" But before he could once strike him, Owen said in the most chill tone, ""Barker, if you touch me, I shall go straight to Dr. Rowlands."" The bully well knew that Owen never broke his word, but he could not govern his rage, and first giving Owen a violent shake, he proceeded to thrash him without limit or remorse.",course fellow indignant sneak call week have keen mortification see sneak write wall proud cold make defence call bear silence vow eternal vengeance very day seize avowed intention half murdering strike say chill tone touch go bully know break word govern rage give violent shake proceed thrash limit remorse 
14,"Pale, but unmoved, Owen got away, and walked straight to Dr. Rowlands' door. The thing was unheard of, and the boys were amazed at his temerity, for the doctor was to all their imaginations a regular _Deus ex machinâ._ That afternoon, again Barker was publicly caned, with the threat that the next offence would be followed by instant and public expulsion. This punishment he particularly dreaded, because he was intended for the army, and he well knew that it might ruin his prospects. The consequence was, that Owen never suffered from him again, although he daily received a shower of oaths and curses, which he passed over with silent contempt.",pale unmoved get walk door thing unheard boy amaze temerity doctor imagination regular afternoon cane threat next offence follow instant public expulsion punishment dread intend army know ruin prospect consequence suffer receive shower oath curse pass silent contempt 
15,"My dear boy-reader, don't suppose that I want you to imitate Owen in this matter. I despise a boy who ""tells"" as much as you do, and it is a far better and braver thing to bear bullying with such a mixture of spirit and good humor, as in time to disarm it. But Owen was a peculiar boy, and remember he had _no_ redress. He bore for a time, until he felt that he _must_ have the justice and defence, without which it would have been impossible for him to continue at Roslyn school.",dear boy reader suppose want imitate matter despise boy tell much do good brave thing bear bullying mixture spirit good humor time disarm peculiar boy remember have redress bear time feel _must_ have justice defence impossible continue school 
16,"But why, you ask, didn't he tell the monitors? Unfortunately at Roslyn the monitorial system was not established. Although it was a school of 250 boys, the sixth form, with all their privileges, had no prerogative of authority. They hadn't the least right to interfere, because no such power had been delegated to them, and therefore they felt themselves merely on a par with the rest, except for such eminence as their intellectual superiority gave them. The consequence was, that any interference from them would have been of a simply individual nature, and was exerted very rarely. It would have done Owen no more good to tell a sixth-form boy, than to tell any other boy; and as he was not a favorite, he was not likely to find any champion to fight his battles or maintain his just rights.",ask tell monitor monitorial system establish school boy sixth form privilege have prerogative authority have least right interfere such power delegate feel par rest such eminence intellectual superiority give consequence interference individual nature exert do good tell sixth form boy tell other boy favorite likely find champion fight battle maintain right 
17,"All this had happened before Eric's time, and he heard it from his best friend Russell. His heart clave to that boy. They became friends at once by a kind of electric sympathy; the first glance of each at the other's face prepared the friendship, and every day of acquaintance more firmly cemented it. Eric could not have had a better friend; not so clever as himself, not so diligent as Owen, not so athletic as Duncan, or so fascinating as Montagu, Russell combined the best qualities of them all. And, above all, he acted invariably from the highest principle; he presented that noblest of all noble spectacles--one so rare that many think it impossible--the spectacle of an honorable, pure-hearted, happy boy, who, as his early years speed by, is ever growing in wisdom, and stature, and favor with God and man.",happen time hear good friend heart clave boy become friend kind electric sympathy first glance other face prepare friendship day acquaintance cement have good friend clever diligent athletic fascinating combine good quality act high principle present noblest noble spectacle rare many think impossible spectacle honorable pure hearted happy boy early year speed grow wisdom stature favor man 
18,"""Did that brute Barker ever bully you as he bullies me?"" said Eric, one day, as he walked on the sea-shore with his friend.",brute bully bully say day walk sea shore friend 
19,"""Yes,"" said Russell; ""I slept in his dormitory when I first came, and he has often made me so wretched that I have flung myself on my knees at night in pretence of prayer, but really to get a little quiet time to cry like a child.""",say sleep dormitory come make wretched flung knee night pretence prayer get little quiet time cry child 
20,"""And when was it he left off at last?""",leave last 
21,"""Why, you know, Upton in the fifth is my cousin, and very fond of me; he heard of it, though I didn't say anything about it, and told Barker that if ever he caught him at it, he would thrash him within an inch of his life; and that frightened him for one thing. Besides, Duncan, Montagu, and other friends of mine began to cut him in consequence, so he thought it best to leave off.""",know fifth cousin fond hear say tell catch thrash inch life frighten thing other friend begin cut consequence think good leave 
22,"""How is it, Russell, that fellows stand by and let him do it?""",fellow stand let do 
23,"""You see, Williams,"" said Russell, ""Barker is an enormously strong fellow, and that makes the younger chaps, whom he fags, look up to him as a great hero. And there isn't one in our part of the school who can thrash him. Besides, people never do interfere, you know--at least not often. I remember once seeing a street-row in London, at which twenty people stood by, and let a drunken beast of a husband strike his wife without ever stirring to defend her.""",see say strong fellow make young chap fag look great hero be one part school thrash person interfere know least remember see street row person stand let drunken beast husband strike wife stir defend 
24,"""Well,"" sighed Eric, ""I hope my day of deliverance will come soon, for I can't stand it much longer, and 'tell' I won't, whatever Owen may do.""",sigh hope day deliverance come stand tell do 
25,"Eric's deliverance came very soon. It was afternoon; the boys were playing at different games in the green playground, and he was waiting for his turn at rounders. At this moment Barker lounged up, and calmly snatching off Eric's cap, shied it over Dr. Rowlands' garden wall. ""There, go and fetch that.""",deliverance come afternoon boy play different game green playground wait turn rounder moment lounge snatch cap shie garden wall go fetch 
26,"""You blackguard!"" said Eric, standing irresolutely for a few minutes; and then with tears in his eyes began to climb the wall. It was not very high, but boys were peremptorily forbidden to get over it under any circumstances, and Eric broke the rule not without trepidation. However, he dropped down on one of Mrs. Rowlands' flower-beds, and got his cap in a hurry, and clambered back undiscovered.",blackguard say stand few minute tear eye begin climb wall high boy forbidden get circumstance break rule trepidation drop flower bed get cap hurry clamber undiscovered 
27,"He thought this would have satisfied his tormentor for one day; but Barker was in a mischievous mood, so he again came up to Eric, and calling out, ""Who'll have a game at football?"" again snatched the cap, and gave it a kick; Eric tried to recover it, but every time he came up Barker gave it a fresh kick, and finally kicked it into a puddle.",think satisfy tormentor day mischievous mood come call have game football snatch cap give kick try recover time come give fresh kick kick puddle 
28,"Eric stood still, trembling with rage, while his eyes lightened scorn and indignation. ""You hulking, stupid, cowardly bully,""--here Barker seized him, and every word brought a tremendous blow on the head, but blind with passion Eric went on--""you despicable bully, I won't touch that cap again, you shall pick it up yourself. Duncan, Russell, here! do help me against this intolerable brute.""",stand tremble rage eye lighten scorn indignation hulk stupid cowardly bully seize word bring tremendous blow head blind passion go despicable bully touch cap pick help intolerable brute 
29,"Several boys ran up, but they were all weaker than Barker, who besides was now in a towering fury, and kicked Eric unmercifully.",several boy run weak besides tower fury kick 
30,"""Leave him alone,"" shouted Duncan, ""or by heaven I'll get you a sound thrashing from some fellow.""",leave shout heaven get sound thrashing fellow 
31,"""I won't; mind your own business,"" growled Barker, shaking himself free from Duncan's hand.",mind own business growl shake free hand 
32,"""Barker, I'll never speak to you again from this day,"" said Montagu, turning on his heel with a look of withering contempt.",speak day say turn heel look wither contempt 
33,"""What do I care? puppy, you want taking down too,"" was the reply, and some more kicks at Eric followed.",care puppy want take reply more kick follow 
34,"""Barker, I won't stand this any longer,"" said Russell; and seizing him by the arm, he dealt him a swinging blow on the face.",stand say seize arm deal swing blow face 
35,"The bully stood in amazement, and dropped Eric, who fell on the turf nearly fainting, and bleeding at the nose. But now Russell's turn came, and in a moment Barker, who was twice his weight, had tripped him up, when he found himself collared in an iron grasp.",bully stand amazement drop fall turf fainting bleed nose turn come moment weight trip find collare iron grasp 
36,"There had been an unobserved spectator of the whole scene, in the person of Mr. Williams himself, and it was his strong hand that now griped Barker's shoulder. He was greatly respected by the boys, who all knew his tall handsome figure by sight, and he frequently stood a quiet and pleased observer of their games. The boys in the playground came crowding round, and Barker in vain struggled to escape. Mr. Williams held him firmly, and said in a calm voice, ""I have just seen you treat one of your schoolfellows with the grossest violence. It makes me blush for you, Roslyn Boys,"" he continued, turning to the group that surrounded him, ""that you can stand by unmoved, and see such things done. You know that you despise any one who tells a master, yet you allow this bullying to go on, and that, too, without any provocation. Now, mark; it makes no difference that the boy hurt is my own son; I would have punished this scoundrel, whoever it had been, and I shall punish him now."" With these words he lifted the riding-whip which he happened to be carrying, and gave Barker one of the most satisfactory castigations he had ever undergone; the boys declared that Dr. Rowlands' ""swishings"" were nothing to it. Mr. Williams saw that the offender was a tough subject, and determined that he should not soon forget the punishment he then received. He had never heard from Eric how this boy had been treating him, but he had heard it from Russell, and now he had seen one of the worst specimens of it with his own eyes. He therefore belabored him till his sullen obstinacy gave way to a roar for mercy, and promises never so to offend again.",be unobserved spectator whole scene person strong hand gripe shoulder respect boy know tall handsome figure sight stand quiet pleased observer game boy playground come crowd vain struggle escape hold say calm voice see treat schoolfellow grossest violence make blush continue turn group surround stand unmoved see such thing do know despise one tell master allow bullying go provocation mark make difference boy hurt own son punish scoundrel punish word lift riding whip happen carry give satisfactory castigation undergone boy declare swishing see offender tough subject determine forget punishment receive hear boy treat hear see bad specimen own eye belabor sullen obstinacy give way roar mercy promise offend 
37,"At this crisis he flung the boy from him with a ""phew"" of disgust, and said, ""I give nothing for your word; but if ever you do bully in this way again, and I see or hear of it, your present punishment shall be a trifle to what I shall then administer. At present, thank me for not informing your master."" So saying, he made Barker pick up the cap, and, turning away, walked home with Eric leaning on his arm.",crisis flung boy phew disgust say give word bully way see hear present punishment trifle administer present thank inform master say make pick cap turn walk lean arm 
38,"Barker, too, carried himself off with the best grace be could; but it certainly didn't mend matters when he heard numbers of fellows, even little boys, say openly, ""I'm so glad; serves you right.""",carry good grace mend matter hear number fellow little boy say glad serve right 
39,"From that day Eric was never troubled with personal violence from Barker or any other boy. But rancor smouldered deep in the mind of the baffled tyrant, and, as we shall see hereafter, there are subtler means of making an enemy wretched than striking or kicking him.",day trouble personal violence other boy rancor smoulder mind baffle tyrant see be subtler means make enemy wretch strike kick
