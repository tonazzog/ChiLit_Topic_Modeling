2,"When Tommy was questioned on the following morning as to his inducement to get into the boat, to their great surprise he replied, that he wanted to go round to the tents again, to see if the bananas were ripe; that he intended to eat some of them and be back before dinner-time, that he might not be found out.",question follow morning inducement get boat great surprise reply want go tent see banana ripe intend eat dinner time find 
3,"""I suspect, Tommy, you would have been very hungry before you ate any bananas if we had not perceived you,"" said Ready.",suspect hungry eat banana perceive say ready 
4,"""I won't go into the boat any more,"" said Tommy.",go boat more say 
5,"""I rather think you will keep to that resolution, Tommy,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""however, I must leave your mother to point out to you the danger you were in yourself, and in which you placed others by your folly.""",think keep resolution reply leave mother point danger place other folly 
6,"The stockade was now almost finished; the door was the occasion of a good deal of consultation; at last, it was agreed that it would be better to have a door of stout oak plank, but with second door-posts inside, about a foot apart from the door, between which could be inserted short poles one above the other, so as to barricade it within when required.  This would make the door as strong as any other portion of the stockade.  As soon as this was all complete, the storehouse was to be altered for a dwelling-house, by taking away the wattles of cocoa-nut boughs on the sides, and filling them up with logs of cocoa-nut trees.",stockade finish door occasion good deal consultation last agree good have door stout oak plank second door post foot door insert short pole other barricade require make door strong other portion stockade complete storehouse alter dwelling house take wattle cocoa nut bough side fill log cocoa nut tree 
7,"Before the week was ended the stockade and door were complete, and they now began to fell trees, to form the sides of the house.  This was rapid work; and while Mr Seagrave, William, and Juno felled the trees, and brought them on the wheels to the side of the stockade, all ready cut to their proper lengths, Ready was employed in flooring the house with a part of the deal planks which they had brought round from the cove.  But this week they were obliged to break off for two days, to collect all their crops from the garden.",week end stockade door complete begin fall tree form side house rapid work fell tree bring wheel side stockade ready cut proper length ready employ flooring house part deal plank bring cove week oblige break day collect crop garden 
8,"A fortnight more passed away in continual hard work, but the house was at last finished, and very complete, compared to the one they were residing in.  It was much larger, and divided into three rooms by the deal planking: the middle room which the door opened into was the sitting and eating room, with a window behind; the two side rooms were sleeping-rooms, one for Mrs Seagrave and the children, and the other for the male portion of the family.",fortnight pass continual hard work house last finish complete compare one reside large divide room deal planking middle room door open sitting eating room window side room sleep room child other male portion family 
9,"""See, William,"" said Ready, when they were alone, ""what we have been able to do by means of those deal planks; why, to have floored this house, and run up the partitions, would have taken us half a year if we had had to saw the wood.""",see say ready alone able do means deal plank floor house run partition take year have see wood 
10,"""Yes; and what a comfort it is to have so many shelves about.  When shall we shift into this house?""",comfort have many shelf shift house

12,"""And what do you propose to do with the old house?"" said William.",propose do old house say

21,"""If at my age I did not think a little, William, it would be very odd. You don't know how anxious I am to see them all inside of this defence.""",age think little odd know anxious see defence 
22,"""But why should we not come in, Ready?""",come ready 
23,"""Why, sir, as there is still plenty of work, I do not like to press the matter, lest your mamma should be fidgeted, and think there was danger; but danger there is; I have a kind of forewarning of it.  I wish you would propose that they should come in at once; the standing-bed places are all ready, except the canvas, and I shall nail on new by to-night.""",sir be plenty work like press matter mamma fidget think be danger danger be have kind forewarning wish propose come standing bed place ready canvas nail new night 
24,"In consequence of this conversation, William proposed at dinnertime that the next day they should go into the new house, as it was so much more handy to work there and live there at the same time.  Mr Seagrave was of the same opinion, but Mrs Seagrave thought it better that everything should be tidy first.",consequence conversation propose dinnertime next day go new house handy work live same time same opinion think good tidy 
25,"""Why, ma'am,"" said Ready, ""the only way to get things tidy is to go yourself and make them so.  Nothing will ever be in its place unless you are there to put it in.""",say ready only way get thing tidy go make place put

28,"""Be it so, Ready; you are the best judge; to-morrow we will take up our quarters in the stockade.""",ready good judge take quarter stockade 
29,"""Thank God!"" muttered Ready very softly.",thank mutter ready 
30,"The next day was fully employed in changing their residence, and shifting over the bedding and utensils; and that night they slept within the stockade.  Ready had run up a very neat little outhouse of plank, as a kitchen for Juno, and another week was fully employed as follows: the stores were divided; those of least consequence, and the salt provisions, flour, and the garden produce, etcetera, were put into the old house; the casks of powder and most of the cartridges were also put there for security; but a cask of beef, of pork, and flour, all the iron-work and nails, canvas, etcetera, were stowed away for the present under the new house, which had, when built as a storehouse, been raised four feet from the ground to make a shelter for the stock.  This was very spacious, and, of course, quite dry, and contained all they wished to put in.  Ready also took care, by degrees, to fill the large water-butt full of water, and had fixed into the bottom a spigot for drawing the water off.",next day employ change residence shift bedding utensil night sleep stockade ready run neat little outhouse plank kitchen week employ follow store divide least consequence salt provision flour garden produce etcetera put old house cask powder most cartridge put security cask beef pork flour iron work nail canvas etcetera stow present new house build storehouse raise foot ground make shelter stock spacious course dry contain wish put ready take care degree fill large water butt full water fix bottom spigot draw water 
31,"""Well, Mr Seagrave,"" said Ready on the Saturday, ""we have done a good many hard weeks' work lately, but this is the last of them.  We are now comfortably settled in our new house: our stores are all under cover, and safe from the weather, and so we may now take things a little easier.  William and I must repair the boat, so that we may take a trip round to examine how the stock and yams get on.""",say ready do good many hard week work last settle new house store cover safe weather take thing little easy repair boat take trip examine stock yam get

35,"""We must put our seeds and potatoes in before the rainy season, Ready.""",put seed potato rainy season ready 
36,"""It will be better, sir, if we can find time, as we shall not have much more fine weather now; at all events, we can get them in at intervals when the weather is fine.  Now I shall go my rounds for turtle. Good-night, ma'am,--good-night, sir.  Come, William.""",good sir find time have more fine weather event get interval weather fine go round turtle good night good night sir come
