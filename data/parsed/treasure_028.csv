1,CHAPTER 29. The Black Spot Again,black 
2,"THE council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them re-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which had in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment's loan of the torch. Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us together in the dark.",council buccaneer last time re-enter house repetition same salute have eye ironical air begg moment loan torch agree emissary retire leave dark 
3,"""There's a breeze coming, Jim,"" said Silver, who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.",be breeze come say have time adopt friendly familiar tone 
4,"I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group; one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight. The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though watching the manoeuvres of this last. I could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house.",turn loophole look ember great fire burn glow low understand conspirator desire torch half way slope stockade collect group hold light knee midst see blade open knife shine hand vary colour moon torchlight rest stoop watch manoeuvre last make have book knife hand wonder incongruous come possession kneeling figure rise more foot whole party begin move house

6,"""Well, let 'em come, lad--let 'em come,"" said Silver cheerily. ""I've still a shot in my locker.""",let come let come say shot locker 
7,"The door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together just inside, pushed one of their number forward. In any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance, hesitating as he set down each foot, but holding his closed right hand in front of him.",door open man standing huddle push number other circumstance comical see slow advance hesitate set foot hold close right hand front 
8,"""Step up, lad,"" cried Silver. ""I won't eat you. Hand it over, lubber. I know the rules, I do; I won't hurt a depytation.""",step lad cry eat hand lubber know rule hurt depytation

17,"""Belay that talk, John Silver,"" he said. ""This crew has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see what's wrote there. Then you can talk.""",belay talk say crew tip black spot full council dooty bound turn dooty bound see write talk 
18,"""Thanky, George,"" replied the sea-cook. ""You always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, George? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew. You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will you? This pipe don't draw.""",reply sea cook brisk business have rule heart pleased see depose write sure print swear hand write gett leadin man crew cap wonder oblige torch pipe draw

20,"""I thought you said you knowed the rules,"" returned Silver contemptuously. ""Leastways, if you don't, I do; and I wait here--and I'm still your cap'n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit. After that, we'll see.""",think say know rule return leastway wait cap mind out grievance reply meantime black spot worth biscuit see 
21,"""Oh,"" replied George, ""you don't be under no kind of apprehension; WE'RE all square, we are. First, you've made a hash of this cruise--you'll be a bold man to say no to that. Second, you let the enemy out o' this here trap for nothing. Why did they want out? I dunno, but it's pretty plain they wanted it. Third, you wouldn't let us go at them upon the march. Oh, we see through you, John Silver; you want to play booty, that's what's wrong with you. And then, fourth, there's this here boy.""",reply kind apprehension square make hash cruise bold man say let enemy trap want dunno plain want let go march see want play booty wrong fourth be boy

23,"""Enough, too,"" retorted George. ""We'll all swing and sun-dry for your bungling.""",enough retort swing sun dry bungling 
24,"""Well now, look here, I'll answer these four p'ints; one after another I'll answer 'em. I made a hash o' this cruise, did I? Well now, you all know what I wanted, and you all know if that had been done that we'd 'a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was, every man of us alive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure in the hold of her, by thunder! Well, who crossed me? Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n? Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance? Ah, it's a fine dance--I'm with you there--and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a rope's end at Execution Dock by London town, it does. But who done it? Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George Merry! And you're the last above board of that same meddling crew; and you have the Davy Jones's insolence to up and stand for cap'n over me--you, that sank the lot of us! By the powers! But this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing.""",look answer p'int answer make hash cruise know want know do night man alive fit full good plum duff treasure hold thunder cross force hand lawful cap tip black spot day land begin dance fine dance look mighty hornpipe rope end town do hand last board same meddling crew have insolence stand cap sink lot power top stiffest yarn 
25,"Silver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain.",silver pause see face late comrade word say vain 
26,"""That's for number one,"" cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house. ""Why, I give you my word, I'm sick to speak to you. You've neither sense nor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o' fortune! I reckon tailors is your trade.""",number one cry accuse wipe sweat brow talk vehemence shake house give word sick speak have sense memory leave fancy mother let come sea sea gentlemen fortune reckon tailor trade 
27,"""Go on, John,"" said Morgan. ""Speak up to the others.""",go say speak other 
28,"""Ah, the others!"" returned John. ""They're a nice lot, ain't they? You say this cruise is bungled. Ah! By gum, if you could understand how bad it's bungled, you would see! We're that near the gibbet that my neck's stiff with thinking on it. You've seen 'em, maybe, hanged in chains, birds about 'em, seamen p'inting 'em out as they go down with the tide. 'Who's that?' says one. 'That! Why, that's John Silver. I knowed him well,' says another. And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy. Now, that's about where we are, every mother's son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and other ruination fools of you. And if you want to know about number four, and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn't he a hostage? Are we a-going to waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn't wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah, well, there's a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don't count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John, with your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn't know there was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till then; and we'll see who'll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that. And as for number two, and why I made a bargain--well, you came crawling on your knees to me to make it--on your knees you came, you was that downhearted--and you'd have starved too if I hadn't--but that's a trifle! You look there--that's why!""",other return nice lot say cruise bungle gum understand bad bungle see gibbet neck stiff think see hang chain bird seamen p'int go tide say know say hear chain jangle go reach other buoy mother son thanks hand other ruination fool want know number boy shiver timber hostage go waste hostage last chance wonder kill boy mate number be deal say number count have real college doctor see day head break have ague shake hour have eye colour lemon peel same moment clock know be consort come be see glad have hostage come number make bargain come crawl knee make knee come downhearted starve trifle look 
29,"And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly recognized--none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain's chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I could fancy.",cast floor paper recognize other chart yellow paper red cross find oilcloth bottom captain chest doctor give more fancy 
30,"But if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers. They leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse. It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another; and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they were fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in safety.",inexplicable appearance chart incredible survive mutineer leap cat mouse go hand hand tear oath cry childish laughter accompany examination think finger very gold sea safety

33,"Silver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand against the wall: ""Now I give you warning, George,"" he cried. ""One more word of your sauce, and I'll call you down and fight you. How? Why, how do I know? You had ought to tell me that--you and the rest, that lost me my schooner, with your interference, burn you! But not you, you can't; you hain't got the invention of a cockroach. But civil you can speak, and shall, George Merry, you may lay to that.""",silver spring support hand wall give warning cry more word sauce call fight know ought tell rest lose schooner interference burn get invention cockroach civil speak lay

37,"""So that's the toon, is it?"" cried the cook. ""George, I reckon you'll have to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I'm not a revengeful man. But that was never my way. And now, shipmates, this black spot? 'Tain't much good now, is it? Dick's crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, and that's about all.""",toon cry cook reckon have wait turn friend lucky revengeful man way shipmate black spot good cross luck spoiled

41,"""Here, Jim--here's a cur'osity for you,"" said Silver, and he tossed me the paper.",cur'osity say toss paper 
42,"It was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was blank, for it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of Revelation--these words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon my mind: ""Without are dogs and murderers."" The printed side had been blackened with wood ash, which already began to come off and soil my fingers; on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word ""Depposed."" I have that curiosity beside me at this moment, but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a man might make with his thumb-nail.",size crown piece side blank last leaf other contain verse word rest strike mind dog murderer print side blacken wood ash begin come soil finger blank side write same material word deppose have curiosity moment trace writing remain single scratch such man make thumb-nail 
43,"That was the end of the night's business. Soon after, with a drink all round, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of Silver's vengeance was to put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful.",end night business drink lay sleep outside vengeance put sentinel threaten death prove unfaithful 
44,"It was long ere I could close an eye, and heaven knows I had matter enough for thought in the man whom I had slain that afternoon, in my own most perilous position, and above all, in the remarkable game that I saw Silver now engaged upon--keeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means, possible and impossible, to make his peace and save his miserable life. He himself slept peacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he was, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him.",long close eye heaven know have matter thought man slain afternoon own perilous position remarkable game see engage keep mutineer hand grasp other means possible impossible make peace save miserable life sleep snore heart sore wicked think dark peril environ shameful gibbet await
