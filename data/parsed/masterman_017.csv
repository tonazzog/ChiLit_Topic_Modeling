2,"Guided by the marks made on the trees, William and Ready made rapid progress in their return, and in less than two hours found themselves almost clear of the wood which had taken them nearly eight hours to force their way through the day before.",guided mark make tree make rapid progress return less hour find clear wood take hour force way day 
3,"""I feel the wind now, Ready,"" observed William, ""and we must be nearly through the wood; but it appears to me to be very dark.""",feel wind ready observe wood appear dark 
4,"""I was just thinking the same,"" replied Ready.  ""I should not wonder if there is a storm brewing up; and if so, the sooner we are back again the better.""",think same reply ready wonder be storm brew good 
5,"As they proceeded, the rustling and waving of the boughs of the trees, and ever and anon a gust of wind, followed by a moaning and creaking sound, proved that such was the fact; and as they emerged from the grove, they perceived that the sky, as it became visible to them, was of one dark leaden hue, and no longer of the brilliant blue which it usually had presented to their sight.",proceed rustling wave bough tree gust wind follow moan creak sound prove such fact emerge grove perceive sky become visible dark leaden hue long brilliant blue present sight 
6,"""There is indeed a gale coming on,"" said Ready, as they cleared the wood: ""let us go on to the tents as fast as possible, for we must see that all is as secure as we can make it.""",be gale come say ready clear wood let go tent possible see secure make 
7,"The dogs now bounded forward; and at their appearance at the tents Mr Seagrave and Juno came out, and seeing Ready and William advancing, made known the welcome tidings to Mrs Seagrave, who, with the children, had remained within.  In a moment more William was pressed in his mother's arms.",dog bound appearance tent come see ready advance make know welcome tiding child remain moment press mother arm 
8,"""I am glad that you are come back, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave, shaking him by the hand after he had embraced William, ""for I fear that bad weather is coming on.""",glad come ready say shake hand embrace fear bad weather come 
9,"""I am sure of it,"" replied Ready, ""and we must expect a blusterous night.  This will be one of the storms which are forerunners of the rainy season.  However, we have good news for you, and must only take this as a warning to hasten our departure as soon as possible.  We shall have fine weather after this for a month or so, although we must expect a breeze now and then.  But we must work hard and do our best; and now, if you please, you and Juno, William and I, will go and haul up the boat as far from the beach as we possibly can, for the waves will be high and run a long way up, and our boat will be our main dependence soon.""",sure reply ready expect blusterous night storm forerunner rainy season have good news take warning hast departure possible have fine weather month expect breeze work do good go haul boat beach wave high run long way boat main dependence 
10,"The four went down as soon as Ready had sawed the ends of the spars which had been cut off, into three rollers, to fix under the keel; with the help afforded by them, the boat was soon hauled up high into the brushwood, where it was considered by Ready to be perfectly safe.",go ready saw end spar cut roller fix keel help afford boat haul high brushwood consider ready safe 
11,"""I meant to have worked upon her immediately,"" observed Ready; ""but I must wait now till the gale is over; and I did hope to have got on board once more, and looked after some things which I have since remembered would have been useful; but I strongly suspect,"" continued he, looking at the weather, ""that we shall never go on board of the poor vessel again.  Hear the moaning of the coming storm, sir; look how the sea-birds wheel about and scream, as if to proclaim her doom; but we must not wait here--the tents must be made more secure, for they will have to hold up against no small force of wind, if I mistake not.""",mean work observe ready wait gale hope get board more look thing remember useful suspect continue look weather go board poor vessel hear moan come storm sir look sea bird wheel scream proclaim doom wait tent make secure have hold small force wind mistake 
12,"Ready, assisted by Mr Seagrave, now got out some heavy canvas and lines, and commenced putting it as a double cover over the tents, to keep out the rain; they also secured the tents with guys and stays of rope, so as to prevent them being blown down; while Juno with a shovel deepened the trench which had been made round the tents, so that the water might run off more easily.  During the time they were at work, Ready had made Mr Seagrave acquainted with what they had discovered and done during the exploring expedition, and the adventure with the pigs made them all laugh heartily.",ready assist get heavy canvas line commence put double cover tent keep rain secure tent guy stay rope prevent blow shovel deepen trench make tent water run time work ready make acquainted discover do explore expedition adventure pig make laugh 
13,"As the sun went down, the weather threatened still more; the wind blew strong, and the rocky beach was lashed by the waves and white with spray, while the surf roared as it poured in and broke upon the sand in the cove.  The whole family had retired to bed except Ready, who said that he would watch the weather a little before he turned in.  The old man walked towards the beach, and leaned against the gunnel of the boat, and there he remained with his keen grey eye fixed upon the distance, which was now one opaque mass, except where the white foam of the waters gleamed through the darkness of the night!  ""Yes!"" thought he; ""the winds and the waves are summoned to do his bidding, and evenly do they work together--as one rises, so does the other; when one howls, the other roars in concert--hand in hand they go in their fury and their force.  Had they been called up but one week since, where would have been those who have now been, as it were, intrusted to my weak help? The father, the mother, the children, the infant at the breast, and I, the grey-headed old man,--all buried fathoms deep, awaiting our summons; but they were restrained by his will, and by his will we were saved. Will those timbers which bore us here so miraculously hold together till morning?  I should think not.  What are the iron bolts and fastenings of weak man, compared with the force of God's elements: they will snap as yarns; and by to-morrow's dawn, the fragments of the stout ship will be washing and tossing on the wild surf.  Well, it will be a kindness to us, for the waters will perform the labour which we could not; they will break up the timbers for our use, and throw on shore from the hold those articles which we could not reach with our little strength.""",sun go weather threaten more wind blow strong rocky beach lash wave white spray surf roar pour break sand cove whole family retire bed ready say watch weather little turn old man walk beach learn gunnel boat remain keen grey eye fix distance opaque mass white foam water gleam darkness night think wind wave summon do bid work rise other howl other roar concert hand hand go fury force call week intrust weak help father mother child infant breast grey headed old man bury fathom deep await summons restrain will will save timber bear hold morning think iron bolt fastening weak man compare force element snap yarn dawn fragment stout ship wash toss wild surf kindness water perform labour break timber use throw shore hold article reach little strength 
14,"A sharp flash of lightning struck upon the old man's eyes, and obstructed his vision for the moment.  ""The storm will soon be at its height,"" thought he; ""I will watch the tents, and see how they stand up against its force.""  Then the rain came pattering down, and the wind howled louder than before.  In a minute or two the darkness became so intense that he could hardly find his way back to the tents.  He turned round, but could not see, for he was blinded by the heavy rain.  As nothing could be done, he went into the tent and sheltered himself from the storm, although he would not lie down, lest his services might be required.  The others had retired to bed, but with the exception of Tommy and the children, they had not taken off their clothes.",sharp flash lightning strike old man eye obstruct vision moment storm height think watch tent see stand force rain come patter wind howl minute darkness become intense find way tent turn see blind heavy rain do go tent shelter storm lie service require other retire bed exception child take clothes
