1,CHAPTER I. I SET OFF UPON MY JOURNEY TO THE HOUSE OF SHAWS,chapter i. set journey 
2,"I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in the month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the last time out of the door of my father’s house. The sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of the dawn was beginning to arise and die away.",begin story adventure certain morning month year grace take key last time door father house sun begin shine summit hill go road time come manse blackbird whistle garden lilac mist hang valley time dawn begin arise die 
3,"Mr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, was waiting for me by the garden gate, good man! He asked me if I had breakfasted; and hearing that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it kindly under his arm.",minister wait garden gate good man ask breakfast hear lack take hand clapp arm 
4,"“Well, Davie, lad,” said he, “I will go with you as far as the ford, to set you on the way.” And we began to walk forward in silence.",say go ford set way begin walk silence 
5,"“Are ye sorry to leave Essendean?” said he, after awhile.",sorry leave say 
6,"“Why, sir,” said I, “if I knew where I was going, or what was likely to become of me, I would tell you candidly. Essendean is a good place indeed, and I have been very happy there; but then I have never been anywhere else. My father and mother, since they are both dead, I shall be no nearer to in Essendean than in the Kingdom of Hungary, and, to speak truth, if I thought I had a chance to better myself where I was going I would go with a good will.”",sir say know go likely become tell good place happy else father mother dead nearer speak truth think have chance go go good will 
7,"“Ay?” said Mr. Campbell. “Very well, Davie. Then it behoves me to tell your fortune; or so far as I may. When your mother was gone, and your father (the worthy, Christian man) began to sicken for his end, he gave me in charge a certain letter, which he said was your inheritance. ‘So soon,’ says he, ‘as I am gone, and the house is redd up and the gear disposed of’ (all which, Davie, hath been done), ‘give my boy this letter into his hand, and start him off to the house of Shaws, not far from Cramond. That is the place I came from,’ he said, ‘and it’s where it befits that my boy should return. He is a steady lad,’ your father said, ‘and a canny goer; and I doubt not he will come safe, and be well lived where he goes.’”",say behove tell fortune mother gone father worthy christian man begin sick end give charge certain letter say inheritance say gone house redd gear dispose do give boy letter hand start house place come say befit boy return steady lad father say canny goer doubt come safe live go 
8,“The house of Shaws!” I cried. “What had my poor father to do with the house of Shaws?”,house cry have poor father do house 
9,"“Nay,” said Mr. Campbell, “who can tell that for a surety? But the name of that family, Davie, boy, is the name you bear--Balfours of Shaws: an ancient, honest, reputable house, peradventure in these latter days decayed. Your father, too, was a man of learning as befitted his position; no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner or the speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember) I took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and those of my own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire, Campbell of Minch, and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure in his society. Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before you, here is the testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own hand of our departed brother.”",say tell surety name family boy name bear ancient honest reputable house peradventure latter day decay father man learning befit position man conduct school have manner speech common dominie remember take pleasure have manse meet gentry own house other kenn gentleman have pleasure society put element affair testamentary letter superscrive own hand depart brother 
10,"He gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words: “To the hands of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these will be delivered by my son, David Balfour.” My heart was beating hard at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen years of age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of Ettrick.",give letter address word hand house deliver son heart beat great prospect open lad year age son poor country dominie 
11,"“Mr. Campbell,” I stammered, “and if you were in my shoes, would you go?”",stammer shoe go 
12,"“Of a surety,” said the minister, “that would I, and without pause. A pretty lad like you should get to Cramond (which is near in by Edinburgh) in two days of walk. If the worst came to the worst, and your high relations (as I cannot but suppose them to be somewhat of your blood) should put you to the door, ye can but walk the two days back again and risp at the manse door. But I would rather hope that ye shall be well received, as your poor father forecast for you, and for anything that I ken come to be a great man in time. And here, Davie, laddie,” he resumed, “it lies near upon my conscience to improve this parting, and set you on the right guard against the dangers of the world.”",surety say minister pause lad get day walk bad come bad high relation suppose blood put door walk day risp manse door hope receive poor father forecast ke come great man time resume lie conscience improve parting set right guard danger world 
13,"Here he cast about for a comfortable seat, lighted on a big boulder under a birch by the trackside, sate down upon it with a very long, serious upper lip, and the sun now shining in upon us between two peaks, put his pocket-handkerchief over his cocked hat to shelter him. There, then, with uplifted forefinger, he first put me on my guard against a considerable number of heresies, to which I had no temptation, and urged upon me to be instant in my prayers and reading of the Bible. That done, he drew a picture of the great house that I was bound to, and how I should conduct myself with its inhabitants.",cast comfortable seat light big boulder birch trackside sate long serious upper lip sun shine peak put pocket handkerchief cocked hat shelter uplift forefinger put guard considerable number heresies have temptation urge instant prayer reading do draw picture great house bind conduct inhabitant 
14,"“Be soople, Davie, in things immaterial,” said he. “Bear ye this in mind, that, though gentle born, ye have had a country rearing. Dinnae shame us, Davie, dinnae shame us! In yon great, muckle house, with all these domestics, upper and under, show yourself as nice, as circumspect, as quick at the conception, and as slow of speech as any. As for the laird--remember he’s the laird; I say no more: honour to whom honour. It’s a pleasure to obey a laird; or should be, to the young.”",soople thing immaterial say bear mind gentle bear have country rear shame shame great muckle house domestics upper show nice circumspect quick conception slow speech laird remember laird say more honour honour pleasure obey laird young 
15,"“Well, sir,” said I, “it may be; and I’ll promise you I’ll try to make it so.”",sir say promise try make 
16,"“Why, very well said,” replied Mr. Campbell, heartily. “And now to come to the material, or (to make a quibble) to the immaterial. I have here a little packet which contains four things.” He tugged it, as he spoke, and with some great difficulty, from the skirt pocket of his coat. “Of these four things, the first is your legal due: the little pickle money for your father’s books and plenishing, which I have bought (as I have explained from the first) in the design of re-selling at a profit to the incoming dominie. The other three are gifties that Mrs. Campbell and myself would be blithe of your acceptance. The first, which is round, will likely please ye best at the first off-go; but, O Davie, laddie, it’s but a drop of water in the sea; it’ll help you but a step, and vanish like the morning. The second, which is flat and square and written upon, will stand by you through life, like a good staff for the road, and a good pillow to your head in sickness. And as for the last, which is cubical, that’ll see you, it’s my prayerful wish, into a better land.”",say reply come material make quibble immaterial have little packet contain thing tug speak great difficulty skirt pocket coat thing first legal due little pickle money father book plenishing buy explain first design re-sell profit incoming dominie other gifty blithe acceptance first please good first off go laddie drop water sea help step vanish morning second flat square write stand life good staff road good pillow head sickness last cubical see prayerful wish good land 
17,"With that he got upon his feet, took off his hat, and prayed a little while aloud, and in affecting terms, for a young man setting out into the world; then suddenly took me in his arms and embraced me very hard; then held me at arm’s length, looking at me with his face all working with sorrow; and then whipped about, and crying good-bye to me, set off backward by the way that we had come at a sort of jogging run. It might have been laughable to another; but I was in no mind to laugh. I watched him as long as he was in sight; and he never stopped hurrying, nor once looked back. Then it came in upon my mind that this was all his sorrow at my departure; and my conscience smote me hard and fast, because I, for my part, was overjoyed to get away out of that quiet country-side, and go to a great, busy house, among rich and respected gentlefolk of my own name and blood.",get foot take hat pray little while affect term young man set world take arm embrace hold arm length look face work sorrow whip cry good bye set way come sort jogging run laughable mind laugh watch sight stop hurry look come mind sorrow departure conscience smeat fast part overjoy get quiet country side go great busy house rich respect gentlefolk own name blood 
18,"“Davie, Davie,” I thought, “was ever seen such black ingratitude? Can you forget old favours and old friends at the mere whistle of a name? Fie, fie; think shame.”",think see such black ingratitude forget old favour old friend mere whistle name fie fie think shame 
19,"And I sat down on the boulder the good man had just left, and opened the parcel to see the nature of my gifts. That which he had called cubical, I had never had much doubt of; sure enough it was a little Bible, to carry in a plaid-neuk. That which he had called round, I found to be a shilling piece; and the third, which was to help me so wonderfully both in health and sickness all the days of my life, was a little piece of coarse yellow paper, written upon thus in red ink:",sit boulder good man leave open parcel see nature gift call cubical have much doubt little carry plaid neuk call find shilling piece third help health sickness day life little piece coarse yellow paper write red ink 
20," “TO MAKE LILLY OF THE VALLEY WATER.--Take the flowers of lilly of the valley and distil them in sack, and drink a spooneful or two as there is occasion. It restores speech to those that have the dumb palsey. It is good against the Gout; it comforts the heart and strengthens the memory; and the flowers, put into a Glasse, close stopt, and set into ane hill of ants for a month, then take it out, and you will find a liquor which comes from the flowers, which keep in a vial; it is good, ill or well, and whether man or woman.”",make valley water take flower lilly valley distil sack drink spooneful be occasion restore speech have dumb palsey good comfort heart strengthen memory flower put close stopt set hill ant month take find liquor come flower keep vial good ill man woman

24," To be sure, I laughed over this; but it was rather tremulous laughter; and I was glad to get my bundle on my staff’s end and set out over the ford and up the hill upon the farther side; till, just as I came on the green drove-road running wide through the heather, I took my last look of Kirk Essendean, the trees about the manse, and the big rowans in the kirkyard where my father and my mother lay.",sure laugh tremulous laughter glad get bundle staff end set ford hill far side come green drive road run heather take last look tree manse big rowan kirkyard father mother lay
