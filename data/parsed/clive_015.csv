1,CHAPTER 14. The Siege Of Ambur.,
2," The victory was a complete and decisive one. A thousand of the best troops of Murari Reo had fallen, besides some hundreds of their irregular allies, whose loss was incurred almost wholly at the gorge in the retreat. The rajah was in the highest state of delight at the splendid result, obtained by the European training of his troops; and these, proud of their victory over such formidable opponents, were full of enthusiasm for their young English leader. The rejoicings in Ambur that night were great, and all felt confident that the danger was at an end.",victory complete decisive one good troops fall hundred irregular ally loss incur gorge retreat high state delight splendid result obtain european training troops proud victory such formidable opponent full enthusiasm young english leader rejoicing night great feel confident danger end 
3,"""What think you,"" the rajah said to Charlie, as, the long feast at an end, they sat together in the divan, smoking their narghileys, ""will be the result, when the news of the defeat of Murari Reo reaches Hyderabad?""",think say long feast end sit divan smoke narghiley result news defeat reach 
4,"""It is difficult to say,"" Charlie replied. ""It is possible, of course, that it may be considered that it is better to leave you in peace; but, upon the other hand, it may be that they will consider that you are so formidable a power, that it is absolutely necessary to crush you at once, rather than to give you the chance of joining against them, in the war which must sooner or later take place between them and the English. In that case, it will be a very different affair from that which we have had today.",difficult say reply possible course consider good leave peace other hand consider formidable power necessary crush give chance join war take place case different affair have today 
5,"""Still, I should send off a messenger tomorrow, to acquaint the nizam with the defeat you inflicted upon the Mahrattas who have invaded you, to assure him again of your loyalty, and to beg him to lay his authority upon Murari Reo, not to renew the attack.""",send messenger tomorrow acquaint defeat inflict invade assure loyalty beg lay authority renew attack 
6,"Ten days later a messenger arrived from the nizam, ordering the rajah to repair, at once, to Hyderabad, to explain his conduct. The latter sent back a message of humble excuses, saying that his health was so injured, by the excitement of recent events, that he was unable to travel; but that, when he recovered, he would journey to Hyderabad to lay his respects at the feet of the nizam.",day messenger arrive nizam order rajah repair explain conduct latter send message humble excuse say health injure excitement recent event unable travel recover journey lay respect foot nizam 
7,"Two or three days later a messenger arrived from Mr. Saunders, with a letter to Charlie. In this he expressed his great satisfaction at the defeat Murari Reo had received; a defeat which would, for some time, keep him quiet, and so relieve the strain upon the English. Affairs had, he said, since the departure of Clive for England, been going badly. Dupleix had received large reinforcements, and the English had suffered several reverses. Mr. Saunders begged him to assure the rajah of the respect and friendship of England, and to give him the promise that, if he should be driven from his capital, he would be received with all honor at Madras, and should be reinstated in his dominions, with much added territory, when the English were again in a position to take the field in force, and to settle their long feud with the French.",day messenger arrive letter express great satisfaction defeat receive defeat time keep quiet relieve strain affair say departure go receive large reinforcement suffer several reverse begg assure rajah respect friendship give promise drive capital receive honor reinstate dominion add territory position take field force settle long feud 
8,"Ten days later, they heard that the army of the nizam, of fifteen thousand troops, with eight hundred French under Bussy, were marching against them; and that the horsemen of Murari Reo were devastating the villages near the frontier. A council of war was held. Charlie would fain have fought in the open again, believing that his trained troops, flushed with their recent victory, would be a match even for the army of the nizam. But the rajah and the rest of the council, alarmed at the presence of the French troops, who had hitherto proved invincible against vastly superior forces of natives, shrank from such a course; and it was decided that they should content themselves with the defence of the town and castle.",day hear army troops march horsemen devastating village frontier council war hold fight open believe train troops flush recent victory match army nizam rest council alarm presence french troops prove invincible superior force native shrank course decide content defence town castle 
9,"Orders were accordingly issued that the old men, the women, and children should at once leave the town; and, under guard of one battalion of troops, take refuge in an almost impregnable hill fort some miles away. One battalion was placed in garrison in the castle. The other three, with the irregulars, took post in the town, whence they could, if necessary, retreat into the castle.",order issue old man woman child leave town guard battalion troops take refuge impregnable hill fort mile battalion place garrison castle other irregular take post town necessary retreat castle 
10,"The day following the removal of the noncombatants the enemy appeared, coming down the valley, having marched over the hills; while the Mahratta cavalry again poured up from below.",day follow removal noncombatant enemy appear come valley march hill cavalry pour 
11,"Charlie had taken the command of the town, as it was against this that the efforts of the enemy would be first directed. It was an imposing sight, as the army of the nizam wound down the valley; the great masses of men with their gay flags, the elephants with the gold embroidery of their trappings glistening in the sun, the bands of horsemen careering here and there, the lines of artillery drawn by bullocks; and, less picturesque but far more menacing, the dark body of French infantry, who formed the nucleus and heart of the whole. The camp was pitched just out of range of the guns of the fort, and soon line after line of tents, gay with the flags that floated above them, rose across the valley.",take command town effort enemy direct impose sight army wind valley great mass man gay flag elephant gold embroidery trapping glisten sun band horsemen career line artillery draw bullock picturesque menace dark body french infantry form nucleus heart whole camp pitch range gun fort line line tent gay flag float rise valley 
12,"Charlie had mounted to the castle, the better to observe the movements of the enemy, and he presently saw a small body of horsemen ride out of the camp, and mount the hillside across the valley. A glass showed that some of these were native officers, while others were in the dark uniform of the French.",mount castle good observe movement enemy see small body horsemen ride camp mount hillside valley glass show native officer other dark uniform 
13,"""I have no doubt,"" Charlie said to the rajah, ""that is the nizam himself, with Bussy, gone up to reconnoitre the position. I wonder how he likes the look of it. I wish we could have turfed the battery above, and the newly stripped land. We might, in that case, have given them a pleasant surprise. As it is, they are hardly likely to begin by an attack along the slopes in the rear of the town, and you will see that they will commence the attack at the farther face of the town. The battery above cannot aid us in our defence there; and although the castle may help, it will only be by a direct fire. If they try to carry the place by a coup de main, I think we can beat them off, but they must succeed by regular approaches.",have doubt say rajah go reconnoitre position wonder like look wish turf battery stripp land case give pleasant surprise likely begin attack slope rear town see commence attack far face town battery aid defence castle help direct fire try carry place coup main think beat succeed regular approach 
14,"""We must inflict as much loss as we can, and then fall back. However, it will be sometime before that comes.""",inflict much loss fall come 
15,"The next morning, Charlie found that the enemy had, during the night, erected three batteries on the slopes facing the north wall of the town, that farthest removed from the castle. They at once opened fire, and the guns on the walls facing them replied, while those on the castle hurled their shot over the town into the enemy's battery. For three days, the artillery fire was kept up without intermission. The guns on the wall were too weak to silence the batteries of the besiegers, although these were much annoyed by the fire from the fort, which dismounted four of their guns, and blew up one of their magazines. Several times the town was set on fire by the shell from the French mortars; but Charlie had organized the irregulars into bands with buckets, and these succeeded in extinguishing the flames before they spread.",next morning find enemy night erect battery slope face north wall town farthest remove castle open fire gun wall face reply castle hurl shot town enemy battery day artillery fire keep intermission gun wall weak silence battery besieger annoy fire fort dismount gun blow magazine several time town set fire shell french mortar organize irregular band bucket succeed extinguish flame spread 
16,"Seeing that the mud wall of the town was crumbling rapidly before the besiegers' fire, Charlie set his troops to work, and levelled every house within fifty yards of it, and with the stones and beams formed barricades across the end of the streets beyond. Many of the guns from other portions of the walls were removed, and placed on these barricades. The ends of the houses were loopholed, and all was prepared for a desperate defence.",see mud wall town crumble besieger fire set troops work levell house yard stone beam form barricade end street many gun other portion wall remove place barricade end house loophol prepare desperate defence 
17,"Charlie's experience at Arcot stood him in good stead, and he imitated the measures taken by Clive at that place. When these defences were completed, he raised a second line of barricades some distance further back; and here, when the assault was expected, he placed one of his battalions, with orders that, if the inner line of entrenchments was carried, they should allow all the defenders of that post to pass through, and then resist until the town was completely evacuated, when they were to fall back upon the fort. He had, however, little fear that his position would be taken at the first assault.",experience stand good stead imitate measure take place defence complete raise second line barricade distance assault expect place battalion order inner line entrenchment carry allow defender post pass resist town evacuate fall fort little fear position take first assault 
18,"Upon the evening of the third day, the besiegers' fire had done its work, and a gap in the wall some eighty yards wide was formed. The garrison were ordered to hold themselves in readiness, and a strict watch was set.",evening third day besieger fire do work gap wall yard wide form garrison order hold readiness strict watch set 
19,"Towards morning, a distant hum in the nizam's camp proclaimed that the troops were mustering for the assault. The besiegers' guns had continued their fire all night, to prevent working parties from placing obstacles in the breach. As the first shades of daylight appeared the fire ceased, and a great column of men poured forward to the assault.",morning distant hum camp proclaim troops muster assault besieger gun continue fire night prevent work party place obstacle breach first shade daylight appear fire cease great column man pour assault 
20,"The few remaining guns upon the end wall opened upon them, as did the infantry who lined the parapet, while the guns in the castle at once joined in. The mighty column, however, composed of the troops of the nizam, pressed forward, poured over the fragments of the wall, and entered the clear space behind it.",few remain gun end wall open do infantry line parapet gun castle join mighty column compose troops nizam press pour fragment wall enter clear space 
21,"Then, from housetop and loophole, and from the walls on either side, a concentrated fire of musketry was poured upon them, while twelve guns, four on each barricade, swept them with grape. The head of the column withered away under the fire, long lines were swept through the crowded mass; and, after a minute or two's wild firing at their concealed foes, the troops of the nizam, appalled and shattered by the tremendous fire, broke and fled.",housetop loophole wall side concentrate fire musketry pour gun barricade sweep grape head column wither fire long line sweep crowded mass minute wild fire conceal foe troops nizam appall shattered tremendous fire break flead 
22,"The instant they had cleared the breach, the guns of the besiegers again opened furiously upon it, to check any sortie which the besieged might attempt.",instant clear breach gun besieger open check sortie besiege attempt 
23,"An hour later, the besiegers hoisted a white flag, and requested to be allowed to bury their dead, and remove their wounded. This Charlie agreed to, with the proviso that these should be carried by his own men beyond the breach, as he did not wish that the enemy should have an opportunity of examining the internal defences. The task occupied some time, as more than five hundred dead and dying lay scattered in the open space.",hour besieger hoist white flag request allow bury dead remove wound agree proviso carry own man breach wish enemy have opportunity examine internal defence task occupy time more dead die scatter open space 
24,"During the rest of the day, the enemy showed no signs of resuming the assault. During the night they could be heard hard at work, and although a brisk fire was kept up to hinder them, Charlie found that they had pushed trenches, from the batteries, a considerable distance round each corner of the town.",rest day enemy show sign resume assault night hear work brisk fire keep hinder find push trenche battery considerable distance corner town 
25,"For four days the besiegers worked vigorously, harassed as they were by the guns of the fort, and by those of the battery high up on the hillside, which were now able to take in flank the works across the upper angle of the town. At the end of that time, they had erected and armed two batteries, which at daylight opened upon the walls which formed the flanks of the clear space behind the breach. Although suffering heavily from the fire of the besieged, and losing many men, these batteries kept up their fire unceasingly, night and day, until great gaps had been made in the walls, and Charlie was obliged to withdraw his troops from them, behind the line of barricades.",day besieger work harass gun fort battery high hillside able take flank work upper angle town end time erect arm battery daylight open wall form flank clear space breach suffer fire besiege lose many man battery keep fire night day great gap make wall oblige withdraw troops line barricade 
26,"During this time the fire of the batteries in front had been unceasing, and had destroyed most of the houses which formed the connecting line between the barricades. Each night, however, the besieged worked to repair damages, and to fill up the gaps thus formed with piles of stones and beams, so that, by the end of the fourth day after the repulse of the first assault, a line of barricades stretched across the line of defence.",time fire battery front uncease destroy most house form connect line barricade night besiege work repair damage fill gap form pile stone beam end fourth day repulse first assault line barricade stretch line defence 
27,"The enemy, this time, prepared to attack by daylight, and early in the morning the whole army of the nizam marched to the assault. Heedless of the fire of the castle, they formed up in a long line of heavy masses, along the slope. One huge column moved forward against the main breach, two advanced obliquely towards the great gaps in the walls on either side. The latter columns were each headed by bodies of French troops.",enemy time prepare attack daylight morning whole army march assault heedless fire castle form long line heavy mass slope huge column move main breach advance great gap wall side latter column head body french troops 
28,"In vain the guns of the fort, aided by those of the battery on the hill, swept them. The columns advanced without a check until they entered the breaches. Then a line of fire swept along the crest of the barricade from end to end, and the cannon of the besieged roared out. Pressed by the mass from behind, the columns advanced, torn and rent by the fire, and at last gained the foot of the barricade.",vain gun fort aid battery hill sweep column advance check enter breach line fire sweep crest barricade end end cannon besiege roar press mass column advance tear rent fire last gain foot barricade 
29,"Here, those in front strove desperately to climb up the great mound of rubbish, while those behind covered them with a storm of bullets aimed at its summit. More than once the troops of the rajah, rushing down the embankment, drove back the struggling masses, but so heavily did they suffer from the fire, when they thus exposed themselves, that Charlie forbade them to repeat the attempt. He knew that there was safety behind, and was unwilling that his brave fellows should throw away their lives.",front strive climb great mound rubbish cover storm bullet aim summit more troops rajah rush embankment drive struggle mass suffer fire expose forbid repeat attempt know be safety unwilling brave fellow throw life 
30,"In the centre of the position the native troops, although they several times climbed some distance up the barricade, were yet unable to make way. But the French troops at the flanks were steadily forcing their way up. Many had climbed up by the ruins of the wall, and from its top were firing down on the defenders of the barricade. Inch by inch they won their way up the barricade, already thickly covered with dead; and then Charlie, seeing that his men were beginning to waver, gave the signal.",centre position native troops several time climb distance barricade unable make way french troops flank force way many climb ruin wall top fire defender barricade inch inch win way barricade cover dead see man begin waver give signal 
31,"The long blast of a trumpet was heard even above the tremendous din. In an instant the barricades were deserted, and the defenders rushed into the houses. The partition walls between these on the lower floors had already been knocked down, and without suffering from the heavy fire which the assailants opened, as soon as they gained the crest of the barricade, the defenders retreated along these covered ways until in rear of the second line of defence.",long blast trumpet hear tremendous din instant barricade desert defender rush house partition wall low floor knock suffer heavy fire assailant open gain crest barricade defender retreat cover way rear second line defence 
32,"This was held by the battalion placed there, until the whole of the defenders of the town had left it, by the gate leading up to the fort. Then Charlie withdrew this battalion also, and the town remained in the hands of the enemy; who had lost, Charlie reckoned, fully fifteen hundred men in the assault.",hold battalion place whole defender town leave gate lead fort withdraw battalion town remain hand enemy lose reckon man assault 
33,"During the fight Tim and the faithful Hossein, now fully recovered and promoted to the rank of an officer, had remained close beside him; and were, with him, the last to leave the town.",fight faithful recover promote rank officer remain close last leave town 
34,"The instant the evacuation was complete, the guns of the hill battery opened upon the town; and a tremendous fire of musketry was poured upon it from every point of the castle which commanded it; while the guns, which from their lofty elevation, could not be depressed sufficiently to bear upon the town, directed their fire upon the bodies of troops still beyond the walls. The enemy had captured the town, indeed, but its possession aided them but little in their assault upon the fort. The only advantage it gave them, would have been that it would have enabled them to attack the lower gate of the fort, protected by its outer wall from the fire of the hill battery. Charlie had, however, perceived that this would be the case, and had planted a number of mines under the wall at this point. These were exploded when the defenders of the town entered the fort, and a hundred yards of the wall were thus destroyed; leaving the space, across which the enemy must advance to the attack of the gate, exposed to the fire of the hill battery, as well as of the numerous guns of the fort bearing upon it.",instant evacuation complete gun hill battery open town tremendous fire musketry pour point castle command gun lofty elevation depressed bear town direct fire body troops wall enemy capture town possession aid little assault fort only advantage give enable attack low gate fort protect outer wall fire hill battery perceive case plant number mine wall point explode defender town enter fort yard wall destroy leave space enemy advance attack gate expose fire hill battery numerous gun fort bear 
35,"Two days passed without any further operations on the part of the enemy; and then Bussy, seeing that nothing whatever could be done towards assaulting the fortress, so long as the battery remained in the hands of the besieged, determined to make a desperate effort to carry it, ignorant of its immense strength. At night, therefore, he ordered two bodies of men, each fifteen hundred strong, to mount the hillside, far to the right and left of the town; to move along at the foot of the wall of rock, and to carry the battery by storm at daybreak.",day pass further operation part enemy see do assault fortress battery remain hand besiege determined make desperate effort carry ignorant immense strength night order body man strong mount hillside right left town move foot wall rock carry battery storm daybreak 
36,"Charlie, believing that such an attempt would be made, had upon the day following the fall of the town taken his post there, and had ordered a most vigilant watch to be kept up, each night; placing sentries some hundred yards away, on either side, to give warning of the approach of an enemy.",believe attempt make have day follow fall town take post order vigilant watch keep night place sentry yard side give warning approach enemy 
37,"Towards daybreak on the third morning a shot upon the left, followed a few seconds later by one on the right, told that the enemy were approaching. A minute or two afterwards the sentries ran in, climbed from the ditch by ladders which had been placed there for the purpose, and, hauling these up after them, were soon in the battery, with the news that large bodies of the enemy were approaching on either flank. Scarcely were the garrison at their posts, when the French were seen approaching. At once they broke into a run, and, gallantly led, dashed across the space of cleared rock, in spite of the heavy fire of musketry and grape.",daybreak third morning shot left follow few second right tell enemy approach minute sentry run climb ditch ladder place purpose haul battery news large body enemy approach flank garrison post see approach break run lead dash space clear rock spite heavy fire musketry grape 
38,"When they came, however, to the edge of the deep gulf in the solid rock, they paused. They had had no idea of meeting with such an obstacle as this. It was easy enough to leap down, but impossible to climb up the steep face, ten feet high, in front of them; and which, in the dim light, could be plainly seen. It was, however, impossible for those in front to pause. Pressed upon by those behind, who did not know what was stopping them, large numbers were compelled to jump into the trench, where they found themselves unable either to advance or retreat.",come edge deep gulf solid rock pause have idea meet obstacle easy leap impossible climb steep face foot high front dim light see impossible front pause press know stop large number compel jump trench find unable advance retreat 
39,"By this time, every gun on the upper side of the castle had opened on the assailing columns, taking them in flank, while the fire of the battery was continued without a moment's intermission. Bussy himself, who was commanding one of the columns, pushed his way through his struggling soldiers to the edge of the trench; when, seeing the impossibility of scaling the sides, unprovided as he was with scaling ladders, he gave the orders to retreat; and the columns, harassed by the flanking fire of the guns of the castle, and pursued by that of the battery, retreated, having lost some hundreds of their number; besides a hundred and fifty of their best men, prisoners in the deep trench around the battery.",time gun upper side castle open assail column take flank fire battery continue moment intermission commanding column push way struggle soldier edge trench see impossibility scaling side unprovided scaling ladder give order retreat column harass flank fire gun castle pursue battery retreat lose hundred number good man prisoner deep trench battery 
40,"These were summoned to surrender; and, resistance being impossible, they at once laid down their arms. Ladders were lowered to them, and they were marched as prisoners to the fort.",summon surrender resistance impossible lay arm ladder lower march prisoner fort 
41,"The next morning, when the defenders of the fortress looked over the valley, the great camp was gone. The nizam and Bussy, despairing of the possibility of carrying the position, at once so enormously strong by nature, and so gallantly defended, had raised the siege; which had cost them over two thousand of their best soldiers, including two hundred French killed and prisoners, and retreated to the plateau of the Deccan.",next morning defender fortress look valley great camp gone despair possibility carry position strong nature defend raise siege cost good soldier include french kill prisoner retreat plateau 
42,"The exultation of the rajah and his troops was unbounded. They felt that, now and henceforth, they were safe from another invasion; and the rajah saw that, in the future, he should be able to gain greatly increased territory, as the ally of the English. His gratitude to Charlie was unbounded, and he literally loaded him with costly presents.",exultation troops unbounded feel henceforth safe invasion see future able gain increase territory ally gratitude unbounded load costly present 
43,"Three weeks later, a letter was received by the latter from Mr. Saunders, congratulating him upon the inestimable service which he had rendered, and appointing him to the rank of captain in the Company's service. Now that the rajah would be able to protect himself, should any future assault be made upon him--an event most unlikely to happen, as Bussy and the nizam would be unwilling to risk a repetition of a defeat, which had already so greatly injured their prestige--he had better return to Madras, where, as Mr. Saunders said, the services of so capable an officer were greatly needed. He warned him, however, to be careful in the extreme how he made his way back, as the country was in a most disturbed state, the Mahratta bands being everywhere out plundering and burning.",week letter receive latter congratulate inestimable service render appoint rank captain company service able protect future assault make event unlikely happen unwilling risk repetition defeat injure prestige have good return say service capable officer need warn careful extreme make way country disturb state band plunder burn 
44,"Subsequent information, that the Mahrattas were swarming in the plains below, determined Charlie to accept an offer which the rajah made him; that he should, under a strong escort, cross the mountains, and make his way to a port on the west coast, in the state of a friendly rajah, where he would be able to take ship and coast round to Madras. The rajah promised to send Charlie's horses and other presents down to Madras, when an opportunity should offer; and Charlie, accompanied by the four Sepoys, all of whom had been promoted to the rank of officers; by Tim Kelly and Hossein, who would not separate himself a moment from his side, started from Ambur, with an escort of thirty horsemen.",subsequent information swarm plain determine accept offer rajah make strong escort cross mountain make way port west coast state friendly rajah able take ship coast promise send horse other present opportunity offer accompany promote rank officer separate moment side start escort horsemen 
45,"The rajah was quite affected at the parting; and the army, which he had formed and organized, paraded before him for the last time, and then shouted their farewell.",rajah affect parting army form organize parade last time shout farewell 
46,"Charlie himself, although glad to return among his countrymen, from whom he had been nearly two years separated, was yet sorry to leave the many friends he had made. His position was now a very different one from that which he held when he left Madras. Then he was a newly made lieutenant, who had distinguished himself, indeed, under Clive, but who was as yet unknown save to his commander, and who was as poor as when he had landed, eighteen months before, in India. Now he had gained a name for himself, and his successful defence of Ambur had been of immense service to the Company. He was, too, a wealthy man; for the presents in money, alone, of the rajah, had amounted to over twenty-five thousand pounds; a sum which, in these days, may appear extraordinary, but which was small to that frequently bestowed, by wealthy native princes, upon British officers who had done them a good service. Clive himself, after his short campaign, had returned to England with a far larger sum.",glad return countryman year separate sorry leave many friend make position different one hold leave make lieutenant distinguish unknown save commander poor land month gain name successful defence immense service company wealthy man present money rajah amount pound sum day appear extraordinary small bestow wealthy native prince british officer do good service short campaign return large sum 
47,"For several days, the party rode through the hills without incident; and on the fifth day they saw, stretched at their feet, a rich flat country dotted with villages, beyond which extended the long blue line of the sea. The distance was greater than Charlie imagined, and 'twas only after two days' long ride that he reached Calicut, where he was received with great honor by the rajah, to whom the leader of the escort brought letters of introduction from the Rajah of Ambur.",several day party ride hill incident fifth day see stretch foot rich flat country dot village extend long blue line sea distance great imagine day long ride reach receive great honor leader escort bring letter introduction 
48,"For four days Charlie remained as his guest, and then took a passage in a large native vessel, bound for Ceylon, whence he would have no difficulty in obtaining passage to Madras.",day remain guest take passage large native vessel bind have difficulty obtain passage 
49,"These native ships are very high out of water, rising considerably towards the stem and stern, and in form they somewhat resemble the Chinese junk; but are without the superabundance of grotesque painting, carving, and gilding which distinguish the latter. The rajah accompanied Charlie to the shore, and a salute was fired, by his followers, in honor of the departure of the guest.",native ship high water rise stem stern form resemble chinese junk superabundance grotesque painting carving gild distinguish latter accompany shore salute fire follower honor departure guest 
50,"The weather was lovely, and the clumsy craft, with all sail set, was soon running down the coast. When they had sailed some hours from Calicut, from behind a headland, four vessels suddenly made their appearance. They were lower in the water, and much less clumsy in appearance than the ordinary native craft, and were propelled not only by their sails, but by a number of oars on each side.",weather lovely clumsy craft sail set run coast sail hour headland vessel make appearance low water clumsy appearance ordinary native craft propel sail number oar side 
51,"No sooner did the captain and crew of the ship behold these vessels, than they raised a cry of terror and despair. The captain, who was part owner of the craft, ran up and down the deck like one possessed, and the sailors seemed scarcely less terrified.",captain crew ship behold vessel raise cry terror despair captain part owner craft run deck possess sailor seem terrified 
52,"""What on earth is the matter?"" Charlie exclaimed. ""What vessels are those, and why are you afraid of them?""",earth matter exclaim vessel afraid
