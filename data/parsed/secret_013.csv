12,"The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a far-off faint sound of fretful crying.  She listened for a few minutes and each minute she became more and more sure.  She felt as if she must find out what it was.  It seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key.  Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold.

She thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry--the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost herself.  The sound had come up that passage.  So she went on with her dim light, almost feeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could hear it.  The far-off faint crying went on and led her.  Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was this the right corner to turn? She stopped and thought.  Yes it was.
