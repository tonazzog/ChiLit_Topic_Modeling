1,CHAPTER II. CAPTAIN JACK.,
2,"  ""It has been our lot to sail with many captains, not one   of whom is fit to be a patch on your back.""--_Letter of   the Ship's Company of H. M. S. S. Royalist to Captain W.   T. Bate._",lot sail many captain fit patch back letter 
3," All this time the albatross kept dropping down and down like a stone, till Jack was quite out of breath, and they fell or flew, whichever you like to call it, straight through one of the great chasms which he had thought were lakes, and he looked down, as he sat on the bird's back, to see what the world is like when you hang a good way above it at sunrise.",time albatross keep drop stone breath fall fly like call great chasm think lake look sit bird back see world hang good way sunrise 
4,"It was a very beautiful sight; the sheep and lambs were still fast asleep on the green hills, and the sea-birds were asleep in long rows upon the ledges of the cliffs, with their heads under their wings.",beautiful sight sheep lamb fast asleep green hill sea bird asleep long row ledge cliff head wing 
5,"""Are those young fairies awake yet?"" asked the albatross.",young fairy awake ask albatross 
6,"""As sound asleep as ever,"" answered Jack; ""but, Albatross, is not that the sea which lies under us? You are a sea-bird, I know, but I am not a sea boy, and I cannot live in the water.""",sound asleep answer sea lie sea bird know sea boy live water 
7,"""Yes, that is the sea,"" answered the albatross. ""Don't you observe that it is covered with ships?""",sea answer albatross observe cover ship 
8,"""I see boats and vessels,"" answered Jack, ""and all their sails are set, but they cannot sail, because there is no wind.""",see boat vessel answer sail set sail be wind 
9,"""The wind never does blow in this great bay,"" said the bird; ""and those ships would all lie there becalmed till they dropped to pieces if one of them was not wanted now and then to go up the wonderful river.""",wind blow great bay say bird ship lie becalm drop piece want go wonderful river 
10,"""But how did they come there?"" asked Jack.",come ask 
11,"""Some of them had captains who ill-used their cabin-boys, some were pirate ships, and others were going out on evil errands. The consequence was, that when they chanced to sail within this great bay they got becalmed; the fairies came and picked all the sailors out and threw them into the water; they then took away the flags and pennons to make their best coats of, threw the ship-biscuits and other provisions to the fishes, and set all the sails. Many ships which are supposed by men to have foundered lie becalmed in this quiet sea. Look at those five grand ones with high prows; they are moored close together; they were part of the Spanish Armada: and those open boats with blue sails belonged to the Romans; they sailed with CÃ¦sar when he invaded Britain.""",have captain ill use cabin boy pirate ship other go evil errand consequence chance sail great bay becalm fairy come pick sailor throw water take flag pennon make good coat throw ship biscuit other provision fish set sail many ship suppose man founder lie becalm quiet sea look grand one high prow moor part spanish open boat blue sail belong sail invade 
12,"By this time the albatross was hovering about among the vessels, making choice of one to take Jack and the fairies up the wonderful river.",time albatross hover vessel make choice take fairy wonderful river 
13,"""It must not be a large one,"" she said, ""for the river in some places is very shallow.""",large one say river place shallow 
14,"Jack would have liked very much to have a fine three-master, all to himself; but then he considered that he did not know anything about sails and rigging; he thought it would be just as well to be contented with whatever the albatross might choose, so he let her set him down in a beautiful little open boat, with a great carved figure-head to it. There he seated himself in great state, and the albatross perched herself on the next bench, and faced him.",like much have fine master consider know sail rigging think content albatross choose let set beautiful little open boat great carve figure head seat great state albatross perch next bench face 
15,"""You remember my name?"" asked the albatross.",remember name ask albatross 
16,"""Oh yes,"" said Jack; but he was not attending,--he was thinking what a fine thing it was to have such a curious boat all to himself.",say attend think fine thing have curious boat 
17,"""That's well,"" answered the bird; ""then, in the next place, are those fairies awake yet?""",well answer bird next place fairy awake 
18,"""No, they are not,"" said Jack; and he took them out of his pockets, and laid them down in a row before the albatross.",say take pocket lay row albatross 
19,"""They are certainly asleep,"" said the bird. ""Put them away again, and take great care of them. Mind you don't lose any of them, for I really don't know what will happen if you do. Now I have one thing more to say to you, and that is, are you hungry?""",asleep say bird put take great care mind lose know happen have thing more say hungry 
20,"""Rather,"" said Jack.",say 
21,"""Then,"" replied the albatross, ""as soon as you feel _very_ hungry, lie down in the bottom of the boat and go to sleep. You will dream that you see before you a roasted fowl, some new potatoes, and an apple-pie. Mind you don't eat too much in your dream, or you will be sorry for it when you wake. That is all. Good-by! I must go.""",reply albatross feel hungry lie bottom boat go sleep dream see roast fowl new potato apple pie mind eat much dream sorry wake good go 
22,"Jack put his arms round the neck of the bird, and hugged her; then she spread her magnificent wings and sailed slowly away. At first he felt very lonely, but in a few minutes he forgot that, because the little boat began to swim so fast.",put arm neck bird hugge spread magnificent wing sail first feel lonely few minute forget little boat begin swim 
23,"She was not sailing, for she had no sail, and he was not rowing, for he had no oars; so I am obliged to call her motion swimming, because I don't know of a better word. In less than a quarter of an hour they passed close under the bows of a splendid three-decker, a seventy-gun ship. The gannets who live in those parts had taken possession of her, and she was so covered with nests that you could not have walked one step on her deck without treading on them. The father birds were aloft in the rigging, or swimming in the warm, green sea, and they made such a clamor when they saw Jack that they nearly woke the fairies,--nearly, but not quite, for the little things turned round in Jack's pockets, and sneezed, and began to snore again.",sail have sail row have oar oblige call motion swim know good word less quarter hour pass bow splendid decker gun ship gannet live part take possession cover nest walk step deck tread father bird aloft rigging swim warm green sea make clamor see wake fairy little thing turn pocket sneez begin snore 
24,"Then the boat swam past a fine brig. Some sea fairies had just flung her cargo overboard, and were playing at leap-frog on deck. These were not at all like Jack's own fairies; they were about the same height and size as himself, and they had brown faces, and red flannel shirts and red caps on. A large fleet of the pearly nautilus was collected close under the vessel's lee. The little creatures were feasting on what the sea fairies had thrown overboard, and Jack's boat, in its eagerness to get on, went plunging through them so roughly that several were capsized. Upon this the brown sea fairies looked over, and called out angrily, ""Boat ahoy!"" and the boat stopped.",boat swim fine brig sea fairy flung cargo play leap frog deck own fairy same height size have brown face red flannel shirt red cap large fleet pearly nautilus collect close vessel little creature feast sea fairy throw boat eagerness get go plung several capsize brown sea fairy look call boat stop 
25,"""Tell that boat of yours to mind what she is about,"" said the fairy sea-captain to Jack.",tell boat mind say fairy sea captain 
26,"Jack touched his hat, and said, ""Yes, sir,"" and then called out to his boat, ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself, running down these little live fishing-vessels so carelessly. Go at a more gentle pace.""",touch hat say sir call boat ashamed run little live fishing vessel go gentle pace 
27,"So it swam more slowly; and Jack, being by this time hungry, curled himself up in the bottom of the boat, and fell asleep.",swim time hungry curl bottom boat fall asleep 
28,"He dreamt directly about a fowl and some potatoes, and he ate a wing, and then he ate a merry-thought, and then somebody said to him that he had better not eat any more, but he did,--he ate another wing; and presently an apple-pie came, and he ate some of that, and then he ate some more, and then he immediately woke.",dreamt fowl potato eat wing eat merry thought say eat more eat wing apple pie come eat eat more wake 
29,"""Now that bird told me not to eat too much,"" said Jack, ""and yet I have done it. I never felt so full in my life;"" and for more than half an hour he scarcely noticed anything.",bird tell eat say do feel full life more hour notice 
30,"At last he lifted up his head, and saw straight before him two great brown cliffs, and between them flowed in the wonderful river. Other rivers flow out, but this river flowed in, and took with it far into the land dolphins, sword-fish, mullet, sun-fish, and many other strange creatures; and that is one reason why it was called the magic river, or the wonderful river.",last lift head see great brown cliff flow wonderful river other river flow river flow take land dolphin sword fish mullet sun fish many other strange creature reason call magic river wonderful river 
31,"At first it was rather wide, and Jack was alarmed to see what multitudes of soldiers stood on either side to guard the banks, and prevent any person from landing.",first wide alarm see multitude soldier stand side guard bank prevent person land 
32,"He wondered how he should get the fairies on shore. However, in about an hour the river became much narrower, and then Jack saw that the guards were not real soldiers, but rose-colored flamingoes. There they stood, in long regiments, among the reeds, and never stirred. They are the only foot-soldiers the fairies have in their pay; they are very fierce, and never allow anything but a fairy ship to come up the river.",wonder get fairy shore hour river become narrower see guard real soldier rose color flamingoe stand long regiment reed stirr only foot soldier fairy have pay fierce allow fairy ship come river 
33,"They guarded the banks for miles and miles, many thousands of them, standing a little way into the water among the flags and rushes; but at last there were no more reeds and no soldier guards, for the stream became narrower, and flowed between such steep rocks that no one could possibly have climbed them.",guard bank mile mile many thousand stand little way water flag rushe last be more reed soldier guard stream become narrower flow such steep rock climb
