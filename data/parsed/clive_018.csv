1,CHAPTER 17. The Capture Of Gheriah.,
2," After having sat for an hour under the shade of some trees, and partaken of luncheon, the party again moved forward on their elephants to the jungle. The watchers declared that no sound, whatever, had been heard during their absence; nor did the discharge of fireworks, which at once recommenced, elicit the slightest response.",sit hour shade tree partake luncheon party move elephant jungle watcher declare sound hear absence discharge firework recommence elicit slight response 
3,"After this had gone on for half an hour, Charlie, convinced that the animal was dead, dismounted from his elephant. He had with him a heavy, double-barrelled rifle of the rajah's; and Hossein, carrying a similar weapon, and a curved tulwar which was sharpened almost to a razor edge, prepared to follow immediately behind him. Three or four of the most courageous shikaris, with cocked guns, followed in Hossein's steps.",go hour convince animal dead dismount elephant have heavy double barrell rifle carry similar weapon curved tulwar sharpen razor edge prepare follow courageous shikaris cocked gun follow step 
4,"Holding his gun advanced before him, in readiness to fire instantly, Charlie entered the jungle at the point where the tiger had retreated into it. Drops of blood spotted the grass, and the bent and twisted brushwood showed the path that the tiger had taken. Charlie moved as noiselessly as possible. The path led straight forward, towards the rocks behind, but it was not until within four or five yards of this that any sign of the tiger could be seen.",holding gun advance readiness fire enter jungle point tiger retreat drop blood spot grass bend twist brushwood show path tiger take move possible path lead rock yard sign tiger see 
5,"Then the bushes were burst asunder, and the great yellow body hurled itself forward upon Charlie. The attack was so sudden and instantaneous that the latter had not even time to raise his rifle to his shoulder. Almost instinctively, however, he discharged both of the barrels; but was, at the same moment, hurled to the ground, where he lay crushed down by the weight of the tiger, whose hot breath he could feel on his face. He closed his eyes, only to open them again at the sound of a heavy blow, while a deluge of hot blood flowed over him. He heard Hossein's voice, and then became insensible. When he recovered, he found himself lying with his head supported by Hossein, outside the jungle.",bush burst great yellow body hurl attack sudden instantaneous latter time raise rifle shoulder discharge barrel same moment hurl ground crush weight tiger hot breath feel face close eye open sound heavy blow deluge hot blood flow hear voice become insensible recover find lie head support jungle 
6,"""Is he dead?"" he asked faintly.",dead ask 
7,"""He is dead, Sahib,"" Hossein replied. ""Let the Sahib drink some brandy, and he will be strong again.""",dead reply let drink brandy strong 
8,"Charlie drank some brandy and water, which Hossein held to his lips. Then the latter raised him to his feet.",drink brandy water hold lip latter raise foot 
9,"Charlie felt his limbs and his ribs. He was bruised all over, but otherwise unhurt, the blood which covered him having flowed from the tiger. One of the balls which he had fired had entered the tiger's neck, the other had broken one of its forelegs, and Charlie had been knocked down by the weight of the animal, not by the blow of its formidable paw.",feel limb rib bruise unhurt blood cover flow tiger ball fire enter tiger neck other break foreleg knock weight animal blow formidable paw 
10,"Hossein had sprung forward on the instant, and with one blow of his sharp tulwar, had shorn clear through skin and muscle and bone, and had almost severed the tiger's head from its body. It was the weight upon him which had crushed Charlie into a state of insensibility. Here he had lain, for four or five minutes, before Hossein could get the frightened natives to return, and assist him to lift the great carcass from his master's body.",spring instant blow sharp tulwar shorn clear skin muscle bone sever tiger head body weight crush state insensibility lain minute get frighten native return assist lift great carcass master body 
11,"Upon examination, it was found that two of the three bullets first fired had taken effect. One had broken the tiger's shoulder, and lodged in his body. The other had struck him fairly on the chest, and had passed within an inch or two of his heart.",examination find bullet fire take effect break tiger shoulder lodg body other strike chest pass inch heart 
12,"""I thought,"" Ramajee Punt said, as he viewed the body, ""that one of his legs must have been rendered useless. That was why he lay quiet so long, in spite of our efforts to turn him out.""",think say view body leg render useless lay quiet spite effort turn 
13,"Charlie was too much hurt to walk, and a litter was speedily formed, and he was carried back to the camp, where his arrival in that state excited the most lively lamentations on the part of Tim. The next morning he was much recovered; and was able, in the cool of the evening, to take his place in a howdah, and to return to the camp before Gheriah.",hurt walk litter form carry camp arrival state excite lively lamentation part next morning recover able cool evening take place howdah return camp 
14,"A few days later the fleet made its appearance off the town, and the same evening Tulagi Angria rode up to Ramajee Punt's camp. Charlie was present at the interview, at which Angria endeavoured to prevail on Ramajee Punt, and Charlie, to accept a large ransom for his fort; offering them each great presents, if they would do their utmost to prevail on Admiral Watson, and Colonel Clive, to agree to accept it.",few day fleet make appearance town same evening ride camp present interview endeavour prevail accept large ransom fort offer great present do utmost prevail agree accept 
15,"Charlie said at once that he was sure it was useless, that the English had now made a great effort to put a stop to the ravages which he, and his father before him, had for so many years inflicted upon their commerce; and that he was sure that nothing, short of the total destruction of the fort and fleet, would satisfy them. The meeting then broke up; and Charlie, supposing that Angria would return immediately, went back to his tent; where he directed Hossein at once to mingle with the men who had accompanied Angria, and to find out anything that he could concerning the state of things in the fort.",say sure useless make great effort put stop ravage father have many year inflict commerce sure short total destruction fort fleet satisfy meeting break suppose return go tent direct mingle man accompany find concern state thing fort 
16,Hossein returned an hour later.,return hour 
17,"""Sahib,"" he said, ""Ramajee Punt is thinking of cheating the English. He is keeping Angria a prisoner. He says that he came into his camp without asking for a safe conduct; and that, therefore, he shall detain him.",say think cheating keep prisoner say come camp ask safe conduct detain 
18,"""But this is not all. Angria has left his brother in command of the fort; and Ramajee, by threatening Angria with instant execution, has induced him to send an order to deliver the fort at once to him. Ramajee wants, you see, Sahib, to get all the plunder of the fort for himself, and his Mahrattas.""",leave brother command fort threaten instant execution induce send order deliver fort want see get plunder fort 
19,"""This is very serious,"" Charlie said, ""and I must let the admiral know, at once, what is taking place.""",serious say let admiral know take place 
20,"When it became dark, Charlie, with Tim and Hossein, made his way through the Mahratta camp, down to the shore of the river. Here were numbers of boats, hauled up on the sand. One of the lightest of these was soon got into the water, and rowed gently out into the force of the stream. Then the oars were shipped, and they lay down perfectly quiet in the boat, and drifted past the fort without being observed.",become dark make way camp shore river number boat haul sand light get water row force stream oar ship lay quiet boat drift fort observe 
21,"When they once gained the open sea, the oars were placed in the rowlocks, and half an hour's rowing brought them alongside the fleet. Charlie was soon on board the flagship, and informed the admiral, and Colonel Clive, what Hossein had heard.",gain open sea oar place rowlock hour rowing bring fleet board flagship inform admiral hear 
22,"It was at once resolved to attack upon the following day. The two officers did not think it was likely that the pirates would, even in obedience to their chief's orders, surrender the place until it had been battered by the fleet.",resolve attack follow day officer think likely pirate obedience chief order surrender place batter fleet 
23,"The next morning, the fort was summoned to surrender. No answer was received, and as soon as the sea breeze set in, in the afternoon, the fleet weighed anchor and proceeded towards the mouth of the river. The men-of-war were in line, on the side nearest to the fort, to protect the mortar vessels and smaller ships from its fire.",next morning fort summon surrender answer receive sea breeze set afternoon fleet weigh anchor proceed mouth river man war line side near fort protect mortar vessel small ship fire 
24,"Passing the point of the promontory, they stood into the river, and anchored at a distance of fifty yards from the north face of the fort. A gun from the admiral's ship gave the signal, and a hundred and fifty pieces of cannon at once opened fire, while the mortar vessels threw shell into the fort and town. In ten minutes after the fire began, a shell fell into one of Angria's large ships, and set her on fire. The flames soon spread to the others, fastened together on either side of her, and in less than an hour this fleet, which had for fifty years been the terror of the Malabar coast, was utterly destroyed.",pass point promontory stand river anchore distance yard north face fort gun admiral ship give signal piece can open fire mortar vessel throw shell fort town minute fire begin shell fall large ship set fire flame spread other fasten side less hour fleet year terror coast destroy 
25,"In the meantime the fleet kept up their fire, with the greatest vigour, upon the enemy's works; and, before nightfall, the enemy's fire was completely silenced. No white flag, however, was hung up, and the admiral had little doubt that it was intended to surrender the place to the Mahrattas.",meantime fleet keep fire great vigour enemy work nightfall enemy fire silence white flag hang admiral have little doubt intend surrender place 
26,"As soon, therefore, as it became quite dark, Colonel Clive landed with the troops, and took up a position between the Mahrattas and the fort; where, to his great disappointment and disgust, Ramajee Punt found him in the morning. The admiral again summoned the fort, declaring that he would renew the attack, and give no quarter, unless it was surrendered immediately. The governor sent back to beg the admiral to cease from hostilities until next day, as he was only waiting for orders from Angria to surrender. Angria declared that he had already sent the orders.",become dark land troops take position fort great disappointment disgust find morning admiral summon fort declare renew attack give quarter surrender governor send beg admiral cease hostility next day wait order surrender declare send order 
27,"At four in the afternoon, therefore, the bombardment was renewed; and in less than half an hour, a white flag appeared above the wall. As, however, the garrison made no further sign of surrender, and refused to admit Colonel Clive with his troops, when he advanced to take possession, the bombardment was again renewed, more vigorously than ever. The enemy were unable to support the violence of the fire, and soon shouted over the walls, to Clive, that they surrendered; and he might enter and take possession. He at once marched in, and the pirates laid down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners.",afternoon bombardment renew less hour white flag appear wall garrison make further sign surrender refuse admit troops advance take possession bombardment renew enemy unable support violence fire shout wall surrender enter take possession march pirate lay arm surrender prisoner 
28,"It was found that a great part of the fortifications had been destroyed by the fire, but a resolute garrison might have held the fort, itself, against a long siege. Two hundred guns fell into the hands of the captors, together with great quantities of ammunition, and stores of all kinds. The money and effects amounted to a hundred and twenty thousand pounds, which was divided among the captors. The rest of Angria's fleet, among them two large ships on the stocks, was destroyed.",find great part fortification destroy fire resolute garrison hold fort long siege gun fall hand captor great quantity ammunition store kind money effect amount pound divide captor rest fleet large ship stock destroy 
29,"Ramajee Punt sent parties of his troops to attack the other forts held by the pirates. These, however, surrendered without resistance, and thus the whole country, which the pirates had held for seventy years, fell again into the hands of the Mahrattas, from whom they had wrested it.",send party troops attack other fort hold pirate surrender resistance whole country pirate hold year fall hand wrest 
30,"Admiral Watson and the fleet then returned to Bombay, in order to repair the damages which had been inflicted upon them during the bombardment. There were great rejoicings upon their arrival there; the joy of the inhabitants, both European and native, being immense at the destruction of the formidable pirate colonies, which had so long ravaged the seas.",fleet return order repair damage inflict bombardment be great rejoicing arrival joy inhabitant european native immense destruction formidable pirate colony ravage sea 
31,"After the repairs were completed, the fleet, with the troops which had formed the expedition, were to sail for Madras. Charlie, however, did not wait for this; but, finding that one of the Company's ships would sail, in the course of a few days after their return to Bombay, he obtained leave from Colonel Clive to take a passage in her, and to proceed immediately to Madras. Tim and Hossein, of course, accompanied him; and the voyage down the west coast of India, and round Ceylon, was performed without any marked incident.",repair complete fleet troops form expedition sail wait find company ship sail course few day return obtain leave take passage proceed course accompany voyage west coast perform mark incident 
32,"When within but a few hours of Madras, the barometer fell rapidly. Great clouds rose up upon the horizon, and the captain ordered all hands aloft to reduce sail.",few hour barometer fall great cloud rise horizon captain order hand reduce sail 
33,"""We are in,"" he said, ""for a furious tempest. It is the breaking up of the monsoon. It is a fortnight earlier than usual. I had hoped that we should have got safely up the Hoogly before it began.""",say furious tempest breaking monsoon fortnight usual hope get begin 
34,"Half an hour later the hurricane struck them, and for the next three days the tempest was terrible. Great waves swept over the ship, and every time that the captain attempted to show a rag of canvas, it was blown from the bolt ropes. The ship, however, was a stout one, and weathered the gale.",hour hurricane strike next day tempest terrible great wave sweep ship time captain attempt show rag canvas blow bolt rope ship stout one weather gale 
35,"Upon the fourth morning the passengers, who had, during the tempest, been battened below, came on deck. The sky was bright and clear, and the waves were fast going down. A good deal of sail was already set, and the hands were at work to repair damages.",fourth morning passenger tempest batten come deck sky bright clear wave fast go good deal sail set hand work repair damage 
36,"""Well, captain,"" Charlie said to that officer, ""I congratulate you on the behaviour of the ship. It has been a tremendous gale, and she has weathered it stoutly.""",captain say officer congratulate behaviour ship tremendous gale weather 
37,"""Yes, Captain Marryat, she has done well. I have only once or twice been out in so severe a storm, since I came to sea.""",do severe storm come sea 
38,"""And where are we now?"" Charlie asked, looking round the horizon. ""When shall we be at Madras?""",ask look horizon 
39,"""Well,"" the captain said with a smile, ""I am afraid that you must give up all idea of seeing Madras, just at present. We have been blown right up the bay, and are only a few hours' sail from the mouth of the Hoogly. I have a far larger cargo for that place than for Madras, and it would be a pure waste of time for me to put back now. I intend, therefore, to go to Calcutta first, discharge and fill up there, and then touch at Madras on my way back.",captain say smile afraid give idea see present blow bay few hour sail mouth have large cargo place pure waste time put intend go discharge fill touch way 
40,"""I suppose it makes no great difference to you.""",suppose make great difference 
41,"""No, indeed,"" Charlie said. ""And I am by no means sorry of the opportunity of getting a glimpse of Calcutta, which I might never otherwise have done. I believe things are pretty quiet at Madras, at present; and I have been so long away, now, that a month or two sooner or later will make but little difference.""",say means sorry opportunity get glimpse do believe thing quiet present long month make little difference 
42,"A few hours later, Charlie noticed a change in the colour of the sea, the mud-stained waters of the Hoogly discolouring the Bay of Bengal, far out from its mouth. The voyage up was a tedious one. At times the wind fell altogether and, unable to stem the stream, the ship lay for days at anchor, the yellow tide running swiftly by it.",few hour notice change colour sea mud stain water discolour mouth voyage up tedious one time wind fall unable stem stream ship lay day anchor yellow tide run 
43,"""The saints presarve us, Mr. Charles! Did you ever see the like?"" Tim Kelly exclaimed. ""There's another dead body, floating down towards us, and that is the eighth I've seen this morning. Are the poor hathen craturs all committing suicide together?""",saint presarve see like exclaim be dead body float eighth see morning poor hathen cratur commit suicide 
44,"""Not at all, Tim,"" Charlie said, ""the Hoogly is one of the sacred rivers of India, and the people on its banks, instead of burying their dead, put them into the river and let them drift away.""",say sacred river person bank bury dead put river let drift 
45,"""I calls it a bastly custom, yer honor, and I wonder it is allowed. One got athwart the cable this morning, and it frightened me nigh out of my sinses, when I happened to look over the bow, and saw the thing bobbing up and down in the water.",call bastly custom honor wonder allow get cable morning frighten sinse happen look bow see thing bob water 
46,"""This is tedious work, yer honor, and I'll be glad when we're at the end of the voyage.""",tedious work honor glad end voyage

48,"In a few minutes, the ship was under way again, and the same night dropped her anchor in the stream, abreast of Calcutta. Charlie shortly after landed, and, proceeding to the Company's offices, reported his arrival, and that of the four Sepoy officers. Hossein, who was not in the Company's service, was with him merely in the character of a servant.",few minute ship way same night drop anchor stream land proceed office report arrival sepoy officer service character servant 
49,"As the news of the share Charlie had had in the capture of Suwarndrug had reached Calcutta, he was well received; and one of the leading merchants of the town, Mr. Haines, who happened to be present when Charlie called upon the governor, at once invited him warmly to take up his residence with him, during his stay. Hospitality in India was profuse, and general. Hotels were unknown, and a stranger was always treated as an honored guest.",news share have capture reach receive lead merchant town happen present call governor invite take residence stay hospitality profuse general hotel unknown stranger treat honor guest 
50,"Charlie, therefore, had no hesitation whatever in accepting the offer. The four native officers were quartered in the barracks; and, returning on board ship, Charlie, followed by Tim and Hossein, and by some coolies bearing his luggage, was soon on his way to the bungalow of Mr. Haines.",have hesitation accept offer native officer quarter barrack return board ship follow cooly bear luggage way bungalow 
51,"On his way, he was surprised at the number and size of the dwellings of the merchants and officials, which offered a very strong contrast to the quiet and unpretending buildings round the fort of Madras. The house of Mr. Haines was a large one, and stood in a large and carefully kept garden. Mr. Haines received him at the door, and at once led him to his room, which was spacious, cool, and airy. Outside was a wide veranda, upon which, in accordance with the customs of the country, servants would sleep.",way surprise number size dwelling merchant official offer strong contrast quiet unpretending building fort house large one stand large keep garden receive door lead room spacious cool airy wide veranda accordance custom country servant sleep 
52,"""Here is your bathroom,"" Mr. Haines said, pointing to an adjoining room. ""I think you will find everything ready. We dine in half an hour.""",bathroom say point adjoin room think find ready dine hour 
53,"Charlie was soon in his bath, a luxury which, in India, every European indulges in at least twice a day. Then in his cool white suit, which at that time formed the regular evening dress, he found his way to the drawing room. Here he was introduced to the merchant's wife, and to his daughter, a girl of some thirteen years old, as well as to several guests who had arrived for dinner.",bath luxury indulge least day cool white suit time form regular evening dress find way draw room introduce merchant wife daughter girl year old several guest arrive dinner 
54,"The meal was a pleasant one, and Charlie, after being cooped up for some weeks on board ship, enjoyed it much. A dinner in India is, to one unaccustomed to it, a striking sight. The punkah waving slowly to and fro, overhead, drives the cool air which comes in through the open windows down upon the table. Each guest brings his own servant, who, either in white or coloured robes, and in turbans of many different hues and shapes, according to the wearer's caste, stands behind his master's chair. The light is always a soft one, and the table richly garnished with bright-coloured tropical flowers.",meal pleasant one coop week board ship enjoy much dinner unaccustomed strike sight punkah wave for drive cool air come open window table guest bring own servant white coloured robe turban many different hue shape accord wearer caste stand master chair light soft one table garnish bright coloured tropical flower 
55,"Charlie was the hero of the hour, and was asked many questions concerning the capture of Suwarndrug; and also about the defence of Ambur, which, though now an old story, had excited the greatest interest through India. Presently, however, the conversation turned to local topics; and Charlie learned, from the anxious looks and earnest tones of the speakers, that the situation was considered a very serious one. He asked but few questions, then; but after the guests had retired, and Mr. Haines proposed to him to smoke one more quiet cigar, in the cool of the veranda, before retiring to bed; he took the opportunity of asking his host to explain to him the situation, with which he had no previous acquaintance.",hero hour ask many question concern capture defence old story excite great interest conversation turn local topic learn anxious look earnest tone speaker situation consider serious one ask few question guest retire propose smoke more quiet cigar cool veranda retire bed take opportunity ask host explain situation have previous acquaintance 
56,"""Up to the death of Ali Kerdy, the old viceroy of Bengal, on the 9th April, we were on good terms with our native neighbours. Calcutta has not been, like Madras, threatened by the rivalry of a European neighbour. The French and Dutch, indeed, have both trading stations like our own, but none of us have taken part in native affairs. Ali Kerdy has been all powerful, there have been no native troubles, and therefore no reason for our interference. We have just gone on as for many years previously, as a purely trading company.",death old viceroy 9th good term native neighbour threaten rivalry european neighbour french dutch have trading station own take part native affair powerful be native trouble reason interference go many year trading company 
57,"""At his death, he was succeeded in the government by Suraja Dowlah, his grandson. I suppose, in all India, there is no prince with a worse reputation than this young scoundrel has already gained for himself, for profligacy and cruelty. He is constantly drunk, and is surrounded by a crew of reprobates, as wicked as himself. At the death of Ali Kerdy, Sokut Jung, another grandson of Ali, set up in opposition to him, and the new viceroy raised a large force to march against him. As the reputation of Sokut Jung was as infamous as that of his cousin, it would have made little difference to us which of the two obtained the mastery.",death succeed government grandson suppose be prince bad reputation young scoundrel gain profligacy cruelty drunk surround crew reprobate wicked death grandson set opposition new viceroy raise large force march reputation infamous cousin make little difference obtain mastery 
58,"""Within the last few days, however, circumstances have occurred which have completely altered the situation. The town of Dacca was, about a year ago, placed under the governorship of Rajah Ragbullub, a Hindoo officer in high favour with Ali Kerdy. His predecessor had been assassinated and plundered, by order of Suraja Dowlah; and when he heard of the accession of that prince, he determined at once to fly, as he knew that his great wealth would speedily cause him to be marked out as a victim. He therefore obtained a letter of recommendation from Mr. Watts, the agent of the Company at their factory at Cossimbazar; and sent his son Kissendas, with a large retinue, his family and treasures, to Calcutta.",last few day circumstance occur alter situation town year place governorship hindoo officer high favour predecessor assassinate plunder order hear accession prince determine fly know great wealth cause mark victim obtain letter recommendation agent factory send son large retinue family treasure 
59,"""Two or three days after his accession, Suraja Dowlah despatched a letter to Mr. Drake, our governor, ordering him to surrender Kissendas and the treasures immediately. The man whom he sent down arrived in a small boat, without any state or retinue; and Mr. Drake, believing that he was an impostor, paid no attention to the demand, but expelled him from the settlement. Two days ago a letter came from the viceroy; or, as we generally call him, the nabob, to Mr. Drake, ordering him instantly to demolish all the fortifications which he understood he had been erecting. Mr. Drake has sent word back, assuring the nabob that he is erecting no new fortifications, but simply executing some repairs in the ramparts facing the river, in view of the expected war between England and France.",day accession despatch letter governor order surrender treasure man send arrive small boat state retinue believe impostor pay attention demand expel settlement day letter come viceroy call nabob order demolish fortification understand erect send word assure nabob erect new fortification execute repair rampart face river view expect war

61,"""But how do we stand here?"" Charlie asked. ""What are the means of defence, supposing he should take it into his head to march, with the army which he has raised to fight against his cousin, to the attack of Calcutta?""",stand ask means defence suppose take head march army raise fight cousin attack 
62,"""Nothing could be worse than our position,"" Mr. Haines said. ""Ever since the capture of Madras, nine years ago, the directors have been sending out orders that this place should be put in a state of defence. During the fifty years which have passed peacefully here, the fortifications have been entirely neglected. Instead of the space round them being kept clear, warehouses have been built close against them, and the fort is wholly unable to resist any attack. The authorities of the Company here have done absolutely nothing to carry out the orders from home. They think, I am sorry to say, only of making money with their own trading ventures; and although several petitions have been presented to them, by the merchants here, urging upon them the dangers which might arise at the death of Ali, they have taken no steps whatever, and indeed have treated all warnings with scorn and derision.""",bad position say capture year director send order place put state defence year pass fortification neglect space keep clear warehouse build close fort unable resist attack authority do carry order home think sorry say make money own trading venture several petition present merchant urge danger arise death take step treat warning scorn derision

65,"""What sort of man is your commander?""",sort man commander 
66,"""We have no means of knowing,"" Mr. Haines said. ""His name is Minchin. He is a great friend of the governor's, and has certainly done nothing to counteract the apathy of the authorities. Altogether, to my mind, things look as bad as they possibly can.""",have means know say name great friend governor do counteract apathy authority mind thing look bad 
67,"A week later, on the 15th of June, a messenger arrived with the news that the nabob, with fifty thousand men, was advancing against the town; and that, in two days, he would appear before it. All was confusion and alarm. Charlie at once proceeded to the fort, and placed his services at the disposal of Captain Minchin. He found that officer fussy, and alarmed.",week 15th messenger arrive news nabob man advance town day appear confusion alarm proceed fort place service disposal find officer fussy alarm 
68,"""If I might be permitted to advise,"" Charlie said, ""every available man in the town should be set to work, at once, pulling down all the buildings around the walls. It would be clearly impossible to defend the place when the ramparts are, on all sides, commanded by the musketry fire of surrounding buildings.""",permit advise say available man town set work pull building wall impossible defend place rampart side command musketry fire surround building

70,"""Very well, sir,"" Charlie replied, calmly. ""I have seen a great deal of service, and have taken part in the defence of two besieged towns; while you, I believe, have never seen a shot fired. However, as you're in command you will, of course, take what steps you think fit; but I warn you that, unless those buildings are destroyed, the fort cannot resist an assault for twenty-four hours.""",sir reply see great deal service take part defence besiege town believe see shot fire command course take step think fit warn building destroy fort resist assault hour 
71,"Then, bowing quietly, he retired; and returned to Mr. Haines' house. That gentleman was absent, having gone to the governor's. He did not come back until late in the evening. Charlie passed the time in endeavouring to cheer up Mrs. Haines, and her daughter; assuring them that, if the worst came to the worst, there could be no difficulty in their getting on board ship.",bow retire return house gentleman absent go governor come evening pass time endeavour cheer daughter assure bad come bad be difficulty get board ship 
72,"Mrs. Haines was a woman of much common sense and presence of mind; and, under the influence of Charlie's quiet chat, she speedily recovered her tranquillity. Her daughter Ada, who was a very bright and pretty girl, was even sooner at her ease, and they were laughing and chatting brightly, when Mr. Haines arrived. He looked fagged and dispirited.",woman much common sense presence mind influence quiet chat recover tranquillity daughter bright pretty girl soon ease laugh chat arrive look fagged dispirited 
73,"""Drake is a fool,"" he said. ""Just as, hitherto, he has scoffed at all thought of danger, now he is prostrated at the news that danger is at hand. He can decide on nothing. At one moment he talks of sending messengers to Suraja Dowlah, to offer to pay any sum he may demand, in order to induce him to retire; the next he talks of defending the fort to the last. We can get him to give no orders, to decide on nothing, and the other officials are equally impotent and imbecile.""",fool say scoff thought danger prostrate news danger hand decide moment talk send messenger offer pay sum demand order induce retire next talk defend fort last get give order decide other official impotent imbecile 
74,"On the 18th, the army of the nabob approached. Captain Minchin took his guns and troops a considerable distance beyond the walls, and opened fire upon the enemy. Charlie, enraged and disgusted at the folly of conduct which could only lead to defeat, marched with them as a simple volunteer.",18th army nabob approach take gun troops considerable distance wall open fire enemy enrage disgusted folly conduct lead defeat march simple volunteer 
75,"The result was what he had anticipated. The enemy opened fire with an immensely superior force of artillery. His infantry advanced, and clouds of horsemen swept round the flanks, and menaced the retreat. In a very few minutes, Captain Minchin gave the order to retire; and, abandoning their guns, the English force retreated in all haste to the town.",result anticipate enemy open fire superior force artillery infantry advance cloud horsemen sweep flank menace retreat few minute give order retire abandon gun english force retreat haste town 
76,"Charlie had, on setting out, told Mr. Haines what was certain to occur; and had implored him to send all his valuables, at once, on board ship; and to retire instantly into the fort. Upon the arrival of the troops at the gate, they found it almost blocked with the throng of frightened Europeans, and natives, flying from their houses beyond it to its protection. Scarcely were all the fugitives within, and the gates closed, when the guns of Suraja Dowlah opened upon the fort; and his infantry, taking possession of the houses around it, began a galling musketry fire upon the ramparts.",set tell certain occur implore send valuable board ship retire fort arrival troops gate find block throng frighten native fly house protection fugitive gate close gun open fort infantry take possession house begin gall musketry fire rampart

78,"Within, all was confusion and dismay. In every spot sheltered from the enemy's fire, Europeans and natives were huddled together. There was neither head nor direction. With nightfall the fire ceased, but still Mr. Drake and Captain Minchin were undecided what steps to take. At two o'clock in the morning, they summoned a council of war, at which Charlie was present, and it was decided that the women and children should at once be sent on board.",confusion dismay spot shelter enemy fire native huddle be head direction nightfall fire cease undecided step take o'clock morning summon council war present decide woman child send board 
79,"There should have been no difficulty in carrying this into effect. A large number of merchantmen were lying in the stream, opposite the fort, capable of conveying away in safety the whole of the occupants. Two of the members of the council had, early in the evening, been despatched on board ship to make arrangements for the boats being sent on shore; but these cowardly wretches, instead of doing so, ordered the ships to raise their anchors, and drop two miles farther down the stream. The boats, however, were sent up the river to the fort.",be difficulty carry effect large number merchantmen lie stream fort capable convey safety whole occupant member council evening despatch board ship make arrangement boat send shore cowardly wretche do order ship raise anchor drop mile stream boat send river fort 
80,"The same helpless imbecility, which had characterized every movement, again showed itself. There was no attempt, whatever, at establishing anything like order or method. The watergate was open, and a wild rush of men, women, and children took place down to the boats.",same helpless imbecility characterize movement show be attempt establish order method watergate open wild rush man woman child take place boat 
81,"Charlie was on duty, on the walls. He had already said goodbye to Mrs. Haines and her daughter, and though he heard shouts and screams coming from the watergate, he had no idea what had taken place; until Mr. Haines joined him.",duty wall say goodbye daughter hear shout scream come watergate have idea take place join 
82,"""Have you seen them safely off?"" Charlie asked.",see ask 
83,"""My wife has gone,"" Mr. Haines said. ""My daughter is still here. There has been a horrible scene of confusion. Although the boats were amply sufficient to carry all, no steps whatever had been taken to secure order. The consequence was, there was a wild rush. Women and children were knocked down and trampled upon. They leaped into the boats in such wild haste that several of these were capsized, and numbers of people drowned. I kept close to my wife and child, till we reached the side of the stream. I managed to get my wife into a boat, and then a rush of people separated me from my daughter; and before I could find her again, the remaining boats had all pushed off. Many of the men have gone with them, and among them, I am ashamed to say, several of the officers.",wife go say daughter be horrible scene confusion boat sufficient carry step take secure order consequence be wild rush woman child knock trample leap boat such wild haste several capsize number person drown keep wife child reach side stream manage get wife boat rush person separate daughter find remain boat push many man go ashamed say several officer 
84,"""However, I trust the boats will come up again tomorrow, and take away the rest. Two have remained, a guard having been placed over them, and I hope to get Ada off to her mother, in the morning.""",trust boat come tomorrow take rest remain guard place hope get mother morning 
85,"Towards morning, Mr. Haines again joined Charlie.",morning join 
86,"""What do you think?"" he said. ""Those cowardly villains, Drake and Minchin, have taken the two boats, and gone off on board ship!""",think say cowardly villain take boat go board ship 
87,"""Impossible!"" Charlie exclaimed.",impossible exclaim 
88,"""It is too true,"" Mr. Haines said. ""The names of these cowards should be held as infamous, as long as the English nation exists.",true say name coward hold infamous english nation exist 
89,"""Come, now, we are just assembling to choose a commander. Mr. Peeks is the senior agent; but I think we shall elect Mr. Holwell, who is an energetic and vigorous man.""",come assemble choose commander senior agent think elect energetic vigorous man 
90,"It was as Mr. Haines had expected. Mr. Holwell was elected, and at once took the lead. He immediately assigned to Charlie the command of the troops. Little was done at the council, beyond speaker after speaker rising to express his execration of the conduct of the governor and Captain Minchin.",expect elect take lead assign command troops little do council speaker speaker rise express execration conduct governor 
91,"With daybreak, the enemy's fire recommenced. All day long Charlie hurried from post to post, encouraging his men, and aiding in working the guns. Two or three times, when the enemy showed in masses, as if intending to assault, the fire of the artillery drove them back; and up to nightfall they had gained but little success. The civilians as well as the soldiers had done their duty nobly, but the loss had been heavy, from the fire of the enemy's sharpshooters in the surrounding buildings; and it was evident that, however gallant the defence, the fort could not much longer resist.",daybreak enemy fire recommence day hurry post post encourage man aid work gun time enemy show mass intend assault fire artillery drive nightfall gain little success civilian soldier do duty loss heavy fire enemy sharpshooter surround building evident defence fort resist 
92,"All day long, signals had been kept flying for the fleet, two miles below, to come up to the fort; but although these could be plainly seen, not a ship weighed anchor.",day signal keep fly fleet mile come fort see ship weigh anchor
