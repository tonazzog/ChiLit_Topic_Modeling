3,"Well, we will go: but not, I think, to-day.  Indeed I hardly know how we could get as far as Reading; for all the world is in the hay-field, and even the old horse must go thither too, and take his turn at the hay-cart.  Well, the rocks have been where they are for many a year, and they will wait our leisure patiently enough: but Midsummer and the hay- field will not wait.  Let us take what God gives when He sends it, and learn the lesson that lies nearest to us.  After all, it is more to my old mind, and perhaps to your young mind too, to look at things which are young and fresh and living, rather than things which are old and worn and dead.  Let us leave the old stones, and the old bones, and the old shells, the wrecks of ancient worlds which have gone down into the kingdom of death, to teach us their grand lessons some other day; and let us look now at the world of light and life and beauty, which begins here at the open door, and stretches away over the hay-fields, over the woods, over the southern moors, over sunny France, and sunnier Spain, and over the tropic seas, down to the equator, and the palm-groves of the eternal summer.  If we cannot find something, even at starting from the open door, to teach us about Why and How, we must be very short-sighted, or very shallow-hearted.",go think day know get reading world hay field old horse go take turn hay cart rock many year wait leisure midsummer hay field wait let take give send learn lesson lie near more old mind young mind look thing young fresh live thing old wear dead let leave old stone old bone old shell wreck ancient world go kingdom death teach grand lesson other day let look world light life beauty begin open door stretch hay field wood southern moor sunny sunnier tropic sea equator palm grove eternal summer find start open door teach short sight shallow hearted 
4,"There is the old cock starling screeching in the eaves, because he wants to frighten us away, and take a worm to his children, without our finding out whereabouts his hole is.  How does he know that we might hurt him? and how again does he not know that we shall not hurt him? we, who for five-and-twenty years have let him and his ancestors build under those eaves in peace?  How did he get that quantity of half-wit, that sort of stupid cunning, into his little brain, and yet get no more?  And why (for this is a question of Why, and not of How) does he labour all day long, hunting for worms and insects for his children, while his wife nurses them in the nest?  Why, too, did he help her to build that nest with toil and care this spring, for the sake of a set of nestlings who can be of no gain or use to him, but only take the food out of his mouth?  Simply out of--what shall I call it, my child?--Love; that same sense of love and duty, coming surely from that one Fountain of all duty and all love, which makes your father work for you.  That the mother should take care of her young, is wonderful enough; but that (at least among many birds) the father should help likewise, is (as you will find out as you grow older) more wonderful far.  So there already the old starling has set us two fresh puzzles about How and Why, neither of which we shall get answered, at least on this side of the grave.",be old cock starling screech eave want frighten take worm child find whereabouts hole know hurt know hurt year let ancestor build eave peace get quantity half wit sort stupid cunning little brain get more question labour day hunt worm insect child wife nurse nest help build nest toil care spring sake set nestling gain use take food mouth call child love same sense love duty come duty love make father work mother take care young wonderful least many bird father help find grow old wonderful old starling set fresh puzzle answer least side grave 
5,"Come on, up the field, under the great generous sun, who quarrels with no one, grudges no one, but shines alike upon the evil and the good.  What a gay picture he is painting now, with his light-pencils; for in them, remember, and not in the things themselves the colour lies.  See how, where the hay has been already carried, he floods all the slopes with yellow light, making them stand out sharp against the black shadows of the wood; while where the grass is standing still, he makes the sheets of sorrel-flower blush rosy red, or dapples the field with white oxeyes.",come field great generous sun quarrel grudge shine alike evil good gay picture paint light pencil remember thing colour lie see hay carry flood slope yellow light make stand sharp black shadow wood grass stand make sheet sorrel flower blush rosy red dapple field white oxeye

17,"Ah, there is a proof to us of what men may do if they will only learn the lessons which Madam How can teach them.  There is that boy, fresh from the National School, cutting more grass in a day than six strong mowers could have cut, and cutting it better, too; for the mowing-machine goes so much nearer to the ground than the scythe, that we gain by it two hundredweight of hay on every acre.  And see, too, how persevering old Madam How will not stop her work, though the machine has cut off all the grass which she has been making for the last three months; for as fast as we shear it off, she makes it grow again.  There are fresh blades, here at our feet, a full inch long, which have sprung up in the last two days, for the cattle when they are turned in next week.",be proof man do learn lesson teach be boy fresh national cut more grass day strong mower cut cut good mowing machine go ground scythe gain hundredweight hay acre see persever old stop work machine cut grass make last month shear make grow be fresh blade foot full inch long spring last day cattle turn next week

There is plenty of other work to be done, thank God; and wholesomer and easier work than mowing with a burning sun on their backs, drinking gallons of beer, and getting first hot and then cold across the loins, till they lay in a store of lumbago and sciatica, to cripple them in their old age.  You delight in machinery because it is curious: you should delight in it besides because it does good, and nothing but good, where it is used, according to the laws of Lady Why, with care, moderation, and mercy, and fair-play between man and man.  For example: just as the mowing-machine saves the mowers, the threshing-machine saves the threshers from rheumatism and chest complaints,--which they used to catch in the draught and dust of the unhealthiest place in the whole parish, which is, the old-fashioned barn's floor.  And so, we may hope, in future years all heavy drudgery and dirty work will be done more and more by machines, and people will have more and more chance of keeping themselves clean and healthy, and more and more time to read, and learn, and think, and be true civilised men and women, instead of being mere live ploughs, or live manure-carts, such as I have seen ere now.",busy be plenty other work do thank wholesomer easy work mow burn sun back drink gallon beer get hot cold loin lay store lumbago sciatica cripple old age delight machinery curious delight good good use accord law care moderation mercy fair play man man example mowing machine save mower threshing machine save thresher rheumatism chest complaint use catch draught dust unhealthiest place whole parish old fashioned barn floor hope future year heavy drudgery dirty work do more machine person have more more chance keep clean healthy more more time read learn think true civilised man woman mere live plough live manure cart such see

If you had seen, as I have seen, in foreign lands, poor women, haggard, dirty, grown old before their youth was over, toiling up hill with baskets of foul manure upon their backs, you would have said, as I have said, ""Oh for Madam How to cure that ignorance!  Oh for Lady Why to cure that barbarism!  Oh that Madam How would teach them that machinery must always be cheaper in the long run than human muscles and nerves!  Oh that Lady Why would teach them that a woman is the most precious thing on earth, and that if she be turned into a beast of burden, Lady Why--and Madam How likewise--will surely avenge the wrongs of their human sister!""  There, you do not quite know what I mean, and I do not care that you should.  It is good for little folk that big folk should now and then ""talk over their heads,"" as the saying is, and make them feel how ignorant they are, and how many solemn and earnest questions there are in the world on which they must make up their minds some day, though not yet.  But now we will talk about the hay: or rather do you and the rest go and play in the hay and gather it up, build forts of it, storm them, pull them down, build them up again, shout, laugh, and scream till you are hot and tired.

If people are not happy enough, they are often tempted to do many wrong deeds, and to think many wrong thoughts: and if by God's grace they know the laws of Lady Why, and keep from sin, still unhappiness, if it goes on too long, wears them out, body and mind; and they grow ill and die, of broken hearts, and broken brains, my child; and so at last, poor souls, find ""Rest beneath the Cross.""",like see happy like see tree bird happy know be food medicine happiness person happy tempt do many wrong deed think many wrong thought grace know law keep sin unhappiness go wear body mind grow ill die break heart break brain child last poor soul find

And then they saved the seeds of those fattening wild grasses, and sowed them in fresh spots. Often they made mistakes.  They were careless, and got weeds among the seed--like the buttercups, which do so much harm to this pasture.  Or they sowed on soil which would not suit the seed, and it died.  But at last, after many failures, they have grown so careful and so clever, that you may send to certain shops, saying what sort of soil yours is, and they will send you just the seeds which will grow there, and no other; and then you have a good pasture for as long as you choose to keep it good.",long story show forefather know railroad electricity such simpleton folk think way do man watch natural pasture cattle get fat wild grass do many other part save seed fatten wild grasse sow fresh spot make mistake careless get weed seed buttercup do much harm pasture sow soil suit seed die last many failure grow careful clever send certain shop say sort soil send seed grow other have good pasture choose keep good

We must put into it every year yard-stuff, tank-stuff, guano, bones, and anything and everything of that kin, that Madam How may cook it for us into grass, and cook the grass again into milk and meat.  But if we don't give Madam How material to work on, we cannot expect her to work for us.  And what do you think will happen then?  She will set to work for herself.  The rich grasses will dwindle for want of ammonia (that is smelling salts), and the rich clovers for want of phosphates (that is bone-earth): and in their places will come over the bank the old weeds and grass off the moor, which have not room to get in now, because the ground is coveted already.  They want no ammonia nor phosphates--at all events they have none, and that is why the cattle on the moor never get fat.  So they can live where these rich grasses cannot.  And then they will conquer and thrive; and the Field will turn into Wild once more.",milk course cow sheep horse body drink milk eat meat flesh milk manufactory put year yard stuff tank stuff guano bone kin cook grass cook grass milk meat give material work expect work think happen set work rich grasse dwindle want ammonia smell salt rich clover want phosphate bone earth place come bank old weed grass moor have room get ground covete want ammonia phosphate event have cattle moor get fat live rich grasse conquer thrive field turn more

121,"That moor is a pattern bit left to show what the greater part of this land was like for long ages after it had risen out of the sea; when there was little or nothing on the flat upper moors save heaths, and ling, and club-mosses, and soft gorse, and needle-whin, and creeping willows; and furze and fern upon the brows; and in the bottoms oak and ash, beech and alder, hazel and mountain ash, holly and thorn, with here and there an aspen or a buckthorn (berry-bearing alder as you call it), and everywhere--where he could thrust down his long root, and thrust up his long shoots--that intruding conqueror and insolent tyrant, the bramble. There were sedges and rushes, too, in the bogs, and coarse grass on the forest pastures--or ""leas"" as we call them to this day round here--but no real green fields; and, I suspect, very few gay flowers, save in spring the sheets of golden gorse, and in summer the purple heather.  Such was old England--or rather, such was this land before it was England; a far sadder, damper, poorer land than now.  For one man or one cow or sheep which could have lived on it then, a hundred can live now.  And yet, what it was once, that it might become again,--it surely would round here, if this brave English people died out of it, and the land was left to itself once more.",moor pattern bit leave show great part land long age rise sea be little flat upper moor save heath ling club mosse soft gorse needle whin creep willow furze fern brow bottom oak ash beech alder hazel mountain ash holly thorn aspen buckthorn berry bear alder call thrust long root thrust long shoot intrude conqueror insolent tyrant bramble be sedge rushe bog coarse grass forest pasture lea call day real green field suspect few gay flower save spring sheet golden gorse summer purple heather such old such land sadder damper poorer land man cow sheep live live become brave english person die land leave more 
122,"What would happen then, you may guess for yourself, from what you see happen whenever the land is left to itself, as it is in the wood above. In that wood you can still see the grass ridges and furrows which show that it was once ploughed and sown by man; perhaps as late as the time of Henry the Eighth, when a great deal of poor land, as you will read some day, was thrown out of tillage, to become forest and down once more.  And what is the mount now?  A jungle of oak and beech, cherry and holly, young and old all growing up together, with the mountain ash and bramble and furze coming up so fast beneath them, that we have to cut the paths clear again year by year.  Why, even the little cow-wheat, a very old- world plant, which only grows in ancient woods, has found its way back again, I know not whence, and covers the open spaces with its pretty yellow and white flowers.  Man had conquered this mount, you see, from Madam How, hundreds of years ago.  And she always lets man conquer her, because Lady Why wishes man to conquer: only he must have a fair fight with Madam How first, and try his strength against hers to the utmost.  So man conquered the wood for a while; and it became cornfield instead of forest: but he was not strong and wise enough three hundred years ago to keep what he had conquered; and back came Madam How, and took the place into her own hands, and bade the old forest trees and plants come back again--as they would come if they were not stopped year by year, down from the wood, over the pastures--killing the rich grasses as they went, till they met another forest coming up from below, and fought it for many a year, till both made peace, and lived quietly side by side for ages.",happen guess see happen land leave wood wood see grass ridge furrow show plough sow man time eighth great deal poor land read day throw tillage become forest more mount jungle oak beech cherry holly young old grow mountain ash bramble furze come have cut path clear year year little cow -wheat old world plant grow ancient wood find way know cover open space pretty yellow white flower conquer mount see hundred year let man conquer wish man conquer have fair fight try strength utmost man conquer wood while become cornfield forest strong wise year keep conquer come take place own hand bid old forest tree plant come come stop year year wood pasture kill rich grasse go meet forest come fight many year make peace live side side age

Now, if we and all human beings were to leave this pasture for a few hundred years, would not those alders increase into a wood?  Would they not kill the grass, and spread right and left, seeding themselves more and more as the grass died, and left the ground bare, till they met the oaks and beeches coming down the hill?

128,"Not quite that; though they do beat each other with their boughs, fiercely enough, in a gale of wind; and then the trees who have strong and stiff boughs wound those who have brittle and limp boughs, and so hurt them, and if the storms come often enough, kill them.  But among these trees in a sheltered valley the larger and stronger would kill the weaker and smaller by simply overshadowing their tops, and starving their roots; starving them, indeed, so much when they grow very thick, that the poor little acorns, and beech mast, and alder seeds would not be able to sprout at all.  So they would fight, killing each other's children, till the war ended--I think I can guess how.",beat other bough gale wind tree have strong stiff bough wind have brittle limp bough hurt storm come kill tree shelter valley large strong kill weak small overshadow top starve root starve grow thick poor little acorn beech mast alder seed able sprout fight kill other child war end think guess

So they would venture down the hill only as far as the dry ground lasts, and those who tried to grow any lower would die. But the oaks are hardy, and do not care much where they grow.  So they would fight their way down into the wet ground among the alders and willows, till they came to where their enemies were so thick and tall, that the acorns as they fell could not sprout in the darkness.  And so you would have at last, along the hill-side, a forest of beech and oak, lower down a forest of oak and alder, and along the stream-side alders and willows only.  And that would be a very fair example of the great law of the struggle for existence, which causes the competition of species.",beeche dainty beautiful like get foot wet venture hill dry ground last try grow low die oak hardy care grow fight way wet ground alder willow come enemy thick tall acorn fall sprout darkness last hill side forest beech oak low forest oak alder stream side alder willow fair example great law struggle existence cause competition species

135,"I know it, my child, I know it.  But so it is.  And Madam How, no doubt, would be often very clumsy and very cruel, without meaning it, because she never sees beyond her own nose, or thinks at all about the consequences of what she is doing.  But Lady Why, who does think about consequences, is her mistress, and orders her about for ever.  And Lady Why is, I believe, as loving as she is wise; and therefore we must trust that she guides this great war between living things, and takes care that Madam How kills nothing which ought not to die, and takes nothing away without putting something more beautiful and something more useful in its place; and that even if England were, which God forbid, overrun once more with forests and bramble-brakes, that too would be of use somehow, somewhere, somewhen, in the long ages which are to come hereafter.",know child know doubt clumsy cruel mean see own nose think consequence do think consequence mistress order believe loving wise trust guide great war live thing take care kill die take put beautiful useful place forbid overrun more forest bramble brake use long age come
