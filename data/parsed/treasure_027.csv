1,CHAPTER 28. In the Enemy's Camp,
2,"THE red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house, showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac, there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased my horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge that all had perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to perish with them.",red glare torch light interior block house show bad apprehension realize pirate possession house store be cask cognac be pork bread tenfold increase horror sign prisoner judge perish heart smeat perish 
3,"There were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was left alive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth had only risen upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently dressed. I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.",be buccaneer tell man leave alive foot flush swollen call first sleep drunkenness sixth rise elbow deadly pale blood stain bandage head tell wound dress remember man shoot run wood great attack doubt 
4,"The parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John's shoulder. He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used to. He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood.",parrot sit preening plumage shoulder think look paler stern use wear fine broadcloth suit fulfil mission bad wear daub clay tear sharp brier wood

7,"""Give me a loan of the link, Dick,"" said he; and then, when he had a good light, ""That'll do, lad,"" he added; ""stick the glim in the wood heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn't stand up for Mr. Hawkins; HE'LL excuse you, you may lay to that. And so, Jim""--stopping the tobacco--""here you were, and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old John.

10,"""Now, you see, Jim, so be as you ARE here,"" says he, ""I'll give you a piece of my mind. I've always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit, and the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome. I always wanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my cock, you've got to. Cap'n Smollett's a fine seaman, as I'll own up to any day, but stiff on discipline. 'Dooty is dooty,' says he, and right he is. Just you keep clear of the cap'n. The doctor himself is gone dead again you--'ungrateful scamp' was what he said; and the short and the long of the whole story is about here: you can't go back to your own lot, for they won't have you; and without you start a third ship's company all by yourself, which might be lonely, you'll have to jine with Cap'n Silver.""",see say give piece mind like lad spirit picter own self young handsome want jine take share die gentleman cock get fine seaman own day stiff discipline dooty dooty say right keep clear cap doctor gone dead ungrateful scamp say short long whole story go own lot have start third ship company lonely have jine

My friends, then, were still alive, and though I partly believed the truth of Silver's statement, that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved than distressed by what I heard.",good friend alive believe truth statement cabin party incense desertion relieved distress hear 
12,"""I don't say nothing as to your being in our hands,"" continued Silver, ""though there you are, and you may lay to it. I'm all for argyment; I never seen good come out o' threatening.

17,"""You'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to, my friend,"" cried Silver truculently to this speaker. And then, in his first gracious tones, he replied to me, ""Yesterday morning, Mr. Hawkins,"" said he, ""in the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with a flag of truce. Says he, 'Cap'n Silver, you're sold out. Ship's gone.' Well, maybe we'd been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. I won't say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and by thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a pack o' fools look fishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the fishiest. 'Well,' says the doctor, 'let's bargain.' We bargained, him and I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. As for them, they've tramped; I don't know where's they are.""",bat hatch speak friend cry speaker first gracious tone reply yesterday morning say dog watch come flag truce say sell ship gone take glass song help say leastway look look thunder old ship gone see pack o' fool look fishier lay tell look fishiest say doctor let bargain bargain store brandy block house firewood thoughtful cut manner speak whole bless boat cross-tree tramp know

19,"""And lest you should take it into that head of yours,"" he went on, ""that you was included in the treaty, here's the last word that was said: 'How many are you,' says I, 'to leave?'

But there's a thing or two I have to tell you,"" I said, and by this time I was quite excited; ""and the first is this: here you are, in a bad way--ship lost, treasure lost, men lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who did it--it was I! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land, and I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at the bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was out. And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I that killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her where you'll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh's on my side; I've had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you than I fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me. But one thing I'll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when you fellows are in court for piracy, I'll save you all I can. It is for you to choose.

25,"I stopped, for, I tell you, I was out of breath, and to my wonder, not a man of them moved, but all sat staring at me like as many sheep. And while they were still staring, I broke out again, ""And now, Mr. Silver,"" I said, ""I believe you're the best man here, and if things go to the worst, I'll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took it.""",stop tell breath wonder man move sit stare many sheep stare break say believe good man thing go bad take kind let doctor know way take

Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes.

35,"""Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?"" roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. ""Put a name on what you're at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it?

You won't fight, as gentlemen o' fortune should; then, by thunder, you'll obey, and you may lay to it! I like that boy, now; I never seen a better boy than that.

38,"There was a long pause after this. I stood straight up against the wall, my heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom. Silver leant back against the wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part, drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. One after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes.",be long pause stand wall heart go sledge hammer ray hope shine bosom lean wall arm cross pipe corner mouth calm church eye keep wonder keep tail unruly follower part draw far end block house low hiss whispering sound ear stream look red light torch fall second nervous face turn eye

41,"And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house. One after another the rest followed his example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology. ""According to rules,"" said one. ""Forecastle council,"" said Morgan. And so with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me alone with the torch.",elaborate sea salute fellow long ill look yellow eyed man step door disappear house rest follow example make salute pass add apology accord rule say council say remark march leave torch

43,"""Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins,"" he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible, ""you're within half a plank of death, and what's a long sight worse, of torture. They're going to throw me off. But, you mark, I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn't mean to; no, not till you spoke up. I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain. But I see you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins'll stand by you.
