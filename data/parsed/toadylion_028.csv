1,CHAPTER XXVIII. THE GIPSY CAMP.,camp 
2," At this point a peculiar fragrance was borne to them upon the light wind, the far-blowing smell of a wood-fire, together with the odour of boiling and fragrant stew--a compound and delicious wild-wood scent, which almost created the taste by which it was to be enjoyed, as they say all good literature must. There was also another smell, less idyllic but equally characteristic--the odour of drying paint. All these came from the camp of the gipsies set up on the corner of the common lands of Windy Standard.",point peculiar fragrance borne light wind blow smell wood fire odour boil fragrant stew compound delicious wild wood scent create taste enjoy say good literature be smell idyllic characteristic odour drying paint come camp gipsie set corner common land windy 
3,"The gipsies' wood was a barren acre of tall, ill-nurtured Scotch firs, with nothing to break their sturdy monotony of trunk right up to the spreading crown of twisted red branches and dark green spines. Beneath, the earth was covered with a carpet of dry and brown pine-needles, several inches thick, soft and silent under the feet as velvet pile. Ditches wet and dry closed in the place of sanctuary for the wandering tribes of Egypt on all sides, save only towards the high road, where a joggly, much-rutted cart track led deviously in between high banks, through which the protruding roots of the Scotch firs, knotted and scarred, were seen twisting and grappling each other like a nest of snakes. Suddenly, between the ridges of pine-trees, the pair came in sight of the camp.",gipsie wood barren acre tall ill nurture fir break sturdy monotony trunk spread crown twist red branch dark green spine earth cover carpet dry brown pine needle several inch thick soft silent foot velvet pile ditche wet dry close place sanctuary wonder tribe side save high road joggly rutt cart track lead high bank protrude root fir knotted scarr see twist grapple other nest snake ridge pine tree pair come sight camp 
4,"""I declare,"" cried Hugh John, ""they are painting the waggons. I wish they would let me help. I can slick it on like a daisy. Now I'm telling you. Andrew Penman at the coach-works in Church Street showed me how. He says I can 'line' as well as any workman in the place. I'm going to be a coach-painter. They get bully wages, I tell you.""",declare cry paint waggon wish let help slick daisy tell coach work show say line workman place go coach painter get bully wage tell

6,"Hugh John remembered, saw his mistake, and shifted his ground all in the twinkling of an eye; for of course a man of spirit ought never to own himself in the wrong--at least to a girl. It is a bad precedent, occasionally even fatal.",remember see mistake shift ground twinkling eye course man spirit own wrong least girl bad precedent fatal 
7,"""Oh yes, of course I am going to be a soldier,"" he said with the hesitation of one who stops to think what he is going to say; ""but I'm to be a coach-painter in my odd time and on holidays. Besides, officers get so little pay now-a-days, it's shameful--I heard my father say. So one must do something.""",course go soldier say hesitation stop think go say coach painter odd time holiday officer get little pay day shameful hear father say do 
8,"""Oh, here's the terrier--pretty thing, I declare he quite knows me--see, Hugh John,"" cried Cissy, kneeling with delight in her eye, and taking hold of the little dog, which came bounding forward to meet her--stopping midway, however, to paw at its neck, to which the Chianti wicker-work still clung tightly round the edge of the bandage.",terrier pretty thing declare know see cry kneel delight eye take hold little dog come bound meet stop paw neck wicker work cling edge bandage 
9,"Billy Blythe came towards them, touching his cap as he did so in a half-military manner; for had he not a brother in the county militia, who was the best fighter (with his fists) in the regiment, the pest of his colonel, but in private the particular pet of all the other officers, who were always ready to put their money on Gipsy Blythe to any amount.",come touch cap do half military manner brother county militia good fighter fist regiment pest colonel private particular pet other officer ready put money amount

11,"A tall girl came up at this moment, dusky and lithe, her face and neck tanned to a fine healthy brown almost as dark as saddle-leather, but with a rolling black eye so full and piercing that even her complexion seemed light by comparison. She carried a back load of tinware of all sorts, and by her wearied air appeared to be returning to the encampment after a day's tramp.",tall girl come moment dusky lithe face neck tann fine healthy brown dark saddle leather roll black eye full pierce complexion seem light comparison carry back load tinware sort weary air appear return encampment day tramp

30,"After the fox-terrier had been examined, commented upon, and duly dressed, Billy Blythe walked with them part of the way homeward, and Hugh John opened out to him his troubles. He told him of the feud against the town boys, and related all the manifold misdeeds of the Smoutchies. All the while Billy said nothing, but the twitching of his hands and a peculiarly covert look about his dusky face told that he was listening intently. Scarcely had Hugh John come to the end of his tale when, with the blood mounting darkly to his cheeks, Billy turned about to see if he were observed. There was no one near.",fox terrier examine comment dress walk part way homeward open trouble tell feud town boy relate manifold misdeed say twitching hand covert look dusky face tell listen come end tale blood mount cheek turn see observe be
