3," When he got to the middle of the room the cuckoo cleared his throat, flapped his wings, and began to sing. Griselda was quite astonished. She had had no idea that her friend was so accomplished. It wasn't ""cuckooing"" at all; it was real singing, like that of the nightingale or the thrush, or like something prettier than either. It made Griselda think of woods in summer, and of tinkling brooks flowing through them, with the pretty brown pebbles sparkling up through the water; and then it made her think of something sad--she didn't know what; perhaps it was of the babes in the wood and the robins covering them up with leaves--and then again, in a moment, it sounded as if all the merry elves and sprites that ever were heard of had escaped from fairyland, and were rolling over and over with peals of rollicking laughter. And at last, all of a sudden, the song came to an end.",get middle room cuckoo clear throat flapp wing begin sing astonished have idea friend accomplish cuckooing real singing nightingale thrush pretty make think wood summer tinkle brook flow pretty brown pebble sparkling water make think sad know babe wood robin cover leave moment sound merry elve sprite hear escape fairyland roll peal rollick laughter last song come end

5,"There was no buzz of talk, as is usual after a performance has come to a close, but there was a great buzz of nodding, and Griselda, wishing to give the cuckoo as much praise as she could, nodded as hard as any of them. The cuckoo really looked quite shy at receiving so much applause. But in a minute or two the music struck up and the dancing began again--one, two, three: it seemed a sort of mazurka this time, which suited the mandarins very well, as it gave them a chance of nodding to mark the time.",be buzz talk usual performance come close be great buzz nodd wish give cuckoo much praise nod cuckoo look shy receive much applause minute music strike dancing begin seem sort mazurka time suit mandarin give chance nodd mark time 
6,"Griselda had once learnt the mazurka, so she got on even better than before--only she would have liked it more if her shoes had had sharper toes; they looked so stumpy when she tried to point them. All the same, it was very good fun, and she was not too well pleased when she suddenly felt the little sharp tap of the cuckoo on her head, and heard him whisper--",learn mazurka get good like shoe have sharper toe look stumpy try point same good fun pleased feel little sharp tap cuckoo head hear whisper

14,"Griselda stooped to take off her shoe.

It was the feather mantle.",stoop take shoe go pal begin say finish sentence get shoe feel cuckoo throw feather mantle

18,"She began to feel confused and doubtful, when suddenly she felt something hurting her arm, like a little lump in the bed. She felt with her hand to see if she could smooth it away, and drew out--one of the shoes belonging to her court dress! The very one she had held in her hand at the moment the cuckoo spirited her home again to bed.",begin feel confused doubtful feel hurt arm little lump bed feel hand see smooth draw shoe belong court dress very one hold hand moment cuckoo spirit home bed

20,"She jumped out of bed and unfastened one of the window-shutters, then jumped in again to admire the little shoe in comfort. It was even prettier than she had thought it at the ball. She held it up and looked at it. It was about the size of the first joint of her little finger. ""To think that I should have been dancing with you on last night!"" she said to the shoe.

29,"A few days after this poor Griselda caught cold. It was not a very bad cold, I must confess, but her aunts made rather a fuss about it.

30,"""It would be so dull,"" she said piteously. ""Please let me stay in the ante-room, for all my things are there; and, then, there's the cuckoo.""",dull say let stay ante room thing be cuckoo 
31,"Aunt Grizzel smiled at this, and Griselda got her way. But even in the ante-room it was rather dull. Miss Grizzel and Miss Tabitha were obliged to go out, to drive all the way to Merrybrow Hall, as Lady Lavander sent a messenger to say that she had an attack of influenza, and wished to see her friends at once.",smile get way ante room dull oblige go drive way send messenger say have attack influenza wish see friend

35,"So off they set; and Griselda, in her arm-chair by the ante-room fire, with some queer little old-fashioned books of her aunts', which she had already read more than a dozen times, beside her by way of amusement, felt that there was one comfort in her troubles--she had escaped the long weary drive to her godmother's.",set arm chair ante room fire queer little old fashioned book aunt read more time way amusement feel be comfort trouble escape long weary drive godmother 
36,"But it was very dull. It got duller and duller. Griselda curled herself up in her chair, and wished she could go to sleep, though feeling quite sure she couldn't, for she had stayed in bed much later than usual this morning, and had been obliged to spend the time in sleeping, for want of anything better to do.",dull get duller duller curl chair wish go sleep feel sure stay bed usual morning oblige spend time sleeping want good do

39,"It was not near ""any o'clock."" But after waiting a minute or two, it seemed to Griselda that she heard the soft sound of ""coming"" that always preceded the cuckoo's appearance. She was right. In another moment she heard his usual greeting, ""Cuckoo, cuckoo!""",o'clock wait minute seem hear soft sound come precede cuckoo appearance right moment hear usual greeting cuckoo 
40,"""Oh, cuckoo!"" she exclaimed, ""I am so glad you have come at last. I _am_ so dull, and it has nothing to do with lessons this time.

I'm not even sure that I could listen to stories. What could you do to amuse me, cuckoo?""",dear say little shiver cold like stay tell story sure listen story do amuse cuckoo

47,"""Your great-great-grandfather,"" said the cuckoo. ""Very well. Now, Griselda, shut your eyes. First of all, I am going to sing.""",great great grandfather say cuckoo shut eye first go sing 
48,"Griselda shut her eyes, and the cuckoo began his song. It was something like what he had sung at the mandarins' palace, only even more beautiful. It was so soft and dreamy, Griselda felt as if she could have sat there for ever, listening to it.",shut eye cuckoo begin song sung mandarin palace beautiful soft dreamy feel sit listen 
49,"The first notes were low and murmuring. Again they made Griselda think of little rippling brooks in summer, and now and then there came a sort of hum as of insects buzzing in the warm sunshine near. This humming gradually increased, till at last Griselda was conscious of nothing more--_everything_ seemed to be humming, herself too, till at last she fell asleep.",first note low murmure make think little ripple brook summer come sort hum insect buzz warm sunshine hum increase last conscious more seem hum last fall asleep 
50,"When she opened her eyes, the ante-room and everything in it, except the arm-chair on which she was still curled up, had disappeared--melted away into a misty cloud all round her, which in turn gradually faded, till before her she saw a scene quite new and strange. It was the first of the cuckoo's ""pictures.""",open eye ante room arm chair curl disappear melt misty cloud turn fade see scene new strange first cuckoo picture 
51,"An old, quaint room, with a high, carved mantelpiece, and a bright fire sparkling in the grate. It was not a pretty room--it had more the look of a workshop of some kind; but it was curious and interesting. All round, the walls were hung with clocks and strange mechanical toys. There was a fiddler slowly fiddling, a gentleman and lady gravely dancing a minuet, a little man drawing up water in a bucket out of a glass vase in which gold fish were swimming about--all sorts of queer figures; and the clocks were even queerer. There was one intended to represent the sun, moon, and planets, with one face for the sun and another for the moon, and gold and silver stars slowly circling round them; there was another clock with a tiny trumpeter perched on a ledge above the face, who blew a horn for the hours. I cannot tell you half the strange and wonderful things there were.",old quaint room high carve mantelpiece bright fire sparkling grate pretty room have look workshop kind curious interesting wall hang clock strange mechanical toy be fiddler fiddle gentleman lady dance minuet little man draw water bucket glass vase gold fish swim sort queer figure clock queerer be intend represent sun moon planet face sun moon gold silver star circle be clock tiny trumpeter perch ledge face blow horn hour tell strange wonderful thing 
52,"Griselda was so interested in looking at all these queer machines, that she did not for some time observe the occupant of the room. And no wonder; he was sitting in front of a little table, so perfectly still, much more still than the un-living figures around him. He was examining, with a magnifying glass, some small object he held in his hand, so closely and intently that Griselda, forgetting she was only looking at a ""picture,"" almost held her breath for fear she should disturb him. He was a very old man, his coat was worn and threadbare in several places, looking as if he spent a great part of his life in one position. Yet he did not look _poor_, and his face, when at last he lifted it, was mild and intelligent and very earnest.",interested look queer machine time observe occupant room wonder sit front little table un-living figure examine magnify glass small object hold hand forget look picture hold breath fear disturb old man coat wear threadbare several place look spend great part life position look _poor_ face last lift mild intelligent earnest 
53,"While Griselda was watching him closely there came a soft tap at the door, and a little girl danced into the room. The dearest little girl you ever saw, and _so_ funnily dressed! Her thick brown hair, rather lighter than Griselda's, was tied in two long plaits down her back. She had a short red skirt with silver braid round the bottom, and a white chemisette with beautiful lace at the throat and wrists, and over that again a black velvet bodice, also trimmed with silver. And she had a great many trinkets, necklaces, and bracelets, and ear-rings, and a sort of little silver coronet; no, it was not like a coronet, it was a band with a square piece of silver fastened so as to stand up at each side of her head something like a horse's blinkers, only they were not placed over her eyes.",watch come soft tap door little girl dance room dearest little girl see dress thick brown hair light tie long plait back have short red skirt silver braid bottom white chemisette beautiful lace throat wrist black velvet bodice trim silver have great many trinket necklace bracelet ear ring sort little silver coronet coronet band square piece silver fasten stand side head horse blinker place eye

""I would rather just go on living in this little house, and I am sure the neighbours would give me something to eat, and then I could hear all your clocks ticking, and think of you.

She saw before her a country road in full summer time; the sun was shining, the birds were singing, the trees covered with their bright green leaves--everything appeared happy and joyful. But at last in the distance she saw, slowly approaching, a group of a few people, all walking together, carrying in their centre something long and narrow, which, though the black cloth covering it was almost hidden by the white flowers with which it was thickly strewn, Griselda knew to be a coffin.",look see country road full summer time sun shine bird sing tree cover bright green leave appear happy joyful last distance see approach group few person walk carry centre long narrow black cloth cover hide white flower strewn know coffin
