1,CHAPTER V. THE SUMMER-HOUSE,chapter summer 
2," DIAMOND said nothing to his mother about his adventures. He had half a notion that North Wind was a friend of his mother, and that, if she did not know all about it, at least she did not mind his going anywhere with the lady of the wind. At the same time he doubted whether he might not appear to be telling stories if he told all, especially as he could hardly believe it himself when he thought about it in the middle of the day, although when the twilight was once half-way on to night he had no doubt about it, at least for the first few days after he had been with her. The girl that swept the crossing had certainly refused to believe him. Besides, he felt sure that North Wind would tell him if he ought to speak.",say mother adventure have notion friend mother know least mind go lady wind same time doubt appear tell story tell believe think middle day twilight half way night have doubt least first few day girl sweep crossing refuse believe feel sure tell speak 
3,"It was some time before he saw the lady of the wind again. Indeed nothing remarkable took place in Diamond’s history until the following week. This was what happened then. Diamond the horse wanted new shoes, and Diamond’s father took him out of the stable, and was just getting on his back to ride him to the forge, when he saw his little boy standing by the pump, and looking at him wistfully. Then the coachman took his foot out of the stirrup, left his hold of the mane and bridle, came across to his boy, lifted him up, and setting him on the horse’s back, told him to sit up like a man. He then led away both Diamonds together.",time see lady wind remarkable take place history follow week happen horse want new shoe father take stable get back ride forge see little boy stand pump look coachman take foot stirrup leave hold mane bridle come boy lift set horse tell sit man lead 
4,"The boy atop felt not a little tremulous as the great muscles that lifted the legs of the horse knotted and relaxed against his legs, and he cowered towards the withers, grasping with his hands the bit of mane worn short by the collar; but when his father looked back at him, saying once more, “Sit up, Diamond,” he let the mane go and sat up, notwithstanding that the horse, thinking, I suppose, that his master had said to him, “Come up, Diamond,” stepped out faster. For both the Diamonds were just grandly obedient. And Diamond soon found that, as he was obedient to his father, so the horse was obedient to him. For he had not ridden far before he found courage to reach forward and catch hold of the bridle, and when his father, whose hand was upon it, felt the boy pull it towards him, he looked up and smiled, and, well pleased, let go his hold, and left Diamond to guide Diamond; and the boy soon found that he could do so perfectly. It was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that. And another discovery he made was that, in order to guide the horse, he had in a measure to obey the horse first. If he did not yield his body to the motions of the horse’s body, he could not guide him; he must fall off.",boy feel little tremulous great muscle lift leg horse knotted relax leg cower wither grasp hand bit mane wear short collar father look say more sit let mane go sit notwithstand horse think suppose master say come step fast diamond obedient find obedient father horse obedient ride find courage reach catch hold bridle father hand feel boy pull look smile pleased let go hold leave guide boy find do grand thing able guide great beast discovery make order guide horse have measure obey horse yield body motion horse body guide fall 
5,"The blacksmith lived at some distance, deeper into London. As they crossed the angle of a square, Diamond, who was now quite comfortable on his living throne, was glancing this way and that in a gentle pride, when he saw a girl sweeping a crossing scuddingly before a lady. The lady was his father’s mistress, Mrs. Coleman, and the little girl was she for whose sake he had got off North Wind’s back. He drew Diamond’s bridle in eager anxiety to see whether her outstretched hand would gather a penny from Mrs. Coleman. But she had given one at the last crossing, and the hand returned only to grasp its broom. Diamond could not bear it. He had a penny in his pocket, a gift of the same lady the day before, and he tumbled off his horse to give it to the girl. He tumbled off, I say, for he did tumble when he reached the ground. But he got up in an instant, and ran, searching his pocket as he ran. She made him a pretty courtesy when he offered his treasure, but with a bewildered stare. She thought first: “Then he was on the back of the North Wind after all!” but, looking up at the sound of the horse’s feet on the paved crossing, she changed her idea, saying to herself, “North Wind is his father’s horse! That’s the secret of it! Why couldn’t he say so?” And she had a mind to refuse the penny. But his smile put it all right, and she not only took his penny but put it in her mouth with a “Thank you, mister. Did they wollop you then?”",blacksmith live distance cross angle square comfortable living throne glance way gentle pride see girl sweep crossing lady lady father mistress little girl sake get draw bridle eager anxiety see outstretched hand gather penny give last crossing hand return grasp broom bear have penny pocket gift same lady day tumble horse give girl tumble say tumble reach ground get instant run search pocket run make pretty courtesy offer treasure bewilder stare think back look sound horse foot paved crossing change idea say father horse secret say have mind refuse penny smile put take penny put mouth thank mister wollop

11,"The summer drew near, warm and splendid. Miss Coleman was a little better in health, and sat a good deal in the garden. One day she saw Diamond peeping through the shrubbery, and called him. He talked to her so frankly that she often sent for him after that, and by degrees it came about that he had leave to run in the garden as he pleased. He never touched any of the flowers or blossoms, for he was not like some boys who cannot enjoy a thing without pulling it to pieces, and so preventing every one from enjoying it after them.",summer draw warm splendid little good health sit good deal garden day see peep shrubbery call talk send degree come leave run garden pleased touch flower blossom boy enjoy thing pull piece prevent one enjoy

13,"One hot evening, he had been sitting with the young mistress, as they called her, in a little summer-house at the bottom of the lawn--a wonderful thing for beauty, the boy thought, for a little window in the side of it was made of coloured glass. It grew dusky, and the lady began to feel chill, and went in, leaving the boy in the summer-house. He sat there gazing out at a bed of tulips, which, although they had closed for the night, could not go quite asleep for the wind that kept waving them about. All at once he saw a great bumble-bee fly out of one of the tulips.",hot evening sit young mistress call little summer house bottom lawn wonderful thing beauty boy think little window side make coloured glass grow dusky lady begin feel chill go leave boy summer house sit gaze bed tulip close night go asleep wind keep wave see great bumble bee fly tulip

15,"Diamond could not tell whether the voice was near or far away, it was so small and yet so clear. He had never seen a fairy, but he had heard of such, and he began to look all about for one.

You stupid Diamond! have you never seen me before?”",big big time size huge fairy grow big little will nursery tale say know good stupid see

61,"North Wind grew very small indeed, so small that she could not have blown the dust off a dusty miller, as the Scotch children call a yellow auricula. Diamond could not even see the blades of grass move as she flitted along by his foot. They left the lawn, went out by the wicket in the-coach-house gates, and then crossed the road to the low wall that separated it from the river.",grow small small blow dust dusty miller child call yellow auricula see blade grass move flite foot leave lawn go wicket coach house gate cross road low wall separate river

99,"North Wind was gone. Away across the river went a long ripple--what sailors call a cat’s paw. The man in the boat was putting up a sail. The moon was coming to herself on the edge of a great cloud, and the sail began to shine white. Diamond rubbed his eyes, and wondered what it was all about. Things seemed going on around him, and all to understand each other, but he could make nothing of it. So he put his hands in his pockets, and went in to have his tea. The night was very hot, for the wind had fallen again.",gone river go long ripple sailor call cat paw man boat put sail moon come edge great cloud sail begin shine white rub eye wonder thing seem go understand other make put hand pocket go have tea night hot wind fall

105,"He woke in the middle of the night and the darkness. A terrible noise was rumbling overhead, like the rolling beat of great drums echoing through a brazen vault. The roof of the loft in which he lay had no ceiling; only the tiles were between him and the sky. For a while he could not come quite awake, for the noise kept beating him down, so that his heart was troubled and fluttered painfully. A second peal of thunder burst over his head, and almost choked him with fear. Nor did he recover until the great blast that followed, having torn some tiles off the roof, sent a spout of wind down into his bed and over his face, which brought him wide awake, and gave him back his courage. The same moment he heard a mighty yet musical voice calling him.",wake middle night darkness terrible noise rumble roll beat great drum echoing brazen vault roof loft lay have ceiling tile sky while come awake noise keep beat heart trouble flutter second peal thunder burst head choke fear recover great blast follow tear tile roof send spout wind bed face bring give courage same moment hear mighty musical voice call

107,"He looked out of the bed, and saw a gigantic, powerful, but most lovely arm--with a hand whose fingers were nothing the less ladylike that they could have strangled a boa-constrictor, or choked a tigress off its prey--stretched down through a big hole in the roof. Without a moment’s hesitation he reached out his tiny one, and laid it in the grand palm before him.",look bed see gigantic powerful lovely arm hand finger less ladylike strangle boa- constrictor choke tigress prey stretch big hole roof moment hesitation reach tiny one lay grand palm
