3,"The Rat was sitting on the river bank, singing a little song. He had just composed it himself, so he was very taken up with it, and would not pay proper attention to Mole or anything else. Since early morning he had been swimming in the river, in company with his friends the ducks. And when the ducks stood on their heads suddenly, as ducks will, he would dive down and tickle their necks, just under where their chins would be if ducks had chins, till they were forced to come to the surface again in a hurry, spluttering and angry and shaking their feathers at him, for it is impossible to say quite ALL you feel when your head is under water. At last they implored him to go away and attend to his own affairs and leave them to mind theirs. So the Rat went away, and sat on the river bank in the sun, and made up a song about them, which he called",sit river bank sing little song compose take pay proper attention else early morning swim river company friend duck duck stand head duck dive tickle neck chin duck have chin force come surface hurry splutter angry shake feather impossible say feel head water last implore go attend own affair leave mind go sit river bank sun make song call

10,"‘Nor don’t the ducks neither,’ replied the Rat cheerfully. ‘They say, “WHY can’t fellows be allowed to do what they like WHEN they like and AS they like, instead of other fellows sitting on banks and watching them all the time and making remarks and poetry and things about them? What NONSENSE it all is!” That’s what the ducks say.’",duck reply say fellow allow do like like like other fellow sit bank watch time make remark poetry thing nonsense duck say

The stables are over there to the right. That’s the banqueting-hall you’re looking at now--very old, that is.

We shall hear all about it quite soon enough.’",look understand say boating play tired done wonder new fad take come let look hear

22,"‘Hooray!’ he cried, jumping up on seeing them, ‘this is splendid!’ He shook the paws of both of them warmly, never waiting for an introduction to the Mole. ‘How KIND of you!’ he went on, dancing round them. ‘I was just going to send a boat down the river for you, Ratty, with strict orders that you were to be fetched up here at once, whatever you were doing.

25,"Here the Rat nudged the Mole. Unfortunately the Toad saw him do it, and turned very red. There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Toad burst out laughing. ‘All right, Ratty,’ he said. ‘It’s only my way, you know. And it’s not such a very bad house, is it? You know you rather like it yourself. Now, look here.

27,"‘O, pooh! boating!’ interrupted the Toad, in great disgust. ‘Silly boyish amusement. I’ve given that up LONG ago. Sheer waste of time, that’s what it is. It makes me downright sorry to see you fellows, who ought to know better, spending all your energies in that aimless manner. No, I’ve discovered the real thing, the only genuine occupation for a life time. I propose to devote the remainder of mine to it, and can only regret the wasted years that lie behind me, squandered in trivialities.

29,"‘There you are!’ cried the Toad, straddling and expanding himself. ‘There’s real life for you, embodied in that little cart. The open road, the dusty highway, the heath, the common, the hedgerows, the rolling downs! Camps, villages, towns, cities! Here to-day, up and off to somewhere else to-morrow! Travel, change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a horizon that’s always changing! And mind! this is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built, without any exception.

34,"‘Now, you dear good old Ratty,’ said Toad, imploringly, ‘don’t begin talking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way, because you know you’ve GOT to come. I can’t possibly manage without you, so please consider it settled, and don’t argue--it’s the one thing I can’t stand.

All the same, it sounds as if it might have been--well, rather fun, you know!’ he added, wistfully. Poor Mole!

38,"‘Come along in, and have some lunch,’ he said, diplomatically, ‘and we’ll talk it over. We needn’t decide anything in a hurry. Of course, _I_ don’t really care. I only want to give pleasure to you fellows. “Live for others!” That’s my motto in life.’",come have lunch say talk decide hurry course care want give pleasure fellow live other motto life 
39,"During luncheon--which was excellent, of course, as everything at Toad Hall always was--the Toad simply let himself go. Disregarding the Rat, he proceeded to play upon the inexperienced Mole as on a harp. Naturally a voluble animal, and always mastered by his imagination, he painted the prospects of the trip and the joys of the open life and the roadside in such glowing colours that the Mole could hardly sit in his chair for excitement. Somehow, it soon seemed taken for granted by all three of them that the trip was a settled thing; and the Rat, though still unconvinced in his mind, allowed his good-nature to over-ride his personal objections. He could not bear to disappoint his two friends, who were already deep in schemes and anticipations, planning out each day’s separate occupation for several weeks ahead.",luncheon excellent course let go disregard proceed play inexperienced harp voluble animal master imagination paint prospect trip joy open life roadside such glow colour sit chair excitement take grant trip settle thing unconvinced mind allow good nature ride personal objection bear disappoint friend deep scheme anticipation plan day separate occupation several week 
40,"When they were quite ready, the now triumphant Toad led his companions to the paddock and set them to capture the old grey horse, who, without having been consulted, and to his own extreme annoyance, had been told off by Toad for the dustiest job in this dusty expedition. He frankly preferred the paddock, and took a deal of catching. Meantime Toad packed the lockers still tighter with necessaries, and hung nosebags, nets of onions, bundles of hay, and baskets from the bottom of the cart. At last the horse was caught and harnessed, and they set off, all talking at once, each animal either trudging by the side of the cart or sitting on the shaft, as the humour took him. It was a golden afternoon. The smell of the dust they kicked up was rich and satisfying; out of thick orchards on either side the road, birds called and whistled to them cheerily; good-natured wayfarers, passing them, gave them ‘Good-day,’ or stopped to say nice things about their beautiful cart; and rabbits, sitting at their front doors in the hedgerows, held up their fore-paws, and said, ‘O my! O my! O my!’",ready triumphant lead companion paddock set capture old grey horse consult own extreme annoyance tell dustiest job dusty expedition prefer paddock take deal catching pack locker tight necessary hang nosebag net onion bundle hay basket bottom cart last horse catch harness set talk animal trudg side cart sit shaft humour take golden afternoon smell dust kick rich satisfy thick orchard side road bird call whistle good natured wayfarer pass give good day stop say nice thing beautiful cart rabbit sit front door hedgerow hold fore paw say 
41,"Late in the evening, tired and happy and miles from home, they drew up on a remote common far from habitations, turned the horse loose to graze, and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass by the side of the cart. Toad talked big about all he was going to do in the days to come, while stars grew fuller and larger all around them, and a yellow moon, appearing suddenly and silently from nowhere in particular, came to keep them company and listen to their talk. At last they turned in to their little bunks in the cart; and Toad, kicking out his legs, sleepily said, ‘Well, good night, you fellows! This is the real life for a gentleman! Talk about your old river!’",evening tired happy mile home draw remote common habitation turn horse graze eat simple supper sit grass side cart talk big go do day come star grow fuller large yellow moon appear particular come keep company listen talk last turn little bunk cart kick leg say good night fellow real life gentleman talk old river

43,"The Mole reached out from under his blanket, felt for the Rat’s paw in the darkness, and gave it a squeeze. ‘I’ll do whatever you like, Ratty,’ he whispered. ‘Shall we run away to-morrow morning, quite early--VERY early--and go back to our dear old hole on the river?’",reach blanket feel paw darkness give squeeze do like whisper run morning go dear old hole river

46,"After so much open air and excitement the Toad slept very soundly, and no amount of shaking could rouse him out of bed next morning. So the Mole and Rat turned to, quietly and manfully, and while the Rat saw to the horse, and lit a fire, and cleaned last night’s cups and platters, and got things ready for breakfast, the Mole trudged off to the nearest village, a long way off, for milk and eggs and various necessaries the Toad had, of course, forgotten to provide. The hard work had all been done, and the two animals were resting, thoroughly exhausted, by the time Toad appeared on the scene, fresh and gay, remarking what a pleasant easy life it was they were all leading now, after the cares and worries and fatigues of housekeeping at home.",much open air excitement sleep amount shaking rouse bed next morning turn see horse light fire clean last night cup plateer get thing ready breakfast trudge near village long way milk egg various necessary course forget provide hard work do animal rest exhaust time appear scene fresh gay remark pleasant easy life lead care worry fatigue housekeeping home 
47,"They had a pleasant ramble that day over grassy downs and along narrow by-lanes, and camped as before, on a common, only this time the two guests took care that Toad should do his fair share of work. In consequence, when the time came for starting next morning, Toad was by no means so rapturous about the simplicity of the primitive life, and indeed attempted to resume his place in his bunk, whence he was hauled by force. Their way lay, as before, across country by narrow lanes, and it was not till the afternoon that they came out on the high-road, their first high-road; and there disaster, fleet and unforeseen, sprang out on them--disaster momentous indeed to their expedition, but simply overwhelming in its effect on the after-career of Toad.",have pleasant ramble day grassy down narrow lane camp common time guest take care do fair share work consequence time come start next morning means rapturous simplicity primitive life attempt resume place bunk haul force way lay country narrow lane afternoon come high road first high road disaster fleet unforeseen spring disaster momentous expedition overwhelming effect career 
48,"They were strolling along the high-road easily, the Mole by the horse’s head, talking to him, since the horse had complained that he was being frightfully left out of it, and nobody considered him in the least; the Toad and the Water Rat walking behind the cart talking together--at least Toad was talking, and Rat was saying at intervals, ‘Yes, precisely; and what did YOU say to HIM?’--and thinking all the time of something very different, when far behind them they heard a faint warning hum; like the drone of a distant bee. Glancing back, they saw a small cloud of dust, with a dark centre of energy, advancing on them at incredible speed, while from out the dust a faint ‘Poop-poop!’ wailed like an uneasy animal in pain. Hardly regarding it, they turned to resume their conversation, when in an instant (as it seemed) the peaceful scene was changed, and with a blast of wind and a whirl of sound that made them jump for the nearest ditch, It was on them! The ‘Poop-poop’ rang with a brazen shout in their ears, they had a moment’s glimpse of an interior of glittering plate-glass and rich morocco, and the magnificent motor-car, immense, breath-snatching, passionate, with its pilot tense and hugging his wheel, possessed all earth and air for the fraction of a second, flung an enveloping cloud of dust that blinded and enwrapped them utterly, and then dwindled to a speck in the far distance, changed back into a droning bee once more.",stroll high road horse head talk horse complain leave consider least walk cart talk least talk say interval say think time different hear faint warning hum drone distant bee glance see small cloud dust dark centre energy advance incredible speed dust faint poop poop wail uneasy animal pain regard turn resume conversation instant seem peaceful scene change blast wind whirl sound make jump near ditch poop poop’ ring brazen shout ear have moment glimpse interior glitter plate glass rich morocco magnificent motor car immense breath snatching passionate pilot tense hug wheel possess earth air fraction second flung envelop cloud dust blind enwrapp dwindle speck far distance change droning bee more 
49,"The old grey horse, dreaming, as he plodded along, of his quiet paddock, in a new raw situation such as this simply abandoned himself to his natural emotions. Rearing, plunging, backing steadily, in spite of all the Mole’s efforts at his head, and all the Mole’s lively language directed at his better feelings, he drove the cart backwards towards the deep ditch at the side of the road. It wavered an instant--then there was a heartrending crash--and the canary-coloured cart, their pride and their joy, lay on its side in the ditch, an irredeemable wreck.",old grey horse dreaming plodd quiet paddock new raw situation such abandon natural emotion rear plung back spite effort head lively language direct good feeling drive cart deep ditch side road waver instant be heartrending crash canary coloured cart pride joy lay side ditch irredeemable wreck 
50,"The Rat danced up and down in the road, simply transported with passion. ‘You villains!’ he shouted, shaking both fists, ‘You scoundrels, you highwaymen, you--you--roadhogs!--I’ll have the law of you! I’ll report you! I’ll take you through all the Courts!’ His home-sickness had quite slipped away from him, and for the moment he was the skipper of the canary-coloured vessel driven on a shoal by the reckless jockeying of rival mariners, and he was trying to recollect all the fine and biting things he used to say to masters of steam-launches when their wash, as they drove too near the bank, used to flood his parlour-carpet at home.",dance road transport passion villain shout shake fist scoundrel highwaymen roadhog have law report take court home sickness slip moment skipper canary coloured vessel drive shoal reckless jockeying rival mariner try recollect fine bite thing use say master steam launch wash drive bank use flood parlour carpet home

But NOW--but now that I know, now that I fully realise! O what a flowery track lies spread before me, henceforth! What dust-clouds shall spring up behind me as I speed on my reckless way!

He has got a new craze, and it always takes him that way, in its first stage. He’ll continue like that for days now, like an animal walking in a happy dream, quite useless for all practical purposes.

66,"‘Now, look here, Toad!’ said the Rat sharply: ‘as soon as we get to the town, you’ll have to go straight to the police-station, and see if they know anything about that motor-car and who it belongs to, and lodge a complaint against it. And then you’ll have to go to a blacksmith’s or a wheelwright’s and arrange for the cart to be fetched and mended and put to rights. It’ll take time, but it’s not quite a hopeless smash. Meanwhile, the Mole and I will go to an inn and find comfortable rooms where we can stay till the cart’s ready, and till your nerves have recovered their shock.’",look say get town have go police station see know motor car belong lodge complaint have go blacksmith wheelwright arrange cart fetched mend put right take time hopeless smash go inn find comfortable room stay cart ready nerve recover shock

68,"The Rat turned from him in despair. ‘You see what it is?’ he said to the Mole, addressing him across Toad’s head: ‘He’s quite hopeless. I give it up--when we get to the town we’ll go to the railway station, and with luck we may pick up a train there that’ll get us back to riverbank to-night. And if ever you catch me going a-pleasuring with this provoking animal again!’--He snorted, and during the rest of that weary trudge addressed his remarks exclusively to Mole.",turn despair see say address head hopeless give get town go railway station luck pick train get riverbank night catch go pleasuring provoking animal snort rest weary trudge address remark 
69,"On reaching the town they went straight to the station and deposited Toad in the second-class waiting-room, giving a porter twopence to keep a strict eye on him. They then left the horse at an inn stable, and gave what directions they could about the cart and its contents. Eventually, a slow train having landed them at a station not very far from Toad Hall, they escorted the spell-bound, sleep-walking Toad to his door, put him inside it, and instructed his housekeeper to feed him, undress him, and put him to bed.
