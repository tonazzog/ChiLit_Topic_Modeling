2," Cyril had once pointed out that ordinary life is full of occasions on which a wish would be most useful. And this thought filled his mind when he happened to wake early on the morning after the morning after Robert had wished to be bigger than the baker's boy, and had been it. The day that lay between these two days had been occupied entirely by getting the governess-cart home from Benenhurst.",point ordinary life full occasion wish useful thought fill mind happen wake morning morning wish big baker boy day lay day occupy get governess cart home 
3,"Cyril dressed hastily; he did not take a bath, because tin baths are so noisy, and he had no wish to rouse Robert, and he slipped off alone, as Anthea had once done, and ran through the dewy morning to the sand-pit. He dug up the Psammead very carefully and kindly, and began the conversation by asking it whether it still felt any ill effects from the contact with the tears of Robert the day before yesterday. The Psammead was in good temper. It replied politely.",dress take bath tin bath noisy have wish rouse slip do run dewy morning sand pit dig begin conversation ask feel ill effect contact tear day yesterday good temper reply

So that we don't have to come and disturb you again,"" added the crafty Cyril.",know mean go want say let have wish think happen have come disturb add crafty 
8,"""It'll only end in your wishing for something you don't really want, as you did about the castle,"" said the Psammead, stretching its brown arms and yawning.

Good-bye.""",end wish want do castle say stretch brown arm yawning same person leave eat wholesome thing have own way good bye

12,"""What an awful long time babies _stay_ babies,"" said Cyril after the Lamb had taken his watch out of his pocket while he wasn't noticing, and with coos and clucks of naughty rapture had opened the case and used the whole thing as a garden spade, and when even immersion in a wash basin had failed to wash the mould from the works and make the watch go again. Cyril had said several things in the heat of the moment; but now he was calmer, and had even consented to carry the Lamb part of the way to the woods. Cyril had persuaded the others to agree to his plan, and not to wish for anything more till they really did wish it. Meantime it seemed good to go to the woods for nuts, and on the mossy grass under a sweet chestnut tree the five were sitting. The Lamb was pulling up the moss by fat handfuls, and Cyril was gloomily contemplating the ruins of his watch.",awful long time baby _stay_ baby say take watch pocket notice coo cluck naughty rapture open case use whole thing garden spade immersion wash basin fail wash mould work make watch go say several thing heat moment calmer consent carry part way wood persuade other agree plan wish more wish seem good go wood nut mossy grass sweet chestnut tree sit pull moss fat handful contemplate ruin watch

16,"""I suppose he'll be grown up some day,"" Anthea was saying, dreamily looking up at the blue of the sky that showed between the long straight chestnut-leaves. But at that moment the Lamb, struggling gaily with Cyril, thrust a stout-shod little foot against his brother's chest; there was a crack!--the innocent Lamb had broken the glass of father's second-best Waterbury watch, which Cyril had borrowed without leave.",suppose grow day say look blue sky show long straight chestnut leave moment struggle thrust stout shod little foot brother chest be crack innocent break glass father second good watch borrow leave

21,"The faithful Psammead was true to its promise, and there, before the horrified eyes of its brothers and sisters, the Lamb suddenly and violently grew up. It was the most terrible moment. The change was not so sudden as the wish-changes usually were. The Baby's face changed first. It grew thinner and larger, lines came in the forehead, the eyes grew more deep-set and darker in colour, the mouth grew longer and thinner; most terrible of all, a little dark mustache appeared on the lip of one who was still--except as to the face--a two-year-old baby in a linen smock and white open-work socks.",faithful true promise horrified eye brother sister grow terrible moment change sudden wish change face change grow thin large line come forehead eye grow deep set dark colour mouth grow long thin terrible little dark mustache appear lip face year old baby linen smock white open work sock

23,"They all wished hard, for the sight was enough to dismay the most heartless. They all wished so hard, indeed, that they felt quite giddy and almost lost consciousness; but the wishing was quite vain, for, when the wood ceased to whirl round, their dazed eyes were riveted at once by the spectacle of a very proper-looking young man in flannels and a straw hat--a young man who wore the same little black mustache which just before they had actually seen growing upon the Baby's lip. This, then, was the Lamb--grown up! Their own Lamb! It was a terrible moment. The grown-up Lamb moved gracefully across the moss and settled himself against the trunk of the sweet chestnut. He tilted the straw hat over his eyes. He was evidently weary. He was going to sleep. The Lamb--the original little tiresome beloved Lamb often went to sleep at odd times and in unexpected places. Was this new Lamb in the grey flannel suit and the pale green necktie like the other Lamb? or had his mind grown up together with his body?",wish sight enough dismay heartless wish feel giddy lose consciousness wish vain wood cease whirl dazed eye rivet spectacle proper look young man flannel straw hat young man wear same little black mustache see grow lip grow own terrible moment grow move moss settle trunk sweet chestnut tilt straw hat eye weary go sleep original little tiresome beloved go sleep odd time unexpected place new grey flannel suit pale green necktie other have mind grow body

25,"""Whichever it is, it'll be just as awful,"" said Anthea. ""If his inside senses are grown up too, he won't stand our looking after him; and if he's still a baby inside of him how on earth are we to get him to do anything?

Perhaps sunset would come upon him amid the dazzling luxury of club-land, and a helpless cross sleepy baby would find itself alone amid unsympathetic waiters, and would wail miserably for ""Panty"" from the depths of a club arm-chair!

55,"The position was desperate. Robert exchanged a despairing look with Cyril. Anthea detached a pin from her waistband, a pin whose withdrawal left a gaping chasm between skirt and bodice, and handed it furtively to Robert--with a grimace of the darkest and deepest meaning. Robert slipped away to the road. There, sure enough, stood a bicycle--a beautiful new one. Of course Robert understood at once that if the Lamb was grown up he _must_ have a bicycle.",position desperate exchange despairing look detach pin waistband pin withdrawal leave gape chasm skirt bodice hand grimace dark deep meaning slip road stand bicycle beautiful new one course understand grow have bicycle

He would have made the total twenty-two but for the rustling of the yellow hazel-leaves, which warned him of the approach of the others. He hastily leaned a hand on each wheel, and was rewarded by the ""whish"" of the what was left of air escaping from eighteen neat pin-holes.",own reason wish grow begin use pin-- puncture back tyre front make total rustling yellow hazel leave warn approach other learn hand wheel reward whish leave air escape neat pin-hole

It provided an odd sort of tea-and-hammy meal for the Lamb and his brothers. This was paid for out of the fifteen shillings which had been earned by Robert when he was a giant--for the Lamb, it appeared, had unfortunately no money about him. This was a great disappointment for the others; but it is a thing that will happen, even to the most grown-up of us. However, Robert had enough to eat, and that was something. Quietly but persistently the miserable four took it in turns to try and persuade the Lamb (or St. Maur) to spend the rest of the day in the woods. There was not very much of the day left by the time he had mended the eighteenth puncture. He looked up from the completed work with a sigh of relief, and suddenly put his tie straight.",be number puncture make manifest feel special blessing cottage provide tea cyclist provide odd sort tea hammy meal brother pay shilling earn giant appear have money great disappointment other thing happen grow up have enough eat miserable take turn try persuade spend rest day wood be much day leave time mend eighteenth puncture look complete work sigh relief put tie

His brothers and sisters were indeed rather dirty, because, earlier in the day, the Lamb, in his infant state, had sprinkled a good deal of garden soil over them. The grown-up Lamb's voice was so tyrant-like, as Jane said afterwards, that they actually retreated to the back garden, and left him with his little mustache and his flannel suit to meet alone the young lady, who now came up the front garden wheeling a bicycle.",be lady come say goodness sake get way go home hide vanish see pack dirty kid brother sister dirty day infant state sprinkle good deal garden soil grow voice tyrant say retreat back garden leave little mustache flannel suit meet young lady come front garden wheel bicycle

No one could possibly have supposed, to see and hear him, that only that very morning he had been a chubby child of two years breaking other people's Waterbury watches. Devereux (as he ought to be called for the future) took out a gold watch when he had mended the lady's bicycle, and all the hidden onlookers said ""Oh!""--because it seemed so unfair that the Baby, who had only that morning destroyed two cheap but honest watches, should now, in the grown-upness to which Cyril's folly had raised him, have a real gold watch--with a chain and seals!",try remember call examine lady bicycle talk grow manner suppose see hear morning chubby child year break other person watch call future take gold watch mend lady bicycle hide onlooker say seem unfair have morning destroy cheap honest watch grow upness folly raise have real gold watch chain seal

Therefore Martha merely saw the usual party, with the baby Lamb, about whom she had been desperately anxious all the afternoon, trotting beside Anthea, on fat baby legs, while the children, of course, still saw the grown-up Lamb (never mind what names he was christened by), and Martha rushed at him and caught him in her arms, exclaiming--",remember special favour arrange servant house notice change bring wish child see usual party baby anxious afternoon trot fat baby leg child course see grow mind name christen rush catch arm exclaim
