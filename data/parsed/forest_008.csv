1,CHAPTER VIII.,
2," Edward put the pony to a trot, and in two hours was on the other side of the New Forest. The directions given to him by Jacob were not forgotten, and before it was noon he found himself at the gate of the keeper's house. Dismounting, and hanging the bridle of the pony over the rail, he walked through a small garden, neatly kept, but, so early in the year, not over gay, except that the crocus and snowdrops were peeping. He rapped at the door with his knuckles, and a girl of about fourteen, very neatly dressed, answered the summons.",put pony trot hour other side new direction give forget noon find gate keeper house dismounting hang bridle pony rail walk small garden keep year gay crocus snowdrop peep rapp door knuckle girl dress answer summons

12,"""I will speak to my father,"" replied the young girl, ""if you will wait one moment.""",speak father reply young girl wait moment 
13,"In a minute or two the girl returned, saying that her father begged that he would walk in, and he would speak with him. Edward bowed, and followed the young girl, who led the way to a room, in which was seated a man dressed after the fashion of the Roundheads of the day. His steeple-crowned hat lay on the chair, with his sword beneath it. He was sitting at a table covered with papers.",minute girl return say father begg walk speak bow follow young girl lead way room seat man dress fashion day steeple crown hat lay chair sword sit table cover paper 
14,"""Here is the youth, father,"" said the girl; and having said this, she crossed the room and took a seat by the side of the fire. The man, or we should rather say gentleman--for he had the appearance of one, notwithstanding the somber and peculiar dress he wore, continued to read a letter which he had just opened; and Edward, who feared himself the prisoner of a Roundhead, when he only expected to meet a keeper, was further irritated by the neglect shown toward him by the party. Forgetting that he was, by his own assertion, not Edward Beverley, but the relative of one Jacob Armitage, he colored up with anger as he stood at the door. Fortunately the time that it took the other party to read through the letter gave Edward also time for recollecting the disguise under which he appeared; the color subsided from his cheeks, and he remained in silence, occasionally meeting the look of the little girl, who, when their eyes met, immediately withdrew her glance.",youth father say girl say cross room take seat side fire man say gentleman have appearance notwithstand somber peculiar dress wear continue read letter open fear prisoner expect meet keeper irritate neglect show party forgett own assertion relative color anger stand door time take other party read letter give time recollect disguise appear color subside cheek remain silence meet look little girl eye meet withdraw glance

18,"""For what reason should he call upon you, sir?"" replied Edward.",reason call sir reply 
19,"""Simply, young man, because the New Forest is, by the Parliament, committed to my charge. Notice has been given for all those who were employed to come here, that they might be permitted to remain, or be discharged, as I may deem most advisable.""",young man new commit charge notice give employ come permit remain discharge deem advisable 
20,"""Jacob Armitage has heard nothing of this, sir,"" replied Edward. ""He was a keeper, appointed under the king; for two or three years his allowances have never been paid, and he has lived on his own cottage, which was left to him by his father, being his own property.""",hear sir reply keeper appoint king year allowance pay live own cottage leave father own property

29,"""You are pithy at reply, young man; but I know something of Jacob Armitage, and we know,"" continued he, putting his finger close to some writing opposite the name on the list, ""with whom he has associated, and with whom he has served. Now allow me to put one question. You have come, you say, for two young hounds. Are their services required for your pigs and cows, and to what uses are they to be put.""",pithy reply young man know know continue put finger writing name list associate serve allow put question come say young hound service require pig cow use put

35,"""Perhaps you will explain why?""",explain 
36,"""Nothing is more easy. Jacob Armitage served King Charles, who employed him as a verderer in the forest, and paid him his wages. Those who should not have done so rebelled against the king, took his authority from him, and the means of paying those he employed. They were still servants of the king, for they were not dismissed; and, having no other means of support, they considered that their good master would be but too happy that they should support themselves by killing, for their subsistence, that venison which they could no longer preserve for him without eating some themselves.""",easy serve employ verderer forest pay wage do rebell king take authority means pay employ servant king dismiss have other means support consider good master happy support kill subsistence venison preserve eat

41,"""Young man,"" replied the other, in a severe tone, ""if you wish to know my authority, malapert as you are (at this remark Edward started, yet, recollecting himself, he compressed his lips and stood still), this is my commission, appointing me the agent of Parliament to take charge and superintend the New Forest, with power to appoint and dismiss those whom I please.

42,"Edward stepped up to the table, and very quietly took up the paper and read it.

It is, therefore, but eighteen days old.""",step table take paper read state correct sir say lay date perceive 20th last month day old

44,"""Simply this, sir--that Jacob Armitage has been laid up with the rheumatism for three months, during which time he certainly has not killed any venison. Now, sir, until the Parliament took the forest into their hands, it undoubtedly belonged to his majesty, if it does not now; therefore Jacob Armitage, for whatever slaughter he may have committed, is, up to the present, only answerable to his sovereign, King Charles.""",sir lay rheumatism month time kill venison sir take forest hand belong majesty slaughter commit present answerable sovereign

46,"""Sir, it is a base dog that bites the hand that feeds him,"" replied Edward, with warmth.

47,"""Young man, if you do not speak advisedly, at all events you speak gratefully; neither have I a word of disrespect to offer to the memory of Colonel Beverley, who was a gallant man, and true to the cause which he espoused, although it was not a holy one; but, in my position, I can not, in justice to those whom I serve, give places and emolument to those who have been, and still are, as I may judge by your expressions, adverse to the present government.""",young man speak event speak word disrespect offer memory gallant man true cause espouse holy one position justice serve give place emolument judge expression adverse present government 
48,"""Sir,"" replied Edward, ""your language, with respect to Colonel Beverley, has made me feel respect for you, which I confess I did not at first; what you say is very just, not that I think you harm Jacob Armitage, as, in the first place, I know that he would not serve under you; and, in the next, that he is too old and infirm to hold the situation; neither has he occasion for it, as his cottage and land are his own, and you can not remove him.""",reply language respect make feel respect confess first say think harm first place know serve next old infirm hold situation have occasion cottage land own remove

67,"""Nay, nay, I can forgive any expression of feeling on your part, young man, when that dreadful and disgraceful deed is brought to your memory. It was a stain that can never be effaced--a deed most diabolical, and what we thought would call down the vengeance of Heaven. If prayers could avert, or did avert it, they were not wanting on our side.""",forgive expression feeling part young man dreadful disgraceful deed bring memory stain efface deed diabolical think call vengeance prayer avert avert want side 
68,"Edward remained silent: this admission on the part of the Roundhead prevented an explosion on his part. He felt that all were not so bad as he had imagined. After a long pause, he said:",remain silent admission part prevent explosion part feel bad imagine long pause say

77,"""Well, sir, if so, so be it. You have dismissed the Armitages on account of their upholding the king, and you can not, therefore, be surprised that they uphold him more than ever.

78,"""Nor can you be surprised, if a poacher is caught, that he incurs the penalty,"" replied the Roundhead. ""So now there's an end of our argument.

79,"Edward, who felt indignant at being dismissed to the kitchen, nodded his head and smiled upon the little girl, and left the room. ""Well,"" thought he, as he went along the passage, ""I came here for two puppies, and I have found a Roundhead. I don't know how it is, but I am not angry with him as I thought I should be. That little girl had a nice smile--she was quite handsome when she smiled.

80,"Edward returned by the way he came, went out of the front door and through the garden to where the pony was made fast, and led him away in search of a stable. He found one behind the house, and filling the rack with hay, returned to the house and seated himself at a porch which was at the door which led to the back premises, for the keeper's house was large and commodious. Edward was in deep thought, when he was roused by the little girl, the daughter of the newly-appointed intendant of the forest, who said:",return way come go front door garden pony make lead search stable find house fill rack hay return house seat porch door lead back premise keeper house large commodious deep thought rouse little girl daughter appoint intendant forest say
