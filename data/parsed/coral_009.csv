3,"Our encounter with the shark was the first great danger that had befallen us since landing on this island, and we felt very seriously affected by it, especially when we considered that we had so often unwittingly incurred the same danger before while bathing.  We were now forced to take to fishing again in the shallow water, until we should succeed in constructing a raft.  What troubled us most, however, was, that we were compelled to forego our morning swimming excursions.  We did, indeed, continue to enjoy our bathe in the shallow water, but Jack and I found that one great source of our enjoyment was gone, when we could no longer dive down among the beautiful coral groves at the bottom of the lagoon. We had come to be so fond of this exercise, and to take such an interest in watching the formations of coral and the gambols of the many beautiful fish amongst the forests of red and green sea-weeds, that we had become quite familiar with the appearance of the fish and the localities that they chiefly haunted.  We had also become expert divers.  But we made it a rule never to stay long under water at a time.  Jack told me that to do so often was bad for the lungs, and, instead of affording us enjoyment, would ere long do us a serious injury.  So we never stayed at the bottom as long as we might have done, but came up frequently to the top for fresh air, and dived down again immediately.  Sometimes, when Jack happened to be in a humorous frame, he would seat himself at the bottom of the sea on one of the brain corals, as if he were seated on a large paddock-stool, and then make faces at me, in order, if possible, to make me laugh under water.  At first, when he took me unawares, he nearly succeeded, and I had to shoot to the surface in order to laugh; but afterwards I became aware of his intentions, and, being naturally of a grave disposition, I had no difficulty in restraining myself.  I used often to wonder how poor Peterkin would have liked to be with us; and he sometimes expressed much regret at being unable to join us.  I used to do my best to gratify him, poor fellow, by relating all the wonders that we saw; but this, instead of satisfying, seemed only to whet his curiosity the more, so one day we prevailed on him to try to go down with us.  But, although a brave boy in every other way, Peterkin was very nervous in the water, and it was with difficulty we got him to consent to be taken down, for he could never have managed to push himself down to the bottom without assistance.  But no sooner had we pulled him down a yard or so into the deep clear water, than he began to struggle and kick violently, so we were forced to let him go, when he rose out of the water like a cork, gave a loud gasp and a frightful roar, and struck out for the land with the utmost possible haste.",encounter shark first great danger befall land island feel affect consider incur same danger bathing force take fishing shallow water succeed construct raft trouble most compel forego morning swim excursion continue enjoy bathe shallow water find great source enjoyment gone dive beautiful coral grove bottom lagoon come fond exercise take interest watch formation coral gambol many beautiful fish forest red green sea weed become familiar appearance fish locality haunt become expert diver make rule stay water time tell do bad lung afford enjoyment do serious injury stay bottom do come top fresh air dive happen humorous frame seat bottom sea brain coral seat large paddock stool make face order possible make laugh water first take succeed have shoot surface order laugh become aware intention grave disposition have difficulty restrain use wonder poor like express much regret unable join use do good gratify poor fellow relate wonder see satisfy seem whet curiosity more day prevail try go brave boy other way nervous water difficulty get consent take manage push bottom assistance pull yard deep clear water begin struggle kick force let go rise water cork give loud gasp frightful roar strike land utmost possible haste 
4,"Now, all this pleasure we were to forego, and when we thought thereon, Jack and I felt very much depressed in our spirits.  I could see, also, that Peterkin grieved and sympathized with us, for, when talking about this matter, he refrained from jesting and bantering us upon it.",pleasure forego think feel depressed spirit see grieve sympathize talk matter refrain jest banter 
5,"As, however, a man's difficulties usually set him upon devising methods to overcome them, whereby he often discovers better things than those he may have lost, so this our difficulty induced us to think of searching for a large pool among the rocks, where the water should be deep enough for diving yet so surrounded by rocks as to prevent sharks from getting at us.  And such a pool we afterwards found, which proved to be very much better than our most sanguine hopes anticipated.  It was situated not more than ten minutes' walk from our camp, and was in the form of a small deep bay or basin, the entrance to which, besides being narrow, was so shallow that no fish so large as a shark could get in, at least not unless he should be a remarkably thin one.",man difficulty set devise method overcome discover good thing lose difficulty induce think search large pool rock water deep diving surround rock prevent shark get pool find prove good sanguine hope anticipate situate more minute walk camp form small deep bay basin entrance narrow shallow fish large shark get least thin one 
6,"Inside of this basin, which we called our Water Garden, the coral formations were much more wonderful, and the sea-weed plants far more lovely and vividly coloured, than in the lagoon itself.  And the water was so clear and still, that, although very deep, you could see the minutest object at the bottom.  Besides this, there was a ledge of rock which overhung the basin at its deepest part, from which we could dive pleasantly and whereon Peterkin could sit and see not only all the wonders I had described to him, but also see Jack and me creeping amongst the marine shrubbery at the bottom, like, as--he expressed it,--""two great white sea-monsters.""  During these excursions of ours to the bottom of the sea, we began to get an insight into the manners and customs of its inhabitants, and to make discoveries of wonderful things, the like of which we never before conceived.  Among other things, we were deeply interested with the operations of the little coral insect which, I was informed by Jack, is supposed to have entirely constructed many of the numerous islands in Pacific Ocean.  And, certainly, when we considered the great reef which these insects had formed round the island on which we were cast, and observed their ceaseless activity in building their myriad cells, it did at first seem as if this might be true; but then, again, when I looked at the mountains of the island, and reflected that there were thousands of such, many of them much higher, in the South Seas, I doubted that there must be some mistake here.  But more of this hereafter.",basin call coral formation wonderful sea weed plant lovely coloured lagoon water clear deep see minutest object bottom be ledge rock overh basin deep part dive sit see wonder describe see creep marine shrubbery bottom express great white sea monster excursion bottom sea begin get insight manners custom inhabitant make discovery wonderful thing like conceive other thing interested operation little coral insect inform suppose construct many numerous island consider great reef insect form island cast observe ceaseless activity build myriad cell first seem true look mountain island reflect be thousand such many high doubt be mistake more 
7,"I also became much taken up with the manners and appearance of the anemones, and star-fish, and crabs, and sea-urchins, and such-like creatures; and was not content with watching those I saw during my dives in the Water Garden, but I must needs scoop out a hole in the coral rock close to it, which I filled with salt water, and stocked with sundry specimens of anemones and shell-fish, in order to watch more closely how they were in the habit of passing their time.  Our burning-glass also now became a great treasure to me, as it enabled me to magnify, and so to perceive more clearly the forms and actions of these curious creatures of the deep.",become take manners appearance anemone star fish crab sea- urchin such like creature content watch see dive need scoop hole coral rock fill salt water stock sundry specimen anemone shell fish order watch habit pass time burning glass become great treasure enable magnify perceive form action curious creature deep 
8,"Having now got ourselves into a very comfortable condition, we began to talk of a project which we had long had in contemplation,--namely, to travel entirely round the island; in order, first, to ascertain whether it contained any other productions which might be useful to us; and, second, to see whether there might be any place more convenient and suitable for our permanent residence than that on which we were now encamped.  Not that we were in any degree dissatisfied with it; on the contrary, we entertained quite a home-feeling to our bower and its neighbourhood; but if a better place did exist, there was no reason why we should not make use of it.  At any rate, it would be well to know of its existence.",get comfortable condition begin talk project have contemplation travel island order ascertain contain other production useful see be place convenient suitable permanent residence encamp degree dissatisfied contrary entertain home feel bower neighbourhood good place exist be reason make use rate well know existence 
9,"We had much earnest talk over this matter.  But Jack proposed that, before undertaking such an excursion, we should supply ourselves with good defensive arms, for, as we intended not only to go round all the shore, but to ascend most of the valleys, before returning home, we should be likely to meet in with, he would not say dangers, but, at least, with everything that existed on the island, whatever that might be.",have much earnest talk matter propose undertake excursion supply good defensive arm intend go shore ascend most valley return likely meet say danger least exist island 
10,"""Besides,"" said Jack, ""it won't do for us to live on cocoa-nuts and oysters always.  No doubt they are very excellent in their way, but I think a little animal food, now and then, would be agreeable as well as good for us; and as there are many small birds among the trees, some of which are probably very good to eat, I think it would be a capital plan to make bows and arrows, with which we could easily knock them over.""",say do live cocoa nut oyster doubt excellent way think little animal food agreeable good be many small bird tree good eat think capital plan make bow arrow knock 
11,"""First rate!"" cried Peterkin.  ""You will make the bows, Jack, and I'll try my hand at the arrows.  The fact is, I'm quite tired of throwing stones at the birds.

But you were at least four yards away from the impudent paroquet I aimed at; so you see what a horribly bad shot I am.""",true reply precious shindy kick consequence least yard impudent paroquet aim see bad shot 
14,"""But,"" said I, ""Jack, you cannot make three bows and arrows before to- morrow, and would it not be a pity to waste time, now that we have made up our minds to go on this expedition?  Suppose that you make one bow and arrow for yourself, and we can take our clubs?""",say make bow arrow pity waste time make mind go expedition suppose make bow arrow take club

16,"We had, up to this time, been in the habit of going to bed with the sun, as we had no pressing call to work o' nights; and, indeed, our work during the day was usually hard enough,--what between fishing, and improving our bower, and diving in the Water Garden, and rambling in the woods; so that, when night came, we were usually very glad to retire to our beds.  But now that we had a desire to work at night, we felt a wish for candles.",have time habit go bed sun have press call work night work day hard fishing improve bower diving ramble wood night come glad retire bed have desire work night feel wish candle

20,"""Well, as you're always doing that at any rate,"" remarked Jack, ""we could scarcely call it a change.  But the fact is, I've been thinking over this subject before.

21,"""Then why don't you do it?"" interrupted Peterkin.  ""Why have you kept us in the dark so long, you vile philosopher?""",do interrupt keep dark vile philosopher

23,"""Ah! that's just the way with me,"" said Peterkin with a deep sigh.  ""I never could keep in my mind for half an hour the few descriptions I ever attempted to remember.  The very first voyage I ever made was caused by my mistaking a description, or forgetting it, which is the same thing. And a horrible voyage it was.  I had to fight with the captain the whole way out, and made the homeward voyage by swimming!""",way say deep sigh keep mind hour few description attempt remember first voyage make cause mistaking description forget same thing horrible voyage have fight captain whole way make homeward voyage swim

26,"""Let us hear how it happened,"" said Jack, while a good-natured smile overspread his face.",let hear happen say good natured smile overspread face 
27,"""Well, you must know,"" began Peterkin, ""that the very day before I went to sea, I was greatly taken up with a game at hockey, which I was playing with my old school-fellows for the last time before leaving them.  You see I was young then, Ralph.""  Peterkin gazed, in an abstracted and melancholy manner, out to sea!  ""Well, in the midst of the game, my uncle, who had taken all the bother and trouble of getting me bound 'prentice and rigged out, came and took me aside, and told me that he was called suddenly away from home, and would not be able to see me aboard, as he had intended.  'However,' said he, 'the captain knows you are coming, so that's not of much consequence; but as you'll have to find the ship yourself, you must remember her name and description.  D'ye hear, boy?'  I certainly did hear, but I'm afraid I did not understand, for my mind was so taken up with the game, which I saw my side was losing, that I began to grow impatient, and the moment my uncle finished his description of the ship, and bade me good-bye, I bolted back to my game, with only a confused idea of three masts, and a green painted tafferel, and a gilt figure-head of Hercules with his club at the bow.  Next day I was so much cast down with everybody saying good-bye, and a lot o' my female friends cryin' horribly over me, that I did not start for the harbour, where the ship was lying among a thousand others, till it was almost too late.  So I had to run the whole way.  When I reached the pier, there were so many masts, and so much confusion, that I felt quite humblebumbled in my faculties.  'Now,' said I to myself, 'Peterkin, you're in a fix.'  Then I fancied I saw a gilt figure-head and three masts, belonging to a ship just about to start; so I darted on board, but speedily jumped on shore again, when I found that two of the masts belonged to another vessel, and the figurehead to a third!  At last I caught sight of what I made sure was it,--a fine large vessel just casting off her moorings.  The tafferel was green.  Three masts,--yes, that must be it,--and the gilt figure-head of Hercules.  To be sure it had a three-pronged pitchfork in its hand instead of a club; but that might be my uncle's mistake; or perhaps Hercules sometimes varied his weapons.  'Cast off!' roared a voice from the quarter-deck.  'Hold on!' cried I, rushing frantically through the crowd.  'Hold on! hold on!' repeated some of the bystanders, while the men at the ropes delayed for a minute.  This threw the captain into a frightful rage; for some of his friends had come down to see him off, and having his orders contradicted so flatly was too much for him.  However, the delay was sufficient.  I took a race and a good leap; the ropes were cast off; the steam-tug gave a puff, and we started.  Suddenly the captain was up to me: 'Where did you come from, you scamp, and what do you want here?'",know begin very day go sea take game hockey play old school fellow last time leave see young gaze abstract melancholy manner sea midst game uncle take bother trouble get bind prentice rig come take tell call home able see intend say captain know come much consequence have find ship remember name description hear hear afraid understand mind take game see side lose begin grow impatient moment uncle finish description ship bid good bolt game confuse idea mast green paint tafferel gilt figure head club bow next day cast say good lot female friend start harbour ship lie other late have run whole way reach pier be many mast much confusion feel humblebumbled faculty say fix fancy see gilt figure head mast belong ship start dart board jump shore find mast belong vessel figurehead third last catch sight make sure fine large vessel cast mooring tafferel green mast gilt figure head sure have prong pitchfork hand club uncle mistake vary weapon cast roar voice quarter deck hold cry rush crowd hold hold repeat bystander man rope delay minute throw captain frightful rage friend come see have order contradict much delay sufficient take race good leap rope cast steam tug give puff start captain come scamp want

You've run away, you have;' and the captain stamped about the deck and swore dreadfully; for, you see, the thought of having to stop the ship and lower a boat and lose half an hour, all for the slake of sending a small boy ashore, seemed to make him very angry.  Besides, it was blowin' fresh outside the harbour, so that, to have let the steamer alongside to put me into it was no easy job.  Just as we were passing the pier-head, where several boats were rowing into harbour, the captain came up to me,--",new say stamp get new prentice boy trick young blackguard run have captain stamp deck swore see thought have stop ship lower boat lose hour slake send small boy seem make angry blowin' fresh harbour let steamer put easy job pass pier head several boat row harbour captain come

41,"In a few minutes we were all three pushing through the underwood of the forest, headed by Peterkin.",few minute push underwood forest head 
42,"We soon came to the tree in question, which, after Jack had closely examined it, we concluded must be the candle-nut tree.  Its leaves were of a beautiful silvery white, and formed a fine contrast to the dark-green foliage of the surrounding trees.  We immediately filled our pockets with the nuts, after which Jack said,--",come tree question examine conclude candle nut tree leave beautiful silvery white form fine contrast dark green foliage surround tree fill pocket nut say 
43,"""Now, Peterkin, climb that cocoa-nut tree and cut me one of the long branches.""",climb cocoa nut tree cut long branch 
44,"This was soon done, but it cost some trouble, for the stem was very high, and as Peterkin usually pulled nuts from the younger trees, he was not much accustomed to climbing the high ones.  The leaf or branch was a very large one, and we were surprised at its size and strength.  Viewed from a little distance, the cocoa-nut tree seems to be a tall, straight stem, without a single branch except at the top, where there is a tuft of feathery-looking leaves, that seem to wave like soft plumes in the wind. But when we saw one of these leaves or branches at our feet, we found it to be a strong stalk, about fifteen feet long, with a number of narrow, pointed leaflets ranged alternately on each side.  But what seemed to us the most wonderful thing about it was a curious substance resembling cloth, which was wrapped round the thick end of the stalk, where it had been cut from the tree.  Peterkin told us that he had the greatest difficulty in separating the branch from the stem, on account of this substance, as it was wrapped quite round the tree, and, he observed, round all the other branches, thus forming a strong support to the large leaves while exposed to high winds.  When I call this substance cloth I do not exaggerate.  Indeed, with regard to all the things I saw during my eventful career in the South Seas, I have been exceedingly careful not to exaggerate, or in any way to mislead or deceive my readers.  This cloth, I say, was remarkably like to coarse brown cotton cloth.  It had a seam or fibre down the centre of it, from which diverged other fibres, about the size of a bristle.  There were two layers of these fibres, very long and tough, the one layer crossing the other obliquely, and the whole was cemented together with a still finer fibrous and adhesive substance.  When we regarded it attentively, we could with difficulty believe that it had not been woven by human hands.  This remarkable piece of cloth we stripped carefully off, and found it to be above two feet long, by a foot broad, and we carried it home with us as a great prize.",do cost trouble stem high pull nut young tree accustom climb high one leaf branch large one surprise size strength view little distance cocoa nut tree seem tall straight stem single branch top be tuft feathery look leave seem wave soft plume wind see leave branch foot find strong stalk foot long number narrow point leaflet rang side seem wonderful thing curious substance resemble cloth wrap thick end stalk cut tree tell have great difficulty separate branch stem account substance wrap tree observe other branch form strong support large leave expose high wind call substance cloth exaggerate regard thing see eventful career careful exaggerate way mislead deceive reader cloth say coarse brown cotton cloth have seam fibre centre diverge other fibre size bristle be layer fibre long tough layer cross other whole cement finer fibrous adhesive substance regard difficulty believe wove human hand remarkable piece cloth stripp find foot foot carry great prize 
45,"Jack now took one of the leaflets, and, cutting out the central spine or stalk, hurried back with it to our camp.  Having made a small fire, he baked the nuts slightly, and then pealed off the husks.  After this he wished to bore a hole in them, which, not having anything better at hand at the time, he did with the point of our useless pencil-case.  Then he strung them on the cocoa-nut spine, and on putting a light to the topmost nut, we found to our joy that it burned with a clear, beautiful flame; upon seeing which, Peterkin sprang up and danced round the fire for at least five minutes in the excess of his satisfaction.",take leaflet cut central spine stalk hurry camp make small fire bake nut peal husk wish bear hole have good hand time do point useless pencil case string cocoa nut spine put light topmost nut find joy burn clear beautiful flame see spring dance fire least minute excess satisfaction

65,"While we were thus engaged, we were startled by a distant but most strange and horrible cry.  It seemed to come from the sea, but was so far away that we could not clearly distinguish its precise direction.  Rushing out of our bower, we hastened down to the beach and stayed to listen. Again it came quite loud and distinct on the night air,--a prolonged, hideous cry, something like the braying of an ass.  The moon had risen, and we could see the islands in and beyond the lagoon quite plainly, but there was no object visible to account for such a cry.  A strong gust of wind was blowing from the point whence the sound came, but this died away while we were gazing out to sea.",engage startle distant strange horrible cry seem come sea distinguish precise direction rush bower hasten beach stay listen come loud distinct night air prolonged hideous cry braying ass moon rise see island lagoon be object visible account cry strong gust wind blow point sound come die gaze sea

75,"By this time Peterkin had thinned down his spear and tied an iron point very cleverly to the end of it; I had formed a sling, the lines of which were composed of thin strips of the cocoa-nut cloth, plaited; and Jack had made a stout bow, nearly five feet long, with two arrows, feathered with two or three large plumes which some bird had dropt.  They had no barbs, but Jack said that if arrows were well feathered, they did not require iron points, but would fly quite well if merely sharpened at the point; which I did not know before.",time thin spear tie iron point end form sling line compose thin strip cocoa nut cloth plait make stout bow foot long arrow feathered large plume bird dript have barb say arrow feathered require iron point fly sharpen point know

77,"The string of the bow was formed of our piece of whip-cord, part of which, as he did not like to cut it, was rolled round the bow.",string bow form piece whip cord part like cut roll bow 
78,"Although thus prepared for a start on the morrow, we thought it wise to exercise ourselves a little in the use of our weapons before starting, so we spent the whole of the next day in practising.  And it was well we did so, for we found that our arms were very imperfect, and that we were far from perfect in the use of them.  First, Jack found that the bow was much too strong, and he had to thin it.  Also the spear was much too heavy, and so had to be reduced in thickness, although nothing would induce Peterkin to have it shortened.  My sling answered very well, but I had fallen so much out of practice that my first stone knocked off Peterkin's hat, and narrowly missed making a second Goliath of him.  However, after having spent the whole day in diligent practice, we began to find some of our former expertness returning--at least Jack and I did.  As for Peterkin, being naturally a neat-handed boy, he soon handled his spear well, and could run full tilt at a cocoa nut, and hit it with great precision once out of every five times.",prepare start morrow think wise exercise little use weapon start spend whole next day practising do find arm imperfect perfect use find bow strong have thin spear heavy have reduce thickness induce have shorten sling answer fall much practice first stone knock hat miss make second spend whole day diligent practice begin find former expertness return least neat handed boy handle spear run full tilt cocoa nut hit great precision time 
79,"But I feel satisfied that we owed much of our rapid success to the unflagging energy of Jack, who insisted that, since we had made him Captain, we should obey him; and he kept us at work from morning till night, perseveringly, at the same thing.  Peterkin wished very much to run about and stick his spear into everything he passed; but Jack put up a cocoa nut, and would not let him leave off running at that for a moment, except when he wanted to rest.  We laughed at Jack for this, but we were both convinced that it did us much good.",feel satisfied owe much rapid success unflagging energy insist make obey keep work morning night same thing wish much run stick spear pass put cocoa nut let leave run moment want rest laugh convinced do good
