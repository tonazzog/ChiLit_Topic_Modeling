1,CHAPTER XVI.,
2," The next morning was bright and clear, and when Emma and Mary went out, attended by Alfred, to go and milk the cows, although the cold was intense, every thing looked so brilliant and sparkling in the sunshine that they regained their spirits. The lake was still unfrozen, and its waters, which were of an azure blue, contrasted with the whole of the country covered with snow, and the spruce firs with their branches loaded presented an alternate layer of pure white and of the darkest green. Birds there were none to be seen or heard. All was quiet, so quiet that as they stepped along the path which had been cleared away to the cow-house, they almost started at the sound of their own voices, which the atmosphere rendered more peculiarly sonorous and ringing. Alfred had his rifle on his shoulder, and walked in front of his cousins.",next morning bright clear go attend go milk cow cold intense thing look brilliant sparkling sunshine regain spirit lake unfrozen water azure blue contrast whole country cover snow spruce fir branch load present alternate layer pure white dark green bird see hear quiet quiet step path clear cow house start sound own voice atmosphere render sonorous ring have rifle shoulder walk front cousin 
3,"""I have come to prove that all your fears are groundless, my dear Emma, and that you need not have any alarm about a skulking, cowardly wolf,"" said Alfred.",come prove fear groundless dear have alarm skulk cowardly wolf say 
4,"""Well, that may be,"" replied Emma, ""but still we are very glad of your company.""",reply glad company 
5,"They arrived at the cow-house without any adventure, let loose Sancho, who had been tied up, as it was decided that the dog should remain at home with the others, and proceded to milk the cows. Having finished that task and supplied them with fodder, Mary Percival observed, as they were retracing their steps,",arrive cow house adventure let lose tie decide dog remain home other proced milk cow finish task supply fodder observe retrace step 
6,"""I must say that it would not only be more convenient but more agreeable if the cows were kept nearer to the house.""",say convenient agreeable cow keep house 
7,"""It would be certainly,"" replied Alfred. ""It is a pity that there is not a cow-shed within the palisades; but we have no means of making one at present. Next year, when my father has purchased his horses and his sheep, which he talks of doing, we are to build a regular yard and sheds for all the animals close to the house, and palisaded round as the house now is, with a passage from one palisade to the other. Then it will be very convenient; but 'Rome was not built in a day,' as the proverb says; and we must, therefore, wait another winter.""",reply pity be cow shed palisadd have means make present next year father purchase horse sheep talk do build regular yard shed animal close house palisade house passage palisade other convenient build day proverb say wait winter 
8,"""And be devoured by the wolves in the mean time,"" replied Emma, laughing.",devoure wolf mean time reply laugh 
9,"""Why, you are getting over your fright already, Emma.""",get fright 
10,"""Yes; I feel pretty bold, now I think there is nothing to be afraid of.""",feel bold think be afraid 
11,"The remainder of the week was passed away in practicing upon the snow-shoes by the males of the party, the women scarcely ever venturing out of doors, as the cold was very severe. Mary and Emma were accompanied by Alfred for the first three or four days; and after that, notwithstanding that the howling of the wolves was heard every night, they took courage when they found that the animals never made their appearance by daylight, and went as before to milk the cows by themselves. On the Saturday, they were in the hopes of seeing old Malachi Bone, but he did not make his appearance, and John, who could now get on very well in his snow-shoes, became very impatient. Alfred and Martin were also very anxious to see the old man, that they might ascertain if he had made any discoveries relative to the Indians. Sunday, as usual, was a day of rest from labor; the services were read by Mr. Campbell, and the evening passed in serious conversation. Mr. Campbell, although usually in good spirits, was certainly not so on that evening: whether it was that the severity of the winter which had set in and the known long duration of it which they had to encounter had an effect upon his spirits, he was melancholy as well as serious. He more than once referred to the former residence when in England, which was a very unusual thing for him to do, and by degrees the conversation was turned in that direction, and, although no one said so, they all felt what a change there was in their present position from that which they had been forced to leave. Mrs. Campbell, who perceived that a gloom was gathering over the whole party, made several remarks tending to reconcile them to their present lot, and, after a time Mr. Campbell observed--",remainder week pass practice snow shoe male party woman venture door cold severe accompany first day notwithstand howling wolf hear night take courage find animal make appearance daylight go milk cow hope see old make appearance get snow shoe become impatient anxious see old man ascertain make discovery relative usual day rest labor service read evening pass serious conversation good spirit evening severity winter set know long duration have encounter have effect spirit melancholy serious more refer former residence unusual thing do degree conversation turn direction say feel change present position force leave perceive gloom gather whole party make several remark tend reconcile present lot time observe 
12,"""Perhaps, my dear children, it may be a divine mercy which has sent you here to this wilderness; true it is that we are removed from civilization, and shut up here by a severe winter, deprived of the enjoyments and pleasures which are to be found in the society which we were compelled to leave; but let us also bear in mind that we are removed from the many temptations which might have there assailed us.""",dear child divine mercy send wilderness true remove civilization shut severe winter deprive enjoyment pleasure find society compel leave let bear mind remove many temptation assail 
13,"""But still, papa, you would be very glad if circumstances would permit us to return to England; would you not?"" said Percival.",glad circumstance permit return say 
14,"""Yes, my child, I should, and even if I had remained here so long as to have become attached to the place and to the isolation which at first is felt so irksome, I would still return to England and to society, if I had the means. As Christians, we are not to fly from the world and its temptations, but to buckle on our armor, and putting our trust in Him who will protect us, fight the good fight; that is, doing our duty in that state of life to which it shall please God to call us.""",child remain become attach place isolation first feel irksome return society have means fly world temptation buckle armor put trust protect fight good fight do duty state life please call 
15,"""But if ever we were to return to England, there would be no chance of our living as we did before we left it, would there, papa?""",return be chance living do leave papa 
16,"""I see none, my dear boy; but we never know what is in store for us. Should any of us ever return, I presume it would be to live in a more humble way; and for my part, I should prefer that it were so, for although I trust I did not greatly misuse that wealth which I so long supposed to be mine, I should not be sorry to have much less, and therefore less responsibility.""",see dear boy know store return presume live humble way part prefer trust misuse wealth suppose sorry have less less responsibility 
17,"""Indeed, my dear Campbell, imperfect as we all are, I do not believe that many could have made a better use of it than you did.""",dear imperfect believe many make good use 
18,"""I thought so at the time, my dear,"" replied Mr. Campbell, ""but since it has been lost to me, I have often thought that I might have done more good with it. But the fact is, my dear children, there is nothing so dangerous to our eternal welfare as great wealth; it tends to harden the heart by affording the means of constant self-indulgence:--under such circumstances, man is apt to become selfish, easily satisfied with his own works, and too proud to see his errors. Did you observe in the Litany, which I read at this morning's service, how very appropriately is inserted the prayer, for deliverance under the perils of wealth?--",think time dear reply lose think do good fact dear child be dangerous eternal welfare great wealth tend hard heart afford means constant self indulgence such circumstance man apt become selfish satisfied own work proud see error observe read morning service insert prayer deliverance peril wealth 
19,"""'In all time of our tribulation, in all time of our _wealth_, in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment, good Lord deliver us.'",time tribulation time _wealth_ hour death day judgment good lord deliver 
20,"""Examine this, my dear children: in all time of our tribulation,--that is in poverty and distress, and perhaps famishing from want (and in few positions are people so incited to crime), _then_ in all time of our wealth, evidently and distinctly placing wealth as more dangerous to the soul's welfare than the extremest poverty and its accompanying temptations; and observe, only exceeded by the most critical of all dangerous positions, when all has been done and nothing can be undone,--the hour of death, followed by the day of judgment.""",examine dear child time tribulation poverty distress famishing want few position person incite crime time wealth place wealth dangerous soul welfare extremest poverty accompanying temptation observe exceed critical dangerous position do undone hour death follow day judgment 
21,"Mr. Campbell ceased speaking, and there was a pause for a minute or two in the conversation, when Mary Percival said, ""What, then, my dear uncle, do you consider as the most enviable position in life?""",cease speak be pause minute conversation say dear uncle consider enviable position life 
22,"""I consider a moderate independence as the most enviable; not occupied in trade, as the spirit of barter is too apt to make us bend to that which is actually fraud. I should say, a country gentleman living on his own property and among his own tenants, employing the poor around him, holds a position in which he has the least temptation to do wrong, and the most opportunities of doing good.""",consider moderate independence enviable occupy trade spirit barter apt make bend fraud say country gentleman live own property own tenant employ poor hold position have least temptation do wrong most opportunity do good 
23,"""I agree with you, my dear Campbell,"" said his wife; ""and yet how few are satisfied even with that lot.""",agree dear say wife few satisfied lot 
24,"""Because the craving after wealth is so strong, that every one would have more than he hath, and few men will be content. The desire of aggrandizement overcomes and masters us; and yet what can be more absurd than to witness the care and anxiety of those to gain riches, who have already more perhaps than is necessary for their wants,--thus 'heaping up riches, not knowing who may gather them,' and endangering the soul to obtain that which they must leave behind them when they die. Others amass wealth, not actuated by the avarice of hoarding it up, but by the appetite for expending it; who collect unjustly that they may lavish profusely; these are equally foolish, and how important is that lesson given in the Scriptures."" Mr. Campbell opened the Bible which lay before him and read--",craving wealth strong one have more have few man content desire aggrandizement overcome master absurd witness care anxiety gain rich necessary want heap rich know gather endanger soul obtain leave die other amass wealth actuate avarice hoard appetite expend collect lavish foolish important lesson give open lay read

26,"    ""And he said, What shall I do? because I have no room where to     bestow my fruits.",say do have room bestow fruit 
27,"    ""And he said: This will I do; I will pull down my barns and build     greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.",say do pull barn build great bestow fruit goods

29,"    ""But God said unto him: Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be     required of thee.""",say fool night soul require 
30,"After a short silence, Mrs. Campbell observed, ""I have often reflected since I have been here upon what might have been our position had we decided upon remaining in England. We might at this moment have been in the greatest distress, even wanting a meal; and I have, therefore, often thanked God that He left us the means of coming here and providing for ourselves as we have done, and as I have no doubt shall, with His blessing, continue to do. How much better off are we at this moment than many thousands of our countrymen who remain in England! How many are starving! How many are driven into crime from want! while we have a good roof over our heads, sufficient clothing and more than sufficient food. We have, therefore, great reason to thank God for the mercies He has vouchsafed to us; He has heard our prayer, 'Give us this day our daily bread.'"" ""Yes,"" continued Mr. Campbell, ""'Give us this day our daily bread,' is all that we are taught to ask for; and it comprehends all; and yet how heartlessly is this pronounced by many of those who do repeat their daily prayers. So is the blessing asked at meals, which is by too many considered as a mere matter of form. They forget, that He who gives can also take away; and in their presumption, suppose their own ability and exertion to have been the sole means of procuring themselves a daily supply of food; thanking themselves rather than the Giver of all good. How many thousands are there who have been supplied with more than they require from their cradle down to their grave, without any grateful feeling toward Heaven; considering the butcher and baker as their providers, and the debt canceled as soon as the bills are paid. How different must be the feeling of the poor cottager, who is uncertain whether his labor may procure him and his family a meal for the morrow, who often suffers privation and hunger, and, what is more painful, witnesses the sufferings of those he loves. How earnest must be his prayer when he cries, 'Give us this day our daily bread.'""",short silence observe reflect position decide remain moment great distress want meal thank leave means come provide do have doubt blessing continue do good moment many thousand countryman remain many starve many drive crime want have good roof head sufficient clothing more sufficient food have great reason thank mercie vouchsafe hear prayer give day daily bread continue give day daily bread teach ask comprehend pronounce many repeat daily prayer blessing ask meal many consider mere matter form forget give take presumption suppose own ability exertion sole means procure daily supply food thank giver good many thousand supply more require cradle grave grateful feeling consider butcher baker provider debt cancel bill pay different feeling poor cottager uncertain labor procure family meal suffer privation hunger painful witness suffering love earnest prayer cry give day daily bread 
31,"This conversation had a very strong effect upon the party, and when they retired to rest, which they did shortly after, they laid their heads upon their pillows not only with resignation, but with thankfulness for the mercies which had been vouchsafed to them, and felt that in the wilderness they were under the eye of a watchful and gracious Providence.",conversation have strong effect party retire rest lay head pillow resignation thankfulness mercie vouchsafe feel wilderness eye watchful gracious
