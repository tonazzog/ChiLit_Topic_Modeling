2," Some time afterwards it happened one morning that Bevis was sitting on a haycock in the Home Field, eating a very large piece of cake, and thinking how extremely greedy the young rook was yonder across the meadow. For he was as big and as black as his father and mother, who were with him; and yet he kept on cawing to them to stuff his beak with sweets. Bevis, who had another large slice in his pocket, having stolen both of them from the cupboard just after breakfast, felt angry to see such greediness, and was going to get up to holloa at this ill-mannered rook, when he heard a grasshopper making some remarks close by the haycock.",time happen morning sit haycock eat large piece cake think greedy young rook meadow big black father mother keep caw stuff beak sweet have large slice pocket steal cupboard breakfast feel angry see such greediness go get holloa ill mannered rook hear grasshopper make remark haycock 
3,"""S----s,"" said the grasshopper to a friend, ""are you going down to the brook? I am, in a minute, so soon as I have hopped round this haycock, for there will be a grand show there presently. All the birds are going to bathe, as is their custom on Midsummer Day, and will be sure to appear in their best feathers. It is true some of them have bathed already, as they have to leave early in the morning, having business elsewhere. I spoke to the cricket just now on the subject, but he could not see that it was at all interesting. He is very narrow-minded, as you know, and cannot see anything beyond the mound where he lives.

6,"""I'm sure I do not know,"" said the grasshopper, speaking fast, for he was rather in a hurry to be gone, he never could stand still long together. ""All I can tell you is that on Midsummer Day every one of the birds has to go down to the brook and walk in and bathe; and it has been the law for so many, many years that no one can remember when it began. They like it very much, because they can show off their fine feathers, which are just now in full colour; and if you like to go with me you will be sure to enjoy it.""",sure know say grasshopper speak hurry gone stand tell bird have go brook walk bathe law many many year remember begin like show fine feather full colour like go sure enjoy 
7,"""So I will,"" said Bevis, and he followed the grasshopper, who hopped so far at every step that he had to walk fast to keep up with him. ""But why do the birds do it?""",say follow grasshopper hopp step have walk keep bird do 
8,"""Oh, I don't know why,"" said the grasshopper; ""what is why?""",know say grasshopper

10,"""Why?"" repeated the grasshopper; ""I never heard anybody say anything about that before. There is always a great deal of talking going on, for the trees have nothing else to do but to gossip with each other; but they never ask why.""",repeat grasshopper hear say be great deal talking go tree have else do gossip other ask 
11,"After that they went on in silence a good way except that the grasshopper cried ""S----s"" to his friends in the grass as he passed, and said good-morning also to a mole who peeped out for a moment.",go silence good way grasshopper cry friend grass pass say good morning mole peep moment 
12,"""Why don't you hop straight?"" said Bevis, presently. ""It seems to me that you hop first one side and then the other, and go in such a zig-zag fashion it will take us hours to reach the brook.""",hop say seem hop first side other go zig zag fashion take hour reach brook 
13,"""How very stupid you are,"" said the grasshopper. ""If you go straight of course you can only see just what is under your feet, but if you go first this way and then that, then you see everything. You are nearly as silly as the ants, who never see anything beautiful all their lives. Be sure you have nothing to do with the ants, Bevis; they are a mean, wretched, miserly set, quite contemptible and beneath notice. Now I go everywhere all round the field, and spend my time searching for lovely things; sometimes I find flowers, and sometimes the butterflies come down into the grass and tell me the news, and I am so fond of the sunshine, I sing to it all day long. Tell me, now, is there anything so beautiful as the sunshine and the blue sky, and the green grass, and the velvet and blue and spotted butterflies, and the trees which cast such a pleasant shadow and talk so sweetly, and the brook which is always running? I should like to listen to it for a thousand years.""",stupid say grasshopper go course see foot go way see silly ant see beautiful life sure have do ant mean wretched set contemptible notice go field spend time search lovely thing find flower butterfly come grass tell news fond sunshine sing day tell be beautiful sunshine blue sky green grass velvet blue spot butterfly tree cast pleasant shadow talk brook run like listen year 
14,"""I like you,"" said Bevis; ""jump into my hand, and I will carry you."" He held his hand out flat, and in a second up sprang the grasshopper, and alighted on his palm, and told him the way to go, and thus they went together merrily.",like say jump hand carry hold hand flat second up spring grasshopper alight palm tell way go go 
15,"""Are you sure the ants are so very stupid and wicked?"" asked Bevis, when the grasshopper had guided him through a gateway into the meadow by the brook.",sure ant stupid wicked ask grasshopper guide gateway meadow brook 
16,"""Indeed I am. It is true they declare that it is I who am wrong, and never lose a chance of chattering at me, because they are always laying up a store, and I wander about, laughing and singing. But then you see, Bevis dear, they are quite demented, and so led away by their greedy, selfish wishes that they do not even know that there is a sun. They say they cannot see it, and do not believe there is any sunshine, nor do they believe there are any stars. Now I do not sing at night, but I always go where I can see a star. I slept under a mushroom last night, and he told me he was pushing up as fast as he could before some one came and picked him to put on a gridiron. I do not lay up any store, because I know I shall die when the summer ends, and what is the use of wealth then? My store and my wealth is the sunshine, dear, and the blue sky, and the green grass, and the delicious brook who never ceases sing, sing, singing all day and night. And all the things are fond of me, the grass and the flowers, and the birds, and the animals, all of them love me. So you see I am richer than all the ants put together."" ""I would rather be you than an ant,"" said Bevis. ""I think I shall take you home and put you under a glass-case on the mantelpiece.""",true declare wrong lose chance chatter lay store wander laugh sing see dear demented lead greedy selfish wish know be sun say see believe be sunshine believe be star sing night go see star sleep mushroom last night tell push one come pick put gridiron lay store know die summer end use wealth store wealth sunshine dear blue sky green grass delicious brook cease sing sing sing day night thing fond grass flower bird animal love see richer ant put ant say think take put glass case mantelpiece 
17,"Off jumped the grasshopper in a moment, and fell so lightly on the grass it did not hurt him in the least, though it was as far as if Bevis had tumbled down out of the clouds. Bevis tried to catch him, but he jumped so nimbly this way and that, and hopped to and fro, and lay down in the grass, so that his green coat could not be seen. Bevis got quite hot trying to catch him, and seeing this, the grasshopper, much delighted, cried out: ""Are you not the stupid boy everybody is laughing at for letting the weasel go? You will never catch the weasel.""",jump grasshopper moment fall grass hurt least tumble cloud try catch jump way hopp for lay grass green coat see get hot try catch see grasshopper delight cry stupid boy laugh let weasel go catch weasel 
18,"""I'll stamp on you,"" said Bevis, in a great rage.",stamp say great rage 
19,"""S----s,"" called the grasshopper--who was frightened at this--to his friends, and in a minute there were twenty of them jumping all round in every direction, and as they were all just alike Bevis did not know which to run after. When he looked up there was the brook close by, and the drinking-place where the birds were to meet and bathe. It was a spot where the ground shelved gently down from the grass to the brook; the stream was very shallow and flowed over the sandy bottom with a gentle murmur.",call grasshopper frighten friend minute be jump direction alike know run look brook close drinking place bird meet bathe spot ground shelve grass brook stream shallow flow sandy bottom gentle murmur 
20,"He went down to the brook and stood on the bank, where it was high near a bush at the side of the drinking-place. ""Ah, dear little Sir Bevis!"" whispered a reed, bending towards him as the wind blew, ""please do not come any nearer, the bank is steep and treacherous, and hollow underneath where the water-rats run. So do not lean over after the forget-me-nots--they are too far for you. Sit down where you are, behind that little bush, and I will tell you all about the bathing."" Bevis sat down and picked a June rose from a briar that trailed over the bush, and asked why the birds bathed.",go brook stand bank high bush side drinking place dear little whisper reed bending wind blow come bank steep treacherous hollow water rat run lean forget not sit little bush tell bathing sit pick rise briar trail bush ask bird bath 
21,"""I do not know why,"" said the reed. ""There is no why at all. We have been listening to the brook, me and my family, for ever so many thousands of years, and though the brook has been talking and singing all that time, I never heard him ask why about anything. And the great oak, where you went to sleep, has been there, goodness me, nobody can tell how long, and every one of his leaves (he has had millions of them) have all been talking, but not one of them ever asked why; nor does the sun, nor the stars which I see every night shining in the clear water down there, so that I am quite sure there is no why at all.",know say reed be listen brook family many thousand year brook talk sing time hear ask great oak go sleep tell leave have million talk ask sun star see night shine clear water sure be 
22,"""But the birds come down to bathe every Midsummer Day, the goldfinches, and the sparrows, and the blackbirds, and the thrushes, and the swallows, and the wrens, and the robins, and almost every one of them, except two or three, whose great-grandfathers got into disgrace a long while ago. The rooks do not come because they are thieves, and steal the mussels, nor the crows, who are a very bad lot; the swan does not come either, unless the brook is muddy after a storm. The swan is so tired of seeing himself in the water that he quite hates it, and that is the reason he holds his neck so high, that he may not see more of himself than he can help.",bird come bathe goldfinche sparrow blackbird thrushe swallow wren robin one great grandfather get disgrace long while rook come thief steal mussel crow bad lot swan come brook muddy storm swan tired see water hate reason hold neck high see more help 
23,"""It is no use your asking the brook why they come, because even if he ever knew, he has forgotten. For the brook, though he sparkles so bright in the sun, and is so clear and sweet, and looks so young, is really so very, very old that he has quite lost his memory, and cannot remember what was done yesterday. He did not even know which way the moor-hen went just now, when I inquired, having a message to send to my relations by the osier-bed yonder.",use ask brook come know forget brook sparkle bright sun clear sweet look young old lose memory remember do yesterday know way moor hen go inquire have message send relation osier bed yonder 
24,"""But I have heard the heron say--he is talkative sometimes at night when you are asleep, dear; he was down here this morning paddling about--that the birds in the beginning learnt to sing by listening to the brook, and perhaps that is the reason they pay him such deep respect. Besides, everybody knows that according to an ancient prophecy which was delivered by the raven before he left this country, if only the birds can all bathe in the brook on Midsummer Day and hold their tongues, and not abuse one another or quarrel, they will be able to compose their differences, and ever afterwards live happily together.",hear heron say talkative night asleep dear morning paddle bird beginning learn sing listen brook reason pay such deep respect know accord ancient prophecy deliver raven leave country bird bathe brook hold tongue abuse quarrel able compose difference live 
25,"""Then they could drive away the hawk, for there is only one hawk to ten thousand finches, and if they only marched shoulder to shoulder all together they could kill him with ease. They could smother the cat even, by all coming down at once upon her, or they could carry up a stone and drop on her head; and as for the crow, that old coward, if he saw them coming he would take wing at once. But as they cannot agree, the hawk, and the cat, and the crow do as they like. For the chaffinches all fight one another, you heard them challenging, and saw them go to battle, and then when at last they leave off and are good fellows again, they all flock together and will have nothing to do with the goldfinches, or the blackbirds. It is true the wood-pigeons, and the rooks, and the starlings, and the fieldfares and redwings are often about in the same field, but that is only because they eat the same things; if a hawk comes they all fly away from each other, and do not unite and fight him as they might do.",drive hawk be hawk finch march shoulder shoulder kill ease smother cat come carry stone drop head crow old coward see come take wing agree hawk cat crow do like chaffinch fight hear challenging see go battle last leave good fellow flock have do goldfinche blackbird true wood pigeon rook starling fieldfare redwing same field eat same thing hawk come fly other unite fight do 
26,"""But if once they could come down to the brook on Midsummer Day, and never quarrel, then, according to the prophecy I told you of, all this diversity would cease, and they would be able to do just as they pleased, and build three or four nests in the summer instead of one, and drive away and kill all the hawks, and crows, and cats. They tried to do it, I can't tell you how many years, but they could never succeed, for there was always a dispute about something, so at last they gave it up, and it was almost forgotten (for they came to the conclusion that it was no use to try), till last year, when the mole, the one that spoke to the grasshopper just now, reminded them of it.",come brook quarrel accord prophecy tell diversity cease able do pleased build nest summer drive kill hawk crow cat try do tell many year succeed be dispute last give forget come conclusion use try last year mole one speak grasshopper remind 
27,"""Now the reason the mole reminded them of it was because one day a hawk came down too quick for his wife (who was peeping out of doors), and snapped her up in a minute, so he bore the hawk a grudge, and set about to seek for vengeance. And as he could not fly or get at the hawk he thought he would manage it through the other birds. So one morning when the green woodpecker came down to pick up the ants with his tongue, the mole looked out and promised to show him where there was a capital feast, and to turn up the ground for him, if in return he would fly all round the forest and the fields, and cry shame on the birds for letting the hawk go on as he did when they could so easily prevent it, just by holding their tongues one day.",reason mole remind day hawk come wife peep door snap minute bear hawk grudge set seek vengeance fly get hawk think manage other bird morning green woodpecker come pick ant tongue mole look promise show be capital feast turn ground return fly forest field cry shame bird let hawk go do prevent hold tongue day 
28,"""This the woodpecker promised to do, and after he had feasted off he went, and having tapped on a tree to call attention, he began to cry shame upon them, and having a very loud voice he soon let them know his mind. At which the birds resolved to try again, and, do you know, last year they very nearly succeeded. For it rained hard all Midsummer Day, and when the birds came down to the brook they were so bedraggled, and benumbed, and cold, and unhappy, that they had nothing to say for themselves, but splashed about in silence, and everything would have happened just right had not a rook, chancing to pass over, accidentally dropped something he was carrying in his bill, which fell into the flags there.",woodpecker promise do feast go tap tree call attention begin cry shame have loud voice let know mind bird resolve try know last year succeed rain bird come brook bedraggled benumbed cold unhappy have say splash silence happen have rook chance pass drop carry bill fall flag 
29,"""The starling forgot himself, and remarked he supposed it was an acorn; when the wood-pigeon called him a donkey, as the acorns were not yet ripe, nor large enough to eat; and the usual uproar began again. But afterwards, when they talked it over, they said to each other that, as they had so nearly done it, it must be quite possible, and next year they would all hold their tongues as tight as wax, though the sun should drop out of the sky. Now the hawk, of course, being so high up, circling round, saw and heard all this, and he was very much alarmed, as they had so nearly succeeded; and he greatly feared lest next year, what he had dreaded so long would come to pass, as the raven had foretold.",starling forget remark suppose acorn wood pigeon call donkey acorn ripe large eat usual uproar begin talk say other do possible next year hold tongue tight wax sun drop sky hawk course high circle see hear alarmed succeed fear next year dread come pass raven foretell 
30,"""So he flew down and took counsel of his ancient friend the weasel. What they said I cannot tell you, nor has it been found out, but I have no doubt they made up something wicked between them, and it is greatly to be regretted that you let the weasel go, for the hawk, sharp as he is, is not very clever at anything new, and if he had not got the weasel to advise him I suspect he would not be much after all. We shall see presently what they have contrived--I am much mistaken if they have not put their heads together for something.

39,"""You know you hate me,"" said the perch; ""because your great-great-grandfather swallowed mine in a rage, and my great-great-grandfather's spines stuck in your great-great-grandfather's throat and killed him. And ever since then, Bevis dear, they have done nothing but tell tales against me. I did not touch the roach; the pike wanted him, I know, for breakfast.""",know hate say perch great great grandfather swallow rage great great grandfather spine stick great great grandfather throat kill dear do tell tale touch roach pike want know breakfast

43,"""Well, who did it then?"" said Bevis.",do say 
44,"""The fact is,"" said a frog on the verge of the stream, ""they are all as bad as one another; the perch is a rogue and a thief; the pike is a monster of iniquity; the heron never misses a chance of gobbling up somebody; and as for the drake, for all his glossy neck and his innocent look, he is as ready to pick up anything as the rest.""",fact say frog verge stream bad perch rogue thief pike monster iniquity heron misse chance gobble drake glossy neck innocent look ready pick rest

47,"""Bevis,"" began the reed; ""Bevis dear. Ah, ah!"" His voice died away, for as the sun got higher the wind fell, and the reed could only speak while the wind blew. The flag laughed as the reed was silenced.",begin reed dear voice die sun get high wind fall reed speak wind blow flag laugh reed silence 
48,"""You need not laugh,"" said the perch; ""you can only talk while the water waggles you.

49,"""The birds are coming,"" said the frog. ""I should like to swim across to the other side, where I can see better, but I am afraid of the pike and the drake. Bevis dear, fling that piece of dead stick at them.""",bird come say frog like swim other side see good afraid pike drake dear fling piece dead stick 
50,"Bevis picked up the dead stick and flung it at the drake, who hastened off down the stream; the pike, startled at the splash, darted up the brook, and the frog swam over in a minute. Then the birds began to come down to the drinking-place, where the shore shelved very gently, and the clear shallow water ran over the sandy bottom. They were all in their very best and brightest feathers, and as the sun shone on them and they splashed the water and strutted about, Bevis thought he had never seen anything so beautiful.",pick dead stick flung drake hasten stream pike startle splash dart brook frog swim minute bird begin come drinking place shore shelve clear shallow water run sandy bottom good brightest feather sun shine splash water strut think see beautiful 
51,"They did not all bathe, for some of them were specially permitted only to drink instead, but they all came, and all in their newest dresses. So bright was the goldfinch's wing, that the lark, though she did not dare speak, had no doubt she rouged. The sparrow, brushed and neat, so quiet and subdued in his brown velvet, looked quite aristocratic among so much flaunting colour. As for the blackbird, he had carefully washed himself in the spring before he came to bathe in the brook, and he glanced round with a bold and defiant air, as much as to say: ""There is not one of you who has so yellow a bill, and so beautiful a black coat as I have"". In the bush the bullfinch, who did not care much to mix with the crowd, moved restlessly to and fro. The robin looked all the time at Bevis, so anxious was he for admiration. The wood-pigeon, very consequential, affected not to see the dove, whom Bevis longed to stroke, but could not, as he had promised the reed to keep still.",bathe permit drink come new dress bright goldfinch wing lark dare speak have doubt rouge sparrow brush neat quiet subdued brown velvet look aristocratic much flaunt colour blackbird wash spring come bathe brook glance bold defiant air say be have yellow bill beautiful black coat have bush bullfinch care much mix crowd move for robin look time anxious admiration wood pigeon consequential affect see dove long stroke promise reed keep 
52,"All this time the birds, though they glanced at one another, and those who were on good terms, like the chaffinch and the greenfinch, exchanged a nod, had not spoken a word, and the reed, as a puff came, whispered to Bevis that the prophecy would certainly come to pass, and they would all be as happy as ever they could be. Why ever did they not make haste and fly away, now they had all bathed or sipped? The truth was, they liked to be seen in their best feathers, and none of them could make up their minds to be the first to go home; so they strutted to and fro in the sunshine. Bevis, in much excitement, could hardly refrain from telling them to go.",time bird glance good term chaffinch greenfinch exchange nod speak word reed puff come whisper prophecy come pass happy make haste fly bath sipp truth like see good feather make mind first go strut sunshine much excitement refrain tell go 
53,"He looked up into the sky, and there was the hawk, almost up among the white clouds, soaring round and round, and watching all that was proceeding. Almost before he could look down again a shadow went by, and a cuckoo flew along very low, just over the drinking-place.",look sky be hawk white cloud soar watch proceed look shadow go cuckoo fly low drinking place 
54,"""Cuckoo!"" he cried, ""cuckoo! The goldfinch has the prettiest dress,"" and off he went.",cuckoo cry cuckoo goldfinch have prettiest dress go 
55,"Now the hawk had bribed the cuckoo, who was his cousin, to do this, and the cuckoo was not at all unwilling, for he had an interest himself in keeping the birds divided, so he said that although he had made up his mind to go on his summer tour, leaving his children to be taken care of by the wagtail, he would stop a day or two longer, to manage this little business. No sooner had the cuckoo said this, than there was a most terrible uproar, and all the birds cried out at once. The blackbird was so disgusted that he flew straight off, chattering all across the field and up the hedge. The bullfinch tossed his head, and asked the goldfinch to come up in the bush and see which was strongest. The greenfinch and the chaffinch shrieked with derision; the wood-pigeon turned his back, and said ""Pooh!"" and went off with a clatter. The sparrow flew to tell his mates on the house, and you could hear the chatter they made about it, right down at the brook. But the wren screamed loudest of all, and said that the goldfinch was a painted impostor, and had not got half so much gold as the yellow-hammer. So they were all scattered in a minute, and Bevis stood up.",hawk bribe cuckoo cousin do cuckoo unwilling have interest keep bird divide say make mind go summer tour leave child take care wagtail stop day manage little business have cuckoo say be terrible uproar bird cry blackbird disgusted fly chatter field hedge bullfinch toss head ask goldfinch come bush see strong greenfinch chaffinch shriek derision wood pigeon turn back say go clatter sparrow fly tell mate house hear chatter make brook wren scream loudest say goldfinch paint impostor get half much gold yellow hammer scatter minute stand 
56,"""Ah!"" said the reed, ""I am very sorry. It was the hawk's doings, I am sure, and he was put up to the trick by the weasel, and now the birds will never agree, for every year they will remember this. Is it not a pity they are so vain? Bevis dear, you are going, I see. Come down again, dear, when the wind blows stronger, and I will tell you another story. Ah! ah!"" he sighed; and was silent as the puff ceased.",say reed sorry hawk doing sure put trick weasel bird agree year remember pity vain dear go see come dear wind blow strong tell story sigh silent puff cease 
57,"Bevis, tired of sitting so long, went wandering up the brook, peeping into the hollow willow trees, wishing he could dive like the rats, and singing to the brook, who sang to him again, and taught him a very old tune. By-and-by he came to the hatch, where the brook fell over with a splash, and a constant bubbling, and churning, and gurgling. A kingfisher, who had been perched on the rail of the hatch, flew off when he saw Bevis, whistling: ""Weep! weep!""",tired sit go wonder brook peep hollow willow tree wish dive rat sing brook sing teach old tune come hatch brook fall splash constant bubbling churning gurgle kingfisher perch rail hatch fly see whistle weep weep 
58,"""Why do you say, weep, weep?"" said Bevis. ""Is it because the birds are so foolish?"" But the kingfisher did not stay to answer. The water rushing over the hatch made so pleasant a sound that Bevis, delighted with its tinkling music, sat down to listen and to watch the bubbles, and see how far they would swim before they burst. Then he threw little pieces of stick on the smooth surface above the hatch to see them come floating over and plunge under the bubbles, and presently appear again by the foam on the other side among the willow roots.",say weep weep say bird foolish kingfisher stay answer water rush hatch make pleasant sound delight tinkling music sit listen watch bubble see swim burst throw little piece stick smooth surface hatch see come float plunge bubble appear foam other side willow root 
59,"Still more sweetly sang the brook, so that even restless Bevis stayed to hearken, though he could not quite make out what he was saying. A moor-hen stole out from the rushes farther up, seeing that Bevis was still enchanted with the singing, and began to feed among the green weeds by the shore. A water-rat came out of his hole and fed in the grass close by. A blue dragon-fly settled on a water-plantain. Up in the ash-tree a dove perched and looked down at Bevis. Only the gnats were busy; they danced and danced till Bevis thought they must be dizzy, just over the water.",sing brook restless stay hearken make say moor hen steal rushe see enchant singing begin feed green weed shore water rat come hole feed grass blue dragon fly settle water plantain ash tree dove perch look gnat busy dance dance think dizzy water 
60,"""Sing slower,"" said Bevis presently, ""I want to hear what you are saying."" So the brook sang slower, but then it was too low, and he could not catch the words. Then he thought he should like to go over to the other side, and see what there was up the high bank among the brambles. He looked at the hatch, and saw that there was a beam across the brook, brown with weeds, which the water only splashed against and did not cover deeply. By holding tight to the rail and putting his feet on the beam he thought he could climb over.",sing slow say want hear say brook sing slow low catch word think like go other side see be high bank bramble look hatch see be beam brook brown weed water splash cover hold tight rail put foot beam think climb 
61,"He went down nearer and took hold of the rail, and was just going to put his foot on the beam, when the brook stopped singing, and said: ""Bevis dear, do not do that; it is very deep here, and the beam is very slippery, and if you should fall I would hold you up as long as I could, but I am not very strong, and should you come to harm I should be very unhappy. Do please go back to the field, and if you will come down some day when I am not in such a hurry, I will sing to you very slowly, and tell you everything I know. And if you come very gently, and on tip-toe, you will see the kingfisher, or perhaps the heron."" Bevis, when he heard this, went back, and followed the hedge a good way, not much thinking where he was going, but strolling along in the shadow, and humming to himself the tune he had learnt from the brook. By-and-by he spied a gap in the hedge under an ash-tree, so he went through in a minute, and there was a high bank with trees like a copse, and bramble-bushes and ferns. He went on up the bank, winding in and out the brambles, and at last it was so steep he had to climb on his hands and knees, and suddenly as he came round a bramble-bush there was the Long Pond, such a great piece of water, all gleaming in the sunshine and reaching far away to the woods and the hills, as if it had no end.",go take hold rail go put foot beam brook stop sing say dear do deep beam slippery fall hold strong come harm unhappy go field come day hurry sing tell know come tip toe see kingfisher heron hear go follow hedge good way think go stroll shadow hum tune learn brook spy gap hedge ash tree go minute be high bank tree copse bramble bush fern go bank wind bramble last steep have climb hand knee come bramble bush long great piece water gleam sunshine reach wood hill have end
