1,CHAPTER 50. THE HEART OF LITTLE NAN.,heart little nan 
2,"For several days now Annie had lain unconscious in Mrs Williams's little bedroom; the kind-hearted woman could not find it in her heart to send the sick child away.  Her husband and the neighbours expostulated with her, and said that Annie was only a poor little waif.",several day lain unconscious little bedroom kind hearted woman find heart send sick child husband neighbour expostulate say poor little waif 
3,"""She has no call on you,"" said Jane Allen, a hard-featured woman who lived next door.  ""Why should you put yourself out just for a sick lass? and she'll be much better on in the workhouse infirmary.""",have call say feature woman live next door put sick lass good workhouse infirmary 
4,"But Mrs Williams shook her head at her hard-featured and hard-hearted neighbour, and resisted her husband's entreaties.",shake head hard feature hard hearted neighbour resist husband entreaty 
5,"""Eh!"" she said, ""but the poor lamb needs a good bit of mothering, and I misdoubt me she wouldn't get much of that in the infirmary.""",say poor lamb need good bit mothering misdoubt get much infirmary 
6,"So Annie stayed, and tossed from side to side of her little bed, and murmured unintelligible words, and grew daily a little weaker and a little more delirious.  The parish doctor called, and shook his head over her: he was not a particularly clever man, but he was the best the Williamses could afford.  While Annie suffered and went deeper into that valley of humiliation and weakness which leads to the gate of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, little Nan played with Peggy Williams, and accustomed herself after the fashion of little children to all the ways of her new and humble home.",stay toss side side little bed murmure unintelligible word grow little weak little delirious parish doctor call shake head clever man good afford suffer go valley humiliation weakness lead gate little play accustom fashion little child way new humble home 
7,"It was on the eighth day of Annie's fever that the Misses Bruce discovered her, and on the evening of that day Mrs Willis knelt by her little favourite's bed.  A better doctor had been called in, and all that money could procure had been got now for poor Annie; but the second doctor considered her case even more critical, and said that the close air of the cottage was much against her recovery.",eighth day fever discover evening day knolt little favourite bed good doctor call money procure get poor second doctor consider case critical say close air cottage recovery 
8,"""I didn't make that caricature; I took the girls into the fairies' field, but I never pasted that caricature into Cecil's book.  I know you don't believe me, Cecil; but do you think I would really do anything so mean about one whom I love?  No, no!  I am innocent!  God knows it. Yes, I am glad of that--God knows it.""",make caricature take girl fairy field paste caricature book know believe think do mean love innocent know glad know 
9,"Over, and over in Mrs Willis's presence these piteous words would come from the fever-stricken child, but always when she came to the little sentence ""God knows I am innocent,"" her voice would grow tranquil, and a faint and sweet smile would play round her lips.",presence piteous word come fever stricken child come little sentence know innocent voice grow tranquil faint sweet smile play lip 
10,"Late that night a carriage drew up at a little distance from the cottage, and a moment or two afterwards Mrs Willis was called out of the room to speak to Cecil Temple.",night carriage draw little distance cottage moment call room speak 
11,"""I have found out the truth about Annie; I have come at once to tell you,"" she said; and then she repeated the substance of Hester's and Susan's story.",find truth come tell say repeat substance story 
12,"""God help me for having misjudged her,"" murmured the head-mistress; then she bade Cecil ""good-night,"" and returned to the sick-room.",help misjudg murmure head mistress bid good night return sick room 
13,"The next time Annie broke out with her piteous wail, ""They believe me guilty--Mrs Willis does--they all do,"" the mistress laid her hand with a firm and gentle pressure on the child's arm.",next time break piteous wail believe guilty do mistress lay hand firm gentle pressure child arm 
14,"""Not now, my dear,"" she said, in a slow, clear, and emphatic voice. ""God has shown your governess the truth, and she believes in you.""",dear say slow clear emphatic voice show governess truth believe 
15,"The very carefully-uttered words pierced through the clouded brain; for a moment Annie lay quite still, with her bright and lovely eyes fixed on her teacher.",utter word pierce cloude brain moment lay bright lovely eye fix teacher

18,"""And you believe in me?""",believe 
19,"""I do most absolutely.""",
20,"""God does, too, you know,"" answered Annie--bringing out the words quickly, and turning her head to the other side.  The fever had once more gained supremacy, and she rambled on unceasingly through the dreary night.",know answer bring word turn head other side fever gain supremacy ramble dreary night 
21,"Now, however, when the passionate words broke out, ""They believe me guilty,"" Mrs Willis always managed to quiet her by saying, ""I know you are innocent.""",passionate word break believe guilty manage quiet say know innocent 
22,"The next day at noon those girls who had not gone home--for many had started by the morning train--were wandering aimlessly about the grounds.  Mr Everard had gone to see Annie, and had promised to bring back the latest tidings about her.",next day noon girl go many start morning train wonder grounds go see promise bring late tiding 
23,"Hester, holding little Nan's hand--for she could scarcely bear to have her recovered treasure out of sight--had wandered away from the rest of her companions, and had seated herself with Nan under a large oak-tree which grew close to the entrance of the avenue.  She had come here in order to be the very first to see Mr Everard on his return.  Nan had climbed into Hester's lap, and Hester had buried her aching head in little Nan's bright curls, when she started suddenly to her feet and ran forward.  Her quick ears had detected the sound of wheels.",hold little hand bear have recover treasure sight wander rest companion seat large oak tree grow close entrance avenue come order very first see return climb lap bury ach head little bright curl start foot run quick ear detect sound wheel 
24,"How soon Mr Everard had returned; surely the news was bad!  She flew to the gate, and held it open in order to avoid the short delay which the lodge-keeper might cause in coming to unfasten it.  She flushed however, vividly, and felt half inclined to retreat into the shade, when she saw that the gentleman who was approaching was not Mr Everard, but a tall, handsome, and foreign-looking man, who drove a light dog-cart himself. The moment he saw Hester with little Nan clinging to her skirts he stopped short.",return news bad fly gate hold open order avoid short delay lodge keeper cause come unfast flush feel half inclined retreat shade see gentleman approach tall handsome foreign look man drive light dog cart moment see little cling skirt stop short

42,"""Sick, is she?"" he answered.

50,"So furiously did Captain Forest drive that in a very little over an hour's time his panting horse stopped at a few steps from the cottage. He called to a boy to hold him, and, accompanied by Hester, and carrying Nan in his arms, he stood on the threshold of Mrs Williams' humble little abode.  Mr Everard was coming out.",drive little hour time panting horse stop few step cottage call boy hold accompany carry arm stand threshold humble little abode come

57,"Captain Forest went first into the sick-room; Hester waited outside. She had the little kitchen to herself, for all the Williamses, with the exception of the good mother, had moved for the time being to other quarters.  Surely Mr Everard would come for her in a moment?  Surely Captain Forest, who had gone into the sick-room with Nan in his arms, would quickly return?  There was no sound.  All was absolute quiet.  How soon would Hester be summoned?  Could she--could she bear to look at Annie's dying face?  Her agony drove her down on her knees.",go sick room wait have little kitchen exception good mother move time other quarter come moment go sick room arm return be sound absolute quiet summon bear look die face agony drive knee 
58,"""Oh, if you would only spare Annie!"" she prayed to God.  Then she wiped her eyes.  This terrible suspense seemed more than she could bear. Suddenly the bedroom door was softly and silently opened, and Mr Everard came out.",spare pray wipe eye terrible suspense seem more bear bedroom door open come 
59,"""She sleeps,"" he said; ""there is a shadow of hope.  Little Nan has done it.  Nan asked to lie down beside her and she said, `Poor Annie! poor Annie!' and stroked her cheek; and in some way, I don't know how, the two have gone to sleep together.  Annie did not even glance at her father; she was quite taken up with Nan.  You can come to the door and look at her, Hester.""",sleep say be shadow hope little do ask lie say poor poor stroke cheek way know go sleep glance father take come door look
