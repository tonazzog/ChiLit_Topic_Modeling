1,CHAPTER 5. THE HEAD-MISTRESS.,head mistress 
2,"Annie Forest had scarcely left the room before Miss Danesbury appeared with a message for Hester, who was to come with her directly to see Mrs Willis.  The poor shy girl felt only too glad to leave behind her the cruel, staring, and now by no means approving eyes of her school-mates. She had overheard several of their whispers, and felt rather alarmed at her own act.  But Hester, shy as she was, could be very tenacious of an idea.  She had taken a dislike to Annie Forest, and she was quite determined to be true to what she considered her convictions--namely, that Annie was underbred and common, and not at all the kind of girl whom her mother would have cared for her to know.  The little girl followed Miss Danesbury in silence.  They crossed the stone hall together, and now passing through another baize door, found themselves once more in the handsome entrance-hall.  They walked across this hall to a door carefully protected from all draughts by rich plush curtains, and Miss Danesbury, turning the handle, and going a step or two into the room, said in her gentle voice--",leave room appear message come see poor shy girl feel glad leave cruel stare means approve eye school mate overhear several whisper feel alarmed own act shy tenacious idea take dislike determined true consider conviction underbred common kind girl mother care know little girl follow silence cross stone hall pass baize door find handsome entrance hall walk hall door protect draught rich plush curtain turn handle go step room say gentle voice

4,"Miss Danesbury then withdrew, and Hester ventured to raise her eyes and to look timidly at the head-mistress.",withdraw venture raise eye look head mistress 
5,"A tall woman, with a beautiful face and silvery white hair, came instantly to meet her, laid her two hands on the girl's shoulders, and then, raising her shy little face, imprinted a kiss on her forehead.",tall woman beautiful face silvery white hair come meet lay hand girl shoulder raise shy little face imprint kiss forehead 
6,"""Your mother was one of my earliest pupils, Hester,"" she said, ""and you are--no--"" after a pause, ""you are not very like her.  You are her child, however, my dear, and as such you have a warm welcome from me. Now, come and sit by the fire, and let us talk.""",mother early pupil say pause child dear such have warm welcome come sit fire let talk 
7,"Hester did not feel nearly so constrained with this graceful and gracious lady as she had done with her school-mates.  The atmosphere of the room recalled her beloved mother's boudoir at home.  The rich, dove-coloured satin dress, the cap made of Mechlin lace which softened and shaded Mrs Willis's silvery hair, appeared homelike to the little girl, who had grown up accustomed to all the luxuries of wealth.  Above all, the head-mistress's mention of her mother drew her heart toward the beautiful face, and attracted her toward the rich, full tones of a voice which could be powerful and commanding at will.  Mrs Willis, notwithstanding her white hair, had a youthful face, and Hester made the comment which came first to her lips--",feel constrain graceful gracious lady do school mate atmosphere room recall beloved mother boudoir home rich dove coloured satin dress cap make lace soften shade silvery hair appear homelike little girl grow accustom luxury wealth head mistress mention mother draw heart beautiful face attract rich full tone voice powerful commanding will notwithstand white hair have youthful face make comment come lip 
8,"""I did not think you were old enough to have taught my mother.""",think old teach mother 
9,"""I am sixty, dear, and I have kept this school for thirty years.  Your mother was not the only pupil who sent her children to be taught by me when the time came.  Now, you can sit on this stool by the fire and tell me about your home.  Your mother--ah, poor child, you would rather not talk about her just yet.  Helen's daughter must have strong feelings-- ah, yes; I see, I see.  Another time, darling, when you know me better. Now tell me about your little sister, and your father.  You do not know, perhaps, that I am Nan's godmother?""",dear keep school year mother only pupil send child teach time come sit stool fire tell home mother poor child talk daughter have strong feeling see see time darling know good tell little sister father know godmother 
10,"After this the head-mistress and the new pupil had a long conversation. Hester forgot her shyness; her whole heart had gone out instantly to this beautiful woman who had known, and loved, and taught her mother.",head mistress new pupil have long conversation forget shyness whole heart go beautiful woman know love teach mother 
11,"""I will try to be good at school,"" she said at last; ""but, oh, please, Mrs Willis, it does not seem to me to-night as if school-life could be happy.""",try good school say last seem night school life happy 
12,"""It has its trials, Hester; but the brave and the noble girls often find this time of discipline one of the best in their lives--good at the time, very good to look back on by-and-by.  You will find a miniature world around you; you will be surrounded by temptations; and you will have rare chances of proving whether your character can be strong and great and true.  I think, as a rule, my girls are happy, and as a rule they turn out well.  The great motto of life here, Hester, is earnestness.  We are earnest in our work, we are earnest in our play.  A half-hearted girl has no chance at Lavender House.  In play-time, laugh with the merriest, my child: in school-hours, study with the most studious.  Do you understand me?""",have trial brave noble girl find time discipline good life good time good look find miniature world surround temptation have rare chance prove character strong great true think rule girl happy rule turn great motto life earnestness earnest work earnest play half hearted girl have chance play time laugh merriest child school hour study studious understand 
13,"""I try to, a little,"" said Hester, ""but it seems all very strange just now.""",try little say seem strange 
14,"""No doubt it does, and at first you will have to encounter many perplexities and to fight many battles.  Never mind, if you have the right spirit within you, you will come out on the winning side.  Now, tell me, have you made any acquaintances as yet among the girls?""",doubt first have encounter many perplexity fight many battle mind have right spirit come win side tell make acquaintance girl 
15,"""Yes--Cecil Temple has been kind to me.""",kind 
16,"""Cecil is one of my dearest pupils; cultivate her friendship, Hester-- she is honourable, she is sympathising.  I am not afraid to say that Cecil has a great heart.""",dearest pupil cultivate friendship honourable sympathise afraid say have great heart 
17,"""There is another girl,"" continued Hester, ""who has spoken to me.  I need not make her my friend, need I?""",be girl continue speak make friend need 
18,"""Who is she, dear?""",dear 
19,"""Miss Forest--I don't like her.""",like 
20,"""What! our school favourite.  You will change your mind, I expect--but that is the gong for prayers.  You shall come with me to chapel, to-night, and I will introduce you to Mr Everard.""",school favourite change mind expect gong prayer come chapel night introduce
