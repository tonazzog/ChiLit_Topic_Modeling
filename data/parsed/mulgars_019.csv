1,CHAPTER XIX.,
2," The travellers marched slowly, keeping sharp watch, their cudgels ready in their hands. Behind them, paled by the moonlight, shook the fiery silver of the Salemnāgar. With this at their backs and that North Pole, Mōōt, in huge congealment, a little to their left, they made their way at an angle across the open snow, and approached the tangled thickets. Here they walked more closely together, with heads aslant and tails in air, like little old men, like pedlars, blinking and spying, wishing beyond measure they were sitting in comfort around their watch-fire. The farther they zigzagged betwixt the thorns, the more doubtful grew the way. For the thorn-trees rise all so equal in height and thickness they often with their tops shut out the stars, and there was nothing by which the travellers could mark what way they went.",traveller march keep sharp watch cudgel ready hand pale moonlight shake fiery silver back huge congealment little left make way angle open snow approach tangled thicket walk head aslant tail air little old man pedlar blinking spying wish measure sit comfort watch fire far zigzagg betwixt thorn doubtful grow way thorn tree rise equal height thickness top shut star be traveller mark way go 
3,"Still they pressed on, their hairy faces to the night-wind, which Ghibba had observed before starting was drifting from the north. They shuffled crisply over the snow, coughing softly, and gurring in their throats, winding in and out between the trees, and casting lean, gigantic shadows across the open spaces. For so dazzling bright the moon gleamed, she almost put out the smoky flare of their torches. But it gave the Mulgars more courage to march encompassed with their own light. Their packs were heavy, the thickets sloped continually upward. But the poison-thorns curl backward beneath the drooping hood of their leaves by night--in the hours, that is, when, it is said, they distil their poison--so the travellers were no longer fretted by their stings. Thus, then, they gradually advanced till Mōōt was left behind them, and out of the grey night rose Mulgarmeerez, mightiest of Arakkaboa's peaks, whose snows have known no Mulgar footprints since the world began.",press hairy face night wind observe start drift north shuffle snow cough gurr throat wind tree cast lean gigantic shadow open space dazzling bright moon gleam put smoky flare torche give more courage march encompass own light pack heavy thicket slope poison thorn curl droop hood leave night hour say distil poison traveller fret sting advance leave grey night rise mightiest peak snow know footprint world begin 
4,"Only the whish of the travellers' feet on the snow was to be heard, when suddenly all with one accord stopped dead, as if a voice had cried, ""Halt!""",whish traveller foot snow hear accord stop dead voice cry halt 
5,"Their torches faintly crackled, their smoke rising in four straight pillars towards the stars. And they heard, as if everywhere around them in the air, clear yet marvellously small voices singing with a thin and pining sound like glass. It floated near, this tiny, multitudinous music--so near that the travellers drew back their face with wide-open eyes. Then it seemed out of the infinite distance to come, echoing across the moonlit spars that towered above their heads.",torche crackle smoke rise straight pillar star hear air clear small voice sing thin pine sound glass float tiny multitudinous music traveller draw face wide open eye seem infinite distance come echoing moonlit spar tower head 
6,"And Ghibba said softly, jerking up his bundle and peering around him from beneath his eye-bandage: ""Courage, my kinsmen! it is the danger-song of Tishnar we hear, who loves the fearless.""",say jerk bundle peer eye bandage courage kinsmen danger song hear love fearless 
7,"At this one of the Men of the Mountains thrust up his pointed chin, and said, wagging his head: ""Why do we march like this at night, Mulla-moona? These are not our mountain-passes. Let us camp here while we are still alive, and burn a great watch-fire till morning.""",one thrust point chin say wag head march night mountain pass let camp alive burn great watch fire morning 
8,"""You have faggots, Cousin of a Skeeto,"" said Ghibba. ""Kindle a fire for yourself, and catch us up at daybreak.""",have faggot cousin say kindle fire catch daybreak 
9,"The Mountain-men laughed wheezily, for now the singing had died away. On they pushed again. But now the thorn-trees gathered yet closer together, so that the Mulgars could no longer walk in company, but had to straggle up by ones or twos as best they could. Still up and up they clambered, laying hold of the thick tufts of leaves sticky with poison to drag themselves forward. Many times they had to pause to recover their breath, and Nod turned giddy to look down on the moon-dappled forest through which they had so heavily ascended. Thus they continued, until, quite without warning, Thumb, who was leading, broke out into one loud, hard, short bark of fear, for he suddenly found himself standing beneath contorted branches on the verge of another and wider plateau of snow. He stood motionless, leaning heavily on his cudgel, the knuckles of his other hand resting in the snow, his breath caught back, and his head stooping forward between his shoulders, staring on and on between astonishment and fear.",man laugh singing die push thorn tree gather walk company have straggle one two good clamber lay hold thick tuft leave sticky poison drag many time have pause recover breath turn giddy look moon dapple forest ascend continue warning lead break loud hard short bark fear find stand contort branch verge wide plateau snow stand motionless lean cudgel knuckle other hand rest snow breath catch head stoop shoulder stare astonishment fear

11,"For there, all along the opposite ridge, as it were on the margin of an enormous platter, stood as if frozen in the moonlight the monstrous silver-haired Meermuts of Mulgarmeerez, guarding the enchanted orchards of Tishnar. Thumb stood in deep shadow, for instantly, at sight of these shapes, as one by one the travellers came straggling up together, they quenched their hissing torches in the snow. No sign made the Meermuts that they had seen the little quaking band of lean and ragged Mulgars. But even a squirrel cracking a nut could have been heard across these windless and icy altitudes. And even now it seemed that bark of fear went echoing from spur to spur. The wretched Mulgars could only stand and gaze in helpless confusion at the phantoms, whose eyes shone dismally in the moon beneath their silver hair and great purple caps. The Meermuts stood, as it were, for a living rampart all down the untrodden snow towards the great Pit of Mulgarmeerez till lost in the faint grey mists of the mountains.",opposite ridge margin enormous platter stand freeze moonlight monstrous silver hair guard enchanted orchard thumb stand deep shadow sight shape traveller come straggle quench hissing torche snow sign make see little quak band lean ragge squirrel crack nut hear windless icy altitude seem bark fear go echoing spur spur wretch stand gaze helpless confusion phantom eye shine moon silver hair great purple cap stand living rampart untrodden snow great pit lose faint grey mist mountain 
12,"""What's to be done now, Prince of Ladder-makers?"" said Thumb presently. ""Are we not weary of wandering? There's room for us all in those great shadowy bellies.""",do maker say weary wonder be room great shadowy belly 
13,"""Itthiluthi thoth 'Meermut' onnoth anoot oonoothi,"" lisped one of the Moona-mulgars--that is to say, in their own language, ""But maybe these Meermuts gnaw before swallowing.""",lisp mulgar say own language gnaw swallow 
14,"As for Ghibba, he feigned that his eyes were too weak and sore, and peered in vain beneath his bandages. ""Tell me what's to be seen, Mulla-mulgar,"" he said. ""Why do we linger? The frost's in my toes. Up with fresh torches and go forward.""",feign eye weak sore peer vain bandage tell see mulgar say linger frost toe fresh torche go 
15,"Thumb grunted, but made no answer. Then Ghibba drew softly back into the deeper shadow, and the rest of the Mulgars, who by now were all come up, stood whispering, some in perplexity, not knowing what to do; some itching and sniffing to go forward, and one or two for turning back. One Moona-mulgar, indeed, mewing like a cat in his extreme fear, when he had heard Thumb's sudden bark, had turned lean shanks and hairy arms and fled down by the way they had come. Fainter and fainter had grown the sounds of snapping twigs, until all again was silent.",thumb grunt make answer draw deep shadow rest come stand whisper perplexity know do itching sniff go turn mulgar mew cat extreme fear hear sudden bark turn lean shank hairy arm flead way come fainter grow sound snapp twig silent 
16,"""What wonder our father Seelem stumbled as he ran?"" muttered Nod to Thumb.",wonder father stumble run mutter 
17,"But Ghibba stood thinking, the skin of his forehead twitching up and down, as is the habit of nearly all Mulgars, high and low. ""This is our riddle, O Mulla-mulgars,"" he said: ""If we turn back and climb slowly upward, so as to creep round in hiding from these giant Meermuts, we shall only come at last to batter our heads against the walls of Mōōt. And Mōōt I know of old: there the Gunga-moonas make their huddles. And the other way, under the moon, there juts a precipice five thousand Mulgars deep, through which, so the old news goes, creeps slowlier than moss Tishnar's never-melting Obea of ice. Here, then, is our answer, Princes: The valleys must be yet many long days' journey. Either, then, we go straight forward beneath the feet of Tishnar's Orchard-meermuts, like forest-mice that gambol among a Mutti of Ephelantoes, or else, like shivering Jack-Alls, we go back, to live out the rest of this littlest of lives itching, but having nowhere to scratch. What thinks the Mulgar Eengenares?""",stand think skin forehead twitch habit high low riddle mulgar say turn climb creep hide giant come last batter head wall know old moona make huddle other way moon jut precipice mulgar deep old news go creep slowly melt ice answer valley many long day journey go foot meermut forest mouse gambol shiver go live rest littlest life itching have scratch think 
18,"And at that Nod remembered what the watchman had said, when they were talking together by the eagles' watch-fires. He touched Thumb, speaking softly in Mulgar-royal. ""Thumb, my brother, what of the Wonderstone? what of the Wonderstone? Shall we tell this Moona-mulgar of that?""",nod remember watchman say talk eagle watch fire touch speak royal thumb brother tell mulgar 
19,"Thumb laughed sulkily. ""Seelem kept all his wits for you, Jugguba,"" he answered; ""rub and see!""",thumb laugh keep wit answer rub see 
20,"So Nod spread open his pocket-flap and fetched out the Wonderstone, wrapped in its wisp of wool and the stained leaf of paper from Battle's little book. He held it out in his brown, hairless palm to Ghibba beneath the thorn. ""What think you of that, Mulla-moona?"" he said. And even Ghibba's dim eyes could discern its milk-pale shining. They talked long together in the shadow of the thorns, while the rest of the skinny travellers sat silent beside their bundles, coughing and blinking as they mumbled their mouldy cheese-rind.",spread open pocket flap fetched wrap wisp wool stain leaf paper little book hold brown hairless palm thorn think say dim eye discern milk pale shine talk shadow thorn rest skinny traveller sit silent bundle cough blink mumble mouldy cheese rind 
21,"Ghibba said that, as Nod was a Nizza-neela, they should venture out alone together. ""I am nothing but a skin of bones--nothing to pick,"" he said, ""and all but sand-blind, and therefore could not see to be afraid.""",say venture skin bone pick say sand blind see afraid 
22,"""No, no, no, Mulla-moona,"" Thumb grunted stubbornly. ""If mischief came to my brother, how could I live on, listening to the chittering of his mother's Meermut asking me, 'Where is Nod?' Stay here and guard my brother, Thimbulla, who is too sick and weak to go with us; and if we neither of us return before morning, deal kindly with him, Mulla-moona, and have our thanks till you too are come to be a shadow.""",grunt mischief come brother live listen chittering mother ask nod stay guard brother sick weak go return morning deal have thanks come shadow 
23,"So at last it was agreed between them. And Thumb and Nod returned together to the edge of the wood and peered out once more towards the phantom-guarded orchards. Nod waited no longer. He wetted his thumb once more, and rubbed thrice, droning or crooning, and stamping nimbly in the snow, till suddenly Thumb sprang back clean into the midst of a thorn-tree in his dismay.",last agree return edge wood peer phantom guard orchard wait wett thumb more rub thrice droning crooning stamp snow spring clean midst thorn tree dismay 
24,"""Ubbe nimba sul ugglourint!"" he cried hollowly. For the child stood there in the snow, shining as if his fur were on fire with silver light. About his head a wreath of moon-coloured buds like frost-flowers was set. His shoulders were hung with a robe like spider-silk falling behind him to his glistening heels. But it was Nod's shrill small laughter that came out of the shining.",cry child stand snow shine fur fire silver light head wreath moon coloured bud frost flower set shoulder hang robe spider silk fall glisten heel shrill small laughter come shine 
25,"""Follow, oh follow, brother,"" he said. ""I am Fulby, I am Oomgar's M'keeso; it is a dream; it is a night-shadow; it is Nod Meermut; it is fires of Tishnar. Hide in my blaze, Thumb Mulgar. And see these Noomas cringe!""",follow follow brother say dream night shadow fire hide blaze see cringe 
26,"Thumb grunted, beat once on his chest like a Gunga, and they stepped boldly out together, first Nod, then black Thumb, into the wide splendour of the waste. And the Men of the Mountains watched them from between the spiky branches, with eyes round as the Minimuls', and mouths ajar, showing in their hair their catlike teeth.",thumb grunt beat chest step first black wide splendour waste watch spiky branch eye mouth ajar show hair catlike tooth 
27,"Out into the open snow that borders for leagues the trees of Tishnar's orchard stepped Nod, with his Wonderstone. And, as he moved along, the frost-parched flakes burned with the rainbow. But if the phantoms of Mulgarmeerez were not blind, they were surely dumb. They made no sign that they perceived this blazing pigmy advancing against them. Nod's light heels fell so fast Thumb could scarcely keep pace with him. He came on grunting and coughing, plying his thick cudgel, his great dark eyes fixed stubbornly upon the snow. And lo and behold! when next Nod lifted his face he saw only moonlight shining upon the smooth trunks of trees, which in the higher branches were stooping with coloured fruit. He laughed aloud. ""See, Thumb,"" he said, ""my magic burns. M'keeso chatters. These Tishnar Meermuts are nought but trunks of trees!""",open snow border league tree orchard step move frost parched flake burn rainbow phantom blind dumb make sign perceive blaze pigmy advance light heel fall fast keep pace come grunt cough ply thick cudgel great dark eye fix snow behold next lift face see moonlight shine smooth trunk tree high branch stoop coloured fruit laugh see say magic burn chatter tishnar meermut nought trunk tree 
28,"But Thumb stared in more dismal terror still, for he saw plainly now their huge and shadowy clubs, their necklets of gold and ivory, and the hideous, purple-capped faces of the ghouls gloating down on him. ""Press on, Ummanodda; your eyes burn magic, and trees to you are sudden death to me."" His hair stood out in a grisly mantle around him, for sheer fear and horror of these gigantic faces as they passed. But Nod edged lightly through, like mantling swan or peacock, seeing only Tishnar's lovely orchards. No snow lay here in these enchanted glades, but the grass was powdered with pure white flowers that caught the flame of him in their beauty as he passed. The strange small voices the travellers had heard on the hillside seemed haunting the laden boughs of the orchard. But to Thumb all was darkness, and frozen snow, spiked thorn-trees, a-roost with evil birds, and the horror of the motionless phantoms behind him. He seemed ever and again to hear their stride between the twigs, and to feel a terrific thumb and finger closing over his matted scalp.",stare dismal terror see huge shadowy club necklet gold ivory hideous purple cap face ghoul gloat press eye burn magic tree sudden death hair stand grisly mantle sheer fear horror gigantic face pass edged mantle swan peacock see lovely orchard snow lay enchanted glade grass powder pure white flower catch flame beauty pass strange small voice traveller hear hillside seem haunting laden bough orchard darkness freeze snow spike thorn tree roost evil bird horror motionless phantom seem hear stride twig feel terrific thumb finger close matted scalp 
29,"In a little while the path the two Mulgars thridded led out from under the boughs, and they found themselves at the foot of the great peak they had all night been approaching. And Nod saw fountains springing in foam amid the flowery grasses, and all about them were trees laden with fruit, and the music of instruments and distant voices. But not on these near things was his mind set, but on the secret paths of Mulgarmeerez, winding down from the crested peak above.",little while path thridd lead bough find foot great peak night approach see fountain spring foam flowery grasse tree laden fruit music instrument distant voice near thing mind set secret path wind crested peak 
30,"""O brother, my brother! Tishnar is walking on the hills,"" he said. But Thumb, though he rubbed his eyes, could see nothing but the towering and desolate scaurs of ice and snow and a kind of snow-choked ridge girdling the abrupt mountain-side. But Nod came to a stand, half crouching, amazed, and watched, as it seemed to him, the Middens of Tishnar riding more beautiful than daybreak in the moonlight of her hills. And he heard a clear voice within him cry: ""Have no fear, Nizza-neela, Mulla-mulgar jugguba Ummanodda, neddipogo, Eengenares; feast and be merry. Tishnar watches over the brave."" And he told Thumb what the voice had said to him.",brother brother walk hill say rub eye see tower desolate scaur ice snow kind snow choke ridge girdle abrupt mountain side come stand half crouch amaze watch seem ride beautiful daybreak moonlight hill hear clear voice cry have fear feast merry watch brave tell voice say 
31,"And Thumb grew angry, for he was tired out of his courage. ""Have it as you will,"" he said. ""It is easy to fear nothing and to see what is not here when you meddle with magic, and shine like a fish out of water. But as for me, I go back to my brother Thimble, and to my friends, the Men of the Mountains."" And he stumped sullenly off, crouching low over his cudgel.",grow angry tired courage have say easy fear see meddle magic shine fish water go brother friend stump crouch low cudgel 
32,"Then Nod said softly: ""Wonderstone, Wonderstone! call back my brother and open his eyes."" Instantly Thumb stopped and stood upright. Thorn and snow, blain and ache and bruise, were gone. He saw the meadows alight with starry flowers, the fountains and the fruit. And he smelled the smoke of nard and soltziphal burning in the cressets of the servants of Tishnar. Nod laughed silently, and said: ""Bring, too, O Wonderstone, my brother Thimbulla on his litter, and the Prince Ghibba and his kinsfolk to feast with me.""",say call brother open eye stop stand thorn snow blain ache bruise gone see meadow alight starry flower fountain fruit smell smoke nard soltziphal burn cresset servant laugh say bring brother litter kinsfolk feast 
33,"For there, in the midst between the fountains, was a long low table spread with flowers and strange fruits and nuts, and lit with clear, pear-shaped flames floating in the air like that of the Wonderstone, but of the colours of ivory and emerald and amethyst; with nineteen platters of silver and nineteen goblets of gold. And presently they heard in the distance the grasshopper voices of the Hill-mulgars, as they came stubbling along with Thimble's litter in their midst, carrying their heavy faggots and bottles and bundles, their pink eyes blinking, their knees trembling, not knowing whether to be joyful or afraid.",midst fountain long low table spread flower strange fruit nut light clear pear shape flame float air colour ivory emerald amethyst plateer silver goblet gold hear distance grasshopper voice mulgar come stubble litter midst carry heavy faggot bottle bundle pink eye blink knee tremble know joyful afraid
