2," The children were sitting in the gloomy banqueting-hall, at the end of one of the long bare wooden tables. There was now no hope. Martha had brought in the dinner, and the dinner was invisible, and unfeelable too; for, when they rubbed their hands along the table, they knew but too well that for them there was nothing there _but_ table.",child sit gloomy banqueting hall end long bare wooden table be hope bring dinner dinner invisible unfeelable rub hand table know be table

16,"Cyril stood up with a grin of triumph, holding a square piece of bread in his mouth. It was quite real. Everyone saw it. It is true that, directly he bit a piece off, the rest vanished; but it was all right, because he knew he had it in his hand though he could neither see nor feel it. He took another bite from the air between his fingers, and it turned into bread as he bit. The next moment all the others were following his example, and opening and shutting their mouths an inch or so from the bare-looking table. Robert captured a slice of mutton, and--but I think I will draw a veil over the rest of this painful scene. It is enough to say that they all had enough mutton, and that when Martha came to change the plates she said she had never seen such a mess in all her born days.",stand grin triumph hold square piece bread mouth real see true bite piece rest vanish right know have hand see feel take bite air finger turn bread bite next moment other follow example open shut mouth inch bare look table capture slice mutton think draw veil rest painful scene enough say have enough mutton come change plate say see mess bear day 
17,"The pudding was, fortunately, a plain suet one, and in answer to Martha's questions the children all with one accord said that they would _not_ have molasses on it--nor jam, nor sugar--""Just plain, please,"" they said. Martha said, ""Well, I never--what next, I wonder!"" and went away.",pudding plain suet one answer question child accord say have molasses jam sugar plain say say wonder go

19,"The great thing, after all, was that they had had dinner; and now everyone felt more courage to prepare for the attack that was to be delivered before sunset. Robert, as captain, insisted on climbing to the top of one of the towers to reconnoitre, so up they all went. And now they could see all round the castle, and could see, too, that beyond the moat, on every side, tents of the besieging party were pitched. Rather uncomfortable shivers ran down the children's backs as they saw that all the men were very busy cleaning or sharpening their arms, re-stringing their bows, and polishing their shields. A large party came along the road, with horses dragging along the great trunk of a tree; and Cyril felt quite pale, because he knew this was for a battering-ram.",great thing have dinner feel more courage prepare attack deliver sunset captain insist climb top tower reconnoitre go see castle see moat side tent besieg party pitch uncomfortable shiver run child back see man busy clean sharpen arm re-string bow polish shield large party come road horse drag great trunk tree feel pale know battering ram

23,"""You see you don't know how long it's been besieged,"" said Cyril darkly; ""perhaps most of the brave defenders were killed early in the siege and all the provisions eaten, and now there are only a few intrepid survivors,--that's us, and we are going to defend it to the death.""",see know besiege say most brave defender kill siege provision eat be few intrepid survivor go defend death

28,But no one answered.,answer 
29,"The children found plenty of strange weapons in the castle, and if they were armed at all it was soon plain that they would be, as Cyril said, ""armed heavily""--for these swords and lances and crossbows were far too weighty even for Cyril's manly strength; and as for the longbows, none of the children could even begin to bend them. The daggers were better; but Jane hoped that the besiegers would not come close enough for daggers to be of any use.",child find plenty strange weapon castle armed plain say armed sword lance crossbow weighty manly strength longbow child begin bend dagger good hope besieger come dagger use 
30,"""Never mind, we can hurl them like javelins,"" said Cyril, ""or drop them on people's heads. I say--there are lots of stones on the other side of the courtyard. If we took some of those up? Just to drop on their heads if they were to try swimming the moat.""",mind hurl javelin say drop person head say be lot stone other side courtyard take drop head try swim moat

And I'll tell the others to fetch theirs.""",go say have biscuit tea go play besiege castle like biscuit provision garrison put pocket hand dirty tell other fetch

36,"The afternoon passed with wonderful quickness. It was very exciting; but none of them, except Robert, could feel all the time that this was real deadly dangerous work. To the others, who had only seen the camp and the besiegers from a distance, the whole thing seemed half a game of make-believe, and half a splendidly distinct and perfectly safe dream. But it was only now and then that Robert could feel this.",afternoon pass wonderful quickness exciting feel time real deadly dangerous work other see camp besieger distance whole thing seem game make believe distinct safe dream feel

Cyril insisted on putting by eight of the biscuits, in case anyone should feel faint in stress of battle.",seem tea time biscuit eat water deep courtyard drunk horn insist put biscuit case feel faint stress battle

50,"Jane consented to look, and the scene was almost too pretty to be alarming. The green turf, the white tents, the flash of pennoned lances, the gleam of armour, and the bright colours of scarf and tunic--it was just like a splendid coloured picture. The trumpets were sounding, and when the trumpeters stopped for breath the children could hear the cling-clang of armour and the murmur of voices.",consent look scene pretty alarming green turf white tent flash pennon lance gleam armour bright colour scarf tunic splendid coloured picture trumpet sound trumpeter stop breath child hear cling clang armour murmur voice

62,"""But they can't get into the castle even if they do swim over,"" said Robert. And as he spoke he heard feet on the stair outside--heavy feet and the clang of steel. No one breathed for a moment.

He pulled off his shoes.",get castle swim say speak hear foot stair heavy foot clang steel breathe moment steel foot go turret stair spring door pull shoe

The man was there--and it was Jakin, all dripping with moat-water, and he was fiddling about with the machinery which Robert felt sure worked the drawbridge. Robert banged the door suddenly, and turned the great key in the lock, just as Jakin sprang to the inside of the door.

64,"""We ought to have defended _this_!"" he cried to the others as they followed him. He was just in time. Another man had swum over, and his fingers were on the window-ledge. Robert never knew how the man had managed to climb up out of the water. But he saw the clinging fingers, and hit them as hard as he could with an iron bar that he caught up from the floor. The man fell with a splash into the moat-water.
