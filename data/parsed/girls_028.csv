1,CHAPTER 28. IN THE FAIRIES' FIELD.,fairies field 
2,"The moon had now come up brilliantly, and the little party were in the highest possible spirits.  They had got safely away from the house, and there was now, comparatively speaking, little fear of discovery.  The more timid ones, who ventured to confess that their hearts were in their mouths while Annie was unlocking the side door, now became the most excited, and perhaps the boldest, under the reaction, which set in. Even the wood, which was comparatively dark, with only patches of moonlight here and there, and queer weird shadows where the trees were thinnest, could not affect their spirits.",moon come little party high possible spirit get house be speak little fear discovery timid one venture confess heart mouth unlock side door become excited bold reaction set wood dark patch moonlight queer weird shadow tree thin affect spirit 
3,"The poor, sleepy rabbits must have been astonished that night at the shouts of the revellers, as they hurried past them, and the birds must have taken their sleepy heads from under their downy wings, and wondered if the morning had come some hours before its usual time.",poor sleepy rabbit astonished night shout reveller hurry bird take sleepy head downy wing wonder morning come hour usual time 
4,"More than one solemn old owl blinked at them, and hooted as they passed, and told them in owl language what silly, naughty young things they were, and how they would repent of this dissipation by-and-by.  But if the girls were to have an hour of remorse, it did not visit them then; their hearts were like feathers, and by the time they reached the fields where the fairies were supposed to play their spirits had become almost uncontrollable.",more solemn old owl blink hoot pass tell owl language silly naughty young thing repent dissipation girl have hour remorse visit heart feather time reach field fairy suppose play spirit become uncontrollable 
5,"Luckily for them this small green field lay in a secluded hollow, and more luckily for them no tramps were about to hear their merriment. Rover, who constituted himself Annie's protector, now lay down by her side, and as she was the real ringleader and queen of the occasion, she ordered her subjects about pretty sharply.",small green field lay secluded hollow tramp about hear merriment constitute protector lay side real ringleader queen occasion order subject 
6,"""Now, girls, quick; open the basket.  Yes, I'm going to rest.  I have organised the whole thing, and I'm fairly tired; so I'll just sit quietly here, and Rover will take care of me while you set things straight.  Ah! good Betty; she did not even forget the white table-cloth.""",girl quick open basket go rest organised whole thing tired sit take care set thing good forget white table cloth 
7,"Here one of the girls remarked casually that the grass was wet with dew, and that it was well they had all put on their waterproofs.",girl remark grass wet dew put waterproof 
8,Annie interrupted again in a petulant voice--,interrupt petulant voice 
9,"""Don't croak, Mary Morris.  Out with the chickens, lay the ham in this corner, and the cherries will make a picturesque pile in the middle. Twelve meringues in all, that means a meringue and a half each.  We shall have some difficulty in dividing.  Oh, dear! oh, dear! how hungry I am!  I was far too excited to eat anything at supper-time.""",croak chicken lay ham corner cherry make picturesque pile middle meringue mean meringue half have difficulty divide dear dear hungry excited eat supper time 
10,"""So was I,"" said Phyllis, coming up and pressing close to Annie.  ""I do think Miss Danesbury cuts the bread and butter too thick--don't you, Annie?  I could not eat mine at all, to-night, and Cecil Temple asked me if I was not well.""",say come press think cut bread butter thick eat night ask well 
11,"""Those who don't want chicken hold up their hands,"" here interrupted Annie, who had tossed her brown cap on the grass, and between whose brows a faint frown had passed for an instant at the mention of Cecil's name.",want chicken hold hand interrupt toss brown cap grass brow faint frown pass instant mention name 
12,"The feast now began in earnest, and silence reigned for a short time, broken only by the clatter of plates, and such an occasional remark as ""Pass the salt, please,"" ""Pepper this way, if you've no objection,"" ""How good chicken tastes in fairy-land,"" etc.  At last the ginger-beer bottles began to pop--the girl's first hunger was appeased.  Rover gladly crunched up all the bones, and conversation flowed once more, accompanied by the delicate diversion of taking alternate bites at meringues and cheesecakes.",feast begin earnest silence reign short time break clatter plate occasional remark pass salt pepper way have objection good chicken taste fairy land etc. last ginger beer bottle begin pop girl first hunger appease crunch bone conversation flow accompany delicate diversion take alternate bite meringue cheesecake 
13,"""I wish the fairies would come out,"" said Annie.",wish fairy come say 
14,"""Oh, don't!"" shivered Phyllis, looking round her nervously.",shiver look 
15,"""Annie, darling, do tell us a ghost story,"" cried several voices.",darling tell ghost story cry several voice 
16,"Annie laughed, and commenced a series of nonsense tales, all of a slightly eerie character, which she made up on the spot.",laugh commence series nonsense tale eerie character make spot 
17,"The moon riding high in the heavens looked down on the young giddy heads, and their laughter, naughty as they were, sounded sweet in the night air.",moon ride heaven look young giddy head laughter naughty sound sweet night air 
18,"Time flew quickly, and the girls suddenly discovered that they must pack up their table-cloth and remove all traces of the feast unless they wished the bright light of morning to discover them.  They rose hastily, sighing, and slightly depressed now that their fun was over.  The white table-cloth, no longer very white, was packed into the basket, the ginger-beer bottles placed on top of it, and the lid fastened down.  Not a crumb of the feast remained; Rover had demolished the bones, and the eight girls had made short work of everything else, with the exception of the cherry-stones, which Phyllis carefully collected and popped into a little hole in the ground.",time fly girl discover pack table cloth remove trace feast wish bright light morning discover rise sigh depressed fun white table cloth white pack basket ginger beer bottle place top lid fasten crumb feast remain demolish bone girl make short work else exception cherry stone collect pop little hole ground 
19,"The party then progressed slowly homewards, and once more entered the dark wood.  They were much more silent now; the wood was darker, and the chill which foretells the dawn was making itself felt in the air. Either the sense of cold, or a certain effect produced by Annie's ridiculous stories, made many of the little party unduly nervous.",party progress homeward enter dark wood silent wood dark chill foretell dawn make feel air sense cold certain effect produce ridiculous story make many little party nervous 
20,"They had only taken a few steps through the wood when Phyllis suddenly uttered a piercing shriek.  This shriek was echoed by Nora and by Mary Morris, and all their hearts seemed to leap into their mouths when they saw something move among the trees.  Rover uttered a growl, and, but for Annie's detaining hand, would have sprung forward.  The high-spirited girl was not to be easily daunted.",take few step wood utter pierce shriek shriek echoe heart seem leap mouth see move tree utter growl detaining hand spring high spirit girl daunt 
21,"""Behold, girls, the goblin of the woods,"" she exclaimed.  ""Quiet, Rover; stand still.""",girl goblin wood exclaim quiet stand 
22,"The next instant the fears of the little party reached their culmination when a tall, dark figure stood directly in their paths.",next instant fear little party reach culmination tall dark figure stand path 
23,"""If you don't let us pass at once,"" said Annie's voice, ""I'll set Rover at you.""",let pass say voice set 
24,"The dog began to bark loudly, and quivered from head to foot.",dog begin bark quiver head foot 
25,"The figure moved a little to one side, and a rather deep and slightly dramatic voice said--",figure move little side deep dramatic voice say 
26,"""I mean you no harm, young ladies; I'm only a gypsy-mother from the tents yonder.  You are welcome to get back to Lavender House.  I have then one course plain before me.""",mean harm young lady gypsy mother tent welcome get have course plain 
27,"""Come on, girls,"" said Annie, now considerably frightened, while Phyllis, and Nora, and one or two more began to sob.",come girl say frighten more begin sob 
28,"""Look here, young ladies,"" said the gypsy in a whining voice, ""I don't mean you no harm, my pretties, and it's no affair of mine telling the good ladies at Lavender House what I've seen.  You cross my hand, dears, each of you, with a bit of silver, and all I'll do is to tell your pretty fortunes, and mum is the word with the gypsy-mother as far as this night's prank is concerned.""",look young lady say gypsy whining voice mean harm pretty affair tell good lady see cross hand dear bit silver do tell pretty fortune mum word gypsy mother night prank concerned 
29,"""We had better do it, Annie--we had better do it,"" here sobbed Phyllis. ""If this was found out by Mrs Willis we might be expelled--we might, indeed; and that horrid woman is sure to tell of us--I know she is.""",have good do have good do sobb find expel horrid woman sure tell know 
30,"""Quite sure to tell, dear,"" said the tall gypsy, dropping a curtsey in a manner which looked frightfully sarcastic in the long shadows made by the trees.  ""Quite sure to tell, and to be expelled is the very least that could happen to such naughty little ladies.  Here's a nice little bit of clearing in the wood, and we'll all come over, and Mother Rachel will tell your fortunes in a twinkling, and no one will be the wiser. Sixpence apiece, my dears--only sixpence apiece.""",sure tell dear say tall gypsy drop curtsey manner look sarcastic long shadow make tree sure tell expel very least happen such naughty little lady nice little bit clear wood come tell fortune twinkling wise apiece dear apiece 
31,"""Oh, come; do, do come,"" said Nora, and the next moment they were all standing in a circle round Mother Rachel, who pocketed her black-mail eagerly, and repeated some gibberish over each little hand.  Over Annie's palm she lingered for a brief moment, and looked with her penetrating eyes into the girl's face.",come do come say next moment stand circle pocket black mail repeat gibberish little hand palm linger brief moment look penetrate eye girl face 
32,"""You'll have suffering before you, miss; some suspicion, and danger even to life itself.  But you'll triumph, my dear, you'll triumph.  You're a plucky one, and you'll do a brave deed.  There--good-night, young ladies; you have nothing more to fear from Mother Rachel.""",have suffer miss suspicion danger life triumph dear triumph plucky one do brave deed good night young lady have more fear 
33,"The tall dark figure disappeared into the blackest shadows of the wood, and the girls, now like so many frightened hares, flew home.  They deposited their basket where Betty would find it, under the shadow of the great laurel in the back avenue.  They all bade Rover an affectionate ""good-night.""  Annie softly unlocked the side door, and one by one, with their shoes in their hands, they regained their bedrooms. They were all very tired, and very cold, and a dull fear and sense of insecurity rested over each little heart.  Suppose Mother Rachel proved unfaithful, notwithstanding the sixpences?",tall dark figure disappear blackest shadow wood girl many frighten hare fly deposit basket find shadow great laurel back avenue bid affectionate good night unlock side door shoe hand regain bedroom tired cold dull fear sense insecurity rest little heart suppose prove unfaithful notwithstand sixpence
