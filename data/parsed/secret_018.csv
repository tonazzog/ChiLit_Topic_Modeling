2," Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning.  She slept late because she was tired, and when Martha brought her breakfast she told her that though.  Colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always was after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying.  Mary ate her breakfast slowly as she listened.",course wake next morning sleep tired bring breakfast tell quiet ill feverish wear fit cry eat breakfast listen 
3,"""He says he wishes tha' would please go and see him as soon as tha' can,"" Martha said.  ""It's queer what a fancy he's took to thee.  Tha' did give it him last night for sure--didn't tha? Nobody else would have dared to do it.  Eh! poor lad! He's been spoiled till salt won't save him.  Mother says as th' two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way--or always to have it.  She doesn't know which is th' worst.  Tha' was in a fine temper tha'self, too.  But he says to me when I went into his room, 'Please ask Miss Mary if she'll please come an' talk to me?' Think o' him saying please! Will you go, Miss?""

""I dreamed about it all night I heard you say something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves--and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still. I'll lie and think about it until you come back.""",cry dream night hear say gray change green dream stand place fill tremble little green leave be bird nest look soft lie think come 
10," In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden.  The fox and the crow were with him again and this time he had brought two tame squirrels.  ""I came over on the pony this mornin',"" he said.  ""Eh! he is a good little chap--Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets. This here one he's called Nut an' this here other one's called Shell.""",minute garden fox crow time bring tame squirrel come pony mornin say good little chap jump bring pocket one call other one call

12,"When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Soot solemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close to them, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness, but when she began to tell her story somehow the look in Dickon's funny face gradually changed her mind.  She could see he felt sorrier for Colin than she did.  He looked up at the sky and all about him.",sit grass curl foot listen tree nose close seem bearable leave such delightfulness begin tell story look funny face change mind see feel sorrier look sky 
13,"""Just listen to them birds--th' world seems full of 'em--all whistlin' an' pipin',"" he said.  ""Look at 'em dartin' about, an' hearken at 'em callin' to each other.  Come springtime seems like as if all th' world's callin'. The leaves is uncurlin' so you can see 'em--an', my word, th' nice smells there is about!"" sniffing with his happy turned-up nose.

14,When he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad Yorkshire though at other times he tried to modify his dialect so that Mary could better understand.  But she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact been trying to learn to speak it herself.  So she spoke a little now.,interested speak broad other time try modify dialect understand love broad fact try learn speak speak little 
15,"""Aye, that we mun,"" she said (which meant ""Yes, indeed, we must""). ""I'll tell thee what us'll do first,"" she proceeded, and Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused him very much.  ""He's took a graidely fancy to thee.  He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an' Captain.  When I go back to the house to talk to him I'll ax him if tha' canna' come an' see him tomorrow mornin'--an'.  bring tha' creatures wi' thee--an' then--in a bit, when there's more leaves out, an' happen a bud or two, we'll get him to come out an' tha' shall push him in his chair an' we'll bring him here an' show him everything.""",mun say mean tell do proceed grin little wench try twist tongue speak amuse take graidely fancy want see want see go house talk ax canna come see tomorrow mornin bring tha' creature bit be more leave happen bud get come tha push chair bring show

17,"""Tha' mun talk a bit o' Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,"" Dickon chuckled.  ""Tha'll make him laugh an' there's nowt as good for ill folk as laughin' is.

18,"""I'm going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,"" said Mary, chuckling herself.",go talk very day say chuckle 
19,"The garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands.  It was hard to go away and leave it all, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her dress and Shell had scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayed there looking at her with inquiring eyes.  But she went back to the house and when she sat down close to Colin's bed he began to sniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced way.",garden reach time day night seem magician pass draw loveliness earth bough wand hard go leave creep dress scramble trunk apple tree sit stay look inquire eye go house sit bed begin sniff experienced way 
20,"""You smell like flowers and--and fresh things,"" he cried out quite joyously.  ""What is it you smell of? It's cool and warm and sweet all at the same time.""",smell flower fresh thing cry smell cool warm sweet same time 
21,"""It's th' wind from th' moor,"" said Mary.  ""It comes o' sittin' on th' grass under a tree wi' Dickon an' wi' Captain an' Soot an' Nut an' Shell.  It's th' springtime an' out o' doors an' sunshine as smells so graidely.""",wind moor say come sittin grass tree wi' soot nut shell springtime door sunshine smell

23,"""What are you doing?"" he said.  ""I never heard you talk like that before.  How funny it sounds.""",do say hear talk funny sound 
24,"""I'm givin' thee a bit o' Yorkshire,"" answered Mary triumphantly.  ""I canna' talk as graidely as Dickon an' Martha can but tha' sees I can shape a bit.  Doesn't tha' understand a bit o' Yorkshire when tha' hears it? An' tha' a Yorkshire lad thysel' bred an' born! Eh! I wonder tha'rt not ashamed o' thy face.""",give bit answer talk see shape bit understand bit hear lad thysel breed bear wonder 'rt ashamed face 
25,And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed.,begin laugh laugh stop laugh room echoe open door come draw corridor stand listen amaze 
26,"""Well, upon my word!"" she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herself because there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished. ""Whoever heard th' like! Whoever on earth would ha' thought it!""",word say speak be hear astonished hear earth think 
27,There was so much to talk about.  It seemed as if Colin could never hear enough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony whose name was Jump.  Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to see Jump.  He was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose.  He was rather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle in his little legs had been made of steel springs.  He had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw Dickon and he had trotted up to him and put his head across his shoulder and then Dickon had talked into his ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts.  Dickon had made him give Mary his small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle.,be much talk seem hear pony name run wood see tiny little shaggy moor pony thick lock hang eye pretty face nuzzle velvet nose thin live moor grass tough wiry muscle little leg make steel spring lift head whinie moment see trotet put head shoulder talk ear talk odd little whinny puff snort make give small front hoof kiss cheek velvet muzzle 
28,"""Does he really understand everything Dickon says?"" Colin asked.",understand say ask 
29,"""It seems as if he does,"" answered Mary.  ""Dickon says anything will understand if you're friends with it for sure, but you have to be friends for sure.""",seem answer say understand friend sure have friend sure

34,"""Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,"" said Mary.  ""He said he'd warrant we'd both got the same nasty tempers.  I think you are like him too.

37,Colin put out his thin hand and touched her.,put thin hand touch

39,"""Well, it was rather funny to say it,"" she admitted frankly, ""because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have patches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but--but if an angel did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor--if there was a Yorkshire angel--I believe he'd understand the green things and know how to make them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon does and they'd know he was friends for sure.""",funny say admit nose turn have big mouth clothes have patch talk broad angel come live moor be angel believe understand green thing know make grow know talk wild creature know friend sure 
40,"""I shouldn't mind Dickon looking at me,"" said Colin; ""I want to see him.""",mind look say want see 
41,"""I'm glad you said that,"" answered Mary, ""because--because--""",glad say answer 
42,Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tell him.  Colin knew something new was coming.,come mind minute tell know new come 
43,"""Because what?"" he cried eagerly.",cry

49,"""Oh! Oh!"" Colin cried out in delight.",cry delight

51,"If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted ""Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!"" but he was weak and rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath.",strong healthy boy shout hooray weak hysterical eye grow big big gasp breath 
52,"""Oh! Mary!"" he cried out with a half sob.  ""Shall I see it? Shall I get into it? Shall I live to get into it?"" and he clutched her hands and dragged her toward him.",cry half sob see get live get clutch hand drag 
53,"""Of course you'll see it!"" snapped Mary indignantly.  ""Of course you'll live to get into it! Don't be silly!""",course see snap course live get silly 
54,"And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she brought him to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what she imagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, and Colin's aches and tiredness were forgotten and he was listening enraptured.",un hysterical natural childish bring sense begin laugh few minute sit stool tell imagine secret garden ache tiredness forget listen enrapture
