1,CHAPTER 8. THE LAST TERM.,chapter last term 
2," It was within a few days of the holidays, the term-end examinations, and, more important still, the issue of the College paper which Beetle edited. He had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of Stalky and McTurk and the extreme rigor of study law. Once installed, he discovered, as others have done before him, that his duty was to do the work while his friends criticized. Stalky christened it the “Swillingford Patriot,” in pious memory of Sponge--and McTurk compared the output unfavorably with Ruskin and De Quincey. Only the Head took an interest in the publication, and his methods were peculiar. He gave Beetle the run of his brown-bound, tobacco-scented library; prohibiting nothing, recommending nothing. There Beetle found a fat arm-chair, a silver inkstand, and unlimited pens and paper. There were scores and scores of ancient dramatists; there were Hakluyt, his voyages; French translations of Muscovite authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff; little tales of a heady and bewildering nature, interspersed with unusual songs--Peacock was that writer’s name; there was Borrow’s “Lavengro”; an odd theme, purporting to be a translation of something, called a “Ruba’iyat,” which the Head said was a poem not yet come to its own; there were hundreds of volumes of verse---Crashaw; Dryden; Alexander Smith; L. E. L.; Lydia Sigourney; Fletcher and a purple island; Donne; Marlowe’s “Faust “; and--this made McTurk (to whom Beetle conveyed it) sheer drunk for three days--Ossian; “The Earthly Paradise”; “Atalanta in Calydon”; and Rossetti--to name only a few. Then the Head, drifting in under pretense of playing censor to the paper, would read here a verse and here another of these poets, opening up avenues. And, slow breathing, with half-shut eyes above his cigar, would he speak of great men living, and journals, long dead, founded in their riotous youth; of years when all the planets were little new-lit stars trying to find their places in the uncaring void, and he, the Head, knew them as young men know one another. So the regular work went to the dogs, Beetle being full of other matters and meters, hoarded in secret and only told to McTurk of an afternoon, on the sands, walking high and disposedly round the wreck of the Armada galleons, shouting and declaiming against the long-ridged seas.",few day holiday term end examination important issue college paper edit cajole office blandishment extreme rigor study law install discover other do duty do work friend criticize christen pious memory compare output take interest publication method peculiar give run brown bound tobacco scent library prohibit recommend find fat arm chair silver inkstand unlimited pen paper be score score ancient dramatist be voyage french translation muscovite author call little tale heady bewildering nature intersperse unusual song writer name be odd theme purport translation call say poem come own be hundred volume verse purple island make convey sheer drunk day earthly name few drift pretense play censor paper read verse poet open avenue slow breathing half shut eye cigar speak great man live journal dead found riotous youth year planet little new light star try find place uncaring void know young man know regular work go dog full other matter meter hoard secret tell afternoon sand walk high wreck galleon shouting declaim long ridge sea

5,"He touched his neck proudly. It was encircled by the stiffest of stick-up collars, which custom decreed could be worn only by the Sixth. And the Sixth saw those collars and said no word. “Pussy,” Abanazar, or Dick Four of a year ago would have seen them discarded in five minutes or... But the Sixth of that term was made up mostly of young but brilliantly clever boys, pets of the house-masters, too anxious for their dignity to care to come to open odds with the resourceful three. So they crammed their caps at the extreme back of their heads, instead of a trifle over one eye as the Fifth should, and rejoiced in patent-leather boots on week-days, and marvellous made-up ties on Sundays--no man rebuking. McTurk was going up for Cooper’s Hill, and Stalky for Sandhurst, in the spring; and the Head had told them both that, unless they absolutely collapsed during the holidays, they were safe. As a trainer of colts, the Head seldom erred in an estimate of form.",touch neck encircle stiffest stick collar custom decree wear see collar say word year see discard minute sixth term make young clever boy pet house master anxious dignity care come open odd resourceful cramm cap extreme back head trifle eye fifth rejoice patent leather boot week day marvellous make tie man rebuke go spring tell collapse holiday safe trainer colt err estimate form
