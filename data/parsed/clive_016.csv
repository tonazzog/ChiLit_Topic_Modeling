1,CHAPTER 15. The Pirates' Hold.,hold 
2," Sivagi, the founder of the Mahratta Empire, had, in 1662, seized and fortified Yijiyadrug; or, as the English call it, Gheriah, a town at the mouth of the river Kanui, one hundred and seventy miles south of Bombay; and also the island of Suwarndrug, about half way between Gheriah and Bombay. Here he established a piratical fleet. Fifty years later, Kanhagi Angria, the commander of the Mahratta fleet, broke off this connection with the successors of Sivagi, and set up as a pirate on his own account. Kanhagi not only plundered the native vessels, but boldly preyed upon the commerce of the European settlements. The ships of the East India Company, the French Company, and the Dutch were frequently captured by these pirates.",founder seize fortify call town mouth river mile island half way establish piratical fleet year commander fleet break connection successor set pirate own account plunder native vessel prey commerce european settlement ship french capture pirate 
3,"Tulagi Angria, who succeeded his father, was even bolder and more successful; and when the man-of-war brig, the Restoration, with twenty guns and two hundred men, was fitted out to attack him, he defeated and captured her. After this, he attacked and captured the French man-of-war Jupitre, with forty guns; and had even the insolence to assail an English convoy guarded by two men-of-war; the Vigilant, of sixty-four guns, and the Ruby, of fifty.",succeed father bold successful man war brig gun man fit attack defeat capture attack capture french man war gun have insolence assail english convoy guard man war gun 
4,"The Dutch, in 1735, sent a fleet of seven ships of war, two bomb vessels, and a strong body of troops against Gheriah. The attack was, however, repulsed with considerable loss. From that date the pirates grew bolder and bolder, and were a perfect scourge to the commerce of Western India.",send fleet ship war bomb vessel strong body troops attack repulse considerable loss date pirate grow bold bold perfect scourge commerce western 
5,"Charlie Marryat had, of course, frequently heard of the doings of these noted pirates, and the cry of ""Tulagi Angria"" at once explained to him the terror of the master and crew.",course hear doing note pirate cry explain terror master crew 
6,"""What is it, Mr. Charles, what on earth is the botheration about? Is it the little ships they're afeared of?""",earth botheration little ship afear 
7,"""Those ships belong to a pirate called Tulagi Angria,"" Charlie said, ""and I am very much afraid, Tim, that we are likely to see the inside of his fortress.""",ship belong pirate call say afraid likely see inside fortress 
8,"""But shure, yer honor, we're not afeared of those four little boats.""",honor afeared little boat 
9,"""We are, Tim, and very much afraid, too. Each of those boats, as you call them, carries four or five times as many men as this ship. They are well armed, while we have only those two little guns, which are useless except for show. If the crew were Englishmen, we might attempt a defence, although even then the odds would be terribly against us; but with these natives, it is hopeless to think of it, and the attempt would only ensure our throats being cut.""",afraid boat call carry time many man ship armed have little gun useless show crew attempt defence odd native hopeless think attempt ensure throat cut 
10,"It was clear that the idea of resistance did never even enter the minds of the crew of the trader. Some ran to and fro, with gesticulations and cries of despair. Some threw themselves upon the deck of the vessel, tore their hair, and rolled as if in convulsions. Some sat down quietly, with the air of apathetic resignation, with which the natives of India are used to meet what they consider the inevitable.",clear idea resistance enter mind crew trader run for gesticulation cry despair throw deck vessel tore hair roll convulsion sit air apathetic resignation native use meet consider inevitable 
11,"Hossein, who, at the first alarm, had bounded to his feet with his hand on his knife, subsided into an attitude of indifference, when he saw that Charlie did not intend making any defence.",first alarm bound foot hand knife subside attitude indifference see intend make defence 
12,"""It's mighty lucky,"" Tim said, ""that yer honor left all your presents to be forwarded to Madras. I thought you were wrong, Mr. Charles, when you advised me to send them thousand rupees the rajah gave me, along with your money. A hundred pounds wasn't a sum that Tim Kelly was likely to handle again in a hurry, and it went agin the grain with me, to part with them out of my hands. Sure and it's well I took yer honor's advice.""",lucky say honor leave present forward think wrong advise send rupee give money pound sum likely handle hurry go grain part hand take honor advice 
13,"The four Sepoy officers also exchanged a few words with Charlie. They, too, would have resisted, had he given the word, hopeless though the effort would have been. But they acquiesced, at once, in his decision. They had little to lose; but the thought of a prolonged captivity, and of being obliged, perhaps, to enter the service of the Mahratta freebooters, just when about to return to their wives and families at Madras, was a terrible blow to them.",officer exchange few word resist give word hopeless effort acquiesce decision have little lose thought prolonged captivity oblige enter service freebooter return wife family terrible blow 
14,"""Keep up your spirits,"" Charlie said. ""It is a bad business, but we must hope for the best. If we bide our time, we may see some chance of escape. You had better lay down your arms in a pile, here. Then we will sit down quietly, and await their coming on board. They will be here in a minute, now.""",keep spirit say bad business hope good bide time see chance escape have good lay arm pile sit await come board minute 
15,"Scarcely had the seven passengers taken their seats in a group, on the poop, when the freebooters ranged alongside, and swarmed over the sides onto the deck. Beyond bestowing a few kicks upon the crew, they paid no attention whatever to them; but tore off the hatches, and at once proceeded to investigate the contents of the hold. The greater portion of this consisted of native grains, but there were several bales of merchandise, consigned by traders at Calicut for Ceylon. The cargo was, in fact, rather more valuable than that generally found in a native coaster, and the pirates were satisfied.",have passenger take seat group poop freebooter rang swarm side deck bestow few kick crew pay attention tore hatch proceed investigate content hold great portion consist native grain be several bale merchandise consign trader cargo fact valuable find native coaster pirate satisfy 
16,"The leader of the party, leaving to his followers the task of examining the hold, walked towards the group on the poop. They rose at his approach.",leader party leave follower task examine hold walk group poop rise approach 
17,"""Who are you?"" the Mahratta asked.",ask 
18,"""I am an officer in the English Company's service,"" Charlie said, ""as are these five natives. The other Englishman is a soldier, under my orders.""",officer english service say native other englishman soldier order

20,"After being stripped of any small valuables on their persons, the captives were taken on board one of the pirate boats. A score of the Mahrattas remained in charge of the trader. Her head was turned north, and, accompanied by the four Mahratta boats, she proceeded up the coast again. Another trader was captured on the way, but two others evaded the pirates, by running into the port of Calicut.",stripp small valuable person captive take board pirate boat score remain charge trader head turn accompany boat proceed coast trader capture way other evade pirate run port 
21,"The trader was a slow sailer, and they were eight days before they approached Gheriah. Early in the morning a heavy cannonade was heard in the distance, causing the greatest excitement among the Mahrattas. Every sail was hoisted, the sweeps got out and, leaving the trader to jog along in their rear, the four light craft made their way rapidly along the coast. The firing became heavier and heavier, and as it became light, three large ships could be seen, about two miles ahead, surrounded by a host of smaller craft.",trader slow sailer day approach morning heavy cannonade hear distance cause great excitement sail hoist sweep get leave trader jog rear light craft make way coast fire become heavy heavy become light large ship see mile surround host small craft 
22,"""That's a big fight, Mr. Charles,"" Tim exclaimed. ""It reminds me of three big bulls in a meadow, attacked by a host of little curs.""",big fight exclaim remind big bull meadow attack host little cur 
23,"""It does, Tim; but the curs can bite. What a fire they are keeping up. But those warships ought to thrash any number of them. Count the ports, I can see them now.""",cur bite fire keep warship thrash number count port see 
24,"""The biggest one,"" Tim said, ""has got twenty-five.""",big one say get

26,"""They're not English, yer honor,"" Tim said confidently, ""or they would soon make an end of them varmint that's tormenting them.""",english honor say make end varmint torment 
27,"The scene, as the boats approached, was very exciting. The three ships were pouring their broadsides, without intermission, into the pirate fleet. This consisted of vessels of all sizes, from the Jupitre and Restoration, down to large rowing galleys. Although many were sunk, and more greatly damaged by the fire of the Dutch, they swarmed round the great ships with wonderful tenacity; and, while the larger vessels fought their guns against those of the men-of-war, the smaller ones kept close to them, avoiding as much as possible their formidable broadsides, but keeping up a perpetual musketry fire at their bulwarks and tops, throwing stink pots, and shooting burning arrows through the ports; and getting alongside under the muzzles of the guns, and trying to climb up into the ports.",scene boat approach exciting ship pour broadside intermission pirate fleet consist vessel size large rowing galley many sink damage fire swarm great ship wonderful tenacity large vessel fight gun man war small one keep avoid much possible formidable broadside keep perpetual musketry fire bulwark top throw stink pot shoot burning arrow port get muzzle gun try climb port 
28,The four newly arrived craft joined in the fray.,arrive craft join fray 
29,"""This is mighty unpleasant, yer honor,"" Tim said, as a shot from one of the Dutch men-of-war struck the craft they were in, crashing a hole through her bulwarks, and laying five or six of her crew upon the deck, killed or wounded by the splinters. ""Here we are, in the middle of a fight in which we've no consarn whatever, and which is carried on without asking our will or pleasure; and we are as likely to be killed by a Christian shot, as these hathen niggers.",mighty unpleasant honor say shot dutch man war strike craft crash hole bulwark lay crew deck kill wound splinter middle fight have consarn carry ask will pleasure likely kill christian shot hathen nigger

31,"It was as Tim said. A cloud of black smoke was rising from the Dutch fifty-gun frigate. A wild yell of triumph broke from the Mahrattas. The fire of their guns upon her redoubled, while that from the man-of-war died away, as the crew were called off to assist in extinguishing the flames. Now the smaller boats pressed still more closely round her, and a rain of missiles was poured through the open ports. Several times the Mahrattas climbed on board, but each time were driven out again. The smoke rose thicker and thicker, and tongues of flame could be seen shooting up.",say cloud black smoke rise dutch gun frigate wild yell triumph break fire gun redoubl man war die crew call assist extinguish flame small boat press rain missile pour open port several time climb board time drive smoke rise thick thick tongue flame see shoot

33,"""Ah! The other frigate is on fire now.""",other frigate fire 
34,"Fresh yells of triumph rose from the Mahrattas. On board the sloop every sail was hoisted, in spite of the continued fire of muskets and arrows, which killed many of the sailors employed. The Jupitre, however, ran alongside her and grappled with her, and a furious combat could be seen proceeding on the decks. Meanwhile, the flames mounted higher and higher on board the two frigates. The crew now could be seen leaping overboard from the ports, choosing any death rather than that by fire.",fresh yell triumph rise board sloop sail hoist spite continue fire musket arrow kill many sailor employ run grapple furious combat see proceed deck flame mount high high board frigate crew see leap port choose death fire 
35,"It was but a choice. Many were drowned, the rest cut or shot down by the Mahrattas. Down came the Dutch flag, fluttering from the masthead of the sloop, and the wild Mahratta yell proclaimed that the victory was everywhere complete.",choice many drown rest cut shoot come dutch flag flutter masthead sloop wild yell proclaim victory complete 
36,"The frigates were now a sheet of flames, and the Mahratta craft drew away from them; until, with two tremendous explosions, their magazines blew up and they sank beneath the waters.",frigate sheet flame craft draw tremendous explosion magazine blow sink water 
37,"""I should scarcely have believed it possible,"" Charlie said, ""that three fine ships of war, mounting a hundred and four guns, could be destroyed by a fleet of pirates, however numerous. Well, Tim, there is no doubt that these natives can fight, when well led. It is just as well, you see, that we did not attempt to offer any resistance, in that clumsy craft we were on board.""",believe possible say fine ship war mount gun destroy fleet pirate numerous be doubt native fight lead see attempt offer resistance clumsy craft board 
38,"""You're right there, yer honor. They would have aten us up in five minutes. It makes my heart bleed, to think of the sailors of those two fine ships. I don't believe that a soul has escaped; but in the small one, some may have been taken prisoners.""",right honor aten minute make heart ble think sailor fine ship believe soul escape small one take prisoner 
39,"When the fight was over, the craft in which were the captives ran alongside the flagship of the pirate leader, and the captain reported to him the capture he had made. Fortunately, Tulagi Angria was in a high state of delight, at the victory he had just won; and, instead of ordering them to be instantly executed, he told the captain to take them on to Suwarndrug, and to imprison them there until his arrival. He himself, with the rest of his fleet, and the captured Dutch sloop, sailed into Gheriah; and the craft, in which Charlie and his companions were imprisoned, continued her course to the island stronghold of the pirates.",fight craft captive run flagship pirate leader captain report capture make high state delight victory win order execute tell captain take imprison arrival rest fleet capture dutch sloop sail craft companion imprison continue course island stronghold pirate 
40,"Suwarndrug was built on a rocky island. It lay within gunshot of the shore. Here, when Kanhagi Angria had first revolted from the authority of the Mahratta kingdom, the ruler of the Deccan had caused three strong forts to be built, in order to reduce the island fort. The pirates, however, had taken the initiative, and had captured these forts; as well as the whole line of seacoast, a hundred and twenty miles in length; and the country behind, twenty or thirty miles broad, extending to the foot of the mountains.",build rocky island lay gunshot shore revolt authority kingdom ruler cause strong fort build order reduce island fort pirate take initiative capture fort whole line seacoast mile length country mile broad extend foot mountain 
41,"On their arrival at Suwarndrug, the prisoners were handed over to the governor, and were imprisoned in one of the casemates of the fort. The next day, they were taken out and ordered to work; and, for weeks, they laboured at the fortifications, with which the pirates were strengthening their already naturally strong position. The labour was very severe, but it was a consolation to the captives that they were kept together.",arrival prisoner hand governor imprison casemate fort next day take order work week laboure fortification pirate strengthen strong position labour severe consolation captive keep 
42,"By Charlie's advice they exerted themselves to the utmost, and thus succeeded in pleasing their masters, and in escaping with but a small share of the blows, which were liberally distributed among other prisoners, native and European, employed upon the work. Charlie, indeed, was appointed as a sort of overseer; having under him not only his own party, but thirty others, of whom twenty were natives, and ten English sailors, who had been captured in a merchantman. Although closely watched, he was able to cheer these men, by giving them a hope that a chance of escape from their captivity might shortly arrive. All expressed their readiness to run any risk to regain their liberty.",advice exert utmost succeed pleasing master escape small share blow distribute other prisoner native european employ work appoint sort overseer have own party other native english sailor capture merchantman watch able cheer man give hope chance escape captivity arrive express readiness run risk regain liberty 
43,"From what he heard the pirates say, Charlie learned that they were expecting an attack from an expedition which was preparing at Bombay. The English sailors were confined in a casemate, adjoining that occupied by Charlie and his companions. The guard kept over them was but nominal, as it was considered impossible that they could escape from the island, off which lay a large fleet of the pirate vessels.",hear pirate say learn expect attack expedition prepare english sailor confine casemate adjoin occupy companion guard keep nominal consider impossible escape island lay large fleet pirate vessel 
44,"One morning upon starting to work they perceived, by the stir in the fortress, that something unusual was taking place; and presently, on reaching the rampart, they saw in the distance a small squadron approaching. They could make out that it consisted of a ship of forty-four guns, one of sixteen, and two bomb vessels, together with a fleet of native craft.",morning start work perceive stir fortress unusual take place reach rampart see distance small squadron approach make consist ship gun bomb vessel fleet native craft

55,"Seeing that the pirates were now mustering round their guns, and that the ships were ranging up for action, Charlie thought it prudent to retire. Hitherto no attention had been paid to them, but 'twas probable enough that, when the pirates' blood became heated by the fight, they would vent their fury upon their captives. He therefore advised not only the native officers, but the sailors, to retire to their casemates; which, as the guns placed in them did not command the position taken up by the ships, were at presented untenanted by any of the garrison.",see pirate muster gun ship range action think prudent retire attention pay probable pirate blood become heat fight vent fury captive advise native officer sailor retire casemate gun place command position take ship present untenanted garrison 
56,"Presently the noise of guns proclaimed that the engagement had begun. The boom of the cannon of the ships was answered by an incessant fire from the far more numerous artillery of the fortress, while now and then a heavy explosion, close at hand, told of the bursting of the bombs from the mortar vessels, in the fortress.",noise gun proclaim engagement begin boom cannon ship answer incessant fire numerous artillery fortress heavy explosion close hand tell burst bomb mortar vessel fortress

58,"""I am convinced,"" he said, ""that if unaided from within, the ships will have no chance whatever of taking this fortress; but I think that we may help them. The upper fort, which contains the magazine, commands the whole of the interior. But its guns do not bear upon the ships where they are anchored. Probably the place, at present, is almost deserted. As no one pays any attention to us, I propose, with Tim Kelly and the ten English sailors, to seize it. We can close the gate, and discharge the guns upon the defenders of the sea face. We could not, of course, defend it for five minutes if they attacked us; but we would threaten to blow up the magazine, if they did so.",convinced say unaid ship have chance take fortress think help upper fort contain magazine command whole interior gun bear ship anchore place present desert pay attention propose english sailor seize close gate discharge gun defender sea face course defend minute attack threaten blow magazine do

It would not do to use nails, even if we had them. No one will notice, in the dark, that you are not Mahrattas; and if you scatter about, you may each manage to close up four or five guns, at least. It is, I know, a desperate service, and if discovered you will be instantly killed. But if it succeeds the pirates, scared by discovering, just as our ships open fire, that a number of their guns are disabled; while we take them in the rear, from the fort behind, may not improbably surrender at once. At any rate, it's worth trying; and I, for one, would rather run the risk of being killed, than be condemned to pass my life the slave of these pirates, who may at any moment cut our throats, in case of any reverse happening to them.""",propose tomorrow morning strip loincloth become light go wall stop piece wood touch hole many cannon do use nail have notice dark scatter manage close gun least know desperate service discover kill succeed pirate scared discover ship open fire number gun disabled take rear fort surrender rate worth try run risk kill condemn pass life slave pirate moment cut throat case reverse happen 
60,"The four native officers at once stated their willingness to join in the plan. Hossein did not consider any reply necessary. With him, it was a matter of course to do whatever Charlie suggested.",native officer state willingness join plan consider reply necessary matter course do suggest 
61,"The latter then went into the next casemate, and unfolded his plan to the sailors, who heartily agreed to make an effort for their liberty.",latter go next casemate unfold plan sailor agree make effort liberty

63,"In the evening, the party cut a number of pieces of wood; these, measuring by the cannon in the casemate, they made of just sufficient size and length to push down, with a slight effort, through the touch hole. When pushed down to their full length, they touched the interior of the cannon below, and were just level with the top of the touch hole. Thus, it would be next to impossible to extricate them in a hurry. They might, indeed, be broken and forced in by a solid punch, of the same size as the touch hole; but this would take time, and would not be likely to occur, on the moment, to the pirates.",evening party cut number piece wood measure cannon casemate make sufficient size length push slight effort touch hole push full length touch interior can level top touch hole next impossible extricate hurry break force solid punch same size touch hole take time likely occur moment pirate

With these the work was accomplished.",skewer resemble strong tough make slip bamboo prisoner have knife use cut food work accomplish 
65,"Towards morning the five natives, with the skewers hidden away in their loincloths, and their turbans twisted in Mahratta fashion, stole out from the casemate.

66,"He himself, with Tim, joined the sailors; and, first ascending the ramparts and seeing that the ships were still at anchor, abreast of the fort, he and his comrades strolled across the interior of the fort, in the direction of the magazine. They did not keep together, nor did all move directly towards the position which they wished to gain.",join sailor ascend rampart see ship anchor abreast fort comrade stroll interior fort direction magazine keep move position wish gain 
67,"The place was already astir. Large numbers of the pirates thronged the interior. Groups were squatted round fires, busy in cooking their breakfasts. Numbers were coming from the magazine, with powder to fill up the small magazines on the walls. Others, again, were carrying shot from the pyramids of missiles, piled up here and there in the courtyard. None paid any attention to the English prisoners.",place astir large number pirate throng interior group squatet round fire busy cook breakfast number come magazine powder fill small magazine wall other carry shot pyramid missile pile courtyard pay attention english prisoner

69,"This was the signal for action. The pirates, in a moment, hurried down to the bastions overlooking the sea; and the Englishmen gathered, in a group, near the entrance to the magazine. Besides their knives they had no arms, but each had picked up two or three heavy stones.",signal action pirate moment hurry bastion overlook sea gather group entrance magazine knife have arm pick heavy stone

72,"Charlie gave the word, and with a rush they entered the upper fort. There were but two or three men there, who were just hurrying out with their bags of powder. These, before they realized the position, were instantly knocked down and bound. The gate of the fort was then shut and barred, and the party ran up to the bastion above.",give word rush enter upper fort be man hurry bag powder realize position knock bind gate fort shut barr party run bastion 
73,"Not a single pirate was to be seen there. The six guns, which stood there, were at once loaded with grape; and a heavy discharge was poured into the crowded masses of pirates, upon the bastions on the sea face. These, already greatly disturbed at finding that most of their guns had, in some way, been rendered useless; were panic stricken at this sudden and unexpected attack from the rear. Many of them broke from their guns and fled to shelter, others endeavoured to turn their cannon to bear upon the magazine.",single pirate see gun stand load grape heavy discharge pour crowded mass pirate bastion sea face disturb find most gun way render useless panic stricken sudden unexpected attack rear many break gun flead shelter other endeavour turn cannon bear magazine 
74,"The wildest confusion raged. At last some of their leaders rallied the men; and, with yells of fury, a rush was made towards the magazine. They were received with another discharge of grape, which took terrible effect. Many recoiled, but their leaders, shouting to them that the guns were discharged, and there were but a dozen men there, led them on again.",wild confusion rage last leader rally man yell fury rush make magazine receive discharge grape take terrible effect many recoil leader shouting gun discharge be man lead

77,"The boldest of the assailants were paralysed by the threat. Confusion reigned throughout the fortress. The fleet kept up their fire with great vigour; judging, by the feebleness of the reply, that something unusual must be happening within the walls. The gunners, disheartened by finding their pieces useless, and unable to extract the wooden plugs, while Charlie's men continued to ply them with grape, left their guns and, with the greater portion of the garrison, disorganized and panic stricken, retired into shelter.",bold assailant paralyse threat confusion reign fortress fleet keep fire great vigour judge feebleness reply unusual happen wall gunner dishearten find piece useless unable extract wooden plug man continue ply grape leave gun great portion garrison disorganized panic stricken retire shelter 
78,"A shell from the ships, falling on to a thatched building, set it on fire. The flames rapidly spread, and soon all the small huts occupied by the garrison were in flames. The explosion of a magazine added to the terror of the garrison, and the greater portion of them, with the women and children, ran down to the water; and, taking boats, attempted to cross to Fort Goa, on the mainland. They were, however, cut off by the English boats, and captured.",shell ship fall thatch building set fire flame spread small hut occupy garrison flame explosion magazine add terror garrison great portion woman child run water take boat attempt cross mainland cut english boat capture 
79,"Commodore James, who commanded the squadron, now directed his fire at Fort Goa; which was being feebly attacked, on the land side, by a Mahratta force; which had been landed from the Mahratta fleet, accompanying the English ships, a few miles down the coast. The fort shortly surrendered; but while the Mahrattas were marching to take possession, the governor, with some of his best men, took boat and crossed over to the island; of which, although the fire had ceased after the explosion of the magazine, the English had not taken possession.",command squadron direct fire attack land side force land fleet accompany english ship few mile coast surrender march take possession governor good man take boat cross island fire cease explosion magazine take possession 
80,"The fire from its guns again opened, and as Commodore James thought it probable that the pirates would, in the night, endeavour to throw in large reinforcements, he determined to carry it by storm. The ships opened fire upon the walls; and, under cover of this, half the seamen were landed. These ran up to the gate, and thundered at it with their axes.",fire gun open think probable pirate night endeavour throw large reinforcement determine carry storm ship open fire wall cover seamen land run gate thunder axe
