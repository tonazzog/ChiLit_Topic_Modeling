1,CHAPTER XV. NEST BUILDING,nest 
2," After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot.  Though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed herself very much.  The week had not seemed long.  She had spent hours of every day with Colin in his room, talking about Rajahs or gardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor.  They had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to Colin, and sometimes he had read a little to her.  When he was amused and interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.",week rain high arch blue sky appear sun pour hot be chance see secret garden enjoy week seem long spend hour day room talk garden cottage moor look splendid book picture read thing read little amuse interested think look invalid face colorless sofa 
3,"""You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you did that night,"" Mrs. Medlock said once. ""But there's no saying it's not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us.  He's not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends. The nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of him, but she says she doesn't mind staying now you've gone on duty with her,"" laughing a little.",sly young one listen get bed go follow thing do night say be saying sort blessing lot have tantrum whining fit make friend nurse go give case sick say mind stay go duty laugh little 
4,"In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret garden.  There were certain things she wanted to find out from him, but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct questions.  In the first place, as she began to like to be with him, she wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to.  He was not in the least like Dickon, but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted.  But she had not known him long enough to be sure.  The second thing she wanted to find out was this: If he could be trusted--if he really could--wouldn't it be possible to take him to the garden without having any one find it out? The grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret garden.  Perhaps if he had a great deal of fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he might not think so much about dying.  Mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from India.  This child looked nicer.  Even Martha had seen a change in her.",talk try cautious secret garden be certain thing want find feel find ask direct question first place begin like want discover kind boy tell secret least pleased idea garden know think trust know sure second thing want find trust possible take garden have one find grand doctor say have fresh air say mind fresh air secret garden have great deal fresh air know robin see thing grow think much die see glass realize look different creature child see arrive child look nice see change

10,"""I always hated it,"" he answered, ""even when I was very little.  Then when they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and then they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying I shouldn't live to grow up.

18,"""I'm sure you wouldn't mind him,"" said Mary.",sure mind say

22," On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very early.  The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window.  She drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her. The moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happened to it.  There were tender little fluting sounds here and there and everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert.  Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.",first morning sky blue waken sun pour slant ray blind be joyous sight jump bed run window draw blind open window great waft fresh scented air blow moor blue whole world look happen be tender little fluting sound score bird begin tune concert put hand window hold sun

24,"She kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could, breathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because she remembered what Dickon's mother had said about the end of his nose quivering like a rabbit's. ""It must be very early,"" she said.  ""The little clouds are all pink and I've never seen the sky look like this. No one is up.  I don't even hear the stable boys.""",kneel learn window breathe big breath sniff air laugh remember mother say end nose quivering rabbit early say little cloud pink see sky look hear stable boy

27,"She had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her clothes in five minutes.  She knew a small side door which she could unbolt herself and she flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on her shoes in the hall.  She unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she sprang across the step with one bound, and there she was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree. She clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it.  She ran around the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden.",learn dress time put clothes minute know small side door unbolt fly stock foot put shoe hall unchain unbolt unlock door open spring step bound stand grass seem turn green sun pour warm sweet waft fluting twittering singing come bush tree clasp hand pure joy look sky blue pink pearly white flood springtime light feel flute sing know thrushe robin skylark help run shrub path secret garden

This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.""",different say grass greener thing stick thing uncurling green bud leave show afternoon sure come 
29,"The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall.  There were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses.  Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seen how the world was waking up, but now she missed nothing.",long warm rain do strange thing herbaceous bed border walk low wall be thing sprout push root clump plant be glimpse royal purple yellow unfurl stem crocuse month see world wake miss 
30,"When she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy, she was startled by a curious loud sound.  It was the caw--caw of a crow and it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sat a big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wisely indeed.  She had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a little nervous, but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped away across the garden.  She hoped he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he would.  When she got fairly into the garden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a little reddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were watching the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the grass working hard.",reach place door hide ivy startle curious loud sound caw caw crow come top wall look sit big glossy plumaged blue black bird look see crow make little nervous next moment spread wing flapp garden hope go stay push door open wonder get garden see intend stay alight dwarf apple tree apple tree lie little reddish animal bushy tail watch stooping body rust red head kneel grass work

They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many wonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low.  He showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead.  He showed her ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould. They put their eager young noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary's hair was as tumbled as Dickon's and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his.",say kiss mother time way come moor day roamin stand door sun glad comfortable run part garden find many wonder oblige remind whisper speak low show swell leafbud rose branch seem dead show new green point push mould put eager young nose close earth sniff warm springtime breathing dig pull laugh rapture hair tumble cheek poppy red 
45,"There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because it was more wonderful.  Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of red-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak.  Dickon stood quite still and put his hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church.",be joy earth secret garden morning midst come delight delightful wonderful fly wall dart tree close grow corner little flare red breast bird hang beak stand put hand find laugh church

But he had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the world, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she watched him for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves.
