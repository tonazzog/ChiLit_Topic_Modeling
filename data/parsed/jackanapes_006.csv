4," Jackanapes' death was sad news for the Goose Green, a sorrow justly qualified by honorable pride in his gallantry and devotion. Only the Cobbler dissented, but that was his way. He said he saw nothing in it but foolhardiness and vain-glory. They might both have been killed, as easy as not, and then where would ye have been? A man's life was a man's life, and one life was as good as another. No one would catch him throwing his away. And, for that matter, Mrs. Johnson could spare a child a great deal better than Miss Jessamine.",death sad news sorrow qualify honorable pride gallantry devotion dissent way say see foolhardiness vain glory kill easy man life man life life good catch throw matter spare child great deal good 
5,"But the parson preached Jackanapes' funeral sermon on the text, ""Whosoever will save his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it;"" and all the village went and wept to hear him.",parson preach funeral sermon text save life lose lose life sake find village go goot hear 
6,"Nor did Miss Jessamine see her loss from the Cobbler's point of view. On the contrary, Mrs. Johnson said she never to her dying day should forget how, when she went to condole with her, the old lady came forward, with gentle-womanly self-control, and kissed her, and thanked GOD that her dear nephew's effort had been blessed with success, and that this sad war had made no gap in her friend's large and happy home circle.",see loss point view contrary say die day forget go condole old lady come gentle womanly self control kiss thank dear nephew effort bless success sad war make gap friend large happy home circle 
7,"""But she's a noble, unselfish woman,"" sobbed Mrs. Johnson, ""and she taught Jackanapes to be the same, and that's how it is that my Tony has been spared to me. And it must be sheer goodness in Miss Jessamine, for what can she know of a mother's feelings? And I'm sure most people seem to think that if you've a large family you don't know one from another any more than they do, and that a lot of children are like a lot of store-apples, if one's taken it won't be missed.""",noble unselfish woman sobb teach same spare sheer goodness know mother feeling sure most person seem think have large family know more do lot child lot store apple take miss

9,"The Ex-postman walks beside him, which Lollo tolerates to the level of his shoulder. If the Postman advances any nearer to his head, Lollo quickens his pace, and were the Postman to persist in the injudicious attempt, there is, as Miss Jessamine says, no knowing what might happen.",walk tolerate level shoulder advance head quicken pace persist injudicious attempt be say know happen 
10,"In the opinion of the Goose Green, Miss Jessamine has borne her troubles ""wonderfully."" Indeed, to-day, some of the less delicate and less intimate of those who see everything from the upper windows, say (well behind her back) that ""the old lady seems quite lively with her military beaux again.""",opinion borne trouble day delicate intimate see upper window say back old lady seem lively military beaux 
11,"The meaning of this is, that Captain Johnson is leaning over one side of her chair, whilst by the other bends a brother officer who is staying with him, and who has manifested an extraordinary interest in Lollo. He bends lower and lower, and Miss Jessamine calls to the Postman to request Lollo to be kind enough to stop, whilst she is fumbling for something which always hangs by her side, and has got entangled with her spectacles.",meaning lean side chair other bend brother officer stay manifest extraordinary interest bend low low call request kind stop fumble hang side get entangle spectacle 
12,"It is a two-penny trumpet, bought years ago in the village fair, and over it she and Captain Johnson tell, as best they can, between them, the story of Jackanapes' ride across the Goose Green; and how he won Lollo--the Gipsy's Lollo--the racer Lollo--dear Lollo--faithful Lollo--Lollo the never vanquished--Lollo the tender servant of his old mistress. And Lollo's ears twitch at every mention of his name.",penny trumpet buy year village fair tell good story ride win racer dear faithful vanquish tender servant old mistress ear twitch mention name 
13,"Their hearer does not speak, but he never moves his eyes from the trumpet, and when the tale is told, he lifts Miss Jessamine's hand and presses his heavy black moustache in silence to her trembling fingers.",hearer speak move eye trumpet tale tell lift hand press heavy black moustache silence tremble finger 
14,"The sun, setting gently to his rest, embroiders the sombre foliage of the oak-tree with threads of gold. The Grey Goose is sensible of an atmosphere of repose, and puts up one leg for the night. The grass glows with a more vivid green, and, in answer to a ringing call from Tony, his sisters, fluttering over the daisies in pale-hued muslins, come out of their ever-open door, like pretty pigeons form a dovecote.",sun set rest embroider sombre foliage oak tree thread gold sensible atmosphere repose put leg night grass glow vivid green answer ringing call sister flutter daisy pale hued muslin come open door pretty pigeon form dovecote

21,"There is a heritage of heroic example and noble obligation, not reckoned in the Wealth of Nations, but essential to a nation's life; the contempt of which, in any people, may, not slowly, mean even its commercial fall.

22,"But there be things--oh, sons of what has deserved the name of Great Britain, forget it not!--""the good of"" which and ""the use of"" which are beyond all calculation of worldly goods and earthly uses; things such as Love, and Honor, and the Soul of Man, which cannot be bought with a price, and which do not die with death.
