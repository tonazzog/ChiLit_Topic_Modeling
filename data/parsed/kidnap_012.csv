1,CHAPTER XI. THE CAPTAIN KNUCKLES UNDER,
2,"Alan and I sat down to breakfast about six of the clock. The floor was covered with broken glass and in a horrid mess of blood, which took away my hunger. In all other ways we were in a situation not only agreeable but merry; having ousted the officers from their own cabin, and having at command all the drink in the ship--both wine and spirits--and all the dainty part of what was eatable, such as the pickles and the fine sort of bread. This, of itself, was enough to set us in good humour, but the richest part of it was this, that the two thirstiest men that ever came out of Scotland (Mr. Shuan being dead) were now shut in the fore-part of the ship and condemned to what they hated most--cold water.",sit breakfast clock floor cover break glass horrid mess blood take hunger other way situation agreeable merry oust officer own cabin have command drink ship wine spirit dainty part eatable such pickle fine sort bread enough set good humour rich part thirstiest man come dead shut fore part ship condemn hate most cold water 
3,"“And depend upon it,” Alan said, “we shall hear more of them ere long. Ye may keep a man from the fighting, but never from his bottle.”",depend say hear more keep man fighting bottle 
4,"We made good company for each other. Alan, indeed, expressed himself most lovingly; and taking a knife from the table, cut me off one of the silver buttons from his coat.",make good company other express take knife table cut silver button coat 
5,"“I had them,” says he, “from my father, Duncan Stewart; and now give ye one of them to be a keepsake for last night’s work. And wherever ye go and show that button, the friends of Alan Breck will come around you.”",have say father give keepsake last night work go show button friend come 
6,"He said this as if he had been Charlemagne, and commanded armies; and indeed, much as I admired his courage, I was always in danger of smiling at his vanity: in danger, I say, for had I not kept my countenance, I would be afraid to think what a quarrel might have followed.",say command army much admire courage danger smile vanity danger say keep countenance afraid think quarrel follow 
7,"As soon as we were through with our meal he rummaged in the captain’s locker till he found a clothes-brush; and then taking off his coat, began to visit his suit and brush away the stains, with such care and labour as I supposed to have been only usual with women. To be sure, he had no other; and, besides (as he said), it belonged to a king and so behoved to be royally looked after.",meal rummage captain locker find clothes brush take coat begin visit suit brush stain such care labour suppose usual woman sure have other say belong king behove look 
8,"For all that, when I saw what care he took to pluck out the threads where the button had been cut away, I put a higher value on his gift.",see care take pluck thread button cut put high value gift 
9,"He was still so engaged when we were hailed by Mr. Riach from the deck, asking for a parley; and I, climbing through the skylight and sitting on the edge of it, pistol in hand and with a bold front, though inwardly in fear of broken glass, hailed him back again and bade him speak out. He came to the edge of the round-house, and stood on a coil of rope, so that his chin was on a level with the roof; and we looked at each other awhile in silence. Mr. Riach, as I do not think he had been very forward in the battle, so he had got off with nothing worse than a blow upon the cheek: but he looked out of heart and very weary, having been all night afoot, either standing watch or doctoring the wounded.",engage hail deck ask parley climb skylight sit edge pistol hand bold front fear break glass hail bid speak come edge round house stand coil rope chin level roof look other silence think battle get bad blow cheek look heart weary night afoot stand watch doctor wound 
10,"“This is a bad job,” said he at last, shaking his head.",bad job say last shake head 
11,"“It was none of our choosing,” said I.",choose say 
12,"“The captain,” says he, “would like to speak with your friend. They might speak at the window.”",captain say like speak friend speak window 
13,“And how do we know what treachery he means?” cried I.,know treachery mean cry 
14,"“He means none, David,” returned Mr. Riach, “and if he did, I’ll tell ye the honest truth, we couldnae get the men to follow.”",mean return tell honest truth get man follow 
15,“Is that so?” said I.,say 
16,"“I’ll tell ye more than that,” said he. “It’s not only the men; it’s me. I’m frich’ened, Davie.” And he smiled across at me. “No,” he continued, “what we want is to be shut of him.”",tell more say man frich’ened smile continue want shut 
17,"Thereupon I consulted with Alan, and the parley was agreed to and parole given upon either side; but this was not the whole of Mr. Riach’s business, and he now begged me for a dram with such instancy and such reminders of his former kindness, that at last I handed him a pannikin with about a gill of brandy. He drank a part, and then carried the rest down upon the deck, to share it (I suppose) with his superior.",consult parley agree parole give side whole business begg dram such instancy such reminder former kindness last hand pannikin gill brandy drink part carry rest deck share suppose superior 
18,"A little after, the captain came (as was agreed) to one of the windows, and stood there in the rain, with his arm in a sling, and looking stern and pale, and so old that my heart smote me for having fired upon him.",little captain come agree window stand rain arm sling look stern pale old heart smeat fire 
19,Alan at once held a pistol in his face.,hold pistol face 
20,"“Put that thing up!” said the captain. “Have I not passed my word, sir? or do ye seek to affront me?”",put thing say captain pass word sir seek affront 
21,"“Captain,” says Alan, “I doubt your word is a breakable. Last night ye haggled and argle-bargled like an apple-wife; and then passed me your word, and gave me your hand to back it; and ye ken very well what was the upshot. Be damned to your word!” says he.",say doubt word breakable last night haggle argle bargle apple wife pass word give hand back ke upshot damned word say 
22,"“Well, well, sir,” said the captain, “ye’ll get little good by swearing.” (And truly that was a fault of which the captain was quite free.) “But we have other things to speak,” he continued, bitterly. “Ye’ve made a sore hash of my brig; I haven’t hands enough left to work her; and my first officer (whom I could ill spare) has got your sword throughout his vitals, and passed without speech. There is nothing left me, sir, but to put back into the port of Glasgow after hands; and there (by your leave) ye will find them that are better able to talk to you.”",sir say captain get little good swear fault captain free have other thing speak continue make sore hash brig hand leave work first officer spare get sword vital pass speech be leave sir put port hand leave find able talk 
23,"“Ay?” said Alan; “and faith, I’ll have a talk with them mysel’! Unless there’s naebody speaks English in that town, I have a bonny tale for them. Fifteen tarry sailors upon the one side, and a man and a halfling boy upon the other! O, man, it’s peetiful!”",say faith have talk mysel be naebody speak town have bonny tale tarry sailor side man halfling boy other peetiful

25,"“No,” continued Alan, “that’ll no do. Ye’ll just have to set me ashore as we agreed.”",continue do have set agree 
26,"“Ay,” said Hoseason, “but my first officer is dead--ye ken best how. There’s none of the rest of us acquaint with this coast, sir; and it’s one very dangerous to ships.”",say first officer dead ke good be rest acquaint coast sir dangerous ship 
27,"“I give ye your choice,” says Alan. “Set me on dry ground in Appin, or Ardgour, or in Morven, or Arisaig, or Morar; or, in brief, where ye please, within thirty miles of my own country; except in a country of the Campbells. That’s a broad target. If ye miss that, ye must be as feckless at the sailoring as I have found ye at the fighting. Why, my poor country people in their bit cobles* pass from island to island in all weathers, ay, and by night too, for the matter of that.”",give choice say set dry ground brief mile own country country broad target miss feckless sailoring find fighting poor country person bit coble pass island island weather night matter

29,"“A coble’s not a ship, sir,” said the captain. “It has nae draught of water.”",ship sir say captain have nae draught water 
30,"“Well, then, to Glasgow if ye list!” says Alan. “We’ll have the laugh of ye at the least.”",list say have laugh least 
31,"“My mind runs little upon laughing,” said the captain. “But all this will cost money, sir.”",mind run little laugh say captain cost money sir 
32,"“Well, sir,” says Alan, “I am nae weathercock. Thirty guineas, if ye land me on the sea-side; and sixty, if ye put me in the Linnhe Loch.”",sir say weathercock guinea land sea side put 
33,"“But see, sir, where we lie, we are but a few hours’ sail from Ardnamurchan,” said Hoseason. “Give me sixty, and I’ll set ye there.”",see sir lie few hour sail say give set 
34,"“And I’m to wear my brogues and run jeopardy of the red-coats to please you?” cries Alan. “No, sir; if ye want sixty guineas earn them, and set me in my own country.”",wear brogue run jeopardy red coat please cry sir want guinea earn set own country 
35,"“It’s to risk the brig, sir,” said the captain, “and your own lives along with her.”",risk brig sir say captain own life 
36,"“Take it or want it,” says Alan.",take want say 
37,"“Could ye pilot us at all?” asked the captain, who was frowning to himself.",pilot ask captain frown 
38,"“Well, it’s doubtful,” said Alan. “I’m more of a fighting man (as ye have seen for yoursel’) than a sailor-man. But I have been often enough picked up and set down upon this coast, and should ken something of the lie of it.”",doubtful say more fighting man see yoursel sailor man pick set coast ke lie 
39,"The captain shook his head, still frowning.",captain shake head frown 
40,"“If I had lost less money on this unchancy cruise,” says he, “I would see you in a rope’s end before I risked my brig, sir. But be it as ye will. As soon as I get a slant of wind (and there’s some coming, or I’m the more mistaken) I’ll put it in hand. But there’s one thing more. We may meet in with a king’s ship and she may lay us aboard, sir, with no blame of mine: they keep the cruisers thick upon this coast, ye ken who for. Now, sir, if that was to befall, ye might leave the money.”",lose less money unchancy cruise say see rope end risk brig sir get slant wind be come mistaken put hand be thing more meet king ship lay sir blame keep cruiser thick coast sir befall leave money 
41,"“Captain,” says Alan, “if ye see a pennant, it shall be your part to run away. And now, as I hear you’re a little short of brandy in the fore-part, I’ll offer ye a change: a bottle of brandy against two buckets of water.”",say see pennant part run hear little short brandy fore part offer change bottle brandy bucket water 
42,"That was the last clause of the treaty, and was duly executed on both sides; so that Alan and I could at last wash out the round-house and be quit of the memorials of those whom we had slain, and the captain and Mr. Riach could be happy again in their own way, the name of which was drink.",last clause treaty execute side wash round house quit memorial slain captain happy own way name drink
