1,CHAPTER 1. “IN AMBUSH.”,ambush 
2," In summer all right-minded boys built huts in the furze-hill behind the College--little lairs whittled out of the heart of the prickly bushes, full of stumps, odd root-ends, and spikes, but, since they were strictly forbidden, palaces of delight. And for the fifth summer in succession, Stalky, McTurk, and Beetle (this was before they reached the dignity of a study) had built like beavers a place of retreat and meditation, where they smoked.",summer right minded boy build hut furze hill little lair whitlle heart prickly bush full stump odd root end spike forbidden palace delight fifth summer succession reach dignity study build beaver place retreat meditation smoke 
3,"Now, there was nothing in their characters as known to Mr. Prout, their house-master, at all commanding respect; nor did Foxy, the subtle red-haired school Sergeant, trust them. His business was to wear tennis-shoes, carry binoculars, and swoop hawklike upon evil boys. Had he taken the field alone, that hut would have been raided, for Foxy knew the manners of his quarry; but Providence moved Mr. Prout, whose school-name, derived from the size of his feet, was Hoofer, to investigate on his own account; and it was the cautious Stalky who found the track of his pugs on the very floor of their lair one peaceful afternoon when Stalky would fain have forgotten Prout and his works in a volume of Surtees and a new briar-wood pipe. Crusoe, at sight of the footprint, did not act more swiftly than Stalky. He removed the pipes, swept up all loose match-ends, and departed to warn Beetle and McTurk.",be character know house master commanding respect subtle red haired school trust business wear tennis shoe carry binocular swoop hawklike evil boy take field hut raid know manners quarry move school name derive size foot investigate own account cautious find track pug very floor lair peaceful afternoon forget work volume new briar wood pipe sight footprint act remove pipe sweep loose match end depart warn 
4,"But it was characteristic of the boy that he did not approach his allies till he had met and conferred with little Hartopp, President of the Natural History Society, an institution which Stalky held in contempt, Hartopp was more than surprised when the boy meekly, as he knew how, begged to propose himself, Beetle, and McTurk as candidates; confessed to a long-smothered interest in first-flowerings, early butterflies, and new arrivals, and volunteered, if Mr. Hartopp saw fit, to enter on the new life at once. Being a master, Hartopp was suspicious; but he was also an enthusiast, and his gentle little soul had been galled by chance-heard remarks from the three, and specially Beetle. So he was gracious to that repentant sinner, and entered the three names in his book.",characteristic boy approach ally meet confer little natural institution hold contempt more surprise boy know begg propose candidate confess long smother interest first flowering early butterfly new arrival volunteer see fit enter new life master suspicious enthusiast gentle little soul gall chance hear remark gracious repentant sinner enter name book 
5,"Then, and not till then, did Stalky seek Beetle and McTurk in their house form-room. They were stowing away books for a quiet afternoon in the furze, which they called the “wuzzy.”",seek house form room stow book quiet afternoon furze call wuzzy 
6,"“All up,” said Stalky, serenely. “I spotted Heffy’s fairy feet round our hut after dinner. ‘Blessing they’re so big.”",say spot fairy foot hut dinner blessing big 
7,“Con-found! Did you hide our pipes?” said Beetle.,find hide pipe say

9,"“‘Bother! Likewise blow!’” said McTurk thoughtfully, unpacking the volumes with which his chest was cased. The boys carried their libraries between their belt and their collar. “Nice job! This means we’re under suspicion for the rest of the term.”",bother blow say unpack volume chest case boy carry library belt collar nice job mean suspicion rest term

13,"“You’re a despondin’ brute, Beetle. Sometimes I think I shall have to drop you altogether. Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky forget you yet? _His rebus infectis_--after I’d seen Heffy’s man-tracks marchin’ round our hut, I found little Hartopp--_destricto ense_--wavin’ a butterfly-net. I conciliated Hartopp. ‘Told him that you’d read papers to the Bug-hunters if he’d let you join, Beetle. ‘Told him you liked butterflies, Turkey.

14,“What’s the good of that?” said Beetle.,good say 
15,"“Oh, Turkey, kick him!”",kick

They could wander, if they kept clear of all houses, practically where they chose; Mr. Hartopp holding himself responsible for their good conduct.",interest science bound relaxed member natural wander keep clear house choose hold responsible good conduct

22,"“This way,” said Stalky, turning to some fags’ lockers behind him. “Fags are dabs at Natural History. Here’s young Braybrooke’s botany-case.” He flung out a tangle of decayed roots and adjusted the slide. “‘Gives one no end of a professional air, I think. Here’s Clay Minor’s geological hammer. Beetle can carry that. Turkey, you’d better covet a butterfly-net from somewhere.”",way say turn fag locker fag dab natural young botany case flung tangle decay root adjust slide give end professional air think geological hammer beetle carry covet butterfly net

28,"They all sweated; for Stalky led them at a smart trot west away along the cliffs under the furze-hills, crossing combe after gorzy combe. They took no heed to flying rabbits or fluttering fritillaries, and all that Turkey said of geology was utterly unquotable.",sweat lead smart trot cliff furze hill cross combe gorzy combe take heed fly rabbit flutter fritillary say geology unquotable 
29,"“Are we going to Clovelly?” he puffed at last, and they flung themselves down on the short, springy turf between the drone of the sea below and the light summer wind among the inland trees. They were looking into a combe half full of old, high furze in gay bloom that ran up to a fringe of brambles and a dense wood of mixed timber and hollies. It was as though one-half the combe were filled with golden fire to the cliff’s edge. The side nearest to them was open grass, and fairly bristled with notice-boards.",go puff last flung short springy turf drone sea light summer wind inland tree look combe half full old high furze gay bloom run fringe bramble dense wood mix timber holly combe fill golden fire cliff edge side near open grass bristle notice board 
30,"“Fee-rocious old cove, this,” said Stalky, reading the nearest. “‘_Prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law_. G. M. Dabney, Col., J.P.,’ an’ all the rest of it. ‘Don’t seem to me that any chap in his senses would trespass here, does it?”",fee rocious old cove say read near prosecute utmost rigour law_ rest seem chap sense trespass

33,"Beetle disconnected the ring, thrust the net into a pocket, shut up the handle to a two-foot stave, and slid the cane-ring round his waist. Stalky led inland to the wood, which was, perhaps, a quarter of a mile from the sea, and reached the fringe of the brambles.",disconnect ring thrust net pocket shut handle foot stave slide cane ring waist lead wood quarter mile sea reach fringe bramble

35,"On all fours, save when he clung to his spectacles, Beetle wormed into the gorse, and presently announced between grunts of pain that he had found a very fair fox-track. This was well for Beetle, since Stalky pinched him _a tergo_. Down that tunnel they crawled. It was evidently a highway for the inhabitants of the combe; and, to their inexpressible joy, ended, at the very edge of the cliff, in a few square feet of dry turf walled and roofed with impenetrable gorse.",four save cling spectacle worm gorse announce grunt pain find fair fox track pinch tunnel crawl highway inhabitant combe inexpressible joy end very edge cliff few square foot dry turf wall roof impenetrable gorse

37,"He parted the tough stems before him, and it was as a window opened on a far view of Lundy, and the deep sea sluggishly nosing the pebbles a couple of hundred feet below. They could hear young jackdaws squawking on the ledges, the hiss and jabber of a nest of hawks somewhere out of sight; and, with great deliberation, Stalky spat on to the back of a young rabbit sunning himself far down where only a cliff-rabbit could have found foot-hold. Great gray and black gulls screamed against the jackdaws; the heavy-scented acres of bloom round them were alive with low-nesting birds, singing or silent as the shadow of the wheeling hawks passed and returned; and on the naked turf across the combe rabbits thumped and frolicked.",part tough stem window open far view deep sea nose pebble couple foot hear young jackdaw squawk ledge hiss jabber nest hawk sight great deliberation spat back young rabbit sun cliff rabbit find foot hold great gray black gull scream jackdaw heavy scent acre bloom alive low nest bird sing silent shadow wheeling hawk pass return naked turf combe rabbit thump frolick 
38,"“Whew! What a place! Talk of natural history; this is it,” said Stalky, filling himself a pipe. “Isn’t it scrumptious? Good old sea!” He spat again approvingly, and was silent.",place talk natural history say fill pipe scrumptious good old sea spat silent 
39,"McTurk and Beetle had taken out their books and were lying on their stomachs, chin in hand. The sea snored and gurgled; the birds, scattered for the moment by these new animals, returned to their businesses, and the boys read on in the rich, warm, sleepy silence.",take book lie stomach chin hand sea snore gurgle bird scatter moment new animal return business boy read rich warm sleepy silence 
40,"“Hullo, here’s a keeper,” said Stalky, shutting “Handley Cross”  cautiously, and peering through the jungle. A man with a gun appeared on the sky-line to the east. “Confound him, he’s going to sit down.”",keeper say shut peer jungle man gun appear sky line east confound go sit 
41,"“He’d swear we were poachin’, too,” said Beetle. “What’s the good of pheasants’ eggs? They’re always addled, too.”",swear poachin’ say good pheasant egg addled 
42,"“Might as well get up to the wood, I think,” said Stalky. “We don’t want G. M. Dabney, Col., J.P., to be bothered about us so soon. Up the wuzzy and keep quiet! He may have followed us, you know.”",get wood think say want bother wuzzy keep quiet follow know 
43,Beetle was already far up the tunnel. They heard him gasp indescribably: there was the crash of a heavy body leaping through the furze.,tunnel hear gasp be crash heavy body leap furze 
44,"“Aie! yeou little red rascal. I see yeou!” The keeper threw the gun to his shoulder, and fired both barrels in their direction. The pellets dusted the dry stems round them as a big fox plunged between Stalky’s legs, and ran over the cliff-edge.",little red rascal see keeper throw gun shoulder fire barrel direction pellet dust dry stem big fox plunge leg run cliff edge

54,"“He’s cracked,” said Beetle, miserably, as they followed. Indeed, this was a new Turkey--a haughty, angular, nose-lifted Turkey--whom they accompanied through a shrubbery on to a lawn, where a white-whiskered old gentleman with a cleek was alternately putting and blaspheming vigorously.",crack say follow new haughty angular nose lift accompany shrubbery lawn white whiskered old gentleman cleek put blasphem

Ye needn’t laugh at it.” (McTurk’s not too lovely features had twisted themselves into a horrible sneer at the word pheasant.) “You’ve been birds’-nesting. You needn’t hide your hat. I can see that you belong to the College. Don’t attempt to deny it. Ye do! Your name and number at once, sir. Ye want to speak to me--Eh? You saw my notice-boards? Must have.

58,"“Lo-look here, sir. Do--do you shoot foxes? Because, if you don’t, your keeper does. We’ve seen him! I do-don’t care what you call us--but it’s an awful thing. It’s the ruin of good feelin’ among neighbors. A ma-man ought to say once and for all how he stands about preservin’. It’s worse than murder, because there’s no legal remedy.” McTurk was quoting confusedly from his father, while the old gentleman made noises in his throat.",look sir shoot fox keeper see care call awful thing ruin good feelin’ neighbor ma-man say stand preserve bad murder be legal remedy quote father old gentleman make noise throat

61,"And four years before Stalky and Beetle had carefully kicked McTurk out of his Irish dialect! Assuredly he had gone mad or taken a sunstroke, and as assuredly he would be slain--once by the old gentleman and once by the Head. A public licking for the three was the least they could expect. Yet--if their eyes and ears were to be trusted--the old gentleman had collapsed. It might be a lull before the storm, but--",year kick irish dialect go mad take sunstroke slain old gentleman public lick least expect eye ear trust old gentleman collapse lull storm

McTurk was treading again the barren purple mountains of the rainy West coast, where in his holidays he was viceroy of four thousand naked acres, only son of a three-hundred-year-old house, lord of a crazy fishing-boat, and the idol of his father’s shiftless tenantry. It was the landed man speaking to his equal--deep calling to deep--and the old gentleman acknowledged the cry.",forgott forget decency due elder tread barren purple mountain rainy coast holiday viceroy naked acre son year old house lord crazy fishing boat idol father shiftless tenantry land man speak equal deep calling deep old gentleman acknowledge cry

It’s enough to ruin the reputation of an archangel. Don’t attempt to deny it. It is! Your father has brought you up well. He has. I’d much like the pleasure of his acquaintance. Very much, indeed.

The two glasses of strong home-brewed had brought a melancholy upon the boy, for, slowly strolling with his hands in his pockets, he crooned:--“Oh, Paddy dear, and did ye hear the news that’s goin’ round?”",dismiss many compliment high gate split oak park paling stand play second say dumb fiddle regard world glasses strong home brew bring melancholy boy stroll hand pocket croon dear hear news goin

Boys that he understood attended house-matches and could be accounted for at any moment. But he had heard McTurk openly deride cricket--even house-matches; Beetle’s views on the honor of the house he knew were incendiary; and he could never tell when the soft and smiling Stalky was laughing at him.

90,"The boys did not concern themselves with lessons for the next few days. They had all Colonel Dabney’s estate to play with, and they explored it with the stealth of Red Indians and the accuracy of burglars.

The shelter of the gorze by the cliff-edge was their chosen retreat. Beetle christened it the Pleasant Isle of Aves, for the peace and the shelter of it; and here, the pipes and tobacco once cache’d in a convenient ledge an arm’s length down the cliff, their position was legally unassailable.",careful cross path serve turn wear welcome show sky line move cover shelter gorze cliff edge choose retreat christen pleasant peace shelter pipe tobacco cache’d convenient ledge arm length cliff position unassailable
