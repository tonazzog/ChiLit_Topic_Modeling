2," After his interview with the king, Cuthbert was led to his tent amid the hearty plaudits of the English troops.",interview king lead tent hearty plaudit english troops 
3,"His own comrades flocked round him; the men of the greenwood headed by Cnut, were especially jubilant over his victory.",own comrade flock man head jubilant victory 
4,"""Who would have thought,"" said the tall forester, ""that the lad who but a short time ago was a child, should now have sustained the honour of the country? We feel proud of you, Cuthbert; and trust us some day or other to follow wherever you may lead, and to do some deed which will attain for you honour and glory, and to show that the men of Evesham are as doughty as any under King Richard's rule.""",think say tall forester lad short time child sustain honour country feel proud trust day other follow lead do deed attain honour glory show man doughty rule 
5,"""You must be wary, Cuthbert,"" the earl said to him that evening. ""Believe me that you and I have made a foe, who, although he may not have the power, has certainly the will to injure us to the death. I marked the eye of Count Jacquelin during the fight, and again when you were led up to the king. There was hatred and fury in his eye. The page too, I hear, is his own nephew, and he will be the laughing-stock of the French camp at having been conquered by one so much younger than himself. It will be well to keep upon your guard, and not go out at night unattended. Keep Cnut near you; he is faithful as a watch-dog, and would give his life, I am sure, for you. I will myself be also upon my guard, for it was after all my quarrel, and the fury of this fierce knight will vent itself upon both of us if the opportunity should come. I hear but a poor account of him among his confreres. They say he is one of those disgraces to the name of knight who are but a mixture of robber and soldier; that he harries all the lands in his neighbourhood; and that he has now only joined the Crusade to avoid the vengeance which the cries of the oppressed people had invoked from his liege lord. I am told indeed that the choice was given him to be outlawed, or to join the Crusades with all the strength he could raise. Naturally he adopted the latter alternative; but he has the instincts of the robber still, and will do us an evil turn, if he have the chance.""",wary earl say evening believe make foe have power have will injure death mark eye fight lead king be hatred fury eye page hear own nephew laugh stock french camp conquer young well keep guard go night unattend keep cnut faithful watch dog give life sure guard quarrel fury fierce knight vent opportunity come hear poor account confrere say disgrace name knight mixture robber soldier harry land neighbourhood join avoid vengeance cry oppress person invoke liege lord tell choice give outlaw join strength raise adopt latter alternative have instinct robber do evil turn have chance 
6,"Two days later the great army broke up its camp and marched south. After a week's journeying they encamped near a town, and halted there two or three days in order to collect provisions for the next advance; for the supplies which they could obtain in the country districts were wholly insufficient for so great a host of men. Here the armies were to separate, the French marching to Genoa, the English to Marseilles, the town at which they were to take ship.",day great army break camp march week journey encamp town halt day order collect provision next advance supplies obtain country district insufficient great host man army separate french march town take ship 
7,"One evening the earl sent Cuthbert with a message for another English lord, staying in the town at the palace of the bishop, who was a friend of his.",evening earl send message english lord stay town palace bishop friend 
8,"Cnut accompanied Cuthbert, for he now made a point of seldom letting him out of his sight. It was light when they reached the bishop's palace, but here they were delayed for some time, and night had fallen when they sallied out.",accompany make point let sight light reach bishop palace delay time night fall sall 
9,"The town was quiet, for the inhabitants cared not to show themselves in the streets now that such a large army of fierce men were in the neighbourhood.",town quiet inhabitant care show street large army fierce man neighbourhood 
10,"The others indeed of the monarchs were stringent, but discipline there was but little of, and the soldiery in those days regarded peaceful citizens as fair game; hence, when they came from the palace the streets of the city were already hushed and quiet, for the orders of the king had been preemptory that no men-at-arms, or others except those on duty, were to be away from their camp after nightfall.",other monarch stringent discipline be little soldiery day regard peaceful citizen fair game come palace street city hushed quiet order king preemptory man arm other duty camp nightfall 
11,"This order had been absolutely necessary, so many were the complaints brought in by country peasants and farmers, of the doings of bands of soldiers.",order necessary many complaint bring country peasant farmer doing band soldier 
12,"Cnut and Cuthbert proceeded along the streets unmolested for some distance. Occasionally a solitary passer-by, with hooded cape, hurried past. The moon was half full, and her light was welcome indeed, for in those days the streets were unlighted, and the pavement so bad that passage through the streets after dark was a matter of difficulty, and even of danger.",proceed street unmolested distance solitary passer hooded cape hurry past moon full light welcome day street unlighted pavement bad passage street dark matter difficulty danger 
13,"Here and there before some roadside shrine a lamp dimly burned; before these they paused, and, as good Catholics, Cnut and Cuthbert crossed themselves. Just as they had passed one of these wayside shrines, a sudden shout was heard, and a party of eight or ten men sprang out from a side street and fell upon them.",roadside shrine lamp burn pause good cross pass wayside shrine sudden shout hear party man spring side street fall 
14,"Cnut and Cuthbert drew their swords and laid about them heartily, but their assailants were too strong. Cnut was stricken to the ground, and Cuthbert, seeing that defence was hopeless, took to his heels and ran for his life. He was already wounded, but happily not so severely as in any way to disable him.",draw sword lay assailant strong stricken ground see defence hopeless take heel run life wound way disable 
15,"Seeing that it was speed, and speed alone, which now could save him, he flung aside his belt scabbard and as he ran, and with rapid steps flew along the streets, not knowing whither he went, and striving only to keep ahead of his pursuers. They, more encumbered by arms and armour, were unable to keep up with the flying footsteps of a lad clothed in the light attire of a page; but Cuthbert felt that the blood running from his wound was weakening him fast, and that unless he could gain some refuge his course must speedily come to an end. Happily he saw at some little distance ahead of him a man standing by a door. Just as he arrived the door opened, and a glow of light from within fell on the road, showing that the person entering was a monk.",see speed speed save flung belt scabbard run rapid step fly street know go striving keep pursuer encumber arm armour unable keep fly footstep lad cloth light attire page feel blood run wound weaken gain refuge course come end see little distance man stand door arrive door open glow light fall road show person enter monk 
16,"Without a moment's hesitation Cuthbert rushed through the door, shouting ""Sanctuary!"" and sank almost fainting on the ground.",moment hesitation rush door shouting sink fainting ground 
17,"The monks, accustomed to wild pursuits and scenes of outrage in those warlike days, hastily closed the door, barring it securely. In a moment there was a rush of men against it from without.",monk accustom wild pursuit scene outrage warlike day close door barr moment be rush man 
18,One of the monks opened a lattice above the door.,monk open lattice door 
19,"""What mean you,"" he said, ""by this outrage? Know ye not that this is the Monastery of St. John, and that it is sacrilege to lay a hand of violence even against its postern? Begone,"" he said, ""or we'll lodge a complaint before the king.""",mean say outrage know sacrilege lay hand violence postern say lodge complaint king 
20,"The assailants, nothing daunted, continued to batter at the door; but at this moment the monks, aroused from their beds, hastened to the spot, and seizing bill and sword--for in those days even monks were obliged at times to depend upon carnal weapons--they opened the door, and flung themselves upon the assailants with such force that the latter, surprised and discomfited, were forced to make a hasty retreat.",assailant daunt continue batter door moment monk arouse bed hasten spot seize bill sword day monk oblige time depend carnal weapon open door flung assailant such force latter surprise discomfite force make hasty retreat 
21,"The doors were then again barred, and Cuthbert was carried up to a cell in the building, where the leech of the monastery speedily examined his wound, and pronounced, that although his life was not in danger by it, he was greatly weakened by the loss of blood, that the wound was a serious one, and that it would be some time before the patient would recover.",door barr carry cell building leech monastery examine wound pronounce life danger weaken loss blood wound serious one time patient recover 
22,"It was two days before Cuthbert was sufficiently restored to be able to speak. His first question to the monk was as to his whereabouts, and how long he had been there. Upon being answered, he entreated that a messenger might be despatched to the camp of the Earl of Evesham, to beg that a litter might be sent for him, and to inquire what had become of Cnut, whom he had last seen stricken down.",day restore able speak first question monk whereabouts answer entreat messenger despatch camp beg litter send inquire become see stricken 
23,"The monk replied, ""My son, I grieve to tell you that your request cannot be complied with. The army moved away yesternoon, and is now some five-and-twenty miles distant. There is nothing for you but patience, and when restored you can follow the army, and rejoin your master before he embarks at Marseilles. But how is it that a lad so young as you can have incurred the enmity of those who sought your life? For it is clear from the pertinacity with which they urged their attack that their object was not plunder, of which indeed they would get but little from you, but to take your life.""",monk reply son grieve tell request complie army move mile distant be patience restore follow army rejoin master embark lad young incur enmity seek life clear pertinacity urge attack object plunder get little take life 
24,"Cuthbert recounted the circumstances which had led to the feud of the Count of Brabant against him, for he doubted not that this truculent knight was at the bottom of the attack.",recount circumstance lead feud doubt truculent knight bottom attack 
25,"""After what has happened,"" the monk said, ""you will need have caution when you leave here. The place where you have taken refuge is known to them, and should this wild noble persist in his desire for vengeance against you, he will doubtless leave some of his ruffians to watch the monastery. We will keep a look-out, and note if any strangers are to be seen near the gates; if we find that it is so, we shall consider what is best to be done. We could of course appeal to the mayor for protection against them, and could even have the strangers ejected from the town or cast into prison; but it is not likely that we should succeed in capturing more than the fellow who may be placed on the look-out, and the danger would be in no wise lessened to yourself. But there is time to talk over this matter before you leave. It will be another fortnight at least before you will be able to pursue your journey.""",happen monk say need have caution leave place take refuge know wild noble persist desire vengeance leave ruffian watch monastery keep look note stranger see gate find consider good do course appeal mayor protection have stranger eject town cast prison likely succeed capture more fellow place look danger wise lessen be time talk matter leave fortnight least able pursue journey 
26,"Cuthbert gained strength more rapidly than the monk had expected. He was generously fed, and this and his good constitution soon enabled him to recover from the loss of blood; and at the end of five days he expressed his hope that he could on the following day pursue his journey. The monk who attended him shook his head.",gain strength monk expect feed good constitution enable recover loss blood end day express hope follow day pursue journey monk attend shake head 
27,"""Thou mightst, under ordinary circumstances, quit us to-morrow, for thou art well enough to take part in the ordinary pursuits of a page; but to journey is a different thing. You may have all sorts of hardships to endure; you may have even to trust for your life to your speed and endurance; and it would be madness for you to go until your strength is fully established. I regret to tell you that we have ascertained beyond a doubt that the monastery is closely watched. We have sent some of the acolytes out, dressed in the garbs of monks, and attended by one of our elder brethren; and in each case, a monk who followed at a distance of fifty yards was able to perceive that they were watched. The town is full of rough men, the hangers-on of the army; some, indeed, are followers of laggard knights, but the greater portion are men who merely pursue the army with a view to gain by its necessities, to buy plunder from the soldiers, and to rob, and, if necessary, to murder should there be a hope of obtaining gold. Among these men your enemies would have little difficulty in recruiting any number, and no appeal that we could make to the mayor would protect you from them when you have left the walls. We must trust to our ingenuity in smuggling you out. After that, it is upon your own strength and shrewdness that you must rely for an escape from any snares that may be laid for you. You will see, then, that at least another three or four days are needed before you can set forth. Your countrymen are so far away that a matter of a few days will make but little difference. They will in any case be delayed for a long time at Marseilles before they embark; and whether you leave now or a month hence, you would be equally in time to join them before their embarkation--that is, supposing that you make your way through the snares which beset you.""",mightst ordinary circumstance quit art take part ordinary pursuit page journey different thing have sort hardship endure have trust life speed endurance madness go strength establish regret tell ascertain doubt monastery watch send acolyte dress garb monk attend elder brethren case monk follow distance yard able perceive watch town full rough man hanger army follower laggard knight great portion man pursue army view gain necessity buy plunder soldier rob necessary murder be hope obtain gold man enemy have little difficulty recruiting number appeal make mayor protect leave wall trust ingenuity smuggle own strength shrewdness rely escape snare lay see least day need set countryman matter few day make little difference case delay long time embark leave month time join embarkation suppose make way snare beset 
28,"Cuthbert saw the justice of the reasoning, and it was another week before he announced himself as feeling absolutely restored to strength again, and capable of bearing as much exertion as he could have done before his attack.",see justice reasoning week announce feel restore strength capable bear much exertion do attack 
29,"A long consultation was held with the prior and a monk who had acted as his leech, as to the best plan of getting Cuthbert beyond the walls of the city. Many schemes were proposed and rejected. Every monk who ventured beyond the walls had been closely scrutinized, and one or two of short stature had even been jostled in the streets, so as to throw back their hoods and expose a sight of their faces. It was clear, then, that it would be dangerous to trust to a disguise. Cuthbert proposed that he should leave at night, trusting solely to their directions as to the turnings he should take to bring him to the city walls, and that, taking a rope, he should there let himself down, and make the best of his way forward. This, however, the monks would not consent to, assuring him that the watch was so strictly kept round the monastery that he would inevitably be seen.",long consultation hold prior monk act leech good plan get wall city many scheme propose reject monk venture wall scrutinize short stature jostle street throw hood expose sight face clear dangerous trust disguise propose leave night trust direction turning take bring city wall take rope let make good way monk consent assure watch keep monastery see 
30,"""No,"" the prior said, ""the method, whatever it is, must be as open as possible; and though I cannot at this moment hit upon a plan, I will think it over to-night, and putting my ideas with those of Father Jerome here, and the sacristan, who has a shrewd head, it will be hard if we cannot between us contrive some plan to evade the watch of those robber villains who beset the convent.""",prior say method open possible moment hit plan think night put idea sacristan have shrewd head hard contrive plan evade watch robber villain beset convent 
31,"The next morning when the prior came in to see Cuthbert, the latter said, ""Good father, I have determined not to endeavour to make off in disguise. I doubt not that your wit could contrive some means by which I should get clear of the walls without observation from the scouts of this villain noble. But once in the country, I should have neither horse nor armour, and should have hard work indeed to make my way down through France, even though none of my enemies were on my track. I will therefore, if it please you, go down boldly to the Mayor, and claim a protection and escort. If he will but grant me a few men-at-arms for one day's ride from the town, I can choose my own route, and riding out in mail can then take my chance of finding my way down to Marseilles.""",next morning prior come see latter say good father determine endeavour make disguise doubt wit contrive means get clear wall observation scout villain noble country have horse armour have hard work make way enemy track go claim protection escort grant few man arm day ride town choose own route ride mail take chance find way 
32,"""I will go down with you, my son,"" the prior said, ""to the mayor. Two of my monks shall accompany us; and assuredly no insult will be offered to you in the street thus accompanied."" Shortly afterwards, Cuthbert started as arranged, and soon arrived at the house of the mayor, Sir John de Cahors.",go son prior say mayor monk accompany insult offer street accompany start arrange arrive house mayor 
33,"Upon the prior making known to this knight whom he had brought with him, the mayor exclaimed,--",prior making know knight bring mayor exclaim 
34,"""Pest! young gentleman; you have caused us no small trouble and concern. We have had ridings to and fro concerning you, and furious messages from your fiery king. When in the morning a tall, stalwart knave dressed in green was found, slashed about in various places, lying on the pavement, the townsmen, not knowing who he was, but finding that he still breathed, carried him to the English camp, and he was claimed as a follower of the Earl of Evesham. There was great wrath and anger over this; and an hour later the earl himself came down and stated that his page was missing, and that there was reason to believe that he had been foully murdered, as he had accompanied the man found wounded. Fortunately the bulk of the armies had marched away at early dawn, and the earl had only remained behind in consequence of the absence of his followers. I assured the angry Englishman that I would have a thorough search made in the town; and although in no way satisfied, he rode off after his king with all his force, carrying with him the long-limbed man whom we had picked up. Two days after, a message came back from King Richard himself, saying that unless this missing page were discovered, or if, he being killed, his murderers were not brought to justice and punished, he would assuredly on his return from the Holy Land burn the town over our ears. Your king is not a man who minces matters. However, threatened men live long, especially when the person who threatens is starting for a journey, from which, as like or not, he may never return. However, I have had diligent search made for you. All the houses of bad repute have been examined, and their inhabitants questioned. But there are so many camp-followers and other rabble at present in the town that a hundred men might disappear without our being able to obtain a clue. I doubted not indeed that your body had been thrown in the river, and that we should never hear more of you. I am right glad that you have been restored; not indeed from any fear of the threats of the king your master, but because, from what the Earl of Evesham said, you were a lad likely to come to great fame and honour. The earl left in my charge your horse, and the armour which he said you wore at a tournament lately, in case we should hear aught of you.""",pest young gentleman cause small trouble concern have riding for concern furious message fiery king morning tall stalwart knave dress green find slash various place lie pavement townsmen know find breathe carry english camp claim follower be great wrath anger hour earl come state page miss be reason believe murder accompany man find wound bulk army march early dawn earl remain consequence absence follower assure angry have thorough search make town way satisfy ride king force carry long limb man pick day message come say missing page discover kill murderer bring justice punish return holy burn town ear king man mince matter threaten man live person threaten start journey return have diligent search make house bad repute examine inhabitant question be many camp follower other rabble present town man disappear able obtain clue doubt body throw river hear more glad restore fear threat king master say lad likely come great fame honour earl leave charge horse armour say wear tournament case hear aught 
35,"Cuthbert gave an exclamation of pleasure. His purse contained but a few pieces of silver, and being without arms except for his short dagger, or means of locomotion, the difficulties of the journey down to Marseilles had sorely puzzled him. But with his good horse between his knees, and his suit of Milan armour on his back, he thought that he might make his way through any dangers which threatened him.",give exclamation pleasure purse contain few piece silver arm short dagger means locomotion difficulty journey puzzle good horse knee suit armour back think make way danger threaten

37,"""If I could find the varlets, I would hang them over the gates of the town,"" the knight said wrathfully. ""But as at the present moment there are nearly as many rogues as honest men in the place, it would be a wholesale hanging indeed to ensure getting hold of the right people. Moreover, it is not probable that another attempt upon his life will be made inside our walls; and doubtless the main body of this gang are somewhere without, intending to assault him when he continues his journey, and they have left but a spy or two here to inform them as to his movements. I will give you any aid in my power, young sir. The army is by this time nigh Marseilles, and, sooth to say, I have no body of men-at-arms whom I could send as your escort for so long a distance. I have but a small body here, and they are needed, and sorely too, to keep order within the walls.""",find varlet hang gate town knight say present moment be many rogue honest man place wholesale hanging ensure get hold right person probable attempt life make wall main body gang intend assault continue journey leave spy inform movement give aid power young sir army time seek say have body man arm send escort distance have small body need keep order wall

Doubtless they suppose that I should travel by the main road south; but by going the first day's journey either east or west, and then striking some southward road, I should get a fair start of them, throw all their plans out, and perchance reach Marseilles without interruption.""",think sir say lend party say man arm ride first day trust procure honest man act guide companion suppose travel main road go first day journey strike southward road get fair start throw plan perchance reach interruption
