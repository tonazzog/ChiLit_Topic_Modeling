1,CHAPTER IV. I RUN A GREAT DANGER IN THE HOUSE OF SHAWS,run great danger 
2,"For a day that was begun so ill, the day passed fairly well. We had the porridge cold again at noon, and hot porridge at night; porridge and small beer was my uncle’s diet. He spoke but little, and that in the same way as before, shooting a question at me after a long silence; and when I sought to lead him to talk about my future, slipped out of it again. In a room next door to the kitchen, where he suffered me to go, I found a great number of books, both Latin and English, in which I took great pleasure all the afternoon. Indeed, the time passed so lightly in this good company, that I began to be almost reconciled to my residence at Shaws; and nothing but the sight of my uncle, and his eyes playing hide and seek with mine, revived the force of my distrust.",day begin ill day pass have porridge cold noon hot porridge night porridge small beer uncle diet speak little same way shoot question long silence seek lead talk future slip room next door kitchen suffer go find great number book latin take great pleasure afternoon time pass good company begin reconcile residence sight uncle eye play hide seek revive force distrust 
3,"One thing I discovered, which put me in some doubt. This was an entry on the fly-leaf of a chap-book (one of Patrick Walker’s) plainly written by my father’s hand and thus conceived: “To my brother Ebenezer on his fifth birthday.” Now, what puzzled me was this: That, as my father was of course the younger brother, he must either have made some strange error, or he must have written, before he was yet five, an excellent, clear manly hand of writing.",thing discover put doubt entry fly leaf chap book write father hand conceive brother fifth birthday puzzle father course young brother make strange error write excellent clear manly hand writing 
4,"I tried to get this out of my head; but though I took down many interesting authors, old and new, history, poetry, and story-book, this notion of my father’s hand of writing stuck to me; and when at length I went back into the kitchen, and sat down once more to porridge and small beer, the first thing I said to Uncle Ebenezer was to ask him if my father had not been very quick at his book.",try get head take many interesting author old new history poetry story book notion father hand writing stick length go kitchen sit more porridge small beer first thing say ask father quick book 
5,"“Alexander? No him!” was the reply. “I was far quicker mysel’; I was a clever chappie when I was young. Why, I could read as soon as he could.”",reply quick mysel clever chappie young read 
6,"This puzzled me yet more; and a thought coming into my head, I asked if he and my father had been twins.",puzzle more thought come head ask father twin 
7,"He jumped upon his stool, and the horn spoon fell out of his hand upon the floor. “What gars ye ask that?” he said, and he caught me by the breast of the jacket, and looked this time straight into my eyes: his own were little and light, and bright like a bird’s, blinking and winking strangely.",jump stool horn spoon fall hand floor gar ask say catch breast jacket look time eye own little light bright bird blink wink 
8,"“What do you mean?” I asked, very calmly, for I was far stronger than he, and not easily frightened. “Take your hand from my jacket. This is no way to behave.”",mean ask strong frighten take hand jacket way behave 
9,"My uncle seemed to make a great effort upon himself. “Dod man, David,”  he said, “ye should-nae speak to me about your father. That’s where the mistake is.” He sat awhile and shook, blinking in his plate: “He was all the brother that ever I had,” he added, but with no heart in his voice; and then he caught up his spoon and fell to supper again, but still shaking.",uncle seem make great effort man say speak father mistake sit shake blink plate brother have add heart voice catch spoon fall supper shake 
10,"Now this last passage, this laying of hands upon my person and sudden profession of love for my dead father, went so clean beyond my comprehension that it put me into both fear and hope. On the one hand, I began to think my uncle was perhaps insane and might be dangerous; on the other, there came up into my mind (quite unbidden by me and even discouraged) a story like some ballad I had heard folk singing, of a poor lad that was a rightful heir and a wicked kinsman that tried to keep him from his own. For why should my uncle play a part with a relative that came, almost a beggar, to his door, unless in his heart he had some cause to fear him?",last passage laying hand person sudden profession love dead father go clean comprehension put fear hope hand begin think uncle insane dangerous other come mind unbidden discourage story ballad hear folk singing poor lad rightful heir wicked kinsman try keep own uncle play part relative come beggar door heart have cause fear 
11,"With this notion, all unacknowledged, but nevertheless getting firmly settled in my head, I now began to imitate his covert looks; so that we sat at table like a cat and a mouse, each stealthily observing the other. Not another word had he to say to me, black or white, but was busy turning something secretly over in his mind; and the longer we sat and the more I looked at him, the more certain I became that the something was unfriendly to myself.",notion unacknowledged settle head begin imitate covert look sit table cat mouse observe other word have say black white busy turn mind long sit more look certain become unfriendly 
12,"When he had cleared the platter, he got out a single pipeful of tobacco, just as in the morning, turned round a stool into the chimney corner, and sat awhile smoking, with his back to me.",clear platter get single pipeful tobacco morning turn stool chimney corner sit smoking back 
13,"“Davie,” he said, at length, “I’ve been thinking;” then he paused, and said it again. “There’s a wee bit siller that I half promised ye before ye were born,” he continued; “promised it to your father. O, naething legal, ye understand; just gentlemen daffing at their wine. Well, I keepit that bit money separate--it was a great expense, but a promise is a promise--and it has grown by now to be a matter of just precisely--just exactly”--and here he paused and stumbled--“of just exactly forty pounds!” This last he rapped out with a sidelong glance over his shoulder; and the next moment added, almost with a scream, “Scots!”",say length think pause say be wee bit siller half promise bear continue promise father naeth legal understand gentleman daff wine keepit bit money separate great expense promise promise grow matter pause stumble pound last rapp sidelong glance shoulder next moment add scream 
14,"The pound Scots being the same thing as an English shilling, the difference made by this second thought was considerable; I could see, besides, that the whole story was a lie, invented with some end which it puzzled me to guess; and I made no attempt to conceal the tone of raillery in which I answered--",pound same thing english shilling difference make second thought considerable see whole story lie invent end puzzle guess make attempt conceal tone raillery answer 
15,"“O, think again, sir! Pounds sterling, I believe!”",think sir pound sterling believe 
16,"“That’s what I said,” returned my uncle: “pounds sterling! And if you’ll step out-by to the door a minute, just to see what kind of a night it is, I’ll get it out to ye and call ye in again.”",say return uncle pound sterling step door minute see kind night get call 
17,"I did his will, smiling to myself in my contempt that he should think I was so easily to be deceived. It was a dark night, with a few stars low down; and as I stood just outside the door, I heard a hollow moaning of wind far off among the hills. I said to myself there was something thundery and changeful in the weather, and little knew of what a vast importance that should prove to me before the evening passed.",do will smile contempt think deceive dark night few star low stand door hear hollow moan wind hill say be thundery changeful weather little know vast importance prove evening pass 
18,"When I was called in again, my uncle counted out into my hand seven and thirty golden guinea pieces; the rest was in his hand, in small gold and silver; but his heart failed him there, and he crammed the change into his pocket.",call uncle count hand golden guinea piece rest hand small gold silver heart fail cramm change pocket 
19,"“There,” said he, “that’ll show you! I’m a queer man, and strange wi’ strangers; but my word is my bond, and there’s the proof of it.”",say show queer man strange wi’ stranger word bond be proof 
20,"Now, my uncle seemed so miserly that I was struck dumb by this sudden generosity, and could find no words in which to thank him.",uncle seem miserly strike dumb sudden generosity find word thank 
21,"“No a word!” said he. “Nae thanks; I want nae thanks. I do my duty. I’m no saying that everybody would have done it; but for my part (though I’m a careful body, too) it’s a pleasure to me to do the right by my brother’s son; and it’s a pleasure to me to think that now we’ll agree as such near friends should.”",word say thanks want nae thanks do duty say do part careful body pleasure do right brother son pleasure think agree such friend 
22,"I spoke him in return as handsomely as I was able; but all the while I was wondering what would come next, and why he had parted with his precious guineas; for as to the reason he had given, a baby would have refused it.",speak return able wonder come part precious guinea reason give baby refuse 
23,Presently he looked towards me sideways.,look 
24,"“And see here,” says he, “tit for tat.”",see say tat 
25,"I told him I was ready to prove my gratitude in any reasonable degree, and then waited, looking for some monstrous demand. And yet, when at last he plucked up courage to speak, it was only to tell me (very properly, as I thought) that he was growing old and a little broken, and that he would expect me to help him with the house and the bit garden.",tell ready prove gratitude reasonable degree wait look monstrous demand last pluck courage speak tell think grow old little break expect help house bit garden 
26,"I answered, and expressed my readiness to serve.",answer express readiness serve 
27,"“Well,” he said, “let’s begin.” He pulled out of his pocket a rusty key. “There,” says he, “there’s the key of the stair-tower at the far end of the house. Ye can only win into it from the outside, for that part of the house is no finished. Gang ye in there, and up the stairs, and bring me down the chest that’s at the top. There’s papers in’t,” he added.",say let begin pull pocket rusty key say be key stair tower far end house win outside part house finish gang stair bring chest top be paper add 
28,"“Can I have a light, sir?” said I.",have light sir say 
29,"“Na,” said he, very cunningly. “Nae lights in my house.”",say light house 
30,"“Very well, sir,” said I. “Are the stairs good?”",sir say stair good 
31,"“They’re grand,” said he; and then, as I was going, “Keep to the wall,”  he added; “there’s nae bannisters. But the stairs are grand underfoot.”",grand say go keep wall add be nae bannister stair grand underfoot 
32,"Out I went into the night. The wind was still moaning in the distance, though never a breath of it came near the house of Shaws. It had fallen blacker than ever; and I was glad to feel along the wall, till I came the length of the stairtower door at the far end of the unfinished wing. I had got the key into the keyhole and had just turned it, when all upon a sudden, without sound of wind or thunder, the whole sky lighted up with wild fire and went black again. I had to put my hand over my eyes to get back to the colour of the darkness; and indeed I was already half blinded when I stepped into the tower.",go night wind moan distance breath come house fall blacker glad feel wall come length stairtower door far end unfinished wing get key keyhole turn sudden sound wind thunder whole sky light wild fire go black have put hand eye get colour darkness half blind step tower 
33,"It was so dark inside, it seemed a body could scarce breathe; but I pushed out with foot and hand, and presently struck the wall with the one, and the lowermost round of the stair with the other. The wall, by the touch, was of fine hewn stone; the steps too, though somewhat steep and narrow, were of polished masonwork, and regular and solid underfoot. Minding my uncle’s word about the bannisters, I kept close to the tower side, and felt my way in the pitch darkness with a beating heart.",dark seem body breathe push foot hand strike wall one lowermost round stair other wall touch fine hewn stone step steep narrow polished masonwork regular solid underfoot mind uncle word bannister keep tower side feel way pitch darkness beating heart 
34,"The house of Shaws stood some five full storeys high, not counting lofts. Well, as I advanced, it seemed to me the stair grew airier and a thought more lightsome; and I was wondering what might be the cause of this change, when a second blink of the summer lightning came and went. If I did not cry out, it was because fear had me by the throat; and if I did not fall, it was more by Heaven’s mercy than my own strength. It was not only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the wall, so that I seemed to be clambering aloft upon an open scaffold, but the same passing brightness showed me the steps were of unequal length, and that one of my feet rested that moment within two inches of the well.",house stand full storey high count loft advance seem stair grow airier thought more lightsome wonder cause change second blink summer lightning come go cry fear have throat fall more mercy own strength flash shine side breach wall seem clamber open scaffold same passing brightness show step unequal length foot rest moment inch 
35,"This was the grand stair! I thought; and with the thought, a gust of a kind of angry courage came into my heart. My uncle had sent me here, certainly to run great risks, perhaps to die. I swore I would settle that “perhaps,” if I should break my neck for it; got me down upon my hands and knees; and as slowly as a snail, feeling before me every inch, and testing the solidity of every stone, I continued to ascend the stair. The darkness, by contrast with the flash, appeared to have redoubled; nor was that all, for my ears were now troubled and my mind confounded by a great stir of bats in the top part of the tower, and the foul beasts, flying downwards, sometimes beat about my face and body.",grand stair think thought gust kind angry courage come heart uncle send run great risk die swore settle break neck get hand knee snail feel inch test solidity stone continue ascend stair darkness contrast flash appear redoubl ear trouble mind confound great stir bat top part tower foul beast fly beat face body 
36,"The tower, I should have said, was square; and in every corner the step was made of a great stone of a different shape to join the flights. Well, I had come close to one of these turns, when, feeling forward as usual, my hand slipped upon an edge and found nothing but emptiness beyond it. The stair had been carried no higher; to set a stranger mounting it in the darkness was to send him straight to his death; and (although, thanks to the lightning and my own precautions, I was safe enough) the mere thought of the peril in which I might have stood, and the dreadful height I might have fallen from, brought out the sweat upon my body and relaxed my joints.",tower say square corner step make great stone different shape join flight come turn feel usual hand slip edge find emptiness stair carry high set stranger mount darkness send death thanks lightning own precaution safe mere thought peril stand dreadful height fall bring sweat body relax joint 
37,"But I knew what I wanted now, and turned and groped my way down again, with a wonderful anger in my heart. About half-way down, the wind sprang up in a clap and shook the tower, and died again; the rain followed; and before I had reached the ground level it fell in buckets. I put out my head into the storm, and looked along towards the kitchen. The door, which I had shut behind me when I left, now stood open, and shed a little glimmer of light; and I thought I could see a figure standing in the rain, quite still, like a man hearkening. And then there came a blinding flash, which showed me my uncle plainly, just where I had fancied him to stand; and hard upon the heels of it, a great tow-row of thunder.",know want turn grope way wonderful anger heart half way wind spring clap shake tower die rain follow reach ground level fall bucket put head storm look kitchen door shut leave stand open shed little glimmer light think see figure stand rain man hearken come blind flash show uncle fancy stand heel great tow row thunder 
38,"Now, whether my uncle thought the crash to be the sound of my fall, or whether he heard in it God’s voice denouncing murder, I will leave you to guess. Certain it is, at least, that he was seized on by a kind of panic fear, and that he ran into the house and left the door open behind him. I followed as softly as I could, and, coming unheard into the kitchen, stood and watched him.",uncle think crash sound fall hear voice denounce murder leave guess certain least seize kind panic fear run house leave door open follow come unheard kitchen stand watch 
39,"He had found time to open the corner cupboard and bring out a great case bottle of aqua vitae, and now sat with his back towards me at the table. Ever and again he would be seized with a fit of deadly shuddering and groan aloud, and carrying the bottle to his lips, drink down the raw spirits by the mouthful.",find time open corner cupboard bring great case bottle aqua vitae sit back table seize fit deadly shuddering groan carry bottle lip drink raw spirit mouthful 
40,"I stepped forward, came close behind him where he sat, and suddenly clapping my two hands down upon his shoulders--“Ah!” cried I.",step come sit clap hand shoulder cry 
41,"My uncle gave a kind of broken cry like a sheep’s bleat, flung up his arms, and tumbled to the floor like a dead man. I was somewhat shocked at this; but I had myself to look to first of all, and did not hesitate to let him lie as he had fallen. The keys were hanging in the cupboard; and it was my design to furnish myself with arms before my uncle should come again to his senses and the power of devising evil. In the cupboard were a few bottles, some apparently of medicine; a great many bills and other papers, which I should willingly enough have rummaged, had I had the time; and a few necessaries that were nothing to my purpose. Thence I turned to the chests. The first was full of meal; the second of moneybags and papers tied into sheaves; in the third, with many other things (and these for the most part clothes) I found a rusty, ugly-looking Highland dirk without the scabbard. This, then, I concealed inside my waistcoat, and turned to my uncle.",uncle give kind break cry sheep bleat flung arm tumble floor dead man shocked have look first hesitate let lie fall key hang cupboard design furnish arm uncle come sense power devise evil cupboard few bottle medicine great many bill other paper rummage have time few necessary purpose turn chest first full meal second moneybag paper tie sheave third many other thing most part clothes find rusty ugly look dirk scabbard conceal waistcoat turn uncle 
42,"He lay as he had fallen, all huddled, with one knee up and one arm sprawling abroad; his face had a strange colour of blue, and he seemed to have ceased breathing. Fear came on me that he was dead; then I got water and dashed it in his face; and with that he seemed to come a little to himself, working his mouth and fluttering his eyelids. At last he looked up and saw me, and there came into his eyes a terror that was not of this world.",lay fall huddle knee arm sprawl face have strange colour blue seem cease breathe fear come dead get water dash face seem come little work mouth flutter eyelid last look see come eye terror world

45,"“That am I,” said I. “Small thanks to you!”",say small thanks 
46,"He had begun to seek for his breath with deep sighs. “The blue phial,”  said he--“in the aumry--the blue phial.” His breath came slower still.",begin seek breath deep sigh blue phial say aumry blue phial breath come slow 
47,"I ran to the cupboard, and, sure enough, found there a blue phial of medicine, with the dose written on it on a paper, and this I administered to him with what speed I might.",run cupboard find blue phial medicine dose write paper administer speed 
48,"“It’s the trouble,” said he, reviving a little; “I have a trouble, Davie. It’s the heart.”",trouble say revive little have trouble heart 
49,"I set him on a chair and looked at him. It is true I felt some pity for a man that looked so sick, but I was full besides of righteous anger; and I numbered over before him the points on which I wanted explanation: why he lied to me at every word; why he feared that I should leave him; why he disliked it to be hinted that he and my father were twins--“Is that because it is true?” I asked; why he had given me money to which I was convinced I had no claim; and, last of all, why he had tried to kill me. He heard me all through in silence; and then, in a broken voice, begged me to let him go to bed.",set chair look true feel pity man look sick full righteous anger number point want explanation lie word fear leave dislike hint father twin true ask give money convinced have claim last try kill hear silence break voice begg let go bed 
50,"“I’ll tell ye the morn,” he said; “as sure as death I will.”",tell morn say sure death 
51,"And so weak was he that I could do nothing but consent. I locked him into his room, however, and pocketed the key, and then returning to the kitchen, made up such a blaze as had not shone there for many a long year, and wrapping myself in my plaid, lay down upon the chests and fell asleep.",weak do consent lock room pocket key return kitchen make blaze shine many long year wrap plaid lay chest fall asleep
