1,"CHAPTER XXXIX. ""GIRLS ARE FUNNY THINGS.""",girls funny thing 
2," ""Girls are funny things"" was Hugh John's favourite maxim; and he forthwith proceeded to prove that boys are too, by making a point of seeing Cissy Carter several times a week during his entire vacation. Yet he was unhappy as often as he went to Oaklands, and only more unhappy when he stayed away. On the whole, Cissy was much less frigid than on that first memorable evening. But she never thawed entirely, nor could Hugh John discover the least trace of the hair-brained madcap of ancient days for whom his whole soul longed, in the charmingly attired young lady whose talk and appearance were so much beyond her years. But he shaved three or four times a day with his new razors, sneaking hot water on the sly in order to catch up.",girl funny thing favourite maxim proceed prove boy make point see several time week entire vacation unhappy go unhappy stay whole frigid first memorable evening thaw discover least trace hair brain madcap ancient day whole soul long attire young lady talk appearance much year shave time day new razor sneak hot water sly order catch 
3,"The last time he could hope to see her before going back to school for his final term, was on the evening of a day when Hugh John had successfully captained a team of schoolboys and visitors from the surrounding country-houses against the best eleven which Edam could produce. Cissy Carter had looked on with Mr. Courtenay Carling by her side, while Captain (once General Napoleon) Smith made seventy-seven, and carried out his still virgin bat amid the cheers of the spectators, after having beaten the Edamites by four wickets, and with only six minutes to spare in order to save the draw.",last time hope see go school final term evening day captain team schoolboy visitor surround country house good produce look side make carry virgin bat cheer spectator beat wicket minute spare order save draw 
4,"""Oh, well played!"" cried Mr. Carling patronisingly, as Hugh John came up, modestly swinging his bat as if he did as much every day of his life; ""I remember when I was at the 'Varsity----""",play cry come swing bat do much day life remember 
5,"But Hugh John turned away without waiting to hear what happened to Mr. Carling at the 'Varsity which he had honoured with his presence. It chanced, however, that at that moment the young gentleman with the moustache saw on the other side of the enclosure a lady of more mature charms than those of his present companion, whose father also had a great deal of influence--don't you know?--in the county. So in a little while he excused himself and went over to talk with his new friend in her carriage, afterwards driving home with her to ""a quiet family dinner.""",turn wait hear happen honoure presence chance moment young gentleman moustache see other side enclosure lady mature charm present companion father have great deal influence know county little while excuse go talk new friend carriage drive quiet family dinner 
6,"Thus Cissy was left to return alone with Sammy, and she gathered up her sunshade and gloves with an air of calm and surprising dignity. Hugh John had meant to bid her an equally cool good night and stroll off with the worshipful Toady Lion--who that day had kept wickets ""like a jolly little brick"" (as his brother was good enough to say), besides making a useful six before being run out. But somehow, when the hero of the day went to say good-bye, he could not quite carry out his programme, and found himself, against his will, offering in due form to ""see Miss Carter home.""",leave return gather sunshade glove air calm surprising dignity mean bid cool good night stroll worshipful day keep wicket jolly little brick brother good say make useful run hero day go say good bye carry programme find will offer due form see home 
7,"Which shows that Hugh John, like his moustache, was growing up very rapidly indeed, and learning how to adapt himself to circumstances. He wondered what Ashwell Major would say if he knew. It would make him sick, Hugh John thought; but after all, what was a fellow to do?",show moustache grow learn adapt circumstance wonder say know make sick think fellow do 
8,"For the first mile they talked freely about the match, and Cissy complimented him on his scoring. Then there fell a silence and constraint upon them. They were approaching the historic stile. Hugh John nerved himself for a daring venture.",first mile talk match compliment scoring fall silence constraint approach historic stile nerve dare venture 
9,"""Do you remember what you once made me say here, Cissy?"" he said. Miss Carter turned upon him a perfectly well-bred stare of blankest ignorance.",remember make say say turn breed stare blankest ignorance 
10,"""No,"" she said, ""I don't remember ever being here with you before.""",say remember 
11,"""Oh, come, no humbug, Cissy--you could remember very well if you wanted to,"" said Hugh John roughly. As he would have described it himself, ""his monkey was getting up. Cissy had better look out.""",come humbug remember want say describe monkey get look 
12,"He took from his ticket-pocket the piece of the crooked sixpence, which he had kept for more than three years in his schoolbox. ""You don't remember that either, I suppose?"" he said with grave irony.",take ticket pocket piece crooked sixpence keep more year schoolbox remember suppose say grave irony 
13,"Cissy looked at the broken coin calmly--she would have given a great deal if she had had a pincenez or a quizzing-glass to put up at that point. But she did her best without either. Strangely, however, Hugh John was not even irritated.",look break coin give great deal have pincenez quiz glass put point do good irritated 
14,"""No,"" she said at last, ""it looks like half of a sixpence which somebody has stepped upon. How quaint! Did you find it, or did some one give it to you?""",say last look half sixpence step quaint find one give 
15,"They were at the stile now, and Hugh John helped Cissy over. The grown-up swing of her skirt as she tripped down was masterly. It looked so natural. On the other side they both stopped, faced about, and set their elbows on the top almost as they had done three or four years ago when--but so much had happened since then.",stile help grow swing skirt trip masterly look natural other side stop face set elbow top do year much happen 
16,"With even more serenity Hugh John took a small purse out of his pocket. It was exceedingly dusty, as well it might be, for he had picked it out from underneath the specially constructed grandstand at the cricket ground. He opened it quietly, in spite of the unladylike snatch which Cissy made as soon as she recognised it, dropping her youngladyish hauteur in an instant. Hugh John held the dainty purse high up out of her reach, and extracted from an inner compartment a small piece of silver.",more serenity take small purse pocket dusty pick construct grandstand cricket ground open spite unladylike snatch make recognise drop youngladyish hauteur instant hold dainty purse reach extract inner compartment small piece silver

18,"""Give it back to me this moment,"" cried Cissy, who had lost all her reserve, and suddenly grown whole years younger. ""I didn't think any one in the world could be so mean. But I might have known. Do you hear--give it back to me, Hugh John.""",give moment cry lose reserve grow whole year young think one world mean know hear give 
19,With the utmost deliberation he snapped the catch and handed her the purse. The bit of silver he fitted carefully to the first piece he had taken from his ticket-pocket and held them up. They were the reunited halves of the same crooked sixpence.,utmost deliberation snap catch hand purse bit silver fit first piece take ticket pocket hold reunite half same crooked sixpence 
20,Then he looked at Cissy with some of her own former calmness.,look own former calmness 
21,"He even offered her the second fragment of silver, whereupon with a sudden petulant gesture she struck his hand up, and her own half of the crooked sixpence flew into the air, flashed once in the rays of the setting sun, and fell in the middle of the path.",offer second fragment silver sudden petulant gesture strike hand own half crooked sixpence fly air flash ray setting sun fall middle path 
22,Hugh John stood in front of her a moment silent. Then he spoke.,stand front moment silent speak 
23,"""Do you know, Cissy, you are a regular little fraud!""",know regular little fraud 
24,"And with that he suddenly caught the girl in his arms, kissed her once, twice, thrice--and then sprang over the stile, and down towards the river almost as swiftly as Prissy herself. The girl stood a moment speechless with surprise and indignation. Then the tears leaped to her eyes, and she stamped her foot.",catch girl arm kiss spring stile river prissy girl stand moment speechless surprise indignation tear leap eye stamp foot 
25,"""Oh, I hate you, I despise you!"" she cried, putting all her injured pride and anger into the indignant ring of her voice. ""I'll never speak to you again--not as long as I live, Hugh John Smith!""",hate despise cry put injure pride anger indignant ring voice speak live 
26,"And she turned away homeward, holding her head very high in the air. She seemed to be biting her lips to keep back the tears which threatened to overflow her cheeks. But just as she was leaving the stile, curiously enough she cast sharply over her shoulder and all round her the quick shy look of a startled fawn--and stooped to the path. The next moment the bit of silver which had sparkled there was gone, and Cissy Carter, with eyes still moist, but with the sweetest and most wistful smile playing upon her face, was tripping homeward to Oaklands to the tune of ""The Girl I left behind me,"" which she liked to whistle softly when she was sure no one was listening.",turn homeward hold head air seem bite lip keep tear threaten overflow cheek leave stile enough cast shoulder quick shy look startle fawn stoop path next moment bit silver sparkle gone eye moist sweetest wistful smile play face trip tune leave like whistle sure listen
