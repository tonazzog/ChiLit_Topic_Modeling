1,CHAPTER 3. AN UNSAVORY INTERLUDE.,chapter unsavory interlude 
2," It was a maiden aunt of Stalky who sent him both books, with the inscription, “To dearest Artie, on his sixteenth birthday;” it was McTurk who ordered their hypothecation; and it was Beetle, returned from Bideford, who flung them on the window-sill of Number Five study with news that Bastable would advance but ninepence on the two; “Eric; or, Little by Little,” being almost as great a drug as “St. Winifred’s.”  “An’ I don’t think much of your aunt. We’re nearly out of cartridges, too--Artie, dear.”",maiden aunt send book inscription dearest sixteenth birthday order hypothecation return flung window sill study news advance ninepence great drug think much aunt cartridge dear 
3,"Whereupon Stalky rose up to grapple with him, but McTurk sat on Stalky’s head, calling him a “pure-minded boy” till peace was declared. As they were grievously in arrears with a Latin prose, as it was a blazing July afternoon, and as they ought to have been at a house cricket-match, they began to renew their acquaintance, intimate and unholy, with the volumes.",rise grapple sit head call pure minded boy peace declare arrears latin prose blaze afternoon house cricket match begin renew acquaintance intimate unholy volume 
4,"“Here we are!” said McTurk. “‘Corporal punishment produced on Eric the worst effects. He burned _not_ with remorse or regret’--make a note o’ that, Beetle--’ but with shame and violent indignation. He glared’--oh, naughty Eric! Let’s get to where he goes in for drink.”",say corporal punishment produce bad effect burn _not_ remorse regret make note shame violent indignation glare naughty let get go drink 
5,"“Hold on half a shake. Here’s another sample. ‘The Sixth,’ he says, ‘is the palladium of all public schools.’ But this lot--” Stalky rapped the gilded book--“can’t prevent fellows drinkin’ and stealin’, an’ lettin’ fags out of window at night, an’--an’ doin’ what they please. Golly, what we’ve missed--not goin’ to St. Winifred’s!...”",hold shake sample sixth say palladium public school lot rapp gilded book prevent fellow drinkin’ stealin’ fag window night doin’ please miss go

7,"Mr. Prout could move very silently if he pleased, though that is no merit in a boy’s eyes. He had flung open the study-door without knocking--another sin--and looked at them suspiciously. “Very sorry, indeed, I am to see you frowsting in your studies.”",move pleased merit boy eye flung open study door knock sin look sorry see frowst study 
8,"“We’ve been out ever since dinner, sir,” said. McTurk wearily. One house-match is just like another, and their “ploy” of that week happened to be rabbit-shooting with saloon-pistols.",dinner sir say house match ploy week happen rabbit shoot saloon pistol 
9,"“I can’t see a ball when it’s coming, sir,” said Beetle. “I’ve had my gig-lamps smashed at the Nets till I got excused. I wasn’t any good even as a fag, then, sir.”",see ball come sir say have gig lamp smash excuse good fag sir 
10,“Tuck is probably your form. Tuck and brewing. Why can’t you three take any interest in the honor of your house?”,tuck form tuck brewing take interest honor house 
11,"They had heard that phrase till they were wearied. The “honor of the house” was Prout’s weak point, and they knew well how to flick him on the raw.",hear phrase weary honor house weak point know flick raw 
12,"“If you order us to go down, sir, of course we’ll go,” said Stalky, with maddening politeness. But Prout knew better than that. He had tried the experiment once at a big match, when the three, self-isolated, stood to attention for half an hour in full view of all the visitors, to whom fags, subsidized for that end, pointed them out as victims of Prout’s tyranny. And Prout was a sensitive man.",order go sir course go say maddening politeness know good try experiment big match self isolate stand attention hour full view visitor fag subsidize end point victim tyranny sensitive man 
13,"In the infinitely petty confederacies of the Common-room, King and Macrea, fellow house-masters, had borne it in upon him that by games, and games alone, was salvation wrought. Boys neglected were boys lost. They must be disciplined. Left to himself, Prout would have made a sympathetic house-master; but he was never so left, and with the devilish insight of youth, the boys knew to whom they were indebted for his zeal.",petty confederacy common room fellow house master borne game game salvation wring boy neglect boy lose disciplined left make sympathetic house master leave devilish insight youth boy know indebt zeal 
14,"“Must we go down, sir?’ said McTurk.",go sir say

16,“Now what does he suppose is the use of that?” said Beetle.,suppose use say 
17,"“Oh, he’s cracked. King jaws him in Common-room about not keepin’ us up to the mark, an’ Macrea burbles about ‘dithcipline,’ an’ old Heffy sits between ‘em sweatin’ big drops.

They talks over old Prout--what he’ve done an’ left undone about his boys.

23,"“Ah, ha!” said he, turning to show the light of his countenance. “Here we have the ornaments of the Casual House at last. You consider cricket beneath you, I believe “--the crowd, flannelled, sniggered “and from what I have seen this afternoon, I fancy many others of your house hold the same view.

26,"“Five years, sir,” said Beetle hotly.",year sir say 
27,"King scowled. “_One_ of you was that thing called a water-funk. Yes, a water-funk. So now you wish to wash? It is well. Cleanliness never injured a boy or--a house.

34,"“That’s what comes of King’s jawin’ and messin’. Those young animals wouldn’t have thought of it unless he’d put it into their heads. Now they’ll be funny about it for weeks,” said Stalky. “Don’t take any notice.”",come jawin’ messin’ young animal think put head funny week say take notice

37,"When they returned from the baths, damp-headed, languid, at peace with the world, Beetle’s forecast came only too true. They were met in the corridor by a fag--a common, Lower-Second fag--who at arm’s length handed them a carefully wrapped piece of soap “with the compliments of King’s House.”",return bath damp headed languid peace world forecast come true meet corridor fag common lower second fag arm length hand wrap piece soap compliment

41,In a few days it became an established legend of the school that Prout’s house did not wash and were therefore noisome. Mr. King was pleased to smile succulently in form when one of his boys drew aside from Beetle with certain gestures.,few day become establish legend school house wash noisome pleased smile form boy draw certain gesture

Go on, Beetle--from ‘_jugurtha tamen_’--and, if you can, avoid the more flagrant forms of guessing.”",extraordinary extraordinary house have tradition world interfere have prejudice favor washing go avoid flagrant form guess 
45,"Prout’s house was furious because Macrea’s and Hartopp’s houses joined King’s to insult them. They called a house-meeting after dinner--an excited and angry meeting of all save the prefects, whose dignity, though they sympathized, did not allow them to attend. They read ungrammatical resolutions, and made speeches beginning, “Gentlemen, we have met on this occasion,” and ending with, “It’s a beastly shame,”  precisely as houses have done since time and schools began.",house furious house join insult call house meeting dinner excited angry meeting save prefect dignity sympathize allow attend read ungrammatical resolution make speech begin meet occasion end beastly shame house do time school begin

54,"Three saloon-pistols, with a supply of bulleted breech-caps, were stored in Stalky’s trunk, and this trunk was in their dormitory, and their dormitory was a three-bed attic one, opening out of a ten-bed establishment, which, in turn, communicated with the great range of dormitories that ran practically from one end of the College to the other. Macrea’s house lay next to Prout’s, King’s next to Macrea’s, and Hartopp’s beyond that again. Carefully locked doors divided house from house, but each house, in its internal arrangements--the College had originally been a terrace of twelve large houses--was a replica of the next; one straight roof covering all.",saloon pistol supply bullet breech cap store trunk trunk dormitory dormitory bed attic open bed establishment turn communicate great range dormitory run end other house lay lock door divide house house house internal arrangement terrace large house replica next straight roof cover

70,"They crawled in, Stalky leading, drew the door behind them, and on all fours embarked on a dark and dirty road full of plaster, odd shavings, and all the raffle that builders leave in the waste room of a house.

77,"They crawled out, brushed one another clean, slid the saloon-pistols down a trouser-leg, and hurried forth to a deep and solitary Devonshire lane in whose flanks a boy might sometimes slay a young rabbit. They threw themselves down under the rank elder bushes, and began to think aloud.",crawl brush clean slide saloon pistol trouser leg hurry deep solitary lane flank boy slay young rabbit throw rank elder bush begin think

79,"“Huh!” Beetle snorted, choked, and gurgled. He had been silent since they left the dormitory. “Did you ever read a book called ‘The History of a House’ or something?
