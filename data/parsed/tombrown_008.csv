3,"The lower-fourth form, in which Tom found himself at the beginning of the next half-year, was the largest form in the lower school, and numbered upwards of forty boys. Young gentlemen of all ages from nine to fifteen were to be found there, who expended such part of their energies as was devoted to Latin and Greek upon a book of Livy, the “Bucolics”  of Virgil, and the “Hecuba” of Euripides, which were ground out in small daily portions. The driving of this unlucky lower-fourth must have been grievous work to the unfortunate master, for it was the most unhappily constituted of any in the school. Here stuck the great stupid boys, who, for the life of them, could never master the accidence--the objects alternately of mirth and terror to the youngsters, who were daily taking them up and laughing at them in lesson, and getting kicked by them for so doing in play-hours. There were no less than three unhappy fellows in tail coats, with incipient down on their chins, whom the Doctor and the master of the form were always endeavouring to hoist into the upper school, but whose parsing and construing resisted the most well-meant shoves. Then came the mass of the form, boys of eleven and twelve, the most mischievous and reckless age of British youth, of whom East and Tom Brown were fair specimens. As full of tricks as monkeys, and of excuses as Irishwomen, making fun of their master, one another, and their lessons, Argus himself would have been puzzled to keep an eye on them; and as for making them steady or serious for half an hour together, it was simply hopeless. The remainder of the form consisted of young prodigies of nine and ten, who were going up the school at the rate of a form a half-year, all boys’ hands and wits being against them in their progress. It would have been one man’s work to see that the precocious youngsters had fair play; and as the master had a good deal besides to do, they hadn’t, and were for ever being shoved down three or four places, their verses stolen, their books inked, their jackets whitened, and their lives otherwise made a burden to them.",low fourth form find beginning next half year large form low school number upwards boy young gentleman age find expend such part energy devote latin book ground small daily portion driving unlucky low fourth grievous work unfortunate master constitute school stick great stupid boy life master accidence object mirth terror youngster daily take laugh lesson kick do play hour be less unhappy fellow tail coat incipient chin master form endeavour hoist upper school parsing construing resist mean shove come mass form boy mischievous reckless age british youth fair specimen full trick monkey excuse make fun master lesson puzzle keep eye make steady serious hour hopeless remainder form consist young prodigy go school rate form half year boy hand wit progress man work see precocious youngster have fair play master have good deal do shove place verse steal book ink jacket whiten life make burden 
4,"The lower-fourth, and all the forms below it, were heard in the great school, and were not trusted to prepare their lessons before coming in, but were whipped into school three-quarters of an hour before the lesson began by their respective masters, and there, scattered about on the benches, with dictionary and grammar, hammered out their twenty lines of Virgil and Euripides in the midst of babel. The masters of the lower school walked up and down the great school together during this three-quarters of an hour, or sat in their desks reading or looking over copies, and keeping such order as was possible. But the lower-fourth was just now an overgrown form, too large for any one man to attend to properly, and consequently the elysium or ideal form of the young scapegraces who formed the staple of it.",low fourth form hear great school trust prepare lesson come whip school quarter hour lesson begin respective master scatter bench dictionary grammar hammer line midst babel master low school walk great school quarter hour sit desk read look copy keep such order possible low fourth overgrown form large man attend elysium ideal form young scapegrace form staple 
5,"Tom, as has been said, had come up from the third with a good character, but the temptations of the lower-fourth soon proved too strong for him, and he rapidly fell away, and became as unmanageable as the rest. For some weeks, indeed, he succeeded in maintaining the appearance of steadiness, and was looked upon favourably by his new master, whose eyes were first opened by the following little incident.",say come third good character temptation low fourth prove strong fall become unmanageable rest week succeed maintain appearance steadiness look new master eye open follow little incident 
6,"Besides the desk which the master himself occupied, there was another large unoccupied desk in the corner of the great school, which was untenanted. To rush and seize upon this desk, which was ascended by three steps and held four boys, was the great object of ambition of the lower-fourthers; and the contentions for the occupation of it bred such disorder that at last the master forbade its use altogether. This, of course, was a challenge to the more adventurous spirits to occupy it; and as it was capacious enough for two boys to lie hid there completely, it was seldom that it remained empty, notwithstanding the veto. Small holes were cut in the front, through which the occupants watched the masters as they walked up and down; and as lesson time approached, one boy at a time stole out and down the steps, as the masters’ backs were turned, and mingled with the general crowd on the forms below. Tom and East had successfully occupied the desk some half-dozen times, and were grown so reckless that they were in the habit of playing small games with fives balls inside when the masters were at the other end of the big school. One day, as ill-luck would have it, the game became more exciting than usual, and the ball slipped through East’s fingers, and rolled slowly down the steps and out into the middle of the school, just as the masters turned in their walk and faced round upon the desk. The young delinquents watched their master, through the lookout holes, march slowly down the school straight upon their retreat, while all the boys in the neighbourhood, of course, stopped their work to look on; and not only were they ignominiously drawn out, and caned over the hand then and there, but their characters for steadiness were gone from that time. However, as they only shared the fate of some three-fourths of the rest of the form, this did not weigh heavily upon them.",desk master occupy be large unoccupied desk corner great school untenanted rush seize desk ascend step hold boy great object ambition low fourther contention occupation breed such disorder last master forbid use course challenge adventurous spirit occupy capacious boy lie hide seldom remain empty notwithstand veto small hole cut front occupant watch master walk lesson time approach boy time steal step master back turn mingle general crowd form occupy desk half time grow reckless habit play small game fives ball master other end big school day ill luck have game become exciting usual ball slip finger roll step middle school master turn walk face desk young delinquent watch master lookout hole march school retreat boy neighbourhood course stop work look draw cane hand character steadiness gone time share fate fourth rest form weigh 
7,"In fact, the only occasions on which they cared about the matter were the monthly examinations, when the Doctor came round to examine their form, for one long, awful hour, in the work which they had done in the preceding month. The second monthly examination came round soon after Tom’s fall, and it was with anything but lively anticipations that he and the other lower-fourth boys came in to prayers on the morning of the examination day.",fact only occasion care matter monthly examination come examine form long awful hour work do preced month second monthly examination come fall lively anticipation other low fourth boy come prayer morning examination day 
8,"Prayers and calling-over seemed twice as short as usual, and before they could get construes of a tithe of the hard passages marked in the margin of their books, they were all seated round, and the Doctor was standing in the middle, talking in whispers to the master. Tom couldn’t hear a word which passed, and never lifted his eyes from his book; but he knew by a sort of magnetic instinct that the Doctor’s under-lip was coming out, and his eye beginning to burn, and his gown getting gathered up more and more tightly in his left hand. The suspense was agonizing, and Tom knew that he was sure on such occasions to make an example of the School-house boys. “If he would only begin,” thought Tom, “I shouldn’t mind.”",prayer calling seem short usual get construe tithe hard passage mark margin book seat stand middle talk whisper master hear word pass lift eye book know sort magnetic instinct lip come eye begin burn gown gather left hand suspense agonizing know sure such occasion make example house boy begin think mind 
9,"At last the whispering ceased, and the name which was called out was not Brown. He looked up for a moment, but the Doctor’s face was too awful; Tom wouldn’t have met his eye for all he was worth, and buried himself in his book again.",last whispering cease name call look moment face awful meet eye worth bury book 
10,"The boy who was called up first was a clever, merry School-house boy, one of their set; he was some connection of the Doctor’s, and a great favourite, and ran in and out of his house as he liked, and so was selected for the first victim.",boy call clever merry school house boy set connection great favourite run house like select first victim

14,"“Triste lupus, the sorrowful wolf,” he began.",sorrowful wolf begin 
15,"A shudder ran through the whole form, and the Doctor’s wrath fairly boiled over. He made three steps up to the construer, and gave him a good box on the ear. The blow was not a hard one, but the boy was so taken by surprise that he started back; the form caught the back of his knees, and over he went on to the floor behind. There was a dead silence over the whole school. Never before and never again while Tom was at school did the Doctor strike a boy in lesson. The provocation must have been great. However, the victim had saved his form for that occasion, for the Doctor turned to the top bench, and put on the best boys for the rest of the hour and though, at the end of the lesson, he gave them all such a rating as they did not forget, this terrible field-day passed over without any severe visitations in the shape of punishments or floggings. Forty young scapegraces expressed their thanks to the “sorrowful wolf” in their different ways before second lesson.",shudder run whole form wrath boil make step construer give good box ear blow hard one boy take surprise start form catch back knee go floor be dead silence whole school school strike boy lesson provocation great victim save form occasion turn top bench put good boy rest hour end lesson give rating forget terrible field day pass severe visitation shape punishment flogging young scapegrace express thanks sorrowful wolf different way second lesson 
16,"But a character for steadiness once gone is not easily recovered, as Tom found; and for years afterwards he went up the school without it, and the masters’ hands were against him, and his against them. And he regarded them, as a matter of course, as his natural enemies.",character steadiness gone recover find year go school master hand regard matter course natural enemy 
17,"Matters were not so comfortable, either, in the house as they had been; for old Brooke left at Christmas, and one or two others of the sixth-form boys at the following Easter. Their rule had been rough, but strong and just in the main, and a higher standard was beginning to be set up; in fact, there had been a short foretaste of the good time which followed some years later. Just now, however, all threatened to return into darkness and chaos again. For the new praepostors were either small young boys, whose cleverness had carried them up to the top of the school, while in strength of body and character they were not yet fit for a share in the government; or else big fellows of the wrong sort--boys whose friendships and tastes had a downward tendency, who had not caught the meaning of their position and work, and felt none of its responsibilities. So under this no-government the School-house began to see bad times. The big fifth-form boys, who were a sporting and drinking set, soon began to usurp power, and to fag the little boys as if they were praepostors, and to bully and oppress any who showed signs of resistance. The bigger sort of sixth-form boys just described soon made common cause with the fifth, while the smaller sort, hampered by their colleagues’ desertion to the enemy, could not make head against them. So the fags were without their lawful masters and protectors, and ridden over rough-shod by a set of boys whom they were not bound to obey, and whose only right over them stood in their bodily powers; and, as old Brooke had prophesied, the house by degrees broke up into small sets and parties, and lost the strong feeling of fellowship which he set so much store by, and with it much of the prowess in games and the lead in all school matters which he had done so much to keep up.",matter comfortable house old leave other sixth form boy follow rule rough strong main high standard begin set fact be short foretaste good time follow year threaten return darkness chaos new praepostor small young boy cleverness carry top school strength body character fit share government big fellow wrong sort boy friendship taste have downward tendency catch meaning position work feel responsibility government house begin see bad time big fifth form boy sport drinking set begin usurp power fig little boy praepostor bully oppress show sign resistance big sort sixth form boy describe make common cause fifth small sort hamper colleague desertion enemy make head fag lawful master protector ride rough shod set boy bind obey only right stand bodily power old prophesy house degree break small set party lose strong feeling fellowship set much store much prowess game lead school matter do much keep 
18,"In no place in the world has individual character more weight than at a public school. Remember this, I beseech you, all you boys who are getting into the upper forms. Now is the time in all your lives, probably, when you may have more wide influence for good or evil on the society you live in than you ever can have again. Quit yourselves like men, then; speak up, and strike out if necessary, for whatsoever is true, and manly, and lovely, and of good report; never try to be popular, but only to do your duty and help others to do theirs, and you may leave the tone of feeling in the school higher than you found it, and so be doing good which no living soul can measure to generations of your countrymen yet unborn. For boys follow one another in herds like sheep, for good or evil; they hate thinking, and have rarely any settled principles. Every school, indeed, has its own traditionary standard of right and wrong, which cannot be transgressed with impunity, marking certain things as low and blackguard, and certain others as lawful and right. This standard is ever varying, though it changes only slowly and little by little; and, subject only to such standard, it is the leading boys for the time being who give the tone to all the rest, and make the School either a noble institution for the training of Christian Englishmen, or a place where a young boy will get more evil than he would if he were turned out to make his way in London streets, or anything between these two extremes.",place world have individual character more weight public school remember beseech boy get upper form time life have wide influence good evil society live have quit man speak strike necessary true manly lovely good report try popular do duty help other do leave tone feeling school high find do good living soul measure generation countryman unborn boy follow herd sheep good evil hate think have settle principle school have own traditionary standard right wrong transgress impunity mark certain thing low blackguard certain other lawful right standard vary change little little subject such standard lead boy time give tone rest make school noble institution training christian place young boy get more evil turn make way street extreme 
19,"The change for the worse in the School-house, however, didn’t press very heavily on our youngsters for some time. They were in a good bedroom, where slept the only praepostor left who was able to keep thorough order, and their study was in his passage. So, though they were fagged more or less, and occasionally kicked or cuffed by the bullies, they were, on the whole, well off; and the fresh, brave school-life, so full of games, adventures, and good-fellowship, so ready at forgetting, so capacious at enjoying, so bright at forecasting, outweighed a thousand-fold their troubles with the master of their form, and the occasional ill-usage of the big boys in the house. It wasn’t till some year or so after the events recorded above that the praepostor of their room and passage left. None of the other sixth-form boys would move into their passage, and, to the disgust and indignation of Tom and East, one morning after breakfast they were seized upon by Flashman, and made to carry down his books and furniture into the unoccupied study, which he had taken. From this time they began to feel the weight of the tyranny of Flashman and his friends, and, now that trouble had come home to their own doors, began to look out for sympathizers and partners amongst the rest of the fags; and meetings of the oppressed began to be held, and murmurs to arise, and plots to be laid as to how they should free themselves and be avenged on their enemies.",change bad house press youngster time good bedroom sleep only praepostor leave able keep thorough order study passage fagg more kick cuff bully whole fresh brave school life full game adventure good fellowship ready forget capacious enjoy bright forecasting outweigh fold trouble master form occasional ill usage big boy house year event record praepostor room passage leave other sixth form boy move passage disgust indignation morning breakfast seize make carry book furniture unoccupied study take time begin feel weight tyranny friend trouble come own door begin look sympathizer partner rest fag meeting oppress begin hold murmur arise plot lay free avenge enemy 
20,"While matters were in this state, East and Tom were one evening sitting in their study.

37,"“Fa-a-a-ag!” sounded along the passage from Flashman’s study. The two boys looked at one another in silence. It had struck nine, so the regular night-fags had left duty, and they were the nearest to the supper-party. East sat up, and began to look comical, as he always did under difficulties.",ag sound passage study boy look silence strike regular night fag leave duty near supper party sit begin look comical do difficulty

42,"“Trust me for that,” said Tom between his teeth.",trust say tooth

They held their breaths, and heard whispering, of which they only made out Flashman’s words, “I know the young brutes are in.”",minute hear supper party turn come passage door hold breath hear whisper make word know young brute 
44,"Then came summonses to open, which being unanswered, the assault commenced. Luckily the door was a good strong oak one, and resisted the united weight of Flashman’s party. A pause followed, and they heard a besieger remark, “They’re in safe enough. Don’t you see how the door holds at top and bottom? So the bolts must be drawn. We should have forced the lock long ago.” East gave Tom a nudge, to call attention to this scientific remark.",come summonse open unanswered assault commence door good strong oak one resist united weight party pause follow hear besieger remark safe see door hold top bottom bolt draw force lock give nudge call attention scientific remark 
45,"Then came attacks on particular panels, one of which at last gave way to the repeated kicks; but it broke inwards, and the broken pieces got jammed across (the door being lined with green baize), and couldn’t easily be removed from outside: and the besieged, scorning further concealment, strengthened their defences by pressing the end of their sofa against the door. So, after one or two more ineffectual efforts, Flashman and Company retired, vowing vengeance in no mild terms.",come attack particular panel last give way repeat kick break break piece jamm door line green baize remove besiege scorn further concealment strengthen defence press end sofa door more ineffectual effort retire vow vengeance mild term 
46,"The first danger over, it only remained for the besieged to effect a safe retreat, as it was now near bed-time. They listened intently, and heard the supper-party resettle themselves, and then gently drew back first one bolt and then the other. Presently the convivial noises began again steadily. “Now then, stand by for a run,” said East, throwing the door wide open and rushing into the passage, closely followed by Tom. They were too quick to be caught; but Flashman was on the lookout, and sent an empty pickle-jar whizzing after them, which narrowly missed Tom’s head, and broke into twenty pieces at the end of the passage. “He wouldn’t mind killing one, if he wasn’t caught,” said East, as they turned the corner.",first danger remain besiege effect safe retreat bed time listen hear supper party resettle draw first bolt other convivial noise begin stand run say throw door open rush passage follow quick catch lookout send empty pickle jar whizz miss head break piece end passage mind kill catch say turn corner 
47,"There was no pursuit, so the two turned into the hall, where they found a knot of small boys round the fire. Their story was told. The war of independence had broken out. Who would join the revolutionary forces? Several others present bound themselves not to fag for the fifth form at once. One or two only edged off, and left the rebels. What else could they do? “I’ve a good mind to go to the Doctor straight,” said Tom.",be pursuit turn hall find knot small boy fire story tell war independence break join revolutionary force several other present bind fig fifth form edged leave rebel do have good mind go say

51,"“I’ll give you fellows a piece of advice,” said a voice from the end of the hall. They all turned round with a start, and the speaker got up from a bench on which he had been lying unobserved, and gave himself a shake. He was a big, loose-made fellow, with huge limbs which had grown too far through his jacket and trousers. “Don’t you go to anybody at all--you just stand out; say you won’t fag.

58,"The quarter-to-ten bell now rang, and the small boys went off upstairs, still consulting together, and praising their new counsellor, who stretched himself out on the bench before the hall fire again. There he lay, a very queer specimen of boyhood, by name Diggs, and familiarly called “the Mucker.” He was young for his size, and a very clever fellow, nearly at the top of the fifth. His friends at home, having regard, I suppose, to his age, and not to his size and place in the school, hadn’t put him into tails; and even his jackets were always too small; and he had a talent for destroying clothes and making himself look shabby. He wasn’t on terms with Flashman’s set, who sneered at his dress and ways behind his back; which he knew, and revenged himself by asking Flashman the most disagreeable questions, and treating him familiarly whenever a crowd of boys were round him. Neither was he intimate with any of the other bigger boys, who were warned off by his oddnesses, for he was a very queer fellow; besides, amongst other failings, he had that of impecuniosity in a remarkable degree. He brought as much money as other boys to school, but got rid of it in no time, no one knew how; and then, being also reckless, borrowed from any one; and when his debts accumulated and creditors pressed, would have an auction in the hall of everything he possessed in the world, selling even his school-books, candlestick, and study table. For weeks after one of these auctions, having rendered his study uninhabitable, he would live about in the fifth-form room and hall, doing his verses on old letter-backs and odd scraps of paper, and learning his lessons no one knew how. He never meddled with any little boy, and was popular with them, though they all looked on him with a sort of compassion, and called him “Poor Diggs,” not being able to resist appearances, or to disregard wholly even the sneers of their enemy Flashman. However, he seemed equally indifferent to the sneers of big boys and the pity of small ones, and lived his own queer life with much apparent enjoyment to himself. It is necessary to introduce Diggs thus particularly, as he not only did Tom and East good service in their present warfare, as is about to be told, but soon afterwards, when he got into the sixth, chose them for his fags, and excused them from study-fagging, thereby earning unto himself eternal gratitude from them and all who are interested in their history.",quarter bell ring small boy go consult prais new counsellor stretch bench hall fire lay queer specimen boyhood name call young size clever fellow top fifth friend home regard suppose age size place school put tail jacket small have talent destroy clothes make look shabby term set sneer dress way back know revenge ask disagreeable question treat crowd boy intimate other big boy warn oddness queer fellow other failing have impecuniosity remarkable degree bring much money other boy school get rid time know reckless borrow one debt accumulate creditor press have auction hall possess world sell school book candlestick study table week auction render study uninhabitable live fifth form room hall do verse old letter back odd scrap paper learn lesson know meddle little boy popular look sort compassion call poor able resist appearance disregard sneer enemy seem indifferent sneer big boy pity small one live own queer life much apparent enjoyment necessary introduce do good service present warfare about tell get sixth choose fag excuse study fagging earn eternal gratitude interested history 
59,"And seldom had small boys more need of a friend, for the morning after the siege the storm burst upon the rebels in all its violence. Flashman laid wait, and caught Tom before second lesson, and receiving a point-blank “No” when told to fetch his hat, seized him and twisted his arm, and went through the other methods of torture in use. “He couldn’t make me cry, though,” as Tom said triumphantly to the rest of the rebels; “and I kicked his shins well, I know.” And soon it crept out that a lot of the fags were in league, and Flashman excited his associates to join him in bringing the young vagabonds to their senses; and the house was filled with constant chasings, and sieges, and lickings of all sorts; and in return, the bullies’ beds were pulled to pieces and drenched with water, and their names written up on the walls with every insulting epithet which the fag invention could furnish. The war, in short, raged fiercely; but soon, as Diggs had told them, all the better fellows in the fifth gave up trying to fag them, and public feeling began to set against Flashman and his two or three intimates, and they were obliged to keep their doings more secret, but being thorough bad fellows, missed no opportunity of torturing in private. Flashman was an adept in all ways, but above all in the power of saying cutting and cruel things, and could often bring tears to the eyes of boys in this way, which all the thrashings in the world wouldn’t have wrung from them.",have small boy more need friend morning siege storm burst rebel violence lay wait catch second lesson receive point blank tell fetch hat seize twist arm go other method torture use make cry say rest rebel kick shin know creep lot fag league excite associate join bring young vagabond sense house fill constant chasing siege licking sort return bully bed pull piece drench water name write wall insulting epithet fag invention furnish war short rage tell good fellow fifth give try fig public feeling begin set intimate oblige keep doing secret thorough bad fellow miss opportunity torture private adept way power say cut cruel thing bring tear eye boy way thrashing world wrung 
60,"And as his operations were being cut short in other directions, he now devoted himself chiefly to Tom and East, who lived at his own door, and would force himself into their study whenever he found a chance, and sit there, sometimes alone, and sometimes with a companion, interrupting all their work, and exulting in the evident pain which every now and then he could see he was inflicting on one or the other.",operation cut short other direction devote live own door force study find chance sit alone companion interrupt work exult evident pain see inflict other 
61,"The storm had cleared the air for the rest of the house, and a better state of things now began than there had been since old Brooke had left; but an angry, dark spot of thunder-cloud still hung over the end of the passage where Flashman’s study and that of East and Tom lay.",storm clear air rest house good state thing begin be old leave angry dark spot thunder cloud hang end passage study lay 
62,"He felt that they had been the first rebels, and that the rebellion had been to a great extent successful; but what above all stirred the hatred and bitterness of his heart against them was that in the frequent collisions which there had been of late they had openly called him coward and sneak. The taunts were too true to be forgiven. While he was in the act of thrashing them, they would roar out instances of his funking at football, or shirking some encounter with a lout of half his own size. These things were all well enough known in the house, but to have his own disgrace shouted out by small boys, to feel that they despised him, to be unable to silence them by any amount of torture, and to see the open laugh and sneer of his own associates (who were looking on, and took no trouble to hide their scorn from him, though they neither interfered with his bullying nor lived a bit the less intimately with him), made him beside himself. Come what might, he would make those boys’ lives miserable. So the strife settled down into a personal affair between Flashman and our youngsters--a war to the knife, to be fought out in the little cockpit at the end of the bottom passage.",feel first rebel rebellion great extent successful stirr hatred bitterness heart frequent collision be late call coward sneak taunt true forgive act thrash roar instance funking football shirk encounter lout own size thing know house have own disgrace shout small boy feel despise unable silence amount torture see open laugh sneer own associate look take trouble hide scorn interfer bullying live bit make come make boy life miserable strife settle personal affair youngster war knife fight little cockpit end bottom passage 
63,"Flashman, be it said, was about seventeen years old, and big and strong of his age. He played well at all games where pluck wasn’t much wanted, and managed generally to keep up appearances where it was; and having a bluff, off-hand manner, which passed for heartiness, and considerable powers of being pleasant when he liked, went down with the school in general for a good fellow enough. Even in the School-house, by dint of his command of money, the constant supply of good things which he kept up, and his adroit toadyism, he had managed to make himself not only tolerated, but rather popular amongst his own contemporaries; although young Brooke scarcely spoke to him, and one or two others of the right sort showed their opinions of him whenever a chance offered. But the wrong sort happened to be in the ascendant just now, and so Flashman was a formidable enemy for small boys. This soon became plain enough. Flashman left no slander unspoken, and no deed undone, which could in any way hurt his victims, or isolate them from the rest of the house. One by one most of the other rebels fell away from them, while Flashman’s cause prospered, and several other fifth-form boys began to look black at them and ill-treat them as they passed about the house. By keeping out of bounds, or at all events out of the house and quadrangle, all day, and carefully barring themselves in at night, East and Tom managed to hold on without feeling very miserable; but it was as much as they could do. Greatly were they drawn then towards old Diggs, who, in an uncouth way, began to take a good deal of notice of them, and once or twice came to their study when Flashman was there, who immediately decamped in consequence. The boys thought that Diggs must have been watching.",say year old big strong age play game pluck want manage keep appearance have bluff hand manner pass heartiness considerable power pleasant like go school general good fellow house dint command money constant supply good thing keep adroit toadyism manage make tolerate popular own contemporary young speak other right sort show opinion chance offer wrong sort happen ascendant formidable enemy small boy become plain leave slander unspoken deed undone way hurt victim isolate rest house most other rebel fall cause prosper several other fifth form boy begin look black ill treat pass house keep bound event house quadrangle day barr night manage hold feel miserable much do draw old uncouth way begin take good deal notice come study decamp consequence boy think watch 
64,"When therefore, about this time, an auction was one night announced to take place in the hall, at which, amongst the superfluities of other boys, all Diggs’s penates for the time being were going to the hammer, East and Tom laid their heads together, and resolved to devote their ready cash (some four shillings sterling) to redeem such articles as that sum would cover. Accordingly, they duly attended to bid, and Tom became the owner of two lots of Diggs’s things:--Lot 1, price one-and-threepence, consisting (as the auctioneer remarked) of a “valuable assortment of old metals,” in the shape of a mouse-trap, a cheese-toaster without a handle, and a saucepan: Lot 2, of a villainous dirty table-cloth and green-baize curtain; while East, for one-and-sixpence, purchased a leather paper-case, with a lock but no key, once handsome, but now much the worse for wear. But they had still the point to settle of how to get Diggs to take the things without hurting his feelings. This they solved by leaving them in his study, which was never locked when he was out. Diggs, who had attended the auction, remembered who had bought the lots, and came to their study soon after, and sat silent for some time, cracking his great red finger-joints. Then he laid hold of their verses, and began looking over and altering them, and at last got up, and turning his back to them, said, “You’re uncommon good-hearted little beggars, you two. I value that paper-case; my sister gave it to me last holidays. I won’t forget.” And so he tumbled out into the passage, leaving them somewhat embarrassed, but not sorry that he knew what they had done.",time auction night announce take place hall superfluity other boy penate time being go hammer lay head resolve devote ready cash shilling sterling redeem such article sum cover attend bid become owner lot thing lot price threepence consist auctioneer remark valuable assortment old metal shape mouse trap cheese toaster handle saucepan lot villainous dirty table cloth green baize curtain sixpence purchase leather paper case lock key handsome bad wear have point settle get take thing hurt feeling solve leave study lock attend auction remember buy lot come study sit silent time crack great red finger joint lay hold verse begin look alter last get turn back say uncommon good hearted little beggar value paper case sister give last holiday forget tumble passage leave embarrass sorry know do 
65,"The next morning was Saturday, the day on which the allowances of one shilling a week were paid--an important event to spendthrift youngsters; and great was the disgust amongst the small fry to hear that all the allowances had been impounded for the Derby lottery. That great event in the English year, the Derby, was celebrated at Rugby in those days by many lotteries. It was not an improving custom, I own, gentle reader, and led to making books, and betting, and other objectionable results; but when our great Houses of Palaver think it right to stop the nation’s business on that day and many of the members bet heavily themselves, can you blame us boys for following the example of our betters? At any rate we did follow it. First there was the great school lottery, where the first prize was six or seven pounds; then each house had one or more separate lotteries. These were all nominally voluntary, no boy being compelled to put in his shilling who didn’t choose to do so. But besides Flashman, there were three or four other fast, sporting young gentlemen in the Schoolhouse, who considered subscription a matter of duty and necessity; and so, to make their duty come easy to the small boys, quietly secured the allowances in a lump when given out for distribution, and kept them. It was no use grumbling--so many fewer tartlets and apples were eaten and fives balls bought on that Saturday; and after locking-up, when the money would otherwise have been spent, consolation was carried to many a small boy by the sound of the night-fags shouting along the passages, “Gentlemen sportsmen of the School-house; the lottery’s going to be drawn in the hall.” It was pleasant to be called a gentleman sportsman, also to have a chance of drawing a favourite horse.",next morning day allowance shilling week pay important event spendthrift youngster great disgust small fry hear allowance impound lottery great event english year celebrate day many lottery improve custom own gentle reader lead make book betting other objectionable result great house think right stop nation business day many member bet blame boy follow example better rate follow be great school lottery first prize pound house have more separate lottery voluntary boy compel put shilling choose do be other fast sport young gentleman consider subscription matter duty necessity make duty come easy small boy secure allowance lump give distribution keep use grumble many few tartlet apple eat fives ball buy lock money spend consolation carry many small boy sound night fag shouting passage sportsmen house lottery go draw hall pleasant call gentleman sportsman have chance draw favourite horse 
66,"The hall was full of boys, and at the head of one of the long tables stood the sporting interest, with a hat before them, in which were the tickets folded up. One of them then began calling out the list of the house. Each boy as his name was called drew a ticket from the hat, and opened it; and most of the bigger boys, after drawing, left the hall directly to go back to their studies or the fifth-form room. The sporting interest had all drawn blanks, and they were sulky accordingly; neither of the favourites had yet been drawn, and it had come down to the upper-fourth. So now, as each small boy came up and drew his ticket, it was seized and opened by Flashman, or some other of the standers-by. But no great favourite is drawn until it comes to the Tadpole’s turn, and he shuffles up and draws, and tries to make off, but is caught, and his ticket is opened like the rest.",hall full boy head long table stand sport interest hat ticket fold begin call list house boy name call draw ticket hat open most big boy draw leave hall go study fifth form room sport interest draw blank sulky favourite draw come upper fourth small boy come draw ticket seize open other stander great favourite draw come turn shuffle draw try make catch ticket open rest

Now, I’ll give you half a crown for him.” Tadpole holds out, but between threats and cajoleries at length sells half for one shilling and sixpence--about a fifth of its fair market value; however, he is glad to realize anything, and, as he wisely remarks, “Wanderer mayn’t win, and the tizzy is safe anyhow.”",listen young fool know horse use win want hedge give crown hold threat cajolery length sell half shilling sixpence fifth fair market value glad realize remark win tizzy safe 
72,"East presently comes up and draws a blank. Soon after comes Tom’s turn.

74,"“Wouldn’t you like it?” replies the opener, not a bad fellow at the bottom, and no admirer of Flashman. “Here, Brown, catch hold.” And he hands the ticket to Tom, who pockets it. Whereupon Flashman makes for the door at once, that Tom and the ticket may not escape, and there keeps watch until the drawing is over and all the boys are gone, except the sporting set of five or six, who stay to compare books, make bets, and so on; Tom, who doesn’t choose to move while Flashman is at the door; and East, who stays by his friend, anticipating trouble. The sporting set now gathered round Tom. Public opinion wouldn’t allow them actually to rob him of his ticket, but any humbug or intimidation by which he could be driven to sell the whole or part at an undervalue was lawful.",like reply opener bad fellow bottom admirer catch hold hand ticket pocket make door ticket escape keep watch draw boy gone sport set stay compare book make bet choose move door stay friend anticipate trouble sport set gather public opinion allow rob ticket humbug intimidation drive sell whole part undervalue lawful

Tom, remembering his good deed, and moreover in his forlorn state wishing to make a friend, is about to accept the offer, when another cries out, “I’ll give you seven shillings.” Tom hesitated and looked from one to the other.",young come sell hear go start give shilling begin boy open ticket remember good deed forlorn state wish make friend about accept offer cry give shilling hesitate look other

82,"“Very well then; let’s roast him,” cried Flashman, and catches hold of Tom by the collar. One or two boys hesitate, but the rest join in. East seizes Tom’s arm, and tries to pull him away, but is knocked back by one of the boys, and Tom is dragged along struggling. His shoulders are pushed against the mantelpiece, and he is held by main force before the fire, Flashman drawing his trousers tight by way of extra torture. Poor East, in more pain even than Tom, suddenly thinks of Diggs, and darts off to find him. “Will you sell now for ten shillings?” says one boy who is relenting.",let roast cry catch hold collar boy hesitate rest join seize arm try pull knock boy drag struggle shoulder push mantelpiece hold main force fire draw trousers tight way extra torture poor more pain think dart find sell shilling say boy relent

Water comes, and they throw it on his hands and face, and he begins to come to. “Mother!”--the words came feebly and slowly--“it’s very cold to-night.” Poor old Diggs is blubbering like a child. “Where am I?” goes on Tom, opening his eyes, “Ah!

At first he feels broken, and thinks of writing home and getting taken away; and the verse of a hymn he had learned years ago sings through his head, and he goes to sleep, murmuring,--",back leg answer scorch part trousers burn bed cold bandage first feel break think write home take verse hymn learn year sing head go sleep murmure
