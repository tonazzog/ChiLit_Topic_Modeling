2," ERMENTRUDE VON ADLERSTEIN slept with her forefathers in the vaults of the hermitage chapel, and Christina Sorel’s work was done.",sleep forefather vault hermitage chapel work do 
3,"Surely it was time for her to return home, though she should be more sorry to leave the mountain castle than she could ever have believed possible.  She entreated her father to take her home, but she received a sharp answer that she did not know what she was talking of: the Schlangenwald Reitern were besetting all the roads; and moreover the Ulm burghers had taken the capture of the Constance wine in such dudgeon that for a retainer of Adlerstein to show himself in the streets would be an absolute asking for the wheel.",time return sorry leave mountain castle believe possible entreat father take home receive sharp answer know talk besett road burgher take capture wine such dudgeon retainer show street absolute ask wheel 
4,"But was there any hope for her?  Could he not take her to some nunnery midway, and let her write to her uncle to fetch her from thence?",be hope take nunnery let write uncle fetch thence 
5,"He swore at woman’s pertinacity, but allowed at last that if the plan, talked of by the Barons, of going to make their submission to the Emperor at Linz, with a view to which all violence at the ford had ceased, should hold good, it might be possible thus to drop her on their way.",swore woman pertinacity allow last plan talk go make submission view violence ford cease hold good possible drop way 
6,"With this Christina must needs content herself.  Poor child, not only had Ermentrude’s death deprived her of the sole object of her residence at Schloss Adlerstein, but it had infinitely increased the difficulties of her position.  No one interfered with her possession of the upper room and its turrets; and it was only at meal times that she was obliged to mingle with the other inhabitants, who, for the most part, absolutely overlooked the little shrinking pale maiden but with one exception, and that the most perplexing of all.  She had been on terms with Freiherr Eberhard that were not so easily broken off as if she had been an old woman of Ursel’s age.  All through his sister’s decline she had been his comforter, assistant, director, living in intercourse and sympathy that ought surely to cease when she was no longer his sister’s attendant, yet which must be more than ever missed in the full freshness of the stroke.",need content poor child have death deprive sole object residence increase difficulty position interfer possession upper room turret meal time oblige mingle other inhabitant most part overlook little shrink pale maiden exception perplexing term break old woman age sister decline comforter assistant director live intercourse sympathy cease sister attendant more miss full freshness stroke 
7,"Even on the earliest day of bereavement, a sudden thought of Hausfrau Johanna flashed upon Christina, and reminded her of the guard she must keep over herself if she would return to Ulm the same modest girl whom her aunt could acquit of all indiscretion.  Her cheeks flamed, as she sat alone, with the very thought, and the next time she heard the well-known tread on the stair, she fled hastily into her own turret chamber, and shut the door.  Her heart beat fast.  She could hear Sir Eberhard moving about the room, and listened to his heavy sigh as he threw himself into the large chair.  Presently he called her by name, and she felt it needful to open her door and answer, respectfully,",early day bereavement sudden thought flash remind guard keep return same modest girl aunt acquit indiscretion cheek flame sit very thought next time hear know tread stair flead own turret chamber shut door heart beat hear move room listen heavy sigh throw large chair call name feel needful open door answer 
8,"“What would you, my lord?”",lord 
9,"“What would I?  A little peace, and heed to her who is gone.  To see my father and mother one would think that a partridge had but flown away.  I have seen my father more sorrowful when his dog had fallen over the abyss.”",little peace heed gone see father mother think partridge fly see father sorrowful dog fall abyss 
10,"“Mayhap there is more sorrow for a brute that cannot live again,” said Christina.  “Our bird has her nest by an Altar that is lovelier and brighter than even our Dome Kirk will ever be.”",be more sorrow brute live say bird have nest lovely bright 
11,"“Sit down, Christina,” he said, dragging a chair nearer the hearth.  “My heart is sore, and I cannot bear the din below.  Tell me where my bird is flown.”",sit say drag chair hearth heart sore bear din tell bird fly 
12,"“Ah! sir; pardon me.  I must to the kitchen,” said Christina, crossing her hands over her breast, to still her trembling heart, for she was very sorry for his grief, but moving resolutely.",sir pardon kitchen say cross hand breast tremble heart sorry grief move 
13,“Must?  And wherefore?  Thou hast nought to do there; speak truth!  Why not stay with me?” and his great light eyes opened wide.,nought do speak truth stay great light eye open wide 
14,“A burgher maid may not sit down with a noble baron.”,burgher maid sit noble baron 
15,"“The devil!  Has my mother been plaguing thee, child?”",mother plague child 
16,"“No, my lord,” said Christina, “she reeks not of me; but”—steadying her voice with great difficulty—“it behoves me the more to be discreet.”",lord say reek steady voice great difficulty behove more discreet 
17,"“And you would not have me come here!” he said, with a wistful tone of reproach.",have come say wistful tone reproach 
18,"“I have no power to forbid you; but if you do, I must betake me to Ursel in the kitchen,” said Christina, very low, trembling and half choked.",have power forbid betake kitchen say low tremble half choke 
19,"“Among the rude wenches there!” he cried, starting up.  “Nay, nay, that shall not be!  Rather will I go.”",rude wenche cry start go 
20,"“But this is very cruel of thee, maiden,” he added, lingering, “when I give thee my knightly word that all should be as when she whom we both loved was here,” and his voice shook.",cruel maiden add linger give knightly word love voice shake 
21,"“It could not so be, my lord,” returned Christina with drooping, blushing face; “it would not be maidenly in me.  Oh, my lord, you are kind and generous, make it not hard for me to do what other maidens less lonely have friends to do for them!”",lord return droop blush face lord kind generous make hard do other maiden lonely have friend do 
22,"“Kind and generous?” said Eberhard, leaning over the back of the chair as if trying to begin a fresh score.  “This from you, who told me once I was no true knight!”",kind generous say lean back chair try begin fresh score tell true knight 
23,"“I shall call you a true knight with all my heart,” cried Christina, the tears rushing into her eyes, “if you will respect my weakness and loneliness.”",call true knight heart cry tear rush eye respect weakness loneliness 
24,"He stood up again, as if to move away; then paused, and, twisting his gold chain, said, “And how am I ever to be what the happy one bade me, if you will not show me how?”",stand move pause twist gold chain say happy one bid show 
25,"“My error would never show you the right,” said Christina, with a strong effort at firmness, and retreating at once through the door of the staircase, whence she made her way to the kitchen, and with great difficulty found an excuse for her presence there.",error show right say strong effort firmness retreat door staircase make way kitchen great difficulty find excuse presence 
26,"It had been a hard struggle with her compassion and gratitude, and, poor little Christina felt with dismay, with something more than these.  Else why was it that, even while principle and better sense summoned her back to Ulm, she experienced a deadly weariness of the city-pent air, of the grave, heavy roll of the river, nay, even of the quiet, well-regulated household?  Why did such a marriage as she had thought her natural destiny, with some worthy, kind-hearted brother of the guild, become so hateful to her that she could only aspire to a convent life?  This same burgomaster would be an estimable man, no doubt, and those around her were ruffians, but she felt utterly contemptuous and impatient of him. And why was the interchange of greetings, the few words at meals, worth all the rest of the day besides to her?  Her own heart was the traitor, and to her own sensations the poor little thing had, in spirit at least, transgressed all Aunt Johanna’s precepts against young Barons.  She wept apart, and resolved, and prayed, cruelly ashamed of every start of joy or pain that the sight of Eberhard cost her.  From almost the first he had sat next her at the single table that accommodated the whole household at meals, and the custom continued, though on some days he treated her with sullen silence, which she blamed herself for not rejoicing in, sometimes he spoke a few friendly words; but he observed, better than she could have dared to expect, her test of his true knighthood, and never again forced himself into her apartment, though now and then he came to the door with flowers, with mountain strawberries, and once with two young doves.  “Take them, Christina,” he said, “they are very like yourself;” and he always delayed so long that she was forced to be resolute, and shut the door on him at last.",hard struggle compassion gratitude poor little feel dismay more principle good sense summon experience deadly weariness city pent air grave heavy roll river quiet regulate household do marriage think natural destiny worthy kind hearted brother guild become hateful aspire convent life same burgomaster estimable man doubt ruffian feel contemptuous impatient interchange greeting few word meal worth rest day own heart traitor own sensation poor little thing spirit least transgress precept young goot resolve pray ashamed start joy pain sight cost first sit single table accommodate whole household meal custom continue day treat sullen silence blame rejoice speak few friendly word observe good dare expect test true knighthood force apartment come door flower mountain strawberry young dove take say delay force resolute shut door last 
27,"Once, when there was to be a mass at the chapel, Hugh Sorel, between a smile and a growl, informed his daughter that he would take her thereto. She gladly prepared, and, bent on making herself agreeable to her father, did not once press on him the necessity of her return to Ulm.  To her amazement and pleasure, the young Baron was at church, and when on the way home, he walked beside her mule, she could see no need of sending him away.",be mass chapel smile growl inform daughter take prepare bend make agreeable father press necessity return amazement pleasure young church way walk mule see need send 
28,"He had been in no school of the conventionalities of life, and, when he saw that Hugh Sorel’s presence had obtained him this favour, he wistfully asked, “Christina, if I bring your father with me, will you not let me in?”",school conventionality life see presence obtain favour ask bring father let 
29,"“Entreat me not, my lord,” she answered, with fluttering breath.",entreat lord answer flutter breath 
30,"She felt the more that she was right in this decision, when she encountered her father’s broad grin of surprise and diversion, at seeing the young Baron help her to dismount.  It was a look of receiving an idea both new, comical, and flattering, but by no means the look of a father who would resent the indignity of attentions to his daughter from a man whose rank formed an insuperable barrier to marriage.",feel more right decision encounter father broad grin surprise diversion see young help dismount look receive idea new comical flattering mean look father resent indignity attention daughter man rank form insuperable barrier marriage 
31,"The effect was a new, urgent, and most piteous entreaty, that he would find means of sending her home.  It brought upon her the hearing put into words what her own feelings had long shrunk from confessing to herself.",effect new urgent piteous entreaty find means send home bring hearing put word own feeling shrink confess 
32,"“Ah!  Why, what now?  What, is the young Baron after thee?  Ha! ha! petticoats are few enough up here, but he must have been ill off ere he took to a little ghost like thee!  I saw he was moping and doleful, but I thought it was all for his sister.”",young ha! petticoat few ill take little ghost see mope doleful think sister 
33,"“And so it is, father.”",father 
34,"“Tell me that, when he watches every turn of that dark eye of thine—the only good thing thou took’st of mine!  Thou art a witch, Stina.”",tell watch turn dark eye only good thing took’st art witch 
35,"“Hush, oh hush, for pity’s sake, father, and let me go home!”",pity sake father let go 
36,"“What, thou likest him not?  Thy mind is all for the mincing goldsmith opposite, as I ever told thee.”",likest mind mincing goldsmith opposite tell 
37,"“My mind is—is to return to my uncle and aunt the true-hearted maiden they parted with,” said Christina, with clasped hands.  “And oh, father, as you were the son of a true and faithful mother, be a father to me now! Jeer not your motherless child, but protect her and help her.”",mind return uncle aunt true hearted maiden part say clasp hand father son true faithful mother father jeer motherless child protect help 
38,"Hugh Sorel was touched by this appeal, and he likewise recollected how much it was for his own interest that his brother should be satisfied with the care he took of his daughter.  He became convinced that the sooner she was out of the castle the better, and at length bethought him that, among the merchants who frequented the Midsummer Fair at the Blessed Friedmund’s Wake, a safe escort might be found to convey her back to Ulm.",touch appeal recollect much own interest brother satisfy care take daughter become convince castle good length bethough merchant frequent blessed safe escort find convey 
39,"If the truth were known, Hugh Sorel was not devoid of a certain feeling akin to contempt, both for his young master’s taste, and for his forbearance in not having pushed matters further with a being so helpless, meek, and timid as Christina, more especially as such slackness had not been his wont in other cases where his fancy had been caught.",truth know devoid certain feeling akin contempt young master taste forbearance push matter helpless meek timid such slackness wont other case fancy catch 
40,"But Sorel did not understand that it was not physical beauty that here had been the attraction, though to some persons, the sweet, pensive eyes, the delicate, pure skin, the slight, tender form, might seem to exceed in loveliness the fully developed animal comeliness chiefly esteemed at Adlerstein.  It was rather the strangeness of the power and purity of this timid, fragile creature, that had struck the young noble.  With all their brutal manners reverence for a lofty female nature had been in the German character ever since their Velleda prophesied to them, and this reverence in Eberhard bowed at the feet of the pure gentle maiden, so strong yet so weak, so wistful and entreating even in her resolution, refined as a white flower on a heap of refuse, wise and dexterous beyond his slow and dull conception, and the first being in whom he had ever seen piety or goodness; and likewise with a tender, loving spirit of consolation such as he had both beheld and tasted by his sister’s deathbed.",understand physical beauty attraction person sweet pensive eye delicate pure skin slight tender form seem exceed loveliness develop animal comeliness esteem strangeness power purity timid fragile creature strike young noble brutal manners reverence lofty female nature german character prophesy reverence bow foot pure gentle maiden strong weak wistful entreat resolution refine white flower heap refuse wise dexterous slow dull conception first see piety goodness tender loving spirit consolation such beheld taste sister deathbed 
41,"There was almost a fear mingled with his reverence.  If he had been more familiar with the saints, he would thus have regarded the holy virgin martyrs, nay, even Our Lady herself; and he durst not push her so hard as to offend her, and excite the anger or the grief that he alike dreaded. He was wretched and forlorn without the resources he had found in his sister’s room; the new and better cravings of his higher nature had been excited only to remain unsupplied and disappointed; and the affectionate heart in the freshness of its sorrow yearned for the comfort that such conversation had supplied: but the impression that had been made on him was still such, that he knew that to use rough means of pressing his wishes would no more lead to his real gratification than it would to appropriate a snow-bell by crushing it in his gauntlet.",be fear mingle reverence familiar saint regard holy virgin martyr push offend excite anger grief dread wretch forlorn resource find sister room new good craving high nature excite remain unsupplied disappoint affectionate heart freshness sorrow yearn comfort such conversation supply impression make such know use rough means press wish lead real gratification appropriate snow bell crush gauntlet 
42,"And it was on feeble little Christina, yielding in heart, though not in will, that it depended to preserve this reverence, and return unscathed from this castle, more perilous now than ever.",feeble little yield heart will depend preserve reverence return unscathed castle perilous
