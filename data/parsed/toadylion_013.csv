1,CHAPTER XIII. THE ARMY OF WINDY STANDARD.,army windy 
2," At last, however, all was ready, in the historical phrase of Napoleon the Little, ""to the last gaiter-button.""",last ready historical phrase last gaiter button 
3,"It was the intention of the Commander-in-Chief to attack the citadel of the enemy with banners flying, and after due notice. He had been practising for days upon his three-key bugle in order to give the call of Childe Roland. But Private Sammy Carter, who was always sticking his oar in, put him upon wiser lines, and (what is more) did it so quietly and suggestively that General Napoleon was soon convinced that Sammy's plan was his own, and on the second day boasted of its merits to its original begetter, who did not even smile. The like has happened in greater armies with generals as distinguished.",intention attack citadel enemy banner fly due notice practise day key bugle order give call private stick oar put wise line more do convince plan own second day boast merit original begetter smile like happen great army general distinguished 
4,"Sammy Carter advised that the assault should be delivered between eight and nine in the morning, for the very good reasons that at that hour both the butcher's apprentice, Tommy Pratt, and the slaughterman would be busy delivering the forenoon orders, while the butcher's son, Nipper Donnan, would be at school, and the Black Sheds consequently entirely deserted.",advise assault deliver morning good reason hour butcher apprentice slaughterman busy deliver forenoon order butcher son school black desert 
5,"At first Hugh John rebelled, and asserted that this was not a sportsmanlike mode of proceeding, but Sammy Carter, who always knew more about everything than was good for anybody, overwhelmed his chief with examples of strategies and surprises from the military history of thirty centuries.",first rebell assert sportsmanlike mode proceeding know more good overwhelm chief example strategy surprise military history century 
6,"""Besides,"" said he, somewhat pertinently, ""let's get Donald back first, and then we can be chivalrous all you want. Perhaps they are keeping him to fatten him up for the Odd Coons' Bank Holiday Feast.""",say let get chivalrous want keep fatten odd 
7,"This, as the wily Sammy knew, was calculated to stir up the wrath of his general more than anything else he could say. For at the annual Bean Feast of the Honourable Company of Odd Coons, a benefit secret society of convivial habits, a sheep was annually roasted whole. It said an ox on the programme, but the actual result, curiously enough, was mutton and not beef.",wily know calculate stir wrath general more else say annual honourable odd benefit secret society convivial habit sheep roast whole say ox programme actual result mutton beef 
8,"""We attack to-morrow at daybreak,"" said Field-Marshal Smith grandly, as soon as Sammy Carter had finished speaking.",attack daybreak say finish speak 
9,"This, however, had subsequently to be modified to nine o'clock, to suit the breakfast hour of the Carters. Moreover Saturday was substituted for Tuesday, both because Cissy and Sammy could most easily ""shirk"" their governess on that day, and because Mr. Picton Smith was known to be going up to London by the night train on Friday.",have modify o'clock suit breakfast hour substitute shirk governess day know go night train

11,"When the army was finally mustered for the assault, its armament was found to be somewhat varied, though generally efficient. But then even in larger armies the weapons of the different arms of the service are far from uniform. There are, for example, rifles and bayonets for the Line, lances for the Light Horse, carbines, sabres, and army biscuits, all deadly after their kind.",army muster assault armament find varied efficient large army weapon different arm service uniform be example rifle bayonet lance light carbine sabre army biscuit deadly kind 
12,"So it was in the campaigning outfit of the forces of Windy Standard. The historian can only hint at this equipment, so strange were the various kits. The Commander-in-Chief wished to insist on a red sash and a long cut-and-thrust sword, with (if possible) a kettle-drum. But this was found impracticable as a general order. For not only did the two divisional commanders decline to submit to the sash, but there were not enough kettle-drums intact to go more than half round.",campaigning outfit force windy historian hint equipment strange various kit wish insist red sash long cut thrust sword possible kettle drum find impracticable general order divisional commander decline submit sash be enough kettle drum intact go more half 
13,"So General Smith was the only soldier who carried a real sword. He had also a pistol, which, however, obstinately refused to go off, but formed a valuable weapon when held by the barrel. Cissy was furnished with a pike, constructed by Prince Michael's father, the dethroned monarch of O'Donowitch-dom, out of a leister or fish-spear--which, strangely enough, he had carried away with him from his palace at the time of his exile. This constituted a really formidable armament, being at least five feet long, and so sharp that if you ran very hard against a soft wooden door with it, it made a mark which you could see quite a yard off in a good light.",only soldier carry real sword have pistol refuse go form valuable weapon hold barrel furnish pike construct father dethron monarch leister fish spear carry palace time exile constitute formidable armament least foot long sharp run soft wooden door make mark see yard good light 
14,"Prissy had a carpet-broom with a long handle, which at a distance looked like a gun, and as Prissy meant to do all her fighting at a distance this was quite sufficient. In addition she had three pieces of twine to tie up her dress, so that she would be ready to run away untrammelled by flapping skirts. Sir Toady Lion was equipped for war with a thimble, three sticky bull's-eyes, the haft of a knife (but no blade), a dog-whistle, and a go-cart with one shaft, all of which proved exceedingly useful.",prissy have carpet broom long handle distance look gun mean do fight distance sufficient addition have piece twine tie dress ready run untrammell flap skirt equip war thimble sticky bull eye haft knife blade dog whistle go cart shaft prove useful 
15,"The two Generals of Division were attired in neat stable clothes with buttoned leggings, and put their trust in a pair of ""catties"" (otherwise known as catapults), two stout shillelahs, the national batons of the exiled prince, manufactured by himself; and, most valuable of all, a set a-piece of horny knuckles, which they had kept in constant practice against each other all through the piping times of peace. Both Mike and Peter knowingly chewed straws in opposite corners of their mouths.",generals division attire neat stable clothes button legging put trust pair catty know catapult stout shillelah national baton exile prince manufacture valuable set piece horny knuckle keep constant practice other piping time peace chew straw opposite corner mouth 
16,"The forces on the other side were quite unknown, both as to number and quality. Hugh John maintained that there were at least twenty, and Toady Lion stoutly proclaimed that there were a million thousand, and that he had seen and counted them every one. But a stricter census, instituted upon evidence led by Private Sammy Carter, could not get beyond half-a-dozen. So that the disproportion was not so great as might have been supposed. Still the siege of the Sheds was felt to be of the nature of a forlorn hope.",force other side unknown number quality maintain be least proclaim be see count one stricter census institute evidence lead private get half disproportion great suppose siege feel nature forlorn hope 
17,"It was arranged that all who distinguished themselves for deeds of valour were to receive the Victoria Cross, a decoration which had been cut by Hugh John out of the tops of ginger-beer bottles with a cold chisel. As soon, however, as Sir Toady Lion heard this, he sat down in the dust of the roadside, and simply refused to budge till his grievances were redressed.",arrange distinguish deed valour receive decoration cut top ginger beer bottle cold chisel hear sit dust roadside refuse budge grievance redress 
18,"""I wants Victowya Cyoss _now_!"" he remarked, with his father's wrinkle of determination between the eyes showing very plain, as it always did when he wanted anything very much.",want remark father wrinkle determination eye show plain do want 
19,"For when Toady Lion asked for a thing, like the person in the advertisement, he saw that he got it.",ask thing person advertisement see get 
20,"In vain it was pointed out to him that this ill-advised action constituted rank mutiny, and that he was liable to be arrested, tried by court-martial, and ignominiously shot. Toady Lion knew all about mutiny, and cared nothing about courts-martial. Besides, he had had some experience, and he knew the value of ""making oneself a nuisance"" in army matters.",vain point ill advise action constitute rank mutiny liable arrest try court martial shoot know mutiny care court martial have experience know value make nuisance army matter 
21,"Equally in vain was Sammy Carter's humorously false information that he had better run, for here was Janet coming up the road with an awful biggy stick.",vain false information have good run come road awful biggy stick 
22,"""Don't care for Janet,"" reiterated Toady Lion. ""I wants Victowya Cyoss--I wants it _now!_""",care reiterate want want _now 
23,"So there upon the roadside, at the very outset of the campaign, Sir Toady Lion was decorated with the much coveted ""For Valour"" cross.",roadside very outset campaign decorate covete cross
