2,"Another week passed away, during which Ready repaired the boat, and William and Mr Seagrave were employed in digging up the garden.  It was also a very busy week at the house, as they had not washed linen for some time.  Mrs Seagrave and Juno, and even little Caroline were hard at work, and Tommy was more useful than ever he had been, going for the water as they required it, and watching little Albert.  Indeed, he was so active, that Mrs Seagrave praised him before his papa, and Tommy was quite proud.",week pass ready repair boat employ digg garden busy week house wash linen time little hard work useful go water require watch little active praise papa proud 
3,"On the Monday William and Ready set off in the boat to the little harbour, and found all the stock doing well.  Many of the bananas and guavas had ripened and withered, but there were enough left to fill the boat half full.",set boat little harbour find stock do many banana guava ripen wither be enough left fill boat half full 
4,"""We cannot do better than to leave the stock where it is at present, William; they can run into the cocoa-nut grove for shelter if there is a storm, and there is feed enough for ten times as many.""",do good leave stock present run cocoa nut grove shelter be storm be feed time many 
5,"""Yes; but will you not dig up a few yams first?""",dig few yam 
6,"""I had quite forgotten it, William.  I will go for the spade.""",forget go spade 
7,"Having procured the yams, they set off on their return.  Before they arrived at the bay, the sky clouded over and threatened a storm.  It did not, however, rain till after they had landed, when a small shower announced the commencement of the rainy season.  The fruit was very welcome to all of them, it was so long since they had tasted any.",procure yam set return arrive bay sky cloude threaten storm rain land small shower announce commencement rainy season fruit welcome long taste 
8,"The following day was beautifully fine, and everything appeared refreshed by the rain which had fallen.  It was, however, agreed, that Ready and William should go round the next morning, bring home the tents, and as many yams as the boat could carry.  William and Ready went out at night as usual, when Ready observed that the wind had chopped round to the eastward.",follow day fine appear refresh rain fall agree ready go next morning bring tent many yam boat carry go night usual ready observe wind choppe 
9,"""That will be bad for us to-morrow, Ready,"" replied William.  ""We may sail to the harbour, but we shall have to pull back with the loaded boat.""",bad ready reply sail harbour have pull load boat 
10,"""I trust it will be no worse than that, at all events,"" replied Ready; ""but we must now return, and go to bed.  I shall be up by daylight, so you need not wake without you like.""",trust bad event reply ready return go bed daylight wake 
11,"""I can't help waking,"" replied William, ""and I shall, therefore, be up with you.""",help wake reply 
12,"""Very well, I am always glad of your company.""",glad company 
13,"The next morning, just before the day dawned, Ready and William unfastened the door of the stockade, and went down to the beach.  The wind was still to the eastward, and blowing rather fresh, and the sky was cloudy.  As the sun rose, Ready, as usual, had his telescope with him, and looked through it at the offing to the eastward.  As he kept the spy-glass to his eye for some time without speaking, William said:",next morning day dawn ready unfasten door stockade go beach wind eastward blow fresh sky cloudy sun rise ready usual have telescope look offing keep spy glass eye time speak say 
14,"""Do you see anything, Ready, that you look so long in that direction?""",see ready look direction 
15,"""Either my old eyes deceive me, or I fear that I do,"" replied Ready; ""but a few minutes more will decide.""",old eye deceive fear reply ready few minute more decide 
16,"There was a bank of clouds on the horizon to the eastward, but as soon as the sun had risen above them, Ready, who had the telescope fixed in the same direction, said:",be bank cloud horizon eastward sun rise ready have telescope fix same direction say 
17,"""Yes, William, I am right.  I thought that those dark patches I saw there were brown grass sails.""",right think dark patch see be brown grass sail 
18,"""Sails of what, Ready?"" said William, hastily.",sail ready say 
19,"""Of the Indian canoes; I knew that they would come.  Take the glass and look yourself; my eye is quite dim from straining it so long.""",indian canoe know come take glass look eye dim strain 
20,"""Yes, I have them now,"" replied William, with his eye to the glass.  At last he said:",have reply eye glass last say 
21,"""Why, there are twenty or thirty of them, Ready, at least.""",be ready least 
22,"""And with twenty or thirty men in each too, William.""",man 
23,"""What must we do, Ready?  How frightened my poor mother will be!  I'm afraid we can do nothing against such a number.""",do ready frighten poor mother afraid do number 
24,"""Yes, William, we can do a great deal, and we must do a great deal. That there are hundreds of savages there is no doubt; but recollect that we have a stockade, which they cannot easily climb over, and plenty of firearms and ammunition, so that we can make a good fight of it, and perhaps beat them off, for they have nothing but clubs and spears.""",do great deal do great deal be hundred savage doubt recollect have stockade climb plenty firearm ammunition make good fight beat have club spear 
25,"""How fast they come down, Ready; why, they will be here in an hour.""",come ready hour 
26,"""No, sir, nor in two hours either; those are very large canoes. However, there is no time to be lost.  While I watch them for a few minutes till I make them more clearly out, do you run up to the house and beckon your father to come down to me; and then, William, get all the muskets ready, and bring the casks of powder, and of made-up cartridges, from the old house into the stockade.  Call Juno, and she will help you.  We shall have time enough to do everything.  After you have done that, you had better come down and join us.""",sir hour large canoe be time lose watch few minute make run house beckon father come get musket ready bring cask powder make cartridge old house stockade call help have time do do good come join 
27,"In a very few minutes after William ran up to the house, Mr Seagrave made his appearance.",few minute run house make appearance 
28,"""Ready, there is danger, I'm sure; William would not tell me, I presume, because he was afraid of alarming his mother.  What is it?""",ready be danger sure tell presume afraid alarm mother 
29,"""It is, Mr Seagrave, that the savages are now coming down upon us in large force; perhaps five or six hundred of them; and that we shall have to defend ourselves with might and main.""",savage come large force have defend might main 
30,"""Do you think we have any chance against such a force?""",think have chance force 
31,"""Yes, sir, with God's help I have no doubt but that we shall beat them off; but we must fight hard, and for some days, I fear.""",sir help have doubt beat fight day fear 
32,"Mr Seagrave examined the fleet of canoes with the glass.  ""It is, indeed, dreadful odds to contend against.""",examine fleet canoe glass dreadful odd contend 
33,"""Yes, sir, but three muskets behind a stockade are almost a match for all their clubs and spears, provided none of us are wounded.""",sir musket stockade match club spear provide wound 
34,"""Well, Ready, we must put our trust in the Lord, and do our best; I will second you to the utmost of my power, and William, I'm sure, will do his duty.""",ready put trust do good utmost power sure do duty 
35,"""I think, sir,"" said Ready, ""we had better not wait here any more, as we have not long to prepare for them.  We have only to fix up some of our strong deal planks on the inside of the stockade for us to stand upon when we are attacked, that we may see what the enemy is about, and be able to fire upon them.  But first we had better go to the old house, and take out what provisions and other articles we shall most want, and roll the casks into the stockade, for to the old house they will go first, and perhaps destroy everything in it.  The casks they certainly will, for the sake of the iron hoops.  An hour's work will do a great deal.  I believe we have everything we want in the stockade; Juno has her fuel, the large butt of water will last us two or three weeks at least, and if we have time, we will get the wheels down, and spear a couple of turtles for fresh provisions.""",think sir say ready wait more have long prepare have fix strong deal plank inside stockade stand attack see enemy able fire have good go old house take provision other article want roll cask stockade old house go destroy cask sake iron hoop hour work do great deal believe have want stockade have fuel large butt water last week least have time get wheel spear couple turtle fresh provision 
36,"These observations were made as they walked up to the house.  As soon as they arrived, they found William and Juno had just brought in the powder and cartridges.  Mr Seagrave went in to break the matter to his wife.",observation make walk house arrive find bring powder cartridge go break matter wife 
37,"""I was told that I had to expect this, my dear,"" replied Mrs Seagrave, ""so that it has not come upon me altogether unawares, and anything that a poor weak woman can do, I will.""",tell have expect dear reply come unawares poor weak woman do 
38,"""I am indeed greatly relieved,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""by finding you thus prepared and supported.  I shall feel no anxiety--but we have work to be done.""",relieved say find prepare support feel anxiety have work do 
39,"Mr and Mrs Seagrave then joined William, Ready, and Juno, who had already proceeded to the old house.  The children were all still in bed and asleep, so that there was no occasion for any one to watch them.",join ready proceed old house child bed asleep be occasion one watch
