1,CHAPTER 4. FAGGING.,chapter fagging 
2,"There is a queer elasticity about boys which no one, least of all themselves, can account for.  A quarter of an hour after the big practice had begun Stephen had forgotten all about his examination, and could think of nothing but cricket.",be queer elasticity boy least account quarter hour big practice begin forget examination think cricket

4,"""Well bowled, sir!"" shouted Master Paul, as a very swift ball from Ricketts took Bullinger's middle stump clean out of the ground--""rattling well bowled!

11,"""So he is--isn't that him going in now?  Yes; you see if Ricketts doesn't get him out in the first over!""",go see get first over 
12,"Stephen watched most eagerly and anxiously.  They were not playing a regular game, only standing up to be bowled at in front of the nets, or fielding at fixed places; but each ball, and each hit, and each piece of fielding, was watched and applauded as if a victory depended on it, for out of those playing to-day the two elevens for the Alphabet match were to be chosen; and out of those two elevens, as every one knew, the School eleven, which would play the County in June, was to be selected. Oliver, despite Paul's prophecy, stood out several overs of Rickett's, and Loman's, and the school captain's, one after the other, cutting some of their balls very hard, and keeping a very steady guard over his wicket.  At last a ball of Loman's got past him and snicked off his bails.",watch play regular game stand bowl front net field fix place ball hit piece fielding watch applaud victory depend play day eleven match choose eleven one know play select prophecy stand several over school captain other cut ball keep steady guard wicket last ball get snick bail

14,"""He's all right,"" said Paul; ""I guess Raleigh,"" (that was the school captain) ""didn't fancy his balls being licked about like that.  Never mind--there goes Braddy in.""",right say guess school captain fancy ball lick mind go 
15,"And so the practice went on, each candidate for the honour of a place in the eleven submitting to the ordeal, and being applauded or despised according as he acquitted himself.  Wraysford, of course, came out of the trial well, as he always did.",practice go candidate honour place submitt ordeal applaud despise accord acquitt course come trial

21,"""But you take such precious good care we shall not try, that's just it,"" said Pembury, winking at his companion.

37,"He discharged all his errands to the best of his ability, including that relating to the dead mouse, which he had great difficulty in rescuing from the clutches of a hungry dog on the way down, and then returned with Paul's raisins in one pocket, the mixed sweets in another, the book in another, and the other boy's bat over his shoulder.",discharge errand good ability include relate dead mouse have great difficulty rescuing clutch hungry dog way return raisin pocket mix sweet book other boy bat shoulder

53,"""What a time you've been!"" was all the thanks he got in that quarter. ""Why couldn't you come straight back with it?""",time thanks get quarter come 
54,"This was gratifying.  Stephen was learning at least one lesson that afternoon--that a fag, if he ever expects to be thanked for anything he does, is greatly mistaken.  He went off in a highly injured frame of mind to Loman's study.",gratifying learn least lesson afternoon fag expect thank mistaken go injured frame mind study 
55,"Master Paul's directions might have been more explicit--""The eighth door on the right; next to the one with the kicks.""  Now, as it happened, the door with the kicks on it was itself the eighth door on the right, with a study on either side of it, and which of these two was Loman's Stephen could not by the unaided light of nature determine.  He peeped into Number 7; it was empty.",direction explicit eighth door right one kick happen door kick eighth door right study side unaided light nature determine peep empty

86,"Poor Stephen!  There was little chance of another turn at his paper that night.  By the time Loman's wants had been attended to, and his directions for future fagging delivered, the prayer-bell rang, and for the half-hour following prayers the new boy was hauled away by Master Paul into the land of the Guinea-pigs, there to make the acquaintance of some of his future class-fellows, and to take part in a monster indignation meeting against the monitors for forbidding single wicket cricket in the passage, with a door for the wicket, an old inkpot for the ball, and a ruler for the bat.  Stephen quite boiled with rage to hear of this act of tyranny, and vowed vengeance along with all the rest twenty times over, and almost became reconciled with his enemy of the morning (but not quite) in the sympathy of emotion which this demonstration evoked.",poor be little chance turn paper night time want attend direction future fagging deliver prayer bell ring half hour follow prayer new boy haul land guinea pig make acquaintance future class fellow take part monster indignation meeting monitor forbid single wicket cricket passage door wicket old inkpot ball ruler bat boil rage hear act tyranny vow vengeance rest time become reconcile enemy morning sympathy emotion demonstration evoke

88,"""Come on,"" said Paul, ""or they'll bag our blankets.""",come say bag blanket 
89,"Stephen, wondering, and shivering at the bare idea, raced along the passage and up the staircase with his youthful ally to the dormitory. There they found they had been anticipated by the blanket-snatchers; and as they entered, one of these, the hero of the inky head, was deliberately abstracting one of those articles of comfort from Stephen's own bed.",wonder shiver bare idea race passage staircase youthful ally dormitory find anticipate blanket snatcher enter hero inky head abstract article comfort own bed 
90,"""There's young Bramble got your blanket, Greenfield,"" cried Paul, ""pitch into him!""",be young get blanket cry pitch 
91,"Stephen, nothing loth, marched up to Master Bramble and demanded his blanket.  A general engagement ensued, some of the inhabitants of the dormitory siding with Stephen, and some with Bramble, until it seemed as if the coveted blanket would have parted in twain.  In the midst of the confusion a sentry at the door suddenly put his head in and shouted ""Nix!""  The signal had a magical effect on all but the uninitiated Stephen, who, profiting by his adversaries' surprise, made one desperate tug at his blanket, which he triumphantly rescued.",march demand blanket general engagement ensue inhabitant dormitory side seem covete blanket part twain midst confusion sentry door put head shout signal have magical effect uninitiated profit adversary surprise make desperate tug blanket rescue 
92,"""Look sharp,"" said Paul, ""here comes Rastle.""  Mr Rastle was the small boys' tutor and governor.  Stephen took the hint, and was very soon curled up, with his brave blanket round him, in bed, where, despite the despairing thought of his paper, the cruel injustice of the owner of the jam-pots, and the general hardness of his lot, he could not help feeling he was a good deal more at home at Saint Dominic's than he had ever yet found himself.",look sharp say come small boy tutor governor take hint curl brave blanket bed despairing thought paper cruel injustice owner jam pot general hardness lot help feel good deal home find
