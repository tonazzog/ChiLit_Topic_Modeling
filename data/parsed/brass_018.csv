2," ""Thy second question, O pertinacious one?"" said the Jinnee, impatiently. He was standing with folded arms looking down on Horace, who was still seated on the narrow cornice, not daring to glance below again, lest he should lose his head altogether.",second question pertinacious one say stand fold arm look seat narrow cornice dare glance lose head

Were you so comfortable in it as all that?""",come say want know propose dash piece barbarous way return let bottle comfortable 
4,"""In the bottle I was at least suffered to rest, and none molested me. But in releasing me thou didst perfidiously conceal from me that Suleyman was dead and gone, and that there reigneth one in his stead mightier a thousand-fold, who afflicteth our race with labours and tortures exceeding all the punishments of Suleyman.""",bottle least suffer rest molest release conceal dead gone reigneth one stead mighty fold afflicteth race labour torture exceed punishment 
5,"""What on earth have you got into your head now? You can't mean the Lord Mayor?""",earth get head mean 
6,"""Whom else?"" said the Jinnee, solemnly. ""And though, for this once, by a device I have evaded his vengeance, yet do I know full well that either by virtue of the magic jewel upon his breast, or through that malignant monster with the myriad ears and eyes and tongues, which thou callest 'The Press,' I shall inevitably fall into his power before long.""",else say device evade vengeance know full virtue magic jewel breast malignant monster myriad ear eye tongue callest fall power long 
7,"For the life of him, in spite of his desperate plight, Horace could not help laughing. ""I beg your pardon, Mr. Fakrash,"" he said, as soon as he could speak, ""but--the Lord Mayor! It's really too absurd. Why, he wouldn't hurt a hair on a fly's head!""",life spite desperate plight help laugh beg pardon say speak absurd hurt hair fly head 
8,"""Seek not to deceive me further!"" said Fakrash, furiously. ""Didst thou not inform me with thy own mouth that the spirits of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire were subject to his will? Have I no eyes? Do I not behold from here the labours of my captive brethren? What are those on yonder bridges but enslaved Jinn, shrieking and groaning in clanking fetters, and snorting forth steam, as they drag their wheeled burdens behind them? Are there not others toiling, with panting efforts, through the sluggish waters; others again, imprisoned in lofty pillars, from which the smoke of their breath ascendeth even unto Heaven? Doth not the air throb and quiver with their restless struggles as they writhe below in darkness and torment? And thou hast the shamelessness to pretend that these things are done in the Lord Mayor's own realms without his knowledge! Verily thou must take me for a fool!""",seek deceive say inform own mouth spirit subject will eye behold labour captive brethren yonder bridge enslave shriek groan clanking fetter snort steam drag wheel burden be other toil panting effort sluggish water other imprison lofty pillar smoke breath ascendeth air throb quiver restless struggle writhe darkness torment hast shamelessness pretend thing do own realm knowledge take fool

10,"""I wasn't aware the Lord Mayor had so much power as all that,"" he said; ""but very likely you're right. And if you're so anxious to keep in favour with him, it would be a great mistake to kill me. That _would_ annoy him.""",aware have much power say likely right anxious keep favour great mistake kill _would_ annoy

15,"""Then,"" replied the Jinnee, ""I shall flee away to Arabia, where I shall be safe.""",reply flee safe 
16,"""Don't you be too sure of that!"" said Horace. ""You see all those wires stretched on poles down there?

And I may mention that Arabia is now more or less under British jurisdiction.""",sure say see wire stretch pole pathway certain know electric current send message fly far mention british jurisdiction

23,"""I can quite understand that,"" said Horace, sympathetically. ""Just imagine your having to drag an excursion train to the seaside on a Bank Holiday, or being condemned to print off a cheap comic paper, or even the _War Cry_, when you might be leading a snug and idle existence in your bottle. If I were you, I should go and get inside it at once.

28,"""One moment,"" he said. ""Of course, if you've set your heart on pitching me over, you must.

30,"""Well,"" said Horace, ""of course, you can get into the bottle alone--that's simple enough.

If he can, he thought, ""I'm done for!""",say course get bottle simple difficulty see sure put cap know think done 
31,"""That,"" began the Jinnee, with his usual confidence ""will be the easiest of--nay,"" he corrected himself, ""there be things that not even the Jinn themselves can accomplish, and one of them is to seal a vessel while remaining in it. I am indebted to thee for reminding me thereof.""",begin usual confidence easy correct be thing accomplish seal vessel remain indebted remind

38,"""But about those Efreets,"" persisted Horace. ""You know what Efreets _are_! How can you be sure that, when they've got you in the bottle, they won't hand you over to the Lord Mayor?

48,"Even then Horace had his misgivings; but as there was no other way of getting off that cornice, he decided to take the risk. And, as it proved, he acted judiciously, for the Jinnee flew to Vincent Square with honourable precision, and dropped him neatly into the armchair in which he had little hoped ever to find himself again.",have misgiving be other way get cornice decide take risk prove act fly honourable precision drop armchair have little hope find

""Nay, in token of my displeasure, I will deprive thee even of such gifts as thou hast retained."" He pointed his grey forefinger at Ventimore, whose turban and jewelled robes instantly shrivelled into cobwebs and tinder, and fluttered to the carpet in filmy shreds, leaving him in nothing but his underclothing.",load manner rich favour bestow more say token displeasure deprive such gift retain point grey forefinger turban jewell robe shrivell cobweb tinder flutter carpet filmy shred leave underclothing

You seem to consider I ought to be grateful to you. In Heaven's name, for what? I've been as forbearing as possible all this time, because I gave you credit for meaning well. Now, I'll speak plainly. I told you from the first, and I tell you now, that I want no riches nor honours from you. The one real good turn you did me was bringing me that client, and you spoilt that because you would insist on building the palace yourself, instead of leaving it to me! As for the rest--here am I, a ruined and discredited man, with a client who probably supposes I'm in league with the Devil; with the girl I love, and might have married, believing that I have left her to marry a Princess; and her father, unable ever to forgive me for having seen him as a one-eyed mule.

123,"""Oh, don't you, though?"" said Horace. ""I know better. Never mind,"" he said, as he recollected that the seal was in Fakrash's possession. ""I'll take it as it is. Don't trouble to wrap it up. I'm in rather a hurry.""",say know good mind say recollect seal possession take trouble wrap hurry 
124,"It was almost dark when he got back to his rooms, where he found the Jinnee shaking with mingled rage and apprehension.",dark get room find shake mingle rage apprehension 
125,"""No welcome to thee!"" he cried. ""Dilatory dog that thou art! Hadst thou delayed another minute, I would have called down some calamity upon thee.""",welcome cry dilatory dog art delay minute call calamity 
126,"""Well, you need not trouble yourself to do that now,"" returned Ventimore. ""Here's your bottle, and you can creep into it as soon as you please.""",trouble do return bottle creep 
127,"""But the seal!"" shrieked the Jinnee. ""What hast thou done with the seal which was upon the bottle?""",seal shriek do seal bottle 
128,"""Why, you've got it yourself, of course,"" said Horace, ""in one of your pockets.""",get course say pocket 
129,"""O thou of base antecedents!"" howled Fakrash, shaking out his flowing draperies. ""How should _I_ have the seal? This is but a fresh device of thine to undo me!""",base antecedent howl shake flow drapery have seal fresh device undo 
130,"""Don't talk rubbish!"" retorted Horace. ""You made the Professor give it up to you yesterday. You must have lost it somewhere or other. Never mind! I'll get a large cork or bung, which will do just as well. And I've lots of sealing-wax.""",talk rubbish retort make give yesterday lose other mind get large cork bung do lot sealing wax 
131,"""I will have no seal but the seal of Suleyman!"" declared the Jinnee. ""For with no other will there be security. Verily I believe that that accursed sage, thy friend, hath contrived by some cunning to get the seal once more into his hands. I will go at once to his abode and compel him to restore it.""",have seal seal declare other be security believe accurse sage friend have contrived cunning get seal hand go abode compel restore 
132,"""I wouldn't,"" said Horace, feeling extremely uneasy, for it was evidently a much simpler thing to let a Jinnee out of a bottle than to get him in again. ""He's quite incapable of taking it. And if you go out now you'll only make a fuss and attract the attention of the Press, which I thought you rather wanted to avoid.""",say feel uneasy simple thing let bottle get incapable take go make fuss attract attention think want avoid 
133,"""I shall attire myself in the garments of a mortal--even those I assumed on a former occasion,"" said Fakrash, and as he spoke his outer robes modernised into a frock-coat. ""Thus shall I escape attention.""",attire garment mortal assume former occasion say speak outer robe modernise frock coat escape attention 
134,"""Wait one moment,"" said Horace. ""What is that bulge in your breast-pocket?""",wait moment say bulge breast pocket 
135,"""Of a truth,"" said the Jinnee, looking relieved but not a little foolish as he extracted the object, ""it is indeed the seal.""",truth say look relieve little foolish extract object seal 
136,"""You're in such a hurry to think the worst of everybody, you see!"" said Horace. ""Now, _do_ try to carry away with you into your seclusion a better opinion of human nature.""",hurry think bad see say try carry seclusion good opinion human nature 
137,"""Perdition to all the people of this age!"" cried Fakrash, re-assuming his green robe and turban, ""for I now put no faith in human beings and would afflict them all, were not the Lord Mayor (on whom be peace!) mightier than I. Therefore, while it is yet time, take thou the stopper, and swear that, after I am in this bottle, thou wilt seal it as before and cast it into deep waters, where no eye will look upon it more!""",perdition person age cry re-assume green robe turban put faith human being afflict peace mighty time take stopper swear bottle seal cast deep water eye look more 
138,"""With all the pleasure in the world!"" said Horace; ""only you must keep _your_ part of the bargain first. You will kindly obliterate all recollection of yourself and the brass bottle from the minds of every human being who has had anything to do with you or it.""",pleasure world say keep part bargain obliterate recollection brass bottle mind human being have do 
139,"""Not so,"" objected the Jinnee, ""for thus wouldst thou forget thy compact.""",object forget compact 
140,"""Oh, very well, leave _me_ out, then,"" said Horace. ""Not that anything could make me forget _you_!""",leave say make forget 
141,"Fakrash swept his right hand round in a half circle. ""It is accomplished,"" he said. ""All recollection of myself and yonder bottle is now erased from the memories of every one but thyself.""",sweep right hand half circle accomplish say recollection yonder bottle erase memory one 
142,"""But how about my client?"" said Horace. ""I can't afford to lose _him_, you know.""",client say afford lose _him_ know 
143,"""He shall return unto thee,"" said the Jinnee, trembling with impatience. ""Now perform thy share.""",return say tremble impatience perform share 
144,"Horace had triumphed. It had been a long and desperate duel with this singular being, who was at once so crafty and so childlike, so credulous and so suspicious, so benevolent and so malign. Again and again he had despaired of victory, but he had won at last. In another minute or so this formidable Jinnee would be safely bottled once more, and powerless to intermeddle and plague him for the future.",triumph long desperate duel singular being crafty childlike credulous suspicious benevolent malign despair victory win last minute formidable bottled more powerless intermeddle plague future 
145,"And yet, in the very moment of triumph, quixotic as such scruples may seem to some, Ventimore's conscience smote him. He could not help a certain pity for the old creature, who was shaking there convulsively prepared to re-enter his bottle-prison rather than incur a wholly imaginary doom. Fakrash had aged visibly within the last hour; now he looked even older than his three thousand and odd years. True, he had led Horace a fearful life of late, but at first, at least, his intentions had been good. His gratitude, if mistaken in its form, was the sign of a generous disposition. Not every Jinnee, surely, would have endeavoured to press untold millions and honours and dignities of all kinds upon him, in return for a service which most mortals would have considered amply repaid by a brace of birds and an invitation to an evening party.",very moment triumph quixotic such scruple seem conscience smeat help certain pity old creature shake prepare re-enter bottle prison incur imaginary doom aged last hour look old odd year true lead fearful life first least intention good gratitude mistaken form sign generous disposition endeavour press untold million honour dignity kind return service most mortal consider repaid brace bird invitation evening party 
146,"And how was Horace treating _him_? He was taking what, in his heart, he felt to be a rather mean advantage of the Jinnee's ignorance of modern life to cajole him into returning to his captivity. Why not suffer him to live out the brief remainder of his years (for he could hardly last more than another century or two at most) in freedom? Fakrash had learnt his lesson: he was not likely to interfere again in human affairs; he might find his way back to the Palace of the Mountain of the Clouds and end his days there, in peaceful enjoyment of the society of such of the Jinn as might still survive unbottled.",treat take heart feel mean advantage ignorance modern life cajole return captivity suffer live brief remainder year last more century most freedom learn lesson likely interfere human affair find way end day peaceful enjoyment society such survive unbottled 
147,"So, obeying--against his own interests--some kindlier impulse, Horace made an effort to deter the Jinnee, who was already hovering in air above the neck of the bottle in a swirl of revolving draperies, like some blundering old bee vainly endeavouring to hit the opening into his hive.",obey own interest kindly impulse make effort deter hover air neck bottle swirl revolve drapery blunder old bee endeavour hit opening hive 
148,"""Mr. Fakrash,"" he cried, ""before you go any farther, listen to me. There's no real necessity, after all, for you to go back to your bottle. If you'll only wait a little----""",cry go listen be real necessity go bottle wait little 
149,"But the Jinnee, who had now swelled to gigantic proportions, and whose form and features were only dimly recognisable through the wreaths of black vapour in which he was involved, answered him from his pillar of smoke in a terrible voice. ""Wouldst thou still persuade me to linger?"" he cried. ""Hold thy peace and be ready to fulfil thine undertaking.""",swell gigantic proportion form feature recognisable wreath black vapour involve answer pillar smoke terrible voice persuade linger cry hold peace ready fulfil undertaking 
150,"""But, look here,"" persisted Horace. ""I should feel such a brute if I sealed you up without telling you----"" The whirling and roaring column, in shape like an inverted cone, was being fast sucked down into the vessel, till only a semi-materialised but highly infuriated head was left above the neck of the bottle.",look persist feel brute seal tell whirl roar column shape invert cone fast suck vessel semi materialise infuriate head leave neck bottle 
151,"""Must I tarry,"" it cried, ""till the Lord Mayor arrive with his Memlooks, and the hour of safety is expired? By my head, if thou delayest another instant, I will put no more faith in thee! And I will come forth once more, and afflict thee and thy friends--ay, and all the dwellers in this accursed city--with the most painful and unheard-of calamities.""",tarry cry arrive hour safety expired head delayest instant put more faith come more afflict friend dweller accurse city painful unheard calamity 
152,"And, with these words, the head sank into the bottle with a loud clap resembling thunder.",word head sink bottle loud clap resemble thunder 
153,"Horace hesitated no longer. The Jinnee himself had absolved him from all further scruples; to imperil Sylvia and her parents--not to mention all London--out of consideration for one obstinate and obnoxious old demon, would clearly be carrying sentiment much too far.",hesitate absolve further scruple imperil parent mention consideration obstinate obnoxious old demon carry sentiment 
154,"Accordingly, he made a rush for the jar and slipped the metal cover over the mouth of the neck, which was so hot that it blistered his fingers, and, seizing the poker, he hammered down the secret catch until the lid fitted as closely as Suleyman himself could have required.",make rush jar slip metal cover mouth neck hot blister finger seize poker hammer secret catch lid fit require 
155,"Then he stuffed the bottle into a kit-bag, adding a few coals to give it extra weight, and toiled off with it to the nearest steamboat pier, where he spent his remaining pence in purchasing a ticket to the Temple.",stuff bottle kit bag add few coal give extra weight toil near steamboat pier spend remain pence purchase ticket

159,"""A gentleman on board one of the Thames steamboats (so we are informed by an eye-witness) met with a somewhat ludicrous mishap yesterday evening. It appears that he had with him a small portmanteau, or large hand-bag, which he was supporting on the rail of the stern bulwark. Just as the vessel was opposite the Savoy Hotel he incautiously raised his hand to the brim of his hat, thereby releasing hold of the bag, which overbalanced itself and fell into the deepest part of the river, where it instantly sank. The owner (whose carelessness occasioned considerable amusement to passengers in his immediate vicinity) appeared no little disconcerted by the oversight, and was not unnaturally reticent as to the amount of his loss, though he was understood to state that the bag contained nothing of any great value. However this may be, he has probably learnt a lesson which will render him more careful in future.""",gentleman board steamboat inform eye witness meet ludicrous mishap yesterday evening appear have small portmanteau large hand bag support rail stern bulwark vessel raise hand brim hat release hold bag overbalance fall deep part river sink owner carelessness occasion considerable amusement passenger immediate vicinity appear little disconcert oversight reticent amount loss understand state bag contain great value learn lesson render careful future
