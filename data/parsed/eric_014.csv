2,"     ""Calm on the bosom of thy God,        Fair spirit, rest thee now!      E'en while with us thy footsteps trod,        His seal was on thy brow.""--MRS. HEMANS.",calm bosom fair spirit rest footstep trod seal brow 
3,"They did not awake till noon. Montagu opened his eyes, and at first could not collect his thoughts, as he saw the carpeted little room, the bright fire, and the housekeeper seated in her arm-chair before it. But turning his head, he caught a glimpse of Eric, who was still asleep, and he then remembered all. He sprang out of bed, refreshed and perfectly well, and the sound of his voice woke Eric; but Eric was still languid and weak, and did not get up that day, nor was he able to go to work again for some days; but he was young and strong, and his vigorous constitution soon threw off the effects of his fast and exposure.",awake noon open eye collect thought see carpet little room bright fire housekeeper seat arm chair turn head catch glimpse asleep remember spring bed refresh sound voice wake languid weak get day able go work day young strong vigorous constitution throw effect fast exposure 
4,"Their first inquiry was for Edwin. The nurse shook her head sadly. ""He is very dangerously ill.""",first inquiry nurse shake head ill 
5,"""Is he?"" said they both, anxiously. And then they preserved a deep silence; and when Montagu, who immediately began to dress, knelt down to say his prayers, Eric, though unable to get up, knelt also over his pillow, and the two felt that their young earnest prayers were mingling for the one who seemed to have been taken while they were left.",say preserve deep silence begin dress knolt say prayer unable get knolt pillow feel young earnest prayer mingle one seem take leave 
6,"The reports grew darker and darker about Edwin, At first it was thought that the blow on his head was dangerous, and that the exposure to wet, cold, fear, and hunger, had permanently weakened his constitution; and when his youth seemed to be triumphing over these dangers, another became more threatening. His leg never mended; he had both sprained the knee badly, and given the tibia an awkward twist, so that the least motion was agony to him.",report grow dark dark first think blow head dangerous exposure wet cold fear hunger weaken constitution youth seem triumph danger become threatening leg mend sprain knee give tibia awkward twist least motion agony 
7,"In his fever he was constantly delirious. No one was allowed to see him, though many of the boys tried to do so, and many were the earnest inquiries for him day by day. It then became more fully apparent than ever, that, although Edwin was among them without being _of_ them, no boy in the school was more deeply honored and fondly loved than he. Even the elastic spirits of boyhood could not quite throw off the shadow of gloom which his illness cast over the school.",fever delirious allow see many boy try do many earnest inquiry day day become apparent boy school honor love elastic spirit boyhood throw shadow gloom illness cast school 
8,"Very tenderly they nursed him. All that human kindness could do was done for him by the stranger hands. And yet not all; poor Edwin had no father, no mother, hardly any relatives. His only aunt, Mrs. Upton, would have come to nurse him, but she was an invalid, and he was often left alone in his delirium and agony.",nurse human kindness do do stranger hand poor have father mother relative only aunt come nurse invalid leave alone delirium agony 
9,"Alone, yet not alone. There was One with him--always in his thoughts, always leading, guiding, blessing him unseen--not deserting the hurt lamb of his flock; one who was once a boy himself, and who, when he was a boy, did his Father's business, and was subject unto his parents in the obscure home of the despised village. Alone! nay, to them whose eyes were opened, the room of sickness and pain was thronged and beautiful with angelic presences.",alone be thought lead guide bless unseen desert hurt lamb flock boy boy do business subject parent obscure home despise village eye open room sickness pain throng beautiful angelic presence 
10,"Often did Eric, and Upton, and Montagu, talk of their loved friend. Eric's life seemed absorbed in the thought of him, and in passionate, unspeakable longings for his recovery. Now he valued more than ever the sweet remembered hours spent with him; their games, and communnings, and walks, and Russell's gentle influence, and brave, kindly rebukes. Yet he must not even see him, must not whisper one word of soothing to him in his anguish; he could only pray for him, and that he did with a depth of hope.",do talk love friend life seem absorb thought passionate unspeakable longing recovery value more sweet remember hour spend game communning walk gentle influence brave rebuke see whisper word soothing anguish pray do depth hope 
11,"At last Upton, in virtue of his relationship, was allowed to visit him. His delirium had become more infrequent, but he could not yet even recognise his cousin, and the visits to his sick-room were so sad and useless, that Upton forbore. ""And yet you should hear him talk in his delirium,"" he said to Eric; ""not one evil word, or bad thought, or wicked thing, ever escapes him. I'm afraid, Eric, it would hardly be so with you or me.""",last virtue relationship allow visit delirium become infrequent recognise cousin visit sick room sad useless forbore hear talk delirium say evil word bad thought wicked thing escape afraid 
12,"""No"" said Eric, in a low and humble tone; and guilty conscience brought the deep color, wave after wave, of crimson into his cheeks.",say low humble tone guilty conscience bring deep color wave wave crimson cheek 
13,"""And he talks with such affection of you, Eric. He speaks sometimes of all of us very gently; but you seem to be always in his thoughts, and every now and then he prays for you quite unconsciously.""",talk such affection speak seem thought pray 
14,"Eric turned his head to brush away a tear. ""When do you think I shall be allowed too see him?""",turn head brush tear think allow see 
15,"""Not just yet, I fear.""",fear 
16,"After a week or two of most anxious suspense, Russell's mind ceased to wander, but the state of his sprain gave more cause for alarm. Fresh advice was called in, and it was decided that the leg must be amputated.",week anxious suspense mind cease wander state sprain give more cause alarm fresh advice call decide leg amputate 
17,"When Eric was told of this, he burst into passionate complaints. ""Only think, Monty, isn't it hard, isn't it cruel? When we see our brave, bright Edwin again, he will be a cripple."" Eric hardly understood that he was railing at the providence of a merciful God.",tell burst passionate complaint think hard cruel see brave bright cripple understand rail providence merciful 
18,"The day for the operation came. When it was over, poor Russell seemed to amend, and the removal of the perpetual pain gave him relief. They were all deeply moved at his touching resignation; no murmur, no cry escaped him; no words but the sweetest thanks for every little office of kindness done to him. A few days after, he asked Dr. Underhay ""if he might see Eric?""",day operation come poor seem amend removal perpetual pain give relief move touch resignation murmur cry escape word sweetest thanks little office kindness do few day ask see 
19,"""Yes, my boy,"" said the doctor kindly, ""you may see him, and one or two other of your particular friends if you like, provided you don't excite yourself too much. I trust you will get better now.""",boy say doctor see other particular friend like provide excite much trust get good 
20,"So Eric and Montagu were told by Dr. Rowlands that at six they might go and see their friend. ""Be sure,"" he added, ""that you don't startle or excite him.""",tell go see friend sure add startle excite 
21,"They promised, and after school on that beautiful evening of early summer they went to the sick-room door Stopping, they held their breath, and knocked very gently. Yes! it was the well-known voice which gave the answer, but it was faint and low. Full of awe, they softly opened the door, which admitted them into the presence of the dear companion whom they had not seen for so long. Since then it seemed as though gulfs far deeper than the sea had been flowing between him and them.",promise school beautiful evening early summer go sick room door stop hold breath knock know voice give answer faint low full awe open door admit presence dear companion see seem gulf deep sea flow 
22,"Full of awe, and hand in hand, they entered the room on tiptoe--the darkened room where Russell was What a hush and oppression there seemed to them at first in the dim, silent chamber; what an awfulness in all the appliances which showed how long and deeply their schoolfellow had suffered. But all this vanished directly they caught sight of his face. There he lay, so calm, and weak, and still, with his bright, earnest eyes turned towards them, as though to see whether any of their affection for him had ceased or been forgotten!",full awe hand hand enter room tiptoe darken room hush oppression seem first dim silent chamber awfulness appliance show schoolfellow suffer vanish catch sight face lay calm weak bright earnest eye turn see affection cease forget 
23,"In an instant they were kneeling in silence by the bed with bowed foreheads; and the sick boy tenderly put his hands on their heads, and pushed the frail white fingers through their hair, and looked at them tearfully without a word, till they hid their faces with their hands, and broke into deep suppressed sobs of compassion.",instant kneel silence bed bow forehead sick boy put hand head push frail white finger hair look word hide face hand break deep suppress sob compassion 
24,"""Oh hush, hush!"" he said, as he felt their tears dropping on his hands while they kissed him. ""Dear Eric, dear Monty, why should you cry so for me? I am very happy.""",say feel tear drop hand kiss dear dear cry happy 
25,"But they caught the outline of his form as he lay on the bed, and had now for the first time realized that he was a cripple for life; and as the throng of memories came on them--memories of his skill and fame at cricket, and racquets, and football--of their sunny bathes together in sea and river, and all their happy holiday wanderings--they could not restrain their emotion, and wept uncontrollably. Neither of them could speak a word, or break the holy silence; and as he patted their heads and cheeks, his own tears flowed fast in sympathy and self-pity. But he felt the comforting affection which they could not utter; he felt it in his loneliness, and it did him good.",catch outline form lay bed first time realize cripple life throng memory come memory skill fame cricket racquet football sunny bathe sea river happy holiday wandering restrain emotion goot speak word break holy silence patt head cheek own tear flow sympathy self pity feel comforting affection utter feel loneliness do good 
26,"The nurse broke in upon the scene, which she feared would agitate Edwin too much; and with red eyes and heavy hearts the boys left, only whispering, ""We will come again to-morrow, Edwin!""",nurse break scene fear agitate much red eye heavy heart boy leave whisper come 
27,"They came the next day, and many days, and got to talk quite cheerfully with him, and read to him. They loved this occupation more than any game, and devoted themselves to it. The sorrow of the sick-room more than repaid them for the glad life without, when they heard Russell's simple and heartfelt thanks. ""Ah! how good of you, dear fellows,"" he would say, ""to give up the merry playground for a wretched cripple,"" and he would smile cheerfully to show that his trial had not made him weary of life. Indeed, he often told them that he believed they felt for him more than he did himself.",come next day many day get talk read love occupation more game devote sorrow sick room more repaid glad life hear simple heartfelt thanks good dear fellow say give merry playground wretched cripple smile show trial make weary life tell believe feel more do 
28,"One day Eric brought him a little bunch of primroses and violets. He seemed much better, and Eric's spirits were high with the thoughts and hopes of the coming holidays. ""There, Edwin,"" he said, as the boy gratefully and eagerly took the flowers, ""don't they make you glad? They are one of our _three_ signs, you know, of the approaching holidays. One sign was the first sight of the summer steamer going across the bay; another was May eve, when these island-fellows light big gorse fires all over the mountains, and throw yellow marsh-lilies at their doors to keep off the fairies. Do you remember, Eddy, gathering some last May eve, and sitting out in the playground till sunset, watching the fires begin to twinkle on Cronck-Irey and Barrule for miles away? What a jolly talk we had that evening about the holidays; but my father and mother were here then, you know, and we were all going to Fairholm. But the third sign--the first primrose and violet--was always the happiest. You can't think how I _grabbed_ at the first primrose this year; I found it by a cave on the Ness. And though these are rather the last than the first, yet I knew you'd like them, Eddy, so I hunted for them everywhere. And how much better you're looking too; such shining eyes, and, yes! I positively declare, quite a ruddy cheek like your old one. You'll soon be out among us again, that's clear----""",day bring little bunch primrose violet seem good spirit high thought hope come holiday say boy take flower make glad _three_ sign know approach holiday sign first sight summer steamer go bay island fellow light big gorse fire mountain throw yellow marsh lilie door keep fairy remember gather last eve sit playground sunset watch fire begin twinkle mile jolly talk have evening holiday father mother know go third sign first primrose violet happy think _grabbed first primrose year find cave last first know like hunt good look such shine eye declare ruddy cheek old one clear 
29,"He stopped abruptly: he had been rattling on just in the merry way that Russell now most loved to hear, but, as he was talking, he caught the touch of sadness on Russell's face, and saw his long, abstracted, eager look at the flowers.",stop rattling merry way love hear talk catch touch sadness face see long abstract eager look flower 
30,"""Dear fellow, you're not worse, are you?"" he said quickly. ""What a fool I am to chatter so; it makes you ill.""",dear fellow bad say fool chatter make ill 
31,"""No, no, Eric, talk on; you can't think how I love to hear you. Oh, how very beautiful these primroses are! Thank you, thank you, for bringing them."" And he again fixed on them the eager dreamy look which had startled Eric--as though he were learning their color and shape by heart.",talk think love hear beautiful primrose thank thank bring fix eager dreamy look startle learn color shape heart 
32,"""I wish I hadn't brought them, though,"" said Eric, ""they are filling your mind with regrets. But, Eddy, you'll be well by the holidays--a month hence, you know--or else I shouldn't have talked so gladly about them.""",wish bring say fill mind regret holiday month know talk 
33,"""No, Eric,"" said Russell sadly, ""these dear flowers are the last spring blossoms that I shall see--_here_ at least. Yes, I will keep them, for your sake, Eric, till I die.""",say dear flower last spring blossom see least keep sake die 
34,"""Oh don't talk so,"" said Eric, shocked and flustered, ""why everybody knows and says that you're getting better.""",talk say shocked flustered know say get good 
35,"Russell smiled and shook his head. ""No, Eric, I shall die. There stop, dear fellow, don't cry,"" said he, raising his hands quietly to Eric's face; ""isn't it better for me so? I own it seemed sad at first to leave this bright world and the sea--yes, even that cruel sea,"" he continued smiling; ""and to leave Roslyn, and Upton, and Monty, and, above all, to leave _you_, Eric, whom I love best in all the world. Yes, remember I've no home, Eric, and no prospects. There was nothing to be sorry for in this, so long as God gave me health and strength; but health went for ever into those waves at the Stack, where you saved my life, dear, gallant Eric; and what could I do now? It doesn't look so happy to _halt_ through life. Oh Eric, Eric, I am young, but I am dying--dying, Eric,"" he said solemnly, ""my brother; let me call you brother; I have no near relations, you know, to fill up the love in my yearning heart, but I _do_ love _you_. Kiss me, Eric, as though I were a child, and you a child. There, that comforts me; I feel as if I _were_ a child again, and had a dear brother;--and I _shall_ be a child again soon, Eric, in the courts of a Father's house.""",smile shake head die stop dear fellow cry say raise hand face good own seem sad first leave bright world sea cruel sea continue smile leave leave love good world remember have home prospect be sorry give health strength health go wave save life dear gallant do look happy _halt life young die die say brother let call brother have near relation know fill love yearn heart love kiss child child comfort feel _were_ child have dear brother child court house 
36,"Eric could not speak. These words startled him; he never dreamt _recently_ of Russell's death, but had begun to reckon on his recovery, and now life seemed darker to him than ever.",speak word startle dreamt _recently_ death begin reckon recovery life seem dark 
37,"But Russell was pressing the flowers to his lips. ""The grass withereth,"" he murmured, ""the flower fadeth, and the glory of its beauty perisheth; but--_but_ the word of the Lord endureth for ever."" And here he too burst into natural tears, and Eric pressed his hand, with more than a brother's fondness, to his heart.",press flower lip grass withereth murmure flower fadeth glory beauty perisheth word endureth burst natural tear press hand more brother fondness heart 
38,"""Oh Eddy, Eddy, my heart is full,"" he said, ""too full to speak to you. Let me read to you;"" and with Russell's arm round his neck he sat down, beside his pillow, and read to him about ""the pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."" At first sobs choked his voice, but it gathered firmness as he went on.",heart full say full speak let read arm neck sit pillow read pure river water life clear crystal proceeding throne first sob choke voice gather firmness go

41,"""And they shall see his face,"" murmured Russell, ""_and they shall see his face_"" Eric paused and looked at him; a sort of rapture seemed to be lighted in his eyes, as though they saw heavenly things, and his countenance was like an angel's to look upon. Eric closed the book reverently, and gazed.",see face murmure see face_ pause look sort rapture seem light eye see heavenly thing countenance angel look close book gaze 
42,"""And now pray for me, Eric, will you?"" Eric knelt down, but no prayer would come; his breast swelled; and his heart beat fast, but emotion prevented him from uttering a word. But Russell laid his hand on his head and prayed.",pray knolt prayer come breast swell heart beat emotion prevent utter word lay hand head pray 
43,"""O gracious Lord God, look down, merciful Father on us, two erring, weak, sinful boys; look down and bless us, Lord, for the love thou bearest unto thy children. One thou art taking; Lord, take me to the green pastures of thy home, where no curse is; and one remains--O Lord! bless him with the dew of thy blessing; lead and guide him, and keep him for ever in thy fear and love, that he may continue thine for ever, and hereafter we may meet together among the redeemed, in the immortal glory of the resurrection. Hear us, O Father, for thy dear Son's sake. Amen! Amen!""",gracious look merciful father err weak sinful boy look bless love bearest child art take take green pasture home curse remain bless dew blessing lead guide keep fear love continue meet redeem immortal glory resurrection hear dear sake 
44,"The childlike, holy, reverent voice ceased, and Eric rose. One long brotherly kiss he printed on Russell's forehead, and, full of sorrowful forebodings, bade him good night.",childlike holy reverent voice cease rise long brotherly kiss print forehead full sorrowful foreboding bid good night 
45,"He asked Dr. Underhay whether his fears were correct. ""Yes,"" he said, ""he may die at any time; he _must_ die soon. It is even best that he should; besides the loss of a limb, that blow on the head would certainly affect the brain and the intellect if he lived.""",ask fear correct say die time die good loss limb blow head affect brain intellect live 
46,Eric shuddered--a long cold shudder.,shudder long cold shudder 
47,"The holidays drew on; for Russell's sake, and at his earnest wish, Eric had worked harder than he ever did before. All his brilliant abilities, all his boyish ambition, were called into exercise; and, to the delight of every one, he gained ground rapidly, and seemed likely once more to dispute the palm with Owen. No one rejoiced more in this than Mr. Rose, and he often gladdened Russell's heart by telling him about it; for every day he had a long visit to the sick boy's room, which refreshed and comforted them both.",holiday draw sake earnest wish work hard do brilliant ability boyish ambition call exercise delight one gain ground seem likely more dispute palm rejoice more gladden heart tell day have long visit sick boy room refresh comfort 
48,"In other respects, too, Eric seemed to be turning over a new leaf. He and Upton, by common consent, had laid aside smoking, and every bad habit or disobedient custom which would have grieved the dying boy, whom they both loved so well. And although Eric's popularity, after the romantic Stack adventure and his chivalrous daring, was at its very zenith,--although he had received a medal and flattering letter from the Humane Society, who had been informed of the transaction by Dr. Rowlands,--although his success both physical and intellectual was higher than ever,--yet the dread of the great loss he was doomed to suffer, and the friendship which was to be snapped, overpowered every other feeling, and his heart was ennobled and purified by contact with his suffering friend.",other respect seem turn new leaf common consent lay smoking bad habit disobedient custom grieve die boy love popularity romantic stack adventure chivalrous dare very zenith receive medal flattering letter humane inform transaction success physical intellectual high dread great loss doom suffer friendship snap overpower other feeling heart ennobl purify contact suffering friend 
49,"It was a June evening, and he and Russell were alone; he had drawn up the blind, and through the open window the summer breeze, pure from the sea and fragrant from the garden, was blowing refreshfully into the sick boy's room. Russell was very, very happy. No doubt, no fear, assailed him; all was peace and trustfulness. Long and earnestly that evening did he talk to Eric, and implore him to shun evil ways, striving to lead him gently to that love of God which was his only support and refuge now. Tearfully and humbly Eric listened, and every now and then the sufferer stopped to pray aloud.",evening alone draw blind open window summer breeze pure sea fragrant garden blow sick boy room happy fear assail peace trustfulness long evening talk implore shun evil way striving lead love only support refuge listen sufferer stop pray 
50,"""Good night, Eric,"" he said, ""I am tired, _so_ tired. I hope we shall meet again; I shall give you my desk and all my books, Eric, except a few for Horace, Owen, Duncan, and Monty. And my watch, that dear watch your mother, _my_ mother, gave me, I shall leave to Rose as a remembrance of us both. Good night, brother.""",good night say tired tired hope meet give desk book few watch dear watch mother mother give leave remembrance good night brother 
51,"A little before ten that night Eric was again summoned with Upton and Montagu to Russell's bedside. He was sinking fast; and as he had but a short time to live, he expressed a desire to see them, though he could see no others.",little night summon bedside sink have short time live express desire see see other 
52,"They came, and were amazed to see how bright the dying boy looked. They received his last farewells--he would die that night. Sweetly he blessed them, and made them promise to avoid all evil, and read the Bible, and pray to God. But he had only strength to speak at intervals. Mr. Rose, too, was there; it seemed as though he held the boy by the hand, as fearlessly now, yea, joyously, he entered the waters of the dark river.",come amaze see bright die boy look receive last farewell die night bless make promise avoid evil read pray have strength speak interval seem hold boy hand enter water dark river 
53,"""Oh, I should _so_ like to stay with you, Monty, Horace, dear, dear Eric, but God calls me. I am going--a long way--to my father and mother--and to the light. I shall not be a cripple there--nor be in pain."" His words grew slow and difficult. ""God bless you, dear fellows; God bless you, dear Eric; I am going--to God.""",_so_ like stay dear dear call go long way father mother light cripple pain word grow slow difficult bless dear fellow bless dear go 
54,"He sighed very gently; there was a slight sound in his throat, and he was dead. A terrible scene of boyish anguish followed, as they kissed again and again the lifeless brow. But quietly, calmly, Mr. Rose checked them, and they knelt down with streaming eyes while he prayed.",sigh be slight sound throat dead terrible scene boyish anguish follow kiss lifeless brow check knolt stream eye pray
