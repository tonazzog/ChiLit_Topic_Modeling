2,"All that afternoon we travelled along the magnificent roadway, which trended steadily in a north-westerly direction. Infadoos and Scragga walked with us, but their followers marched about one hundred paces ahead.",afternoon travel magnificent roadway trend north westerly direction walk follower march pace 
3,"""Infadoos,"" I said at length, ""who made this road?""",infadoos say length make road 
4,"""It was made, my lord, of old time, none know how or when, not even the wise woman Gagool, who has lived for generations. We are not old enough to remember its making. None can fashion such roads now, but the king suffers no grass to grow upon it.""",make lord old time know wise woman live generation old remember making fashion such road king suffer grass grow 
5,"""And whose are the writings on the wall of the caves through which we have passed on the road?"" I asked, referring to the Egyptian-like sculptures that we had seen.",writing wall cave pass road ask refer egyptian like sculpture see

7,"""When did the Kukuana people come into this country?""",person come country 
8,"""My lord, the race came down here like the breath of a storm ten thousand thousand moons ago, from the great lands which lie there beyond,"" and he pointed to the north. ""They could travel no further because of the high mountains which ring in the land, so say the old voices of our fathers that have descended to us the children, and so says Gagool, the wise woman, the smeller out of witches,"" and again he pointed to the snow-clad peaks. ""The country, too, was good, so they settled here and grew strong and powerful, and now our numbers are like the sea sand, and when Twala the king calls up his regiments their plumes cover the plain so far as the eye of man can reach.""",lord race come breath storm moon great land lie point north travel high mountain ring land say old voice father descend child say wise woman smeller witch point snow clad peak country good settle grow strong powerful number sea sand king call regiment plume cover plain eye man reach 
9,"""And if the land is walled in with mountains, who is there for the regiments to fight with?""",land wall mountain regiment fight 
10,"""Nay, my lord, the country is open there towards the north, and now and again warriors sweep down upon us in clouds from a land we know not, and we slay them. It is the third part of the life of a man since there was a war. Many thousands died in it, but we destroyed those who came to eat us up. So since then there has been no war.""",lord country open north warrior sweep cloud land know slay third part life man be war many thousand die destroy come eat be war 
11,"""Your warriors must grow weary of resting on their spears, Infadoos.""",warrior grow weary rest spear 
12,"""My lord, there was one war, just after we destroyed the people that came down upon us, but it was a civil war; dog ate dog.""",lord be war destroy person come civil war dog eat dog 
13,"""How was that?""",
14,"""My lord the king, my half-brother, had a brother born at the same birth, and of the same woman. It is not our custom, my lord, to suffer twins to live; the weaker must always die. But the mother of the king hid away the feebler child, which was born the last, for her heart yearned over it, and that child is Twala the king. I am his younger brother, born of another wife.""",lord king half brother have brother bear same birth same woman custom lord suffer twin live weak die mother king hide feebler child bear last heart yearn child king young brother bear wife 
15,"""Well?""",
16,"""My lord, Kafa, our father, died when we came to manhood, and my brother Imotu was made king in his place, and for a space reigned and had a son by his favourite wife. When the babe was three years old, just after the great war, during which no man could sow or reap, a famine came upon the land, and the people murmured because of the famine, and looked round like a starved lion for something to rend. Then it was that Gagool, the wise and terrible woman, who does not die, made a proclamation to the people, saying, 'The king Imotu is no king.' And at the time Imotu was sick with a wound, and lay in his kraal not able to move.",lord father die come manhood brother make king place space reign have son favourite wife babe year old great war man sow reap famine come land person murmure famine look starve lion rend wise terrible woman die make proclamation person say king king time sick wound lay kraal able move 
17,"""Then Gagool went into a hut and led out Twala, my half-brother, and twin brother to the king, whom she had hidden among the caves and rocks since he was born, and stripping the '_moocha_' (waist-cloth) off his loins, showed the people of the Kukuanas the mark of the sacred snake coiled round his middle, wherewith the eldest son of the king is marked at birth, and cried out loud, 'Behold your king whom I have saved for you even to this day!'",go hut lead half brother twin brother king hide cave rock bear stripp waist cloth loin show person mark sacred snake coiled middle old son king mark birth cry king save day 
18,"""Now the people being mad with hunger, and altogether bereft of reason and the knowledge of truth, cried out--'_The king! The king!_' but I knew that it was not so, for Imotu my brother was the elder of the twins, and our lawful king. Then just as the tumult was at its height Imotu the king, though he was very sick, crawled from his hut holding his wife by the hand, and followed by his little son Ignosi--that is, by interpretation, the Lightning.",person mad hunger bereft reason knowledge truth cry king king know brother elder twin lawful king tumult height king sick crawl hut hold wife hand follow little son interpretation 
19,"""'What is this noise?' he asked. 'Why cry ye _The king! The king!_'",noise ask cry king king 
20,"""Then Twala, his twin brother, born of the same woman, and in the same hour, ran to him, and taking him by the hair, stabbed him through the heart with his knife. And the people being fickle, and ever ready to worship the rising sun, clapped their hands and cried, '_Twala is king!_ Now we know that Twala is king!'""",twin brother bear same woman same hour run take hair stab heart knife person fickle ready worship rise sun clapp hand cry king know king 
21,"""And what became of Imotu's wife and her son Ignosi? Did Twala kill them too?""",become wife son kill 
22,"""Nay, my lord. When she saw that her lord was dead the queen seized the child with a cry and ran away. Two days afterward she came to a kraal very hungry, and none would give her milk or food, now that her lord the king was dead, for all men hate the unfortunate. But at nightfall a little child, a girl, crept out and brought her corn to eat, and she blessed the child, and went on towards the mountains with her boy before the sun rose again, and there she must have perished, for none have seen her since, nor the child Ignosi.""",lord see lord dead queen seize child cry run day come kraal hungry give milk food lord king dead man hate unfortunate nightfall little child girl creep bring corn eat bless child go mountain boy sun rise perish see child 
23,"""Then if this child Ignosi had lived he would be the true king of the Kukuana people?""",child live true king person 
24,"""That is so, my lord; the sacred snake is round his middle. If he lives he is king; but, alas! he is long dead.""",lord sacred snake middle live king dead 
25,"""See, my lord,"" and Infadoos pointed to a vast collection of huts surrounded by a fence, which was in its turn encircled by a great ditch, that lay on the plain beneath us. ""That is the kraal where the wife of Imotu was last seen with the child Ignosi. It is there that we shall sleep to-night, if, indeed,"" he added doubtfully, ""my lords sleep at all upon this earth.""",see lord point vast collection hut surround fence turn encircle great ditch lay plain kraal wife see child sleep night add lord sleep earth 
26,"""When we are among the Kukuanas, my good friend Infadoos, we do as the Kukuanas do,"" I said majestically, and turned round quickly to address Good, who was tramping along sullenly behind, his mind fully occupied with unsatisfactory attempts to prevent his flannel shirt from flapping in the evening breeze. To my astonishment I butted into Umbopa, who was walking along immediately behind me, and very evidently had been listening with the greatest interest to my conversation with Infadoos. The expression on his face was most curious, and gave me the idea of a man who was struggling with partial success to bring something long ago forgotten back into his mind.",good friend do do say turn address good tramp mind occupy unsatisfactory attempt prevent flannel shirt flap evening breeze astonishment but walk listen great interest conversation expression face curious give idea man struggle partial success bring forget mind 
27,"All this while we had been pressing on at a good rate towards the undulating plain beneath us. The mountains we had crossed now loomed high above our heads, and Sheba's Breasts were veiled modestly in diaphanous wreaths of mist. As we went the country grew more and more lovely. The vegetation was luxuriant, without being tropical; the sun was bright and warm, but not burning; and a gracious breeze blew softly along the odorous slopes of the mountains. Indeed, this new land was little less than an earthly paradise; in beauty, in natural wealth, and in climate I have never seen its like. The Transvaal is a fine country, but it is nothing to Kukuanaland.",press good rate undulate plain mountain cross loom head breast veil diaphanous wreath mist go country grow lovely vegetation luxuriant tropical sun bright warm burn gracious breeze blow odorous slope mountain new land little less earthly paradise beauty natural wealth climate see fine country 
28,"So soon as we started Infadoos had despatched a runner to warn the people of the kraal, which, by the way, was in his military command, of our arrival. This man had departed at an extraordinary speed, which Infadoos informed me he would keep up all the way, as running was an exercise much practised among his people.",start despatch runner warn person kraal way military command arrival man depart extraordinary speed inform keep way run exercise practise person 
29,The result of this message now became apparent. When we arrived within two miles of the kraal we could see that company after company of men were issuing from its gates and marching towards us.,result message become apparent arrive mile kraal see company company man issue gate march 
30,"Sir Henry laid his hand upon my arm, and remarked that it looked as though we were going to meet with a warm reception. Something in his tone attracted Infadoos' attention.",lay hand arm remark look go meet warm reception tone attract attention 
31,"""Let not my lords be afraid,"" he said hastily, ""for in my breast there dwells no guile. This regiment is one under my command, and comes out by my orders to greet you.""",let lord afraid say breast dwell guile regiment command come order greet 
32,"I nodded easily, though I was not quite easy in my mind.",nod easy mind 
33,"About half a mile from the gates of this kraal is a long stretch of rising ground sloping gently upwards from the road, and here the companies formed. It was a splendid sight to see them, each company about three hundred strong, charging swiftly up the rise, with flashing spears and waving plumes, to take their appointed place. By the time we reached the slope twelve such companies, or in all three thousand six hundred men, had passed out and taken up their positions along the road.",mile gate kraal long stretch rise ground slope road company form splendid sight see company strong charge rise flash spear wave plume take appoint place time reach slope such company man pass take position road 
34,"Presently we came to the first company, and were able to gaze in astonishment on the most magnificent set of warriors that I have ever seen. They were all men of mature age, mostly veterans of about forty, and not one of them was under six feet in height, whilst many stood six feet three or four. They wore upon their heads heavy black plumes of Sakaboola feathers, like those which adorned our guides. About their waists and beneath the right knees were bound circlets of white ox tails, while in their left hands they carried round shields measuring about twenty inches across. These shields are very curious. The framework is made of an iron plate beaten out thin, over which is stretched milk-white ox-hide.",come first company able gaze astonishment magnificent set warrior see man mature age veteran foot height many stand foot wear head heavy black plume feather adorn guide waist right knee bind circlet white ox tail left hand carry round shield measure inch shield curious framework make iron plate beat thin stretch milk white ox hide 
35,"The weapons that each man bore were simple, but most effective, consisting of a short and very heavy two-edged spear with a wooden shaft, the blade being about six inches across at the widest part. These spears are not used for throwing but like the Zulu ""_bangwan_,"" or stabbing assegai, are for close quarters only, when the wound inflicted by them is terrible. In addition to his _bangwan_ every man carried three large and heavy knives, each knife weighing about two pounds. One knife was fixed in the ox-tail girdle, and the other two at the back of the round shield. These knives, which are called ""_tollas_"" by the Kukuanas, take the place of the throwing assegai of the Zulus. The Kukuana warriors can cast them with great accuracy to a distance of fifty yards, and it is their custom on charging to hurl a volley of them at the enemy as they come to close quarters.",weapon man bear simple effective consist short heavy edged spear wooden shaft blade inch wide part spear use throw _bangwan_ stabbing assegai close quarter wound inflict terrible addition _bangwan_ man carry large heavy knife knife weigh pound knife fix ox tail girdle other back round shield knife call take place throw assegai warrior cast great accuracy distance yard custom charge hurl volley enemy come close quarter 
36,"Each company remained still as a collection of bronze statues till we were opposite to it, when at a signal given by its commanding officer, who, distinguished by a leopard skin cloak, stood some paces in front, every spear was raised into the air, and from three hundred throats sprang forth with a sudden roar the royal salute of ""_Koom_."" Then, so soon as we had passed, the company formed up behind us and followed us towards the kraal, till at last the whole regiment of the ""Greys""--so called from their white shields--the crack corps of the Kukuana people, was marching in our rear with a tread that shook the ground.",company remain collection bronze statue opposite signal give commanding officer distinguish leopard skin cloak stand pace front spear raise air throat spring sudden roar royal salute pass company form follow kraal last whole regiment call white shield crack corps person march rear tread shake ground 
37,"At length, branching off from Solomon's Great Road, we came to the wide fosse surrounding the kraal, which is at least a mile round, and fenced with a strong palisade of piles formed of the trunks of trees. At the gateway this fosse is spanned by a primitive drawbridge, which was let down by the guard to allow us to pass in. The kraal is exceedingly well laid out. Through the centre runs a wide pathway intersected at right angles by other pathways so arranged as to cut the huts into square blocks, each block being the quarters of a company. The huts are dome-shaped, and built, like those of the Zulus, of a framework of wattle, beautifully thatched with grass; but, unlike the Zulu huts, they have doorways through which men could walk. Also they are much larger, and surrounded by a verandah about six feet wide, beautifully paved with powdered lime trodden hard.",length branch great come wide fosse surround kraal least mile fence strong palisade pile form trunk tree gateway fosse span primitive drawbridge let guard allow pass kraal lay centre run wide pathway intersect right angle other pathway arrange cut hut square block block quarter company hut dome shape build framework wattle thatch grass hut have doorway man walk large surround verandah foot wide paved powder lime trodd 
38,"All along each side of this wide pathway that pierces the kraal were ranged hundreds of women, brought out by curiosity to look at us. These women, for a native race, are exceedingly handsome. They are tall and graceful, and their figures are wonderfully fine. The hair, though short, is rather curly than woolly, the features are frequently aquiline, and the lips are not unpleasantly thick, as is the case among most African races. But what struck us most was their exceedingly quiet and dignified air. They were as well-bred in their way as the _habituées_ of a fashionable drawing-room, and in this respect they differ from Zulu women and their cousins the Masai who inhabit the district beyond Zanzibar. Their curiosity had brought them out to see us, but they allowed no rude expressions of astonishment or savage criticism to pass their lips as we trudged wearily in front of them. Not even when old Infadoos with a surreptitious motion of the hand pointed out the crowning wonder of poor Good's ""beautiful white legs,"" did they suffer the feeling of intense admiration which evidently mastered their minds to find expression. They fixed their dark eyes upon this new and snowy loveliness, for, as I think I have said, Good's skin is exceedingly white, and that was all. But it was quite enough for Good, who is modest by nature.",side wide pathway pierce kraal rang hundred woman bring curiosity look woman native race handsome tall graceful figure fine hair short curly feature aquiline lip thick case most african race strike most quiet dignified air breed way _habituées_ fashionable draw room respect differ woman cousin inhabit district curiosity bring see allow rude expression astonishment savage criticism pass lip trudge front old surreptitious motion hand point crown wonder poor beautiful white leg suffer feeling intense admiration master mind find expression fix dark eye new snowy loveliness think say skin white enough modest nature 
39,"When we reached the centre of the kraal, Infadoos halted at the door of a large hut, which was surrounded at a distance by a circle of smaller ones.",reach centre kraal halt door large hut surround distance circle small one 
40,"""Enter, Sons of the Stars,"" he said, in a magniloquent voice, ""and deign to rest awhile in our humble habitations. A little food shall be brought to you, so that ye may have no need to draw your belts tight from hunger; some honey and some milk, and an ox or two, and a few sheep; not much, my lords, but still a little food.""",enter say magniloquent voice de rest humble habitation little food bring have need draw belt tight hunger honey milk ox few sheep much lord little food 
41,"""It is good,"" said I. ""Infadoos; we are weary with travelling through realms of air; now let us rest.""",good say weary travel realm air let rest 
42,"Accordingly we entered the hut, which we found amply prepared for our comfort. Couches of tanned skins were spread for us to lie on, and water was placed for us to wash in.",enter hut find prepare comfort couch tanned skin spread lie water place wash 
43,"Presently we heard a shouting outside, and stepping to the door, saw a line of damsels bearing milk and roasted mealies, and honey in a pot. Behind these were some youths driving a fat young ox. We received the gifts, and then one of the young men drew the knife from his girdle and dexterously cut the ox's throat. In ten minutes it was dead, skinned, and jointed. The best of the meat was then cut off for us, and the rest, in the name of our party, I presented to the warriors round us, who took it and distributed the ""white lords' gift.""",hear shouting step door see line damsel bear milk roast mealy honey pot youth drive fat young ox receive gift young man draw knife girdle cut ox throat minute dead skinned joint good meat cut rest name party present warrior take distribute white lord gift 
44,"Umbopa set to work, with the assistance of an extremely prepossessing young woman, to boil our portion in a large earthenware pot over a fire which was built outside the hut, and when it was nearly ready we sent a message to Infadoos, and asked him and Scragga, the king's son, to join us.",set work assistance prepossessing young woman boil portion large earthenware pot fire build hut ready send message ask king son join 
45,"Presently they came, and sitting down upon little stools, of which there were several about the hut, for the Kukuanas do not in general squat upon their haunches like the Zulus, they helped us to get through our dinner. The old gentleman was most affable and polite, but it struck me that the young one regarded us with doubt. Together with the rest of the party, he had been overawed by our white appearance and by our magic properties; but it seemed to me that, on discovering that we ate, drank, and slept like other mortals, his awe was beginning to wear off, and to be replaced by a sullen suspicion--which made me feel rather uncomfortable.",come sit little stool be several hut general squat haunch help get dinner old gentleman affable polite strike young one regard doubt rest party overaw white appearance magic property seem discover eat drink sleep other mortal awe begin wear replace sullen suspicion make feel uncomfortable 
46,"In the course of our meal Sir Henry suggested to me that it might be well to try to discover if our hosts knew anything of his brother's fate, or if they had ever seen or heard of him; but, on the whole, I thought that it would be wiser to say nothing of the matter at this time. It was difficult to explain a relative lost from ""the Stars.""",course meal suggest well try discover host know brother fate see hear whole think wise say matter time difficult explain relative lose 
47,"After supper we produced our pipes and lit them; a proceeding which filled Infadoos and Scragga with astonishment. The Kukuanas were evidently unacquainted with the divine delights of tobacco-smoke. The herb is grown among them extensively; but, like the Zulus, they use it for snuff only, and quite failed to identify it in its new form.",supper produce pipe light proceeding fill astonishment unacquaint divine delight tobacco smoke herb grow use snuff fail identify new form 
48,"Presently I asked Infadoos when we were to proceed on our journey, and was delighted to learn that preparations had been made for us to leave on the following morning, messengers having already departed to inform Twala the king of our coming.",ask proceed journey delighted learn preparation make leave follow morning messenger depart inform king come 
49,"It appeared that Twala was at his principal place, known as Loo, making ready for the great annual feast which was to be held in the first week of June. At this gathering all the regiments, with the exception of certain detachments left behind for garrison purposes, are brought up and paraded before the king; and the great annual witch-hunt, of which more by-and-by, is held.",appear principal place know make ready great annual feast hold first week gathering regiment exception certain detachment leave garrison purpose bring parade king great annual witch hunt more hold 
50,"We were to start at dawn; and Infadoos, who was to accompany us, expected that we should reach Loo on the night of the second day, unless we were detained by accident or by swollen rivers.",start dawn accompany expect reach night second day detain accident swollen river 
51,"When they had given us this information our visitors bade us good-night; and, having arranged to watch turn and turn about, three of us flung ourselves down and slept the sweet sleep of the weary, whilst the fourth sat up on the look-out for possible treachery.",give information visitor bid good night arrange watch turn turn flung sleep sweet sleep weary fourth sit look possible treachery
