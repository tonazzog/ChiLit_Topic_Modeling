1,CHAPTER III. The old gentleman.,old gentleman 
2," After the adventure of Peter’s Coal-mine, it seemed well to the children to keep away from the station--but they did not, they could not, keep away from the railway. They had lived all their lives in a street where cabs and omnibuses rumbled by at all hours, and the carts of butchers and bakers and candlestick makers (I never saw a candlestick-maker’s cart; did you?) might occur at any moment. Here in the deep silence of the sleeping country the only things that went by were the trains. They seemed to be all that was left to link the children to the old life that had once been theirs. Straight down the hill in front of Three Chimneys the daily passage of their six feet began to mark a path across the crisp, short turf. They began to know the hours when certain trains passed, and they gave names to them. The 9.15 up was called the Green Dragon. The 10.7 down was the Worm of Wantley. The midnight town express, whose shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their dreams to hear, was the Fearsome Fly-by-night. Peter got up once, in chill starshine, and, peeping at it through his curtains, named it on the spot.",adventure seem child keep station keep railway live life street cab omnibuse rumble hour cart butcher baker candlestick maker see candlestick maker cart occur moment deep silence sleeping country only thing go train seem leave link child old life hill front daily passage foot begin mark path crisp short turf begin know hour certain train pass give name call green midnight town express shriek rush wake dream hear fearsome night get chill starshine peep curtain name spot 
3,"It was by the Green Dragon that the old gentleman travelled. He was a very nice-looking old gentleman, and he looked as if he were nice, too, which is not at all the same thing. He had a fresh-coloured, clean-shaven face and white hair, and he wore rather odd-shaped collars and a top-hat that wasn’t exactly the same kind as other people’s. Of course the children didn’t see all this at first. In fact the first thing they noticed about the old gentleman was his hand.",green old gentleman travel nice look old gentleman look nice same thing have fresh coloured clean shaven face white hair wear odd shape collar top hat same kind other person course child see first fact first thing notice old gentleman hand 
4,"It was one morning as they sat on the fence waiting for the Green Dragon, which was three and a quarter minutes late by Peter’s Waterbury watch that he had had given him on his last birthday.",morning sit fence wait green quarter minute watch give last birthday 
5,"“The Green Dragon’s going where Father is,” said Phyllis; “if it were a really real dragon, we could stop it and ask it to take our love to Father.”",green go father say real dragon stop ask take love 
6,"“Dragons don’t carry people’s love,” said Peter; “they’d be above it.”",dragon carry person love say 
7,"“Yes, they do, if you tame them thoroughly first. They fetch and carry like pet spaniels,” said Phyllis, “and feed out of your hand. I wonder why Father never writes to us.”",tame fetch carry pet spaniel say feed hand wonder write

9,"“I say,” Phyllis suggested, “let’s all wave to the Green Dragon as it goes by. If it’s a magic dragon, it’ll understand and take our loves to Father. And if it isn’t, three waves aren’t much. We shall never miss them.”",say suggest let wave green go magic dragon understand take love father wave much miss 
10,"So when the Green Dragon tore shrieking out of the mouth of its dark lair, which was the tunnel, all three children stood on the railing and waved their pocket-handkerchiefs without stopping to think whether they were clean handkerchiefs or the reverse. They were, as a matter of fact, very much the reverse.",green tore shriek mouth dark lair tunnel child stand rail wave pocket handkerchief stop think clean handkerchief reverse matter fact reverse 
11,And out of a first-class carriage a hand waved back. A quite clean hand. It held a newspaper. It was the old gentleman’s hand.,first class carriage hand wave clean hand hold newspaper old gentleman hand 
12,After this it became the custom for waves to be exchanged between the children and the 9.15.,become custom wave exchange child 
13,"And the children, especially the girls, liked to think that perhaps the old gentleman knew Father, and would meet him ‘in business,’ wherever that shady retreat might be, and tell him how his three children stood on a rail far away in the green country and waved their love to him every morning, wet or fine.",child girl like think old gentleman know meet business shady retreat tell child stand rail green country wave love morning wet fine 
14,"For they were now able to go out in all sorts of weather such as they would never have been allowed to go out in when they lived in their villa house. This was Aunt Emma’s doing, and the children felt more and more that they had not been quite fair to this unattractive aunt, when they found how useful were the long gaiters and waterproof coats that they had laughed at her for buying for them.",able go sort weather such allow go live villa house do child feel fair unattractive aunt find useful long gaiter waterproof coat laugh buy 
15,"Mother, all this time, was very busy with her writing. She used to send off a good many long blue envelopes with stories in them--and large envelopes of different sizes and colours used to come to her. Sometimes she would sigh when she opened them and say:--",mother time busy writing use send good many long blue envelope story large envelope different size colour use come sigh open say 
16,"“Another story come home to roost. Oh, dear, Oh, dear!” and then the children would be very sorry.",story come roost dear dear child sorry 
17,"But sometimes she would wave the envelope in the air and say:--“Hooray, hooray. Here’s a sensible Editor. He’s taken my story and this is the proof of it.”",wave envelope air say hooray sensible editor take story proof 
18,"At first the children thought ‘the Proof’ meant the letter the sensible Editor had written, but they presently got to know that the proof was long slips of paper with the story printed on them.",first child think proof mean letter sensible editor write get know proof long slip paper story print 
19,Whenever an Editor was sensible there were buns for tea.,editor sensible be bun tea 
20,"One day Peter was going down to the village to get buns to celebrate the sensibleness of the Editor of the Children’s Globe, when he met the Station Master.",day go village get bun celebrate sensibleness meet 
21,"Peter felt very uncomfortable, for he had now had time to think over the affair of the coal-mine. He did not like to say “Good morning” to the Station Master, as you usually do to anyone you meet on a lonely road, because he had a hot feeling, which spread even to his ears, that the Station Master might not care to speak to a person who had stolen coals. ‘Stolen’ is a nasty word, but Peter felt it was the right one. So he looked down, and said Nothing.",feel uncomfortable have time think affair coal like say good morning master do meet lonely road have hot feeling spread ear care speak person steal coal nasty word feel right one look say 
22,"It was the Station Master who said “Good morning” as he passed by. And Peter answered, “Good morning.” Then he thought:--",say good morning pass answer good morning think 
23,"“Perhaps he doesn’t know who I am by daylight, or he wouldn’t be so polite.”",know daylight polite 
24,"And he did not like the feeling which thinking this gave him. And then before he knew what he was going to do he ran after the Station Master, who stopped when he heard Peter’s hasty boots crunching the road, and coming up with him very breathless and with his ears now quite magenta-coloured, he said:--",like feeling think give know go do run stop hear hasty boot crunch road come breathless ear magenta coloured say 
25,“I don’t want you to be polite to me if you don’t know me when you see me.”,want polite know see

30,"“I thought you were all so poor,” said the Station Master.",think poor say

37,"“Thank you,” said Peter. “I’m very glad it’s all straightened out between us.” And he went on across the canal bridge to the village to get the buns, feeling more comfortable in his mind than he had felt since the hand of the Station Master had fastened on his collar that night among the coals.",thank say glad straighten go canal bridge village get bun feel comfortable mind feel hand fasten collar night coal

42,“After the coals?” repeated Phyllis. “Stop a minute--my bootlace is undone again.”,coal repeat stop minute bootlace undone

44,"Phyllis did up her bootlace and went on in silence, but her shoulders shook, and presently a fat tear fell off her nose and splashed on the metal of the railway line. Bobbie saw it.",do bootlace go silence shoulder shake fat tear fall nose splash metal railway line see

51,"“You had my last one,” said Phyllis, indignantly, “to tie up the rabbit-hutch door with. But you’re very ungrateful. It’s quite right what it says in the poetry book about sharper than a serpent it is to have a toothless child--but it means ungrateful when it says toothless. Miss Lowe told me so.”",have last one say tie rabbit hutch door ungrateful right say poetry book sharper serpent have toothless child mean ungrateful say toothless tell

He was a worthy man and seemed never tired of answering the questions that begin with “Why--” which many people in higher ranks of life often seem weary of.,reach station spend joyous hour worthy man seem tired answer question begin many person high rank life seem weary

There was an old lady once--someone kidded her on it was a refreshment-room bell, and she used it improper, not being in danger of her life, though hungry, and when the train stopped and the guard came along expecting to find someone weltering in their last moments, she says, ‘Oh, please, Mister, I’ll take a glass of stout and a bath bun,’ she says.

As he did not happen to have a green leather note-book with silver corners, the Porter gave him a yellow envelope and on it he noted:--",feel take number son wholesale stationer happen have green leather note book silver corner give yellow envelope note

82,"“No one,” she said at last, “ever loved anyone more than my mother loved me.”",say last love more mother love 
83,"Then she was quiet again, and Bobbie kicked Phyllis hard under the table, because Bobbie understood a little bit the thoughts that were making Mother so quiet--the thoughts of the time when Mother was a little girl and was all the world to HER mother. It seems so easy and natural to run to Mother when one is in trouble. Bobbie understood a little how people do not leave off running to their mothers when they are in trouble even when they are grown up, and she thought she knew a little what it must be to be sad, and have no mother to run to any more.",quiet kick table understand little bit thought make mother quiet thought time mother little girl world mother seem easy natural run mother trouble understand little person leave run mother trouble grow think know little sad have mother run more

But she remembered about when she was a little girl herself, and she did say it--and neither her own children nor you nor any other children in the world could ever understand exactly what it cost her to do it. Only some few of you, like Bobbie, may understand a very little bit.",say say think say remember little girl say own child other child world understand cost do few understand little bit

And will you get a basin and sponge my hands?”",nonsense say mother lay bed eye bright bead afford rubbish tell boil pound scrag end neck dinner have broth like more water love get basin sponge hand

108,"They did think. And presently they talked. And later, when Bobbie had gone up to sit with Mother in case she wanted anything, the other two were very busy with scissors and a white sheet, and a paint brush, and the pot of Brunswick black that Mrs. Viney used for grates and fenders. They did not manage to do what they wished, exactly, with the first sheet, so they took another out of the linen cupboard.

Mother talked to herself a good deal, but it did not seem to mean anything.

The old gentleman looked out, too, and at first he too saw nothing more unusual than the gravelled platform and the sunshine and the wallflowers and forget-me-nots in the station borders. It was only just as the train was beginning to puff and pull itself together to start again that he saw Phyllis.
