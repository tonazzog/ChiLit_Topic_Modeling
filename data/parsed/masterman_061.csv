1,CHAPTER 61.,
2,"As they could have a very good view of the canoes from where the old house stood, Ready examined them with his glass every time that he returned from rolling up a cask to the stockade.  Every one worked hard; even Mrs Seagrave did all she could, either assisting in rolling the casks, or carrying up what she was able to lift.  In an hour they had got into the stockade all that they most cared for, and the canoes were still about six or seven miles off.",have good view canoe old house stand ready examine glass time return roll cask stockade one work do assist roll cask carry able lift hour get stockade care canoe mile 
3,"""We have a good hour before they arrive, sir,"" said Ready, ""and even then the reefs will puzzle them not a little; I doubt if they are disembarked under two hours.  We have plenty of time for all we wish to do.  Juno, go for the wheels, and William, come down with the spear, and we will have some of the turtle into the stockade.  Mr Seagrave, I do not require your assistance, so if you will have the kindness to get out the muskets, and examine the flints, it will be as well.""",have good hour arrive sir say ready reef puzzle little doubt disembark hour have plenty time wish do go wheel come spear have turtle stockade require assistance have kindness get musket examine flint 
4,"""Yes; and then you have to load them,"" replied Mrs Seagrave.  ""Juno and I can do that at all events, ready for you to fire them.""",have load reply do event ready fire 
5,"""An excellent idea, madam,"" replied Ready.",excellent idea madam reply ready 
6,"In half an hour six turtles were brought up by Juno and William, and then Ready followed them into the stockade.",hour turtle bring ready follow stockade 
7,"They then rolled the casks, and upheaded them by the sides of the stockade, and fixed up deal planks to stand upon, just high enough to enable them to see over the top of the palisades, and to fire at the enemy.  Mrs Seagrave had been shown how to load a musket, and Juno was now taught the same.",roll cask uphead side stockade fix deal plank stand high enable see top palisadd fire enemy show load musket teach same 
8,"""Now, sir, we are all prepared,"" said Ready, ""and Madam and Juno can go and look a little after the children, and get breakfast.""",sir prepare say ready go look little child get breakfast 
9,"As soon as the children were dressed, Mr Seagrave called Ready, who was outside, watching the canoes, and they went to their morning devotions, and prayed heartily for succour in this time of need.  They then breakfasted in haste; for, as may be supposed, they were almost too anxious to eat.",child dress call ready watch canoe go morning devotion pray succour time need breakfast haste suppose anxious eat 
10,"""This suspense is worse than all,"" said Mrs Seagrave.  ""I wish now that they were come.""",suspense bad say wish come 
11,"""Shall I go to Ready and hear his report, my dear?--I will not be away three minutes.""",go ready hear report dear minute 
12,"In a short time Mr Seagrave returned, saying that the canoes were close to the beach, that the savages evidently had a knowledge of the passages through the reefs, as they had steered right in, and had lowered their sails; that Ready and William were on the look-out, but concealed behind the cocoa-nut trees.",short time return say canoe close beach savage have knowledge passage reef steer lower sail ready look out conceal cocoa nut tree 
13,"""I hope they will not stay out too long.""",hope stay 
14,"""No fear of that, my dear Selina; but they had better watch their motions to the last minute.""",fear dear good watch motion last minute 
15,"During this conversation between Mr and Mrs Seagrave within the stockade, William and Ready were watching the motions of the savages, a large portion of whom had landed out of ten of the canoes, and the others were following their example as fast as they could, forcing their way through the reefs.  The savages were all painted, with their war-cloaks and feathers on, and armed with spears and clubs, evidently having come with no peaceable intentions.",conversation stockade watch motion savage large portion land canoe other follow example force way reef savage paint war cloak feather armed spear club come peaceable intention 
16,"William, who had taken the telescope to examine them more minutely, said to Ready, ""What a fierce, cruel set of wretches they appear to be; if they overpower us they will certainly kill us!""",take telescope examine say ready fierce cruel set wretche appear overpower kill 
17,"""Of that there is no doubt, William; but we must fight hard, and not let them overpower us.  Kill us they certainly will, and I am not sure that they may not eat us afterwards; but that is of little consequence.""",be doubt fight let overpower kill sure eat little consequence 
18,"William replied in a determined tone, ""I'll fight as long as I have breath in my body; but, Ready, they are coming up as fast as they can.""",reply determined tone fight have breath body ready come 
19,"""Yes; we must wait no longer.  Come, William.""",wait come 
20,"""I thought I saw another vessel under sail, out away by the garden point, Ready, just as we turned away.""",think see vessel sail garden point ready turn 
21,"""Very likely, sir, a canoe which has separated from the others during the night.  Come, quick, William, they have begun to yell.""",likely sir canoe separate other night come quick begin yell 
22,"Another half-minute, and they arrived at the door of the stockade; they entered, shut the door, and then barricaded it with the cocoa-nut poles which they had fitted to the inner door-posts.",half minute arrive door stockade enter shut door barricade cocoa nut pole fit inner door post
