4," Etheldred had the satisfaction of seeing the Taylors at school on Sunday, but no Halls made their appearance, and, on inquiry, she was told, “Please ma’am, they said they would not come;” so Ethel condemned Granny Hall as “a horrid, vile, false, hypocritical old creature! It was no use having anything more to do with her.”",have satisfaction see school hall make appearance inquiry tell say come condemn horrid vile false hypocritical old creature use have more do 
5,"“Very well,” said Richard; “then I need not speak to my father.”",say speak father 
6,“Ritchie now! you know I meant no such thing!”,know mean such thing 
7,"“You know, it is just what will happen continually.”",know happen 
8,"“Of course there will be failures, but this is so abominable, when they had those nice frocks, and those two beautiful eighteen-penny shawls! There are three shillings out of my pound thrown away!”",course be failure abominable have nice frock beautiful penny shawl be shilling pound throw 
9,“Perhaps there was some reason to prevent them. We will go and see.”,be reason prevent go see 
10,"“We shall only hear some more palavering. I want to have no more to say to--” but here Ethel caught herself up, and began to perceive what a happiness it was that she had not the power of acting on her own impulses.",hear more palavering want have more say catch begin perceive happiness power act own impulse 
11,"The twins and their little brother of two years old were christened in the afternoon, and Flora invited the parents to drink tea in the kitchen, and visit Lucy, while Ethel and Mary each carried a baby upstairs to exhibit to Margaret.",twin little brother year old christen afternoon invite parent drink tea kitchen visit carry baby exhibit 
12,"Richard, in the meantime, had a conversation with John Taylor, and learned a good deal about the district, and the number of the people. At tea, he began to rehearse his information, and the doctor listened with interest, which put Ethel in happy agitation, believing that the moment was come, and Richard seemed to be only waiting for the conclusion of a long tirade against those who ought to do something for the place, when behold! Blanche was climbing on her father’s knee, begging for one of his Sunday stories.",meantime have conversation learn good deal district number person tea begin rehearse information doctor listen interest put happy agitation believe moment come seem wait conclusion long tirade do place climb father knee begg story 
13,"Etheldred was cruelly disappointed, and could not at first rejoice to see her father able again to occupy himself with his little girl. The narration, in his low tones, roused her from her mood of vexation. It was the story of David, which he told in language scriptural and poetical, so pretty and tender in its simplicity, that she could not choose but attend. Ever and anon there was a glance towards Harry, as if he were secretly likening his own “yellow-haired laddie” to the “shepherd boy, ruddy, and of a fair countenance.”",disappointed rejoice see father able occupy little girl narration low tone rouse mood vexation story tell language scriptural poetical pretty tender simplicity choose attend be glance liken own yellow hair laddie shepherd boy ruddy fair countenance 
14,"“So Tom and Blanche,” he concluded, “can you tell me how we may be like the shepherd-boy, David?”",conclude tell shepherd boy 
15,"“There aren’t giants now,” said Tom.",be giant say 
16,"“Wrong is a giant,” said his little sister.",wrong giant say little sister 
17,"“Right, my white May-flower, and what then?”",right white flower 
18,"“We are to fight,” said Tom.",fight say 
19,"“Yes, and mind, the giant with all his armour may be some great thing we have to do: but what did David begin with when he was younger?”",mind giant armour great thing have do begin young 
20,“The lion and the bear.”,lion bear 
21,"“Ay, and minding his sheep. Perhaps little things, now you are little children, may be like the lion and the bear--so kill them off--get rid of them--cure yourself of whining or dawdling, or whatever it be, and mind your sheep well,” said he, smiling sweetly in answer to the children’s earnest looks as they caught his meaning, “and if you do, you will not find it near so hard to deal with your great giant struggle when it comes.”",mind sheep little thing little child lion bear kill get rid cure whining dawdling mind sheep say smile answer child earnest look catch meaning find hard deal great giant struggle come 
22,"Ah! thought Ethel, it suits me as well as the children. I have a great giant on Cocksmoor, and here I am, not allowed to attack him, because, perhaps, I am not minding my sheep, and letting my lion and my bear run loose about the house.",think suit child have great giant allow attack mind sheep let lion bear run house 
23,"She was less impatient this week, partly from the sense of being on probation, and partly because she, in common with all the rest, was much engrossed with Harry’s fate. He came home every day at dinner-time with Norman to ask if Alan Ernescliffe’s letter had come; and at length Mary and Tom met them open-mouthed with the news that Margaret had it in her room.",impatient week sense probation common rest engross fate come day dinner time ask letter come length meet open mouthed news have room 
24,"Thither they hastened. Margaret held it out with a smile of congratulation. “Here it is, Harry; papa said you were to have it, and consider it well, and let him know, when you had taken time. You must do it soberly. It is once for all.”",hasten hold smile congratulation say have consider let know take time do 
25,"Harry’s impetuosity was checked, and he took the letter quietly. His sister put her hand on his shoulder, “Would you mind my kissing you, dear Harry?” and as he threw his arms round her neck, she whispered, “Pray that you may choose right.”",impetuosity check take letter sister put hand shoulder mind kiss dear throw arm neck whisper pray choose right 
26,"He went quietly away, and Norman begged to know what had been Alan Ernescliffe’s advice.",go begg know advice 
27,"“I can scarcely say he gave any direct advice,” said Margaret; “He would not have thought that called for. He said, no doubt there were hardships and temptations, more or less, according to circumstances; but weighing one thing with another, he thought it gave as fair a chance of happiness as other professions, and the discipline and regularity had been very good for himself, as well as for many others he had known. He said, when a man is willing to go wrong there is much to help him, but when he is resolved on doing right, he need not be prevented.”",say give direct advice say think call say doubt be hardship temptation more less accord circumstance weigh thing think give fair chance happiness other profession discipline regularity good many other know say man willing go wrong be much help resolve do right prevent 
28,"“That is what you may say of anything,” said Norman.",say say 
29,"“Just so; and it answered papa’s question, whether it was exposing Harry to more temptation than he must meet with anywhere. That was the reason it was such a comfort to have anyone to write to, who understands it so well.”",answer papa question expose more temptation meet reason comfort have write understand 
30,"“Yes, and knows Harry’s nature.”",know nature 
31,"“He said he had been fortunate in his captains, and had led, on the whole, a happy life at sea; and he thought if it was so with him, Harry was likely to enjoy it more, being of a hardy adventurous nature, and a sailor from choice, not from circumstances.”",say fortunate captain lead whole happy life sea think likely enjoy hardy adventurous nature sailor choice circumstance 
32,“Then he advised for it? I did not think he would; you know he will not let Hector be a sailor.”,advise think know let sailor 
33,"“He told me he thought only a strong natural bent that way made it desirable, and that he believed Hector only wished it from imitation of him. He said too, long ago, that he thought Harry cut out for a sailor.",tell think strong natural bend way make desirable believe wish imitation say think cut sailor 
34,"“A spirited fellow!” said Norman, with a look of saddened pride and approval, not at all like one so near the same age. “He is up to anything, afraid of nothing, he can lick any boy in the school already. It will be worse than ever without him!”",spirit fellow say look sadden pride approval same age afraid lick boy school bad 
35,"“Yes, you will miss your constant follower. He has been your shadow ever since he could walk. But there’s the clock, I must not keep you any longer; good-bye, Norman.”",miss constant follower shadow walk be clock keep good 
36,"Harry gave his brother the letter as soon as they were outside the house, and, while he read it, took his arm and guided him. “Well,” said Norman as he finished.",give brother letter house read take arm guide say finish 
37,"“It is all right,” said Harry; and the two brothers said no more; there was something rising up in their throats at the thought that they had very few more walks to take together to Bishop Whichcote’s school; Norman’s heart was very full at the prospect of another vacancy in his home, and Harry’s was swelling between the ardour of enterprise and the thought of bidding good-bye to each familiar object, and, above all, to the brother who had been his model and admiration from babyhood.",right say brother say more be rise throat thought have few more walk take school heart full prospect vacancy home swell ardour enterprise thought bid good bye familiar object brother model admiration babyhood 
38,"“June!” at length he broke out, “I wish you were going too. I should not mind it half so much if you were.”",length break wish go mind half much 
39,"“Nonsense, Harry! you want to be July after June all your life, do you? You’ll be much more of a man without me.”",nonsense want life more man 
40,"That evening Dr. May called Harry into his study to ask him if his mind was made up; he put the subject fairly before him, and told him not to be deterred from choosing what he thought would be for the best by any scruples about changing his mind. “We shall not think a bit the worse of you; better now, than too late.”",evening call study ask mind make put subject tell deterre choose think good scruple change mind think bit bad late 
41,"There was that in his face and tone that caused Harry to say, in a stifled voice, “I did not think you would care so much, papa; I won’t go, if you do.”",be face tone cause say stifle voice think care much papa go 
42,"Dr. May put his hand on his shoulder, and was silent. Harry felt a strange mixture of hope and fear, joy and grief, disappointment and relief. “You must not give it up on that account, my dear,” he said at length; “I should not let you see this, if it did not happen at a time when I can’t command myself as I ought. If you were an only son, it might be your duty to stay; being one of many, ‘tis nonsense to make a rout about parting with you. If it is better for you, it is better for all of us; and we shall do very well when you are once fairly gone. Don’t let that influence you for a moment.”",put hand shoulder silent feel strange mixture hope fear joy grief disappointment relief give account dear say length let see happen time command only son duty stay many nonsense make rout part good good do gone let influence moment 
43,"Harry paused, not that he doubted, but he was collecting his energies--“Then, papa, I choose the navy.”",pause doubt collect energy choose navy 
44,"“Then it is done, Harry. You have chosen in a dutiful, unselfish spirit, and I trust it will prosper with you; for I am sure your father’s blessing--aye, and your mother’s too, go with you! Now then,” after a pause, “go and call Richard. I want him to write to Ernescliffe about that naval school. You must take your leave of the Whichcote foundation on Friday. I shall go and give Dr. Hoxton notice tomorrow, and get Tom’s name down instead.”",done choose dutiful unselfish spirit trust prosper sure father blessing mother go pause go call want write naval school take leave foundation go give notice tomorrow get name 
45,"And when the name of Thomas May was set down, Dr. Hoxton expressed his trust that it would pass through the school as free from the slightest blemish as those of Richard, Norman, and Harry May.",name set express trust pass school free slight blemish 
46,"Now that Harry’s destiny was fixed, Ethel began to think of Cocksmoor again, and she accomplished another walk there with Richard, Flora, and Mary, to question Granny Hall about the children’s failure.",destiny fix begin think accomplish walk question child failure 
47,"The old woman’s reply was a tissue of contradictions: the girls were idle hussies, all contrary: they plagued the very life out of her, and she represented herself as using the most frightful threats, if they would not go to school. Breaking every bone in their skin was the least injury she promised them; till Mary, beginning to think her a cruel old woman, took hold of her brother’s coat-tails for protection.",old woman reply tissue contradiction girl idle hussy contrary plague very life represent use frightful threat go school break bone skin least injury promise begin think cruel old woman take hold brother coat tail protection 
48,"“But I am afraid, Mrs. Hall,” said Richard, in that tone which might be either ironical or simple, “if you served them so, they would never be able to get to school at all, poor things.”",afraid say tone ironical simple serve able get school poor thing 
49,"“Bless you, sir, d’ye think I’d ever lay a finger near them; it’s only the way one must talk to children, you see,” said she, patronising his inexperience.",bless sir think lay finger way talk child see say patronise inexperience 
50,"“Perhaps they have found that out,” said Richard. Granny looked much entertained, and laughed triumphantly and shrewdly, “ay, ay, that they have, the lasses--they be sharp enough for anything, that they be. Why, when I tell little Jenny that there’s the black man coming after her, what does she do but she ups and says, ‘Granny, I know ‘tis only the wind in the chimney.’”",find say look entertain laugh have lasse sharp tell little be black man come do up say know wind chimney 
51,"“Then I don’t think it seems to answer,” said Richard. “Just suppose you were to try for once, really punishing them when they won’t obey you, perhaps they would do it next time.”",think seem answer say suppose try punish obey do next time 
52,"“Why, sir, you see I don’t like to take the stick to them; they’ve got no mother, you see, sir.”",sir see like take stick get mother see sir 
53,"Mary thought her a kind grandmother, and came out from behind her brother.",think kind grandmother come brother 
54,"“I think it would be kinder to do it for once. What do you think they will do as they grow older, if you don’t keep them in order when they are little?”",think kind do think do grow old keep order little 
55,"This was foresight beyond Granny Hall, who began to expatiate on the troubles she had undergone in their service, and the excellence of Sam. There was certainly a charm in her manners, for Ethel forgot her charge of ingratitude, the other sisters were perfectly taken with her, nor could they any of them help giving credence to her asseverations that Jenny and Polly should come to school next Sunday.",foresight begin expatiate trouble undergone service excellence be charm manners forget charge ingratitude other sister take help give credence asseveration come school next 
56,"They soon formed another acquaintance; a sharp-faced woman stood in their path, with a little girl in her hand, and arrested them with a low curtsey, and not a very pleasant voice, addressing herself to Flora, who was quite as tall as Richard, and appeared the person of most consequence.",form acquaintance sharp face woman stand path little girl hand arrest low curtsey pleasant voice address tall appear person most consequence 
57,"“If you please, miss, I wanted to speak to you. I have got a little girl here, and I want to send her to school, only I have no shoes for her.”",miss want speak get little girl want send school have shoe 
58,"“Why, surely, if she can run about here on the heath, she can go to school,” said Flora.",run heath go school say 
59,"“Oh! but there is all the other children to point at her. The poor thing would be daunted, you see, miss; if I could but get some friend to give her a pair of shoes, I’d send her in a minute. I want her to get some learning; as I am always saying, I’d never keep her away, if I had but got the clothes to send her in. I never lets her be running on the common, like them Halls, as it’s a shame to see them in nice frocks, as Mrs. Hall got by going hypercriting about.”",be other child point poor thing daunt see miss get friend give pair shoe send minute want get learning say keep have get clothes send let run common hall shame see nice frock get go hypercrite 
60,"“What is your name?” said Richard, cutting her short.",name say cut short 
61,"“Watts, if you please, sir; we heard there was good work up here, sir, and so we came; but I’d never have set foot in it if I had known what a dark heathenish place it is, with never a Gospel minister to come near it,” and a great deal more to the same purpose.",sir hear be good work sir come set foot know dark heathenish place minister come great deal more same purpose 
62,"Mary whispered to Flora something about having outgrown her boots, but Flora silenced her by a squeeze of the hand, and the two friends of Cocksmoor felt a good deal puzzled.",whisper outgrow boot silence squeeze hand friend feel good deal puzzle 
63,"At last Flora said, “You will soon get her clothed if she comes regularly to school on Sundays, for she will be admitted into the club; I will recommend her if she has a good character and comes regularly. Good-morning, Mrs. Watts. Now we must go, or it will be dark before we get home.” And they walked hastily away.",last say get cloth come school admit club recommend have good character come good morning go dark get walk 
64,“Horrid woman!” was Ethel’s exclamation.,horrid woman exclamation 
65,"“But Flora,” said innocent Mary, “why would you not let me give the little girl my boots?”",say innocent let give little girl boot 
66,"“Perhaps I may, if she is good and comes to school, said Flora.",good come school say 
67,"“I think Margaret ought to settle what you do with your boots,” said Richard, not much to Flora’s satisfaction.",think settle do boot say much satisfaction 
68,"“It is the same,” she said. “If I approve, Margaret will not object.”",same say approve object 
69,"“How well you helped us out, Flora,” said Ethel; “I did not know in the least what to say.”",help say know least say 
70,"“It will be the best way of testing her sincerity, said Flora; and at least it will do the child good; but I congratulate you on the promising aspect of Cocksmoor.”",good way test sincerity say least do child good congratulate promising aspect 
71,"“We did not expect to find a perfect place,” said Ethel; “if it were, it would be of no use to go to it.”",expect find perfect place say use go 
72,"Ethel could answer with dignity, but her heart sank at the aspect of what she had undertaken. She knew there would be evil, but she had expected it in a more striking and less disagreeable form.",answer dignity heart sink aspect undertake know be evil expect striking disagreeable form 
73,"That walk certainly made her less impatient, though it did not relax her determination, nor the guard over her lion and bear, which her own good feeling, aided by Margaret’s council, showed her were the greatest hindrances to her doing anything good and great.",walk make impatient relax determination guard lion bear own good feeling aid council show great hindrance do good great 
74,"Though she was obliged to set to work so many principles and reflections to induce herself to wipe a pen, or to sit straight on her chair, that it was like winding up a steam-engine to thread a needle; yet the work was being done--she was struggling with her faults, humbled by them, watching them, and overcoming them.",oblige set work many principle reflection induce wipe pen sit chair wind steam engine thread needle work do struggle fault humble watch overcome 
75,"Flora, meanwhile, was sitting calmly down in the contemplation of the unexpected services she had rendered, confident that her character for energy and excellence was established, believing it herself, and looking back on her childish vanity and love of domineering as long past and conquered. She thought her grown-up character had begun, and was too secure to examine it closely.",sit contemplation unexpected service render confident character energy excellence establish believe look childish vanity love domineer past conquer think grow character begin secure examine
