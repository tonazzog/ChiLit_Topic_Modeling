2," Tony lay there in the dark, overwhelmed by his unusual terror and sorrow, until he heard the voice of old Oliver calling his name feebly. He hurried to him, and found him still beside the bed where Dolly was lying. He had taken off most of her clothes, and put her white nightgown over the rest, that she might sleep warmly in them all the night, for her little hands and feet felt very chilly to his touch. The fire had gone out while they were away, and the grate looked very black and cheerless. The room was in great disorder, just as they had left it, and the gas, which was burning high, cast a cruel glare upon it all. But Tony saw nothing except the dear face of Dolly, resting on one check upon the pillow, with her curly hair tossed about it in confusion, and her open eyes gathering a strange film. Beppo had made his way to her side, and pushed his head under her lifeless little hand, which tried to pat it now and then. Old Oliver was sitting on the bedstead, his eyes fastened upon her, and his whole body trembled violently. Tony sank down upon his knees, and flung his arm over Dolly, as if to save her from the unseen power which threatened to take her away from them.",lay dark overwhelm unusual terror sorrow hear voice old call name hurry find bed lie take most clothes put white nightgown rest sleep night little hand foot feel chilly touch fire go grate look black cheerless room great disorder leave gas burn high cast cruel glare see dear face rest check pillow curly hair toss confusion open eye gather strange film make way side push head lifeless little hand try pat old sit bedstead eye fasten whole body tremble sink knee flung arm save unseen power threaten take

5,"""Where are I going to?"" asked Dolly, very faintly.",go ask 
6,"""You're going to see my Lord and Master,"" he said; ""him as loves little children so, and carries them in his arms, and never lets them be sorrowful or ill or die again.""",go see master say love little child carry arm let sorrowful ill die

8,"""It's a more beautiful place than I can tell,"" answered old Oliver. ""The Lord Jesus gives them light brighter than the sun; and the streets are all of gold, and there are many little children there, who always see the face of their Father.""",beautiful place tell answer old give light bright sun street gold be many little child see face father 
9,"""Dolly's going rere,"" said the little child, solemnly.",go say little child 
10,"She smiled for a minute or two, holding Beppo's ear between her failing fingers, and playing with it. Tony's eyes were dim with tears, yet he could see her clear face clearly through them. What could he do? Was there no one to help?",smile minute hold ear fail finger play eye dim tear see clear face do be help 
11,"""Master, master!"" he cried. ""If the Lord Jesus is here he can save her. Ask him, master.""",master master cry save ask master 
12,"But old Oliver paid no heed to him. For the child who was passing away from him he was all eye and ear, watching and listening as keenly as in his best and strongest days; but he was blind and deaf to everything else around him. Tony's voice could not reach his brain.",old pay heed child pass eye ear watch listen good strong day blind deaf else voice reach brain 
13,"""Will gan-pa come rere?"" whispered the failing and faltering voice of Dolly.",gan pa come whisper fail falter voice 
14,"""Very soon,"" he answered; a radiant smile coming to his face, which made her smile as her eyes caught the glory of it. ""Very, very soon, my little love. You'll be there to meet me when I come.""",answer radiant smile come face make smile eye catch glory little love meet come 
15,"""Dolly'll watch for gan-pa,"" she murmured, with long pauses between the words, which seemed to drop one by one upon Tony's ear; ""and Dolly'll watch at the door for Tony to come home; and she'll fret ever so if he never comes.""",watch gan pa murmure long pause word seem drop ear watch door come fret come 
16,"Tony felt her stir restlessly under his arm, and stretch her tiny limbs upon the bed as if she were very tired, and the languid eyelids drooped slowly till they quite hid her blue eyes, and she sighed softly as children sigh when they fall asleep, weary of their play. Old Oliver laid his shaking hand tenderly upon her head.",feel stir arm stretch tiny limb bed tired languid eyelid droop hide blue eye sigh child sigh fall asleep weary play old lay shaking hand head 
17,"""Dear Lord!"" he said, ""take my little love to thyself. I give her up to thee.""",dear say take little love give 
18,"It seemed to Tony as if a thick mist of darkness fell all about him, and as if he were sinking down, down, very low into some horrible pit where he would never see the light of day again. But by-and-bye he came to himself, and found old Oliver sobbing in short, heavy sobs, and swaying himself to and fro, while Beppo was licking Dolly's hand, and barking with a sharp, quiet bark, as he had been wont to do when he wanted her to play with him. The child's small features were quite still, but there was an awful smile upon them such as there had never been before, and Tony could not bear to look upon it. He crossed her tiny hands lightly over one another upon her breast, and then he lifted Beppo away gently, and drew the bed-clothes about her, so as to hide her smiling face.",seem thick mist darkness fall sink low horrible pit see light day come find old sobb short heavy sob sway for lick hand bark sharp quiet bark wont do want play child small feature be awful smile such be bear look cross tiny hand breast lift draw bed clothes hide smile face 
19,"""Master,"" he cried, ""master, is she gone?""",master cry master gone 
20,"Old Oliver only answered by a deep moan; and Tony put his arm about him, and raised him up.",old answer deep moan put arm raise 
21,"""Come to your own chair, master,"" he said.",come own chair master say 
22,"He yielded to Tony like a child, and seated himself in the chair, where he had so often sat and watched Dolly while he smoked his pipe. The boy put his pipe between his fingers; but he only let it fall to the ground, where it broke into many pieces. Tony did not know what to do, nor where to go for any help.",yield child seat chair sit watch smoke pipe boy put pipe finger let fall ground break many piece know do go help 
23,"""Lord,"" he said, ""if you really love the old master, do something for him; for I don't know whatever to do, now little Dolly's gone.""",say love old master do know do little gone 
24,"He sat down on his old box, staring at Oliver and the motionless form on the bed, with a feeling of despair tugging at his heart. He could scarcely believe it was all true; for it was not very long since--only it seemed like long years--since he had leaped over the counter in his light-heartedness. But he had not sat there many minutes before he heard a distinct, rather loud knock at the shop-door, and he ran hastily to ask who was there.",sit old box stare motionless form bed feeling despair tug heart believe true long seem long year leap counter light heartedness sit many minute hear distinct loud knock shop door run ask 
25,"""Antony,"" said a voice he knew very well, ""I have come with the doctor, to see what we can do for your little girl.""",say voice know come doctor see do little girl 
26,"In an instant Tony opened the door, and as Mr. Ross entered the boy flung his arms round him, and hid his face against him, sobbing bitterly.",instant open door enter boy flung arm hide face sobb 
27,"""Oh! you've come too late,"" he cried, ""you've come too late! Dolly's dead, and I'm afraid the master's going away from me as well. They couldn't take her in, and she died after we had brought her home.""",come late cry come late dead afraid master go take die bring home 
28,"The doctor and Mr. Ross went on into the inner room, and Tony pointed silently to the bed where Dolly lay. Old Oliver roused himself at the sound of strange voices, and, leaning upon Tony's shoulder, he staggered to the bedside, and drew the clothes away from her dear, smiling face.",doctor go inner room point bed lay old rouse sound strange voice lean shoulder stagger bedside draw clothes dear smile face 
29,"""I don't murmur,"" he said. ""My dear Lord can't do anything unkind. He'll come and speak to me presently, and comfort me; but just now I'm deaf and blind, even to him. I've not forgot him, and he hasn't forgot me; but there's a many things ought to be done, and I cannot think what.""",murmur say dear do unkind come speak comfort deaf blind forget forget be many thing ought do think 
30,"""Leave it all to us,"" said Mr. Ross, leading him back to his chair. ""But have you no neighbour you can go and stay with for to-night? You are an old man, and you must not lose your night's sleep.""",leave say lead chair have neighbour go stay night old man lose night sleep 
31,"""No,"" he answered, shaking his head; ""I'd rather stay here in my own place, if I'd a hundred other places to go to. I'm not afraid of my little love,--no, no! When everything is done as ought to be done, I'll lie in my own bed and watch her. It won't be lonesome, as long as she's here.""",answer shake head stay own place other place go afraid little love do ought do lie own bed watch lonesome 
32,"In an hour's time all was settled for that night. A little resting-place had been made for the dead child in a corner of the room, where she lay covered with a coarse white sheet, which was the last one left of those which old Oliver's wife had spun in her girlhood. The old man had given his promise to go to bed when Mr. Ross and the doctor were gone; and he slept lightly, his face turned towards the place where his little love was sleeping. A faint light burnt all night in the room, and Tony, who could not fall asleep, sat in the chimney-corner, with Beppo upon his knees. There was an unutterable, quiet sorrow within him, mingled with a strange awe. That little child, who had played with him, and kissed him only a day since, was already gone into the unseen world, which was so very near to him now, though it had seemed so very far away and so empty before. It must be very near, since she had gone to it so quickly; and it was no longer empty, for Dolly was there; and she had said she would watch at the door till he came home.",hour time settle night little resting place make dead child corner room cover coarse white sheet last one leave old wife spun girlhood old man give promise go bed doctor gone sleep face turn place little love sleep faint light burn night room fall sit chimney corner knee be unutterable quiet sorrow mingle strange awe little child play kiss day go unseen world seem empty go empty say watch door come
