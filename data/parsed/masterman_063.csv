2,"But the moaning of the children was very soon after dusk drowned by the yells of the savages, who, as Ready had prognosticated, now advanced to the night attack.",moan child dusk drown yell savage ready prognosticate advance night attack 
3,"Every part of the stockade was at once assailed, and their attempts now made were to climb into it; a few spears were occasionally thrown, but it was evident that the object was to obtain an entrance by dint of numbers.  It was well that Ready had taken the precaution of nailing the deal planks above the original stockade, or there is little doubt but that the savages would have gained their object; as it was, before the flames of the fire, which Juno had lighted by Ready's order, gave them sufficient light, three or four savages had climbed up and had been shot by William and Mr Seagrave, as they were on the top of the stockade.",part stockade assail attempt make climb few spear throw evident object obtain entrance dint number ready take precaution nail deal plank original stockade be little doubt savage gain object flame fire light order give sufficient light savage climb shoot top stockade 
4,"When the fire burnt brightly, the savages outside were more easily aimed at, and a great many fell in their attempts to get over.  The attack continued more than an hour, when at last, satisfied that they could not succeed, the savages once more withdrew, carrying with them, as before, their dead and wounded.",fire burn savage aim great many fall attempt get attack continue more hour last satisfy succeed savage withdraw carry dead wound 
5,"""I trust that they will now re-embark, and leave the island,"" said Mr Seagrave.",trust re-embark leave island say 
6,"""I only wish they may, sir; it is not at all impossible; but there is no saying.  I have been thinking, Mr Seagrave, that we might be able to ascertain their movements by making a look-out.  You see, sir, that cocoa-nut tree,"" continued Ready, pointing to one of those to which the palisades were fastened, ""is much taller than any of the others: now, by driving spike-nails into the trunk at about a foot apart, we might ascend it with ease, and it would command a view of the whole bay; we then could know what the enemy were about.""",wish sir impossible be saying think able ascertain movement make look see sir cocoa nut tree continue ready point palisadd fasten tall other drive spike nail trunk foot ascend ease command view whole bay know enemy 
7,"""Yes, that is very true; but will not anyone be very much exposed if he climbs up?""",true expose climb 
8,"""No, sir; for you see the cocoa-nut trees are cut down clear of the palisades to such a distance, that no savage could come at all near without being seen by anyone on the look-out, and giving us sufficient time to get down again before he could use his spear.""",sir see cocoa nut tree cut clear palisadd distance savage come see look give sufficient time get use spear 
9,"""I believe that you are right there, Ready; but at all events I would not attempt to do it before daylight, as there may be some of them still lurking underneath the stockade.""",believe right ready event attempt do daylight be lurk stockade 
10,"""Certainly there may be, sir, and therefore until daylight we will not begin.""",be sir daylight begin 
11,"Mr Seagrave then went into the house; Ready desired William to lie down and sleep for two or three hours, as he would watch.  In the morning, when Mr Seagrave came out, he would have a little sleep himself.",go house ready desire lie sleep hour watch morning come have little sleep 
12,"""I can't sleep, Ready.  I'm mad with thirst,"" replied William.",sleep ready mad thirst reply 
13,"""Yes, sir; it's very painful--I feel it myself very much, but what must those poor children feel?  I pity them most.""",sir painful feel poor child feel pity most 
14,"""I pity my mother most, Ready,"" replied William; ""it must be agony to her to witness their sufferings, and not be able to relieve them.""",pity mother most ready reply agony witness suffering able relieve 
15,"""Yes, indeed, it must be terrible, William, to a mother's feelings; but perhaps these savages will be off to-morrow, and then we shall forget our privations.""",terrible mother feeling savage forget privation 
16,"""I trust in God that they may, Ready, but they seem very determined.""",trust ready seem determined 
17,"""Yes, sir; iron is gold to them, and what will civilised men not do for gold?""",sir iron gold civilised man do gold 
18,"In the meantime, Mr Seagrave had gone into the house.  He found the children still crying for water, notwithstanding the coaxing and soothing of Mrs Seagrave, who was shedding tears as she hung over poor little Albert.  Little Caroline only drooped, and said nothing.  Mr Seagrave remained for two or three hours with his wife, assisting her in pacifying the children, and soothing her to the utmost of his power; at last he went out and found old Ready on the watch.",meantime go house find child cry water notwithstand coaxing soothing shed tear hang poor little little droop say remain hour wife assist pacify child soothing utmost power last go find old ready watch 
19,"""Ready, I had rather a hundred times be attacked by these savages and have to defend this place, than be in that house for even five minutes, and witness the sufferings of my wife and children.""",ready have time attack savage have defend place house minute witness suffering wife child 
20,"""I do not doubt it, sir,"" replied Ready; ""but cheer up, and let us hope for the best; I think it very probable that the savages after this second defeat will leave the island.""",doubt sir reply ready cheer let hope good think probable savage second defeat leave island 
21,"""I wish I could think so, Ready; it would make me very happy; but I have come out to take the watch, Ready.  Will you not sleep for a while?""",wish think ready make happy come take watch ready sleep while 
22,"""I will, sir, if you please, take a little sleep.  Call me in two hours; it will then be daylight, and I can go to work, and you can get some repose yourself.""",sir take little sleep call hour daylight go work get repose 
23,"""I am too anxious to sleep; I think so, at least.""",anxious sleep think least 
24,"""William said he was too thirsty to sleep, sir, but, poor fellow, he is now fast enough.""",say thirsty sleep sir poor fellow fast 
25,"""I trust that boy will be spared, Ready.""",trust boy spare ready 
26,"""I hope so too; but we are all in the hands of the Almighty.""",hope hand 
27,"Mr Seagrave took his station on the plank, and was left to his own reflections; that they were not of the most pleasant kind may easily be imagined.  He prayed earnestly and fervently that they might be delivered from the danger and sufferings which threatened them, and became calm and tranquil; prepared for the worst, if the worst was to happen, and confidently placing himself and his family under the care of him who orders all as he thinks best.",take station plank leave own reflection pleasant kind imagine pray deliver danger suffering threaten become calm tranquil prepare bad bad happen place family care order think good 
28,"At daylight Ready woke up and relieved Mr Seagrave, who did not return to the house, but lay down on the cocoa-nut boughs, where Ready had been lying by the side of William.  As soon as Ready had got out the spike-nails and hammer, he summoned William to his assistance, and they commenced driving them into the cocoa-nut tree, one looking out in case of the savages approaching, while the other was at work.  In less than an hour they had gained the top of the tree close to the boughs, and had a very commanding view of the bay, as well as inland.  William, who was driving the last dozen spikes, took a survey, and then came down to Ready.",daylight ready wake relieve return house lay cocoa nut bough ready lie side ready get spike nail hammer summon assistance commence drive cocoa nut tree look case savage approach other work less hour gain top tree close bough have commanding view bay inland drive last spike take survey come ready 
29,"""I can see everything, Ready: they have pulled down the old house altogether, and are most of them lying down outside, covered up with their war-cloaks; some women are walking to and fro from the canoes, which are lying on the beach where they first landed.""",see ready pull old house most lie cover war cloak woman walk canoe lie beach land 
30,"""They have pulled down the house to obtain the iron nails, I have no doubt,"" replied Ready.  ""Did you see any of their dead?""",pull house obtain iron nail have doubt reply ready see dead 
31,"""No; I did not look about very much, but I will go up again directly.  I came down because my hands were jarred with hammering, and the hammer was so heavy to carry.  In a minute or two I shall go up light enough. My lips are burning, Ready, and swelled; the skin is peeling off.  I had no idea that want of water would have been so dreadful.  I was in hopes of finding a cocoa-nut or two on the tree, but there was not one.""",look go come hand jarr hammer hammer heavy carry minute go lip burn ready swell skin peel have idea want water dreadful hope find cocoa nut tree be 
32,"""And if you had found one, it would not have had any milk in it at this season of the year.  However, William, if the savages do not go away to-day, something must be done.  I wish now that you would go up again, and see if they are not stirring.""",find have milk season year savage go day do wish go see stir 
33,"William again mounted to the top of the tree, and remained up for some minutes; when he came down, he said, ""They are all up now, and swarming like bees.  I counted 260 of the men in their war-cloaks and feather head-dresses; the women are passing to and fro from the well with water; there is nobody at the canoes except eight or ten women, who are beating their heads, I think, or doing something of the kind.  I could not make it out well, but they seem all doing the same thing.""",mount top tree remain minute come say swarm bee count man war cloak feather head dress woman pass water be canoe woman beat head think do kind make seem do same thing 
34,"""I know what they are about, William: they are cutting themselves with knives or other sharp instruments.  It is the custom of these people. The dead are all put into the canoes, and these women are lamenting over them; perhaps they are going away, since the dead are in the canoes, but there is no saying.""",know cut knife other sharp instrument custom person dead put canoe woman lament go dead canoe be saying
