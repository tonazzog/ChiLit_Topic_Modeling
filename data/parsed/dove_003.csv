1,CHAPTER II. THE EYRIE,
2," CHRISTINA SOREL awoke to a scene most unlike that which had been wont to meet her eyes in her own little wainscoted chamber high in the gabled front of her uncle’s house.  It was a time when the imperial free towns of Germany had advanced nearly as far as those of Italy in civilization, and had reached a point whence they retrograded grievously during the Thirty Years’ War, even to an extent that they have never entirely recovered.  The country immediately around them shared the benefits of their civilization, and the free peasant-proprietors lived in great ease and prosperity, in beautiful and picturesque farmsteads, enjoying a careless abundance, and keeping numerous rural or religious feasts, where old Teutonic mythological observances had received a Christian colouring and adaptation.",awoke scene most wont meet eye own little wainscoted chamber high gabl front uncle house time imperial free town advance civilization reach point retrograde war extent recover country share benefit civilization free peasant proprietor live great ease prosperity beautiful picturesque farmstead enjoy careless abundance keep numerous rural religious feast old teutonic mythological observance receive christian colouring adaptation 
3,"In the mountains, or around the castles, it was usually very different. The elective constitution of the empire, the frequent change of dynasty, the many disputed successions, had combined to render the sovereign authority uncertain and feeble, and it was seldom really felt save in the hereditary dominions of the Kaiser for the time being.  Thus, while the cities advanced in the power of self-government, and the education it conveyed, the nobles, especially those whose abodes were not easily accessible, were often practically under no government at all, and felt themselves accountable to no man.  The old wild freedom of the Suevi, and other Teutonic tribes, still technically, and in many cases practically, existed.  The Heretogen, Heerzogen, or, as we call them, Dukes, had indeed accepted employment from the Kaiser as his generals, and had received rewards from him; the Gerefen, or Graffen, of all kinds were his judges, the titles of both being proofs of their holding commissions from, and being thus dependent on, the court.  But the Freiherren, a word very inadequately represented by our French term of baron, were absolutely free, “never in bondage to any man,” holding their own, and owing no duty, no office; poorer, because unendowed by the royal authority, but holding themselves infinitely higher, than the pensioners of the court.  Left behind, however, by their neighbours, who did their part by society, and advanced with it, the Freiherren had been for the most part obliged to give up their independence and fall into the system, but so far in the rear, that they ranked, like the barons of France and England, as the last order of nobility.",mountain castle different elective constitution empire frequent change dynasty many dispute succession combine render sovereign authority uncertain feeble feel save hereditary dominion time being city advance power self government education convey noble abode accessible government feel accountable man old wild freedom other teutonic tribe many case exist call accept employment general receive reward kind judge title proof hold commission dependent court word represent french term baron free bondage man hold own ow duty office poorer unendowed royal authority hold high pensioner court left neighbour do part society advance most part oblige give independence fall system rear rank baron last order nobility 
4,"Still, however, in the wilder and more mountainous parts of the country, some of the old families of unreduced, truly free Freiherren lingered, their hand against every man, every man’s hand against them, and ever becoming more savage, both positively and still more proportionately, as their isolation and the general progress around them became greater.  The House of Austria, by gradually absorbing hereditary states into its own possessions, was, however, in the fifteenth century, acquiring a preponderance that rendered its possession of the imperial throne almost a matter of inheritance, and moreover rendered the supreme power far more effective than it had ever previously been.  Freidrich III. a man still in full vigour, and with an able and enterprising son already elected to the succession, was making his rule felt, and it was fast becoming apparent that the days of the independent baronies were numbered, and that the only choice that would soon be left them would be between making terms and being forcibly reduced.  Von Adlerstein was one of the oldest of these free families.  If the lords of the Eagle’s Stone had ever followed the great Konrads and Freidrichs of Swabia in their imperial days, their descendants had taken care to forget the weakness, and believed themselves absolutely free from all allegiance.",wild mountainous part country old family unreduced free linger hand man man hand become savage isolation general progress become great absorb hereditary state own possession fifteenth century acquire preponderance render possession imperial throne matter inheritance render supreme power effective man full vigour able enterprising son elect succession make rule feel fast become apparent day independent barony number only choice leave make term reduce old free family lord follow great imperial day descendant take care forget weakness believe free allegiance 
5,"And the wildness of their territory was what might be expected from their hostility to all outward influences.  The hostel, if it deserved the name, was little more than a charcoal-burner’s hut, hidden in the woods at the foot of the mountain, serving as a halting-place for the Freiherren’s retainers ere they attempted the ascent.  The inhabitants were allowed to ply their trade of charring wood in the forest on condition of supplying the castle with charcoal, and of affording a lodging to the followers on occasions like the present.",wildness territory expect hostility outward influence hostel deserve name little more charcoal burner hut hide wood foot mountain serve halting place retainer attempt ascent inhabitant allow ply trade charring wood forest condition supply castle charcoal afford lodging follower occasion present 
6,"Grimy, half-clad, and brawny, with the whites of his eyes gleaming out of his black face, Jobst the Kohler startled Christina terribly when she came into the outer room, and met him returning from his night’s work, with his long stoking-pole in his hand.  Her father shouted with laughter at her alarm.",grimy half clad brawny white eye gleam black face startle come outer room meet return night work long stoking pole hand father shout laughter alarm 
7,"“Thou thinkest thyself in the land of the kobolds and dwarfs, my girl! Never mind, thou wilt see worse than honest Jobst before thou hast done. Now, eat a morsel and be ready—mountain air will make thee hungry ere thou art at the castle.  And, hark thee, Jobst, thou must give stable-room to yon sumpter-mule for the present, and let some of my daughter’s gear lie in the shed.”",thinkest land kobold dwarf girl mind see bad honest do eat morsel ready mountain air make hungry ere thou art castle hark give stable room yon sumpter mule present let daughter gear lie shed

9,"“We’ll bring it up, child, by piecemeal,” he said in a low voice, “as we can; but if such a freight came to the castle at once, my lady would have her claws on it, and little more wouldst thou ever see thereof. Moreover, I shall have enough to do to look after thee up the ascent, without another of these city-bred beasts.”",bring child piecemeal say low voice freight come castle lady have claw little more see have enough do look ascent city breed beast

11,"“Jobst will take care of the beast, as belonging to me.  Woe betide him, if I find it the worse!”—and his added imprecations seemed unnecessary, so earnest were the asseverations of both the man and his wife that the animal should be well cared for.",take care beast belong betide find bad add imprecation seem unnecessary earnest asseveration man wife animal care 
12,"“Look you, Christina,” said Hugh Sorel, as soon as he had placed her on her mule, and led her out of hearing, “if thou hast any gold about thee, let it be the last thing thou ownest to any living creature up there.” Then, as she was about to speak—“Do not even tell me.  I _will_ not know.”  The caution did not add much to Christina’s comfort; but she presently asked, “Where is thy steed, father?”",look say place mule lead hearing hast gold let last thing ownest living creature about speak tell know caution add much comfort ask steed father 
13,"“I sent him up to the castle with the Schneiderlein and Yellow Lorentz,” answered the father.  “I shall have ado enough on foot with thee before we are up the Ladder.”",send castle yellow answer father have foot 
14,"The father and daughter were meantime proceeding along a dark path through oak and birch woods, constantly ascending, until the oak grew stunted and disappeared, and the opening glades showed steep, stony, torrent-furrowed ramparts of hillside above them, looking to Christina’s eyes as if she were set to climb up the cathedral side like a snail or a fly.  She quite gasped for breath at the very sight, and was told in return to wait and see what she would yet say to the Adlerstreppe, or Eagle’s Ladder.  Poor child! she had no raptures for romantic scenery; she knew that jagged peaks made very pretty backgrounds in illuminations, but she had much rather have been in the smooth meadows of the environs of Ulm.  The Danube looked much more agreeable to her, silver-winding between its green banks, than did the same waters leaping down with noisy voices in their stony, worn beds to feed the river that she only knew in his grave breadth and majesty.  Yet, alarmed as she was, there was something in the exhilaration and elasticity of the mountain air that gave her an entirely new sensation of enjoyment and life, and seemed to brace her limbs and spirits for whatever might be before her; and, willing to show herself ready to be gratified, she observed on the freshness and sweetness of the air.",father daughter proceed dark path oak birch wood ascend oak grow stunt disappear open glade show steep stony torrent furrow rampart hillside look eye set climb cathedral side snail fly gasp breath very sight tell return wait see say poor child have rapture romantic scenery know jagged peak make pretty background illumination smooth meadow environ look agreeable silver wind green bank do same water leap noisy voice stony wear bed feed river know grave breadth majesty alarm be exhilaration elasticity mountain air give new sensation enjoyment life seem brace limb spirit willing show ready gratified observe freshness sweetness air 
15,"“Thou find’st it out, child?  Ay, ’tis worth all the feather-beds and pouncet-boxes in Ulm; is it not?  That accursed Italian fever never left me till I came up here.  A man can scarce draw breath in your foggy meadows below there.  Now then, here is the view open.  What think you of the Eagle’s Nest?”",find’st child worth feather bed pouncet box accurse italian fever leave come man draw breath foggy meadow view open think 
16,"For, having passed beyond the region of wood they had come forth upon the mountain-side.  A not immoderately steep slope of boggy, mossy-looking ground covered with bilberries, cranberries, &c. and with bare rocks here and there rising, went away above out of her ken; but the path she was upon turned round the shoulder of the mountain, and to the left, on a ledge of rock cut off apparently on their side by a deep ravine, and with a sheer precipice above and below it, stood a red stone pile, with one turret far above the rest.",pass region wood come mountain side steep slope boggy mossy look ground cover bilberry cranberry &c. bare rock rising go ken path turn shoulder mountain left ledge rock cut side deep ravine sheer precipice stand red stone pile turret rest 
17,“And this is Schloss Adlerstein?” she exclaimed.,exclaim

19,"It was well that Christina had resolution to prevent her making a fool of herself on the spot, for the thought of the pathway turned her so dizzy that she could only shut her eyes, trusting that her father did not see her terror.  Soon the turn round to the side of the mountain was made, and the road became a mere track worn out on the turf on the hillside, with an abyss beneath, close to the edge of which the mule, of course, walked.",have resolution prevent make fool spot thought pathway turn dizzy shut eye trust father see terror turn side mountain make road become mere track wear turf hillside abyss close edge mule course walk 
20,"When she ventured to look again, she perceived that the ravine was like an enormous crack open on the mountain-side, and that the stream that formed the Debateable Ford flowed down the bottom of it.  The ravine itself went probably all the way up the mountain, growing shallower as it ascended higher; but here, where Christina beheld it, it was extremely deep, and savagely desolate and bare.  She now saw that the Eagle’s Ladder was a succession of bare gigantic terraces of rock, of which the opposite side of the ravine was composed, and on one of which stood the castle.  It was no small mystery to her how it had ever been built, or how she was ever to get there.  She saw in the opening of the ravine the green meadows and woods far below; and, when her father pointed out to her the Debateable Ford, apparently much nearer to the castle than they themselves were at present, she asked why they had so far overpassed the castle, and come by this circuitous course.",venture look perceive ravine enormous crack open mountain side stream form flow bottom ravine go way mountain grow shallower ascend high beheld deep desolate bare see succession bare gigantic terrace rock opposite side ravine compose stand castle small mystery build get see opening ravine green meadow wood father point debateable nearer castle present ask overpass castle come circuitous course 
21,"“Because,” said Hugh, “we are not eagles outright.  Seest thou not, just beyond the castle court, this whole crag of ours breaks off short, falls like the town wall straight down into the plain?  Even this cleft that we are crossing by, the only road a horse can pass, breaks off short and sudden too, so that the river is obliged to take leaps which nought else but a chamois could compass.  A footpath there is, and Freiherr Eberhard takes it at all times, being born to it; but even I am too stiff for the like.  Ha! ha!  Thy uncle may talk of the Kaiser and his League, but he would change his note if we had him here.”",say eagle seest castle court whole crag break short fall town wall plain cleft cross only road horse pass break short sudden river oblige take leap nough else chamois compass footpath take time bear stiff like uncle talk change note have 
22,"“Yet castles have been taken by hunger,” said Christina.",castle take hunger say 
23,"“What, knowest thou so much?—True!  But look you,” pointing to a white foamy thread that descended the opposite steeps, “yonder beck dashes through the castle court, and it never dries; and see you the ledge the castle stands on?  It winds on out of your sight, and forms a path which leads to the village of Adlerstein, out on the other slope of the mountains; and ill were it for the serfs if they victualled not the castle well.”",much true look point white foamy thread descend opposite steep yonder beck dash castle court dry see ledge castle stand wind sight form path lead village other slope mountain ill serf victuall castle 
24,"The fearful steepness of the ground absorbed all Christina’s attention. The road, or rather stairs, came down to the stream at the bottom of the fissure, and then went again on the other side up still more tremendous steeps, which Hugh climbed with a staff, sometimes with his hand on the bridle, but more often only keeping a watchful eye on the sure-footed mule, and an arm to steady his daughter in the saddle when she grew absolutely faint with giddiness at the abyss around her.  She was too much in awe of him to utter cry or complaint, and, when he saw her effort to subdue her mortal terror, he was far from unkind, and let her feel his protecting strength.",fearful steepness ground absorb attention road stair come stream bottom fissure go other side tremendous steep climb staff hand bridle keep watchful eye sure foot mule arm steady daughter saddle grow faint giddiness abyss much awe utter cry complaint see effort subdue mortal terror unkind let feel protect strength 
25,"Presently a voice was heard above—“What, Sorel, hast brought her! Trudchen is wearying for her.”",voice hear hast bring weary 
26,"The words were in the most boorish dialect and pronunciation, the stranger to Christina’s ears, because intercourse with foreign merchants, and a growing affectation of Latinism, had much refined the city language to which she was accustomed; and she was surprised to perceive by her father’s gesture and address that the speaker must be one of the lords of the castle.  She looked up, and saw on the pathway above her a tall, large-framed young man, his skin dyed red with sun and wind, in odd contrast with his pale shaggy hair, moustache, and beard, as though the weather had tanned the one and bleached the other.  His dress was a still shabbier buff suit than her father had worn, but with a richly-embroidered belt sustaining a hunting-horn with finely-chased ornaments of tarnished silver, and an eagle’s plume was fastened into his cap with a large gold Italian coin.  He stared hard at the maiden, but vouchsafed her no token of greeting—only distressed her considerably by distracting her father’s attention from her mule by his questions about the journey, all in the same rude, coarse tone and phraseology.  Some amount of illusion was dispelled.  Christina was quite prepared to find the mountain lords dangerous ruffians, but she had expected the graces of courtesy and high birth; but, though there was certainly an air of command and freedom of bearing about the present specimen, his manners and speech were more uncouth than those of any newly-caught apprentice of her uncle, and she could not help thinking that her good aunt Johanna need not have troubled herself about the danger of her taking a liking to any such young Freiherr as she here beheld.",word boorish dialect pronunciation stranger ear intercourse foreign merchant grow affectation refine city language accustom surprise perceive father gesture address speaker lord castle look see pathway tall large frame young man skin dyed red sun wind odd contrast pale shaggy hair moustache beard weather tann one bleach other dress shabbier buff suit father wear embroider belt sustain hunting horn chase ornament tarnish silver eagle plume fasten cap large gold italian coin stare maiden vouchsafe token greeting distress distract father attention mule question journey same rude coarse tone phraseology amount illusion dispell prepare find mountain lord dangerous ruffian expect grace courtesy high birth be air command freedom bear present specimen manners speech uncouth catch apprentice uncle help think good aunt trouble danger take like such young beheld 
27,"By this time a last effort of the mule had climbed to the level of the castle.  As her father had shown her, there was precipice on two sides of the building; on the third, a sheer wall of rock going up to a huge height before it reached another of the Eagle’s Steps; and on the fourth, where the gateway was, the little beck had been made to flow in a deep channel that had been hollowed out to serve as a moat, before it bounded down to swell the larger water-course in the ravine.  A temporary bridge had been laid across; the drawbridge was out of order, and part of Hugh’s business had been to procure materials for mending its apparatus. Christina was told to dismount and cross on foot.  The unrailed board, so close to the abyss, and with the wild water foaming above and below, was dreadful to her; and, though she durst not speak, she hung back with an involuntary shudder, as her father, occupied with the mule, did not think of giving her a hand.  The young baron burst out into an unrestrained laugh—a still greater shock to her feelings; but at the same time he roughly took her hand, and almost dragged her across, saying, “City bred—ho, ho!”  “Thanks, sir,” she strove to say, but she was very near weeping with the terror and strangeness of all around.",time last effort mule climb level castle father show be precipice side building third sheer wall rock go huge height reach fourth gateway little beck make flow deep channel hollow serve moat bound swell large water course ravine temporary bridge lay drawbridge order part business procure material mend apparatus tell dismount cross foot unrailed board close abyss wild water foaming dreadful speak hang involuntary shudder father occupy mule think give hand young baron burst unrestrained laugh great shock feeling same time take hand drag say breed thanks sir strive say weep terror strangeness 
28,"The low-browed gateway, barely high enough to admit a man on horseback, opened before her, almost to her feelings like the gate of the grave, and she could not help crossing herself, with a silent prayer for protection, as she stepped under it, and came into the castle court—not such a court as gave its name to fair courtesy, but, if truth must be told, far more resembling an ill-kept, ill-savoured stable-yard, with the piggeries opening into it.  In unpleasantly close quarters, the Schneiderlein, or little tailor, _i.e._ the biggest and fiercest of all the knappen, was grooming Nibelung; three long-backed, long-legged, frightful swine were grubbing in a heap of refuse; four or five gaunt ferocious-looking dogs came bounding up to greet their comrade Festhold; and a great old long-bearded goat stood on the top of the mixen, looking much disposed to butt at any newcomer.  The Sorel family had brought cleanliness from Flanders, and Hausfrau Johanna was scrupulously dainty in all her appointments.  Christina scarcely knew how she conveyed herself and her blue kirtle across the bemired stones to the next and still darker portal, under which a wide but rough ill-hewn stair ascended.  The stables, in fact, occupied the lower floor of the main building, and not till these stairs had ascended above them did they lead out into the castle hall.  Here were voices—voices rude and harsh, like those Christina had shrunk from in passing drinking booths.  There was a long table, with rough men-at-arms lounging about, and staring rudely at her; and at the upper end, by a great open chimney, sat, half-dozing, an elderly man, more rugged in feature than his son; and yet, when he roused himself and spoke to Hugh, there was a shade more of breeding, and less of clownishness in his voice and deportment, as if he had been less entirely devoid of training.  A tall darkly-robed woman stood beside him—it was her harsh tone of reproof and command that had so startled Christina as she entered—and her huge towering cap made her look gigantic in the dim light of the smoky hall.  Her features had been handsome, but had become hardened into a grim wooden aspect; and with sinking spirits Christina paused at the step of the daïs, and made her reverence, wishing she could sink beneath the stones of the pavement out of sight of these terrible personages.",low browed gateway high admit man horseback open feeling gate grave help cross silent prayer protection step come castle court court give name fair courtesy truth tell resemble ill keep ill savoure stable yard piggery open close quarter little tailor big fiercest knappen groom long back long legged frightful swine grubb heap refuse gaunt ferocious look dog come bound greet comrade great old long bearded goat stand top mixen look dispose butt newcomer family bring cleanliness dainty appointment know convey blue kirtle bemire stone next dark portal wide rough ill hewn stair ascend stable fact occupy low floor main building stair ascend lead castle hall voice voice rude harsh shrink passing drinking booth be long table rough man arm loung stare upper end great open chimney sit half dozing elderly man rugged feature son rouse speak be shade more breeding less clownishness voice deportment devoid training tall robed woman stand harsh tone reproof command startle enter huge tower cap make look gigantic dim light smoky hall feature handsome become harden grim wooden aspect sink spirit pause step daï make reverence wish sink stone pavement sight terrible personage 
29,"“So that’s the wench you have taken all this trouble for,” was Freiherrinn Kunigunde’s greeting.  “She looks like another sick baby to nurse; but I’ll have no trouble about her;—that is all.  Take her up to Ermentrude; and thou, girl, have a care thou dost her will, and puttest none of thy city fancies into her head.”",wench take trouble greeting look sick baby nurse have trouble take girl have care will puttest city fancy head

31,"“That way,” pointed the lady towards one of the four corner towers; and Christina moved doubtfully towards it, reluctant to quit her father, her only protector, and afraid to introduce herself.  The younger Freiherr, however, stepped before her, went striding two or three steps at a time up the turret stair, and, before Christina had wound her way up, she heard a thin, impatient voice say, “Thou saidst she was come, Ebbo.”",way point lady corner tower move reluctant quit father only protector afraid introduce young step go strid step time turret stair wind way hear thin impatient voice say saidst come 
32,"“Yes, even so,” she heard Freiherr Eberhard return; “but she is slow and town-bred.  She was afraid of crossing the moat.”  And then both laughed, so that Christina’s cheeks tingled as she emerged from the turret into another vaulted room.  “Here she is,” quoth the brother; “now will she make thee quite well.”",hear return slow town breed afraid cross moat laugh cheek tingle emerge turret vault room brother make 
33,"It was a very bare and desolate room, with no hangings to the rough stone walls, and scarcely any furniture, except a great carved bedstead, one wooden chair, a table, and some stools.  On the bare floor, in front of the fire, her arm under her head, and a profusion of long hair falling round her like flax from a distaff, lay wearily a little figure, beside whom Sir Eberhard was kneeling on one knee.",bare desolate room hanging rough stone wall furniture great carve bedstead wooden chair table stool bare floor front fire arm head profusion long hair fall flax distaff lay little figure kneel knee

35,"In an excess of dumb shyness Ermentrude half rose, and effectually hindered any observations on her looks by hiding her face away upon her brother’s knee.  It was the gesture of a child of five years old, but Ermentrude’s length of limb forbade Christina to suppose her less than fourteen or fifteen.  “What, wilt not look at her?” he said, trying to raise her head; and then, holding out one of her wasted, feverish hands to Christina, he again asked, with a wistfulness that had a strange effect from the large, tall man, almost ten years her elder, “Canst thou cure her, maiden?”",excess dumb shyness half rise hinder observation look hide face brother knee gesture child year old length limb forbid suppose less look say try raise head hold waste feverish hand ask wistfulness have strange effect large tall man year elder cure maiden

37,"“I will not go away; I want the fire,” murmured the sick girl, holding out her hands towards it, and shivering.",go want fire murmure sick girl hold hand shiver 
38,"Christina quickly took off her own thick cloth mantle, well lined with dressed lambskins, laid it on the floor, rolled the collar of it over a small log of wood—the only substitute she could see for a pillow—and showed an inviting couch in an instant.  Ermentrude let her brother lay her down, and then was covered with the ample fold.  She smiled as she turned up her thin, wasted face, faded into the same whitey-brown tint as her hair.  “That is good,” she said, but without thanks; and, feeling the soft lambswool: “Is that what you burgher-women wear?  Father is to give me a furred mantle, if only some court dame would pass the Debateable Ford.  But the Schlangenwaldern got the last before ever we could get down.  Jobst was so stupid.  He did not give us warning in time; but he is to be hanged next time if he does not.”",take own thick cloth mantle line dress lambskin lay floor roll collar small log wood only substitute see pillow show invite couch instant let brother lay cover ample fold smile turn thin waste face fade same whitey brown tint hair good say thanks feel soft lambswool burgher woman wear father give furred mantle court dame pass debateable get last get stupid give warning time hang next time 
39,"Christina’s blood curdled as she heard this speech in a weak little complaining tone, that otherwise put her sadly in mind of Barbara Schmidt’s little sister, who had pined and wasted to death.  “Never mind, Trudchen,” answered the brother kindly; “meantime I have kept all the wild catskins for thee, and may be this—this—_she_ could sew them up into a mantle for thee.”",blood curdle hear speech weak little complain tone put mind little sister pine waste death mind answer brother keep wild catskin sew mantle 
40,"“O let me see,” cried the young lady eagerly; and Sir Eberhard, walking off, presently returned with an armful of the beautiful brindled furs of the mountain cat, reminding Christina of her aunt’s gentle domestic favourite.  Ermentrude sat up, and regarded the placing out of them with great interest; and thus her brother left her employed, and so much delighted that she had not flagged, when a great bell proclaimed that it was the time for the noontide meal, for which Christina, in spite of all her fears of the company below stairs, had been constrained by mountain air to look forward with satisfaction.",let see cry young lady walk return armful beautiful brindle fur mountain cat remind aunt gentle domestic favourite sit regard place great interest brother leave employ delighted flagge great bell proclaim time noontide meal spite fear company stair constrain mountain air look satisfaction 
41,"Ermentrude, she found, meant to go down, but with no notion of the personal arrangements that Christina had been wont to think a needful preliminary.  With all her hair streaming, down she went, and was so gladly welcomed by her father that it was plain that her presence was regarded as an unusual advance towards recovery, and Christina feared lest he might already be looking out for the stout husband.  She had much to tell him about the catskin cloak, and then she was seized with eager curiosity at the sight of Christina’s bundles, and especially at her lute, which she must hear at once.",find mean go notion personal arrangement wont think needful preliminary hair stream go welcome father plain presence regard unusual advance recovery fear look stout husband have much tell catskin cloak seize eager curiosity sight bundle lute hear

43,"The whole establishment were taking their places—or rather tumbling into them.  A battered, shapeless metal vessel seemed to represent the salt-cellar, and next to it Hugh Sorel seated himself, and kept a place for her beside him.  Otherwise she would hardly have had seat or food.’ She was now able to survey the inmates of the castle.  Besides the family themselves, there were about a dozen men, all ruffianly-looking, and of much lower grade than her father, and three women.  One, old Ursel, the wife of Hatto the forester, was a bent, worn, but not ill-looking woman, with a motherly face; the younger ones were hard, bold creatures, from whom Christina felt a shrinking recoil.  The meal was dressed by Ursel and her kitchen boy.  From a great cauldron, goat’s flesh and broth together were ladled out into wooden bowls.  That every one provided their own spoon and knife—no fork—was only what Christina was used to in the most refined society, and she had the implements in a pouch hanging to her girdle; but she was not prepared for the unwashed condition of the bowls, nor for being obliged to share that of her father—far less for the absence of all blessing on the meal, and the coarse boisterousness of manners prevailing thereat.  Hungry as she was, she did not find it easy to take food under these circumstances, and she was relieved when Ermentrude, overcome by the turmoil, grew giddy, and was carried upstairs by her father, who laid her down upon her great bed, and left her to the attendance of Christina.  Ursel had followed, but was petulantly repulsed by her young lady in favour of the newcomer, and went away grumbling.",whole establishment take place tumble batter shapeless metal vessel seem represent salt cellar seat keep place have seat food able survey inmate castle family be man look low grade father woman old wife forester bend wear ill look woman motherly face young one hard bold creature feel shrink recoil meal dress kitchen boy great cauldron goat flesh broth ladl wooden bowl one provide own spoon knife fork use refine society have implement pouch hang girdle prepare unwashed condition bowl oblige share father less absence blessing meal coarse boisterousness manners prevail hungry find easy take food circumstance relieve overcome turmoil grow giddy carry father lay great bed leave attendance follow repulse young lady favour newcomer go grumble 
44,"Nestled on her bed, Ermentrude insisted on hearing the lute, and Christina had to creep down to fetch it, with some other of her goods, in trembling haste, and redoubled disgust at the aspect of the meal, which looked even more repulsive in this later stage, and to one who was no longer partaking of it.",nestle bed insist hear lute have creep fetch other goods tremble haste redoubl disgust aspect meal look repulsive late stage partake 
45,"Low and softly, with a voice whence she could scarcely banish tears, and in dread of attracting attention, Christina sung to the sick girl, who listened with a sort of rude wonder, and finally was lulled to sleep. Christina ventured to lay down her instrument and move towards the window, heavily mullioned with stone, barred with iron, and glazed with thick glass; being in fact the only glazed window in the castle.  To her great satisfaction it did not look out over the loathsome court, but over the opening of the ravine.  The apartment occupied the whole floor of the keep; it was stone-paved, but the roof was boarded, and there was a round turret at each angle.  One contained the staircase, and was that which ran up above the keep, served as a watch-tower, and supported the Eagle banner.  The other three were empty, and one of these, which had a strong door, and a long loophole window looking out over the open country, Christina hoped that she might appropriate.  The turret was immediately over the perpendicular cliff that descended into the plain.  A stone thrown from the window would have gone straight down, she knew not where. Close to her ears rushed the descending waterfall in its leap over the rock side, and her eyes could rest themselves on the green meadow land below, and the smooth water of the Debateable Ford; nay—far, far away beyond retreating ridges of wood and field—she thought she could track a silver line and, guided by it, a something that might be a city.

54,"Such an entire blank as the poor child’s mind seemed to be was inconceivable to the maiden, who had been bred up in the busy hum of men, where the constant resort of strange merchants, the daily interests of a self-governing municipality, and the numerous festivals, both secular and religious, were an unconscious education, even without that which had been bestowed upon her by teachers, as well as by her companionship with her uncle, and participation in his studies, taste and arts.",entire blank poor child mind seem inconceivable maiden breed busy hum man constant resort strange merchant daily interest self govern municipality numerous festival secular religious unconscious education bestow teacher companionship uncle participation study taste art 
55,"Ermentrude von Adlerstein had, on the contrary, not only never gone beyond the Kohler’s hut on the one side, and the mountain village on the other, but she never seen more of life than the festival at the wake the hermitage chapel there on Midsummer-day.  The only strangers who ever came to the castle were disbanded lanzknechts who took service with her father, or now and then a captive whom he put to ransom.  She knew absolutely nothing of the world, except for a general belief that Freiherren lived there to do what they chose with other people, and that the House of Adlerstein was the freest and noblest in existence.  Also there was a very positive hatred to the house of Schlangenwald, and no less to that of Adlerstein Wildschloss, for no reason that Christina could discover save that, being a younger branch of the family, they had submitted to the Emperor.  To destroy either the Graf von Schlangenwald, or her Wildschloss cousin, was evidently the highest gratification Ermentrude could conceive; and, for the rest, that her father and brother should make successful captures at the Debateable Ford was the more abiding, because more practicable hope.  She had no further ideas, except perhaps to elude her mother’s severity, and to desire her brother’s success in chamois-hunting.  The only mental culture she had ever received was that old Ursel had taught her the Credo, Pater Noster, and Ave, as correctly as might be expected from a long course of traditionary repetitions of an incomprehensible language.  And she knew besides a few German rhymes and jingles, half Christian, half heathen, with a legend or two which, if the names were Christian, ran grossly wild from all Christian meaning or morality.  As to the amenities, nay, almost the proprieties, of life, they were less known in that baronial castle than in any artisan’s house at Ulm.  So little had the sick girl figured them to herself, that she did not even desire any greater means of ease than she possessed.  She moaned and fretted indeed, with aching limbs and blank weariness, but without the slightest formed desire for anything to remove her discomfort, except the few ameliorations she knew, such as sitting on her brother’s knee, with her head on his shoulder, or tasting the mountain berries that he gathered for her.  Any other desire she exerted herself to frame was for finery to be gained from the spoils of travellers.",contrary go hut side mountain village other see more life festival wake hermitage chapel day only stranger come castle disband lanzknecht take service father captive put ransom know world general belief live do choose other person freest noblest existence be positive hatred house less reason discover young branch family submit emperor destroy cousin high gratification conceive rest father brother make successful capture debateable abide practicable hope have further idea elude mother severity desire brother success chamois hunting only mental culture receive old teach expect long course traditionary repetition incomprehensible language know few german rhyme jingle half half heathen legend name run wild christian meaning morality amenity propriety life know baronial castle artisan house sick girl figure desire great means ease possess moan fret ach limb blank weariness slight form desire remove discomfort few amelioration know such sit brother knee head shoulder taste mountain berries gather other desire exert frame finery gain spoil traveller 
56,"And this was Christina’s charge, whom she must look upon as the least alien spirit in this dreadful castle of banishment!  The young and old lords seemed to her savage bandits, who frightened her only less than did the proud sinister expression of the old lady, for she had not even the merit of showing any tenderness towards the sickly girl, of whom she was ashamed, and evidently regarded the town-bred attendant as a contemptible interloper.",charge look least alien spirit dreadful castle banishment young old lord seem savage bandit frighten less do proud sinister expression old lady merit show tenderness sickly girl ashamed regard town breed attendant contemptible interloper 
57,"Long, long did the maiden weep and pray that night after Ermentrude had sunk to sleep.  She strained her eyes with home-sick longings to detect lights where she thought Ulm might be; and, as she thought of her uncle and aunt, the poodle and the cat round the stove, the maids spinning and the prentices knitting as her uncle read aloud some grave good book, most probably the legend of the saint of the day, and contrasted it with the rude gruff sounds of revelry that found their way up the turret stairs, she could hardly restrain her sobs from awakening the young lady whose bed she was to share.  She thought almost with envy of her own patroness, who was cast into the lake of Bolsena with a millstone about her neck—a better fate, thought she, than to live on in such an abode of loathsomeness and peril.",long maiden weep pray night sink sleep strain eye home sick longing detect light think think uncle aunt poodle cat stove maid spinn prentice knitting uncle read grave good book legend saint day contrast rude gruff sound revelry find way turret stair restrain sob awaken young lady bed share think envy own patroness cast lake millstone neck good fate think live abode loathsomeness peril 
58,"But then had not St. Christina floated up alive, bearing up her millstone with her?  And had not she been put into a dungeon full of venomous reptiles who, when they approached her, had all been changed to harmless doves?  Christina had once asked Father Balthazar how this could be; and had he not replied that the Church did not teach these miracles as matters of faith, but that she might there discern in figure how meek Christian holiness rose above all crushing burthens, and transformed the rudest natures.  This poor maiden-dying, perhaps; and oh! how unfit to live or die!—might it be her part to do some good work by her, and infuse some Christian hope, some godly fear?  Could it be for this that the saints had led her hither?",float alive bear millstone put dungeon full venomous reptile approach change harmless dove ask reply teach miracle matter faith discern figure christian holiness rise crush burthen transform rude nature poor maiden die unfit live die part do good work infuse christian hope godly fear saint lead
