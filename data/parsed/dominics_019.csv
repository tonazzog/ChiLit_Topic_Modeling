1,CHAPTER 18. A HOLIDAY ADVENTURE.,holiday adventure 
2,"When a big school like Saint Dominic's is gathered together within the comparatively narrow compass of four walls, there _is_ some possibility of ascertaining how it prospers, and what events are interesting it. But when the same school is scattered to the four winds of heaven during the holidays, it would require a hundred eyes and more to follow its movements.",big school gather narrow compass wall possibility ascertain prosper event interesting same school scatter wind heaven holiday require eye more follow movement 
3,"It would be impossible, for instance, at one and the same time to accompany Raleigh and his sisters up Snowdon, and look on at Bramble catching crabs on the rocks at Broadstairs; nor, while we follow Dr Senior among the peaks and passes of Switzerland (and remark, by the way, what a nice quiet boy Tom Senior is, when he has only his father and his mother to tempt him into mischief) can we possibly expect to regard very attentively the doings of Simon, as he gapes about before the London shop-windows, and jerks off a score or more stanzas of his ""Hart's Earnings,"" which is now about a quarter done.",impossible instance same time accompany sister look catching crab rock follow peak pass remark way nice quiet boy have father mother temp mischief expect regard doing gape shop window jerk score more stanza earning quarter do 
4,"So the reader must imagine how most of the boys spent their holidays, how they enjoyed them, and how they behaved themselves during the period, and be content to be told only about two groups of holiday-makers, about whom, as they are destined to figure pretty conspicuously in next term's doings at Saint Dominic's, it will be interesting to hear rather more particularly now.",reader imagine most boy spend holiday enjoy behave period content tell group holiday maker destine figure next term doing interesting hear 
5,"And the first group--if we can call a single person a ""group""--is Loman.",first group call single person group 
6,"Loman began his holidays in anything but cheerful spirits.  No one had seemed particularly sorry to say good-bye to him at Saint Dominic's, and a good many had been unmistakably glad.  And he had quite enough on his mind, apart from this, to make his home-coming far less joyous than it might have been.  It ought to have been the happiest event possible, for he was coming home to parents who loved him, friends who were glad to see him, and a home where every comfort and pleasure was within his reach.  Few boys, indeed, were more blessed than Loman with all the advantages of a Christian and happy home; and few boys could have failed to return to such a home after a long absence without delight.  But to Loman, these holidays, the surroundings of home afforded very little pleasure.  His mind was ill at ease.  The burden of debt was upon him, and the burden of suspense.  He had tried hard to assure himself that all would come right--that he would certainly win the scholarship, and so wipe off the debt; but his confidence became less and less comfortable as time went on.",begin holiday cheerful spirit seem sorry say good bye good many glad have enough mind make home come joyous happy event possible come parent love friend glad see home comfort pleasure reach few boy bless advantage christian happy home few boy fail return home long absence delight holiday surroundings home afford little pleasure mind ill ease burden debt burden suspense try assure come win scholarship wipe debt confidence become less comfortable time go 
7,"He dared not tell his troubles to his father, for he feared his upbraiding; and he would not confess them to his mother, for she, he knew, would tell all to his father.  He still clung to the hope that all would come right in the end; and then what would have been gained by telling his parents all about it?",tell trouble father fear upbraiding confess mother know tell father cling hope come end gain tell parent 
8,"The one thing was hard work--and Loman came home determined to work. His parents saw him out of spirits, and were concerned.  They did what they could to cheer him, but without much success.",thing hard work come determined work parent see spirit concerned do cheer much success 
9,"""Come, Edward, put away your books to-day,"" his mother would say; ""I want you to drive me over to Falkham in the pony-chaise.""",come put book day mother say want drive pony chaise 
10,"""I really can't, mother; I must work for the scholarship.""",mother work scholarship 
11,"""Nonsense, boy; what is a scholarship compared with your health? Besides, you'll work all the better if you take some exercise.""",nonsense boy scholarship compare health work good take exercise 
12,"But for a week nothing could tempt him out.  Then, instead of accompanying his father or mother, he would take long solitary rides on his own pony, brooding all the while over his troubles.",week temp accompany father mother take long solitary ride own pony brood while trouble 
13,"One day, when in the course of one of these expeditions he had taken the direction of Maltby--which was only fifteen miles distant from his home--he became suddenly aware of an approaching dog-cart in the road before him, and a familiar voice crying, ""Why, if it ain't young Squire Loman, riding a bit of very tidy horseflesh too, as I'm a Dutchman!""",day course expedition take direction mile distant home become aware approach dog cart road familiar voice cry young ride bit tidy horseflesh 
14,It was Cripps.  What evil spirit could have brought him on the scene now?,evil spirit bring scene 
15,"""Well, I never reckoned to see you now,"" said he, in his usual jaunty manner.  ""Fact is, I was just trotting over to see _you_.  I wanted to try what this here cob was made of, and, thinks I, I may as well kill two birds with one stone, and look up my young squire while I'm about it.""",reckon see say usual jaunty manner fact trot see want try cob make think kill bird stone look young squire 
16,"""Coming to see me!"" exclaimed Loman, horrified.  ""I say, Cripps, you mustn't do that.  My father would be very angry, you know.""",come see exclaim horrify say do father angry know 
17,"""Nice, that is!  As if I wasn't as good company as any one else!""",nice good company one else 
18,"""Oh! it's not that,"" said Loman, fearing he had given offence.  ""What I mean is--""",say fear give offence mean 
19,"""Oh, I know--about that there rod.  Bless me!  I won't let out on you, my beauty--leastways, if you come up to scratch.  He'd like to hear the story, though, the old gentleman, I fancy.  Wouldn't he now?""",know rod bless let beauty leastway come scratch like hear story old gentleman fancy 
20,"""I wouldn't have him know it for worlds.  It'll be all right, Cripps, indeed it will about the money.""",have know world right money 
21,Mr Cripps looked very benignant.,look benignant 
22,"""All right, young swell, I hope it will.  Funny I feel such an interest in you, 'specially since that young greeny friend of yours put in a word for you.  He's a real nice sort, he is--he owes you one, and no mistake.""",right young swell hope funny feel interest young greeny friend put word real nice sort owe mistake 
23,"""What!"" said Loman, in surprise; ""who do you mean?  Young Greenfield?""",say surprise mean young

26,"""Eh!--what ain't he been saying!  In course you didn't half murder him, eh?  In course you ain't a good hand at cheatin' all round up at the school!  What?  In course you ain't saying nice things agin me all over the place--and in course some of us wouldn't like to see you get a reg'lar good hiding, wouldn't we?

Loman was furious.",say course half murder course good hand cheatin school course say nice thing agin place course like see get reg'lar good hiding bless know mum fear furious 
27,"""The young liar!"" he exclaimed.  ""I did owe him one; I'll pay him when we get back!""",young liar exclaim owe pay get 
28,"""Hold hard, young gentleman,"" said Cripps, coolly.  ""To be sure, he ain't downright sweet on you; but I ain't a-going to have him smashed, mind, all to bits.  Well, never mind that.  I'll turn back with you, young gentleman, if I may.  We're only three miles from Maltby, and maybe you'll honour a poor chap like me by having a look in at the Cockchafer.""",hold hard young gentleman say sure sweet go have smash mind bit mind turn young gentleman mile honour poor chap have look 
29,"Loman did not know how to say ""No,"" much as he disliked and feared his host.  He returned with him to Maltby, and there spent an hour in the Cockchafer.  He was introduced to several of Mr Cripps's low friends, in whose society he found it easy enough to become low himself.  Cripps, by a judicious mixture of flattery and sly threats, managed to keep the boy well in hand, and when at last he rose to go it was with a promise to return again before the holidays were over--""to prevent Cripps having the trouble of calling on him,"" as that virtuous gentleman significantly put it.",know say much dislike fear host return spend hour introduce several low friend society find easy become low judicious mixture flattery sly threat manage keep boy hand last rise go promise return holiday prevent have trouble call virtuous gentleman put 
30,"Loman kept his promise, and visited Maltby once or twice, becoming each time more familiar with Cripps and his low friends, who made a great deal of him, and flattered him on all possible occasions, so that the boy presently found himself, as he imagined, quite a young hero at the Cockchafer.",keep promise visit become time familiar low friend make great deal flatter possible occasion boy find imagine young hero 
31,"Meanwhile, naturally, his reading fell behindhand.  His parents, only too glad to see their boy taking more regular exercise, never suspected or inquired as to the direction of his frequent solitary rides.  To them he seemed the same quiet, clever boy they fondly believed him.  Little guessed they of the troubles that filled his breast or the toils that were daily enwrapping him!",reading fall parent glad see boy take more regular exercise suspect inquire direction frequent solitary ride seem same quiet clever boy believe little guess trouble fill breast toil daily enwrapp 
32,"Thus Loman's holidays came to an end.  The farewell was once more said, parents and son parted, and on the first day of an eventful term the boy found himself once more within the walls of Saint Dominic's.",holiday come end farewell say parent son part first day eventful term boy find wall 
33,"Oliver and Stephen, meanwhile, had been spending a very different sort of holiday at home.  There was high feast and revelry when the two boys returned once more to the maternal roof.  Stephen for once in a way had the satisfaction of finding himself a most unmistakable hero.  He never tired telling of his adventures and discoursing on the whole manner of his life since the day he left home for Saint Dominic's.  To his sister he recounted in all the slang phraseology he had at his command, the famous cricket matches in which he had borne a part; and she, though it was exactly like Greek to her, drank in every word with interest.  And to his mother he narrated his various fights with Bramble, and the terrific adventures through which he had passed, till the good lady's hair nearly stood on end, and she began to think a public school was a terrible place to send a small boy to.",spend different sort holiday home be high feast revelry boy return more maternal roof way have satisfaction find unmistakable hero tired tell adventure discours whole manner life day leave home sister recount slang phraseology have command famous cricket match borne part drink word interest mother narrate various fight terrific adventure pass good lady hair stand end begin think public school terrible place send small boy 
34,"Oliver, of course, had his stories to tell too, only in a more sober manner.",course have story tell sober manner 
35,"There was a great scene when, on the first day of the holidays, the elder brother produced his books and announced that he must study at least two hours a day in prospect of the Nightingale Scholarship examination.  But every one knew how much depended on his winning that scholarship, and in a few years being able to go to the university, so that the family gave in in the end, and Oliver was allowed his two hours' study, but not a second more, every day.  Stephen, meanwhile, taught his sister round-arm bowling, and devoted himself mind and body to the bicycle.",be great scene first day holiday elder brother produce book announce study least hour day prospect examination one know much depend win scholarship few year able go university family give end allow hour study second more day teach sister arm bowling devote mind body bicycle 
36,"The two brothers, during these holidays, became very great cronies.  At school Oliver had seen comparatively little of his young brother, but now they were daily and hourly thrown together, the brotherly instincts in each blossomed wonderfully, and a mutual attachment sprang up which had hardly been there before.",brother holiday become great crony school see little young brother daily throw brotherly instinct blossom mutual attachment spring 
37,"It had been arranged, before breaking-up, that Oliver and Wraysford should spend the last week of the holiday together in rowing down the Thames from Oxford to London.",arrange break spend last week holiday row 
38,"Great was Stephen's joy and pride when one morning, near the appointed time, Oliver said to him, ""Look here, Stee.  How would you like to come with Wray and me next week?""",great joy pride morning appoint time say look like come next week 
39,"""Like! wouldn't I rather!"" shouted the small boy in ecstasy.  ""Thanks, Noll, old man!  I say, it will be a spree.""  And the youngster became so riotous over the prospect that his elder brother had to threaten not to take him at all, and give him a thrashing into the bargain, before he could be reduced to order.",shout small boy ecstasy thanks old man say spree youngster become riotous prospect elder brother have threaten take give thrashing bargain reduce order 
40,"They were to take a tent with them, and cooking utensils, so as to be quite independent of inns, and each voyager was to contribute his share of provender.  Quite a Robinson Crusoe business, even down to the desert island, for on desert islands the boys had declared they intended every night to take up their quarters, and, come hail, snow, or lightning, there to sleep under their waterproof tent.",take tent cooking utensil independent inn voyager contribute share provender business desert island desert island boy declare intend night take quarter come hail snow lightning sleep waterproof tent 
41,"Mrs Greenfield didn't half like the idea, and became very pathetic on the subject of ague and rheumatic fever.  But the boys carried the day by promising faithfully that they would catch neither malady.  The looked-for day came at last, and to Oxford they went, where the familiar sight of Wraysford, in boating costume, at the railway station still further elated their high spirits.  The boat was ready.  The tent, the provender, the blankets, were snugly stowed away on board.  The weather was fine, the river was charming, everything promised well; and punctually that Monday afternoon the three adventurers loosed from their moorings and turned the nose of their boat towards London.",idea become pathetic subject ague rheumatic fever boy carry day promise catch malady look day come last go familiar sight boating costume railway station elate high spirit boat ready tent provender blanket stow board weather fine river charming promise afternoon adventurer loose mooring turn nose boat 
42,"I wish I could tell the reader all the events of that wonderful voyage: how they paddled down merrily with the stream; how they found their desert island covered with nettles, which they had to mow down with their oars; how the soup-kettle wouldn't act, and the stew-pan leaked; how grand the potted lobster tasted; how Stephen offered to make tea with muddy water, and how the paraffin oil of their lanterns leaked all over their plum-cake and sandwiches; how Stephen was sent up inland to forage, and came back with wonderful purchases of eggs and milk; how they started off one day leaving their tent behind them, and had to row back in a panic to recover it; how it rained one night, and a puddle formed on the roof of the tent, which presently grew so big that it overflowed and gave Wraysford a shower-bath; how each morning they all took headers into the stream, much to the alarm of the sleepy ducks; how they now and then ran foul of a boat, and now and then were turned off their camping ground by an indignant keeper!  It was glorious fun.  But it would take a volume to recount all that happened to them.",wish tell reader event wonderful voyage paddle stream find desert island cover nettle have mow oar soup kettle act stew pan leak grand potted lobster taste offer make tea muddy water paraffin oil lantern leak plum cake sandwich send forage come wonderful purchase egg milk start day leave tent have row panic recover rain night puddle form roof tent grow big overflow give shower bath morning take header stream much alarm sleepy duck run foul boat turn camping ground indignant keeper glorious fun take volume recount happen 
43,"They were coming near the end of their cruise.  They had paddled down past the magnificent woods of Cliveden, and under the pretty bridge of Maidenhead; they had watched the boys bathing at ""Athens,"" and they had rowed through the gloomy shadow of Windsor Castle and on past Eton.",come end cruise paddle magnificent wood pretty bridge watch boy bathing row gloomy shadow 
44,"Here the river is broken by a string of islands, which in many parts make the stream narrow; and the river being full of boats and barges, our three adventurers found themselves called upon to exercise more than ordinary precautions in keeping their course.  This responsibility became at last so irksome that Oliver said, ""I say, can't we get out of this rabble anyhow?  Why shouldn't we take the other side of the islands?""",river break string island many part make stream narrow river full boat barge adventurer find call exercise more ordinary precaution keep course responsibility become last irksome say say get rabble take other side island

47,"Stephen did as he was bid.  The stream was pretty strong just there, and the two rowers had to pull pretty hard to get round without drifting on to the island.",bid stream strong rower have pull hard get drift island 
48,"Once out of the main stream, they were delighted to find the course clear.  Indeed, they had the channel all to themselves.",main stream delighted find course clear have channel

60,"No one said a word.  Stephen, with pale face, pulled his rudder string; and Wraysford, with his one oar, tried desperately to arrest the headlong progress of the boat.",say word pale face pull rudder string oar try arrest headlong progress boat 
61,"There was a shout from the bank, and a nearer and louder one from the lock.  They became conscious of a great half-open gate on their right, and a rush of footsteps beside them.  Then, in far shorter time than it takes to write it, the boat, side on to the weir, lurched and dashed for a moment in the troubled water, and the next instant turned over, and the three boys were struggling in the water.",be shout bank nearer louder one lock become conscious great half open gate right rush footstep short time take write boat side weir lurch dash moment troubled water next instant turn boy struggle water 
62,"In an ordinary current such an adventure would have been of little moment, for the boys could swim.  But in a torrent like this it was an awful peril.  The swift flood sweeps on and sucks under its prey with fearful force.  To resist it is impossible--to escape being dashed against its stony bottom is almost as impossible.",ordinary current adventure little moment boy swim torrent awful peril swift flood sweep suck prey fearful force resist impossible escape dash stony bottom impossible 
63,"Mercifully for Oliver, he did escape this latter peril, and, being cool always in the presence of danger, he offered no resistance to the stream, but struck out hard under the water for as long as his breath would permit.",escape latter peril cool presence danger offer resistance stream strike water breath permit 
64,"When at last, exhausted and unable to swim farther, he rose to the surface, he was in calm deep water many yards below the weir.  Help was at hand, or he could never have reached the bank.  As it was, when at last friendly arms did drag him ashore, he was too exhausted even to utter his brother's name.",last exhausted unable swim rise surface calm deep water many yard weir help hand reach bank last friendly arm drag exhausted utter brother name 
65,Where was Stephen? and where was Wraysford?,
66,"Wraysford had been more fortunate even than Oliver in his first capsize. He was swept over the weir, indeed, but into a side eddy which brought him up violently against a projecting branch, to which he clung wildly. Here he would have been safe, and even able to help himself to shore. But at the moment when he began to draw himself up from the water on to the branch, there was something--an arm cast wildly up--in the water beside him.  In an instant Wraysford quitted his hold and plunged once more into the rapid.  How, he knew not, but he just reached the hapless boy.  It was too late to recover the friendly branch.  All he could do was to cling to Stephen and trust to reaching calm water safely.  Many a bruise the two received in that terrible passage, but the elder boy never once quitted his hold of the younger.",fortunate first capsize sweep weir side eddy bring project branch cling safe able help shore moment begin draw water branch be arm cast water instant quit hold plunge rapid know reach hapless boy late recover friendly branch do cling trust reach calm water many bruise receive terrible passage elder boy quit hold young

68,"Thus ended this famous holiday cruise.  The three boys kept their own secret, and talked little about the adventure, even to one another.",end famous holiday cruise boy keep own secret talk little adventure 
69,"In due time the holidays ended, and the Dominicans reassembled once more in their venerable Alma Mater.
