1,CHAPTER 11. MORE HARDSHIP.,more hardship 
2,"This morning was unlike the mornings which Oliver had watched since the flood came.  There was no glowing sky towards the east; and he saw that there would be no broad train of light over the waters, which should so dazzle his eyes as almost to prevent his seeing anything else.  It was now a stormy-looking sunrise.  Huge piles of clouds lay on the eastern horizon, through which it seemed impossible that the rays of the sun should pierce.  The distant church-spire looked black amidst the grey flood: and the houses and chapel at Sandtoft, which now stood high out of the water, had a dark and dismal air.  Oliver would have been rather glad to believe that there would be no sunshine this day, if he had not feared there would be storm.  He had so learned, in these few days, to associate reeking fogs and putrid smells with hot sunshine, that a shady day would have been a relief: but it there should come a tempest, what could be done with the sick members of the party?  It was dangerous to stand under the trees in a thunderstorm; and the poor tent would be soaked through with a quarter of an hour's rain.  He thought it would be best to take down the tent, and wrap up Mildred and Roger in the cloth; and to pile the mattresses, one upon another, at the foot of the thickest tree they could find; so that there might be a chance of one bed being left dry for poor Mildred.",morning morning watch flood come be glow sky east see be broad train light water dazzle eye prevent see else stormy look sunrise huge pile cloud lay eastern horizon seem impossible ray sun pierce distant church spire look black grey flood house chapel stand water have dark dismal air glad believe be sunshine day fear be storm learn few day associate reek fog putrid smell hot sunshine shady day relief come tempest do sick member party dangerous stand tree thunderstorm poor tent soak quarter hour rain think good take tent wrap cloth pile mattress foot thickest tree find be chance bed leave dry poor 
3,"While arranging this in his mind, Oliver had been anxiously looking abroad for any moving speck on the grey waters.  Seeing none, but perceiving that the clouds were slowly mounting the sky, and moving onwards, he felt that he ought to be going to the hill, to make such preparations as were possible before the first raindrops should fall. Slowly and sadly he turned away to do so, when, casting one more glance eastwards, he perceived something moving--a dark speck, leaving the ruined roof of a dwelling which stood about half-way between himself and the hamlet.",arrange mind look moving speck grey water see perceive cloud mount sky move feel go hill make such preparation possible first raindrop fall turn do cast more glance perceive move dark speck leave ruin roof dwelling stand half way hamlet 
4,"There could be no doubt that this speck was a boat; and as it came nearer, Oliver saw that it was--a large boat, but quite full.  He could distinguish no figures in it, so heavy seemed the mass of people, or of goods, with which it was crowded.  It came on and on, however; and Oliver's heart beat faster as it came.  How he wished now that he had kept a flag flying from the spot on which he stood!  How he wished he now had a signal to fix on this height!  Though the boat-people were still too far off to distinguish figures, a signal might catch their eye.  If he went to the Red-hill for a flag, the boat might be gone away before his return.  Trembling with haste, he stripped off his shirt, and swung it in the air.  He even mounted the top stone, which, surrounded by no wall, or other defence, hung over the waters below.  Oliver would have said, half an hour before, that he could not have stood alone on this perilous point: now, he not only stood there, but waved his white signal with all his strength.",be doubt speck boat come see large boat full distinguish figure heavy seem mass person goods crowd come heart beat fast come wish keep flag fly spot stand wish have signal fix height boat person distinguish figure signal catch eye go red flag boat go return tremble haste stripp shirt swing air mount top stone surround wall other defence hang water say hour stand alone perilous point stand wave white signal strength

6,"He once thought he saw what might have been an oar lifted in the air; but he was not sure.  He was presently only too certain of something else--that the boat was moving away, not in the direction in which it had approached, but southwards.  He tried, as long as he could, to disbelieve this; but there it went--away--away--and Oliver had to come down from his stone, put on his clothes again, and find how thirsty he was.",think see oar lift air sure certain else boat move direction approach try disbelieve go have come stone put clothes find thirsty 
7,"There was hope still, he felt--great hope: but he must keep it from Mildred, who was in no condition to bear the disappointment of such a hope.  He doubted whether Ailwin could control her tongue and her countenance, while possessed of such news.  It would be hard not to be able to tell any one of what so filled his thoughts; and he resolved to see first what state Roger was in.",be hope feel great hope keep condition bear disappointment hope doubt control tongue countenance possess such news hard able tell one fill thought resolve see first state 
8,"When he reached the tent, Roger was not there.  Ailwin could not tell where he was.  He had staggered away, like a drunken person, she said-- he seemed so giddy; but she could not leave Mildred to see after him, though he had spoken to a lord; if indeed that could be true of a boy like him.  Ailwin looked up at the clouds, every moment, as she spoke; and Mildred shivered, as if she missed the morning sunshine.  Oliver saw that he must make ready for the storm, before he prepared for what might follow.  He and Ailwin pulled down the long piece of cloth from its support, doubled it again and again, and put Mildred into the middle of it.  Oliver longed to lay her under a leafy tree; but he dared not, on account of the lightning, which was already beginning to flash.  He and Ailwin set up the deal table as a sort of penthouse over her; and then busied themselves, in her sight, in piling together everything else they had, to keep as many articles as possible from spoiling.",reach tent tell stagger drunken person say seem giddy leave see speak lord true boy look cloud moment speak shiver miss morning sunshine see make ready storm prepare follow pull long piece cloth support double put middle long lay leafy tree dare account lightning begin flash set deal table sort penthouse busy sight pile else have keep many article possible spoil 
9,"Oliver was just thinking that he might slip away to seek Roger, when he saw that Mildred was sobbing, under the heap of cloth they had laid upon her.  In a moment he was by her side, saying--",think slip seek see sobb heap cloth lay moment side say 
10,"""What is the matter, dear?  Are you afraid of the storm?  I never knew you afraid of thunder and lightning; but perhaps you may be now, because you are ill.""",matter dear afraid storm know afraid thunder lightning ill 
11,"""No,"" sobbed Mildred.",sobb 
12,"""I cannot help being glad of this storm,"" continued Oliver, ""though it is disagreeable, at the time, to people who have no house to go to.  I hope it will clear the air, and freshen it; and that is the very thing we want, to make you better.""",help glad storm continue disagreeable time person have house go hope clear air freshen very thing want make good 
13,"""It is not that, Oliver.  I don't mind the storm at all.""",mind storm 
14,"""Then what makes you cry so, dear?  Is it about Geordie?""",make cry dear 
15,"""Yes.  Something about him that I don't think you know; something that I shall never bear to think of.  It will make me miserable as long as I live.  Do you know, I was tired of nursing him, and hearing him cry; and I gave it up--the only thing I could do for him!  I asked Ailwin to take him.  And in two days he was dead; and I could never do anything for him any more.""",think know bear think make miserable live know tired nurse hear cry give only thing do ask take day dead do more 
16,"Here a burst of grief stopped her voice.  Her brother said, very solemnly,--",burst grief stop voice brother say 
17,"""Now, Mildred, listen to me,--to the little I can say--for you know I cannot, in this place, stay and talk with you as we should both like, and as we might have done at home.  I think you were almost always very kind to Geordie; and I am sure he loved you very dearly.  But I have heard mother say that the worst part of losing dear friends is that we have to blame ourselves, more or less, for our behaviour to them,--even to those we loved the very most.  So I will not flatter you, dear: though I don't at all wonder at your being tired of hearing Geordie cry that day.  I will not say whether you were right or wrong; but only put you in mind that we may always ask for pardon.  Remember, too, that you may meet Geordie again; and perhaps be kinder to him than we ever are to one another here.  Now I will go, and come back again soon.""",listen little say know place stay talk like do home think kind sure love hear mother say bad part lose dear friend have blame more behaviour love most flatter dear wonder tired hear cry day say right wrong put mind ask pardon remember meet kind go come 
18,"""Stop one minute,"" implored Mildred.  ""I dreamed that you all went away from this hill, and left me alone.""",stop minute implore dream go hill leave 
19,"As she said this, she looked at her brother, with such a painful wistfulness, that he saw that she had had a fever-dream, and was not yet quite clear from its remains.  He laughed, as at something ridiculous; which Mildred seemed to like: and then he reminded her more gravely, that they could not get away from this place if they would.  If an opportunity should occur, he assured her he would not leave hold of her hand.  Nothing should make him step into a boat without her.  Poor Mildred had fancied, bewildered as she was this morning, that if Oliver knew of what she had done about George, he would think himself justified in leaving her to perish on the hill; and yet she could not help telling him.  Her mind was relieved, for the present, and she let him go.",say look brother painful wistfulness see have fever dream clear remains laugh ridiculous seem like remind get place opportunity occur assure leave hold hand make step boat poor fancy bewilder morning know do think justify leave perish hill help tell mind relieve present let go 
20,"He found Roger where he first looked for him,--near the mummy.  The poor lad was too ill to stand; but he lay on the slimy bank, poking and grubbing, with a stick and with his fingers, as deep in the soft soil as he could penetrate.  Oliver saw that he had found some more curiosities;--bunches of nuts,--nuts which were ripening on the tree many hundreds of seasons ago; but which no hand had plucked till now. Oliver could neither wonder nor admire, at this moment: nor was he vexed (as he might have been at another time) at Roger's crawling hither, in pursuit of gain, to be made more ill by every breath he drew while stooping over the rank mud.",find look mummy poor lad ill stand lay slimy bank poke grubb stick finger deep soft soil penetrate see find more curiosity bunch nut nut ripen tree many hundred season hand pluck wonder admire moment vex time crawl pursuit gain make ill breath draw stoop rank mud 
21,"""Don't be afraid, Roger,"" said Oliver.  ""I am not going to touch your findings, or meddle with you.  I want you to change your clothes,--to put off that finery,--and to let me know where the bag of money is that you took out of the chest.""",afraid say go touch finding meddle want change clothes put finery let know bag money take chest

24,"""Boat!"" exclaimed Roger.",boat exclaim 
25,"""Yes: a boat may come, you know; and we must not detain it, if such a thing should happen.  If you die without restoring that money, Roger, it will be a sin upon your soul: so tell me where it is, and have an easy mind, I advise you.  That will be a good thing, if you live an hundred years.""",boat come know detain thing happen die restore money sin soul tell have easy mind advise good thing live year 
26,"""There is a boat here now!  You are going to leave me behind!"" cried Roger, scrambling up on his feet, and falling again from weakness, two or three times.  ""I knew it,"" he continued; ""I dreamt it all last night; and it is going to come true to-day.""",be boat go leave cry scramble foot fall weakness time know continue dreamt last night go come true day 
27,"""Mildred dreamed the same thing; and it is because you are both ill,"" said Oliver.  ""Lean upon me--as heavily as you like--and I will go home with you, as slowly as you will, if you will tell me where the money-bag is.  You will find no boat there now, whatever there may be by-and-by: but if you will not tell me where the money-bag is, I will shake you off now, and leave you here.  It is another person's money: and I must have it.""",dream same thing ill say lean like go tell money bag find boat tell money bag shake leave person money have 
28,"Roger said he would tell, if Oliver would promise him not to leave him alone on the island.  Oliver assured him that there was no danger whatever of the deliverers of some of the party leaving others to perish.  He owned that he was bound to make his sister his first care, and Ailwin his next.  As boys, Roger and himself must be satisfied to be thought of last; but he hoped they should neither of them do an ill turn by the other.  He asked if Roger had ever received an ill turn from him.",say tell promise leave island assure be danger deliverer party leave other perish own bind make sister first care next boy satisfy think last hope do ill turn other ask receive ill turn

37,"""I am not going to keep it.  Do you go and find it, if you like, for I can't.  It is in a hollow elm that stands between two beeches, on the other side of the wood.  There is a little cross cut in the bark, on the south side--that will help you to find it.  But don't you go till you have got me to the tent.""",go keep go find like hollow elm stand beeche other side wood be little cross cut bark south side help find go get tent 
38,"Oliver helped him home, amidst lightning and splashing rain, explaining as they went why the tent was down, but thinking it best to say nothing of the boat to one so weak-spirited as Roger was now.  He then ran off, and found the money-bag.  He wished the weather would clear, that he might look out again: but, meanwhile, he felt that he was not losing time in collecting together all the goods that were on the hill; for the tempest so darkened and filled the air, that he knew he could not have seen a furlong into the distance, if he had been on his perch at this moment.  He wore his mother's watch in his pocket, feeling as if it promised that he should meet her again, to put it back into her hands.",help lightning splash rain explain go tent think good say boat weak spirit run find money bag wish weather clear look feel lose time collect goods hill tempest darken fill air know see furlong distance perch moment wear mother watch pocket feel promise meet put hand 
39,"""Now, Oliver,"" said Ailwin, ""I am vexed with you that you did not sleep while you might, before this growling, splashing weather came on, and while there was something of a shelter over your head.  If you don't go to sleep the minute this tempest is over, I must see what I must do to you: for you will be having the fever else; and then what is to become of me, among you all, I should like to know?  I wish you would creep in now between the mattresses under the tree, and never think of the storm, but go to sleep like a good boy.  It is hardly likely that the lightning should strike that particular tree, just while you are under it.""",say vex sleep growling splashing weather come be shelter head go sleep minute tempest see do have fever else become like know wish creep mattress tree think storm go sleep good boy likely lightning strike particular tree

41,"""Oliver!  How can you talk so?  How dare you think of such a shocking thing?""",talk think shocking thing 
42,"""You put it into my head, Ailwin.  But come--let me tell you a thing I want you to do, if I should be away when it stops raining.  Here are Roger's old clothes, safe and dry here between the beds.  When it leaves off raining, make him pull off his wet finery, and put on his own dry things; and keep that finery somewhere out of his way, that I may put it back into the chest, where it ought to be lying now.  Will you do this, Ailwin?""",put head come let tell thing want do stop rain old clothes safe dry bed leave rain make pull wet finery put own dry thing keep finery way put chest lie do 
43,"""Why, I'll see.  If I was quite sure that he had nothing to do with this storm, I might manage him as I could any other boy.""",see sure have do storm manage other boy

If you only remember how George cried after him, you will be gentle with him, I know.""",manage day little kindness ill weak spirit touch heart word remember cry gentle know 
45,"""Well, that's true: and I doubt whether a lord would have spoken with him, if he had been so dangerous as he seems sometimes.  Now, as to dinner to-day, Oliver--I really don't like to give Mildred such food as the game on the island now is.  I am sure it is downright unwholesome.

52,"Ailwin might wonder, for Oliver was indeed very restless.  While waiting the moment when he might again cross to the staircase, he could not even stand still under a tree.  The secret of his having seen the boat was too heavy a one to be borne when he was no longer busy.  He felt that he should tell, if he remained beside his sister and Ailwin; so he wandered off, through the wood, to try how far he could see over the waters to the south, now that the tempest was passing away.",wonder restless wait moment cross staircase stand tree secret see boat heavy one borne busy feel tell remain sister wander wood try see water south tempest pass 
53,"Through the trees he saw some one--a tall person, walking on the grass by the water-side.  He ran--he flew.  There was a boat lying against the bank, and two or three men walking towards the wood.  The foremost was Pastor Dendel.  Oliver sprang into his arms, clung round his neck for a moment, and then fainted away.",tree see tall person walk grass water side run fly be boat lie bank man walk wood foremost spring arm cling neck moment faint
