2," Most men on suddenly finding themselves in possession of such enormous wealth would have felt some elation. Ventimore, as we have seen, was merely exasperated. And, although this attitude of his may strike the reader as incomprehensible or absolutely wrong-headed, he had more reason on his side than might appear at a first view.",most man find possession such enormous wealth feel elation see exasperated attitude strike reader incomprehensible wrong head have more reason side appear first view 
3,"It was undoubtedly the fact that, with the money these treasures represented, he would be in a position to convulse the money markets of Europe and America, bring society to his feet, make and unmake kingdoms--dominate, in short, the entire world.",fact money treasure represent position convulse money market bring society foot make unmake kingdom dominate short entire world 
4,"""But, then,"" as Horace told himself with a groan, ""it wouldn't amuse me in the least to convulse money markets. Do I want to see the smartest people in London grovelling for anything they think they're likely to get out of me? As I should be perfectly well aware that their homage was not paid to any personal merit of mine, I could hardly consider it flattering. And why should I make kingdoms? The only thing I understand and care about is making houses. Then, am I likely to be a better hand at dominating the world than all the others who have tried the experiment?

5,"He called to mind all the millionaires he had ever read or heard of; they didn't seem to get much fun out of their riches. The majority of them were martyrs to dyspepsia. They were often weighed down by the cares and responsibilities of their position; the only people who were unable to obtain an audience of them at any time were their friends; they lived in a glare of publicity, and every post brought them hundreds of begging letters, and a few threats; their children were in constant danger from kidnappers, and they themselves, after knowing no rest in life, could not be certain that even their tombs would be undisturbed. Whether they were extravagant or thrifty, they were equally maligned, and, whatever the fortune they left behind them, they could be absolutely certain that, in a couple of generations, it would be entirely dissipated.",call mind millionaire read hear seem get much fun rich majority martyr dyspepsia weigh care responsibility position only person unable obtain audience time friend live glare publicity post bring hundred begg letter few threat child constant danger kidnapper know rest life certain tomb undisturbed extravagant thrifty malign fortune leave certain couple generation dissipate

7,"But there was another consideration--how was he to realise all this wealth? He knew enough about precious stones to be aware that a ruby, for instance, of the true ""pigeon's blood"" colour and the size of a melon, as most of these rubies were, would be worth, even when cut, considerably over a million; but who would buy it?",be consideration realise wealth know precious stone aware ruby instance true pigeon blood colour size melon most ruby worth cut buy 
8,"""I think I see myself,"" he reflected grimly, ""calling on some diamond merchant in Hatton Garden with half a dozen assorted jewels in a Gladstone bag. If he believed they were genuine, he'd probably have a fit; but most likely he'd think I'd invented some dodge for manufacturing them, and had been fool enough to overdo the size. Anyhow, he'd want to know how they came into my possession, and what could I say? That they were part of a little present made to me by a Jinnee in grateful acknowledgment of my having relieved him from a brass bottle in which he'd been shut up for nearly three thousand years? Look at it how you will, it's _not_ convincing. I fancy I can guess what he'd say. And what an ass I should look!

As if it were possible in these days for a young and hitherto unemployed architect suddenly to surround himself with wondrous carpets, and gold vessels, and gigantic jewels without attracting the notice of some enterprising journalist.

She would naturally be repelled, as any nice-minded girl would be, by the idea that her lover was in secret alliance with a supernatural being. And her father and mother--would they allow her to marry a man, however rich, whose wealth came from such a questionable source?

Explain the matter.""",day old say man pursue wealth amass satisfy desire have rich become contemptible mortal eye findest encumbrance explain matter 
51,"Horace felt a natural delicacy in giving his real reasons. ""I can't answer for other men,"" he said. ""All I know is that I've never been accustomed to being rich, and I'd rather get used to it gradually, and be able to feel that I owed it, as far as possible, to my own exertions. For, as I needn't tell _you_, Mr. Fakrash, riches alone don't make any fellow happy. You must have observed that they're apt to--well, to land him in all kinds of messes and worries....

Yet even he doth not utterly despise them, for he hath gold and ivory and precious stones in abundance. Nor hitherto have I ever met a human being capable of rejecting them when offered. But, since thou seemest sincere in holding that my poor and paltry gifts will not advance thy welfare, and since I would do thee good and not evil--be it even as thou wouldst.

53,"Horace could hardly believe that he had really prevailed. ""It's extremely good of you, sir,"" he said, ""to take it so well. And if you _could_ let that caravan call for them as soon as possible, it would be a great convenience to me. I mean--er--the fact is, I'm expecting a few friends to dine with me to-morrow, and, as my rooms are rather small at the best of times, I don't quite know how I can manage to entertain them at all unless something is done.""",believe prevail good sir say take let caravan call possible great convenience mean fact expect few friend dine room small good time know manage entertain do

""I might have kept some of those tissues and things for Sylvia,"" he thought; ""and she loves pearls. And a prayer-carpet would have pleased the Professor tremendously. But no, after all, it wouldn't have done. Sylvia couldn't go about in pearls the size of new potatoes, and the Professor would only have ragged me for more reckless extravagance.
