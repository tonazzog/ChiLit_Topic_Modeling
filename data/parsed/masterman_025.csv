2,"Mr Seagrave and Ready then continued their way along the beach, until they arrived at the point which the latter had considered as a convenient place to make the garden.  They found a sufficiency of mould; and as the point was narrow at its joining on to the mainland, no great length of enclosure would be required.",ready continue way beach arrive point latter consider convenient place make garden find sufficiency mould point narrow join mainland great length enclosure require 
3,"""You see, sir,"" said Ready, ""we can wait till after the rainy season is over before we put up the fence, and we can prepare it in the meantime, when the weather will permit us to work.  The seeds and potatoes will not come up until after the rains are finished; so all we have to do is to dig up the ground, and put them in as fast as we can.  We cannot make a large garden this year; but our potatoes we must contrive to get in, if we cannot manage anything else.""",see sir say ready wait rainy season put fence prepare meantime weather permit work seed potato come rain finish have do dig ground put make large garden year potato contrive get manage else 
4,"""If we have no fence to make,"" replied Mr Seagrave, ""I think we shall be able to clear away quite enough ground in a week to put in all that we require.""",have fence make reply think able clear enough ground week put require 
5,"""The first job will be to pull up the small brushwood,"" said Ready, ""and turn up the ground; the larger plants we must leave, if we have not time.  Tommy might be of some use here in taking away the shrubs as you pull them up; but we had better now go on to the grove, and choose the spot for cutting down the trees.  I have made my mark.""",first job pull small brushwood say ready turn ground large plant leave have time use take shrub pull have good go grove choose spot cut tree make mark 
6,"Ready and Mr Seagrave proceeded in the direction which the former had pointed out, until they arrived at a spot on a rising ground, where the trees were so thick that it was not very easy to pass through them.",ready proceed direction former point arrive spot rise ground tree thick easy pass 
7,"""There is the place,"" said Ready.  ""I propose to cut all the timber we want for the houses out of this part of the grove, and to leave an open square place, in the centre of which we will build our storerooms.  You see, sir, if necessary, with a very little trouble we might turn it into a place of protection and defence, as a few palisades here and there between the trees would make it, what they call in the East Indies, a stockade.""",be place say ready propose cut timber want house part grove leave open square place centre build storeroom see sir necessary little trouble turn place protection defence few palisadd tree make call stockade 
8,"""Very true, but I trust we shall not require it for such a purpose.""",true trust require purpose 
9,"""I hope so too, but there is nothing like being prepared; however, we have plenty to do before we can think of that.  Now, sir, as dinner is ready, suppose we return, and after dinner we will both commence our tasks.""",hope be prepare have plenty do think sir dinner ready suppose return dinner commence task 
10,"Juno and William returned to the dinner which Mrs Seagrave had prepared.  They were both very warm with their work, which was very hard, but very eager to finish their task.  After dinner was over, Mrs Seagrave requested her husband, as he was about to go down to the point, with the spade and a small hatchet in his hand, to take Tommy with him, as she had a great deal to do, and could not watch him as well as the baby and Caroline.  So Mr Seagrave took Tommy by the hand, and led him to the point, and made him sit down close to him while he cleared away the brushwood.",return dinner prepare warm work hard eager finish task dinner request husband about go point spade small hatchet hand take have great deal do watch baby take hand lead point make sit clear brushwood 
11,"Mr Seagrave worked very hard, and when he had cut down and cleared a portion of the ground, he made Tommy carry away to a little distance, and pile in a heap, the bushes which he had cleared away.  When Mr Seagrave had cleared away a large piece of ground with his hatchet, he then took his spade to dig at the roots and turn up the mould, leaving Tommy to amuse himself.  What Tommy did for about an hour, during which Mr Seagrave worked very diligently, his father did not observe; but all of a sudden he began to cry; and when his father asked him the reason, he did not answer, but only cried the more, until at last he put his hands to his stomach, and roared most lustily.  As he appeared to be in very great pain, his father left off work, and led him up to the tent, when Mrs Seagrave came out, alarmed at his cries.  Ready, who had heard Tommy screaming for so long a while, thought that there might be something serious, and left his work to ascertain the cause.  When he heard what had passed, he said:",work cut clear portion ground make carry little distance pile heap bush clear clear large piece ground hatchet take spade dig root turn mould leave amuse do hour work father observe begin cry father ask reason answer cry more last put hand stomach roar most appear great pain father leave work lead tent come alarm cry ready hear scream while think be serious leave work ascertain cause hear pass say

13,"""Berries,"" roared Tommy.",berry roar 
14,"""I thought as much, ma'am,"" said Ready.  ""I must go and see what the berries were.""  And the old man hastened down to the place where Mr Seagrave had been at work.  In the meantime Mrs Seagrave was much alarmed lest the child should have poisoned himself, and Mr Seagrave went to search among the medicines for some castor-oil.",think much say ready go see berries old man hasten place work meantime alarm child poison go search medicine castor oil 
15,"Ready returned just as he came back to the tent with the bottle of castor-oil, and he told Ready that he was about to give Tommy a dose.",ready return come tent bottle castor oil tell ready about give dose 
16,"""Well, sir,"" replied Ready, who had a plant in his hand, ""I don't think you should give him any, for it appears to me that he has taken too much already.  This is, if I recollect right, the castor-oil plant, and here are some of the castor-oil beans which Master Tommy has been eating. Tell me, Tommy, did you eat them?""",sir reply ready have plant hand think give appear take much recollect right castor oil plant castor oil bean eat tell eat 
17,"""Yes,"" cried Tommy.",cry 
18,"""I thought so: give him a little warm drink, ma'am, and he'll soon be better: it will teach him not to eat berries or beans again.""",think give little warm drink good teach eat berries bean 
19,"What Ready said was true; nevertheless Master Tommy was very ill for the whole of the day, and was put early to bed.",ready say true ill whole day put bed
