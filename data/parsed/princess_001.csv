I have seen little princesses behave like the children of thieves and lying beggars, and that is why they need, to be told they are princesses. And that is why, when I tell a story of this kind, I like to tell it about a princess. Then I can say better what I mean, because I can then give her every beautiful thing I want her to have._""",little girl princess be need say danger forget rank behave grow mud see little princess behave child thief lie beggar need tell princess tell story kind like tell princess say good mean give beautiful thing want have

12,"There was once a little princess whose father was king over a great country full of mountains and valleys. His palace was built upon one of the mountains, and was very grand and beautiful. The princess, whose name was Irene, was born there, but she was sent soon after her birth, because her mother was not very strong, to be brought up by country people in a large house, half castle, half farm-house, on the side of another mountain, about halfway between its base and its peak.",be little princess father king great country full mountain valley palace build mountain grand beautiful princess name bear send birth mother strong bring country person large house half castle half farm house side mountain base peak 
13,"The princess was a sweet little creature, and at the time my story begins was about eight years old. I think, but she got older very fast. Her face was fair and pretty, with eyes like two bits of night-sky, each with a star dissolved in the blue. Those eyes you would have thought must have known they came from there, so often were they turned up in that direction. The ceiling of her nursery was blue, with stars in it, as like the sky as they could make it. But I doubt if ever she saw the real sky with the stars in it, for a reason which I had better mention at once.",princess sweet little creature time story begin year old think get old fast face fair pretty eye bit night sky star dissolve blue eye think know come turn direction ceiling nursery blue star sky make doubt see real sky star reason have good mention 
14,"These mountains were full of hollow places underneath; huge caverns, and winding ways, some with water running through them, and some shining with all colors of the rainbow when a light was taken in. There would not have been much known about them, had there not been mines there, great deep pits, with long galleries and passages running off from them, which had been dug to get at the ore of which the mountains were full. In the course of digging, the miners came upon many of these natural caverns. A few of them had far-off openings out on the side of a mountain, or into a ravine.",mountain full hollow place huge cavern wind way water run shine color rainbow light take be much know be mine great deep pit long gallery passage run dig get ore mountain full course digging miner come many natural cavern few have opening side mountain ravine 
15,"Now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings, called by some gnomes, by some kobolds, by some goblins. There was a legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground, and were very like other people. But for some reason or other, concerning which there were different legendary theories, the king had laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them, or had required observances of them they did not like, or had begun to treat them with more severity in some way or other, and impose stricter laws; and the consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the country. According to the legend, however, instead of going to some other country, they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns, whence they never came out but at night, and then seldom showed themselves in any numbers, and never to many people at once. It was only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains that they were said to gather even at night in the open air. Those who had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in the course of generations; and no wonder, seeing they lived away from the sun, in cold and wet and dark places. They were now, not ordinarily ugly, but either absolutely hideous, or ludicrously grotesque both in face and form. There was no invention, they said, of the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil, that could surpass the extravagance of their appearance. And as they grew mis-shapen in body, they had grown in knowledge and cleverness, and now were able to do things no mortal could see the possibility of. But as they grew in cunning, they grew in mischief, and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy the people who lived in the open-air-story above them. They had enough of affection left for each other, to preserve them from being absolutely cruel for cruelty's sake to those that came in their way; but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those who occupied their former possession, and especially against the descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion, that they sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as their inventors; and although dwarfed and mis-shapen, they had strength equal to their cunning. In the process of time they had got a king, and a government of their own, whose chief business, beyond their own simple affairs, was to devise trouble for their neighbors. It will now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at night. They were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of the house then, even in company with ever so many attendants; and they had good reason, as we shall see by-and-by.",subterranean cavern live strange race being call gnome kobold goblin be legend current country time live ground other person reason other concern be different legendary theory king lay think severe tax require observance like begin treat more severity way other impose stricter law consequence disappear face country accord legend go other country take refuge subterranean cavern come night show number many person least frequent difficult part mountain say gather night open air catch sight say alter course generation wonder see live sun cold wet dark place ugly hideous grotesque face form be invention say lawless imagination express pen pencil surpass extravagance appearance grow mis-shapen body grow knowledge cleverness able do thing mortal see possibility grow cunning grow mischief great delight way think annoy person live open air story have enough affection leave other preserve cruel cruelty sake come way cherish ancestral grudge occupy former possession descendant king cause expulsion seek opportunity torment way odd inventor dwarf mis-shapen have strength equal cunning process time get king government own chief business own simple affair devise trouble neighbor evident little princess see sky night afraid goblin let house company many attendant have good reason see
