1,CHAPTER XXV. IN BALQUHIDDER,
2,"At the door of the first house we came to, Alan knocked, which was of no very safe enterprise in such a part of the Highlands as the Braes of Balquhidder. No great clan held rule there; it was filled and disputed by small septs, and broken remnants, and what they call “chiefless folk,” driven into the wild country about the springs of Forth and Teith by the advance of the Campbells. Here were Stewarts and Maclarens, which came to the same thing, for the Maclarens followed Alan’s chief in war, and made but one clan with Appin. Here, too, were many of that old, proscribed, nameless, red-handed clan of the Macgregors. They had always been ill-considered, and now worse than ever, having credit with no side or party in the whole country of Scotland. Their chief, Macgregor of Macgregor, was in exile; the more immediate leader of that part of them about Balquhidder, James More, Rob Roy’s eldest son, lay waiting his trial in Edinburgh Castle; they were in ill-blood with Highlander and Lowlander, with the Grahames, the Maclarens, and the Stewarts; and Alan, who took up the quarrel of any friend, however distant, was extremely wishful to avoid them.",door first house come knock safe enterprise part great clan hold rule fill dispute small sept break remnant call chiefless folk drive wild country spring advance come same thing follow chief war make clan many old proscribe nameless red handed clan ill consider bad have credit side party whole country chief exile immediate leader part old son lay wait trial ill blood take quarrel friend distant wishful avoid 
3,"Chance served us very well; for it was a household of Maclarens that we found, where Alan was not only welcome for his name’s sake but known by reputation. Here then I was got to bed without delay, and a doctor fetched, who found me in a sorry plight. But whether because he was a very good doctor, or I a very young, strong man, I lay bedridden for no more than a week, and before a month I was able to take the road again with a good heart.",chance serve household find welcome name sake know reputation get bed delay doctor fetched find sorry plight good doctor young strong man lay bedridden more week month able take road good heart 
4,"All this time Alan would not leave me though I often pressed him, and indeed his foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with the two or three friends that were let into the secret. He hid by day in a hole of the braes under a little wood; and at night, when the coast was clear, would come into the house to visit me. I need not say if I was pleased to see him; Mrs. Maclaren, our hostess, thought nothing good enough for such a guest; and as Duncan Dhu (which was the name of our host) had a pair of pipes in his house, and was much of a lover of music, this time of my recovery was quite a festival, and we commonly turned night into day.",time leave press foolhardiness stay common subject outcry friend let secret hide day hole brae little wood night coast clear come house visit say pleased see hostess think good guest name host have pair pipe house much lover music time recovery festival turn night day 
5,"The soldiers let us be; although once a party of two companies and some dragoons went by in the bottom of the valley, where I could see them through the window as I lay in bed. What was much more astonishing, no magistrate came near me, and there was no question put of whence I came or whither I was going; and in that time of excitement, I was as free of all inquiry as though I had lain in a desert. Yet my presence was known before I left to all the people in Balquhidder and the adjacent parts; many coming about the house on visits and these (after the custom of the country) spreading the news among their neighbours. The bills, too, had now been printed. There was one pinned near the foot of my bed, where I could read my own not very flattering portrait and, in larger characters, the amount of the blood money that had been set upon my life. Duncan Dhu and the rest that knew that I had come there in Alan’s company, could have entertained no doubt of who I was; and many others must have had their guess. For though I had changed my clothes, I could not change my age or person; and Lowland boys of eighteen were not so rife in these parts of the world, and above all about that time, that they could fail to put one thing with another, and connect me with the bill. So it was, at least. Other folk keep a secret among two or three near friends, and somehow it leaks out; but among these clansmen, it is told to a whole countryside, and they will keep it for a century.",soldier let party company dragoon go bottom valley see window lay bed astonish magistrate come be question put come go time excitement free inquiry lain desert presence know leave person adjacent part many come house visit custom country spread news neighbour bill print be pinn foot bed read own flattering portrait large character amount blood money set life rest know come company entertain doubt many other have guess change clothes change age person lowland boy rife part world time fail put thing connect bill least other folk keep secret near friend leak clansmen tell whole countryside keep century 
6,"There was but one thing happened worth narrating; and that is the visit I had of Robin Oig, one of the sons of the notorious Rob Roy. He was sought upon all sides on a charge of carrying a young woman from Balfron and marrying her (as was alleged) by force; yet he stepped about Balquhidder like a gentleman in his own walled policy. It was he who had shot James Maclaren at the plough stilts, a quarrel never satisfied; yet he walked into the house of his blood enemies as a rider* might into a      public inn.* Commercial traveller.",be thing happen worth narrate visit have son notorious seek side charge carry young woman marry allege force step gentleman own walled policy shoot plough stilt quarrel satisfy walk house blood enemy rider public inn commercial traveller 
7,"Duncan had time to pass me word of who it was; and we looked at one another in concern. You should understand, it was then close upon the time of Alan’s coming; the two were little likely to agree; and yet if we sent word or sought to make a signal, it was sure to arouse suspicion in a man under so dark a cloud as the Macgregor.",have time pass word look concern understand close time come little likely agree send word seek make signal sure arouse suspicion man dark cloud 
8,"He came in with a great show of civility, but like a man among inferiors; took off his bonnet to Mrs. Maclaren, but clapped it on his head again to speak to Duncan; and having thus set himself (as he would have thought) in a proper light, came to my bedside and bowed.",come great show civility man inferior take bonnet clapp head speak set think proper light come bedside bow 
9,"“I am given to know, sir,” says he, “that your name is Balfour.”",give know sir say name 
10,"“They call me David Balfour,” said I, “at your service.”",call say service 
11,"“I would give ye my name in return, sir,” he replied, “but it’s one somewhat blown upon of late days; and it’ll perhaps suffice if I tell ye that I am own brother to James More Drummond or Macgregor, of whom ye will scarce have failed to hear.”",give name return sir reply blow late day suffice tell own brother more fail hear 
12,"“No, sir,” said I, a little alarmed; “nor yet of your father, Macgregor-Campbell.” And I sat up and bowed in bed; for I thought best to compliment him, in case he was proud of having had an outlaw to his father.",sir say little alarmed father sit bow bed think good compliment case proud have outlaw father 
13,"He bowed in return. “But what I am come to say, sir,” he went on, “is this. In the year ‘45, my brother raised a part of the ‘Gregara’ and marched six companies to strike a stroke for the good side; and the surgeon that marched with our clan and cured my brother’s leg when it was broken in the brush at Preston Pans, was a gentleman of the same name precisely as yourself. He was brother to Balfour of Baith; and if you are in any reasonable degree of nearness one of that gentleman’s kin, I have come to put myself and my people at your command.”",bow return come say sir go year brother raise part march company strike stroke good side surgeon march clan cure brother leg break brush gentleman same name brother reasonable degree nearness gentleman kin come put person command 
14,"You are to remember that I knew no more of my descent than any cadger’s dog; my uncle, to be sure, had prated of some of our high connections, but nothing to the present purpose; and there was nothing left me but that bitter disgrace of owning that I could not tell.",remember know more descent cadger dog uncle sure prate high connection present purpose be leave bitter disgrace own tell 
15,"Robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about, turned his back upon me without a sign of salutation, and as he went towards the door, I could hear him telling Duncan that I was “only some kinless loon that didn’t know his own father.” Angry as I was at these words, and ashamed of my own ignorance, I could scarce keep from smiling that a man who was under the lash of the law (and was indeed hanged some three years later) should be so nice as to the descent of his acquaintances.",tell sorry put turn back sign salutation go door hear tell kinless loon know own father angry word ashamed own ignorance keep smile man lash law hang year nice descent acquaintance 
16,"Just in the door, he met Alan coming in; and the two drew back and looked at each other like strange dogs. They were neither of them big men, but they seemed fairly to swell out with pride. Each wore a sword, and by a movement of his haunch, thrust clear the hilt of it, so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn.",door meet come draw look other strange dog big man seem swell pride wear sword movement haunch thrust clear hilt grasp blade draw 
17,"“Mr. Stewart, I am thinking,” says Robin.",think say 
18,"“Troth, Mr. Macgregor, it’s not a name to be ashamed of,” answered Alan.",name ashamed answer 
19,"“I did not know ye were in my country, sir,” says Robin.",know country sir say 
20,"“It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens,” says Alan.",stick mind country friend say 
21,"“That’s a kittle point,” returned the other. “There may be two words to say to that. But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword?”",kittle point return other be word say think hear man sword 
22,"“Unless ye were born deaf, Mr. Macgregor, ye will have heard a good deal more than that,” says Alan. “I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin; and when my kinsman and captain, Ardshiel, had a talk with a gentleman of your name, not so many years back, I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it.”",bear deaf hear good deal more say only man draw steel kinsman captain have talk gentleman name many year hear have good 
23,"“Do ye mean my father, sir?” says Robin.",mean father sir say 
24,"“Well, I wouldnae wonder,” said Alan. “The gentleman I have in my mind had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name.”",wonder say gentleman have mind have ill taste clap name 
25,"“My father was an old man,” returned Robin.",father old man return 
26,"“The match was unequal. You and me would make a better pair, sir.”",match unequal make good pair sir 
27,"“I was thinking that,” said Alan.",think say 
28,"I was half out of bed, and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting cocks, ready to intervene upon the least occasion. But when that word was uttered, it was a case of now or never; and Duncan, with something of a white face to be sure, thrust himself between.",half bed hang elbow fighting cock ready intervene least occasion word utter case white face sure thrust 
29,"“Gentlemen,” said he, “I will have been thinking of a very different matter, whateffer. Here are my pipes, and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers. It’s an auld dispute which one of ye’s the best. Here will be a braw chance to settle it.”",say think different matter whateffer pipe gentleman baith acclaim piper auld dispute good be braw chance settle 
30,"“Why, sir,” said Alan, still addressing Robin, from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes, nor yet Robin from him, “why, sir,”  says Alan, “I think I will have heard some sough* of the sort. Have ye music, as folk say? Are ye a bit of a piper?”",sir say address much shift eye sir say think hear sough* sort have music folk say bit piper

34,"“I have made bolder words good before now,” returned Robin, “and that against better adversaries.”",make bold word good return good adversary 
35,"“It is easy to try that,” says Alan.",easy try say 
36,"Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his principal possession, and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose, and which is made of old whiskey, strained honey and sweet cream, slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion. The two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel; but down they sat, one upon each side of the peat fire, with a mighty show of politeness. Maclaren pressed them to taste his mutton-ham and “the wife’s brose,” reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection. But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath.",make haste bring pair pipe principal possession set guest mutton ham bottle drink call brose make old whiskey strain honey sweet cream beat right order proportion enemy very breach quarrel sit side peat fire mighty show politeness press taste mutton ham wife brose remind wife have name wide skill confection put hospitality bad breath 
37,"“I would have ye to remark, sir,” said Alan, “that I havenae broken bread for near upon ten hours, which will be worse for the breath than any brose in Scotland.”",have remark sir say havenae break bread hour bad breath brose 
38,"“I will take no advantages, Mr. Stewart,” replied Robin. “Eat and drink; I’ll follow you.”",take advantage reply eat drink follow 
39,"Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to Mrs. Maclaren; and then after a great number of civilities, Robin took the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner.",eat small portion ham drink glass brose great number civility take pipe play little spring rant manner 
40,"“Ay, ye can blow” said Alan; and taking the instrument from his rival, he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin’s; and then wandered into variations, which, as he went on, he decorated with a perfect flight of grace-notes, such as pipers love, and call the “warblers.”",blow say take instrument rival play same spring manner identical wander variation go decorate perfect flight grace note such piper love call warbler 
41,"I had been pleased with Robin’s playing, Alan’s ravished me.",pleased play ravish 
42,"“That’s no very bad, Mr. Stewart,” said the rival, “but ye show a poor device in your warblers.”",bad say rival show poor device warbler 
43,"“Me!” cried Alan, the blood starting to his face. “I give ye the lie.”",cry blood start face give lie 
44,"“Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes, then,” said Robin, “that ye seek to change them for the sword?”",own beat pipe say seek change sword 
45,"“And that’s very well said, Mr. Macgregor,” returned Alan; “and in the meantime” (laying a strong accent on the word) “I take back the lie. I appeal to Duncan.”",say return meantime lay strong accent word take lie appeal 
46,"“Indeed, ye need appeal to naebody,” said Robin. “Ye’re a far better judge than any Maclaren in Balquhidder: for it’s a God’s truth that you’re a very creditable piper for a Stewart. Hand me the pipes.” Alan did as he asked; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of Alan’s variations, which it seemed that he remembered perfectly.",need appeal naebody say good judge truth creditable piper hand pipe ask proceed imitate correct part variation seem remember 
47,"“Ay, ye have music,” said Alan, gloomily.",have music say 
48,"“And now be the judge yourself, Mr. Stewart,” said Robin; and taking up the variations from the beginning, he worked them throughout to so new a purpose, with such ingenuity and sentiment, and with so odd a fancy and so quick a knack in the grace-notes, that I was amazed to hear him.",judge say take variation beginning work new purpose such ingenuity sentiment odd fancy knack grace note amazed hear 
49,"As for Alan, his face grew dark and hot, and he sat and gnawed his fingers, like a man under some deep affront. “Enough!” he cried. “Ye can blow the pipes--make the most of that.” And he made as if to rise.",face grow dark hot sit gnaw finger man deep affront enough cry blow pipe make most make rise 
50,"But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence, and struck into the slow measure of a pibroch. It was a fine piece of music in itself, and nobly played; but it seems, besides, it was a piece peculiar to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan. The first notes were scarce out, before there came a change in his face; when the time quickened, he seemed to grow restless in his seat; and long before that piece was at an end, the last signs of his anger died from him, and he had no thought but for the music.",hold hand ask silence strike slow measure pibroch fine piece music play seem piece peculiar chief favourite first note scarce come change face time quicken seem grow restless seat piece end last sign anger die have thought music 
51,"“Robin Oig,” he said, when it was done, “ye are a great piper. I am not fit to blow in the same kingdom with ye. Body of me! ye have mair music in your sporran than I have in my head! And though it still sticks in my mind that I could maybe show ye another of it with the cold steel, I warn ye beforehand--it’ll no be fair! It would go against my heart to haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can!”",say do great piper fit blow same kingdom body have mair music sporran have head stick mind show cold steel warn fair go heart haggle man blow pipe 
52,"Thereupon that quarrel was made up; all night long the brose was going and the pipes changing hands; and the day had come pretty bright, and the three men were none the better for what they had been taking, before Robin as much as thought upon the road.",quarrel make night brose go pipe change hand day come bright man good take much think road
