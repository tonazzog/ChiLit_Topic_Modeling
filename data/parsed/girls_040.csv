1,CHAPTER 40. A GIPSY MAID.,maid 
2,"In a few moments everyone in Lavender House was made acquainted with Susan's story.  At such a time ceremony was laid aside, dinner forgotten, teachers, pupils, servants all congregated in the grounds, all rushed to the spot where Nan's withered daisies still lay, all peered through the underwood, and all, alas! looked, in vain for the tall dark woman and the little child.  Little Nan, the baby of the school, had been stolen--there were loud and terrified lamentations. Nan's nurse was almost tearing her hair, was rushing frantically here, there, and everywhere.  No one blamed the nurse for leaving her little charge in apparent safety for a few moments, but the poor woman's own distress was pitiable to see.  Mrs Willis took Hester's hand, and told the poor stunned girl that she was sending to Sefton immediately for two or three policemen, and that in the meantime every man on the place should commence the search for the woman and child.",few moment make acquainted story time ceremony lay dinner forget teacher pupil servant congregate grounds rush spot wither daisy lay peer underwood look vain tall dark woman little child little baby school steal be loud terrify lamentation nurse tear hair rush blame nurse leave little charge apparent safety few moment poor woman own distress pitiable see take hand tell poor stunn girl send policemen meantime man place commence search woman child 
3,"""Without any doubt,"" Mrs Willis added, ""we shall soon have our little Nan back again; it is quite impossible that the woman, whoever she is, can have taken her so far away in so short a time.""",doubt add have little impossible woman take short time 
4,"In the meantime, Annie in her bedroom heard the fuss and the noise.  She leaned out of her window and saw Phyllis in the distance; she called to her.  Phyllis ran up, the tears streaming down her cheeks.",meantime bedroom hear fuss noise learn window see distance call run tear stream cheek 
5,"""Oh, something so dreadful!"" she gasped; ""a wicked, wicked woman has stolen little Nan Thornton.  She ran off with her just where the undergrowth is so thick at the end of the shady walk.  It happened to her half an hour ago, and they are all looking, but they cannot find the woman or little Nan anywhere.  Oh, it is so dreadful!  Is that you, Mary?""",dreadful gasp wicked wicked woman steal little run undergrowth thick end shady walk happen hour look find woman little dreadful

7,"""The gipsy,"" she murmured, ""the tall, dark gipsy has taken little Nan!""",gipsy murmure tall dark gipsy take little nan 
8,"Her face was very white, her eyes shone, her lips expressed a firm and almost obstinate determination.  With all her usual impulsiveness, she decided on a course of action--she snatched up a piece of paper and scribbled a hasty line:",face white eye shine lip express firm obstinate determination usual impulsiveness decide course action snatch piece paper scribble hasty line

10,"""Dear Mother-friend,--However badly you think of Annie, Annie loves you with all her heart.  Forgive me, I must go myself to look for little Nan.  That tall, dark woman is a gipsy--I have seen her before; her name is Mother Rachel.  Tell Hetty I won't return until I bring her little sister back.--Your repentant and sorrowful Annie.""",dear mother friend think love heart forgive go look little tall dark woman gipsy see name tell return bring little sister repentant sorrowful 
11,"Annie twisted up the note, directed it to Mrs Willis, and left it on her dressing-table.",twist note direct leave dress table 
12,"Then, with a wonderful amount of forethought for her, she emptied the contents of a little purse into a tiny gingham bag, which she fastened inside the front of her dress.  She put on her shady hat, and threw a shawl across her arm, and then, slipping softly downstairs, she went out through the deserted kitchens, down the back avenue, and past the laurel-bush, until she came to the stile which led into the wood--she was going straight to the gipsies' encampment.",wonderful amount forethought empty content little purse tiny gingham bag fasten front dress put shady hat throw shawl arm slip go desert kitchen back avenue laurel bush come stile lead wood go gipsie encampment 
13,"Annie, with some of the gipsy's characteristics in her own blood, had always taken an extraordinary interest in these queer wandering people. Gipsies had a fascination for her, she loved stories about them; if a gipsy encampment was near, she always begged the teachers to walk in that direction.  Annie had a very vivid imagination, and in the days when she reigned as favourite in the school she used to make up stories for the express benefit of her companions.  These stories, as a rule, always turned upon the gipsies.  Many and many a time had the girls of Lavender House almost gasped with horror as Annie described the queer ways of these people.  For her, personally, their wildness and their freedom had a certain fascination, and she was heard in her gayest moments to remark that she would rather like to be stolen and adopted by a gipsy tribe.",gipsy characteristic own blood take extraordinary interest queer wonder person have fascination love story gipsy encampment begg teacher walk direction have vivid imagination day reign favourite school use make story express benefit companion story rule turn gipsie many many time have girl gasp horror describe queer way person wildness freedom have certain fascination hear gayest moment remark like steal adopt gipsy tribe 
14,"Whenever Annie had an opportunity she chatted with the gipsy wives, and allowed them to tell her fortune, and listened eagerly to their narratives.  When a little child she had once for several months been under the care of a nurse who was a reclaimed gipsy, and this girl had given her all kinds of information about them.  Annie often felt that she quite loved these wild people, and Mother Rachel was the first gipsy she cordially shrank from and disliked.",have opportunity chate gipsy wife allow tell fortune listen narrative little child have several month care nurse reclaim gipsy girl give kind information feel love wild person first gipsy shrank dislike 
15,"When the little girl started now on her wild-goose chase after Nan she was by no means devoid of a plan of action.  The knowledge she had taken so many years to acquire came to her aid, and she determined to use it for Nan's benefit.  She knew that the gipsies, with all their wandering and erratic habits, had a certain attachment, if not for homes, at least for sites; she knew that as a rule they encamped over and over again in the same place; she knew that their wanderings were conducted with method, and their apparently lawless lives governed by strict self-made rules.",little girl start wild goose chase means devoid plan action knowledge take many year acquire come aid determine use benefit know gipsie wonder erratic habit have certain attachment home least site know rule encamp same place know wandering conduct method lawless life govern strict self make rule 
16,"Annie made straight now for the encampment, which stood in a little dell at the other side of the fairies' field.  Here for weeks past the gipsies' tents had been seen; here the gipsy children had played, and the men and women smoked and lain about in the sun.",make encampment stand little dell other side fairy field week gipsie tent see gipsy child play man woman smoke lain sun 
17,"Anne entered the small field now, but uttered no exclamation of surprise when she found that all the tents, with the exception of one, had been removed, and that this tent also was being rapidly taken down by a man and a girl, while a tall boy stood by, holding a donkey by the bridle.",enter small field utter exclamation surprise find tent exception remove tent take man girl tall boy stand hold donkey bridle 
18,"Annie wasted no time in looking for Nan here.  Before the girl and the man could see her, she darted behind a bush, and removing her little bag of money, hid it carefully under some long grass; then she pulled a very bright yellow sash out of her pocket, tied it round her blue cotton dress, and leaving her little shawl also on the ground, tripped gayly up to the tent.",waste time look girl man see dart bush remove little bag money hide long grass pull bright yellow sash pocket tie blue cotton dress leave little shawl ground trip tent 
19,She saw with pleasure that the girl who was helping the man was about her own size.  She went up and touched her on the shoulder.,see pleasure girl help man own size go touch shoulder 
20,"""Look here,"" she said, ""I want to make such a pretty play by-and-by--I want to play that I'm a gipsy girl.  Will you give me your clothes, if I give you mine?  See, mine are neat, and this sash is very handsome. Will you have them?  Do.  I am so anxious to play at being a gipsy.""",look say want make pretty play want play gipsy girl give clothes give see neat sash handsome have anxious play gipsy 
21,The girl turned and stared.  Annie's pretty blue print and gay sash were certainly tempting bait.  She glanced at her father.,girl turn stare pretty blue print gay sash tempting bait glance father 
22,"""The little lady wants to change,"" she said in an eager voice.",little lady want change say eager voice 
23,"The man nodded acquiescence, and the girl taking Annie's hand, ran quickly with her to the bottom of the field.",man nod acquiescence girl take hand run bottom field 
24,"""You don't mean it, surely?"" she said.  ""Eh, but I'm uncommon willing.""",mean say uncommon willing 
25,"""Yes, I certainly mean it,"" said Annie.  ""You are a dear, good, obliging girl, and how nice you will look in my pretty blue cotton!  I like that striped petticoat of yours, too, and that gay handkerchief you wear round your shoulders.  Thank you so very much.  Now, do I look like a real, real gipsy?""",mean say dear good obliging girl nice look pretty blue cotton like stripe petticoat gay handkerchief wear shoulder thank look real real gipsy

27,"""Oh, clip it, then; clip it away.  I want to be quite the real thing. Have you got a pair of scissors?""",clip clip want real thing get pair scissors 
28,"The girl ran back to the tent, and presently returned to shear poor Annie's beautiful hair in truly rough fashion.",girl run tent return shear poor beautiful hair rough fashion 
29,"""Now, miss, you look much more like, only your arms are a bit too white. Stay, we has got some walnut-juice; we was just a-using of it.  I'll touch you up fine, miss.""",miss look arm bit white stay get walnut juice a-use touch fine miss 
30,"So she did, darkening Annie's brown skin to a real gipsy tone.",darken brown skin real gipsy tone 
31,"""You're, a dear, good girl,"" said Annie, in conclusion; and as the girl's father called her roughly at this moment, she was obliged to go away, looking ungainly enough in the English child's neat clothes.",dear good girl say conclusion girl father call moment oblige go look english child neat clothes
