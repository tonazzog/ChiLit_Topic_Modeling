3," The minds of young people are now manufactured like webs of linen, all alike, and nothing left to nature. From the hour when children can speak, till they come to years of discretion or of indiscretion, they are carefully prompted what to say, and what to think, and what to look, and how to feel; while in most school-rooms nature has been turned out of doors with obloquy, and art has entirely supplanted her.",mind young person manufacture web linen alike leave nature hour child speak come year discretion indiscretion prompt say think look feel most school room nature turn door obloquy art supplant 
4,"When a quarrel takes place, both parties are generally in some degree to blame; therefore if Art and Nature could yet be made to go hand in hand towards the formation of character and principles, a graceful and beautiful superstructure might be reared, on the solid foundation of Christian faith and sound morality; so that while many natural weeds and wild flowers would be pruned and carefully trained, some lovely blossoms that spring spontaneously in the uncultivated soil, might still be cherished into strength and beauty, far excelling what can be planted or reared by art.",quarrel take place party degree blame make go hand hand formation character principle graceful beautiful superstructure rear solid foundation christian faith sound morality many natural weed wild flower prun train lovely blossom spring uncultivated soil cherish strength beauty excell plant rear art 
5,"Every infant is probably born with a character as peculiar to himself as the features in his countenance, if his faults and good qualities were permitted to expand according to their original tendency; but education, which formerly did too little in teaching ""the young idea how to shoot,"" seems now in danger of over-shooting the mark altogether, by not allowing the young ideas to exist at all. In this age of wonderful mechanical inventions, the very mind of youth seems in danger of becoming a machine; and while every effort is used to stuff the memory, like a cricket-ball, with well-known facts and ready-made opinions, no room is left for the vigour of natural feeling, the glow of natural genius, and the ardour of natural enthusiasm. It was a remark of Sir Walter Scott's many years ago, to the author herself, that in the rising generation there would be no poets, wits, or orators, because all play of imagination is now carefully discouraged, and books written for young persons are generally a mere dry record of facts, unenlivened by any appeal to the heart, or any excitement to the fancy. The catalogue of a child's library would contain Conversations on Natural Philosophy,--on Chemistry,--on Botany,--on Arts and Sciences,--Chronological Records of History,--and travels as dry as a road-book; but nothing on the habits or ways of thinking, natural and suitable to the taste of children; therefore, while such works are delightful to the parents and teachers who select them, the younger community are fed with strong meat instead of milk, and the reading which might be a relaxation from study, becomes a study in itself.",infant bear character peculiar feature countenance fault good quality permit expand accord original tendency education do little teach young idea shoot seem danger shoot mark allow young idea exist age wonderful mechanical invention very mind youth seem danger become machine effort use stuff memory cricket ball know fact ready make opinion room leave vigour natural feeling glow natural genius ardour natural enthusiasm remark many year author rise generation be poet wit orator play imagination discourage book write young person mere dry record fact unenliven appeal heart excitement fancy catalogue child library contain conversation natural philosophy chronological travel dry road book habit way thinking natural suitable taste child such work delightful parent teacher select young community feed strong meat milk reading relaxation study become study 
6,"In these pages the author has endeavoured to paint that species of noisy, frolicsome, mischievous children which is now almost extinct, wishing to preserve a sort of fabulous remembrance of days long past, when young people were like wild horses on the prairies, rather than like well-broken hacks on the road; and when, amidst many faults and many eccentricities, there was still some individuality of character and feeling allowed to remain. In short, as Lord Byron described ""the last man,"" the object of this volume is, to describe ""the last boy."" It may be useful, she thinks, to show, that amidst much requiring to be judiciously curbed and corrected, there may be the germs of high and generous feeling, and of steady, right principle, which should be the chief objects of culture and encouragement. Plodding industry is in the present day at a very high premium in education; but it requires the leaven of mental energy and genius to make it work well, while it has been remarked by one whose experience in education is deep and practical, that ""those boys whose names appear most frequently in the black book of transgression, would sometimes deserve to be also most commonly recorded, if a book were kept for warm affections and generous actions.""",page author endeavour paint species noisy frolicsome mischievous child extinct wish preserve sort fabulous remembrance day long past young person wild horse prairy break hack road many fault many eccentricity be individuality character feeling allow remain short describe last man object volume describe last boy useful think show much require curb correct be germ high generous feeling steady right principle chief object culture encouragement plodd industry present day high premium education require leaven mental energy genius make work remark experience education deep practical boy name appear black book transgression deserve record book keep warm affection generous action 
7,"The most formidable person to meet in society at present, is the mother of a promising boy, about nine or ten years old; because there is no possible escape from a volume of anecdotes, and a complete system of education on the newest principles. The young gentleman has probably asked leave to bring his books to the breakfast-room,--can scarcely be torn away from his studies at the dinner-hour,--discards all toys,--abhors a holiday,--propounds questions of marvellous depth in politics or mineralogy,--and seems, in short, more fitted to enjoy the learned meeting at Newcastle, than the exhilarating exercises of the cricket-ground; but, if the axiom be true, that ""a little learning is a dangerous thing,"" it has also been proved by frequent, and sometimes by very melancholy experience, that, for minds not yet expanded to maturity, a great deal of learning is more dangerous still, and that in those school-rooms where there has been a society for the suppression of amusement, the mental energies have suffered, as well as the health.",formidable person meet society present mother promising boy year old be possible escape volume anecdote complete system education new principle young gentleman ask leave bring book breakfast room tear study dinner hour discard toy abhor holiday propound question marvellous depth politics mineralogy seem short fit enjoy learn meeting exhilarating exercise cricket ground axiom true little learning dangerous thing prove frequent melancholy experience mind expand maturity great deal learning dangerous school room be society suppression amusement mental energy suffer health 
8,"A prejudice has naturally arisen against giving works of fiction to children, because their chief interest too often rests on the detection and punishment of such mean vices as lying and stealing, which are so frequently and elaborately described, that the way to commit those crimes is made obvious, while a clever boy thinks he could easily avoid the oversights by which another has been discovered, and that if he does not yield to similar temptations, he is a model of virtue and good-conduct.",prejudice arise give work fiction child chief interest rest detection punishment such mean vice lie steal describe way commit crime make obvious clever boy think avoid oversight discover yield similar temptation model virtue good conduct 
9,"In writing for any class of readers, and especially in occupying the leisure moments of such peculiarly fortunate young persons as have leisure moments at all, the author feels conscious of a deep responsibility, for it is at their early age that the seed can best be sown which shall bear fruit unto eternal life, therefore it is hoped this volume may be found to inculcate a pleasing and permanent consciousness, that religion is the best resource in happier hours, and the only refuge in hours of affliction.",writing class reader occupy leisure moment such fortunate young person have leisure moment author feel conscious deep responsibility early age seed sow bear fruit eternal life hope volume find inculcate pleasing permanent consciousness religion good resource happy hour only refuge hour affliction 
10,"Those who wish to be remembered for ever in the world,--and it is a very common object of ambition,--will find no monument more permanent, than the affectionate remembrance of any children they have treated with kindness; for we may often observe, in the reminiscences of old age, a tender recollection surviving all others, of friends in early days who enlivened the hours of childhood by presents of playthings and comfits. But above all, we never forget those who good-humouredly complied with the constantly recurring petition of all young people in every generation, and in every house--""Will you tell me a story?""",wish remember world common object ambition find monument permanent affectionate remembrance child treat kindness observe reminiscence old age tender recollection survive other friend early day enliven hour childhood present plaything comfit forget good complie recur petition young person generation house tell story 
11,"In answer to such a request, often and importunately repeated, the author has from year to year delighted in seeing herself surrounded by a circle of joyous, eager faces, listening with awe to the terrors of Mrs. Crabtree, or smiling at the frolics of Harry and Laura. The stories, originally, were so short, that some friends, aware of their popularity, and conscious of their harmless tendency, took the trouble of copying them in manuscript for their own young friends; but the tales have since grown and expanded during frequent verbal repetitions, till, with various fanciful additions and new characters, they have enlarged into their present form, or rather so far beyond it, that several chapters are omitted, to keep the volume within moderate compass.",answer request repeat author have year year delight see surround circle joyous eager face listen awe terror smile frolic story short friend aware popularity conscious harmless tendency take trouble copy manuscript own young friend tale grow expand frequent verbal repetition various fanciful addition new character enlarge present form several chapter omit keep volume moderate compass 
12,"Paley remarks, that ""any amusement which is innocent, is better than none; as the writing of a book, the building of a house, the laying out of a garden, the digging of a fish-pond, even the raising of a cucumber;"" and it is hoped that, while the author herself has found much interesting occupation in recording these often repeated stories, the time of herself and her young readers may be employed with some degree of profit, or she will certainly regret that it was not better occupied in the rearing of cucumbers.",remark amusement innocent good writing book building house laying garden digging fish pond raising cucumber hope author find interesting occupation record repeat story time young reader employ degree profit regret occupy rearing cucumber
