1,CHAPTER 18.,
2,"The storm now raged furiously, the lightning was accompanied by loud peals of thunder, and the children awoke and cried with fright, till they were hushed to sleep again.  The wind howled as it pressed with all its violence against the tents, while the rain poured off in torrents. One moment the canvas of the tents would bulge in, and the cords which held it strain and crack; at another, an eddy of wind would force out the canvas, which would flap and flap, while the rain found many an entrance.  The tent in which Mrs Seagrave and the children reposed was on the outside of the others, and therefore the most exposed.  About midnight the wind burst on them with greater violence than before.  A loud crash was heard by Ready and Mr Seagrave, followed by the shrieks of Mrs Seagrave and Juno; the pegs of the tent had given way, and the inmates were exposed to the fury of the elements.  Ready rushed out, followed by Mr Seagrave and William.  So strong was the wind and beating rain, and such was the darkness, that it was with some difficulty that by their united efforts the women and children could be extricated.  Tommy was the first taken up by Ready: his courage had all gone, and he was bellowing furiously.  William took Albert in charge and carried him into the other tent, where Tommy sat in his wet shirt roaring most melodiously.  Juno, Mrs Seagrave, and the little girl were at last carried away and taken into the other tent: fortunately no one was hurt, although the frightened children could not be pacified, and joined in chorus with Tommy.  Nothing more could be done except to put the children into bed, and then the whole party sat up the remainder of the night listening to the noise of the wind, the roaring of the sea, and the loud patter of the rain against the canvas.  At dawn of day, Ready went out, and found that the gale had spent its force, and had already much abated; but it was not one of those bright glorious mornings to which they had been accustomed since their arrival at the island: the sky was still dark, and the clouds were chasing each other wildly; there was neither sun nor blue sky to be seen: it still rained, but only at intervals, and the earth was soft and spongy; the little cove, but the day before so beautiful, was now a mass of foaming and tumultuous waves, and the surf was thrown many yards upon the beach: the horizon was confused--you could not distinguish the line between the water and the sky, and the whole shore of the island was lined with a white foam.  Ready turned his eyes to where the ship had been fixed on the rocks: it was no longer there--the whole frame had disappeared; but the fragments of it, and the contents of the holds, were floating about in every direction, or tossing amongst the surf on the beach.",storm rage lightning accompany loud peal thunder child awoke cry fright hush sleep wind howl press violence tent rain pour torrent moment canvas tent bulge cord hold strain crack eddy wind force canvas flap flap rain find many entrance tent child repose outside other expose midnight wind burst great violence loud crash hear ready follow shriek peg tent give way inmate expose fury element ready rush follow strong wind beating rain such darkness difficulty united effort woman child extricate first take ready courage go bellow take charge carry other tent sit wet shirt roar little girl last carry take other tent hurt frighten child pacify join chorus more do put child bed whole party sit remainder night listen noise wind roaring sea loud patter rain canvas dawn day ready go find gale spend force abate bright glorious morning accustom arrival island sky dark cloud chase other be sun blue sky see rain interval earth soft spongy little cove day beautiful mass foaming tumultuous wave surf throw many yard beach horizon confused distinguish line water sky whole shore island line white foam ready turn eye ship fix rock whole frame disappear fragment content hold float direction toss surf beach 
3,"""I thought as much,"" said Ready, pointing to where the ship had lain, as he turned round and found that Mr Seagrave had followed him; ""look, sir, this gale has broken her up entirely.  This is a warning to us not to remain here any longer: we must make the most of the fine weather which we may have before the rainy season sets in.""",think much say ready point ship lain turn find follow look sir gale break warning remain make most fine weather have rainy season set 
4,"""I agree with you, Ready,"" replied Mr Seagrave,--""and there is another proof of it,"" pointing to the tent which had been blown down.  ""It was a mercy that none of them were hurt.""",agree ready reply be proof point tent blow mercy hurt 
5,"""Very true, sir; but the gale is breaking, and we shall have fine weather to-morrow.  Let us now see what we can do with the tent, while William and Juno try if they can get any breakfast.""",true sir gale break have fine weather let see do tent try get breakfast 
6,"They set to work.  Ready and Mr Seagrave made it fast with fresh cords and pegs, and very soon had it all ready; but the beds and bedding were wet through.  They hauled over the wet canvas, and then left it to go to their breakfast, to which Juno had summoned them.",set work ready make fresh cord peg have ready bed bedding wet haul wet canvas leave go breakfast summon 
7,"""We need do no more at present,"" said Ready, ""by night-time it will not be so wet, and we can handle it easier.  I see a break in the sky now which promises fine weather soon.  And now we had better work hard to-day, for we may save a great many things, which may be dashed to pieces on the rocks, if we do not haul them on the beach.""",need do more present say ready night time wet handle easy see break sky promise fine weather have good work hard day save great many thing dash piece rock haul beach
