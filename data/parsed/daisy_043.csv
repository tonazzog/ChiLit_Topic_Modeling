4," Hector and Tom finished their holidays by a morning’s shooting at the Grange, Dr. May promising to meet them, and let them drive him home.",finish holiday morning shooting promise meet let drive 
5,"Meta was out when he arrived; and, repairing to the library, he found Mr. Rivers sitting by a fire, though it was early in September, with the newspaper before him, but not reading. He looked depressed, and seemed much disappointed at having heard that George and Flora had accepted some further invitations in Scotland, and did not intend to return for another month. Dr. May spoke cheerfully of the hospitality and kindness they had met, but failed to enliven him, and, as if trying to assign some cause for his vexation, he lamented over fogs and frosts, and began to dread an October in Scotland for Flora, almost as if it were the Arctic regions.",arrive repair library find sit fire newspaper read look depressed seem disappointed hear accept further invitation intend return month speak hospitality kindness meet fail enlive try assign cause vexation lament fog frost begin dread arctic region 
6,"He grew somewhat more animated in praising Flora, and speaking of the great satisfaction he had in seeing his son married to so admirable a person. He only wished it could be the same with his daughter.",grow animated prais speak great satisfaction have see son marry admirable person wish same daughter 
7,"“You are a very unselfish father,” said Dr. May. “I cannot imagine you without your little fairy.”",unselfish father say imagine little fairy 
8,"“It would be hard to part,” said Mr. Rivers, sighing; “yet I should be relieved to see her in good hands, so pretty and engaging as she is, and something of an heiress. With our dear Flora, she is secure of a happy home when I am gone, but still I should be glad to have seen--” and he broke off thoughtfully.",hard part say sigh relieve see good hand engage heiress dear secure happy home gone glad see break 
9,"“She is so sensible, that we shall see her make a good choice,” said Dr. May, smiling; “that is, if she choose at all, for I do not know who is worthy of her.”",sensible see make good choice say smile choose know worthy 
10,"“I am quite indifferent as to fortune,” continued Mr. Rivers. “She will have enough of her own.”",indifferent fortune continue have enough own 
11,"“Enough not to be dependent, which is the point,” said Dr. May, “though I should have few fears for her any way.”",enough dependent point say have few fear way 
12,"“It would be a comfort,” harped on Mr. Rivers, dwelling on the subject, as if he wanted to say something, “if she were only safe with a man who knew how to value her and make her happy. Such a young man as your Norman, now--I have often thought--”",comfort harp dwelling subject want say safe man know value make happy young man think 
13,"Dr. May would not seem to hear, but he could not prevent himself from blushing as crimson as if he had been the very Norman, as he answered, going on with his own speech, as if Mr. Rivers’s had been unmade, “She is the brightest little creature under the sun, and the sparkle is down so deep within, that however it may turn out, I should never fear for her happiness.”",seem hear prevent blush crimson very answer go own speech unmade brightest little creature sun sparkle deep turn fear happiness 
14,"“Flora is my great reliance,” proceeded Mr. Rivers. “Her aunt, Lady Leonora, is very kind, but somehow she does not seem to suit with Meta.”",great reliance proceed aunt kind seem suit 
15,"“Oh, ho,” thought the doctor, “have you made that discovery, my good friend?”",think doctor make discovery good friend 
16,"The voices of the two boys were heard in the hall, explaining their achievements to Meta, and Dr. May took his departure, Hector driving him, and embarking in a long discourse on his own affairs as if he had quite forgotten that the doctor was not his father, and going on emphatically, in spite of the absence of mind now and then betrayed by his auditor, who, at Dr. Spencer’s door, exclaimed, “Stop, Hector, let me out here--thank you;” and presently brought out his friend into the garden, and sat down on the grass, talking low and earnestly over the disease with which Mr. Rivers had been so long affected; for though Dr. May could not perceive any positively unfavourable symptom, he had been rendered vaguely uneasy by the unusual heaviness and depression of manner. So long did they sit conversing, that Blanche was sent out, primed with an impertinent message, that two such old doctors ought to be ashamed of themselves for sitting so late in the dew.",voice boy hear hall explain achievement take departure drive embark long discourse own affair forget doctor father go spite absence mind betray auditor door exclaim stop let thank bring friend garden sit grass talk low disease affect perceive unfavourable symptom render uneasy unusual heaviness depression manner sit convers send prime impertinent message such old doctor ashamed sit dew

18,"“There!” said Dr. May, looking at Dr. Spencer, as if to say, I told you so, in the first triumph of professional sagacity; but the next moment exclaiming, “Poor little Meta!” he hurried away.",say look say tell first triumph professional sagacity next moment exclaim poor little meta hurry 
19,"A gloom fell on those who remained, for, besides their sympathy for Meta, and their liking for her kind old father, there was that one unacknowledged heartache, which, though in general bravely combated, lay in wait always ready to prey on them. Hector stole round to sit by Margaret, and Dr. Spencer muttered, “This will never do,” and sent Tom to fetch some papers lying on his table, whence he read them some curious accounts that he had just received from his missionary friends in India.",gloom fall remain sympathy like kind old father be unacknowledged heartache general combate lay wait ready prey steal sit mutter do send fetch paper lie table read curious account receive missionary friend 
20,"They were interested, but in a listening mood, that caused a universal start when the bell again sounded. This time, James reported that the servant from the Grange said his master was very ill--he had brought a letter to post for Mr. George Rivers, and here was a note for Miss Ethel. It was the only note Ethel had ever received from her father, and contained these few words:",interested listening mood cause universal start bell sound time report servant say master ill bring letter post note only note receive father contain few word

23," Ethel put her hands to her forehead. It was as if she had been again plunged into the stunned dream of misery of four years ago, and her sensation was of equal bewilderment and uselessness; but it was but for a moment--the next she was in a state of over-bustle and eagerness. She wanted to fly about and hasten to help Meta, and could hardly obey the word and gesture by which Margaret summoned her to her side.",put hand forehead plunge stunn dream misery year sensation equal bewilderment uselessness moment next state bustle eagerness want fly hast help obey word gesture summon side

27,"Mary and Miss Bracy prepared Ethel’s own goods, which she would otherwise have forgotten; and Margaret, meanwhile, detained her by her side, trying to calm and encourage her with gentle words of counsel, that might hinder her from giving way to the flurry of emotion that had seized her, and prevent her from thinking herself certain to be useless.",prepare own goods forget detain side try calm encourage gentle word counsel hinder give way flurry emotion seize prevent think certain useless 
28,"Adams was to drive her thither in the gig, and it presently came to the door. Dr. Spencer wrapped her up well in cloaks and shawls, and spoke words of kindly cheer in her ear as she set off. The fresh night air blew pleasantly on her, the stars glimmered in full glory overhead, and now and then her eye was caught by the rocket-like track of a shooting-star. Orion was rising slowly far in the east, and bringing to her mind the sailor-boy under the southern sky; if, indeed, he were not where sun and stars no more are the light. It was strange that the thought came more as soothing than as acute pain; she could bear to think of him thus in her present frame, as long as she had not to talk of him. Under those solemn stars, the life everlasting seemed to overpower the sense of this mortal life, and Ethel’s agitation was calmed away.",drive gig come door wrap cloak shawl speak word kindly cheer ear set fresh night air blow star glimmer full glory eye catch rocket like track shooting star rise east bring mind sailor boy southern sky sun star more light strange thought come soothing acute pain bear think present frame have talk solemn star life everlasting seem overpower sense mortal life agitation calm 
29,"The old cedar-tree stood up in stately blackness against the sky, and the lights in the house glanced behind it. The servants looked rather surprised to see Ethel, as if she were not expected, and conducted her to the great drawing-room, which looked the more desolate and solitary, from the glare of lamplight, falling on the empty seats which Ethel had lately seen filled with a glad home party. She was looking round, thinking whether to venture up to Meta’s room, and there summon Bellairs, when Meta came gliding in, and threw her arms round her. Ethel could not speak, but Meta’s voice was more cheerful than she had expected. “How kind of you, dear Ethel!”",old cedar tree stand stately blackness sky light house glance servant look surprised see expect conduct great draw room look desolate solitary glare lamplight fall empty seat see fill glad home party look think venture room summon come glide throw arm speak voice cheerful expect kind dear

34,“Is papa with him?”,papa 
35,“Yes.”,
36,"Meta wound her arms round Ethel, and led her up to her sitting-room, where a book lay on the table. She said that her father had seemed weary and torpid, and had sat still until almost their late dinner-hour, when he seemed to bethink himself of dressing, and had risen. She thought he walked weakly, and rather tottering, and had run to make him lean on her, which he did, as far as his own room door. There he had kissed her, and thanked her, and murmured a word like blessing. She had not, however, been alarmed, until his servant had come to tell her that he had another seizure.",meta wind arm lead sitting room book lay table say father seem weary torpid sit late dinner hour seem bethink dress rise think walk totter run make lean own room door kiss thank murmure word blessing alarm servant come tell have seizure 
37,"Ethel asked whether she had seen Dr. May since he had been with her father. She had; but Ethel was surprised to find that she had not taken in the extent of his fears. She had become so far accustomed to these attacks, that, though anxious and distressed, she did not apprehend more than a few days’ weakness, and her chief longing was to be of use. She was speaking cheerfully of beginning her nursing to-morrow, and of her great desire that her papa would allow her to sit up with him, when there was a slow, reluctant movement of the lock of the door, and the two girls sprang to their feet, as Dr. May opened it; and Ethel read his countenance at once.",ask see father have surprise find take extent fear become accustom attack anxious distressed apprehend more few day weakness chief longing use speak begin nursing great desire papa allow sit be slow reluctant movement lock door girl spring foot open read countenance 
38,Not so Meta. “How is he? May I go to him?” cried she.,go cry 
39,"“Not now, my dear,” said Dr. May, putting his hand on her shoulder, in a gentle, detaining manner, that sent a thrill of trembling through her frame, though she did not otherwise move. She only clasped her hands together, and looked up into his face. He answered the look. “Yes, my dear, the struggle is over.”",dear say put hand shoulder gentle detain manner send thrill tremble frame move clasp hand look face answer look dear struggle

42,"Meta tried to speak, but could not bring out the words, and, with an imploring look at Ethel, as if to beg her to make them clear for her, she inarticulately murmured, “Oh! why did you not call me?”",try speak bring word implor look beg make clear murmure call 
43,“I could not. He would not let me. His last conscious word to me was not to let you see him suffer.”,let last conscious word let see suffer 
44,"Meta wrung her clasped hands together in mute anguish. Dr. May signed to Ethel to guide her back to the sofa, but the movement seemed so far to rouse her, that she said, “I should like to go to bed.”",meta wrung clasp hand mute anguish sign guide sofa movement seem rouse say like go bed

46,"He did not even shake hands with Meta, nor wish her good-night, as she disappeared into her own room.",shake hand wish good night disappear own room 
47,"Bellairs undressed her, and Ethel stood watching, till the young head, under the load of sorrow, so new to it, was laid on the pillow. Bellairs asked her if she would have a light.",undress stand watch young head load sorrow new lay pillow ask have light 
48,"“No, no, thank you--the dark and alone. Good-night,” said Meta. Ethel went back to the sitting-room, where her father was standing at the window, looking out into the night. He turned as she came in, folded her in his arms, and kissed her forehead. “And how is the poor little dear?”  he asked.",thank dark alone good night say go sitting room father stand window look night turn come fold arm kiss forehead poor little dear ask

65,“If only I were anybody else!”,else 
66,"Dr. May again threw his arm round her, and looked into her face. He felt that he had rather have her, such as she was, than anybody else; and, together, they sat down, and talked of what was to be done, and what was best for Meta, and of the solemnity of being in the house of death. Ethel felt and showed it so much, in her subdued, awe-struck manner, that her father felt checked whenever he was about to return to his ordinary manner, familiarised, as he necessarily was, with the like scenes. It drew him back to the thought of their own trouble, and their conversation recurred to those days, so that each gained a more full understanding of the other, and they at length separated, certainly with the more peaceful and soft feelings for being in the abode of mourning.",throw arm look face feel have such else sit talk do good solemnity house death feel show much subdued awe strike manner father feel check about return ordinary manner familiarise like scene draw thought own trouble conversation recurr day gain full understanding other length separate peaceful soft feeling abode mourn 
67,"Bellairs promised to call Ethel, to be with her young lady as early as might be, reporting that she was sound asleep. And sleep continued to shield her till past her usual hour, so that Ethel was up, and had been with Dr. May, before she was summoned to her, and then she found her half dressed, and hastening that she might not make Dr. May late for breakfast, and in going to his patients. There was an elasticity in the happily constituted young mind that could not be entirely struck down, nor deprived of power of taking thought for others. Yet her eyes looked wandering, and unlike themselves, and her words, now and then, faltered, as if she was not sure what she was doing or saying. Ethel told her not to mind--Dr. Spencer would take care of the patients; but she did not seem to recollect, at first, who Dr. Spencer was, nor to care for being reminded.",promise call young lady report sound asleep sleep continue shield usual hour summon find half dress hasten make breakfast go patient be elasticity constitute young mind strike deprive power take thought other eye look wonder word falter sure do say tell mind take care patient seem recollect first care remind 
68,"Breakfast was laid out in the little sitting-room. Ethel wanted to take the trouble off her hands, but she would not let her. She sat behind her urn, and asked about tea or coffee, quite accurately, in a low, subdued voice, that nearly overcame Dr. May. When the meal was over, and she had rung the bell, and risen up, as if to her daily work, she turned round, with that piteous, perplexed air, and stood for a moment, as if confused.",breakfast lay little sitting room want take trouble hand let sit urn ask tea coffee low subdued voice overcame meal rung bell rise daily work turn piteous perplex air stand moment confuse

74,"Dr. May drew her down to sit on the sofa beside him, and, in his soft, sweet voice, told her all that she wished to learn of her father’s last hours, and was glad to see showers of quiet, wholesome tears drop freely down, but without violence, and she scarcely attempted to speak. There was a pause at the end, and then she said gently, “Thank you, for it all. Dear papa!” And she rose up, and went back to her room.",draw sit sofa soft sweet voice tell wish learn father last hour glad see shower quiet wholesome tear drop violence attempt speak be pause end say thank dear papa rise go room

79,“I think not. She knows the way to the only Comforter. I am not afraid of her after those blessed tears.”,think know way only afraid bless tear 
80,"Dr. May was right; Meta presently returned to them, in the same gentle subdued sadness, enfolding her, indeed, as a flower weighed down by mist, but not crushing nor taking away her powers. It was as if she were truly upheld; and thankful to her friends as she was, she did not throw herself on them in utter dependence or self-abandonment.",right return same gentle subdued sadness enfold flower weigh mist crush take power upheld thankful friend throw utter dependence self abandonment 
81,"She wrote needful letters, shedding many tears over them, and often obliged to leave off to give the blinding weeping its course, but refusing to impose any unnecessary task upon Dr. May’s lame arm. All that was right, she strove to do; she saw Mr. Charles Wilmot, and was refreshed by his reading to her; and when Dr. May desired it, she submissively put on her bonnet, and took several turns with Ethel in the shrubbery, though it made her cry heartily to look into the downstairs rooms. And she lay on the sofa at last, owning herself strangely tired, she did not know why, and glad that Ethel should read to her. By and by, she went to dress for the evening, and came back, full of the tidings that one of the children in the village had been badly burned. It occupied her very much--she made Ethel promise to go and see about her to-morrow, and sent Bellairs at once with every comfort that she could devise.",write needful letter shed many tear oblige leave give blinding weep course refuse impose unnecessary task lame arm right strive do see refresh reading desire put bonnet take several turn shrubbery make cry look downstairs room lay sofa last own tired know glad read go dress evening come full tiding child village burn occupy make promise go see send comfort devise 
82,"On the whole, those two days were to Ethel a peaceful and comfortable time. She saw more than usual of her father, and had such conversations with him as were seldom practicable at home, and that chimed in with the unavowed care which hung on their minds; while Meta was a most sweet and loving charge, without being a burden, and often saying such beautiful things in her affectionate resignation, that Ethel could only admire and lay them up in her mind. Dr. May went backwards and forwards, and brought good accounts of Margaret and fond messages; he slept at the Grange each night, and Meta used to sit in the corner of the sofa and work, or not, as best suited her, while she listened to his talk with Ethel, and now and then herself joined.",whole day peaceful comfortable time see more usual father have such conversation practicable home chime unavowed care hang mind sweet loving charge burden say such beautiful thing affectionate resignation admire lay mind go forward bring good account fond message sleep night use sit corner sofa work good suit listen talk join 
83,"George Rivers’s absence was a serious inconvenience in all arrangements; but his sister dreaded his grief as much as she wished for his return; and often were the posts and the journeys reckoned over, without a satisfactory conclusion, as to when he could arrive from so remote a part of Scotland.",absence serious inconvenience arrangement sister dread grief wish return post journey reckon satisfactory conclusion arrive remote part 
84,"At last, as the two girls had finished their early dinner, the butler brought in word that Mr. Norman May was there. Meta at once begged that he would come in, and Ethel went into the hall to meet him. He looked very wan, with the dark rings round his eyes a deeper purple than ever, and he could hardly find utterance to ask, “How is she?”",last girl finish early dinner butler bring word begg come go hall meet look wan dark ring eye deep purple find utterance ask 
85,"“As good and sweet as she can be,” said Ethel warmly; but no more, for Meta herself had come to the dining-room door, and was holding out her hand. Norman took it in both his, but could not speak; Meta’s own soft voice was the first. “I thought you would come--he was so fond of you.”",good sweet say more come dining room door hold hand take speak own soft voice first think come fond 
86,"Poor Norman quite gave way, and Meta was the one to speak gentle words of soothing. “There is so much to be thankful for,” she said. “He has been spared so much of the suffering Dr. May feared for him; and he was so happy about George.”",poor give way one speak gentle word soothing be much thankful say spare much suffering fear happy 
87,"Norman made a great effort to recover himself. Ethel asked for Flora and George. It appeared that they had been on an excursion when the first letter arrived at Glenbracken, and thus had received both together in the evening, on their return. George had been greatly overcome, and they had wished to set off instantly; but Lady Glenbracken would not hear of Flora’s travelling night and day, and it had at length been arranged that Norman Ogilvie should drive Norman across the country that evening, to catch the mail for Edinburgh, and he had been on the road ever since. George was following with his wife more slowly, and would be at home to-morrow evening. Meantime, he sent full authority to his father-in-law to make arrangements.",make great effort recover ask appear excursion first letter arrive receive evening return overcome wish set hear travelling night day length arrange drive country evening catch mail road follow wife home evening send full authority father law make arrangement 
88,"Ethel went to see the burned child, leaving Meta to take her walk in the garden under Norman’s charge. He waited on her with a sort of distant reverence for a form of grief, so unlike what he had dreaded for her, when the first shock of the tidings had brought back to him the shattered bewildered feelings to which he dared not recur.",go see burn child leave take walk garden charge wait sort distant reverence form grief dread first shock tiding bring shattered bewilder feeling recur 
89,"To dwell on the details was, to her, a comfort, knowing his sympathy and the affection there had been between him and her father; nor had they parted in such absolute brightness, as to make them unprepared for such a meeting as the present. The cloud of suspense was brooding lower and lower over the May family, and the need of faith and submission was as great with them as with the young orphan herself. Norman said little, but that little was so deep and fervent, that after a time Meta could not help saying, when Ethel was seen in the distance, and their talk was nearly over, “Oh, Norman, these things are no mirage!”",dwell detail comfort know sympathy affection father part such absolute brightness make unprepared meeting present cloud suspense brood low low family need faith submission great young orphan say little little deep fervent time help say see distance talk thing mirage 
90,"“It is the world that is the mirage,” he answered. Ethel came up, and Dr. May also, in good time for the post. He was obliged to become very busy, using Norman for his secretary, till he saw his son’s eyes so heavy, that he remembered the two nights that he had been up, and ordered him to go home and go to bed as soon as tea was over.",world mirage answer come good time post oblige become busy use secretary see son eye heavy remember night order go go bed tea

93,"Meta had already expressed her belief that her father would be buried at the suburban church, where lay her mother; and Dr. May, having been desired to seek out the will and open it, found it was so; and fixed the day and hour with Meta, who was as submissive and reasonable as possible, though much grieved that he thought she could not be present.",express belief father bury suburban church lay mother desire seek will open find fix day hour submissive reasonable possible grieve think present

99,"“Has he, indeed?--how very kind, how much Norman will value it.”",kind much value

Ethel blushed and smiled, and looked so much touched and delighted, that he grew alarmed and said, “You know, Ethel, this must be as if it never had been mentioned.”",remarkable say help tell say wish regard daughter blush smile look touch delighted grow alarm say know mention

Their sisters went out to meet them, and George folded Meta in his arms, and kissing her again and again, called her his poor dear little sister, and wept bitterly, and even violently. Flora stood beside Ethel, and said, in a low voice, that poor George felt it dreadfully; and then came forward, touched him gently, and told him that he must not overset Meta; and, drawing her from him, kissed her, and said what a grievous time this had been for her, and how sorry they had been to leave her so long, but they knew she was in the best hands.",next evening carriage drive door appear hall sister go meet fold arm kiss call poor dear little sister goot stand say low voice poor feel come touch tell overset draw kiss say grievous time sorry leave know good hand

Poor George was by far the most struck down of all the mourners, and his whole demeanour gave his new relations a much warmer feeling towards him than they could ever have hoped to entertain. His gentle refined father had softly impressed his duller nature; and his want of attention and many extravagances came back upon him acutely now, in his changed home. He could hardly bear to look at his little orphan sister, and lavished every mark of fondness upon her; nor could he endure to sit at the bottom of his table; but when they had gone in to dinner, he turned away from the chair and hid his face. He was almost like a child in his want of self-restraint; and with all Dr. May’s kind soothing manner, he could not bring him to attend to any of the necessary questions as to arrangements, and was obliged to refer to Flora, whose composed good sense was never at fault.",seem feel reply caresse turn brother poor strike mourner whole demeanour give new relation warm feeling hope entertain gentle refined father impress duller nature want attention many extravagance come change home bear look little orphan sister lavish mark fondness endure sit bottom table go dinner turn chair hide face child want self restraint kind soothing manner bring attend necessary question arrangement oblige refer compose good sense fault

128,"So, while Dr. May, with George, Norman, and Tom, went to London, she remained, though not exactly knowing what good she was doing, unless by making the numbers rather less scanty; but both sisters declared her to be the greatest comfort possible; and when Meta shut herself up in her own room, where she had long learned to seek strength in still communing with her own heart, Flora seemed to find it a relief to call her sister to hers, and talk over ordinary subjects, in a tone that struck on Ethel’s ear as a little incongruous--but then Flora had not been here from the first, and the impression could not be as strong. She was very kind, and her manner, when with others, was perfect, from its complete absence of affectation; but, alone with Ethel, there was a little complacency sometimes betrayed, and some curiosity whether her father had read the will. Ethel allowed what she had heard of the contents to be extracted from her, and it certainly did not diminish Flora’s secret satisfaction in being ‘somebody’.",go remain know good do make number scanty sister declare great comfort possible shut own room learn seek strength commun own heart seem find relief call sister talk ordinary subject tone strike ear little incongruous first impression strong kind manner other perfect complete absence affectation be little complacency betray curiosity father read will allow hear content extract diminish secret satisfaction
