1,CHAPTER 17. Narrative Continued by the Doctor: The Jolly-boat's Last Trip,narrative continue boat last trip 
2,"THIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others. In the first place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded. Five grown men, and three of them--Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain--over six feet high, was already more than she was meant to carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale was lipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards.",fifth trip different other first place little gallipot boat overload grow man captain foot high more mean carry add powder pork bread bag gunwale lip several time ship little water breeche tail coat soak wet go yard 
3,"The captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more evenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.",captain make trim boat get lie little same afraid breathe 
4,"In the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong rippling current running westward through the basin, and then south'ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point. If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.",second place ebb make strong ripple current run basin south'ard seaward strait enter morning ripple danger overload craft bad sweep true course proper landing place point let current have way come gig pirate appear moment 
5,"""I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,"" said I to the captain. I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars. ""The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?""",keep head stockade sir say captain steering fresh man oar tide keep wash pull little strong 
6,"""Not without swamping the boat,"" said he. ""You must bear up, sir, if you please--bear up until you see you're gaining.""",swamp boat say bear sir bear see gain 
7,"I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the way we ought to go.",try find experiment tide keep sweep lay head due right angle way go 
8,"""We'll never get ashore at this rate,"" said I.",get rate say 
9,"""If it's the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,"" returned the captain. ""We must keep upstream. You see, sir,"" he went on, ""if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it's hard to say where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can dodge back along the shore.""",only course lie sir lie return captain keep see sir go drop leeward landing place hard say get chance board gig way go current slack dodge shore 
10,"""The current's less a'ready, sir,"" said the man Gray, who was sitting in the fore-sheets; ""you can ease her off a bit.""",current a'ready sir say man sit fore sheet ease bit 
11,"""Thank you, my man,"" said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.",thank man say happen make mind treat 
12,"Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a little changed.",captain speak think voice little change 
13,"""The gun!"" said he.",gun say 
14,"""I have thought of that,"" said I, for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort. ""They could never get the gun ashore, and if they did, they could never haul it through the woods.""",think say make sure think bombardment fort get gun haul wood 
15,"""Look astern, doctor,"" replied the captain.",look astern doctor reply captain 
16,"We had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were the five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. Not only that, but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad.",forget long horror rogue busy get jacket call stout tarpaulin cover sail flash mind same moment round shot powder gun leave stroke axe put possession evil one 
17,"""Israel was Flint's gunner,"" said Gray hoarsely.",gunner say 
18,"At any risk, we put the boat's head direct for the landing-place. By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could keep her steady for the goal. But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door.",risk put boat head direct landing place time get run current keep steerage way gentle rate rowing keep steady goal bad course hold turn broadside stern offer target barn door 
19,I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck.,hear see brandy face rascal hand plump round shoot deck 
20,"""Who's the best shot?"" asked the captain.",good shot ask captain 
21,"""Mr. Trelawney, out and away,"" said I.",say 
22,"""Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir? Hands, if possible,"" said the captain.",pick man sir hand possible say captain 
23,Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun.,cool steel look priming gun 
24,"""Now,"" cried the captain, ""easy with that gun, sir, or you'll swamp the boat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.""",cry captain easy gun sir swamp boat hand stand trim aim 
25,"The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop.",squire raise gun rowing cease learn other side keep balance contrived ship drop 
26,"They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands, who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most exposed. However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he stooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four who fell.",have gun time slew swivel hand muzzle rammer consequence expose have luck fire stoop ball whistle other fall 
27,"The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats.",cry give echoe companion board great number voice shore look direction see other pirate troop tree tumble place boat 
28,"""Here come the gigs, sir,"" said I.",come gig sir say 
29,"""Give way, then,"" cried the captain. ""We mustn't mind if we swamp her now. If we can't get ashore, all's up.""",give way cry captain mind swamp get 
30,"""Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir,"" I added; ""the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off.""",gig manned sir add crew other likely go shore cut 
31,"""They'll have a hot run, sir,"" returned the captain. ""Jack ashore, you know. It's not them I mind; it's the round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady's maid couldn't miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we'll hold water.""",have hot run sir return captain know mind round shot carpet bowl lady maid miss tell squire see match hold water 
32,"In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process. We were now close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees. The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes. The ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed us, was now making reparation and delaying our assailants. The one source of danger was the gun.",meanwhile make headway good pace boat overload ship little water process close stroke beach ebb disclose narrow belt sand clustering tree gig fear little point conceal eye ebb-tide delay make reparation delay assailant source danger gun 
33,"""If I durst,"" said the captain, ""I'd stop and pick off another man.""",durst say captain stop pick man 
34,"But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot. They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not dead, and I could see him trying to crawl away.",plain mean delay shot much look fall comrade dead see try crawl 
35,"""Ready!"" cried the squire.",ready cry squire 
36,"""Hold!"" cried the captain, quick as an echo.",hold cry captain quick echo 
37,"And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water. The report fell in at the same instant of time. This was the first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire's shot not having reached him. Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster.",back great heave send stern bodily water report fall same instant time first hear sound squire shot reach ball pass know fancy head wind contribute disaster 
38,"At any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of water, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet. The other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and bubbling.",rate boat sink stern foot water leave captain face other foot other take complete header come drench bubble 
39,"So far there was no great harm. No lives were lost, and we could wade ashore in safety. But there were all our stores at the bottom, and to make things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for service. Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by a sort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost. The other three had gone down with the boat.",be great harm life lose wake safety be store bottom make thing bad gun remain state service snatch knee hold head sort instinct captain carry shoulder bandoleer wise man lock uppermost other go boat 
40,"To add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether, if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm. Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce was a doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush one's clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war.",add concern hear voice draw wood shore have danger cut stockade half crippled state fear attack have sense conduct stand firm steady know doubtful case pleasant polite man valet brush clothes fit man war 
41,"With all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and provisions.",mind wade leave poor jolly boat good half powder provision
