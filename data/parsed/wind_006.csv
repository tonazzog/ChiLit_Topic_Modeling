1,CHAPTER VI. OUT IN THE STORM,
2," THE hand felt its way up his arm, and, grasping it gently and strongly above the elbow, lifted Diamond from the bed. The moment he was through the hole in the roof, all the winds of heaven seemed to lay hold upon him, and buffet him hither and thither. His hair blew one way, his night-gown another, his legs threatened to float from under him, and his head to grow dizzy with the swiftness of the invisible assailant. Cowering, he clung with the other hand to the huge hand which held his arm, and fear invaded his heart.",hand feel way arm grasp elbow lift bed moment hole roof wind heaven seem lay hold buffet hair blow way night gown leg threaten float head grow dizzy swiftness invisible assailant cower cling other hand huge hand hold arm fear invade heart 
3,"“Oh, North Wind!” he murmured, but the words vanished from his lips as he had seen the soap-bubbles that burst too soon vanish from the mouth of his pipe. The wind caught them, and they were nowhere. They couldn’t get out at all, but were torn away and strangled. And yet North Wind heard them, and in her answer it seemed to Diamond that just because she was so big and could not help it, and just because her ear and her mouth must seem to him so dreadfully far away, she spoke to him more tenderly and graciously than ever before. Her voice was like the bass of a deep organ, without the groan in it; like the most delicate of violin tones without the wail in it; like the most glorious of trumpet-ejaculations without the defiance in it; like the sound of falling water without the clatter and clash in it: it was like all of them and neither of them--all of them without their faults, each of them without its peculiarity: after all, it was more like his mother’s voice than anything else in the world.",murmure word vanish lip see soap bubble burst vanish mouth pipe wind catch get tear strangle hear answer seem big help ear mouth seem speak voice bass deep organ groan delicate violin tone wail glorious trumpet ejaculation defiance sound fall water clatter clash fault peculiarity mother voice else world

8,"“Yes, it does, my dear. That is what it was sent for.”",dear send 
9,"At the same moment, a peal of thunder which shook Diamond’s heart against the sides of his bosom hurtled out of the heavens: I cannot say out of the sky, for there was no sky. Diamond had not seen the lightning, for he had been intent on finding the face of North Wind. Every moment the folds of her garment would sweep across his eyes and blind him, but between, he could just persuade himself that he saw great glories of woman’s eyes looking down through rifts in the mountainous clouds over his head.",same moment peal thunder shake heart side bosom hurtle heaven say sky be sky see lightning intent find face moment fold garment sweep eye blind persuade see great glory woman eye look rift mountainous cloud head 
10,"He trembled so at the thunder, that his knees failed him, and he sunk down at North Wind’s feet, and clasped her round the column of her ankle. She instantly stooped, lifted him from the roof--up--up into her bosom, and held him there, saying, as if to an inconsolable child--",tremble thunder knee fail sink foot clasp column ankle stoop lift roof bosom hold say inconsolable child 
11,"“Diamond, dear, this will never do.”",dear do 
12,"“Oh yes, it will,” answered Diamond. “I am all right now--quite comfortable, I assure you, dear North Wind. If you will only let me stay here, I shall be all right indeed.”",answer comfortable assure dear let stay right

17,“But hadn’t you better get into my hair? Then you would not feel the wind; you will here.”,get hair feel wind 
18,"“Ah, but, dear North Wind, you don’t know how nice it is to feel your arms about me. It is a thousand times better to have them and the wind together, than to have only your hair and the back of your neck and no wind at all.”",dear know nice feel arm time good have wind have hair back neck wind 
19,“But it is surely more comfortable there?”,comfortable

21,"“Yes, indeed there are. Well, I will keep you in front of me. You will feel the wind, but not too much. I shall only want one arm to take care of you; the other will be quite enough to sink the ship.”",be keep front feel wind much want arm take care other enough sink ship

70,"Diamond clung to her tighter than ever, crying--",cling tight cry 
71,"“No, no, dear North Wind; I can’t believe that. I don’t believe it. I won’t believe it. That would kill me. I love you, and you must love me, else how did I come to love you? How could you know how to put on such a beautiful face if you did not love me and the rest? No. You may sink as many ships as you like, and I won’t say another word. I can’t say I shall like to see it, you know.”",dear believe believe believe kill love love come love know put beautiful face love rest sink many ship like say word say like see know 
72,"“That’s quite another thing,” said North Wind; and as she spoke she gave one spring from the roof of the hay-loft, and rushed up into the clouds, with Diamond on her left arm close to her heart. And as if the clouds knew she had come, they burst into a fresh jubilation of thunderous light. For a few moments, Diamond seemed to be borne up through the depths of an ocean of dazzling flame; the next, the winds were writhing around him like a storm of serpents. For they were in the midst of the clouds and mists, and they of course took the shapes of the wind, eddying and wreathing and whirling and shooting and dashing about like grey and black water, so that it was as if the wind itself had taken shape, and he saw the grey and black wind tossing and raving most madly all about him. Now it blinded him by smiting him upon the eyes; now it deafened him by bellowing in his ears; for even when the thunder came he knew now that it was the billows of the great ocean of the air dashing against each other in their haste to fill the hollow scooped out by the lightning; now it took his breath quite away by sucking it from his body with the speed of its rush. But he did not mind it. He only gasped first and then laughed, for the arm of North Wind was about him, and he was leaning against her bosom. It is quite impossible for me to describe what he saw. Did you ever watch a great wave shoot into a winding passage amongst rocks? If you ever did, you would see that the water rushed every way at once, some of it even turning back and opposing the rest; greater confusion you might see nowhere except in a crowd of frightened people. Well, the wind was like that, except that it went much faster, and therefore was much wilder, and twisted and shot and curled and dodged and clashed and raved ten times more madly than anything else in creation except human passions. Diamond saw the threads of the lady’s hair streaking it all. In parts indeed he could not tell which was hair and which was black storm and vapour. It seemed sometimes that all the great billows of mist-muddy wind were woven out of the crossing lines of North Wind’s infinite hair, sweeping in endless intertwistings. And Diamond felt as the wind seized on his hair, which his mother kept rather long, as if he too was a part of the storm, and some of its life went out from him. But so sheltered was he by North Wind’s arm and bosom that only at times, in the fiercer onslaught of some curl-billowed eddy, did he recognise for a moment how wild was the storm in which he was carried, nestling in its very core and formative centre.",thing say speak give spring roof hay loft rush cloud left arm heart cloud know come burst fresh jubilation thunderous light few moment seem borne depth ocean dazzle flame next wind writhe storm serpent midst cloud mist course take shape wind eddy wreath whirl shoot dash grey black water wind take shape see grey black wind toss rave blind smite eye deafen bellow ear thunder come know billow great ocean air dash other haste fill hollow scoop lightning take breath suck body speed rush mind gasp laugh arm lean bosom impossible describe see watch great wave shoot wind passage rock do see water rush way turn oppose rest great confusion see crowd frighten person wind go fast wild twist shoot curl dodg clash rave time else creation human passion see thread lady hair streak part tell hair black storm vapour seem great billow mist muddy wind wove crossing line infinite hair sweep endless intertwisting feel wind seize hair mother keep part storm life go shelter arm bosom time fiercer onslaught curl billow eddy recognise moment wild storm carry nestle very core formative centre 
73,"It seemed to Diamond likewise that they were motionless in this centre, and that all the confusion and fighting went on around them. Flash after flash illuminated the fierce chaos, revealing in varied yellow and blue and grey and dusky red the vapourous contention; peal after peal of thunder tore the infinite waste; but it seemed to Diamond that North Wind and he were motionless, all but the hair. It was not so. They were sweeping with the speed of the wind itself towards the sea.",seem motionless centre confusion fighting go flash flash illuminate fierce chaos reveal varied yellow blue grey dusky red vapourous contention peal peal thunder tore infinite waste seem motionless hair sweep speed wind sea
