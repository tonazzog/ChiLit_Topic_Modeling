1,CHAPTER 11.,
2,"Mr Seagrave was the first who awoke and rose from his bed on the ensuing morning.  He stepped out of the tent, and looked around him. The sky was clear and brilliant.  A light breeze ruffled o'er the surface of the water, and the tiny waves rippled one after another upon the white sand of the cove.  To the left of the cove the land rose, forming small hills, behind which appeared the continuation of the cocoa-nut groves.  To the right, a low ridge of coral rocks rose almost as a wall from the sea, and joined the herbage and brushwood at about a hundred paces, while the wreck of the Pacific, lying like some huge stranded monster, formed the prominent feature in the landscape.  The sun was powerful where its beams could penetrate; but where Mr Seagrave stood, the cocoa-nuts waved their feathery leaves to the wind, and offered an impervious shade.  A feeling of the extreme beauty of the scene, subdued by the melancholy created by the sight of the wrecked vessel, pervaded the mind of Mr Seagrave as he meditated over it.",first awoke rise bed ensuing morning step tent look sky clear brilliant light breeze ruffle surface water tiny wave ripple white sand cove left cove land rise form small hill appear continuation cocoa nut grove right low ridge coral rock rise wall sea join herbage brushwood pace wreck lie huge strand monster form prominent feature landscape sun powerful beam penetrate stand cocoa nut wave feathery leave wind offer impervious shade feeling extreme beauty scene subdued melancholy create sight wreck vessel pervade mind meditate 
3,"""Yes,"" thought he, ""if, tired with the world and its anxieties, I had sought an abode of peace and beauty, it would have been on a spot like this.  How lovely is the scene!--what calm--what content--what a sweet sadness does it create!  How mercifully have we been preserved when all hope appeared to be gone; and how bountifully have we been provided for, now that we have been saved,--and yet I have dared to repine, when I ought to be full of gratitude!  May God forgive me!  Wife, children, all safe, nothing to regret but a few worldly goods and a seclusion from the world for a time--yes, but for how long a time--What! rebellious still!--for the time that it shall please God in his wisdom to ordain."" Mr Seagrave turned back to his tent.  William, Tommy, and old Ready still remained fast asleep.  ""Excellent old man!"" thought Mr Seagrave. ""What a heart of oak is hid under that rugged bark!--Had it not been for his devotion where might I and all those dear helpless creatures have been now?""",think tired world anxiety seek abode peace beauty spot lovely scene calm content sweet sadness create preserve hope appear gone provide save dare repine full gratitude forgive wife child safe regret few worldly goods seclusion world time time rebellious time please wisdom ordain turn tent old remain asleep excellent old man think heart oak hide rugged bark devotion dear helpless creature 
4,"The dogs, who had crept into the tent and laid themselves down upon the mattresses by the side of William and Tommy, now fawned upon Mr Seagrave.  William woke up with their whining, and having received a caution from his father not to wake Ready, he dressed himself and came out.",dog creep tent lay mattress side fawn wake whining receive caution father wake ready dress come 
5,"""Had I not better call Juno, father?"" said William; ""I think I can, without waking mamma, if she is asleep.""",call father say think wake mamma asleep 
6,"""Then do, if you can, my boy; and I will see what cooking utensils Ready has brought on shore.""",boy see cooking utensil ready bring shore 
7,"William soon returned to his father, stating that his mother was in a sound sleep, and that Juno had got up without waking her or the two children.",return father state mother sound sleep get wake child 
8,"""Well, we'll see if we cannot get some breakfast ready for them, William.  Those dry cocoa-nut leaves will make an excellent fire.""",see get breakfast ready dry cocoa nut leave make excellent fire 
9,"""But, father, how are we to light the fire? we have no tinder-box or matches.""",father light fire have tinder box match 
10,"""No; but there are other ways, William, although, in most of them, tinder is necessary.  The savages can produce fire by rubbing a soft piece of wood against a hard one.  But we have gunpowder; and we have two ways of igniting gunpowder--one is by a flint and steel, and the other is by collecting the sun's rays into one focus by a magnifying-glass.""",be other way most tinder necessary savage produce fire rub soft piece wood hard one have gunpowder have way ignit gunpowder flint steel other collect sun ray focus magnify glass 
11,"""But, father, when we have lighted the fire, what have we to cook? we have no tea or coffee.""",father light fire cook have tea coffee 
12,"""No, I do not think we have,"" replied Mr Seagrave.",think have reply 
13,"""But we have potatoes, father.""",have potato father 
14,"""Yes, William, but don't you think it would be better if we made our breakfast off the cold beef and pork and ship's biscuit for once, and not use the potatoes? we may want them all to plant, you know.  But why should we not go on board of the ship ourselves? you can pull an oar pretty well, and we must all learn to work now, and not leave everything for poor old Ready to do.  Come, William.""",think good make breakfast cold beef pork ship biscuit use potato want plant know go board ship pull oar learn work leave poor old ready do come 
15,"Mr Seagrave then went down to the cove; the little boat was lying on the beach, just lifted by the rippling waves; they pushed her off, and got into her.  ""I know where the steward kept the tea and coffee, father,"" said William, as they pulled on board; ""mamma would like some for breakfast, I'm sure, and I'll milk the goats for baby.""",go cove little boat lie beach lift ripple wave push get know steward keep tea coffee father say pull board mamma like breakfast sure milk goat baby 
16,"Although they were neither of them very handy at the oar, they were soon alongside of the ship; and, having made the boat fast, they climbed on board.",handy oar ship make boat climb board 
17,"William first went down to the cabin for the tea and coffee, and then left his father to collect other things while he went to milk the goats, which he did in a tin pan.  He then poured the milk into a bottle, which he had washed out, that it might not be spilt, and went back to his father.",go cabin tea coffee leave father collect other thing go milk goat do tin pan pour milk bottle wash spilt go father 
18,"""I have filled these two baskets full of a great many things, William, which will be very acceptable to your mamma.  What else shall we take?""",fill basket full great many thing acceptable mamma take 
19,"""Let us take the telescope, at all events, father; and let us take a whole quantity of clothes--they will please mamma: the clean ones are all in the drawers--we can bring them up in a sheet; and then, father, let us bring some of the books on shore; and I'm sure mamma will long for her Bible and prayer-book;--here they are.""",let take telescope event father let take whole quantity clothes please mamma clean one drawer bring sheet father let bring book shore sure mamma prayer book 
20,"""You are a good boy, William,"" replied Mr Seagrave.  ""I will now take those things up to the boat, and then return for the rest.""",good boy reply take thing boat return rest 
21,"In a short time everything was put into the boat, and they pulled on shore again.  They found Juno, who had been washing herself, waiting for them at the cove, to assist to take up the things.",short time put boat pull shore find wash wait cove assist take thing 
22,"""Well, Juno, how do you find yourself this morning?""",find morning 
23,"""Quite well, massa,"" said Juno: and then pointing to the clear water, she said, ""Plenty fish here.""",massa say point clear water say plenty fish 
24,"""Yes, if we only had lines,"" replied Mr Seagrave.  ""I think Ready has both hooks and lines somewhere.  Come, Juno, take up this bundle of linen to your tent: we can manage all the rest.""",have line reply think ready have hook line come take bundle linen tent manage rest 
25,"When they arrived at the tent they found that every one was awake except Ready, who appeared still to sleep very sound.  Mrs Seagrave had passed a very good night, and felt herself much refreshed.  William made some touch-paper, which he lighted with one of the glasses from the telescope, and they soon had a good fire.  Mr Seagrave went to the beach, and procured three large stones to rest the saucepan on; and in half an hour the water was boiling and the tea made.",arrive tent find one awake ready appear sleep sound pass good night feel refresh make touch paper light glasses telescope have good fire go beach procure large stone rest saucepan hour water boil tea make
