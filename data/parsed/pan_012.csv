1,CHAPTER 12. THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF,chapter children carried 
2,"The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.",pirate attack complete surprise sure proof unscrupulous conduct surprise redskin wit white man 
3,"By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching.",unwritten law savage warfare redskin attack wiliness race do dawn time know courage white low ebb white man meantime make rude stockade summit yonder undulate ground foot stream run destruction water await onslaught inexperienced one clutch revolver tread twig old hand sleep dawn long black night savage scout wriggle snake grass stir blade brushwood close sand mole dive sound hear save give vent wonderful imitation lonely call coyote cry answer other brave do good coyote good chill hour wear long suspense try paleface have live first time train hand ghastly call ghastly silence intimation night march 
4,That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.,usual procedure know disregard excuse plea ignorance 
5,"The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his. They left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home, awaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale death.",part trust honour whole action night stand mark contrast leave undone consistent reputation tribe alertness sense marvel despair civilised people know pirate island moment trod dry stick short space time coyote cry begin foot ground spot land force home tree examine brave wear mocassin heel front find hillock stream base have choice establish wait dawn map diabolical cunning main body redskin fold blanket phlegmatic manner pearl manhood squatet child home await cold moment deal pale death 
6,"Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which they were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with no policy but to fall to [get into combat]. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot helplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.",dreaming wide awake exquisite torture put break day confide savage find treacherous hook account supply such scout escape carnage seem pause rise ground certain grey light see thought wait attack appear first last visit subtle mind hold night spend pound policy fall get combat bewilder scout do master war like artifice save one trot expose fatally view give pathetic utterance coyote cry 
7,"Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at victory. No more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father’s sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx [dense formation] that would have been hard to break had they risen quickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.",brave stoutest warrior see perfidious pirate bear fell eye film look victory more torture stake happy hunting grounds know father son acquitt have time gather phalanx dense formation hard break rise forbidden do tradition race write noble savage express surprise presence white terrible sudden appearance pirate remain stationary moment muscle moving foe come invitation tradition upheld seize weapon air torn war cry late 
8,"It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.",part describe massacre fight perish many flower tribe unavenged die fall disturb spanish more other bite dust alsatian fall tomahawk terrible cut way pirate small remnant tribe 
9,"To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme, and the fell [deadly] genius with which it was carried out.",extent blame tactic occasion historian decide wait rise ground proper hour man butcher judge fair take account do acquaint opponent propose follow new method other hand destroy element surprise make strategy avail whole question beset difficulty least withhold reluctant admiration wit conceive bold scheme fall deadly genius carry 
10,"What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment? Fain [gladly] would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance.",own feeling triumphant moment dog know breathe wipe cutlass gather discreet distance hook squint ferret eye extraordinary man elation heart face reflect dark solitary enigma stand aloof follower spirit substance 
11,"The night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he should get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their band, but chiefly Pan.",night work redskin come destroy bee smoke get honey pan want band pan 
12,"Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatred of him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the crocodile’s pertinacity [persistance], hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not--. There is no beating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter’s cockiness.",small boy tend wonder man hatred true flung arm crocodile increase insecurity life lead ow crocodile pertinacity persistance account vindictiveness relentless malignant truth be goad pirate captain frenzy courage engage appearance be beating bush know get tell cockiness 
13,"This had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at night it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.",get nerve make iron claw twitch night disturb insect live torture man feel lion cage sparrow come 
14,"The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple [hesitate] to ram them down with poles.",question get tree get dog run greedy eye search thin one wriggle know scruple hesitate rum pole 
15,"In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as their mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate.",meantime boy see first clang weapon turn stone figure open mouthed appealing outstretched arm return mouth close arm fall side pandemonium cease arise pass fierce gust wind know passing determine fate 
16,Which side had won?,side win 
17,"The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.",pirate listen mouth tree hear question put boy hear answer 
18,"“If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat the tom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.”",win say beat tom tom sign victory 
19,"Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it. “You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudibly of course, for strict silence had been enjoined [urged]. To his amazement Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably, had this simple man admired Hook so much.",find tom tom moment sit hear tom tom mutter course strict silence enjoin urge amazement sign beat tom tom come understanding dreadful wickedness order have simple man admire hook 
20,"Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully.",beat instrument stop listen 
21,"“The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indian victory!”",tom tom miscreant hear cry indian victory 
22,"The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart.",doom child answer cheer music black heart repeat good by puzzle pirate other feeling swallow base delight enemy about come tree smirk other rub hand give order man tree other arrange line yard
