1,CHAPTER 13. TRIPPING.,tripping 
2,"When the day came for returning to Crofton, Hugh would have left his crutches behind at his uncle's, so much did he prefer walking with the little light stick-leg he had been practising with for a fortnight.  But his aunt shook her head at this, and ordered the crutches into the gig. He still walked slowly and cautiously, and soon grew tired: and she thought he might find it a relief at times to hop about on his crutches. They were hidden under the bed, however, immediately on his arrival; so anxious was Hugh to make the least of his lameness, and look as like other boys as possible, both for Tooke's sake and his own.  When the boys had been all assembled for one day, and everybody had seen how little Proctor could walk, the subject seemed to be dropped, and nothing was talked of but the new usher.  So Hugh said to himself; and he really thought that he had fully taken his place again as a Crofton boy, and that he should be let off all notice of his infirmity henceforth, and all trials from it, except such as no one but himself need know of.  He was even not quite sure whether he should not be a gainer by it on the whole.  He remembered Tooke's assurances of protection and friendship; he found Phil very kind and watchful; and Mrs Watson told him privately that he was to be free of the orchard.  She showed him the little door through which he might enter at any time, alone, or with one companion. Here he might read, or talk, and get out of sight of play that he could not share.  The privilege was to be continued as long as no mischief was done to anything within the orchard.  The prospect of the hours, the quiet hours, the bright hours that he should spend here alone with Dale, delighted Hugh: and when he told Dale, Dale liked the prospect too; and they went together, at the earliest opportunity, to survey their new domain, and plan where they would sit in spring, and how they would lie on the grass in summer, and be closer and closer friends for ever.",day come return leave crutch uncle prefer walk little light stick leg practise fortnight aunt shake head order crutch gig walk grow tired think find relief time hop crutch hide bed arrival anxious make least lameness look other boy possible sake own boy assemble day see little walk subject seem drop talk new usher say think take place boy let notice infirmity henceforth trial such need know sure gainer whole remember assurance protection friendship find kind watchful tell free orchard show little door enter time companion read talk get sight play share privilege continue mischief do orchard prospect hour quiet hour bright hour spend delight tell like prospect go early opportunity survey new domain plan sit spring lie grass summer close close friend 
3,"Holt was encouraged to hope that he should have his turn sometimes; but he saw that, though Hugh cared more for him than before the holidays, he yet loved Dale the best.",encourage hope have turn see care more holiday love good 
4,"While Hugh was still in spirits at the thought that his worst trials were over, and the pleasure of his indulgences to come, he felt very complacent; and he thought he would gratify himself with one more reading of the theme which he had written in the holidays,--the theme which he really believed Mr Tooke might fairly praise,--so great had been the pains he had taken with the composition, and so neatly was it written out.  He searched for it in vain among his books and in his portfolio.  Then he got leave to go up to his room, and turn over all his clothes.  He did so in vain; and at last he remembered that it was far indeed out of his reach,--in the drawer of his aunt's work-table, where it had lain ever since she had asked him for it, to read to a lady who had visited her.",spirit thought bad trial pleasure indulgence come feel complacent think gratify more reading theme write holiday theme believe praise great pain take composition write search vain book portfolio get leave go room turn clothes vain last remember reach drawer aunt work table lain ask read lady visit 
5,"The themes would certainly be called for the first thing on Mr Tooke's appearance in school, at nine the next morning.  The duties of the early morning would leave no one any time to run to Mr Shaw's then.  If anybody went, it must be now.  The first day was one of little regularity; it was only just beginning so grow dusk; any willing boy might be back before supper; and there was no doubt that leave would be given on such an occasion.  So Hugh made his way to the playground as fast as possible, and told his trouble to his best friends there,--to Phil, and Holt, and Dale, and as many as happened to be within hearing.",theme call first thing appearance school next morning duty early morning leave time run go first day little regularity begin grow dusk willing boy supper be doubt leave give occasion make way playground possible tell trouble good friend many happen hearing

9,"""But it is there: it is at my uncle's, if any one would go for it,"" said Hugh, beginning to be agitated.",uncle go say begin agitate

11,"""It is not near dark; it will not be dark this hour.  Anybody might run there and back before supper.""",dark dark hour run supper 
12,"He looked at Dale; but Dale looked another way.  For a moment he thought of Tooke's permission to appeal to him when he wanted a friend: but Tooke was not within hearing; and he dismissed the thought of pointing out Tooke to anybody's notice.  He turned away as Phil repeated that it was quite certain that there would be no bad consequences from his being unprovided with a theme, which was not one of his regular lessons.",look look way moment think permission appeal want friend hearing dismiss thought point notice turn repeat certain be bad consequence unprovide theme regular lesson 
13,"Phil was not quite easy, however: nor were the others who heard; and in a minute they looked round for Hugh.  He was leaning his face upon his arms, against the orchard-wall; and when, with gentle force, they pulled him away, they saw that his face was bathed in tears.  He sobbed out,--",easy other hear minute look lean face arm orchard wall gentle force pull see face bath tear sobb 
14,"""I took such pains with that theme,--all the holidays!  And I can't go for it myself.""",take such pain theme holiday go 
15,"There were loud exclamations from many against Phil, against one another, and against themselves; and now everybody was eager to go. Phil stopped all who had started off, saying that it was his business; and the next moment, Phil was at Mr Tooke's study-door, asking leave of absence till supper.",be loud exclamation many eager go stop start say business next moment study door ask leave absence supper 
16,"""Little Holt has been beforehand with you,"" said Mr Tooke.  ""I refused him, however, as he is not so fit as you to be out after dark.  Off with you!""",little say refuse fit dark 
17,"Before Phil returned, it struck Hugh that he had been very selfish; and that it was not a good way of bearing his trial to impose on any one a walk of four miles, to repair a piece of carelessness of his own. Nobody blamed him; but he did not like to look in the faces round him, to see what people thought.  When Phil returned, fresh and hungry from the frosty air, and threw down the paper, saying,--",return strike selfish good way bear trial impose one walk mile repair piece carelessness own blame like look face see person think return fresh hungry frosty air throw paper say 
18,"""There is your theme, and my aunt is very sorry,"" Hugh said,--",be theme aunt sorry say 
19,"""Oh!  Phil, and I am so sorry too!  I hope you are not very tired.""",sorry hope tired 
20,"""Never mind!"" replied Phil.  ""There is your theme.""",mind reply be theme 
21,"And with this Hugh was obliged to be satisfied; but it left him exceedingly uncomfortable--sorry for Phil--disappointed in Dale--and much more disappointed in himself.  The thought of what Holt had wished to do was the only pleasant part of it; and Hugh worked beside Holt, and talked with him all the evening.",oblige satisfy leave uncomfortable sorry disappoint disappointed thought wish do only pleasant part work talk evening 
22,"Hugh felt, the next morning, as if he was never to have any pleasure from his themes, though they were the lesson he did best.  This one was praised, quite as much as the former one: and he did not this time tell anybody what Mr Tooke had said about it: but the pleasure was spoiled by the recollection that his brother had run four miles on account of it, and that he himself must have appeared to others more selfish than he thought them.  He burned his theme, that he might the more easily forget all about it; and the moment after he had done so, Phil said he should have kept it, as other boys did theirs, for his parents to see.",feel next morning have pleasure theme lesson do good one praise much former one time tell say pleasure spoiled recollection brother run mile account appear other selfish think burn theme forget moment do say keep other boy do parent see 
23,"Mr Crabbe was just such a master as it was good for the little boys to be under.  He did not punish capriciously, nor terrify them by anything worse than his strictness.  Very strict he was; and he thus caused them some fear every day: for Holt was backward, and not very clever: and Hugh was still much less able to learn than most other boys.  But all felt that Mr Crabbe was not unreasonable, and they always knew exactly how much to be afraid of.  Whether he had inquired, or been told, the story of Hugh's lameness, they did not know.  He said nothing about it, except just asking Hugh whether it tired him to stand up in class, saying that he might sit at the top or bottom of the class, instead of taking places, if he chose.  Hugh did find it rather fatiguing at first: but he did not like to take advantage of Mr Crabbe's offer, because it so happened that he was almost always at the bottom of his classes: and to have withdrawn from the contest would have looked like a trick to hide the shame, and might have caused him to be set down as a dunce who never could rise.  He thanked Mr Crabbe, and said that if he should rise in his classes, and keep a good place for some time, he thought he should be glad to sit, instead of standing; but meantime he had rather be tired.  Then the feeling of fatigue went off before he rose, or saw any chance of rising.",master good little boy punish terrify bad strictness strict cause fear day backward clever able learn most other boy feel unreasonable know much afraid inquire tell story lameness know say ask tired stand class say sit top bottom class take place choose find fatiguing first like take advantage offer happen bottom class withdraw contest look trick hide shame cause set dunce rise thank say rise class keep good place time think glad sit stand tired feeling fatigue go rise see chance rise 
24,"This inability to do his lessons so well as other boys was a deep and lasting grief to Hugh.  Though he had in reality improved much since he came to Crofton, and was now and then cheered by some proof of this, his general inferiority in this respect was such as to mortify him every day of his life, and sometimes to throw him almost into despair.  He saw that everybody pitied him for the loss of his foot, but not for this other trouble, while he felt this to be rather the worst of the two; and all the more because he was not sure himself whether or not he could help it, as every one else seemed certain that he might.  When he said his prayer in his bed, he earnestly entreated that he might be able to bear the one trouble, and be delivered from the other; and when, as the spring came on, he was found by one friend or another lying on the grass with his face hidden, he was often praying with tears for help in doing this duty, when he was thought to be grieving that he could not play at leaping or foot-ball, like other boys.  And yet, the very next evening, when the whole school were busy over their books, and there was nothing to interfere with his work, he would pore over his lesson without taking in half the sense, while his fancy was straying everywhere but where it ought;--perhaps to little Harry, or the Temple Gardens at home, or to Cape Horn, or Japan--some way farther off still.  It did not often happen now, as formerly, that he forgot before morning a lesson well learned over-night.  He was aware that now everything depended on whether he was once sure of his lesson; but the difficulty was in once being sure of it.",inability do lesson other boy deep lasting grief reality improve much come cheer proof general inferiority respect such mortify day life throw despair see pity loss foot other trouble feel bad more sure help one else seem certain say prayer bed entreat able bear trouble deliver other spring come find friend lie grass face hide pray tear help do duty think grieve play leaping foot ball other boy next evening whole school busy book be interfere work pore lesson take sense fancy stray little home happen forget morning lesson learn night aware depend sure lesson difficulty sure 
25,"Finding Phil's kindness continue through the first weeks and months of the half-year, Hugh took courage at last to open his mind pretty freely to his brother, offering to do anything in the world for Phil, if he would only hear him his lessons every evening till he could say them perfect.  Phil was going to plead that he had no time, when Hugh popped out--",find kindness continue first week month half year take courage last open mind brother offer do world hear lesson evening say perfect go plead have time pop 
26,"""The thing is that it does not help me to say them to just anybody. Saying them to somebody that I am afraid of is what I want.""",thing help say say afraid want 
27,"""Why, you are not afraid of me?"" said Phil.  ""Yes I am--rather.""",afraid say 
28,"""What for?""",
29,"""Oh, because you are older;--and you are so much more of a Crofton boy than I am--and you are very strict--and altogether--""",old more boy strict 
30,"""Yes, you will find me pretty strict, I can tell you,"" said Phil, unable to restrain a complacent smile on finding that somebody was afraid of him.  ""Well, we must see what we can do.  I will hear you to-night, at any rate.""",find strict tell say unable restrain complacent smile find afraid see do hear night rate 
31,"Between his feeling of kindness and the gratification of his vanity, Phil found himself able to hear his brother's lessons every evening.  He was certainly very strict, and was not sparing of such pushes, joggings, and ridicule as were necessary to keep Hugh up to his work.  These were very provoking sometimes; but Hugh tried to bear them for the sake of the gain.  Whenever Phil would condescend to explain, in fresh words, the sense of what Hugh had to learn, he saved trouble to both, and the lesson went off quickly and easily: but sometimes he would not explain anything, and soon went away in impatience, leaving Hugh in the midst of his perplexities.  There was a chance, on such occasions, that Firth might be at leisure, or Dale able to help: so that, one way and another, Hugh found his affairs improving as the spring advanced; and he began to lose his anxiety, and to gain credit with the usher.  He also now and then won a place in his classes.",feeling kindness gratification vanity find able hear brother lesson evening strict spare such push jogging ridicule necessary keep work provoking try bear sake gain condescend explain fresh word sense have learn save trouble lesson go explain go impatience leave midst perplexity be chance such occasion leisure able help way find affair improve spring advance begin lose anxiety gain credit usher win place class 
32,"Towards the end of May, when the trees were full of leaf, and the evenings sunny, and the open air delicious, quite up to bedtime, Phil became persuaded, very suddenly, that Hugh could get on by himself now; that it was not fair that he should be helped; and that it was even hurtful to him to rely on any one but himself.  If Phil had acted gradually upon this conviction, withdrawing his help by degrees, it might have been all very well: but he refused at once and decidedly to have anything more to do with Hugh's lessons, as he was quite old and forward enough now to do them by himself.  This announcement threw his brother into a state of consternation not at all favourable to learning; and the next morning Hugh made several blunders.  He did the same every day that week; was every afternoon detained from play to learn his lessons again; and on the Saturday morning (repetition day) he lost all the places he had gained, and left off at the bottom of every class.",end tree full leaf evening sunny open air delicious bedtime become persuade get fair help hurtful rely one act conviction withdraw help degree refuse have more do lesson old do announcement throw brother state consternation favourable learning next morning make several blunder do same day week afternoon detain play learn lesson morning repetition day lose place gain leave bottom class 
33,"What could Mr Crabbe suppose but that a sudden fit of idleness was the cause of this falling back?  It appeared so to him, and to the whole school; and poor Hugh felt as if there was scorn in every eye that looked upon his disgrace.  He thought there could not be a boy in the school who did not see or hear that he was at the bottom of every class.",suppose sudden fit idleness cause falling appear whole school poor feel be scorn eye look disgrace think be boy school see hear bottom class 
34,"Mr Crabbe always desired to be just: and he now gave Hugh the opportunity of explaining, if he had anything to say.  He remained in the school-room after the boys had left it, and asked Hugh a question or two.  But Hugh sobbed and cried so bitterly that he could not speak so as to be understood; and he did not wish to explain, feeling that he was much obliged to Phil for his former help, and that he ought not to complain to any master of its being now withdrawn.  So Mr Crabbe could only hope that next week would show a great difference, and advise him to go out with the rest this afternoon, to refresh himself for a new effort.",desire give opportunity explain have say remain school room boy leave ask question sobb cry speak understand wish explain feel oblige former help complain master withdraw hope next week show great difference advise go rest afternoon refresh new effort 
35,"Hugh did not know whether he had not rather have been desired to stay at home than go out among so many who considered him disgraced.  It really was hard (though Holt stood by him, and Dale was his companion as usual) to bear the glances he saw, and the words that came to his ear.  Some boys looked to see how red his eyes were: some were surprised to see him abroad, and hinted a favouritism because he was not shut up in the school-room.  Some asked whether he could say his alphabet yet; and others whether he could spell ""dunce.""  The most cruel thing of all was to see Tooke in particularly high spirits.  He kept away from Hugh; but Hugh's eye followed him from afar, and saw that he capered and laughed, and was gayer than at any time this half-year.  Hugh saw into his heart (or thought he did) as plain as he saw to the bottom of the clear stream in the meadows, to which they were bound for their afternoon's sport.",know desire stay home go many consider disgrace hard stand companion usual bear glance see word come ear boy look see red eye surprise see hint favouritism shut school room ask say alphabet other spell dunce cruel thing see high spirit keep eye follow see caper laugh gayer time half year see heart think plain see bottom clear stream meadow bind afternoon sport 
36,"""I know what Tooke is feeling,"" thought he.  ""He is pleased to see me lowered, as long as it is not his doing.  He is sorry to see me suffer by my lameness; because that hurts his conscience: but he is pleased to see me wrong and disgraced, because that relieves him of the feeling of being obliged to me.  If I were now to put him in mind of his promise, to stand by me, and protect me--I declare I will--it will stop his wicked joy--it will make him remember his duty.""",know feel think pleased see lower do sorry see suffer lameness hurt conscience pleased see wrong disgraced relieve feeling oblige put mind promise stand protect declare stop wicked joy make remember duty 
37,"Dale wondered to see Hugh start off, as fast as he could go, to overtake the foremost boys, who were just entering the meadow, and spreading themselves over it.  Tooke could, alas!  Like everybody else, go faster than Hugh; and there was no catching him, though he did not seem to see that anybody wanted him.  Neither could he be made to hear, though Hugh called him as loud as he could shout.  Holt was so sorry to see Hugh hot and agitated, that he made no objection to going after Tooke, though he was pretty sure Tooke would be angry with him.  Holt could run as fast as anybody, and he soon caught the boy he was pursuing, and told him that little Proctor wanted him very much indeed, that very moment. Tooke sent him about his business, saying that he could not come; and then immediately proposed brook-leaping for their sport, leading the way himself over a place so wide that no lesser boy, however nimble, could follow.  Holt came running back, shaking his head, and showing that his errand was in vain.  Tooke was so full of play that he could think of nothing else; which was a shame.",wonder see start go overtake foremost boy enter meadow spread else go fast be catching seem see want make hear call shout sorry see hot agitated make objection go sure angry run catch boy pursue tell little want very moment send business say come propose brook leaping sport lead way place wide less boy nimble follow come run shake head show errand vain full play think else shame 
38,"""Ah!  And you little know,"" thought Hugh, ""how deep a shame it is.""",little know think deep shame 
39,"With a swelling heart he turned away, and went towards the bank of the broader stream which ran through the meadows.  Dale was with him in a moment,--very sorry for him, because everybody else was at brook-leaping,--the sport that Hugh had loved so well last autumn.  Dale passed his arm round Hugh's neck, and asked where they should sit and tell stories,--where they could best hide themselves, so that nobody should come and tease them.  Hugh wished to thank his friend for this; but he could not speak directly.  They found a pleasant place among the flowering reeds on the bank, where they thought nobody would see them; and having given Holt to understand that they did not want him, they settled themselves for their favourite amusement of story-telling.",swell heart turn go bank broad stream run meadow moment sorry else brook leap sport love last autumn pass arm neck ask sit tell story hide come tease wish thank friend speak find pleasant place flower reed bank think see give understand want settle favourite amusement story tell 
40,"But Hugh's heart was too full and too sick for even his favourite amusement; and Dale was perhaps too sorry for him to be the most judicious companion he could have at such a time.  Dale agreed that the boys were hard and careless; and he added that it was particularly shameful to bring up a boy's other faults when he was in disgrace for one.  In the warmth of his zeal, he told how one boy had been laughing at Hugh's conceit about his themes, when he had shown to-day that he could not go half through his syntax; and how he had heard another say that all that did not signify half so much as his being mean about money.  Between Hugh's eagerness to hear, and Dale's sympathy, five minutes were not over before Hugh had heard every charge that could be brought against his character, and knew that they were all circulating this very afternoon.  In his agony of mind he declared that everybody at Crofton hated him,--that he could never hold up his head there,--that he would ask to be sent home by the coach, and never come near Crofton again.",heart full sick favourite amusement sorry judicious companion have time agree boy hard careless add shameful bring boy other fault disgrace warmth zeal tell boy laugh conceit theme show day go half syntax hear say signify half much mean money eagerness hear sympathy minute hear charge bring character know circulate very afternoon agony mind declare hate hold head ask send coach come 
41,"Dale now began to be frightened, and wished he had not said so much.  He tried to make light of it; but Hugh seemed disposed to do something decided;--to go to his uncle Shaw's at least, if he could not get home. Dale earnestly protested, against any such idea, and put him in mind how he was respected by everybody for his bravery about the loss of his foot.",begin frighten wish say try make light seem dispose do decide go uncle least get protest such idea put mind respect bravery loss foot

59,"And he was off.  Holt looked after him, and then towards Hugh, hesitating whether to go or stay.  Hugh took no notice of him: so he went slowly away, and Hugh was left alone.",look hesitate go stay take notice go leave alone 
60,"He was in an extreme perturbation.  At the first moment, he was beyond measure hurt with Dale.  He did not think his best friend would have so reminded him of his infirmity, and of his being a restraint on his companions.  He did not think any friend could have left him at such a moment.  Then it occurred to him,--",extreme perturbation first moment measure hurt think good friend remind infirmity restraint companion think friend leave moment occur

I was just going to spoil the only good thing I ever did for anybody in my life.  But it is spoiled--completely spoiled.  I shall never be able to trust myself again.  It is all by mere accident that it is not all over now.  If Holt had not come that very instant, my secret would have been out, and I could never have got it back again!

69,"Dale's curiosity was so strong that Hugh saw how dangerous it was to have tantalised it.  He had to remind his friend of Mr Tooke's having put all the boys upon honour not to inquire on this subject.  This brought Dale to himself; and he promised never again to urge Hugh, or encourage his speaking of the matter at all.  They then went to story-telling; but it would not do to-day.  Hugh could not attend; and Dale could not invent, while there was no sympathy in his hearer.  He was presently released, for it struck Hugh that he should like to write to his mother this very afternoon.  His heart was heavy, and he wanted to tell her what was in it.  Mr Crabbe gave him leave to go home; and Dale was in time for plenty more play.",curiosity strong see dangerous tantalise have remind friend put boy honour inquire subject bring promise urge encourage speak matter go story tell do day attend invent be sympathy hearer release strike like write mother very afternoon heart heavy want tell give leave go time plenty more play 
70,"Hugh had the great school-room all to himself; and as the window before his desk was open, he had the pleasure of the fresh air, and the smell of the blossoms from the orchard, and the sound of the waving of the tall trees in the wind, and the cawing of the rooks as the trees waved. These things all made him enjoy scribbling away to his mother, as well as finding his mind grow easier as he went on.  Besides, he had not to care for the writing; for he had met Mr Tooke by the church, and had got his leave to send his letter without anybody's looking at it, as he had something very particular to say.  He wrote,--",have great school room window desk open have pleasure fresh air smell blossom orchard sound wave tall tree wind caw rook tree wave thing make enjoy scribble mother find mind grow easy go have care writing meet church get leave send letter look have particular say write

If I had told anybody in the world who pulled me off the wall, it   should and would have been you,--that night after it happened: and I   am afraid I should have told you, if you had not prevented it: for I   find I am not to be trusted when I am talking with anybody I love very   much.  I have not told yet: but I should have told Dale if Holt had   not run up at the very moment.  It makes me very unhappy,--almost as   much as if I had let it out: for how do I know but that I may tell a   hundred times over in my life, if I could forget so soon?  I shall be   afraid of loving anybody very much, and talking with them alone, as   long as I live.  I never felt the least afraid of telling till to-day;   and you cannot think how unhappy it makes me.  And then, the thing   that provoked me to tell was that boy's being surly to me, and glad   that I was in disgrace this morning, for doing my lessons badly all   this week,--the very thing that should have made me particularly   careful how I behaved to him: for his pulling me off the wall was only   accident, after all.  Everything has gone wrong to-day; and I am very   unhappy, and I feel as if I should never be sure of anything again;   and so I write to you.  You told me you expected me not to fail; and   you see I have; and the next thing is that I must tell you of it.",afternoon come meadow rest tell make uneasy tell world pull wall night happen afraid tell prevent find trust talk love tell tell run very moment make unhappy much let know tell time life forget afraid love talk live feel least afraid tell day think unhappy make thing provoke tell boy surly glad disgrace morning do lesson week very thing make careful behave pull wall accident go wrong day unhappy feel sure write tell expect fail see have next thing tell

77,"When the letter was finished and closed, Hugh felt a good deal relieved: but still not happy.  He had opened his heart to the best friend he had in this world: but he still felt grievously humbled for the present, and alarmed for the future.  Then he remembered that he might seek comfort from a better Friend still; and that He who had sent him his trial could and would help him to bear it with honour as well as with patience.  As he thought of this, he saw that the boys were trooping home, along the road, and he slipped out, and into the orchard, where he knew he might be alone with his best Friend.  He stayed there till the supper-bell rang; and when he came in, it was with a cheerful face.  He was as merry as anybody at supper: and afterwards he found his lessons more easy to him than usual.  The truth was that his mind was roused by the conflicts of the day.  He said his lessons to Phil (who found time to-night to hear him), without missing a word.  When he went to bed, he had several pleasant thoughts.  His secret was still his own (though by no merit of his); to-morrow was Sunday,--likely to be a bright, sweet May Sunday,-- his lessons were quite ready for Monday; and possibly there might be a letter from his mother in the course of the week.",letter finish close feel good deal relieve happy open heart good friend have world feel humble present alarm future remember seek comfort good friend send trial help bear honour patience think see boy troop road slip orchard know alone good friend stay supper bell ring come cheerful face merry supper find lesson easy usual truth mind rouse conflict day say lesson find time night hear miss word go bed have several pleasant thought secret own merit likely bright sweet lesson ready be letter mother course week

Yet she found time to answer it by the very next post.  When her letter was handed to Hugh, with the seal unbroken, because `private' was written large on the outside, we thought she was the kindest mother that ever was, to have written so soon, and to have minded all his wishes.

The   very best people say this of themselves, in their thanksgivings to   God, and their confessions to one another.  Though you were very   unhappy on Saturday, I am not sorry that these things have happened,   as I think you will be the safer and the wiser for them.  You say you   never till then felt the least afraid of telling.  Now you know the   danger; and that is a good thing.  I think you will never again see   that boy (whoever he may be), without being put upon your guard.   Still, we are all sadly forgetful about our duty; and, if I were you,   I would use every precaution against such a danger as you have   escaped,--it makes me tremble to think how narrowly.  If I were you, I   would engage any friend I should become intimate with, the whole time   of being at school, and perhaps afterwards, never to say a word about   the accident,--or, at least, about how it happened.  Another way is to   tell me your mind, as you have now; for you may be sure that it is my   wish that you should keep your secret, and that I shall always be glad   to help you to do it.",be letter surprise believe heart know find have one save do wrong call accident good person say thanksgiving confession unhappy sorry thing happen think safe wise say till feel least afraid tell know danger good thing think see boy put guard forgetful duty use precaution danger escape make tremble think engage friend become intimate whole time school say word accident least happen way tell mind have sure wish keep secret glad help do 
81,"  ""But, my dear boy, I can do but little, in comparison with the best   Friend you have.  He can help you without waiting for your   confidence,--even at the very instant when you are tempted.  It is He   who sends these very accidents (as we call them) by which you have now   been saved.  Have you thanked Him for saving you this time?  And will   you not trust in His help henceforward; instead of supposing yourself   safe, as you now find you are not?  If you use His strength, I feel   that you will not fail.  If you trust your own intentions alone, I   shall never feel sure of you for a single hour, nor be certain that   the companion you love best may not be your worst enemy, in breaking   down your self-command.  But, as you say you were very unhappy on   Saturday, I have no doubt you did go for comfort to the right Friend,   and that you were happier on Sunday.",dear boy do little comparison good friend have help wait confidence very instant tempt send very accident call save thank save time trust help suppose safe find use strength feel fail trust own intention feel sure single hour certain companion love good bad enemy break self command say unhappy have doubt go comfort right friend happy

85,"Hugh was, of course, very glad of this letter.  And he was glad of something else;--that he had done the very things his mother had advised.  He had engaged Dale not to tempt him on this subject any more. He had opened his heart to his mother, and obtained her help; and he had sought a better assistance, and a a higher comfort still.  It was so delightful to have such a letter as this,--to be so understood and aided, that he determined to tell his mother all his concerns, as long as he lived.  When, in the course of the holidays, he told her so, she smiled, and said she supposed he meant as long as _she_ lived; for she was likely to die long before he did.  Hugh could not deny this; but he never liked to think about it:--he always drove away the thought; though he knew, as his mother said, that this was rather cowardly, and that the wisest and most loving people in the world remember the most constantly and cheerfully that friends must be parted for a while, before they can live together for ever.",course glad letter glad else do very thing mother advise engage temp subject more open heart mother obtain help seek good assistance high comfort delightful have letter understand aid determine tell mother concern live course holiday tell smile say suppose mean live likely die deny like think drive thought know mother say cowardly wisest loving person world remember friend part while live
