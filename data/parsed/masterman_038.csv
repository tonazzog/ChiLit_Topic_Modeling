1,CHAPTER 38.,
2,"The construction of the fish-pond proceeded rapidly, and on the third day it was nearly complete.  As soon as all the walls were finished, Ready threw out sand and shingle, so as to make the part next to the beach nearly as deep as the other; so that there might be sufficient water to prevent the gulls and man-of-war birds from darting down, and striking the fish.  While Ready was thus employed, Mr Seagrave and William collected more rocks, so as to divide the pond into four parts, at the same time allowing a communication between each part.  These inside walls, as well as the outside, were made of sufficient width to walk upon; by which means they would have all the fish within reach of the spear, in case they wished to take them out.  The day after the pond was completed the weather changed.  The rain poured down with great force, but it was not accompanied with such terrific thunder and lightning, nor were the storms of so long continuance, as at the commencement of the rainy season.  In the intervals of fine weather they caught a great many fish, which they put into the pond, so that it was well stocked.  But a circumstance occurred, which was the occasion of great alarm to them all; which was, that one evening William was taken with a shivering, and complained very much of a pain in his head.  Ready had promised to continue his narrative on that evening, but William was too ill to sit up.  He was put into bed, and the next morning he was in a violent fever.  Mr Seagrave was much alarmed, as the symptoms were worse every hour; and Ready, who had sat up with him during the night, called Mr Seagrave out of the house, and said, ""This is a bad case, sir: William was working yesterday with his hat off, and I fear that he has been struck by the sun.""",construction fish pond proceed third day complete wall finish ready throw sand shingle make part beach deep other be sufficient water prevent gull man war bird dart strike fish ready employ collect more rock divide pond part same time allow communication part inside wall make sufficient width walk mean have fish reach spear case wish take day pond complete weather change rain pour great force accompany such terrific thunder lightning storm long continuance commencement rainy season interval fine weather catch great many fish put pond stock circumstance occur occasion great alarm evening take shiver complain much pain head ready promise continue narrative evening ill sit put bed next morning violent fever alarm symptom bad hour ready sit night call house say bad case sir work yesterday hat fear strike sun 
3,"The poor boy was for many days in great danger; and the cheerful house was now one of gloom and silence.  How fervent were now the morning and evening prayers; how often during the day did his parents offer up a petition to heaven for their dear boy's recovery.  The weather became finer every day, and it was almost impossible to keep Tommy quiet: Juno went out with him and Albert every morning, and kept them with her while she cooked; and, fortunately, Vixen had some young ones, and when Juno could no longer amuse them, she brought them two of the puppies to play with.  As for the quiet, meek little Caroline, she would remain during the whole day holding her mother's hand, and watching her brother, or working with her needle by the side of his bed.",poor boy many day great danger cheerful house gloom silence fervent morning evening prayer day parent offer petition heaven dear boy recovery weather become finer day impossible keep quiet go morning keep cook have young one amuse bring puppy play quiet little remain whole day hold mother hand watch brother work needle side bed 
4,"Ready, who could not be idle, had taken the hammer and cold chisel to make the salt-pan, at which he worked during those portions of the day in which his services were not required indoors; and as he sat chipping away the rock, his thoughts were ever upon William, for he dearly loved the boy for his amiable disposition and his cleverness; and many a time during the day would he stop his work, and the tears would run down his cheeks as he offered up his petition to the Almighty that the boy might be spared to his afflicted parents.  And those prayers were heard, for on the ninth day William was pronounced by Ready and Mr Seagrave to have much less fever, and shortly afterwards it left him altogether; but he was so weak that he could not raise himself in his bed for two or three days; and it was not till more than a fortnight after the fever had left him that he could go out of the house.  The joy that was expressed by them all when the change took place may be imagined: nor were the thanksgivings less fervent than had been the prayers.",ready idle take hammer cold chisel make salt pan work portion day service require sit chip rock thought love boy amiable disposition cleverness time day stop work tear run cheek offer petition boy spare afflict parent prayer hear ninth day pronounce ready have less fever leave weak raise bed day more fortnight fever leave go house joy express change take place imagine thanksgiving fervent prayer 
5,"During his convalescence, as there was nothing else to do, Mr Seagrave and Ready, who now went gladly to their work, determined, as the salt-pan was finished, that they would make a bathing-place.  Juno came to their assistance, and was very useful in assisting to drag the wheels which brought the rocks and stones; and Tommy was also brought down, that he might be out of the way while Mrs Seagrave and Caroline watched the invalid.  By the time that William was able to go out of the house, the bathing-place was finished, and there was no longer any fear of the sharks.  William came down to the beach with his mother, and looked at the work which had been done; he was much pleased with it, and said, ""Now, Ready, we have finished everything at home for the present; all we have to do is to explore the island, and to go to the cove and examine our collection from the wreck.""",convalescence be else do ready go work determine salt pan finish make bathing place come assistance useful assist drag wheel bring rock stone bring way watch invalid time able go house bathing place finish be fear shark come beach mother look work do pleased say ready finish home present have do explore island go cove examine collection wreck

7,"""I shall soon be strong again, Ready.""",strong ready 
8,"""I have no doubt of it, William; and we have good reason to thank God, for we could ill spare you.""",have doubt have good reason thank spare 
9,"""It's a long while since you have gone on with your story, Ready,"" said William, after they had taken their supper; ""I wish you would do so now, as I am sure I shall not be tired.""",long while go story ready say take supper wish do sure tired 
10,"""With pleasure, William,"" replied Ready; ""but can you remember where I left off, for my memory is none of the best?""",pleasure reply ready remember leave memory good 
11,"""Oh, yes; if you recollect, you had just arrived at a Dutch farmer's house, in company with the savages, at a place called Graaff Reinet, I think.""",recollect arrive dutch farmer house company savage place call think 
12,"""Well then, the Dutch farmer came out when he saw us coming, and asked us who we were.  We told him that we were English prisoners, and that we wished to give ourselves up to the authorities.  He took away our arms and ammunition, and said that he was the authority in that part, which was true enough; and then he said, `You'll not run away without arms and ammunition, that's certain.  As for sending you to the Cape, that I may not be able to do for months; so if you wish to be fed well, you must work well while you're here.'  We replied, that we should be very glad to make ourselves useful, and then he sent us some dinner by a Hottentot girl.  But we soon found out that we had to deal with an ill-tempered, brutal fellow; and that he gave us plenty of hard work, but by no means plenty of food.  He would not trust us with guns, so the Hottentots went out with the cattle, but he gave us plenty of work to do about the house; and at last he treated us very cruelly.  When he was short of provisions for the Hottentots and other slaves, of whom he had a good many, he would go out with the other farmers who lived near him, and shoot quaggas for them to eat.  Nobody but a Hottentot could live upon such flesh.""",dutch farmer come see come ask tell english prisoner wish give authority take arm ammunition say authority part true say run arm ammunition certain send able do month wish feed work reply glad make useful send dinner hottentot girl find have deal ill temper brutal fellow give plenty hard work mean plenty food trust gun go cattle give plenty work do house last treat short provision other slave have good many go other farmer live shoot quagga eat live such flesh 
13,"""What is quagga?""",quagga 
14,"""A wild ass, partly covered with stripes, but not so much as the zebra; a pretty animal to look at, but the flesh is very bad.  At last he would give us nothing to eat but quaggas, the same as the Hottentots, while he and his family--for he had a wife and five children--lived upon mutton and the flesh of the antelope, which is very excellent eating.  We asked him to allow us a gun to procure better food, and he kicked Romer so unmercifully, that he could not work for two days afterwards.  Our lives became quite a burden to us; we were employed all day on the farm, and every day he was more brutal towards us.  At last we agreed that we would stand it no longer, and one evening Hastings told him so.  This put him into a great rage, and he called two of the slaves, and ordered them to tie him to the waggon wheel, swearing that he would cut every bit of skin off his body, and he went into his house to get his whip. The slaves had hold of Hastings, and were tying him up, for they dared not disobey their master, when he said to us, `If I am flogged this way, it will be all over with us.  Now's your time; run back behind the house, and when he comes out with the whip, do you go in and seize the muskets, which are always ready loaded.  Hold him at bay till I get clear, and then we will get away somehow or other.  You must do it, for I am sure he will flog me till I am dead, and he will shoot you, as runaway prisoners, as he did his two Hottentots the other day.'  As Romer and I thought this very probable, we did as Hastings told us; and when the Dutchman had gone towards him where he was tied up, about fifty yards from the house, we went in.  The farmer's wife was in bed, having just had an addition to her family, and the children we cared not for. We seized two muskets and a large knife, and came out just as the Dutchman had struck the first blow with the rhinoceros whip, which was so severe, that it took away poor Hastings' breath.  We went up; he turned round and saw us: we levelled our muskets at him, and he stopped. `Another blow, and we'll shoot you,' cried Romer.  `Yes,' cried I; `we are only boys, but you've Englishmen to deal with.'  When we came up, Romer kept his piece levelled at the Dutchman, while I passed him, and with the knife cut the thongs which bound Hastings.  The Dutchman turned pale and did not speak, he was so frightened, and the slaves ran away. As soon as Hastings was free, he seized a large wooden mallet, used for driving in stakes, and struck the Dutchman down to the earth, crying out, `That for flogging an Englishman, you rascal!'",wild ass cover stripe much zebra pretty animal look flesh bad last give eat quagga same family have wife child live mutton flesh antelope excellent eating ask allow gun procure good food kick work day life become burden employ day farm day brutal last agree stand evening tell put great rage call slave order tie waggon wheel swear cut bit skin body go house get whip slave hold tie disobey master say flogge way time run house come whip go seize musket ready load hold get clear get other do sure flog dead shoot runaway prisoner do other day think probable tell go tie yard house go farmer wife bed have addition family child care seize musket large knife come strike first blow rhinocero whip severe take poor breath go turn see levell musket stop blow shoot cry cry boy have deal come keep piece levell pass knife cut thong bind turn pale speak frighten slave run free seize large wooden mallet use drive stake strike earth cry flog englishman rascal 
15,"""While the man lay senseless or dead--I didn't know which at the time-- we tied him to the waggon wheels, and returning to the house, seized some ammunition and other articles which might be useful.  We then went to the stables, and took the three best horses which the Dutchman had, put some corn in a sack for each of them, took some cord for halters, mounted, and rode away as fast as we could.  As we knew that we should be pursued, we first galloped away as if we were going eastward to the Cape; and then, as soon as we were on ground which would not show the tracks of our horses' hoofs, we turned round to the northward, in the direction of the Bushman country.  It was dark soon after we had altered our course; but we travelled all night, and although we heard the roaring of the lions at a distance, we met with no accident.  At daylight we rested our horses, and gave them some corn, and then sat down to eat some of the provision we had brought with us.""",man lay senseless dead know time tie waggon wheel return house seize ammunition other article useful go stable take good horse have put corn sack take cord halter mount ride know pursue gallop go ground show track horse hoof turn northward direction country dark alter course travel night hear roaring lion distance meet accident daylight rest horse give corn sit eat provision bring 
16,"""How long were you with the farmer at Graaff Reinet?""",farmer 
17,"""Nearly eight months, sir; and during that time we could not only speak Dutch, but we could make ourselves understood by the Hottentots and other natives.  While we were eating we held a consultation how we should proceed.  We were aware that the Dutchmen would shoot us if they came up with us, and that they would come out in strong force against us; and we were afraid that we had killed the man, and if so, they would hang us as soon as we got to the Cape; so we were at a great loss to know how to act.  At last we decided that we would cross the country of the Bushmen, and get to the sea-side, to the northward of the Cape.  We determined that it would be better to travel at night, as there would be less fear of the wild beasts, or of being seen; so we went fast asleep for many hours.  Towards the evening, we found water for the horses, and then we fed them again, and proceeded on our journey.  I won't tell what passed every day for a fortnight, by which time we had pretty well killed our horses, and we were compelled to stop among a tribe of Gorraguas, a very mild, inoffensive people, who supplied us with milk, and treated us very kindly.  We had some adventures, nevertheless.  One day as we were passing by a tuft of small trees, a rhinoceros charged upon my horse, which very narrowly escaped by wheeling short round and getting behind him; the beast then made off without meddling with us any more.  Every day we used to shoot some animal or other, for provision: sometimes it was a gnu, something between an antelope and a bull; at other times it was one of the antelope kind.",month sir time speak make understand other native eat hold consultation proceed aware shoot come come strong force afraid kill man hang get great loss know act last decide cross country get sea side northward determine good travel night be less fear wild beast see go many hour evening find water horse feed proceed journey tell pass day fortnight time kill horse compel stop tribe mild inoffensive person supply milk treat have adventure day pass tuft small tree rhinocero charge horse escape wheel short get beast make meddle more day use shoot animal other provision gnu antelope bull other time antelope kind 
18,"""Well, we stayed for three weeks with these people, and gave our horses time to refresh themselves; and then we set off again, keeping more towards the coast as we went southward, for the Gorraguas told us that there was a fierce native tribe, called Kaffers, to the northward, who would certainly kill us if we went there.  The fact is, we did not know what to do.  We had left the Cape without any exact idea where we should go to, like foolish boys as we were, and we became more entangled with difficulties every day.  At last we decided that it would be better to find our way back to the Cape, and deliver ourselves up as prisoners, for we were tired out with fatigue and constant danger.  All that we were afraid of was that we had killed the Dutch farmer at Graaff Reinet, who had treated us so brutally; but Hastings said he did not care; that was his business, and he would take his chance: so when we bade adieu to the Gorraguas, we turned our horses' heads to the south-east, so as to make the sea and go to the southward at the same time.",stay week person give horse time refresh set keep more coast go tell be fierce native tribe call northward kill go fact know do leave exact idea go foolish boy become entangle difficulty day last decide good find way deliver prisoner tired fatigue constant danger afraid kill dutch farmer treat say care business take chance bid adieu turn horse head south east make sea go southward same time 
19,"""I have now to mention a most melancholy event which occurred.  Two days after we had recommenced our travels, in passing through some high grass, we stumbled on a lion, which was devouring a gnu.  Romer, who happened to be some ten yards foremost of the three, was so alarmed that he fired at the animal, which we had agreed never to do, as it was folly to enrage so powerful a beast, when our party was so small.  The lion was slightly wounded; he gave a roar that might have been heard for a mile, sprang upon Romer, and with one blow of his paw knocked him off the saddle into the bushes.  Our horses, which were frightened, wheeled round and fled, for the animal was evidently about to attack us.  As it was, he did make one bound in our direction; we could not pull up until we had gone half a mile; and when we did, we saw the lion had torn down the horse which Romer had ridden, and was dragging away the carcass to the right at a sort of a canter, without any apparent effort on his part.  We waited till he was well off, and then rode back to the spot where Romer had fallen: we soon found him, but he was quite dead; the blow with the lion's paw had fractured his skull.",have mention melancholy event occur day recommence travel pass high grass stumble lion devour gnu happen yard foremost alarmed fire animal agree do folly enrage powerful beast party small lion wound give roar hear mile spring blow paw knock saddle bush horse frighten wheel flead animal about attack make bind direction pull go mile see lion tear horse ride drag carcass right sort canter apparent effort part wait ride spot fall find dead blow lion paw fracture skull 
20,"""I ought to have said that the Gorraguas told us not to travel by night, but by day; and we had done so in consequence of their advice.  I believe it was very good advice, notwithstanding this unfortunate accident, for we found that when we had travelled all night the lions had more than once followed us the whole time; and indeed I have often thought since that we were altogether indebted to his mercy who ordereth all things, both in heaven and earth, that we escaped so well as we did. Three days after poor Romer's death we first saw the wide ocean again. We kept near the coast, but we soon found that we could not obtain the supply of game, or fuel for our fires at night, so well as we could in the interior, and we agreed to get away from the coast again.  We had a dreary plain to pass over, and we were quite faint for want of food--for we had been without any for nearly two days--when we came upon an ostrich.  Hastings put his horse to his speed, but it was of no use--the ostrich ran much faster than the horse could.  I remained behind, and, to my great joy, discovered his nest, with thirteen large eggs in it. Hastings soon came back, with his horse panting and out of wind.  We sat down, lighted a fire, and roasted two of the eggs: we made a good dinner of them, and having put four more on our saddle-bows, we continued our journey.  At last, one forenoon, we saw the Table Mountain, and were as glad to see it as if we had seen the white cliffs of Old England.  We pushed on our horses with the hopes of being once more comfortably in prison before night; when, as we neared the bay, we noticed that English colours were flying on board of the vessels in the road.  This surprised us very much; but soon after that we met an English soldier, who told us that the Cape had been taken by our forces more than six months ago. This was a joyful surprise, as you may suppose.  We rode into the town, and reported ourselves to the main guard; the governor sent for us, heard our story, and sent us to the admiral, who took us on board of his own ship.""",say tell travel night day do consequence advice believe good advice unfortunate accident find travel night lion have more follow whole time think indebted mercy ordereth thing heaven earth escape day poor death see wide ocean keep coast find obtain supply game fuel fire night interior agree get coast have dreary plain pass faint want food day come ostrich put horse speed use ostrich run fast horse remain great joy discover nest large egg come horse panting wind sit light fire roast egg make good dinner put more saddle bow continue journey last forenoon see glad see see white cliff old push horse hope prison night near bay notice english colour fly board vessel road surprise meet english soldier tell take force more month joyful surprise suppose ride town report main guard governor send hear story send admiral take board own ship
