34,"William immediately climbed up the cocoa-nut tree, and waited there till daylight.  At the dawn of day, he perceived that the savages were at work, that they had collected all the faggots together opposite to where the old house had stood, and were very busy in making arrangements for the attack.  At last, every one shouldered a faggot, and commenced their advance towards the stockade; William immediately descended and called his father, who was talking with Mrs Seagrave.  The muskets were all loaded, and Mrs Seagrave and Juno took their posts below the planking, to reload them as fast as they were fired.",climb cocoa nut tree wait daylight dawn day perceive savage work collect faggot old house stand busy make arrangement attack last one shoulder faggot commence advance stockade descend call father talk musket load take post planking reload fire

Mr Seagrave and William still kept up an incessant fire upon them, but not with so much success as before.",first savage yard fire man drop continue fire assailant come great success first minute savage advance large body take precaution hold faggot front protection approach mean gain stockade safety commence lay faggot keep incessant fire much success 
37,"Although many fell, the faggots were gradually heaped up, till they almost reached to the holes between the palisades, through which they pointed their muskets; and as the savages contrived to slope them down from the stockade to the ground, it was evident that they meant to mount up and take them by escalade.  At last, it appeared as if all the faggots had been placed, and the savages retired farther back, to where the cocoa-nut trees were still standing.",many fall faggot heap reach hole palisadd point musket savage contrive slope stockade ground evident mean mount take escalade last appear faggot place savage retire cocoa nut tree stand

42,"The whole body of savages were now advancing from the cocoa-nut wood in a solid mass; they raised a yell, which struck terror into the hearts of Mrs Seagrave and Juno, yet they flinched not.  The savages were again within fifty yards of them, when the fire was opened upon them; the fire was answered by loud yells, and the savages had already reached to the bottom of the sloping pile of faggots, when the yells and the reports of the muskets were drowned by a much louder report, followed by the crackling and breaking of the cocoa-nut trees, which made both parties start with surprise; another and another followed, the ground was ploughed up, and the savages fell in numbers.",whole body savage advance cocoa nut wood solid mass raise yell strike terror heart flinch savage yard fire open fire answer loud yell savage reach bottom slope pile faggot yell report musket drown louder report follow crackling breaking cocoa nut tree make party start surprise follow ground plough savage fall number

45,"The savages paused in the advance, quite stupefied; again, again, again, the report of the loud guns boomed through the air, and the round-shot and grape came whizzing and tearing through the cocoa-nut grove; at this last broadside, the savages turned, and fled towards their canoes: not one was left to be seen.",savage pause advance stupefy report loud gun boom air round shot grape come whizz tear cocoa nut grove last broadside savage turn flead canoe leave see
