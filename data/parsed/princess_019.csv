4,"In the universal and constant darkness of their dwelling, they had no reason to prefer the one arrangement to the other; but from aversion to the sun-people, they chose to be busy when there was least chance of their being met either by the miners below, when they were burrowing, or by the people of the mountain above, when they were feeding their sheep or catching their goats. And indeed it was only when the sun was away that the outside of the mountain was sufficiently like their own dismal regions to be endurable to their mole-eyes, so thoroughly had they become disused to any light beyond that of their own fires and torches.",universal constant darkness dwelling have reason prefer arrangement other aversion sun person choose busy be least chance meet miner burrow person mountain feed sheep catching goat sun outside mountain own dismal region endurable mole eye become disuse light own fire torche

6,"""How long will it take?"" asked Harelip.",take ask 
7,"""Not many days, I should think,"" answered the king. ""They are poor feeble creatures, those sun-people, and want to be always eating. _We_ can go a week at a time without food, and be all the better for it; but I've been told _they_ eat two or three times every day! Can you believe it?--They must be quite hollow inside--not at all like us, nine-tenths of whose bulk is solid flesh and bone. Yes--I judge a week of starvation will do for him.""",many day think answer king poor feeble creature sun-people want eat go week time food good tell eat time day believe hollow tenth bulk solid flesh bone judge week starvation do

Our little dogs and cats and pigs and small bears would enjoy him very much.""",honor punish insolence return queen poor creature deprive much nourishment little dog cat pig small bear enjoy 
17,"""You are the best of housekeepers, my lovely queen!"" said her husband. ""Let it be so by all means. Let us have our people in, and get him out and kill him at once. He deserves it. The mischief he might have brought upon us, now that he had penetrated so far as our most retired citadel, is incalculable. Or rather let us tie him hand and foot, and have the pleasure of seeing him torn to pieces by full torchlight in the great hall.""",good housekeeper lovely queen say husband let means let have person get kill deserve mischief bring penetrate retire citadel incalculable let tie hand foot have pleasure see tear piece full torchlight great hall

19,"""But,"" added the queen, bethinking herself, ""he is so troublesome. For as poor creatures as they are, there is something about those sun-people that is _very_ troublesome. I cannot imagine how it is that with such superior strength and skill and understanding as ours, we permit them to exist at all. Why do we not destroy them entirely, and use their cattle and grazing lands at our pleasure? Of course, we don't want to live in their horrid country! It is far too glaring for our quieter and more refined tastes. But we might use it for a sort of outhouse, you know. Even our creatures' eyes might get used to it, and if they did grow blind, that would be of no consequence, provided they grew fat as well. But we might even keep their great cows and other creatures, and then we should have a few more luxuries, such as cream and cheese, which at present we only taste occasionally, when our brave men have succeeded in carrying some off from their farms.""",add queen bethink troublesome poor creature be sun-people troublesome imagine such superior strength skill understanding permit exist destroy use cattle grazing land pleasure course want live horrid country glaring quiet refine taste use sort outhouse know creature eye use grow blind consequence provide grow fat keep great cow other creature have few more luxury such cream cheese present taste brave man succeed carry farm 
20,"""It is worth thinking of,"" said the king; ""and I don't know why you should be the first to suggest it, except that you have a positive genius for conquest. But still, as you say, there is something very troublesome about them; and it would be better, as I understand you to suggest, that we should starve him for a day or two first, so that he may be a little less frisky when we take him out.""",worth think say king know first suggest have positive genius conquest say be troublesome good understand suggest starve day little frisky take
