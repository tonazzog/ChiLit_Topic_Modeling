3,"It was quite a relief to us to breathe the pure air and to enjoy the glad sunshine after our long ramble in the Diamond Cave, as we named it; for, although we did not stay more than half an hour away, it seemed to us much longer.  While we were dressing, and during our walk home, we did our best to satisfy the curiosity of poor Peterkin, who seemed to regret, with lively sincerity, his inability to dive.",relief breathe pure air enjoy glad sunshine long ramble name stay more hour seem dress walk home do good satisfy curiosity poor seem regret lively sincerity inability dive 
4,"There was no help for it, however, so we condoled with him as we best could.  Had there been any great rise or fall in the tide of these seas, we might perhaps have found it possible to take him down with us at low water; but as the tide never rose or fell more than eighteen inches or two feet, this was impossible.",be help condole good be great rise fall tide sea find possible take low water tide rise fall more inch foot impossible 
5,"This peculiarity of the tide--its slight rise and fall--had not attracted our observation till some time after our residence on the island.  Neither had we observed another curious circumstance until we had been some time there.  This was the fact, that the tide rose and fell with constant regularity, instead of being affected by the changes of the moon as in our own country, and as it is in most other parts of the world,--at least in all those parts with which I am acquainted.  Every day and every night, at twelve o'clock precisely, the tide is at the full; and at six o'clock every morning and evening it is ebb.  I can speak with much confidence on this singular circumstance, as we took particular note of it, and never found it to alter.  Of course, I must admit, we had to guess the hour of twelve midnight, and I think we could do this pretty correctly; but in regard to twelve noon we are quite positive, because we easily found the highest point that the sun reached in the sky by placing ourselves at a certain spot whence we observed the sharp summit of a cliff resting against the sky, just where the sun passed.",peculiarity tide slight rise fall attract observation time residence island observe curious circumstance time fact tide rise fall constant regularity affect change moon own country most other part world least part acquainted day night o'clock tide full o'clock morning evening ebb speak much confidence singular circumstance take particular note find alter course admit have guess hour midnight think do regard noon positive find high point sun reach sky place certain spot observe sharp summit cliff rest sky sun pass 
6,"Jack and I were surprised that we had not noticed this the first few days of our residence here, and could only account for it by our being so much taken up with the more obvious wonders of our novel situation.  I have since learned, however, that this want of observation is a sad and very common infirmity of human nature, there being hundreds of persons before whose eyes the most wonderful things are passing every day, who nevertheless are totally ignorant of them.  I therefore have to record my sympathy with such persons, and to recommend to them a course of conduct which I have now for a long time myself adopted,--namely, the habit of forcing my attention upon _all_ things that go on around me, and of taking some degree of interest in them, whether I feel it naturally or not.  I suggest this the more earnestly, though humbly, because I have very frequently come to know that my indifference to a thing has generally been caused by my ignorance in regard to it.",surprise notice first few day residence account take obvious wonder novel situation learn want observation sad common infirmity human nature be hundred person eye wonderful thing pass day ignorant have record sympathy such person recommend course conduct have long time adopt habit force attention _all_ thing go take degree interest feel suggest come know indifference thing cause ignorance regard 
7,"We had much serious conversation on this subject of the tides; and Jack told us, in his own quiet, philosophical way, that these tides did great good to the world in many ways, particularly in the way of cleansing the shores of the land, and carrying off the filth that was constantly poured into the sea there-from; which, Peterkin suggested, was remarkably _tidy_ of it to do.  Poor Peterkin could never let slip an opportunity to joke, however inopportune it might be: which at first we found rather a disagreeable propensity, as it often interrupted the flow of very agreeable conversation; and, indeed, I cannot too strongly record my disapprobation of this tendency in general: but we became so used to it at last that we found it no interruption whatever; indeed, strange to say, we came to feel that it was a necessary part of our enjoyment (such is the force of habit), and found the sudden outbursts of mirth, resulting from his humorous disposition, quite natural and refreshing to us in the midst of our more serious conversations.  But I must not misrepresent Peterkin.  We often found, to our surprise, that he knew many things which we did not; and I also observed that those things which he learned from experience were never forgotten.  From all these things I came at length to understand that things very opposite and dissimilar in themselves, when united, do make an agreeable whole; as, for example, we three on this our island, although most unlike in many things, when united, made a trio so harmonious that I question if there ever met before such an agreeable triumvirate.  There was, indeed, no note of discord whatever in the symphony we played together on that sweet Coral Island; and I am now persuaded that this was owing to our having been all tuned to the same key, namely, that of _love_!  Yes, we loved one another with much fervency while we lived on that island; and, for the matter of that, we love each other still.",have much serious conversation subject tide tell own quiet philosophical way tide do great good world many way way cleanse shore land carry filth pour sea suggest _tidy_ do poor let slip opportunity joke inopportune find disagreeable propensity interrupt flow agreeable conversation record disapprobation tendency general become use last find interruption strange say come feel necessary part enjoyment such force habit find sudden outburst mirth result humorous disposition natural refresh midst serious conversation misrepresent find surprise know many thing observe thing learn experience forget thing come length understand thing opposite dissimilar unite make agreeable whole example island most many thing unite make trio harmonious question meet agreeable triumvirate be note discord symphony play sweet persuade ow tune same key love much fervency live island matter love other 
8,"And while I am on this subject, or rather the subject that just preceded it--namely, the tides--I may here remark on another curious natural phenomenon.  We found that there was little or no twilight in this island.  We had a distinct remembrance of the charming long twilight at home, which some people think the most delightful part of the day, though for my part I have always preferred sunrise; and when we first landed, we used to sit down on some rocky point or eminence, at the close of our day's work, to enjoy the evening breeze; but no sooner had the sun sunk below the horizon than all became suddenly dark.  This rendered it necessary that we should watch the sun when we happened to be out hunting, for to be suddenly left in the dark while in the woods was very perplexing, as, although the stars shone with great beauty and brilliancy, they could not pierce through the thick umbrageous boughs that interlaced above our heads.",subject subject precede tide remark curious natural phenomenon find be little twilight island have distinct remembrance charming long twilight home person think delightful part day part prefer sunrise land use sit rocky point eminence close day work enjoy evening breeze sun sink horizon become dark render necessary watch sun happen hunt leave dark wood perplexing star shine great beauty brilliancy pierce thick umbrageous bough interlace head 
9,"But, to return: After having told all we could to Peterkin about the Diamond Cave under Spouting Cliff, as we named the locality, we were wending our way rapidly homewards, when a grunt and a squeal were borne down by the land breeze to our ears.",return tell spout name locality wend way homeward grunt squeal borne land breeze ear 
10,"""That's the ticket!"" was Peterkin's remarkable exclamation, as he started convulsively, and levelled his spear.",ticket remarkable exclamation start levell spear 
11,"""Hist!"" cried Jack; ""these are your friends, Peterkin.  They must have come over expressly to pay you a friendly visit, for it is the first time we have seen them on this side the island.""",cry friend come pay friendly visit first time see side island 
12,"""Come along!"" cried Peterkin, hurrying towards the wood, while Jack and I followed, smiling at his impatience.",come cry hurry wood follow smile impatience 
13,"Another grunt and half a dozen squeals, much louder than before, came down the valley.  At this time we were just opposite the small vale which lay between the Valley of the Wreck and Spouting Cliff.",grunt squeal louder come valley time small vale lay spout 
14,"""I say, Peterkin,"" cried Jack, in a hoarse whisper.",say cry hoarse whisper 
15,"""Well, what is't?""",s't 
16,"""Stay a bit, man.  These grunters are just up there on the hill side.  If you go and stand with Ralph in the lee of yon cliff, I'll cut round behind and drive them through the gorge, so that you'll have a better chance of picking out a good one.  Now, mind you pitch into a fat young pig, Peterkin,"" added Jack, as he sprang into the bushes.",stay bit man grunter hill side go stand yon cliff cut drive gorge have good chance pick good one mind pitch fat young pig add spring bush 
17,"""Won't I, just!"" said Peterkin, licking his lips, as we took our station beside the cliff.  ""I feel quite a tender affection for young pigs in my heart.  Perhaps it would be more correct to say in my s--.""",say lick lip take station cliff feel tender affection young pig heart correct say 
18,"""There they come!"" cried I, as a terrific yell from Jack sent the whole herd screaming down the hill.  Now, Peterkin, being unable to hold back, crept a short way up a very steep grassy mound, in order to get a better view of the hogs before they came up; and just as he raised his head above its summit, two little pigs, which had outrun their companions, rushed over the top with the utmost precipitation.  One of these brushed close past Peterkin's ear; the other, unable to arrest its headlong flight, went, as Peterkin himself afterwards expressed it, ""bash"" into his arms with a sudden squeal, which was caused more by the force of the blow than the will of the animal, and both of them rolled violently down to the foot of the mound.  No sooner was this reached than the little pig recovered its feet, tossed up its tail, and fled shrieking from the spot. But I slang a large stone after it, which, being fortunately well aimed, hit it behind the ear, and felled it to the earth.",come cry terrific yell send whole herd scream hill unable hold creep short way steep grassy mound order get good view hog come raise head summit little pig outrun companion rush top utmost precipitation brush close ear other unable arrest headlong flight go express bash arm sudden squeal cause force blow will animal roll foot mound reach little pig recover foot toss tail flead shriek spot slang large stone aim hit ear fell earth 
19,"""Capital, Ralph! that's your sort!"" cried Peterkin, who, to my surprise and great relief, had risen to his feet.  Apparently unhurt, though much dishevelled, he rushed franticly towards the gorge, which the yells of the hogs told us they were now approaching.  I had made up my mind that I would abstain from killing another, as, if Peterkin should be successful, two were more than sufficient for our wants at the present time.  Suddenly they all burst forth,--two or three little round ones in advance, and an enormous old sow with a drove of hogs at her heels.",capital sort cry surprise great relief rise foot unhurt dishevelled rush gorge yell hog tell approach make mind abstain kill successful more sufficient want present time burst little round one advance enormous old sow drive hog heel 
20,"""Now, Peterkin,"" said I, ""there's a nice little fat one; just spear it.""",say be nice little fat one spear 
21,"But Peterkin did not move; he allowed it to pass unharmed.  I looked at him in surprise, and saw that his lips were compressed and his eyebrows knitted, as if he were about to fight with some awful enemy.",move allow pass unharmed look surprise see lip compress eyebrow knite about fight awful enemy 
22,"""What is it?"" I inquired, with some trepidation.",inquire trepidation 
23,"Suddenly he levelled his spear, darted forward, and, with a yell that nearly froze the blood in my veins, stabbed the old sow to the heart. Nay, so vigorously was it done that the spear went in at one side and came out at the other!",levell spear dart yell frize blood vein stab old sow heart do spear go side come other 
24,"""Oh, Peterkin!"" said I, going up to him, ""what have you done?""",say go do 
25,"""Done?  I've killed their great-great-grandmother, that's all,"" said he, looking with a somewhat awe-struck expression at the transfixed animal.",do kill great great grandmother say look awe strike expression transfixe animal 
26,"""Hallo! what's this?"" said Jack, as he came up.  ""Why, Peterkin, you must be fond of a tough chop.  If you mean to eat this old hog, she'll try your jaws, I warrant.  What possessed you to stick _her_, Peterkin?""",say come fond tough chop mean eat old hog try jaw warrant possess stick 
27,"""Why, the fact is I want a pair of shoes.""",fact want pair shoe 
28,"""What have your shoes to do with the old hog?' said I, smiling.",have shoe do old hog say smile 
29,"""My present shoes have certainly nothing to do with her,"" replied Peterkin; ""nevertheless she will have a good deal to do with my future shoes.  The fact is, when I saw you floor that pig so neatly, Ralph, it struck me that there was little use in killing another.  Then I remembered all at once that I had long wanted some leather or tough substance to make shoes of, and this old grandmother seemed so tough that I just made up my mind to stick her, and you see I've done it!""",present shoe have do reply have good deal do future shoe fact see floor pig strike be little use kill remember want leather tough substance make shoe old grandmother seem tough make mind stick see do 
30,"""That you certainly have, Peterkin,"" said Jack, as he was examining the transfixed animal.",have say examine transfixe animal 
31,"We now considered how we were to carry our game home, for, although the distance was short, the hog was very heavy.  At length we hit on the plan of tying its four feet together, and passing the spear handle between them.  Jack took one end on his shoulder, I took the other on mine, and Peterkin carried the small pig.",consider carry game home distance short hog heavy length hit plan tie foot pass spear handle take end shoulder take other carry small pig 
32,"Thus we returned in triumph to our bower, laden, as Peterkin remarked, with the glorious spoils of a noble hunt.  As he afterwards spoke in similarly glowing terms in reference to the supper that followed, there is every reason to believe that we retired that night to our leafy beds in a high state of satisfaction.",return triumph bower laden remark glorious spoil noble hunt speak glow term reference supper follow be reason believe retire night leafy bed high state satisfaction
