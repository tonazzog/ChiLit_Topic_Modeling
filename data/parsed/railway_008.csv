49,"Peter could not say that it was. Bobbie and Phyllis had been holding on to the railings above and skipping with anxiety. Now suddenly Bobbie slipped through the railings and rushed down the bank towards Peter, so impetuously that Phyllis, following more temperately, felt certain that her sister’s descent would end in the waters of the canal. And so it would have done if the Bargee hadn’t let go of Peter’s ear--and caught her in his jerseyed arm.",say hold railing skip anxiety slip railing rush bank follow feel certain sister descent end water canal do let go ear catch jerseyed arm

Bobbie was first--then came Peter, and it was Peter who slipped and fell. He went into the canal up to his neck, and his feet could not feel the bottom, but his arm was on the edge of the barge. Phyllis caught at his hair. It hurt, but it helped him to get out. Next minute he had leaped on to the barge, Phyllis following.",mooring rope slack little breeze strong feel strong drift stern bank first come slip fall go canal neck foot feel bottom arm edge barge catch hair hurt help get next minute leap barge follow

96,"He caught up with Bobbie at the cabin door, and flung her aside very roughly indeed; if they had been playing, such roughness would have made Bobbie weep with tears of rage and pain. Now, though he flung her on to the edge of the hold, so that her knee and her elbow were grazed and bruised, she only cried:--",catch cabin door flung play such roughness make weep tear rage pain flung edge hold knee elbow graze bruise cry

116,"There was a pleasant party of barge people round the fire. You might not have thought it pleasant, but they did; for they were all friends or acquaintances, and they liked the same sort of things, and talked the same sort of talk. This is the real secret of pleasant society. The Bargee Bill, whom the children had found so disagreeable, was considered excellent company by his mates. He was telling a tale of his own wrongs--always a thrilling subject.

Mr. Bill was as nice as anyone could possibly be. No one would have thought that he could be the same man who had held Peter by the ear.
