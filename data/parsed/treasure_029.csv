3,"""Block house, ahoy!"" it cried. ""Here's the doctor.""",block house cry doctor 
4,"And the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the sound, yet my gladness was not without admixture. I remembered with confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct, and when I saw where it had brought me--among what companions and surrounded by what dangers--I felt ashamed to look him in the face.",doctor glad hear sound gladness admixture remember confusion insubordinate stealthy conduct see bring companion surround danger feel ashamed look face

6,"""You, doctor! Top o' the morning to you, sir!"" cried Silver, broad awake and beaming with good nature in a moment. ""Bright and early, to be sure; and it's the early bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations. George, shake up your timbers, son, and help Dr. Livesey over the ship's side.

8,"""We've quite a surprise for you too, sir,"" he continued. ""We've a little stranger here--he! he!

12,"""Well, well,"" he said at last, ""duty first and pleasure afterwards, as you might have said yourself, Silver. Let us overhaul these patients of yours.""",say last duty first pleasure say let overhaul patient 
13,"A moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed under no apprehension, though he must have known that his life, among these treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet English family. His manner, I suppose, reacted on the men, for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurred, as if he were still ship's doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast.",moment enter block house grim nod proceed work sick seem apprehension know life treacherous demon depend hair rattle patient pay ordinary professional visit quiet english family manner suppose react man behave occur ship doctor faithful hand mast 
14,"""You're doing well, my friend,"" he said to the fellow with the bandaged head, ""and if ever any person had a close shave, it was you; your head must be as hard as iron.

16,"""Because, you see, since I am mutineers' doctor, or prison doctor as I prefer to call it,"" says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way, ""I make it a point of honour not to lose a man for King George (God bless him!) and the gallows.""",see mutineer doctor prison doctor prefer call say pleasantest way make point honour lose man bless gallow

20,"""Ah, there,"" said Morgan, ""that comed of sp'iling Bibles.""",say comed sp'iling 
21,"""That comes--as you call it--of being arrant asses,"" retorted the doctor, ""and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison, and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think it most probable--though of course it's only an opinion--that you'll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp in a bog, would you? Silver, I'm surprised at you. You're less of a fool than many, take you all round; but you don't appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health.",come call arrant ass retort doctor have sense know honest air poison dry land vile pestiferous slough think probable course opinion have deuce pay get malaria system camp bog silver surprise less fool many take appear have rudiment notion rule health 
22,"""Well,"" he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates--""well, that's done for today. And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy, please.""",add dose take prescription laughable humility charity schoolchild blood guilty mutineer pirate do today wish have talk boy 
23,And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.,nod head direction

26,"""Si-lence!"" he roared and looked about him positively like a lion. ""Doctor,"" he went on in his usual tones, ""I was a-thinking of that, knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy. We're all humbly grateful for your kindness, and as you see, puts faith in you and takes the drugs down like that much grog. And I take it I've found a way as'll suit all.

Good day to you, sir, and all our dooties to the squire and Cap'n Smollett.""",doctor say step stockade bring boy inside reckon yarn spar good day sir dooty squire 
29,"The explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver's black looks had restrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the house. Silver was roundly accused of playing double--of trying to make a separate peace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was doing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man the rest were, and his last night's victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds. He called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine, said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor, fluttered the chart in their faces, asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting.",explosion disapproval black look restrain break doctor leave house accuse play double try make separate peace sacrifice interest accomplice victim word identical exact thing do seem obvious case imagine turn anger man rest last night victory give huge preponderance mind call fool dolt imagine say necessary talk doctor flutter chart face ask afford break treaty very day bind treasure hunting

32,"""Slow, lad, slow,"" he said. ""They might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry.""",slow lad slow say round twinkle eye see hurry 
33,"Very deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped.",advance sand doctor await other side stockade easy speak distance stop 
34,"""You'll make a note of this here also, doctor,"" says he, ""and the boy'll tell you how I saved his life, and were deposed for it too, and you may lay to that. Doctor, when a man's steering as near the wind as me--playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body, like--you wouldn't think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word?

37,"""Doctor, I'm no coward; no, not I--not SO much!"" and he snapped his fingers. ""If I was I wouldn't say it. But I'll own up fairly, I've the shakes upon me for the gallows. You're a good man and a true; I never seen a better man! And you'll not forget what I done good, not any more than you'll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside--see here--and leave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that down for me too, for it's a long stretch, is that!""",doctor coward much snap finger say own shake gallow good man true see good man forget do good more forget bad know step see leave put long stretch 
38,"So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and the house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast.",say step little way earshot sit tree stump begin whistle spinn seat command sight doctor unruly ruffian go sand fire busy rekindle house bring pork bread make breakfast 
39,"""So, Jim,"" said the doctor sadly, ""here you are. As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy.

40,"I will own that I here began to weep. ""Doctor,"" I said, ""you might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is torture.

43,"""I know, I know,"" he cried. ""We can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here, I cannot let you. Jump! One jump, and you're out, and we'll run for it like antelopes.""",know know cry help take shoulder holus bolus blame shame boy stay let jump jump run antelope 
44,"""No,"" I replied; ""you know right well you wouldn't do the thing yourself--neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I. Silver trusted me; I passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor, you did not let me finish. If they come to torture me, I might let slip a word of where the ship is, for I got the ship, part by luck and part by risking, and she lies in North Inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high water. At half tide she must be high and dry.""",reply know do thing squire captain silver trust pass word go doctor let finish come torture let slip word ship get ship part luck part risk lie southern beach high water half tide high dry

47,"""There is a kind of fate in this,"" he observed when I had done. ""Every step, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my boy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!"" he cried. ""Silver! I'll give you a piece of advice,"" he continued as the cook drew near again; ""don't you be in any great hurry after that treasure.""",be kind fate observe do step save life suppose chance go let lose poor return boy find plot find good deed do do live talk mischief person silver cry silver give piece advice continue cook draw great hurry treasure

49,"""Well, Silver,"" replied the doctor, ""if that is so, I'll go one step further: look out for squalls when you find it.""",reply doctor go step look squall find 
50,"""Sir,"" said Silver, ""as between man and man, that's too much and too little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave the helm.""",say man man much little leave block house give chart know do bid eye shut word hope much tell mean plain say leave helm 
51,"""No,"" said the doctor musingly; ""I've no right to say more; it's not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you. But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken!

53,"""Well, that's my first concession,"" added the doctor. ""My second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.""",first concession add doctor second piece advice keep boy close need help seek show speak random good
