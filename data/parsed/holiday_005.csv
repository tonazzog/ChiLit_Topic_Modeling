4," Next day after the fire, Laura could think of nothing but what she was to do with the shilling that uncle David had given her; and a thousand plans came into her head, while many wants entered her thoughts, which never occurred before; so that, if twenty shillings had been in her hand instead of one, they would all have gone twenty different ways.",next day fire think do shilling uncle give plan come head many want enter thought occur shilling hand go different way 
5,"Lady Harriet advised that it should be laid bye till Laura had fully considered what she would like best; reminding her very truly, that money is lame in coming, but flies in going away.

6,"""Yes, Miss! so give it to me, and I shall take care of your shilling!"" added Mrs. Crabtree, holding out her hand to Laura, who fell that if her money once disappeared into that capacious pocket, she would never see it again. ""Children have no use for money! that shilling will only burn a hole in your purse, till it is spent on some foolish thing or other. You will be losing your thimble soon, or mislaying your gloves; for all these things seem to fly in every direction, as if they got legs and wings as soon as they belong to you; so then that shilling may replace what is lost.""",give take care shilling add hold hand fall money disappear capacious pocket see child have use money shilling burn hole purse spend foolish thing other lose thimble mislay glove thing seem fly direction get leg wing belong shilling replace lose

11,"Laura thought this plan so very unsatisfactory, that she lost no time in getting her shilling changed into two sixpences, one of which she immediately presented to Harry, who positively refused for a long time to accept of it, insisting that Laura should rather buy some pretty plaything for herself; but she answered that it was much pleasanter to divide her fortune with Harry, than to be selfish, and spend it all alone. ""I am sure, Harry,"" added she, ""if this money had been yours, you would have said the same thing, and given the half of what you got to me; so now let us say no more about that, but tell me what would be the best use to make of my sixpence?""",think plan unsatisfactory lose time get shilling change sixpence present refuse long time accept insist buy pretty plaything answer much pleasanter divide fortune selfish spend sure add money say same thing give half get let say more tell good use make sixpence

""Do you know, Laura, I once found out that you could have twelve of those large ship biscuits we saw at the baker's shop for sixpence. Only think! you could feed the whole town, and make a present to everybody in the house besides! I dare say Mrs. Crabtree might like one with her tea. All the maids would think them a treat.

""Keep all them rattle-traps till you are a rich nabob, and come home to look for Mrs. Frank,--a fine wife she will be!

44,"Some days after Laura had distributed the biscuits, she became very sorry for having squandered her shilling, without attending to Lady Harriet's good advice, about keeping it carefully in her pocket for at least a week, to see what would happen. A very pleasant way of using money now fell in her way, but she had been a foolish spendthrift, so her pockets were empty, when she most wished them to be full. Harry came that morning after breakfast into the nursery, looking in a great bustle, and whispering to Laura, ""What a pity your sixpence is gone! but as Mrs. Crabtree says, 'we cannot both eat our cake and have it!'""",day distribute biscuit become sorry squander shilling attend good advice keep pocket least week see happen pleasant way use money fall way foolish spendthrift pocket empty wish full come morning breakfast nursery look great bustle whisper pity sixpence gone say eat cake have

There will be about twenty boys and girls of the party, but every body is to carry a basket filled with provisions for dinner, either cakes, or fruit, or biscuits, which are to be eat on the great rock at the top of the hill.

51,"She then related the whole story of the party to Arthur's Seat, mentioning that Mr. Harwood had kindly offered to take charge of Harry and herself, but as her little fortune had been so foolishly squandered, she could not go, and Harry said it would be impossible to enjoy the fun without her, though Lady Harriet had given them both leave to be of the party.",relate whole story party mention offer take charge little fortune squander go say impossible enjoy fun give leave party 
52,"All the time that Laura spoke, Frank stood, with his hands in his pockets, where he seemed evidently searching for something, and when the whole history was told, he said to Harry, ""Let me see this poor little sixpence of yours!

55,"Frank ran joyously out of the room, being much amused with the joke, for he had put one of his own shillings into the box for Harry and Laura, who were excessively surprised at first, and felt really ashamed to take this very kind present from Frank, when he so seldom had money of his own; but they knew how generous he was, for he often repeated that excellent maxim, ""It is more blessed to give than to receive.""",run room amuse joke put own shilling box surprise first feel ashamed take kind present have money own know generous repeat excellent maxim bless give receive

60,"Mrs. Crabtree knew from experience, that Major Graham was a hopeless case, as he always took part with the children, and liked nothing so much for old and young as ""a ploy;"" so she grumbled on to herself, while her eyes looked as sharp as a pair of scissors with rage. ""You will come back, turned into scare-crows, with all your nice clean clothes in tatters,"" said she, angrily; ""but if there is so much as a speck upon this best new jacket and trowsers, I shall know the reason why.""",know experience hopeless case take part child like much old young ploy grumble eye look sharp pair scissors rage come turn scare crow nice clean clothes tatter say be much speck good new jacket trowser know reason

64,"About half an hour afterwards, Harry and Laura were seen hurrying out of the pastry-cook, Mrs. Weddell's shop, bearing little covered baskets in their hands, but nobody could guess what was in them. They whispered and laughed together with very merry faces, looking the very pictures of happiness, and running along as fast as they could to join the noisy party of their cousins and companions, almost fearing that Mr. Harwood might have set off without them. Frank often called him ""Mr. Punctuality,"" as he was so very particular about his scholars being in good time on all occasions; and certainly Mr. Harwood carried his watch more in his hand than in his pocket, being in the habit of constantly looking to see that nobody arrived too late. Mail-coaches or steamboats could hardly keep the time better, when an hour had once been named, and the last words that Harry heard when he was invited were, ""Remember! sharp twelve.""",hour see hurry pastry cook shop bear little cover basket hand guess whisper laugh merry face look very picture happiness run join noisy party cousin companion fear set call particular scholar good time occasion carry watch hand pocket habit look see arrive late mail coach steamboat keep time good hour name last word hear invite remember sharp

85,"Before long the whole party seated themselves in a circle on the grass round St. Anthony's Well, while any stranger who had chanced to pass might have supposed, from the noise and merriment, that the Saint had filled his well with champagne and punch for the occasion, as everybody seemed perfectly tipsy with happiness. Mr. Harwood laughed prodigiously at some of the jokes, and made a few of his own, which were none of the best, though they caused the most laughter, for the boys thought it very surprising that so grave and great a man should make a joke at all.",whole party seat circle grass stranger chance pass suppose noise merriment fill champagne punch occasion seem tipsy happiness laugh joke make few own good cause most laughter boy think surprising grave great man make joke 
86,"When Mary Forrester drank her thimbleful of water, and wished for a new doll, Peter and Harry privately cut out a face upon a red-cheeked apple, making the eyes, nose, and mouth, after which, they hastily dressed it up in pocket handkerchiefs, and gave her this present from the fairies, which looked so very like what she had asked for, that the laugh which followed was loud and long. Afterwards Peter swallowed his draught, calling loudly for a piebald pony, when Harry in his white trowsers, and dark jacket, went upon all-fours, and let Peter mount on his back. It was very difficult, however, to get Peter off again, for he enjoyed the fun excessively, and stuck to his seat like Sinbad's old man of the sea, till at last Harry rolled round on his back, tumbling Peter head over heels into St. Anthony's Well, upon seeing which, Mr. Harwood rose, saying, he had certainly lost his own wish, as they had behaved ill, and met with an accident already. Harry laughingly proposed that Peter should be carefully hung upon a tree to dry, till they all came down again; but the mischievous boy ran off so fast, he was almost out of sight in a moment, saying, ""Now for the top of Arthur's Seat, and I shall grow dry with the fatigue of climbing.""",drink thimbleful water wish new doll cut face red cheeked apple make eye nose mouth dress pocket handkerchief give present fairy look ask laugh follow loud long swallow draught call piebald pony white trowser dark jacket go four let mount back difficult get enjoy fun stick seat old man sea last roll back tumble head heel see rise say lose own wish behave ill meet accident propose hang tree dry come mischievous boy run sight moment say top grow dry fatigue climb 
87,"The boys and girls immediately scattered themselves all over the hill, getting on the best way they could, and trying who could scramble up fastest, but the grass was quite short, and as slippery as ice, therefore it became every moment more difficult to stand, and still more difficult to climb. The whole party began sliding whether they liked it or not, and staggered and tried to grasp the turf, but there was nothing to hold, while occasionally a shower of stones and gravel came down from Peter, who pretended they fell by accident.",boy girl scatter hill get good way try scramble fast grass short slippery ice become moment difficult stand difficult climb whole party begin slide like stagger try grasp turf be hold shower stone gravel come pretend fall accident 
88,"""Oh, Harry!"" cried Laura, panting for breath, while she looked both frightened and fatigued, ""If this were not a party of pleasure, I think we are sometimes quite as happy in our own gardens!

92,"Laura was delighted with this plan, which succeeded perfectly well, but they ascended rather slowly, as it was exceedingly fatiguing to Harry, who looked quite happy all the time to be of use, for he always felt glad when he could do any thing for anybody, more particularly for either Laura or Frank. Now, the whole party was at last safely assembled on the very highest point of Arthur's Seat, so the boys threw their caps up in the air, and gave three tremendous cheers, which frightened the very crows over their heads, and sent a flock of sheep scampering down the mountain side. After that, they planted Mr. Harwood's walking-stick in the ground, for a staff, while Harry tore off the blue silk handkerchief which Mrs. Crabtree had tied about his neck, and without caring whether he caught cold or not, he fastened it on the pole for a flag, being quite delighted to see how it waved in the wind most triumphantly, looking very like what sailors put up when they take possession of a desert island.",delighted plan succeed ascend fatiguing look happy time use feel glad do thing whole party last assemble very high point boy throw cap air give tremendous cheer frighten very crow head send flock sheep scamper mountain side plant walking stick ground staff tore blue silk handkerchief tie neck care catch cold fasten pole flag delighted see wave wind look sailor put take possession desert island 
93,"""Now, for business!"" said Mr. Harwood, sitting down on the rock, and uncovering a prodigious cake, nearly as large as a cheese, which he had taken the trouble to carry, with great difficulty, up the hill. ""I suppose nobody is hungry after our long walk! Let us see what all the baskets contain!""",business say sit rock uncover prodigious cake large cheese take trouble carry great difficulty hill suppose hungry long walk let see basket contain 
94,"Not a moment was lost in seating themselves on the grass, while the stores were displayed, amidst shouts of laughter and applause which generally followed whatever came forth. Sandwiches, or, as Peter Grey called them, ""savages;"" gingerbread, cakes, and fruit, all appeared in turn. Robert Fordyce brought a dozen of hard-boiled eggs, all dyed different colours, blue, green, pink, and yellow, but not one was white. Edmund Ashford produced a collection of very sour-looking apples, and Charles Forrester showed a number of little gooseberry tarts, but when it became time for Peter's basket to be opened, it contained nothing except a knife and fork to cut up whatever his companions would give him!",moment lose seating grass store display shout laughter applause follow come sandwich call savage gingerbread cake fruit appear turn bring hard boil egg dyed different colour blue green pink yellow white produce collection sour look apple show number little gooseberry tart become time basket open contain knife fork cut companion give

96,"""Or thrown down from the top of this precipice,"" added Harry, giving him a cake. ""I wonder you can look any of us in the face, Peter!""",throw top precipice add give cake wonder look face 
97,"""I have heard,"" said Mr. Harwood, ""that a stone is shown in Ireland, called 'the stone of Blarney,' and whoever kisses it, is never afterwards ashamed of any thing he does. Our friend Peter has probably passed that way lately!""",hear say stone show call stone kisse ashamed thing friend pass way 
98,"""At any rate, I am not likely to be starved to death amongst you all!"" answered the impudent boy, demolishing every thing he could get; and it is believed that Peter ate, on this memorable occasion, three times more than any other person, as each of the party offered him something, and he never was heard to say, ""No!""",rate likely starve death answer impudent boy demolish thing get believe eat memorable occasion time more other person party offer hear say 
99,"""I could swallow Arthur's Seat if it were turned into a plum-pudding,"" said he, pocketing buns, apples, eggs, walnuts, biscuits, and almonds, till his coat stuck out all round like a balloon. ""Has any one any thing more to spare?""",swallow turn plum pudding say pocket bun apple egg walnut biscuit almond coat stick balloon one thing more spare 
100,"""Did you ever hear,"" said Mr. Harwood, ""that a pigeon eats its own weight of food every day? Now, I am sure, you and I know one boy in the world, Peter, who could do as much.""",hear say pigeon eat own weight food day sure know boy world do much 
101,"""What is to be done with that prodigious cake you carried up here, Mr. Harwood?"" answered Peter, casting a devouring eye upon it; ""the crust seems as hard as a rhinoceros' skin, but I dare say it is very good. One could not be sure though, without tasting it! I hope you are not going to take the trouble of carrying that heavy load back again?""",do prodigious cake carry answer cast devour eye crust seem hard rhinocero skin say good sure taste hope go take trouble carry heavy load 
102,"""How very polite you are become all on a sudden, Peter!"" said Laura, laughing. ""I should be very sorry to attempt carrying that cake to the bottom of the hill, for we would both roll down, the shortest way, together.""",polite become sudden say laugh sorry attempt carry cake bottom hill roll short way 
103,"""I am not over-anxious to try it either,"" observed Charles Forrester, shaking his head. ""Even Peter, though his mouth is constantly ajar, would find that cake rather heavy to carry, either as an inside or an outside passenger.""",anxious try observe shake head mouth ajar find cake heavy carry inside outside passenger 
104,"""I can scarcely lift it at all!"" continued Laura, when Mr. Harwood had again tied it up in the towel; ""what can be done?""",lift continue tie towel do 
105,"""Here is the very best plan!"" cried Harry, suddenly seizing the prodigious cake; and before any body could hinder him, he gave it a tremendous push off the steepest part of Arthur's Seat, so that it rolled down like a wheel, over stones and precipices, jumping and hopping along with wonderful rapidity, amidst the cheers and laughter of all the children, till at last it reached the bottom of the hill, when a general clapping of hands ensued.",good plan cry seize prodigious cake body hinder give tremendous push steepest part roll wheel stone precipice jump hopping wonderful rapidity cheer laughter child last reach bottom hill general clap hand ensue 
106,"""Now for a race!"" cried Harry, becoming more and more eager. ""The first boy or girl who reaches that cake shall have it all to himself!""",race cry become eager first boy girl reach cake have 
107,"Mr. Harwood tried with all his might to stop the commotion, and called out that they must go quietly down the bank, for Harry had no right to give away the cake, or to make them break their legs and arms with racing down such a hill: but he might as well have spoken to an east wind, and asked it not to blow. The whole party dispersed, like a hive of bees that has been upset; and in a moment they were in full career after the cake.",try stop commotion call go bank have right give cake make break leg arm racing hill speak east wind ask blow whole party disperse hive bee upset moment full career cake 
108,"Some of the boys tried to roll down, hoping to get on more quickly. Others endeavoured to slide, and several attempted to run, but they all fell; and many of them might have been tumblers at Sadler's Wells, they tumbled over and over so cleverly. Peter Grey's hat was blown away, but he did not stop to catch it. Charlie Hume lost his shoe, Robert Fordyce sprained his ancle, and every one of the girls tore her frock. It was a frightful scene; such devastation of bonnets and jackets as had never been known before; while Mr. Harwood looked like the General of a defeated army, calling till he became hoarse, and running till he was out of breath, vainly trying thus to stop the confusion, and to bring the stragglers back in better order.",boy try roll hope get other endeavour slide several attempt run fall many tumbler tumble hat blow stop catch lose shoe sprain ancle girl tore frock frightful scene such devastation bonnet jacket know look defeat army call become hoarse run breath try stop confusion bring straggler good order 
109,"Meantime, Harry and Peter were far before the rest, though Edward Ashford was following hard after them in desperate haste, as if he still hoped to overtake their steps. Suddenly, however, a loud cry of distress was heard over-head; and when Harry looked up, he saw so very alarming a sight, that he could scarcely believe his eyes, and almost screamed out himself with the fright it gave him, while he seemed to forget in a moment, the race, Peter Grey, and the prodigious cake.",rest follow desperate haste hope overtake step loud cry distress hear head look see alarm sight believe eye scream fright give seem forget moment race prodigious cake 
110,"Laura had been very anxious not to trouble Harry with taking care of her in coming down the bank again; for she saw that during all this fun about the cake, he perfectly forgot that she was not accustomed every day to such a scramble on the hills, and would have required some help. After looking down every side of the descent, and thinking that each appeared steeper than another, while they all made her equally giddy, Laura determined to venture on a part of the hill which seemed rather less precipitous than the rest; but it completely cheated her, being the most difficult and dangerous part of Arthur's Seat. The slope became steeper and steeper at every step; but Laura always tried to hope her path might grow better, till at last she reached a place where it was impossible to stop herself. Down she went, down! down! whether she would or not, screaming and sliding on a long slippery bank, till she reached the very edge of a dangerous precipice, which appeared higher than the side of a room. Laura then grappled hold of some stones and grass, calling loudly for help, while scarcely able to keep from falling into the deep ravine, which would probably have killed her. Her screams were echoed all over the hill, when Harry seeing her frightful situation, clambered up the bank faster than any lamplighter, and immediately flew to Laura's assistance, who was now really hanging over the chasm, quite unable to help herself. At last he reached the place where poor Laura lay, and seized hold of her by the frock; but for some time it seemed an equal chance whether she dragged him into the hole, or he pulled her away from it. Luckily, however, by a great effort, Harry succeeded in delivering Laura, whom he placed upon a secure situation, and then, having waited patiently till she recovered from the fright, he led her carefully and kindly down to the bottom of Arthur's Seat.",anxious trouble take care come bank see fun cake forget accustom day scramble hill require help look side descent think appear steeper make giddy determine venture part hill seem precipitous rest cheat difficult dangerous part slope become steeper steeper step try hope path grow good last reach place impossible stop go scream slide long slippery bank reach very edge dangerous precipice appear high side room grapple hold stone grass call help able keep fall deep ravine kill scream echoe hill see frightful situation clamber bank fast lamplighter fly assistance hang chasm unable help last reach place poor lay seize hold frock time seem equal chance drag hole pull great effort succeed deliver place secure situation wait recover fright lead bottom 
111,"Now, all the boys had already got there, and a violent dispute was going on about which of them first reached the cake. Peter Grey had pushed down Edward Ashford, who caught hold of Robert Fordyce, and they all three rolled to the bottom together, so that nobody could tell which had won the race; while Mr. Harwood laboured in vain to convince them that the cake belonged neither to the one nor the other, being his own property.",boy get violent dispute go reach cake push catch hold roll bottom tell win race laboure vain convince cake belong one other own property 
112,"They all laughed at Harry for being distanced, and arriving last; while Mr. Harwood watched him coming down, and was pleased to observe how carefully he attended to Laura, though still, being annoyed at the riot and confusion which Harry had occasioned, he determined to appear exceedingly angry, and put on a very terrible voice, saying,",laugh distance arrive last watch come pleased observe attend annoy riot confusion occasion determine appear angry put terrible voice say 
113,"""Hollo! young gentleman! what shall I do to you for beginning this uproar? As the old proverb says, 'one fool makes many.' How dare you roll my fine cake down the hill in this way, and send everybody rolling after it? Look me in the face, and say you are ashamed of yourself!""",young gentleman do begin uproar old proverb say fool make many roll fine cake hill way send roll look face say ashamed 
114,"Harry looked at Mr. Harwood--and Mr. Harwood looked at Harry. They both tried to seem very grave and serious, but somehow Harry's eyes glittered very brightly, and two little dimples might be seen in his cheeks. Mr. Harwood also had his eye-brows gathered into a terrible frown, but still his eyes were likewise sparkling, and his mouth seemed to be pursed up in a most comical manner. After staring at each other for several minutes, both Mr. Harwood and Harry burst into a prodigious fit of laughing, and nobody could tell which began first or laughed longest.",look look try seem grave serious eye glitter little dimple see cheek have eye brow gather terrible frown eye sparkling mouth seem purse comical manner stare other several minute burst prodigious fit laugh tell begin laugh long 
115,"""Master Graham! you must send a new frock to every little girl of the party, and a suit of clothes to each of the boys, for having caused theirs to be all destroyed. I really meant to punish you severely for beginning such a riot, but something has made me change my mind.
