3,"Now we must go back to the first tale. When Mowgli left the wolf’s cave after the fight with the Pack at the Council Rock, he went down to the plowed lands where the villagers lived, but he would not stop there because it was too near to the jungle, and he knew that he had made at least one bad enemy at the Council. So he hurried on, keeping to the rough road that ran down the valley, and followed it at a steady jog-trot for nearly twenty miles, till he came to a country that he did not know. The valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with rocks and cut up by ravines. At one end stood a little village, and at the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds, and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe. All over the plain, cattle and buffaloes were grazing, and when the little boys in charge of the herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the yellow pariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked. Mowgli walked on, for he was feeling hungry, and when he came to the village gate he saw the big thorn-bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight, pushed to one side.",go first tale leave wolf cave fight go plow land villager live stop jungle know make least bad enemy hurry keep rough road run valley follow steady jog trot mile come country know valley open great plain dot rock cut ravine end stand little village other thick jungle come sweep grazing grounds stop cut hoe plain cattle buffaloe graze little boy charge herd see shout run yellow pariah dog hang indian village bark walk feel hungry come village gate see big thorn bush draw gate twilight push side 
4,"“Umph!” he said, for he had come across more than one such barricade in his night rambles after things to eat. “So men are afraid of the People of the Jungle here also.” He sat down by the gate, and when a man came out he stood up, opened his mouth, and pointed down it to show that he wanted food. The man stared, and ran back up the one street of the village shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in white, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead. The priest came to the gate, and with him at least a hundred people, who stared and talked and shouted and pointed at Mowgli.",say come more such barricade night ramble thing eat man afraid sit gate man come stand open mouth point show want food man stare run street village shouting priest big fat man dress white red yellow mark forehead priest come gate least person stare talk shout point 
5,"“They have no manners, these Men Folk,” said Mowgli to himself. “Only the gray ape would behave as they do.” So he threw back his long hair and frowned at the crowd.",have manners say gray ape behave do throw long hair frown crowd 
6,“What is there to be afraid of?” said the priest. “Look at the marks on his arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He is but a wolf-child run away from the jungle.”,be afraid say priest look mark arm leg bite wolf wolf child run jungle 
7,"Of course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli harder than they intended, and there were white scars all over his arms and legs. But he would have been the last person in the world to call these bites, for he knew what real biting meant.",course play cub nip hard intend be white scar arm leg last person world call bite know real biting mean

10,"The priest was a clever man, and he knew that Messua was wife to the richest villager in the place. So he looked up at the sky for a minute and said solemnly: “What the jungle has taken the jungle has restored. Take the boy into thy house, my sister, and forget not to honor the priest who sees so far into the lives of men.”",priest clever man know wife rich villager place look sky minute say jungle take jungle restore take boy house sister forget honor priest see life man

12,"The crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her hut, where there was a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain chest with funny raised patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a Hindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking glass, such as they sell at the country fairs.",crowd part woman beckon hut be red lacquer bedstead great earthen grain chest funny raise pattern copper cooking pot image hindu god little alcove wall real look glass such sell country fair 
13,"She gave him a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she laid her hand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought perhaps that he might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had taken him. So she said, “Nathoo, O Nathoo!” Mowgli did not show that he knew the name. “Dost thou not remember the day when I gave thee thy new shoes?” She touched his foot, and it was almost as hard as horn. “No,”  she said sorrowfully, “those feet have never worn shoes, but thou art very like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be my son.”",give long drink milk bread lay hand head look eye think real son come jungle tiger take say show know name remember day give new shoe touch foot hard horn say foot wear shoe art son 
14,"Mowgli was uneasy, because he had never been under a roof before. But as he looked at the thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time if he wanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings. “What is the good of a man,” he said to himself at last, “if he does not understand man’s talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the jungle. I must speak their talk.”",uneasy roof look thatch see tear time want get window have fastening good man say last understand man talk silly dumb man jungle speak talk 
15,"It was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little wild pig. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate it almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the names of many things in the hut.",fun learn wolf imitate challenge buck jungle grunt little wild pig pronounce word imitate dark learn name many thing hut 
16,"There was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and when they shut the door he went through the window. “Give him his will,” said Messua’s husband. “Remember he can never till now have slept on a bed. If he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away.”",be difficulty bedtime sleep look panther trap hut shut door go window give will say husband remember till sleep bed send place son run

24,"“And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men, Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When I come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge of the grazing-ground.”",cast pack man man little talk talk frog pond come wait bamboo edge grazing ground 
25,"For three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village gate, he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he had to wear a cloth round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had to learn about money, which he did not in the least understand, and about plowing, of which he did not see the use. Then the little children in the village made him very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had taught him to keep his temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on keeping your temper; but when they made fun of him because he would not play games or fly kites, or because he mispronounced some word, only the knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him from picking them up and breaking them in two.",month night leave village gate busy learn way custom man have wear cloth annoy have learn money least understand plow see use little child village make angry teach keep temper jungle life food depend keep temper make fun play game fly kite mispronounce word knowledge unsportsmanlike kill little naked cub keep pick break

27,"And Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes between man and man. When the potter’s donkey slipped in the clay pit, Mowgli hauled it out by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for their journey to the market at Khanhiwara. That was very shocking, too, for the potter is a low-caste man, and his donkey is worse. When the priest scolded him, Mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too, and the priest told Messua’s husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as soon as possible; and the village head-man told Mowgli that he would have to go out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they grazed. No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he had been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great fig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and the barber, who knew all the gossip of the village, and old Buldeo, the village hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys sat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the platform where a cobra lived, and he had his little platter of milk every night because he was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree and talked, and pulled at the big huqas (the water-pipes) till far into the night. They told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts; and Buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the jungle, till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged out of their heads. Most of the tales were about animals, for the jungle was always at their door. The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops, and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight, within sight of the village gates.",have faintest idea difference caste make man man potter donkey slip clay pit haul tail help stack pot journey market shocking potter low caste man donkey bad priest scold threaten put donkey priest tell husband set work possible village head man tell have go buffaloe next day herd graze pleased night appoint servant village go circle meet evening masonry platform great fig tree village club head man watchman barber know gossip village old village hunter have tower musket meet smoke monkey sit talk upper branch be hole platform cobra live have little platter milk night sacred old man sit tree talk pull big huqa water pipe night tell wonderful tale god man ghost tell wonderful one way beast jungle eye child sit circle bulg head most tale animal jungle door deer wild pig grubb crop tiger carry man twilight sight village gate 
28,"Mowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of, had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo, the Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful story to another, and Mowgli’s shoulders shook.",know talk have cover face show laugh musket knee climb wonderful story shoulder shake 
29,"Buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messua’s son was a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked, old money-lender, who had died some years ago. “And I know that this is true,” he said, “because Purun Dass always limped from the blow that he got in a riot when his account books were burned, and the tiger that I speak of he limps, too, for the tracks of his pads are unequal.”",explain tiger carry son ghost tiger body inhabit ghost wicked old money lender die year know true say limp blow get riot account book burn tiger speak limp track pad unequal

31,"“Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?” said Mowgli. “That tiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows.

33,"“Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?” said Buldeo. “If thou art so wise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set a hundred rupees on his life. Better still, talk not when thy elders speak.”",jungle brat say art wise bring hide set rupee life talk elder speak 
34,"Mowgli rose to go. “All the evening I have lain here listening,” he called back over his shoulder, “and, except once or twice, Buldeo has not said one word of truth concerning the jungle, which is at his very doors. How, then, shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods and goblins which he says he has seen?”",rise go evening lain listen call shoulder say word truth concern jungle very door believe tale ghost god goblin say see 
35,"“It is full time that boy went to herding,” said the head-man, while Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli’s impertinence.",full time boy go herding say head man puff snort impertinence 
36,"The custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring them back at night. The very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that hardly come up to their noses. So long as the boys keep with the herds they are safe, for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle. But if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards, they are sometimes carried off. Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting on the back of Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes, with their long, backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their byres, one by one, and followed him, and Mowgli made it very clear to the children with him that he was the master. He beat the buffaloes with a long, polished bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze the cattle by themselves, while he went on with the buffaloes, and to be very careful not to stray away from the herd.",custom most indian village few boy take cattle buffaloe graze early morning bring night very cattle trample white man death allow bang bull shout child come nose boy keep herd safe tiger charge mob cattle straggle pick flower hunt lizard carry go village street dawn sit back great herd bull slaty blue buffaloe long backward sweep horn savage eye rise byre follow make clear child master beat buffaloe long polished bamboo tell boy graze cattle go buffaloe careful stray herd 
37,"An Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little ravines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes generally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing or basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on to the edge of the plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he dropped from Rama’s neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother. “Ah,” said Gray Brother, “I have waited here very many days. What is the meaning of this cattle-herding work?”",indian grazing ground rock scrub tussock little ravine herd scatter disappear buffaloe keep pool muddy place lie wallow bask warm mud hour drive edge plain come jungle drop neck trotet bamboo clump find gray say gray wait many day meaning cattle herding work

40,"“Very good,” said Mowgli. “So long as he is away do thou or one of the four brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of the village. When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak tree in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khan’s mouth.”",good say brother sit rock see come village come wait ravine dhak tree center plain walk mouth 
41,"Then Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while the buffaloes grazed round him. Herding in India is one of the laziest things in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move on again, and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes very seldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after another, and work their way into the mud till only their noses and staring china-blue eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like logs. The sun makes the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children hear one kite (never any more) whistling almost out of sight overhead, and they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep down, and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow, and the next, and the next, and almost before they were dead there would be a score of hungry kites come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and wake and sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and put grasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight; or string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard basking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they sing long, long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and the day seems longer than most people’s whole lives, and perhaps they make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and put reeds into the men’s hands, and pretend that they are kings and the figures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped. Then evening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up out of the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other, and they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village lights.",pick shady place lay sleep buffaloe graze herd lazy thing world cattle move crunch lie move low grunt buffaloe say get muddy pool work way mud nose stare china blue eye show surface lie log sun make rock dance heat herd child hear kite more whistle sight know die cow die kite sweep next kite mile see drop follow next next dead score hungry kite come sleep wake sleep weave little basket dry grass put grasshopper catch praying mantise make fight string necklace red black jungle nut watch lizard bask rock snake hunt frog wallow sing long long song odd native quaver end day seem long most person whole life make mud castle mud figure man horse buffaloe put reed man hand pretend king figure army god worship evening come child call buffaloe lumber sticky mud noise gunshot go other string gray plain twinkle village light 
42,"Day after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows, and day after day he would see Gray Brother’s back a mile and a half away across the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back), and day after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him, and dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would have heard him in those long, still mornings.",day day lead buffaloe wallow day day see gray mile half plain know come day day lie grass listen noise dreaming old day jungle make false step lame paw jungle hear long morning 
43,"At last a day came when he did not see Gray Brother at the signal place, and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree, which was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother, every bristle on his back lifted.",last day come see gray signal place laugh head buffaloe ravine dhk tree cover golden red flower sit gray bristle back lift

52,"“Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.” Gray Brother trotted off and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray head that Mowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry of all the jungle--the hunting howl of a wolf at midday.",bring wise helper trotet drop hole lift huge gray head know hot air fill desolate cry jungle hunting howl wolf midday 
53,"“Akela! Akela!” said Mowgli, clapping his hands. “I might have known that thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand. Cut the herd in two, Akela.

In one, the cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the center, and glared and pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge down and trample the life out of him. In the other, the bulls and the young bulls snorted and stamped, but though they looked more imposing they were much less dangerous, for they had no calves to protect. No six men could have divided the herd so neatly.",wolf run lady chain fashion herd snort throw head separate clump cow buffaloe stand calve center glare paw ready wolf stay charge trample life other bull young bull snort stamp look impose dangerous have calve protect man divide herd

63,"But Mowgli’s plan was simple enough. All he wanted to do was to make a big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take the bulls down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the cows; for he knew that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan would not be in any condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine. He was soothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had dropped far to the rear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a long, long circle, for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and give Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to the ravine itself. From that height you could see across the tops of the trees down to the plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides of the ravine, and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they ran nearly straight up and down, while the vines and creepers that hung over them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out.",plan simple want do make big circle get head ravine take bull catch bull cow know meal full drink condition fight clamber side ravine soothing buffaloe voice drop rear whimper hurry rear guard long long circle wish get ravine give warning last round bewilder herd head ravine grassy patch slope ravine height see top tree plain look side ravine see great deal satisfaction run vine creeper hang give foothold tiger want get

70,"“Ha! Ha!” said Mowgli, on his back. “Now thou knowest!” and the torrent of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime; the weaker buffaloes being shouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the creepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand. Shere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself up, and lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of escape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on, heavy with his dinner and his drink, willing to do anything rather than fight. The herd splashed through the pool he had just left, bellowing till the narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot of the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the worst came to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their calves), and then Rama tripped, stumbled, and went on again over something soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the other herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet by the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the plain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and slipped off Rama’s neck, laying about him right and left with his stick.",say back torrent black horn foaming muzzle stare eye whirl ravine boulder go floodtime weak buffaloe shoulder side ravine tore creeper know business terrible charge herd tiger hope stand hear thunder hoof pick lumber ravine look side side way escape wall ravine straight have hold heavy dinner drink willing do fight herd splash pool leave bellow narrow cut ring hear answer bellow foot ravine see turn tiger know bad come bad good meet bull cow calve trip stumble go soft bull heel crash full other herd weak buffaloe lift clean foot shock meeting charge carry herd plain gore stamp snort watch time slip neck lay leave stick

75,"A boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot tiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal’s skin is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was hard work, and Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves lolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he ordered them. Presently a hand fell on his shoulder, and looking up he saw Buldeo with the Tower musket. The children had told the village about the buffalo stampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct Mowgli for not taking better care of the herd. The wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw the man coming.",boy train man dream skinn foot tiger know good else animal skin fit take hard work slash tore grunt hour wolf loll tongue come tug order hand fall shoulder look see musket child tell village buffalo stampede go anxious correct take good care herd wolf drop sight see man come

Well, well, we will overlook thy letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee one of the rupees of the reward when I have taken the skin to Khanhiwara.”  He fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel, and stooped down to singe Shere Khan’s whiskers.

82,"To do Buldeo justice, if he had been ten years younger he would have taken his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in the woods, but a wolf who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating tigers was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the worst kind, thought Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would protect him. He lay as still as still, expecting every minute to see Mowgli turn into a tiger too.",do justice year young take chance meet wolf wood wolf obey order boy have private war man-eating tiger common animal sorcery magic bad kind think wonder amulet neck protect lay expect minute see turn tiger

But they came to the Council Rock, all that were left of them, and saw Shere Khan’s striped hide on the rock, and the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet.
