1,CHAPTER IV. NORTH WIND,
2," AND as she stood looking towards London, Diamond saw that she was trembling.",stand look see tremble 
3,"“Are you cold, North Wind?” he asked.",cold ask 
4,"“No, Diamond,” she answered, looking down upon him with a smile; “I am only getting ready to sweep one of my rooms. Those careless, greedy, untidy children make it in such a mess.”",answer look smile get ready sweep room careless greedy untidy child make mess 
5,"As she spoke he could have told by her voice, if he had not seen with his eyes, that she was growing larger and larger. Her head went up and up towards the stars; and as she grew, still trembling through all her body, her hair also grew--longer and longer, and lifted itself from her head, and went out in black waves. The next moment, however, it fell back around her, and she grew less and less till she was only a tall woman. Then she put her hands behind her head, and gathered some of her hair, and began weaving and knotting it together. When she had done, she bent down her beautiful face close to his, and said--",speak tell voice see eye grow large large head go star grow tremble body hair grow long lift head go black wave next moment fall grow less less tall woman put hand head gather hair begin weave knot do bend beautiful face close say 
6,"“Diamond, I am afraid you would not keep hold of me, and if I were to drop you, I don’t know what might happen; so I have been making a place for you in my hair. Come.”",afraid keep hold drop know happen make place hair come 
7,"Diamond held out his arms, for with that grand face looking at him, he believed like a baby. She took him in her hands, threw him over her shoulder, and said, “Get in, Diamond.”",hold arm grand face look believe baby take hand throw shoulder say get 
8,"And Diamond parted her hair with his hands, crept between, and feeling about soon found the woven nest. It was just like a pocket, or like the shawl in which gipsy women carry their children. North Wind put her hands to her back, felt all about the nest, and finding it safe, said--",part hair hand creep feel find wove nest pocket shawl gipsy woman carry child put hand back feel nest find safe say 
9,"“Are you comfortable, Diamond?”",comfortable 
10,"“Yes, indeed,” answered Diamond.",answer 
11,"The next moment he was rising in the air. North Wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds. Her hair went streaming out from her, till it spread like a mist over the stars. She flung herself abroad in space.",next moment rise air grow tower place cloud hair go stream spread mist star flung space 
12,"Diamond held on by two of the twisted ropes which, parted and interwoven, formed his shelter, for he could not help being a little afraid. As soon as he had come to himself, he peeped through the woven meshes, for he did not dare to look over the top of the nest. The earth was rushing past like a river or a sea below him. Trees and water and green grass hurried away beneath. A great roar of wild animals rose as they rushed over the Zoological Gardens, mixed with a chattering of monkeys and a screaming of birds; but it died away in a moment behind them. And now there was nothing but the roofs of houses, sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks. Chimney-pots fell, and tiles flew from the roofs; but it looked to him as if they were left behind by the roofs and the chimneys as they scudded away. There was a great roaring, for the wind was dashing against London like a sea; but at North Wind’s back Diamond, of course, felt nothing of it all. He was in a perfect calm. He could hear the sound of it, that was all.",hold twisted rope part interwoven form shelter help little afraid come peep wove meshe dare look top nest earth rush river sea tree water green grass hurry great roar wild animal rise rush zoological mix chattering monkey scream bird die moment be roof house sweep great torrent stone rock chimney pot fall tile fly roof look leave roof chimney scudd be great roaring wind dash sea course feel perfect calm hear sound 
13,"By and by he raised himself and looked over the edge of his nest. There were the houses rushing up and shooting away below him, like a fierce torrent of rocks instead of water. Then he looked up to the sky, but could see no stars; they were hidden by the blinding masses of the lady’s hair which swept between. He began to wonder whether she would hear him if he spoke. He would try.",raise look edge nest be house rush shoot fierce torrent rock water look sky see star hide blind mass lady hair sweep begin wonder hear speak try 
14,"“Please, North Wind,” he said, “what is that noise?”",say noise 
15,"From high over his head came the voice of North Wind, answering him, gently--",high head come voice answer 
16,“The noise of my besom. I am the old woman that sweeps the cobwebs from the sky; only I’m busy with the floor now.”,noise besom old woman sweep cobweb sky busy floor

18,“I am sweeping so fast over them.”,sweep

27,"“Oh! I forgot,” said Diamond, and was quiet after that, for he did not want to be troublesome.",forget say quiet want troublesome 
28,"But she dropped a little towards the roofs of the houses, and Diamond could see down into the streets. There were very few people about, though. The lamps flickered and flared again, but nobody seemed to want them.",drop little roof house see street be few person lamp flicker flare seem want 
29,"Suddenly Diamond espied a little girl coming along a street. She was dreadfully blown by the wind, and a broom she was trailing behind her was very troublesome. It seemed as if the wind had a spite at her--it kept worrying her like a wild beast, and tearing at her rags. She was so lonely there!",espy little girl come street blow wind broom trail troublesome seem wind have spite keep worry wild beast tear rag lonely 
30,"“Oh! please, North Wind,” he cried, “won’t you help that little girl?”",cry help little girl

36,“But I don’t see why I should be kinder used than she.”,see kind use 
37,"“Do you think nothing’s to be done but what you can see, Diamond, you silly! It’s all right. Of course you can help her if you like. You’ve got nothing particular to do at this moment; I have.”",think do see silly right course help like get particular do moment have 
38,"“Oh! do let me help her, then. But you won’t be able to wait, perhaps?”",let help able wait 
39,"“No, I can’t wait; you must do it yourself. And, mind, the wind will get a hold of you, too.”",wait do mind wind get hold 
40,"“Don’t you want me to help her, North Wind?”",want help 
41,"“Not without having some idea what will happen. If you break down and cry, that won’t be much of a help to her, and it will make a goose of little Diamond.”",have idea happen break cry much help make goose little 
42,"“I want to go,” said Diamond. “Only there’s just one thing--how am I to get home?”",want go say be thing get 
43,"“If you’re anxious about that, perhaps you had better go with me. I am bound to take you home again, if you do.”",anxious good go bound take 
44,"“There!” cried Diamond, who was still looking after the little girl. “I’m sure the wind will blow her over, and perhaps kill her. Do let me go.”",cry look little girl sure wind blow kill let go 
45,They had been sweeping more slowly along the line of the street. There was a lull in the roaring.,sweep line street be lull roaring 
46,"“Well, though I cannot promise to take you home,” said North Wind, as she sank nearer and nearer to the tops of the houses, “I can promise you it will be all right in the end. You will get home somehow. Have you made up your mind what to do?”",promise take say sink top house promise end get make mind do 
47,"“Yes; to help the little girl,” said Diamond firmly.",help little girl say 
48,"The same moment North Wind dropt into the street and stood, only a tall lady, but with her hair flying up over the housetops. She put her hands to her back, took Diamond, and set him down in the street. The same moment he was caught in the fierce coils of the blast, and all but blown away. North Wind stepped back a step, and at once towered in stature to the height of the houses. A chimney-pot clashed at Diamond’s feet. He turned in terror, but it was to look for the little girl, and when he turned again the lady had vanished, and the wind was roaring along the street as if it had been the bed of an invisible torrent. The little girl was scudding before the blast, her hair flying too, and behind her she dragged her broom. Her little legs were going as fast as ever they could to keep her from falling. Diamond crept into the shelter of a doorway, thinking to stop her; but she passed him like a bird, crying gently and pitifully.",same moment dript street stand tall lady hair fly housetop put hand back take set street same moment catch fierce coil blast blow step step tower stature height house chimney pot clash foot turn terror look little girl turn lady vanish wind roar street bed invisible torrent little girl scudd blast hair fly drag broom little leg go keep fall creep shelter doorway think stop pass bird cry

50,"“I can’t,” wailed the girl, “the wind won’t leave go of me.”",wail girl wind leave go 
51,"Diamond could run faster than she, and he had no broom. In a few moments he had caught her by the frock, but it tore in his hand, and away went the little girl. So he had to run again, and this time he ran so fast that he got before her, and turning round caught her in his arms, when down they went both together, which made the little girl laugh in the midst of her crying.",diamond run fast have broom few moment catch frock tore hand go little girl have run time run get turn catch arm go make little girl laugh midst cry 
52,"“Where are you going?” asked Diamond, rubbing the elbow that had stuck farthest out. The arm it belonged to was twined round a lamp-post as he stood between the little girl and the wind.",go ask rub elbow stick farthest arm belong twin lamp post stand little girl wind

77,"“Now you lead me,” he said, taking her hand, “and I’ll take care of you.”",lead say take hand take care 
78,"The girl withdrew her hand, but only to dry her eyes with her frock, for the other had enough to do with her broom. She put it in his again, and led him, turning after turning, until they stopped at a cellar-door in a very dirty lane. There she knocked.",girl withdraw hand dry eye frock other have enough do broom put lead turn turn stop cellar door dirty lane knock

99,"Diamond obeyed. The wind had now fallen considerably. They wandered on and on, turning in this direction and that, without any reason for one way more than another, until they had got out of the thick of the houses into a waste kind of place. By this time they were both very tired. Diamond felt a good deal inclined to cry, and thought he had been very silly to get down from the back of North Wind; not that he would have minded it if he had done the girl any good; but he thought he had been of no use to her. He was mistaken there, for she was far happier for having Diamond with her than if she had been wandering about alone. She did not seem so tired as he was.",obey wind fall wander turn direction reason way more get thick house waste kind place time tired feel good deal inclined cry think silly get back minded do girl good think use mistaken happy have wonder seem tired

111,"She did not believe a word of it. She said he wasn’t such a flat as to believe all that bosh. But as she spoke there came a great blast of wind through the arch, and set the barrel rolling.

114,"They found themselves at last on a rising ground that sloped rather steeply on the other side. It was a waste kind of spot below, bounded by an irregular wall, with a few doors in it. Outside lay broken things in general, from garden rollers to flower-pots and wine-bottles. But the moment they reached the brow of the rising ground, a gust of wind seized them and blew them down hill as fast as they could run. Nor could Diamond stop before he went bang against one of the doors in the wall. To his dismay it burst open. When they came to themselves they peeped in. It was the back door of a garden.",find last rise ground slope other side waste kind spot bound irregular wall few door lay break thing general garden roller flower pot wine bottle moment reach brow rise ground gust wind seize blow hill run stop go bang door wall dismay burst open come peep back door garden

123,"Diamond got very angry. But he remembered that even if she did box his ears, he musn’t box hers again, for she was a girl, and all that boys must do, if girls are rude, is to go away and leave them. So he went in at the door.",get angry remember box ear box girl boy do girl rude go leave go door
