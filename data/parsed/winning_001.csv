1,CHAPTER I. THE OUTLAWS.,chapter outlats 
2," It was a bright morning in the month of August, when a lad of some fifteen years of age, sitting on a low wall, watched party after party of armed men riding up to the castle of the Earl of Evesham. A casual observer glancing at his curling hair and bright open face, as also at the fashion of his dress, would at once have assigned to him a purely Saxon origin; but a keener eye would have detected signs that Norman blood ran also in his veins, for his figure was lither and lighter, his features more straightly and shapely cut, than was common among Saxons. His dress consisted of a tight-fitting jerkin, descending nearly to his knees. The material was a light-blue cloth, while over his shoulder hung a short cloak of a darker hue. His cap was of Saxon fashion, and he wore on one side a little plume of a heron. In a somewhat costly belt hung a light short sword, while across his knees lay a crossbow, in itself almost a sure sign of its bearer being of other than Saxon blood. The boy looked anxiously as party after party rode past towards the castle.",bright morning month lad year age sit low wall watch party party armed man ride castle casual observer glance curling hair bright open face fashion dress assign saxon origin keener eye detect sign blood run vein figure lither light feature shapely cut common dress consist tight fitting jerkin descend knee material light blue cloth shoulder hang short cloak dark hue cap saxon fashion wear side little plume heron costly belt hang light short sword knee lay crossbow sure sign bearer other saxon blood boy look party party ride castle 
3,"""I would give something,"" he said, ""to know what wind blows these knaves here. From every petty castle in the Earl's feu the retainers seem hurrying here. Is he bent, I wonder, on settling once and for all his quarrels with the Baton of Wortham? or can he be intending to make a clear sweep of the woods? Ah! here comes my gossip Hubert; he may tell me the meaning of this gathering.""",give say know wind blow knave petty castle retainer seem hurry bent wonder settle quarrel intend make clear sweep wood come gossip tell meaning gathering 
4,"Leaping to his feet, the speaker started at a brisk walk to meet a jovial-looking personage coming down from the direction of the castle. The new comer was dressed in the attire of a falconer, and two dogs followed at his heels.",leap foot speaker start brisk walk meet jovial look personage come direction castle new comer dress attire falconer dog follow heel 
5,"""Ah, Master Cuthbert,"" he said, ""what brings you so near to the castle? It is not often that you favour us with your presence.""",say bring castle favour presence 
6,"""I am happier in the woods, as you well know, and was on my way thither but now, when I paused at the sight of all these troopers flocking in to Evesham. What enterprise has Sir Walter on hand now, think you?""",happy wood know way pause sight trooper flock enterprise have hand think 
7,"""The earl keeps his own counsel,"" said the falconer, ""but methinks a shrewd guess might be made at the purport of the gathering. It was but three days since that his foresters were beaten back by the landless men, whom they caught in the very act of cutting up a fat buck. As thou knowest, my lord though easy and well-disposed to all, and not fond of harassing and driving the people as are many of his neighbours, is yet to the full as fanatical anent his forest privileges as the worst of them. They tell me that when the news came in of the poor figure that his foresters cut with broken bows and draggled plumes--for the varlets had soused them in a pond of not over savoury water--he swore a great oath that he would clear the forest of the bands. It may be, indeed, that this gathering is for the purpose of falling in force upon that evil-disposed and most treacherous baron, Sir John of Wortham, who has already begun to harry some of the outlying lands, and has driven off, I hear, many heads of cattle. It is a quarrel which will have to be fought out sooner or later, and the sooner the better, say I. Although I am no man of war, and love looking after my falcons or giving food to my dogs far more than exchanging hard blows, yet would I gladly don the buff and steel coat to aid in levelling the keep of that robber and tyrant, Sir John of Wortham.""",earl keep own counsel say falconer methink shrewd guess make purport gathering day forester beat landless man catch very act cut fat buck lord easy dispose fond harass drive person many neighbour full fanatical forest privilege bad tell news come poor figure forester cut break bow draggle plume varlet souse pond savoury water swore great oath clear forest band gathering purpose fall force evil dispose treacherous baron begin harry outly land drive hear many head cattle quarrel have fight good say man war love look falcon give food dog more exchang hard blow don buff steel coat aid levell keep robber tyrant 
8,"""Thanks, good Hubert,"" said the lad. ""I must not stand gossiping here. The news you have told me, as you know, touches me closely, for I would not that harm should come to the forest men.""",thanks good say lad stand gossipe news tell know touch harm come forest man 
9,"""Let it not out, I beseech thee, Cuthbert, that the news came from me, for temperate as Sir Walter is at most times, he would, methinks, give me short shift did he know that the wagging of my tongue might have given warning through which the outlaws of the Chase should slip through his fingers.""",let beseech news come temperate most time methink give short shift know wag tongue give warning outlaw chase slip finger 
10,"""Fear not, Hubert; I can be mum when the occasion needs. Can you tell me farther, when the bands now gathering are likely to set forth?""",fear mum occasion need tell band gathering likely set 
11,"""In brief breathing space,"" the falconer replied. ""Those who first arrived I left swilling beer, and devouring pies and other provisions cooked for them last night, and from what I hear, they will set forth as soon as the last comer has arrived. Whichever be their quarry, they will try to fall upon it before the news of their arrival is bruited abroad.""",brief breathing space falconer reply arrive leave swill beer devour pie other provision cook last night hear set last comer arrive quarry try fall news arrival bruit 
12,"With a wave of his hand to the falconer the boy started. Leaving the road, and striking across the slightly undulated country dotted here and there by groups of trees, the lad ran at a brisk trot, without stopping to halt or breathe, until after half an hour's run he arrived at the entrance of a building, whose aspect proclaimed it to be the abode of a Saxon franklin of some importance. It would not be called a castle, but was rather a fortified house, with a few windows looking without, and surrounded by a moat crossed by a drawbridge, and capable of sustaining anything short of a real attack. Erstwood had but lately passed into Norman hands, and was indeed at present owned by a Saxon. Sir William de Lance, the father of the lad who is now entering its portals, was a friend and follower of the Earl of Evesham; and soon after his lord had married Gweneth the heiress of all these fair lands--given to him by the will of the king, to whom by the death of her father she became a ward--Sir William had married Editha, the daughter and heiress of the franklin of Erstwood, a cousin and dear friend of the new Countess of Evesham.",wave hand falconer boy start leave road strike undulated country dot group tree lad run brisk trot stop halt breathe hour run arrive entrance building aspect proclaim abode saxon importance call castle fortify house few window look surround moat cross drawbridge capable sustain short real attack have pass hand present own father lad enter portal friend follower lord marry heiress fair land give will king death father become ward marry daughter heiress cousin dear friend new 
13,"In neither couple could the marriage at first have been called one of inclination on the part of the ladies, but love came after marriage. Although the knights and barons of the Norman invasion would, no doubt, be considered rude and rough in these days of broadcloth and civilization, yet their manners were gentle and polished by the side of those of the rough though kindly Saxon franklins; and although the Saxon maids were doubtless as patriotic as their fathers and mothers, yet the female mind is greatly led by gentle manners and courteous address. Thus then, when bidden or forced to give their hands to the Norman knights, they speedily accepted their lot, and for the most part grew contented and happy enough. In their changed circumstances it was pleasanter to ride by the side of their Norman husbands, surrounded by a gay cavalcade, to hawk and to hunt, than to discharge the quiet duties of mistress of a Saxon farm-house. In many cases, of course, their lot was rendered wretched by the violence and brutality of their lords; but in the majority they were well satisfied with their lot, and these mixed marriages did more to bring the peoples together and weld them in one, than all the laws and decrees of the Norman sovereigns.",couple marriage first call inclination part lady love come marriage knight baron invasion consider rude rough day broadcloth civilization manners gentle polished side rough kindly saxon franklin saxon maid patriotic father mother female mind lead gentle manners courteous address bidd force give hand knight accept lot most part grow contented happy change circumstance pleasanter ride side husband surround gay cavalcade hawk hunt discharge quiet duty mistress saxon farm house many case course lot render wretch violence brutality lord majority satisfied lot mix marriage do more bring people weld law decree sovereign 
14,"This had certainly been the case with Editha, whose marriage with Sir William had been one of the greatest happiness. She had lost him, three years before the story begins, fighting in Normandy, in one of the innumerable wars in which our first Norman kings were constantly involved. On entering the gates of Erstwood, Cuthbert had rushed hastily to the room where his mother was sitting with three or four of her maidens, engaged in work.",case marriage great happiness lose year story begin fight innumerable war first king involve enter gate rush room mother sit maiden engage work 
15,"""I want to speak to you at once, mother,"" he said.",want speak mother say 
16,"""What is it now, my son?"" said his mother, who was still young and very comely. Waving her hand to the girls, they left her.",son say mother young comely wave hand girl leave 
17,"""Mother,"" he said, when they were alone, ""I fear me that Sir Walter is about to make a great raid upon the outlaws. Armed men have been coming in all the morning from the castles round, and if it be not against the Baron de Wortham that these preparations are intended, and methinks it is not, it must needs be against the landless men.""",mother say alone fear about make great raid outlaw armed man come morning castle preparation intend methink need landless man 
18,"""What would you do, Cuthbert?"" his mother asked anxiously. ""It will not do for you to be found meddling in these matters. At present you stand well in the favour of the Earl, who loves you for the sake of his wife, to whom you are kin, and of your father, who did him good liegeman's service.""",do mother ask do find meddling matter present stand favour love sake wife kin father do good liegeman service 
19,"""But, mother, I have many friends in the wood. There is Cnut, their chief, your own first cousin, and many others of our friends, all good men and true, though forced by the cruel Norman laws to refuge in the woods.""",mother have many friend wood be chief own first cousin many other friend good man true force cruel law refuge wood 
20,"""What would you do?"" again his mother asked.",do mother ask 
21,"""I would take Ronald my pony and ride to warn them of the danger that threatens.""",take pony ride warn danger threaten 
22,"""You had best go on foot, my son. Doubtless men have been set to see that none from the Saxon homesteads carry the warning to the woods. The distance is not beyond your reach, for you have often wandered there, and on foot you can evade the eye of the watchers; but one thing, my son, you must promise, and that is, that in no case, should the Earl and his bands meet with the outlaws, will you take part in any fray or struggle.""",have good go foot son doubtless man set see homestead carry warning wood distance reach wander foot evade eye watcher thing son promise case band meet outlaw take part fray struggle 
23,"""That will I willingly, mother,"" he said. ""I have no cause for offence against the castle or the forest, and my blood and my kin are with both. I would fain save shedding of blood in a quarrel like this. I hope that the time may come when Saxon and Norman may fight side by side, and I maybe there to see.""",mother say have cause offence castle forest blood kin fain save shedding blood quarrel hope time come fight side side see 
24,"A few minutes later, having changed his blue doublet for one of more sober and less noticeable colour, Cuthbert started for the great forest, which then stretched to within a mile of Erstwood. In those days a large part of the country was covered with forest, and the policy of the Normans in preserving these woods for the chase, tended to prevent the increase of cultivation.",few minute change blue doublet sober noticeable colour start great forest stretch mile day large part country cover forest policy preserve wood chase tend prevent increase cultivation 
25,"The farms and cultivated lands were all held by Saxons, who although nominally handed over to the nobles to whom William and his successors had given the fiefs, saw but little of their Norman masters. These stood, indeed, much in the position in which landlords stand to their tenants, payment being made, for the most part, in produce. At the edge of the wood the trees grew comparatively far apart, but as Cuthbert proceeded farther into its recesses, the trees in the virgin forest stood thick and close together. Here and there open glades ran across each other, and in these his sharp eye, accustomed to the forest, could often see the stags starting away at the sound of his footsteps.",farm cultivate land hold hand noble successor give fief see little master stand much position landlord stand tenant payment make most part produce edge wood tree grow proceed recesse tree virgin forest stand thick close open glade run other sharp eye accustom forest see stag start sound footstep 
26,"It was a full hour's journey before Cuthbert reached the point for which he was bound. Here, in an open space, probably cleared by a storm ages before, and overshadowed by giant trees, was a group of men of all ages and appearances. Some were occupied in stripping the skin off a buck which hung from the bough of one of the trees. Others were roasting portions of the carcass of another deer. A few sat apart, some talking, others busy in making arrows, while a few lay asleep on the greensward. As Cuthbert entered the clearing, several of the party rose to their feet.",full hour journey reach point bind open space clear storm age overshadow giant tree group man age appearance occupy stripp skin buck hang bough tree other roast portion carcass deer few sit talking other busy make arrow few lay asleep greensward enter clear several party rise foot 
27,"""Ah, Cuthbert,"" shouted a man of almost gigantic stature, who appeared to be one of the leaders of the party, ""what brings you here, lad, so early? You are not wont to visit us till even, when you can lay your crossbow at a stag by moonlight.""",shout man gigantic stature appear leader party bring lad visit lay crossbow stag moonlight 
28,"""No, no, Cousin Cnut,"" Cuthbert said, ""thou canst not say that I have ever broken the forest laws, though I have looked on often and often, whilst you have done so.""",cousin say say break forest law look do 
29,"""The abettor is as bad as the thief,"" laughed Cnut, ""and if the foresters caught us in the act, I wot they would make but little difference whether it was the shaft of my longbow or the quarrel from thy crossbow which brought down the quarry. But again, lad, why comest thou here? for I see by the sweat on your face and by the heaving of your sides that you have run fast and far.""",abettor bad thief laugh forester catch act wet make little difference shaft longbow quarrel crossbow bring quarry comest see sweat face heaving side run fast 
30,"""I have, Cnut; I have not once stopped for breathing since I left Erstwood. I have come to warn you of danger. The earl is preparing for a raid.""",stop breathing leave come warn danger earl prepare raid 
31,Cnut laughed somewhat disdainfully.,laugh 
32,"""He has raided here before, and I trow has carried off no game. The landless men of the forest can hold their own against a handful of Norman knights and retainers in their own home.""",raid trow carry game landless man forest hold own handful knight retainer own home 
33,"""Ay,"" said Cuthbert, ""but this will be no common raid. This morning bands from all the holds within miles round are riding in, and at least 500 men-at-arms are likely to do chase today.""",say common raid morning band hold mile ride least man arm likely do chase today 
34,"""Is it so?"" said Cnut, while exclamations of surprise, but not of apprehension, broke from those standing round. ""If that be so, lad, you have done us good service indeed. With fair warning we can slip through the fingers of ten times 500 men, but if they came upon us unawares, and hemmed us in it would fare but badly with us, though we should, I doubt not give a good account of them before their battle-axes and maces ended the strife. Have you any idea by which road they will enter the forest, or what are their intentions?""",say exclamation surprise apprehension break standing do good service fair warning slip finger time man come unawares hemm fare doubt give good account battle axe mace end strife have idea road enter forest intention 
35,"""I know not,"" Cuthbert said; ""all that I gathered was that the earl intended to sweep the forest, and to put an end to the breaches of the laws, not to say of the rough treatment that his foresters have met with at your hands. You had best, methinks, be off before Sir Walter and his heavily-armed men are here. The forest, large as it is, will scarce hold you both, and methinks you had best shift your quarters to Langholm Chase until the storm has passed.""",know say gather earl intend sweep forest put end breach law say rough treatment forester meet hand have good methink armed man forest large hold methink have good shift quarter storm pass 
36,"""To Langholm be it, then,"" said Cnut, ""though I love not the place. Sir John of Wortham is a worse neighbour by far than the earl. Against the latter we bear no malice, he is a good knight and a fair lord; and could he free himself of the Norman notions that the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and the fishes of the water, all belong to Normans, and that we Saxons have no share in them, I should have no quarrel with him. He grinds not his neighbours, he is content with a fair tithe of the produce, and as between man and man is a fair judge without favour. The baron is a fiend incarnate; did he not fear that he would lose by so doing, he would gladly cut the throats, or burn, or drown, or hang every Saxon within twenty miles of his hold. He is a disgrace to his order, and some day when our band gathers a little stronger, we will burn his nest about his ears.""",say love place bad neighbour earl latter bear malice good knight fair lord free notion bird air beast field fish water belong have share have quarrel grind neighbour content fair tithe produce man man fair judge favour baron fiend incarnate fear lose do cut throat burn drown hang mile hold disgrace order day band gather little strong burn nest ear 
37,"""It will be a hard nut to crack,"" Cuthbert said, laughing. ""With such arms as you have in the forest the enterprise would be something akin to scaling the skies.""",hard nut crack say laugh such arm have forest enterprise akin scaling sky 
38,"""Ladders and axes will go far, lad, and the Norman men-at-arms have learned to dread our shafts. But enough of the baron; if we must be his neighbours for a time, so be it.""",ladder axe go lad man arm learn dread shaft enough baron neighbour time 
39,"""You have heard, my mates,"" he said, turning to his comrades gathered around him, ""what Cuthbert tells us. Are you of my opinion, that it is better to move away till the storm is past, than to fight against heavy odds, without much chance of either booty or victory?""",hear mate say turn comrade gather tell opinion good move storm past fight heavy odd much chance booty victory 
40,"A general chorus proclaimed that the outlaws approved of the proposal for a move to Langholm Chase. The preparations were simple. Bows were taken down from the boughs on which they were hanging, quivers slung across the backs, short cloaks thrown over the shoulders. The deer was hurriedly dismembered, and the joints fastened to a pole slung on the shoulders of two of the men. The drinking-cups, some of which were of silver, looking strangely out of place among the rough horn implements and platters, were bundled together, carried a short distance and dropped among some thick bushes for safety; and then the band started for Wortham.",general chorus proclaim outlaw approve proposal move preparation simple bow take bough hang quiver sling back short cloak throw shoulder deer dismember joint fasten pole sling shoulder man drinking cup silver look place rough horn implement plateer bundle carry short distance drop thick bush safety band start 
41,"With a cordial farewell and many thanks to Cuthbert, who declined their invitations to accompany them, the retreat to Langholm commenced.",cordial farewell many thanks decline invitation accompany retreat commence

45,"Knowing that they were still a long way off, he advanced as rapidly as he could in the direction in which they were coming. When by the sound of distant voices and the breaking of branches he knew that one at least of the parties was near at hand, he rapidly climbed a thick tree and ensconced himself in the branches, and there watched, secure and hidden from the sharpest eye, the passage of a body of men-at-arms fully a hundred strong, led by Sir Walter himself, accompanied by some half dozen of his knights.",know long way advance direction come sound distant voice breaking branch know least party hand climb thick tree ensconce branch watch secure hide sharp eye passage body man arm strong lead accompany half knight 
46,"When they had passed, Cuthbert again slipped down the tree and made at all speed for home. He reached it, so far as he knew without having been observed by a single passer-by.",pass slip tree make speed home reach know observe single passer 
47,"After a brief talk with his mother, he started for the castle, as his appearance there would divert any suspicion that might arise; and it would also appear natural that seeing the movements of so large a body of men, he should go up to gossip with his acquaintances there.",brief talk mother start castle appearance divert suspicion arise appear natural see movement large body man go gossip acquaintance
