1,CHAPTER 1. THE SETTLERS AT HOME.,chapter settler 
2,"Two hundred years ago, the Isle of Axholme was one of the most remarkable places in England.  It is not an island in the sea.  It is a part of Lincolnshire--a piece of land hilly in the middle, and surrounded by rivers.  The Trent runs on the east side of it; and some smaller rivers formerly flowed round the rest of it, joining the Humber to the north.  These rivers carried down a great deal of mud with them to the Humber, and the tides of the Humber washed up a great deal of sea-sand into the mouths of the rivers; so that the waters could not for some time flow freely, and were at last prevented from flowing away at all: they sank into the ground, and made a swamp of it--a swamp of many miles round the hilly part of the Isle of Axholme.",year remarkable place island sea part piece land hilly middle surround river run east side small river flow rest join north river carry great deal mud tide wash great deal sea sand mouth river water time flow last prevent flow sink ground make swamp swamp many mile hilly part 
3,"This swamp was long a very dismal place.  Fish, and water-birds, and rats inhabited it: and here and there stood the hut of a fowler; or a peat-stack raised by the people who lived on the hills round, and who obtained their fuel from the peat-lands in the swamp.  There were also, sprinkled over the district, a few very small houses--cells belonging to the Abbey of Saint Mary, at York.  To these cells some of the monks from Saint Mary's had been fond of retiring, in old times, for meditation and prayer, and doing good in the district round; but when the soil became so swampy as to give them the ague as often as they paid a visit to these cells, the monks left off their practice of retiring hither; and their little dwellings stood empty, to be gradually overgrown with green moss and lank weeds, which no hand cleared away.",swamp long dismal place fish water bird rat inhabit stand hut fowler peat stack raise person live hill obtain fuel peat land swamp be sprinkle district few small house cell belong cell monk fond retire old time meditation prayer do good district soil become swampy give ague pay visit cell monk leave practice retire little dwelling stand empty overgrown green moss lank weed hand clear 
4,"At last a Dutchman, having seen what wonders were done in his own country by good draining, thought he could render this district fit to be inhabited and cultivated; and he made a bargain with the king about it.  After spending much money, and taking great pains, he succeeded. He drew the waters off into new channels, and kept them there by sluices, and by carefully watching the embankments he had raised.  The land which was left dry was manured and cultivated, till, instead of a reedy and mossy swamp, there were fields of clover and of corn, and meadows of the finest grass, with cattle and sheep grazing in large numbers.  The dwellings that were still standing were made into farm-houses, and new farmhouses were built.  A church here, and a chapel there was cleaned, and warmed, and painted, and opened for worship; and good roads crossed the district into all the counties near.",last see wonder do own country good draining think render district fit inhabit cultivate make bargain king spend much money take great pain succeed draw water new channel keep sluice watch embankment raise land leave dry manured cultivate reedy mossy swamp be field clover corn meadow fine grass cattle sheep graze large number dwelling stand make farm house new farmhouse build church chapel clean warm paint open worship good road cross district county 
5,"Instead of being pleased with this change, the people of the country were angry and discontented.  Those who lived near had been long accustomed to fishing and fowling in the swamp, without paying any rent, or having to ask anybody's leave.  They had no mind now to settle to the regular toilsome business of farming,--and to be under a landlord, to whom they must pay rent.  Probably, too, they knew nothing about farming, and would have failed in it if they had tried.  Thus far they were not to be blamed.  But nothing can exceed the malignity with which they treated the tenants who did settle in the isle, and the spiteful spirit which they showed towards them, on every occasion.",pleased change person country angry discontented live accustom fishing fowl swamp pay rent have ask leave have mind settle regular toilsome business farming landlord pay rent know farming fail try blame exceed malignity treat tenant settle isle spiteful spirit show occasion 
6,"These tenants were chiefly foreigners.  There was a civil war in England at that time: and the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire people were so much engaged in fighting for King Charles or for the Parliament, that fewer persons were at liberty to undertake new farms than there would have been in a time of peace.  When the Dutchman and his companions found that the English were not disposed to occupy the Levels (as the drained lands were called), they encouraged some of their own countrymen to come over.  With them arrived some few Frenchmen, who had been driven from France into Holland, on account of their being Protestants.  From first to last, there were about two hundred families, Dutch and French, settled in the Levels.  Some were collected into a village, and had a chapel opened, where a pastor of their own performed service for them. Others were scattered over the district, living just where their occupations required them to settle.",tenant foreigner be civil war time person engage fight few person liberty undertake new farm time peace companion find dispose occupy level drain land call encourage own countryman come arrive few drive account first last be family dutch french settle collect village have chapel open pastor own perform service other scatter district live occupation require settle 
7,"All these foreigners were subject to bad treatment from their neighbours; but the stragglers were the worst off; because it was easiest to tease and injure those who lived alone.  The disappointed fishers and fowlers gave other reasons for their own conduct, besides that of being nearly deprived of their fishing and fowling.  These reasons were all bad, as reasons for hating always are.  One excuse was that the new settlers were foreigners--as if those who were far from their own land did not need particular hospitality and kindness. Another plea was that they were connected with the king, by being settled on the lands which he had bargained to have drained: so that all who sided with the parliament ought to injure the new tenants, in order to annoy the king.  If the settlers had tried to serve the king by injuring his enemies, this last reason might have passed in a time of war.  But it was not so.  It is probable that the foreigners did not understand the quarrel.  At any rate, they took no part in it.  All they desired was to be left in peace, to cultivate the lands they paid rent for.  But instead of peace, they had little but persecution.",foreigner subject bad treatment neighbour straggler bad easy tease injure live disappointed fisher fowler give other reason own conduct deprive fishing fowling reason bad reason hate excuse new settler foreigner own land need particular hospitality kindness plea connect king settle land bargain drain sided parliament injure new tenant order annoy king settler try serve king injure enemy last reason pass time war probable foreigner understand quarrel rate take part desire leave peace cultivate land pay rent peace have little persecution 
8,"One of these settlers, Mr Linacre, was not himself a farmer.  He supplied the farmers of the district with a manure of a particular kind, which suited some of the richest soils they cultivated.  He found, in the red soil of the isle, a large mass of that white earth, called gypsum, which, when wetted and burnt, makes plaster of Paris; and which, when ground, makes a fine manure for some soils, as the careful Dutchmen well knew.  Mr Linacre set up a windmill on a little eminence which rose out of the Level, just high enough to catch the wind; and there he ground the gypsum which he dug from the neighbouring patch or quarry. He had to build some out-houses, but not a dwelling-house; for, near his mill, with just space enough for a good garden between, was one of the largest of the old cells of the monks of Saint Mary's, so well built of stone, and so comfortably arranged, that Mr Linacre had little to do but to have it cleaned and furnished, and the windows and doors made new, to fit it for the residence of his wife and children, and a servant.",settler farmer supply farmer district manure particular kind suit rich soil cultivate find red soil isle large mass white earth call gypsum wett burn make plaster ground make fine manure soil careful know set windmill little eminence rise level high catch wind ground gypsum dig neighbour patch quarry have build house dwelling house mill space good garden large old cell monk build stone arrange have little do have clean furnish window door make new fit residence wife child servant 
9,"This building was round, and had three rooms below, and three over them. A staircase of stone was in the very middle, winding round, like a corkscrew,--leading to the upper rooms, and out upon the roof, from which there was a beautiful view,--quite as far as the Humber to the north-east, and to the circle of hills on every other side.  Each of the rooms below had a door to the open air, and another to the staircase;-- very unlike modern houses, and not so fit as they to keep out wind and cold.  But for this, the dwelling would have been very warm, for the walls were of thick stone; and the fire-places were so large, that it seemed as if the monks had been fond of good fires.  Two of these lower rooms opened into the garden; and the third, the kitchen, into the yard;--so that the maid, Ailwin, had not far to go to milk the cow and feed the poultry.",building have room staircase stone very middle wind corkscrew lead upper room roof be beautiful view north east circle hill other side room have door open air staircase modern house fit keep wind cold dwelling warm wall thick stone fire place large seem monk fond good fire low room open garden third kitchen yard maid have go milk cow feed poultry 
10,"Mrs Linacre was as neat in the management of her house as people from Holland usually are; and she did not like that the sitting-room, where her husband had his meals, and spent his evenings, should be littered by the children, or used at all by them during her absence at her daily occupation, in the summer.  So she let them use the third room for their employments and their play.  Her occupation, every summer's day, was serving out the waters from a mineral spring, a good deal frequented by sick people, three miles from her house, on the way to Gainsborough. She set off, after an early breakfast, in the cool of the morning, and generally arrived at the hill-side where the spring was, and had unlocked her little shed, and taken out her glasses, and rinsed them, before any travellers passed.  It was rarely indeed that a sick person had to wait a minute for her appearance.  There she sat, in her shed when it rained, and under a tree when it was fine, sewing or knitting very diligently when no customers appeared, and now and then casting a glance over the Levels to the spot where her husband's mill rose in the midst of the green fields, and where she almost fancied sometimes that she could see the children sitting on the mill-steps, or working in the garden.  When customers appeared, she was always ready in a moment to serve them; and her smile cheered those who were sick, and pleased those who came merely from curiosity.  She slipped the halfpence she received into a pocket beneath her apron; and sometimes the pocket was such a heavy one to carry three miles home, that she just stepped aside to the village shop at Haxey, or into a farm-house where the people would be going to market next day, to get her copper exchanged for silver.  Since the times had become so troubled as they were now, however, she had avoided showing her money anywhere on the road.  Her husband's advice was that she should give up attending the spring altogether; but she gained so much money by it, and it was so likely that somebody would step into her place there as soon as she gave it up, so that she would not be able to regain her office when quieter times should come, that she entreated him to allow her to go on while she had no fears.  She took the heavy gold ear-rings out of her ears, wore a plainer cap, and left her large silver watch at home; so that she looked like a poor woman whom no needy soldier or bold thief would think of robbing.  She guessed by the sun what was the right time for locking up her glasses and going home; and she commonly met her husband, coming to fetch her, before she had got half-way.",neat management house person like sitting room husband have meal spend evening litter child use absence daily occupation summer let use third room employment play occupation summer day serve water mineral spring good deal frequent sick person mile house way set early breakfast cool morning arrive hill side spring unlock little shed take glasses rinse traveller pass sick person have wait minute appearance sit shed rain tree fine sew knitting customer appear cast glance spot husband mill rise midst green field fancy see child sit mill step work garden customer appear ready moment serve smile cheer sick pleased come curiosity slip halfpence receive pocket apron pocket heavy one carry mile step village shop farm house person go market next day get copper exchange silver time become troubled avoid show money road husband advice give attend spring gain much money likely step place give able regain office quiet time come entreat allow go have fear take heavy gold ear ring ear wear plainer cap leave large silver watch home look poor woman needy soldier bold thief think robb guess sun right time lock glasses go meet husband come fetch get half way 
11,"The three children were sure to be perched on the top of the quarry bank, or on the mill-steps, or out on the roof of the house, at the top of the winding staircase.  Little George himself, though only two years old, knew the very moment when he should shout and clap his hands, to make his mother wave her handkerchief from the turn of the road.  Oliver and Mildred did not exactly feel that the days were too long while their mother was away, for they had plenty to do; but they felt that the best part of the day was the hour between her return and their going to bed: and, unlike people generally, they liked winter better than summer, because at that season their mother never left them, except to go to the shop, or the market at Haxey.",child sure perch top quarry bank mill step roof house top wind staircase little year old know very moment shout clap hand make mother wave handkerchief turn road feel day long mother have plenty do feel good part day hour return go bed person like winter good summer season mother leave go shop market 
12,"Though Oliver was only eleven, and Mildred nine, they were not too young to have a great deal to do.  Oliver was really useful as a gardener; and many a good dish of vegetables of his growing came to table in the course of the year.  Mildred had to take care of the child almost all day; she often prepared the cabbage, and cut the bacon for Ailwin to broil.  She could also do what Ailwin could not,--she could sew a little; and now and then there was an apron or a handkerchief ready to be shown when Mrs Linacre came home in the evening.  If she met with any difficulty in her job, the maid could not help her, but her father sometimes could; and it was curious to see Mildred mounting the mill when she was at any loss, and her father wiping the white plaster off his hands, and taking the needle or the scissors in his great fingers, rather than that his little girl should not be able to surprise her mother with a finished piece of work.  Then, both Oliver and Mildred had to learn their catechism, to say to Pastor Dendel on Sunday; and always a copy or an exercise on hand, to be ready to show him when he should call; and some book to finish that he had lent them to read, and that others of his flock would be ready for when they had done.",young have great deal do useful gardener many good dish vegetable grow come table course year have take care child day prepare cabbage cut bacon broil do sew little be apron handkerchief ready show come evening meet difficulty job maid help father curious see mount mill loss father wipe white plaster hand take needle scissors great finger little girl able surprise mother finish piece work have learn catechism say copy exercise hand ready show call book finish loan read other flock ready do 
13,"Besides all this, there was an occupation which both boy and girl thought more of than of all others together.  Among the loads of gypsum that came to the mill, there were often pieces of the best kind,--lumps of real, fine alabaster.  Alabaster is so soft as to be easily worked. Even a finger-nail will make a mark upon it.  Everybody knows how beautiful vases and little statues, well wrought in alabaster, look on a mantelpiece, or a drawing-room table.  Oliver had seen such in France, where they are very common: and his father had carried one or two ornaments of this kind into Holland, when he had to leave France.  It was a great delight for Oliver to find, on settling in Axholme, that he could have as much alabaster as he pleased, if he could only work it. With a little help from Pastor Dendel and his father, he soon learned to do so; and of all his employments, he liked this the best.  Pastor Dendel brought him a few bowls and cups of pretty shapes and different sizes, made of common wood by a turner, who was one of his flock; and Oliver first copied these in clay, and then in alabaster.  By degrees he learned to vary his patterns, and at last to make his clay models from fancies of his own,--some turning out failures, and others prettier than any of his wooden cups.  These last he proceeded to carve out of alabaster.",be occupation boy girl think more other load gypsum come mill be piece good kind lump real fine alabaster soft work finger nail make mark know beautiful vase little statue wring alabaster look mantelpiece draw room table see such common father carry ornament kind have leave great delight find settle have much alabaster pleased work little help father learn do employment like good bring few bowl cup pretty shape different size make common wood turner flock copy clay alabaster degree learn vary pattern last make clay model fancy own turn failure other pretty wooden cup last proceed carve alabaster 
14,"Mildred could not help watching him while he was about his favourite work, though it was difficult to keep little George from tossing the alabaster about, and stamping on the best pieces, or sucking them.  He would sometimes give his sister a few minutes' peace and quiet by rolling the wooden bowls the whole length of the room, and running after them: and there was also an hour, in the middle of the day, when he went to sleep in his large Dutch cradle.  At those times Mildred would consult with her brother about his work; or sew or watch him by turns; or read one of the pastor's little books, stopping occasionally to wonder whether Oliver could attend at once to his carving, and to what she was reading.  When she saw that he was spoiling any part, or that his hand was shaking, she would ask whether he had not been at work long enough; and then they would run out to the garden or the quarry, or to jump George (if he was awake again) from the second mill-step.",help watch favourite work difficult keep little toss alabaster stamp good piece suck give sister few minute peace quiet roll wooden bowl whole length room run be hour middle day go sleep large dutch cradle time consult brother work sew watch turn read pastor little book stop wonder attend carving read see spoil part hand shake ask work run garden quarry jump awake second mill step 
15,"One fine month of August, not a breath of wind had been blowing for a week or two, so that the mill-sails had not made a single turn; not a load of gypsum had been brought during the time, and Oliver was quite out of alabaster; though, as it happened, he much wanted a good supply, for a particular reason.  Every morning he brought out his tools; and every morning the sky was so clear, the corn-fields so still--the very trees so silent, that he wondered whether there had ever been so calm a month of August before.  His father and he employed their time upon the garden, while they had so good an opportunity.  Before it was all put in order, and the entire stock of autumn cabbages set, there came a breezy day; and the children were left to finish the cabbage patch by themselves.  While they were at work, it made them merry to hear the mill-sails whirring through the air, and to see, at intervals, the trees above the quarry bowing their heads, and the reeds waving in the swamp, and the water of the meadow-ponds dimpling and rippling, as the wind swept over the Levels.  Oliver soon heard something that he liked better still--the creak of the truck that brought the gypsum from the quarry, and the crack of the driver's whip.",fine month breath wind blow week mill sail make single turn load gypsum bring time alabaster happen want good supply particular reason morning bring tool morning sky clear corn field very tree silent wonder be calm month father employ time garden have good opportunity put order entire stock autumn cabbage set come breezy day child leave finish cabbage patch work make merry hear mill sail whirr air see interval tree quarry bow head reed wave swamp water meadow pond dimple ripple wind sweep hear like creak truck bring gypsum quarry crack driver whip 
16,"He threw down the dibble with which he was planting out his cabbages-- tripped over the line he had set to direct his drilling, tumbled on his face, scrambled up again, and ran, rubbing the dirt from his knees as he went, to look out some alabaster from the load.",throw dibble plant cabbage trip line set direct drilling tumble face scramble run rub dirt knee go look alabaster load 
17,"Mildred was not long after him, though he called to her that she had better stay and finish the cabbages, and though little George, immediately on feeling himself at liberty, threw himself upon the fresh mould of the cabbage bed, and amused himself with pulling up, and flinging right and left, the plants that had just been set.  How could Mildred attend to this, when she was sure she was wanted to turn over the gypsum, and see what she could find?  So Master George went on with his pranks, till Ailwin, by accident, saw him from the yard, ran and snatched him up, flung him over her shoulder, and carried him away screaming, till, to pacify him, she set him down among the poultry, which he presently found more amusing than young cabbage plants.",long call have good stay finish cabbage little feel liberty throw fresh mould cabbage bed amuse pull fling leave plant set attend sure want turn gypsum see find go prank accident see yard run snatch flung shoulder carry scream pacify set poultry find amusing young cabbage plant 
18,"""Now we shall have a set of new cups for the spring, presently,"" said Oliver, as he measured lump after lump with his little foot-rule.",have set new cup spring say measure lump lump little foot rule 
19,"""Cups for the waters!"" exclaimed his father.  ""So that is the reason of this prodigious hurry, is it, my boy?

Which of them do you think ought to be ashamed of tin cups?""",cup water exclaim father reason prodigious hurry boy think tin cup good mother customer water think ashamed tin cup

There is no hope of keeping anything from our enemies.""",boy be want pry eye see poor foreigner do mother watch belief time dip cup mill garden be hope keep enemy 
24,"Seeing Oliver look about him uneasily, Mr Linacre reproached himself for having said anything to alarm his timid boy: so he added what he himself always found the most comforting thought, when he felt disturbed at living among unkind neighbours.",see look reproach say alarm timid boy add find comforting thought feel disturb live unkind neighbour

36,"She did work away, till she was so hot and tired that she had to stop and rest.  There were still two rows to plant; and she thought she should never get through them,--or at any rate, not before Oliver had proceeded a great way with his carving.  She was going to cry; but she remembered how that would vex Oliver: so she restrained herself, and ran to ask Ailwin whether she could come and help.  Ailwin always did what everybody asked her; so she gave over sorting feathers, and left them all about, while she went down the garden.",work hot tired have stop rest be row plant think get rate proceed great way carving go cry remember vex restrain run ask come help do ask give sorting feather leave go garden

38,"There were plenty of water-fowl in the marsh; and there was something else which Mildred did not seem to like.  While George was quack-quacking, and making himself as like a little goose as he could, Mildred softly called to Ailwin, and beckoned her to the hedge.  Ailwin came, swinging the great spade in her right hand, as easily as Mildred could flourish George's whip.",be plenty water fowl marsh be else seem like quack quacking make little goose call beckon hedge come swing great spade right hand flourish whip

41,"Little George, thinking that everybody was very much frightened, began to roar; and that made Ailwin talk louder still, to comfort him; so that nothing that Mildred said was heard.  At last, she pulled Ailwin's apron, so that the tall woman stooped down, to ask what she wanted.",little think frighten begin roar make talk comfort say hear last pull apron tall woman stoop ask want

45,"She was turning to go up the garden, when a laugh from George made her look back again.  She saw a head covered with an otter-skin cap,--the face looking very cross and threatening, peeping over the hedge,--which was so high above the marsh, that the person must have climbed the bank on purpose to look into the garden.  There was no mistaking the face. It was certainly Roger Redfurn--the plague of the settlers, who, with his uncle, Stephen Redfurn, was always doing all the mischief he could to everybody who had, as he said, trespassed on the marshes.  Nobody liked to see the Redfurns sitting down in the neighbourhood; and still less, skulking about the premises.  Mildred flew towards the mill; while Ailwin, who never stopped to consider what was wise, and might not, perhaps, have hit upon wisdom if she had, took up a stone, and told Roger he had better be gone, for that he had no friends here.  Roger seemed to have just come from some orchard; for he pulled a hard apple out of his pocket, aimed it at Ailwin's head, and struck her such a blow on the nose as made her eyes water.  While she was wiping her eyes with her apron, and trying to see again, Roger coaxed the child to bring him his apple again, and disappeared.",turn go garden laugh make look see head cover otter skin cap face look cross threaten peep hedge high marsh person climb bank purpose look garden be mistake face plague settler uncle do mischief say trespass marsh like see sit neighbourhood less skulk premise fly mill stop consider wise hit wisdom take stone tell gone have friend seem come orchard pull hard apple pocket aim head strike blow nose make eye water wipe eye apron try see coax child bring apple disappear 
46,"When Mildred reached the mill, she found Pastor Dendel there, talking with her father about sending some manure to his land.  The pastor was so busy, that he only gave her a nod; and she had therefore time to recover herself, instead of frightening everybody with her looks and her news at once.  Oliver could not stay in the house while the pastor was at the mill: so he stood behind him, chipping away at the rough part of his work.  Mildred whispered to him that the Redfurns were close at hand.  She saw Oliver turn very red, though he told her not to be frightened.  Perhaps the pastor perceived this too, when he turned round, for he said--",reach mill find talk father send manure land pastor busy give nod have time recover frightening look news stay house pastor mill stand chip rough part work whisper close hand see turn red tell frighten pastor perceive turn say
