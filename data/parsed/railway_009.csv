And then you make a cone of clean, white paper with a little hole at the pointed end, and put the pink egg-sugar in at the big end.

To begin with, there was only just time for Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis to rush into the wash-house, pushing the young and open-mouthed Perks children in front of them. There was not time to shut the door, so that, without at all meaning it, they had to listen to what went on in the kitchen.
