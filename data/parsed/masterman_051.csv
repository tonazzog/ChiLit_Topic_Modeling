2,"Mr Seagrave and Ready then set to work, and made a rough sort of bed of cocoa-nut branches; and, after eating their supper, committed themselves to the divine protection, and went to sleep.  The next morning they resumed their labour, and opened every other case and package that had been saved from the wreck; they found more books, four boxes of candles, three casks of rice, and several other useful articles, besides many others which were of no value to them.",ready set work make rough sort bed cocoa nut branch eat supper commit divine protection go sleep next morning resume labour open other case package save wreck find more book box candle cask rice several other useful article many other value

6,"The sand was shovelled up, and the barrels of beef and pork and the deal boards found in good order, but many other things were quite spoilt. About noon they had finished, and as they had plenty of time, Mr Seagrave took the bearings of the different points of land with the compasses.  They then shouldered their muskets, and set off on their return.",sand shovell barrel beef pork deal board find good order many other thing spoil noon finish have plenty time take bearing different point land compass shoulder musket set return 
7,"They gained the house in the bay, and having rested a little while at the storehouse, they proceeded on their way to the tents in the meadow. They had about half a mile to go, when Ready heard a noise, and made a sign to Mr Seagrave to stop.  Ready, whispering to Mr Seagrave that the pigs were all close to them, loaded his musket; Mr Seagrave did the same, and they walked very softly to where they now heard their grunting; they did not see them till they were within twenty yards, and then they came upon the whole herd; the pigs raised their heads; the old ones gave a loud grunt, and then, just as Ready fired his musket, they all set off at full speed.  Mr Seagrave had no opportunity of firing, but Ready had shot one, which lay kicking and struggling under a cocoa-nut tree.",gain house bay rest little while storehouse proceed way tent meadow have mile go ready hear noise make sign stop ready whisper pig close load musket do same walk hear grunting see yard come whole herd pig raise head old one give loud grunt ready fire musket set full speed have opportunity fire ready shoot lay kick struggle cocoa nut tree

Yesterday evening, when I was tired of work, I thought I would take the boat, and try if there was any fish to be caught on this side of the island in the deep water, and I caught three large ones, quite different from those we took among the reefs.

20,"As soon as they were at the tents, Ready hung up the pig to the cross pole of the tent in which he and William and Mr Seagrave slept, and having propped the muskets up against the side of the tent, he went with William to get his knife and some stretchers of wood to open the pig with.  While he and William were away, Caroline and Tommy came out to look at it, and Tommy, after telling Caroline how glad he was that they were to have roast pig for dinner, took up one of the muskets, and said, ""Now, Caroline, I'll shoot the pig.""",tent ready hang pig cross pole tent sleep proppe musket side tent go get knife stretcher wood open pig come look tell glad have roast pig dinner take musket say shoot pig

26,"It so happened that Tommy had taken up Mr Seagrave's musket, which had not been fired, and when he pulled the trigger it went off, and as he did not hold it tight to his shoulder, it recoiled, and hit him with the butt right on his face, knocking out two of his teeth, besides making his nose bleed very fast.",happen take musket fire pull trigger go hold shoulder recoil hit butt face knock tooth make nose ble

28,"When Mrs Seagrave saw Tommy all covered with blood, and screaming so loud, she was so alarmed that she could not stand, and fell fainting in Mr Seagrave's arms.  Ready and William, on hearing the musket go off, had run as fast as they could, fearing that some accident had happened; and while Mr Seagrave supported his wife, Ready went to Tommy, and wiping the blood off his face with the palm of his hand, perceived that there was no wound or serious mischief, and cried out to Mr Seagrave, ""He's not hurt, sir; it's only his nose bleeding.""",see cover blood scream alarmed stand fall fainting arm ready hear musket go run fear accident happen support wife ready go wipe blood face palm hand perceive be wound serious mischief cry hurt sir nose bleeding

He was undressed, and put to bed, and was soon fast asleep.",half hour cease cry nose leave bleeding face wash discover lose front tooth cheek lip bruise undress put bed fast asleep
