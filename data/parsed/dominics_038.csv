2,"The little company of watchers sprang to their feet with one accord and listened, as Stephen wildly flung up the window.  The storm burst into the room as he did so, with all its vehemence, drenching those who stood near, and deafening every one with its roar.  But no other sound could be heard.  Stephen, heedless of the weather, stood motionless with his head out of the window, listening.  Alas! it must have been a false hope after all--a brother's fancy.",little company watcher spring foot accord listen flung window storm burst room vehemence drench stand deafen one roar other sound hear heedless weather stand motionless head window listen false hope brother fancy

5,"For Wraysford to follow him was the work of an instant. Mr Rastle and Roach the porter did the same, while the others went hurriedly out into the passage to the hall door.  Close as they were to one another, Wraysford lost sight of Stephen for a moment in the blinding sleet which dashed full in their faces.  But he heard him shouting a few yards off, and was at his side the same moment.",follow work instant porter do same other go passage hall door close lose sight moment blind sleet dash full face hear shouting few yard side same moment

19,In an instant all four bounded forward and were once more lost in the storm.,instant bound lose storm 
20,"But they had hope, and every moment, a night like this, was precious. They groped down the garden walk, and towards the meadow, shouting as they went.  Then presently they halted again and listened.",have hope moment night precious grope garden walk meadow shouting go halt listen 
21,"Yes there was the call again, and nearer.  Thank Heaven! they were on the right track.  On they went once more.  Another shout!  Nearer still!",be call thank right track go shout

23,"""Try,"" said Mr Rastle, ""they may hear it.  Here, Roach, come and shout--one, two, three, and a--""",try say hear come shout 
24,"What a shout it was!  The wind got hold of it as if it had been a sparrow's twitter, and tossed it mockingly over their heads and far away behind them, who knows where?  ""It's no go,"" said Wraysford.  ""Hullo, here's the meadow ditch.  Hadn't we better follow it up and down?

29,"Oliver and Loman were crouching under a tree, the former without coat or waistcoat, which he had thrown round the shivering and now senseless form of his companion.",crouch tree former coat waistcoat throw shiver senseless form companion 
30,"It was no time for words, either of joy or explanation; time enough for that when every one was safe indoors.  Mr Rastle and Roach between them carried Loman, while Oliver, in scarcely better plight, was helped along by his brother and friend.",time word joy explanation time one safe carry good plight help brother friend

36,"It was some days before the true story of that terrible night could be told, and then Oliver only told it briefly.",day true story terrible night tell tell 
37,"Late in the afternoon, as he was about to turn back, he said, he heard from a farmer's boy that he had seen a stranger that morning asleep under a hedge about a mile off.  Vague as this information was, it decided Oliver at once to go forward, which he did.  As might have been expected, there was no trace of the ""stranger"" at the hedge, and no amount of searching along it could discover any clue.  Still, he did not like to turn back while a chance remained.  He went on towards Grandham, inquiring of everybody and looking everywhere.",afternoon about turn say hear farmer boy see stranger morning hedge mile vague information decide go expect be trace stranger hedge amount searching discover clue like turn chance remain go inquire look 
38,"At last--it was getting dusk--he entered a field across which ran a footpath which led direct to Grandham Green.  He was half way across, wondering if he could by any chance find a cart or vehicle of any kind to drive him back to Saint Dominic's, when at the other side of the field he suddenly caught sight of a figure getting up from under the hedge and moving quickly away.  He instantly and instinctively gave chase.  The other, seeing he was discovered, began to run too.  It was Loman.  Oliver called to him to stop, but he paid no heed.  He continued to run as long as he could, and then, like a hunted animal, turned at bay.",last get dusk enter field run footpath lead direct half wonder chance find cart vehicle kind drive other side field catch sight figure get hedge move give chase other see discover begin run call stop pay heed continue run hunt animal turn bay 
39,"Oliver told very few all that had passed when finally he did come up with the wanderer.  His first impression, judging from the unhappy boy's strange and excited manner, was that he had gone out of his mind.  He appeared reckless and desperate at first, and determined to resist all attempts to bring him back.  He would sooner die than go back to Saint Dominic's, he said.  What right had Oliver to interfere with him and dog him in this way?  He had a right to go where he chose, and no one should stop him.  Oliver let him talk on, not attempting to reply, and avoiding all appearance of using force to detain him.",tell few pass come wanderer first impression judge unhappy boy strange excited manner go mind appear reckless desperate first determined resist attempt bring die go say right have interfere dog way have right go choose stop let talk attempt reply avoid appearance use force detain 
40,"This wise policy had its effect.  In time the poor fellow, who was really suffering more from hunger and fatigue (he had not had a morsel of food since the afternoon before) than from anything else, quieted down, and gave up further resistance.  Oliver told him, in as few words as he could, of the distress which his disappearance had caused at Saint Dominic's and to his parents, and besought him to return quietly, promising forgiveness for the past, and undertaking that all would be made right if he would only come home.",wise policy have effect time poor fellow suffer more hunger fatigue have morsel food afternoon else quiet give further resistance tell few word distress disappearance cause parent besig return promise forgiveness past undertake make right come 
41,"Loman listened to all doggedly.  ""You're humbugging me!"" he said.  ""You know I stole that paper?""",listen humbugg say know steal paper 
42,"""Oh, don't talk of that!"" cried Oliver.  ""Do come back!""",talk cry come 
43,"""You know--can't you get me something to eat?""",know get eat 
44,"As he said this he sunk down with a groan upon the grass.  Oliver started wildly to rush to the nearest cottage.  As he did so, however, a doubt crossed his mind, and he said, ""You'll promise to wait here, will you?""",say sink groan grass start rush near cottage do doubt cross mind say promise wait 
45,"""Oh, yes! be quick.""",quick 
46,"Oliver flew on the wings of the wind towards the village.  There was a cottage a few hundred yards away.  As he neared it, he cast one look back.  The wretched boy was on his feet, hurrying away in an opposite direction.",fly wing wind village be cottage few yard near cast look wretched boy foot hurry opposite direction 
47,"Another chase ensued, though only a short one.  For Loman was in no condition to hold out long.  Oliver half led, half dragged him to Grandham, where at last he procured food, which the unhappy fugitive devoured ravenously.  Then followed another talk, far more satisfactory than the last.  Restored once more in body and mind, Loman consented without further demur to accompany Oliver back to Saint Dominic's, but not before he had unburdened his mind of all that was on it.",chase ensue short one condition hold half lead half drag last procure food unhappy fugitive devoure follow talk satisfactory last restore more body mind consent further demur accompany unburden mind 
48,"Oliver implored him not to do it now, to wait till he got back, and then to tell all to his father, not to him.  But the poor penitent was not to be put off.  Until he had confessed all he would not stir a foot back to the school.",implore do wait get tell father poor penitent put confess stir foot school 
49,"Then Oliver heard all that sad story with which the reader is now familiar.  How that first act of fraud about the rod had been the beginning of all this misery.  How Cripps had used his advantage to drive the boy from one wickedness and folly to another--from deceit to gambling, from gambling to debt, from debt to more deceit, and so on. How drinking, low company, and vicious habits had followed.  How all the while he was trying to keep up appearances at the school, though he saw that he was gradually becoming an object of dislike to his fellows.  How he had staked everything--his whole hope of getting free from Cripps--on the result of the Nightingale examination; and how, when the critical moment came, he yielded to the tempter and stole the paper.",hear sad story reader familiar first act fraud rod beginning misery use advantage drive boy wickedness folly deceit gambling gambling debt debt more deceit drink low company vicious habit follow try keep appearance school see become object dislike fellow stake whole hope get free result examination critical moment come yield tempter steal paper 
50,"""And you can fancy how punished I was when, after all, the Doctor missed the paper and altered the questions, Greenfield.  I was so taken aback that I didn't even answer as well as I could.  And then I lost the paper I had stolen--couldn't find it anywhere, and for weeks I was in constant terror lest it should turn up.  Then I saw the fellows were all suspecting you to be the thief, and you know how meanly I took advantage of that to hide my own guilt.  Oh, Greenfield, what a wretch, what a miserable wretch I have been!""",fancy punish miss paper alter question take answer lose paper steal find week constant terror turn see fellow suspect thief know take advantage hide own guilt wretch miserable wretch 
51,"""Poor fellow!"" said Oliver, with true sympathy.  ""But, I say, do let's be going back, it's getting late, and looks as if it might rain.""",poor fellow say true sympathy say let go get late look rain 
52,"""I _must_ tell you the rest, Greenfield, please.  You're the only fellow I can tell it to.  Somehow I think if I'd had a friend like you all the last year I shouldn't have gone wrong as I have.  How I used to envy you and Wraysford, always together, and telling one another your troubles! Well, of course, after the Nightingale exam, things were worse than ever.  I'd given Cripps a bill, you know, a promise to pay in September. I don't know anything about bills, but he made me sign it.  Of course I couldn't pay when it came due, and had to make all sorts of excuses and tell all sorts of lies to get him to give me more time; as if I was more likely to pay later on than then!  But, somehow, if I could only get the thing off my mind for the present, I felt that was all I cared about. He gave in at last, and I was able to pay it off bit by bit.  But I was in constant terror all that term of his coming up to Saint Dominic's. You know he did come once, at the football match against Landfield, and I thought I was done for.""",tell rest only fellow tell think have friend last year go wrong have use envy tell trouble course exam thing bad give bill know promise pay know bill make sign course pay come due have make sort excuse tell sort lie get give more time likely pay get thing mind present feel care give last able pay bit bit constant terror term come know come football match think do 
53,"Here Loman paused a moment, and Oliver, seeing that he was determined to tell his story to the end, waited patiently till he continued.",pause moment see determined tell story end wait continue 
54,"""Then there was that Waterston exam.  I fancied I might get that if I worked.  Ass that I was to think, after all my wasted time and sin, I had any chance against you or Wraysford!  I tried to work, but soon gave it up, and went on going down to the Cockchafer instead, to keep Cripps in good humour, till I was quite a regular there.  You know what a fearful hash I made of the exam.  I could answer nothing.  That very day Cripps had sent up to threaten to tell the Doctor everything unless I paid what I still owed.  I had paid off all the bill but eight pounds. I had got some of it from home, and some of it by gambling; I'd paid off all but eight pounds.  You know, Greenfield, who lent me that.""",be exam fancy get work ass think waste time sin have chance try work give go go keep good humour regular know fearful hash make exam answer day send threaten tell doctor pay owe pay bill pound get home gambling pay pound know loan

56,"""If you'd known how I hated you and despised myself over that eight pounds you would hardly have been glad.  Everything was hateful.  I took the money down to Cripps and paid it him.  He pretended at first that he wouldn't take it; and then when he did, and I asked him to give me back my promissory note, he laughed at me.  I nearly went mad, Greenfield, at the thought of not being clear after all.  At length he did make believe to give in, and produced what I thought was the bill, and tore it up in my presence.  I couldn't see it, but he read it out aloud, and I had no doubt it was actually the thing.  I was so grateful I actually felt happy.  But then came the discovery of that miserable exam paper.  I must have left it in my Juvenal last September, and forgotten all about it.  I was certain the Doctor knew quite well I was the thief, but I denied it and tried feebly to put it on you.  Then everybody cut me; but I hoped still all might blow over in time.  But every day it became harder to bear; I should have had to confess at last, I believe.  Then came Cripps's final villainy.  He had never destroyed my bill after all, but now calmly claimed the whole amount.""",know hate despise pound glad hateful take money pay pretend first take ask give promissory note laugh go mad thought clear length make believe give produce think bill tore presence see read have doubt thing grateful feel happy come discovery miserable exam paper leave last forget certain know thief deny try put cut hope blow time day become hard bear have confess last believe come final villainy destroy bill claim whole amount

58,"""I had no receipts to show what I had paid, and of course was at his mercy.  This last move really drove me half crazy.  I daren't tell any one about it.  I was too desperate to think of anything but running away and hiding somewhere.  I had no money.  I came to you with a lie to try to borrow a pound, so that I might go somewhere by train.

61,"Loman was in no condition for walking, nor, indeed, was Oliver, who had been on his feet since early morning.  A farmer's cart was with some difficulty found, which happened to be going a good part of the distance, and in this the two boys late that afternoon ensconced themselves.  They talked little at first, and presently not at all. Each had his own thoughts, and they were serious enough to occupy them for a much longer journey.",condition walking foot early morning farmer cart difficulty find happen go good part distance boy late afternoon ensconce talk little have own thought serious occupy long journey 
62,"Night fell presently, soon after they had started, and with it the rain and wind came heavily.  There was little enough protection for these two worn-out ones in an empty open cart, but what they could get from an old wrap and some boards they secured.",night fall start rain wind come be little enough protection wear one empty open cart get old wrap board secure 
63,"As the storm grew worse this poor shelter became quite useless, and the two boys suffered all the horrors of a bitter exposure.",storm grow bad poor shelter become useless boy suffer horror bitter exposure 
64,"Loman, who had got a cough already, was the first to show distress, and he soon became so cold and numbed that Oliver grew alarmed.  They would be better walking than sitting still in that jolting cart a night like this.",get cough first show distress become cold numb grow alarm good walk sit jolt cart night 
65,"So, much against their own inclination and the advice of the carman, who characterised the proceedings as ""tomfoolery,"" they alighted, and attempted to take the short cut across the fields to Saint Dominic's.",much own inclination advice carman characterise proceedings tomfoolery alight attempt take short cut field 
66,"Short cut, indeed!  It was indeed a sarcastic name for the road those two boys took that terrible night.  Oliver could never recollect all that happened those few hours.  He was conscious of the tremendous storm, of the hopeless losing of their way, and of Loman's relapse into a state of half-unconsciousness, in the midst of which he constantly begged to be allowed to lie down and sleep.",short cut sarcastic name road boy take terrible night recollect happen few hour conscious tremendous storm hopeless lose way relapse state half unconsciousness midst begg allow lie sleep 
67,"To prevent this was Oliver's principal occupation during that fearful time.  More than once he was forced into a hand-to-hand struggle to keep his companion from his purpose.  To let him lie down and sleep on such a night would be, he knew, to leave him to certain death.  At any cost he must be kept moving.  At last the storm fairly vanquished them.  Even Oliver began to grow half-hearted in his determination.  He took off his own coat and waistcoat and pat them on his comrade, who by this time was stupid with cold and exhaustion.  A few minutes longer and both might have given themselves up, when suddenly there flickered a light before them.  All Oliver could do was to shout.  He had no power left to drag Loman farther, and leave him he would not.  He shouted, and the reader knows who heard that shout, and what the answer was.",prevent principal occupation fearful time more force hand hand struggle keep companion purpose let lie sleep night know leave certain death cost keep move last storm vanquish begin grow half hearted determination take own coat waistcoat pat comrade time stupid cold exhaustion few minute give flicker light do shout have power leave drag leave shout reader know hear shout answer 
68,"Such was Oliver's story, and it needed little amplification.  If it had, the only boy who could have added to it was in no position to do so. For four weeks after that night Loman lay ill with rheumatic fever, so ill that more than once those who watched him despaired of his recovery. But he did recover, and left Saint Dominic's a convalescent, and, better still, truly penitent, looking away from self and his own poor efforts to Him, the World's Great Burden Bearer, whose blood ""cleanseth us from all sin.""",such story need little amplification have only boy add position do week night lay ill rheumatic fever ill more watch despair recovery recover leave convalescent penitent look self own poor effort great blood cleanseth sin
