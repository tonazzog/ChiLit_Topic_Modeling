2,"     Yet burns the sun on high beyond the cloud;      Each in his southern cave,      The warm winds linger, but to be allowed      One breathing o’er the wave,      One flight across the unquiet sky;      Swift as a vane may turn on high,      The smile of heaven comes on.      So waits the Lord behind the veil,      His light on frenzied cheek, or pale,      To shed when the dark hour is gone.                               --LYRA INNOCENTIUM",burn sun high cloud southern cave warm wind linger allow breathe wave flight unquiet sky vane turn high smile heaven come wait veil light frenzied cheek pale shed dark hour gone 
3," On the afternoon on which Guy expected an answer from Mr. Edmonstone, he walked with his fellow pupil, Harry Graham, to see if there were any letters from him at Dr. Henley’s.",afternoon expect answer walk fellow pupil see be letter 
4,"The servant said Mrs. Henley was at home, and asked them to come in and take their letters. These were lying on a marble table, in the hall; and while the man looked in the drawing-room for his mistress, and sent one of the maids up-stairs in quest of her, Guy hastily took up one, bearing his address, in the well-known hand of Mr. Edmonstone.",servant say home ask come take letter lie marble table hall man look draw room mistress send maid stair quest guy take bear address know hand 
5,"Young Graham, who had taken up a newspaper, was startled by Guy’s loud, sudden exclamation,--’",young take newspaper startle loud sudden exclamation 
6,‘Ha! What on earth does this mean?’,earth mean 
7,"And looking up, saw his face of a burning, glowing red, the features almost convulsed, the large veins in the forehead and temples swollen with the blood that rushed through them, and if ever his eyes flashed with the dark lightning of Sir Hugh’s, it was then.",look see face burn glow red feature convulse large vein forehead temple swollen blood rush eye flash dark lightning 
8,‘Morville! What’s the matter?’,matter 
9,"‘Intolerable!--insulting! Me? What does he mean?’ continued Guy, his passion kindling more and more. ‘Proofs? I should like to see them! The man is crazy! I to confess! Ha!’ as he came towards the end, ‘I see it,--I see it. It is Philip, is it, that I have to thank. Meddling coxcomb! I’ll make him repent it,’ added he, with a grim fierceness of determination. Slandering me to them! And that,’--looking at the words with regard to Amy,--‘that passes all. He shall see what it is to insult me!’",intolerable insulting mean continue guy passion kindle more more proof like see man crazy confess come end see see have thank meddling coxcomb make repent add grim fierceness determination slander look word regard pass see insult 
10,‘What is it? Your guardian out of humour?’ asked his companion.,guardian humour ask companion 
11,"‘My guardian is a mere weak fool. I don’t blame him,--he can’t help it; but to see him made a tool of! He twists him round his finger, abuses his weakness to insult--to accuse. But he shall give me an account!’",guardian mere weak fool blame help see make tool twist finger abuse weakness insult accuse give account 
12,"Guy’s voice had grown lower and more husky; but though the sound sunk, the force of passion rather increased than diminished; it was like the low distant sweep of the tempest as it whirls away, preparing to return with yet more tremendous might. His colour, too, had faded to paleness, but the veins were still swollen, purple, and throbbing, and there was a stillness about him that made his wrath more than fierce, intense, almost appalling.",guy voice grow low husky sound sink force passion increase diminish low distant sweep tempest whirl prepare return tremendous colour fade paleness vein swollen purple throbb be stillness make wrath more fierce intense appalling 
13,"Harry Graham was dumb with astonishment; but while Guy spoke, Mrs. Henley had come down, and was standing before them, beginning a greeting. The blood rushed back into Guy’s cheeks, and, controlling his voice with powerful effort, he said,--",dumb astonishment speak come stand begin greeting blood rush cheek control voice powerful effort say 
14,"‘I have had an insulting--an unpleasant letter,’ he added, catching himself up. ‘You must excuse me;’ and he was gone.",have insulting unpleasant letter add catching excuse gone 
15,"‘What has happened?’ exclaimed Mrs. Henley, though, from her brother’s letter, as well as from her observations during a long and purposely slow progress, along a railed gallery overhanging the hall, and down a winding staircase, she knew pretty well the whole history of his anger.",happen exclaim brother letter observation long slow progress rail gallery overhang hall wind staircase know whole history anger 
16,"‘I don’t know,’ said young Graham. ‘Some absurd, person interfering between him and his guardian. I should be sorry to be him to fall in his way just now. It must be something properly bad. I never saw a man in such a rage. I think I had better go after him, and see what he has done with himself.’",know say young absurd person interfere guardian sorry fall way bad see man rage think good go see do 
17,"‘You don’t think,’ said Mrs. Henley, detaining him, ‘that his guardian could have been finding fault with him with reason?’",think say detain guardian find fault reason 
18,"‘Who? Morville? His guardian must have a sharp eye for picking holes, if he can find any in Morville. Not a steadier fellow going,--only too much so.’",guardian have sharp eye pick hole find steady fellow go much 
19,"‘Ah!’ thought Mrs. Henley, ‘these young men always hang together;’ and she let him escape without further question. But, when he emerged from the house, Guy was already out of sight, and he could not succeed in finding him.",think young man hang let escape further question emerge house sight succeed find 
20,"Guy had burst out of the house, feeling as if nothing could relieve him but free air and rapid motion; and on he hurried, fast, faster, conscious alone of the wild, furious tumult of rage and indignation against the maligner of his innocence, who was knowingly ruining him with all that was dearest to him, insulting him by reproaches on his breaking a most sacred, unblemished word, and, what Guy felt scarcely less keenly, forcing kind-hearted Mr. Edmonstone into a persecution so foreign to his nature. The agony of suffering such an accusation, and from such a quarter,--the violent storm of indignation and pride,--wild, undefined ideas of a heavy reckoning,--above all, the dreary thought of Amy denied to him for ever,--all these swept over him, and swayed him by turns, with the dreadful intensity belonging to a nature formed for violent passions, which had broken down, in the sudden shock, all the barriers imposed on them by a long course of self-restraint.",guy burst house feel relieve free air rapid motion hurry fast fast conscious alone wild furious tumult rage indignation maligner innocence ruin dearest insult reproache break sacred unblemished word guy feel force kind hearted persecution foreign nature agony suffer accusation quarter violent storm indignation pride wild undefined idea heavy reckoning dreary thought deny sweep sway turn dreadful intensity belong nature form violent passion break sudden shock barrier impose long course self restraint 
21,"On he rushed, reckless whither he went, or what he did, driven forward by the wild impulse of passion, far over moor and hill, up and down, till at last, exhausted at once by the tumult within, and by the violent bodily exertion, a stillness--a suspension of thought and sensation--ensued; and when this passed, he found himself seated on a rock which crowned the summit of one of the hills, his handkerchief loosened, his waistcoat open, his hat thrown off, his temples burning and throbbing with a feeling of distraction, and the agitated beatings of his heart almost stifling his panting breath.",rush reckless go drive wild impulse passion moor hill last exhaust tumult violent bodily exertion stillness suspension thought sensation ensue pass find seat rock crown summit hill handkerchief loosen waistcoat open hat throw temple burn throbb feeling distraction agitate beating heart stifling panting breath 
22,"‘Yes,’ he muttered to himself, ‘a heavy account shall he pay me for this crowning stroke of a long course of slander and ill-will! Have I not seen it? Has not he hated me from the first, misconstrued every word and deed, though I have tried, striven earnestly, to be his friend,--borne, as not another soul would have done, with his impertinent interference and intolerable patronizing airs! But he has seen the last of it! anything but this might be forgiven; but sowing dissension between me and the Edmonstones--maligning me there. Never! Knowing, too, as he seems to do, how I stand, it is the very ecstasy of malice! Ay! this very night it shall be exposed, and he shall be taught to beware--made to know with whom he has to deal.’",mutter heavy account pay crown stroke long course slander ill see hate first misconstrue word deed try strive friend borne soul do impertinent interference intolerable patronizing air see last forgive sow dissension malign know seem do stand very ecstasy malice very night expose teach beware make know have deal 
23,"Guy uttered this last with teeth clenched, in an excess of deep, vengeful ire. Never had Morville of the whole line felt more deadly fierceness than held sway over him, as he contemplated his revenge, looked forward with a dire complacency to the punishment he would wreak, not for this offence alone, but for a long course of enmity. He sat, absorbed in the plan of vengeance, perfectly still, for his physical exhaustion was complete; but as the pulsations of his heart grew less wild, his purpose became sterner and more fixed. He devised its execution, planned his sudden journey, saw himself bursting on Philip early next morning, summoning him to answer for his falsehoods. The impulse to action seemed to restore his power over his senses. He looked round, to see where he was, raising his head from his hands.",guy utter last tooth clench excess deep vengeful ire have whole line feel deadly fierceness hold sway contemplate revenge look dire complacency punishment wreak offence alone long course enmity sit absorb plan vengeance physical exhaustion complete pulsation heart grow wild purpose become sterner fix devise execution plan sudden journey see burst next morning summon answer falsehood impulse action seem restore power sense look see raise head hand 
24,"The sun was setting opposite to him, in a flood of gold,--a ruddy ball, surrounded with its pomp of clouds, on the dazzling sweep of horizon. That sight recalled him not only to himself, but to his true and better self; the good angel so close to him for the twenty years of his life, had been driven aloof but for a moment, and now, either that, or a still higher and holier power, made the setting sun bring to his mind, almost to his ear, the words,--",sun set flood gold ruddy ball surround pomp cloud dazzle sweep horizon sight recall true good self good angel close year life drive aloof moment high holy power make setting sun bring mind ear word 
25,"          Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,           Neither give place to the devil.",let sun go wrath give place devil 
26,"Guy had what some would call a vivid imagination, others a lively faith. He shuddered, then, his elbows on his knees, and his hands clasped over his brow, he sat, bending forward, with his eyes closed, wrought up in a fearful struggle; while it was to him as if he saw the hereditary demon of the Morvilles watching by his side, to take full possession of him as a rightful prey, unless the battle was fought and won before that red orb had passed out of sight. Yes, the besetting fiend of his family--the spirit of defiance and resentment--that was driving him, even now, while realizing its presence, to disregard all thoughts save of the revenge for which he could barter everything--every hope once precious to him.",guy have call vivid imagination other lively faith shudder elbow knee hand clasp brow sit bending eye close wring fearful struggle see hereditary demon watch side take full possession rightful prey battle fight win red orb pass sight besett fiend family spirit defiance resentment drive realize presence disregard thought save revenge barter hope precious 
27,"It was horror at such wickedness that first checked him, and brought him back to the combat. His was not a temper that was satisfied with half measures. He locked his hands more rigidly together, vowing to compel himself, ere he left the spot, to forgive his enemy--forgive him candidly--forgive him, so as never again to have to say, ‘I forgive him!’ He did not try to think, for reflection only lashed up his sense of the wrong: but, as if there was power in the words alone, he forced his lips to repeat,--",horror such wickedness check bring combat temper satisfy half measure lock hand vow compel leave spot forgive enemy forgive forgive have say forgive try think reflection lash sense wrong be power word force lip repeat 
28,"‘Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.’",forgive trespass forgive trespass 
29,"Coldly and hardly were they spoken at first; again he pronounced them, again, again,--each time the tone was softer, each time they came more from the heart. At last the remembrance of greater wrongs, and worse revilings came upon him, his eyes filled with tears, the most subduing and healing of all thoughts--that of the great Example--became present to him; the foe was driven back.",speak first pronounce time tone softer time come heart last remembrance great wrong bad reviling come eye fill tear subdue healing thought great example become present foe drive 
30,"Still he kept his hands over his face. The tempter was not yet defeated without hope. It was not enough to give up his first intention (no great sacrifice, as he perceived, now that he had time to think how Philip would be certain to treat a challenge), it was not enough to wish no ill to his cousin, to intend no evil measure, he must pardon from the bottom of his heart, regard him candidly, and not magnify his injuries.",keep hand face tempter defeat hope enough give first intention great sacrifice perceive have time think certain treat challenge enough wish ill cousin intend evil measure pardon bottom heart regard magnify injury 
31,"He sat long, in deep thought, his head bent down, and his countenance stern with inward conflict. It was the hardest part of the whole battle, for the Morville disposition was as vindictive as passionate; but, at last, he recovered clearness of vision. His request might well appear unreasonable, and possibly excite suspicion, and, for the rest, it was doing a man of honour, like Philip, flagrant injustice to suspect him of originating slanders. He was, of course, under a mistake, had acted, not perhaps kindly, but as he thought, rightly and judiciously, in making his suspicions known. If he had caused his uncle to write provokingly, every one knew that was his way, he might very properly wish, under his belief, to save Amabel; and though the manner might have been otherwise, the proceeding itself admitted complete justification. Indeed, when Guy recollected the frenzy of his rage, and his own murderous impulse, he was shocked to think that he had ever sought the love of that pure and gentle creature, as if it had been a cruel and profane linking of innocence to evil. He was appalled at the power of his fury, he had not known he was capable of it, for his boyish passion, even when unrestrained, had never equalled this, in all the strength of early manhood.",sit deep thought head bend countenance stern inward conflict hard part whole battle disposition vindictive passionate last recover clearness vision request appear unreasonable excite suspicion rest do man honour flagrant injustice suspect originate slander course mistake act think make suspicion know cause uncle write one know way wish belief save manner proceeding admit complete justification recollect frenzy rage own murderous impulse shocked think seek love pure gentle creature cruel profane link innocence evil appall power fury know capable boyish passion unrestrained equall strength early manhood 
32,"He looked up, and saw that the last remnant of the sun’s disk was just disappearing beneath the horizon. The victory was won!",look see last remnant sun disk disappear horizon victory win 
33,"But Guy’s feeling was not the rejoicing of the conquest, it was more the relief which is felt by a little child, weary of its fit of naughtiness, when its tearful face is raised, mournful yet happy, in having won true repentance, and it says, ‘I _am_ sorry now.’",guy feeling rejoicing conquest relief feel little child weary fit naughtiness tearful face raise mournful happy win true repentance say sorry 
34,"He rose, looked at his watch, wondered to find it so late; gazed round, and considered his bearings, perceiving, with a sense of shame, how far he had wandered; then retraced his steps slowly and wearily, and did not reach South Moor till long after dark.",rise look watch wonder find late gaze consider bearing perceive sense shame wander retrace step reach dark
