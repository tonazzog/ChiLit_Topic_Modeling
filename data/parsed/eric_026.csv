4,"The landlord of the Jolly Herring had observed during his visits to Eric, that at mid-day the studies were usually deserted, and the doors for the most part left unlocked. He very soon determined to make use of this knowledge for his own purposes, and as he was well acquainted with the building (in which for a short time he had been a servant), he laid his plans without the least dread of discovery.",landlord observe visit mid-day study desert door most part leave unlock determine make use knowledge own purpose acquainted building short time servant lay plan least dread discovery 
5,"There was a back entrance into Roslyn school behind the chapel, and it could be reached by a path through the fields without any chance of being seen, if a person set warily to work and watched his opportunity. By this path Billy came, two days after his last visit, and walked straight up the great staircase, armed with the excuse of business with Eric in case any one met or questioned him. But no one was about, since between twelve and one the boys were pretty sure to be amusing themselves out of doors; and after glancing into each of the studies, Billy finally settled on searching Montagu's (which was the neatest and best furnished), to see what he could get.",be back entrance school chapel reach path field chance see person set work watch opportunity path come day last visit walk great staircase armed excuse business case one meet question boy sure amusing door glance study settle search neatest furnish see get 
6,"The very first thing which caught his experienced eye was the cricket-fund box, with the key temptingly in the lock, just where Eric had left it when the sounds of some one coming had startled him. In a moment Billy had made a descent on the promising-looking booty, and opening his treasure, saw, with lively feelings of gratification, the unexpected store of silver and gold. This he instantly transferred to his own pocket, and then replacing the box where he had found it, decamped with the spoil unseen, leaving the study in all other respects exactly as he had found it.",very first thing catch experienced eye cricket fund box key lock leave sound one come startle moment make descent promising look booty open treasure see lively feeling gratification unexpected store silver gold transfer own pocket replace box find decamp spoil unseen leave study other respect find 
7,"Meanwhile the unhappy Eric was tossed and agitated with apprehension and suspense. Unable to endure his misery in loneliness, he had made several boys to a greater or less degree participators in the knowledge of his difficult position, and in the sympathy which his danger excited, the general nature of his dilemma with Billy (though not its special circumstances) was soon known through the school.",unhappy toss agitate apprehension suspense unable endure misery loneliness make several boy great less degree participator knowledge difficult position sympathy danger excite general nature dilemma special circumstance know school

9,"The other two were trying to console him. They suggested every possible topic of hope; but it was too plain that there was nothing to be said, and that Eric had real cause to fear the worst. Yet though their arguments were futile, he keenly felt the genuineness of their affection, and it brought a little alleviation to his heavy mood.",other try console suggest possible topic hope plain be say have real cause fear bad argument futile feel genuineness affection bring little alleviation heavy mood

19,"""Come now, Eric,"" said Wildney, ""I've got something to propose. You shall play cricket to-day; you haven't played for an age, and it's high time you should.

25,"So that afternoon Eric, for the first time since Verny's death, played with the first eleven, of which he had been captain. The school cheered him vigorously as he appeared again on the field, and the sound lighted up his countenance with some gleam of its old joyousness. When one looked at him that day with his straw hat on and its neat light-blue ribbon, and the cricket dress (a pink jersey and leather belt, with a silver clasp in front), showing off his well-built and graceful figure, one little thought what an agony was gnawing like a serpent at his heart. But that day, poor boy, in the excitement of the game he half forgot it himself, and more and more as the game went on.",afternoon first time death play first captain school cheer appear field sound light countenance gleam old joyousness look day straw hat neat light blue ribbon cricket dress pink jersey leather belt silver clasp front show build graceful figure little think agony gnaw serpent heart day poor boy excitement game half forget more more game go 
26,"The other side, headed by Montagu, went in first, and Eric caught out two, and bowled several. Montagu was the only one who stayed in long, and when at last Eric sent his middle wicket flying with a magnificent ball, the shouts of ""well bowled! well bowled _indeed_,"" were universal.",other side head go catch bowl several only one stay long last send middle wicket fly magnificent ball shout bowl bowl universal

30,"And now it was Eric's turn to go in. It was long since he had stood before the wicket, but now he was there, looking like a beautiful picture as the sunlight streamed over him, and made his fair hair shine like gold. In the triumph of success his sorrows were flung to the winds, and his blue eyes sparkled with interest and joy.",turn go long stand wicket look beautiful picture sunlight stream make fair hair shine gold triumph success sorrow flung wind blue eye sparkle interest joy

37,"What had come over Eric? if there had been a sudden breath of poison in the atmosphere he could hardly have been more affected than he was by Montagu's simple remark. Montagu could not help noticing it, but at the time merely attributed it to some unknown gust of feeling, and made no comment. But Eric, hastily borrowing another bat, took his place again quite tamely; he was trembling, and at the very next ball, he spooned a miserable catch into Graham's hand, and the shout of triumph from the other side proclaimed that his innings was over.",come be sudden breath poison atmosphere affect simple remark help notice time attribute unknown gust feeling make comment borrowing bat take place tremble very next ball spoon miserable catch hand shout triumph other side proclaim inning 
38,"He walked dejectedly to the pavilion for his coat, and the boys, who were seated in crowds about it, received him, of course, after his brilliant score, with loud and continued plaudits.

84,"The three sat there till prayer-time taciturn and thoughtful. Their books were open, but they did little work, and it was evident that Montagu was filled with the most touching grief.

""Oh Eric! can that face be the face of a thief?""",sit prayer time taciturn thoughtful book open do little work evident fill touch grief evening draw little likeness give look possible think face face thief

86,"He couldn't help observing that as he entered he was the object of general attention; but he attributed it either to his playing that day, or to the circumstances in which he was placed by Billy's treachery, of which he knew that many boys were now aware. But when prayers were over, and he saw that every one shunned him, or looked and spoke in the coldest manner, his most terrible fears revived.",help observe enter object general attention attribute playing day circumstance place treachery know many boy aware prayer see one shunn look speak coldest manner terrible fear revive

100,"Duncan left the room, and Montagu sat down beside Eric on the bed, and put his arm round him to support him, for he shook violently. There, with deep and wild emotion, and many interruptions of passionate silence, Eric told to Montagu his miserable tale. ""I am the most wretched fellow living,"" he said; ""there must be some fiend that hates me, and drives me to ruin. But let it all come; I care nothing, nothing, what happens to me now.

102,"Eric felt terribly alone. He knelt down and tried to pray, but somehow it didn't seem as if the prayer came from his heart, and his thoughts began instantly to wander far away. Still he knelt--knelt even until his candle had gone out, and he had nearly fallen asleep, thought-wearied, on his knees. And then he got into bed still dressed. He had been making up his mind that he could bear it no longer, and would run away to sea that night.",feel alone knolt try pray seem prayer come heart thought begin wander knolt knolt candle go fall asleep think weary knee get bed dress make mind bear run sea night 
103,"He waited till eleven, when Dr. Rowlands took his rounds. The Doctor had been told all the circumstances of suspicion, and they amounted in his mind to certainty. It made him very sad, and he stopped to look at the boy from whom he had parted on such friendly terms so short a time before. Eric did not pretend to be asleep, but opened his eyes, and looked at the head-master. Very sorrowfully Dr. Rowlands shook his head, and went away. Eric never saw him again.",wait take round tell circumstance suspicion amount mind certainty make sad stop look boy part such friendly term short time pretend asleep open eye look head master shake head go see 
104,"The moment he was gone Eric got up. He meant to go to his study, collect the few presents, which were his dearest mementos of Russell, Wildney, and his other friends--above all, Vernon's likeness--and then make his escape from the building, using for the last time the broken pane and loosened bar in the corridor, with which past temptations had made him so familiar.",moment gone get mean go study collect few present dearest memento other friend likeness make escape building use last time break pane loosen bar corridor past temptation make familiar

106,"""Ha!"" thought the boy, ""then he, too, knows and suspects. Never mind.

But they shan't prevent me from running away.""",think boy know suspect mind give treasure poor picture good disgrace noble memory prevent run 
107,"Once more he deliberated. Yes, there could be no doubt about the decision. He _could_, not endure another public expulsion, or even another birching; he _could_ not endure the cold faces of even his best friends. No, no! he _could_ not face the horrible phantom of detection, and exposure, and shame. Escape he must.",more deliberate be doubt decision _could endure public expulsion birching endure cold face good friend face horrible phantom detection exposure shame escape 
108,"After using all his strength in long-continued efforts, he succeeded in loosening the bar of his bed-room window. He then took his two sheets, tied them together in a firm knot, wound one end tightly round the remaining bar, and let the other fall down the side of the building. He took one more glance round his little room, and then let himself down by the sheet, hand under hand, until he could drop to the ground. Once safe, he ran towards Starhaven as fast as he could, and felt as if he were flying for his life. But when he got to the end of the playground he could not help stopping to take one more longing, lingering look at the scenes he was leaving for ever. It was a chilly and overclouded night, and by the gleams of struggling moonlight, he saw the whole buildings standing out black in the night air. The past lay behind him like a painting. Many and many unhappy or guilty hours had he spent in that home, and yet those last four years had not gone by without their own wealth of life and joy. He remembered how he had first walked across that playground, hand in hand with his father, a little boy of twelve. He remembered his first troubles with Barker, and how his father had at last delivered him from the annoyances of his old enemy. He remembered how often he and Russell had sat there, looking at the sea, in pleasant talk, especially the evening when he had got his first prize and head remove in the lower fourth; and how, in the night of Russell's death, he had gazed over that playground from the sick-room window. He remembered how often he had got cheered there for his feats at cricket and football, and how often he and Upton in old days, and he and Wildney afterwards, had walked there on Sundays, arm in arm. Then the stroll to Port Island, and Barker's plot against him, and the evening at the Stack passed through his mind; and the dinner at the Jolly Herring, and, above all, Vernon's death. Oh! how awful it seemed to him now, as he looked through the darkness at the very road along which they had brought Verny's dead body. Then his thoughts turned to the theft of the pigeons, his own drunkenness, and then his last cruel, cruel experiences, and this dreadful end of the day which, for an hour or two, had seemed _so_ bright on that very spot where he stood. Could it be that this (oh, how little he had ever dreamed of it)--that this was to be the conclusion of his school days?",use strength long continue effort succeed loosen bar bed room window take sheet tie firm knot wind end remain bar let other fall side building take more glance little room let sheet hand hand drop ground safe run feel fly life get end playground help stop take more longing linger look scene leave chilly overclouded night gleam struggle moonlight see whole building stand black night air past lay painting many many unhappy guilty hour spend home last year go own wealth life joy remember walk playground hand hand father little boy remember first trouble father deliver annoyance old enemy remember sit look sea pleasant talk evening get first prize head remove low fourth night death gaze playground sick room window remember cheer feat cricket football old day walk arm arm stroll plot evening pass mind dinner death awful seem look darkness very road bring dead body thought turn theft pigeon own drunkenness last cruel cruel experience dreadful end day hour seem bright very spot stand little dream conclusion school day 
109,"Yes, in those rooms, of which the windows fronted him, there they lay, all his schoolfellows--Montagu, and Wildney, and Duncan, and all whom he cared for best.

110,"Suddenly Mr. Rose's light moved, and, fearing discovery or interception, he roused himself from the bitter reverie and fled to Starhaven through the darkness. There was still a light in the little sailors' tavern; and, entering, he asked the woman who kept it, ""if she knew of any ship which was going to sail next morning?""",light move fear discovery interception rouse bitter reverie flead darkness be light little sailor tavern enter ask woman keep know ship go sail next morning
