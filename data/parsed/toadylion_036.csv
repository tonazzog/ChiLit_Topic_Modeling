1,CHAPTER XXXVI. HUGH JOHN'S WAY-GOING.,way go 
2," The secret which had oppressed society after the return of Mr. Picton Smith from London, being revealed, was that Hugh John and Sammy Carter were both to go to school. For a while it appeared as if the foundations of the world had been undercut--the famous fellowship of noble knights disbanded, Prissy and Cissy, ministering angel and wild tomboy, alike abandoned to the tender mercies of mere governesses.",secret have oppress society return reveal go school while appear foundation world undercut famous fellowship noble knight disband minister angel wild tomboy abandon tender mercie mere governess 
3,"Strangest of all to Prissy was the indubitable fact that Hugh John wanted to go. At the very first mention of school he promptly forgot all about his noblest military ambitions, and began oiling his cricket bat and kicking his football all over the green. Mr. Burnham was anxious about his pupil's Latin and more than doubtful about his Vulgar Fractions; but the General himself was chiefly bent on improving his round arm bowling, and getting that break from the left down to a fine point.",strangest indubitable fact want go very first mention school forget noblest military ambition begin oil cricket bat kick football green anxious pupil latin more doubtful vulgar bend improve round arm bowling get break left fine point 
4,"Every member of the household was more or less disturbed by the coming exodus--except Sir Toady Lion. On the last fateful morning that self-contained youth maundered about as usual among his pets, carrying to and fro saucers of milk, dandelion leaves cut small, and other dainties--though Hugh John's boxes were standing corded and labelled in the hall, though Prissy was crying herself sick on her bed, and though there was even a dry hard lump high up in the great hero's own manly throat.",member household disturb come exodus last fateful morning self contain youth maunder usual pet carry saucer milk dandelion leave cut small other dainty box stand cord label hall cry sick bed be dry hard lump high great hero own manly throat

6,"""Work hard, my boy,"" he said. ""Tell the truth, never tell tales, nor yet listen to them. Mind your own business. Don't fight, if you can help it; but if you have to, be sure you get home with your left before the other fellow. Practise your bowling, the batting will practise itself. And when you play golf, keep your eye on the ball.""",work boy say tell truth tell tale listen mind own business fight help have sure get left other fellow practise bowling batting practise play golf keep eye ball

9,"Then it was Prissy who came to say good-bye. She had made all sorts of good resolutions, but in less than half a minute she was bawling undisguisedly on the hero's neck. And as for the hero--well, we will not say what he was doing, something most particularly unheroic at any rate.",prissy come say good bye make sort good resolution less minute bawl hero neck hero say do unheroic rate 
10,"Janet Sheepshanks hovered in the background, saying all the time, ""For shame, Miss Priscilla, think shame o' yoursel'--garring the laddie greet like that when he's gaun awa'!""",hover background say time shame think shame garr laddie greet gaun awa 
11,"But even Janet herself was observed to blow her own nose very often, and to offer Hugh John the small garden hoe instead of the neatly wrapped new silk umbrella she had bought for him out of her own money.",observe blow own nose offer small garden hoe wrap new silk umbrella buy own money 
12,And all the while Sir Toady Lion kept on carrying milk and fresh lettuce leaves to his stupid lop-eared rabbits. Yet it was by no means insensibility which kept him thus busied. He was only playing his usual lone hand.,keep carry milk fresh lettuce leave stupid lop eared rabbit means insensibility keep busy play usual lone hand 
13,Yet even Toady Lion was not without his own proper sense of the importance of the occasion.,own proper sense importance occasion

15,"Immediately Hugh John slunk out, ran off in an entirely different direction, circled about the ""office houses,"" reached the stile behind the stable--and there, with her eyes very big, and her underlip quivering strangely, he discovered Cissy Carter.",slunk run different direction circle office house reach stile stable eye big underlip quivering discover 
16,"He stopped short and looked at her. The pressure of having to say farewell, or of making a stated speech of any kind, weighed heavily upon him. The two looked at each other like young wild animals--or as if they were children who had never been introduced, which is the same thing.",stop short look pressure have say farewell make state speech kind weigh look other young wild animal child introduce same thing 
17,"""Hugh John Picton, you don't care!"" sobbed Cissy at last. ""And I don't care either!"" she added haughtily, commanding herself after a pathetic little pause.",care sobb last care add commanding pathetic little pause

30,"Something lit on the end of Cissy's nose, which was very red and wet with the tears that had run down it. There was a clatter of feet, and the Lord of Creation had departed. Cissy sank down behind the stone wall, a slim bundle of limp woe, done up in blue serge trimmed with scarlet.",light end nose red wet tear run be clatter foot depart sink stone wall slim bundle limp woe do blue serge trim scarlet 
31,"The servants were gathered in the hall. Several of the maids were already wet-eyed, for Hugh John had ""the way with him"" that made all women want to ""mother"" him. Besides, he had no mother of his own.",servant gather hall several maid wet eyed have way make woman want mother have mother own

33,"""Good-bye, everybody,"" cried the hero, ""soon be back again, you know."" He said this very loudly to show that he did not care. He was going down the steps with Prissy's fingers clutched in his, and every one was smiling. All went merry as a marriage bell--never had been seen so jovial a way-going.",good cry hero know say show care go step finger clutch one smile go merry marriage bell see jovial way go 
34,"""_Ugh--ugh--ugh!_"" somebody in the hall suddenly sobbed out from among the white caps of the maids.",hall sobb white cap maid 
35,"""Go upstairs instantly, Jane. Don't disgrace yourself!"" cried Janet Sheepshanks sharply, stamping her foot. For the sound of Jane's sudden and shameful collapse sent the other maids' aprons furtively up to their eyes.",go disgrace cry stamp foot sound sudden shameful collapse send other maid apron eye 
36,And Janet Sheepshanks had no apron. Not that she needed one--of course not.,have apron need course

41,"He did not say a word till his brother was perched up aloft on the dog-cart with his cricket bat nursed between his knees and a new hard-hat pulled painfully over his eyes.

""Did 'oo find the funny fing behind the stable, Hugh John?""",say word brother perch dog cart cricket bat nurse knee new hard hat pull eye last speak find funny fing stable 
42,"Before Hugh John had time to reply, the dog-cart drove away amid sharp explosions of grief from the white-capped throng. Jane Housemaid dripped sympathy from a first-floor window till the gravel was wet as from a smart shower. Toady Lion alone stood on the steps with his usual expression of bored calmness. Then he turned to Prissy.",have time reply dog cart drive sharp explosion grief white cap throng dripp sympathy first floor window gravel wet smart shower stand step usual expression bored calmness turn

46,"""It was a _very_ funny fing w'at was behind the stable,"" he said. For Sir Toady Lion was a humorist. And you can't be a humorist without being a little hard-hearted.
