2, Their belief in the Magic was an abiding thing.  After the morning's incantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.,belief abide thing morning incantation give lecture 
3,"""I like to do it,"" he explained, ""because when I grow up and make great scientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise.  I can only give short lectures now because I am very young, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church and he would go to sleep.""",like do explain grow make great scientific discovery oblige lecture practise give short lecture young feel church go sleep

5,"But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes on him and kept them there.  He looked him over with critical affection.  It was not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs which looked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held itself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light he remembered in another pair.  Sometimes when Colin felt Ben's earnest gaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him.",hold tree old fix devour eye keep look critical affection lecture interest leg look straighter strong day boyish head hold sharp chin hollow cheek fill round eye begin hold light remember pair feel earnest gaze mean impressed wonder reflect seem entrance question

9,"That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture.  When he came he was ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than usual.  As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work.  They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain.  The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold.  Colin was as good at weeding as any one in these days and he could lecture while he was doing it.  ""The Magic works best when you work, yourself,"" he said this morning.  ""You can feel it in your bones and muscles.  I am going to read books about bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic.  I am making it up now.  I keep finding out things.""",morning late hear lecture come ruddy run funny face look twinkling usual have good deal weeding do rain fall work have plenty do warm deep sinking rain moisture good flower good weed thrust tiny blade grass point leave pull root take firm hold good weed one day lecture do work good work say morning feel bone muscle go read book bone muscle go write book make keep find thing 
10,"It was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his trowel and stood up on his feet.  He had been silent for several minutes and they had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did.  When he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it.  He stretched himself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly.  Color glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness.  All at once he had realized something to the full.",say lay trowel stand foot silent several minute see think lecture drop trowel stand seem sudden strong thought make do stretch tall height throw arm color glow face strange eye widen joyfulness realize full

21,"Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round at him.",work rose bush glance

29,Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it.  He understood what Colin felt better than Colin did himself.  He understood by a sort of instinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding.  He pulled off his cap and looked round still smiling.,simple unaffected understand feel good do understand sort instinct natural know understand pull cap look smile

31,Colin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair as he watched Dickon intently.

35,"""It is a very nice song,"" he said.  ""I like it.  Perhaps it means just what I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic."" He stopped and thought in a puzzled way.  ""Perhaps they are both the same thing.  How can we know the exact names of everything? Sing it again, Dickon.  Let us try, Mary.  I want to sing it, too.  It's my song.  How does it begin?

40,"The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had entered.  She had come in with the last line of their song and she had stood still listening and looking at them.  With the ivy behind her, the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak, and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather like a softly colored illustration in one of Colin's books.  She had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in--all of them, even Ben Weatherstaff and the ""creatures"" and every flower that was in bloom.  Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of them felt that she was an intruder at all.

Each of them kept looking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the delightful feeling she gave them--a sort of warm, supported feeling. It seemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his ""creatures."" She stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were children.  Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew upon her shoulder as if it were Dickon's.
