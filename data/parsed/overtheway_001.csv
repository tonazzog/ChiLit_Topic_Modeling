5,"The little old lady lived over the way, through a green gate that shut with a click, and up three white steps. Every morning at eight o'clock the church bell chimed for Morning Prayer--chim! chime! chim! chime!--and every morning at eight o'clock the little old lady came down the white steps, and opened the gate with a click, and went where the bells were calling.",little old lady live way green gate shut click white step morning o'clock church bell chime chim chime chime morning o'clock little old lady come white step open gate click go bell call 
6,"About this time also little Ida would kneel on a chair at her nursery window in the opposite house to watch the old lady come out and go. The old lady was one of those people who look always the same. Every morning her cheeks looked like faded rose-leaves, and her white hair like a snow-wreath in a garden laughing at the last tea-rose. Every morning she wore the same black satin bonnet, and the same white shawl; had delicate gloves on the smallest of hands, and gathered her skirt daintily up from the smallest of feet. Every morning she carried a clean pocket-handkerchief, and a fresh rose in the same hand with her Prayer-book; and as the Prayer-book, being bound up with the Bible, was very thick, she seemed to have some difficulty in so doing. Every morning, whatever the weather might be, she stood outside the green gate, and looked up at the sky to see if this were clear, and down at the ground to see if that were dry; and so went where the bells were calling.",time little kneel chair nursery window opposite house watch old lady come go old lady person look same morning cheek look fade rose leave white hair snow wreath garden laugh last tea-rose morning wear same black satin bonnet same white shawl have delicate glove small hand gather skirt small foot morning carry clean pocket handkerchief fresh rose same hand prayer book book bind thick seem have difficulty do morning weather stand green gate look sky see clear ground see dry go bell call 
7,"Ida knew the little old lady quite well by sight, but she did not know her name. Perhaps Ida's great-uncle knew it; but he was a grave, unsociable man, who saw very little of his neighbours, so perhaps he did not; and Ida stood too much in awe of him to trouble him with idle questions. She had once asked Nurse, but Nurse did not know; so the quiet orphan child asked no more. She made up a name for the little old lady herself, however, after the manner of Mr. John Bunyan, and called her Mrs. Overtheway; and morning after morning, though the bread-and-milk breakfast smoked upon the table, she would linger at the window, beseeching--",know little old lady sight know name great uncle know grave unsociable man see little neighbour stand much awe trouble idle question ask know quiet orphan child ask more make name little old lady manner call morning morning bread milk breakfast smoke table linger window beseech

9,"And when the little old lady had come out and gone, Ida would creep from her perch, and begin her breakfast. Then, if the chimes went on till half the basinful was eaten, little Ida would nod her head contentedly, and whisper--",little old lady come go creep perch begin breakfast chime go basinful eat little nod head whisper

11,"Little Ida's history was a sad one. Her troubles began when she was but a year old, with the greatest of earthly losses--for then her mother died, leaving a sailor husband and their infant child. The sea-captain could face danger, but not an empty home; so he went back to the winds and the waves, leaving his little daughter with relations. Six long years had he been away, and Ida had had many homes, and yet, somehow, no home, when one day the postman brought her a large letter, with her own name written upon it in a large hand. This was no old envelope sealed up again--no make-believe epistle to be put into the post through the nursery door: it was a real letter, with a real seal, real stamps, and a great many post-marks; and when Ida opened it there were two sheets written by the Captain's very own hand, in round fat characters, easy to read, with a sketch of the Captain's very own ship at the top, and--most welcome above all!--the news that the Captain's very own self was coming home.",little history sad one trouble begin year old great earthly loss mother die leave sailor husband infant child sea captain face danger empty home go wind wave leave little daughter relation long year have many home home day postman bring large letter own name write large hand old envelope seal make believe epistle put post nursery door real letter real seal real stamp great many post mark open be sheet write very own hand round fat character easy read sketch own ship top welcome news own self come 
12,"""I shall have a papa all to myself very soon, Nurse,"" said Ida. ""He has written a letter to me, and made me a picture of his ship; it is the 'Bonne Esperance,' which he says means Good Hope. I love this letter better than anything he has ever sent me.""",have papa say write letter make picture ship say mean good love letter good send 
13,"Nevertheless, Ida took out the carved fans and workboxes, the beads, and handkerchiefs, and feathers, the dainty foreign treasures the sailor-father had sent to her from time to time; dusted them, kissed them, and told them that the Captain was coming home. But the letter she wore in her pocket by day, and kept under her pillow by night.",take carve fan workboxe bead handkerchief feather dainty foreign treasure sailor father send time time dust kiss tell come letter wear pocket day keep pillow night

16,"It had need then to have been written on the rock, graven with an iron pen for ever; for the ""Bonne Esperance"" (like other earthly hopes) had perished to return no more. She foundered on her homeward voyage, and went down into the great waters, whilst Ida slept through the stormy night, with the Captain's letter beneath her pillow.",need write rock graven iron pen other earthly hope perish return more founder homeward voyage go great water sleep stormy night letter pillow

19,"Two or three months had now passed away since Ida became an orphan. She had become accustomed to the crape-hung frock; she had learnt to read the Captain's letter as the memorial of a good hope which it had pleased God to disappoint; she was fairly happy again. It was in the midst of that new desolation in her lonely life that she had come to stay with her great-uncle, and had begun to watch the doings of the little old lady who lived over the way. When dolls seemed vanity, and Noah's Ark a burden, it had been a quiet amusement, demanding no exertion, to see what little she could see of the old lady's life, and to speculate about what she could not; to wonder and fancy what Mrs. Overtheway looked like without her bonnet, and what she did with herself when she was not at church. Ida's imagination did not carry her far. She believed her friend to be old, immeasurably old, indefinitely old; and had a secret faith that she had never been otherwise. She felt sure that she wore a cap indoors, and that it was a nicer one than Nurse's; that she had real tea, with sugar and cream, instead of milk-and-water, and hot toast rather than bread-and-treacle for tea; that she helped herself at meals, and went to bed according to her own pleasure and convenience; was--perhaps on these very grounds--utterly happy, and had always been so.",month pass become orphan become accustom crape hang frock learn read letter memorial good hope pleased disappoint happy midst new desolation lonely life come stay great uncle begin watch doing little old lady live way doll seem vanity burden quiet amusement demand exertion see little see old lady life speculate wonder fancy look bonnet do church imagination carry believe friend old old old have secret faith feel sure wear cap nice one have real tea sugar cream milk water hot toast bread treacle tea help meal go bed accord own pleasure convenience very grounds happy 
20,"""I am only a little girl,"" said Ida, as she pressed her face sadly to the cold window-pane. ""I am only a little girl, and very sad, you know, because Papa was drowned at sea; but Mrs. Overtheway is very old, and always happy, and so I love her.""",little girl say press face cold window pane little girl sad know drown sea old happy love 
21,And in this there was both philosophy and truth.,be philosophy truth 
22,"It is a mistake to suppose that the happiness of others is always a distasteful sight to the sad at heart. There are times in which life seems shorn of interests and bereaved of pleasure, when it is a relief, almost amounting to consolation, to believe that any one is happy. It is some feeling of this nature, perhaps, which makes the young so attractive to the old. It soothes like the sound of harmonious music, the sight of harmonious beauty. It witnesses to a conviction lying deep even in the most afflicted souls that (come what may), all things were created good, and man made to be blessed; before which sorrow and sighing flee away.",mistake suppose happiness other distasteful sight sad heart be time life seem shorn interest bereaved pleasure relief amount consolation believe one happy feeling nature make young attractive old soothe sound harmonious music sight harmonious beauty witness conviction lie afflict soul come thing create good man make bless sorrow sighing flee 
23,"This was one of many things which formed the attraction for Ida in the little old lady who lived over the way. That green gate shut in a life of which the child knew nothing, and which might be one of mysterious delights; to believe that such things could be was consoling, and to imagine them was real entertainment. Ida would sometimes draw a chair quietly to the table beside her own, and fancy that Mrs. Overtheway was having tea with her. She would ask the old lady if she had been in time for church that morning, beg her to take off her bonnet, and apologise politely for the want of hot tea and toast. So far all was well, for Ida could answer any of these remarks on Mrs. Overtheway's behalf; but it may be believed that after a certain point this one-sided conversation flagged. One day Nurse overheard Ida's low murmurs.",many thing form attraction little old lady live way green gate shut life child know mysterious delight believe such thing consol imagine real entertainment draw chair table own fancy have tea ask old lady time church morning beg take bonnet apologise want hot tea toast well answer remark behalf believe certain point one sided conversation flagge day overhear low murmur

25,"""I am pretending to have Mrs. Overtheway to tea,"" said Ida.",pretend have tea say

""Play with your dolls, my dear, and don't move the chairs out of their places.""",little girl pretend true reply philosophy fancy falsehood distinguished play doll dear move chair place 
27,"With which Nurse carried off the chair into a corner as if it had been a naughty child, and Ida gave up her day-dream with a sigh; since to have prolonged the fancy that Mrs. Overtheway was present, she must have imagined her borne off at the crisis of the meal after a fashion not altogether consistent with an old lady's dignity.",carry chair corner naughty child give day dream sigh prolong fancy present imagine borne crisis meal fashion consistent old lady dignity 
28,"Summer passed, and winter came on. There were days when the white steps looked whiter than usual; when the snowdrift came halfway up the little green gate, and the snowflakes came softly down with a persistency which threatened to bury the whole town. Ida knew that on such days Mrs. Overtheway could not go out; but whenever it was tolerably fine the old lady appeared as usual, came daintily down the steps, and went where the bells were calling. Chim! chime! chim! chime! They sounded so near through the frosty air, that Ida could almost have fancied that the church was coming round through the snowy streets to pick up the congregation.",summer pass winter come be day white step look whit usual snowdrift come little green gate snowflake come persistency threaten bury whole town know such day go fine old lady appear usual come step go bell call chime chime sound frosty air fancy church come snowy street pick congregation 
29,"Mrs. Overtheway looked much the same in winter as in summer. She seemed as fresh and lively as ever, carried her Prayer-book and handkerchief in the same hand, was only more warmly wrapped up, and wore fur-lined boots, which were charming. There was one change, however, which went to Ida's heart. The little old lady had no longer a flower to take to church with her. At Christmas she took a sprig of holly, and after that a spray of myrtle, but Ida felt that these were poor substitutes for a rose. She knew that Mrs. Overtheway had flowers somewhere, it is true, for certain pots of forced hyacinths had passed through the little green gate to the Christmas church decorations; but one's winter garden is too precious to be cropped as recklessly as summer rose-bushes, and the old lady went flowerless to church and enjoyed her bulbs at home. But the change went to Ida's heart.",look same winter summer seem fresh lively carry prayer book handkerchief same hand wrap wear fur line boot charming be change go heart little old lady have flower take church take sprig holly spray myrtle feel poor substitute rose know have flower true certain pot force hyacinth pass little green gate church decoration winter garden precious croppe summer rise bush old lady go church enjoy bulb home change go heart

31,"""You may go and play in the garden, Miss Ida,"" said Nurse, and Ida went.",go play garden say go 
32,"She had been kept indoors for a long time by the weather and by a cold, and it was very pleasant to get out again, even when the only amusement was to run up and down the shingly walks and wonder how soon she might begin to garden, and whether the gardener could be induced to give her a piece of ground sufficiently extensive to grow a crop of mustard-and-cress in the form of a capital I. It was the kitchen garden into which Ida had been sent. At the far end it was cut off from the world by an overgrown hedge with large gaps at the bottom, through which Ida could see the high road, a trough for watering horses, and beyond this a wood. The hedge was very thin in February, and Ida had a good view in consequence, and sitting on a stump in the sunshine she peered through the gap to see if any horses came to drink. It was as good as a peep-show, and indeed much better.",keep long time weather cold pleasant get only amusement run shingly walk wonder begin garden gardener induce give piece ground extensive grow crop mustard cress form capital kitchen garden send far end cut world overgrown hedge large gap bottom see high road trough water horse wood hedge thin have good view consequence sit stump sunshine peer gap see horse come drink good peep show good 
33,"""The snow has melted,"" gurgled the water, ""here I am."" It was everywhere. The sunshine made the rich green mosses look dry, but in reality they were wet, and so was everything else. Slish! slosh! Put your feet where you would, the water was everywhere. It filled the stone trough, which, being old and grey and steady, kept it still, and bade it reflect the blue sky and the gorgeous mosses; but the trough soon overflowed, and then the water slipped over the side, and ran off in a wayside stream. ""Winter is gone!"" it spluttered as it ran. ""Winter is gone, winter-is-gone, winterisgone!"" And, on the principle that a good thing cannot be said too often, it went on with this all through the summer, till the next winter came and stopped its mouth with icicles. As the stream chattered, so the birds in the wood sang--Tweet! tweet! chirrup! throstle! Spring! Spring! Spring!--and they twittered from tree to tree, and shook the bare twigs with melody; whilst a single blackbird sitting still upon a bough below, sang ""Life!"" ""Life!"" ""Life!"" with the loudest pipe of his throat, because on such a day it was happiness only to be alive.",snow melt gurgle water sunshine make rich green mosse look dry reality wet else slosh put foot water fill stone trough old grey steady keep bid reflect blue sky gorgeous mosse trough overflow water slip side run wayside stream gone splutter run winter gone winter gone principle good thing say go summer next winter come stop mouth icicle stream chatter bird wood sing tweet chirrup spring spring spring twitter tree tree shake bare twig melody single blackbird sit bough sing life life life loudest pipe throat day happiness alive 
34,"It was like a wonderful fairy-tale, to which Ida listened with clasped hands.",wonderful fairy tale listen clasp hand 
35,"Presently another song came from the wood: it was a hymn sung by children's voices, such as one often hears carolled by a troop of little urchins coming home from school. The words fell familiarly on Ida's ears:",song come wood hymn sung child voice such hear caroll troop little urchin come school word fall ear

39,"Here the little chorus broke off, and the children came pouring out of the wood with chattering and laughter. Only one lingered, playing under a tree, and finishing the song. The child's voice rose shrill and clear like that of the blackbird above him. He also sang of Life--Eternal life--knowing little more than the bird of the meaning of his song, and having little less of that devotion of innocence in which happiness is praise.",little chorus break child come pour wood chattering laughter linger play tree finish song child voice rise shrill clear blackbird sing eternal life know little more bird meaning song have little less devotion innocence happiness praise 
40,"But Ida had ceased to listen to the singing. Her whole attention was given to the children as they scampered past the hedge, dropping bits of moss and fungi and such like woodland spoil. For, tightly held in the grubby hands of each--plucked with reckless indifference to bud and stalk, and fading fast in their hot prisons--were primroses. Ida started to her feet, a sudden idea filling her brain. The birds were right, Spring had come, and there were flowers--_flowers for Mrs. Overtheway_.",cease listen singing whole attention give child scamper hedge drop bit moss fungi such woodland spoil hold grubby hand pluck reckless indifference bud stalk fade hot prison primrose start foot sudden idea fill brain bird right spring come be flower _flower 
41,"Ida was a very quiet, obedient little girl, as a general rule; indeed, in her lonely life she had small temptation to pranks or mischief of any kind. She had often been sent to play in the back garden before, and had never thought of straying beyond its limits; but to-day a strong new feeling had been awakened by the sight of the primroses.",quiet obedient little girl general rule lonely life have small temptation prank mischief kind send play back garden think stray limit day strong new feeling awaken sight primrose

45,"""Where the head goes, the body will follow,"" they say, and Ida's little body was soon on the other side of the hedge; the adage says nothing about clothes, however, and part of Ida's dress was left behind. It had caught on the stump as she scrambled through. But accidents will happen, and she was in the road, which was something.",head go body follow say little body other side hedge adage say clothes part dress leave catch stump scramble accident happen road

47,"And into the wood she came. Dame Nature had laid down her new green carpets, and everything looked lovely; but, as has been before said, it certainly was damp.

52,"Ida went on and on, looking about her as she ran. Presently the wood sloped downwards, and pretty steeply, so that it was somewhat of a scramble; yet still she kept a sharp look-out, but no primroses did she see, except a few here and there upon the ground, which had been plucked too close to their poor heads to be held in anybody's hands. These showed the way, however, and Ida picked them up in sheer pity and carried them with her.",go look run wood slope scramble keep sharp look primrose see few ground pluck close poor head hold hand show way pick sheer pity carry

55,"Ida looked and hesitated. It was too wide to jump across, and here, as elsewhere, there was more water than usual. To turn back, however, was out of the question. Gerda would not have been daunted in her search by coming to a stream, nor would any one else that ever was read of in fairy tales. It is true that in Fairy-land there are advantages which cannot always be reckoned upon by commonplace children in this commonplace world. When the straw, the coal, and the bean came to a rivulet in their travels, the straw laid himself across as a bridge for the others, and had not the coal been a degree too hot on that unlucky occasion, they might (for anything Ida knew to the contrary) still have been pursuing their journey in these favourable circumstances. But a travelling-companion who expands into a bridge on an emergency is not to be met with every day; and as to poor Ida--she was alone. She stood first on one leg, and then on the other, she looked at the water, and then at the primroses, and then at the water again, and at last perceived that in one place there was a large, flat, moss-covered stone in the middle of the stream, which stood well out of the water, and from which--could she but reach it--she might scramble to the opposite bank. But how to reach it? that nice, large, secure, comfortable-looking stone.",look hesitate wide jump be more water usual turn question daunt search come stream one else read fairy tale true land be advantage reckon commonplace child commonplace world straw coal bean come rivulet travel straw lay bridge other coal degree hot unlucky occasion know contrary pursue journey favourable circumstance travelling companion expand bridge emergency meet day poor alone stand leg other look water primrose water last perceive place be large flat moss cover stone middle stream stand water reach scramble opposite bank reach nice large secure comfortable look stone 
56,"""I must put some more stones,"" thought Ida. There were plenty in the stream, and Ida dragged them up, and began to make a ford by piling them together. It was chilly work, for a cloud had come over the sun; and Ida was just a little bit frightened by the fresh-water shrimps, and some queer, many-legged beasts, who shot off the stones as she lifted them. At last the ford was complete. Ida stepped daintily over the bridge she had made, and jumped triumphantly on to the big stone. Alas! for trusting to appearances. The stone that looked so firm, was insecurely balanced below, and at the first shock one side went down with a splash, and Ida went with it. What a triumph for the shrimps! She scrambled to the bank, however, made up a charming bunch of primroses, and turned to go home. Never mind how she got back across the brook. We have all waded streams before now, and very good fun it is in June, but rather chilly work in February; and, in spite of running home, Ida trembled as much with cold as with excitement when she stood at last before Mrs. Overtheway's green gate.",put more stone think be plenty stream drag begin make ford pile chilly work cloud come sun little bit frighten fresh water shrimp queer many legged beast shoot stone lift last complete step bridge make jump big stone trust appearance stone look firm balance first shock side go splash go triumph shrimp scramble bank make charming bunch primrose turn go mind get brook wade stream good fun chilly work spite run home tremble much cold excitement stand last green gate

At least--"" Ida added, looking back across the road with a sudden confusion in her ideas, ""at least--I mean--you know--_we_ live over the way.""

69,"Chim! chime! went the bells next morning, and Mrs. Overtheway came down the white steps and through the green gate with a bunch of primroses in her hand. She looked up as usual, but not to the sky. She looked to the windows of the houses over the way, as if she expected some one to be looking for her. There was no face to be seen, however; and in the house directly opposite, one of the upper blinds was drawn down. Ida was ill.",chime go bell next morning come white step green gate bunch primrose hand look usual sky look window house way expect one look be face see house upper blind draw ill 
70,"How long she was ill, and of what was the matter with her, Ida had no very clear idea. She had visions of toiling through the wood over and over again, looking vainly for something that could never be found; of being suddenly surrounded and cut off by swollen streams; and of crawling, unclean beasts with preternatural feelers who got into her boots. Then these heavy dreams cleared away in part, and the stream seemed to ripple like the sound of church bells, and these chimed out the old tune",ill matter have clear idea have vision toil wood look find surround cut swollen stream crawl unclean beast preternatural feeler get boot heavy dream clear part stream seem ripple sound church bell chime old tune

75,"To be very ill is not pleasant; but the slow process of getting back strength is often less pleasant still. One afternoon Ida knelt in her old place at the window. She was up, but might not go out, and this was a great grief. The day had been provokingly fine, and even now, though the sun was setting, it seemed inclined to make a fresh start, so bright was the rejuvenated glow with which it shone upon the opposite houses, and threw a mystic glory over Mrs. Overtheway's white steps and green railings. Oh! how Ida had wished to go out that afternoon! How long and clear the shadows were! It seemed to Ida that whoever was free to go into the open air could have nothing more to desire. ""Out of doors"" looked like Paradise to the drooping little maid, and the passers-by seemed to go up and down the sunny street in a golden dream. Ida gazed till the shadows lengthened, and crept over the street and up the houses; till the sunlight died upon the railings, and then upon the steps, and at last lingered for half an hour in bright patches among the chimney-stacks, and then went out altogether, and left the world in shade.",ill pleasant slow process get strength pleasant afternoon knolt old place window go great grief day fine sun set seem inclined make fresh start bright rejuvenate glow shine opposite house throw mystic glory white step green railing wish go afternoon clear shadow seem free go open air have more desire door look droop little maid passer seem go sunny street golden dream gaze shadow lengthen creep street house sunlight die railing step last linger hour bright patch chimney stack go leave world shade 
76,"Twilight came on and Ida sat by the fire, which rose into importance now that the sunshine was gone; and, moreover, spring evenings are cold.",come sit fire rise importance sunshine gone spring evening cold 
77,"Ida felt desolate, and, on the whole, rather ill-used. Nurse had not been upstairs for hours, and though she had promised real tea and toast this evening, there were no signs of either as yet. The poor child felt too weak to play, and reading made her eyes ache. If only there were some one to tell her a story.",feel desolate whole ill use nurse hour promise real tea toast evening be sign poor child feel weak play reading make eye ache be one tell story 
78,"It grew dark, and then steps came outside the door, and a fumbling with the lock which made Ida nervous.",grow dark step come door fumbling lock make nervous 
79,"""Do come in, Nursey!"" she cried.",come cry 
80,"The door opened, and someone spoke; but the voice was not the voice of Nurse. It was a sweet, clear, gentle voice; musical, though no longer young; such a voice as one seldom hears and never forgets, which came out of the darkness, saying:",door open speak voice voice sweet clear gentle voice musical young voice hear forget come darkness say 
81,"""It is not Nurse, my dear; she is making the tea, and gave me leave to come up alone. I am Mrs. Overtheway.""",dear make tea give leave come

83,"""I have brought you one of my pets, my dear,"" said she. ""I think we both love flowers.""",bring pet dear say think love flower 
84,"The little old lady had come to tea. This was charming. She took off her bonnet, and her cap more than fulfilled Ida's expectations, although it was nothing smarter than a soft mass of tulle, tied with white satin strings. But what a face looked out of it! Mrs. Overtheway's features were almost perfect. The beauty of her eyes was rather enhanced by the blue shadows that Time had painted round them, and they were those good eyes which remind one of a clear well, at the bottom of which he might see truth. When young she must have been exquisitely beautiful, Ida thought. She was lovely still.",little old lady come tea charming take bonnet cap more fulfil expectation smart soft mass tulle tie white satin string face look feature perfect beauty eye enhance blue shadow paint good eye remind clear bottom see truth young beautiful think lovely 
85,"In due time Nurse brought up tea, and Ida could hardly believe that her fancies were realized at last; indeed more than realized--for no bread and treacle diminished the dignity of the entertainment; and Nurse would as soon have thought of carrying off the Great Mogul on his cushions, as of putting Mrs. Overtheway and her chair into the corner.",due time bring tea believe fancy realize last more realize bread treacle diminish dignity entertainment think carry great cushion put chair corner 
86,"But there is a limit even to the space of time for which one can enjoy tea and buttered toast. The tray was carried off, the hyacinth put in its place, and Ida curled herself up in an easy chair on one side of the fire, Mrs. Overtheway being opposite.",be limit space time enjoy tea butter toast tray carry hyacinth put place curl easy chair side fire opposite 
87,"""You see I am over the way still,"" laughed the little old lady. ""Now, tell me all about the primroses."" So Ida told everything, and apologized for her awkward speeches to the housekeeper.",see way laugh little old lady tell primrose tell apologize awkward speech housekeeper

93,"""If you would only tell me a story,"" she said, ""I do so like hearing Nurse's stories. At least she has only one, but I like it. It isn't exactly a story either, but it is about what happened in her last place. But I am rather tired of it. There's Master Henry--I like him very much, he was always in mischief; and there's Miss Adelaide, whose hair curled naturally--at least with a damp brush--I like her; but I don't have much of them; for Nurse generally goes off about a quarrel she had with the cook, and I never could tell what they quarrelled about, but Nurse said cook was full of malice and deceitfulness, so she left. I'm rather tired of it.""",tell story say hear story least have like story happen last place tired be like mischief be hair curl least damp brush like have much go quarrel have cook tell quarrell say cook full malice deceitfulness leave tired

96,"And Ida said this in simple good-faith, believing it to be a compliment.",say simple good faith believe compliment 
97,"""It is quite true,"" said Mrs. Overtheway, ""that one remembers many things at the end of a long life, and that they are often those things which happened a long while ago, and which are sometimes so slight in themselves that it is wonderful that they should not have been forgotten. I remember, for instance, when I was about your age, an incident that occurred which gave me an intense dislike to a special shade of brown satin. I hated it then, and at the end of more than half a century, I hate it still. The thing in itself was a mere folly; the people concerned in it have been dead for many years, and yet at the present time I should find considerable difficulty in seeing the merits of a person who should dress in satin of that peculiar hue.",true say remember many thing end long life thing happen long while slight wonderful forget remember instance age incident occur give intense dislike special shade brown satin hate end more century hate thing mere folly person concern dead many year present time find considerable difficulty see merit person dress satin peculiar hue 
98,"""What was it?"" asked Ida.",ask

101,"""But it is not funny in the least, unfortunately,"" said Mrs. Overtheway, laughing. ""It isn't really a story, either. It is not even like Nurse's experiences. It is only a strong remembrance of my childhood, that isn't worth repeating, and could hardly amuse you.""",funny least say laugh story experience strong remembrance childhood worth repeat amuse

106,"There was no resisting this loving argument. Ida felt she had gained her point, and curled herself up into a listening attitude accordingly. The hyacinth stood in solemn sweetness as if it were listening also; and Mrs. Overtheway, putting her little feet upon the fender to warm, began the story of ----",be resist loving argument feel gain point curl listening attitude hyacinth stand solemn sweetness listen put little foot fender warm begin story
