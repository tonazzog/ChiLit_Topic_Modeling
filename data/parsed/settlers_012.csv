2,"Oliver soon recovered.  The strong, manly caress of the pastor seemed to revive him, even more than the water the others threw on his face.  His first word was ""Mother.""",recover strong manly caress pastor seem revive more water other throw face first word mother

6,"The two men who were with him seemed about to raise a shout, and wave their hats, but the pastor forbade them by a gesture.  He whispered to Oliver,--",man seem about raise shout wave hat pastor forbid gesture whisper

10,"""We have something like news of your father too, Oliver.  There is a rumour which makes us hope that he may be safe at a distance.  Your mother believes it, as she will tell you.

17,"Mildred, lying uncomfortably in the soaked cloth (for the rain had penetrated everything), was yet dozing,--now and then starting and calling out.  Oliver took her hand, to wake her up, and asked her, with a smile, as she opened her eyes, whether she was dreaming of a boat again.  Mildred believed not, but her head was sadly confused; so much so, that she heard of the boat which had really come, and the pastor and her parents, without showing any surprise or pleasure.  Little ceremony was necessary with the strong Ailwin; and one of the men made short work with Roger, by lifting him and carrying him into the boat.  Oliver said a word to the pastor about seeing George's grave, and about the chest and the money-bag which belonged to somebody who might want them much. The pastor took charge of the bag, but declared that everything else must be left for another trip, at a more leisure time.  Mrs Linacre was waiting,--and in what a state of expectation!",lie soak cloth rain penetrate doze start call take hand wake ask smile open eye dreaming boat believe head confused hear boat come pastor parent show surprise pleasure little ceremony necessary strong man make short work lift carry boat say word pastor see grave chest money bag belong want much pastor take charge bag declare else leave trip leisure time wait state expectation 
18,"While the two stout rowers were pulling rapidly away from the Red-hill, and in the direction of Gainsborough, the pastor explained to the party what they most wanted to know.  Mrs Linacre had heard some rumour which alarmed her on the day of the flood, and had locked up her shed, and set out homewards when the waters gushed over her road, and compelled her to turn back.  Like a multitude of others, as anxious and miserable as herself, she had ever since been wandering about in search of a boat, and imploring aid from every one she met.",stout rower pull red hill direction pastor explain party want know hear rumour alarm day flood lock shed set homeward water gush road compel turn multitude other anxious miserable wonder search boat implor aid one meet 
19,"For three days, it appeared as if there really were no boats in all the district.  Some had certainly been swamped and broken by the rush of the flood: and there was great difficulty in bringing round from the coast such as could there be had from the fishermen.  Some farmers on the hill had lent their oxen, to bring boats over the hills; and others, men to row them; and this was in time to save many lives.  What number had been lost, it was impossible yet to say; but the cleverness and the hopefulness with which a multitude had struggled for life, during five days of hardship and peril were wonderful and admirable.  Mrs Linacre had trusted in the power which God gives his children in such extremity, and had been persuaded throughout (except during short moments of despair), that she should see her husband and children again.  In this persuasion she had been sustained by the pastor, from the moment of his finding her, after his own escape.",day appear be boat district swamp break rush flood be great difficulty bring coast such be have fisherman farmer hill loan oxen bring boat hill other man row time save many life number lose impossible say cleverness hopefulness multitude struggle life day hardship peril wonderful admirable trust power give child such extremity persuade short moment despair see husband child persuasion sustain pastor moment find own escape 
20,"Of his own escape the pastor would say nothing at present.  The children's minds were too full now for such tales of wonder and of horror as they must hear hereafter.  Neither would he permit a word on the origin of the flood.  He said they must think as little as they could of the wicked deeds of men, in this hour of God's mercy.  One prayer, in every heart, that God would forgive all evil-minded men,--one such prayer let there be; and then, no more disturbing thoughts of enemies in the hour of preservation.",own escape pastor say present child mind full such tale wonder horror hear permit word origin flood say think little wicked deed man hour mercy prayer heart forgive evil minded man such prayer let be disturbing thought enemy hour preservation 
21,"Oliver could not trust himself to ask, in the presence of strangers, what the rumour was, which the pastor had mentioned, about his father. The pastor was very apt to understand what was stirring in people's hearts; and he knew Oliver's at this moment.  He explained to him that a sailor had declared, on landing at Hull, that the ship in which he was had spoken with a Dutch vessel, off the Humber, in the night, by the light of lanterns only, when a voice was heard, as if from the deck of the Dutchman, crying out, ""Will some one have the charity to tell the wife of Linacre of the Levels that he is saved?""  The sailors had some fears about this voice--thought the message odd--fancied the voice was like what they should suppose a ghost's to be; and at length, persuaded one another that it came, not from any ship, but from the air overhead; and that the message meant that Linacre was dead, and that his soul was saved.  When they came ashore, however, and found what had befallen the Levels, they began to doubt whether it was not, after all, the voice of a flesh and blood man that had called out to them.  When the pastor now heard how the miller was floated off in his mill, he had little doubt of the good man having been picked up in the Humber, by a vessel sailing for Holland, which could not stop to set him ashore, but which now contained him, safe and well.  Within two months, he would be heard of or seen, it might fairly be hoped.",trust ask presence stranger rumour pastor mention father pastor apt understand stir person heart know moment explain sailor declare landing ship speak dutch vessel night light lantern voice hear deck cry one have charity tell wife level save sailor have fear voice think message odd fancy voice suppose ghost length persuade come ship air message mean dead soul save come find befall level begin doubt voice flesh blood man call pastor hear miller float mill have little doubt good man pick vessel sail stop set contain safe month hear see hope 
22,"Mrs Linacre was kindly taken care of in a farm-house, near the spring-- that farm-house where she had often taken her copper money to be changed for silver: but she had been little within doors, day or night.  She had paced all day by the brink of the flood; and as long as the moon was up, had sat at night on a rising ground, looking over the waters towards the Red-hill.  She had discovered that the mill was gone, when other eyes could distinguish nothing so far off.  No one had a glass to lend her-- so, at least, it was said; but some whispered that a glass might have been procured, but that it was thought she could see only what would distress her, and nothing that could do her any good.",take care farm house spring farm house take copper money change silver little door day night pace day brink flood moon sit night rise ground look water red hill discover mill gone other eye distinguish have glass lend least say whisper glass procure think see distress do good 
23,"She was on the brink of the water when the boat came near.  She would have thrown herself in to meet her children, if a neighbour had not been there to hold her back.",brink water boat come throw meet child neighbour hold 
24,"Oliver's first words to her were, that he believed his father was safe on his way to Holland, and would soon be coming back.  The pastor's first words were, as he placed Mildred in her arms--",first word believe father safe way come pastor first word place arm 
25,"""Two children are here restored to you.  Will you not patiently resign your other little one?""",child restore resign other little one 
26,"The speechless mother was hurrying away, with Mildred on her bosom, and drawing Oliver by the hand, which she clasped convulsively, when he said--",speechless mother hurry bosom draw hand clasp say 
27,"""Mother, help me to keep a promise I have made.  Here is Roger Redfurn-- very ill.  I promised we would not forsake him.  Let him go with us, till he is well.""",mother help keep promise make ill promise forsake let go well 
28,"""Whatever you will, my boy; but do not leave me, Oliver,--not for a moment.""",boy leave moment 
29,"""Go on,"" said the pastor.  ""We are bringing Roger after you.  We shall be at home as soon as you.""",go say pastor bring home 
30,"""Home,"" was the friendly farm-house.  There, before the end of the day, had Oliver learned that his morning signal had been seen from the large boat; and that the reason why the large boat had rowed away was, not only that it was full, but that the waters were now too shallow about the Red-hill for any but small craft.  Before the end of the day Mrs Linacre had been seen to look like herself once more; and Ailwin had told to the wondering neighbours the tale of the few days, which seemed now like years to look back upon.  She told more than even Oliver had observed of the miserable state of their place of refuge, which would soon have been a place of death.  Scarcely a breathing thing, she said, was left alive: and, in going to the boat, she had seen the soaked bee-hives upset, and the chilled bees lying about, as if there was no spirit left in them.  She shuddered when she thought of the Red-hill. Then she stimulated the farm-house people to take care of Roger,--a task in which Oliver left them little to do.  They were willing enough, however; for Ailwin told them that though Roger had been an odd boy in his time, owing to his having been brought up by queer people, yet, considering that those people were drowned and gone, and that Roger had been noticed by a lord, she did not doubt he might turn out well, if it so pleased God.",friendly farm house end day learn morning signal see large boat reason large boat row full water shallow red hill small craft end day see look tell wonder neighbour tale few day seem year look tell more observe miserable state place refuge place death breathing thing say leave alive go boat see soak bee hive upset chill bee lie be spirit leave shudder think red hill stimulate farm house person take care task leave little do willing tell odd boy time ow bring queer person consider person drown gone notice lord doubt turn pleased 
31,"How closely did Mildred clasp her mother's neck that evening!  Knowing nothing else, and feeling very strangely, she yet understood that she was in a place of shelter and comfort, and felt that her head rested on her mother's bosom--on that pillow which has something so far better than all warmth and softness.  By degrees she began to be aware that there was cool and fresh water, and sweet-smelling flowers, and that she was tenderly bathed, and laid to rest on a bed which was neither wet nor under a tree.  There was a surprising silence all round her, she felt, as she grew stronger, which no one yet attempted to explain to her; but her mother smiled at her so happily, that she supposed she was recovering.",clasp mother neck evening know else feel understand place shelter comfort feel head rest mother bosom pillow have good warmth softness degree begin aware be cool fresh water sweet smell flower bath lay rest bed wet tree be surprising silence feel grow strong attempt explain mother smile suppose recover 
32,"Mrs Linacre did look happy, even in the midst of her tears for her poor baby.  Mildred _was_ recovering, Oliver ate and slept, and whistled under the window--like a light-hearted boy, as he once again amused himself with carving every piece of hard wood he could find.  It was clear that he had escaped the fever; and every day that refreshed his colour, and filled out his thin face again, brought nearer the hour of his father's return.",look happy midst tear poor baby recover eat sleep whistle window light hearted boy amuse carve piece hard wood find clear escape fever day refresh colour fill thin face bring hour father return
