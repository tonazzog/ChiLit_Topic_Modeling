2,"They were all up early the next morning, and breakfasted at an early hour.  The knapsacks and guns, and the other requisites for the journey, were all prepared; William and Ready rose from the table, and taking an affectionate leave of Mr and Mrs Seagrave, they started on their journey.  The sun was shining brilliantly, and the weather had become warm; the ocean in the distance gleamed brightly, as its waters danced, and the cocoa-nut trees moved their branches gracefully to the breeze. They set off in high spirits, and having called the two shepherd dogs, and driven back Vixen, who would have joined the party, they passed the storehouse, and ascending the hill on the other side, they got their hatchets ready to blaze the trees; and Ready having set his course by his pocket compass, they were fairly on their way.  For some time they continued to cut the bark of the trees with their hatchets, without speaking, and then Ready stopped again to look at his compass.",next morning breakfast early hour knapsack gun other requisite journey prepare rise table take affectionate leave start journey sun shine weather become warm ocean distance gleam water dance cocoa nut tree move branch breeze set high spirit call shepherd dog drive join party pass storehouse ascend hill other side get hatchet ready blaze tree ready set course pocket compass way time continue cut bark tree hatchet speak ready stop look compass

4,"""Yes, sir, it is; but I suspect we are now in the thickest part of it, right in the middle of the island; however, we shall soon see.  We must keep a little more away to the southward.  We had better get on as fast as we can.  We shall have less work by and by, and then we can talk better.""",sir suspect thickest part middle island see keep little southward get have less work talk 
5,"For half-an-hour they continued their way through the wood, and, as Ready had observed, the trees became more distant from each other; still, however, they could not see anything before them but the stems of the cocoa-nuts.  It was hard work, chopping the trees every second, and their foreheads were moist with the exertion.",half hour continue way wood ready observe tree become distant other see stem cocoa- nut hard work chop tree second forehead moist exertion

9,"""What do you expect to find, Ready?""",expect find ready 
10,"""That's a difficult question to answer.  I can tell you what I hope to find, which is, a good space of clear ground between the beach and the wood, where we may pasture our sheep and goats; and perhaps we may find some other trees besides cocoa-nuts: at present, you know, we have seen only them and the castor-oil beans, that Tommy took such a dose of.  You see, William, there is no saying what new seeds may have been brought here by birds, or by the winds and waves.""",difficult question answer tell hope find good space clear ground beach wood pasture sheep goat find other tree cocoa nut present know see castor oil bean take dose see be say new seed bring bird wind wave

13,"They continued their way, and had not walked for more than a quarter of an hour, when William cried out, ""I see the blue sky, Ready; we shall soon be out; and glad shall I be, for my arm aches with chopping.""",continue way walk more quarter hour cry see blue sky ready glad arm ache chop 
14,"""I dare say it does, sir.  I am just as glad as you are, for I'm tired of marking the trees; however, we must continue to mark, or we shall not find our way back when we want it.""",say sir glad tired mark tree continue mark find way want 
15,"In ten minutes more they were clear of the cocoa-nut grove, and found themselves among brushwood higher than their heads; so that they could not see how far they were from the shore.",minute clear cocoa nut grove find brushwood high head see shore

17,"""I'm of your opinion, sir,"" replied Ready, sitting down by the side of William; ""I feel more tired to-day than I did when we first went through the wood, after we set off from the cove.

18,"""The weather is very fine, Ready.""",weather fine ready 
19,"""Yes, now it is; but I meant to have said that the rainy season is very trying to the health, and I suppose I have not recovered from it yet. You have had a regular fever, and, of course, do not feel strong; but a man may have no fever, and yet his health suffer a great deal from it. I am an old man, William, and feel these things now.""",mean say rainy season try health suppose recover have regular fever course feel strong man have fever health suffer great deal old man feel thing 
20,"""I think that before we go on, Ready, we had better have our dinner; that will do us good.""",think go ready have dinner do good 
21,"""Well, we will take an early dinner, and we shall get rid of one bottle of water, at all events; indeed, I think that, as we must go back by the same way we came, we may as well leave our knapsacks and everything but our guns under these trees; I dare say we shall sleep here too, for I told Mr Seagrave positively not to expect us back to-night.  I did not like to say so before your mother, she is so anxious about you.""",take early dinner get rid bottle water event think go same way come leave knapsack gun tree say sleep tell expect night like say mother anxious 
22,"They opened their knapsacks, and made their meal, the two dogs coming in for their share; after which they again started on their discoveries. For about ten minutes they continued to force their way through the thick and high bushes, till at last they broke out clear of them, and then looked around them for a short time without speaking.  The sea was about half a mile distant, and the intervening land was clear, with fresh blades of grass just bursting out of the earth, composing a fine piece of pasture of at least fifty acres, here and there broken with small patches of trees and brushwood; there was no sandy beach, but the rocks rose from the sea about twenty to thirty feet high, and were in one or two places covered with something which looked as white as snow.",open knapsack make meal dog come share start discovery minute continue force way thick high bush last break clear look short time speak sea mile distant intervene land clear fresh blade grass burst earth compose fine piece pasture least acre break small patch tree brushwood be sandy beach rock rise sea foot high place cover look white snow

24,"""No,"" replied Ready, ""we are very fortunate, and have great reason to be thankful; this is exactly what we required; and now let us go on a little, and examine these patches of wood, and see what they are.  I see a bright green leaf out there, which, if my eyes do not fail me, I have seen many a time before.""  When they arrived at the clump of trees which Ready had pointed out, he said, ""Yes, I was right.  Look there, this is the banana; it is just bursting out now, and will soon be ten feet high, and bearing fruit which is excellent eating; besides which the stem is capital fodder for the beasts.""",reply ready fortunate have great reason thankful require let go little examine patch wood see see bright green leaf eye fail see time arrive clump tree ready point say right look banana burst foot high bear fruit excellent eating stem capital fodder beast

26,"""But I have, William.  It is what they call the bird's-eye pepper; they make Cayenne pepper out of it.  Look, the pods are just formed; it will be useful to us in cooking, as we have no pepper left.  You see, William, we must have some birds on the island; at least it is most probable, for all the seeds of these plants and trees must have been brought here by them.  The banana and the pepper are the food of many birds.  What a quantity of bananas are springing up in this spot; there will be a little forest of them in a few weeks.""",call bird eye pepper make pepper look pod form useful cooking have pepper left see have bird island least probable seed plant tree bring banana pepper food many bird quantity banana spring spot be little forest few week

30,"""Not particularly; and the little spikes run into your fingers, and are very difficult to get rid of; but it is not bad by way of a change.  No, the use it will be to us is to hedge in our garden, and protect it from the animals; it makes a capital fence, and grows very fast, and without trouble.  Now let us go on to that patch of trees, and see what they are.""",little spike run finger difficult get rid bad way change use hedge garden protect animal make capital fence grow fast trouble let go patch tree see

58,"Ready gave a shout, and a grunting and rushing were heard among the broad leaves, and, very soon, out rushed, instead of the six, about thirty pigs large and small; who, snorting and twisting their tails, galloped away at a great rate, until they gained the cocoa-nut grove.",ready give shout grunting rush hear broad leave rush pig large small snort twist tail gallop great rate gain cocoa nut grove

63,"As they neared the rocks, which were bare for about fifty yards from the water's edge, Ready said, ""I can tell you now what those white patches on the rocks are, William; they are the places where the sea-birds come to every year to make their nests, and bring up their young.  They always come to the same place every year, if they are not disturbed.""

69,"""Not so, William; we have not the pure water, recollect, and we have not the advantages of the sandy beach, where we have our turtle- and fish-pond.  No; we may feed our stock here; we may gather the fruit, taking our share of it with the poor birds; we may get our yams, and every other good provided for us; but our house and home must be where it is now.""",have pure water recollect have advantage sandy beach have turtle fish pond feed stock gather fruit take share poor bird get yam other good provide house home

73,"""See, William, what a nice little harbour for our boat! we may here load it with yams and take it round to the bay, provided we can find an entrance through the reefs on the southern side of it, which we have not looked for yet, because we have not required it.""",see nice little harbour boat load yam take bay provide find entrance reef southern side look require

82,"They found out the spot where they had left their knapsacks and hatchets, and again took their path through the cocoa-nut trees, following the blaze which they had made in the morning.  One hour before sunset they arrived at the house, where they found Mr and Mrs Seagrave sitting outside, and Juno standing on the beach with the two children, who were amusing themselves with picking up the shells which were strewed about.  William gave a very clear account of all they had seen, and showed his father the specimens of the plants which he had collected.",find spot leave knapsack hatchet take path cocoa nut tree follow blaze make morning hour sunset arrive house find sit stand beach child amusing pick shell strew give clear account see show father specimen plant collect

94,"As soon as they had returned to the house, a consultation was held as to their future proceedings; and, after some debate, it was agreed that it would be advisable that they should take the boat out of the sand; and, as soon as it was ready, examine the reef on the southward, to see if they could find a passage through it, as it would take a long while to go round it; and, as soon as that was accomplished, Mr Seagrave, Ready, William, and Juno should all go through the wood, carrying with them a tent to pitch on the newly-discovered piece of ground: and that they should set up a flag-staff at the little harbour, to point out its position.  Of course, that would be a hard day's work; but that they would, nevertheless, return the same night, and not leave Mrs Seagrave alone with the children.  Having accomplished this, Ready and William would then put the wheels and axle in the boat, and other articles required, such as saw, hatchets, and spades, and row round to the south side of the island, to find the little harbour.  As soon as they had landed them, and secured the boat, they would then return by the path through the wood.",return house consultation hold future proceedings debate agree advisable take boat sand ready examine reef southward see find passage take long while go accomplish ready go wood carry tent pitch discover piece ground set flag staff little harbour point position course hard day work return same night leave child accomplish ready put wheel axle boat other article require such see hatchet spade row south side island find little harbour land secure boat return path wood 
95,"The next job would be to rail in the yam plantation to keep off the pigs, and, at the same time, to drive the sheep and goats through the wood, that they might feed on the new pasture ground.  Ready and William were then to cut down cocoa-nut trees sufficient for the paling, fix up the posts, and when that was done, Mr Seagrave was to come to them and assist them in railing it in, and drawing the timber.  This they expected would be all done in about a month; and during that time, as Mrs Seagrave and Juno would be, for the greatest part of it, left at the house, they were to employ themselves in clearing the garden of weeds, and making preparation for fencing it in.",next job rail yam plantation keep pig same time drive sheep goat wood feed new pasture ground ready cut cocoa nut tree sufficient paling fix post do come assist rail draw timber expect do month time great part leave house employ clear garden weed make preparation fencing 
96,"As soon as this important work had been completed, the boat would return to the bay with a load of prickly pears for the garden fence, and then they were to direct their attention to the stores which had been saved from the wreck, and were lying in the cove where they had first landed. When they had examined them, and brought round what were required, and secured them in the storehouse, they would then have a regular survey of the island by land and by water.  But man proposes and God disposes, as will be shown by the interruption of their intended projects which we shall have to narrate in the ensuing chapter.",important work complete boat return bay load prickly pear garden fence direct attention store save wreck lie cove land examine bring require secure storehouse have regular survey island land water man propose dispose show interruption intend project have narrate ensue chapter
