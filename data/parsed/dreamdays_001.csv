1,CHAPTER 1. THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER,chapter first 
2," IN the matter of general culture and attainments, we youngsters stood on pretty level ground. True, it was always happening that one of us would be singled out at any moment, freakishly, and without regard to his own preferences, to wrestle with the inflections of some idiotic language long rightly dead; while another, from some fancied artistic tendency which always failed to justify itself, might be told off without warning to hammer out scales and exercises, and to bedew the senseless keys with tears of weariness or of revolt. But in subjects common to either sex, and held to be necessary even for him whose ambition soared no higher than to crack a whip in a circus-ring--in geography, for instance, arithmetic, or the weary doings of kings and queens--each would have scorned to excel. And, indeed, whatever our individual gifts, a general dogged determination to shirk and to evade kept us all at much the same dead level,--a level of ignorance tempered by insubordination.",matter general culture attainment youngster stand pretty level ground true happen single moment regard own preference wrestle inflection idiotic language dead fancy artistic tendency fail justify tell warning hammer scale exercise bede senseless key tear weariness revolt subject common sex hold necessary ambition soar high crack whip circus ring geography instance arithmetic weary doing king queen scorn excel individual gift general dogg determination shirk evade keep same dead level level ignorance temper insubordination 
3,"Fortunately there existed a wide range of subjects, of healthier tone than those already enumerated, in which we were free to choose for ourselves, and which we would have scorned to consider education; and in these we freely followed each his own particular line, often attaining an amount of special knowledge which struck our ignorant elders as simply uncanny. For Edward, the uniforms, accoutrements, colours, and mottoes of the regiments composing the British Army had a special glamour. In the matter of facings he was simply faultless; among chevrons, badges, medals, and stars, he moved familiarly; he even knew the names of most of the colonels in command; and he would squander sunny hours prone on the lawn, heedless of challenge from bird or beast, poring over a tattered Army List. My own accomplishment was of another character--took, as it seemed to me, a wider and a more untrammelled range. Dragoons might have swaggered in Lincoln green, riflemen might have donned sporrans over tartan trews, without exciting notice or comment from me. But did you seek precise information as to the fauna of the American continent, then you had come to the right shop. Where and why the bison ""wallowed""; how beaver were to be trapped and wild turkeys stalked; the grizzly and how to handle him, and the pretty pressing ways of the constrictor,--in fine, the haunts and the habits of all that burrowed, strutted, roared, or wriggled between the Atlantic and the Pacific,--all this knowledge I took for my province. By the others my equipment was fully recognised. Supposing a book with a bear-hunt in it made its way into the house, and the atmosphere was electric with excitement; still, it was necessary that I should first decide whether the slot had been properly described and properly followed up, ere the work could be stamped with full approval. A writer might have won fame throughout the civilised globe for his trappers and his realistic backwoods, and all went for nothing. If his pemmican were not properly compounded I damned his achievement, and it was heard no more of.",exist wide range subject healthy tone enumerate free choose scorn consider education follow own particular line attain amount special knowledge strike ignorant elder uncanny uniform accoutrement colour mottoe regiment compose british have special glamour matter facing faultless chevron badge medal star move know name most colonel command squander sunny hour prone lawn heedless challenge bird beast pore tatter own accomplishment character take seem wide untrammelled range dragoon swagger green riflemen don sporran tartan trew exciting notice comment seek precise information fauna american continent come right shop bison wallow beaver trap wild turkey stalked grizzly handle pretty press way constrictor fine haunt habit burrow strut roar wriggle knowledge take province other equipment recognise suppose book bear hunt make way house atmosphere electric excitement necessary decide slot describe follow work stamp full approval writer win fame civilised globe trapper realistic backwood go pemmican compound damned achievement hear more 
4,"Harold was hardly old enough to possess a special subject of his own. He had his instincts, indeed, and at bird's-nesting they almost amounted to prophecy. Where we others only suspected eggs, surmised possible eggs, hinted doubtfully at eggs in the neighbourhood, Harold went straight for the right bush, bough, or hole as if he carried a divining-rod. But this faculty belonged to the class of mere gifts, and was not to be ranked with Edward's lore regarding facings, and mine as to the habits of prairie-dogs, both gained by painful study and extensive travel in those ""realms of gold,"" the Army List and Ballantyne.",old possess special subject own have instinct bird nest amount prophecy other suspect egg surmise possible egg hint egg neighbourhood go right bush bough hole carry divining rod faculty belong class mere gift rank lore regard facing habit prairie dog gain painful study extensive travel realm gold 
5,"Selina's subject, quite unaccountably, happened to be naval history. There is no laying down rules as to subjects; you just possess them--or rather, they possess you--and their genesis or protoplasm is rarely to be tracked down. Selina had never so much as seen the sea; but for that matter neither had I ever set foot on the American continent, the by-ways of which I knew so intimately. And just as I, if set down without warning in the middle of the Rocky Mountains, would have been perfectly at home, so Selina, if a genie had dropped her suddenly on Portsmouth Hard, could have given points to most of its frequenters. From the days of Blake down to the death of Nelson (she never condescended further), Selina had taken spiritual part in every notable engagement of the British Navy; and even in the dark days when she had to pick up skirts and flee, chased by an ungallant De Ruyter or Van Tromp, she was yet cheerful in the consciousness that ere long she would be gleefully hammering the fleets of the world, in the glorious times to follow. When that golden period arrived, Selina was busy indeed; and, while loving best to stand where the splinters were flying the thickest, she was also a careful and critical student of seamanship and of manoeuvre. She knew the order in which the great line-of-battle ships moved into action, the vessels they respectively engaged, the moment when each let go its anchor, and which of them had a spring on its cable (while not understanding the phrase, she carefully noted the fact); and she habitually went into an engagement on the quarter-deck of the gallant ship that reserved its fire the longest.",subject happen naval history be laying rule subject possess possess genesis protoplasm track much see sea matter set foot american continent way know set warning middle home genie drop give point most frequenter day death condescend take spiritual part notable engagement british dark day have pick skirt flee chase ungallant cheerful consciousness hammer fleet world glorious time follow golden period arrive busy love good stand splinter fly thickest careful critical student seamanship manoeuvre know order great line battle ship move action vessel engage moment let go anchor have spring cable understand phrase note fact go engagement quarter deck gallant ship reserve fire long 
6,"At the time of Selina's weird seizure I was unfortunately away from home, on a loathsome visit to an aunt; and my account is therefore feebly compounded from hearsay. It was an absence I never ceased to regret--scoring it up, with a sense of injury, against the aunt. There was a splendid uselessness about the whole performance that specially appealed to my artistic sense. That it should have been Selina, too, who should break out this way--Selina, who had just become a regular subscriber to the ""Young Ladies' Journal,"" and who allowed herself to be taken out to strange teas with an air of resignation palpably assumed--this was a special joy, and served to remind me that much of this dreaded convention that was creeping over us might be, after all, only veneer. Edward also was absent, getting licked into shape at school; but to him the loss was nothing. With his stern practical bent he wouldn't have seen any sense in it--to recall one of his favourite expressions. To Harold, however, for whom the gods had always cherished a special tenderness, it was granted, not only to witness, but also, priestlike, to feed the sacred fire itself. And if at the time he paid the penalty exacted by the sordid unimaginative ones who temporarily rule the roast, he must ever after, one feels sure, have carried inside him some of the white gladness of the acolyte who, greatly privileged, has been permitted to swing a censer at the sacring of the very Mass.",time weird seizure home loathsome visit aunt account compound hearsay absence cease regret score sense injury aunt be splendid uselessness whole performance appeal artistic sense break way become regular subscriber young allow take strange tea air resignation assume special joy serve remind much dread convention creep veneer absent lick shape school loss stern practical bend see sense recall favourite expression god cherish special tenderness grant witness priestlike feed sacred fire time pay penalty exact sordid unimaginative one rule roast feel sure carry white gladness acolyte privileged permit swing censer sacring very 
7,"October was mellowing fast, and with it the year itself; full of tender hints, in woodland and hedgerow, of a course well-nigh completed. From all sides that still afternoon you caught the quick breathing and sob of the runner nearing the goal. Preoccupied and possessed, Selina had strayed down the garden and out into the pasture beyond, where, on a bit of rising ground that dominated the garden on one side and the downs with the old coach-road on the other, she had cast herself down to chew the cud of fancy. There she was presently joined by Harold, breathless and very full of his latest grievance.",mellow year full tender hint woodland hedgerow course nigh complete side afternoon catch quick breathing sob runner near goal preoccupy possess stray garden pasture bit rise ground dominate garden side down old coach road other cast chew cud fancy join breathless full late grievance 
8,"""I asked him not to,"" he burst out. ""I said if he'd only please wait a bit and Edward would be back soon, and it couldn't matter to _him_, and the pig wouldn't mind, and Edward'd be pleased and everybody'd be happy. But he just said he was very sorry, but bacon didn't wait for nobody. So I told him he was a regular beast, and then I came away. And--and I b'lieve they're doing it now!""",ask burst say wait bit matter pig mind pleased happy say sorry bacon wait tell regular beast come b'lieve do 
9,"""Yes, he's a beast,"" agreed Selina, absently. She had forgotten all about the pig-killing. Harold kicked away a freshly thrown-up mole-hill, and prodded down the hole with a stick. From the direction of Farmer Larkin's demesne came a long drawn note of sorrow, a thin cry and appeal, telling that the stout soul of a black Berkshire pig was already faring down the stony track to Hades.",beast agree forget pig-killing kick throw mole hill prodd hole stick direction demesne come long draw note sorrow thin cry appeal tell stout soul black pig fare stony track

14,"""Over there,"" resumed Selina--she was gazing out in the direction of the old highroad--""over there the coaches used to go by. Uncle Thomas was telling me about it the other day. And the people used to watch for 'em coming, to tell the time by, and p'r'aps to get their parcels. And one morning--they wouldn't be expecting anything different--one morning, first there would be a cloud of dust, as usual, and then the coach would come racing by, and then they would know!

15,"Harold listened in respectful silence. He would much rather have been hunting the mole, who must have been a mile away by this time if he had his wits about him. But he had all the natural instincts of a gentleman; of whom it is one of the principal marks, if not the complete definition, never to show signs of being bored.",listen respectful silence hunt mole mile time have wit have natural instinct gentleman principal mark complete definition show sign bored

22,"Harold was somewhat taken aback. In the case of the pig, for instance, whose last outcry had now passed into stillness, he had considered the chapter as finally closed. Whatever innocent mirth the holidays might hold in store for Edward, that particular pig, at least, would not be a contributor. And now he was given to understand that the situation had not materially changed! He would have to revise his ideas, it seemed. Sitting up on end, he looked towards the garden for assistance in the task. Thence, even as he gazed, a tiny column of smoke rose straight up into the still air. The gardener had been sweeping that afternoon, and now, an unconscious priest, was offering his sacrifice of autumn leaves to the calm-eyed goddess of changing hues and chill forebodings who was moving slowly about the land that golden afternoon. Harold was up and off in a moment, forgetting Nelson, forgetting the pig, the mole, the Larkin betrayal, and Selina's strange fever of conscience. Here was fire, real fire, to play with, and that was even better than messing with water, or remodelling the plastic surface of the earth. Of all the toys the world provides for right-minded persons, the original elements rank easily the first.",take case pig instance last outcry pass stillness consider chapter close innocent mirth holiday hold store particular pig least contributor give understand situation change have revise idea seem sit end look garden assistance task thence gaze tiny column smoke rise air gardener sweep afternoon unconscious priest offer sacrifice autumn leave calm eyed goddess change hue chill foreboding move land golden afternoon moment forget forget pig mole betrayal strange fever conscience fire real fire play good mess water remodelling plastic surface earth toy world provide right minded person original element rank first

25,"But Selina sat on where she was, her chin on her fists; and her fancies whirled and drifted, here and there, in curls and eddies, along with the smoke she was watching. As the quick-footed dusk of the short October day stepped lightly over the garden, little red tongues of fire might be seen to leap and vanish in the smoke. Harold, anon staggering under armfuls of leaves, anon stoking vigorously, was discernible only at fitful intervals. It was another sort of smoke that the inner eye of Selina was looking upon,--a smoke that hung in sullen banks round the masts and the hulls of the fighting ships; a smoke from beneath which came thunder and the crash and the splinter-rip, the shout of the boarding-party, the choking sob of the gunner stretched by his gun; a smoke from out of which at last she saw, as through a riven pall, the radiant spirit of the Victor, crowned with the coronal of a perfect death, leap in full assurance up into the ether that Immortals breathe. The dusk was glooming towards darkness when she rose and moved slowly down towards the beckoning fire; something of the priestess in her stride, something of the devotee in the set purpose of her eye.",sit chin fist fancy whirl drift curl eddie smoke watch quick footed dusk short day step garden little red tongue fire see leap vanish smoke anon staggering armful leave anon stoke discernible fitful interval sort smoke inner eye look smoke hang sullen bank mast hull fighting ship smoke come thunder crash splinter rip shout boarding party choke sob gunner stretch gun smoke last see riven pall radiant spirit crown coronal perfect death leap full assurance ether immortal breathe dusk gloom darkness rise move beckon fire priestess stride devotee set purpose eye

27,"""Go 'n' get some more sticks,"" ordered Selina, ""and shavings, 'n' chunks of wood, 'n' anything you can find. Look here--in the kitchen-garden there's a pile of old pea-sticks. Fetch as many as you can carry, and then go back and bring some more!""",go get more stick order shaving n chunk wood find look kitchen garden be pile old pea-stick fetch many carry go bring more

30,"Harold ran off at once, true to the stern system of discipline in which he had been nurtured. But his eyes were like round O's, and as he ran he talked fast to himself, in evident disorder of mind.",run true stern system discipline nurture eye run talk evident disorder mind 
31,"The pea-sticks made a rare blaze, and the fire, no longer smouldering sullenly, leapt up and began to assume the appearance of a genuine bonfire. Harold, awed into silence at first, began to jump round it with shouts of triumph. Selina looked on grimly, with knitted brow; she was not yet fully satisfied. ""Can't you get any more sticks?"" she said presently. ""Go and hunt about. Get some old hampers and matting and things out of the tool-house. Smash up that old cucumber frame Edward shoved you into, the day we were playing scouts and Mohicans. Stop a bit! Hooray! I know. You come along with me.""",pea- stick make rare blaze fire smoulder leapt begin assume appearance genuine bonfire awe silence first begin jump shout triumph look knite brow satisfied get more stick say go hunt get old hamper matting thing tool house smash old cucumber frame shove day play scout stop bit know come 
32,"Hard by there was a hot-house, Aunt Eliza's special pride and joy, and even grimly approved of by the gardener. At one end, in an out-house adjoining, the necessary firing was stored; and to this sacred fuel, of which we were strictly forbidden to touch a stick, Selina went straight. Harold followed obediently, prepared for any crime after that of the pea-sticks, but pinching himself to see if he were really awake.",hard be hot house special pride joy approve gardener end house adjoin necessary fire store sacred fuel forbidden touch stick go follow prepare crime pea-stick pinch see awake 
33,"""You bring some coals,"" said Selina briefly, without any palaver or pro-and-con discussion. ""Here's a basket. _I'll_ manage the faggots!""",bring coal say palaver pro-and con discussion basket manage faggot 
34,"In a very few minutes there was little doubt about its being a genuine bonfire and no paltry makeshift. Selina, a Mænad now, hatless and tossing disordered locks, all the dross of the young lady purged out of her, stalked around the pyre of her own purloining, or prodded it with a pea-stick. And as she prodded she murmured at intervals, ""I _knew_ there was something we could do! It isn't much--but still it's _something_!""",few minute be little doubt genuine bonfire paltry makeshift hatless toss disorder lock dross young lady purge stalked pyre own purloining prodd pea-stick prodd murmure interval _knew be do much _something_ 
35,"The gardener had gone home to his tea. Aunt Eliza had driven out for hers a long way off, and was not expected back till quite late; and this far end of the garden was not overlooked by any windows. So the Tribute blazed on merrily unchecked. Villagers far away, catching sight of the flare, muttered something about ""them young devils at their tricks again"", and trudged on beer-wards. Never a thought of what day it was, never a thought for Nelson, who preserved their honest pint-pots, to be paid for in honest pence, and saved them from _litres_ and decimal coinage. Nearer at hand, frightened rabbits popped up and vanished with a flick of white tails; scared birds fluttered among the branches, or sped across the glade to quieter sleeping-quarters; but never a bird nor a beast gave a thought to the hero to whom they owed it that each year their little homes of horsehair, wool, or moss, were safe stablished 'neath the flap of the British flag; and that Game Laws, quietly permanent, made _la chasse_ a terror only to their betters. No one seemed to know, nor to care, nor to sympathise. In all the ecstasy of her burnt-offering and sacrifice, Selina stood alone.",gardener go tea drive long way expect far end garden overlook window blaze unchecked villager catching sight flare mutter young devil trick trudge beer ward thought day thought preserve honest pint pot pay honest pence save _litres_ decimal coinage hand frighten rabbit pop vanish flick white tail scared bird flutter branch spe glade quiet sleeping quarter bird beast give thought hero owe year little home horsehair wool moss safe stablish neath flap british flag game law permanent make _la chasse_ terror better seem know care sympathise ecstasy burnt offering sacrifice stand 
36,"And yet--not quite alone! For, as the fire was roaring at its best, certain stars stepped delicately forth on the surface of the immensity above, and peered down doubtfully--with wonder at first, then with interest, then with recognition, with a start of glad surprise. _They_ at least knew all about it, _they_ understood. Among _them_ the Name was a daily familiar word; his story was a part of the music to which they swung, himself was their fellow and their mate and comrade. So they peeped, and winked, and peeped again, and called to their laggard brothers to come quick and see.",alone fire roar good certain star step surface immensity peer wonder first interest recognition start glad surprise least know understand daily familiar word story part music swing fellow mate comrade peep wink peep call laggard brother come see

38,"""The best of life is but intoxication;"" and Selina, who during her brief inebriation had lived in an ecstasy as golden as our drab existence affords, had to experience the inevitable bitterness of awakening sobriety, when the dying down of the flames into sullen embers coincided with the frenzied entrance of Aunt Eliza on the scene. It was not so much that she was at once and forever disrated, broke, sent before the mast, and branded as one on whom no reliance could be placed, even with Edward safe at school, and myself under the distant vigilance of an aunt; that her pocket money was stopped indefinitely, and her new Church Service, the pride of her last birthday, removed from her own custody and placed under the control of a Trust. She sorrowed rather because she had dragged poor Harold, against his better judgment, into a most horrible scrape, and moreover because, when the reaction had fairly set in, when the exaltation had fizzled away and the young-lady portion of her had crept timorously back to its wonted lodging, she could only see herself as a plain fool, unjustified, undeniable, without a shadow of an excuse or explanation.",good life intoxication brief inebriation live ecstasy golden drab existence afford have experience inevitable bitterness awakening sobriety die flame sullen ember coincide frenzied entrance scene much disrate break send mast brand reliance place safe school distant vigilance aunt pocket money stop new pride last birthday remove own custody place control trust sorrow drag poor good judgment horrible scrape reaction set exaltation fizzle young lady portion creep wont lodging see plain fool unjustified undeniable shadow excuse explanation 
39,"As for Harold, youth and a short memory made his case less pitiful than it seemed to his more sensitive sister. True, he started upstairs to his lonely cot bellowing dismally, before him a dreary future of pains and penalties, sufficient to last to the crack of doom. Outside his door, however, he tumbled over Augustus the cat, and made capture of him; and at once his mourning was changed into a song of triumph, as he conveyed his prize into port. For Augustus, who detested above all things going to bed with little boys, was ever more knave than fool, and the trapper who was wily enough to ensnare him had achieved something notable. Augustus, when he realised that his fate was sealed, and his night's lodging settled, wisely made the best of things, and listened, with a languorous air of complete comprehension, to the incoherent babble concerning pigs and heroes, moles and bonfires, which served Harold for a self-sung lullaby. Yet it may be doubted whether Augustus was one of those rare fellows who thoroughly understood.",youth short memory make case pitiful seem sensitive sister true start lonely cot bellow dreary future pain penalty sufficient last crack doom door tumble cat make capture mourn change song triumph convey prize port detest thing go bed little boy knave fool trapper ensnare achieve notable realise fate seal night lodging settle make good thing listen languorous air complete comprehension incoherent babble concern pig hero mole bonfire serve self sung lullaby doubt rare fellow understand 
40,"But Selina knew no more of this source of consolation than of the sympathy with which the stars were winking above her; and it was only after some sad interval of time, and on a very moist pillow, that she drifted into that quaint inconsequent country where you may meet your own pet hero strolling down the road, and commit what hair-brained oddities you like, and everybody understands and appreciates.",know more source consolation sympathy star wink sad interval time moist pillow drift quaint inconsequent country meet own pet hero stroll road commit hair brained oddity like understand appreciate
