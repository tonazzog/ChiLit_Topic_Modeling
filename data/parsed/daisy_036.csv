6,"After the committee had sat upon this letter, the two sisters walked home in much greater harmony than after the former meeting. Etheldred had recovered her candour, and was willing to own that it was not art, but good sense, that gave her sister so much ascendancy. She began to be hopeful, and to declare that Flora might yet do something even with the ladies. Flora was gratified by the approval that no one in the house could help valuing; “Positively,” said Flora, “I believe I may in time. You see there are different ways of acting, as an authority, or as an equal.”",committee sit letter sister walk great harmony former meeting recover candour willing own art good sense give sister much ascendancy begin hopeful declare do lady gratified approval house help value say believe time see be different way act authority equal

17,"They were at home by this time, and entering the hall, perceived that the whole party were in the lawn. The consolation of the children for the departure of Hector and Tom, was a bowl of soap-suds and some tobacco pipes, and they had collected the house to admire and assist, even Margaret’s couch being drawn close to the window.",home time enter hall perceive whole party lawn consolation child departure bowl soap sud tobacco pipe collect house admire assist couch draw window 
18,"Bubbles is one of the most fascinating of sports. There is the soft foamy mass, like driven snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche bends down to blow “a honeycomb,” holding the bowl of the pipe in the water; at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger, clearer bubbles, each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow tints, until Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand, and Mary pronounces it stiff enough, and presents a pipe to little Daisy, who, drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it away with a grimace, and declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands with swelled cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity. Out pours a confused assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins, flowing down on either side, bearing an enlarging miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree. Aubrey pauses to exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary calls it, a peacock, in blended pink and green, is this transparent sphere, reflecting and embellishing house, wall, and shrubs! It is too beautiful! It is gone! Mary undertakes to give a lesson, and blows deliberately without the slightest result. Again! She waves her disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves, and float off on the summer breeze, with a tardy, graceful, uncertain motion. Daisy rushes after them, catches at them, and looks at her empty fingers with a puzzled “All gone!” as plainly expressed by Toby, who snaps at them, and shakes his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth, while the kitten frisks after them, striking at them with her paw, amazed at meeting vacancy.",bubble fascinating sport be soft foamy mass drive snow whip cream bend blow honeycomb hold bowl pipe water gurgling blast heave pile large clear bubble reflect whole scene sparkling rainbow tint dash fragment hand pronounce stiff present pipe little draw liquid mouth throw grimace declare like bubble stand swell cheek puffing sealing wax extremity pour confuse assemblage froth glassy globe expand little branching vein flow side bear enlarge miniature sky cloud tulip tree pause exclaim try proud bubble call peacock blend pink green transparent sphere reflect embellish house wall shrub beautiful gone undertake give lesson blow slight result wave disengage hand silent exultation airy ball detach float summer breeze tardy graceful uncertain motion rush catch look empty finger puzzle gone express snap shake head offend dignity shock meeting tooth kitten frisk strike paw amaze meeting vacancy 
19,"Even the grave Norman is drawn in. He agrees with Mary that bubbles used to fly over the wall, and that one once went into Mrs. Richardson’s garret window, when her housemaid tried to catch it with a pair of tongs, and then ran downstairs screaming that there was a ghost in her room; but that was in Harry’s time, the heroic age of the May nursery.",grave draw agree bubble use fly wall go garret window housemaid try catch pair tong run scream be ghost room time heroic age nursery 
20,"He accepts a pipe, and his greater height raises it into a favourable current of air--the glistening balloon sails off. It flies, it soars; no, it is coming down! The children shout at it, as if to drive it up, but it wilfully descends--they rush beneath, they try to waft it on high with their breath--there is a collision between Mary and Blanche--Aubrey perceives a taste of soapy water--the bubble is no more--it is vanished in his open mouth!",accept pipe great height raise favourable current air glisten balloon sail fly soar come child shout drive descend rush try waft high breath be collision perceive taste soapy water bubble more vanish open mouth 
21,"Papa himself has taken a pipe, and the little ones are mounted on chairs, to be on a level with their tall elders. A painted globe is swimming along, hesitating at first, but the dancing motion is tending upwards, the rainbow tints glisten in the sunlight--all rush to assist it; if breath of the lips can uphold it, it should rise, indeed! Up! above the wall! over Mrs. Richardson’s elm, over the topmost branch--hurrah! out of sight! Margaret adds her voice to the acclamations. Beat that if you can, Mary! That doubtful wind keeps yours suspended in a graceful minuet; its pace is accelerated--but earthwards! it has committed self-destruction by running foul of a rose-bush.

I remember when I used to be called Peg-top--and Flora, Flossy--we were never allowed to use the names when any visitor was near; and we were asked if we could not be as fond of each other by our proper names.

The visions of those boyish days had not been forgotten, the Vesuvius scenery was much as Ethel had once described it, but with far more force and beauty; there was Decius’s impassioned address to the beauteous land he was about to leave, and the remembrances of his Roman hearth, his farm, his children, whom he quitted for the pale shadows of an uncertain Elysium. There was a great hiatus in the middle, and Norman had many more authorities to consult, but the summing-up was nearly complete, and Ethel thought the last lines grand, as they spoke of the noble consul’s name living for evermore, added to the examples that nerve ardent souls to devote life, and all that is precious, to the call of duty. Fame is not their object. She may crown their pale brows, but for the good of others, not their own, a beacon light to the world. Self is no object of theirs, and it is the casting self behind that wins--not always the visible earthly strife, but the combat between good and evil. They are the true victors, and, whether chronicled or forgotten, true glory rests on their heads, the sole true glory that man can attain, namely, the reflected beams that crown them as shadowy types of Him whom Decius knew not--the Prince who gave Himself for His people, and thus rendered death, for Truth’s sake, the highest boon to mortal man.",prevail follow brother room perch window sill read performance many slip paper vision boyish day forget scenery much describe more force beauty be impassioned address beauteous land about leave remembrance roman hearth farm child quit pale shadow uncertain be great hiatus middle have many more authority consult summing up complete think last line grand speak noble consul name live add example nerve ardent soul devote life precious call duty object crown pale brow good other own beacon light world self object casting self win visible earthly strife combat good evil true victor chronicle forget true glory rest head sole true glory man attain reflect beam crown shadowy type know give person render death sake high boon mortal man
