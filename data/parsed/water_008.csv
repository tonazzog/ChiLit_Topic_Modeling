3,"And now, my dear little man, what should we learn from this parable?",dear little man learn parable 
4,"We should learn thirty-seven or thirty-nine things, I am not exactly sure which:  but one thing, at least, we may learn, and that is this--when we see efts in the pond, never to throw stones at them, or catch them with crooked pins, or put them into vivariums with sticklebacks, that the sticklebacks may prick them in their poor little stomachs, and make them jump out of the glass into somebody's work-box, and so come to a bad end.  For these efts are nothing else but the water-babies who are stupid and dirty, and will not learn their lessons and keep themselves clean; and, therefore (as comparative anatomists will tell you fifty years hence, though they are not learned enough to tell you now), their skulls grow flat, their jaws grow out, and their brains grow small, and their tails grow long, and they lose all their ribs (which I am sure you would not like to do), and their skins grow dirty and spotted, and they never get into the clear rivers, much less into the great wide sea, but hang about in dirty ponds, and live in the mud, and eat worms, as they deserve to do.",learn thing sure thing least learn see eft pond throw stone catch crooked pin put vivarium stickleback stickleback prick poor little stomach make jump glass work box come bad end eft else water baby stupid dirty learn lesson keep clean comparative anatomist tell year learn tell skull grow flat jaw grow brain grow small tail grow long lose rib sure like do skin grow dirty spot get clear river less great wide sea hang dirty pond live mud eat worm deserve do 
5,"But that is no reason why you should ill-use them:  but only why you should pity them, and be kind to them, and hope that some day they will wake up, and be ashamed of their nasty, dirty, lazy, stupid life, and try to amend, and become something better once more.  For, perhaps, if they do so, then after 379,423 years, nine months, thirteen days, two hours, and twenty-one minutes (for aught that appears to the contrary), if they work very hard and wash very hard all that time, their brains may grow bigger, and their jaws grow smaller, and their ribs come back, and their tails wither off, and they will turn into water-babies again, and perhaps after that into land-babies; and after that perhaps into grown men.",reason ill use pity kind hope day wake ashamed nasty dirty lazy stupid life try amend become good more do year month day hour minute aught appear contrary work wash time brain grow big jaw grow small rib come tail wither turn water baby land baby grow man 
6,"You know they won't?  Very well, I daresay you know best.  But you see, some folks have a great liking for those poor little efts. They never did anybody any harm, or could if they tried; and their only fault is, that they do no good--any more than some thousands of their betters.  But what with ducks, and what with pike, and what with sticklebacks, and what with water-beetles, and what with naughty boys, they are ""sae sair hadden doun,"" as the Scotsmen say, that it is a wonder how they live; and some folks can't help hoping, with good Bishop Butler, that they may have another chance, to make things fair and even, somewhere, somewhen, somehow.",know daresay know good see folk have great like poor little eft do harm try only fault do good more thousand better duck pike stickleback water beetle naughty boy say wonder live folk help hope good have chance make thing fair 
7,"Meanwhile, do you learn your lessons, and thank God that you have plenty of cold water to wash in; and wash in it too, like a true Englishman.  And then, if my story is not true, something better is; and if I am not quite right, still you will be, as long as you stick to hard work and cold water.",learn lesson thank have plenty cold water wash wash true story true good right stick hard work cold water 
8,"But remember always, as I told you at first, that this is all a fairy tale, and only fun and pretence:  and, therefore, you are not to believe a word of it, even if it is true.",remember tell fairy tale fun pretence believe word true
