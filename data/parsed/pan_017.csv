1,CHAPTER 17. WHEN WENDY GREW UP,grew 
2,"I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.",hope want know become other boy wait give time explain count go go stair think make good impression stand row front hat wish wear pirate clothes say eye ask have look forget

39,"“I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.",think fairy dead say 
40,"“There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who was now quite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.”",be lot young one explain authority see new baby laugh first time new fairy bear be new baby be new fairy live nest top tree mauve one boy white one girl blue one little silly sure

53,"“Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:",right say ask politeness see mouth twitch make handsome offer let go week year do spring cleaning prefer permanent arrangement seem spring long come promise send gay have sense time full adventure tell halfpenny worth suppose know last word plaintive one

56,"Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was too late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor [the younger Jenkins]. It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses [the English double-deckers]; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed.",course boy go school most get put top class attend school week see goat remain island late settle ordinary minor young sad have say power fly leave first tie foot bed post fly night diversion day pretend fall bus english double decker cease tug bond bed find hurt let go bus time fly hat want practice call mean believe 
57,"Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself.",believe long other boy jeer come end first year fly frock wove leave berries fear notice short become notice have much say

72,"That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls.",last time girl see little try sake have grow pain feel untrue get prize general knowledge year come go bring careless boy meet married woman more little dust box keep toy grow sorry kind like grow end grow own free will day quick other girl 
73,"All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver [train engineer]. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be Tootles.

76,"She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It was Jane’s nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per cents [mortgage rate] from Wendy’s father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.",call have odd inquire look moment arrive mainland want ask question old ask love hear tell remember very nursery famous flight take place nursery father buy cent mortgage rate father fond stair dead forget 
77,"There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and her nurse’s; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself.",be bed nursery nurse be kennel pass die old age end difficult get convinced know look child 
78,"Once a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy’s part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane’s invention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and her own, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:",week nurse have evening part put bed time story invention raise sheet mother head own make tent awful darkness whisper

Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow.
