2," It was Miss Fenmore. I knew her again at once. And she called me ""my poor little girl""--the very words she had used when she said good-bye to me and looked so sorry before she went away for the Easter holidays, never to come back, though she did not then know it, to Green Bank.",know call poor little girl very word use say good bye look sorry go holiday come know green

8,"""One of the lions?"" she said, smiling. ""You mean the carved lions that Myra is so fond of. No--that was a very funny fancy of yours--a lion with a cap on! It was old Hannah that you saw, the old nurse. She has been watching beside you all night. When you awoke before, I was out. I went out very early.""",lion say smile mean carve lion fond funny fancy lion cap old see old nurse watch night awoke go 
9,"She spoke in a very matter-of-fact way, but rather slowly, as if she wanted to be sure of my understanding what she said. And as my mind cleared and I followed her words I grew more and more anxious to know all there was to hear.",speak matter fact way want sure understanding say mind clear follow word grow anxious know hear 
10,"""I don't understand,"" I said, ""and it hurts me to speak. Is this your house, Miss Fenmore, and how do you know about the lions? And who brought me in here, and why didn't I know when I was put in this bed?""",understand say hurt speak house know lion bring know put bed

16,"""Dr. Fallis,"" I said. ""Oh, I would so like to see him. He could tell me----"" but I stopped.

17,"""You were asleep, dear, but he is coming again,"" said Miss Fenmore quietly. ""He was afraid you had got a sore throat by the way you breathed.

18,"And then she went on to explain it all to me. I was in Mr. Cranston's house!--up above the big show-rooms, where he and old Mrs. Cranston lived. They had found me fast asleep, leaning against one of the lions--the old porter and the boy who went round late in the evening to see that all was right for the night, though when the rooms were shut up earlier no one had noticed me. I was so fast asleep, so utterly exhausted, that I had not awakened when the old man carried me up to the kitchen, just as the servants were about going to bed, to ask what in the world was to be done with me; nor even later, when, on Miss Fenmore's recognising me, they had undressed and settled me for the night in the comfortable old-fashioned ""best bedroom,"" had I opened my eyes or spoken.",go explain house big show room old live find asleep lean lion old porter boy go evening see right night room shut notice fast asleep exhausted awaken old man carry kitchen servant go bed ask world do recognise undress settle night comfortable old fashioned good bedroom open eye speak

23,"""But--but,"" I began; then as the thought of it all came over me still more distinctly I hid my face in the pillow and burst into tears. ""Must I go back to school?"" I said. ""Oh, Miss Fenmore, they will be so angry--I came away without leave, because--because I couldn't bear it, and they said I told what wasn't true--that was almost the worst of all. Fancy if they wrote and told mamma that I told lies.""",begin thought come hide face pillow burst tear go school say angry come leave bear say tell true bad fancy write tell mamma tell lie

25,"""P'raps she means to be,"" I said among my tears, ""but it's Miss Aspinall and--and--Miss Broom. I think I hate her, Miss Fenmore. Oh, I shouldn't say that--I never used to hate anybody.

28,"I swallowed down my tears and began the story of my troubles. Once started I could not have helped telling her all, even if it had hurt my throat much more than it did. And she knew a good deal already. She was a girl of great natural quickness and full of sympathy. She seemed to understand what I had been going through far better than I could put it in words, and when at last, tired out, I left off speaking, she said all she could to comfort me. There was no need for me to trouble about going back to Green Bank just now. Dr. Fallis had said I must stay where I was for the present, and when I saw him I might tell him anything I liked.",swallow tear begin story trouble start help tell hurt throat more know good deal girl great natural quickness full sympathy seem understand go good put word last tired leave speak say comfort be need trouble go green say stay present see tell like

30,"""Was she dreadfully angry?"" I interrupted.",angry interrupt 
31,"""No, dear,"" Miss Fenmore replied. ""She had been terribly frightened about you, and Miss Aspinall and some of the servants had been rushing about everywhere. But Miss Ledbury is very good, as I keep telling you, Geraldine. She is very sorry to hear how unhappy you have been, and if she had known how anxious you were about your father and mother she would have tried to comfort you.

34,"It was not till long afterwards that I knew how very distressed poor old Miss Ledbury had been, and how she had blamed herself for not having tried harder to gain my confidence. Nor did I fully understand at the time how very sensibly Miss Fenmore had behaved when Mr. and Mrs. Cranston sent her off to Green Bank to tell of my having, without intending it, taken refuge with them; she had explained things so that Miss Ledbury, and indeed Miss Aspinall, felt far more sorry for me than angry with me.",know distressed poor old blame try hard gain confidence understand time behave send green tell have intend take refuge explain thing feel sorry angry

36,"""Well, well,"" he began, looking at me with a rather odd smile, ""and how is the little runaway? My dear child, why did you not come to me, instead of wandering all about Great Mexington streets in the dark and the rain? Not that you could have found anywhere better for yourself than this kind house, but you might have been all night downstairs in the cold! Tell me, what made you run away like that--no, don't tell me just yet. It is all right now, but I think you have talked enough. Has she had anything to eat?"" and he turned to Miss Fenmore.

41,"""Mrs. Selwood is abroad, my dear, and not returning till next month,"" said Dr. Fallis; but when he saw how my face fell, he added quickly, ""but I think I can tell you perhaps better than she about your parents. I know the place--Mr. Le Marchant consulted me about it before he decided on going, as he knew I had been there myself in my young days. Unhealthy? No, not if people take proper care. Your father and mother live in the best part--on high ground out of the town--there is never any fever there. And I had a most cheerful letter from your father quite lately. Put all these fears out of your head, my poor child. Please God you will have papa and mamma safe home again before long.

They were in great measure tears of relief--I was so thankful to hear what he said about father and mamma.",cry time tear weak ill great measure tear relief thankful hear say father mamma

44,"""It is quite a different matter to take a child to a hot climate,"" she said. ""Grown-up people can stand much that would be very bad for girls and boys.

47,"""I was very happy with my aunt,"" she said; ""she was like a mother to me. For my mother died when I was a little baby. Yes, my father has been home several times, but he is in India again now, and he won't be able to come back for good till he is quite old. So you have much happier things to look forward to, you see, Geraldine.""",happy aunt say mother mother die little baby father several time able come good old have happy thing look see

50,Miss Fenmore looked up quickly.,look

52,"""Oh!"" I exclaimed. This explained several things. ""Oh yes,"" I went on, ""I remember her, and I know she's Mr. Cranston's grand-daughter--he was speaking of her to mamma one day.

This was Mrs. Cranston.",see lay forget pretty picture make know sight think say lovely child old lady small old lady tall face child notice beauty elderly person see charming 
55,"I felt quite surprised. Mr. Cranston was a rather stout old man, with spectacles and a big nose. I had not thought him at all ""pretty,"" and somehow I had fancied Mrs. Cranston must be something like him, and I gave a sigh of pleasure as the old lady came up to the side of the bed with a gentle smile on her face.",feel surprised stout old man spectacle big nose think fancy give sigh pleasure old lady come side bed gentle smile face

57,"""I've been wanting to see her too,"" I said, half shyly. ""And--please--it's very kind of you to let me stay here in this nice room. I didn't mean to fall asleep downstairs. I only wanted to speak to Mr. Cranston.""",want see say half kind let stay nice room mean fall want speak 
58,"""I'm sure Mr. Cranston would be very pleased to tell you anything he can that you want to know, my dear.

63,"""It doesn't hurt me much,"" I said. ""I daresay I shall be quite well to-morrow. I am so glad I'm here--I wouldn't have liked to be ill at school,"" and I gave a little shudder. ""I'm quite happy now that Dr. Fallis says it's not true about father and mamma getting ill at that place, and I don't want to ask Mr. Cranston anything now, thank you.

69,"Mrs. Cranston left the room then, and Miss Fenmore followed her. I think the old lady had made her a little sign to do so, though I did not see it.

70,"I myself, though feeling tired and disinclined to talk, was really happier than I had been for a very long time. There was a delightful sensation of being safe and at home, even though the kind people who had taken me in, like a poor little stray bird, were strangers. The very look of the old-fashioned room and the comfortable great big four-post bed made me hug myself when I thought how different it all was from the bare cold room at Green Bank, where there had never once been a fire all the weeks I was there. It reminded me of something--what was it? Oh yes, in a minute or two I remembered. It was the room I had once slept in with mamma at grandmamma's house in London, several years before, when I was quite a little girl. For dear grandmamma had died soon after we came to live at Great Mexington. But there was the same comfortable old-fashioned feeling: red curtains to the window and the bed, and a big fire and the shiny dark mahogany furniture. Oh yes, how well I remembered it, and how enormous the bed seemed, and how mamma tucked me in at night and left the door a little open in case I should feel lonely before she came to bed. It all came back to me so that I forgot where I was for the moment, till I felt a little tug given to the hand that Myra was still holding, and heard her voice say very softly,",feel tired disinclined talk happy long time be delightful sensation safe home kind person take poor little stray bird stranger very look old fashioned room comfortable great big post bed make hug think different bare cold room green be fire week remind minute remember room sleep mamma house several year little girl dear grandmamma die come live great be same comfortable old fashioned feeling red curtain window bed big fire shiny dark mahogany furniture remember enormous bed seem mamma tuck night leave door little open case feel lonely come bed come forget moment feel little tug give hand hold hear voice say

How very old-world it would seem to the children of to-day--I wonder if any of you know it? For I am growing quite an old woman myself, and the little history of my childhood that I am telling you will, before long, be half a century in age, though its events seem as clear and distinct to me as if they had only happened quite recently!

89,"I did go to sleep, but Myra was not allowed to see me again that day, nor the next--nor for several days after, except for a very few minutes at a time. For I did not improve as the kind people about me had hoped I would, and Dr. Fallis looked graver when he came that evening than he had done in the morning. Miss Fenmore was afraid she had let me talk too much, but after all I do not think anything would have made any great difference. I had really been falling out of health for months past, and I should probably have got ill in some other way if I had not caught cold in my wanderings. I do not very clearly remember those days of serious illness. I knew whenever I was awake that I was being tenderly cared for, and in the half-dozing, half-dreaming state in which many hours must have been passed, I fancied more than once that mamma was beside me, which made me very happy. And though never actually delirious, I had very strange though not unpleasant dreams, especially about the carved lions; none of them, however, so clear and real as the one I related at full in the last chapter.",go sleep allow see day next several day few minute time improve kind person hope look graver come evening do morning afraid let talk think make great difference fall health month past get ill other way catch cold wandering remember day serious illness know awake care half dozing half dreaming state many hour pass fancy more mamma make happy delirious have strange unpleasant dream carve lion clear real one relate full last chapter
