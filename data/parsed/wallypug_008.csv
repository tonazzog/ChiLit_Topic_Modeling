2," I STOOD at the barred window for some time, watching the Doctor-in-Law rushing about with his papers, and then started back as a huge and disreputable-looking black Crow settled on the stone ledge outside.",stood barr window time watch rush paper start huge disreputable look black settle stone ledge

11,“Certainly not!” I cried emphatically.,cry

17,“Why?” I interrupted.,interrupt

22,"“H’m, you might as well let me have your watch and chain. It will only go to the Doctor-in-Law if you don’t. He is sure to want to grab everything.

I hope so, I’m sure—ha—ha!”",cry wriggle bar go tell say doubt delighted hear opinion induce add punishment hope sure 
25,And the wretched ill-omened bird flew away laughing derisively.,wretch ill omened bird fly laugh 
26,"I could not help feeling rather uncomfortable at the turn which events had taken, for there was no knowing to what lengths the extraordinary inhabitants of this remarkable place might go, and if it had really been decided that the poor Wallypug and myself should be executed on the morrow, then there was no time to be lost in our efforts to effect an escape.",help feel uncomfortable turn event take be know length extraordinary inhabitant remarkable place go decide poor execute morrow be time lose effort effect escape

45,"I plunged into the darkness, and after walking round and round, and down and down, for a considerable time I saw a faint light at the other end. I hurried forward as quickly as I could, and found myself in a dimly-lighted dungeon. The Wallypug was here alone, and was busily cramming everything he could lay his hands on into an enormous carpet-bag.",plunge darkness walk considerable time see faint light other end hurry find light dungeon cramm lay hand enormous carpet bag 
46,"“Thank goodness, you have come!” he exclaimed, in a terrible fluster, when he saw me. “I was afraid you would be too late. We must escape at once if we would save our necks. Fortunately, I have just remembered that this dungeon is connected with the shute which the late Wallypug had constructed between here and Ling Choo, in China, which is on the other side of the world—it is enormously long and very steep, but quite safe—we must use it in order to get away. We are to be executed in the morning if we stay here, so I am informed; therefore, we must lose no time. I have just finished packing up. Ah! What’s that?” he exclaimed, listening intently.",thank goodness come exclaim terrible fluster see afraid late escape save neck remember dungeon connect shute late construct other side world long steep safe use order get execute morning stay inform lose time finish pack exclaim listen 
47,"“Quick! they are coming!” he cried, as sounds were heard in the passage outside the dungeon door; and touching a spring, an enormous opening appeared in the wall.

49,"That we were only just in time was evidenced by the cries of rage and disappointment which pursued us from the dungeon, as the Doctor-in-Law and the other creatures saw us escape from their clutches, and we could hear the Cockatoo’s shrill cries grow fainter and fainter as we sped swiftly down the shute towards Ling Choo.",time evidence cry rage disappointment pursue dungeon other creature see escape clutch hear shrill cry grow fainter fainter spe shute
