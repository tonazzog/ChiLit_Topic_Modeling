2,"Mrs Linacre went to the spring as usual, the next morning.  If the weather had been doubtful--if there had been any pretence for supposing that the day might not be fine, she would have remained at home.  But she looked in vain all round the sky for a cloud: and the wide expanse of fields and meadows in the Levels, with their waving corn and fresh green grass, seemed to bask in the sunshine, as if they felt its luxury. It was a glowing August day;--just such a day as would bring out the invalids from Gainsborough to drink the waters;--just such a day as would tempt the traveller to stop under the shady shed, where he could see waters bubbling up, and taste of the famous medicinal spring, which would cure the present evil of heat, whatever effect it might have on any more lasting ailment.  It was just the day when Mrs Linacre must not be missed from her post, and when it would be wrong to give up the earnings which she might expect before sun-down.  So she desired her children not to leave the premises,--not even to go out of their father's sight and hearing; and left them, secure, at least, that they would obey her wishes.",go spring usual next morning weather doubtful be pretence suppose day fine remain home look vain sky cloud wide expanse field meadow wave corn fresh green grass seem bask sunshine feel luxury glow day day bring invalid drink water day temp traveller stop shady shed see water bubble taste famous medicinal spring cure present evil heat effect have last ailment day miss post wrong give earnings expect sun-down desire child leave premise go father sight hear leave secure least obey wish 
3,"They were quite willing to do so.  Mildred looked behind her, every few minutes, while she worked in the garden, to see whether Roger was not there, and at every rustle that the birds made among the trees on the Red-hill,--the eminence behind the house,--she fancied that some one was hidden there.  Oliver let his tools and his alabaster lie hidden, much as he longed to be at work with them.  Mildred had lost her greatest treasure,--the white hen.  He must take care of his greatest treasure. Twice, in the course of the morning, he went in, having thought of a safer place; and twice more he put them back among the straw, as safest there after all.  He let them alone at last, on Mildred saying that she was afraid Roger might somehow discover why he went in and out so often.",willing do look few minute work garden see rustle bird make tree red hill eminence house fancy one hide let tool alabaster lie hide much long work lose great treasure white hen take care great treasure course morning go think safe place put straw safe let last say afraid discover go 
4,"They ran to the mill three or four times to tell their father that the brown tent was still under the bank in the carr, and that they could see nobody; though the wild-ducks and geese made such a fluttering and noise, now and then, that it seemed as if some one was lurking about the ponds.  Often in the course of the morning, too, did Mr Linacre look out of the mill-window, or nod to them from the top of the steps, that they might see that he did not forget them.  Meantime, the white smoke curled up from the kitchen chimney, as Ailwin cooked the dinner; and little George's voice and hers were often heard from within, as if they were having some fun together.",run mill time tell father brown tent bank carr see wild duck geese make flutter noise seem one lurk pond course morning look mill window nod top step see forget white smoke curl kitchen chimney cook dinner little voice hear have fun 
5,"The children were very hot, and began to say that they were hungry, and thought dinner-time was near, when they suddenly felt a strong rush of wind from the west.  Oliver lost his cap, and was running after it, when both heard a loud shout from their father, and looked up.  They had never heard him shout so loud as he now did, bidding them run up the Red-hill that moment.  He waved his arm and his cap in that direction, as if he was mad.  Mildred scampered up the hill.  She did not know why, nor what was the meaning of the rolling, roaring thunder which seemed to convulse the air: but her head was full of Roger; and she thought it was some mischief of his.  One part of the Red-hill was very steep, and the ground soft.  Her feet slipped on the moss first, and when she had got above the moss, the red earth crumbled; and she went back at every step, till she caught hold of some brambles, and then of the trunk of a tree; so that, trembling and panting, she reached at last the top of the eminence.",child hot begin say hungry think dinner time feel strong rush wind west lose cap run hear loud shout father look hear shout bid run red moment wave arm cap direction mad scamper hill know meaning roll roar thunder seem convulse air head full think mischief part red hill steep ground soft foot slip moss first get moss red earth crumble go step catch hold bramble trunk tree tremble pant reach top eminence 
6,"When she looked round, she saw a rushing, roaring river where the garden had been, just before.  Rough waters were dashing up against the hill on which she stood,--against the house,--and against the mill.  She saw the flood spreading, as rapidly as the light at sunrise, over the whole expanse of the Levels.  She saw another flood bursting in from the Humber, on the north-east, and meeting that which had just swept by;-- she saw the two floods swallowing up field after field, meadow after meadow, splashing up against every house, and surrounding all, so that the roofs, and the stacks beside them, looked like so many little islands.  She saw these things in a moment, but did not heed them till afterwards,--for, where was Oliver?",look see rush roar river garden rough water dash hill stand house mill see flood spread light sunrise whole expanse see flood burst north east meet sweep see flood swallow field field meadow meadow splash house surround roof stack look many little island see thing moment heed 
7,"Oliver was safe, though it was rather a wonder that he was so, considering his care for his cap.  Oliver was an orderly boy, accustomed to take great care of his things; and it did not occur to him to let his cap go, when he had to run for his life.  He had to part with it, however.  He was flying after it, when another shout from his father made him look round; and then he saw the wall of water, as he called it, rolling on directly upon the house.  He gave a prodigious spring across the garden ditch, and up the hill-side, and but just escaped; for the wind which immediately preceded the flood blew him down; and it was clinging to the trunk of a tree that saved him, as his sister had been saved just before.  As it was, his feet were wet.  Oliver panted and trembled like his sister, but he was safe.",safe wonder consider care cap orderly boy accustom take great care thing occur let cap go have run life have part fly shout father make look see wall water call roll house give prodigious spring garden ditch hill side escape wind precede flood blow cling trunk tree save sister save foot wet pant tremble sister safe 
8,"Every one was safe.  Ailwin appeared at an upper window, exhibiting little George.  Mr Linacre stood, with folded arms, in the doorway of his mill; and his wife was (he was thankful to remember) on the side of a high hill, far away.  The children and their father knew, while the flood was roaring between them, what all were thinking of; and at the same moment, the miller and his boy waved, the one his hat, and the other a green bough, high and joyously over their heads.  Little George saw this from the window, and clapped his hands, and jumped, as Ailwin held him on the window-sill.",one safe appear upper window exhibit little stand fold arm doorway mill wife thankful remember side high hill child father know flood roar think same moment miller boy wave one hat other green bough high head little see window clapp hand jump hold window sill

10,"This happy mood could not last very long, however, as the waters, instead of going down, were evidently rising every moment.  From the first, the flood had been too deep and rapid to allow of the miller crossing from his mill to his house.  He was a poor swimmer; and no swimmer, he thought, could have avoided being carried away into the wide marsh, where there was no help.  Then, instead of the stream slackening, it rushed more furiously as it rose,--rose first over the wall of the yard, and up to the fourth--fifth--sixth step of the mill-ladder, and then almost into the branches of the apple-trees in the garden.",happy mood last water go rise moment first flood deep rapid allow miller cross mill house poor swimmer swimmer think avoid carry wide marsh be help stream slackening rush rise rise wall yard fourth fifth sixth step mill ladder branch apple tree garden

Well,--great clay banks were made to keep out the Humber waters, over there, to the north-east, and on the west and north-west yonder, to keep two or three rivers there from overflowing the land. Then several canals and ditches were cut, to drain the land; and there are great gates put up, here and there, to let the waters in and out, as they are wanted.

21,"""Drowned, of course.--Do you know, Mildred,"" he continued, after a silence, during which he was looking towards the sheds in the yard, while his sister's eyes were following the body of the horse as it was swept along, now whirled round in an eddy, and now going clear over the hedge into the carr,--""do you know, Mildred,"" said Oliver, ""I think father will be completely ruined by this flood.""",drown course know continue silence look shed yard sister eye follow body horse sweep whirl eddy go hedge carr know say think father ruin flood

And then I doubt whether the harvest will not be ruined all through the Levels: and I am pretty sure nothing will be growing in the garden when the waters are gone.

32,"The bees were not drowned; but they were in more danger of it than Mildred supposed.  Their little shed was placed on the side of the Red-hill, so as to overlook the flowery garden.  The waters stood among the posts of this shed; and the hives themselves shook with every wave that rolled along.",bee drown more danger suppose little shed place side red hill overlook flowery garden water stand post shed hive shake wave roll

34,"Oliver looked round and nodded, as there was no use in speaking in such a noise.  He presently showed that he did not mean to go round to the front of the shed.  That would never have done; for the flood had washed away the soil there, and left nothing to stand upon.  He broke away the boards at the back of the bee-shed, which were old and loosely fastened. He was glad he had come; for the bees were bustling about in great confusion and distress, evidently aware that something great was the matter.  Oliver seized one of the hives, with the board it stood on, and carried it, as steadily as he could, to a sunny part of the hill, where he put it down on the grass.  He then went for another, asking Mildred to come part of the way down to receive the second hive, and put it by the first, as he saw there was not a moment to lose.  She did so; but she trembled so much, that it was probable she would have let the hive fall, if it had ever been in her hands.  It never was, however.  The soil was now melting away in the water, where Oliver had stood firmly but a few minutes before.  He had to take great care, and to change his footing every instant; and it was not without slipping and sliding, and wet feet, that he brought away the second hive.  Mildred saw how hot he was, as he sat resting, with the hive, before climbing the bank, and begged that he would not try any more.",look nod be use speak noise show mean go front shed do flood wash soil leave stand break board back bee shed old fasten glad come bee bustle great confusion distress aware great matter seize hive board stand carry sunny part hill put grass go ask come part way receive second hive put first see be moment lose tremble probable let hive fall hand soil melt water stand few minute have take great care change footing instant slip slide wet foot bring second hive see hot sit rest hive climb bank begg try more 
35,"""These poor bees!"" exclaimed Oliver, beginning to move again, on the thought of the bees being drowned.  But he had done all he could.  The water boiled up between the shed and the bank, lifted the whole structure, and swept it away.  Oliver hastened to put down the second hive beside the first; and when he returned, saw that the posts had sunk, the boards were floating away, and the remaining hive itself sailing down the stream.",poor bee exclaim begin move thought bee drown do water boil shed bank lift whole structure sweep hasten put second hive first return see post sink board float remain hive sail stream

42,"While he spoke, Oliver was running to the part of the hill which commanded the widest view of the carr, and Mildred was following at his heels,--a good deal startled by the hares which leaped across her path. There seemed to be more hares now on the hill than she had seen in all her life before.  She could not ask about the hares, however, when she saw the brown tent, or a piece of it, flapping about in the water, a great way off, and sweeping along with the current.",speak run part hill command wide view carr follow heel good deal startle hare leap path seem be more hare hill see life ask hare see brown tent piece flap water great way sweep current

47,"They heard nothing more, amidst the dash of the flood, and they fancied they could see some figures moving on the ridge of the bank, far out over the carr.  When they were tired of straining their eyes, they looked about them, and saw, in a smoother piece of water near their hill, a dog swimming, and seeming to labour very much.",hear more dash flood fancy see figure move ridge bank carr tired strain eye look see smooth piece water hill dog swim seem labour

50,"""Yes, cut a long switch,"" cried Mildred: and she pulled and tugged at a long tough thorny bramble, not minding its pricking her fingers and tearing her frock.  She could not help starting at the immense number of large birds that flew out, and rabbits that ran away between her feet, while she was about it; but she never left hold, and dragged the long bramble down to the part of the hill that the dog seemed to be trying to reach.  Oliver was already there, holding a slip of ash, such as he had sometimes cut for a fishing-rod.",cut long switch cry pull tug long tough thorny bramble mind prick finger tear frock help start immense number large bird fly rabbit run foot leave hold drag long bramble part hill dog seem try reach hold slip ash such cut fishing rod

54,"As Oliver spoke, the dog ducked, and came up again without Roger, swimming lightly to the bank, and leaping ashore with a bark.  Roger was there, however,--very near, but they supposed, exhausted, for he seemed to fall back, and sink, on catching hold of Oliver's switch, and by the jerk twitched it out of the boy's hand.",speak dog duck come swim bank leap bark suppose exhaust seem fall sink catching hold switch jerk twitch boy hand

61,"Oliver saw how drenched the poor boy looked, and forgave whatever he might say.  He asked Mildred to go back to the place where they had been standing, opposite the house; and he would come to her there presently. He then begged Roger to slip off his coat and trousers, that they might wring the wet out of them.  He thought they would soon dry in the sun. But Roger pushed him away with his shoulder, and said he knew what he wanted;--he wanted to see what he had got about him.  He would knock anybody down who touched his pockets.  It was plain that Roger did not choose to be helped in any way; so Oliver soon ran off, and joined Mildred, as he had promised.",see drench poor boy look forgive say ask go place stand house come begg slip coat trousers wring wet think dry sun push shoulder say know want want see get knock touch pocket plain choose help way run join promise

64,"Both children shouted that Roger was here, and pointed behind them; but it was plain that their father could not make out a word they said, though they had never called out so loud in their lives.

65,"The children thought their father was growing very anxious.  He still waved his hat to them, now and then, when he looked their way; but they saw him gazing abroad, as if surprised that the rush of waters did not abate.  They observed him glance often round the sky, as if for signs of wind; and they longed to know whether he thought a wind would do good or harm.  They saw him bring out, for the third time, a rope which he had seemed to think too short to be of any use; and this appeared to be the case, now as at first.  Then he stooped down, as if to make a mark on the side of the white door-post (for the water had by this time quite hidden the steps); and Oliver thought this was to make out, for certain, whether the flood was regularly rising or not.  They could not imagine why he examined so closely as they saw him do the door lintel, and the window-frame.  It did not occur to them, as it did to him, that the mill might break down under the force of the current.",child think father grow anxious wave hat look way see gaze surprise rush water abate observe glance sky sign wind long know think wind do good harm see bring third time rope seem think short use appear case first stoop make mark side white door post water have time hide step think make certain flood rise imagine examine see do door lintel window frame occur do mill break force current

96,"The children were aghast at the wickedness of this deed.  They would not believe it.  It would have been tyrannical and cruel to have obliged the settlers, who were not interested in a quarrel between the king of England and his people, to enlist, and be shot down in war.  They would have complained of this as tyrannical and cruel.  But when they were living in peace and quiet on their farms, paying their rents, and inclined to show good-will to everybody, to pull up the flood-gates, and let in the sea and the rivers to drown them because they lived in the king's lands, was a cruelty too dreadful to be believed.  Oliver and Mildred did not believe it.  They were sure their father would not believe it; and that their mother, if ever she should return to her home and family, would bring a very different account--that the whole misfortune would turn out to be accidental.  So they felt assured: but the fact was as Roger had said.  The Snow-sewer sluice had been pulled up, by the orders of the Committee of the Parliament, then sitting at Lincoln: and it was done to destroy the king's new lands, and deprive him of the support of his tenants.  The jealous country-people round hoped also that it would prevent foreigners from coming to live in England, however much they might want such a refuge.",child aghast wickedness deed believe tyrannical cruel oblige settler interested quarrel king person enlist shoot war complain tyrannical cruel live peace quiet farm pay rent inclined show good pull flood gate let sea river drown live king land cruelty dreadful believe believe sure father believe mother return home family bring different account whole misfortune turn accidental feel assure fact say sewer sluice pull order sit do destroy king new land deprive support tenant jealous country person hope prevent foreigner come live want refuge
