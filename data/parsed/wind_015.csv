1,CHAPTER XV. THE MEWS,
2," IT WAS late in the afternoon when Diamond and his mother and the baby reached London. I was so full of Diamond that I forgot to tell you a baby had arrived in the meantime. His father was waiting for them with his own cab, but they had not told Diamond who the horse was; for his father wanted to enjoy the pleasure of his surprise when he found it out. He got in with his mother without looking at the horse, and his father having put up Diamond’s carpet-bag and his mother’s little trunk, got upon the box himself and drove off; and Diamond was quite proud of riding home in his father’s own carriage. But when he got to the mews, he could not help being a little dismayed at first; and if he had never been to the back of the north wind, I am afraid he would have cried a little. But instead of that, he said to himself it was a fine thing all the old furniture was there. And instead of helping his mother to be miserable at the change, he began to find out all the advantages of the place; for every place has some advantages, and they are always better worth knowing than the disadvantages. Certainly the weather was depressing, for a thick, dull, persistent rain was falling by the time they reached home. But happily the weather is very changeable; and besides, there was a good fire burning in the room, which their neighbour with the drunken husband had attended to for them; and the tea-things were put out, and the kettle was boiling on the fire. And with a good fire, and tea and bread and butter, things cannot be said to be miserable.",afternoon mother baby reach full forget tell baby arrive meantime father wait own cab tell horse father want enjoy pleasure surprise find get mother look horse father put carpet bag mother little trunk get box drive proud ride father own carriage get mew help little dismay first back north wind afraid cry little say fine thing old furniture help mother miserable change begin find advantage place place have advantage good worth know disadvantage weather depressing thick dull persistent rain fall time reach weather changeable be good fire burn room neighbour drunken husband attend tea thing put kettle boil fire good fire tea bread butter thing say miserable 
3,"Diamond’s father and mother were, notwithstanding, rather miserable, and Diamond began to feel a kind of darkness beginning to spread over his own mind. But the same moment he said to himself, “This will never do. I can’t give in to this. I’ve been to the back of the north wind. Things go right there, and so I must try to get things to go right here. I’ve got to fight the miserable things. They shan’t make me miserable if I can help it.” I do not mean that he thought these very words. They are perhaps too grown-up for him to have thought, but they represent the kind of thing that was in his heart and his head. And when heart and head go together, nothing can stand before them.",father mother miserable begin feel kind darkness begin spread own mind same moment say do give back north wind thing go try get thing go get fight miserable thing make miserable help mean think very word grow think represent kind thing heart head heart head go stand

7,"“Sit still, Diamond,” said his mother. “Go on with your bread and butter. You’re not strong enough to lift him yet.”",sit say mother go bread butter strong lift 
8,"So she took the baby herself, and set him on her knee. Then Diamond began to amuse him, and went on till the little fellow was shrieking with laughter. For the baby’s world was his mother’s arms; and the drizzling rain, and the dreary mews, and even his father’s troubled face could not touch him. What cared baby for the loss of a hundred situations? Yet neither father nor mother thought him hard-hearted because he crowed and laughed in the middle of their troubles. On the contrary, his crowing and laughing were infectious. His little heart was so full of merriment that it could not hold it all, and it ran over into theirs. Father and mother began to laugh too, and Diamond laughed till he had a fit of coughing which frightened his mother, and made them all stop. His father took the baby, and his mother put him to bed.",take baby set knee begin amuse go little fellow shriek laughter baby world mother arm drizzling rain dreary mew father troubled face touch care baby loss situation father mother think hard hearted crow laugh middle trouble contrary crowing laugh infectious little heart full merriment hold run father mother begin laugh laugh have fit cough frighten mother make stop father take baby mother put bed 
9,"But it was indeed a change to them all, not only from Sandwich, but from their old place, instead of the great river where the huge barges with their mighty brown and yellow sails went tacking from side to side like little pleasure-skiffs, and where the long thin boats shot past with eight and sometimes twelve rowers, their windows now looked out upon a dirty paved yard. And there was no garden more for Diamond to run into when he pleased, with gay flowers about his feet, and solemn sun-filled trees over his head. Neither was there a wooden wall at the back of his bed with a hole in it for North Wind to come in at when she liked. Indeed, there was such a high wall, and there were so many houses about the mews, that North Wind seldom got into the place at all, except when something must be done, and she had a grand cleaning out like other housewives; while the partition at the head of Diamond’s new bed only divided it from the room occupied by a cabman who drank too much beer, and came home chiefly to quarrel with his wife and pinch his children. It was dreadful to Diamond to hear the scolding and the crying. But it could not make him miserable, because he had been at the back of the north wind.",change old place great river huge barge mighty brown yellow sail go tack side side little pleasure skiff long thin boat shoot rower window look dirty paved yard be garden more run pleased gay flower foot solemn sun fill tree head be wooden wall back bed hole come like be high wall be many house mew get place do have grand cleaning other housewive partition head new bed divide room occupy cabman drink much beer come quarrel wife pinch child dreadful hear scolding cry make miserable back north wind 
10,"If my reader find it hard to believe that Diamond should be so good, he must remember that he had been to the back of the north wind. If he never knew a boy so good, did he ever know a boy that had been to the back of the north wind? It was not in the least strange of Diamond to behave as he did; on the contrary, it was thoroughly sensible of him.",reader find hard believe good remember back north wind know boy good know boy back north wind least strange behave contrary sensible
