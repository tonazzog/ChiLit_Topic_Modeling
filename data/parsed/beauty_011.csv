2," The longer I lived at Birtwick the more proud and happy I felt at having such a place. Our master and mistress were respected and beloved by all who knew them; they were good and kind to everybody and everything; not only men and women, but horses and donkeys, dogs and cats, cattle and birds; there was no oppressed or ill-used creature that had not a friend in them, and their servants took the same tone. If any of the village children were known to treat any creature cruelly they soon heard about it from the Hall.",long live proud happy feel have place master mistress respect beloved know good kind man woman horse donkey dog cat cattle bird be oppress ill use creature have friend servant take same tone village child know treat creature hear 
3,"The squire and Farmer Grey had worked together, as they said, for more than twenty years to get check-reins on the cart-horses done away with, and in our parts you seldom saw them; and sometimes, if mistress met a heavily laden horse with his head strained up she would stop the carriage and get out, and reason with the driver in her sweet serious voice, and try to show him how foolish and cruel it was.",squire work say more year get check rein cart horse do part see mistress meet laden horse head strain stop carriage get reason driver sweet serious voice try show foolish cruel 
4,"I don’t think any man could withstand our mistress. I wish all ladies were like her. Our master, too, used to come down very heavy sometimes. I remember he was riding me toward home one morning when we saw a powerful man driving toward us in a light pony chaise, with a beautiful little bay pony, with slender legs and a high-bred sensitive head and face. Just as he came to the park gates the little thing turned toward them; the man, without word or warning, wrenched the creature’s head round with such a force and suddenness that he nearly threw it on its haunches. Recovering itself it was going on, when he began to lash it furiously. The pony plunged forward, but the strong, heavy hand held the pretty creature back with force almost enough to break its jaw, while the whip still cut into him. It was a dreadful sight to me, for I knew what fearful pain it gave that delicate little mouth; but master gave me the word, and we were up with him in a second.",think man withstand mistress wish lady master use come heavy remember ride home morning see powerful man drive light pony chaise beautiful little bay pony slender leg high breed sensitive head face come park gate little thing turn man word warning wrench creature head force suddenness throw haunch recover go begin lash pony plunge strong heavy hand hold pretty creature force break jaw whip cut dreadful sight know fearful pain give delicate little mouth master give word second 
5,"“Sawyer,” he cried in a stern voice, “is that pony made of flesh and blood?”",cry stern voice pony make flesh blood 
6,"“Flesh and blood and temper,” he said; “he’s too fond of his own will, and that won’t suit me.” He spoke as if he was in a strong passion. He was a builder who had often been to the park on business.",flesh blood temper say fond own will suit speak strong passion builder park business 
7,"“And do you think,” said master sternly, “that treatment like this will make him fond of your will?”",think say master treatment make fond will 
8,“He had no business to make that turn; his road was straight on!” said the man roughly.,have business make turn road straight say man 
9,"“You have often driven that pony up to my place,” said master; “it only shows the creature’s memory and intelligence; how did he know that you were not going there again? But that has little to do with it. I must say, Mr. Sawyer, that a more unmanly, brutal treatment of a little pony it was never my painful lot to witness, and by giving way to such passion you injure your own character as much, nay more, than you injure your horse; and remember, we shall all have to be judged according to our works, whether they be toward man or toward beast.”",drive pony place say master show creature memory intelligence know go have little do say unmanly brutal treatment little pony painful lot witness give way such passion injure own character much more injure horse remember have judge accord work man beast 
10,"Master rode me home slowly, and I could tell by his voice how the thing had grieved him. He was just as free to speak to gentlemen of his own rank as to those below him; for another day, when we were out, we met a Captain Langley, a friend of our master’s; he was driving a splendid pair of grays in a kind of break. After a little conversation the captain said:",master ride tell voice thing grieve free speak gentleman own rank day meet friend master drive splendid pair gray kind break little conversation captain say 
11,"“What do you think of my new team, Mr. Douglas? You know, you are the judge of horses in these parts, and I should like your opinion.”",think new team know judge horse part like opinion 
12,"The master backed me a little, so as to get a good view of them. “They are an uncommonly handsome pair,” he said, “and if they are as good as they look I am sure you need not wish for anything better; but I see you still hold that pet scheme of yours for worrying your horses and lessening their power.”",master back little get good view handsome pair say good look sure wish good see hold pet scheme worry horse lessen power 
13,"“What do you mean,” said the other, “the check-reins? Oh, ah! I know that’s a hobby of yours; well, the fact is, I like to see my horses hold their heads up.”",mean say other check rein know hobby fact like see horse hold head 
14,"“So do I,” said master, “as well as any man, but I don’t like to see them held up; that takes all the shine out of it. Now, you are a military man, Langley, and no doubt like to see your regiment look well on parade, ‘heads up’, and all that; but you would not take much credit for your drill if all your men had their heads tied to a backboard! It might not be much harm on parade, except to worry and fatigue them; but how would it be in a bayonet charge against the enemy, when they want the free use of every muscle, and all their strength thrown forward? I would not give much for their chance of victory. And it is just the same with horses: you fret and worry their tempers, and decrease their power; you will not let them throw their weight against their work, and so they have to do too much with their joints and muscles, and of course it wears them up faster. You may depend upon it, horses were intended to have their heads free, as free as men’s are; and if we could act a little more according to common sense, and a good deal less according to fashion, we should find many things work easier; besides, you know as well as I that if a horse makes a false step, he has much less chance of recovering himself if his head and neck are fastened back. And now,”  said the master, laughing, “I have given my hobby a good trot out, can’t you make up your mind to mount him, too, captain? Your example would go a long way.”",say master man like see hold take shine military man like see regiment look parade head take much credit drill man have head tie backboard much harm parade worry fatigue bayonet charge enemy want free use muscle strength throw give much chance victory same horse fret worry temper decrease power let throw weight work have do much joint muscle course wear fast depend horse intend have head free free man act little accord common sense good deal accord fashion find many thing work easy know horse make false step have less chance recover head neck fasten say master laugh give hobby good trot make mind mount captain example go long way 
15,"“I believe you are right in theory,” said the other, “and that’s rather a hard hit about the soldiers; but--well--I’ll think about it,” and so they parted.",believe right theory say other hard hit soldier think part
