1,CHAPTER III. OLD DIAMOND,old diamond 
2," DIAMOND woke very early in the morning, and thought what a curious dream he had had. But the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head, until it did not look altogether like a dream, and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night. He came to the conclusion that, if he had really been brought home to his mother by Mrs. Crump, she would say something to him about it, and that would settle the matter. Then he got up and dressed himself, but, finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring, he went down the ladder to the stable. There he found that even old Diamond was not awake yet, for he, as well as young Diamond, always got up the moment he woke, and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw.",wake morning think curious dream have memory grow bright bright head look dream begin doubt wind last night come conclusion bring mother say settle matter get dress find father mother stir go ladder stable find old awake young get moment wake lie flat horse lie nice trim bed straw 
3,"“I’ll give old Diamond a surprise,” thought the boy; and creeping up very softly, before the horse knew, he was astride of his back. Then it was young Diamond’s turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected; for as with an earthquake, with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither, a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs, young Diamond found himself hoisted up in the air, with both hands twisted in the horse’s mane. The next instant old Diamond lashed out with both his hind legs, and giving one cry of terror young Diamond found himself lying on his neck, with his arms as far round it as they would go. But then the horse stood as still as a stone, except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back. For when he heard young Diamond’s cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about; for young Diamond was a good boy, and old Diamond was a good horse, and the one was all right on the back of the other.",give old surprise think boy creep horse know astride back young turn have more surprise expect earthquake rumbling rock hither sprawling leg heaving many back young find hoist air hand twist horse mane next instant old lash hind leg give cry terror young find lie neck arm go horse stand stone lift head let boy slip back hear young cry know be kick young good boy old good horse one right back other 
4,"As soon as Diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place, the horse began pulling at the hay, and the boy began thinking. He had never mounted Diamond himself before, and he had never got off him without being lifted down. So he sat, while the horse ate, wondering how he was to reach the ground.",get comfortable saddle place horse begin pull hay boy begin think mount get lift sit horse eat wonder reach ground 
5,"But while he meditated, his mother woke, and her first thought was to see her boy. She had visited him twice during the night, and found him sleeping quietly. Now his bed was empty, and she was frightened.",meditate mother wake first thought see boy visit night find sleep bed empty frighten 
6,"“Diamond! Diamond! Where are you, Diamond?” she called out.",diamond diamond call 
7,"Diamond turned his head where he sat like a knight on his steed in enchanted stall, and cried aloud,--",turn head sit knight steed enchanted stall cry 
8,"“Here, mother!”",mother 
9,"“Where, Diamond?” she returned.",return 
10,"“Here, mother, on Diamond’s back.”",mother 
11,"She came running to the ladder, and peeping down, saw him aloft on the great horse.",come run ladder peep see great horse 
12,"“Come down, Diamond,” she said.",come say 
13,"“I can’t,” answered Diamond.",answer 
14,“How did you get up?” asked his mother.,get ask mother 
15,"“Quite easily,” answered he; “but when I got up, Diamond would get up too, and so here I am.”",answer get get 
16,"His mother thought he had been walking in his sleep again, and hurried down the ladder. She did not much like going up to the horse, for she had not been used to horses; but she would have gone into a lion’s den, not to say a horse’s stall, to help her boy. So she went and lifted him off Diamond’s back, and felt braver all her life after. She carried him in her arms up to her room; but, afraid of frightening him at his own sleep-walking, as she supposed it, said nothing about last night. Before the next day was over, Diamond had almost concluded the whole adventure a dream.",mother think walk sleep hurry ladder like go horse use horse go lion dan say horse stall help boy go lift feel brave life carry arm room afraid frightening own sleep walking suppose say last night next day conclude whole adventure dream 
17,"For a week his mother watched him very carefully--going into the loft several times a night--as often, in fact, as she woke. Every time she found him fast asleep.",week mother watch go loft several time night fact wake time find asleep 
18,"All that week it was hard weather. The grass showed white in the morning with the hoar-frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade. And as Diamond’s shoes were not good, and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him, she would not let him run out. He played all his games over and over indoors, especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby’s cradle; and if they did not go very fast, they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world, although one of them had only three legs, and the other only half a back.",week hard weather grass show white morning hoar frost cling tiny comfit blade shoe good mother save enough money get new pair want let run play game drive chair harness baby cradle go go expect good chair world have leg other back 
19,"At length his mother brought home his new shoes, and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour.",length mother bring new shoe find fit tell run yard amuse hour 
20,"The sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage. All the world was new to him. A great fire of sunset burned on the top of the gate that led from the stables to the house; above the fire in the sky lay a large lake of green light, above that a golden cloud, and over that the blue of the wintry heavens. And Diamond thought that, next to his own home, he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky. For it is not fine things that make home a nice place, but your mother and your father.",sun go fly door bird cage world new great fire sunset burn top gate lead stable house fire sky lay large lake green light golden cloud blue wintry heaven think own home see place like much live sky fine thing make nice place mother father 
21,"As he was looking at the lovely colours, the gates were thrown open, and there was old Diamond and his friend in the carriage, dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats. And in they came. Diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him, but, careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape, with a red edge to every fold, he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables. To be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery.",look lovely colour gate throw open be old friend carriage dance impatience get stall oat come least afraid father drive careful spoil grand show make fine horse multitudinous cape red edge fold slip way let dash stable safe have step recess door lead yard shrubbery 
22,"As he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream. And once more he was almost sure that it was no dream. At all events, he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then. He opened the door, and passed through the little belt of shrubbery. Not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn. Even the brave old chrysanthemums and Christmas roses had passed away before the frost. What? Yes! There was one! He ran and knelt down to look at it.",stand remember wind drive same spot night dream more sure dream event go see thing look open door pass little belt shrubbery flower see bed lawn brave old chrysanthemuum rose pass frost be run knolt look 
23,"It was a primrose--a dwarfish thing, but perfect in shape--a baby-wonder. As he stooped his face to see it close, a little wind began to blow, and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered, but the primrose lay still in the green hollow, looking up at the sky, and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all. It was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with. All at once Diamond thought it was saying its prayers, and he ought not to be staring at it so. He ran to the stable to see his father make Diamond’s bed. Then his father took him in his arms, carried him up the ladder, and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea.",primrose dwarfish thing perfect shape baby wonder stoop face see little wind begin blow long leave stand flower shake wave quiver primrose lay green hollow look sky seem know wind blow eye dull black wintry earth open look sky think say prayer stare run stable see father make bed father take arm carry ladder set table go have tea 
24,"“Miss is very poorly,” said Diamond’s father. “Mis’ess has been to the doctor with her to-day, and she looked very glum when she came out again. I was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said.”",say father doctor day look glum come watch see doctor say 
25,“And didn’t Miss look glum too?” asked his mother.,miss look glum ask mother 
26,"“Not half as glum as Mis’ess,” returned the coachman. “You see--”",half glum return coachman see 
27,"But he lowered his voice, and Diamond could not make out more than a word here and there. For Diamond’s father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at, and one of the best of drivers, but one of the most discreet of servants as well. Therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife, whom he had proved better than himself long ago, and was careful that even Diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family.",lower voice make more word father fine coachmen look good driver discreet servant talk family affair one wife prove good careful hear repeat concern master family 
28,"It was bed-time soon, and Diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep.",bed time go bed fall asleep 
29,"He awoke all at once, in the dark.",awoke dark 
30,"“Open the window, Diamond,” said a voice.",open window say voice 
31,Now Diamond’s mother had once more pasted up North Wind’s window.,mother have paste window 
32,“Are you North Wind?” said Diamond: “I don’t hear you blowing.”,say hear blow 
33,"“No; but you hear me talking. Open the window, for I haven’t overmuch time.”",hear talk open window overmuch time 
34,"“Yes,” returned Diamond. “But, please, North Wind, where’s the use? You left me all alone last time.”",return use leave last time 
35,"He had got up on his knees, and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall. For now that North Wind spoke again, he remembered all that had taken place before as distinctly as if it had happened only last night.",get knee busy nail paper hole wall speak remember take place happen last night 
36,"“Yes, but that was your fault,” returned North Wind. “I had work to do; and, besides, a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting.”",fault return have work do gentleman keep lady wait 
37,"“But I’m not a gentleman,” said Diamond, scratching away at the paper.",gentleman say scratch paper 
38,“I hope you won’t say so ten years after this.”,hope say year 
39,"“I’m going to be a coachman, and a coachman is not a gentleman,”  persisted Diamond.",go coachman coachman gentleman persist 
40,"“We call your father a gentleman in our house,” said North Wind.",call father gentleman house say 
41,"“He doesn’t call himself one,” said Diamond.",call say 
42,"“That’s of no consequence: every man ought to be a gentleman, and your father is one.”",consequence man gentleman father 
43,"Diamond was so pleased to hear this that he scratched at the paper like ten mice, and getting hold of the edge of it, tore it off. The next instant a young girl glided across the bed, and stood upon the floor.",pleased hear scratch paper mouse get hold edge tore next instant young girl glide bed stand floor 
44,"“Oh dear!” said Diamond, quite dismayed; “I didn’t know--who are you, please?”",dear say dismay know 
45,“I’m North Wind.”,
46,“Are you really?”,
47,“Yes. Make haste.”,make haste

52,“Yes.”,
53,"“Make haste, then, if you want to go with me.”",make haste want go 
54,“But you are not big enough to take care of me. I think you are only Miss North Wind.”,big take care think 
55,"“I am big enough to show you the way, anyhow. But if you won’t come, why, you must stay.”",big show way come stay 
56,"“I must dress myself. I didn’t mind with a grown lady, but I couldn’t go with a little girl in my night-gown.”",dress mind grow lady go little girl night gown 
57,"“Very well. I’m not in such a hurry as I was the other night. Dress as fast as you can, and I’ll go and shake the primrose leaves till you come.”",hurry other night dress go shake primrose leave come 
58,"“Don’t hurt it,” said Diamond.",hurt say 
59,"North Wind broke out in a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles, and was gone in a moment. Diamond saw--for it was a starlit night, and the mass of hay was at a low ebb now--the gleam of something vanishing down the stair, and, springing out of bed, dressed himself as fast as ever he could. Then he crept out into the yard, through the door in the wall, and away to the primrose. Behind it stood North Wind, leaning over it, and looking at the flower as if she had been its mother.",break little laugh breaking silver bubble gone moment see starlit night mass hay low ebb gleam vanish stair spring bed dress creep yard door wall primrose stand lean look flower mother 
60,"“Come along,” she said, jumping up and holding out her hand.",come say jump hold hand 
61,"Diamond took her hand. It was cold, but so pleasant and full of life, it was better than warm. She led him across the garden. With one bound she was on the top of the wall. Diamond was left at the foot.",take hand cold pleasant full life good warm lead garden bind top wall leave foot 
62,"“Stop, stop!” he cried. “Please, I can’t jump like that.”",stop stop cry jump 
63,"“You don’t try” said North Wind, who from the top looked down a foot taller than before.",try say top look foot tall 
64,"“Give me your hand again, and I will, try” said Diamond.",give hand try say 
65,"She reached down, Diamond laid hold of her hand, gave a great spring, and stood beside her.",reach lay hold hand give great spring stand 
66,“This is nice!” he said.,nice say 
67,"Another bound, and they stood in the road by the river. It was full tide, and the stars were shining clear in its depths, for it lay still, waiting for the turn to run down again to the sea. They walked along its side. But they had not walked far before its surface was covered with ripples, and the stars had vanished from its bosom.",bind stand road river full tide star shine clear depth lay wait turn run sea walk side walk surface cover ripple star vanish bosom 
68,"And North Wind was now tall as a full-grown girl. Her hair was flying about her head, and the wind was blowing a breeze down the river. But she turned aside and went up a narrow lane, and as she went her hair fell down around her.",tall full grow girl hair fly head wind blow breeze river turn go narrow lane go hair fall 
69,"“I have some rather disagreeable work to do to-night,” she said, “before I get out to sea, and I must set about it at once. The disagreeable work must be looked after first.”",have disagreeable work do night say get sea set disagreeable work look 
70,"So saying, she laid hold of Diamond and began to run, gliding along faster and faster. Diamond kept up with her as well as he could. She made many turnings and windings, apparently because it was not quite easy to get him over walls and houses. Once they ran through a hall where they found back and front doors open. At the foot of the stair North Wind stood still, and Diamond, hearing a great growl, started in terror, and there, instead of North Wind, was a huge wolf by his side. He let go his hold in dismay, and the wolf bounded up the stair. The windows of the house rattled and shook as if guns were firing, and the sound of a great fall came from above. Diamond stood with white face staring up at the landing.",say lay hold begin run glide fast fast keep make many turning winding easy get wall house run hall find front door open foot stair stand hear great growl start terror huge wolf side let go hold dismay wolf bound stair window house rattle shake gun fire sound great fall come stand white face stare landing 
71,"“Surely,” he thought, “North Wind can’t be eating one of the children!”  Coming to himself all at once, he rushed after her with his little fist clenched. There were ladies in long trains going up and down the stairs, and gentlemen in white neckties attending on them, who stared at him, but none of them were of the people of the house, and they said nothing. Before he reached the head of the stair, however, North Wind met him, took him by the hand, and hurried down and out of the house.",think eat child come rush little fist clench be lady long train go stair gentleman white neckty attend stare person house say reach head stair meet take hand hurry house 
72,"“I hope you haven’t eaten a baby, North Wind!” said Diamond, very solemnly.",hope eat baby say 
73,"North Wind laughed merrily, and went tripping on faster. Her grassy robe swept and swirled about her steps, and wherever it passed over withered leaves, they went fleeing and whirling in spirals, and running on their edges like wheels, all about her feet.",laugh go trip fast grassy robe sweep swirl step pass wither leave go flee whirl spiral run edge wheel foot 
74,"“No,” she said at last, “I did not eat a baby. You would not have had to ask that foolish question if you had not let go your hold of me. You would have seen how I served a nurse that was calling a child bad names, and telling her she was wicked. She had been drinking. I saw an ugly gin bottle in a cupboard.”",say last eat baby have ask foolish question let go hold see serve nurse call child bad name tell wicked drink see ugly gin bottle cupboard 
75,“And you frightened her?” said Diamond.,frighten say 
76,"“I believe so!” answered North Wind laughing merrily. “I flew at her throat, and she tumbled over on the floor with such a crash that they ran in. She’ll be turned away to-morrow--and quite time, if they knew as much as I do.”",believe answer laugh fly throat tumble floor crash run turn time know much do 
77,“But didn’t you frighten the little one?”,frighten little one 
78,“She never saw me. The woman would not have seen me either if she had not been wicked.”,see woman see wicked 
79,"“Oh!” said Diamond, dubiously.",say 
80,"“Why should you see things,” returned North Wind, “that you wouldn’t understand or know what to do with? Good people see good things; bad people, bad things.”",see thing return understand know do good person see good thing bad person bad thing 
81,“Then are you a bad thing?”,bad thing 
82,"“No. For you see me, Diamond, dear,” said the girl, and she looked down at him, and Diamond saw the loving eyes of the great lady beaming from the depths of her falling hair.",see dear say girl look see loving eye great lady beam depth falling hair 
83,"“I had to make myself look like a bad thing before she could see me. If I had put on any other shape than a wolf’s she would not have seen me, for that is what is growing to be her own shape inside of her.”",have make look bad thing see put other shape wolf see grow own shape 
84,"“I don’t know what you mean,” said Diamond, “but I suppose it’s all right.”",know mean say suppose right 
85,"They were now climbing the slope of a grassy ascent. It was Primrose Hill, in fact, although Diamond had never heard of it. The moment they reached the top, North Wind stood and turned her face towards London The stars were still shining clear and cold overhead. There was not a cloud to be seen. The air was sharp, but Diamond did not find it cold.",climb slope grassy ascent fact hear moment reach top stand turn face star shine clear cold be cloud see air sharp find cold 
86,"“Now,” said the lady, “whatever you do, do not let my hand go. I might have lost you the last time, only I was not in a hurry then: now I am in a hurry.”",say lady do let hand go lose last time hurry hurry
