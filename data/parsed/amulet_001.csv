1,CHAPTER 1. THE PSAMMEAD,chapter psammead 
2,"There were once four children who spent their summer holidays in a white house, happily situated between a sandpit and a chalkpit. One day they had the good fortune to find in the sandpit a strange creature. Its eyes were on long horns like snail’s eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes. It had ears like a bat’s ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider’s and covered with thick soft fur--and it had hands and feet like a monkey’s. It told the children--whose names were Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane--that it was a Psammead or sand-fairy. (Psammead is pronounced Sammy-ad.) It was old, old, old, and its birthday was almost at the very beginning of everything. And it had been buried in the sand for thousands of years. But it still kept its fairylikeness, and part of this fairylikeness was its power to give people whatever they wished for. You know fairies have always been able to do this. Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane now found their wishes come true; but, somehow, they never could think of just the right things to wish for, and their wishes sometimes turned out very oddly indeed. In the end their unwise wishings landed them in what Robert called ‘a very tight place indeed’, and the Psammead consented to help them out of it in return for their promise never never to ask it to grant them any more wishes, and never to tell anyone about it, because it did not want to be bothered to give wishes to anyone ever any more. At the moment of parting Jane said politely--",be child spend summer holiday white house situate sandpit chalkpit day have good fortune find sandpit strange creature eye long horn snail eye move telescope have ear bat ear tubby body shape spider cover thick soft fur have hand foot monkey tell child name psammead sand fairy pronounce ad old old old birthday very beginning bury sand thousand year keep fairylikeness part fairylikeness power give person wish know fairy able do find wish come true think right thing wish wish turn end unwise wishing land call tight place consent help return promise ask grant more wish tell want bother give wish more moment parting say

5,"‘The children DID see the Psammead again, but it was not in the sandpit; it was--but I must say no more--’",child see sandpit say more 
6,"The reason that nothing more could be said was that I had not then been able to find out exactly when and where the children met the Psammead again. Of course I knew they would meet it, because it was a beast of its word, and when it said a thing would happen, that thing happened without fail. How different from the people who tell us about what weather it is going to be on Thursday next, in London, the South Coast, and Channel!",reason more say able find child meet course know meet beast word say thing happen thing happen fail different person tell weather go 
7,"The summer holidays during which the Psammead had been found and the wishes given had been wonderful holidays in the country, and the children had the highest hopes of just such another holiday for the next summer. The winter holidays were beguiled by the wonderful happenings of The Phoenix and the Carpet, and the loss of these two treasures would have left the children in despair, but for the splendid hope of their next holiday in the country. The world, they felt, and indeed had some reason to feel, was full of wonderful things--and they were really the sort of people that wonderful things happen to. So they looked forward to the summer holiday; but when it came everything was different, and very, very horrid. Father had to go out to Manchuria to telegraph news about the war to the tiresome paper he wrote for--the Daily Bellower, or something like that, was its name. And Mother, poor dear Mother, was away in Madeira, because she had been very ill. And The Lamb--I mean the baby--was with her. And Aunt Emma, who was Mother’s sister, had suddenly married Uncle Reginald, who was Father’s brother, and they had gone to China, which is much too far off for you to expect to be asked to spend the holidays in, however fond your aunt and uncle may be of you. So the children were left in the care of old Nurse, who lived in Fitzroy Street, near the British Museum, and though she was always very kind to them, and indeed spoiled them far more than would be good for the most grown-up of us, the four children felt perfectly wretched, and when the cab had driven off with Father and all his boxes and guns and the sheepskin, with blankets and the aluminium mess-kit inside it, the stoutest heart quailed, and the girls broke down altogether, and sobbed in each other’s arms, while the boys each looked out of one of the long gloomy windows of the parlour, and tried to pretend that no boy would be such a muff as to cry.",summer holiday find wish give wonderful holiday country child have high hope holiday next summer winter holiday beguil wonderful happening loss treasure leave child despair splendid hope next holiday country world feel have reason feel full wonderful thing sort person wonderful thing happen look summer holiday come different horrid have go telegraph news war tiresome paper write daily name mother poor dear ill mean baby sister marry brother go expect ask spend holiday fond aunt uncle child leave care old live british kind spoiled more good grow up child feel wretch cab drive box gun sheepskin blanket aluminium mess kit stoutest heart quail girl break sobb other arm boy look long gloomy window parlour try pretend boy muff cry 
8,"I hope you notice that they were not cowardly enough to cry till their Father had gone; they knew he had quite enough to upset him without that. But when he was gone everyone felt as if it had been trying not to cry all its life, and that it must cry now, if it died for it. So they cried.",hope notice cowardly cry father go know have enough upset gone feel try cry life cry die cry 
9,"Tea--with shrimps and watercress--cheered them a little. The watercress was arranged in a hedge round a fat glass salt-cellar, a tasteful device they had never seen before. But it was not a cheerful meal.",tea-- shrimp watercress cheer little watercress arrange hedge fat glass salt cellar tasteful device see cheerful meal 
10,"After tea Anthea went up to the room that had been Father’s, and when she saw how dreadfully he wasn’t there, and remembered how every minute was taking him further and further from her, and nearer and nearer to the guns of the Russians, she cried a little more. Then she thought of Mother, ill and alone, and perhaps at that very moment wanting a little girl to put eau-de-cologne on her head, and make her sudden cups of tea, and she cried more than ever. And then she remembered what Mother had said, the night before she went away, about Anthea being the eldest girl, and about trying to make the others happy, and things like that. So she stopped crying, and thought instead. And when she had thought as long as she could bear she washed her face and combed her hair, and went down to the others, trying her best to look as though crying were an exercise she had never even heard of.",tea go room see remember minute take gun cry little more think ill alone very moment want little girl put head make sudden cup tea cry more remember say night go old girl try make other happy thing stop cry think think bear wash face comb hair go other try good look cry exercise hear 
11,"She found the parlour in deepest gloom, hardly relieved at all by the efforts of Robert, who, to make the time pass, was pulling Jane’s hair--not hard, but just enough to tease.",find parlour deep gloom relieve effort make time pass pull hair hard tease 
12,"‘Look here,’ said Anthea. ‘Let’s have a palaver.’ This word dated from the awful day when Cyril had carelessly wished that there were Red Indians in England--and there had been. The word brought back memories of last summer holidays and everyone groaned; they thought of the white house with the beautiful tangled garden--late roses, asters, marigold, sweet mignonette, and feathery asparagus--of the wilderness which someone had once meant to make into an orchard, but which was now, as Father said, ‘five acres of thistles haunted by the ghosts of baby cherry-trees’. They thought of the view across the valley, where the lime-kilns looked like Aladdin’s palaces in the sunshine, and they thought of their own sandpit, with its fringe of yellowy grasses and pale-stringy-stalked wild flowers, and the little holes in the cliff that were the little sand-martins’ little front doors. And they thought of the free fresh air smelling of thyme and sweetbriar, and the scent of the wood-smoke from the cottages in the lane--and they looked round old Nurse’s stuffy parlour, and Jane said--",look say let have palaver word date awful day wish be red be word bring memory last summer holiday groan think white house beautiful tangle garden late rose aster marigold sweet mignonette feathery asparagus wilderness mean make orchard say acre thistle haunt ghost baby cherry tree think view valley lime kiln look palace sunshine think own sandpit fringe yellowy grasse pale stringy stalked wild flower little hole cliff little sand little front door think free fresh air smelling thyme sweetbriar scent wood smoke cottage lane look old stuffy parlour say 
13,"‘Oh, how different it all is!’",different 
14,"It was. Old Nurse had been in the habit of letting lodgings, till Father gave her the children to take care of. And her rooms were furnished ‘for letting’. Now it is a very odd thing that no one ever seems to furnish a room ‘for letting’ in a bit the same way as one would furnish it for living in. This room had heavy dark red stuff curtains--the colour that blood would not make a stain on--with coarse lace curtains inside. The carpet was yellow, and violet, with bits of grey and brown oilcloth in odd places. The fireplace had shavings and tinsel in it. There was a very varnished mahogany chiffonier, or sideboard, with a lock that wouldn’t act. There were hard chairs--far too many of them--with crochet antimacassars slipping off their seats, all of which sloped the wrong way. The table wore a cloth of a cruel green colour with a yellow chain-stitch pattern round it. Over the fireplace was a looking-glass that made you look much uglier than you really were, however plain you might be to begin with. Then there was a mantelboard with maroon plush and wool fringe that did not match the plush; a dreary clock like a black marble tomb--it was silent as the grave too, for it had long since forgotten how to tick. And there were painted glass vases that never had any flowers in, and a painted tambourine that no one ever played, and painted brackets with nothing on them.",old habit let lodging give child take care room furnish let odd thing seem furnish room let bit same way furnish live room have heavy dark red stuff curtain colour blood make stain coarse lace curtain carpet yellow violet bit grey brown oilcloth odd place fireplace have shaving tinsel be varnish mahogany chiffonier sideboard lock act be hard chair many crochet antimacassar slip seat slope wrong way table wear cloth cruel green colour yellow chain stitch pattern fireplace look glass make look ugly plain begin be mantelboard maroon plush wool fringe match plush dreary clock black marble tomb silent grave forget tick be paint glass vase have flower paint tambourine play paint bracket

32,"So they went, old Nurse only begging them to be careful of crossings, and to ask a policeman to assist in the more difficult cases. But they were used to crossings, for they had lived in Camden Town and knew the Kentish Town Road where the trams rush up and down like mad at all hours of the day and night, and seem as though, if anything, they would rather run over you than not.",go old nurse begg careful crossing ask policeman assist difficult case use crossing live know kentish tram rush mad hour day night seem run

35,"Between Fitzroy Street and St James’s Park there are a great many streets, and, if you go the right way you will pass a great many shops that you cannot possibly help stopping to look at. The children stopped to look at several with gold-lace and beads and pictures and jewellery and dresses, and hats, and oysters and lobsters in their windows, and their sorrow did not seem nearly so impossible to bear as it had done in the best parlour at No. 300, Fitzroy Street.",be great many street go right way pass great many shop help stop look child stop look several gold lace bead picture jewellery dress hat oyster lobster window sorrow seem impossible bear do good parlour no. 
36,"Presently, by some wonderful chance turn of Robert’s (who had been voted Captain because the girls thought it would be good for him--and indeed he thought so himself--and of course Cyril couldn’t vote against him because it would have looked like a mean jealousy), they came into the little interesting criss-crossy streets that held the most interesting shops of all--the shops where live things were sold. There was one shop window entirely filled with cages, and all sorts of beautiful birds in them. The children were delighted till they remembered how they had once wished for wings themselves, and had had them--and then they felt how desperately unhappy anything with wings must be if it is shut up in a cage and not allowed to fly.",wonderful chance turn vote girl think good think course vote look mean jealousy come little interesting criss -crossy street hold interesting shop shop live thing sell be shop window fill cage sort beautiful bird child delight remember wish wing have feel unhappy wing shut cage allow fly 
37,"‘It must be fairly beastly to be a bird in a cage,’ said Cyril. ‘Come on!’",beastly bird cage say come 
38,"They went on, and Cyril tried to think out a scheme for making his fortune as a gold-digger at Klondyke, and then buying all the caged birds in the world and setting them free. Then they came to a shop that sold cats, but the cats were in cages, and the children could not help wishing someone would buy all the cats and put them on hearthrugs, which are the proper places for cats. And there was the dog-shop, and that was not a happy thing to look at either, because all the dogs were chained or caged, and all the dogs, big and little, looked at the four children with sad wistful eyes and wagged beseeching tails as if they were trying to say, ‘Buy me! buy me! buy me! and let me go for a walk with you; oh, do buy me, and buy my poor brothers too! Do! do! do!’ They almost said, ‘Do! do! do!’ plain to the ear, as they whined; all but one big Irish terrier, and he growled when Jane patted him.",go try think scheme make fortune gold digger buy cage bird world set free come shop sell cat cat cage child help wish buy cat put hearthrug proper place cat be dog shop happy thing look dog chain cage dog big little look child sad wistful eye wagg beseeching tail try say buy buy buy let go walk buy buy poor brother do do say do do do plain ear whine big irish terrier growl patt

41,"Of course they could not buy any of the dogs. They did, indeed, ask the price of the very, very smallest, and it was sixty-five pounds--but that was because it was a Japanese toy spaniel like the Queen once had her portrait painted with, when she was only Princess of Wales. But the children thought, if the smallest was all that money, the biggest would run into thousands--so they went on.",course buy dog ask price small pound japanese toy spaniel have portrait paint child think small money big run thousand go 
42,"And they did not stop at any more cat or dog or bird shops, but passed them by, and at last they came to a shop that seemed as though it only sold creatures that did not much mind where they were--such as goldfish and white mice, and sea-anemones and other aquarium beasts, and lizards and toads, and hedgehogs and tortoises, and tame rabbits and guinea-pigs. And there they stopped for a long time, and fed the guinea-pigs with bits of bread through the cage-bars, and wondered whether it would be possible to keep a sandy-coloured double-lop in the basement of the house in Fitzroy Street.",stop more cat dog bird shop pass last come shop seem sell creature mind such goldfish white mouse sea anemone other aquarium beast lizard toad hedgehog tortoise tame rabbit guinea pig stop long time feed guinea pig bit bread cage bar wonder possible keep sandy coloured double lop basement house

50,"They stood there on the pavement, a cause of some inconvenience to the passersby, and thus beguiled the time with conversation. Cyril was leaning his elbow on the top of a hutch that had seemed empty when they had inspected the whole edifice of hutches one by one, and he was trying to reawaken the interest of a hedgehog that had curled itself into a ball earlier in the interview, when a small, soft voice just below his elbow said, quietly, plainly and quite unmistakably--not in any squeak or whine that had to be translated--but in downright common English--",stand pavement cause inconvenience passersby beguil time conversation lean elbow top hutch seem empty inspect whole edifice hutch try reawaken interest hedgehog curl ball interview small soft voice elbow say squeak whine have translate downright common

56,"‘Listen,’ said the Psammead, in a voice that sounded as though it would begin to cry in a minute, ‘I don’t think the creature who keeps this shop will ask a very high price for me. I’ve bitten him more than once, and I’ve made myself look as common as I can. He’s never had a glance from my beautiful, beautiful eyes. Tell the others I’m here--but tell them to look at some of those low, common beasts while I’m talking to you. The creature inside mustn’t think you care much about me, or he’ll put a price upon me far, far beyond your means. I remember in the dear old days last summer you never had much money. Oh--I never thought I should be so glad to see you--I never did.’ It sniffed, and shot out its long snail’s eyes expressly to drop a tear well away from its fur. ‘Tell the others I’m here, and then I’ll tell you exactly what to do about buying me.’ Cyril tied his bootlace into a hard knot, stood up and addressed the others in firm tones--",listen say voice sound begin cry minute think creature keep shop ask high price bit more make look common have glance beautiful beautiful eye tell other tell look low common beast talk creature think care much put price means remember dear old day last summer have much money think glad see sniff shoot long snail eye drop tear fur tell other tell do buy tie bootlace hard knot stand address other firm tone
