4,"""Hilloa!"" exclaimed the skipper with a sudden start, next morning, as he saw Eric's recumbent figure on the ratlin-stuff, ""Who be this young varmint!""",exclaim skipper sudden start next morning see recumbent figure ratlin stuff young varmint 
5,"""Oh, I brought him aboord last night,"" said Davey; ""he wanted to be cabun-buoy.""",bring last night say want cabun buoy 
6,"""Precious like un _he_ looks. Never mind, we've got him and we'll use him.""",precious look mind get use 
7,"The vessel was under way when Eric woke, and collected his scattered thoughts to a remembrance of his new position. At first, as the Stormy Petrel dashed its way gallantly through the blue sea, he felt one absorbing sense of joy to have escaped from Roslyn. But before he had been three hours on board, his eyes were opened to the trying nature of his circumstances, which were, indeed, _so_ trying that _anything_ in the world seemed preferable to enduring them. He had not been three hours on board when he would have given everything in his power to be back again; but such regrets were useless, for the vessel was now fairly on her way for Corunna, where she was to take in a cargo of cattle.",vessel way wake collect scatter thought remembrance new position stormy dash way blue sea feel absorb sense joy escape hour board eye open try nature circumstance try world seem preferable endure hour board give power such regret useless vessel way take cargo cattle 
8,"There were eight men belonging to the crew; and as the ship was only a little trading schooner, these were sailors of the lowest and meanest grade. They all seemed to take their cue from the captain, who was a drunken, blaspheming, and cruel vagabond.",be man belong crew ship little trading schooner sailor low mean grade seem take cue captain drunken blaspheming cruel vagabond 
9,"This man from the first took a savage hatred to Eric, partly because he was annoyed with Davey for bringing him on board. The first words he addressed to him were--",man first take savage hatred annoyed bring board first word address 
10,"""I say, you young lubber, you must pay your footing.""",say young lubber pay footing 
11,"""I've got nothing to pay with. I brought no money with me.""",get pay bring money 
12,"""Well, then, you shall give us your gran' clothes. Them things isn't fit for a cabin-boy.""",give gran' clothes thing fit cabin boy 
13,"Eric saw no remedy, and making a virtue of necessity, exchanged his good cloth suit for a rough sailor's shirt and trowsers, not over clean, which the captain gave him. His own clothes were at once appropriated by that functionary, who carried them into his cabin. But it was lucky for Eric that, seeing how matters were likely to go, he had succeeded in secreting his watch.",see remedy make virtue necessity exchange good cloth suit rough sailor shirt trowser clean captain give own clothes appropriate functionary carry cabin lucky see matter likely go succeed secret watch 
14,"The day grew misty and comfortless, and towards evening the wind rose to a storm. Eric soon began to feel very sick, and, to make his case worse, could not endure either the taste, smell, or sight of such coarse food as was contemptuously flung to him.",day grow misty comfortless evening wind rise storm begin feel sick make case bad endure taste smell sight such coarse food flung 
15,"""Where am I to sleep?"" he asked, ""I feel very sick.""",sleep ask feel sick 
16,"""Babby,"" said one of the sailors, ""what's your name?""",say sailor name 
17,"""Williams.""",
18,"""Well, Bill, you'll have to get over your sickness pretty soon, _I_ can tell ye. Here,"" he added, relenting a little, ""Davey's slung ye a hammock in the forecastle.""",have get sickness tell add relent little sling ye hammock forecastle 
19,"He showed the way, but poor Eric in the dark, and amid the lurches of the vessel, could hardly steady himself down the companion-ladder, much less get into his hammock. The man saw his condition, and, sulkily enough, hove him into his place.",show way poor dark lurch vessel steady companion ladder get hammock man see condition hove place 
20,"And there, in that swinging bed, where sleep seemed impossible, and out of which, he was often thrown, when the ship rolled and pitched through the dark, heaving, discolored waves, and with dirty men sleeping round him at night, until the atmosphere of the forecastle became like poison, hopelessly and helplessly sick, and half-starved, the boy lay for two days. The crew neglected him shamefully. It was nobody's business to wait on him, and he could procure neither sufficient food, nor any water; they only brought him some grog to drink, which in his weakness and sickness was nauseous to him as medicine.",swing bed sleep seem impossible throw ship roll pitch dark heave discolor wave dirty man sleep night atmosphere forecastle become poison sick half starve boy lay day crew neglect business wait procure sufficient food water bring grog drink weakness sickness nauseous medicine 
21,"""I say, you young cub down there,"" shouted the skipper to him from the hatchway, ""come up and swab this deck.""",say young cub shout skipper hatchway come swab deck 
22,"He got up, and after bruising himself severely, as he stumbled about to find the ladder, made an effort to obey the command. But he staggered from feebleness when he reached the deck, and had to grasp for some fresh support at every step.",get bruise stumble find ladder make effort obey command stagger feebleness reach deck have grasp fresh support step 
23,"""None of that 'ere slobbering and shamming, Bill. Why, d---- you, what d'ye think you're here for, eh? You swab the deck, and in five minutes, or I'll teach you, and be d----d.""",slobber shamm think swab deck minute teach 
24,"Sick as death, Eric slowly obeyed, but did not get through his task without many blows and curses. He felt very ill--he had no means of washing or cleaning himself; no brush, or comb, or soap, or clean linen; and even his sleep seemed unrefreshful when the waking brought no change in his condition. And then the whole life of the ship was odious to him. His sense of refinement was exquisitely keen, and now to be called Bill, and kicked and cuffed about by these gross-minded men, and to hear their rough, coarse, drunken talk, and sometimes endure their still, more intolerable familiarities, filled him with deeply-seated loathing.",sick death obey get task many blow curse feel ill have means wash clean brush comb soap clean linen sleep seem unrefreshful wake bring change condition whole life ship odious sense refinement keen call kick cuff gross minded man hear rough coarse drunken talk endure intolerable familiarity fill seat loathing 
25,"His whole soul rebelled and revolted from them all, and, seeing his fastidious pride, not one of them showed him the least glimpse of open kindness, though he observed that one of them did seem to pity him in heart.",whole soul rebell revolt see fastidious pride show least glimpse open kindness observe seem pity heart 
26,"Things grew worse and worse. The perils which he had to endure at first, when ordered about the rigging, were what affected him least; he longed for death, and often contemplated flinging himself into those cold deep waves which he gazed on daily over the vessel's side. Hope was the only thing which supported him. He had heard from one of the crew that the vessel would be back in not more than six weeks, and he made a deeply seated resolve to escape the very first day that they again anchored in an English harbor.",thing grow bad bad peril have endure order rigging affect least long death contemplate fling cold deep wave gaze vessel side hope only thing support hear crew vessel more week make seat resolve escape very first day anchore english harbor 
27,"The homeward voyage was even more intolerable, for the cattle on board greatly increased the amount of necessary menial and disgusting work which fell to his snare, as well as made the atmosphere of the close little schooner twice as poisonous as before. And to add to his miseries, his relations with the crew got more and more unfavorable, and began to reach their climax.",homeward voyage intolerable cattle board increase amount necessary menial disgusting work fall snare make atmosphere close little schooner poisonous add misery relation crew get more unfavorable begin reach climax 
28,"One night the sailor who occupied the hammock next to his heard him winding up his watch. This he always did in the dark, as secretly and silently as he could, and never looked at it, except when no one could observe him; while, during the day, he kept both watch and chain concealed in his trousers.",night sailor occupy hammock hear wind watch do dark look observe day keep watch chain conceal trousers 
29,"Next morning the man made proposals to him to sell the watch, and tried by every species of threat and promise to extort it from him. But the watch had been his mother's gift, and he was resolute never to part with it into such hands.",next morning man make proposal sell watch try species threat promise extort watch mother gift resolute part such hand 
30,"""Very well, you young shaver, I shall tell the skipper and he'll soon get it out of you as your footing, depend on it.""",young shaver tell skipper get footing depend 
31,"The fellow was as good as his word, and the skipper demanded the watch as pay for Eric's feed, for he maintained that he'd done no work, and was perfectly useless. Eric, grown desperate, still refused, and the man struck him brutally on the face, and at the same time aimed a kick at him, which he vainly tried to avoid. It caught him on the knee-cap, and put it out, causing him the most excruciating agony.",fellow good word skipper demand watch pay feed maintain do work useless grow desperate refuse man strike face same time aim kick try avoid catch knee cap put cause excruciating agony 
32,"He now could do no work whatever, not even swab the deck. It was only with difficulty that he could limp along, and every move caused him violent pain. He grew listless and dejected, and sat all day on the vessel's side, eagerly straining his eyes to catch any sight of land, or gazing vacantly into the weary sameness of sea and sky.",do work swab deck difficulty limp move cause violent pain grow listless deject sit day vessel side strain eye catch sight land gaze weary sameness sea sky 
33,"Once, when it was rather gusty weather, all hands were wanted, and the skipper ordered him to furl a sail.",gusty weather hand want skipper order furl sail 
34,"""I can't,"" said Eric, in an accent of despair, barely stirring, and not lifting his eyes to the man's unfeeling face.",say accent despair stir lift eye man unfeeling face 
35,"""Can't, d---- you. Can't. We'll soon see whether you can or no! You do it, or _I_ shall have to mend your leg for you;"" and he showered down a storm of oaths.",see do have mend leg shower storm oath 
36,"Eric rose, and resolutely tried to mount the rigging, determined at least to give no ground he could help to their wilful cruelty. But the effort was vain, and with a sharp cry of suffering he dropped once more on deck.",rise try mount rigging determine least give ground help wilful cruelty effort vain sharp cry suffering drop more deck 
37,"""Cursed young brat! I suppose you think we're going to bother ourselves with you, and yer impudence, and get victuals for nothing. It's all sham. Here, Jim, tie him up.""",curse young brat suppose think go bother impudence get victual sham tie 
38,"A stout sailor seized the unresisting boy, tied his hands together, and then drew them up above his head, and strung them to the rigging.",stout sailor seize unresisting boy tie hand draw head string rigging 
39,"""Why didn't ye strip him first, d---- you?"" roared the skipper.",strip roar skipper 
40,"""He's only got that blue shirt on, and that's soon mended,"" said the man, taking hold of the collar of the shirt on both sides, and tearing it open with a great rip.",get blue shirt mend say man take hold collar shirt side tear open great rip 
41,"Eric's white back was bare, his hands tied up, his head hanging, and his injured leg slightly lifted from the ground. ""And now for some rope-pie for the stubborn young lubber,"" said the skipper, lifting a bit of rope as he spoke.",white back bare hand tie head hang injured leg lift ground rope pie stubborn young lubber say skipper lift bit rope speak 
42,"Eric, with a shudder, heard it whistle through the air, and the next instant it had descended on his back with a dull thump, rasping away a red line of flesh. Now Eric knew for the first time the awful reality of intense pain; he had determined to utter no sound, to give no sign; but when the horrible rope fell on him, griding across his back, and making his body literally creak under the blow, he quivered like an aspen-leaf in every limb, and could not suppress the harrowing murmur, ""Oh God, help me, help me.""",shudder hear whistle air next instant descend back dull thump rasp red line flesh know first time awful reality intense pain determine utter sound give sign horrible rope fall gride back make body creak blow quiver aspen leaf limb suppress harrowing murmur help help 
43,"Again the rope whistled in the air, again it grided across the boy's naked back, and once more the crimson furrow bore witness to the violent laceration. A sharp shriek of inexpressible agony rang from his lips, so shrill, so heart-rending, that it sounded long in the memory of all who heard it. But the brute who administered the torture was untouched. Once more, and again, the rope rose and fell, and under its marks the blood first dribbled, and then streamed from the white and tender skin.",rope whistle air gride boy naked back crimson furrow bear witness violent laceration sharp shriek inexpressible agony ring lip shrill heart rending sound memory hear brute administer torture untouched more rope rise fall mark blood dribble stream white tender skin 
44,"But Eric felt no more; that scream had been the last effort of nature; his head had dropped on his bosom, and though his limbs still seemed to creep at the unnatural infliction, he had fainted away.",feel more scream last effort nature head drop bosom limb seem creep unnatural infliction faint 
45,"""Stop, master, stop, if you don't want to kill the boy outright,"" said Roberts, one of the crew, stepping forward, while the hot flush of indignation burned through his tanned and weather-beaten cheek. The sailors called him ""Softy Bob,"" from that half-gentleness of disposition which had made him, alone of all the men, speak one kind or consoling word for the proud and lonely cabin-boy.",stop master stop want kill boy say crew step hot flush indignation burn tanned weather beat cheek sailor call half gentleness disposition make alone man speak kind consol word proud lonely cabin boy 
46,"""Undo him then, and be--,"" growled the skipper and rolled off to drink himself drunk.",undo growl skipper roll drink drunk 
47,"""I doubt he's well-nigh done for him already,"" said Roberts, quickly untying Eric's hands, round which the cords had been pulled so tight as to leave two blue rings round his wrists. ""Poor fellow, poor fellow! it's all over now,"" he murmured soothingly, as the boy's body fell motionless into his arms, which he hastily stretched to prevent him from tumbling on the deck.",doubt nigh do say unty hand cord pull tight leave blue ring wrist poor fellow poor fellow murmure boy body fall motionless arm stretch prevent tumble deck 
48,"But Eric heard not; and the man, touched with the deepest pity, carried him down tenderly into his hammock, and wrapped him up in a clean blanket, and sat by him till the swoon should be over.",hear man touch deep pity carry hammock wrap clean blanket sit swoon 
49,"It lasted very long, and the sailor began to fear that his words had been prophetic.",last sailor begin fear word prophetic 
50,"""How is the young varmint?"" shouted the skipper, looking into the forecastle.",young varmint shout skipper look forecastle 
51,"""You've killed him, I think.""",kill think 
52,The only answer was a volley of oaths; but the fellow was sufficiently frightened to order Roberts to do all he could for his patient.,only answer volley oath fellow frighten order do patient 
53,"At last Eric woke with a moan. To think was too painful, but the raw state of his back, ulcerated with the cruelty he had undergone, reminded him too bitterly of his situation. Roberts did for him all that could be done, but for a week Eric lay in that dark and fetid place, in the languishing of absolute despair. Often and often the unbidden tears flowed from very weakness from his eyes, and in the sickness of his heart, and the torment of his wounded body, he thought that he should die.",last wake moan think painful raw state back ulcerate cruelty undergone remind situation do do week lay dark fetid place languishing absolute despair unbidden tear flow weakness eye sickness heart torment wound body think die 
54,"But youth is very strong, and it wrestled with despair, and agony, and death, and, after a time, Eric could rise from his comfortless hammock. The news that land was in sight first roused him, and with the help of Roberts, he was carried on deck, thankful, with childlike gratitude, that God suffered him to breathe once more the pure air of heaven, and sit under the canopy of its gold-pervaded blue. The breeze and the sunlight refreshed him, as they might a broken flower; and, with eyes upraised, he poured from his heart a prayer of deep unspeakable thankfulness to a Father in Heaven.",youth strong wrestle despair agony death time rise comfortless hammock news land sight rouse help carry deck thankful childlike gratitude suffer breathe pure air heaven sit canopy gold pervade blue breeze sunlight refresh break flower eye upraise pour heart prayer deep unspeakable thankfulness father 
55,"Yes! at last he had remembered his Father's home. There, in the dark berth, where every move caused irritation, and the unclean atmosphere brooded over his senses like lead; when his forehead burned, and his heart melted within him, and he had felt almost inclined to curse his life, or even to end it by crawling up and committing himself to the deep cold water which, he heard rippling on the vessel's side; then, even then, in that valley of the shadow of death, a Voice had come to him--a still small Voice--at whose holy and healing utterance Eric had bowed his head, and listened to the messages of God, and learnt his will; and now, in humble resignation, in touching penitence with solemn self-devotion, he had cast himself at the feet of Jesus, and prayed to be helped, and guided, and forgiven. One little star of hope rose in the darkness of his solitude, and its rays grew brighter and brighter, till they were glorious now. Yes, for Jesus' sake he was washed, he was cleansed, he was sanctified, he was justified; he would fear no evil, for God was with him and underneath were the everlasting arms.",last remember home dark berth move cause irritation unclean atmosphere brood sense lead forehead burn heart melt feel inclined curse life end crawl commit deep cold water hear ripple vessel side valley shadow death come small voice holy heal utterance bow head listen message learn will humble resignation touch penitence solemn self devotion cast foot pray help guide forgive little star hope rise darkness solitude ray grow bright bright glorious sake wash cleanse sanctify justify fear evil everlasting arm 
56,"And while he sat there, undisturbed at last, and unmolested by harsh word or savage blow, recovering health with every breath of the sea wind, the skipper came up to him, and muttered something half-like an apology.",sit undisturbed last unmolested harsh word savage blow recover health breath sea wind skipper come mutter half apology 
57,"The sight of him, and the sound of his voice, made Eric shudder again, but he listened meekly, and, with no flash of scorn or horror, put out his hand to the man to shake. There was something touching and noble in the gesture, and, thoroughly ashamed of himself for once, the fellow shook the proffered hand, and slunk away.",sight sound voice make shudder listen flash scorn horror put hand man shake be touch noble gesture ashamed fellow shake proffer hand slunk 
58,They entered the broad river at Southpool.,enter broad river 
59,"""I must leave the ship when we get to port, Roberts,"" said Eric.",leave ship get port say 
60,"""I doubt whether you'll let you,"" answered Roberts, jerking his finger towards the skipper's cabin.",doubt let answer jerk finger skipper cabin 
61,"""Why?""",
62,"""He'll be afeard you might take the law on him.""",afeard take law 
63,"""He needn't fear.""",need fear 
64,Roberts only shook his head.,shake head 
65,"""Then I must run away somehow. Will you help me?""",run help 
66,"""Yes, that I will.""",
67,"That very evening Eric escaped from the Stormy Petrel, unknown to all but Roberts. They were in the dock, and he dropped into the water in the evening, and swam to the pier, which was only a yard or two distant; but the effort almost exhausted his strength, for his knee was still painful, and he was very weak.",very evening escape stormy unknown dock drop water evening swim pier yard distant effort exhaust strength knee painful weak 
68,"Wet and penniless, he knew not where to go, but spent the sleepless night under an arch. Early the next morning he went to a pawnbroker's, and raised £2:10s. on his watch, with which money he walked straight to the railway station.",wet penniless know go spend sleepless night arch next morning go pawnbroker raise watch money walk railway station 
69,"It was July, and the Roslyn summer holidays had commenced. As Eric dragged his slow way to the station, he suddenly saw Wildney on the other side of the street. His first impulse was to spring to meet him, as he would have done in old times. His whole heart yearned towards him. It was six weeks now since Eric had seen one loving face, and during all that time he had hardly heard one kindly word. And now he saw before him the boy whom he loved so fondly, with whom he had spent so many happy hours of school-boy friendship, with whom he had gone through so many schoolboy adventures, and who, he believed, loved him fondly still.",summer holiday commence drag slow way station see other side street first impulse spring meet do old time whole heart yearn week see loving face time hear kindly word see boy love spend many happy hour school boy friendship go many schoolboy adventure believe love 
70,"Forgetful for the moment of his condition, Eric moved across the street. Wildney was walking with his cousin, a beautiful girl, some four years older than himself, whom he was evidently patronising immensely. They were talking very merrily, and Eric overheard the word Roslyn. Like a lightning-flash the memory of the theft, the memory of his ruin came upon him; he looked down at his dress--it was a coarse blue shirt, which Roberts had given him in place of his old one, and the back of it was stained and saturated with blood from his unhealed wounds; his trousers were dirty, tarred, and ragged, and his shoes, full of holes, barely covered his feet. He remembered too that for weeks he had not been able to wash, and that very morning, as he saw himself in a looking-glass at a shop-window, he had been deeply shocked at his own appearance. His face was white as a sheet, the fair hair matted and tangled, the eyes sunken and surrounded with a dark color, and dead and lustreless. No! he could not meet Wildney as a sick and ragged sailor-boy; perhaps even he might not be recognised if he did. He drew back, and hid himself till the merry-hearted pair had passed, and it was almost with a pang of jealousy that he saw how happy Wildney could be, while _he_ was thus; but he cast aside the unworthy thought at once. ""After all, how is poor Charlie to know what has happened to me?""",forgetful moment condition move street walk cousin beautiful girl year old patronise talk overhear word lightning flash memory theft memory ruin come look dress coarse blue shirt give place old one back stain saturate blood unhealed wound trousers dirty tar ragged shoe full hole cover foot remember week able wash very morning see look glass shop window shocked own appearance face white sheet fair hair matt tangle eye sink surround dark color dead lustreless meet sick ragged sailor boy recognise draw hide merry hearted pair pass pang jealousy see happy cast unworthy thought poor know happen
