1,CHAPTER XI. Little Meg's Baby,little baby 
2,"The new year came, but Meg's father had not arrived.  Kitty was having a mad outburst, as if she had so long controlled herself that now it was necessary to break out into extra wickedness.  She came home late every night, very drunk, and shouting loud snatches of songs, which wakened up the inmates of the lower stories, and drew upon her a storm of oaths.  But she continued always good-natured and kind to Meg, and insisted upon having the daily charge of Robin and the baby, though Meg left them in her care with a very troubled and anxious spirit.  Things were looking very dark to the poor little woman; but she kept up as brave a heart as she could, waiting from day to day for that long-deferred coming of her father, in which she believed so firmly.",new year come father arrive have mad outburst control necessary break extra wickedness come night drunk shouting loud snatch song waken inmate low story draw storm oath continue good natured kind insist have daily charge baby leave care troubled anxious spirit thing look dark poor little woman keep brave heart wait day day long deferre come father believe 
3,"It was a little later than usual one evening, for the days were creeping out since the new year, when Meg climbed wearily upstairs to Kitty's attic, in search of her children, but found that they were not there.  Mr Grigg told her that he had seen Kitty take them out with her in the afternoon; and even while he was speaking, Meg saw her staggering and rolling into the court, with the baby fast asleep in her drunken arms.  Meg took it from her without a word, and led Robin away upstairs.  Robin's face was flushed, and his hand was very hot; but the baby lay in her arms heavily, without any movement or sign of life, except that the breath came through her parted lips, and her eyelids stirred a little.  Meg locked the door of her attic, and laid her baby on the bed, while she lighted the fire and got their tea ready.  Robin looked strange, but he chattered away without ceasing, while he watched her set the things in readiness.  But the baby would not awake.  It lay quite still on Meg's lap, and she poured a little warm tea into its mouth, but it did not swallow it, only slept there with heavy eyelids, and moving neither finger nor foot, in a strange, profound slumber.  It was smaller and thinner than when mother died, thought Meg; and she lifted up the lifeless little hand to her lips, half hoping that its eyes would unclose a little more, and that sweet, loving smile, with which it always welcomed her return, would brighten its languid face. But baby was too soundly asleep to smile.",little late usual evening day creep new year climb attic search child find tell see take afternoon speak see staggering roll court baby asleep drunken arm take word lead face flush hand hot baby lay arm movement sign life breath come part lip eyelid stirr little lock door attic lay baby bed light fire get tea ready look strange chatter cease watch set thing readiness baby awake lay lap pour little warm tea mouth swallow sleep heavy eyelid move finger foot strange profound slumber small thin mother die think lift lifeless little hand lip half hope eye unclose little more sweet loving smile welcome return bright languid face baby asleep smile 
4,"Little Meg sat up all night, with the baby lying on her lap, moaning a little now and then as its slumbers grew more broken, but never lifting up its eyelids to look into her face and know it.  When the morning dawned it was still the same.  Could the baby be ill? asked Meg of herself.  It did not seem to be in any pain; yet she carried it to the door, and called softly for Kitty to come and look at it; but there was no reply, only from below came up harsh sounds of children screaming and angry women quarrelling.  Oaths and threats and shrieks were all the answer Meg's feeble cry received.  She sat down again on her mother's low chair before the fire, and made the baby comfortable on her lap; while Robin stood at her knee, looking down pitifully at the tiny, haggard, sleeping face, which Meg's little hand could almost cover.  What was she to do?  There was no one in Angel Court whom she dare call to her help.  Baby might even die, like the greater number of the babies born in that place, whose brief lives ended quickly, as if existence was too terrible a thing in the midst of such din and squalor.  At the thought that perhaps baby was going to die, two or three tears of extreme anguish rolled down little Meg's cheeks, and fell upon baby's face; but she could not cry aloud, or weep many tears. She felt herself falling into a stupor of grief and despair, when Robin laid his hand upon her arm.",little sit night baby lie lap moan little slumber grow break lift eyelid look face know morning dawn same baby ill ask seem pain carry door call come look be reply come harsh sound child scream angry woman quarrell oath threat shriek answer feeble cry receive sit mother low chair fire make baby comfortable lap stand knee look tiny haggard sleep face little hand cover do be dare call help baby die great number baby bear place brief life end existence terrible thing midst such din squalor thought baby go die tear extreme anguish roll little cheek fall baby face cry weep many tear feel fall stupor grief despair lay hand arm 
5,'Why don't you ask God to waken baby?' he asked.,ask wake baby ask 
6,"'I don't know whether it 'ud be a good thing,' she answered.  'Mother said she'd ask Him over and over again to let her take baby along with her, and that 'ud be better than staying here.  I wish we could all go to heaven; only I don't know whatever father 'ud do if he come home and found us all dead.'",know good thing answer mother say ask let take baby good stay wish go heaven know father do come find dead 
7,"'Maybe God'll take me and baby,' said Robbie thoughtfully, 'and leave you to watch for father.'",take baby say leave watch father 
8,"'I only wish baby had called me Meg once afore she went,' cried little Meg.",wish baby call go cry little 
9,"The baby stirred a little upon her knees, and stretched out its feeble limbs, opening its blue eyes wide and looking up into her face with its sweet smile of welcome.  Then the eyelids closed again slowly, and the small features put on a look of heavenly calm and rest.  Meg and Robin gazed at the change wonderingly without speaking; but when after a few minutes Meg laid her hand gently upon the smooth little forehead, the same chill struck to her heart as when she had touched her mother's dead face.",baby stirr little knee stretch feeble limb open blue eye look face sweet smile welcome eyelid close small feature put look heavenly calm rest gaze change speak few minute lay hand smooth little forehead same chill strike heart touch mother dead face 
10,"It did not seem possible to little Meg that baby could really be dead. She chafed its puny limbs, as she had seen her mother do, and walked up and down the room singing to it, now loudly, now softly; but no change came upon it, no warmth returned to its death-cold frame, no life to its calm face.  She laid it down at length upon the bed, and crossed its thin wee arms upon its breast, and then stretching herself beside it, with her face hidden from the light, little Meg gave herself up to a passion of sorrow.",seem possible little baby dead chafe puny limb see mother do walk room sing change come warmth return death cold frame life calm face lay length bed cross thin wee arm breast stretch face hide light little give passion sorrow 
11,"'If I'd only asked God, for Christ's sake,' she cried to herself, 'maybe He'd have let baby wake, though I don't know whether it's a good thing.  But now she's gone to mother, and father'll come home, and he'll find nobody but me and Robbie, and the money safe.  Oh!  I wish I'd asked God.'",ask sake cry let baby wake know good thing go mother father come find money safe wish ask 
12,"'Meg,' said Robin, after she had worn herself out with sobs and tears, and was lying silently beside baby, 'I'm very poorly.  I think I'll go to live with the angels, where mother and baby are gone.'",say wear sob tear lie baby think go live angel mother baby gone 
13,"Meg started up, and gazed anxiously at Robin.  His bright eyes were dimmed, and his face was flushed and heavy; he was stretched on the floor near the fire, in a listless attitude, and did not care to move, when she knelt down beside him, and put her arm under his head.  It ached, he said; and it felt burning hot to her touch.  Meg's heart stood still for a moment, and then she dropped her tear-stained sorrowful face upon her hands.",start gaze bright eye dimm face flush heavy stretch floor fire listless attitude care move knolt put arm head ach say feel burn hot touch heart stand moment drop tear stain sorrowful face hand 
14,"'Pray God,' she cried, 'don't take Robbie away as well as baby.  Maybe it wasn't a good thing for baby to stay, now mother's dead, though I've done everythink I could, and there's been nobody to take care of us but You.  But, pray God, do let Robbie stay with me till father comes home; for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.'",pray cry take baby good thing baby stay mother dead do be take care pray let stay father come sake 
15,"Meg rose from her knees, and lifted up Robin as gently as she could, soothing him, and talking fondly to him as she took off his clothes. When that was finished she laid him on the same bed where the baby was sleeping its last long sleep, with its tiny face still wearing an unspeakable calm; for Robin's little mattress had been sold some time ago.  The day was just at an end, that sorrowful day, and a lingering light from the west entered through the attic window, and lit up the white, peaceful features with the flushed and drowsy face of Robin beside it.  Meg felt as if her heart would surely break as she stooped over them, and kissed them both, her lips growing cold as they touched baby's smiling mouth.  Then drawing her old shawl over her head, she locked the attic door securely behind her, and ran as fast as her feet could carry her to Mrs Blossom's house.",rise knee lift soothing talk take clothes finish lay same bed baby sleep last long sleep tiny face wear unspeakable calm little mattress sell time day end sorrowful day linger light west enter attic window light white peaceful feature flush drowsy face feel heart break stoop kiss lip grow cold touch baby smile mouth draw old shawl head lock attic door run foot carry house 
16,"'Robbie's very ill,' gasped Meg, breathlessly, as she burst into the shop, the shutters of which were already put up, though it was still early in the night, 'and I want a doctor for him.  Where shall I find a doctor?'",ill gasp burst shop shutter put night want doctor find doctor 
17,"Mrs Blossom had her bonnet and cloak on, and looked very pale and flurried.  When she answered Meg she kept her hand pressed against her heart.",have bonnet cloak look pale flurry answer keep hand press heart 
18,"'I'm just a-going to one,' she said, 'the best at this end o' London, Dr Christie, and you'd better come along with me.  He knows me well. Meg, I've seen somebody go by to-day as was like Posy, only pale and thin; but when I ran out, she was gone like a shadow.  I'm a-going to tell Dr Christie; he knows all about Posy and me.'",go say good end come know see go day pale thin run gone shadow go tell know 
19,"But Meg scarcely heard what Mrs Blossom said.  All her thoughts and interest centred in Robin, and she felt impatient of the slow progress of her companion.  They seemed to her to be going a long, long way, until they came to better streets and larger houses; and by-and-by they saw a carriage standing before a door, and a gentleman came out and got into it hurriedly.",hear say thought interest centre feel impatient slow progress companion seem go long long way come good street large house see carriage stand door gentleman come get 
20,"'Why, bless me!' exclaimed Mrs Blossom, 'there's Dr Christie.  Stop him, Meg, stop him!'",bless exclaim be stop stop 
21,"Meg needed no urging, but rushed blindly across the street.  There was all at once a strange confusion about her, a trampling of horses' feet, and a rattling of wheels, with a sudden terror and pain in herself; and then she knew no more.  All was as nothing to her--baby and Robin alone in the attic, and Mrs Blossom and Posy--all were gone out of her mind and memory.  She had thrown herself before the horses' heads, and they had trampled her down under their feet.",need urging rush street be strange confusion trampling horse foot rattling wheel sudden terror pain know more baby attic go mind memory throw horse head trample foot 
22,"When little Meg came to herself again it was broad daylight, and she was lying in a room so bright and cheerful that she could neither imagine where she was nor how she came there.  There was a good fire crackling noisily in the low grate, with a brass guard before it, and over the chimney-piece was a pretty picture of angels flying upwards with a child in their arms.  All round the walls there hung other pictures of birds and flowers, coloured gaily, and glittering in gilded frames.  Another little bed like the one she lay in stood in the opposite corner, but there was nobody in it, and the place was very quiet.  She lay quite still, with a dreamy thought that she was somehow in heaven, until she heard a pleasant voice speaking in the next room, the door of which was open, so that the words came readily to her ears.",little come broad daylight lie room bright cheerful imagine come be good fire crackle low grate brass guard chimney piece pretty picture angel fly child arm wall hang other picture bird flower coloured glitter gilded frame little bed one lay stand opposite corner be place quiet lay dreamy thought heaven hear pleasant voice speak next room door open word come ear 
23,"'I only wish we knew where the poor little thing comes from,' said the voice.",wish know poor little thing come say voice 
24,"'I'm vexed I don't,' answered Mrs Blossom.  'I've asked her more than once, and she's always said it's down a street off Rosemary Lane, and along another street, and up a court.  But there's a girl called Kitty living in the back attic, as takes care of the children when Meg's away.  She's sure to be taking care o' them now.'",vex answer ask more say street street court be girl call live back attic take care child sure take care 
25,"In an instant memory came back to little Meg.  She recollected bending over Robin and the baby to kiss them before she came away, and locking the door safely upon them.  Oh! what had become of Robbie in the night? She raised herself up in bed, and uttered a very bitter cry, which brought to her quickly Mrs Blossom and a strange lady.",instant memory come little recollect bending baby kiss come lock door become night raise bed utter bitter cry bring strange lady 
26,"'I want Robbie,' she cried.  'I must get up and go to him directly. It's my Robbie that's ill, and baby's dead.  I'm not ill, but Robbie's ill, if he isn't dead, like baby, afore now.  Please to let me get up.'",want cry get go ill baby dead ill ill dead baby let get 
27,"'Tell me all about it,' said Mrs Blossom, sitting down on the bed and taking Meg into her arms.  'We're in Dr Christie's house, and he'll go and see Robbie in a minute, he says.'",tell say sit bed take arm house go see minute say 
28,"'Baby died yesterday morning,' answered Meg, with tearless eyes, for her trouble was too great for tears; 'and then Robbie was took ill, and I put them both in bed, and kissed them, and locked the door, and came away for a doctor, and there's been nobody to take care of 'em all night, only God.'",baby die yesterday morning answer tearless eye trouble great tear take ill put bed kiss lock door come doctor be take care night 
29,"Meg's eyes burned no longer, but filled with tears as she thought of God, and she laid her head upon Mrs Blossom's shoulder, and wept aloud.",eye burn fill tear think lay head shoulder goot 
30,"'God has taken care of them,' said Mrs Christie, but she could say no more.",take care say say more 
31,"'Where is it you live, deary?' asked Mrs Blossom.",live ask 
32,"'It's at Angel Court,' answered Meg.  'But there mustn't nobody go without me.  Please to let me get up.  I'm not ill.'",answer go let get ill 
33,"'You're very much bruised and hurt, my poor child,' said Mrs Christie.",bruise hurt poor child say 
34,"'I must go,' pleaded Meg urgently, 'I must get up, I promised mother I'd never let anybody go into our room, and they mustn't go without me. They're my children, please.  If your little children were ill, you'd go to 'em wouldn't you?  Let me get up this minute.'",go plead get promise mother let go room go child little child ill go let get minute 
35,"It was impossible to withstand little Meg's earnestness.  Mrs Blossom dressed her tenderly, though Meg could not quite keep back the groan which rose to her quivering lips when her bruised arm was moved.  A cab was called, and then Mrs Blossom and Meg, with Dr Christie, got into it, and drove away quickly to Angel Court.",impossible withstand little earnestness dress keep groan rise quiver lip bruise arm move cab call get drive
