1,CHAPTER I.,
2," The wooded banks of Richmond were in all the soft green of early spring, when they were first seen by Leila. A few months had passed; the trees were now half stripped of their leaves, and the autumn tints were fast fading into sombre gray as she a second time caught sight of its wooded heights; but how different were now her feelings, how much more beautiful did the whole scene appear to her with Selina by her side! Selina was spring, summer, sunshine, and all to Leila, and she had not a sigh to give to the falling leaves or the moaning wind.",wooded bank soft green early spring see few month pass tree half stripp leave autumn tint fast fade sombre gray second time catch sight wooded height different feeling beautiful whole scene appear side spring summer sunshine have sigh give falling leave moan wind 
3,"As the carriage drew up before the same low, picturesque-looking house, which she had before visited, Matilda and Alfred (who with their papa and mamma had preceded them but a few minutes) stood holding the house-door open, ready to give them welcome. Little Alfred bustled out to assist in letting down the steps, and Matilda, in her eagerness to help them to alight, had well nigh brought them to the ground.",carriage draw same low picturesque look house visit papa mamma precede few minute stand hold house door open ready give welcome little bustle assist let step eagerness help alight bring ground 
4,"“Softly, softly,” Mr. Howard exclaimed, as he endeavoured to catch hold of Leila’s frock; but Matilda had succeeded in extricating both the little girls from the carriage.",exclaim endeavour catch hold frock succeed extricate little girl carriage 
5,"“Oh, what a day of joy!” she cried; “Cousin Leila still to be with us for a whole month, and Selina as able to talk to her now as I am; Selina, do you remember when you went away?”",day joy cry cousin whole month able talk remember go 
6,"Selina did remember: she coloured, her eyes filled with tears, and throwing her arms first round her sister’s neck, and then round Leila’s, she darted from their side.",remember coloured eye fill tear throw arm sister neck dart side 
7,“Why does she do that? where has she gone?” Leila anxiously inquired.,do go inquire 
8,"“I think I know,” Matilda answered; and pointing to a door on the opposite side of the passage, she flew back to the carriage to assist in getting out the parcels.",think know answer point door opposite side passage fly carriage assist get parcel 
9,"Leila crossed the passage, and softly opened the door; Selina was on her knees by the side of her little bed; she timidly advanced, and lifting the white muslin curtain which partly concealed Selina’s slight figure, she knelt by her side. As the two little girls rose from their knees, their eyes met eyes so full of gratitude to heaven, as almost made Selina’s half-whispered explanation, “Leila, I could not wait till night, unnecessary;” “and now,” she continued, “I must go to dear mamma.”",cross passage open door knee side little bed advance lift white muslin curtain conceal slight figure knolt side little girl rise knee eye meet eye full gratitude heaven make half whisper explanation wait night unnecessary continue go dear mamma 
10,"When Selina returned soon after, she found Leila and Matilda, assisted by Amy, arranging the smaller parcels, and carrying them to the different rooms. Matilda looked eagerly in Selina’s eyes.",return find assist arrange small parcel carry different room look eye 
11,"“I see what you have been doing,” she said, reproachfully: “but I think it is I that should cry: when we were here before, I had to speak both for you and myself. Oh, it was so nice; no, no, Selina, I don’t mean that, I don’t indeed; I am so glad you can speak, oh, so very glad; I said it only to make you laugh, and now I am near crying myself, but I won’t; this is not a day to weep, the very happiest day of all our lives. Come, let us go and visit the school-room; not to say lessons, you know, but just to enjoy ourselves.”",see do say think cry have speak nice mean glad speak glad say make laugh cry day weep happy day life come let go visit school room say lesson know enjoy 
12,"“Yes, that will be an excellent plan,” Leila answered; “and perhaps in the bread-basket we shall still find the head of the doll, which would have been so pretty a doll for my Sally, if it had not been so hardly dealt with.”",excellent plan answer bread basket find head doll doll deal 
13,"Matilda laughed; “How funny you are,” she said, turning to Leila, and passing her arm round her waist; “you have put away my sorrow in a minute.”",laugh funny say turn pass arm waist put sorrow minute

15,"“How very nice it looks!” Leila exclaimed; “how bright, how cheerful-looking; so different from what it was before.”",nice look exclaim bright cheerful look different 
16,"“And were you very melancholy when you were here before, and did not find us?” Matilda inquired.",melancholy find inquire 
17,"“Oh, so melancholy when I saw the flowerpots,” Leila answered; “and I cried so when I saw the paper with ‘Custom commonly makes things easy.’ Yes, ‘Custom commonly’ was the worst of all.”",melancholy see flowerpot answer cry see paper custom make thing easy custom bad 
18,"“But that is all over now,” Matilda observed; “so we need not speak about it, for now we are all three as happy as can be; don’t you think so, Selina?”",observe speak happy think 
19,"“Indeed I do, Matilda; but it is such a deep joy I cannot find words to utter it; it does not make me merry, but do not think it is because I am sad. If you are happy and think it a joyful day, what must it be to me? I had given up all hope of ever being able to speak again; I was telling Leila so that very day, and making her promise not to pray for it any more. Then so many changes have come upon me. When I saw Leila on the ground, when I thought her dead,--oh, I must not think of it; and when she opened her eyes again, and said, ‘Who spoke? what has happened?’ and when she knew God had opened my lips, what a moment that was! Leila’s joy, and my joy too, and to be able to tell her how much I loved her. You do not know how I used to struggle before, and what it was for me not to be able to speak.”",deep joy find word utter make merry think sad happy think joyful day give hope able speak tell day make promise pray more many change come see ground think dead think open eye say speak happen know open lip moment joy joy able tell much love know use struggle able speak 
20,"“Indeed I do know very well,” Matilda answered; “for when mamma often says to me, ‘Matilda, I must beg you to be silent, you distract my head,’ I am more anxious to speak than ever; and so vexed, I would rather she had given me a good slap.”",know answer mamma say beg silent distract head anxious speak vexed give good slap 
21,"“A good _slap_!” Leila exclaimed. “Oh, Matilda, if my papa were ever to slap me, I would--” she covered her face with her hands and shuddered.",good _slap_ exclaim papa slap cover face hand shudder 
22,"“What would you do?” Matilda anxiously inquired, as she pulled down Leila’s hands, and tried to get a sight of her face.",do inquire pull hand try get sight face 
23,"“I would die,” Leila answered, in a voice so low that the words were scarcely audible.",die answer voice low word audible 
24,"But Matilda caught them. “Oh dear,” she cried, “how I have shocked you; what a shocked face you have; well, I am always saying something wrong, and I dare say I shall never be better; for these kind of things come out before I know what I am saying. Selina, do you think it was so very wrong, and was Leila right to say she would----? You know what I mean. You always tell me we should take trials patiently.”",catch cry shock shocked face have say wrong say good kind thing come know say think wrong right say know mean tell take trial 
25,"Selina coloured. “I think you were both a little wrong,” she said, timidly. “You were wrong to talk in that way of dear mamma, who is always so patient and gentle with you; and very wrong to say you would never be better, when you know God will give you strength if you pray for it with all your heart; but not if you say wandering prayers, and do not really wish it;” and she looked anxiously at Matilda.",coloured think little wrong say wrong talk way dear mamma patient gentle wrong say good know give strength pray heart say wonder prayer wish look 
26,“And cousin Leila?” Matilda inquired.,cousin inquire 
27,"Selina proceeded. “Yes; Leila I thought was a little wrong to express herself so strongly; you know Uncle Howard always says she must try to command her feelings more,--you are not angry with me, Leila, for saying this?”",proceed think little wrong express know say try command feeling angry say 
28,"“Angry? Oh! no, no. I love you even more when you tell me I have not done right; for I feel that you are so true, and you say it so gently, just as my papa does.”",angry love tell do right feel true say papa 
29,"“Well to be sure!” Matilda said; “to _like_ to be told that one is not good, I can never get up to that; I don’t like at all to be told I am not good; I would rather say it of myself than that others should say it; indeed, it comforts me sometimes to say it all out. Selina, do you know that at this very moment I am not good?”",sure say _like_ tell good get like tell good say other say comfort say know very moment good 
30,"“Yes, I do know,--you were glad when I said Leila had been wrong too.”",know glad say wrong 
31,“And is that all?” Matilda inquired.,inquire 
32,"“No, not quite all; you were disappointed when you found it was so small a fault.”",disappointed find small fault 
33,"“Oh, Selina! it is too bad in you to say that; you are glad when you find people are good, and like yourself, and I cannot help being rather glad also, when I find people a little like myself, though I am not good; but you are getting into a way of seeing me through and through; you must not do that, or you will see a great many things to frighten you; at least, please don’t begin to-day, when we were to have been so merry; but do you know what I think is going to happen; something that won’t make us merry at all,--and yet I shall be so curious to see her.”",bad say glad find person good help glad find person little good get way see do see great many thing frighten least begin day merry know think go happen make merry curious see 
34,"“See _whom_?” both the others exclaimed; “what do you mean, Matilda?”",see other exclaim mean

36,“And why do you think so?” Selina asked.,think ask 
37,"“Because when I went into the drawing-room with one of the parcels, (mamma’s blotting-book, you know,) I heard Uncle Howard say, ‘Yes, I certainly do see the advantage of having a governess; _but_----’ and then I put down the parcel very slowly, that I might hear more; but mamma said, ‘Matilda, don’t linger in the room, for we are engaged at present, and wish to be alone.’ So, you know, I was obliged to be off very quick; do you think you will like it Selina?--to be sure, it won’t be so bad for you, but it will be bad enough for poor me, with all my scrapes; and yet I should like to see what sort of a face she has got, though I am quite sure I shall not like it.”",go draw room parcel mamma blotting book know hear say see advantage have governess put parcel hear more mamma say linger room engage present wish alone know oblige quick think like sure bad bad poor scrape like see sort face get sure like 
38,"“But perhaps the governess is for _me_,” Leila said, in a sorrowful tone; then added, “and I shall never be alone with my papa any more.”",governess say sorrowful tone add alone papa more 
39,"“No, no,” Matilda eagerly exclaimed; “don’t vex yourself, Leila. Don’t put on that sorrowful face; I am sure the governess is for us; for once before I heard mamma say something about it to papa,--it was one day when she said I was unmanageable, and you know you are never unmanageable.”",exclaim vex put sorrowful face sure governess hear mamma say papa day say unmanageable know unmanageable 
40,"“If you mean that I never am very bad, you are mistaken; you don’t know all the things I do sometimes, and wish to do.”",mean bad mistaken know thing do wish do 
41,"“Well, well,” Matilda answered, “don’t tell me about them, for I don’t want to hear; it is too bad that to-day, when we have no lessons, and are so happy to be home again, we do nothing but speak about faults, and make each other melancholy. See, the sun is out--it is quite fair now--let us go into the garden and have a nice race.”",answer tell want hear bad day have lesson happy do speak fault make other melancholy see sun fair let go garden have nice race
