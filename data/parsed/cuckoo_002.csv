3," It was all very well for a few days. Griselda found plenty to amuse herself with while the novelty lasted, enough to prevent her missing _very_ badly the home she had left ""over the sea,"" and the troop of noisy merry brothers who teased and petted her. Of course she _missed_ them, but not ""dreadfully."" She was neither homesick nor ""dull.""",few day find plenty amuse novelty last prevent miss _very_ home leave sea troop noisy merry brother tease pett course _miss homesick dull 
4,"It was not quite such smooth sailing when lessons began. She did not dislike lessons; in fact, she had always thought she was rather fond of them. But the having to do them alone was not lively, and her teachers were very strict. The worst of all was the writing and arithmetic master, a funny little old man who wore knee-breeches and took snuff, and called her aunt ""Madame,"" bowing formally whenever he addressed her. He screwed Griselda up into such an unnatural attitude to write her copies, that she really felt as if she would never come straight and loose again; and the arithmetic part of his instructions was even worse. Oh! what sums in addition he gave her! Griselda had never been partial to sums, and her rather easy-going governess at home had not, to tell the truth, been partial to them either. And Mr.--I can't remember the little old gentleman's name. Suppose we call him Mr. Kneebreeches--Mr. Kneebreeches, when he found this out, conscientiously put her back to the very beginning.",such smooth sailing lesson begin dislike lesson fact think fond have do lively teacher strict bad writing arithmetic master funny little old man wear knee breeche take snuff call aunt bow address screw unnatural attitude write copy feel come arithmetic part instruction bad sum addition give partial sum easy go governess home tell truth partial remember little old gentleman name suppose call find put very beginning 
5,"It was dreadful, really. He came twice a week, and the days he didn't come were as bad as those he did, for he left her a whole _row_ I was going to say, but you couldn't call Mr. Kneebreeches' addition sums ""rows,"" they were far too fat and wide across to be so spoken of!--whole slatefuls of these terrible mountains of figures to climb wearily to the top of. And not to climb _once_ up merely. _The_ terrible thing was Mr. Kneebreeches' favourite method of what he called ""proving."" I can't explain it--it is far beyond my poor powers--but it had something to do with cutting off the top line, after you had added it all up and had actually done the sum, you understand--cutting off the top line and adding the long rows up again without it, and then joining it on again somewhere else.",dreadful come week day come bad leave whole _row_ go say call addition sum row fat wide speak whole slateful terrible mountain figure climb top climb _once_ terrible thing favourite method call prove explain poor power have do cut top line add do sum understand cut top line add long row join else 
6,"""I wouldn't mind so much,"" said poor Griselda, one day, ""if it was any good. But you see, Aunt Grizzel, it isn't. For I'm just as likely to do the _proving_ wrong as the sum itself--more likely, for I'm always so tired when I get to the proving--and so all that's proved is that _something's_ wrong, and I'm sure that isn't any good, except to make me cross.""",mind much say poor day good see likely do _proving_ wrong sum likely tired get prove prove _someth wrong sure good make cross 
7,"""Hush!"" said her aunt gravely. ""That is not the way for a little girl to speak. Improve these golden hours of youth, Griselda; they will never return.""",say aunt way little girl speak improve golden hour youth return 
8,"""I hope not,"" muttered Griselda, ""if it means doing sums.""",hope mutter mean do sum 
9,Miss Grizzel fortunately was a little deaf; she did not hear this remark. Just then the cuckoo clock struck eleven.,little deaf hear remark cuckoo clock strike 
10,"""Good little cuckoo,"" said Miss Grizzel. ""What an example he sets you. His life is spent in the faithful discharge of duty;"" and so saying she left the room.",good little cuckoo say example set life spend faithful discharge duty say leave room 
11,"The cuckoo was still telling the hour--eleven took a good while. It seemed to Griselda that the bird repeated her aunt's last words. ""Faith--ful, dis--charge, of--your, du--ty,"" he said, ""faith--ful.""",cuckoo tell hour take good while seem bird repeat aunt last word faith charge say faith 
12,"""You horrid little creature!"" exclaimed Griselda in a passion; ""what business have you to mock me?""",horrid little creature exclaim passion business have mock 
13,"She seized a book, the first that came to hand, and flung it at the bird who was just beginning his eleventh cuckoo. He disappeared with a snap, disappeared without flapping his wings, or, as Griselda always fancied he did, giving her a friendly nod, and in an instant all was silent.",seize book first come hand flung bird begin eleventh cuckoo disappear snap disappear flap wing fancy give friendly nod instant silent 
14,"Griselda felt a little frightened. What had she done? She looked up at the clock. It seemed just the same as usual, the cuckoo's doors closely shut, no sign of any disturbance. Could it have been her fancy only that he had sprung back more hastily than he would have done but for her throwing the book at him? She began to hope so, and tried to go on with her lessons. But it was no use. Though she really gave her best attention to the long addition sums, and found that by so doing she managed them much better than before, she could not feel happy or at ease. Every few minutes she glanced up at the clock, as if expecting the cuckoo to come out, though she knew quite well there was no chance of his doing so till twelve o'clock, as it was only the hours, not the half hours and quarters, that he told.",feel little frighten do look clock seem same usual cuckoo door shut sign disturbance fancy spring do throw book begin hope try go lesson use give good attention long addition sum find do manage good feel happy ease few minute glance clock expect cuckoo come know be chance do o'clock hour half hour quarter tell 
15,"""I wish it was twelve o'clock,"" she said to herself anxiously more than once.",wish o'clock say more 
16,"If only the clock had not been so very high up on the wall, she would have been tempted to climb up and open the little doors, and peep in to satisfy herself as to the cuckoo's condition. But there was no possibility of this. The clock was far, very far above her reach, and there was no high piece of furniture standing near, upon which she could have climbed to get to it. There was nothing to be done but to wait for twelve o'clock.",clock high wall tempt climb open little door peep satisfy cuckoo condition be possibility clock reach be high piece furniture stand climb get be do wait o'clock 
17,"And, after all, she did not wait for twelve o'clock, for just about half-past eleven, Miss Grizzel's voice was heard calling to her to put on her hat and cloak quickly, and come out to walk up and down the terrace with her.",wait o'clock half past voice hear call put hat cloak come walk terrace 
18,"""It is fine just now,"" said Miss Grizzel, ""but there is a prospect of rain before long. You must leave your lessons for the present, and finish them in the afternoon.""",fine say be prospect rain leave lesson present finish afternoon 
19,"""I have finished them,"" said Griselda, meekly.",finish say 
20,"""_All_?"" inquired her aunt.",inquire aunt 
21,"""Yes, all,"" replied Griselda.",reply 
22,"""Ah, well, then, this afternoon, if the rain holds off, we shall drive to Merrybrow Hall, and inquire for the health of your dear godmother, Lady Lavander,"" said Miss Grizzel.",afternoon rain hold drive inquire health dear godmother say 
23,"Poor Griselda! There were few things she disliked more than a drive with her aunts. They went in the old yellow chariot, with all the windows up, and of course Griselda had to sit with her back to the horses, which made her very uncomfortable when she had no air, and had to sit still for so long.",poor be few thing dislike more drive aunt go old yellow chariot window course have sit horse make uncomfortable have air have sit 
24,"Merrybrow Hall was a large house, quite as old and much grander, but not nearly so wonderful as the home of Griselda's aunts. It was six miles off, and it took a very long time indeed to drive there in the rumbling old chariot, for the old horses were fat and wheezy, and the old coachman fat and wheezy too. Lady Lavander was, of course, old too--very old indeed, and rather grumpy and very deaf. Miss Grizzel and Miss Tabitha had the greatest respect for her; she always called them ""My dear,"" as if they were quite girls, and they listened to all she said as if her words were of gold. For some mysterious reason she had been invited to be Griselda's godmother; but, as she had never shown her any proof of affection beyond giving her a prayer-book, and hoping, whenever she saw her, that she was ""a good little miss,"" Griselda did not feel any particular cause for gratitude to her.",large house old grander wonderful home aunt mile take long time drive rumble old chariot old horse fat wheezy old coachman fat wheezy course old old grumpy deaf have great respect call dear girl listen say word gold mysterious reason invite godmother show proof affection give prayer book hope see good little miss feel particular cause gratitude 
25,"The drive seemed longer and duller than ever this afternoon, but Griselda bore it meekly; and when Lady Lavander, as usual, expressed her hopes about her, the little girl looked down modestly, feeling her cheeks grow scarlet. ""I am not a good little girl at all,"" she felt inclined to call out. ""I'm very bad and cruel. I believe I've killed the dear little cuckoo.""",drive seem long duller afternoon bear usual express hope little girl look feel cheek grow scarlet good little girl feel inclined call bad cruel believe kill dear little cuckoo 
26,"What _would_ the three old ladies have thought if she had called it out? As it was, Lady Lavander patted her approvingly, said she loved to see young people modest and humble-minded, and gave her a slice of very highly-spiced, rather musty gingerbread, which Griselda couldn't bear.",_would_ old lady think call patt say love see young person modest humble minded give slice spiced musty gingerbread bear 
27,"All the way home Griselda felt in a fever of impatience to rush up to the ante-room and see if the cuckoo was all right again. It was late and dark when the chariot at last stopped at the door of the old house. Miss Grizzel got out slowly, and still more slowly Miss Tabitha followed her. Griselda was obliged to restrain herself and move demurely.",way home feel fever impatience rush ante room see cuckoo late dark chariot last stop door old house get follow oblige restrain move 
28,"""It is past your supper-time, my dear,"" said Miss Grizzel. ""Go up at once to your room, and Dorcas shall bring some supper to you. Late hours are bad for young people.""",supper time dear say go room bring supper late hour bad young person 
29,"Griselda obediently wished her aunts good-night, and went quietly upstairs. But once out of sight, at the first landing, she changed her pace. She turned to the left instead of to the right, which led to her own room, and flew rather than ran along the dimly-lighted passage, at the end of which a door led into the great saloon. She opened the door. All was quite dark. It was impossible to fly or run across the great saloon! Even in daylight this would have been a difficult matter. Griselda _felt_ her way as best she could, past the Chinese cabinet and the pot-pourri jar, till she got to the ante-room door. It was open, and now, knowing her way better, she hurried in. But what was the use? All was silent, save the tick-tick of the cuckoo clock in the corner. Oh, if _only_ the cuckoo would come out and call the hour as usual, what a weight would be lifted off Griselda's heart!",wish aunt good night go sight first landing change pace turn left right lead own room fly run light passage end door lead great saloon open door dark impossible fly run great saloon daylight difficult matter way good chinese cabinet pot pourri jar get ante room door open know way hurry use silent save tick tick cuckoo clock corner cuckoo come call hour usual weight lift heart 
30,"She had no idea what o'clock it was. It might be close to the hour, or it might be just past it. She stood listening for a few minutes, then hearing Miss Grizzel's voice in the distance, she felt that she dared not stay any longer, and turned to feel her way out of the room again. Just as she got to the door it seemed to her that something softly brushed her cheek, and a very, very faint ""cuckoo"" sounded as it were in the air close to her.",have idea o'clock close hour stand listen few minute hear voice distance feel stay turn feel way room get door seem brush cheek faint cuckoo sound air 
31,"Startled, but not frightened, Griselda stood perfectly still.",startle frighten stand 
32,"""Cuckoo,"" she said, softly. But there was no answer.",say be answer 
33,Again the tones of Miss Grizzel's voice coming upstairs reached her ear.,tone voice come reach ear 
34,"""I _must_ go,"" said Griselda; and finding her way across the saloon without, by great good luck, tumbling against any of the many breakable treasures with which it was filled, she flew down the long passage again, reaching her own room just before Dorcas appeared with her supper.",go say find way saloon great good luck tumble many breakable treasure fill fly long passage reach own room appear supper 
35,"Griselda slept badly that night. She was constantly dreaming of the cuckoo, fancying she heard his voice, and then waking with a start to find it was _only_ fancy. She looked pale and heavy-eyed when she came down to breakfast the next morning; and her Aunt Tabitha, who was alone in the room when she entered, began immediately asking her what was the matter.",sleep night dreaming cuckoo fancy hear voice wake start find _only_ fancy look pale heavy eyed come breakfast next morning alone room enter begin ask matter 
36,"""I am sure you are going to be ill, child,"" she said, nervously. ""Sister Grizzel must give you some medicine. I wonder what would be the best. Tansy tea is an excellent thing when one has taken cold, or----""",sure go ill child say give medicine wonder good tansy tea excellent thing take cold 
37,"But the rest of Miss Tabitha's sentence was never heard, for at this moment Miss Grizzel came hurriedly into the room--her cap awry, her shawl disarranged, her face very pale. I hardly think any one had ever seen her so discomposed before.",rest sentence hear moment come room cap shawl disarrang face pale think one see discompose 
38,"""Sister Tabitha!"" she exclaimed, ""what can be going to happen? The cuckoo clock has stopped.""",exclaim go happen cuckoo clock stop 
39,"""The cuckoo clock has stopped!"" repeated Miss Tabitha, holding up her hands; ""_im_possible!""",cuckoo clock stop repeat hold hand _im_possible 
40,"""But it has, or rather I should say--dear me, I am so upset I cannot explain myself--the _cuckoo_ has stopped. The clock is going on, but the cuckoo has not told the hours, and Dorcas is of opinion that he left off doing so yesterday. What can be going to happen? What shall we do?""",say dear upset explain _cuckoo_ stop clock go cuckoo tell hour opinion leave do yesterday go happen do 
41,"""What can we do?"" said Miss Tabitha. ""Should we send for the watch-maker?""",do say send watch maker 
42,Miss Grizzel shook her head.,shake head 
43,"""'Twould be worse than useless. Were we to search the world over, we could find no one to put it right. Fifty years and more, Tabitha, fifty years and more, it has never missed an hour! We are getting old, Tabitha, our day is nearly over; perhaps 'tis to remind us of this.""",twould bad useless search world find put year more year more miss hour get old day remind 
44,"Miss Tabitha did not reply. She was weeping silently. The old ladies seemed to have forgotten the presence of their niece, but Griselda could not bear to see their distress. She finished her breakfast as quickly as she could, and left the room.",reply weep old lady seem forget presence niece bear see distress finish breakfast leave room 
45,On her way upstairs she met Dorcas.,way meet 
46,"""Have you heard what has happened, little missie?"" said the old servant.",hear happen little missie say old servant 
47,"""Yes,"" replied Griselda.",reply 
48,"""My ladies are in great trouble,"" continued Dorcas, who seemed inclined to be more communicative than usual, ""and no wonder. For fifty years that clock has never gone wrong.""",lady great trouble continue seem inclined communicative usual wonder year clock go wrong 
49,"""Can't it be put right?"" asked the child.",put right ask child 
50,Dorcas shook her head.,shake head 
51,"""No good would come of interfering,"" she said. ""What must be, must be. The luck of the house hangs on that clock. Its maker spent a good part of his life over it, and his last words were that it would bring good luck to the house that owned it, but that trouble would follow its silence. It's my belief,"" she added solemnly, ""that it's a _fairy_ clock, neither more nor less, for good luck it has brought there's no denying. There are no cows like ours, missie--their milk is a proverb hereabouts; there are no hens like ours for laying all the year round; there are no roses like ours. And there's always a friendly feeling in this house, and always has been. 'Tis not a house for wrangling and jangling, and sharp words. The 'good people' can't stand that. Nothing drives them away like ill-temper or anger.""",good come interfere say luck house hang clock maker spend good part life last word bring good luck house own trouble follow silence belief add clock more less good luck bring be deny be cow missie milk proverb hereabouts be hen lay year be rose be friendly feeling house house wrangling jangling sharp word good person stand drive ill temper anger 
52,Griselda's conscience gave her a sharp prick. Could it be _her_ doing that trouble was coming upon the old house? What a punishment for a moment's fit of ill-temper.,conscience give sharp prick _her_ do trouble come old house punishment moment fit ill temper 
53,"""I wish you wouldn't talk that way, Dorcas,"" she said; ""it makes me so unhappy.""",wish talk way say make unhappy 
54,"""What a feeling heart the child has!"" said the old servant as she went on her way downstairs. ""It's true--she is very like Miss Sybilla.""",feeling heart child have say old servant go way true 
55,"That day was a very weary and sad one for Griselda. She was oppressed by a feeling she did not understand. She knew she had done wrong, but she had sorely repented it, and ""I do think the cuckoo might have come back again,"" she said to herself, ""if he is a fairy; and if he isn't, it can't be true what Dorcas says.""",day weary sad one oppress feeling understand know do wrong repent think cuckoo come say fairy true say 
56,"Her aunts made no allusion to the subject in her presence, and almost seemed to have forgotten that she had known of their distress. They were more grave and silent than usual, but otherwise things went on in their ordinary way. Griselda spent the morning ""at her tasks,"" in the ante-room, but was thankful to get away from the tick-tick of the clock in the corner and out into the garden.",aunt make allusion subject presence seem forget know distress grave silent usual thing go ordinary way spend morning task ante room thankful get tick tick clock corner garden 
57,"But there, alas! it was just as bad. The rooks seemed to know that something was the matter; they set to work making such a chatter immediately Griselda appeared that she felt inclined to run back into the house again.",bad rook seem know matter set work make chatter appear feel inclined run house 
58,"""I am sure they are talking about me,"" she said to herself. ""Perhaps they are fairies too. I am beginning to think I don't like fairies.""",sure talk say fairy begin think like fairy 
59,"She was glad when bed-time came. It was a sort of reproach to her to see her aunts so pale and troubled; and though she tried to persuade herself that she thought them very silly, she could not throw off the uncomfortable feeling.",glad bed time come sort reproach see aunt pale troubled try persuade think silly throw uncomfortable feeling 
60,"She was so tired when she went to bed--tired in the disagreeable way that comes from a listless, uneasy day--that she fell asleep at once and slept heavily. When she woke, which she did suddenly, and with a start, it was still perfectly dark, like the first morning that she had wakened in the old house. It seemed to her that she had not wakened of herself--something had roused her. Yes! there it was again, a very, _very_ soft distant ""cuckoo."" _Was_ it distant? She could not tell. Almost she could have fancied it was close to her.",tired go bed tired disagreeable way come listless uneasy day fall asleep sleep wake do start dark first morning waken old house seem waken rouse _very_ soft distant cuckoo distant tell fancy close

62,"She darted out of bed, felt her way to the door, which was closed, and opening it let in a rush of moonlight from the unshuttered passage window. In another moment her little bare feet were pattering along the passage at full speed, in the direction of the great saloon.",dart bed feel way door close open let rush moonlight unshuttered passage window moment little bare foot patter passage full speed direction great saloon 
63,For Griselda's childhood among the troop of noisy brothers had taught her one lesson--she was afraid of nothing. Or rather perhaps I should say she had never learnt that there was anything to be afraid of! And is there?,childhood troop noisy brother teach lesson afraid say learn be afraid be
