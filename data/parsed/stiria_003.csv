3," The King of the Golden River had hardly made the extraordinary exit related in the last chapter, before Hans and Schwartz came roaring into the house, very savagely drunk. The discovery of the total loss of their last piece of plate had the effect of sobering them just enough to enable them to stand over Gluck, beating him very steadily for a quarter of an hour; at the expiration of which period they dropped into a couple of chairs, and requested to know what he had got to say for himself. Gluck told them his story, of which, of course, they did not believe a word. They beat him again, till their arms were tired, and staggered to bed. In the morning, however, the steadiness with which he adhered to his story obtained him some degree of credence; the immediate consequence of which was, that the two brothers, after wrangling a long time on the knotty question, which of them should try his fortune first, drew their swords and began fighting. The noise of the fray alarmed the neighbours, who, finding they could not pacify the combatants, sent for the constable.",golden make extraordinary exit related last chapter come roar house drunk discovery total loss last piece plate have effect sober enable stand beat quarter hour expiration period drop couple chair request know get say tell story course believe word beat arm tired stagger bed morning steadiness adhere story obtain degree credence immediate consequence brother wrangle long time knotty question try fortune draw sword begin fight noise fray alarm neighbour find pacify combatant send constable

5,"Hans, on hearing this, contrived to escape, and hid himself; but Schwartz was taken before the magistrate, fined for breaking the peace, and, having drunk out his last penny the evening before, was thrown into prison till he should pay.",hear contrive escape hide take magistrate fine break peace drink last penny evening throw prison pay 
6,"When Hans heard this, he was much delighted, and determined to set out immediately for the Golden River. How to get the holy water, was the question. He went to the priest, but the priest could not give any holy water to so abandoned a character. So Hans went to vespers in the evening for the first time in his life, and, under pretence of crossing himself, stole a cupful, and returned home in triumph.",hear delighted determined set golden get holy water question go priest priest give holy water abandon character go vesper evening first time life pretence cross steal cupful return triumph 
7,"Next morning he got up before the sun rose, put the holy water into a strong flask, and two bottles of wine and some meat in a basket, slung them over his back, took his alpine staff in his hand, and set off for the mountains.",next morning get sun rise put holy water strong flask bottle wine meat basket sling back take alpine staff hand set mountain

9,"On his way out of the town he had to pass the prison, and as he looked in at the windows, whom should he see but Schwartz himself peeping out of the bars, and looking very disconsolate.",way town have pass prison look window see peep bar look disconsolate 
10,"""Good morning, brother,"" said Hans; ""have you any message for the King of the Golden River?""",good morning brother say have message golden 
11,"Schwartz gnashed his teeth with rage, and shook the bars with all his strength; but Hans only laughed at him, and advising him to make himself comfortable till he came back again, shouldered his basket, shook the bottle of holy water in Schwartz's face till it frothed again, and marched off in the highest spirits in the world.",gnash tooth rage shake bar strength laugh advise make comfortable come shoulder basket shake bottle holy water face froth march high spirit world 
12,"It was, indeed, a morning that might have made any one happy, even with no Golden River to seek for. Level lines of dewy mist lay stretched along the valley, out of which rose the massy mountains--their lower cliffs in pale grey shadow, hardly distinguishable from the floating vapour, but gradually ascending till they caught the sunlight, which ran in sharp touches of ruddy colour, along the angular crags, and pierced, in long level rays, through their fringes of spear-like pine. Far above, shot up red splintered masses of castellated rock, jagged and shivered into myriads of fantastic forms, with here and there a streak of sunlit snow, traced down their chasms like a line of forked lightning; and, far beyond, and far above all these, fainter than the morning cloud, but purer and changeless, slept, in the blue sky, the utmost peaks of the eternal snow.",morning make one happy golden seek level line dewy mist stretch valley rise massy mountain low cliff pale grey shadow distinguishable float vapour ascend catch sunlight run sharp touch ruddy colour angular crag pierce long level ray fringe spear pine shoot red splinter mass castellate rock jagge shiver myriad fantastic form streak sunlit snow trace chasm line fork lightning fainter morning cloud purer changeless sleep blue sky utmost peak eternal snow 
13,"The Golden River, which sprang from one of the lower and snowless elevations, was now nearly in shadow; all but the uppermost jets of spray, which rose like slow smoke above the undulating line of the cataract, and floated away in feeble wreaths upon the morning wind.",golden spring low snowless elevation shadow uppermost jet spray rise slow smoke undulating line cataract float feeble wreath morning wind 
14,"On this object, and on this alone, Hans' eyes and thoughts were fixed; forgetting the distance he had to traverse, he set off at an imprudent rate of walking, which greatly exhausted him before he had scaled the first range of the green and low hills. He was, moreover, surprised, on surmounting them, to find that a large glacier, of whose existence, notwithstanding his previous knowledge of the mountains, he had been absolutely ignorant, lay between him and the source of the Golden River. He entered on it with the boldness of a practised mountaineer; yet he thought he had never traversed so strange or so dangerous a glacier in his life. The ice was excessively slippery, and out of all its chasms came wild sounds of gushing water; not monotonous or low, but changeful and loud, rising occasionally into drifting passages of wild melody, then breaking off into short melancholy tones, or sudden shrieks, resembling those of human voices in distress or pain. The ice was broken into thousands of confused shapes, but none, Hans thought, like the ordinary forms of splintered ice. There seemed a curious _expression_ about all their outlines--a perpetual resemblance to living features, distorted and scornful. Myriads of deceitful shadows, and lurid lights, played and floated about and through the pale blue pinnacles, dazzling and confusing the sight of the traveller; while his ears grew dull and his head giddy with the constant gush and roar of the concealed waters. These painful circumstances increased upon him as he advanced; the ice crashed and yawned into fresh chasms at his feet, tottering spires nodded around him, and fell thundering across his path; and though he had repeatedly faced these dangers on the most terrific glaciers, and in the wildest weather, it was with a new and oppressive feeling of panic terror that he leaped the last chasm, and flung himself, exhausted and shuddering, on the firm turf of the mountain.",object eye thought fix forget distance have traverse set imprudent rate walking exhaust scal first range green low hill surprise surmount find large glacier existence notwithstand previous knowledge mountain ignorant lay source golden enter boldness practise mountaineer think travers strange dangerous glacier life ice slippery chasm come wild sound gush water monotonous low changeful loud rise drift passage wild melody break short melancholy tone sudden shriek resemble human voice distress pain ice break thousand confuse shape think ordinary form splinter ice seem curious _expression_ outline perpetual resemblance living feature distort scornful myriad deceitful shadow lurid light play float pale blue pinnacle dazzle confusing sight traveller ear grow dull head giddy constant gush roar conceal water painful circumstance increase advance ice crash yawn fresh chasm foot totter spire nod fall thunder path face danger terrific glacier wild weather new oppressive feeling panic terror leap last chasm flung exhaust shudder firm turf mountain 
15,"He had been compelled to abandon his basket of food, which became a perilous incumbrance on the glacier, and had now no means of refreshing himself but by breaking off and eating some of the pieces of ice. This, however, relieved his thirst; an hour's repose recruited his hardy frame, and with the indomitable spirit of avarice, he resumed his laborious journey.",compel abandon basket food become perilous incumbrance glacier have means refresh break eat piece ice relieve thirst hour repose recruit hardy frame indomitable spirit avarice resume laborious journey

17,"His way now lay straight up a ridge of bare red rocks, without a blade of grass to ease the foot, or a projecting angle to afford an inch of shade from the south sun. It was past noon, and the rays beat intensely upon the steep path, while the whole atmosphere was motionless, and penetrated with heat. Intense thirst was soon added to the bodily fatigue with which Hans was now afflicted; glance after glance he cast on the flask of water which hung at his belt. ""Three drops are enough,"" at last thought he; ""I may, at least, cool my lips with it.""",way lay ridge bare red rock blade grass ease foot project angle afford inch shade south sun noon ray beat steep path whole atmosphere motionless penetrate heat intense thirst add bodily fatigue afflict glance glance cast flask water hang belt drop enough last think least cool lip 
18,"He opened the flask, and was raising it to his lips, when his eye fell on an object lying on the rock beside him; he thought it moved. It was a small dog, apparently in the last agony of death from thirst. Its tongue was out, its jaws dry, its limbs extended lifelessly, and a swarm of black ants were crawling about its lips and throat. Its eye moved to the bottle which Hans held in his hand. He raised it, drank, spurned the animal with his foot, and passed on. And he did not know how it was, but he thought that a strange shadow had suddenly come across the blue sky.",open flask raise lip eye fall object lie rock think move small dog last agony death thirst tongue jaw dry limb extend swarm black ant crawl lip throat eye move bottle hold hand raise drink spurn animal foot pass know think strange shadow come blue sky 
19,"The path became steeper and more rugged every moment; and the high hill air, instead of refreshing him, seemed to throw his blood into a fever. The noise of the hill cataracts sounded like mockery in his ears; they were all distant, and his thirst increased every moment. Another hour passed, and he again looked down to the flask at his side; it was half empty; but there was much more than three drops in it. He stopped to open it, and again, as he did so, something moved in the path above him. It was a fair child, stretched nearly lifeless on the rock, its breast heaving with thirst, its eyes closed, and its lips parched and burning. Hans eyed it deliberately, drank, and passed on. And a dark grey cloud came over the sun, and long, snake-like shadows crept up along the mountain sides. Hans struggled on. The sun was sinking, but its descent seemed to bring no coolness; the leaden weight of the dead air pressed upon his brow and heart, but the goal was near. He saw the cataract of the Golden River springing from the hill-side, scarcely five hundred feet above him. He paused for a moment to breathe, and sprang on to complete his task.",path become steeper rugged moment high hill air refresh seem throw blood fever noise hill cataract sound mockery ear distant thirst increase moment hour pass look flask side empty be much more drop stop open do move path fair child stretch lifeless rock breast heave thirst eye close lip parched burn eye drink pass dark grey cloud come sun long snake like shadow creep mountain side struggle sun sink descent seem bring coolness leaden weight dead air press brow heart goal see cataract golden spring hill side foot pause moment breathe spring complete task 
20,"At this instant a faint cry fell on his ear. He turned, and saw a grey-haired old man extended on the rocks. His eyes were sunk, his features deadly pale, and gathered into an expression of despair. ""Water!"" he stretched his arms to Hans, and cried feebly, ""Water! I am dying.""",instant faint cry fall ear turn see grey haired old man extend rock eye sink feature pale gather expression despair water stretch arm cry water die 
21,"""I have none,"" replied Hans; ""thou hast had thy share of life."" He strode over the prostrate body, and darted on. And a flash of blue lightning rose out of the East, shaped like a sword; it shook thrice over the whole heaven, and left it dark with one heavy, impenetrable shade. The sun was setting; it plunged towards the horizon like a red-hot ball.",have reply have share life strode prostrate body dart flash blue lightning rise shape sword shake thrice whole heaven leave dark heavy impenetrable shade sun set plunge horizon red hot ball 
22,"The roar of the Golden River rose on Hans' ear. He stood at the brink of the chasm through which it ran. Its waves were filled with the red glory of the sunset: they shook their crests like tongues of fire, and flashes of bloody light gleamed along their foam. Their sound came mightier and mightier on his senses; his brain grew giddy with the prolonged thunder. Shuddering he drew the flask from his girdle, and hurled it into the centre of the torrent. As he did so, an icy chill shot through his limbs: he staggered, shrieked, and fell. The waters closed over his cry. And the moaning of the river rose wildly into the night, as it gushed over",roar golden rise ear stand brink chasm run wave fill red glory sunset shake crest tongue fire flash bloody light gleam foam sound come mighty mighty sense brain grow giddy prolonged thunder shudder draw flask girdle hurl centre torrent do icy chill shot limb stagger shriek fall water close cry moan river rise night gush
