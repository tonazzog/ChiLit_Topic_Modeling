2," “What fun!” said Mother, in the dark, feeling for the matches on the table. “How frightened the poor mice were--I don’t believe they were rats at all.”",fun say dark feel match table frighten poor mouse believe rat 
3,"She struck a match and relighted the candle and everyone looked at each other by its winky, blinky light.",strike match relight candle look other winky blinky light 
4,"“Well,” she said, “you’ve often wanted something to happen and now it has. This is quite an adventure, isn’t it? I told Mrs. Viney to get us some bread and butter, and meat and things, and to have supper ready. I suppose she’s laid it in the dining-room. So let’s go and see.”",say want happen adventure tell get bread butter meat thing have supper ready suppose lay dining room let go see 
5,"The dining-room opened out of the kitchen. It looked much darker than the kitchen when they went in with the one candle. Because the kitchen was whitewashed, but the dining-room was dark wood from floor to ceiling, and across the ceiling there were heavy black beams. There was a muddled maze of dusty furniture--the breakfast-room furniture from the old home where they had lived all their lives. It seemed a very long time ago, and a very long way off.",dining room open kitchen look dark kitchen go candle kitchen whitewash dining room dark wood floor ceiling ceiling be heavy black beam be muddled maze dusty furniture breakfast room furniture old home live life seem long time long way 
6,"There was the table certainly, and there were chairs, but there was no supper.",be table be chair be supper 
7,"“Let’s look in the other rooms,” said Mother; and they looked. And in each room was the same kind of blundering half-arrangement of furniture, and fire-irons and crockery, and all sorts of odd things on the floor, but there was nothing to eat; even in the pantry there were only a rusty cake-tin and a broken plate with whitening mixed in it.",let look other room say mother look room same kind blunder half arrangement furniture fire iron crockery sort odd thing floor be eat pantry be rusty cake tin break plate whitening mix 
8,“What a horrid old woman!” said Mother; “she’s just walked off with the money and not got us anything to eat at all.”,horrid old woman say mother walk money get eat

11,"The cellar door opened out of the kitchen. There were five wooden steps leading down. It wasn’t a proper cellar at all, the children thought, because its ceiling went up as high as the kitchen’s. A bacon-rack hung under its ceiling. There was wood in it, and coal. Also the big cases.",cellar door open kitchen be wooden step lead proper cellar child think ceiling go high kitchen bacon rack hang ceiling be wood coal big case

15,And with these she tried to get the case open.,try get case open

21,“Hooray!” said Mother; “here are some candles--the very first thing! You girls go and light them. You’ll find some saucers and things.

24,"So the girls lighted candles. The head of the first match flew off and stuck to Phyllis’s finger; but, as Roberta said, it was only a little burn, and she might have had to be a Roman martyr and be burned whole if she had happened to live in the days when those things were fashionable.",girl light candle head first match fly stick finger say little burn have roman martyr burn whole happen live day thing fashionable

28,"The girls hastily ‘tidied’ the room, which meant putting the chairs against the wall, and piling all the odds and ends into a corner and partly hiding them with the big leather arm-chair that Father used to sit in after dinner.",girl tidy room mean put chair wall pile odd end corner hide big leather arm chair use sit dinner 
29,"“Bravo!” cried Mother, coming in with a tray full of things. “This is something like! I’ll just get a tablecloth and then--”",cry mother come tray full thing get tablecloth

31,"Everyone was very, very tired, but everyone cheered up at the sight of the funny and delightful supper. There were biscuits, the Marie and the plain kind, sardines, preserved ginger, cooking raisins, and candied peel and marmalade.",tired cheer sight funny delightful supper be biscuit plain kind sardine preserve ginger cooking raisin cand peel marmalade

37,"It was Aunt Emma, too, who had aired all the sheets ready; and the men who had moved the furniture had put the bedsteads together, so the beds were soon made.",air sheet ready man move furniture put bedstead bed make 
38,"“Good night, chickies,” said Mother. “I’m sure there aren’t any rats. But I’ll leave my door open, and then if a mouse comes, you need only scream, and I’ll come and tell it exactly what I think of it.”",good night chicky say mother sure be rat leave door open mouse come need scream come tell think 
39,"Then she went to her own room. Roberta woke to hear the little travelling clock chime two. It sounded like a church clock ever so far away, she always thought. And she heard, too, Mother still moving about in her room.",go own room wake hear little travelling clock chime sound church clock think hear mother move room

42,"“Wake up! wake up!” said Roberta. “We’re in the new house--don’t you remember? No servants or anything. Let’s get up and begin to be useful. We’ll just creep down mouse-quietly, and have everything beautiful before Mother gets up. I’ve woke Peter. He’ll be dressed as soon as we are.”",wake wake say new house remember servant let get begin useful creep mouse have beautiful mother get wake dress 
43,"So they dressed quietly and quickly. Of course, there was no water in their room, so when they got down they washed as much as they thought was necessary under the spout of the pump in the yard. One pumped and the other washed. It was splashy but interesting.",dress course be water room get wash think necessary spout pump yard pump other wash splashy interesting 
44,"“It’s much more fun than basin washing,” said Roberta. “How sparkly the weeds are between the stones, and the moss on the roof--oh, and the flowers!”",fun basin washing say weed stone moss roof flower 
45,"The roof of the back kitchen sloped down quite low. It was made of thatch and it had moss on it, and house-leeks and stonecrop and wallflowers, and even a clump of purple flag-flowers, at the far corner.",roof back kitchen slope low make thatch have moss house leek stonecrop wallflower clump purple flag flower far corner

47,"“We mustn’t think of the garden yet,” said Roberta, with earnest energy. “Let’s go in and begin to work.”",think garden say earnest energy let go begin work 
48,"They lighted the fire and put the kettle on, and they arranged the crockery for breakfast; they could not find all the right things, but a glass ash-tray made an excellent salt-cellar, and a newish baking-tin seemed as if it would do to put bread on, if they had any.",light fire put kettle arrange crockery breakfast find right thing glass ash tray make excellent salt cellar newish baking tin seem do put bread have 
49,"When there seemed to be nothing more that they could do, they went out again into the fresh bright morning.",seem be more do go fresh bright morning 
50,"“We’ll go into the garden now,” said Peter. But somehow they couldn’t find the garden. They went round the house and round the house. The yard occupied the back, and across it were stables and outbuildings. On the other three sides the house stood simply in a field, without a yard of garden to divide it from the short smooth turf. And yet they had certainly seen the garden wall the night before.",go garden say find garden go house house yard occupy back stable outbuilding other side house stand field yard garden divide short smooth turf see garden wall night 
51,"It was a hilly country. Down below they could see the line of the railway, and the black yawning mouth of a tunnel. The station was out of sight. There was a great bridge with tall arches running across one end of the valley.",hilly country see line railway black yawning mouth tunnel station sight be great bridge tall arche run end valley 
52,"“Never mind the garden,” said Peter; “let’s go down and look at the railway. There might be trains passing.”",mind garden say let go look railway be train pass 
53,"“We can see them from here,” said Roberta, slowly; “let’s sit down a bit.”",see say let sit bit 
54,"So they all sat down on a great flat grey stone that had pushed itself up out of the grass; it was one of many that lay about on the hillside, and when Mother came out to look for them at eight o’clock, she found them deeply asleep in a contented, sun-warmed bunch.",sit great flat grey stone push grass many lay hillside come look o'clock find asleep content sun warm bunch 
55,"They had made an excellent fire, and had set the kettle on it at about half-past five. So that by eight the fire had been out for some time, the water had all boiled away, and the bottom was burned out of the kettle. Also they had not thought of washing the crockery before they set the table.",make excellent fire set kettle half past fire time water boil bottom burn kettle think wash crockery set table 
56,"“But it doesn’t matter--the cups and saucers, I mean,” said Mother. “Because I’ve found another room--I’d quite forgotten there was one. And it’s magic! And I’ve boiled the water for tea in a saucepan.”",matter cup saucer mean say mother find room forget be magic boil water tea saucepan 
57,"The forgotten room opened out of the kitchen. In the agitation and half darkness the night before its door had been mistaken for a cupboard’s. It was a little square room, and on its table, all nicely set out, was a joint of cold roast beef, with bread, butter, cheese, and a pie.",forget room open kitchen agitation half darkness night door mistaken cupboard little square room table set joint cold roast beef bread butter cheese pie 
58,“Pie for breakfast!” cried Peter; “how perfectly ripping!”,pie breakfast cry rip 
59,"“It isn’t pigeon-pie,” said Mother; “it’s only apple. Well, this is the supper we ought to have had last night. And there was a note from Mrs. Viney. Her son-in-law has broken his arm, and she had to get home early. She’s coming this morning at ten.”",pigeon pie say mother apple supper have last night be note son law break arm have get come morning 
60,"That was a wonderful breakfast. It is unusual to begin the day with cold apple pie, but the children all said they would rather have it than meat.",wonderful breakfast unusual begin day cold apple pie child say have meat 
61,"“You see it’s more like dinner than breakfast to us,” said Peter, passing his plate for more, “because we were up so early.”",see dinner breakfast say pass plate more 
62,The day passed in helping Mother to unpack and arrange things. Six small legs quite ached with running about while their owners carried clothes and crockery and all sorts of things to their proper places. It was not till quite late in the afternoon that Mother said:--,day pass help mother unpack arrange thing small leg ach run owner carry clothes crockery sort thing proper place afternoon say 
63,"“There! That’ll do for to-day. I’ll lie down for an hour, so as to be as fresh as a lark by supper-time.”",do day lie hour fresh lark supper time 
64,"Then they all looked at each other. Each of the three expressive countenances expressed the same thought. That thought was double, and consisted, like the bits of information in the Child’s Guide to Knowledge, of a question and an answer.",look other expressive countenance express same thought thought double consist bit information guide question answer 
65,Q. Where shall we go?,go 
66,A. To the railway.,railway 
67,"So to the railway they went, and as soon as they started for the railway they saw where the garden had hidden itself. It was right behind the stables, and it had a high wall all round.",railway go start railway see garden hide stable have high wall

70,The way ended in a steep run and a wooden fence--and there was the railway with the shining metals and the telegraph wires and posts and signals.,way end steep run wooden fence be railway shine metal telegraph wire post signal 
71,"They all climbed on to the top of the fence, and then suddenly there was a rumbling sound that made them look along the line to the right, where the dark mouth of a tunnel opened itself in the face of a rocky cliff; next moment a train had rushed out of the tunnel with a shriek and a snort, and had slid noisily past them. They felt the rush of its passing, and the pebbles on the line jumped and rattled under it as it went by.",climb top fence be rumble sound make look line right dark mouth tunnel open face rocky cliff next moment train rush tunnel shriek snort slide feel rush passing pebble line jump rattle go 
72,"“Oh!” said Roberta, drawing a long breath; “it was like a great dragon tearing by. Did you feel it fan us with its hot wings?”",say draw long breath great dragon tear feel fan hot wing

81,"“Let’s go down to the station and find out,” said Peter.",let go station find say 
82,So they went.,go 
83,"They walked along the edge of the line, and heard the telegraph wires humming over their heads. When you are in the train, it seems such a little way between post and post, and one after another the posts seem to catch up the wires almost more quickly than you can count them. But when you have to walk, the posts seem few and far between.",walk edge line hear telegraph wire hum head train seem little way post post post seem catch wire count have walk post seem few 
84,But the children got to the station at last.,child get station last

87,The very sleepers on which the rails lay were a delightful path to travel by--just far enough apart to serve as the stepping-stones in a game of foaming torrents hastily organised by Bobbie.,very sleeper rail lay delightful path travel serve step stone game foaming torrent organised 
88,"Then to arrive at the station, not through the booking office, but in a freebooting sort of way by the sloping end of the platform. This in itself was joy.",arrive station booking office freeboot sort way slope end platform joy

90,"There were a great many crossing lines at the station; some of them just ran into a yard and stopped short, as though they were tired of business and meant to retire for good. Trucks stood on the rails here, and on one side was a great heap of coal--not a loose heap, such as you see in your coal cellar, but a sort of solid building of coals with large square blocks of coal outside used just as though they were bricks, and built up till the heap looked like the picture of the Cities of the Plain in ‘Bible Stories for Infants.’ There was a line of whitewash near the top of the coaly wall.",be great many crossing line station run yard stop short tired business mean retire good truck stand rail side great heap coal loose heap such see coal cellar sort solid building coal large square block coal use brick build heap look picture be line whitewash top coaly wall 
91,"When presently the Porter lounged out of his room at the twice-repeated tingling thrill of a gong over the station door, Peter said, “How do you do?” in his best manner, and hastened to ask what the white mark was on the coal for.",lounge room repeat tingling thrill gong station door say do good manner hasten ask white mark coal 
92,"“To mark how much coal there be,” said the Porter, “so as we’ll know if anyone nicks it. So don’t you go off with none in your pockets, young gentleman!”",mark much coal say know nick go pocket young gentleman 
93,"This seemed, at the time but a merry jest, and Peter felt at once that the Porter was a friendly sort with no nonsense about him. But later the words came back to Peter with a new meaning.",seem time merry jest feel friendly sort nonsense word come new meaning 
94,"Have you ever gone into a farmhouse kitchen on a baking day, and seen the great crock of dough set by the fire to rise? If you have, and if you were at that time still young enough to be interested in everything you saw, you will remember that you found yourself quite unable to resist the temptation to poke your finger into the soft round of dough that curved inside the pan like a giant mushroom. And you will remember that your finger made a dent in the dough, and that slowly, but quite surely, the dent disappeared, and the dough looked quite the same as it did before you touched it. Unless, of course, your hand was extra dirty, in which case, naturally, there would be a little black mark.",go farmhouse kitchen baking day see great crock dough set fire rise have time young interested see remember find unable resist temptation poke finger soft round dough curved pan giant mushroom remember finger make dent dough dent disappear dough look same touch course hand extra dirty case be little black mark

96,"They soon got used to being without Father, though they did not forget him; and they got used to not going to school, and to seeing very little of Mother, who was now almost all day shut up in her upstairs room writing, writing, writing.

98,"Mother had told them more than once that they were ‘quite poor now,’ but this did not seem to be anything but a way of speaking. Grown-up people, even Mothers, often make remarks that don’t seem to mean anything in particular, just for the sake of saying something, seemingly. There was always enough to eat, and they wore the same kind of nice clothes they had always worn.",mother tell more poor seem way speak grow person make remark seem mean particular sake say be enough eat wear same kind nice clothes wear

106,"Thought, however, could not long keep itself from the suitable furnishing of a bandit’s lair in the attic. Peter was the bandit, of course.
