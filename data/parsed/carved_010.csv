1,CHAPTER X. TAKING REFUGE.,chapter taking refuge 
2," For a minute or two I seemed to feel nothing; then there came over me a sort of shiver, partly of cold, for it _was_ very cold, partly of misery. I roused myself, however. With the remembrance of that other evening had come to me also the knowledge of where I was. Only a few yards down the sloping street on the left-hand side came a wide stretch of pavement, and there, in a kind of angle, stood a double door, open on both sides, leading into a small outer hall, from which again another door, glazed at the top, was the entrance to Cranston's show-rooms.",minute seem feel come sort shiver cold cold misery rouse remembrance other evening come knowledge few yard slope street left hand side come wide stretch pavement kind angle stand double door open side lead small outer hall door glaze top entrance show room 
3,"I remembered it all perfectly. Just beyond the inner entrance stood the two carved lions that Haddie and I admired so much. I wished I could see them again, and--yes--a flash of joy went through me at the thought--I could get Mrs. Selwood's address quite as well from old Mr. Cranston as from the big grocer!",remember inner entrance stand carve lion admire wish see flash joy go thought get address old big grocer 
4,"As soon as the idea struck me I hurried on, seeming to gain fresh strength and energy. It was almost dark, but a gas-lamp was burning dimly above the lintel, and inside, on the glass of the inner door, were the large gilt letters ""Cranston and Co.""",idea strike hurry seem gain fresh strength energy dark gas lamp burn lintel glass inner door large gilt letter 
5,"I ran up the two or three broad shallow steps and pushed open the door, which was a swing one. It was nearly time for closing, but that I did not know. There was no one to be seen inside, not, at least, in the first room, and the door made no noise. But there stood the dear lions--I could not see them very clearly, for the place was not brightly lighted, but I crept up to them, and stroked softly the one nearest me. They seemed like real friends.",run broad shallow step push open door swing one time closing know be see least first room door make noise stand dear lion see place light creep stroke one seem real friend 
6,"I had not courage to go into the other show-room, and all was so perfectly still that I could scarcely think any one was there. I thought I would wait a few minutes in hopes of some one coming out, of whom I could inquire if I could see Mr. Cranston. And I was now beginning to feel so tired--so very tired, and so cold.",have courage go other show room think one think wait few minute hope one come inquire see begin feel tired tired cold 
7,"In here, though I did not see any fire, it felt ever so much warmer than outside. There was no chair or stool, but I found a seat for myself on the stand of the farther-in lion--each of them had a heavy wooden stand. It seemed very comfortable, and I soon found that by moving on a little I could get a nice rest for my head against the lion's body. A strange pleasant sense of protection and comfort came over me.",see fire feel warm be chair stool find seat stand far lion have heavy wooden stand seem comfortable find move little get nice rest head lion body strange pleasant sense protection comfort come 
8,"""How glad I am I came in here,"" I said to myself. ""I don't mind if I have to wait a good while. It is so cosy and warm.""",glad come say mind have wait good while cosy warm 
9,"I no longer made any plans. I knew I wanted to ask for Mrs. Selwood's address, but that was all I thought of. What I should do when I had got it I did not know; where I should go for the night, for it was now quite dark, I did not trouble about in the least. I think I must have been very much in the condition I have heard described, of travellers lost in the snow--the overpowering wish to stay where I was and rest, was all I was conscious of. I did not think of going to sleep. I did not know I was sleepy.",make plan know want ask address think do get know go night dark trouble least think condition hear describe traveller lose snow overpowering wish stay rest conscious think go sleep know sleepy 
10,And for some time I knew nothing.,time know 
11,"The first thing that caught my attention was a very low murmur--so low that it might have been merely a breath of air playing in the keyhole; I seemed to have been hearing it for some time before it took shape, as it were, and grew into a softly-whispering voice, gradually gathering into words.",first thing catch attention low murmur low breath air play keyhole seem hear time take shape grow whisper voice gather word

16,"And then--just as I was on the point of starting up and telling them I _was_ awake--came a sound of stamping and rustling, and a sort of whirr and a breath of cold air, which told me the swing door had been opened. And when I sat straight up and looked about me, lo and behold, there was only one lion to be seen--the stand of his brother was empty!",point start tell come sound stamp rustling sort whirr breath cold air tell swing door open sit look be lion see stand brother empty

19,"""It was I, then,"" I repeated meekly. I did not want to give any offence to my new friend. ""Please--I heard you saying something--something about going a ride. And where has the--the other Mr. Lion gone? I heard about--a boy.""",repeat want give offence new friend hear say go ride other gone hear boy 
20,"""You heard correctly,"" my lion replied, and I knew somehow that he was smiling, or whatever lions do that matches smiling.

Can you climb up on to my back?""",hear lion reply know smile lion do match smile brother go fetch _your_ brother plan time meet sea shore travel start climb back

22,"""Catch hold of my mane,"" said the lion; ""don't mind tugging, it won't hurt,"" and--not to my surprise, for nothing surprised me--I felt my hands full of soft silky hair, as the lion shook down his long wavy mane to help my ascent.",catch hold mane say lion mind tug hurt surprise surprise feel hand full soft silky hair lion shake long wavy mane help ascent 
23,"Nothing was easier. In another moment I was cosily settled on his back, which felt deliciously comfortable, and the mane seemed to tuck itself round me like a fleecy rug.",easy moment settle back feel comfortable mane seem tuck fleecy rug

27,"I opened my eyes and looked about me. It was night--overhead in the deep blue sky innumerable stars were sparkling, and down below at our feet I heard the lap-lap of rippling waves.

35,"I opened my eyes. But now I have come to a part of my story which I have never been able, and never shall be able, to put into fitting words.

The beauty and delight seemed made up of everything lovely mingled together--sights, sounds, scents, feelings. There was the murmur of running streams, the singing of birds, the most delicious scent from the flowers growing in profusion and of every shade of colour.",picture loveliest day perfect summer day know more day summer spring richness colour balmy fragrance prime year join freshness indescribable hopefulness expectation charm spring beauty delight seem make lovely mingle sight sound scent feeling be murmur run stream singing bird delicious scent flower grow profusion shade colour

44,"I seemed to know that something more beautiful than anything we had seen yet was coming. I did not ask Haddie any more questions, even though I had a feeling that he knew more than I did.

And his face was shining with happiness.",seem know beautiful see come ask more question have feeling know more seem home wonderful place able guide face shine happiness 
45,"We ran a good way, and very fast. But I did not feel at all tired or breathless. My feet seemed to have wings, and all the time the garden around us grew lovelier and lovelier. If Haddie had not been holding my hand so fast I should scarcely have been able to resist stopping to gather some of the lovely flowers everywhere in such profusion, or to stand still to listen to the dear little birds singing so exquisitely overhead.",run good way feel tired breathless foot seem have wing time garden grow lovely lovely hold hand able resist stop gather lovely flower such profusion stand listen dear little bird sing

56,"And then there came over me the most agonising feeling of disappointment and misery. All the pent-up wretchedness of the last weeks at school woke up and overwhelmed me like waves of dark water. It is as impossible for me to put this into words as it was for me to describe my exquisite happiness, for no words ever succeed in expressing the intense and extraordinary sensations of some dreams. And of course, as you will have found out by this time, the strange adventures I have been relating were those of a dream, though I still, after all the years that have passed since then, remember them so vividly.",come agonising feeling disappointment misery pent wretchedness last week school wake overwhelm wave dark water impossible put word describe exquisite happiness word succeed express intense extraordinary sensation dream course find time strange adventure relate dream year pass remember

61,"I stared still more, and sat up a little, for, wonderful to relate, I was no longer in the lovely garden, no longer even in the show-room leaning against the lion: I was in bed in a strange room which I had never seen before. And leaning over me was the owner of the frilled cap, holding a glass in her hand.",stare more sit little wonderful relate lovely garden show room lean lion bed strange room see lean owner frilled cap hold glass hand

64,"The room seemed lighter the next time I opened my eyes. It was in fact nearly the middle of the day, and a fine day--as clear as it ever was in Great Mexington.

66,"Then, as my waking senses quite returned, I started. It had been only a dream--oh dear, oh dear! But still, _something_ had happened--I was certainly not in my little bed in the corner of the room I shared with Emma and Harriet Smith at Green Bank. When had my dream begun, or was I still dreaming?",wake sense return start dream dear dear _something_ happen little bed corner room share green dream begin dreaming 
67,"I raised myself a little, very softly, for now I began to remember the good-humoured face in the frilled cap, and I thought to myself that unless its owner were a dream too, perhaps she was still in the room, and I wanted to look about me first on my own account.",raise little begin remember good humoured face frilled cap think owner dream room want look own account 
68,"What there was to see was very pleasant and very real. I felt quite sure I was not dreaming now, wherever I was. It was a large old-fashioned room, with red curtains at the two windows and handsome dark wood furniture. There was a fire burning cheerfully in the grate and the windows looked very clean, even though there was a prospect of chimney-tops to be seen out of the one nearest to me, which told me I was still in a town. And then I began to distinguish sounds outside, though here in this room it was so still. There were lots of wheels passing, some going quickly, some lumbering along with heavy slowness--it was much noisier than at Miss Ledbury's or at my own old home. Here I seemed to be in the very heart of a town. I began to recall the events of the day before more clearly. Yes, up to the time I remembered leaning against the carved lion in Mr. Cranston's show-room all had been real, I felt certain. I recollected with a little shiver the scene in the drawing-room at Green Bank, and how they had all refused to believe I was speaking the truth when I declared that the French poetry had entirely gone out of my head. And then there was the making up my mind that I could bear school no longer, and the secretly leaving the house, and at last losing my way in the streets.",be see pleasant real feel sure dreaming large old fashioned room red curtain window handsome dark wood furniture be fire burn grate window look clean be prospect chimney top see one near tell town begin distinguish sound room be lot wheel pass go lumber heavy slowness noisy own old home seem very heart town begin recall event day time remember lean carve lion show room real feel certain recollect little shiver scene draw room green refuse believe speak truth declare french poetry go head be making mind bear school leave house last lose way street
