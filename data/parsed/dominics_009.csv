1,CHAPTER 8. A QUARREL AND A CRICKET MATCH.,chapter quarrel match 
2,The first number of the _Dominican_ had undoubtedly caused a sensation; and it would have created far more sensation but for the fact that the Alphabet Match was to be played on the following day.  But even this counter-attraction could not wholly divert the mind of Saint Dominic's from this new literary marvel; and a skirmish took place on the very afternoon of its appearance.,first number _dominican_ cause sensation create more sensation fact play follow day counter attraction divert mind new literary marvel skirmish take place very afternoon appearance 
3,"Pembury and his friends had quite expected that the Sixth would attempt a high-handed blow at their paper, and they were not disappointed.  For no sooner had Loman and his peers stalked away from the scene of their indignation, and found themselves in the retirement of their own room, than they fell to talking in terms the reverse of pleasant about the event of the morning.  The least important of their number was specially wroth.",friend expect attempt high handed blow paper disappointed have peer stalked scene indignation find retirement own room fall talk term reverse pleasant event morning least important number wroth 
4,"""There's a great row out in the passage to-day,"" said Raleigh, who was blissfully ignorant of the whole matter; ""why can't some of you monitors keep a little better order?  The Doctor will be wanting to know what it's all about!""",be great row passage day say ignorant whole matter monitor keep little good order want know 
5,"""All very well,"" said Raikes, one of the monitors; ""but if the Fifth will stick their tomfoolery out in the passage, there's sure to be a row.""",say monitor fifth stick tomfoolery passage be sure row 
6,"""What tomfoolery?  Some of you are for ever grumbling at the Fifth.""",tomfoolery grumble fifth 
7,"""And so would you if you saw the complimentary remarks they make about you in this precious newspaper of theirs.""",see complimentary remark make precious newspaper 
8,"""Oh, the _Dominican_?  I must have a look at it by and by; but meanwhile something had better be done to stop that row, or we shall catch it ourselves.""",have look do stop row catch 
9,"And so saying, the captain left these injured youths to their own counsels, which it is to be feared were moved more by dislike for the _Dominican_ than by a burning desire for the good order of the school.",say captain leave injure youth own counsel fear move dislike burn desire good order school 
10,"However, they must do something; and there would be nothing inconsistent with their dignity in demanding the withdrawal of the obnoxious broadside on account of the noise it caused.  This would be a safe move, and might be checkmate.  Loman was deputed to wait upon the Fifth with the demand of the monitors, and lost no time in carrying out this welcome task.  Class was just over, and the Fifth were just about to clear out of their room when Loman entered.  It was not often that a Sixth Form fellow penetrated into their camp, and had they not guessed his mission they might have resented the intrusion.",do be inconsistent dignity demand withdrawal obnoxious broadside account noise cause safe move checkmate depute wait fifth demand monitor lose time carry welcome task class fifth about clear room enter sixth form fellow penetrate camp guess mission resent intrusion 
11,"""Oh, you fellows,"" began Loman, feeling not quite so confident now as he had felt five minutes ago, ""we can't have that thing of yours hanging out in the passage like that.  It makes a crowd--too much row.  Whose is it?""",fellow begin feel confident feel minute have thing hang passage make crowd much row 
12,"""Not mine,"" said Wraysford, laughing; ""ask Bully--perhaps it's his.""",say laugh ask 
13,"""Not a bit of it,"" said Bullinger; ""it's yours, isn't it, Simon?""",bit say 
14,"""Only part,"" said the poet of the ""Love-Ballad"", ""and I presented that to the paper.""",part say poet present paper 
15,"""Suppose it was mine?"" said Oliver, with a drawl.",suppose say drawl 
16,"""Then,"" said Loman, losing his temper, ""all I can say is, the sooner you clear it away the better.""",say lose temper say clear good 
17,"""Oh! all right; only it's not mine.""",right 
18,"""Look here,"" said Loman, ""I'm not going to fool about with you.  You may think it all very funny, but I'll report it to the Doctor, and then you'll look foolish.""",look say go fool think funny report look foolish 
19,"""How nice!  So pleasant it will be to look for once like what you look always,"" observed Pembury, gnawing the top of his crutch.",nice pleasant look look observe gnaw top crutch 
20,"At that moment there was a loud shout of laughter in the passage outside, confirming the monitor's complaint.  Wraysford walked hastily to the door.",moment be loud shout laughter passage confirm monitor complaint walk door 
21,"""The next time there's a row like that outside our door,"" called he to the group outside, ""we'll--what do you mean by it, you young blackguard?""",next time be row door call group mean young blackguard 
22,"So saying, he caught Master Bramble, who happened to be the nearest offender within reach, by the collar of his coat, and lugged him bodily into the class-room.",say catch happen near offender reach collar coat lugge class room 
23,"""There, now!  Do you know this gentleman?  He's a monitor.  Have a good look at him.  He's been complaining of the row you are making, and quite rightly.  Take that, and tell all the little Pigs outside that if they don't hold their noise they will find themselves, every man jack of them, _mentioned by name_ in the next number!""",know gentleman monitor have good look complain row make take tell little pig hold noise find man jack _mention name_ next number 
24,"So saying, with a gentle cuff he handed the ill-starred Master Bramble out again to his fellows, and from that time there was scarcely a sound audible from the passage.",say gentle cuff hand ill star fellow time be sound audible passage 
25,"""Good-bye,"" said Pembury, kissing his hand to Loman, who all this time had been standing in the middle of the room, in a white heat, and perplexed what to do or say next.",good bye say kiss hand time stand middle room white heat perplex do say 
26,"""You aren't going to live here, are you?"" asked Bullinger.",go live ask 
27,"""Any one got a toffee-drop?"" drily inquired Oliver.  To his surprise, and to the surprise of every one, Loman wheeled round towards the last speaker, and without a word struck him a blow on the mouth with his hand.",one get toffee drop inquire surprise surprise one wheel last speaker word strike blow mouth hand 
28,"He saw he had made a mistake, and looked ashamed the moment the deed was done.  All eyes turned to Oliver, whose face was crimson with a sudden flush of pain and anger.  He sprang to his feet, and Braddy, the bully, was already beginning to gloat over the prospect of a fight, when, to every one's amazement, Oliver coolly put his hands back into his pockets, and walking up to Loman said, quietly, ""Hadn't you better go?""",see make mistake look ashamed moment deed do eye turn face crimson sudden flush pain anger spring foot bully begin gloat prospect fight one amazement put hand pocket walk say go 
29,"Loman stared at him in astonishment.  He had at least expected to be knocked down, and this, behaviour was quite incomprehensible.",stare astonishment least expect knock behaviour incomprehensible 
30,He turned on his heel and quitted the room without a word; and somehow or other from that time the Fifth heard no more protests from the monitors on the subject of the _Dominican_.,turn heel quit room word other time fifth hear more protest monitor subject 
31,"But Oliver's conduct, much as it had astonished the person chiefly concerned, had astonished the Fifth still more.  For the first time in the history of their class, as far as they could recollect, a blow struck had not been returned, and they could not tell what to make of it.",conduct much astonished person concern astonished fifth more first time history class recollect blow strike return tell make 
32,"The blow had been a cowardly one, and certainly unmerited, and by all schoolboy tradition one fairly demanding a return.  Could it be possible their man was lacking in courage?  The idea was a shock to most present, who, although Oliver was never very popular among them, as has been said, had never before suspected his pluck.  In fact, it was an awkward moment for all, and it was quite a relief when Simon broke silence by asking Oliver, ""Why didn't you knock him down, I say?""",blow cowardly one unmerited schoolboy tradition one demand return possible man lack courage idea shock most present popular say suspect pluck fact awkward moment relief break silence ask knock say 
33,"""Because I did not choose, if you want to know,"" replied Oliver, shortly.",choose want know reply 
34,"""Oh!  I beg your pardon,"" replied Simon, rather taken aback by this brusque answer.",beg pardon reply take brusque answer 
35,"This was not satisfactory.  Had the offender been a Guinea-pig, one could have understood the thing; but when it was a Sixth Form fellow--a good match in every respect, as well as a rival--the Fifth were offended at their man for drawing back as he had done.",satisfactory offender guinea pig understand thing sixth form fellow good match respect rival fifth offend man draw do 
36,"""I suppose you _will_ fight him?"" said Ricketts, in a voice which implied that there was no doubt about it.",suppose fight say voice imply be doubt 
37,"""Do you?"" replied Oliver, briefly.",reply 
38,"The boy's manner was certainly not winsome, and, when once put out, it was evident he took no trouble to conceal the fact.  He refused to answer any further questions on the subject, and presently quitted the room, leaving more than half his class-fellows convinced that, after all, he _was_ a coward.",boy manner winsome put evident take trouble conceal fact refuse answer further question subject quit room leave more class fellow convince coward 
39,An angry discussion followed his departure.,angry discussion follow departure 
40,"""He ought to be made to fight, whether he likes or not,"" said Braddy the bully.",make fight like say bully 
41,"""Some one ought to pay Loman out,"" suggested Ricketts, ""if Greenfield doesn't.""",one ought pay suggest 
42,"""A nice name we shall get, all of us,"" said Bullinger, ""when it gets abroad all over the school.""",nice name get say get school 
43,"""It's a shame, because one fellow funks, for the whole Form to be disgraced; that's what I say,"" said some one else.",shame fellow funk whole form disgrace say say one else 
44,"There were, however, two boys who did not join in this general cry of indignation against Oliver, and they were Wraysford and Pembury.  The latter was always whimsical in his opinions, and no one was surprised to see him come out on the wrong side.  As for Wraysford, he always backed his friend up, whether others thought him right or wrong.  These two scouted the idea of Oliver being a coward; the one with his usual weapon of ridicule, the other with all the warmth of friendship.",be boy join general cry indignation latter whimsical opinion surprise see come wrong side back friend other think right wrong scout idea coward one usual weapon ridicule other warmth friendship 
45,"""Who calls him a coward?"" exclaimed Wraysford, glaring at the last speaker.",call coward exclaim glaring last speaker 
46,"Wraysford was not a coward, and looked so ready to avenge his friend by hard knocks, that the boy who had insinuated that Greenfield was afraid withdrew his charge as mildly as he could.  ""I only meant, it looks as if he didn't like to fight,"" he said.",coward look ready avenge friend hard knock boy insinuate afraid withdraw charge mean look like fight say 
47,"""And what business of yours is it what it looks like?"" demanded Wraysford.",business look demand 
48,"""Come, old man,"" said Pembury; ""don't eat him up!  I fancy Greenfield might screw up courage to pull _his_ nose, whoever else he lets off, eh? It's my private opinion, though, Oliver knew what he was about.""",come old man say eat fancy screw courage pull nose let private opinion know 
49,"""Of course he did,"" sneered Braddy; ""he knew jolly well what he was about.""",course sneer know jolly 
50,"""Dear me!  Is that you, Mr Braddy?  I had not noticed you here, or I should not have ventured to speak on a matter having to do with pluck and heroism.  I'm glad you agree with me, though, although I didn't say he knew _jolly_ well what he was about.  That is an expression of your own.""",notice venture speak matter have do pluck heroism glad agree say know expression own 
51,"Braddy, who as usual felt and looked extinguished when Pembury made fun of him, retired sulkily, and the editor of the _Dominican_ thereupon turned his attack on another quarter.  And so the dispute went on, neither party being convinced, and all satisfied only on one point--that a cloud had arisen to mar the hitherto peaceful horizon of Fifth Form existence.",usual feel look extinguish make fun retire editor thereupon turn attack quarter dispute go party convince satisfy point cloud arise make peaceful horizon fifth form existence 
52,"The cricket match of the following day, however, served to divert the thoughts of all parties for a time.",cricket match follow day serve divert thought party time 
53,"As it was only the prelude to a much more important match shortly to follow, I shall not attempt to describe it fully here, as the reader will probably be far more interested in the incidents of Sixth versus School Match when it comes off.",prelude important match follow attempt describe reader interested incident sixth come 
54,"The Alphabet Match was, to tell the truth, not nearly as interesting an affair as it promised to be, for from the very first the N's to Z's had the best of it.  Stephen, who with a company of fellow-Tadpoles and Guinea-pigs was perched on the palings, looking on, felt his heart sink within him as first one and then another of his brother's side lost their wickets without runs.  For once he and Bramble were in sympathy, and he and Paul were at difference.  The row these small boys kicked up, by the way, was one of the most notable features of the whole match. Every one of them yelled for his own side.  There had, indeed, been a question whether every Guinea-pig, whatever his private initial, ought not to yell for the G's, and every Tadpole for the T's; but it was eventually decided that each should yell ""on his own hook,"" and the effect was certainly far more diverting.",tell truth interesting affair promise very first have good company fellow pig perch paling look feel heart sink first one brother side lose wicket run sympathy difference row small boy kick way notable feature whole match yell own side question guinea pig private initial yell decide yell own hook effect divert 
55,"The first four men of the A to M went out for two runs between them, and Stephen and Bramble sat in gloomy despair.  The next man in knocked down his wicket before he had played a single ball.  It was frightful, and the jeers of the Z's were hateful to hear.",first man go run sit gloomy despair next man knock wicket play single ball frightful jeer hateful hear 
56,"But Stephen brightened as he perceived that the next batsman was his brother.  ""Now they'll pick up!"" said he.",brighten perceive next batsman brother pick say 
57,"""No they won't!  Greenfield senior skies his balls too much for my taste,"" cheeringly replied the small Bramble.",senior sky ball much taste reply small 
58,"But Stephen was right.  For the first time that afternoon the A's made a stand.  Oliver's partner at the wickets was Callonby, of the Sixth, a steady, plodding player, who hardly ever hit out, and got all his runs (if he got any) from the slips.  This afternoon he hardly scored at all, but kept his wicket carefully while Oliver did the hitting.",right first time afternoon make stand partner wicket steady plodding player hit get run get slip afternoon score keep wicket do hit 
59,"Things were looking up.  The telegraph went up from 2 to 20.  Wraysford, who had hitherto been bowling with Ricketts against his friend, gave up the ball to Raikes, and the field generally woke up to the importance of getting rid of this daring player.",thing look telegraph go bowl friend give ball field wake importance get rid dare player 
60,"Stephen's throat was too hoarse to roar any more, so he resigned that duty to Bramble, and looked on in delighted silence.  The score crept up, till suddenly Callonby tipped a ball into cover-slip's hand and was caught, to the great delight of the Z's, who guessed that, once a separation had been effected, the survivor would soon be disposed of.",throat hoarse roar more resign duty look delighted silence score creep tip ball cover slip hand catch great delight guess separation effect survivor dispose 
61,"The next man in was Loman.  He was better as a bowler than a batsman; but he followed Callonby's tactics and played a steady block, leaving the boy he had struck yesterday to do the hitting.",next man good bowler batsman follow tactic play steady block leave boy strike yesterday do hit 
62,"Oliver was certainly playing in fine form, and for a moment his class-fellows forgot their resentment against him in applauding his play.  The score was at 35, and the new coalition promised to be as formidable as the last, when Oliver cut a ball past point.",play fine form moment class fellow forget resentment applaud play score new coalition promise formidable last cut ball point 
63,"""Run! no! yes, run!"" he shouted.  Loman started, then hesitated, then started again--but it was too late.  Before he could get across, the ball was up and he was run out.  He was furious, and it certainly was hard lines for him, although there would have been time enough for the run had he not pulled up in the middle.  Forgetful of all the rules of cricket, he turned round to Oliver and shouted, ""You are a fool!"" as he left the wicket.",run run shout start hesitate start late get ball run furious hard line be time run pull middle forgetful rule cricket turn shout fool leave wicket 
64,"Stephen luckily was too much engrossed in watching the telegraph to hear or notice this remark; which, however, was not lost on the Fifth generally, who experienced a return of their former discontent when they observed that Oliver (though he must have heard it) took not the slightest notice of the offensive expression.",engross watch telegraph hear notice remark lose fifth experience return former discontent observe hear take slight notice offensive expression 
65,"The match passed off without further incident.  The Z's won in the end by two wickets, after a closer match than it had promised to be at first, and Stephen was comforted for the reverse by feeling sure that his brother at any rate had played his best, and would certainly get his place in the School Eleven.",match pass further incident win end wicket close match promise first comfort reverse feel sure brother rate play good get place
