2," When the fire of the enemy slackened, Charlie went to Mr. Holwell.",fire enemy slacken go 
3,"""It is impossible, sir,"" he said, ""that the fort can hold out; for in another three or four days, the whole of the garrison will be killed. The only hope of safety is for the ships to come up, and remove the garrison, which they can do without the slightest danger to themselves. If you will allow me, sir, I will swim down to the ships, and represent our situation. Cowardly and inhuman as Mr. Drake has proved himself, he can hardly refuse to give orders for the fleet to move.""",impossible sir say fort hold day whole garrison kill only hope safety ship come remove garrison do slight danger allow sir swim ship represent situation cowardly inhuman prove refuse give order fleet move 
4,"""I don't know,"" said Mr. Holwell. ""After the way in which he has behaved, there are no depths of infamy of which I believe him incapable. But you are my right hand here. Supposing Mr. Drake refuses, you could not return.""",know say way behave be depth infamy believe incapable right hand suppose refuse return 
5,"""I will come back, sir,"" Charlie answered. ""I will, if there be no other way, make my way along by the river bank. It is comparatively free of the enemy, as our guns command it. If you will place Mr. Haines at the corner bastion, with a rope, he will recognize my voice, and I can regain the fort.""",come sir answer be other way make way river bank free enemy gun command place corner bastion rope recognize voice regain fort 
6,"Mr. Holwell consented, and as soon as it was perfectly dark, Charlie issued out at the watergate, took off his coat, waistcoat, and boots, and entered the stream. The current was slack, but he had no difficulty in keeping himself afloat until he saw, close ahead of him, the lights of the ships.",consent dark issue watergate take coat waistcoat boot enter stream current slack have difficulty keep see light ship 
7,"He hailed that nearest him. A rope was thrown, and he was soon on board. Upon stating who he was, a boat was at once lowered, and he was taken to the ship upon which Mr. Drake and Captain Minchin had taken refuge. Upon saying that he was the bearer of a message from the gentleman now commanding the fort, he was conducted to the cabin, where Mr. Drake and Captain Minchin, having finished their dinner, were sitting comfortably over their wine with Captain Young, the senior captain of the Company's ships there.",hail near rope throw board state boat lower take ship take refuge say bearer message gentleman commanding fort conduct cabin finish dinner sit wine senior captain company ship 
8,"""I have come, sir,"" Charlie said to Mr. Drake, ""from Mr. Holwell; who has, in your absence, been elected to the command of the fort. He bids me tell you that our losses have been already very heavy, and that it is impossible that the fort can hold out for more than twenty-four hours longer. He begs you, therefore, to order up the ships tonight, in order that the garrison may embark.""",come sir say absence elect command fort bid tell loss heavy impossible fort hold more hour beg order ship tonight order garrison embark 
9,"""It is quite out of the question,"" Mr. Drake said coldly. ""Quite. It would be extremely dangerous.",question say quite dangerous 
10,"""You agree with me, Captain Young, that it would be most dangerous?""",agree dangerous 
11,"""I consider that it would be dangerous,"" Captain Young said.",consider dangerous say 
12,"""And you call yourself,"" Charlie exclaimed indignantly, ""a British sailor! You talk of danger, and would desert a thousand men, women, and children, including two hundred of your own countrymen, and leave them at the mercy of an enemy!""",call exclaim british sailor talk danger desert man woman child include own countryman leave mercy enemy 
13,"""You forget whom you are speaking to, sir,"" Mr. Drake said, angrily.",forget speak sir say 
14,"""I forgot nothing, sir,"" Charlie replied, trying to speak calmly. ""Then, sir, Mr. Holwell has charged me that if--which, however, he could not believe for a moment to be possible--you refuse to move up the ships to receive the garrison on board, that you would at least order all the boats up, as these would be amply sufficient to carry them away. Even in the daytime there would be no danger for the ships; and at night, at least, boats might come up, without being exposed to any risk whatever.""",forget sir reply try speak sir charge believe moment possible refuse move ship receive garrison board least order boat sufficient carry daytime be danger ship night least boat come expose risk 
15,"""I shall certainly do nothing of the sort,"" Mr. Drake said. ""The danger is even greater for the boats than for the ships.""",do sort say danger great boat ship 
16,"""And am I, sir, to return to the garrison of that fort, with the news that you utterly desert them, that you intend to remain quietly here, while they are sacrificed before your eyes? Is it possible that you are capable of such infamy as this?""",sir return garrison news desert intend remain sacrifice eye possible capable such infamy 
17,"""Infamy!"" exclaimed the three men, rising to their feet.",infamy exclaim man rise foot 
18,"""I place you in arrest at once, for your insolence,"" Mr. Drake said.",place arrest insolence say 
19,"""I despise your arrest, as I do yourself.",despise arrest do 
20,"""I did not believe it possible,"" Charlie said, at last giving vent to his anger and scorn; ""and England will not believe, that three Englishmen so cowardly, so infamous as yourselves, are to be found.",believe possible say last give vent anger scorn believe cowardly infamous find 
21,"""As for you, Captain Minchin, if ever after this I come across you, I will flog you publicly first, and shoot you afterwards like a dog, if you dare to meet me.",come flog shoot dog dare meet 
22,"""As for you, Mr. Drake--as for you, Captain Young--you will be doomed to infamy, by the contempt and loathing which Englishmen will feel, when this deed is known.",doom infamy contempt loathing feel deed know 
23,"""Cowards; base, infamous cowards!""",coward base infamous coward 
24,Charlie stepped back to go.,step go 
25,"""Seize him!"" Mr. Drake said, himself rushing forward.",seize say rush 
26,"Charlie drew back a step; and then, with all his strength, smote the governor between the eyes, and he fell in a heap beneath the table. Then Charlie grasped a decanter.",draw step strength smeat governor eye fall heap table grasp decanter 
27,"""Now,"" he said, ""if either of you hounds move a finger, I'll brain you.""",say hound move finger brain 
28,"The two officers stood paralysed. Charlie walked to the door, and sprang up the cabin stairs; and, as he did so, heard shouts for assistance from behind. He gained the deck, walked quietly to the bulwark and, placing his hand upon it, sprang over the side into the river. He swam to shore and, climbing up the bank, made his way along it back to the fort, where he arrived without any misadventure.",officer stand paralyse walk door spring cabin stair hear shout assistance gain deck walk bulwark place hand spring side river swim shore climb bank make way fort arrive misadventure 
29,"A fury of indignation seized all in the fort, when the result of Charlie's mission became known. With daybreak the attack recommenced; but the garrison, all day, bravely repulsed every attempt of the enemy to gain a footing. The fire from the houses was, however, so severe, that by nightfall nearly half the garrison were killed or wounded.",fury indignation seize fort result mission become know daybreak attack recommence garrison day repulse attempt enemy gain footing fire house severe nightfall garrison kill wound 
30,"All day the signals to the fleet were kept flying, but not a ship moved. All night, an anxious watch was kept, in hopes that, at the last moment, some returning feeling of shame might induce the recreants to send up the boats of the ships. But the night passed without a movement on the river, and in the morning the fleet were seen, still lying at anchor.",day signal fleet keep fly ship move night anxious watch keep hope last moment return feeling shame induce recreant send boat ship night pass movement river morning fleet see lie anchor 
31,"The enemy recommenced the attack, even more vigorously than before. The men fell fast and, to Charlie's great grief, his friend Mr. Haines was shot by a bullet, as he was standing next to him. Charlie anxiously knelt beside him.",enemy recommence attack man fall great grief friend shoot bullet stand knolt 
32,"""It is all over with me,"" he murmured. ""Poor little Ada. Do all you can for her, Marryat. God knows what fate is in store for her.""",murmure poor little know fate store 
33,"""I will protect her with my life, sir,"" Charlie said earnestly.",protect life sir say 
34,"Mr. Haines pressed his hand feebly, in token of gratitude; and, two or three minutes later, breathed his last.",press hand token gratitude minute breathe last 
35,"By midday, the loss had been so heavy that the men would no longer stand to their guns. Many of the European soldiers broke open the spirit stores, and soon drank to intoxication.",midday loss heavy man stand gun many european soldier break open spirit store drink intoxication 
36,"After a consultation with his officers, Mr. Holwell agreed that further resistance was hopeless. The flag of truce was therefore hoisted, and one of the officers at once started for the nabob's camp, with instructions to make the best terms he could for the garrison. When the gates were opened the enemy, seizing the opportunity, rushed in in great numbers; and as resistance was impossible, the garrison laid down their arms.",consultation officer agree further resistance hopeless flag truce hoist officer start nabob camp instruction make good term garrison gate open enemy seize opportunity rush great number resistance impossible garrison lay arm 
37,"Charlie at once hurried to the spot where Ada, and the only other European lady who had not escaped, were anxiously awaiting news. Both were exhausted with weeping.",hurry spot only other european lady escape await news exhaust weeping 
38,"""Where is papa, Captain Marryat?"" Ada asked.",ask 
39,"Charlie knew that the poor girl would need all her strength, for what she might have to undergo; and at once resolved that, for the present at least, it would be better that she should be in ignorance of the fate of her father. He therefore said that, for the present, Mr. Haines was unable to come, and had asked him to look after her.",know poor girl need strength have undergo resolve present least good ignorance fate father say present unable come ask look 
40,"It was not until five o'clock that the nabob entered the fort. He was furious at hearing that only five lacs of rupees had been found in the treasury, as he had expected to become possessed of a vastly larger sum. Kissendas, the first cause of the present calamities, was brought before him; but the capricious tyrant, contrary to expectation, received him courteously, and told him he might return to Dacca. The whole of the Eurasians, or half castes, and natives found in the fort were also allowed to return to their homes.",o'clock nabob enter fort furious hear lac rupee find treasury expect become possess large sum first cause present calamity bring capricious tyrant contrary expectation receive tell return whole half caste native find fort allow return home 
41,"Mr. Holwell was then sent for, and after the nabob had expressed his resentment at the small amount found in the treasury, he was dismissed, the nabob assuring him of his protection. Mr. Holwell returned to his English companions, who, one hundred and forty-six in number, including the two ladies, were drawn up under the veranda in front of the prison. The nabob then returned to his camp.",send nabob express resentment small amount find treasury dismiss nabob assure protection return english companion number include lady draw veranda front prison nabob return camp 
42,"Some native officers went in search of some building where the prisoners could be confined, but every room in the fort had already been taken possession of, by the nabob's soldiers and officers. At eight o'clock, they returned with the news that they could find no place vacant, and the officer in command at once ordered the prisoners into a small room, used as a guardroom for insubordinate soldiers, eighteen feet square.",native officer go search building prisoner confine room fort take possession nabob soldier officer o'clock return news find place vacant officer command order prisoner small room use guardroom insubordinate soldier foot square 
43,"In vain they protested that it was impossible the room could contain them, in vain implored the officer to allow some of them to be confined in an adjoining cell. The wretch was deaf to their entreaties. He ordered his soldiers to charge the prisoners, and these, with blows of the butt ends of the muskets, and prods of the bayonets, were driven into the narrow cell.",vain protest impossible room contain vain implore officer allow confine adjoin cell wretch deaf entreaty order soldier charge prisoner blow butt end musket prod bayonet drive narrow cell 
44,"Tim Kelly had kept close to his master, during the preceding days. The whole of the four native officers, who had so distinguished themselves under Charlie, were killed during the siege. Hossein, who would fain have shared his master's fortunes, was forcibly torn from him, when the English prisoners were separated from the natives.",keep close master preced day whole native officer distinguish kill siege fain share master fortune tear english prisoner separate native 
45,"The day had been unusually hot. The night was close and sultry, and the arched veranda, outside, further hindered the circulation of the air. This was still heavy with the fumes of powder, creating an intolerable thirst. Scarcely were the prisoners driven into their narrow cell where, even standing wedged closely together, there was barely room for them, than cries for water were raised.",day hot night close sultry arched veranda hinder circulation air heavy fume powder create intolerable thirst prisoner drive narrow cell standing wedge be room cry water raise 
46,"""Tim, my boy,"" Charlie said to his companion, ""we may say goodbye to each other now, for I doubt if one will be alive, when the door is opened in the morning.""",boy say companion say goodbye other doubt alive door open morning 
47,"On entering Charlie, always keeping Ada Haines by his side, had taken his place against the wall farthest from the window, which was closed with iron bars.",enter keep side take place wall farthest window close iron bar 
48,"""I think, yer honor,"" Tim said, ""that if we could get nearer to the window, we might breathe a little more easily.""",think honor say get nearer window breathe little 
49,"""Ay, Tim; but there will be a fight for life round that window, before long. You and I might hold our own, if we could get there, though it would be no easy matter where all are struggling for life; but this poor little girl would be crushed to death. Besides, I believe that what chance there is, faint as it may be, is greater for us here than there. The rush towards the window, which is beginning already, as you see, will grow greater and greater; and the more men struggle and strive, the more air they require.",be fight life window long hold own get easy matter struggle life poor little girl crush death believe chance be faint great rush window begin see grow great great more man struggle strive more air require 
50,"""Let us remain where we are. Strip off your coat and waistcoat, and breathe as quietly and easily as you can. Every hour the crowd will thin, and we may yet hold on till morning.""",let remain strip coat waistcoat breathe hour crowd thin hold morning 
51,This conversation had been held in a low voice. Charlie then turned to the girl.,conversation hold low voice turn girl 
52,"""How are you feeling, Ada?"" he asked cheerfully. ""It's hot, isn't it!""",feel ask hot 
53,"""It is dreadful,"" the girl panted, ""and I seem choking from want of air; and oh, Captain Marryat, I am so thirsty!""",dreadful girl pant seem choke want air thirsty 
54,"""It is hot, my dear, terribly hot, but we must make the best of it; and I hope, in a few days, you will join your mamma on board ship. That will be pleasant, won't it?""",hot dear hot make good hope few day join mamma board ship pleasant 
55,"""Where is papa?"" the girl wailed.",papa girl wail 
56,"""I don't know where he is now, my child. At any rate, we must feel very glad that he's not shut up here, with us. Now take your bonnet off, and your shawl, and undo the hooks of your dress, and loosen everything you can. We must be as quiet and cheerful as possible. I'm afraid, Ada, we have a bad time before us tonight. But try to keep cheerful and quiet; and above all, dear, pray God to give you strength to carry you through it, and to restore you safe to your mamma, in a few days.""",know child rate feel glad shut take bonnet shawl undo hook dress loosen quiet cheerful possible afraid have bad time tonight try keep cheerful quiet dear pray give strength carry restore safe mamma few day 
57,"As time went on, the scene in the dungeon became terrible. Shouts, oaths, cries of all kinds, rose in the air. Round the window men fought like wild beasts, tearing each other down, or clinging to the bars for dear life, for a breath of the air without. Panting, struggling, crying, men sank exhausted upon the floor, and the last remnants of life were trodden out of them, by those who surged forward to get near the window.",time go scene dungeon become terrible shout oath cry kind rise air window man fight wild beast tear other cling bar dear life breath air pant struggle cry man sink exhaust floor last remnant life trodd surge get window 
58,"In vain, Mr. Holwell implored them to keep quiet, for their own sakes. His voice was lost in the terrible din. Men, a few hours ago rich and respected merchants, now fought like maddened beasts for a breath of fresh air. In vain, those at the window screamed to the guards without, imploring them to bring water. Their prayers and entreaties were replied to only with brutal scoffs.",vain implore keep quiet own sake voice lose terrible din man few hour rich respect merchant fight madden beast breath fresh air vain window scream guard implor bring water prayer entreaty reply brutal scoff 
59,"Several times Charlie and Tim, standing together against the wall behind, where there was now room to move, lifted Ada between them, and sat her on their shoulders in order that, raised above the crowd, she might breathe more freely. Each time, after sitting there for a while, the poor girl begged to come down again; the sight of the terrible struggle, ever going on at the window, being too much for her; and when released, leaning against Charlie, supported by his arm, with her head against his shoulder, and her hands over her ears to shut out the dreadful sounds which filled the cell.",several time stand wall be room move lift sit shoulder order raise crowd breathe time sit while poor girl begg come sight terrible struggle go window much release lean support arm head shoulder hand ear shut dreadful sound fill cell 
60,"Hour passed after hour. There was more room now, for already half the inmates of the place had succumbed. The noises, too, had lessened, for no longer could the parched lips and throats utter articulate sounds. Charlie and Tim, strong men as they were, leaned utterly exhausted against the wall, bathed in perspiration, gasping for air.",hour pass hour be more room inmate place succumb noise lessen parched lip throat utter articulate sound strong man learn exhaust wall bath perspiration gasp air 
61,"""Half the night must be gone, Tim,"" Charlie said, ""and I think, with God's help, we shall live through it. The numbers are lessening fast, and every one who goes leaves more air for the rest of us.",night gone say think help live number lessen fast one go leave more air rest 
62,"""Cheer up, Ada dear, 'twill not be very long till morning.""",cheer dear long morning 
63,"""I think I shall die soon,"" the girl gasped. ""I shall never see papa or mamma again. You have been very kind, Captain Marryat, but it is no use.""",think die girl gasp see papa mamma kind use 
64,"""Oh, but it is of use,"" Charlie said cheerfully. ""I don't mean to let you die at all, but to hand you over to mamma, safe and sound. There, lay your head against me, dear, and say your prayers, and try and go off to sleep.""",use say mean let die hand mamma safe sound lay head dear say prayer try go sleep 
65,"Presently, however, Ada's figure drooped more and more, until her whole weight leaned upon Charlie's arm.",figure droop more more whole weight learn arm 
66,"""She has fainted, Tim,"" he said. ""Help me to raise her well in my arms, and lay her head on my shoulder. That's right. Now, you'll find her shawl somewhere under my feet; hold it up, and make a fan of it. Now, try to send some air into her face.""",faint say help raise arm lay head shoulder right find shawl foot hold make fan try send air face 
67,"By this time, not more than fifty out of the hundred and forty-six who entered the cell were alive. Suddenly a scream of joy, from those near the window, proclaimed that a native was approaching with some water. The struggle at the window was fiercer than ever. The bowl was too wide to pass through the bars, and the water was being spilt in vain; each man who strove to get his face far enough through to touch the bowl being torn back, by his eager comrades behind.",time more enter cell alive scream joy window proclaim native approach water struggle window fiercer bowl wide pass bar water spilt vain man strive get face touch bowl tear eager comrade 
68,"""Tim,"" Charlie said, ""you are now much stronger than most of them. They are faint from the struggles. Make a charge to the window. Take that little shawl and dip it into the bowl, or whatever they have there, and then fight your way back with it.""",say strong most faint struggle make charge window take little shawl dip bowl have fight way 
69,"""I will do it, yer honor,"" said Tim, and he rushed into the struggling group.",do honor say rush struggle group 
70,"Weak as he was from exhaustion and thirst, he was as a giant to most of the poor wretches, who had been struggling and crying all night; and, in spite of their cries and curses, he broke through them and forced his way to the window.",weak exhaustion thirst giant most poor wretche struggle cry night spite cry curse break force way window 
71,"The man with the bowl was on the point of turning away, the water being spilt in the vain attempts of those within to obtain it. By the light of the fire which the guard had lit without, Tim saw his face.",man bowl point turn water spilt vain attempt obtain light fire guard light see face 
72,"""Hossein,"" he exclaimed, ""more water, for God's sake! The master's alive yet.""",exclaim more water sake master alive 
73,"Hossein at once withdrew, but soon again approached with the bowl. The officer in charge angrily ordered him to draw back.",withdraw approach bowl officer charge order draw 
74,"""Let the infidel dogs howl,"" he said. ""They shall have no more.""",let infidel dog howl say have more 
75,"Regardless of the order, Hossein ran to the window, and Tim thrust the shawl into the water at the moment when the officer, rushing forward, struck Hossein to the ground: a cry of anguish rising from the prisoners, as they saw the water dashed from their lips.",order run window thrust shawl water moment officer rush strike ground cry anguish rise prisoner see water dash lip 
76,"Tim made his way back to the side of his master. Had those who still remained alive been aware of the supply of water which he carried, in the shawl, they would have torn it from him; but none save those just at the window had noticed the act, and inside it was still entirely dark.",make way side master have remain alive aware supply water carry shawl tear window notice act dark 
77,"""Thank God, yer honor, here it is,"" Tim said; ""and who should have brought it, but Hossein. Shure, yer honor, we both owe our lives to him this time, for I'm sure I should have been choked by thirst, before morning.""",thank honor say bring honor owe life time sure choke thirst morning 
78,"Ada was now lowered to the ground and, forcing her teeth asunder, a corner of the folded shawl was placed between her lips, and the water allowed to trickle down. With a gasping sigh, she presently recovered.",lower ground force tooth corner fold shawl place lip water allow trickle gasp sigh recover 
79,"""That is delicious,"" she murmured. ""That is delicious.""",delicious murmure delicious 
80,"Raising her to her feet, Charlie and Tim both sucked the dripping shawl, until the first agonies of thirst were relieved. Then, tearing off a portion, in case Ada should again require it, Charlie passed the shawl to Mr. Holwell; who, after sucking it for a moment, again passed it on to several standing round; and in this way many of those, who would otherwise have succumbed, were enabled to hold on until morning.",raise foot suck drip shawl first agony thirst relieve tear portion case require pass shawl suck moment pass several standing round way many succumb enable hold morning 
81,"Presently the first dawn of daylight appeared, giving fresh hopes to the few survivors. There were now only some six or eight standing by the window, and a few standing or leaning against the walls around. The room itself was heaped high with the dead.",first dawn daylight appear give fresh hope few survivor be standing window few standing lean wall room heap high dead 
82,"It was not until two hours later that the doors were opened, and the guard entered; and it was found that, of the hundred and forty-six Englishmen inclosed there the night before, but twenty-three still breathed. Of these, very few retained strength to stagger out through the door. The rest were carried out, and laid in the veranda.",hour door open guard enter find inclose night breathe few retain strength stagger door rest carry lay veranda 
83,"When the nabob came into the fort in the morning, he ordered Mr. Holwell to be brought before him. He was unable to walk, but was carried to his presence. The brutal nabob expressed no regret for what had happened, but loaded him with abuse, on account of the paucity of the treasure, and ordered him to be placed in confinement. The other prisoners were also confined in a cell. Ada, the only English female who had survived the siege, was torn, weeping, from Charlie's arms, and conveyed to the zenana, or ladies' apartments, of one of the nabob's generals.",nabob come fort morning order bring unable walk carry presence brutal nabob express regret happen load abuse account paucity treasure order place confinement other prisoner confine cell only english female survive siege tear weep arm convey zenana lady apartment nabob general

85,"The prospect was a gloomy one for the captives. That the English would, in time, return and extort a heavy reckoning from the nabob, they did not doubt for a moment. But nothing was more likely than that, at the news of the first disaster which befell his troops, the nabob would order his captives to be put to death.",prospect gloomy one captive time return extort heavy reckoning nabob doubt moment likely news first disaster befell troops nabob order captive put death 
86,"Upon the march up the country Charlie had, by his cheerfulness and good temper, gained the goodwill of the officer commanding the guard; and upon arriving at their destination, he recommended him so strongly to the commander of the prison that the latter, instead of placing him in the apartment allotted to the remainder of the prisoners, assigned a separate room to him; permitting Tim, at his request, to occupy it with him. It was a room of fair size, in a tower on one of the angles of the walls. It had bars, but these did not prevent those behind them looking out at the country which stretched around. The governor of the prison, finding that Charlie spoke the language fluently, often came up to sit with him, conversing with him on the affairs of that unknown country, England.",march country cheerfulness good temper gain goodwill officer commanding guard arrive destination recommend commander prison latter place apartment allot remainder prisoner assign separate room permitt request occupy room fair size tower angle wall have bar prevent look country stretch governor prison find speak language come sit convers affair unknown country 
87,"Altogether, they were fairly treated. Their food was plentiful and, beyond their captivity, they had little to complain of. Over and over again, they talked about the possibilities of effecting an escape; but, on entering the prison, they had noticed how good was the watch, how many and strong the doors through which they had passed. They had meditated upon making a rope and escaping from the window; but they slept on the divan, each with a rug to cover them; and these, torn into strips and twisted, would not reach a quarter of the way from their window to the ground; and there was no other material of which a rope could possibly have been formed.",treat food plentiful captivity have little complain talk possibility effect escape enter prison notice good watch many strong door pass meditate make rope escape window sleep divan rug cover tear strip twist reach quarter way window ground be other material rope form 
88,"""Our only hope,"" Charlie said one day, ""is in Hossein. I am sure he will follow us to the death; and if he did but know where we are confined, he would not, I am certain, rest day or night, till he had opened a communication with us.",only hope say day sure follow death know confine certain rest day night open communication

91,"""Mr. Charles!"" Tim exclaimed in great excitement, one day; ""there is a man I've been watching, for the last half hour. He seems to be picking up sticks, but all the while he keeps getting nearer and nearer, and two or three times it seems to me that he has looked up in this direction.""",exclaim great excitement day be man watch last half hour seem pick stick while keep get nearer nearer time seem look direction

94,"The man had now approached within two or three hundred yards of the corner of the wall. He was apparently collecting pieces of dried brushwood, for firing. Presently, he glanced in the direction of the window. Charlie thrust his arm through the bar, and waved his hand. The man threw up his arm with a gesture which, to a casual observer, would have appeared accidental; but which the watchers had no doubt, whatever, was intended for them. He was still too far off from them to be able to distinguish his features, but they had not the least doubt that it was Hossein.",man approach yard corner wall collect piece dry brushwood fire glance direction window thrust arm bar wave hand man throw arm gesture casual observer appear accidental watcher have doubt intend able distinguish feature have least doubt
