3,"There is a certain sort of fellow--we who are used to studying boys all know him well enough--of whom you can predicate with almost positive certainty, after he has been a month at school, that he is sure to have a fight, and with almost equal certainty that he will have but one. Tom Brown was one of these; and as it is our well-weighed intention to give a full, true, and correct account of Tom’s only single combat with a school-fellow in the manner of our old friend Bell’s Life, let those young persons whose stomachs are not strong, or who think a good set-to with the weapons which God has given us all an uncivilized, unchristian, or ungentlemanly affair, just skip this chapter at once, for it won’t be to their taste.",be certain sort fellow use study boy know predicate positive certainty month school sure have fight equal certainty have weigh intention give full true correct account single combat school fellow manner old friend let young person stomach strong think good set weapon give uncivilized unchristian ungentlemanly affair skip chapter taste 
4,"It was not at all usual in those days for two School-house boys to have a fight. Of course there were exceptions, when some cross-grained, hard-headed fellow came up who would never be happy unless he was quarrelling with his nearest neighbours, or when there was some class-dispute, between the fifth form and the fags, for instance, which required blood-letting; and a champion was picked out on each side tacitly, who settled the matter by a good hearty mill. But, for the most part, the constant use of those surest keepers of the peace, the boxing-gloves, kept the School-house boys from fighting one another. Two or three nights in every week the gloves were brought out, either in the hall or fifth-form room; and every boy who was ever likely to fight at all knew all his neighbours’ prowess perfectly well, and could tell to a nicety what chance he would have in a stand-up fight with any other boy in the house. But, of course, no such experience could be gotten as regarded boys in other houses; and as most of the other houses were more or less jealous of the School-house, collisions were frequent.",usual day school house boy have fight course be exception cross -grained hard headed fellow come happy quarrell near neighbour be class dispute fifth form fag instance require blood let champion pick side settle matter good hearty mill most part constant use sure keeper peace boxing glove keep house boy fight night week glove bring hall fifth form room boy likely fight know neighbour prowess tell nicety chance have stand fight other boy house course such experience get regard boy other house most other house jealous house collision frequent 
5,"After all, what would life be without fighting, I should like to know? From the cradle to the grave, fighting, rightly understood, is the business, the real highest, honestest business of every son of man. Every one who is worth his salt has his enemies, who must be beaten, be they evil thoughts and habits in himself, or spiritual wickednesses in high places, or Russians, or Border-ruffians, or Bill, Tom, or Harry, who will not let him live his life in quiet till he has thrashed them.",life fight like know cradle grave fighting understand business real high honestest business son man one worth salt have enemy beat evil thought habit spiritual wickedness high place ruffian let live life quiet thrash 
6,"It is no good for quakers, or any other body of men, to uplift their voices against fighting. Human nature is too strong for them, and they don’t follow their own precepts. Every soul of them is doing his own piece of fighting, somehow and somewhere. The world might be a better world without fighting, for anything I know, but it wouldn’t be our world; and therefore I am dead against crying peace when there is no peace, and isn’t meant to be. I am as sorry as any man to see folk fighting the wrong people and the wrong things, but I’d a deal sooner see them doing that than that they should have no fight in them. So having recorded, and being about to record, my hero’s fights of all sorts, with all sorts of enemies, I shall now proceed to give an account of his passage-at-arms with the only one of his school-fellows whom he ever had to encounter in this manner.",good quaker other body man uplift voice fighting human nature strong follow own precept soul do own piece fighting world good world fight know world dead cry peace be peace mean sorry man see folk fight wrong person wrong thing deal see do have fight record about record hero fight sort sort enemy proceed give account passage arm only one school fellow have encounter manner 
7,"It was drawing towards the close of Arthur’s first half-year, and the May evenings were lengthening out. Locking-up was not till eight o’clock, and everybody was beginning to talk about what he would do in the holidays. The shell, in which form all our dramatis personae now are, were reading, amongst other things, the last book of Homer’s “Iliad,” and had worked through it as far as the speeches of the women over Hector’s body. It is a whole school-day, and four or five of the School-house boys (amongst whom are Arthur, Tom, and East) are preparing third lesson together. They have finished the regulation forty lines, and are for the most part getting very tired, notwithstanding the exquisite pathos of Helen’s lamentation. And now several long four-syllabled words come together, and the boy with the dictionary strikes work.",draw close first half year evening lengthen locking o'clock begin talk do holiday shell form dramatis personae read other thing last book work speech woman body whole school day house boy prepare third lesson finish regulation line most part get tired notwithstand exquisite patho lamentation several long syllabled word come boy dictionary strike work

10,"So an adjournment to the close was carried nem. con., little Arthur not daring to uplift his voice; but, being deeply interested in what they were reading, stayed quietly behind, and learnt on for his own pleasure.",adjournment close carry con. little dare uplift voice interested read stay learn own pleasure 
11,"As East had said, the regular master of the form was unwell, and they were to be heard by one of the new masters--quite a young man, who had only just left the university. Certainly it would be hard lines if, by dawdling as much as possible in coming in and taking their places, entering into long-winded explanations of what was the usual course of the regular master of the form, and others of the stock contrivances of boys for wasting time in school, they could not spin out the lesson so that he should not work them through more than the forty lines. As to which quantity there was a perpetual fight going on between the master and his form--the latter insisting, and enforcing by passive resistance, that it was the prescribed quantity of Homer for a shell lesson; the former, that there was no fixed quantity, but that they must always be ready to go on to fifty or sixty lines if there were time within the hour. However, notwithstanding all their efforts, the new master got on horribly quick. He seemed to have the bad taste to be really interested in the lesson, and to be trying to work them up into something like appreciation of it, giving them good, spirited English words, instead of the wretched bald stuff into which they rendered poor old Homer, and construing over each piece himself to them, after each boy, to show them how it should be done.",say regular master form unwell hear new master young man leave university hard line dawdle possible come take place enter long winded explanation usual course regular master form other stock contrivance boy waste time school spin lesson work more line quantity be perpetual fight go master form latter insist enforce passive resistance prescribe quantity shell lesson former be fix quantity ready go line be time hour notwithstand effort new master get quick seem have bad taste interested lesson try work appreciation give good spirit english word wretch bald stuff render poor old construe piece boy show do 
12,"Now the clock strikes the three-quarters; there is only a quarter of an hour more, but the forty lines are all but done. So the boys, one after another, who are called up, stick more and more, and make balder and ever more bald work of it. The poor young master is pretty near beat by this time, and feels ready to knock his head against the wall, or his fingers against somebody else’s head. So he gives up altogether the lower and middle parts of the form, and looks round in despair at the boys on the top bench, to see if there is one out of whom he can strike a spark or two, and who will be too chivalrous to murder the most beautiful utterances of the most beautiful woman of the old world. His eye rests on Arthur, and he calls him up to finish construing Helen’s speech. Whereupon all the other boys draw long breaths, and begin to stare about and take it easy. They are all safe: Arthur is the head of the form, and sure to be able to construe, and that will tide on safely till the hour strikes.",clock strike quarter be quarter hour more line do boy call stick more more make balder bald work poor young master beat time feel ready knock head wall finger else head give low middle part form look despair boy top bench see be strike spark chivalrous murder beautiful utterance beautiful woman old world eye rest call finish construe speech other boy draw long breath begin stare take easy safe head form sure able construe tide hour strike

15,"He looks up at Arthur. “Why, bless us,” thinks he, “what can be the matter with the young un? He’s never going to get floored. He’s sure to have learnt to the end.” Next moment he is reassured by the spirited tone in which Arthur begins construing, and betakes himself to drawing dogs’ heads in his notebook, while the master, evidently enjoying the change, turns his back on the middle bench and stands before Arthur, beating a sort of time with his hand and foot, and saying; “Yes, yes,”  “Very well,” as Arthur goes on.",look bless think matter young un go floor sure learn end next moment reassure spirit tone begin construe betake draw dog head notebook master enjoy change turn back middle bench stand beat sort time hand foot say go

17,"Suddenly at this point Arthur breaks down altogether, and fairly bursts out crying, and dashes the cuff of his jacket across his eyes, blushing up to the roots of his hair, and feeling as if he should like to go down suddenly through the floor. The whole form are taken aback; most of them stare stupidly at him, while those who are gifted with presence of mind find their places and look steadily at their books, in hopes of not catching the master’s eye and getting called up in Arthur’s place.",point break burst cry dash cuff jacket eye blush root hair feel like go floor whole form take most stare gift presence mind find place look book hope catching master eye call place 
18,"The master looks puzzled for a moment, and then seeing, as the fact is, that the boy is really affected to tears by the most touching thing in Homer, perhaps in all profane poetry put together, steps up to him and lays his hand kindly on his shoulder, saying, “Never mind, my little man, you’ve construed very well. Stop a minute; there’s no hurry.”",master look puzzle moment see fact boy affect tear touch thing profane poetry put step lay hand shoulder say mind little man construe stop minute be hurry 
19,"Now, as luck would have it, there sat next above Tom on that day, in the middle bench of the form, a big boy, by name Williams, generally supposed to be the cock of the shell, therefore of all the school below the fifths. The small boys, who are great speculators on the prowess of their elders, used to hold forth to one another about Williams’s great strength, and to discuss whether East or Brown would take a licking from him. He was called Slogger Williams, from the force with which it was supposed he could hit. In the main, he was a rough, goodnatured fellow enough, but very much alive to his own dignity. He reckoned himself the king of the form, and kept up his position with the strong hand, especially in the matter of forcing boys not to construe more than the legitimate forty lines. He had already grunted and grumbled to himself when Arthur went on reading beyond the forty lines; but now that he had broken down just in the middle of all the long words, the Slogger’s wrath was fairly roused.",luck have sit day middle bench form big boy name suppose cock shell school fifth small boy great speculator prowess elder use hold great strength discuss take lick call force suppose hit main rough goodnatured fellow alive own dignity reckon king form keep position strong hand matter force boy construe more legitimate line grunt grumble go read line break middle long word wrath rouse

24,"“Hullo!” exclaimed Williams, looking at Tom with great surprise for a moment, and then giving him a sudden dig in the ribs with his elbow, which sent Tom’s books flying on to the floor, and called the attention of the master, who turned suddenly round, and seeing the state of things, said,--",exclaim look great surprise moment give sudden dig rib elbow send book fly floor call attention master turn see state thing say

Tom Brown and Slogger Williams.”",run tell come back say small school house boy rocket stop moment poke head house hall low boy tea sing fight

49,"Tom felt he had got his work cut out for him, as he stripped off his jacket, waistcoat, and braces. East tied his handkerchief round his waist, and rolled up his shirtsleeves for him. “Now, old boy, don’t you open your mouth to say a word, or try to help yourself a bit--we’ll do all that; you keep all your breath and strength for the Slogger.” Martin meanwhile folded the clothes, and put them under the chapel rails; and now Tom, with East to handle him, and Martin to give him a knee, steps out on the turf, and is ready for all that may come; and here is the Slogger too, all stripped, and thirsting for the fray.",feel get work cut stripp jacket waistcoat brace tie handkerchief waist roll shirtsleeve old boy open mouth say word try help bit do keep breath strength fold clothes put chapel rail handle give knee step turf ready come stripp thirst fray 
50,"It doesn’t look a fair match at first glance: Williams is nearly two inches taller, and probably a long year older than his opponent, and he is very strongly made about the arms and shoulders--“peels well,” as the little knot of big fifth-form boys, the amateurs, say, who stand outside the ring of little boys, looking complacently on, but taking no active part in the proceedings. But down below he is not so good by any means--no spring from the loins, and feeblish, not to say shipwrecky, about the knees. Tom, on the contrary, though not half so strong in the arms, is good all over, straight, hard, and springy, from neck to ankle, better perhaps in his legs than anywhere. Besides, you can see by the clear white of his eye, and fresh, bright look of his skin, that he is in tip-top training, able to do all he knows; while the Slogger looks rather sodden, as if he didn’t take much exercise and ate too much tuck. The time-keeper is chosen, a large ring made, and the two stand up opposite one another for a moment, giving us time just to make our little observations.",look fair match first glance inch tall long year old opponent make arm shoulder peel little knot big fifth form boy amateur stand ring little boy look take active part proceedings good means spring loin feeblish say knee contrary half strong arm good straight hard springy neck ankle leg see clear white eye fresh bright look skin tip top training able do know look sodden take much exercise eat much tuck time keeper choose large ring make stand moment give time make little observation

52,"But seemingly he won’t, for there he goes in, making play with both hands. Hard all is the word; the two stand to one another like men; rally follows rally in quick succession, each fighting as if he thought to finish the whole thing out of hand. “Can’t last at this rate,” say the knowing ones, while the partisans of each make the air ring with their shouts and counter-shouts of encouragement, approval, and defiance.",go make play hand hard word stand man rally follow rally quick succession fight think finish whole thing hand last rate say know one partisan make air ring shout counter shout encouragement approval defiance 
53,"“Take it easy, take it easy; keep away; let him come after you,”  implores East, as he wipes Tom’s face after the first round with a wet sponge, while he sits back on Martin’s knee, supported by the Madman’s long arms which tremble a little from excitement.",take easy take easy keep let come implore wipe face first round wet sponge sit knee support long arm tremble little excitement

55,"“There he goes again, hang it all!” growls East, as his man is at it again, as hard as ever.

Feint him; use your legs; draw him about. He’ll lose his wind then in no time, and you can go into him. Hit at his body too; we’ll take care of his frontispiece by-and-by.”",old boy whisper fun death hit fight minute go drown island ditch feint use leg draw lose wind time go hit body take care frontispiece 
61,"Tom felt the wisdom of the counsel, and saw already that he couldn’t go in and finish the Slogger off at mere hammer and tongs, so changed his tactics completely in the third round. He now fights cautiously, getting away from and parrying the Slogger’s lunging hits, instead of trying to counter, and leading his enemy a dance all round the ring after him. “He’s funking; go in, Williams,” “Catch him up,” “Finish him off,”  scream the small boys of the Slogger party.",feel wisdom counsel see go finish mere hammer tong change tactic third round fight get parry lung hit try counter lead enemy dance ring funk go catch finish scream small boy

65,"“Now, then, Tom,” sings out East, dancing with delight. Tom goes in in a twinkling, and hits two heavy body blows, and gets away again before the Slogger can catch his wind, which when he does he rushes with blind fury at Tom, and being skilfully parried and avoided, overreaches himself and falls on his face, amidst terrific cheers from the School-house boys.",sing dance delight go twinkling hit heavy body blow get catch wind rush blind fury parry avoid overreach fall face terrific cheer house boy

So he too begins to use his head, and tries to make Tom lose his patience, and come in before his time. And so the fight sways on, now one and now the other getting a trifling pull.",round seem see go win meet match begin use head try make lose patience come time fight sway other get trifl pull 
69,"Tom’s face begins to look very one-sided--there are little queer bumps on his forehead, and his mouth is bleeding; but East keeps the wet sponge going so scientifically that he comes up looking as fresh and bright as ever. Williams is only slightly marked in the face, but by the nervous movement of his elbows you can see that Tom’s body blows are telling. In fact, half the vice of the Slogger’s hitting is neutralized, for he daren’t lunge out freely for fear of exposing his sides. It is too interesting by this time for much shouting, and the whole ring is very quiet.",face begin look sided be little queer bump forehead mouth bleed keep wet sponge go come look fresh bright mark face nervous movement elbow see body blow tell fact vice hit neutralize lunge fear expose side interesting time much shouting whole ring quiet

71,"But where is Arthur all this time? Words cannot paint the poor little fellow’s distress. He couldn’t muster courage to come up to the ring, but wandered up and down from the great fives court to the corner of the chapel rails, now trying to make up his mind to throw himself between them, and try to stop them; then thinking of running in and telling his friend Mary, who, he knew, would instantly report to the Doctor. The stories he had heard of men being killed in prize-fights rose up horribly before him.",time word paint poor little fellow distress muster courage come ring wander great fives court corner chapel rail try make mind throw try stop think run tell friend know report story hear man kill prize fight rise 
72,"Once only, when the shouts of “Well done, Brown!” “Huzza for the School-house!” rose higher than ever, he ventured up to the ring, thinking the victory was won. Catching sight of Tom’s face in the state I have described, all fear of consequences vanishing out of his mind; he rushed straight off to the matron’s room, beseeching her to get the fight stopped, or he should die.",shout do house rise high venture ring think victory win catch sight face state describe fear consequence vanish mind rush matron room beseech get fight stop die 
73,"But it’s time for us to get back to the close. What is this fierce tumult and confusion? The ring is broken, and high and angry words are being bandied about. “It’s all fair”--“It isn’t”--“No hugging!” The fight is stopped. The combatants, however, sit there quietly, tended by their seconds, while their adherents wrangle in the middle. East can’t help shouting challenges to two or three of the other side, though he never leaves Tom for a moment, and plies the sponges as fast as ever.",time get close fierce tumult confusion ring break high angry word band fair hug fight stop combatant sit tend second adherent wrangle middle help shouting challenge other side leave moment plie sponge 
74,"The fact is, that at the end of the last round, Tom, seeing a good opening, had closed with his opponent, and after a moment’s struggle, had thrown him heavily, by help of the fall he had learnt from his village rival in the Vale of White Horse. Williams hadn’t the ghost of a chance with Tom at wrestling; and the conviction broke at once on the Slogger faction that if this were allowed their man must be licked. There was a strong feeling in the School against catching hold and throwing, though it was generally ruled all fair within limits; so the ring was broken and the fight stopped.",fact end last round see good opening close opponent moment struggle throw help fall learn village rival white ghost chance wrestling conviction break faction allow man lick be strong feeling catching hold throw rule fair limit ring break fight stop 
75,"The School-house are overruled--the fight is on again, but there is to be no throwing; and East, in high wrath, threatens to take his man away after next round (which he don’t mean to do, by the way), when suddenly young Brooke comes through the small gate at the end of the chapel. The School-house faction rush to him. “Oh, hurrah! now we shall get fair play.”",house overrule fight be be throw high wrath threaten take man next round mean do way young come small gate end chapel house faction rush get fair play

Brooke can’t find it in his heart to stop them just yet, so the round goes on, the Slogger waiting for Tom, and reserving all his strength to hit him out should he come in for the wrestling dodge again, for he feels that that must be stopped, or his sponge will soon go up in the air.",time boy rise face find heart stop round go wait reserve strength hit come wrestling dodge feel stop sponge go air

89,"It is grim earnest now, and no mistake. Both boys feel this, and summon every power of head, hand, and eye to their aid. A piece of luck on either side, a foot slipping, a blow getting well home, or another fall, may decide it. Tom works slowly round for an opening; he has all the legs, and can choose his own time. The Slogger waits for the attack, and hopes to finish it by some heavy right-handed blow. As they quarter slowly over the ground, the evening sun comes out from behind a cloud and falls full on Williams’s face. Tom darts in; the heavy right hand is delivered, but only grazes his head. A short rally at close quarters, and they close; in another moment the Slogger is thrown again heavily for the third time.",grim earnest mistake boy feel summon power head hand eye aid piece luck side foot slip blow get fall decide work opening have leg choose own time wait attack hope finish heavy right handed blow quarter ground evening sun come cloud fall full face dart heavy right hand deliver graze head short rally close quarter close moment throw third time

He was not a bit the worse, except a slight difficulty in his vision, a singing in his ears, and a sprained thumb, which he kept in a cold-water bandage, while he drank lots of tea, and listened to the babel of voices talking and speculating of nothing but the fight, and how Williams would have given in after another fall (which he didn’t in the least believe), and how on earth the Doctor could have got to know of it--such bad luck! He couldn’t help thinking to himself that he was glad he hadn’t won; he liked it better as it was, and felt very friendly to the Slogger. And then poor little Arthur crept in and sat down quietly near him, and kept looking at him and the raw beef with such plaintive looks that Tom at last burst out laughing.",stanchest adherent reach bustle get late tea stump send butcher get piece raw beef eye healed hand show morning bit bad slight difficulty vision singing ear sprain thumb keep cold water bandage drink lot tea listen babel voice talk speculate fight give fall least believe earth get know such bad luck help think glad win like good feel friendly poor little creep sit keep look raw beef such plaintive look last burst laugh

123,"And now, boys all, three words before we quit the subject. I have put in this chapter on fighting of malice prepense, partly because I want to give you a true picture of what everyday school life was in my time, and not a kid-glove and go-to-meeting-coat picture, and partly because of the cant and twaddle that’s talked of boxing and fighting with fists nowadays. Even Thackeray has given in to it; and only a few weeks ago there was some rampant stuff in the Times on the subject, in an article on field sports.",boy word quit subject put chapter fighting malice prepense want give true picture everyday school life time kid glove go meeting coat picture cant twaddle talk boxing fight fist give few week be rampant stuff subject article field sport

When the time comes, if it ever should, that you have to say “Yes” or “No” to a challenge to fight, say “No” if you can--only take care you make it clear to yourselves why you say “No.” It’s a proof of the highest courage, if done from true Christian motives. It’s quite right and justifiable, if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger. But don’t say “No” because you fear a licking, and say or think it’s because you fear God, for that’s neither Christian nor honest. And if you do fight, fight it out; and don’t give in while you can stand and see.",fighting keep means time come have say challenge fight say take care make clear say proof high courage do true christian motive right justifiable do simple aversion physical pain danger say fear lick say think fear honest fight fight give stand see
