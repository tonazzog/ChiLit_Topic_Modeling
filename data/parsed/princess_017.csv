1,CHAPTER XVII. SPRING-TIME,spring time 
2," THE spring, so dear to all creatures, young and old, came at last, and before the first few days of it had gone, the king rode through its budding valleys to see his little daughter. He had been in a distant part of his dominions all the winter, for he was not in the habit of stopping in one great city, or of visiting only his favorite country houses, but he moved from place to place, that all his people might know him. Wherever he journeyed, he kept a constant lookout for the ablest and best men to put into office, and wherever he found himself mistaken, and those he had appointed incapable or unjust, he removed them at once. Hence you see it was his care of the people that kept him from seeing his princess so often as he would have liked. You may wonder why he did not take her about with him; but there were several reasons against his doing so, and I suspect her great-great-grandmother had had a principal hand in preventing it. Once more Irene heard the bugle-blast, and once more she was at the gate to meet her father as he rode up on his great white horse.",spring dear creature young old come last first few day go king ride budding valley see little daughter distant part dominion winter habit stop great city visit favorite country house move place place person know journey keep constant lookout able good man put office find mistaken appoint incapable unjust remove see care person keep see princess like wonder take be several reason do suspect great great grandmother have principal hand prevent hear bugle blast more gate meet father ride great white horse

14,"The king was much disturbed on hearing the report of the gentlemen-at-arms concerning the creatures they had seen; and I presume would have taken Irene with him that very day, but for what the presence of the ring on her finger assured him of. About an hour before he left, Irene saw him go up the old stair; and he did not come down again till they were just ready to start; and she thought with herself that he had been up to see the old lady. When he went away, he left the other six gentlemen behind him, that there might be six of them always on guard.",king disturb hear report gentleman arm concern creature see presume take very day presence ring finger assure hour leave see go old stair come ready start think see old lady go leave other gentleman be guard 
15,"And now, in the lovely spring-weather, Irene was out on the mountain the greater part of the day. In the warmer hollows there were lovely primroses, and not so many that she ever got tired of them. As often as she saw a new one opening an eye of light in the blind earth, she would clap her hands with gladness, and, unlike some children I know, instead of pulling it, would touch it as tenderly as if it had been a new baby, and, having made its acquaintance, would leave it as happy as she found it. She treated the plants on which they grew like birds' nests; every fresh flower was like a new little bird to her. She would pay a visit to all the flower-nests she knew, remembering each by itself. She would go down on her hands and knees beside one and say ""Good morning! Are you all smelling very sweet this morning? Good-bye!"" And then she would go to another nest, and say the same. It was a favorite amusement with her. There were many flowers up and down, and she loved them all, but the primroses were her favorites.",lovely spring weather mountain great part day warm hollow be lovely primrose many get tired see new one open eye light blind earth clap hand gladness child know pull touch new baby make acquaintance leave happy find treat plant grow bird nest fresh flower new little bird pay visit flower nest know remember go hand knee say good morning smell sweet morning good go nest say same favorite amusement be many flower love primrose favorite 
16,"""They're not too shy, and they're not a bit forward,"" she would say to Lootie.",shy bit say 
17,"There were goats too about, over the mountain, and when the little kids came, she was as pleased with them as with the flowers. The goats belonged to the miners mostly--a few of them to Curdie's mother; but there were a good many wild ones that seemed to belong to nobody. These the goblins counted theirs, and it was upon them partly that they lived. They set snares and dug pits for them; and did not scruple to take what tame ones happened to be caught; but they did not try to steal them in any other manner, because they were afraid of the dogs the hill-people kept to watch them, for the knowing dogs always tried to bite their feet. But the goblins had a kind of sheep of their own--very queer creatures, which they drove out to feed at night, and the other goblin-creatures were wise enough to keep good watch over them, for they knew they should have their bones by and by.",be goat mountain little kid come pleased flower goat belong miner few mother be good many wild one seem belong goblin count live set snare dig pit scruple take tame one happen catch try steal other manner afraid dog hill person keep watch know dog try bite foot goblin have kind sheep own queer creature drive feed night other goblin creature wise keep good watch know have bone
