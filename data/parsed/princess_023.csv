1,CHAPTER XXIII. CURDIE AND HIS MOTHER,curdie mother 
2," CURDIE went up the mountain neither whistling nor singing, for he was vexed with Irene for taking him in, as he called it; and he was vexed with himself for having spoken to her so angrily. His mother gave a cry of joy when she saw him, and at once set about getting him something to eat, asking him questions all the time, which he did not answer so cheerfully as usual. When his meal was ready, she left him to eat it, and hurried to the mine to let his father know he was safe. When she came back, she found him fast asleep upon her bed; nor did he wake until the arrival home of his father in the evening.",go mountain whistling sing vex take call vex speak mother give cry joy see set get eat ask question time answer usual meal ready leave eat hurry let father know safe come find bed wake arrival home father evening

5,"""And what happened after that?"" asked his mother. ""You haven't told us all. You ought to be very happy at having got away from those demons, and instead of that, I never saw you so gloomy. There must be something more. Besides, you do not speak of that lovely child as I should like to hear you. She saved your life at the risk of her own, and yet somehow you don't seem to think much of it.""",happen ask mother tell happy get demon see gloomy be more speak lovely child like hear save life risk own seem think much

10,"""You confess, my boy,"" she said, ""there is something about the whole affair you do not understand?""",confess boy say be whole affair understand 
11,"""Yes, of course, mother,"" he answered, ""I cannot understand how a child knowing nothing about the mountain, or even that I was shut up in it, should come all that way alone, straight to where I was; and then, after getting me out of the hole, lead me out of the mountain, too, where I should not have known a step of the way if it had been as light as in the open air.""",course mother answer understand child know mountain shut come way get hole lead mountain know step way light open air 
12,"""Then you have no right to say that what she told you was not true. She did take you out, and she must have had something to guide her: why not a thread as well as a rope, or anything else? There is something you cannot explain, and her explanation may be the right one.""",have right say tell true take have guide thread rope else be explain explanation right one 
13,"""It's no explanation at all, mother; and I can't believe it.""",explanation mother believe 
14,"""That may be only because you do not understand it. If you did, you would probably find it was an explanation, and believe it thoroughly. I don't blame you for not being able to believe it, but I do blame you for fancying such a child would try to deceive you. Why should she? Depend upon it, she told you all she knew. Until you had found a better way of accounting for it all, you might at least have been more sparing of your judgment.""",understand find explanation believe blame able believe blame fancy child try deceive depend tell know find good way accounting least sparing judgment 
15,"""That is what something inside me has been saying all the time,"" said Curdie, hanging down his head. ""But what do you make of the grandmother? That is what I can't get over. To take me up to an old garret, and try to persuade me against the sight of my own eyes that it was a beautiful room, with blue walls and silver stars, and no end of things in it, when there was nothing there but an old tub and a withered apple and a heap of straw and a sunbeam! It was too bad! She _might_ have had some old woman there at least who could pass for her precious grandmother!""",say time say hang head make grandmother get take old garret try persuade sight own eye beautiful room blue wall silver star end thing be old tub wither apple heap straw sunbeam bad _might_ have old woman least pass precious grandmother 
16,"""Didn't she speak as if she saw those other things herself, Curdie?""",speak see other thing 
17,"""Yes. That's what bothers me. You would have thought she really meant and believed that she saw every one of the things she talked about. And not one of them there! It was too bad, I say.""",bother think mean believe see one thing talk bad say 
18,"""Perhaps some people can see things other people can't see, Curdie,"" said his mother very gravely. ""I think I will tell you something I saw myself once--only perhaps you won't believe me either!""",person see thing other person see say mother think tell see believe 
19,"""Oh, mother, mother!"" cried Curdie, bursting into tears; ""I don't deserve that, surely!""",mother mother cry burst tear deserve 
20,"""But what I am going to tell you is very strange,"" persisted his mother; ""and if having heard it, you were to say I must have been dreaming, I don't know that I should have any right to be vexed with you, though I know at least that I was not asleep.""",go tell strange persist mother hear say dreaming know have right vex know least asleep 
21,"""Do tell me, mother. Perhaps it will help me to think better of the princess.""",tell mother help think good princess 
22,"""That's why I am tempted to tell you,"" replied his mother. ""But first, I may as well mention, that according to old whispers, there is something more than common about the king's family; and the queen was of the same blood, for they were cousins of some degree. There were strange stories told concerning them--all good stories--but strange, very strange. What they were I cannot tell, for I only remember the faces of my grandmother and my mother as they talked together about them. There was wonder and awe--not fear, in their eyes, and they whispered, and never spoke aloud. But what I saw myself, was this: Your father was going to work in the mine, one night, and I had been down with his supper. It was soon after we were married, and not very long before you were born. He came with me to the mouth of the mine, and left me to go home alone, for I knew the way almost as well as the floor of our own cottage. It was pretty dark, and in some parts of the road where the rocks overhung, nearly quite dark. But I got along perfectly well, never thinking of being afraid, until I reached a spot you know well enough, Curdie, where the path has to make a sharp turn out of the way of a great rock on the left-hand side. When I got there, I was suddenly surrounded by about half-a-dozen of the cobs, the first I had ever seen, although I had heard tell of them often enough. One of them blocked up the path, and they all began tormenting and teasing me in a way it makes me shudder to think of even now.""",tempt tell reply mother mention accord old whisper be more common king family queen same blood cousin degree be strange story tell concern good story strange strange tell remember face grandmother mother talk be wonder awe fear eye whisper speak see father go work night supper married bear come mouth leave go know way floor own cottage dark part road rock overh dark get think afraid reach spot know path have make sharp turn way great rock left hand side get surround half cob first see hear tell block path begin torment tease way make shudder think

24,"The mother gave a funny little smile, and went on.",mother give funny little smile go 
25,"""They had some of their horrible creatures with them too, and I must confess I was dreadfully frightened. They had torn my clothes very much, and I was afraid they were going to tear myself to pieces, when suddenly a great white soft light shone upon me. I looked up. A broad ray, like a shining road, came down from a large globe of silvery light, not very high up, indeed not quite so high as the horizon--so it could not have been a new star or another moon or anything of that sort. The cobs dropped persecuting me, and looked dazed, and I thought they were going to run away, but presently they began again. The same moment, however, down the path from the globe of light came a bird, shining like silver in the sun. It gave a few rapid flaps first, and then, with its wings straight out, shot sliding down the slope of the light. It looked to me just like a white pigeon. But whatever it was, when the cobs caught sight of it coming straight down upon them, they took to their heels and scampered away across the mountain, leaving me safe, only much frightened. As soon as it had sent them off, the bird went gliding again up the light, and just at the moment it reached the globe, the light disappeared, just the same as if a shutter had been closed over a window, and I saw it no more. But I had no more trouble with the cobs that night, or at any time afterward.""",have horrible creature confess frighten tear clothes afraid go tear piece great white soft light shine look broad ray shine road come large globe silvery light high high horizon new star moon sort cob drop persecute look dazed think go run begin same moment path globe light come bird shine silver sun give few rapid flap wing shoot slide slope light look white pigeon cob catch sight come take heel scamper mountain leave safe frighten send bird go glide light moment reach globe light disappear same shutter close window see more have more trouble cob night time

29,"""You don't think I'm doubting my own mother!"" cried Curdie.",think doub own mother cry 
30,"""There are other people in the world quite as well worth believing as your own mother,"" said his mother. ""I don't know that she's so much the fitter to be believed that she happens to be _your_ mother, Mr. Curdie. There are mothers far more likely to tell lies than that little girl I saw talking to the primroses a few weeks ago. If she were to lie I should begin to doubt my own word.""",be other person world worth believe own mother say mother know much fitter believe happen mother be mother likely tell lie little girl see talk primrose few week lie begin doubt own word 
31,"""But princesses _have_ told lies as well as other people,"" said Curdie.",princess tell lie other person say 
32,"""Yes, but not princesses like that child. She's a good girl, I am certain, and that's more than being a princess. Depend upon it you will have to be sorry for behaving so to her, Curdie. You ought at least to have held your tongue.""",princess child good girl certain more princess depend have sorry behave least hold tongue 
33,"""I am sorry now,"" answered Curdie.",sorry answer 
34,"""You ought to go and tell her so, then.""",go tell 
35,"""I don't see how I could manage that. They wouldn't let a miner boy like me have a word with her alone; and I couldn't tell her before that nurse of hers. She'd be asking ever so many questions, and I don't know how many of them the little princess would like me to answer. She told me that Lootie didn't know anything about her coming to get me out of the mountain. I am certain she would have prevented her somehow if she had known it. But I may have a chance before long, and meantime I must try to do something for her. I think, father, I have got on the track at last.""",see manage let miner boy have word tell nurse ask many question know many little princess like answer tell know come get mountain certain prevent know have chance long try do think father get track last

38,"""Impossible, my boy, without a chart, or at least a compass,"" returned his father.",impossible boy chart least compass return father 
39,"""Well, I think I have nearly discovered in what direction the cobs are mining. If I am right, I know something else that I can put to it, and then one and one will make three.""",think discover direction cob mining right know else put make 
40,"""They very often do, Curdie, as we miners ought to be well aware. Now tell us, my boy, what the two things are, and see whether we guess at the same third as you.""",do miner aware tell boy thing see guess same third 
41,"""I don't see what that has to do with the princess,"" interposed his mother.",see have do princess interpose mother 
42,"""I will soon let you see that, mother. Perhaps you may think me foolish, but until I am sure there is nothing in my present fancy, I am more determined than ever to go on with my observations. Just as we came to the channel by which we got out, I heard the miners at work somewhere near--I think down below us. Now since I began to watch them, they have mined a good half mile, in a straight line; and so far as I am aware, they are working in no other part of the mountain. But I never could tell in what direction they were going. When we came out in the king's garden, however, I thought at once whether it was possible they were working toward the king's house; and what I want to do to-night is to make sure whether they are or not. I will take a light with me--""",let see mother think foolish sure be present fancy determined go observation come channel get hear miner work think begin watch mine good half mile straight line aware work other part mountain tell direction go come king garden think possible work king house want do night make sure take light 
43,"""Oh, Curdie,"" cried his mother, ""then they will see you.""",cry mother see 
44,"""I'm no more afraid of them now than I was before,"" rejoined Curdie,--""now that I've got this precious shoe. They can't make another such in a hurry, and one bare foot will do for my purpose. Woman as she may be, I won't spare her next time. But I shall be careful with my light, for I don't want them to see me. I won't stick it in my hat.""",afraid rejoin get precious shoe make such hurry bare foot do purpose woman spare next time careful light want see stick hat 
45,"""Go on, then, and tell us what you mean to do.""",go tell mean do 
46,"""I mean to take a bit of paper with me and a pencil, and go in at the mouth of the stream by which we came out. I shall mark on the paper as near as I can the angle of every turning I take until I find the cobs at work, and so get a good idea in what direction they are going. If it should prove to be nearly parallel with the stream, I shall know it is toward the king's house they are working.""",mean take bit paper pencil go mouth stream come mark paper angle turning take find cob work get good idea direction go prove parallel stream know king house work 
47,"""And what if you should. How much wiser will you be then?""",wise 
48,"""Wait a minute, mother, dear. I told you that when I came upon the royal family in the cave, they were talking of their prince--Harelip, they called him--marrying a sun-woman--that means one of us--one with toes to her feet. Now in the speech one of them made that night at their great gathering, of which I heard only a part, he said that peace would be secured for a generation at least by the pledge the prince would hold for the good behavior of _her_ relatives: that's what he said, and he must have meant the sun-woman the prince was to marry. I am quite sure the king is much too proud to wish his son to marry any but a princess, and much too knowing to fancy that his having a peasant woman for a wife would be of any material advantage to them.""",wait minute mother dear tell come royal family cave talk prince call marry sun -woman mean toe foot speech make night great gathering hear part say peace secure generation least pledge prince hold good behavior relative say mean sun -woman prince marry sure king proud wish son marry princess know fancy have peasant woman wife material advantage

51,"""Yes; but they think so much of themselves!"" said his mother. ""Small creatures always do. The bantam is the proudest cock in my little yard.""",think much say mother small creature bantam proud cock little yard 
52,"""And I fancy,"" said Curdie, ""if they once get her, they would tell the king they would kill her except, he consented to the marriage.""",fancy say get tell king kill consent marriage 
53,"""They might say so,"" said his father, ""but they wouldn't kill her; they would keep her alive for the sake of the hold it gave them over our king. Whatever he did to them, they would threaten to do the same to the princess.""",say say father kill keep alive sake hold give king do threaten do same princess 
54,"""And they are bad enough to torment her just for their own amusement--I know that,"" said his mother.",bad torment own amusement know say mother 
55,"""Anyhow, I will keep a watch on them, and see what they are up to,"" said Curdie. ""It's too horrible to think of. I daren't let myself do it. But they sha'n't have her--at least if I can help it. So, mother dear--my clue is all right--will you get me a bit of paper and a pencil and a lump of pease-pudding, and I will set out at once. I saw a place where I can climb over the wall of the garden quite easily.""",keep watch see say horrible think let do have least help mother dear clue right get bit paper pencil lump pease pudding set see place climb wall garden

57,"""That I will. I don't want them to know anything about it. They would spoil it all. The cobs would only try some other plan--they are such obstinate creatures! I shall take good care, mother. They won't kill and eat me either, if they should come upon me. So you needn't mind them.""",want know spoil cob try other plan such obstinate creature take good care mother kill eat come mind 
58,"His mother got him what he asked for, and Curdie set out. Close beside the door by which the princess left the garden for the mountain, stood a great rock, and by climbing it Curdie got over the wall. He tied his clue to a stone just inside the channel of the stream, and took his pickaxe with him. He had not gone far before he encountered a horrid creature coming toward the mouth. The spot was too narrow for two of almost any size or shape, and besides Curdie had no wish to let the creature pass. Not being able to use his pickaxe, however, he had a severe struggle with him, and it was only after receiving many bites, some of them bad, that he succeeded in killing him with his pocket knife. Having dragged him out, he made haste to get in again before another should stop up the way.",mother get ask set close door princess leave garden mountain stand great rock climb get wall tie clue stone channel stream take pickaxe go encounter horrid creature come mouth spot narrow size shape have wish let creature pass able use pickaxe have severe struggle receive many bite bad succeed kill pocket knife drag make haste get stop way 
59,"I need not follow him farther in this night's adventures. He returned to his breakfast, satisfied that the goblins were mining in the direction of the palace--on so low a level that their intention must, he thought, be to burrow under the walls of the king's house, and rise up inside it--in order, he fully believed, to lay hands on the little princess, and carry her off for a wife to their horrid Harelip.",follow night adventure return breakfast satisfied goblin mining direction palace low level intention think burrow wall king house rise order believe lay hand little princess carry wife horrid
