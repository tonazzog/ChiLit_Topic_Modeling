2,"But although they resolved as stated in the last chapter, nothing was done.  Finally, one morning at sunrise, as they were looking round with the telescope, close to the turtle-pond, Masterman Ready said to Mr Seagrave, ""Indeed, sir, we must no longer remain in this state of idleness; I have been thinking a great deal of our present position and prospects; as to the vessel coming back, we must, at present, give up all hopes of it.  I only wish that we were quite as sure that we shall not have a visit from the savages: that is my great fear, and it really haunts me; the idea of our being surprised some night, and Mrs Seagrave and the dear children, perhaps, murdered in their beds, is awful to reflect upon.""",resolve state last chapter do morning sunrise look telescope close turtle pond say sir remain state idleness think great deal present position prospect vessel come present give hope wish sure have visit savage great fear haunt idea surprise night dear child murder bed awful reflect 
3,"""God help us!"" exclaimed Mr Seagrave, covering up his face.",help exclaim cover face 
4,"""God will help us, Mr Seagrave, but at the same time it is necessary that we should help ourselves; he will give his blessing to our exertions, but we cannot expect that miracles will be performed for us; and if we remain as we now are, inactive, and taking no steps to meet the danger which threatens us, we cannot expect the divine assistance. We have had a heavy shock, but it is now time that we recover from it, and put our own shoulders to the wheel.""",help same time necessary help give blessing exertion expect miracle perform remain inactive take step meet danger threaten expect divine assistance have heavy shock time recover put own shoulder wheel 
5,"""I agree with you, Ready,"" replied William; ""indeed I have been thinking the same thing for many days past.""",agree ready reply think same thing many day past 
6,"""We have all been thinking of it, I believe,"" said Mr Seagrave; ""I'm sure I have lain awake night after night, considering our position and what we ought to do, but I have never been able to come to any satisfactory resolution.""",think believe say sure lain awake night night consider position do able come satisfactory resolution 
7,"""No more have I till last night, Mr Seagrave, but I think that I have now something to propose which, perhaps, will meet with your approval,"" replied Ready; ""so now, sir, suppose we hold another council, and come to a decision.""",last night think propose meet approval reply ready sir suppose hold council come decision 
8,"""I am most willing, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave, sitting down upon a rock; ""and as you are the oldest, and moreover the best adviser of the three, we will first hear what you have to propose.""",willing ready say sit rock old good adviser hear have propose 
9,"""Well then, Mr Seagrave, it appears to me that it will not do to remain in the house, for we may, as I have said, be surprised by the savages at any hour in the night, and we have no means of defence against numbers.""",appear do remain house say surprise savage hour night have means defence number 
10,"""I feel that, and have felt it for some time,"" replied Mr Seagrave. ""What shall we do, then; shall we return to the cove?""",feel feel time reply do return cove 
11,"""I should think not, sir,"" said Ready; ""what I propose is this: we have made a discovery on the south of the island, which is of great importance to us; not that I consider the fruit and other plants of any great value, as they will only serve to increase our luxuries, if I may so call them, during the summer season.  One great advantage to us, is the feed which we have found for our live stock, and the fodder for them during the rainy season; but principally, the patch of yams, which will afford us food during the winter.  They are of great importance to us, and we cannot too soon protect them from the pigs, which will certainly root them all up, if we do not prevent them.  Now, sir, you know what we had arranged to do, but which we have not done; I think the cocoa-nut rails will take too much time, and it will be sufficient to make a ditch and hedge round the yams; but it will be very tedious if we are to go backwards and forwards to do the work, and Mrs Seagrave and the children will be left alone.  I therefore propose, as the weather is now set in fair, and will remain so for months, that we pitch our tents on that part of the island, and remove the whole family there; we shall soon be very comfortable, and at all events much safer there than if we remain here, without any defence.""",think sir say ready propose make discovery south island great importance consider fruit other plant great value serve increase luxury call summer season great advantage feed find live stock fodder rainy season patch yam afford food winter great importance protect pig root prevent sir know arrange do do think cocoa nut rail take much time sufficient make ditch hedge yam tedious go forward do work child leave alone propose weather set fair remain month pitch tent part island remove whole family comfortable event safe remain defence 
12,"""It is an excellent plan, Ready; we shall, as you say, be removed from danger for the time, and when there, we may consider what we had best do by and by.""",excellent plan ready say remove danger time consider have good do 
13,"""Yes, sir.  Those women may not have gained the other island, it is true, for they had the wind right against them for several days after they went away in the canoe, and, moreover, the current sets strong this way; but if they have, we must expect that the savages will pay us a visit; they will, of course, come direct to the house, if they do come.""",sir woman gain other island true have wind several day go canoe current set strong way have expect savage pay visit course come direct house come 
14,"""But, Ready, you don't mean to say that we are to leave this side of the island altogether, and all our comfortable arrangements?"" said William.",ready mean say leave side island comfortable arrangement say 
15,"""No, William, not altogether; for now I come to the second part of my proposition.  As soon as we have done our work at the yam plantation, and made everything as comfortable there as we can, I think we may then leave Mrs Seagrave and the children in the tents, and work here.  As we before agreed, let us abandon the house in which we live at present, and fit out the outhouse which is concealed in the cocoa-nut grove, as a dwelling-house, and fortify it so as to be secure against any sudden attack of the savages: for, return here we must, to live, as we cannot remain in the tents after the rainy season sets in.""",come second part proposition do work yam plantation make comfortable think leave child tent work agree let abandon house live present fit outhouse conceal cocoa nut grove dwelling house fortify secure sudden attack savage return live remain tent rainy season set 
16,"""How do you propose to fortify it, Ready?"" said Mr Seagrave; ""I hardly know.""",propose fortify ready say know 
17,"""That I will explain to you by and by, sir.  Then, if the savages come here, at all events we should be able to defend ourselves with fire-arms; one man behind a stockade is better than twenty who have no other arms but spears and clubs; and we may, with the help of God, beat them off.""",explain sir savage come event able defend fire arm man stockade good have other arm spear club help beat 
18,"""I think your plan is excellent, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""and that the sooner we begin, the better.""",think plan excellent ready say begin good 
19,"""That there is no doubt of, sir.  Now, the first job is for William and me to try for the passage through this side of the reef with the boat, and then we will look for the little harbour which we discovered; as soon as that is done, we will return and take the tents and all we require round in the boat, and when we have pitched the tents and all is arranged, Mrs Seagrave and the children can walk through the wood with us, and take possession.""",be doubt sir first job try passage side reef boat look little harbour discover do return take tent require boat pitch tent arrange child walk wood take possession 
20,"""Let us not lose an hour, Ready; we have lost too much time already,"" replied Mr Seagrave.  ""What shall we do to-day?""",let lose hour ready lose much time reply do day 
21,"""After breakfast, William and I will take the boat, and try for the passage.  You can remain here, packing up the tents and such articles as must first be carried round.  We shall be back, I hope, by dinner-time.""",breakfast take boat try passage remain pack tent such article carry hope dinner time 
22,"They then rose, and walked towards the house; all felt relieved in their minds, after they had made this arrangement, satisfied that they would be using all human endeavours to ward off the danger which threatened them, and might then put their confidence in that Providence who would, if he thought fit, protect them in their need.",rise walk house feel relieve mind make arrangement satisfy use human endeavour ward danger threaten put confidence think fit protect need
