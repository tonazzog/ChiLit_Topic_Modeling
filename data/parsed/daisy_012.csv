4," Hopes that Dr. May would ever have his mind free, seemed as fallacious as mamma’s old promise to Margaret, to make doll’s clothes for her whenever there should be no live dolls to be worked for in the nursery.",hope have mind free seem fallacious mamma old promise make doll clothes be live doll work nursery 
5,"Richard and Ethel themselves had their thoughts otherwise engrossed. The last week before the holidays was an important one. There was an examination, by which the standing of the boys in the school was determined, and this time it was of more than ordinary importance, as the Randall scholarship of £100 a year for three years would be open in the summer to the competition of the first six boys. Richard had never come within six of the top, but had been past at every examination by younger boys, till his father could bear it no longer; and now Norman was too young to be likely to have much chance of being of the number. There were eight decidedly his seniors, and Harvey Anderson, a small, quick-witted boy, half a year older, who had entered school at the same time, and had always been one step below him, had, in the last three months, gained fast upon him.",have thought engross last week holiday important one be examination standing boy school determine time more ordinary importance scholarship year year open summer competition first boy come top past examination young boy father bear young likely have much chance number be senior small quick witted boy year old enter school same time step last month gain 
6,"Harry, however, meant Norman to be one of the six, and declared all the fellows thought he would be, except Andersen’s party. Mr. Wilmot, in a call on Ethel and Flora, told them that he thought their brother had a fair chance, but he feared he was over-working himself, and should tell the doctor so, whenever he could catch him; but this was difficult, as there was a great deal of illness just then, and he was less at home than usual.",mean declare fellow think party call tell think brother have fair chance fear work tell doctor catch difficult be great deal illness less home usual 
7,"All this excited the home party, but Norman only seemed annoyed by talk about it, and though always with a book in his hand, was so dreamy and listless, that Flora declared that there was no fear of his doing too much--she thought he would fail for want of trying.",excite home party seem annoy talk book hand dreamy listless declare be fear do much think fail want try

9,"The great day was the 20th of December, and Ethel ran out, as the boys went to school, to judge of Norman’s looks, which were not promising. “No wonder,” said Harry, since he had stayed up doing Euripides and Cicero the whole length of a candle that had been new at bedtime. “But never mind, Ethel, if he only beats Anderson, I don’t care for anything else.”",great day 20th run boy go school judge look promising wonder say stay do whole length candle new bedtime mind beat care else

12,"“He’ll light up at the last moment,” said Ethel, consolingly, to Harry; but she was very uneasy herself, for she had set her heart on his surpassing Harvey Anderson. No more was heard all day. Tom went at dinner-time to see if he could pick up any news; but he was shy, or was too late, and gained no intelligence. Dr. May and Richard talked of going to hear the speeches and viva voce examination in the afternoon--objects of great interest to all Stoneborough men--but just as they came home from a long day’s work, Dr. May was summoned to the next town, by an electric telegraph, and, as it was to a bad case, he did not expect to be at home till the mail-train came in at one o’clock at night. Richard begged to go with him, and he consented, unwillingly, to please Margaret, who could not bear to think of his “fending for himself” in the dark on the rail-road.",light last moment say uneasy set heart surpass more hear day go dinner time see pick news shy late gain intelligence talk go hear speech voce examination afternoon object great interest man come long day work summon next town electric telegraph bad case expect home mail train come o'clock night begg go consent please bear think fending dark rail road 
13,"Very long did the evening seem to the listening sisters. Eight, and no tidings; nine, the boys not come; Tom obliged to go to bed by sheer sleepiness, and Ethel unable to sit still, and causing Flora demurely to wonder at her fidgeting so much, it would be so much better to fix her attention to some employment; while Margaret owned that Flora was right, but watched, and started at each sound, almost as anxiously as Ethel.",evening seem listening sister tiding boy come oblige go bed sheer sleepiness unable sit cause wonder fidget good fix attention employment own right watch start sound 
14,"It was ten, when there was a sharp pull at the bell, and down flew the sisters; but old James was beforehand, and Harry was exclaiming, “Dux! James, he is Dux! Hurrah! Flossy, Ethel, Mary! There stands the Dux of Stoneborough! Where’s papa?”",be sharp pull bell fly sister old exclaim stand papa 
15,"“Sent for to Whitford. But oh! Norman, Dux! Is he really?”",send 
16,"“To be sure, but I must tell Margaret,” and up he rushed, shouted the news to her, but could not stay for congratulation; broke Tom’s slumber by roaring it in his ear, and dashed into the nursery, where nurse for once forgave him for waking the baby. Norman, meanwhile, followed his eager sisters into the drawing-room, putting up his hand as if the light dazzled him, and looking, by no means, as it he had just achieved triumphant success.",sure tell rush shout news stay congratulation break slumber roar ear dash nursery nurse forgive wake baby follow eager sister draw room put hand light dazzle look means achieve triumphant success

22,“Yes;” and the pain was evidently severe.,pain severe 
23,"“Won’t you come to Margaret?” said Ethel, knowing what was the greater suffering; but he did not move, and they forbore to torment him with questions. The next moment Harry came down in an ecstacy, bringing in, from the hall, Norman’s beautiful prize books, and showing off their Latin inscription.",come say know great suffering move forbore torment question next moment come ecstacy bring hall beautiful prize book show latin inscription 
24,"“Ah!” said he, looking at his brother, “he is regularly done for. He ought to turn in at once. That Everard is a famous fellow for an examiner. He said he never had seen such a copy of verses sent up by a school-boy, and could hardly believe June was barely sixteen. Old Hoxton says he is the youngest Dux they have had these fifty years that he has known the school, and Mr. Wilmot said ‘twas the most creditable examination he had ever known, and that I might tell papa so. What did possess that ridiculous old landlubber at Whitford, to go and get on the sick-list on this, of all the nights of the year?

29,"“It was the verses that did it,” said Harry; “they had an hour to do Themistocles on the hearth of Admetus, and there he beat them all to shivers. ‘Twas all done smack, smooth, without a scratch, in Alcaics, and Cheviot heard Wilmot saying, ‘twas no mere task, but had poetry, and all that sort of thing in it. But I don’t know whether that would have done, if he had not come out so strong in the recitation; they put him on in Priam’s speech to Achilles, and he said it--Oh it was too bad papa did not hear him! Every one held their breath and listened.”",verse do say have hour do hearth beat shiver twa do smack smooth scratch hear say mere task have poetry sort thing know do come strong recitation put speech say bad papa hear one hold breath listen 
30,"“How you do go on!” muttered Norman; but no one heeded, and Harry continued. “He construed a chorus in Sophocles without a blunder, but what did the business was this, I believe. They asked all manner of out-of-the-way questions--history and geography, what no one expected, and the fellows who read nothing they can help, were thoroughly posed. Forder had not a word to say, and the others were worse, for Cheviot thought Queen Elizabeth’s Earl of Leicester was Simon de Montfort; and didn’t know when that battle was, beginning with an E.--was it Evesham, or Edgehill?”",go mutter heed continue construe chorus blunder business believe ask manner way question history geography expect fellow read help pose have word say other bad think know battle begin

For Dr. Hoxton called me--they shook hands with me, and wished me joy of it, and told me to tell my father how well Norman had done.”",one know say sixth form papa one ask wish call shake hand wish joy tell tell father do

36,“Oh! Harry! why didn’t you tell us?”,tell 
37,"“Oh! that is grand!” and, as the two elder girls made this exclamation, Mary proceeded to a rapturous embrace. “Get along, Mary, you are throttling one. Mr. Everard inquired for my father and Margaret, and said he’d call to-morrow, and Hoxton and Wilmot kept on wishing he was there.”",grand elder girl make exclamation proceed rapturous embrace get throttle inquire father say call keep wish

39,"“Well, Cheviot wanted me to send up for him at dinner-time,” said Harry; “for as soon as we sat down in the hall, June turned off giddy, and could not stay, and looked so horrid, we thought it was all over with him, and he would not be able to go up at all.”",want send dinner time say sit hall turn giddy stay look horrid think able go

44,"After telling it once in her room, once in the nursery, in whispers like gusts of wind, and once in the pantry, Harry employed himself in writing--“Norman is Dux!” in immense letters, on pieces of paper, which he disposed all over the house, to meet the eyes of his father and Richard on their return.",tell room nursery whisper gust wind pantry employ writing immense letter piece paper dispose house meet eye father return

52,"“Yes,” said Ethel, mournfully; “it was a great shame of me! How could I? Dear Norman! how he does grieve--what love his must have been! But yet, Margaret,” she said impatiently, and the hot tears breaking out, “I cannot--cannot bear it! To have him not caring one bit for all of us! I want him to triumph! I can’t without him!”",say great shame dear grieve love say hot tear break bear have care bit want triumph

54,"“It is very tiresome,” said Ethel, nearly convinced, but in a slightly petulant voice.",tiresome say convinced petulant voice 
55,"“And does not one love those two dear boys to-night!” said Margaret. “Norman not able to rejoice in his victory without her, and Harry in such an ecstacy with Norman’s honours. I don’t think I ever was so fond of my two brothers.”",love dear boy night say able rejoice victory ecstacy honour think fond brother

57,"Nothing could be better news for Dr. May, who had never lost a grain of the ancient school-party-loyalty that is part of the nature of the English gentleman. He was a thorough Stoneborough boy, had followed the politics of the Whichcote foundation year by year all his life, and perhaps, in his heart, regarded no honour as more to be prized than that of Dux and Randall scholar. Harry was in his room the next morning as soon as ever he was stirring, a welcome guest--teased a little at first, by his pretending to take it all as a sailor’s prank to hoax him and Richard, and then free to pour out to delighted ears the whole history of the examination, and of every one’s congratulations.",good news lose grain ancient school party loyalty part nature english gentleman thorough boy follow politics foundation year year life heart regard honour more prize scholar room next morning stir welcome guest tease little first pretend take sailor prank hoax free pour delight ear whole history examination one congratulation 
58,"Norman himself was asleep when Harry went to give this narration. He came down late, and his father rose to meet him as he entered. “My boy,”  he said, “I had not expected this of you. Well done, Norman!” and the whole tone and gesture had a heartfelt approval and joy in them, that Ethel knew her brother was deeply thrilled by, for his colour deepened, and his lips quivered into something like a smile, though he did not lift his eyes.",asleep go give narration come father rise meet enter boy say expect do whole tone gesture have heartfelt approval joy know brother thrill colour deepen lip quiver smile lift eye 
59,"Then came Richard’s warm greeting and congratulation, he, too, showing himself as delighted as if the honours were his own; and then Dr. May again, in lively tones, like old times, laughing at Norman for sleeping late, and still not looking well awake, asking him if he was quite sure it was not all a dream.",come warm greeting congratulation show delight honour own lively tone old time laugh sleep look awake ask sure dream

63," There had not been such a merry breakfast for months. There was the old confusion of voices; the boys, Richard, and the doctor had much to talk over of the school doings of this week, and there was nearly as much laughing as in days past. Ethel wondered whether any one but herself observed that the voice most seldom heard was Norman’s.",be merry breakfast month be old confusion voice boy doctor have much talk school doing week be much laugh day past wonder one observe voice hear 
64,"The promised call was made by Dr. Hoxton, and Mr. Everard, an old friend, and after their departure Dr. May came to Margaret’s room with fresh accounts, corroborating what Harry had said of the clear knowledge and brilliant talent that Norman had displayed, to a degree that surprised his masters, almost as much as the examiners. The copy of verses Dr. May brought with him, and construed them to Margaret, commenting all the way on their ease, and the fullness of thought, certainly remarkable in a boy of sixteen.",promise call make old friend departure come room fresh account corroborate say clear knowledge brilliant talent display degree surprise master much examiner copy verse bring construe comment way ease fullness thought remarkable boy 
65,"They were then resigned to Ethel’s keeping, and she could not help imparting her admiration to their author, with some apology for vexing him again.",resign keep help impart admiration author apology vex 
66,"“I don’t want to be cross,” said Norman, whom these words roused to a sense that he had been churlish last night; “but I cannot help it. I wish people would not make such a fuss about it.”",want cross say word rouse sense churlish last night help wish person make fuss

72,"“What comfort can it be? I’ve not been the smallest use all this time. When he was ill, I left him to Ernescliffe, and lay on the floor like an ass; and if he were to ask me to touch his arm, I should be as bad again. A fine thing for me to have talked all that arrogant stuff about Richard! I hate the thought of it; and, as if to make arrows and barbs of it, here’s Richard making as much of this as if it was a double first class!

77,"“Oh, Norman!”",

There was nothing I really knew better, except those historical questions that no one reckoned on; and not living at home with their sisters and books, they had no such chance, and it is very hard on them, and I don’t like it.”",thing feel earn have good scholar be know good historical question reckon live home sister book have such chance hard like

There were lots of places in construing, where I should have broken down if I had happened to be set on in them; it was only a wonder I did not in that chorus, for I had only looked at it twice; but Everard asked me nothing but what I knew; and now and then I get into a funny state, when nothing is too hard for me, and that was how it was yesterday evening.

82,"To which he answered, with displeasure, that he was as well as possible, ordered her not to go and make any more fuss, and left her hastily. She was unhappy, and far from satisfied; she had never known his temper so much affected, and was much puzzled; but she was too much afraid of vexing him, to impart her perplexity even to Margaret. However, the next day, Sunday, as she was reading to Margaret after church, her father came in, and the first thing he said was, “I want to know what you think of Norman.”",answer displeasure possible order go make more fuss leave unhappy satisfied know temper affect puzzled afraid vex impart perplexity next day read church father come first thing say want know think

86,"“Yes, both. I fancied it was only his rapid growth, and the excitement of this examination, and that it would go off, but I think there’s more amiss. He was lounging about doing nothing, when the girls were gone to school after dinner, and I asked him to walk down with me to the Almshouses. He did not seem very willing, but he went, and presently, as I had hold of his arm, I felt him shivering, and saw him turn as pale as a sheet. As soon as I noticed it, he flushed crimson, and would not hear of turning back, stoutly protesting he was quite well, but I saw his hand was quivering even when I got into church.
