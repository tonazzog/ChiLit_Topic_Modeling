2,"Ready arrived at the cove, and proceeded to the tents, where he found the whole party listening to William, who was detailing what had been done.  The arrangements for the next day were made as soon as Ready joined them.  They then separated for the night, but Ready and William remained until it was dark, to catch the fowls and tie their legs, ready for their being put in the boat the next morning.  At daylight all were summoned to dress themselves as soon as possible, as Ready wanted to take down the tent in which Mrs Seagrave and the children had slept. For, with the exception of Tommy, the others had slept upon some canvas, which they had spread out under the cocoa-nut trees.  As soon as Mrs Seagrave was dressed, the tent was taken down, and, with all the bedding, put into the boat.  Then, when they had breakfasted, the plates, knives and forks, and some other necessaries, were also put in; Ready laid the fowls on the top of all, and set off by himself for their new location.",ready arrive cove proceed tent find whole party listen detail do arrangement next day make ready join separate night ready remain dark catch fowl tie leg ready put boat next morning daylight summon dress possible ready want take tent child sleep exception other sleep canvas spread cocoa nut tree dress tent take bedding put boat breakfast plate knife fork other necessary put ready lay fowl top set new location 
3,"After he was gone, the rest of the party prepared for their journey through the cocoa-nut grove.  William led the way, with the three dogs close to his heels, Mr Seagrave with the baby in his arms, Juno with little Caroline, and Mrs Seagrave with Master Tommy holding her hand. They cast a last look round at the cove, and the fragments of the wreck and cargo, strewed about in every direction, and then turned into the wood.  Ready arrived at the point, and was again on shore in less than two hours after he had set off.  As soon as the boat was safe in, he did not wait to land his cargo, but going up to the turtle which he had turned the day before, he killed it, and cleaned it on the beach.  He then went to where they had built up the fireplace with stones, made a fire, filled the iron saucepan full of water, and set it on to boil; he then cut up a portion of the turtle, and put it into the pot, with some slices of salt pork, covered it up, and left it to boil; and having hung up the rest of the turtle in the shade, he went back to the beach to unload the boat.  He released the poor fowls, and they were soon busy seeking for food.",gone rest party prepare journey cocoa nut grove lead way dog close heel baby arm little hold hand cast last look cove fragment wreck cargo strew direction turn wood ready arrive point shore less hour set boat safe wait land cargo go turtle turn day kill clean beach go build fireplace stone make fire fill iron saucepan full water set boil cut portion turtle put pot slice salt pork cover leave boil hang rest turtle shade go beach unload boat release poor fowl busy seek food

7,"In six or seven minutes afterwards the party made their appearance, very hot and very fatigued.  It appeared that poor little Caroline had been tired out, and Juno had to carry her; then Mrs Seagrave complained of fatigue, and they had to rest a quarter of an hour; then Tommy, who refused to remain with his mamma, and had been running backwards and forwards from one to the other, had declared that he was tired, and that someone must carry him; but there was no one to carry him, so he began to cry until they stopped for another quarter of an hour till he was rested; then as soon as they went on again he again complained of being tired.  William then carried him pickaback for some time, and in so doing he missed the blaze-cut on the trees, and it was a long while before he could find it again; then baby became hungry, and he cried, and little Caroline was frightened at being so long in the wood, and she cried.  But finally they got on better, and arrived at last so warm and exhausted, that Mrs Seagrave went into the tent with the children to repose a little, before she could even look at the place which was to be their future residence.",minute party make appearance hot fatigued appear poor little tired have carry complain fatigue have rest quarter hour refuse remain mamma run forward other declare tired carry be carry begin cry stop quarter hour rest go complain tired carry pickaback time do miss blaze cut tree long while find baby become hungry cry little frighten long wood cry get good arrive last warm exhausted go tent child repose little look place future residence

9,"""I am glad that you are here, sir,"" replied Ready, ""it is a weight off my mind; now you will get on better.

As soon as they had finished, Mrs Seagrave remained with the children; and Ready and Mr Seagrave, assisted by Juno and William, got the second tent up, and everything ready for the night.  They then all assembled, and returned thanks to God for their having gained their new abode; and, tired out with the fatigue of the day, were soon fast asleep.",soup pronounce excellent finish remain child ready assist get second tent ready night assemble return thanks gain new abode tired fatigue day fast asleep
