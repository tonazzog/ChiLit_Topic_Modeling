2," HE had all at once remembered the resolution of the goblins to carry out their second plan upon the failure of the first. No doubt they were already busy, and the mine was therefore in the greatest danger of being flooded and rendered useless--not to speak of the lives of the miners.",remember resolution goblin carry second plan failure first doubt busy great danger flood render useless speak life miner 
3,"When he reached the mouth of the mine, after rousing all the miners within reach, he found his father and a good many more just entering. They all hurried to the gang by which he had found a way into the goblin country. There the foresight of Peter had already collected a great many blocks of stone, with cement, ready for building up the weak place--well enough known to the goblins. Although there was not room for more than two to be actually building at once, they managed, by setting all the rest to work in preparing the cement, and passing the stones, to finish in the course of the day a huge buttress filling the whole gang, and supported everywhere by the live rock. Before the hour when they usually dropped work, they were satisfied that the mine was secure.",reach mouth rouse miner reach find father good many enter hurry gang find way goblin country foresight collect great many block stone cement ready build weak place know goblin be room more build manage set rest work prepare cement pass stone finish course day huge buttress fill whole gang support live rock hour drop work satisfy secure 
4,"They had heard goblin hammers and pickaxes busy all the time, and at length fancied they heard sounds of water they had never heard before. But that was otherwise accounted for when they left the mine; for they stepped out into a tremendous storm which was raging all over the mountain. The thunder was bellowing, and the lightning lancing out of a huge black cloud which lay above it, and hung down its edges of thick mist over its sides. The lightning was breaking out of the mountain, too, and flashing up into the cloud. From the state of the brooks, now swollen into raging torrents, it was evident that the storm had been storming all day.",hear goblin hammer pickaxe busy time length fancy hear sound water hear account leave step tremendous storm rage mountain thunder bellow lightning lance huge black cloud lay hang edge thick mist side lightning break mountain flash cloud state brook swollen rage torrent evident storm storm day 
5,"The wind was blowing as if it would blow him off the mountain, but, anxious about his mother and the princess, Curdie darted up through the thick of the tempest. Even if they had not set out before the storm came on, he did not judge them safe, for, in such a storm even their poor little house was in danger. Indeed he soon found that but for a huge rock against which it was built, and which protected it both from the blasts and the waters, it must have been swept if it was not blown away; for the two torrents into which this rock parted the rush of water behind it united again in front of the cottage--two roaring and dangerous streams, which his mother and the princess could not possibly have passed. It was with great difficulty that he forced his way through one of them, and up to the door.",wind blow blow mountain anxious mother princess dart thick tempest set storm come judge safe storm poor little house danger find huge rock build protect blast water sweep blow torrent rock part rush water unite front cottage roar dangerous stream mother princess pass great difficulty force way door 
6,"The moment his hand fell on the latch, through all the uproar of winds and waters came the joyous cry of the princess:--",moment hand fall latch uproar wind water come joyous cry princess

8,"She was sitting wrapped in blankets on the bed, his mother trying for the hundredth time to light the fire which had been drowned by the rain that came down the chimney. The clay floor was one mass of mud, and the whole place looked wretched. But the faces of the mother and the princess shone as if their troubles only made them merrier. Curdie laughed at sight of them.",sit wrap blanket bed mother try hundredth time light fire drown rain come chimney clay floor mass mud whole place look wretch face mother princess shine trouble make merrier laugh sight

12,"By the time Peter returned, the storm was nearly over, but the streams were so fierce and so swollen, that it was not only out of the question for the princess to go down the mountain, but most dangerous for Peter even or Curdie to make the attempt in the gathering darkness.",time return storm stream fierce swollen question princess go mountain dangerous make attempt gathering darkness 
13,"""They will be dreadfully frightened about you,"" said Peter to the princess, ""but we cannot help it. We must wait till the morning.""",frighten say princess help wait morning 
14,"With Curdie's help, the fire was lighted at last, and the mother set about making their supper; and after supper they all told the princess stories till she grew sleepy. Then Curdie's mother laid her in Curdie's bed, which was in a tiny little garret-room. As soon as she was in bed, through a little window low down in the roof she caught sight of her grandmother's lamp shining far away beneath, and she gazed at the beautiful silvery globe until she fell fast asleep.",help fire light last mother set make supper supper tell princess story grow sleepy mother lay bed tiny little garret room bed little window low roof catch sight grandmother lamp shine gaze beautiful silvery globe fall asleep
