2," Anthea woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in which she was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day without an umbrella. The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain, and were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and the rain went on just the same. The growling was the heavy regular breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still asleep. The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face from the wet corner of a bath-towel out of which her brother Robert was gently squeezing the water, to wake her up, as he now explained.",wake morning real sort dream walk zoological pour wet day umbrella animal seem unhappy rain growl awoke growling rain go same growling heavy regular breathing sister have slight cold asleep rain fall slow drop face wet corner bath towel brother squeez water wake explain

7,"""But that's what _I_ dreamed,"" said Robert; ""I was just going to tell you,--and we had the first wish directly it said so.

8,"""But _can_ different people all dream the same thing?"" said Anthea, sitting up in bed, ""because I dreamed all that as well as about the Zoo and the rain; and Baby didn't know us in my dream, and the servants shut us out of the house because the radiantness of our beauty was such a complete disguise, and""----",different person dream same thing say sit bed dream rain know dream servant shut house radiantness beauty complete disguise

Not if I know it!""",dream say little silly tell happen keen go brekker have wish make mind solid go want ask other agree peerless beauty child thank know 
16,"The other three dressed, with their mouths open. If all that dream about the Sand-fairy was real, this real dressing seemed very like a dream, the girls thought. Jane felt that Cyril was right, but Anthea was not sure, till after they had seen Martha and heard her full and plain reminders about their naughty conduct the day before. Then Anthea was sure.",other dress mouth open dream fairy real real dress seem dream girl think feel right sure see hear full plain reminder naughty conduct day sure

22,"""I expect they pretend they're their own babies, and that they're not servants at all, but married to noble dukes of high degree, and they say the babies are the little dukes and duchesses,"" Jane suggested dreamily, taking more marmalade.

26,So they did.,
27,"Martha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple, so tight in the chest that it made her stoop, and her blue hat with the pink cornflowers and white ribbon. She had a yellow-lace collar with a green bow. And the Lamb had indeed his very best cream-colored silk coat and hat. It was a smart party that the carrier's cart picked up at the Cross Roads.

30,"They had made a ring of stones round the place where the Sand-fairy had disappeared, so they easily found the spot. The sun was burning and bright, and the sky was deep blue--without a cloud. The sand was very hot to touch.",make ring stone place fairy disappear find spot sun burn bright sky deep blue cloud sand hot touch

43,"""Humph!"" said the Sand-fairy. (If you read this story aloud, please pronounce ""humph"" exactly as it is spelt, for that is how he said it.) ""Humph!

45,"""Is that the day's wish?"" said the Sand-fairy, yawning.",day wish say fairy yawning 
46,"Cyril muttered something about ""just like a girl,"" and the rest stood silent. If they said ""Yes,"" then good-bye to the other wishes they had decided to ask for. If they said ""No,"" it would be very rude, and they had all been taught manners, and had learned a little too, which is not at all the same thing. A sigh of relief broke from all lips when the Sand-fairy said--",mutter girl rest stand silent say good bye other wish decide ask say rude teach manners learn little same thing sigh relief break lip fairy say

48,"""We don't want you to put yourself out at all about _these_ things, we can manage them quite well ourselves,"" said Cyril eagerly; while the others looked guiltily at each other, and wished the Fairy would not keep all on about good tempers, but give them one good scolding if it wanted to, and then have done with it.",want put _these thing manage say other look other wish keep good temper give good scolding want do

62,"It made its skinny arms so long, and waved them so frighteningly, that the children ran as hard as they could towards the road by which carts used to come to the gravel-pits. Only Anthea had presence of mind enough to shout a timid ""Good-morning, I hope your whisker will be better to-morrow,"" as she ran.",make skinny arm wave child run road cart use come gravel pit have presence mind shout timid good morning hope whisker good run 
63,"On the road they turned and looked back, and they had to shut their eyes, and open them very slowly, a little bit at a time, because the sight was too dazzling for their eyes to be able to bear. It was something like trying to look at the sun at high noon on Midsummer Day. For the whole of the sand-pit was full, right up to the very top, with new shining gold pieces, and all the little bank-martins' little front doors were covered out of sight. Where the road for carts wound into the gravel-pit the gold lay in heaps like stones lie by the roadside, and a great bank of shining gold shelved down from where it lay flat and smooth between the tall sides of the gravel-pit. And all the gleaming heaps was minted gold. And on the sides and edges of these countless coins the mid-day sun shone and sparkled, and glowed and gleamed till the quarry looked like the mouth of a smelting furnace, or one of the fairy halls that you see sometimes in the sky at sunset.",road turn look have shut eye open little bit time sight dazzling eye able bear try look sun high noon whole sand pit full very top new shine gold piece little bank martin little front door cover sight road cart wind gravel pit gold lay heap stone lie roadside great bank shine gold shelve lay flat smooth tall side gravel pit gleam heap mint gold side edge countless coin mid -day sun shine sparkle glow gleam quarry look mouth smelting furnace fairy hall see sky sunset

65,"At last Robert stooped and picked up one of the loose coins from the edge of the heap by the cart-road, and looked at it. He looked on both sides. Then he said in a low voice, quite different to his own, ""It's not sovereigns.""",last stoop pick loose coin edge heap cart road look look side say low voice different own sovereign 
66,"""It's gold, anyway,"" said Cyril. And now they all began to talk at once. They all picked up the golden treasure by handfuls and let it run through their fingers like water, and the chink it made as it fell was wonderful music. At first they quite forgot to think of spending the money, it was so nice to play with. Jane sat down between two heaps of the gold, and Robert began to bury her, as you bury your father in sand when you are at the seaside and he has gone to sleep on the beach with his newspaper over his face. But Jane was not half buried before she cried out, ""Oh stop, it's too heavy! It hurts!""",gold say begin talk pick golden treasure handful let run finger water chink make fall wonderful music first forget think spend money nice play sit heap gold begin bury bury father sand seaside go sleep beach newspaper face half bury cry stop heavy hurt

70,"""Look here,"" Cyril said, ""if this is to do us any good, it's no good our staying gasping at it like this. Let's fill our pockets and go and buy things. Don't you forget, it won't last after sunset. I wish we'd asked the Sammyadd why things don't turn to stone. Perhaps this will.

74,"""You made fun of me for getting father to have nine pockets in my suit,"" said he, ""but now you see!""",make fun get father have pocket suit say see 
75,"They did. For when Cyril had filled his nine pockets and his handkerchief and the space between himself and his shirt front with the gold coins, he had to stand up. But he staggered, and had to sit down again in a hurry.",fill pocket handkerchief space shirt front gold coin have stand stagger have sit hurry

79,"It was Jane who said, ""I don't see how we're to spend it all. There must be thousands of pounds among the lot of us. I'm going to leave some of mine behind this stump in the hedge. And directly we get to the village we'll buy some biscuits; I know it's long past dinner-time."" She took out a handful or two of gold and hid it in the hollows of an old hornbeam.

80,"""Well, they're not, and we're not,"" said Cyril. ""Come on!""",say come 
81,"But they came on heavily and wearily. Before they reached the village, more than one stump in the hedge concealed its little hoard of hidden treasure. Yet they reached the village with about twelve hundred guineas in their pockets. But in spite of this inside wealth they looked quite ordinary outside, and no one would have thought they could have more than a half-crown each at the outside. The haze of heat, the blue of the wood smoke, made a sort of dim misty cloud over the red roofs of the village. The four sat down heavily on the first bench to which they came. It happened to be outside the Blue Boar Inn.",come reach village more stump hedge conceal little hoard hide treasure reach village guinea pocket spite inside wealth look ordinary think have more half crown outside haze heat blue wood smoke make sort dim misty cloud red roof village sit first bench come happen blue

83,"It was decided that Cyril should go into the Blue Boar and ask for ginger-beer, because, as Anthea said, ""It was not wrong for men to go into beer-saloons, only for children.

85,"""We might try,"" Jane said; and they all put their tongues out as far as ever they could go, so that it quite stretched their throats, but it only seemed to make them thirstier than ever, besides annoying everyone who went by. So they took their tongues in again, just as Cyril came back with ginger-beer.",try say put tongue go stretch throat seem make thirstier annoy go take tongue come ginger beer 
86,"""I had to pay for it out of my own money, though, that I was going to buy rabbits with,"" he said. ""They wouldn't change the gold.

And some biscuits with caraways in.""",have pay own money go buy rabbit say change gold pull handful man laugh say card counter get sponge cake glass jar bar counter biscuit caraway

97,"And now the children began to see one of the laws of nature turn upside down and stand on its head like an acrobat. Any grown-up person would tell you that money is hard to get and easy to spend. But the fairy money had been easy to get, and spending it was not only hard, it was almost impossible.

104,"So they chose a humble shop, and the girls bought cotton gloves, the kind at a shilling, but when they offered a guinea the woman looked at it through her spectacles and said she had no change; so the gloves had to be paid for out of Cyril's money with which he meant to buy rabbits and so had the green imitation crocodile-skin purse at nine-pence which had been bought at the same time. They tried several more shops, the kinds where you buy toys and perfume and silk handkerchiefs and books, and fancy boxes of stationery, and photographs of objects of interest in the vicinity. But nobody cared to change a guinea that day in Rochester, and as they went from shop to shop they got dirtier and dirtier, and their hair got more and more untidy, and Jane slipped and fell down on a part of the road where a water cart had just gone by.

105,"After trying two baker shops in vain, they became so hungry, perhaps from the smell of the cake in the shops, as Cyril suggested, that they formed a plan of campaign in whispers and carried it out in desperation. They marched into a third baker shop,--Beale was his name,--and before the people behind the counter could interfere each child had seized three new penny buns, clapped the three together between its dirty hands, and taken a big bite out of the triple sandwich. Then they stood at bay, with the twelve buns in their hands and their mouths very full indeed. The shocked baker's man bounded round the corner.",try baker shop vain become hungry smell cake shop suggest form plan campaign whisper carry desperation march third baker shop name person counter interfere child seize new penny bun clapp dirty hand take big bite triple sandwich stand bay bun hand mouth full shocked baker man bound corner

112,"In the Gardens of the Castle the millionaires finished the buns, and though the curranty softness of these were delicious, and acted like a charm in raising the spirits of the party, yet even the stoutest heart quailed at the thought of venturing to sound Mr. Billy Peasemarsh at the Saracen's Head on the subject of a horse and carriage. The boys would have given up the idea, but Jane was always a hopeful child, and Anthea generally an obstinate one, and their earnestness prevailed.",millionaire finish bun curranty softness delicious act charm raise spirit party stoutest heart quail thought venture sound subject horse carriage boy give idea hopeful child obstinate one earnestness prevail

As for the guinea the baker took, the children felt they _could_ not care whether it had vanished or not, which was not perhaps very honest, but on the other hand was not wholly unnatural. But afterwards this preyed on Anthea's mind, and at last she secretly sent twelve postage stamps by post to ""Mr. Beale, Baker, Rochester."" Inside she wrote, ""To pay for the buns.""
