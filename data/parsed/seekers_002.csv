1,CHAPTER 2. DIGGING FOR TREASURE,chapter digging 
2,"I am afraid the last chapter was rather dull. It is always dull in books when people talk and talk, and don’t do anything, but I was obliged to put it in, or else you wouldn’t have understood all the rest. The best part of books is when things are happening. That is the best part of real things too. This is why I shall not tell you in this story about all the days when nothing happened. You will not catch me saying, ‘thus the sad days passed slowly by’--or ‘the years rolled on their weary course’--or ‘time went on’--because it is silly; of course time goes on--whether you say so or not. So I shall just tell you the nice, interesting parts--and in between you will understand that we had our meals and got up and went to bed, and dull things like that. It would be sickening to write all that down, though of course it happens. I said so to Albert-next-door’s uncle, who writes books, and he said, ‘Quite right, that’s what we call selection, a necessity of true art.’ And he is very clever indeed. So you see.",afraid last chapter dull dull book person talk talk do oblige put understand rest good part book thing happen good part real thing tell story day happen catch say sad day pass year roll weary course time go silly course time go say tell nice interesting part understand have meal get go bed dull thing sickening write course happen say next door uncle write book say right call selection necessity true art clever see 
3,"I have often thought that if the people who write books for children knew a little more it would be better. I shall not tell you anything about us except what I should like to know about if I was reading the story and you were writing it. Albert’s uncle says I ought to have put this in the preface, but I never read prefaces, and it is not much good writing things just for people to skip. I wonder other authors have never thought of this.",think person write book child know little more good tell like know read story write uncle say put preface read preface good write thing person skip wonder other author think 
4,"Well, when we had agreed to dig for treasure we all went down into the cellar and lighted the gas. Oswald would have liked to dig there, but it is stone flags. We looked among the old boxes and broken chairs and fenders and empty bottles and things, and at last we found the spades we had to dig in the sand with when we went to the seaside three years ago. They are not silly, babyish, wooden spades, that split if you look at them, but good iron, with a blue mark across the top of the iron part, and yellow wooden handles. We wasted a little time getting them dusted, because the girls wouldn’t dig with spades that had cobwebs on them. Girls would never do for African explorers or anything like that, they are too beastly particular.",agree dig treasure go cellar light gas like dig stone flag look old box break chair fender empty bottle thing last find spade have dig sand go seaside year silly babyish wooden spade split look good iron blue mark top iron part yellow wooden handle waste little time get dust girl dig spade have cobweb girl do african explorer particular 
5,"It was no use doing the thing by halves. We marked out a sort of square in the mouldy part of the garden, about three yards across, and began to dig. But we found nothing except worms and stones--and the ground was very hard.",use do thing half mark sort square mouldy part garden yard begin dig find worm stone ground hard 
6,"So we thought we’d try another part of the garden, and we found a place in the big round flower bed, where the ground was much softer. We thought we’d make a smaller hole to begin with, and it was much better. We dug and dug and dug, and it was jolly hard work! We got very hot digging, but we found nothing.",think try part garden find place big round flower bed ground softer think make small hole begin good dig dig dig jolly hard work get hot digging find 
7,"Presently Albert-next-door looked over the wall. We do not like him very much, but we let him play with us sometimes, because his father is dead, and you must not be unkind to orphans, even if their mothers are alive. Albert is always very tidy. He wears frilly collars and velvet knickerbockers. I can’t think how he can bear to.",next door look wall like let play father dead unkind orphan mother alive tidy wear frilly collar velvet knickerbocker think bear 
8,"So we said, ‘Hallo!’",say 
9,"And he said, ‘What are you up to?’",say 
10,"‘We’re digging for treasure,’ said Alice; ‘an ancient parchment revealed to us the place of concealment. Come over and help us. When we have dug deep enough we shall find a great pot of red clay, full of gold and precious jewels.’",digg treasure say ancient parchment reveal place concealment come help dig deep find great pot red clay full gold precious jewel 
11,"Albert-next-door only sniggered and said, ‘What silly nonsense!’ He cannot play properly at all. It is very strange, because he has a very nice uncle. You see, Albert-next-door doesn’t care for reading, and he has not read nearly so many books as we have, so he is very foolish and ignorant, but it cannot be helped, and you just have to put up with it when you want him to do anything. Besides, it is wrong to be angry with people for not being so clever as you are yourself. It is not always their faults.",next door snigger say silly nonsense play strange have nice uncle see next door care read read many book have foolish ignorant help have put want do wrong angry person clever fault 
12,"So Oswald said, ‘Come and dig! Then you shall share the treasure when we’ve found it.’",say come dig share treasure find 
13,"But he said, ‘I shan’t--I don’t like digging--and I’m just going in to my tea.’",say like digg go tea 
14,"‘Come along and dig, there’s a good boy,’ Alice said. ‘You can use my spade. It’s much the best--’",come dig be good boy say use spade good 
15,"So he came along and dug, and when once he was over the wall we kept him at it, and we worked as well, of course, and the hole got deep. Pincher worked too--he is our dog and he is very good at digging. He digs for rats in the dustbin sometimes, and gets very dirty. But we love our dog, even when his face wants washing.",come dig wall keep work course hole get deep work dog good digg dig rat dustbin get dirty love dog face want washing 
16,"‘I expect we shall have to make a tunnel,’ Oswald said, ‘to reach the rich treasure.’ So he jumped into the hole and began to dig at one side. After that we took it in turns to dig at the tunnel, and Pincher was most useful in scraping the earth out of the tunnel--he does it with his back feet when you say ‘Rats!’ and he digs with his front ones, and burrows with his nose as well.",expect have make tunnel say reach rich treasure jump hole begin dig side take turn dig tunnel useful scrape earth tunnel do back foot say rat dig front one burrow nose 
17,"At last the tunnel was nearly a yard long, and big enough to creep along to find the treasure, if only it had been a bit longer. Now it was Albert’s turn to go in and dig, but he funked it.",last tunnel yard long big creep find treasure bit turn go dig funk 
18,"‘Take your turn like a man,’ said Oswald--nobody can say that Oswald doesn’t take his turn like a man. But Albert wouldn’t. So we had to make him, because it was only fair.",take turn man say say take turn man have make fair 
19,"‘It’s quite easy,’ Alice said. ‘You just crawl in and dig with your hands. Then when you come out we can scrape out what you’ve done, with the spades. Come--be a man. You won’t notice it being dark in the tunnel if you shut your eyes tight. We’ve all been in except Dora--and she doesn’t like worms.’",easy say crawl dig hand come scrape do spade come man notice dark tunnel shut eye tight like worm 
20,‘I don’t like worms neither.’ Albert-next-door said this; but we remembered how he had picked a fat red and black worm up in his fingers and thrown it at Dora only the day before. So we put him in.,like worm next door say remember pick fat red black worm finger throw day put 
21,"But he would not go in head first, the proper way, and dig with his hands as we had done, and though Oswald was angry at the time, for he hates snivellers, yet afterwards he owned that perhaps it was just as well. You should never be afraid to own that perhaps you were mistaken--but it is cowardly to do it unless you are quite sure you are in the wrong.",go head proper way dig hand do angry time hate sniveller own afraid own mistaken cowardly do sure wrong 
22,"‘Let me go in feet first,’ said Albert-next-door. ‘I’ll dig with my boots--I will truly, honour bright.’",let go foot say next door dig boot honour bright 
23,"So we let him get in feet first--and he did it very slowly and at last he was in, and only his head sticking out into the hole; and all the rest of him in the tunnel.",let get foot do last head stick hole rest tunnel 
24,"‘Now dig with your boots,’ said Oswald; ‘and, Alice, do catch hold of Pincher, he’ll be digging again in another minute, and perhaps it would be uncomfortable for Albert if Pincher threw the mould into his eyes.’",dig boot say catch hold digg minute uncomfortable throw mould eye 
25,"You should always try to think of these little things. Thinking of other people’s comfort makes them like you. Alice held Pincher, and we all shouted, ‘Kick! dig with your feet, for all you’re worth!’",try think little thing think other person comfort make hold shout kick dig foot worth 
26,"So Albert-next-door began to dig with his feet, and we stood on the ground over him, waiting--and all in a minute the ground gave way, and we tumbled together in a heap: and when we got up there was a little shallow hollow where we had been standing, and Albert-next-door was underneath, stuck quite fast, because the roof of the tunnel had tumbled in on him. He is a horribly unlucky boy to have anything to do with.",next door begin dig foot stand ground wait minute ground give way tumble heap get little shallow hollow stand next door stuck roof tunnel tumble unlucky boy have do 
27,"It was dreadful the way he cried and screamed, though he had to own it didn’t hurt, only it was rather heavy and he couldn’t move his legs. We would have dug him out all right enough, in time, but he screamed so we were afraid the police would come, so Dicky climbed over the wall, to tell the cook there to tell Albert-next-door’s uncle he had been buried by mistake, and to come and help dig him out.",dreadful way cry scream have own hurt heavy move leg dig time scream afraid police come climb wall tell cook tell next door uncle bury mistake come help dig 
28,"Dicky was a long time gone. We wondered what had become of him, and all the while the screaming went on and on, for we had taken the loose earth off Albert’s face so that he could scream quite easily and comfortably.",long time gone wonder become scream go take loose earth face scream 
29,"Presently Dicky came back and Albert-next-door’s uncle came with him. He has very long legs, and his hair is light and his face is brown. He has been to sea, but now he writes books. I like him.",come next door uncle come have long leg hair light face brown sea write book like 
30,"He told his nephew to stow it, so Albert did, and then he asked him if he was hurt--and Albert had to say he wasn’t, for though he is a coward, and very unlucky, he is not a liar like some boys are.",tell nephew stow ask hurt have say coward unlucky liar boy 
31,"‘This promises to be a protracted if agreeable task,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, rubbing his hands and looking at the hole with Albert’s head in it. ‘I will get another spade,’ so he fetched the big spade out of the next-door garden tool-shed, and began to dig his nephew out.",promise protracted agreeable task say next door uncle rub hand look hole head get spade fetched big spade next door garden tool shed begin dig nephew 
32,"‘Mind you keep very still,’ he said, ‘or I might chunk a bit out of you with the spade.’ Then after a while he said--",mind keep say chunk bit spade while say 
33,‘I confess that I am not absolutely insensible to the dramatic interest of the situation. My curiosity is excited. I own that I should like to know how my nephew happened to be buried. But don’t tell me if you’d rather not. I suppose no force was used?’,confess insensible dramatic interest situation curiosity excited own like know nephew happen bury tell suppose force use 
34,"‘Only moral force,’ said Alice. They used to talk a lot about moral force at the High School where she went, and in case you don’t know what it means I’ll tell you that it is making people do what they don’t want to, just by slanging them, or laughing at them, or promising them things if they’re good.",moral force say use talk lot moral force high go case know mean tell make person do want slang laugh promise thing good 
35,"‘Only moral force, eh?’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle. ‘Well?’",moral force say next door uncle 
36,"‘Well,’ Dora said, ‘I’m very sorry it happened to Albert--I’d rather it had been one of us. It would have been my turn to go into the tunnel, only I don’t like worms, so they let me off. You see we were digging for treasure.’",say sorry happen turn go tunnel like worm let see digg treasure 
37,"‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘and I think we were just coming to the underground passage that leads to the secret hoard, when the tunnel fell in on Albert. He _is_ so unlucky,’ and she sighed.",say think come underground passage lead secret hoard tunnel fall unlucky sigh 
38,"Then Albert-next-door began to scream again, and his uncle wiped his face--his own face, not Albert’s--with his silk handkerchief, and then he put it in his trousers pocket. It seems a strange place to put a handkerchief, but he had his coat and waistcoat off and I suppose he wanted the handkerchief handy. Digging is warm work.",next door begin scream uncle wipe face own face silk handkerchief put trousers pocket seem strange place put handkerchief have coat waistcoat suppose want handkerchief handy digging warm work 
39,"He told Albert-next-door to drop it, or he wouldn’t proceed further in the matter, so Albert stopped screaming, and presently his uncle finished digging him out. Albert did look so funny, with his hair all dusty and his velvet suit covered with mould and his face muddy with earth and crying.",tell next door drop proceed matter stop scream uncle finish digg look funny hair dusty velvet suit cover mould face muddy earth cry 
40,"We all said how sorry we were, but he wouldn’t say a word back to us. He was most awfully sick to think he’d been the one buried, when it might just as well have been one of us. I felt myself that it was hard lines.",say sorry say word sick think one bury feel hard line 
41,"‘So you were digging for treasure,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, wiping his face again with his handkerchief. ‘Well, I fear that your chances of success are small. I have made a careful study of the whole subject. What I don’t know about buried treasure is not worth knowing. And I never knew more than one coin buried in any one garden--and that is generally--Hullo--what’s that?’",digg treasure say next door uncle wipe face handkerchief fear chance success small make careful study whole subject know bury treasure worth know know more coin bury garden 
42,"He pointed to something shining in the hole he had just dragged Albert out of. Oswald picked it up. It was a half-crown. We looked at each other, speechless with surprise and delight, like in books.",point shine hole drag pick half crown look other speechless surprise delight book 
43,"‘Well, that’s lucky, at all events,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle.",lucky event say next door uncle 
44,"‘Let’s see, that’s fivepence each for you.’",let see fivepence 
45,"‘It’s fourpence--something; I can’t do fractions,’ said Dicky; ‘there are seven of us, you see.’",fourpence do fraction say be see 
46,"‘Oh, you count Albert as one of yourselves on this occasion, eh?’",count occasion 
47,"‘Of course,’ said Alice; ‘and I say, he was buried after all. Why shouldn’t we let him have the odd somethings, and we’ll have fourpence each.’",course say say bury let have odd something have fourpence 
48,"We all agreed to do this, and told Albert-next-door we would bring his share as soon as we could get the half-crown changed. He cheered up a little at that, and his uncle wiped his face again--he did look hot--and began to put on his coat and waistcoat.",agree do tell next door bring share get half crown change cheer little uncle wipe face look hot begin put coat waistcoat 
49,"When he had done it he stooped and picked up something. He held it up, and you will hardly believe it, but it is quite true--it was another half-crown!",do stoop pick hold believe true half crown 
50,‘To think that there should be two!’ he said; ‘in all my experience of buried treasure I never heard of such a thing!’,think be say experience bury treasure hear thing 
51,"I wish Albert-next-door’s uncle would come treasure-seeking with us regularly; he must have very sharp eyes: for Dora says she was looking just the minute before at the very place where the second half-crown was picked up from, and _she_ never saw it.",wish next door uncle come treasure seek have sharp eye say look minute very place second half crown pick see
