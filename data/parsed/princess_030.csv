2," THE next morning the sun rose so bright that Irene said the rain had washed his face and let the light out clean. The torrents were still roaring down the side of the mountain, but they were so much smaller as not to be dangerous in the daylight. After an early breakfast, Peter went to his work, and Curdie and his mother set out to take the princess home. They had difficulty in getting her dry across the streams, and Curdie had again and again to carry her, but at last they got safe on the broader part of the road, and walked gently down toward the king's house. And what should they see as they turned the last corner, but the last of the king's troop riding through the gate!",next morning sun rise bright say rain wash face let light clean torrent roar side mountain small dangerous daylight early breakfast go work mother set take princess have difficulty get dry stream have carry last get safe broad part road walk king house see turn last corner last king troop ride gate 
3,"""Oh, Curdie!"" cried Irene, clapping her hands right joyfully, ""my king-papa is come.""",cry clap hand king papa come 
4,"The moment Curdie heard that, he caught her up in his arms, and set off at full speed, crying--",moment hear catch arm set full speed cry 
5,"""Come on, mother dear! The king may break his heart before he knows that she is safe.""",come mother dear king break heart know safe 
6,"Irene clung round his neck, and he ran with her like a deer. When he entered the gate into the court, there sat the king on his horse, with all the people of the house about him, weeping and hanging their heads. The king was not weeping, but his face was white as a dead man's, and he looked as if the life had gone out of him. The men-at-arms he had brought with him, sat with horror-stricken faces, but eyes flashing with rage, waiting only for the word of the king to do something--they did not know what, and nobody knew what.",cling neck run deer enter gate court sit king horse person house weep hang head king weep face white dead man look life go man arm bring sit horror stricken face eye flash rage wait word king do know know 
7,"The day before the men-at-arms belonging to the house, as soon as they were satisfied the princess had been carried away, rushed after the goblins into the hole, but found that they had already so skilfully blockaded the narrowest part, not many feet below the cellar, that without miners and their tools they could do nothing. Not one of them knew where the mouth of the mine lay, and some of those who had set out to find it had been overtaken by the storm and had not even yet returned. Poor Sir Walter was especially filled with shame, and almost entertained the hope that the king would order him to be decapitated, for the very thought of that sweet little face down amongst the goblins was unendurable.",day man arm belong house satisfy princess carry rush goblin hole find blockade narrowest part many foot cellar miner tool do know mouth lay set find overtake storm return poor fill shame entertain hope king order decapitate very thought sweet little face goblin unendurable 
8,"When Curdie ran in at the gate with the princess in his arms, they were all so absorbed in their own misery and awed by the king's presence and grief, that no one observed his arrival. He went straight up to the king, where he sat on his horse.",run gate princess arm absorb own misery awe king presence grief observe arrival go king sit horse 
9,"""Papa! papa!"" the princess cried, stretching out her arms to him; ""here I am!""",princess cry stretch arm 
10,"The king started. The color rushed to his face. He gave an inarticulate cry. Curdie held up the princess, and the king bent down and took her from his arms. As he clasped her to his bosom, the big tears went dropping down his cheeks and his beard. And such a shout arose from all the bystanders, that the startled horses pranced and capered, and the armor rang and clattered, and the rocks of the mountain echoed back the noises. The princess greeted them all as she nestled in her father's bosom, and the king did not set her down until she had told them all the story. But she had more to tell about Curdie than about herself, and what she did tell about herself none of them could understand except the king and Curdie, who stood by the king's knee stroking the neck of the great white horse. And still as she told what Curdie had done, Sir Walter and others added to what she told, even Lootie joining in the praises of his courage and energy.",king start color rush face give inarticulate cry hold princess king bend take arm clasp bosom big tear go drop cheek beard shout arise bystander startle horse prance caper armor ring clatter rock mountain echoe noise princess greet nestle father bosom king set tell story have more tell tell understand king stand king knee stroke neck great white horse tell do other add tell join praise courage energy 
11,"Curdie held his peace, looking quietly up in the king's face. And his mother stood on the outskirts of the crowd listening with delight, for her son's deeds were pleasant in her ears, until the princess caught sight of her.",hold peace look king face mother stand outskirt crowd listen delight son deed pleasant ear princess catch sight 
12,"""And there is his mother, king-papa!"" she said. ""See--there. She is such a nice mother, and has been so kind to me!""",be mother king papa say see nice mother kind 
13,"They all parted asunder as the king made a sign to her to come forward. She obeyed, and he gave her his hand, but could not speak.",part king make sign come obey give hand speak 
14,"""And now, king-papa,"" the princess went on, ""I must tell you another thing. One night long ago Curdie drove the goblins away and brought Lootie and me safe from the mountain. And I promised him a kiss when we got home, but Lootie wouldn't let me give it to him. I would not have you scold Lootie, but I want you to impress upon her that a princess _must_ do as she promises.""",king princess go tell thing night drive goblin bring safe mountain promise kiss get let give scold want impress princess _must_ do promise 
15,"""Indeed she must, my child--except it be wrong,"" said the king. ""There, give Curdie a kiss.""",child wrong say king give kiss 
16,And as he spoke he held her toward him.,speak hold 
17,"The princess reached down, threw her arms round Curdie's neck, and kissed him on the mouth, saying--",princess reach throw arm neck kiss mouth say 
18,"""There, Curdie! There's the kiss I promised you!""",be kiss promise 
19,"Then they all went into the house, and the cook rushed to the kitchen, and the servants to their work. Lootie dressed Irene in her shiningest clothes, and the king put off his armor, and put on purple and gold; and a messenger was sent for Peter and all the miners, and there was a great and grand feast, which continued long after the princess was put to bed.",go house cook rush kitchen servant work dress shiningest clothes king put armor put purple gold messenger send miner be great grand feast continue princess put bed
