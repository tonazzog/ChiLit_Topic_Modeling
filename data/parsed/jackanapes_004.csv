2,"     ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his      life for his friends.""--JOHN XV. 13.",great love have man man lay life friend 
3," Twenty and odd years later the Grey Goose was still alive, and in full possession of her faculties, such as they were. She lived slowly and carefully, and she lived long. So did Miss Jessamine; but the General was dead.",odd year alive full possession faculty such live live dead 
4,"He had lived on the Green for many years, during which he and the Postman saluted each other with a punctiliousness that it almost drilled one to witness. He would have completely spoiled Jackanapes if Miss Jessamine's conscience would have let him; otherwise he somewhat dragooned his neighbors, and was as positive about parish matters as a ratepayer about the army. A stormy-tempered, tender-hearted soldier, irritable with the suffering of wounds of which he never spoke, whom all the village followed to his grave with tears.",live many year salute other punctiliousness drill witness spoiled conscience let dragoon neighbor positive parish matter ratepayer army stormy temper tender hearted soldier irritable suffering wound speak village follow grave tear 
5,"The General's death was a great shock to Miss Jessamine, and her nephew stayed with her for some little time after the funeral. Then he was obliged to join his regiment, which was ordered abroad.",death great shock nephew stay little time funeral oblige join regiment order 
6,"One effect of the conquest which the General had gained over the affections of the village, was a considerable abatement of the popular prejudice against ""the military."" Indeed the village was now somewhat importantly represented in the army. There was the General himself, and the Postman, and the Black Captain's tablet in the church, and Jackanapes, and Tony Johnson, and a Trumpeter.",effect conquest gain affection village considerable abatement popular prejudice military village represent army be black tablet church 
7," Tony Johnson had no more natural taste for fighting than for riding, but he was as devoted as ever to Jackanapes, and that was how it came about that Mr. Johnson bought him a commission in the same cavalry regiment that the General's grandson (whose commission had been given him by the Iron Duke) was in, and that he was quite content to be the butt of the mess where Jackanapes was the hero; and that when Jackanapes wrote home to Miss Jessamine, Tony wrote with the same purpose to his mother; namely, to demand her congratulations that they were on active service at last, and were ordered to the front. And he added a postscript to the effect that she could have no idea how popular Jackanapes was, nor how splendidly he rode the wonderful red charger whom he had named after his old friend Lollo.",have more natural taste fighting ride devoted come buy commission same cavalry regiment grandson commission give content butt mess hero write write same purpose mother demand congratulation active service last order front add postscript effect have idea popular ride wonderful red charge name old friend

9,"""Sound Retire!""",sound retire 
10,"A Boy Trumpeter, grave with the weight of responsibilities and accoutrements beyond his years, and stained, so that his own mother would not have known him, with the sweat and dust of battle, did as he was bid; and then pushing his trumpet pettishly aside, adjusted his weary legs for the hundredth time to the horse which was a world too big for him, and muttering, ""'Tain't a pretty tune,"" tried to see something of this, his first engagement, before it came to an end.",grave weight responsibility accoutrement year stain own mother know sweat dust battle bid push trumpet adjust weary leg hundredth time horse world big mutter pretty tune try see first engagement come end 
11,"Being literally in the thick of it, he could hardly have seen less or known less of what happened in that particular skirmish if he had been at home in England. For many good reasons; including dust and smoke, and that what attention he dared distract from his commanding officer was pretty well absorbed by keeping his hard-mouthed troop-horse in hand, under pain of execration by his neighbors in the mêlée. By-and-by, when the newspapers came out, if he could get a look at one before it was thumbed to bits, he would learn that the enemy had appeared from ambush in overwhelming numbers, and that orders had been given to fall back, which was done slowly and in good order, the men fighting as they retired.",thick see less know less happen particular skirmish home many good reason include dust smoke attention dare distract commanding officer absorb keep hard mouthed troop horse hand pain execration neighbor mêlée newspaper come get look thumb bit learn enemy appear ambush overwhelming number order give fall do good order man fight retire 
12,"Born and bred on the Goose Green, the youngest of Mr. Johnson's gardener's numerous off-spring, the boy had given his family ""no peace"" till they let him ""go for a soldier"" with Master Tony and Master Jackanapes. They consented at last, with more tears than they shed when an elder son was sent to jail for poaching, and the boy was perfectly happy in his life, and full of _esprit de corps_. It was this which had been wounded by having to sound retreat for ""the young gentlemen's regiment,"" the first time he served with it before the enemy, and he was also harassed by having completely lost sight of Master Tony. There had been some hard fighting before the backward movement began, and he had caught sight of him once, but not since. On the other hand, all the pulses of his village pride had been stirred by one or two visions of Master Jackanapes whirling about on his wonderful horse. He had been easy to distinguish, since an eccentric blow had bared his head without hurting it, for his close golden mop of hair gleamed in the hot sunshine as brightly as the steel of the sword flashing round it.",bear breed young gardener numerous spring boy give family peace let go soldier consent last more tear shed elder son send jail poaching boy happy life full wound have sound retreat young gentleman regiment first time serve enemy harass lose sight be hard fighting backward movement begin catch sight other hand pulse village pride stirr vision master whirl wonderful horse easy distinguish eccentric blow bare head hurt close golden mop hair gleam hot sunshine steel sword flash 
13,"Of the missiles that fell pretty thickly, the Boy Trumpeter did not take much notice. First, one can't attend to everything, and his hands were full. Secondly, one gets used to anything. Thirdly, experience soon teaches one, in spite of proverbs, how very few bullets find their billet. Far more unnerving is the mere suspicion of fear or even of anxiety in the human mass around you. The Boy was beginning to wonder if there were any dark reason for the increasing pressure, and whether they would be allowed to move back more quickly, when the smoke in front lifted for a moment, and he could see the plain, and the enemy's line some two hundred yards away.",missile fall take much notice attend hand full get use experience teach spite proverb few bullet find billet unnerving mere suspicion fear anxiety human mass begin wonder be dark reason increase pressure allow move smoke front lift moment see plain enemy line yard 
14," And across the plain between them, he saw Master Jackanapes galloping alone at the top of Lollo's speed, their faces to the enemy, his golden head at Lollo's ear.",plain see master gallop top speed face enemy golden head ear 
15,"But at this moment noise and smoke seemed to burst out on every side, the officer shouted to him to sound retire, and between trumpeting and bumping about on his horse, he saw and heard no more of the incidents of his first battle.",moment noise smoke seem burst side officer shout sound retire trumpet bump horse see hear more incident first battle 
16,"Tony Johnson was always unlucky with horses, from the days of the giddy-go-round onwards. On this day--of all days in the year--his own horse was on the sick list, and he had to ride an inferior, ill-conditioned beast, and fell off that, at the very moment when it was a matter of life or death to be able to ride away. The horse fell on him, but struggled up again, and Tony managed to keep hold of it. It was in trying to remount that he discovered, by helplessness and anguish, that one of his legs was crushed and broken, and that no feat of which he was master would get him into the saddle. Not able even to stand alone, awkwardly, agonizingly unable to mount his restive horse, his life was yet so strong within him! And on one side of him rolled the dust and smoke-cloud of his advancing foe, and on the other, that which covered his retreating friends.",unlucky horse day giddy go day day year own horse sick list have ride inferior ill condition beast fall very moment matter life death able ride horse fall struggle manage keep hold try remount discover helplessness anguish leg crush break feat master get saddle able stand alone unable mount restive horse life strong side roll dust smoke cloud advance foe other cover retreat friend 
17,"He turned one piteous gaze after them, with a bitter twinge, not of reproach, but of loneliness; and then, dragging himself up by the side of his horse, he turned the other way and drew out his pistol, and waited for the end. Whether he waited seconds or minutes he never knew, before some one gripped him by the arm.",turn piteous gaze bitter twinge reproach loneliness drag side horse turn other way draw pistol wait end wait second minute know one grip arm 
18,"""_Jackanapes_! _GOD bless you_! It's my left leg. If you could get me on--""",_jackanapes_ bless left leg get 
19,"It was like Tony's luck that his pistol went off at his horse's tail, and made it plunge; but Jackanapes threw him across the saddle.",luck pistol go horse tail make plunge throw saddle 
20,"""Hold on anyhow, and stick your spur in. I'll lead him. Keep your head down, they're firing high.""",hold stick spur lead keep head fire high 
21,And Jackanapes laid his head down--to Lollo's ear.,lay head ear 
22,"It was when they were fairly off, that a sudden upspringing of the enemy in all directions had made it necessary to change the gradual retirement of our force into as rapid a retreat as possible. And when Jackanapes became aware of this, and felt the lagging and swerving of Tony's horse, he began to wish he had thrown his friend across his own saddle, and left their lives to Lollo.",sudden upspringing enemy direction make necessary change gradual retirement force rapid retreat possible become aware feel lagging swerving horse begin wish throw friend own saddle leave life 
23,"When Tony became aware of it, several things came into his head. 1. That the dangers of their ride for life were now more than doubled. 2. That if Jackanapes and Lollo were not burdened with him they would undoubtedly escape. 3. That Jackanapes' life was infinitely valuable, and his--Tony's--was not. 4. That this--if he could seize it--was the supremest of all the moments in which he had tried to assume the virtues which Jackanapes had by nature; and that if he could be courageous and unselfish now--",become aware several thing come head danger ride life more double burden escape life valuable seize supremest moment try assume virtue have nature courageous unselfish 
24,He caught at his own reins and spoke very loud--,catch own rein speak 
25,"""Jackanapes! It won't do. You and Lollo must go on. Tell the fellows I gave you back to them, with all my heart. Jackanapes, if you love me, leave me!""",packanape do go tell fellow give heart love leave 
26,"There was a daffodil light over the evening sky in front of them, and it shone strangely on Jackanapes' hair and face. He turned with an odd look in his eyes that a vainer man than Tony Johnson might have taken for brotherly pride. Then he shook his mop and laughed at him.",be daffodil light evening sky front shine hair face turn odd look eye vainer man take brotherly pride shake mop laugh 
27,"""_Leave you?_ To save my skin? No, Tony, not to save my soul!""",_leave save skin save soul
