4," Three great events signalised the month of January. The first was, the opening of the school at Cocksmoor, whither a cart transported half a dozen forms, various books, and three dozen plum-buns, Margaret’s contribution, in order that the school might begin with eclat. There walked Mr. Wilmot, Richard, and Flora, with Mary, in a jumping, capering state of delight, and Ethel, not knowing whether she rejoiced. She kept apart from the rest, and hardly spoke, for this long probation had impressed her with a sense of responsibility, and she knew that it was a great work to which she had set her hand--a work in which she must persevere, and in which she could not succeed in her own strength.",great event signalise month first opening school cart transport form various book plum bun contribution order school begin eclat walk jump caper state delight know rejoice keep rest speak long probation impress sense responsibility know great work set hand work persevere succeed own strength 
5,"She took hold of Flora’s hand, and squeezed it hard, in a fit of shyness, when they came upon the hamlet, and saw the children watching for them; and when they reached the house, she would fain have shrank into nothing; there was a swelling of heart that seemed to overwhelm and stifle her, and the effect of which was to keep her standing unhelpful, when the others were busy bringing in the benches and settling the room.",take hold hand squeeze fit shyness come hamlet see child watch reach house shrank be swell heart seem overwhelm stifle effect keep standing unhelpful other busy bring bench settle room 
6,"It was a tidy room, but it seemed very small when they ranged the benches, and opened the door to the seven-and-twenty children, and the four or five women who stood waiting. Ethel felt some dismay when they all came pushing in, without order or civility, and would have been utterly at a loss what to do with her scholars now she had got them, if Richard and Flora had not marshalled them to the benches.",tidy room seem small rang bench open door child woman stand wait feel dismay come push order civility loss do scholar get marshall bench 
7,"Rough heads, torn garments, staring vacant eyes, and mouths gaping in shy rudeness--it was a sight to disenchant her of visions of pleasure in the work she had set herself. It was well that she had not to take the initiative.",rough head torn garment stare vacant eye mouth gape shy rudeness sight disenchant vision pleasure work set have take initiative 
8,"Mr. Wilmot said a few simple words to the mothers about the wish to teach their children what was right, and to do the best at present practicable; and then told the children that he hoped they would take pains to be good, and mind what they were taught. Then he desired all to kneel down; he said the Collect, “Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings,” and then the Lord’s Prayer.",say few simple word mother wish teach child right do good present practicable tell child hope take pain good mind teach desire kneel say collect prevent doing 
9,"Ethel felt as if she could bear it better, and was more up to the work after this. Next, the children were desired to stand round the room, and Mr. Wilmot tried who could say the Catechism--the two biggest, a boy and a girl, had not an idea of it, and the boy looked foolish, and grinned at being asked what was his name. One child was tolerably perfect, and about half a dozen had some dim notions. Three were entirely ignorant of the Lord’s Prayer, and many of the others did not by any means pronounce the words of it. Jane and Fanny Taylor, Rebekah Watts, and Mrs. Green’s little boy, were the only ones who, by their own account, used morning and evening prayers, though, on further examination, it appeared that Polly and Jenny Hall, and some others, were accustomed to repeat the old rhyme about “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,” and Una M’Carthy and her little brother Fergus said something that nobody could make out, but which Mr. Wilmot thought had once been an “Ave Maria.”",feel bear work child desire stand room try say big boy girl have idea boy look foolish grin ask name child perfect have dim notion ignorant many other means pronounce word little boy only one own account use morning evening prayer further examination appear other accustom repeat old rhyme little brother say make think 
10,"Some few of the children could read, and several more knew their letters. The least ignorant were selected to form a first class, and Mr. Wilmot promised a Prayer-book to the first who should be able to repeat the Catechism without a mistake, and a Bible to the first who could read a chapter in it.",few child read several more know letter least ignorant select form first class promise prayer book first able repeat mistake first read chapter 
11,"Then followed a setting of tasks, varying from a verse of a Psalm, or the first answer in the Catechism, down to the distinction between A, B, and C; all to be ready by next Tuesday, when, weather permitting, a second lesson was to be given. Afterwards, a piece of advice of Margaret’s was followed, and Flora read aloud to the assembly the story of “Margaret Fletcher.” To some this seemed to give great satisfaction, especially to Una, but Ethel was surprised to see that many, and those not only little ones, talked and yawned. They had no power of attention even to a story, and the stillness was irksome to such wild colts. It was plain that it was time to leave off, and there was no capacity there which did not find the conclusion agreeable, when the basket was opened, and Ethel and Mary distributed the buns, with instructions to say, “thank you.”",follow setting task vary verse first answer distinction a b ready next weather permitting second lesson give piece advice follow read assembly story seem give great satisfaction surprise see many little one talk yawn have power attention story stillness irksome such wild colt plain time leave be capacity find conclusion agreeable basket open distribute bun instruction say thank 
12,"The next Tuesday, some of the lessons were learned, Una’s perfectly, the big ignorant boy came no more; and some of the children had learned to behave better, while others behaved worse; Ethel began to know what she was about; Richard’s gentleness was eminently successful with the little girls, impressing good manners on them in a marvellous way; and Mary’s importance and happiness with alphabet scholars, some bigger than herself, were edifying. Cocksmoor was fairly launched.",next lesson learn big ignorant boy come child learn behave good other behave bad begin know gentleness successful little girl impress good manners marvellous way importance happiness alphabet scholar big edify launch 
13,"The next memorable day was that of Margaret’s being first carried downstairs. She had been willing to put it off as long as she could, dreading to witness the change below-stairs, and feeling, too, that in entering on the family room, without power of leaving it, she was losing all quiet and solitude, as well as giving up that monopoly of her father in his evenings, which had been her great privilege.",next memorable day carry willing put dread witness change stair feeling enter family room power leave lose quiet solitude give monopoly father evening great privilege 
14,"However, she tried to talk herself into liking it; and was rewarded by the happy commotion it caused, though Dr. May was in a state of excitement and nervousness at the prospect of seeing her on the stairs, and his attempts to conceal it only made it worse, till Margaret knew she should be nervous herself, and wished him out of sight and out of the house till it was over, for without him she had full confidence in the coolness and steadiness of Richard, and by him it was safely and quietly accomplished. She was landed on the sofa, Richard and Flora settling her, and the others crowding round and exclaiming, while the newness of the scene and the change gave her a sense of confusion, and she shut her eyes to recover her thoughts, but opened them the next instant at her father’s exclamation that she was overcome, smiled to reassure him, and declared herself not tired, and to be very glad to be among them again. But the bustle was oppressive, and her cheerful manner was an effort; she longed to see them all gone, and Flora found it out, sent the children for their walk, and carried off Ethel and the brothers.",try talk like reward happy commotion cause state excitement nervousness prospect see stair attempt conceal make bad know nervous wish sight house have full confidence coolness steadiness accomplish land sofa settle other crowd exclaim newness scene change give sense confusion shut eye recover thought open next instant father exclamation overcome smile reassure declare tired glad bustle oppressive cheerful manner effort long see gone find send child walk carry brother 
15,"Dr. May was called out of the room at the same time, and she was left alone. She gazed round her, at the room where, four months before, she had seen her mother with the babe in her arms, the children clustered round her, her father exulting in his hen-and-chicken daisies, herself full of bright undefined hope, radiant with health and activity, and her one trouble such that she now knew the force of her mother’s words, that it only proved her happiness. It was not till that moment that Margaret realised the change; found her eyes filling with tears, as she looked round, and saw the familiar furniture and ornaments.",call room same time leave alone gaze room month see mother babe arm child cluster father exult hen chicken daisy full bright undefined hope radiant health activity trouble such know force mother word prove happiness moment realise change find eye fill tear look see familiar furniture ornament 
16,"They were instantly checked as she heard her father returning, but not so that he did not perceive them, and exclaim that it had been too much for her. “Oh, no--it was only the first time,” said Margaret, losing the sense of the painful vacancy in her absorbing desire not to distress her father, and thinking only of him as she watched him standing for some minutes leaning on the mantel-shelf with his hand shading his forehead.",check hear father return perceive exclaim much first time say lose sense painful vacancy absorb desire distress father think watch stand minute lean mantel shelf hand shade forehead 
17,She began to speak as soon as she thought he was ready to have his mind turned away: “How nicely Ritchie managed! He carried me so comfortably and easily. It is enough to spoil me to be so deftly waited on.”,begin speak think ready have mind turn manage carry enough spoil wait 
18,"“I’m glad of it,” said Dr. May; “I am sure the change is better for you;” but he came and looked at her still with great solicitude.",glad say sure change good come look great solicitude 
19,"“Ritchie can take excellent care of me,” she continued, most anxious to divert his thoughts. “You see it will do very well indeed for you to take Harry to school.”",take excellent care continue anxious divert thought see do take school 
20,"“I should like to do so. I should like to see his master, and to take Norman with me,” said the doctor. “It would be just the thing for him now--we would show him the dockyard, and all those matters, and such a thorough holiday would set him up again.”",like do like see master take say doctor thing show dockyard matter thorough holiday set

I like to see him looking out for a curious fern in the hedgerows--the pursuit has quite brightened him up.”,good recover spirit tone leaf work come lucky time like see look curious fern hedgerow pursuit brighten 
23,"“And he does it so thoroughly,” said Margaret. “Ethel fancies it is rather frivolous of him, I believe; but it amuses me to see how men give dignity to what women make trifling. He will know everything about the leaves, hunts up my botany books, and has taught me a hundred times more of the construction and wonders of them than I ever learned.”",do say fancy frivolous believe amuse see man give dignity woman make trifl know leave hunt botany book teach time more construction wonder learn 
24,"“Ay,” said the doctor, “he has been talking a good deal to me about vegetable chemistry. He would make a good scientific botanist, if he were to be nothing else. I should be glad if he sticks to it as a pursuit--‘tis pretty work, and I should like to have gone further with it, if I had ever had time for it.”",say doctor talk good deal vegetable chemistry make good scientific botanist else glad stick pursuit pretty work like go have time 
25,"“I dare say he will,” said Margaret. “It will be very pleasant if he can go with you. How he would enjoy the British Museum, if there was time for him to see it! Have you said anything to him yet?”",say say pleasant go enjoy british be time see say 
26,"“No; I waited to see how you were, as it all depends on that.”",wait see depend 
27,“I think it depends still more on something else; whether Norman is as fit to take care of you as Richard is.”,think depend more else fit take care 
28,"“That’s another point. There’s nothing but what he could manage now, but I don’t like saying anything to him. I know he would undertake anything I wished, without a word, and then, perhaps, dwell on it in fancy, and force himself, till it would turn to a perfect misery, and upset his nerves again. I’m sorry for it. I meant him to have followed my trade, but he’ll never do for that. However, he has wits enough to make himself what he pleases, and I dare say he will keep at the head of the school after all.”",point be manage like say know undertake wish word dwell fancy force turn perfect misery upset nerve sorry mean follow trade do wit make please say keep head school 
29,“How very good he has been in refraining from restlessness!”,good refrain restlessness 
30,"“It’s beautiful!” said Dr. May, with strong emotion. “Poor boy! I trust he’ll not be disappointed, and I don’t think he will; but I’ve promised him I won’t be annoyed if he should lose his place--so we must take especial care not to show any anxiety. However, for this matter, Margaret, I wish you would sound him, and see whether it would be more pleasure or pain. Only mind you don’t let him think that I shall be vexed, if he feels that he can’t make up his mind; I would not have him fancy that, for more than I can tell.”",beautiful say strong emotion poor boy trust disappoint think promise annoy lose place take especial care show anxiety matter wish sound see more pleasure pain mind let think vex feel make mind have fancy more tell 
31,"This consultation revived the spirits of both; and the others returning, found Margaret quite disposed for companionship. If to her the evening was sad and strange, like a visit in a dream to some old familiar haunt, finding all unnatural, to the rest it was delightful. The room was no longer dreary, now that there was a centre for care and attentions, and the party was no longer broken up--the sense of comfort, cheerfulness, and home-gathering had returned, and the pleasant evening household gossip went round the table almost as it used to do. Dr. May resumed his old habit of skimming a club book, and imparting the cream to the listeners; and Flora gave them some music, a great treat to Margaret, who had long only heard its distant sounds.",consultation revive spirit other return find dispose companionship evening sad strange visit dream old familiar haunt find unnatural rest delightful room dreary be centre care attention party break sense comfort cheerfulness home gathering return pleasant evening household gossip go table use do resume old habit skimm club book impart cream listener give music great treat hear distant sound 
32,"Margaret found an opportunity of talking to Norman, and judged favourably. He was much pleased at the prospect of the journey, and of seeing a ship, so as to have a clearer notion of the scene where Harry’s life was to be spent, and though the charge of the arm was a drawback, he did not treat it as insurmountable.",find opportunity talk judge pleased prospect journey see ship have clear notion scene life spend charge arm drawback treat insurmountable 
33,"A few days’ attendance in his father’s room gave him confidence in taking Richard’s place, and, accordingly, the third important measure was decided on, namely, that he and his father should accompany Harry to the naval school, and be absent three nights. Some relations would be glad to receive them in London, and Alan Ernescliffe, who was studying steam navigation at Woolwich, volunteered to meet them, and go with them to Portsmouth.",few day attendance father room give confidence take place third important measure decide father accompany naval school absent night relation glad receive study steam navigation volunteer meet go 
34,"It was a wonderful event; Norman and Harry had never been beyond Whitford in their lives, and none of the young ones could recollect their papa’s ever going from home for more than one night. Dr. May laughed at Margaret for her anxiety and excitement on the subject, and was more amused at overhearing Richard’s precise directions to Norman over the packing up.",wonderful event life young one recollect papa go home more night laugh anxiety excitement subject amused overhear precise direction packing 
35,"“Ay, Ritchie,” said the doctor, as he saw his portmanteau locked, and the key given to Norman, “you may well look grave upon it. You won’t see it look so tidy when it comes back again, and I believe you are thinking it will be lucky if you see it at all.”",say doctor see portmanteau lock key give look grave see look tidy come believe think lucky see 
36,"There was a very affectionate leave-taking of Harry, who, growing rather soft-hearted, thought it needful to be disdainful, scolded Mary and Blanche for “lugging off his figure-head,” and assured them they made as much work about it as if he was going to sea at once. Then, to put an end to any more embraces, he marched off to the station with Tom, and nearly caused the others to be too late, by the search for him that ensued.",be affectionate leave take grow soft hearted think needful disdainful scold lugg figure head assure make much work go sea put end more embrace march station cause other late search ensue 
37,"In due time, Dr. May and Norman returned, looking the better for the journey. There was, first, to tell of Harry’s school and its master, and Alan Ernescliffe’s introduction of him to a nice-looking boy of his own age; then they were eloquent on the wonders of the dockyard, the Victory, the block machinery. And London--while Dr. May went to transact some business, Norman had been with Alan at the British Museum, and though he had intended to see half London besides, there was no tearing him away from the Elgin marbles; and nothing would serve him, but bringing Dr. May the next morning to visit the Ninevite bulls. Norman further said, that whereas papa could never go out of his house without meeting people who had something to say to him, it was the same elsewhere. Six acquaintances he had met unexpectedly in London, and two at Portsmouth.",due time return look good journey be tell school master introduction nice look boy own age eloquent wonder dockyard block machinery go transact business british intend see be tear marble serve bring next morning visit bull say papa go house meet person have say same acquaintance meet 
38,"So the conversation went on all the evening, to the great delight of all. It was more about things than people, though Flora inquired after Mr. Ernescliffe, and was told he had met them at the station, had been everywhere with them, and had dined at the Mackenzies’ each day. “How was he looking?” Ethel asked; and was told pretty much the same as when he went away; and, on a further query from Flora, it appeared that an old naval friend of his father’s had hopes of a ship, and had promised to have him with him, and thereupon warm hopes were expressed that Harry might have a berth in the same.",conversation go evening great delight more thing person inquire tell meet station dine day look ask tell same go further query appear old naval friend father have hope ship promise have warm hope express have berth same

41,"When they went up at night, every one felt that half the say had not been said, and there were fresh beginnings on the stairs. Norman triumphantly gave the key to Richard, and then called to Ethel, “I say, won’t you come into my room while I unpack?”",go night one feel say say be fresh beginning stair give key call say come room unpack

I think I should tell you I repeated what, perhaps, you did not mean me to hear--you talked to yourself something of pitying Ernescliffe.” The doctor smiled again at the boy’s high-minded openness, which must have cost an effort of self-humiliation. “I can’t say little pitchers have long ears, to a May-pole like you, Norman,” said he; “I think I ought rather to apologise for having inadvertently tumbled in among your secrets; I assure you I did not come to spy you.”",right mind say surprise see sorrowful face become same moment return red say put pocket book papa think tell repeat mean hear talk pity doctor smile boy high minded openness cost effort self humiliation say little pitcher have long ear pole say think apologise tumble secret assure come spy

It makes my heart ache to think of it, come what may, as far as I can see, and without her to judge. The only comfort is, that poor Margaret herself knows nothing of it, and is at peace so far.
