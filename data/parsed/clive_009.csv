1,CHAPTER 8. The Grand Assault.,chapter grand 
2," The 14th of November was a Mohammedan festival, and Riza Sahib determined to utilize the enthusiasm and fanatic zeal, which such an occasion always excites among the followers of the Prophet, to make his grand assault upon Arcot, and to attack at three o'clock in the morning. Every preparation was made on the preceding day, and four strong columns told off for the assault. Two of these were to attack by the breaches, the other two at the gates. Rafts were prepared to enable the party attacking by the new breach to cross the moat, while the columns advancing against the gates were to be preceded by elephants, who, with iron plates on their foreheads, were to charge and batter down the gates.",14th festival determine utilize enthusiasm fanatic zeal occasion excite follower make grand assault attack o'clock morning preparation make preced day strong column tell assault attack breach other gate raft prepare enable party attack new breach cross moat column advance gate precede elephant iron plate forehead charge batter gate 
3,"Clive's spies brought him news of the intended assault, and at midnight he learned full particulars as to the disposition of the enemy. His force was now reduced to eighty Europeans, and a hundred and twenty Sepoys. Every man was told off to his post, and then, sentries being posted to arouse them at the approach of the enemy, the little garrison lay down in their places, to get two or three hours' sleep before the expected attack.",spy bring news intend assault midnight learn full particular disposition enemy force reduce sepoy man tell post sentry post arouse approach enemy little garrison lay place get hour sleep expect attack 
4,"At three o'clock, the firing of three shells from the mortars into the fort gave the signal for assault. The men leaped up and stood to their arms, full of confidence in their ability to resist the attack. Soon the shouts of the advancing columns testified to the equal confidence and ardour of the assailants.",o'clock fire shell mortar fort give signal assault man leap stand arm full confidence ability resist attack shout advance column testify equal confidence ardour assailant 
5,"Not a sound was heard within the walls of the fort, until the elephants advanced towards the gates. Then suddenly a stream of fire leaped out from loophole and battlement. So well directed and continuous was the fire, that the elephants, dismayed at the outburst of fire and noise, and smarting from innumerable wounds, turned and dashed away, trampling in their flight multitudes of men in the dense columns packed behind them. These, deprived of the means upon which they had relied to break in the gates, turned and retreated rapidly.",sound hear wall fort elephant advance gate stream fire leap loophole battlement direct continuous fire elephant dismay outburst fire noise smart innumerable wound turn dash trample flight multitude man dense column pack deprive means rely break gate turn retreat 
6,"Scarcely less prolonged was the struggle at the breaches. At the first breach, a very strong force of the enemy marched resolutely forward. They were permitted, without a shot being fired at them, to cross the dry ditch, mount the shattered debris of the wall, and pour into the interior of the fort. Forward they advanced until, without a check, they reached the first trench bristling with spikes.",prolonged struggle breach first breach strong force enemy march permit shot fire cross dry ditch mount shattered debris wall pour interior fort advance check reach first trench bristle spike 
7,"Then, as they paused for a moment, from the breastwork in front of them, from the ramparts, and every spot which commanded the trench, a storm of musketry was poured on them; while the gunners swept the crowded mass with grape, and bags of bullets. The effect was tremendous. Mowed down in heaps, the assailants recoiled; and then, without a moment's hesitation, turned and fled. Three times, strongly reinforced, they advanced to the attack; but were each time repulsed, with severe slaughter.",pause moment breastwork front rampart spot command trench storm musketry pour gunner sweep crowded mass grape bag bullet effect tremendous mow heap assailant recoil moment hesitation turn flead time reinforce advance attack time repulse severe slaughter 
8,"Still less successful were those at the other breach. A great raft, capable of carrying seventy, conveyed the head of the storming party across the ditch; and they had just reached the foot of the breach, when Clive, who was himself at this point, turned two field pieces upon them, with deadly effect. The raft was upset and smashed, and the column, deprived of its intended means of crossing the ditch, desisted from the attack.",successful other breach great raft capable carry convey head storming party ditch reach foot breach point turn field piece deadly effect raft upset smash column deprive intend means cross ditch desisted attack 
9,"Among those who had fallen, at the great breach, was the commander of the storming party; a man of great valour. Four hundred of his followers had also been killed, and Riza Sahib, utterly disheartened at his repulse at all points, decided not to renew the attack. He had still more than twenty men to each of the defenders; but the obstinacy of their resistance, and the moral effect produced by it upon his troops; the knowledge that the Mahratta horse were hovering in his rear, and that Kilpatrick's little column was close at hand; determined him to raise the siege.",fall great breach commander storm party man great valour follower kill dishearten repulse point decide renew attack have more man defender obstinacy resistance moral effect produce troops knowledge horse hover rear little column close hand determine raise siege 
10,"After the repulse of the assault, the heavy musketry fire from the houses around the fort was continued. At two in the afternoon he asked for two hours' truce, to bury the dead. This was granted, and on its conclusion the musketry fire was resumed, and continued until two in the morning. Then suddenly, it ceased. Under cover of the fire, Riza Sahib had raised the siege, and retired with his army to Vellore.",repulse assault heavy musketry fire house fort continue afternoon ask hour truce bury dead grant conclusion musketry fire resume continue morning cease cover fire raise siege retire army 
11,"On the morning of the 15th, Clive discovered that the enemy had disappeared. The joy of the garrison was immense. Every man felt proud, and happy in the thought that he had taken his share in a siege, which would not only be memorable in English history till the end of time, but which had literally saved India to us. The little band made the fort re-echo with their cheers, when the news came in. Caps were thrown high in the air, and the men indulged in every demonstration of delight.",morning 15th discover enemy disappear joy garrison immense man feel proud happy thought take share siege memorable english history end time save little band make fort re-echo cheer news come cap throw air man indulge demonstration delight 
12,"Clive was not a man to lose time. The men were at once formed up, and marched into the abandoned camp of the enemy; where they found four guns, four mortars, and a great quantity of ammunition. A cloud of dust was seen approaching, and soon a mounted officer, riding forward, announced the arrival of Captain Kilpatrick's detachment.",man lose time man form march abandon camp enemy find gun mortar great quantity ammunition cloud dust see approach mount officer ride announce arrival detachment 
13,"Not a moment was lost, for Clive felt the importance of, at once, following up the blow inflicted by the repulse of the enemy. Three days were spent, in continuous labour, in putting the fort of Arcot again in a position of defence; and, leaving Kilpatrick in charge there, he marched out with two hundred Europeans, seven hundred Sepoys, and three guns, and attacked and took Timari, the little fort which before baffled him.",moment lose feel importance follow blow inflict repulse enemy day spend continuous labour put fort position defence leave charge march sepoy gun attack take little fort baffle 
14,"This done, he returned towards Arcot to await the arrival of a thousand Mahratta horse, which Murari Reo had promised him. When these arrived, however, they proved unwilling to accompany him. Upon their way, they had fallen in with a portion of Riza Sahib's retreating force, and had been worsted in the attack; and as the chance of plunder seemed small, while the prospect of hard blows was certain, the free-booting horsemen refused, absolutely, to join in the pursuit of the retreating enemy.",do return await arrival horse promise arrive prove unwilling accompany way fall portion retreating force worst attack chance plunder seem small prospect hard blow certain free booting horsemen refuse join pursuit retreat enemy 
15,"Just at this moment, the news came in that reinforcements from Pondicherry were marching to meet Riza Sahib at Arni, a place seventeen miles south of Arcot, twenty south of Vellore. It was stated that, with these reinforcements, a large sum of money was being brought, for the use of Riza Sahib's army. When the Mahrattas heard the news, the chance of booty at once altered their intentions, and they declared themselves ready to follow Clive. The greater portion of them, however, had dispersed, plundering over the country, and great delay was caused before they could be collected. When six hundred of them had been brought together, Clive determined to wait no longer, but started at once for Arni.",moment news come reinforcement march meet place mile state reinforcement large sum money bring use army hear news chance booty alter intention declare ready follow great portion disperse plunder country great delay cause collect bring determine wait start 
16,"The delay enabled Riza Sahib, marching down from Vellore, to meet his reinforcements; and when Clive, after a forced march of twenty miles, approached Arni, he found the enemy, composed of three hundred French troops, two thousand five hundred Sepoys, and two thousand horsemen, with four guns, drawn up before it. Seeing their immense superiority in numbers, these advanced to the attack.",delay enable march meet reinforcement force march mile approach find enemy compose french troops sepoy horsemen gun draw see immense superiority number advance attack 
17,"Clive determined to await them where he stood. The position was an advantageous one. He occupied a space of open ground, some three hundred yards in width. On his right flank was a village, on the left a grove of palm trees. In front of the ground he occupied were rice fields, which, it being the wet season, were very swampy, and altogether impracticable for guns. These fields were crossed by a causeway which led to the village, but as it ran at an angle across them, those advancing upon it were exposed to the fire of the English front. Clive posted the Sepoys in the village, the Mahratta horsemen in the grove, and the two hundred English, with the guns, on the ground between them.",determine await stand position advantageous one occupy space open ground yard width right flank village left grove palm tree front ground occupy rice field wet season swampy impracticable gun field cross causeway lead village run angle advance expose fire english front post village horsemen grove gun ground 
18,"The enemy advanced at once. His native cavalry, with some infantry, marched against the grove; while the French troops, with about fifteen hundred infantry, moved along the causeway against the village.",enemy advance native cavalry infantry march grove french troops infantry move causeway village 
19,"The fight began on the English left. There the Mahratta cavalry fought bravely. Issuing from the palm grove, they made repeated charges against the greatly superior forces of the enemy. But numbers told, and the Mahrattas, fighting fiercely, were driven back into the palm grove; where they, with difficulty, maintained themselves.",fight begin left cavalry fight issue palm grove make repeat charge superior force enemy number tell fight drive palm grove difficulty maintain 
20,"In the meantime, the fight was going on at the centre. Clive opened fire with his guns on the long column marching, almost across his front, to attack the village. The enemy, finding themselves exposed to a fire which they were powerless to answer, quitted the causeway, and formed up in the rice fields fronting the English position. The guns, protected only by a few Frenchmen and natives, remained on the causeway.",meantime fight go centre open fire gun long column march front attack village enemy find expose fire powerless answer quit causeway form rice field front english position gun protect few native remain causeway 
21,"Clive now despatched two of his guns, and fifty English, to aid the hard-pressed Mahrattas in the grove; and fifty others to the village, with orders to join the Sepoys there, to dash forward on to the causeway, and charge the enemy's guns.",despatch gun aid hard press grove other village order join dash causeway charge enemy gun 
22,"As the column issued from the village along the causeway, at a rapid pace, the French limbered up their guns and retired at a gallop. The infantry, dispirited at their disappearance, fell back across the rice fields; an example which their horsemen on their right, already dispirited by the loss which they were suffering, from the newly-arrived English musketry and the discharges of the field pieces, followed without delay.",column issue village causeway rapid pace limber gun retire gallop infantry dispirite disappearance fall rice field example horsemen right dispirite loss suffer arrive english musketry discharge field piece follow delay 
23,"Clive at once ordered a pursuit. The Mahrattas were despatched after the enemy's cavalry, while he himself, with his infantry, advanced across the causeway and pressed upon the main body. Three times the enemy made a stand, but each time failed to resist the impetuosity of the pursuers, and the night alone put a stop to the pursuit, by which time the enemy were completely routed.",order pursuit despatch enemy cavalry infantry advance causeway press main body time enemy make stand time fail resist impetuosity pursuer night put stop pursuit time enemy rout 
24,"The material loss had not been heavy, for but fifty French and a hundred and fifty natives were killed or wounded; but the army was broken up, the morale of the enemy completely destroyed; and it was proved to all Southern India, which was anxiously watching the struggle, that the English were, in the field of battle, superior to their European rivals. This assurance alone had an immense effect. It confirmed, in their alliance with the English, many of the chiefs whose friendship had hitherto been lukewarm; and brought over many waverers to our side.",material loss heavy french native kill wound army break morale enemy destroy prove southern watch struggle field battle superior european rival assurance have immense effect confirm alliance many chief friendship lukewarm bring many waverer side 
25,"In the fight, eight Sepoys and fifty of the Mahratta cavalry were killed or disabled. The English did not lose a single man. Many of Riza Sahib's soldiers came in, during the next few days, and enlisted in the British force. The Mahrattas captured the treasure, the prospect of which had induced them to join in the fight, and the governor of Arni agreed to hold the town for Muhammud Ali.",fight sepoy cavalry kill disabled lose single man many soldier come next few day enlist british force capture treasure prospect induce join fight governor agree hold town 
26,"Clive moved on at once to Conjeveram, where thirty French troops and three hundred Sepoys occupied the temple, a very strong building. Clive brought up two eighteen-pounders from Madras, and pounded the walls; and the enemy, seeing that the place must fall, evacuated it in the night, and retired to Pondicherry. North Arcot being now completely in the power of the English, Clive returned to Madras; and then sailed to Fort Saint David, to concert measures with Mr. Saunders for the relief of Trichinopoli. This place still held out, thanks rather to the feebleness and indecision of Colonel Law, who commanded the besiegers, than to any effort on the part of the defenders.",move french troops occupy temple strong building bring pounder pound wall enemy see place fall evacuate night retire power return sail concert measure relief place hold thanks feebleness indecision command besieger effort part defender 
27,"Governor Dupleix, at Pondicherry, had seen with surprise the result of Clive's dash upon Arcot. He had, however, perceived that the operations there were wholly secondary, and that Trichinopoli was still the all-important point. The fall of that place would more than neutralize Clive's successes at Arcot; and he, therefore, did not suffer Clive's operations to distract his attention here. Strong reinforcements and a battering train were sent forward to the besiegers; and, by repeated messages, he endeavoured to impress upon Law and Chunda Sahib the necessity of pressing forward the capture of Trichinopoli.",see surprise result dash perceive operation secondary important point fall place neutralize success suffer operation distract attention strong reinforcement battering train send besieger repeat message endeavour impress necessity press capture 
28,"But Dupleix was unfortunate in his instruments. Law was always hesitating and doubting. Chunda Sahib, although clever to plan, was weak in action; indecisive, at moments when it was most necessary that he should be firm. So then, in spite of the entreaties of Dupleix, he had detached a considerable force to besiege Clive. Dupleix, seeing this, and hoping that Clive might be detained at Arcot long enough to allow of the siege of Trichinopoli being brought to a conclusion, had sent the three hundred French soldiers to strengthen the force of Riza Sahib.",unfortunate instrument law hesitate doub clever plan weak action indecisive moment necessary firm spite entreaty detach considerable force besiege see hope detain allow siege bring conclusion send french soldier strengthen force 
29,"He had still an overpowering force at Trichinopoli, Law having nine hundred trained French soldiers, a park of fifty guns, two thousand Sepoys, and the army of Chunda Sahib, twenty thousand strong. Inside Trichinopoli were a few English soldiers under Captain Cope, and a small body of troops of Muhammud Ali; while outside the walls, between them and the besiegers, was the English force under Gingen, the men utterly dispirited, the officer without talent, resolution, or confidence.",overpowering force have train french soldier park gun army strong few english soldier small body troops wall besieger english force man dispirite officer talent resolution confidence 
30,"Before leaving the troops with which he had won the battle of Arni, Clive had expressed, to the two young writers, his high appreciation of their conduct during the siege of Arcot; and promised them that he would make it a personal request, to the authorities at Fort Saint David, that they might be permanently transferred from the civil to the military branch of the service; and such a request, made by him, was certain to be complied with. He strongly advised them to spend every available moment of their time in the study of the native language; as, without that, they would be useless if appointed to command a body of Sepoys.",leave troops win battle express young writer high appreciation conduct siege promise make personal request authority transfer civil military branch service request make certain complie advise spend available moment time study native language useless appoint command body 
31,"Delighted at the prospect, now open to them, of a permanent relief from the drudgery of a clerk's life in Madras, the young fellows were in the highest spirits; and Tim Kelly was scarcely less pleased, when he heard that Charlie was now likely to be always employed with him. The boys lost not a moment in sending down to Madras, to engage the services of a native ""moonshee"" or teacher. They wrote to their friend Johnson, asking him to arrange terms with the man who understood most English, and to engage him to remain with them some time.",delight prospect open permanent relief drudgery clerk life young fellow high spirit pleased hear likely employ boy lose moment send engage service native moonshee teacher write friend ask arrange term man understand most engage remain time 
32,"A few days later, Tim Kelly came in.",few day come 
33,"""Plase, yer honors, there's a little shrivelled atomy of a man outside, as wants to spake wid ye. He looks for all the world like a monkey, wrapped up in white clothes, but he spakes English after a fashion, and has brought this letter for you.

35,"""Moonshine, is it! By jabers, and it's a mighty poor compliment to the moon to call him so. And is it the language you're going to larn now? Shure, Mr. Charles, I wouldn't demane myself by larning the lingo of these black hathens. Isn't for them to larn the English, and mighty pleased they ought to be, to get themselves to spake like Christians.""",jaber mighty poor compliment moon call language go larn demane larn lingo black hathen larn pleased get spake

I've tried it myself, over and over again.""",larn say get point bottle water fire else want swear understand try 
38,"""There, Tim, it's no use standing talking any longer. Bring in the moonshee.""",use standing talk bring moonshee 
39,"From that moment, the little man had his permanent post in a corner of the boys' room; and, when they were not on duty, they were constantly engaged in studying the language, writing down the names of every object they came across and getting it by heart, and learning every sentence, question, and answer which occurred to them as likely to be useful.",moment little man have permanent post corner boy room duty engage study language write name object come get heart learn sentence question answer occur likely useful 
40,"As for Tim, he quite lost patience at this devotion to study on the part of his master; who, he declared to his comrades, went on just as if he intended to become a nigger and a hathen himself.",lose patience devotion study part master declare comrade go intend become nigger hathen 
41,"""It's just awful to hear him, Corporal M'Bean, jabbering away in that foreign talk, with that little black monkey moonshine. The little cratur a-twisting his shrivelled fingers about, that looks as if the bones were coming through the skin. I wonder what the good father at Blarney, where I come from, you know, Corporal, would say to sich goings on. Faith, then, and if he were here, I'd buy a bottle of holy water, and sprinkle it over the little hathen. I suspict he'd fly straight up the chimney, when it touched him.""",awful hear jabber foreign talk little black monkey moonshine little cratur a twist shrivell finger look bone come skin wonder good father come know say sich going faith buy bottle holy water sprinkle little hathen suspict fly chimney touch 
42,"""My opinion of you, Tim Kelly,"" the corporal, who was a grave Scotchman, said; ""is that you're just a fule. Your master is a brave young gentleman, and is a deal more sensible than most of them, who spend all their time in drinking wine and playing cards. A knowledge of the language is most useful. What would you do, yourself, if you were to marry a native woman, and couldn't speak to her afterwards.""",opinion corporal grave say fule master brave young gentleman deal sensible most spend time drink wine playing card knowledge language useful do marry native woman speak 
43,"""The saints defind us!"" Tim exclaimed; ""and what put such an idea in yer head, Corporal? It's nayther more nor less than an insult to suppose that I, a dacent boy, and brought up under the teaching of Father O'Shea, should marry a hathen black woman; and if you weren't my suparior officer, corporal, I'd tach ye better manners.""",saint defind exclaim put idea head nayther more less insult suppose dacent boy bring teaching marry hathen black woman suparior officer corporal tach good manners 
44,"Fortunately, at this moment Charlie's voice was heard, shouting for his servant; and Tim was therefore saved from the breach of the peace, which his indignation showed that he meditated.",moment voice hear shouting servant save breach peace indignation show meditate 
45,"December passed quietly; and then, in January, 1752, an insurrection planned by Dupleix broke out. The governor of Pondicherry had been suffering keenly from disappointments; which, as time went on, and his entreaties and commands to Law to attack Trichinopoli were answered only by excuses and reasons for delay, grew to despair; and he resolved upon making another effort to occupy the attention of the man in whom he already recognized a great rival, and to prevent his taking steps for the relief of Trichinopoli. Law had over and over again assured him that, in the course of a very few weeks, that place would be driven by famine to surrender; and, as soon as Clive arrived at Fort Saint David, Dupleix set about taking steps which would again necessitate his return to the north, and so give to Law the time which he asked for.",pass insurrection plan break governor suffer disappointment time go entreaty command attack answer excuse reason delay grow despair resolve make effort occupy attention man recognize great rival prevent take step relief have assure course few week place drive famine surrender arrive set take step necessitate return north give time ask 
46,"Supplies of money were sent to Riza Sahib, together with four hundred French soldiers. These marched suddenly upon Punemalli and captured it, seized again the fortified temple of Conjeveram, and from this point threatened both Madras and Arcot.",supplie money send french soldier march capture seize fortify temple point threaten 
47,"Had this force possessed an active and determined commander, it could undoubtedly have carried out Dupleix's instructions, captured Madras, and inflicted a terrible blow upon the English. Fortunately, it had no such head. It marched indeed against Madras, plundered and burnt the factories, levied contributions, and obtained possession of everything but the fort; where the civilians, and the few men who constituted the garrison, daily expected to be attacked, in which case the place must have fallen. This, however, the enemy never even attempted, contenting themselves with ravaging the place outside the walls of the fort.",force possess active determined commander carry instruction capture inflict terrible blow have such head march plunder burn factory levie contribution obtain possession fort civilian few man constitute garrison expect attack case place fall enemy attempt content ravage place wall fort 
48,"The little garrison of Arcot, two hundred men in all, were astonished at the news; that the province, which they had thought completely conquered, was again in flames; that the road to Madras was cut, by the occupation of Conjeveram by the French; and that Madras itself was, save the fort, in the hands of the enemy. The fort itself, they knew, might easily be taken, as they were aware that it was defended by only eighty men.",little garrison man astonished news province think conquer flame road cut occupation save fort hand enemy fort know take aware defend man 
49,"The change in the position was at once manifest, in the altered attitude of the fickle population. The main body of the inhabitants of Southern India were Hindoos, who had for centuries been ruled by foreign masters. The Mohammedans from the north had been their conquerors, and the countless wars which had taken place, to them signified merely whether one family or another were to reign over them. The sole desire was for peace and protection; and they, therefore, ever inclined towards the side which seemed strongest. Their sympathies were no stronger with their Mohammedan rulers than with the French or English, and they only hoped that whatever power was strongest might conquer; and that, after the hostilities were over, their daily work might be conducted in peace, and their property and possessions be enjoyed in security. The capture and defence of Arcot, and the battle of Arni, had brought them to regard the English as their final victors; and the signs of deep and even servile respect, which greeted the conquerors wherever they went, and which absolutely disgusted Charlie Marryat and his friend, were really sincere marks of the welcome to masters who seemed able and willing to maintain their rule over them.",change position manifest alter attitude fickle population main body inhabitant southern century rule foreign master north conqueror countless war take place signify family reign sole desire peace protection inclined side seem strong sympathy strong mohammedan ruler french hope power strong conquer hostility daily work conduct peace property possession enjoy security capture defence battle bring regard final victor sign deep servile respect greet conqueror go disgust friend sincere mark welcome master seem able willing maintain rule 
50,"With the news of the successes of Riza Sahib, all this changed. The natives no longer bent to the ground, as the English passed them in the streets. The country people, who had flocked in with their products to the markets, absented themselves altogether, and the whole population prepared to welcome the French as their new masters.",news success change native bend ground pass street country person flock product market absent whole population prepare welcome new master 
51,"In the fort, the utmost vigilance was observed. The garrison laboured to mend the breaches, and complete the preparations for defence. Provisions were again stored up, and they awaited anxiously news from Clive.",fort utmost vigilance observe garrison laboure mend breach complete preparation defence provision store await news 
52,"That enterprising officer was at Fort Saint David, busy in making his preparations for a decisive campaign against the enemy round Trichinopoli, when the news of the rising reached him. He was expecting a considerable number of fresh troops from England, as it was in January that the majority of the reinforcements despatched by the Company arrived in India; and Mr. Saunders had written to Calcutta, begging that a hundred men might be sent thence. These were now, with the eighty men at Madras, and the two hundred at Arcot, all the force that could be at his disposal, for at Fort Saint David there was not a single available man.",enterprising officer busy make preparation decisive campaign enemy news rising reach expect considerable number fresh troops majority reinforcement despatch company arrive write begg man send man force disposal be single available man 
53,"With all the efforts that Clive, aided by the authorities, could make, it was not until the middle of February that he had completed his arrangements. On the 9th, the hundred men arrived from Bengal, and, without the loss of a day, Clive started from Madras to form a junction with the garrison from Arcot, who, leaving only a small force to hold the fort, had moved down to meet him.",effort aid authority make middle complete arrangement 9th man arrive loss day start form junction garrison leave small force hold fort move meet
