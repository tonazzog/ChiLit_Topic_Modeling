1,CHAPTER 3. A Brush With Privateers.,chapter brush 
2," The night passed quietly. Once or twice lights were seen, as the schooners showed a lantern for a moment to notify their exact position to each other.",night pass light see schooner show lantern moment notify exact position other 
3,"As soon as dawn broke, every man on board the Lizzie Anderson was at his post. The schooners had drawn up a little, but were still under easy sail. The moment that the day grew clear enough for it to be perceived that no other sail could be seen above the horizon, fresh sail was spread upon the schooners, and they began rapidly to draw up.",dawn break man board post schooner draw little easy sail moment day grow clear perceive other sail see horizon fresh sail spread schooner begin draw 
4,"On the previous evening the four heavy guns had been brought aft, and the Indiaman could have made a long running fight with her opponents, had the captain been disposed. To this, however, he objected strongly, as his vessel was sure to be hulled and knocked about severely, and perhaps some of his masts cut down. He was confident in his power to beat off the two privateers, and he therefore did not add a stitch of canvas to the easy sail under which he had been holding on all night.",previous evening heavy gun bring make long run fight opponent captain dispose object vessel sure hull knock mast cut confident power beat privateer add stitch canvas easy sail hold night 
5,"Presently a puff of smoke shot out from the bow of the schooner from the weather quarter, followed almost instantaneously by one from her consort. Two round shot struck up the water, the one under the Indiaman's stern, the other under her forefoot.",puff smoke shoot bow schooner weather quarter follow consort round shot strike water one stern other forefoot 
6,"""The rascals are well within range,"" the captain said quietly. ""See, they are taking off canvas again. They intend to keep at that distance, and hammer away at us. Just what I thought would be their tactics.""",rascal range captain say see take canvas intend keep distance hammer think tactic 
7,"Two more shots were fired by the schooners. One flew over the deck between the masts, and plunged harmlessly in the sea beyond. The other struck the hull with a dull crash.",more shot fire schooner fly deck mast plunge sea other strike hull dull crash 
8,"""It is lucky the ladies were sent into the hold,"" the captain said. ""That shot has gone right through their cabin.",lucky lady send hold captain say shot go cabin 
9,"""Now, my lads, have you got the sights well upon them? Fire!""",lad get sight fire 
10,"The four thirty-two pounders spoke out almost at the same moment, and all gazed over the bulwarks anxiously to watch the effect, and a cheer arose as it was seen how accurate had been the aim of the gunners. One shot struck the schooner to windward in the bow, a foot or two above the water level. Another went through her foresail, close to the mast.",pounder speak same moment gaze bulwark watch effect cheer arise see accurate aim gunner shot strike schooner windward bow foot water level go foresail close mast 
11,"""A foot more, and you would have cut his foremast asunder.""",foot cut foremast 
12,"The vessel to leeward had been struck by only one shot, the other passing under her stern. She was struck just above her deck line, the shot passing through the bulwark, and, as they thought on board the merchantman, narrowly missing if not actually striking the mainmast.",vessel leeward strike shot other pass stern strike deck line shot pass bulwark think board merchantman miss strike mainmast 
13,"""There is some damage done,"" Dr. Rae said, keeping his glass fixed on the vessel. ""There is a good deal of running about on deck there.""",be damage do say keep glass fix vessel be good deal run deck 
14,"It was evident that the display of the heavy metal carried by the Indiaman was an unpleasant surprise to the privateers. Both lowered sail and ceased firing, and there was then a rapid exchange of signals between them.",evident display heavy metal carry unpleasant surprise privateer lower sail cease fire be rapid exchange signal 
15,"""They don't like it,"" the captain said, laughing. ""They see that they cannot play the game they expected, and that they've got to take as well as to give. Now it depends upon the sort of stuff their captains are made of, whether they give it up at once, or come straight up to close quarters.",like captain say laugh see play game expect get take give depend sort stuff captain make give come close quarter 
16,"""Ah! They mean fighting.""",mean fighting 
17,"As he spoke, a cloud of canvas was spread upon the schooners and, sailing more than two feet to the merchantman's one, they ran quickly down towards her, firing rapidly as they came. Only the merchantman's heavy guns replied, but these worked steadily and coolly, and did considerable damage. The bowsprit of one of their opponents was shot away. The sails of both vessels were pierced in several places, and several ragged holes were knocked in their hulls.",speak cloud canvas spread schooner sail more foot merchantman run fire come merchantman heavy gun reply work do considerable damage bowsprit opponent shoot sail vessel pierce several place several ragged hole knock hull 
18,"""If it were not that I do not wish to sacrifice any of the lives on board, unnecessarily,"" the captain said, ""I would let them come alongside and try boarding. We have a strong crew, and with the sixty soldiers we should give them such a reception as they do not dream of. However, I will keep them off, if I can.",wish sacrifice life board captain say let come try board have strong crew soldier give reception dream keep 
19,"""Now, Mr. James,"" he said to the first officer, ""I propose to give that vessel to leeward a dose. They are keeping about abreast, and by the course they are making will range alongside at about a cable's length. When I give the word, pour a broadside with the guns to port upon that weather schooner.",say first officer propose give vessel leeward dose keep abreast course make range cable length give word pour broadside gun port weather schooner 
20,"""At that moment, gentlemen,"" he said, turning to the passengers, ""I shall rely upon you to pick off the steersman of the other vessel, and to prevent another taking his place. She steers badly now, and the moment her helm is free, she'll run up into the wind. As she does so, I shall bear off, run across her bow, and rake her deck with grape as we pass.",moment gentleman say turn passenger rely pick steersman other vessel prevent take place steer moment helm free run wind do bear run bow rake deck grape pass 
21,"""Will you, Mr. Barlow, order your men to be in readiness to open fire with musketry upon her, as we pass?""",order man readiness open fire musketry pass 
22,"The schooners were now running rapidly down upon the Indiaman. They were only able to use the guns in their bows, and the fire of the Indiaman from the heavy guns on her quarter was inflicting more damage than she received.",schooner run able use gun bow fire heavy gun quarter inflict more damage receive 
23,"""Let all hands lie down on deck,"" the captain ordered. ""They will open with their broadside guns, as they come up. When I give the word, let all the guns on the port side be trained at the foot of her mainmast, and fire as you get the line. On the starboard side, lie down till I give the word.""",let hand lie deck captain order open broadside gun come give word let gun port side train foot mainmast fire get line starboard side lie give word 
24,"It was a pretty sight as the schooners, throwing the water high up from their sharp cut-waters, came running along, heeling over under the breeze. As they ranged alongside, their topsails came down, and a broadside from both was poured into the Indiaman. The great ship shook as the shot crashed into her, and several sharp cries told of the effect which had been produced.",pretty sight schooner throw water sharp cut water come run heel breeze rang topsail come broadside pour great ship shake shot crash several sharp cry tell effect produce 
25,"Then the captain gave the word, and a moment afterwards an irregular broadside, as the captain of each gun brought his piece to bear, was poured into the schooner from the guns on the port side. As the privateer heeled over, her deck could be plainly seen, and the shot of the Indiaman, all directed at one point, tore up a hole around the foot of the mainmast. In an instant the spar tottered and, with a crash, fell alongside. At the same moment, three of the passengers took a steady aim over the bulwark at the helmsman of the other privateer and, simultaneously with the reports of their pieces, the man was seen to fall. Another sprang forward to take his place, but again the rifles spoke out, and he fell beside his comrade.",captain give word moment irregular broadside captain gun bring piece bear pour schooner gun port side privateer heeled deck see shot direct point tore hole foot mainmast instant spar totter crash fall same moment passenger take steady aim bulwark helmsman other privateer report piece man see fall spring take place rifle speak fall comrade 
26,"Freed from the strain which had counteracted the pressure of her mainsail, the schooner flew up into the wind. The Indiaman held on her course for another length, and then her helm was put up, and she swept down across the bows of the privateer. Then the men leaped to their feet, the soldiers lined the bulwarks, and as she passed along a few yards only distant from her foe, each gun poured a storm of grape along her crowded deck, while the troops and passengers kept up a continuous fire of musketry.",freed strain counteract pressure mainsail schooner fly wind hold course length helm put sweep bow privateer man leap foot soldier line bulwark pass few yard distant foe gun pour storm grape crowded deck troops passenger keep continuous fire musketry 
27,"""That will do,"" the captain said, quietly. ""Now we may keep her on her course. They have had more than enough of it.""",do captain say keep course have more enough 
28,"There was no doubt of that, for the effect of the iron storm had been terrible, and the decks of the schooner were strewn with dead and dying. For a time after the merchantman had borne upon her course, the sails of the schooner flapped wildly in the wind, and then the foremast went suddenly over the side.",be doubt effect iron storm terrible deck schooner strewn dead die time merchantman borne course sail schooner flapp wind foremast go side 
29,"""I should think you could take them both, Captain Thompson,"" one of the passengers said.",think take passenger say 
30,"""They are as good as taken,"" the captain answered, ""and would be forced to haul down their flags, if I were to wear round and continue the fight. But they would be worse than useless to me. I should not know what to do with their crews, and should have to cripple myself by putting very strong prize crews upon them, and so run the risk of losing my own ship and cargo.",good take captain answer force haul flag wear continue fight bad useless know do crew have cripple put strong prize crew run risk lose own ship cargo 
31,"""No, my business is to trade and not to fight. If any one meddle with me, I am ready to take my own part; but the Company would not thank me, if I were to risk the safety of this ship and her valuable cargo for the sake of sending home a couple of prizes, which might be recaptured as they crossed the bay, and would not fetch any great sum if they got safely in port.""",business trade fight one meddle ready take own part company thank risk safety ship valuable cargo sake send couple prize recapture cross bay fetch great sum get port 
32,"An examination showed that the casualties on board the Lizzie Anderson amounted to three killed and eight wounded. The former were sewn in hammocks, with a round shot at their feet, and dropped overboard; the clergyman reading the burial service. The wounded were carried below, and attended to by the ship's surgeon and Doctor Rae. The ship's decks were washed, and all traces of the conflict removed. The guns were again lashed in their places, carpenters were lowered over the side to repair damages; and when the ladies came on deck an hour after the conflict was over, two or three ragged holes in the bulwarks, and a half dozen in the sails, were the sole signs that the ship had been in action; save that some miles astern could be seen the two crippled privateers, with all sails lowered, at work to repair damages.",examination show casualty board amount kill wound former sew hammock round shot foot drop clergyman read burial service wound carry attend ship surgeon ship deck wash trace conflict remove gun lash place carpenter lower side repair damage lady come deck hour conflict ragged hole bulwark half sail sole sign ship action save mile astern see crippled privateer sail lower work repair damage 
33,"Two or three days afterwards, Charlie Marryat and his friend Peters were sitting beside Doctor Rae, when the latter said:",day friend sit latter say 
34,"""I hope that we sha'n't find the French in Madras, when we get there.""",hope find get 
35,"""The French in Madras!"" Charlie exclaimed in surprise. ""Why, sir, there's no chance of that, is there?""",exclaim surprise sir be chance 
36,"""A very great chance,"" the doctor said. ""Don't you know that they captured the place three years ago?""",great chance doctor say know capture place year 
37,"""No, sir; I'm ashamed to say that I know nothing at all about India, except that the Company have trading stations at Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta.""",sir ashamed say know company have trading station 
38,"""I will tell you about it,"" the doctor said. ""It is as well that you should understand the position of affairs, at the place to which you are going. You must know that the Company hold the town of Madras, and a few square miles of land around it, as tenants of the Nawab of the Carnatic, which is the name of that part of India. The French have a station at Pondicherry, eighty-six miles to the sou'west of Madras. This is a larger and more important town than Madras, and of course the greatest rivalry prevails between the English and French.",tell doctor say understand position affair place go know company hold town few square mile land tenant name part have station mile sou'west large important town course great rivalry prevail english 
39,"""The French are much more powerful than the English, and exercise a predominating influence throughout the Carnatic. The French governor, Monsieur Dupleix, is a man of very great ability, and far-seeing views. He has a considerable force of French soldiers at his command, and by the aid which he has given to the nawab, upon various occasions, he has obtained a predominating influence in his councils.",powerful exercise predominate influence french governor man great ability see view have considerable force french soldier command aid give nawab various occasion obtain predominate influence council 
40,"""When war was declared between England and France, in the year '44, the English squadron under Commodore Barnet was upon the coast, and the Company sent out orders to Mr. Morse, the governor of Madras, to use every effort to destroy the French settlement, of whose rising power they felt the greatest jealousy. Dupleix, seeing the force that could be brought against him, and having no French ships on the station, although he was aware that a fleet under Admiral La Bourdonnais was fitting out and would arrive shortly, dreaded the contest, and proposed to Mr. Morse that the Indian colonies of the two nations should remain neutral, and take no part in the struggle in which their respective countries were engaged. Mr. Morse, however, in view of the orders he had received from the Company, was unable to agree to this.",war declare year english squadron coast company send order governor use effort destroy french settlement rise power feel great jealousy see force bring have french ship station aware fleet fit arrive dread contest propose indian colony nation remain neutral take part struggle respective country engage view order receive unable agree 
41,"""Dupleix then applied to the nawab who, at his request, forbade his European tenants to make war on land with each other, an order which they were obliged to obey.",apply nawab request forbid european tenant make war land other order oblige obey 
42,"""In July, 1746, La Bourdonnais arrived with his fleet, and chased the small English squadron from the Indian seas. Dupleix now changed his tactics, and regardless of the injunction which he himself had obtained from the nawab, he determined to crush the English at Madras. He supplied the fleet with men and money, and ordered the admiral to sail for Madras. The fleet arrived before the town on the 14th of September; landed a portion of its troops, six hundred in number, with two guns, a short distance along the coast; and on the following day disembarked the rest, consisting of a thousand French troops, four hundred Sepoys, and three hundred African troops, and summoned Madras to surrender.",arrive fleet chase small english squadron indian sea change tactic injunction obtain nawab determine crush supply fleet man money order admiral sail fleet arrive town 14th land portion troops number gun short distance coast follow day disembark rest consist french troops african troops summon surrender 
43,"""Madras was in no position to offer any effectual resistance. The fort was weak and indefensible. The English inhabitants consisted only of a hundred civilians, and two hundred soldiers. Governor Morse endeavoured to obtain, from the nawab, the protection which he had before granted to Dupleix, a demand which the nawab at once refused.",position offer effectual resistance fort weak indefensible english inhabitant consist civilian soldier endeavour obtain nawab protection have grant demand nawab refuse 
44,"""I was there at the time, and quite agreed with the governor that it was useless to attempt resistance to the force brought against us. The governor, therefore, surrendered on the 21st. The garrison, and all the civilians in the place not in the service of the Company, were to become prisoners of war; while those in the regular service of the Company were free to depart, engaging only not to carry arms against the French until exchanged. These were the official conditions; but La Bourdonnais, influenced by jealousy of Dupleix, and by the promise of a bribe of forty thousand pounds, made a secret condition with Mr. Morse, by which he bound himself to restore Madras in the future, upon the payment of a large sum of money. This agreement Dupleix, whose heart was set upon the total expulsion of the English, refused to ratify.",time agree governor useless attempt resistance force bring governor surrender 21st garrison civilian place service become prisoner war regular service company free depart engage carry arm exchange official condition influence jealousy promise bribe pound make secret condition bind restore future payment large sum money agreement heart set total expulsion refuse ratify 
45,"""A good many of us considered that, by this breach of the agreement, we were released from our parole not to carry arms against the French; and a dozen or so of us, in various disguises, escaped from Madras and made our way to Fort Saint David, a small English settlement twelve miles south of Pondicherry. I made the journey with a young fellow named Clive, who had come out as a writer about two years before. He was a fine young fellow; as unfitted as you are, I should think, Marryat, for the dull life of a writer, but full of energy and courage.",good many consider breach agreement release parole carry arm various disguise escape make way small english settlement mile make journey young fellow name come writer year fine young fellow unfitt think dull life writer full energy courage 
46,"""At Fort Saint David we found two hundred English soldiers, and a hundred Sepoys, and a number of us, having nothing to do at our own work, volunteered to aid in the defence.",find english soldier number have do own work volunteer aid defence 
47,"""After Dupleix had conquered Madras, the nawab awoke to the fact of the danger of allowing the French to become all-powerful, by the destruction of the English, and ordered Dupleix to restore the place. Dupleix refused, and the nawab sent his son Maphuz Khan to invest the town. Dupleix at once despatched a detachment of two hundred and thirty French, and seven hundred Sepoys, commanded by an engineer officer named Paradis, to raise the siege.",conquer nawab awoke fact danger allow become powerful destruction order restore place refuse nawab send son invest town despatch detachment french sepoy command engineer officer name raise siege 
48,"""On the 2nd of November, the garrison of Madras sallied out and drove away the cavalry of Maphuz Khan; and on the 4th, Paradis attacked his army, and totally defeated it.",2nd garrison sall drive cavalry 4th attack army defeat 
49,"""This, lads, was a memorable battle. It is the first time that European and Indian soldiers have come into contest, and it shows how immense is the superiority of Europeans. What Paradis did then opens all sorts of possibilities for the future; and it may be that either we or the French are destined to rise, from mere trading companies, to be rulers of Indian states.",lad memorable battle first time european indian soldier come contest show immense superiority do open sort possibility future destine rise mere trading company ruler indian state 
50,"""Such, I know, is the opinion of young Clive, who is a very long-headed and ambitious young fellow. I remember his saying to me one night, when we were, with difficulty, holding our own in the trenches, that if we had but a man of energy and intelligence at the head of our affairs in Southern India, we might, ere many years passed, be masters of the Carnatic. I own that it appears to me more likely that the French will be in that position, and that we shall not have a single establishment left there; but time will show.",such know opinion young long headed ambitious young fellow remember say night difficulty hold own trenche have man energy intelligence head affair southern many year pass master own appear likely position have single establishment leave time show 
51,"""Having defeated Maphuz Khan, Dupleix resolved to make a great effort to expel us from Fort Saint David, our sole footing left in Southern India; and he despatched an army of nine hundred Frenchmen, six hundred Sepoys, and a hundred Africans, with six guns and mortars, against us. They were four to one against us, and we had hot work, I can tell you. Four times they tried to storm the place, and each time we drove them back; till at last they gave it up in disgust, at the end of June, having besieged us for six months.",defeat resolve make great effort expel sole footing leave southern despatch army gun mortar have hot work tell time try storm place time drive last give disgust end besiege month 
52,"""Soon after this Admiral Boscawen, with a great fleet and an army, arrived from England; and on 19th of August besieged Pondicherry. The besieging army was six thousand strong; of whom three thousand, seven hundred and twenty were English. But Pondicherry resisted bravely, and after two months the besiegers were forced to retire, having lost, in attacks or by fever, one thousand and sixty-five men.",great fleet army arrive 19th besiege besieg army strong resist month besieger force retire lose attack fever man 
53,"""At the end of the siege, in which I had served as a medical officer, I returned to England. A few months after I left, peace was made between England and France, and by its terms Dupleix had to restore Madras to the English. I hear that fighting has been going on ever since, the English and French engaging as auxiliaries to rival native princes; and especially that there was some hot fighting round Devikota. However, we shall hear about that when we get there.""",end siege serve medical officer return few month leave peace make term have restore hear fighting go english french engage auxiliary rival native prince be hot fighting hear get 
54,"""And what do you think will be the result of it all, Doctor Rae?""",think result 
55,"""I think that undoubtedly, sooner or later, either the French or ourselves will be driven out. Which it will be remains to be seen. If we are expelled, the effect of our defeat is likely to operate disastrously at Calcutta, if not at Bombay. The French will be regarded as a powerful people, whom it is necessary to conciliate, while we shall be treated as a nation of whom they need have no fear, and whom they can oppress accordingly.",think drive remain see expel effect defeat likely operate regard powerful person necessary conciliate treat nation need have fear oppress

57,"After rounding the Cape of Good Hope, the ship encountered a series of very heavy gales, which drove her far out of her course up the eastern coast of Africa. In the last gale her foremast was carried away, and she put in to a small island to refit. She had also sprung a leak, and a number of stores were landed, to enable her to be taken up into shallow water and heeled over, in order that the leak might be got at.",round good ship encounter series heavy gale drive course eastern coast last gale foremast carry put small island refit spring leak number store land enable take shallow water heel order leak get

59,"""Had it not been for this,"" Charlie heard him say to Mr. Ashmead, ""I would have rigged a jury-mast and proceeded; but I can't stop the leak from the inside, without shifting a great portion of the cargo, and our hold is so full that this would be difficult in the extreme. But I own that I do not like delaying a day longer than necessary, here. The natives have a very bad reputation, besides which it is suspected that one, if not more, pirates have their rendezvous in these seas. Several of our merchantmen have mysteriously disappeared, without any gale having taken place which would account for their loss.",hear say rig jury mast proceed stop leak inside shift great portion cargo hold full difficult extreme own like delay day necessary native have bad reputation suspect pirate have rendezvous sea several merchantmen disappear gale take place account loss 
60,"""The captain of a ship which reached England, two or three days before we sailed, brought news that when she was within a fortnight's sail of the Cape, the sound of guns was heard one night, and that afterwards a ship was seen on fire, low down on the horizon. He reached the spot soon after daybreak, and found charred spars and other wreckage; but though he cruised about all day, he could find no signs of any boats. Complaints have been made to government, and I hear that there is an intention of sending two or three sloops out here to hunt the pirates up. But that will be of no use to us.""",captain ship reach day sail bring news fortnight sail sound gun hear night ship see fire low horizon reach spot daybreak find char spar other wreckage cruise day find sign boat complaint make government hear be intention send sloop hunt pirate use

When half across, she suddenly tacked round and sailed back in the direction from which she had come.",day arrival island native sailing boat see pass mouth bay half tack sail direction come 
62,"Before proceeding to lighten the ship, the captain had taken steps to put himself in a position of defence. For some distance along the centre of the bay the ground rose abruptly, at a distance of some thirty yards from the shore, forming a sort of natural terrace. Behind this a steep hill rose. The terrace, which was forty feet above the water level, extended for about a hundred yards, when the ground on either side of the plateau dropped away, as steeply as in front.",proceed lighten ship captain take step put position defence distance centre bay ground rise distance yard shore form sort natural terrace steep hill rise terrace foot water level extend yard ground side plateau drop front 
63,"The guns were the first things taken out of the ship, and, regardless of the remonstrances of the passengers at what they considered to be a waste of time, Captain Thompson had the whole of them taken up on the terrace. A small battery was thrown up by the sailors, at the two corners, and in each of these two of the thirty-two pounders were placed. The broadside guns were ranged in line along the centre of the terrace.",gun first thing take ship remonstrance passenger consider waste time have whole take terrace small battery throw sailor corner pounder place broadside gun rang line centre terrace 
64,"""Now,"" the captain said when, at the end of the second day, the preparations were completed by the transport of a quantity of ammunition from the ship's magazine to the terrace, ""I feel comfortable. We can defend ourselves here against all the pirates of the South Seas. If they don't come, we shall only have lost our two days' work, and shall have easy minds for the remainder of our stay here; which we should not have had, if we had been at the mercy of the first of those scoundrels who happened to hear of our being laid up.""",captain say end second day preparation complete transport quantity ammunition ship magazine terrace feel comfortable defend pirate come lose day work have easy mind remainder stay have mercy first scoundrel happen hear lay 
65,"The next morning the work of unloading the ship began, the bales and packages being lowered from the ship, as they were brought up from the hold, into boats alongside; and then taken to the shore, and piled there at the foot of the slope. This occupied three days, and at the end of that time the greater portion of the cargo had been removed. The ship, now several feet lighter in the water than before, was brought broadside to shore until her keel touched the ground. Then the remaining cargo was shifted, and by the additional aid of tackle and purchases on shore fastened to her masts, she was heeled over until her keel nearly reached the level of the water.",next morning work unload ship begin bale package lower ship bring hold boat take shore pile foot slope occupy day end time great portion cargo remove ship several foot light water bring shore keel touch ground remain cargo shift additional aid tackle purchase shore fasten mast heel keel reach level water

Hitherto all had remained on board; but previous to the ship being heeled over, tents constructed of the sails were erected on the terrace, beds and other articles of necessity landed, and the passengers, troops, and crew took up their temporary abode there.",late evening work finish follow morning crew begin scrape bottom carpenter repair leak whole seam cork repitch remain board previous ship heel tent construct sail erect terrace bed other article necessity land passenger troops crew take temporary abode
