2," ""This day six weeks--just six weeks ago!"" Horace Ventimore said, half aloud, to himself, and pulled out his watch. ""Half-past twelve--what was I doing at half-past twelve?""",day week week say half pull watch half do half 
3,"As he sat at the window of his office in Great Cloister Street, Westminster, he made his thoughts travel back to a certain glorious morning in August which now seemed so remote and irrecoverable. At this precise time he was waiting on the balcony of the Hôtel de la Plage--the sole hostelry of St. Luc-en-Port, the tiny Normandy watering-place upon which, by some happy inspiration, he had lighted during a solitary cycling tour--waiting until She should appear.",sit window office great make thought travel certain glorious morning seem remote irrecoverable precise time wait balcony sole hostelry tiny water place happy inspiration light solitary cycling tour wait appear 
4,"He could see the whole scene: the tiny cove, with the violet shadow of the cliff sleeping on the green water; the swell of the waves lazily lapping against the diving-board from which he had plunged half an hour before; he remembered the long swim out to the buoy; the exhilarated anticipation with which he had dressed and climbed the steep path to the hotel terrace.",see whole scene tiny cove violet shadow cliff sleep green water swell wave lap diving board plunge hour remember long swim buoy exhilarate anticipation dress climb steep path hotel terrace 
5,"For was he not to pass the whole remainder of that blissful day in Sylvia Futvoye's society? Were they not to cycle together (there were, of course, others of the party--but they did not count), to cycle over to Veulettes, to picnic there under the cliff, and ride back--always together--in the sweet-scented dusk, over the slopes, between the poplars or the cornfields glowing golden against a sky of warm purple?",pass whole remainder blissful day society cycle be course other party count cycle picnic cliff ride sweet scent dusk slope poplar cornfield glow golden sky warm purple 
6,"Now he saw himself going round to the gravelled courtyard in front of the hotel with a sudden dread of missing her. There was nothing there but the little low cart, with its canvas tilt which was to convey Professor Futvoye and his wife to the place of _rendezvous_.",see go gravell courtyard front hotel sudden dread miss be little low cart canvas tilt convey wife place 
7,"There was Sylvia at last, distractingly fair and fresh in her cool pink blouse and cream-coloured skirt; how gracious and friendly and generally delightful she had been throughout that unforgettable day, which was supreme amongst others only a little less perfect, and all now fled for ever!",be last fair fresh cool pink blouse cream coloured skirt gracious friendly delightful unforgettable day supreme other little perfect flead 
8,"They had had drawbacks, it was true. Old Futvoye was perhaps the least bit of a bore at times, with his interminable disquisitions on Egyptian art and ancient Oriental character-writing, in which he seemed convinced that Horace must feel a perfervid interest, as, indeed, he thought it politic to affect. The Professor was a most learned archæologist, and positively bulged with information on his favourite subjects; but it is just possible that Horace might have been less curious concerning the distinction between Cuneiform and Aramæan or Kufic and Arabic inscriptions if his informant had happened to be the father of anybody else. However, such insincerities as these are but so many evidences of sincerity.",have drawback true old least bit bore time interminable disquisition egyptian art ancient oriental character writing seem convince feel perfervid interest think politic affect learn archæologist bulg information favourite subject possible curious concern distinction kufic arabic inscription informant happen father else such insincerity many evidence sincerity 
9,"So with self-tormenting ingenuity Horace conjured up various pictures from that Norman holiday of his: the little half-timbered cottages with their faded blue shutters and the rushes growing out of their thatch roofs; the spires of village churches gleaming above the bronze-green beeches; the bold headlands, their ochre and yellow cliffs contrasting grimly with the soft ridges of the turf above them; the tethered black-and-white cattle grazing peacefully against a background of lapis lazuli and malachite sea, and in every scene the sensation of Sylvia's near presence, the sound of her voice in his ears. And now?... He looked up from the papers and tracing-cloth on his desk, and round the small panelled room which served him as an office, at the framed plans and photographs, the set squares and T squares on the walls, and felt a dull resentment against his surroundings. From his window he commanded a cheerful view of a tall, mouldering wall, once part of the Abbey boundaries, surmounted by _chevaux-de-frise_, above whose rust-attenuated spikes some plane trees stretched their yellowing branches.",self torment ingenuity conjure various picture holiday little half timber cottage fade blue shutter rushe grow thatch roof spire village church gleam bronze green beeche bold headland ochre yellow cliff contrast soft ridge turf tether black white cattle graze background lapis lazuli malachite sea scene sensation near presence sound voice ear look paper tracing cloth desk small panell room serve office frame plan photograph set square square wall feel dull resentment surroundings window command cheerful view tall mouldering wall part boundary surmount rust attenuate spike plane tree stretch yellowing branch 
10,"""She would have come to care for me,"" Horace's thoughts ran on, disjointedly. ""I could have sworn that that last day of all--and her people didn't seem to object to me. Her mother asked me cordially enough to call on them when they were back in town. When I did----""",come care thought run swear last day person seem object mother ask call town 
11,"When he had called, there had been a difference--not an unusual sequel to an acquaintanceship begun in a Continental watering-place. It was difficult to define, but unmistakable--a certain formality and constraint on Mrs. Futvoye's part, and even on Sylvia's, which seemed intended to warn him that it is not every friendship that survives the Channel passage. So he had gone away sore at heart, but fully recognising that any advances in future must come from their side. They might ask him to dinner, or at least to call again; but more than a month had passed, and they had made no sign. No, it was all over; he must consider himself dropped.",call be difference unusual sequel acquaintanceship begin continental water place difficult define unmistakable certain formality constraint part seem intend warn friendship survive passage go sore heart recognise advance future come side ask dinner least call more month pass make sign consider drop 
12,"""After all,"" he told himself, with a short and anything but mirthful laugh, ""it's natural enough. Mrs. Futvoye has probably been making inquiries about my professional prospects. It's better as it is. What earthly chance have I got of marrying unless I can get work of my own? It's all I can do to keep myself decently. I've no right to dream of asking any one--to say nothing of Sylvia--to marry me. I should only be rushing into temptation if I saw any more of her. She's not for a poor beggar like me, who was born unlucky. Well, whining won't do any good--let's have a look at Beevor's latest performance.""",tell short mirthful laugh natural make inquiry professional prospect good earthly chance get marry get work own do keep have right dream ask one say marry rush temptation see more poor beggar bear unlucky whine do good let have look late performance 
13,"He spread out a large coloured plan, in a corner of which appeared the name of ""William Beevor, Architect,"" and began to study it in a spirit of anything but appreciation.",spread large coloured plan corner appear name begin study spirit appreciation 
14,"""Beevor gets on,"" he said to himself. ""Heaven knows that I don't grudge him his success. He's a good fellow--though he _does_ build architectural atrocities, and seem to like 'em. Who am I to give myself airs? He's successful--I'm not. Yet if I only had his opportunities, what wouldn't I make of them!""",get say heaven know grudge success good fellow build architectural atrocity seem like give air successful have opportunity make 
15,"Let it be said here that this was not the ordinary self-delusion of an incompetent. Ventimore really had talent above the average, with ideals and ambitions which might under better conditions have attained recognition and fulfilment before this.",let say ordinary self delusion incompetent have talent average ideal ambition good condition attain recognition fulfilment 
16,"But he was not quite energetic enough, besides being too proud, to push himself into notice, and hitherto he had met with persistent ill-luck.",energetic proud push notice meet persistent ill luck 
17,"So Horace had no other occupation now but to give Beevor, whose offices and clerk he shared, such slight assistance as he might require, and it was by no means cheering to feel that every year of this enforced semi-idleness left him further handicapped in the race for wealth and fame, for he had already passed his twenty-eighth birthday.",have other occupation give office clerk share such slight assistance require means cheer feel year enforce semi-idleness leave handicapped race wealth fame pass eighth birthday 
18,"If Miss Sylvia Futvoye had indeed felt attracted towards him at one time it was not altogether incomprehensible. Horace Ventimore was not a model of manly beauty--models of manly beauty are rare out of novels, and seldom interesting in them; but his clear-cut, clean-shaven face possessed a certain distinction, and if there were faint satirical lines about the mouth, they were redeemed by the expression of the grey-blue eyes, which were remarkably frank and pleasant. He was well made, and tall enough to escape all danger of being described as short; fair-haired and pale, without being unhealthily pallid, in complexion, and he gave the impression of being a man who took life as it came, and whose sense of humour would serve as a lining for most clouds that might darken his horizon.",feel attract time incomprehensible model manly beauty model manly beauty rare novel interesting clear cut clean shaven face possess certain distinction be faint satirical line mouth redeem expression grey blue eye frank pleasant make tall escape danger describe short fair haired pale pallid complexion give impression man take life come sense humour serve lining most cloud dark horizon 
19,"There was a rap at the door which communicated with Beevor's office, and Beevor himself, a florid, thick-set man, with small side-whiskers, burst in.",be rap door communicate office florid thick set man small side whisker burst 
20,"""I say, Ventimore, you didn't run off with the plans for that house I'm building at Larchmere, did you? Because--ah, I see you're looking over them. Sorry to deprive you, but----""",say run plan house build see look sorry deprive 
21,"""Thanks, old fellow, take them, by all means. I've seen all I wanted to see.""",thanks old fellow take means see want see 
22,"""Well, I'm just off to Larchmere now. Want to be there to check the quantities, and there's my other house at Fittlesdon. I must go on afterwards and set it out, so I shall probably be away some days. I'm taking Harrison down, too. You won't be wanting him, eh?""",want check quantity be other house go set day take want 
23,"Ventimore laughed. ""I can manage to do nothing without a clerk to help me. Your necessity is greater than mine. Here are the plans.""",laugh manage do clerk help necessity great plan 
24,"""I'm rather pleased with 'em myself, you know,"" said Beevor; ""that roof ought to look well, eh? Good idea of mine lightening the slate with that ornamental tile-work along the top. You saw I put in one of your windows with just a trifling addition. I was almost inclined to keep both gables alike, as you suggested, but it struck me a little variety--one red brick and the other 'parged'--would be more out-of-the-way.""",pleased e know say roof look good idea lighten slate ornamental tile work top see put window trifling addition inclined keep gable alike suggest strike little variety red brick other parge way 
25,"""Oh, much,"" agreed Ventimore, knowing that to disagree was useless.",much agree know disagree useless 
26,"""Not, mind you,"" continued Beevor, ""that I believe in going in for too much originality in domestic architecture. The average client no more wants an original house than he wants an original hat; he wants something he won't feel a fool in. I've often thought, old man, that perhaps the reason why you haven't got on----you don't mind my speaking candidly, do you?""",mind continue believe go much originality domestic architecture average client want original house want original hat want feel fool think old man reason get mind speak 
27,"""Not a bit,"" said Ventimore, cheerfully. ""Candour's the cement of friendship. Dab it on.""",bit say candour cement friendship dab 
28,"""Well, I was only going to say that you do yourself no good by all those confoundedly unconventional ideas of yours. If you had your chance to-morrow, it's my belief you'd throw it away by insisting on some fantastic fad or other.""",go say do good unconventional idea have chance belief throw insist fantastic fad other

30,"""I got mine before I'd set up six months,"" said Beevor. ""The great thing, however,"" he went on, with a flavour of personal application, ""is to know how to use it when it _does_ come. Well, I must be off if I mean to catch that one o'clock from Waterloo. You'll see to anything that may come in for me while I'm away, won't you, and let me know? Oh, by the way, the quantity surveyor has just sent in the quantities for that schoolroom at Woodford--do you mind running through them and seeing they're right? And there's the specification for the new wing at Tusculum Lodge--you might draft that some time when you've nothing else to do. You'll find all the papers on my desk. Thanks awfully, old chap.""",get set month say great thing go flavour personal application know use _does_ come mean catch o'clock see come let know way quantity surveyor send quantity schoolroom mind run see right be specification new wing draft time have else do find paper desk thanks old chap 
31,"And Beevor hurried back to his own room, where for the next few minutes he could be heard bustling Harrison, the clerk, to make haste; then a hansom was whistled for, there were footsteps down the old stairs, the sounds of a departing vehicle on the uneven stones, and after that silence and solitude.",hurry own room next few minute hear bustle clerk make haste hansom whistle be footstep old stair sound depart vehicle uneven stone silence solitude 
32,"It was not in Nature to avoid feeling a little envious. Beevor had work to do in the world: even if it chiefly consisted in profaning sylvan retreats by smug or pretentious villas, it was still work which entitled him to consideration and respect in the eyes of all right-minded persons.",avoid feel little envious have work do world consist profane retreat smug pretentious villa work entitle consideration respect eye right minded person 
33,And nobody believed in Horace; as yet he had never known the satisfaction of seeing the work of his brain realised in stone and brick and mortar; no building stood anywhere to bear testimony to his existence and capability long after he himself should have passed away.,believe know satisfaction see work brain realise stone brick mortar building stand bear testimony existence capability pass 
34,"It was not a profitable train of thought, and, to escape from it, he went into Beevor's room and fetched the documents he had mentioned--at least they would keep him occupied until it was time to go to his club and lunch. He had no sooner settled down to his calculations, however, when he heard a shuffling step on the landing, followed by a knock at Beevor's office-door. ""More work for Beevor,"" he thought; ""what luck the fellow has! I'd better go in and explain that he's just left town on business.""",profitable train thought escape go room fetched document mention least keep occupy time go club lunch settle calculation hear shuffle step landing follow knock office door more work think luck fellow have go explain leave town business 
35,"But on entering the adjoining room he heard the knocking repeated--this time at his own door; and hastening back to put an end to this somewhat undignified form of hide-and-seek, he discovered that this visitor at least was legitimately his, and was, in fact, no other than Professor Anthony Futvoye himself.",enter adjoin room hear knock repeat time own door hasten put end undignified form hide seek discover visitor least fact other 
36,"The Professor was standing in the doorway peering short-sightedly through his convex glasses, his head protruded from his loosely-fitting great-coat with an irresistible suggestion of an inquiring tortoise. To Horace his appearance was more welcome than that of the wealthiest client--for why should Sylvia's father take the trouble to pay him this visit unless he still wished to continue the acquaintanceship? It might even be that he was the bearer of some message or invitation.",stand doorway peer short convex glasses head protrude fitting great coat irresistible suggestion inquire tortoise appearance welcome wealthiest client father take trouble pay visit wish continue acquaintanceship bearer message invitation 
37,"So, although to an impartial eye the Professor might not seem the kind of elderly gentleman whose society would produce any wild degree of exhilaration, Horace was unfeignedly delighted to see him.",impartial eye seem kind elderly gentleman society produce wild degree exhilaration delighted see 
38,"""Extremely kind of you to come and see me like this, sir,"" he said warmly, after establishing him in the solitary armchair reserved for hypothetical clients.",kind come see sir say establish solitary armchair reserve hypothetical client 
39,"""Not at all. I'm afraid your visit to Cottesmore Gardens some time ago was somewhat of a disappointment.""",afraid visit time disappointment 
40,"""A disappointment?"" echoed Horace, at a loss to know what was coming next.",disappointment echoe loss know come 
41,"""I refer to the fact--which possibly, however, escaped your notice""--explained the Professor, scratching his scanty patch of grizzled whisker with a touch of irascibility, ""that I myself was not at home on that occasion.""",refer fact escape notice explain scratch scanty patch grizzled whisker touch irascibility home occasion 
42,"""Indeed, I was greatly disappointed,"" said Horace, ""though of course I know how much you are engaged. It's all the more good of you to spare time to drop in for a chat just now.""",disappointed say course know much engage good spare time drop chat 
43,"""I've not come to chat, Mr. Ventimore. I never chat. I wanted to see you about a matter which I thought you might be so obliging as to---- But I observe you are busy--probably too busy to attend to such a small affair.""",come chat chat want see matter think obliging observe busy busy attend small affair 
44,"It was clear enough now; the Professor was going to build, and had decided--could it be at Sylvia's suggestion?--to entrust the work to him! But he contrived to subdue any self-betraying eagerness, and reply (as he could with perfect truth) that he had nothing on hand just then which he could not lay aside, and that if the Professor would let him know what he required, he would take it up at once.",clear go build decide suggestion entrust work contrive subdue self betray eagerness reply perfect truth have hand lay let know require take 
45,"""So much the better,"" said the Professor; ""so much the better. Both my wife and daughter declared that it was making far too great a demand upon your good nature; but, as I told them, 'I am much mistaken,' I said, 'if Mr. Ventimore's practice is so extensive that he cannot leave it for one afternoon----'""",good say good wife daughter declare make great demand good nature tell mistaken say practice extensive leave afternoon 
46,Evidently it was not a house. Could he be needed to escort them somewhere that afternoon? Even that was more than he had hoped for a few minutes since. He hastened to repeat that he was perfectly free that afternoon.,house need escort afternoon more hope few minute hasten repeat free afternoon 
47,"""In that case,"" said the Professor, beginning to fumble in all his pockets--was he searching for a note in Sylvia's handwriting?--""in that case, you will be conferring a real favour on me if you can make it convenient to attend a sale at Hammond's Auction Rooms in Covent Garden, and just bid for one or two articles on my behalf.""",case say begin fumble pocket search note handwriting case conferr real favour make convenient attend sale bid article behalf 
48,"Whatever disappointment Ventimore felt, it may be said to his credit that he allowed no sign of it to appear. ""Of course I'll go, with pleasure,"" he said, ""if I can be of any use.""",disappointment feel say credit allow sign appear course go pleasure say use 
49,"""I knew I shouldn't come to you in vain,"" said the Professor. ""I remembered your wonderful good nature, sir, in accompanying my wife and daughter on all sorts of expeditions in the blazing hot weather we had at St. Luc--when you might have remained quietly at the hotel with me. Not that I should trouble you now, only I have to lunch at the Oriental Club, and I've an appointment afterwards to examine and report on a recently-discovered inscribed cylinder for the Museum, which will fully occupy the rest of the afternoon, so that it's physically impossible for me to go to Hammond's myself, and I strongly object to employing a broker when I can avoid it. Where did I put that catalogue?... Ah, here it is. This was sent to me by the executors of my old friend, General Collingham, who died the other day. I met him at Nakada when I was out excavating some years ago. He was something of a collector in his way, though he knew very little about it, and, of course, was taken in right and left. Most of his things are downright rubbish, but there are just a few lots that are worth securing, at a reasonable figure, by some one who knew what he was about.""",know come vain say remember wonderful good nature sir accompany wife daughter sort expedition blaze hot weather have remain hotel trouble have lunch oriental have appointment examine report discover inscribe cylinder occupy rest afternoon impossible go object employ broker avoid put catalogue send executor old friend die other day meet excavate year collector way know little course take right leave most thing rubbish be few lot worth secure reasonable figure one know 
50,"""But, my dear Professor,"" remonstrated Horace, not relishing this responsibility, ""I'm afraid I'm as likely as not to pick up some of the rubbish. I've no special knowledge of Oriental curios.""",dear remonstrate relish responsibility afraid likely pick rubbish have special knowledge oriental curio 
51,"""At St. Luc,"" said the Professor, ""you impressed me as having, for an amateur, an exceptionally accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with Egyptian and Arabian art from the earliest period."" (If this were so, Horace could only feel with shame what a fearful humbug he must have been.) ""However, I've no wish to lay too heavy a burden on you, and, as you will see from this catalogue, I have ticked off the lots in which I am chiefly interested, and made a note of the limit to which I am prepared to bid, so you'll have no difficulty.""",say impress have amateur accurate comprehensive acquaintance egyptian arabian art early period feel shame fearful humbug have wish lay heavy burden see catalogue tick lot interested make note limit prepare bid have difficulty 
52,"""Very well,"" said Horace; ""I'll go straight to Covent Garden, and slip out and get some lunch later on.""",say go slip get lunch 
53,"""Well, perhaps, if you don't mind. The lots I have marked seem to come on at rather frequent intervals, but don't let that consideration deter you from getting your lunch, and if you _should_ miss anything by not being on the spot, why, it's of no consequence, though I don't say it mightn't be a pity. In any case, you won't forget to mark what each lot fetches, and perhaps you wouldn't mind dropping me a line when you return the catalogue--or stay, could you look in some time after dinner this evening, and let me know how you got on?--that would be better.""",mind lot mark seem come frequent interval let consideration deter get lunch miss spot consequence say pity case forget mark lot fetch mind drop line return catalogue stay look time dinner evening let know get good 
54,"Horace thought it would be decidedly better, and undertook to call and render an account of his stewardship that evening. There remained the question of a deposit, should one or more of the lots be knocked down to him; and, as he was obliged to own that he had not so much as ten pounds about him at that particular moment, the Professor extracted a note for that amount from his case, and handed it to him with the air of a benevolent person relieving a deserving object. ""Don't exceed my limits,"" he said, ""for I can't afford more just now; and mind you give Hammond your own name, not mine. If the dealers get to know I'm after the things, they'll run you up. And now, I don't think I need detain you any longer, especially as time is running on. I'm sure I can trust you to do the best you can for me. Till this evening, then.""",think good undertake call render account stewardship evening remain question deposit more lot knock oblige own have much pound particular moment extract note amount case hand air benevolent person relieve deserve object exceed limit say afford more mind give own name dealer get know thing run think need detain time run sure trust do good evening 
55,A few minutes later Horace was driving up to Covent Garden behind the best-looking horse he could pick out.,few minute drive good look horse pick 
56,"The Professor might have required from him rather more than was strictly justified by their acquaintanceship, and taken his acquiescence too much as a matter of course--but what of that? After all, he was Sylvia's parent.",require justify acquaintanceship take acquiescence much matter course parent 
57,"""Even with _my_ luck,"" he was thinking, ""I ought to succeed in getting at least one or two of the lots he's marked; and if I can only please him, something may come of it.""",luck think succeed get least lot mark please come
