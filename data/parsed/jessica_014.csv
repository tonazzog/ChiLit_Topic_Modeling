1,CHAPTER IV. JESSICA’S CHOICE.,choice 
2," Early the next morning Daniel went to the minister’s house, half hoping that he should hear that the malady of the night before had been only a temporary insensibility, from which he had recovered. But the minister lay in the same state of unconsciousness, and showed no sign of returning life. The nurse told him that a ragged and miserable woman, who called herself Jessica’s mother, had seen him during the Sunday afternoon, and held a long conversation with him, after which he had ordered some food to be given her in the kitchen.",next morning go minister house half hope hear malady night temporary insensibility recover minister lay same state unconsciousness show sign return life nurse tell ragged miserable woman call mother see afternoon hold long conversation order food give kitchen 
3,"This, then, no doubt, was the subject upon which the minister wished to speak to Daniel; and the latter felt more than ever lost in doubt as to what he ought to do, as it was now impossible to hear the advice which his master had intended to give to him.",doubt subject minister wish speak latter feel more lose doubt do impossible hear advice master intend give 
4,"He walked thoughtfully towards the chapel, with Jessica beside him, scarcely knowing how to break the news to her. She was a little sad, and less talkative than usual, and her small hand was thrust lovingly into his own, as if she felt that it was needful to assure herself that it could return her warm grasp. When they opened the vestry-door, and, going in, saw all the confusion which bore testimony of the last night’s calamity, Daniel drew the child closer to him with his arm, and bending down stiffly kissed her uplifted face.",walk chapel know break news little sad talkative usual small hand thrust own feel needful assure return warm grasp open vestry door go see confusion bear testimony last night calamity draw child close arm bending kiss uplift face 
5,"“He isn’t going to die,” said Jessica, with a trembling voice; “he is only resting himself, the doctor says, and then he will know us again, and speak to us all.”",go die say tremble voice rest doctor say know speak 
6,"“To think,” cried Daniel, in a mournful amazement, “that he should have spoken thousands and thousands of words, ay! millions! and I scarce gave an ear to them; and now I’d almost offer a golden guinea for every word he could speak to me! Ay! Jessica, so that he spoke pretty short and simple, I’d give a guinea a word if he could tell me what I ought to do.”",think cry mournful amazement speak thousand thousand word million give ear offer golden guinea word speak speak short simple give guinea word tell do 
7,“Do you want him to say something particular?” asked Jessica.,want say particular ask 
8,"“Ay! very particular,” answered Daniel.",particular answer 
9,“Couldn’t you ask God?” suggested Jessica.,ask suggest 
10,"“Well,” he answered, doubtfully, “of course I could; but then there’s no direct answer, which I couldn’t mistake. My mother used to open her Bible and take the first words she set her eyes on for answer; and very queer answers they were sometimes. I’m not good enough yet to expect a very clear answer to my prayers.”",answer course be direct answer mistake mother use open take first word set eye answer queer answer good expect clear answer prayer 
11,"Jessica made no answer, for Daniel’s mode of reasoning was a little obscure to her; but she set to work to put the scattered chairs in order, while Daniel looked on with loving but troubled eyes.",make answer mode reasoning little obscure set work put scatter chair order look loving trouble eye 
12,"“Jessica,” he said, “the trouble I’d like to talk to him about is that your mother’s come back again.”",say trouble like talk mother come 
13,"She started, and looked at him with great, wide-open eyes of amazement and terror, while her face quivered, and she twitched her small shoulders a little, as if already shrinking from a blow. But the expression of pain and fear passed away quickly, and though her face was pale a smile came upon it.",start look great wide open eye amazement terror face quiver twitch small shoulder little shrink blow expression pain fear pass face pale smile come 
14,“Doesn’t God know that mother’s come back?” she asked.,know mother come ask 
15,"There was no need for Daniel to answer her question, but he turned it over and over again in his own mind with something very much like doubt. It seemed as if it would have been so much better, especially at this crisis, for Jessica’s mother to remain absent that it was as if God had given up His particular providence over the affairs of insignificant people like himself and Jessica. It would be no wonder if amid all the affairs of the hosts of angels, and the myriads of worlds of which he had a vague idea, that God should overlook a little matter like the tramping to and fro of a drunken woman. It was a saddening thought; but Daniel was in the mood to cherish it.",be need answer question turn own mind doubt seem good crisis mother remain absent give particular providence affair insignificant person wonder affair host angel myriad world have vague idea overlook little matter tramping for drunken woman saddening thought mood cherish 
16,“Do you know where mother is?” asked Jessica.,know mother ask 
17,"“No, deary,” answered Daniel. “I gave her a shilling last night to pay for her lodging and breakfast. She told me she’d had nothing to eat or drink all day; but the nurse said she’d been to see the minister yesterday afternoon and had a good meal. She’s sure to come again.”",answer give shilling last night pay lodging breakfast tell have eat drink day nurse say see minister yesterday afternoon have good meal sure come 
18,"“Ay, she’s sure to come again,” echoed Jessica.",sure come echoe 
19,"“And so,” continued Daniel, “nurse and me have agreed you’d better stay with the young ladies for a bit, out of the way like, till I can see how I can settle with your mother. You’d be glad to stay with Miss Jane and Winny, Jessica?”",continue nurse agree stay young lady bit way see settle mother glad stay 
20,"“Yes,” she answered, her face quivering again, as if she could scarcely keep herself from crying, “but I’d like to see my mother.”",answer face quiver keep cry like see mother 
21,"“See your mother!” repeated Daniel, with unfeigned astonishment; “whatever for, Jessica?”",see mother repeat unfeigned astonishment 
22,"“She’s my mother,” replied Jessica, “and the Lord Jesus Christ had a mother. Oh! I’d like to see her again, and tell her about God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven. Perhaps she’d become a good woman!”",mother reply have mother like see tell heaven become good woman 
23,"She could control herself no longer, and throwing herself on her knees before the minister’s chair she hid her face in her hands, and Daniel heard that amid her sobs she was murmuring some prayer to God for her mother. This was a new perplexity, that Jessica should wish to see her cruel and hard-hearted mother; but there was something in it which he could neither blame nor gainsay. He would rather have kept Jessica in safety at the minister’s house than have her exposed to the frequent and violent visits of the drunken woman to his own little dwelling; but if Jessica decided otherwise he would not oppose her. His house did not seem the same place without her presence in it.",control throw knee minister chair hide face hand hear sob murmure prayer mother new perplexity wish see cruel hard hearted mother be blame gainsay keep safety minister house have expose frequent violent visit drunken woman own little dwelling decide oppose house seem same place presence 
24,"“Choose for yourself, deary,” he said, very gently: “come home with me, and run the chance of your mother coming again soon; or go back to Miss Jane and Winny, who are so fond of you, and where everything is fine, and you’ll be in such good company. Choose for yourself.”",choose say come run chance mother come go fond fine such good company choose 
25,"“I’ll go home with you,” said Jessica, getting up from her knees with a cheerful smile. “I couldn’t think this morning who’d sweep the kitchen, and get the breakfast. I’d rather go home with you, if you please.”",go say get knee cheerful smile think morning sweep kitchen get breakfast go 
26,"It was impossible for Daniel not to be gratified at Jessica’s choice, however troubled he might be with the idea of her mother’s disturbance of their peace; for home was not home without her. They kept very near to one another all day at their work, and it was late at night before they returned home, where they found no one sitting upon the doorsteps, as Daniel timorously expected. But their neighbor Brookes informed them that Jessica’s mother had been sobbing and crying before the closed door during a great part of the evening.",impossible gratified choice trouble idea mother disturbance peace home home keep day work late night return find sit doorstep expect neighbor inform mother sobb cry closed door great part evening
