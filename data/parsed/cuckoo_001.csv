2,"     ""Somewhat back from the village street     Stands the old-fashioned country seat.""",village street stand old fashioned country seat 
3," Once upon a time in an old town, in an old street, there stood a very old house. Such a house as you could hardly find nowadays, however you searched, for it belonged to a gone-by time--a time now quite passed away.",time old town old street stand old house house find search belong gone time time pass 
4,"It stood in a street, but yet it was not like a town house, for though the front opened right on to the pavement, the back windows looked out upon a beautiful, quaintly terraced garden, with old trees growing so thick and close together that in summer it was like living on the edge of a forest to be near them; and even in winter the web of their interlaced branches hid all clear view behind.",stand street town house front open pavement back window look beautiful terrace garden old tree grow thick close summer live edge forest winter web interlace branch hide clear view 
5,"There was a colony of rooks in this old garden. Year after year they held their parliaments and cawed and chattered and fussed; year after year they built their nests and hatched their eggs; year after year, I _suppose_, the old ones gradually died off and the young ones took their place, though, but for knowing this _must_ be so, no one would have suspected it, for to all appearance the rooks were always the same--ever and always the same.",be colony rook old garden year year hold parliament caw chatter fuss year year build nest hatch egg year year _suppose old one die young one take place know _must_ suspect appearance rook same same 
6,"Time indeed seemed to stand still in and all about the old house, as if it and the people who inhabited it had got _so_ old that they could not get any older, and had outlived the possibility of change.",time seem stand old house person inhabit get old get old outlive possibility change 
7,"But one day at last there did come a change. Late in the dusk of an autumn afternoon a carriage drove up to the door of the old house, came rattling over the stones with a sudden noisy clatter that sounded quite impertinent, startling the rooks just as they were composing themselves to rest, and setting them all wondering what could be the matter.",day last come change dusk autumn afternoon carriage drive door old house come rattling stone sudden noisy clatter sound impertinent startling rook compose rest set wonder matter 
8,"A little girl was the matter! A little girl in a grey merino frock and grey beaver bonnet, grey tippet and grey gloves--all grey together, even to her eyes, all except her round rosy face and bright brown hair. Her name even was rather grey, for it was Griselda.",little girl matter little girl grey merino frock grey beaver bonnet grey tippet grey glove grey eye round rosy face bright brown hair name grey 
9,"A gentleman lifted her out of the carriage and disappeared with her into the house, and later that same evening the gentleman came out of the house and got into the carriage which had come back for him again, and drove away. That was all that the rooks saw of the change that had come to the old house. Shall we go inside to see more?",gentleman lift carriage disappear house same evening gentleman come house get carriage come drive rook see change come old house go see more 
10,"Up the shallow, wide, old-fashioned staircase, past the wainscoted walls, dark and shining like a mirror, down a long narrow passage with many doors, which but for their gleaming brass handles one would not have known were there, the oldest of the three old servants led little Griselda, so tired and sleepy that her supper had been left almost untasted, to the room prepared for her. It was a queer room, for everything in the house was queer; but in the dancing light of the fire burning brightly in the tiled grate, it looked cheerful enough.",shallow wide old fashioned staircase wainscot wall dark shine mirror long narrow passage many door gleam brass handle know old old servant lead little tired sleepy supper leave untasted room prepare queer room house queer dancing light fire burn tile grate look cheerful 
11,"""I am glad there's a fire,"" said the child. ""Will it keep alight till the morning, do you think?""",glad be fire say child keep alight morning think 
12,The old servant shook her head.,old servant shake head 
13,"""'Twould not be safe to leave it so that it would burn till morning,"" she said. ""When you are in bed and asleep, little missie, you won't want the fire. Bed's the warmest place.""",safe leave burn morning say bed asleep little missie want fire bed warmest place 
14,"""It isn't for that I want it,"" said Griselda; ""it's for the light I like it. This house all looks so dark to me, and yet there seem to be lights hidden in the walls too, they shine so.""",want say light like house look dark seem be light hide wall shine 
15,The old servant smiled.,old servant smile 
16,"""It will all seem strange to you, no doubt,"" she said; ""but you'll get to like it, missie. 'Tis a _good_ old house, and those that know best love it well.""",seem strange doubt say get like missie tis _good_ old house know good love 
17,"""Whom do you mean?"" said Griselda. ""Do you mean my great-aunts?""",mean say mean great aunt 
18,"""Ah, yes, and others beside,"" replied the old woman. ""The rooks love it well, and others beside. Did you ever hear tell of the 'good people,' missie, over the sea where you come from?""",other reply old woman rook love other hear tell good person missie sea come 
19,"""Fairies, do you mean?"" cried Griselda, her eyes sparkling. ""Of course I've _heard_ of them, but I never saw any. Did you ever?""",fairy mean cry eye sparkling course _heard_ see 
20,"""I couldn't say,"" answered the old woman.",say answer old woman 
21,"""My mind is not young like yours, missie, and there are times when strange memories come back to me as of sights and sounds in a dream. I am too old to see and hear as I once could. We are all old here, missie. 'Twas time something young came to the old house again.""",mind young missie be time strange memory come sight sound dream old see hear old missie twa time young come old house 
22,"""How strange and queer everything seems!"" thought Griselda, as she got into bed. ""I don't feel as if I belonged to it a bit. And they are all _so_ old; perhaps they won't like having a child among them?""",strange queer seem think get bed feel belong bit _so_ old like have child 
23,"The very same thought that had occurred to the rooks! They could not decide as to the fors and againsts at all, so they settled to put it to the vote the next morning, and in the meantime they and Griselda all went to sleep.",same thought occur rook decide for settle put vote next morning meantime go sleep 
24,"I never heard if _they_ slept well that night; after such unusual excitement it was hardly to be expected they would. But Griselda, being a little girl and not a rook, was so tired that two minutes after she had tucked herself up in bed she was quite sound asleep, and did not wake for several hours.",hear sleep night such unusual excitement expect little girl rook tired minute tuck bed sound asleep wake several hour 
25,"""I wonder what it will all look like in the morning,"" was her last waking thought. ""If it was summer now, or spring, I shouldn't mind--there would always be something nice to do then.""",wonder look morning last wake thought summer spring mind be nice do 
26,"As sometimes happens, when she woke again, very early in the morning, long before it was light, her thoughts went straight on with the same subject.",happen wake morning light thought go same subject 
27,"""If it was summer now, or spring,"" she repeated to herself, just as if she had not been asleep at all--like the man who fell into a trance for a hundred years just as he was saying ""it is bitt--"" and when he woke up again finished the sentence as if nothing had happened--""erly cold."" ""If only it was spring,"" thought Griselda.",summer spring repeat asleep man fall trance year say bitt wake finish sentence happen cold spring think 
28,"Just as she had got so far in her thoughts, she gave a great start. What was it she heard? Could her wish have come true? Was this fairyland indeed that she had got to, where one only needs to _wish_, for it to _be_? She rubbed her eyes, but it was too dark to see; _that_ was not very fairyland-like, but her ears she felt certain had not deceived her: she was quite, quite sure that she had heard the cuckoo!",get thought give great start hear wish come true fairyland get need _wish rub eye dark see fairyland ear feel certain deceive sure hear cuckoo 
29,"She listened with all her might, but she did not hear it again. Could it, after all, have been fancy? She grew sleepy at last, and was just dropping off when--yes, there it was again, as clear and distinct as possible--""Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!"" three, four, _five_ times, then perfect silence as before.",listen hear fancy grow sleepy last drop be clear distinct possible cuckoo cuckoo _five_ time perfect silence 
30,"""What a funny cuckoo,"" said Griselda to herself. ""I could almost fancy it was in the house. I wonder if my great-aunts have a tame cuckoo in a cage? I don't _think_ I ever heard of such a thing, but this is such a queer house; everything seems different in it--perhaps they have a tame cuckoo. I'll ask them in the morning. It's very nice to hear, whatever it is.""",funny cuckoo say fancy house wonder great aunt have tame cuckoo cage _think hear thing queer house seem different have tame cuckoo ask morning nice hear 
31,"And, with a pleasant feeling of companionship, a sense that she was not the only living creature awake in this dark world, Griselda lay listening, contentedly enough, for the sweet, fresh notes of the cuckoo's friendly greeting. But before it sounded again through the silent house she was once more fast asleep. And this time she slept till daylight had found its way into all but the _very_ darkest nooks and crannies of the ancient dwelling.",pleasant feeling companionship sense only living creature awake dark world lay listen sweet fresh note cuckoo friendly greeting sound silent house fast asleep time sleep daylight find way _very_ dark nook cranny ancient dwelling 
32,"She dressed herself carefully, for she had been warned that her aunts loved neatness and precision; she fastened each button of her grey frock, and tied down her hair as smooth as such a brown tangle _could_ be tied down; and, absorbed with these weighty cares, she forgot all about the cuckoo for the time. It was not till she was sitting at breakfast with her aunts that she remembered it, or rather was reminded of it, by some little remark that was made about the friendly robins on the terrace walk outside.",dress warn aunt love neatness precision fasten button grey frock tie hair smooth brown tangle _could_ tie absorb weighty care forget cuckoo time sit breakfast aunt remember remind little remark make friendly robin terrace walk 
33,"""Oh, aunt,"" she exclaimed, stopping short half-way the journey to her mouth of a spoonful of bread and milk, ""have you got a cuckoo in a cage?""",aunt exclaim stop short half way journey mouth spoonful bread milk get cuckoo cage 
34,"""A cuckoo in a cage,"" repeated her elder aunt, Miss Grizzel; ""what is the child talking about?""",cuckoo cage repeat elder aunt child talk 
35,"""In a cage!"" echoed Miss Tabitha, ""a cuckoo in a cage!""",cage echoe cuckoo cage 
36,"""There is a cuckoo somewhere in the house,"" said Griselda; ""I heard it in the night. It couldn't have been out-of-doors, could it? It would be too cold.""",be cuckoo house say hear night door cold 
37,"The aunts looked at each other with a little smile. ""So like her grandmother,"" they whispered. Then said Miss Grizzel--",aunt look other little smile grandmother whisper say 
38,"""We have a cuckoo, my dear, though it isn't in a cage, and it isn't exactly the sort of cuckoo you are thinking of. It lives in a clock.""",have cuckoo dear cage sort cuckoo think live clock 
39,"""In a clock,"" repeated Miss Tabitha, as if to confirm her sister's statement.",clock repeat confirm sister statement 
40,"""In a clock!"" exclaimed Griselda, opening her grey eyes very wide.",clock exclaim open grey eye wide 
41,"It sounded something like the three bears, all speaking one after the other, only Griselda's voice was not like Tiny's; it was the loudest of the three.",sound bear speak other voice loudest 
42,"""In a clock!"" she exclaimed; ""but it can't be alive, then?""",clock exclaim alive 
43,"""Why not?"" said Miss Grizzel.",say 
44,"""I don't know,"" replied Griselda, looking puzzled.",know reply look puzzle 
45,"""I knew a little girl once,"" pursued Miss Grizzel, ""who was quite of opinion the cuckoo _was_ alive, and nothing would have persuaded her it was not. Finish your breakfast, my dear, and then if you like you shall come with me and see the cuckoo for yourself.""",know little girl pursue opinion cuckoo _was_ alive persuade finish breakfast dear like come see cuckoo 
46,"""Thank you, Aunt Grizzel,"" said Griselda, going on with her bread and milk.",thank say go bread milk 
47,"""Yes,"" said Miss Tabitha, ""you shall see the cuckoo for yourself.""",say see cuckoo 
48,"""Thank you, Aunt Tabitha,"" said Griselda. It was rather a bother to have always to say ""thank you,"" or ""no, thank you,"" twice, but Griselda thought it was polite to do so, as Aunt Tabitha always repeated everything that Aunt Grizzel said. It wouldn't have mattered so much if Aunt Tabitha had said it _at once_ after Miss Grizzel, but as she generally made a little pause between, it was sometimes rather awkward. But of course it was better to say ""thank you"" or ""no, thank you"" twice over than to hurt Aunt Tabitha's feelings.",thank say bother have say thank thank think polite do repeat say matter say once_ make little pause awkward course good say thank thank hurt feeling 
49,"After breakfast Aunt Grizzel was as good as her word. She took Griselda through several of the rooms in the house, pointing out all the curiosities, and telling all the histories of the rooms and their contents; and Griselda liked to listen, only in every room they came to, she wondered _when_ they would get to the room where lived the cuckoo.",breakfast good word take several room house point curiosity tell history room content like listen room come wonder get room live cuckoo 
50,"Aunt Tabitha did not come with them, for she was rather rheumatic. On the whole, Griselda was not sorry. It would have taken such a _very_ long time, you see, to have had all the histories twice over, and possibly, if Griselda had got tired, she might have forgotten about the ""thank you's"" or ""no, thank you's"" twice over.",come rheumatic whole sorry take _very_ long time see have history get tired forget thank thank 
51,"The old house looked quite as queer and quaint by daylight as it had seemed the evening before; almost more so indeed, for the view from the windows added to the sweet, odd ""old-fashionedness"" of everything.",old house look queer quaint daylight seem evening view window add sweet odd old fashionedness 
52,"""We have beautiful roses in summer,"" observed Miss Grizzel, catching sight of the direction in which the child's eyes were wandering.",have beautiful rose summer observe catching sight direction child eye wonder 
53,"""I wish it was summer. I do love summer,"" said Griselda. ""But there is a very rosy scent in the rooms even now, Aunt Grizzel, though it is winter, or nearly winter.""",wish summer love summer say be rosy scent room winter winter 
54,Miss Grizzel looked pleased.,look pleased 
55,"""My pot-pourri,"" she explained.",pot -pourri explain 
56,"They were just then standing in what she called the ""great saloon,"" a handsome old room, furnished with gold-and-white chairs, that must once have been brilliant, and faded yellow damask hangings. A feeling of awe had crept over Griselda as they entered this ancient drawing-room. What grand parties there must have been in it long ago! But as for dancing in it _now_--dancing, or laughing, or chattering--such a thing was quite impossible to imagine!",stand call great saloon handsome old room furnish gold white chair brilliant fade yellow damask hanging feeling awe creep enter ancient draw room grand party dancing _now_ dancing laugh chatter thing impossible imagine 
57,"Miss Grizzel crossed the room to where stood in one corner a marvellous Chinese cabinet, all black and gold and carving. It was made in the shape of a temple, or a palace--Griselda was not sure which. Any way, it was very delicious and wonderful. At the door stood, one on each side, two solemn mandarins; or, to speak more correctly, perhaps I should say, a mandarin and his wife, for the right-hand figure was evidently intended to be a lady.",cross room stand corner marvellous chinese cabinet black gold carving make shape temple palace sure way delicious wonderful door stand side solemn mandarin speak say mandarin wife right hand figure intend lady 
58,"Miss Grizzel gently touched their heads. Forthwith, to Griselda's astonishment, they began solemnly to nod.",touch head astonishment begin nod 
59,"""Oh, how do you make them do that, Aunt Grizzel?"" she exclaimed.",make do exclaim 
60,"""Never you mind, my dear; it wouldn't do for _you_ to try to make them nod. They wouldn't like it,"" replied Miss Grizzel mysteriously. ""Respect to your elders, my dear, always remember that. The mandarins are _many_ years older than you--older than I myself, in fact.""",mind dear do try make nod like reply respect elder dear remember mandarin _many_ year old old fact 
61,"Griselda wondered, if this were so, how it was that Miss Grizzel took such liberties with them herself, but she said nothing.",wonder take such liberty say 
62,"""Here is my last summer's pot-pourri,"" continued Miss Grizzel, touching a great china jar on a little stand, close beside the cabinet. ""You may smell it, my dear.""",last summer pot -pourri continue touch great china jar little stand close cabinet smell dear 
63,"Nothing loth, Griselda buried her round little nose in the fragrant leaves.",bury round little nose fragrant leave 
64,"""It's lovely,"" she said. ""May I smell it whenever I like, Aunt Grizzel?""",lovely say smell like 
65,"""We shall see,"" replied her aunt. ""It isn't _every_ little girl, you know, that we could trust to come into the great saloon alone.""",see reply aunt _every_ little girl know trust come great saloon 
66,"""No,"" said Griselda meekly.",say 
67,"Miss Grizzel led the way to a door opposite to that by which they had entered. She opened it and passed through, Griselda following, into a small ante-room.",lead way door opposite enter open pass follow small ante- room 
68,"""It is on the stroke of ten,"" said Miss Grizzel, consulting her watch; ""now, my dear, you shall make acquaintance with our cuckoo.""",stroke say consult watch dear make acquaintance cuckoo 
69,"The cuckoo ""that lived in a clock!"" Griselda gazed round her eagerly. Where was the clock? She could see nothing in the least like one, only up on the wall in one corner was what looked like a miniature house, of dark brown carved wood. It was not so _very_ like a house, but it certainly had a roof--a roof with deep projecting eaves; and, looking closer, yes, it _was_ a clock, after all, only the figures, which had once been gilt, had grown dim with age, like everything else, and the hands at a little distance were hardly to be distinguished from the face.",cuckoo live clock gaze clock see least wall corner look miniature house dark brown carve wood house have roof roof deep project eave look close clock figure gilt grow dim age else hand little distance distinguish face 
70,"Miss Grizzel stood perfectly still, looking up at the clock; Griselda beside her, in breathless expectation. Presently there came a sort of distant rumbling. _Something_ was going to happen. Suddenly two little doors above the clock face, which Griselda had not known were there, sprang open with a burst and out flew a cuckoo, flapped his wings, and uttered his pretty cry, ""Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!"" Miss Grizzel counted aloud, ""Seven, eight, nine, ten."" ""Yes, he never makes a mistake,"" she added triumphantly. ""All these long years I have never known him wrong. There are no such clocks made nowadays, I can assure you, my dear.""",stand look clock breathless expectation come sort distant rumbling go happen little door clock face know spring open burst fly cuckoo flapp wing utter pretty cry cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo count make mistake add long year know wrong be such clock make assure dear 
71,"""But _is_ it a clock? Isn't he alive?"" exclaimed Griselda. ""He looked at me and nodded his head, before he flapped his wings and went in to his house again--he did indeed, aunt,"" she said earnestly; ""just like saying, 'How do you do?' to me.""",clock alive exclaim look nod head flapp wing go house aunt say say do 
72,"Again Miss Grizzel smiled, the same odd yet pleased smile that Griselda had seen on her face at breakfast. ""Just what Sybilla used to say,"" she murmured. ""Well, my dear,"" she added aloud, ""it is quite right he _should_ say, 'How do you do?' to you. It is the first time he has seen _you_, though many a year ago he knew your dear grandmother, and your father, too, when he was a little boy. You will find him a good friend, and one that can teach you many lessons.""",smile same odd pleased smile see face breakfast use say murmure dear add right say do first time see many year know dear grandmother father little boy find good friend teach many lesson 
73,"""What, Aunt Grizzel?"" inquired Griselda, looking puzzled.",inquire look puzzle 
74,"""Punctuality, for one thing, and faithful discharge of duty,"" replied Miss Grizzel.",punctuality thing faithful discharge duty reply 
75,"""May I come to see the cuckoo--to watch for him coming out, sometimes?"" asked Griselda, who felt as if she could spend all day looking up at the clock, watching for her little friend's appearance.",come see cuckoo watch come ask feel spend day look clock watch little friend appearance 
76,"""You will see him several times a day,"" said her aunt, ""for it is in this little room I intend you to prepare your tasks. It is nice and quiet, and nothing to disturb you, and close to the room where your Aunt Tabitha and I usually sit.""",see several time day say aunt little room intend prepare task nice quiet disturb room sit 
77,"So saying, Miss Grizzel opened a second door in the little ante-room, and, to Griselda's surprise, at the foot of a short flight of stairs through another door, half open, she caught sight of her Aunt Tabitha, knitting quietly by the fire, in the room in which they had breakfasted.",say open second door little ante room surprise foot short flight stair door half open catch sight knitting fire room breakfast 
78,"""What a _very_ funny house it is, Aunt Grizzel,"" she said, as she followed her aunt down the steps. ""Every room has so many doors, and you come back to where you were just when you think you are ever so far off. I shall never be able to find my way about.""",_very_ funny house say follow aunt step room have many door come think able find way 
79,"""Oh yes, you will, my dear, very soon,"" said her aunt encouragingly.",dear say aunt 
80,"""She is very kind,"" thought Griselda; ""but I wish she wouldn't call my lessons tasks. It makes them sound so dreadfully hard. But, any way, I'm glad I'm to do them in the room where that dear cuckoo lives.""",kind think wish call lesson task make sound hard way glad do room dear cuckoo live
