1,CHAPTER XVII.,
2," On the Monday morning Alfred and Martin went to the cow-house, and slaughtered the bullock which they had obtained from the commandant of the fort. When it was skinned it was cut up, and carried to the storehouse, where it was hung up for their winter consumption.",morning go cow house slaughter bullock obtain commandant fort skinned cut carry storehouse hang winter consumption 
3,"As the party were sitting down to dinner, they were greeted by Captain Sinclair and a young lieutenant of the garrison. It hardly need be said that the whole family were delighted to see them. They had come overland on their snow-shoes, and brought some partridges, or grouse, as they are sometimes called, which they had shot on their way. Captain Sinclair had obtained leave from the commandant to come over and see how the Campbells were getting on. He had no news of any importance, as they had had no recent communications with Quebec or Montreal; all was well at the fort, and Colonel Forster had sent his compliments, and begged, if he could be useful, that they would let him know. Captain Sinclair and his friend sat down to dinner, and talked more than they ate, asking questions about every thing.",party sit dinner greet young lieutenant garrison need say whole family delighted see come snow shoe bring partridge grouse call shoot way obtain leave commandant come see get have news importance have recent communication fort send compliment begg useful let know friend sit dinner talk eat ask question thing

7,"""We _have_ been troubled with them,"" replied Emma; ""at least with their howlings at night, which make me tremble as I lie awake in bed.""",trouble reply least howling night make tremble lie bed 
8,"""Never mind their howling, Miss Emma; we have plenty of them round the fort, I can assure you; unless attacked, they will not attack you, at least, I never knew an instance, although I must confess that I have heard of them.""",mind howling have plenty fort assure attack attack least know instance confess hear

11,"""We will manage it, I have no doubt,"" said Mr. Campbell.",manage have doubt say 
12,"""And if you could manage, Captain Sinclair,"" said Emma, somewhat archly, ""as you say that they are not dangerous animals, to bring us a few skins to-night, it would make the matter easy.""",manage say say dangerous animal bring few skin night make matter easy 
13,"""Emma, how can you talk such nonsense?"" cried Mary Percival. ""Why should you ask a guest to undertake such a service? Why have you not proposed it to Alfred or Henry, or even Martin?""",talk such nonsense cry ask guest undertake service propose 
14,"""We will both try, if you please,"" replied Alfred.",try reply 
15,"""I must put my veto on any such attempts, Alfred,"" said Mr. Campbell. ""We have sufficient danger to meet without running into it voluntarily, and we have no occasion for wolves' skins just now. I shall, however, venture to ask your assistance to-morrow morning. We wish to haul up the fishing-punt before the ice sets in on the lake, and we are not sufficiently strong-handed.""",put veto such attempt say have sufficient danger meet run have occasion wolf skin venture ask assistance morning wish haul fishing punt ice set lake strong handed 
16,"During the day Captain Sinclair took Alfred aside to know if the old hunter had obtained any information relative to the Indians. Alfred replied that they expected him every day, but as yet had not received any communication from him. Captain Sinclair stated that they were equally ignorant at the fort as to what had been finally arranged, and that Colonel Forster was in hopes that the hunter would by this time have obtained some intelligence.",day take know old hunter obtain information relative reply expect day receive communication state ignorant fort arrange hope hunter time obtain intelligence 
17,"""I should not be surprised if Malachi Bone were to come here to-morrow morning,"" replied Alfred. ""He has been away a long while, and, I am sure, is as anxious to have John with him as John is impatient to go.""",surprise come morning reply long while sure anxious have impatient go 
18,"""Well, I hope he will; I shall be glad to have something to tell the Colonel, as I made the request upon that ground. I believe, however, that he was very willing that I should find an excuse for coming here, as he is more anxious about your family than I could have supposed. How well your cousin Mary is looking.""",hope glad have tell make request ground believe willing find excuse come anxious family suppose cousin look 
19,"""Yes; and so is Emma, I think. She has grown half a head since she left England. By the by, you have to congratulate me on my obtaining my rank as lieutenant.""",think grow head leave by have congratulate obtain rank lieutenant 
20,"""I do indeed, my dear fellow,"" replied Captain Sinclair. ""They will be pleased to hear it at the fort. When will you come over?""",dear fellow reply pleased hear fort come 
21,"""As soon as I can manage to trot a little faster on these snow-shoes. If, however, the old hunter does not come to-morrow, I will go to the fort as soon as he brings us any news.""",manage trot little fast snow shoe old hunter come go fort bring news 
22,"The accession to their party made them all very lively, and the evening passed away very agreeably. At night, Captain Sinclair and Mr. Gwynne were ushered into the large bedroom, where all the younger male portion of the family slept, and which, as we before stated, had two spare bed-places.",accession party make lively evening pass night usher large bedroom young male portion family sleep state have spare bed place 
23,"The next morning, Captain Sinclair would have accompanied the Miss Percivals on their milking expedition, but as his services were required to haul up the fishing punt, he was obliged to go down, with all the rest of the men, to assist; Percival and John were the only ones left at home with Mrs. Campbell. John, after a time, having, as usual, rubbed down his rifle, threw it on his shoulder, and, calling the dogs which lay about, sallied forth for a walk, followed by the whole pack except old Sancho, who invariably accompanied the girls to the cow-house.",next morning accompany milk expedition service require haul fishing punt oblige go rest man assist only one leave home time have usual rub rifle throw shoulder call dog lay sall walk follow whole pack old accompany girl cow -house 
24,"Mary and Emma tripped over the new-beaten snow-path to the cow-house, merry and cheerful, with their pails in their hands, Emma laughing at Captain Sinclair's disappointment at not being permitted to accompany them. They had just arrived at the cow-house, when old Sancho barked furiously, and sprang to the side of the building behind them, and in a moment afterward rolled down the snowheap which he had sprung over, holding on and held fast by a large black wolf. The struggle was not very long, and during the time that it lasted the girls were so panic-struck, that they remained like statues within two yards of the animals. Gradually the old dog was overpowered by the repeated snapping bites of the wolf, yet he fought nobly to the last, when he dropped under the feet of the wolf, his tongue hanging out, and bleeding profusely and lifeless. As soon as his adversary was overpowered, the enraged animal, with his feet upon the body of the dog, bristling his hair and showing his powerful teeth, was evidently about to attack the young women. Emma threw her arm around Mary's waist, advancing her body so as to save her sister. Mary attempted the same, and then they remained waiting in horror for the expected spring of the animal, when of a sudden the other dogs came rushing forward, cheered on by John, and flew upon the animal. Their united strength soon tore him down to the ground, and John coming up, as the wolf defended himself against his new assailants, put the muzzle of his rifle to the animal's head, and shot it dead.",trip new beat snow path cow house merry cheerful pail hand laugh disappointment permit accompany arrive cow house old bark spring side building moment roll snowheap spring hold hold large black wolf struggle long time last girl panic strike remain statue yard animal old dog overpower repeat snapping bite wolf fight last drop foot wolf tongue hang bleed lifeless adversary overpower enrage animal foot body dog bristle hair show powerful tooth about attack young woman throw arm waist advance body save sister attempt same remain wait horror expect spring animal sudden other dog come rush cheer fly animal united strength tore ground come wolf defend new assailant put muzzle rifle animal head shoot dead 
25,"The two sisters had held up during the whole of this alarming struggle; but as soon as they perceived the wolf was dead and that they were safe, Mary could stand no longer, and sank down on her knees, supporting her sister, who had become insensible.",sister hold whole alarming struggle perceive wolf dead safe stand sink knee support sister become insensible 
26,"If John showed gallantry in shooting the wolf, he certainly showed very little toward his cousins. He looked at Mary, nodded his head toward the wolf's body, and saying ""He's dead,"" shouldered his rifle, turned round and walked back to the house.",show gallantry shoot wolf show little cousin look nod head wolf body say dead shoulder rifle turn walk house 
27,"On his return he found that the party had just come back from hauling up the punt, and were waiting the return of the Miss Percivals to go to breakfast.",return find party come haul punt wait return miss go breakfast

40,"""Merciful Heaven!"" cried Mr. Campbell, as Mrs. Campbell turned pale; and Alfred, Captain Sinclair, Martin, and Henry, seizing their rifles, darted out from the house, and ran with all speed in the direction of the cow-house.",merciful heaven cry turn pale seize rifle dart house run speed direction cow -house

44,"""I wasn't asked,"" replied John.",ask reply 
45,"In the meantime the other party had gained the cow-house; and, to their horror, beheld the wolf and dog dead, and the two young women lying on the snow, close to the two animals; for Mary had fainted away shortly after John had walked off. They rushed toward the bodies of the two girls, and soon discovered that they were not hurt. In a short time they were recovered, and were supported by the young men to the house.",meantime other party gain cow house horror beheld wolf dog dead young woman lie snow close animal faint walk rush body girl discover hurt short time recover support young man house 
46,"As soon as they arrived, Mrs. Campbell took them into their room, that they might rally their spirits, and in a quarter of an hour returned to the party outside, who eagerly inquired how they were.",arrive take room rally spirit quarter hour return party inquire 
47,"""They are much more composed,"" replied Mrs. Campbell; ""and Emma has begun to laugh again; but her laugh is rather hysterical and forced; they will come out at dinner-time. It appears they are indebted to John for their preservation, for they say the wolf was about to spring upon them when he came to their assistance. We ought to be very grateful to Heaven for their preservation. I had no idea, after what Martin said about the wolves, that they were so dangerous.""",compose reply begin laugh laugh hysterical force come dinner time appear indebt preservation say wolf about spring come assistance grateful preservation have idea say wolf dangerous 
48,"""Why, ma'am, it is I that am most to blame, and that's the fact,"" replied Martin. ""When we killed the bullock I threw the offal on the heap of snow close to the cow-lodge, meaning that the wolves and other animals might eat it at night, but it seems this animal was hungry, and had not left his meal when the dog attacked him, and that made the beast so _rily_ and savage.""",most blame fact reply kill bullock throw offal heap snow cow lodge mean wolf other animal eat night seem animal hungry leave meal dog attack make beast _rily_ savage 
49,"""Yes; it was the fault of Martin and me,"" replied Alfred. ""Thank Heaven it's no worse!""",fault reply thank bad 
50,"""So far from it being a subject of regret, I consider it one of thankfulness,"" replied Mr. Campbell. ""This might have happened when there was no one to assist, and our dear girls might have been torn to pieces. Now that we know the danger, we may guard against it for the future.""",subject regret consider thankfulness reply happen be assist dear girl tear piece know danger guard future 
51,"""Yes, sir,"" replied Martin; ""in future some of us will drive the cows home, to be milked every morning and evening; inside the palisade there will be no danger. Master John, you have done well. You see, ma'am,"" continued Martin, ""what I said has come true. A rifle in the hands of a child is as deadly a weapon as in the hands of a strong man.""",sir reply future drive cow milk morning evening palisade be danger master do see continue say come true rifle hand child deadly weapon hand strong man

53,"""Mother called me naughty,"" replied John, rather sulkily.",mother call naughty reply 
54,"""Yes, John, I called you naughty, for not telling us the wolf was dead, and leaving us to suppose your cousins were in danger; not for killing the wolf. Now I kiss you, and thank you for your bravery and good conduct.""",call naughty tell wolf dead leave suppose cousin danger kill wolf kiss thank bravery good conduct 
55,"""I shall tell all the officers at the fort what a gallant little fellow you are, John,"" said Captain Sinclair; ""there are very few of them who have shot a wolf, and what is more, John, I have a beautiful dog, which one of the officers gave me the other day in exchange for a pony, and I will bring it over, and make it a present to you for your own dog. He will hunt any thing, and he is very powerful--quite able to master a wolf, if you meet with one. He is half mastiff and half Scotch deerhound, and he stands as high as this,"" continued Captain Sinclair, holding his hand about as high as John's shoulder.",tell officer fort gallant little fellow say be few shoot wolf more have beautiful dog officer give other day exchange pony bring make present own dog hunt thing powerful able master wolf meet half mastiff half deerhound stand high continue hold hand high shoulder

67,"""Well, he'll be a regular keen hunter,"" observed Martin, ""I dare say old Bone has taught him to flay an animal. However, I'll go and help him, for it's a real good skin."" So saying, Martin followed John.",regular keen hunter observe say old teach flay animal go help real good skin say follow 
68,"""Martin ought to have known better than to leave the offal where he did,"" observed Captain Sinclair.",know good leave offal observe 
69,"""We must not be too hard, Captain Sinclair,"" said Alfred. ""Martin has a contempt for wolves, and that wolf would not have stood his ground had it been a man instead of two young women who were in face of him. Wolves are very cunning, and I know will attack a woman or child when they will fly from a man. Besides, it is very unusual for a wolf to remain till daylight, even when there is offal to tempt him. It was the offal, the animal's extreme hunger, and the attack of the dog--a combination of circumstances--which produced the event. I do not see that Martin can be blamed, as one can not foresee every thing.""",hard say have contempt wolf wolf stand ground man young woman face wolf cunning know attack woman child fly man unusual wolf remain daylight be offal temp offal animal extreme hunger attack dog combination circumstance produce event see blame foresee thing

71,"""Are there any other animals to fear?"" inquired Mrs. Campbell.",be other animal fear inquire 
72,"""The bear is now safe for the winter in the hollow of some tree or under some root, where he has made a den. It will not come out till the spring. The catamount or panther is a much more dangerous animal than the wolf; but it is scarce. I do think, however, that the young ladies should not venture out, unless with some rifles in company, for fear of another mischance. We have plenty of lynxes here; but I doubt if they would attack even a child, although they fight when assailed, and bite and claw severely.""",bear safe winter hollow tree root make dan come spring catamount panther dangerous animal wolf scarce think young lady venture rifle company fear mischance have plenty lynxe doubt attack child fight assail bite claw 
73,"The Misses Percival now made their appearance. Emma was very merry, but Mary rather grave. Captain Sinclair, having shaken hands with them both, said--",make appearance merry grave shake hand say 
74,"""Why, Emma, you appear to have recovered sooner than your sister!""",appear recover sister 
75,"""Yes,"" replied Emma; ""but I was much more frightened than she was, and she supported me, or I should have fallen at the wolf's feet. I yielded to my fears; Mary held up against hers; so, as her exertions were much greater than mine, she has not recovered from them so soon. The fact is, Mary is brave when there is danger, and I am only brave when there is none.""",reply frighten support fall wolf foot yield fear hold exertion great recover fact brave be danger brave be
