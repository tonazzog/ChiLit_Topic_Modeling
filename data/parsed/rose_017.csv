1,CHAPTER XVI. HOW HEDZOFF RODE BACK AGAIN TO KING GIGLIO,rode 
2,"Captain Hedzoff rode away when King Padella uttered this cruel command, having done his duty in delivering the message with which his royal master had entrusted him. Of course he was very sorry for Rosalba, but what could he do?",ride utter cruel command do duty deliver message royal master entrust course sorry do 
3,"So he returned to King Giglio’s camp, and found the young monarch in a disturbed state of mind, smoking cigars in the royal tent. His Majesty’s agitation was not appeased by the news that was brought by his ambassador. ‘The brutal ruthless ruffian royal wretch!’ Giglio exclaimed. ‘As England’s poesy has well remarked, “The man that lays his hand upon a woman, save in the way of kindness, is a villain.” Ha, Hedzoff!’",return camp find young monarch disturbed state mind smoke cigar royal tent agitation appease news bring ambassador brutal ruthless ruffian royal wretch exclaim poesy remark man lay hand woman save way kindness villain

6,"‘Faith, good my liege, I had no heart to look and see a beauteous lady boiling down; I took your royal message to Padella, and bore his back to you. I told him you would hold Prince Bulbo answerable. He only said that he had twenty sons as good as Bulbo, and forthwith he bade the ruthless executioners proceed.’",faith good liege have heart look see beauteous lady boil take royal message bear back tell hold answerable say have son good bid ruthless executioner proceed 
7,"‘O cruel father--O unhappy son!’ cried the King. ‘Go, some of you, and bring Prince Bulbo hither.’",cruel father unhappy son cry go bring 
8,"Bulbo was brought in chains, looking very uncomfortable. Though a prisoner, he had been tolerably happy, perhaps because his mind was at rest, and all the fighting was over, and he was playing at marbles with his guards when the King sent for him.",bring chain look uncomfortable prisoner happy mind rest fighting play marble guard send 
9,"‘Oh, my poor Bulbo,’ said His Majesty, with looks of infinite compassion, ‘hast thou heard the news?’ (for you see Giglio wanted to break the thing gently to the Prince), ‘thy brutal father has condemned Rosalba--p-p-p-ut her to death, P-p-p-prince Bulbo!’",poor say look infinite compassion hast hear news see want break thing brutal father condemn p p p death p p p prince 
10,"‘What, killed Betsinda! Boo-hoo-hoo,’ cried out Bulbo. ‘Betsinda! pretty Betsinda! dear Betsinda! She was the dearest little girl in the world. I love her better twenty thousand times even than Angelica,’ and he went on expressing his grief in so hearty and unaffected a manner that the King was quite touched by it, and said, shaking Bulbo’s hand, that he wished he had known Bulbo sooner.",kill cry dear dearest little girl world love good time go express grief hearty unaffected manner touch say shake hand wish know 
11,"Bulbo, quite unconsciously, and meaning for the best, offered to come and sit with His Majesty, and smoke a cigar with him, and console him. The ROYAL KINDNESS supplied Bulbo with a cigar; he had not had one, he said, since he was taken prisoner.",mean good offer come sit smoke cigar console royal supply cigar have say take prisoner 
12,"And now think what must have been the feelings of the most MERCIFUL OF MONARCHS, when he informed his prisoner that, in consequence of King Padella’s cruel and DASTARDLY BEHAVIOUR to Rosalba, Prince Bulbo must instantly be executed! The noble Giglio could not restrain his tears, nor could the Grenadiers, nor the officers, nor could Bulbo himself, when the matter was explained to him, and he was brought to understand that His Majesty’s promise, of course, was ABOVE EVERY THING, and Bulbo must submit. So poor Bulbo was led out, Hedzoff trying to console him, by pointing out that if he had won the battle of Bombardaro, he might have hanged Prince Giglio. ‘Yes! But that is no comfort to me now!’ said poor Bulbo; nor indeed was it, poor fellow!",think feeling merciful inform prisoner consequence cruel dastardly behaviour execute noble restrain tear officer matter explain bring understand promise course thing submit poor lead try console point win battle hang comfort say poor poor fellow 
13,"He was told the business would be done the next morning at eight, and was taken back to his dungeon, where every attention was paid to him. The gaoler’s wife sent him tea, and the turnkey’s daughter begged him to write his name in her album, where a many gentlemen had written it on like occasions! ‘Bother your album!’ says Bulbo. The Undertaker came and measured him for the handsomest coffin which money could buy--even this didn’t console Bulbo. The Cook brought him dishes which he once used to like; but he wouldn’t touch them: he sat down and began writing an adieu to Angelica, as the clock kept always ticking, and the hands drawing nearer to next morning. The Barber came in at night, and offered to shave him for the next day. Prince Bulbo kicked him away, and went on writing a few words to Princess Angelica, as the clock kept always ticking, and the hands hopping nearer and nearer to next morning. He got up on the top of a hatbox, on the top of a chair, on the top of his bed, on the top of his table, and looked out to see whether he might escape as the clock kept always ticking and the hands drawing nearer, and nearer, and nearer.",tell business do next morning take dungeon attention pay gaoler wife send tea turnkey daughter begg write name album many gentleman write occasion bother album say come measure handsomest coffin money buy console bring dish use like touch sit begin write adieu clock keep tick hand draw next morning come night offer shave next day kick go write few word clock keep tick hand hopping next morning get top hatbox top chair top bed top table look see escape clock keep tick hand draw 
14,"But looking out of the window was one thing, and jumping another: and the town clock struck seven. So he got into bed for a little sleep, but the gaoler came and woke him, and said, ‘Git up, your Royal Ighness, if you please, it’s TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT!’",look window thing jump town clock strike get bed little sleep gaoler come wake say git royal minute 
15,"So poor Bulbo got up: he had gone to bed in his clothes (the lazy boy), and he shook himself, and said he didn’t mind about dressing, or having any breakfast, thank you; and he saw the soldiers who had come for him. ‘Lead on!’ he said; and they led the way, deeply affected; and they came into the courtyard, and out into the square, and there was King Giglio come to take leave of him, and His Majesty most kindly shook hands with him, and the ‘Take off that marched on:--when hark!",poor get go bed clothes lazy boy shake say mind dress have breakfast thank see soldier come lead say lead way affect come courtyard square be come take leave shake hand take march hark

18,"The fact is, that when Captain Hedzoff entered into the court of Snapdragon Castle, and was discoursing with King Padella, the lions made a dash at the open gate, gobbled up the six beef-eaters in a jiffy, and away they went with Rosalba on the back of one of them, and they carried her, turn and turn about, till they came to the city where Prince Giglio’s army was encamped.",fact enter court discours lion make dash open gate gobble beef eater jiffy go back carry turn turn come city army encamp 
19,"When the KING heard of the QUEEN’S arrival, you may think how he rushed out of his breakfast-room to hand Her Majesty off her lion! The lions were grown as fat as pigs now, having had Hogginarmo and all those beefeaters, and were so tame, anybody might pat them.",hear arrival think rush breakfast room hand lion lion grow fat pig have beefeater tame pat 
20,"While Giglio knelt (most gracefully) and helped the Princess, Bulbo, for his part, rushed up and kissed the lion. He flung his arms round the forest monarch; he hugged him, and laughed and cried for joy. ‘Oh, you darling old beast, oh, how glad I am to see you, and the dear, dear Bets--that is, Rosalba.’",knolt help part rush kiss lion flung arm forest monarch hugge laugh cry joy darling old beast glad see dear dear bet 
21,"‘What, is it you? poor Bulbo!’ said the Queen.’ Oh, how glad I am to see you,’ and she gave him her hand to kiss.
