3," ""How ashamed I am,"" Jack said, ""to think that you don't know even your letters!""",ashamed say think know letter 
4,"Mopsa replied that she thought that did not signify, and then she and Jack began to play at jumping from the boat on to the bank, and back again; and afterwards, as not a single fairy could be seen, they had breakfast with the apple-woman.",reply think signify begin play jump boat bank single fairy see have breakfast apple woman 
5,"""Where is the Queen?"" asked Jack.",ask 
6,"The apple-woman answered, ""It's not the fashion to ask questions in Fairyland.""",apple woman answer fashion ask question 
7,"""That's a pity,"" said Jack, ""for there are several things that I particularly want to know about this country. Mayn't I even ask how big it is?""",pity say be several thing want know country ask big 
8,"""How big?"" said Mopsa,--little Mopsa looking as wise as possible. ""Why, the same size as your world, of course.""",big say little look wise possible same size world course 
9,"Jack laughed. ""It's the same world that you call yours,"" continued Mopsa; ""and when I'm a little older, I'll explain it all to you.""",laugh same world call continue little old explain 
10,"""If it's our world,"" said Jack, ""why are none of us in it, excepting me and the apple-woman?""",world say except apple woman 
11,"""That's because you've got something in your world that you call TIME,"" said Mopsa; ""so you talk about NOW, and you talk about THEN.""",get world call time say talk talk 
12,"""And don't you?"" asked Jack.",ask 
13,"""I do if I want to make you understand,"" said Mopsa.",do want make understand say 
14,"The apple-woman laughed, and said, ""To think of the pretty thing talking so queen-like already! Yes, that's right, and just what the grown-up fairies say. Go on, and explain it to him if you can.""",apple woman laugh say think pretty thing talk queen right grow fairy say go explain 
15,"""You know,"" said Mopsa, ""that your people say there was a time when there were none of them in the world,--a time before they were made. Well, THIS is that time. This is long ago.""",know say person say be time be world time make time long 
16,"""Nonsense!"" said Jack. ""Then how do I happen to be here?""",nonsense say happen 
17,"""Because,"" said Mopsa, ""when the albatross brought you, she did not fly with you a long way off, but a long way back,--hundreds and hundreds of years. This is your world, as you can see; but none of your people are here, because they are not made yet. I don't think any of them will be made for a thousand years.""",say albatross bring fly long way long way hundred hundred year world see person make think make year 
18,"""But I saw the old ships,"" answered Jack, ""in the enchanted bay.""",see old ship answer enchanted bay 
19,"""That was a border country,"" said Mopsa. ""I was asleep while you went through those countries; but these are the real Fairylands.""",border country say asleep go country real 
20,"Jack was very much surprised when he heard Mopsa say these strange things; and as he looked at her, he felt that a sleep was coming over him, and he could not hold up his head. He felt how delightful it was to go to sleep; and though the apple-woman sprang to him, when she observed that he was shutting his eyes, and though he heard her begging and entreating him to keep awake, he did not want to do so; but he let his head sink down on the mossy grass, which was as soft as a pillow, and there, under the shade of a Guelder rose-tree, that kept dropping its white flowerets all over him, he had this dream:",surprised hear say strange thing look feel sleep come hold head feel delightful go sleep apple woman spring observe shut eye hear begg entreat keep want do let head sink mossy grass soft pillow shade rose tree keep drop white floweret have dream 
21,"He thought that Mopsa came running up to him, as he stood by the river, and that he said to her, ""Oh, Mopsa, how old we are! We have lived back to the times before Adam and Eve!""",think come run stand river say old live time 
22,"""Yes,"" said Mopsa; ""but I don't feel old. Let us go down the river, and see what we can find.""",say feel old let go river see find 
23,"So they got into the boat, and it floated into the middle of the river, and then made for the opposite bank, where the water was warm and very muddy, and the river became so very wide that it seemed to be afternoon when they got near enough to see it clearly; and what they saw was a boggy country, green, and full of little rills; but the water,--which, as I told you, was thick and muddy,--the water was full of small holes! You never saw water with eyelet-holes in it; but Jack did. On all sides of the boat he saw holes moving about in pairs, and some were so close that he looked and saw their lining: they were lined with pink, and they snorted! Jack was afraid, but he considered that this was such a long time ago that the holes, whatever they were, could not hurt him; but it made him start, notwithstanding, when a huge flat-head reared itself up close to the boat, and he found that the holes were the nostrils of creatures who kept all the rest of themselves under water.",get boat float middle river make opposite bank water warm muddy river become wide seem afternoon get see see boggy country green full little rill water tell thick muddy water full small hole see water eyelet hole side boat see hole move pair close look see lining line pink snort afraid consider long time hole hurt make start notwithstand huge flat head rear boat find hole nostril creature keep rest water 
24,"In a minute or two, hundreds of ugly flat-heads popped up, and the boat danced among them as they floundered about in the water.",minute hundred ugly flat head pop boat dance flounder water 
25,"""I hope they won't upset us,"" said Jack. ""I wish you would land.""",hope upset say wish land 
26,"Mopsa said she would rather not, because she did not like the hairy elephants.",say like hairy elephant 
27,"""There are no such things as hairy elephants,"" said Jack, in his dream; but he had hardly spoken when out of a wood close at hand some huge creatures, far larger than our elephants, came jogging down to the water. There were forty or fifty of them, and they were covered with what looked like tow. In fact, so coarse was their shaggy hair that they looked as if they were dressed in door-mats; and when they stood still and shook themselves, such clouds of dust flew out that, as it swept over the river, it almost stifled Jack and Mopsa.",be such thing hairy elephant say dream speak wood close hand huge creature large elephant come jogg water be cover look tow fact coarse shaggy hair look dress door mat stand shake such cloud dust fly sweep river stifle 
28,"""Odious!"" exclaimed Jack, sneezing. ""What terrible creatures these are!""",odious exclaim sneez terrible creature 
29,"""Well,"" answered Mopsa, at the other end of the boat (but he could hardly see her for the dust), ""then why do you dream of them?""",answer other end boat see dust dream 
30,"Jack had just decided to dream of something else, when, with a noise greater than fifty trumpets, the elephants, having shaken out all the dust, came thundering down to the water to bathe in the liquid mud. They shook the whole country as they plunged; but that was not all. The awful river-horses rose up, and, with shrill screams, fell upon them, and gave them battle; while up from every rill peeped above the rushes frogs as large as oxen, and with blue and green eyes that gleamed like the eyes of cats.",decide dream else noise great trumpet elephant shake dust come thunder water bathe liquid mud shake whole country plunge awful river horse rise shrill scream fall give battle rill peep rushe frog large oxen blue green eye gleam eye cat 
31,"The frogs croaking, and the shrill trumpeting of the elephants, together with the cries of the river-horses, as all these creatures fought with horn and tusk, and fell on one another, lashing the water into whirlpools, among which the boat danced up and down like a cork,--the blinding spray, and the flapping about of great bats over the boat and in it,--so confused Jack, that Mopsa had spoken to him several times before he answered.",frog croak shrill trumpeting elephant cry river horse creature fight horn tusk fall lash water whirlpool boat dance cork blind spray flap great bat boat confuse speak several time answer 
32,"""O Jack!"" she said, at last; ""if you can't dream any better, I must call the Craken.""",say last dream good call 
33,"""Very well,"" said Jack. ""I'm almost wrapped up and smothered in bats' wings, so call anything you please.""",say wrap smother bat wing call 
34,"Thereupon Mopsa whistled softly, and in a minute or two he saw, almost spanning the river, a hundred yards off, a thing like a rainbow, or a slender bridge, or still more, like one ring or coil of an enormous serpent; and presently the creature's head shot up like a fountain, close to the boat, almost as high as a ship's mast. It was the Craken; and when Mopsa saw it, she began to cry, and said, ""We are caught in this crowd of creatures, and we cannot get away from the land of dreams. Do help us, Craken!""",whistle minute see span river yard thing rainbow slender bridge more ring coil enormous serpent creature head shoot fountain close boat high ship mast see begin cry say catch crowd creature get land dream help 
35,"Some of the bats that hung to the edges of the boat had wings as large as sails; and the first thing the Craken did was to stoop its lithe neck, pick two or three of them off, and eat them.",bat hang edge boat have wing large sail first thing stake lithe neck pick eat 
36,"""You can swim your boat home under my coils where the water is calm,"" the Craken said, ""for she is so extremely old now, that if you do not take care she will drop to pieces before you get back to the present time.""",swim boat home coil water calm say old take care drop piece get present time 
37,"Jack knew it was of no use saying anything to this formidable creature, before whom the river-horses and the elephants were rushing to the shore; but when he looked and saw down the river rainbow behind rainbow,--I mean coil behind coil,--glittering in the sun, like so many glorious arches that did not reach to the banks, he felt extremely glad that this was a dream, and besides that, he thought to himself, ""It's only a fabled monster.""",know use say formidable creature river horse elephant rush shore look see river rainbow rainbow mean coil coil glitter sun many glorious arche reach bank feel glad dream think fabled monster 
38,"""No, it's only a fable to these times,"" said Mopsa, answering his thought; ""but in spite of that we shall have to go through all the rings.""",fable time say answer thought spite have go ring 
39,"They went under one,--silver, green, and blue, and gold. The water dripped from it upon them, and the boat trembled, either because of its great age, or because it felt the rest of the coil underneath.",go silver green blue gold water dripp boat tremble great age feel rest coil 
40,"A good way off was another coil, and they went so safely under that, that Jack felt himself getting used to Crakens, and not afraid. Then they went under thirteen more. These kept getting nearer and nearer together, but, besides that, the fourteenth had not quite such a high span as the former ones; but there were a great many to come, and yet they got lower and lower.",good way coil go feel use afraid go more keep get nearer fourteenth have high span former one be great many come get low low 
41,"Both Jack and Mopsa noticed this, but neither said a word. The thirtieth coil brushed Jack's cap off, then they had to stoop to pass under the two next, and then they had to lie down in the bottom of the boat, and they got through with the greatest difficulty; but still before them was another! The boat was driving straight towards it, and it lay so close to the water that the arch it made was only a foot high. When Jack saw it, he called out, ""No! that I cannot bear. Somebody else may do the rest of this dream. I shall jump overboard.""",notice say word thirtieth coil brush cap have stake pass next have lie bottom boat get great difficulty boat drive lay water arch make foot high see call bear else do rest dream jump 
42,"Mopsa seemed to answer in quite a pleasant voice, as if she was not afraid,--",seem answer pleasant voice afraid 
43,"""No, you'd much better wake."" And then she went on, ""Jack! Jack! why don't you wake!""",wake go wake 
44,"Then all on a sudden Jack opened his eyes, and found that he was lying quietly on the grass, that little Mopsa really had asked him why he did not wake. He saw the Queen too, standing by, looking at him, and saying to herself, ""_I_ did not put him to sleep. _I_ did not put him to sleep.""",sudden open eye find lie grass little ask wake see stand look say put sleep put sleep 
45,"""We don't want any more stories to-day, Queen,"" said the apple-woman, in a disrespectful tone, and she immediately began to sing, clattering some tea-things all the time, for a kettle was boiling on some sticks, and she was going to make tea out of doors:--",want more story day say apple woman disrespectful tone begin sing clatter tea- thing time kettle boil stick go make tea door 
46,"  The marten flew to the finch's nest,     Feathers, and moss, and a wisp of hay:   ""The arrow it sped to thy brown mate's breast;     Low in the broom is thy mate to-day.""",marten fly finch nest moss wisp hay arrow spe brown mate breast lo broom mate day 
47,"  ""Liest thou low, love? low in the broom?     Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay,   Warm the white eggs till I learn his doom.""     She beateth her wings, and away, away.",low love low broom feather moss wisp hay warm white egg learn doom beateth wing 
48,"  ""Ah, my sweet singer, thy days are told     (Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay)!   Thine eyes are dim, and the eggs grow cold.     O mournful morrow! O dark to-day!""",sweet singer day tell feather moss wisp hay eye dim egg grow cold mournful dark day 
49,"  The finch flew back to her cold, cold nest,     Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay,   Mine is the trouble that rent her breast,     And home is silent, and love is clay.",finch fly cold cold nest feather moss wisp hay trouble rent breast home silent love clay 
50,"Jack felt very tired indeed,--as much tired as if he had really been out all day on the river, and gliding under the coils of the Craken. He however rose up, when the apple-woman called him, and drank his tea, and had some fairy bread with it, which refreshed him very much.",feel tired tired day river glide coil rise apple woman call drink tea have fairy bread refresh 
51,"After tea he measured Mopsa again, and found that she had grown up to a higher button. She looked much wiser too, and when he said she must be taught to read she made no objection, so he arranged daisies and buttercups into the forms of the letters, and she learnt nearly all of them that one evening, while crowds of the one-foot-one fairies looked on, hanging from the boughs and sitting in the grass, and shouting out the names of the letters as Mopsa said them. They were very polite to Jack, for they gathered all these flowers for him, and emptied them from their little caps at his feet as fast as he wanted them.",tea measure find grow high button look wise say teach read make objection arrange daisy buttercup form letter learn evening crowd foot fairy look hang bough sit grass shouting name letter say polite gather flower empty little cap foot want
