1,CHAPTER XV. GOOD FALLS SICK,good falls sick 
2,"After the fight was ended, Sir Henry and Good were carried into Twala's hut, where I joined them. They were both utterly exhausted by exertion and loss of blood, and, indeed, my own condition was little better. I am very wiry, and can stand more fatigue than most men, probably on account of my light weight and long training; but that night I was quite done up, and, as is always the case with me when exhausted, that old wound which the lion gave me began to pain. Also my head was aching violently from the blow I had received in the morning, when I was knocked senseless. Altogether, a more miserable trio than we were that evening it would have been difficult to discover; and our only comfort lay in the reflection that we were exceedingly fortunate to be there to feel miserable, instead of being stretched dead upon the plain, as so many thousands of brave men were that night, who had risen well and strong in the morning.",fight end carry hut join exhausted exertion loss blood own condition little good wiry stand more fatigue most man account light weight long training night do case exhaust old wound lion give begin pain head ach blow receive morning knock senseless miserable trio evening difficult discover only comfort lay reflection fortunate feel miserable stretch dead plain many thousand brave man night rise strong morning 
3,"Somehow, with the assistance of the beautiful Foulata, who, since we had been the means of saving her life, had constituted herself our handmaiden, and especially Good's, we managed to get off the chain shirts, which had certainly saved the lives of two of us that day. As I expected, we found that the flesh underneath was terribly contused, for though the steel links had kept the weapons from entering, they had not prevented them from bruising. Both Sir Henry and Good were a mass of contusions, and I was by no means free. As a remedy Foulata brought us some pounded green leaves, with an aromatic odour, which, when applied as a plaster, gave us considerable relief.",assistance beautiful means save life constitute handmaiden manage get chain shirt save life day expect find flesh contuse steel link keep weapon enter prevent bruise mass contusion means free remedy bring pound green leave aromatic odour apply plaster give considerable relief 
4,"But though the bruises were painful, they did not give us such anxiety as Sir Henry's and Good's wounds. Good had a hole right through the fleshy part of his ""beautiful white leg,"" from which he had lost a great deal of blood; and Sir Henry, with other hurts, had a deep cut over the jaw, inflicted by Twala's battle-axe. Luckily Good is a very decent surgeon, and so soon as his small box of medicines was forthcoming, having thoroughly cleansed the wounds, he managed to stitch up first Sir Henry's and then his own pretty satisfactorily, considering the imperfect light given by the primitive Kukuana lamp in the hut. Afterwards he plentifully smeared the injured places with some antiseptic ointment, of which there was a pot in the little box, and we covered them with the remains of a pocket-handkerchief which we possessed.",bruise painful give such anxiety wound good have hole fleshy part beautiful white leg lose great deal blood other hurt have deep cut jaw inflict battle axe decent surgeon small box medicine forthcoming cleanse wound manage stitch first own consider imperfect light give primitive lamp hut smear injure place antiseptic ointment be pot little box cover remains pocket handkerchief possess 
5,"Meanwhile Foulata had prepared us some strong broth, for we were too weary to eat. This we swallowed, and then threw ourselves down on the piles of magnificent karrosses, or fur rugs, which were scattered about the dead king's great hut. By a very strange instance of the irony of fate, it was on Twala's own couch, and wrapped in Twala's own particular karross, that Sir Henry, the man who had slain him, slept that night.",prepare strong broth weary eat swallow throw pile magnificent karross fur rug scatter dead king great hut strange instance irony fate own couch wrap own particular karross man slain sleep night 
6,"I say slept; but after that day's work, sleep was indeed difficult. To begin with, in very truth the air was full",say sleep day work sleep difficult begin truth air full 
7," ""Of farewells to the dying   And mournings for the dead.""",farewell die mourning dead 
8,"From every direction came the sound of the wailing of women whose husbands, sons, and brothers had perished in the battle. No wonder that they wailed, for over twelve thousand men, or nearly a fifth of the Kukuana army, had been destroyed in that awful struggle. It was heart-rending to lie and listen to their cries for those who never would return; and it made me understand the full horror of the work done that day to further man's ambition. Towards midnight, however, the ceaseless crying of the women grew less frequent, till at length the silence was only broken at intervals of a few minutes by a long piercing howl that came from a hut in our immediate rear, which, as I afterwards discovered, proceeded from Gagool ""keening"" over the dead king Twala.",direction come sound wail woman husband son brother perish battle wonder wail man fifth army destroy awful struggle heart rend lie listen cry return make understand full horror work do day further man ambition midnight ceaseless cry woman grow frequent length silence break interval few minute long piercing howl come hut immediate rear discover proceed keening dead king 
9,"After that I got a little fitful sleep, only to wake from time to time with a start, thinking that I was once more an actor in the terrible events of the last twenty-four hours. Now I seemed to see that warrior whom my hand had sent to his last account charging at me on the mountain-top; now I was once more in that glorious ring of Greys, which made its immortal stand against all Twala's regiments upon the little mound; and now again I saw Twala's plumed and gory head roll past my feet with gnashing teeth and glaring eye.",get little fitful sleep wake time time start think actor terrible event last hour seem see warrior hand send last account charge mountain top more glorious ring make immortal stand regiment little mound see plumed gory head roll foot gnashing tooth glaring eye 
10,"At last, somehow or other, the night passed away; but when dawn broke I found that my companions had slept no better than myself. Good, indeed, was in a high fever, and very soon afterwards began to grow light-headed, and also, to my alarm, to spit blood, the result, no doubt, of some internal injury, inflicted during the desperate efforts made by the Kukuana warrior on the previous day to force his big spear through the chain armour. Sir Henry, however, seemed pretty fresh, notwithstanding his wound on the face, which made eating difficult and laughter an impossibility, though he was so sore and stiff that he could scarcely stir.",last other night pass dawn break find companion sleep good good high fever begin grow light headed alarm spit blood result doubt internal injury inflict desperate effort make warrior previous day force big spear chain armour seem fresh notwithstand wound face make eat difficult laughter impossibility sore stiff stir 
11,"About eight o'clock we had a visit from Infadoos, who appeared but little the worse--tough old warrior that he was--for his exertions in the battle, although he informed us that he had been up all night. He was delighted to see us, but much grieved at Good's condition, and shook our hands cordially. I noticed, however, that he addressed Sir Henry with a kind of reverence, as though he were something more than man; and, indeed, as we afterwards found out, the great Englishman was looked on throughout Kukuanaland as a supernatural being. No man, the soldiers said, could have fought as he fought or, at the end of a day of such toil and bloodshed, could have slain Twala, who, in addition to being the king, was supposed to be the strongest warrior in the country, in single combat, shearing through his bull-neck at a stroke. Indeed, that stroke became proverbial in Kukuanaland, and any extraordinary blow or feat of strength was henceforth known as ""Incubu's blow.""",o'clock have visit appear little bad tough old warrior exertion battle inform night delighted see grieve condition shake hand notice address kind reverence more man find great look supernatural being man soldier say fight fight end day such toil bloodshed slain addition king suppose strong warrior country single combat shear bull neck stroke stroke become proverbial extraordinary blow feat strength know blow 
12,"Infadoos told us also that all Twala's regiments had submitted to Ignosi, and that like submissions were beginning to arrive from chiefs in the outlying country. Twala's death at the hands of Sir Henry had put an end to all further chance of disturbance; for Scragga had been his only legitimate son, so there was no rival claimant to the throne left alive.",tell regiment submit submission begin arrive chief outly country death hand put end further chance disturbance only legitimate son be rival claimant throne leave alive 
13,"I remarked that Ignosi had swum to power through blood. The old chief shrugged his shoulders. ""Yes,"" he answered; ""but the Kukuana people can only be kept cool by letting their blood flow sometimes. Many are killed, indeed, but the women are left, and others must soon grow up to take the places of the fallen. After this the land would be quiet for a while.""",remark swum power blood old chief shrugg shoulder answer person keep cool let blood flow many kill woman leave other grow take place fall land quiet while 
14,"Afterwards, in the course of the morning, we had a short visit from Ignosi, on whose brows the royal diadem was now bound. As I contemplated him advancing with kingly dignity, an obsequious guard following his steps, I could not help recalling to my mind the tall Zulu who had presented himself to us at Durban some few months back, asking to be taken into our service, and reflecting on the strange revolutions of the wheel of fortune.",course morning have short visit brow royal diadem bind contemplate advance kingly dignity obsequious guard follow step help recall mind tall present few month ask take service reflect strange revolution wheel fortune

19,"""She is the evil genius of the land,"" he answered, ""and I shall kill her, and all the witch doctors with her!

20,"""Yet she knows much,"" I replied; ""it is easier to destroy knowledge, Ignosi, than to gather it.""",know much reply easy destroy knowledge gather

24,"After Ignosi's visit I went to see Good, and found him quite delirious. The fever set up by his wound seemed to have taken a firm hold of his system, and to be complicated with an internal injury. For four or five days his condition was most critical; indeed, I believe firmly that had it not been for Foulata's indefatigable nursing he must have died.",visit go see good find delirious fever set wound seem take firm hold system complicated internal injury day condition critical believe indefatigable nursing die 
25,"Women are women, all the world over, whatever their colour. Yet somehow it seemed curious to watch this dusky beauty bending night and day over the fevered man's couch, and performing all the merciful errands of a sick-room swiftly, gently, and with as fine an instinct as that of a trained hospital nurse. For the first night or two I tried to help her, and so did Sir Henry as soon as his stiffness allowed him to move, but Foulata bore our interference with impatience, and finally insisted upon our leaving him to her, saying that our movements made him restless, which I think was true. Day and night she watched him and tended him, giving him his only medicine, a native cooling drink made of milk, in which was infused juice from the bulb of a species of tulip, and keeping the flies from settling on him. I can see the whole picture now as it appeared night after night by the light of our primitive lamp; Good tossing to and fro, his features emaciated, his eyes shining large and luminous, and jabbering nonsense by the yard; and seated on the ground by his side, her back resting against the wall of the hut, the soft-eyed, shapely Kukuana beauty, her face, weary as it was with her long vigil, animated by a look of infinite compassion--or was it something more than compassion?",woman woman world colour seem curious watch dusky beauty bending night day fevered man couch perform merciful errand sick room fine instinct train hospital nurse first night try help do stiffness allow move bear interference impatience insist leave say movement make restless think true day night watch tend give only medicine native cooling drink make milk infuse juice bulb species tulip keep fly settle see whole picture appear night night light primitive lamp good toss for feature emaciate eye shine large luminous jabber nonsense yard seat ground side back rest wall hut soft eyed shapely beauty face weary long vigil animate look infinite compassion more compassion

28,"""He will live,"" she said.",live say 
29,"For three hundred yards or more around Twala's chief hut, where the sufferer lay, there was silence; for by the king's order all who lived in the habitations behind it, except Sir Henry and myself, had been removed, lest any noise should come to the sick man's ears. One night, it was the fifth of Good's illness, as was my habit, I went across to see how he was doing before turning in for a few hours.",yard more chief hut sufferer lay be silence king order live habitation remove noise come sick man ear night fifth illness habit go see do turn few hour

32,"""Hush--h--h!"" came from the patch of dark shadow behind Good's head.",come patch dark shadow head 
33,"Then, creeping closer, I saw that he was not dead, but sleeping soundly, with Foulata's taper fingers clasped tightly in his poor white hand. The crisis had passed, and he would live. He slept like that for eighteen hours; and I scarcely like to say it, for fear I should not be believed, but during the entire period did this devoted girl sit by him, fearing that if she moved and drew away her hand it would wake him. What she must have suffered from cramp and weariness, to say nothing of want of food, nobody will ever know; but it is the fact that, when at last he woke, she had to be carried away--her limbs were so stiff that she could not move them.",creep see dead sleep taper finger clasp poor white hand crisis pass live sleep hour like say fear believe entire period do devoted girl sit fear move draw hand wake suffer cramp weariness say want food know fact last wake have carry limb stiff move 
34," After the turn had once been taken, Good's recovery was rapid and complete. It was not till he was nearly well that Sir Henry told him of all he owed to Foulata; and when he came to the story of how she sat by his side for eighteen hours, fearing lest by moving she should wake him, the honest sailor's eyes filled with tears. He turned and went straight to the hut where Foulata was preparing the mid-day meal, for we were back in our old quarters now, taking me with him to interpret in case he could not make his meaning clear to her, though I am bound to say that she understood him marvellously as a rule, considering how extremely limited was his foreign vocabulary.",turn take recovery rapid complete tell owe come story sit side hour fear lest move wake honest sailor eye fill tear turn go hut prepare -day meal old quarter take interpret case make meaning clear bound say understand rule consider limit foreign vocabulary

39,"It will be observed that the young lady appeared entirely to have forgotten the share which Sir Henry and myself had taken in her preservation from Twala's clutches. But that is the way of women! I remember my dear wife was just the same. Well, I retired from that little interview sad at heart. I did not like Miss Foulata's soft glances, for I knew the fatal amorous propensities of sailors in general, and of Good in particular.",observe young lady appear forget share take preservation clutch way woman remember dear wife same retire little interview sad heart like soft glance know fatal amorous propensity sailor general particular

41,"It was a few days after this last occurrence that Ignosi held his great ""indaba,"" or council, and was formally recognised as king by the ""indunas,"" or head men, of Kukuanaland. The spectacle was a most imposing one, including as it did a grand review of troops. On this day the remaining fragments of the Greys were formally paraded, and in the face of the army thanked for their splendid conduct in the battle. To each man the king made a large present of cattle, promoting them one and all to the rank of officers in the new corps of Greys which was in process of formation. An order was also promulgated throughout the length and breadth of Kukuanaland that, whilst we honoured the country by our presence, we three were to be greeted with the royal salute, and to be treated with the same ceremony and respect that was by custom accorded to the king. Also the power of life and death was publicly conferred upon us. Ignosi, too, in the presence of his people, reaffirmed the promises which he had made, to the effect that no man's blood should be shed without trial, and that witch-hunting should cease in the land.",few day last occurrence hold great council recognise king induna head man spectacle impose one include do grand review troops day remain fragment parade face army thank splendid conduct battle man king make large present cattle promote rank officer new corps process formation order promulgate length breadth honoure country presence greet royal salute treat same ceremony respect custom accord king power life death confer presence person reaffirm promise make effect man blood shed trial witch hunting cease land 
42,"When the ceremony was over we waited upon Ignosi, and informed him that we were now anxious to investigate the mystery of the mines to which Solomon's Road ran, asking him if he had discovered anything about them.",ceremony wait inform anxious investigate mystery mine run ask discover 
43,"""My friends,"" he answered, ""I have discovered this. It is there that the three great figures sit, who here are called the 'Silent Ones,' and to whom Twala would have offered the girl Foulata as a sacrifice. It is there, too, in a great cave deep in the mountain, that the kings of the land are buried; there ye shall find Twala's body, sitting with those who went before him. There, also, is a deep pit, which, at some time, long-dead men dug out, mayhap for the stones ye speak of, such as I have heard men in Natal tell of at Kimberley. There, too, in the Place of Death is a secret chamber, known to none but the king and Gagool. But Twala, who knew it, is dead, and I know it not, nor know I what is in it. Yet there is a legend in the land that once, many generations gone, a white man crossed the mountains, and was led by a woman to the secret chamber and shown the wealth hidden in it. But before he could take it she betrayed him, and he was driven by the king of that day back to the mountains, and since then no man has entered the place.""",friend answer discover great figure sit call silent offer girl sacrifice great cave mountain king land bury find body sit go deep pit time long dead man dig mayhap stone speak such hear man tell secret chamber know king know dead know know be legend land many generation gone white man cross mountain lead woman secret chamber show wealth hide take betray drive king day mountain man enter place
