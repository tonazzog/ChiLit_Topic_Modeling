1,CHAPTER 5. CROFTON PLAY.,play 
2,"Hugh found, in the morning, that there was no danger of his not hearing the bell.  Its clang clang startled him out of a sound sleep; and he was on his feet on the floor almost before his eyes were open.  The boys who were more used to the bell did not make quite so much haste.  They yawned a few times, and turned out more slowly; so that Hugh had the great tin wash basin to himself longer than the rest.  There was a basin to every three boys; and, early as Hugh began, his companions were impatient long before he had done.  At first, they waited, in curiosity to see what he was going to do after washing his face; when he went further, they began to quiz; but when they found that he actually thought of washing his feet, they hooted and groaned at him for a dirty brat.",find morning be danger hear bell clang clang startle sound sleep foot floor eye open boy use bell make much haste yawn few time turn have great tin wash basin rest be basin boy begin companion impatient do wait curiosity see go do wash face go begin quiz find think wash foot hoot groan dirty brat

4,Phil told him that was stuff and nonsense here.  There was no room and no time for such home-doings.  The boys all washed their heads and feet on Saturdays.  He would soon find that he might be glad to get his face and hands done in the mornings.,tell stuff nonsense be room time such home doing boy wash head foot find glad get face hand do morning 
5,"The other boys in the room were, or pretended to be, so disgusted with the very idea of washing feet in a basin, that they made Hugh rinse and rub out the tin basin several times before they would use it, and then there was a great bustle to get down-stairs at the second bell.  Hugh pulled his brother's arm, as Phil was brushing out of the room, and asked, in a whisper, whether there would be time to say his prayers.",other boy room pretend disgusted very idea wash foot basin make rinse rub tin basin several time use be great bustle get stair second bell pull brother arm brush room ask whisper be time say prayer

8,"Phil fidgeted, and others giggled, while Hugh tried to part his hair, as Susan had taught him.  He gave it up, and left it rough, thinking he would come up and do it when there was nobody there to laugh at him.",fidget other giggle try part hair teach give leave rough think come do be laugh 
9,"The school-room looked chilly and dull, as there was no sunshine in it till the afternoon; and still Mr Tooke was not there, as Hugh had hoped he would be.  Mrs Watson and the servants came in for prayers, which were well read by the usher; and then everybody went to business:-- everybody but Hugh and Holt, who had nothing to do.  Class after class came up for repetition; and this repetition seemed to the new boys an accomplishment they should never acquire.  They did not think that any practice would enable them to gabble, as everybody seemed able to gabble here.  Hugh had witnessed something of it before,--Phil having been wont to run off at home, ""Sal, Sol, Ren et Splen,"" to the end of the passage, for the admiration of his sisters, and so much to little Harry's amusement, that Susan, however busy she might be, came to listen, and then asked him to say it again, that cook might hear what he learned at school.  Hugh now thought that none of them gabbled quite so fast as Phil: but he soon found out, by a glance or two of Phil's to one side, that he was trying to astonish the new boys.  It is surprising how it lightened Hugh's heart to find that his brother did not quite despise, or feel ashamed of him, as he had begun to think: but that he even took pains to show off.  He was sorry too when the usher spoke sharply to Phil, and even rapped his head with the cane, asking him what he spluttered out his nonsense at that rate for.  Thus ended Phil's display; and Hugh felt as hot, and as ready to cry, as if it had happened to himself.",school room look chilly dull be sunshine afternoon hope servant come prayer read usher go business have do class class come repetition repetition seem new boy accomplishment acquire think practice enable gabble seem able gabble witness wont run home end passage admiration sister much little amusement busy come listen ask say cook hear learn school think gabble find glance side try astonish new boy surprising lighten heart find brother despise feel ashamed begin think take pain show sorry usher speak rapp head cane ask splutter nonsense rate end display feel hot ready cry happen 
10,"Perhaps the usher saw this; for when he called Hugh up, he was very kind.  He looked at the Latin grammar he had used with Miss Harold, and saw by the dogs'-ears exactly how far Hugh had gone in it, and asked him only what he could answer very well.  Hugh said three declensions, with only one mistake.  Then he was shown the part that he was to say to-morrow morning; and Hugh walked away, all the happier for having something to do, like everybody else.  He was so little afraid of the usher, that he went back to him to ask where he had better sit.",usher see call kind look latin grammar use see dogs'- ear go ask answer say declension mistake show part say morning walk happy have do else little afraid usher go ask sit 
11,"""Sit!  O!  I suppose you must have a desk, though you have nothing to put in it.  If there is a spare desk, you shall have it: if not, we will find a corner for you somewhere.""",sit suppose have desk have put be spare desk have find corner 
12,"Some of the boys whispered that Mrs Watson's footstool, under her apron, would do: but the usher overheard this, and observed that it took some people a good while to know a new boy; and that they might find that a little fellow might be as much of a man as a big one.  And the usher called the oldest boy in the school, and asked him to see if there was a desk for little Proctor.  There was: and Hugh put into it his two or three school-books, and his slate; and felt that he was now indeed a Crofton boy.  Then, the usher was kinder than he had expected; and he had still to see Mr Tooke, of whom he was not afraid at all.  So Hugh's spirits rose, and he liked the prospect of breakfast as well as any boy in the school.",boy whisper footstool apron do usher overhear observe take person good while know new boy find little fellow much man big one usher call old boy school ask see be desk little be put school book slate feel boy usher kind expect have see afraid spirit rise like prospect breakfast boy school 
13,"There was one more rebuff for him, first, however.  He ran up to his room, to finish combing his hair, while the other boys were thronging into the long room to breakfast.  He found the housemaids there, making the beds; and they both cried ""Out!  Out!"" and clapped their hands at him, and threatened to tell Mrs Watson of his having broken rules, if he did not go this moment Hugh asked what Mrs Watson would say to his hair, if he went to breakfast with it as it was.  One of the maids was good-natured enough to comb it for him, for once: but she said he must carry a comb in his pocket; as the boys were not allowed to go to their rooms, except at stated hours.",be more rebuff run room finish comb hair other boy throng long room breakfast find housemaid make bed cry clapp hand threaten tell have break rule go moment ask say hair go breakfast maid good natured comb say carry comb pocket boy allow go room state hour 
14,"At last, Hugh saw Mr Tooke.  When the boys entered school at nine o'clock, the master was at his desk.  Hugh went up to his end of the room, with a smiling face, while Tom Holt hung back; and he kept beckoning Tom Holt on, having told him there was nothing to be afraid of.  But when, at last, Mr Tooke saw him, he made no difference between the two, and seemed to forget having ever seen Hugh.  He told them he hoped they would be good boys, and would do credit to Crofton; and then he asked Mr Carnaby to set them something to learn.  And this was all they had to do with Mr Tooke for a long while.",last see boy enter school o'clock master desk go end room smile face hang keep beckon tell be afraid last see make difference seem forget see tell hope good boy do credit ask set learn have do long while 
15,"This morning in school, from nine till twelve, seemed the longest morning these little boys had ever known.  When they remembered that the afternoon would be as long, and every morning and afternoon for three months, their hearts sank.  Perhaps, if any one had told them that the time would grow shorter and shorter by use, and at last, when they had plenty to do, almost too short, they would not have believed it, because they could not yet feel it.  But what they now found was only what every boy and girl finds, on beginning school, or entering upon any new way of life.",morning school seem long morning little boy know remember afternoon long morning afternoon month heart sink one tell time grow short short use last have plenty do short believe feel find boy girl find begin school enter new way life 
16,"Mr Carnaby, who was busy with others, found it rather difficult to fill up their time.  When Hugh had said some Latin, and helped his companion to learn his first Latin lesson, and both had written a copy, and done a sum, Mr Carnaby could not spare them any more time or thought, and told them they might do what they liked, if they only kept quiet, till school was up.  So they made out the ridiculous figures which somebody had carved upon their desks, and the verses, half rubbed out, which were scribbled inside: and then they reckoned, on their slates, how many days there were before the Christmas holidays;--how many school-days, and how many Sundays.  And then Hugh began to draw a steamboat in the Thames, as seen from the leads of his father's house; while Holt drew on his slate the ship in which he came over from India.  But before they had done, the clock struck twelve, school was up, and there was a general rush into the playground.",busy other find difficult fill time say help companion learn first latin lesson write copy do sum spare more time think tell do like keep quiet school make ridiculous figure carve desk verse half rub scribble reckon slate many day be holiday many school day many begin draw steamboat see lead father house draw slate ship come do clock strike school be general rush playground 
17,"Now Hugh was really to see the country.  Except that the sun had shone pleasantly into his room in the morning, through waving trees, nothing had yet occurred to make him feel that he was in the country.  Now, however, he was in the open air, with trees sprinkled all over the landscape, and green fields stretching away, and the old church tower half-covered with ivy.  Hugh screamed with pleasure; and nobody thought it odd, for almost every boy was shouting.  Hugh longed to pick up some of the shining brown chestnuts which he had seen yesterday in the road, under the trees; and he was now cantering away to the spot, when Phil ran after him, and roughly stopped him, saying he would get into a fine scrape for the first day, if he went out of bounds.",see country sun shine room morning wave tree occur make feel country open air tree sprinkle landscape green field stretch old church tower half cover ivy scream pleasure think odd boy shouting long pick shine brown chestnut see yesterday road tree canter spot run stop say get fine scrape first day go bound 
18,"Hugh had forgotten there were such things as bounds, and was not at all glad to be reminded of them now.  He sighed as he begged Phil to show him exactly where he might go and where he might not Phil did so in an impatient way, and then was off to trap-ball, because his party were waiting for him.",forget be such thing bound glad remind sigh begg show go do impatient way trap ball party wait 
19,"The chestnut-trees overhung one corner of the playground, within the paling: and in that corner Hugh found several chestnuts which had burst their sheaths, and lay among the first fallen leaves.  He pocketed them with great delight, wondering that nobody had been before him to secure such a treasure.  Agnes should have some; and little Harry would find them nice playthings.  They looked good to eat too; and he thought he could spare one to taste; so he took out his knife, cut off the point of a fine swelling chestnut, and tasted a bit of the inside.  Just as he was making a face over it, and wondering that it was so nasty, when those which his father roasted in the fire-shovel on Christmas-day were so good, he heard laughter behind him, and found that he was again doing something ridiculous, though he knew not what: and in a moment poor Hugh was as unhappy as ever.",chestnut tree overh corner playground paling corner find several chestnut burst sheath lay first fall leave pocket great delight wonder secure treasure have little find nice plaything look good eat think spare taste take knife cut point fine swell chestnut taste bit inside make face wonder nasty father roast fire shovel day good hear laughter find do ridiculous know moment poor unhappy 
20,"He ran away from the laughing boys, and went quite to the opposite corner of the playground, where a good number of his schoolfellows were playing ball under the orchard-wall.  Hugh ran hither and thither, like the rest, trying to catch the ball; but he never could do it; and he was jostled, and thrown down, and another boy fell over him; and he was told that he knew nothing about play, and had better move off.",run laugh boy go opposite corner playground good number schoolfellow play ball orchard wall run rest try catch ball do jostle throw boy fall tell know play move 
21,"He did so, with a heavy heart, wondering how he was ever to be like the other boys, if nobody would take him in hand, and teach him to play, or even let him learn.  Remembering what his mother expected of him, he tried to sing, to prevent crying, and began to count the pales round the playground, for something to do.  This presently brought him to a tree which stood on the very boundary, its trunk serving instead of two or three pales.  It was only a twisted old apple-tree; but the more twisted and gnarled it was, the more it looked like a tree that Hugh could climb; and he had always longed to climb a tree.  Glancing up, he saw a boy already there, sitting on the fork of two branches, reading.",heavy heart wonder other boy take hand teach play let learn remember mother expect try sing prevent cry begin count pale playground do bring tree stand very boundary trunk serving pale twisted old apple tree twisted gnarled more look tree climb long climb tree glance see boy sit fork branch read

28,"""Not you: but I'll come down, and so send you up to my seat, which is the safest to begin with.  Stand off.""",come send seat safe begin stand 
29,"Firth swung himself down, and then, showing Hugh where to plant his feet, and propping him when he wanted it, he soon seated him on the fork, and laughed good-naturedly when Hugh waved his cap over his head, on occasion of being up in a tree.  He let him get down and up again several times, till he could do it quite alone, and felt that he might have a seat here whenever it was not occupied by any one else.",swing show plant foot prop want seat fork laugh good wave cap head occasion tree let get several time do alone feel have seat occupy one else 
30,"While Hugh sat in the branches, venturing to leave hold with one hand, that he might fan his hot face with his cap, Firth stood on the rail of the palings, holding by the tree, and talking to him.  Firth told him that this was the only tree the boys were allowed to climb, since Ned Reeve had fallen from the great ash, and hurt his spine.  He showed what trees he had himself climbed before that accident; and it made Hugh giddy to think of being within eight feet of the top of the lofty elm in the churchyard, which Firth had thought nothing of mounting.",sit branch venture leave hold hand fan hot face cap stand rail paling hold tree talk tell only tree boy allow climb fall great ash hurt spine show tree have climb accident make giddy think foot top lofty elm churchyard think mount

Firth advised him to write a letter home before he began to expect one.  If he did not like to ask the usher, he himself would rule the paper for him, and he could write a bit at a time, after his lessons were done in the evening, till the sheet was full.",dear cry think suspense disappointment last boy gratified advise write letter begin expect like ask usher rule paper write bit time lesson do evening sheet full 
80,"Hugh then told his grievance about the usher, and Firth thought that though it was not wise in Hugh to prate about Crofton on the top of the coach, it was worse to sit by and listen without warning, unless the listener meant to hold his own tongue.  But he fancied the usher had since heard something which made him sorry; and the best way now was for Hugh to bear no malice, and remember nothing more of the affair than to be discreet in his future journeys.",tell grievance usher think wise prate top coach bad sit listen warning listener mean hold own tongue fancy usher hear make sorry good way bear malice remember more affair discreet future journey

87,"Hugh thought Firth was rather cool about the matter.  But Firth was not so cool when the throng opened for a moment, and showed what was really done to the angry boy.  Only his head appeared above ground.  His schoolfellows had put him into a hole they had dug, and had filled it up to his chin, stamping down the earth, so that the boy was perfectly helpless, while wild with rage.",think cool matter cool throng open moment show do angry boy head appear ground schoolfellow put hole dig fill chin stamp earth boy helpless wild rage

89,"And he jumped down from the paling and ran towards the crowd.  Hugh, forgetting his height from the ground, stood up in the tree, almost as angry as Lamb himself, and staring with all his might to see what he could.  He saw Firth making his way through the crowd, evidently remonstrating, if not threatening.  He saw him snatch a spade from a boy who was flourishing it in Lamb's face.  He saw that Firth was digging, though half-a-dozen boys had thrown themselves on his back, and hung on his arms.  He saw that Firth persevered till Lamb had got his right arm out of the ground, and was striking everywhere within reach.  Then he saw Firth dragged down and away, while the boys made a circle round Lamb, putting a foot or hand within his reach, and then snatching it away again, till the boy yelled with rage at the mockery.",jump paling run crowd forget height ground stand tree angry stare see see make way crowd remonstrate threaten see snatch spade boy flourish face see digg half boy throw back hang arm see persever get right arm ground strike reach see drag boy make circle put foot hand reach snatch boy yell rage mockery 
90,"Hugh could look on no longer.  He scrambled down from the tree, scampered to the spot, burst through the throng, and seized Lamb's hand. Lamb struck him a heavy blow, taking him for an enemy; but Hugh cried ""I am your friend,"" seized his hand again, and tugged till he was first red and then black in the face, and till Lamb had worked his shoulders out of the hole, and seemed likely to have the use of his other arm in a trice.",look scramble tree scamper spot burst throng seize hand strike heavy blow take enemy cry friend seize hand tug first red black face work shoulder hole seem likely have use other arm trice 
91,"Lamb's tormentors at first let Hugh alone in amazement; but they were not long in growing angry with him too.  They hustled him--they pulled him all ways--they tripped him up; but Hugh's spirit was roused, and that brought his body up to the struggle again and again.  He wrenched himself free, he scrambled to his feet again, as often as he was thrown down; and in a few minutes he had plenty of support.  Phil was taking his part, and shielding him from many blows.  Firth had got Lamb out of the hole, and the party against the tormentors was now so strong that they began to part off till the struggle ceased.  Firth kept his grasp of the spade; for Lamb's passion still ran so high that there was no saying what might be the consequences of leaving any dangerous weapon within his reach.  He was still fuming and stamping, Hugh gazing at him the while in wonder and fear.",tormentor first let amazement long grow angry hustle pull way trip spirit rouse bring body struggle wrench free scramble foot throw few minute have plenty support take part shield many blow get hole party tormentor strong begin part struggle cease keep grasp spade passion run high be say consequence leave dangerous weapon reach fume stamp gaze while wonder fear

93,"Lamb did help to fill the hole, but he did not say a word--not one word to anybody till the dinner-bell rang.  Then, at the pump, where the party were washing their hot and dirty and bruised hands, he held out his hand to Hugh, muttering, with no very good grace--",help fill hole say word word dinner bell ring pump party wash hot dirty bruise hand hold hand mutter good grace

He always tried at home to keep the little boys and girls off ""drunk old Tom,"" as he was called in the neighbourhood. It was such a shame to make anybody worse!  Lamb looked as if he was going to fly at Hugh now: but Firth put his arm round Hugh's neck, and drew him into the house, saying in his ear--",reply come help bear see worse_ try home keep little boy girl drunk old call neighbourhood shame make bad look go fly put arm neck draw house say ear
