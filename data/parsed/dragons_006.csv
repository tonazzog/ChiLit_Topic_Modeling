1,CHAPTER VI. The Dragon Tamers,
2," There was once an old, old castle--it was so old that its walls and towers and turrets and gateways and arches had crumbled to ruins, and of all its old splendor there were only two little rooms left; and it was here that John the blacksmith had set up his forge. He was too poor to live in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for the rooms in the ruin, because all the lords of the castle were dead and gone this many a year. So there John blew his bellows and hammered his iron and did all the work which came his way. This was not much, because most of the trade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a blacksmith in quite a large way of business, and had his huge forge facing the square of the town, and had twelve apprentices, all hammering like a nest of woodpeckers, and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about, and a patent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric bellows, and all things handsome about him. So of course the townspeople, whenever they wanted a horse shod or a shaft mended, went to the mayor. John the blacksmith struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from travelers and strangers who did not know what a superior forge the mayor's was. The two rooms were warm and weather-tight, but not very large; so the blacksmith got into the way of keeping his old iron, his odds and ends, his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great dungeon down under the castle. It was a very fine dungeon indeed, with a handsome vaulted roof and big iron rings whose staples were built into the wall, very strong and convenient for tying captives to, and at one end was a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew where. Even the lords of the castle in the good old times had never known where those steps led to, but every now and then they would kick a prisoner down the steps in their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the prisoners never came back. The blacksmith had never dared to go beyond the seventh step, and no more have I--so I know no more than he did what was at the bottom of those stairs.",be old old castle old wall tower turret gateway arche crumble ruin old splendor be little room leave blacksmith set forge poor live proper house ask rent room ruin lord castle dead go many year blow bellow hammer iron do work come way much most trade go mayor town blacksmith large way business have huge forge face square town have apprentice hammer nest woodpecker journeymen order apprentice patent forge self acting hammer electric bellow thing handsome course townspeople want horse shod shaft mend go mayor blacksmith struggle good few odd job traveler stranger know superior forge mayor room warm weather tight large blacksmith get way keep old iron odd end fagot twopence worth coal great dungeon castle fine dungeon handsome vault roof big iron ring staple build wall strong convenient tie captive end break flight wide step lead know lord castle good old time know step lead kick prisoner step lighthearted hopeful way prisoner come blacksmith dare go seventh step more know more do bottom stair 
3,"John the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. When his wife was not doing the housework she used to nurse the baby and cry, remembering the happy days when she lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and lived quite in the country, and when John used to come courting her in the summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a posy in his buttonhole. And now John's hair was getting gray, and there was hardly ever enough to eat.",blacksmith have wife little baby wife do housework use nurse baby cry remember happy day live father keep cow live country use come court summer evening smart smart posy buttonhole hair get gray be enough eat 
4,"As for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at night, when its mother had settled down to sleep, it would always begin to cry, quite as a matter of course, so that she hardly got any rest at all. This made her very tired.",baby cry good deal odd time night mother settle sleep begin cry matter course get rest make tired 
5,"The baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked, but the poor mother couldn't. So whenever she had nothing to do she used to sit and cry, because she was tired out with work and worry.",baby make bad night day like poor mother have do use sit cry tired work worry 
6,"One evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. He was making a goat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady, who wished to see how the goat liked being shod, and also whether the shoe would come to fivepence or sevenpence before she ordered the whole set. This was the only order John had had that week. And as he worked his wife sat and nursed the baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying.",evening blacksmith busy forge make goat shoe goat rich lady wish see goat like shod shoe come fivepence sevenpence order whole set only order have week work wife sit nurse baby wonder cry 
7,"Presently, over the noise of the bellows and over the clank of the iron, there came another sound. The blacksmith and his wife looked at each other.",noise bellow clank iron come sound blacksmith wife look other 
8,"""I heard nothing,"" said he.",hear say 
9,"""Neither did I,"" said she.",say 
10,"But the noise grew louder--and the two were so anxious not to hear it that he hammered away at the goat-shoe harder than he had ever hammered in his life, and she began to sing to the baby--a thing she had not had the heart to do for weeks.",noise grow louder anxious hear hammer goat shoe hard hammer life begin sing baby thing have heart do week 
11,"But through the blowing and hammering and singing the noise came louder and louder, and the more they tried not to hear it, the more they had to. It was like the noise of some great creature purring, purring, purring--and the reason they did not want to believe they really heard it was that it came from the great dungeon down below, where the old iron was, and the firewood and the twopence worth of coal, and the broken steps that went down into the dark and ended no one knew where.",blowing hammering sing noise come louder louder more try hear more have noise great creature purr purr purr reason want believe hear come great dungeon old iron firewood twopence worth coal break step go dark end know

13,"""There isn't anything there, of course. How could there be?"" said his wife. And they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing there that presently they very nearly did believe it.",be course be say wife try hard believe be believe 
14,"Then the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and his riveting hammer in the other, and hung the old stable lantern on his little finger, and went down to get the coals.",blacksmith take shovel hand rivet hammer other hang old stable lantern little finger go get coal 
15,"""I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there,"" said he, ""but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal.""",take hammer think be say handy break large lump coal 
16,"""I quite understand,"" said his wife, who had brought the coal home in her apron that very afternoon, and knew that it was all coal dust.",understand say wife bring coal home apron very afternoon know coal dust 
17,"So he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and stood at the bottom of the steps, holding the lantern above his head just to see that the dungeon really was empty, as usual. Half of it was empty as usual, except for the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the coals. But the other side was not empty. It was quite full, and what it was full of was Dragon.",go wind stair dungeon stand bottom step hold lantern head see dungeon empty usual half empty usual old iron odd end firewood coal other side empty full full

19,"But the dragon was too quick for him--it put out a great claw and caught him by the leg, and as it moved it rattled like a great bunch of keys, or like the sheet iron they make thunder out of in pantomimes.",dragon quick put great claw catch leg move rattle great bunch key sheet iron make thunder pantomime 
20,"""No you don't,"" said the dragon in a spluttering voice, like a damp squib.",say dragon splutter voice damp squib

22,The dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.,dragon seem strike remark 
23,"""Do you mind saying that again?"" said he, quite politely.",mind say say

26,"""So I understood you to say before,"" said John, his teeth chattering.",understand say say tooth chatter

30,"John timidly went around when the dragon took his claw away; and sure enough, the dragon's wing was hanging loose, and several of the plates near the joint certainly wanted riveting.",go dragon take claw dragon wing hang several plate joint want rivet 
31,"The dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron armor--a sort of tawny, red-rust color it was; from damp, no doubt--and under it he seemed to be covered with something furry.",dragon seem make iron armor sort tawny red rust color damp doubt seem cover furry 
32,"All the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt more at ease.",blacksmith well heart feel ease 
33,"""You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"" said he. ""In fact, you want a good many.""",do rivet sir say fact want good many

39,"""I don't like the job, sir,"" said John, ""and that's the truth. I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last'--and then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets--and then it's fire and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case.""",like job sir say truth know accident happen fair smooth rivet eat last get work give gentleman bit nip dig rivet fire smoke apology meet case 
40,"""Upon my word of honor as a dragon,"" said the other.",word honor dragon say other 
41,"""I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,"" said John, ""but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?""",know do purpose sir say gentleman give jump sniff nip sniff enough let fast 
42,"""It would be so undignified,"" objected the dragon.",undignified object dragon 
43,"""We always fasten a horse up,"" said John, ""and he's the 'noble animal.'""",fast horse say noble animal 
44,"""It's all very well,"" said the dragon, ""but how do I know you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you value most?""",say dragon know untie rivet give pledge value most 
45,"""My hammer,"" said John. ""A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer.""",hammer say blacksmith hammer 
46,"""But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first.""",want rivet think else eat 
47,"At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night, and that it was time to begin.",moment baby room begin scream mother quiet think settle night time begin 
48,"""Whatever's that?"" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his body rattled.",say dragon start plate body rattle

52,"""Then bring it here,"" said the dragon, ""and I'll take care of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up.""",bring say dragon take care do rivet tie 
53,"""All right, sir,"" said John, ""but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch--but don't you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking gentleman like you.""",right sir say warn baby poison dragon deceive right touch go put mouth like see harm come nice look gentleman 
54,"The dragon purred at this compliment and said: ""All right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is.""",dragon purr compliment say right careful go fetch thing 
55,"So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's front paws.",run step know dragon get impatient fasten heave roof dungeon heave back kill ruin wife asleep spite baby cry pick baby take put dragon front paw 
56,"""You just purr to it, sir,"" he said, ""and it'll be as good as gold.""",purr sir say good gold 
57,"So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it stopped crying.",dragon purr purring pleased baby much stop cry 
58,"Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let alone a dragon.",rummage heap old iron find heavy chain great collar make day man sing work put heart thing make strong bear weight year let alone dragon 
59,"John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed.",fasten dragon collar chain padlock set work find many rivet need 
60,"""Six, eight, ten--twenty, forty,"" said he. ""I haven't half enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute.""",say have half enough rivet shop excuse sir step forge get few minute 
61,"[""The dragon's purring pleased the baby."" _See page 106._]",dragon purring pleased baby see page

63,"John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and corporation.",run town find mayor corporation 
64,"""There's a dragon in my dungeon,"" he said; ""I've chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby away.""",be dragon dungeon say chain come help get baby

67,"""But what about my baby?"" said John.",baby say 
68,"""Oh, well,"" said the mayor, ""if anything should happen, you will always be able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause.""",say mayor happen able remember baby perish good cause 
69,"So John went home again, and told his wife some of the tale.",go tell wife tale 
70,"""You've given the baby to the dragon!"" she cried. ""Oh, you unnatural parent!""",give baby dragon cry unnatural parent 
71,"""Hush,"" said John, and he told her some more. ""Now,"" he said, ""I'm going down. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy will be all right.""",say tell more say go go keep head boy right 
72,"So down went the blacksmith, and there was the dragon purring away with all his might to keep the baby quiet.",go blacksmith be dragon purr keep baby quiet 
73,"""Hurry up, can't you?"" he said. ""I can't keep up this noise all night.""",hurry say keep noise night 
74,"""I'm very sorry, sir,"" said the blacksmith, ""but all the shops are shut. The job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to take care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid. Good night, sir.""",sorry sir say blacksmith shop shut job wait morning forget promise take care baby find little wear afraid good night sir 
75,"The dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath--so now he stopped, and as soon as everything was quiet the baby thought everyone must have settled for the night, and that it was time to begin to scream. So it began.",dragon purr breath stop quiet baby think settle night time begin scream begin 
76,"""Oh, dear,"" said the dragon, ""this is awful."" He patted the baby with his claw, but it screamed more than ever.",dear say dragon awful patt baby claw scream more 
77,"""And I am so tired too,"" said the dragon. ""I did so hope I should have a good night.""",tired say dragon hope have good night 
78,The baby went on screaming.,baby go scream 
79,"""There'll be no peace for me after this,"" said the dragon. ""It's enough to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then--did 'ums, then."" And he tried to quiet the baby as if it had been a young dragon. But when he began to sing ""Hush-a-by, Dragon,"" the baby screamed more and more and more. ""I can't keep it quiet,"" said the dragon; and then suddenly he saw a woman sitting on the steps. ""Here, I say,"" said he, ""do you know anything about babies?""",be peace say dragon enough ruin nerve try quiet baby young dragon begin sing baby scream more more more keep quiet say dragon see woman sit step say say know baby 
80,"""I do, a little,"" said the mother.",little say mother 
81,"""Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep,"" said the dragon, yawning. ""You can bring it back in the morning before the blacksmith comes.""",wish take one let get sleep say dragon yawn bring morning blacksmith come 
82,"So the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her husband, and they went to bed happy, for they had caught the dragon and saved the baby.",mother pick baby take tell husband go bed happy catch dragon save baby 
83,"And next day John went down and explained carefully to the dragon exactly how matters stood, and he got an iron gate with a grating to it and set it up at the foot of the steps, and the dragon mewed furiously for days and days, but when he found it was no good he was quiet.",next day go explain dragon matter stand get iron gate grating set foot step dragon mew day day find good quiet 
84,"So now John went to the mayor, and said: ""I've got the dragon and I've saved the town.""",go mayor say get dragon save town 
85,"""Noble preserver,"" cried the mayor, ""we will get up a subscription for you, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath.""",noble preserver cry mayor get subscription crown public laurel wreath 
86,"So the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and the corporation each gave three, and other people gave their guineas and half guineas and half crowns and crowns, and while the subscription was being made the mayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the town poet to celebrate the occasion. The poems were very much more admired, especially by the mayor and corporation.",mayor put name pound corporation give other person give guinea half guinea half crown crown subscription make mayor order poem own expense town poet celebrate occasion poem admire mayor corporation 
87,"The first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the mayor in arranging to have the dragon tied up. The second described the splendid assistance rendered by the corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy of the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside which the actions of St. George must appear quite commonplace to all with a feeling heart or a well-balanced brain.",first poem deal noble conduct mayor arrange have dragon tie second describe splendid assistance render corporation third express pride joy poet permit sing such deed action appear commonplace feeling heart balance brain 
88,"When the subscription was finished there was a thousand pounds, and a committee was formed to settle what should be done with it. A third of it went to pay for a banquet to the mayor and corporation; another third was spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the mayor and gold medals with dragons on them for the corporation; and what was left went in committee expenses.",subscription finish be pound committee form settle do third go pay banquet mayor corporation third spend buy gold collar dragon mayor gold medal dragon corporation leave go committee expense 
89,"So there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel wreath and the knowledge that it really was he who had saved the town. But after this things went a little better with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby did not cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who owned the goat was so touched by John's noble action that she ordered a complete set of shoes at 2 shillings, 4 pence, and even made it up to 2 shillings, 6 pence, in grateful recognition of his public-spirited conduct. Then tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off, and pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep through the iron grating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon--and it was threepence extra for each party if the blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by, which, as the fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear profit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide teas at ninepence a head, and altogether things grew brighter week by week.",be blacksmith laurel wreath knowledge save town thing go little good blacksmith begin baby cry have rich lady own goat touch noble action order complete set shoe shilling pence make shilling pence grateful recognition public spirit conduct tourist use come break long way pay twopence go step peep iron grating rusty dragon dungeon extra party blacksmith let colored fire see fire short twopence halfpenny clear profit time blacksmith wife use provide tea ninepence head thing grow bright week week 
90,"The baby--named John, after his father, and called Johnnie for short--began presently to grow up. He was great friends with Tina, the daughter of the whitesmith, who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear little girl with yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of hearing the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been minded by a real dragon.",baby name father call short begin grow great friend daughter whitesmith live opposite dear little girl yellow pigtail blue eye tired hear story baby minded real dragon

And they would light a halfpenny's worth of colored fire to look at him by. And they grew older and wiser.",child use go peep iron grating dragon hear meew light halfpenny worth color fire look grow old wise 
92,"At last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the hare in their gold gowns, came screaming back to the town gates with the news that a lame, humpy giant, as big as a tin church, was coming over the marshes toward the town.",last day mayor corporation hunt hare gold gown come scream town gate news lame humpy giant big tin church come marsh town

94,"No one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and Tina were listening, and they looked at each other, and ran off as fast as their boots would carry them.",seem know do listen look other run boot carry 
95,"They ran through the forge, and down the dungeon steps, and knocked at the iron door. ""Who's there?"" said the dragon. ""It's only us,"" said the children.",run forge dungeon step knock iron door say dragon say child 
96,"And the dragon was so dull from having been alone for ten years that he said: ""Come in, dears.""",dragon dull alone year say come dear 
97,"""You won't hurt us, or breathe fire at us or anything?"" asked Tina.",hurt breathe fire ask 
98,"And the dragon said, ""Not for worlds.""",dragon say world

105,"So the children loosed the dragon from the chains and the collar, and he broke down one end of the dungeon and went out--only pausing at the forge door to get the blacksmith to rivet his wing.",child loose dragon chain collar break end dungeon go pause forge door get blacksmith rivet wing 
106,"He met the lame giant at the gate of the town, and the giant banged on the dragon with his club as if he were banging an iron foundry, and the dragon behaved like a smelting works--all fire and smoke.

107,"At last the dragon won, and the giant sneaked away across the marshes, and the dragon, who was very tired, went home to sleep, announcing his intention of eating the town in the morning. He went back into his old dungeon because he was a stranger in the town, and he did not know of any other respectable lodging. Then Tina and Johnnie went to the mayor and corporation and said, ""The giant is settled. Please give us the thousand pounds reward.""",last dragon win giant sneak marsh dragon tired go sleep announce intention eat town morning go old dungeon stranger town know other respectable lodging go mayor corporation say giant settle give pound reward

For they had been dissatisfied with the mayor for some time, and thought they would like a change.",person listen door interrupt say fast dragon turn mayor let mayor place dissatisfied mayor time think like change

132,"""No, nine times,"" said Johnnie. ""He's bigger than the steeple.""",time say big steeple 
133,"""Oh, dear,"" said the dragon. ""I never expected this.""",dear say dragon expect 
134,"""And the mayor has told him where you are,"" Tina went on, ""and he is coming to eat you as soon as he has sharpened his big knife. The mayor told him you were a wild dragon--but he didn't mind. He said he only ate wild dragons--with bread sauce.""",mayor tell go come eat sharpen big knife mayor tell wild dragon mind say eat wild dragon bread sauce 
135,"""That's tiresome,"" said the dragon. ""And I suppose this sloppy stuff in the tub is the bread sauce?""",tiresome say dragon suppose sloppy stuff tub bread sauce 
136,"The children said it was. ""Of course,"" they added, ""bread sauce is only served with wild dragons. Tame ones are served with apple sauce and onion stuffing. What a pity you're not a tame one: He'd never look at you then,"" they said. ""Good-bye, poor dragon, we shall never see you again, and now you'll know what it's like to be eaten."" And they began to cry again.",child say course add bread sauce serve wild dragon tame one serve apple sauce onion stuff pity tame one look say good poor dragon see know eat begin cry 
137,"""Well, but look here,"" said the dragon, ""couldn't you pretend I was a tame dragon? Tell the giant that I'm just a poor little timid tame dragon that you kept for a pet.""",look say dragon pretend tame dragon tell giant poor little timid tame dragon keep pet 
138,"""He'd never believe it,"" said Johnnie. ""If you were our tame dragon we should keep you tied up, you know. We shouldn't like to risk losing such a dear, pretty pet.""",believe say tame dragon keep tie know like risk lose dear pretty pet 
139,"Then the dragon begged them to fasten him up at once, and they did so: with the collar and chains that were made years ago--in the days when men sang over their work and made it strong enough to bear any strain.",dragon begg fast collar chain make year day man sing work make strong bear strain 
140,"And then they went away and told the people what they had done, and Johnnie was made mayor, and had a glorious feast exactly as he had said he would--with nothing in it but sweet things. It began with Turkish delight and halfpenny buns, and went on with oranges, toffee, coconut ice, peppermints, jam puffs, raspberry-noyeau, ice creams, and meringues, and ended with bull's-eyes and gingerbread and acid drops.",go tell person do make mayor have glorious feast say sweet thing begin turkish delight halfpenny bun go orange toffee coconut ice peppermint jam puff raspberry noyeau ice cream meringue end bull eye gingerbread acid drop 
141,"This was all very well for Johnnie and Tina; but if you are kind children with feeling hearts you will perhaps feel sorry for the poor deceived, deluded dragon--chained up in the dull dungeon, with nothing to do but to think over the shocking untruths that Johnnie had told him.",kind child feeling heart feel sorry poor deceive delude dragon chain dull dungeon do think shocking untruth tell 
142,"When he thought how he had been tricked, the poor captive dragon began to weep--and the large tears fell down over his rusty plates. And presently he began to feel faint, as people sometimes do when they have been crying, especially if they have not had anything to eat for ten years or so.",think trick poor captive dragon begin weep large tear fall rusty plate begin feel faint person do cry have eat year 
143,"And then the poor creature dried his eyes and looked about him, and there he saw the tub of bread and milk. So he thought, ""If giants like this damp, white stuff, perhaps I should like it too,"" and he tasted a little, and liked it so much that he ate it all up.",poor creature dry eye look see tub bread milk think giant like damp white stuff like taste little like much eat 
144,"And the next time the tourists came, and Johnnie let off the colored fire, the dragon said shyly: ""Excuse my troubling you, but could you bring me a little more bread and milk?""",next time tourist come let colored fire dragon say excuse trouble bring little more bread milk 
145,"So Johnnie arranged that people should go around with carts every day to collect the children's bread and milk for the dragon. The children were fed at the town's expense--on whatever they liked; and they ate nothing but cake and buns and sweet things, and they said the poor dragon was very welcome to their bread and milk.",arrange person go cart day collect child bread milk dragon child feed town expense like eat cake bun sweet thing say poor dragon welcome bread milk 
146,"Now, when Johnnie had been mayor ten years or so he married Tina, and on their wedding morning they went to see the dragon. He had grown quite tame, and his rusty plates had fallen off in places, and underneath he was soft and furry to stroke. So now they stroked him.",mayor year marry wedding morning go see dragon grow tame rusty plate fall place soft furry stroke stroke 
147,"And he said, ""I don't know how I could ever have liked eating anything but bread and milk. I _am_ a tame dragon now, aren't I?"" And when they said that yes, he was, the dragon said: ""I am so tame, won't you undo me?"" And some people would have been afraid to trust him, but Johnnie and Tina were so happy on their wedding day that they could not believe any harm of anyone in the world. So they loosened the chains, and the dragon said: ""Excuse me a moment, there are one or two little things I should like to fetch,"" and he moved off to those mysterious steps and went down them, out of sight into the darkness. And as he moved, more and more of his rusty plates fell off.",say know like eat bread milk tame dragon say dragon say tame undo person afraid trust happy wedding day believe harm world loosen chain dragon say excuse moment be little thing like fetch move mysterious step go sight darkness move more more rusty plate fall 
148,In a few minutes they heard him clanking up the steps. He brought something in his mouth--it was a bag of gold.,few minute hear clank step bring mouth bag gold 
149,"""It's no good to me,"" he said. ""Perhaps you might find it useful."" So they thanked him very kindly.",good say find useful thank 
150,"""More where that came from,"" said he, and fetched more and more and more, till they told him to stop. So now they were rich, and so were their fathers and mothers. Indeed, everyone was rich, and there were no more poor people in the town. And they all got rich without working, which is very wrong; but the dragon had never been to school, as you have, so he knew no better.",more come say fetched more more more tell stop rich father mother rich be more poor person town get rich work wrong dragon school have know good 
151,"And as the dragon came out of the dungeon, following Johnnie and Tina into the bright gold and blue of their wedding day, he blinked his eyes as a cat does in the sunshine, and he shook himself, and the last of his plates dropped off, and his wings with them, and he was just like a very, very extra-sized cat. And from that day he grew furrier and furrier, and he was the beginning of all cats. Nothing of the dragon remained except the claws, which all cats have still, as you can easily ascertain.",dragon come dungeon follow bright gold blue wedding day blink eye cat do sunshine shake last plate drop wing extra-sized cat day grow furrier furrier beginning cat dragon remain claw cat have ascertain 
152,"And I hope you see now how important it is to feed your cat with bread and milk. If you were to let it have nothing to eat but mice and birds it might grow larger and fiercer, and scalier and tailier, and get wings and turn into the beginning of dragons. And then there would be all the bother over again.",hope see important feed cat bread milk let have eat mouse bird grow large fiercer scaly taily get wing turn beginning dragon be bother
