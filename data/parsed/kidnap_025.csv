1,CHAPTER XXIV. THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE QUARREL,quarrel 
2,"Alan and I were put across Loch Errocht under cloud of night, and went down its eastern shore to another hiding-place near the head of Loch Rannoch, whither we were led by one of the gillies from the Cage. This fellow carried all our luggage and Alan’s great-coat in the bargain, trotting along under the burthen, far less than the half of which used to weigh me to the ground, like a stout hill pony with a feather; yet he was a man that, in plain contest, I could have broken on my knee.",put cloud night go eastern shore hiding place head lead gilly cage fellow carry luggage great coat bargain trot burthen less half use weigh ground stout hill pony feather man plain contest break knee 
3,"Doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered; and perhaps without that relief, and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness, I could not have walked at all. I was but new risen from a bed of sickness; and there was nothing in the state of our affairs to hearten me for much exertion; travelling, as we did, over the most dismal deserts in Scotland, under a cloudy heaven, and with divided hearts among the travellers.",great relief walk disencumber relief consequent sense liberty lightness walk rise bed sickness be state affair heart much exertion travel do dismal desert cloudy heaven divide heart traveller 
4,"For long, we said nothing; marching alongside or one behind the other, each with a set countenance: I, angry and proud, and drawing what strength I had from these two violent and sinful feelings; Alan angry and ashamed, ashamed that he had lost my money, angry that I should take it so ill.",say march other set countenance angry proud draw strength have violent sinful feeling angry ashamed ashamed lose money angry take ill 
5,"The thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind; and the more I approved of it, the more ashamed I grew of my approval. It would be a fine, handsome, generous thing, indeed, for Alan to turn round and say to me: “Go, I am in the most danger, and my company only increases yours.” But for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me, and say to him: “You are in great danger, I am in but little; your friendship is a burden; go, take your risks and bear your hardships alone----” no, that was impossible; and even to think of it privily to myself, made my cheeks to burn.",thought separation run strong mind more approve ashamed grow approval fine handsome generous thing turn say go most danger company increase turn friend love say great danger little friendship burden go take risk bear hardship impossible think make cheek burn 
6,"And yet Alan had behaved like a child, and (what is worse) a treacherous child. Wheedling my money from me while I lay half-conscious was scarce better than theft; and yet here he was trudging by my side, without a penny to his name, and by what I could see, quite blithe to sponge upon the money he had driven me to beg. True, I was ready to share it with him; but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness.",behave child bad treacherous child wheedle money lay half conscious scarce good theft trudg side penny name see blithe sponge money drive beg true ready share make rage see count readiness 
7,"These were the two things uppermost in my mind; and I could open my mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity. So I did the next worst, and said nothing, nor so much as looked once at my companion, save with the tail of my eye.",thing uppermost mind open mouth black ungenerosity do next bad say much look companion save tail eye

14,"“Never,” says he; “but ye ken very well that ye’ve done worse. Are we to part? Ye said so once before. Are ye to say it again? There’s hills and heather enough between here and the two seas, David; and I will own I’m no very keen to stay where I’m no wanted.”",say ke do bad part say say be hill heather sea own keen stay want

16,"“Alan Breck!” I cried; and then: “Do you think I am one to turn my back on you in your chief need? You dursn’t say it to my face. My whole conduct’s there to give the lie to it. It’s true, I fell asleep upon the muir; but that was from weariness, and you do wrong to cast it up to me----”",cry think turn back chief need say face whole conduct give lie true fall asleep muir weariness do wrong cast 
17,"“Which is what I never did,” said Alan.",do say 
18,"“But aside from that,” I continued, “what have I done that you should even me to dogs by such a supposition? I never yet failed a friend, and it’s not likely I’ll begin with you. There are things between us that I can never forget, even if you can.”",continue do dog supposition fail friend likely begin be thing forget 
19,"“I will only say this to ye, David,” said Alan, very quietly, “that I have long been owing ye my life, and now I owe ye money. Ye should try to make that burden light for me.”",say say ow life owe money try make burden light 
20,"This ought to have touched me, and in a manner it did, but the wrong manner. I felt I was behaving badly; and was now not only angry with Alan, but angry with myself in the bargain; and it made me the more cruel.",touch manner wrong manner feel behave angry angry bargain make cruel 
21,"“You asked me to speak,” said I. “Well, then, I will. You own yourself that you have done me a disservice; I have had to swallow an affront: I have never reproached you, I never named the thing till you did. And now you blame me,” cried I, “because I cannae laugh and sing as if I was glad to be affronted. The next thing will be that I’m to go down upon my knees and thank you for it! Ye should think more of others, Alan Breck. If ye thought more of others, ye would perhaps speak less about yourself; and when a friend that likes you very well has passed over an offence without a word, you would be blithe to let it lie, instead of making it a stick to break his back with. By your own way of it, it was you that was to blame; then it shouldnae be you to seek the quarrel.”",ask speak say own do disservice have swallow affront reproach name thing do blame cry laugh sing glad affront next thing go knee thank think more other think more other speak less friend like pass offence word blithe let lie make stick break back own way blame noe seek quarrel

23,"And we fell back into our former silence; and came to our journey’s end, and supped, and lay down to sleep, without another word.",fall former silence come journey end supp lay sleep word 
24,"The gillie put us across Loch Rannoch in the dusk of the next day, and gave us his opinion as to our best route. This was to get us up at once into the tops of the mountains: to go round by a circuit, turning the heads of Glen Lyon, Glen Lochay, and Glen Dochart, and come down upon the lowlands by Kippen and the upper waters of the Forth. Alan was little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his blood-foes, the Glenorchy Campbells. He objected that by turning to the east, we should come almost at once among the Athole Stewarts, a race of his own name and lineage, although following a different chief, and come besides by a far easier and swifter way to the place whither we were bound. But the gillie, who was indeed the chief man of Cluny’s scouts, had good reasons to give him on all hands, naming the force of troops in every district, and alleging finally (as well as I could understand) that we should nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the Campbells.",gillie put dusk next day give opinion good route get top mountain go circuit turn head come lowland upper water little pleased route lead country blood foe object turn east come race own name lineage follow different chief come easy swifter way place bind gillie chief man scout have good reason give hand name force troops district allege understand little troubled country 
25,"Alan gave way at last, but with only half a heart. “It’s one of the dowiest countries in Scotland,” said he. “There’s naething there that I ken, but heath, and crows, and Campbells. But I see that ye’re a man of some penetration; and be it as ye please!”",give way last heart dowiest country say be naething ke heath crow see man penetration 
26,"We set forth accordingly by this itinerary; and for the best part of three nights travelled on eerie mountains and among the well-heads of wild rivers; often buried in mist, almost continually blown and rained upon, and not once cheered by any glimpse of sunshine. By day, we lay and slept in the drenching heather; by night, incessantly clambered upon break-neck hills and among rude crags. We often wandered; we were often so involved in fog, that we must lie quiet till it lightened. A fire was never to be thought of. Our only food was drammach and a portion of cold meat that we had carried from the Cage; and as for drink, Heaven knows we had no want of water.",set itinerary good part night travel eerie mountain head wild river bury mist blow rain cheer glimpse sunshine day lay sleep drench heather night clamber break neck hill rude crag wander involve fog lie quiet lighten fire think only food drammach portion cold meat carry cage drink know have want water 
27,"This was a dreadful time, rendered the more dreadful by the gloom of the weather and the country. I was never warm; my teeth chattered in my head; I was troubled with a very sore throat, such as I had on the isle; I had a painful stitch in my side, which never left me; and when I slept in my wet bed, with the rain beating above and the mud oozing below me, it was to live over again in fancy the worst part of my adventures--to see the tower of Shaws lit by lightning, Ransome carried below on the men’s backs, Shuan dying on the round-house floor, or Colin Campbell grasping at the bosom of his coat. From such broken slumbers, I would be aroused in the gloaming, to sit up in the same puddle where I had slept, and sup cold drammach; the rain driving sharp in my face or running down my back in icy trickles; the mist enfolding us like as in a gloomy chamber--or, perhaps, if the wind blew, falling suddenly apart and showing us the gulf of some dark valley where the streams were crying aloud.",dreadful time render dreadful gloom weather country warm tooth chatter head trouble sore throat such have isle have painful stitch side leave sleep wet bed rain beat mud ooze live fancy bad part adventure see tower light lightning carry man back die round house floor grasp bosom coat such break slumber arouse gloaming sit same puddle sleep sup cold drammach rain drive sharp face run back icy trickle mist enfold gloomy chamber wind blow fall show gulf dark valley stream cry 
28,"The sound of an infinite number of rivers came up from all round. In this steady rain the springs of the mountain were broken up; every glen gushed water like a cistern; every stream was in high spate, and had filled and overflowed its channel. During our night tramps, it was solemn to hear the voice of them below in the valleys, now booming like thunder, now with an angry cry. I could well understand the story of the Water Kelpie, that demon of the streams, who is fabled to keep wailing and roaring at the ford until the coming of the doomed traveller. Alan I saw believed it, or half believed it; and when the cry of the river rose more than usually sharp, I was little surprised (though, of course, I would still be shocked) to see him cross himself in the manner of the Catholics.",sound infinite number river come steady rain spring mountain break glen gush water cistern stream high spate fill overflow channel night tramp solemn hear voice valley boom thunder angry cry understand story demon stream fabled keep wail roar ford coming doom traveller see believe half believe cry river rise more sharp little surprise course shocked see cross manner 
29,"During all these horrid wanderings we had no familiarity, scarcely even that of speech. The truth is that I was sickening for my grave, which is my best excuse. But besides that I was of an unforgiving disposition from my birth, slow to take offence, slower to forget it, and now incensed both against my companion and myself. For the best part of two days he was unweariedly kind; silent, indeed, but always ready to help, and always hoping (as I could very well see) that my displeasure would blow by. For the same length of time I stayed in myself, nursing my anger, roughly refusing his services, and passing him over with my eyes as if he had been a bush or a stone.",horrid wandering have familiarity speech truth sicken grave good excuse unforgiving disposition birth slow take offence slow forget incense companion good part day kind silent ready help hope see displeasure blow same length time stay nurse anger refuse service pass eye bush stone 
30,"The second night, or rather the peep of the third day, found us upon a very open hill, so that we could not follow our usual plan and lie down immediately to eat and sleep. Before we had reached a place of shelter, the grey had come pretty clear, for though it still rained, the clouds ran higher; and Alan, looking in my face, showed some marks of concern.",second night peep third day find open hill follow usual plan lie eat sleep reach place shelter grey come clear rain cloud run high look face show mark concern

33,"Alan flushed darkly. “I’ll not offer it again,” he said. “I’m not a patient man, David.”",flush offer say patient man 
34,"“I never said you were,” said I, which was exactly the rude, silly speech of a boy of ten.",say say rude silly speech boy 
35,"Alan made no answer at the time, but his conduct answered for him. Henceforth, it is to be thought, he quite forgave himself for the affair at Cluny’s; cocked his hat again, walked jauntily, whistled airs, and looked at me upon one side with a provoking smile.",make answer time conduct answer think forgive affair cocked hat walk whistle air look side provoking smile 
36,"The third night we were to pass through the western end of the country of Balquhidder. It came clear and cold, with a touch in the air like frost, and a northerly wind that blew the clouds away and made the stars bright. The streams were full, of course, and still made a great noise among the hills; but I observed that Alan thought no more upon the Kelpie, and was in high good spirits. As for me, the change of weather came too late; I had lain in the mire so long that (as the Bible has it) my very clothes “abhorred me.” I was dead weary, deadly sick and full of pains and shiverings; the chill of the wind went through me, and the sound of it confused my ears. In this poor state I had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a persecution. He spoke a good deal, and never without a taunt. “Whig” was the best name he had to give me. “Here,” he would say, “here’s a dub for ye to jump, my Whiggie! I ken you’re a fine jumper!” And so on; all the time with a gibing voice and face.",third night pass western end country come clear cold touch air frost northerly wind blow cloud make star bright stream full course make great noise hill observe think more high good spirit change weather come lain mire have very clothes abhorr dead weary deadly sick full pain shivering chill wind go sound confuse ear poor state have bear companion nature persecution speak good deal taunt good name have give say dub jump ke fine jumper time gibing voice face 
37,"I knew it was my own doing, and no one else’s; but I was too miserable to repent. I felt I could drag myself but little farther; pretty soon, I must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox, and my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast. My head was light perhaps; but I began to love the prospect, I began to glory in the thought of such a death, alone in the desert, with the wild eagles besieging my last moments. Alan would repent then, I thought; he would remember, when I was dead, how much he owed me, and the remembrance would be torture. So I went like a sick, silly, and bad-hearted schoolboy, feeding my anger against a fellow-man, when I would have been better on my knees, crying on God for mercy. And at each of Alan’s taunts, I hugged myself. “Ah!” thinks I to myself, “I have a better taunt in readiness; when I lie down and die, you will feel it like a buffet in your face; ah, what a revenge! ah, how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty!”",know own do else miserable repent feel drag little far lie die wet mountain sheep fox bone white bone beast head light begin love prospect begin glory thought death desert wild eagle besieg last moment repent think remember dead much owe remembrance torture go sick silly bad hearted schoolboy feed anger fellow man good knee cry mercy taunt hugge think have good taunt readiness lie die feel buffet face revenge regret ingratitude cruelty 
38,"All the while, I was growing worse and worse. Once I had fallen, my leg simply doubling under me, and this had struck Alan for the moment; but I was afoot so briskly, and set off again with such a natural manner, that he soon forgot the incident. Flushes of heat went over me, and then spasms of shuddering. The stitch in my side was hardly bearable. At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther: and with that, there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan, let my anger blaze, and be done with my life in a more sudden manner. He had just called me “Whig.” I stopped.",while grow bad bad fall leg double strike moment afoot set natural manner forget incident flushe heat go spasm shuddering stitch side bearable last begin feel trail come wish have let anger blaze do life sudden manner call stop 
39,"“Mr. Stewart,” said I, in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string, “you are older than I am, and should know your manners. Do you think it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth? I thought, where folk differed, it was the part of gentlemen to differ civilly; and if I did not, I may tell you I could find a better taunt than some of yours.”",say voice quiver fiddle string old know manners think wise witty cast politics tooth think folk differ part gentleman differ tell find good taunt 
40,"Alan had stopped opposite to me, his hat cocked, his hands in his breeches pockets, his head a little on one side. He listened, smiling evilly, as I could see by the starlight; and when I had done he began to whistle a Jacobite air. It was the air made in mockery of General Cope’s defeat at Preston Pans:",stop hat cocked hand breeche pocket head little side listen smile see starlight do begin whistle air air make mockery defeat

49,"“I am sorry for that,” said I, “for I am not done; and if you distaste the sermon, I doubt the pirliecue* will please you as little. You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy. Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you; you have run before them like a hare.

58,"“It’s the truth!” cried Alan, and he stood for a moment, wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity. “It’s the bare truth,”  he said, and drew his sword. But before I could touch his blade with mine, he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground. “Na, na,” he kept saying, “na, na--I cannae, I cannae.”",truth cry stand moment wring mouth hand man sore perplexity bare truth say draw sword touch blade throw fall ground keep say cannae cannae 
59,"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me; and I found myself only sick, and sorry, and blank, and wondering at myself. I would have given the world to take back what I had said; but a word once spoken, who can recapture it? I minded me of all Alan’s kindness and courage in the past, how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days; and then recalled my own insults, and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend. At the same time, the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble, and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness. I thought I must have swooned where I stood.",last anger ooze find sick sorry blank wonder give world take say word speak recapture minded kindness courage past help cheer borne evil day recall own insult see lose friend same time sickness hang seem redouble pang side sword sharpness think swoon stand 
60,"This it was that gave me a thought. No apology could blot out what I had said; it was needless to think of one, none could cover the offence; but where an apology was vain, a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side. I put my pride away from me. “Alan!” I said; “if ye cannae help me, I must just die here.”",give thought apology blot say needless think cover offence apology vain mere cry help bring side put pride say help die

O, let me get into the bield of a house--I’ll can die there easier.” I had no need to pretend; whether I chose or not, I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone.",true say let get bield house die easy have need pretend choose speak weep voice melt heart stone 
63,“Can ye walk?” asked Alan.,walk ask 
64,"“No,” said I, “not without help. This last hour my legs have been fainting under me; I’ve a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron; I cannae breathe right. If I die, ye’ll can forgive me, Alan?
