2,"The bleating of the kids woke them the next morning earlier than usual. The weather was again fine, and the sun shining brightly, and Ready turned out Nanny and her progeny.  They had an excellent breakfast of fried fish, and then Mr Seagrave, Ready, and William went out to their work: the two first took down the tents, and spread the canvas on the ground, that it might be well dried, while William went in pursuit of the fowls, which had not been seen for a day or two.  After half-an-hour's search in the cocoa-nut grove, he heard the cock crow, and soon afterwards found them all.  He threw them some split peas, which he had brought with him.  They were hungry enough and followed him home to the house, where he left them and went to join Ready and his father.",bleating kid wake next morning usual weather fine sun shine ready turn progeny have excellent breakfast fry fish ready go work take tent spread canvas ground dry go pursuit fowl see day half hour search cocoa nut grove hear cock crow find throw split pea bring hungry follow house leave go join ready father 
3,"""William,"" said Ready, ""I think, now that we have spread out the tents, we will, if Mr Seagrave approves, all set to at once and knock up a fowl-house; it won't be more than a day's job, and then the creatures will have a home.  There are four very thick cocoa-nut trees close to the house; we will build it under them; it will be a good job over."" Mr Seagrave assented, and they set immediately to work.  There were many thin poles left, the tops of the cocoa-nut trees which had been cut down to build the house; these they nailed to the trunks of the four trees, so as to make a square, and then they ran up rafters for a pitched roof.",say ready think spread tent approve set knock fowl house more day job creature have home be thick cocoa nut tree close house build good job assent set work be many thin pole leave top cocoa nut tree cut build house nail trunk tree make square run rafter pitch roof 
4,"""Now, sir, this is only rough work; we will first put up a perch or two for them, and then close in the side, and thatch the roof with cocoa-nut branches; but there's Juno taking in the dinner, so we'll finish it afterwards.""",sir rough work put perch close side thatch roof cocoa nut branch be take dinner finish 
5,"After their meal the work was renewed; Mr Seagrave collected the branches while William and Ready worked upon the sides and roof, and before the evening closed in, the fowl-house was complete.  William enticed the fowls down to it with some more split peas, and then walked away.",meal work renew collect branch work side roof evening close fowl house complete entice fowl more split pea walk 
6,"""Now, sir, the creatures will soon find their way in; and by and by, when I have time, I'll make a door to the entrance.""",sir creature find way have time make door entrance 
7,"""And now,"" said William, ""I think we had better roll up the canvas of the tents; we have had a splendid day, and may not be so fortunate to-morrow.""",say think have good roll canvas tent have splendid day fortunate 
8,"""Very true; we will get them housed, and stow them away under the bed-places; there is plenty of room.""  By the time that they had folded up the canvas, and William had brought in Nanny and the kids, the sun had set, and they went into the house.  Ready was requested to go on with his history, which he did as follows:--",true get house stow bed place be plenty room time fold canvas bring kid sun set go house ready request go history do follow 
9,"""I said last night that I determined to run away from school and go to sea, but I did not tell you how I managed it.  I had no chance of getting out of the school unperceived, except after the boys were all put to bed.  The room that I slept in was at the top of the house--the doors I knew were all locked; but there was a trap-door which led out on the roof, fastened by a bolt inside, and a ladder leading up to it; and I determined that I would make my escape by that way.  As soon as all the other boys were fast asleep, I arose and dressed myself very quietly, and then left the room.",say last night determine run school go sea tell manage have chance get school unperceived boy put bed room sleep top house door know lock be trap door lead roof fasten bolt ladder lead determine make escape way other boy fast asleep arise dress leave room 
10,"""The moon shone bright, which was lucky for me, and I gained the trap-door without any noise.  I had some difficulty in forcing it up, as it was heavy for a boy of my age; but I contrived to do so at last, and gained the roof of the house.  I then began looking about me, to see how I was to get to the ground, and after walking to and fro several times, I decided that I could slip down by a large water-pipe; it was so far detached from the bricks, that I could get my small fingers round it.  I climbed over the parapet, and, clinging to the pipe firmly with my hands and knees, I slid down, and arrived at the bottom in safety.""",moon shine bright lucky gain trap door noise have difficulty force heavy boy age contrive do last gain roof house begin look see get ground walk several time decide slip large water pipe detached brick get small finger climb parapet cling pipe hand knee slide arrive bottom safety 
11,"""It's a wonder you did not break your neck, Ready,"" observed Mrs Seagrave.",wonder break neck ready observe 
12,"""It was, indeed, ma'am.  As soon as I was landed in the flowerbed, which was below, I hastened to the iron gates at the entrance, and soon climbed up and got to the other side into the road.  I started as fast as I could towards the port, and when I arrived at the wharf, I perceived that a vessel had her topsails loose, and meant to take advantage of the ebb-tide which had just made; the men were singing `Yo heave yo,' getting the anchor up; and as I stood watching, almost making up my mind that I would swim off to her, I perceived that a man pushed off in her jolly-boat, and was sculling to a post a little higher up, where a hawser had been made fast; I ran round, and arrived there before he had cast off the rope; without saying a word, I jumped into the boat.",land flowerbed hasten iron gate entrance climb get other side road start port arrive wharf perceive vessel have topsail mean take advantage ebb tide make man sing heave get anchor stand watch make mind swim perceive man push jolly boat scull post little high hawser make run arrive cast rope say word jump boat

24,"""The ship, which was a collier, was soon out of port, and before the day had dawned I found myself on the wide ocean, which was hereafter to be my home.",ship collier port day dawn find wide ocean home 
25,"""As soon as the hurry and confusion were over, I was examined by the captain, who appeared to me to be a very rough, harsh man; indeed, before the day was over I almost repented of the step which I had taken, and when I sat down cold and wet upon some old sail at night, the thoughts of my mother, and what distress I should occasion her, for the first time rushed into my mind, and I wept bitterly; but it was too late then.  I have often thought, Mr Seagrave, that the life of hardship which I have since gone through has been a judgment on me for my cruelty to my mother, in leaving her the way I did.  It broke her heart; a poor return, William, for all her care and kindness!  God forgive me!""",hurry confusion examine captain appear rough harsh man day repent step take sit cold wet old sail night thought mother distress occasion first time rush mind goot late think life hardship go judgment cruelty mother leave way break heart poor return care kindness forgive 
26,"Old Ready left off for some little time, and the remainder of the party kept silence.  Then he said--""I'll leave off now, if you please: I don't feel inclined to go on; my heart is full when I recall that foolish and wicked deed of mine.""",old ready leave little time remainder party keep silence say leave feel inclined go heart full recall foolish wicked deed
