3,"""You're very good,"" said Horace, whose anger had almost evaporated in the relief of the Jinnee's unexpected return, ""but I don't think any head can survive this sort of thing long.""",good say anger evaporate relief unexpected return think head survive sort thing 
4,"""Art thou content with this dwelling I have provided for thee?"" inquired the Jinnee, glancing around the stately hall with perceptible complacency.",art content dwelling provide inquire glance stately hall perceptible complacency 
5,"It would have been positively brutal to say how very far from contented he felt, so Horace could only mumble that he had never been lodged like that before in all his life.",brutal say content feel mumble lodg life 
6,"""It is far below thy deserts,"" Fakrash observed graciously. ""And were thy friends amazed at the manner of their entertainment?""",desert observe friend amaze manner entertainment 
7,"""They were,"" said Horace.",say 
8,"""A sure method of preserving friends is to feast them with liberality,"" remarked the Jinnee.",sure method preserve friend feast liberality remark 
9,"This was rather more than Horace's temper could stand. ""You were kind enough to provide my friends with such a feast,"" he said, ""that they'll never come _here_ again.""",more temper stand kind provide friend feast say come 
10,"""How so? Were not the meats choice and abounding in fatness? Was not the wine sweet, and the sherbet like unto perfumed snow?""",meat choice abound fatness wine sweet sherbet perfumed snow 
11,"""Oh, everything was--er--as nice as possible,"" said Horace. ""Couldn't have been better.""",nice possible say good 
12,"""Yet thou sayest that thy friends will return no more--for what reason?""",sayest friend return reason 
13,"""Well, you see,"" explained Horace, reluctantly, ""there's such a thing as doing people _too_ well. I mean, it isn't everybody that appreciates Arabian cooking. But they might have stood that. It was the dancing-girl that did for me.""",see explain be thing do person mean appreciate arabian cooking stand dancing girl do 
14,"""I commanded that a houri, lovelier than the full moon, and graceful as a young gazelle, should appear for the delight of thy guests.""",command houri lovely full moon graceful young gazelle appear delight guest

16,"""Acquaint me with that which hath occurred--for I perceive plainly that something hath fallen out contrary to thy desires.""",acquaint have occur perceive have fall contrary desire 
17,"""Well,"" said Horace, ""if it had been a bachelor party, there would have been no harm in the houri; but, as it happened, two of my guests were ladies, and they--well, they not unnaturally put a wrong construction on it all.""",say bachelor party be harm houri happen guest lady put wrong construction 
18,"""Verily,"" exclaimed the Jinnee, ""thy words are totally incomprehensible to me.""",exclaim word incomprehensible 
19,"""I don't know what the custom may be in Arabia,"" said Horace, ""but with us it is not usual for a man to engage a houri to dance after dinner to amuse the lady he is proposing to marry. It's the kind of attention she'd be most unlikely to appreciate.",know custom say usual man engage houri dance dinner amuse lady propose marry kind attention unlikely appreciate 
20,"""Then was one of thy guests the damsel whom thou art seeking to marry?""",guest damsel art seek marry 
21,"""She was,"" said Horace, ""and the other two were her father and mother. From which you may imagine that it was not altogether agreeable for me when your gazelle threw herself at my feet and hugged my knees and declared that I was the light of her eyes. Of course, it all meant nothing--it's probably the conventional behaviour for a gazelle, and I'm not reflecting upon her in the least. But, in the circumstances, it _was_ compromising.""",say other father mother imagine agreeable gazelle throw foot hugge knee declare light eye course mean conventional behaviour gazelle reflect least circumstance compromise 
22,"""I thought,"" said Fakrash, ""that thou assuredst me that thou wast not contracted to any damsel?""",think say assuredst contract damsel 
23,"""I think I only said that there was no one whom I would trouble you to procure as a wife for me,"" replied Horace; ""I certainly was engaged--though, after this evening, my engagement is at an end--unless ... that reminds me, do you happen to know whether there really _was_ an inscription on the seal of your bottle, and what it said?""",think say be trouble procure wife reply engage evening engagement end remind happen know inscription seal bottle say 
24,"""I know naught of any inscription,"" said the Jinnee; ""bring me the seal that I may see it.""",know naught inscription say bring seal see 
25,"""I haven't got it by me at this moment,"" said Horace; ""I lent it to my friend--the father of this young lady I told you of. You see, Mr. Fakrash, you got me into--I mean, I was in such a hole over this affair that I was obliged to make a clean breast of it to him. And he wouldn't believe it, so it struck me that there might be an inscription of some sort on the seal, saying who you were, and why Solomon had you confined in the bottle. Then the Professor would be obliged to admit that there's something in my story.""",get moment say loan friend father young lady tell see get mean hole affair oblige make clean breast believe strike be inscription sort seal say confine bottle oblige admit be story 
26,"""Truly, I wonder at thee and at the smallness of thy penetration,"" the Jinnee commented; ""for if there were indeed any writing upon this seal, it is not possible that one of thy race should be able to decipher it.""",wonder smallness penetration comment be writing seal possible race able decipher 
27,"""Oh, I beg your pardon,"" said Horace; ""Professor Futvoye is an Oriental scholar; he can make out any inscription, no matter how many thousands of years old it may be. If anything's there, he'll decipher it. The question is whether anything _is_ there.""",beg pardon say oriental scholar make inscription matter many thousand year old decipher question 
28,"The effect of this speech on Fakrash was as unexpected as it was inexplicable: the Jinnee's features, usually so mild, began to work convulsively until they became terrible to look at, and suddenly, with a fierce howl, he shot up to nearly double his ordinary stature.",effect speech unexpected inexplicable feature mild begin work become terrible look fierce howl shoot double ordinary stature 
29,"""O thou of little sense and breeding!"" he cried, in a loud voice; ""how camest thou to deliver the bottle in which I was confined into the hands of this learned man?""",little sense breeding cry loud voice camest deliver bottle confine hand learn man 
30,"Ventimore, startled as he was, did not lose his self-possession. ""My dear sir,"" he said, ""I did not suppose you could have any further use for it. And, as a matter of fact, I didn't give Professor Futvoye the bottle--which is over there in the corner--but merely the stopper. I wish you wouldn't tower over me like that--it gives me a crick in the neck to talk to you. Why on earth should you make such a fuss about my lending the seal; what possible difference can it make to you even if it does confirm my story? And it's of immense importance to _me_ that the Professor should believe I told the truth.""",startle lose self possession dear sir say suppose have further use matter fact give bottle corner stopper wish tower give crick neck talk earth make fuss lending seal possible difference make confirm story immense importance _me_ believe tell truth 
31,"""I spoke in haste,"" said the Jinnee, slowly resuming his normal size, and looking slightly ashamed of his recent outburst as well as uncommonly foolish. ""The bottle truly is of no value; and as for the stopper, since it is but lent, it is no great matter. If there be any legend upon the seal, perchance this learned man of whom thou speakest will by this time have deciphered it?""",speak haste say resume normal size look ashamed recent outburst foolish bottle value stopper loan great matter be legend seal perchance learn man speakest time decipher 
32,"""No,"" said Horace, ""he won't tackle it till to-morrow. And it's as likely as not that when he does he won't find any reference to _you_--and I shall be up a taller tree than ever!""",say tackle likely find reference tall tree 
33,"""Art thou so desirous that he should receive proof that thy story is true?""",art desirous receive proof story true

35,"""Who can satisfy him so surely as I?""",satisfy 
36,"""You!"" cried Horace. ""Do you mean to say you really would? Mr. Fakrash, you _are_ an old brick! That would be the very thing!""",cry mean say old brick very thing 
37,"""There is naught,"" said the Jinnee, smiling indulgently, ""that I would not do to promote thy welfare, for thou hast rendered me inestimable service. Acquaint me therefore with the abode of this sage, and I will present myself before him, and if haply he should find no inscription upon the seal, or its purport should be hidden from him, then will I convince him that thou hast spoken the truth and no lie.""",be naught say smile do promote welfare hast render inestimable service acquaint abode sage present find inscription seal purport hide convince speak truth lie 
38,"Horace very willingly gave him the Professor's address. ""Only don't drop in on him to-night, you know,"" he thought it prudent to add, ""or you might startle him. Call any time after breakfast to-morrow, and you'll find him in.""",give address drop night know think prudent add startle call time breakfast find 
39,"""To-night,"" said Fakrash, ""I return to pursue my search after Suleyman (on whom be peace!). For not yet have I found him.""",night say return pursue search peace find 
40,"""If you _will_ try to do so many things at once,"" said Horace, ""I don't see how you can expect much result.""",try do many thing say see expect much result 
41,"""At Nineveh they knew him not--for where I left a city I found but a heap of ruins, tenanted by owls and bats.""",know leave city find heap ruin tenant owl bat 
42,"""_They say the lion and the lizard keep the Courts_----"" murmured Horace, half to himself. ""I was afraid you might be disappointed with Nineveh myself. Why not run over to Sheba? You might hear of him there.""",say lion lizard keep murmure half afraid disappointed run hear 
43,"""Seba of El-Yemen--the country of Bilkees, the Queen beloved of Suleyman,"" said the Jinnee. ""It is an excellent suggestion, and I will follow it without delay.""",country beloved say excellent suggestion follow delay 
44,"""But you won't forget to look in on Professor Futvoye to-morrow, will you?""",forget look 
45,"""Assuredly I will not. And now, ere I depart, tell me if there be any other service I may render thee.""",depart tell be other service render 
46,"Horace hesitated. ""There _is_ just one,"" he said, ""only I'm afraid you'll be offended if I mention it.""",hesitate say afraid offend mention 
47,"""On the head and the eye be thy commands!"" said the Jinnee; ""for whatsoever thou desirest shall be accomplished, provided that it lie within my power to perform it.""",head eye command say desirest accomplish provide lie power perform 
48,"""Well,"" said Horace, ""if you're sure you don't mind, I'll tell you. You've transformed this house into a wonderful place, more like the Alhambra--I don't mean the one in Leicester Square--than a London lodging-house. But then I am only a lodger here, and the people the house belongs to--excellent people in their way--would very much rather have the house as it was. They have a sort of idea that they won't be able to let these rooms as easily as the others.""",say sure mind tell transform house wonderful place mean one lodging house lodger person house belong excellent person way have house have sort idea able let room other 
49,"""Base and sordid dogs!"" said the Jinnee, with contempt.",base sordid dog say contempt

51,"""If they abandon this dwelling, thou wilt remain in the more secure possession.""",abandon dwelling remain secure possession 
52,"""Oh, _shall_ I, though? They'll go to law and have me turned out, and I shall have to pay ruinous damages into the bargain. So, you see, what you intended as a kindness will only bring me bad luck.""",go law have turn have pay ruinous damage bargain see intend kindness bring bad luck 
53,"""Come--without more words--to the statement of thy request,"" said Fakrash, ""for I am in haste.""",come more word statement request say haste 
54,"""All I want you to do,"" replied Horace, in some anxiety as to what the effect of his request would be, ""is to put everything here back to what it was before. It won't take you a minute.""",want do reply anxiety effect request put take minute 
55,"""Of a truth,"" exclaimed Fakrash, ""to bestow a favour upon thee is but a thankless undertaking, for not once, but twice, hast thou rejected my benefits--and now, behold, I am at a loss to devise means to gratify thee!""",truth exclaim bestow favour thankless undertaking hast reject benefit loss devise means gratify 
56,"""I know I've abused your good nature,"" said Horace; ""but if you'll only do this, and then convince the Professor that my story is true, I shall be more than satisfied. I'll never ask another favour of you!""",know abuse good nature say do convince story true more satisfied ask favour

58,"He raised his arms above his head, and shot up like a rocket towards the lofty dome, which split asunder to let him pass. Horace, as he gazed after him, had a momentary glimpse of deep blue sky, with a star or two that seemed to be hurrying through the transparent opal scud, before the roof closed in once more.",raise arm head shoot rocket lofty dome split let pass gaze have momentary glimpse deep blue sky star seem hurry transparent opal scud roof close more 
59,"Then came a low, rumbling sound, with a shock like a mild earthquake: the slender pillars swayed under their horseshoe arches; the big hanging-lanterns went out; the walls narrowed, and the floor heaved and rose--till Ventimore found himself up in his own familiar sitting-room once more, in the dark. Outside he could see the great square still shrouded in grey haze--the street lamps flickering in the wind; a belated reveller was beguiling his homeward way by rattling his stick against the railings as he passed.",come low rumble sound shock mild earthquake slender pillar sway horseshoe arche big hanging lantern go wall narrow floor heave rise find own familiar sitting room dark see great square shroud grey haze street lamp flicker wind belated reveller beguil homeward way rattling stick railing pass 
60,"Inside the room everything was exactly as before, and Horace found it difficult to believe that a few minutes earlier he had been standing on that same site, but twenty feet or so below his present level, in a spacious blue-tiled hall, with a domed ceiling and gaudy pillared arches.",room find difficult believe few minute stand same site foot present level spacious blue tile hall dome ceiling gaudy pillare arche 
61,"But he was very far from regretting his short-lived splendour; he burnt with shame and resentment whenever he thought of that nightmare banquet, which was so unlike the quiet, unpretentious little dinner he had looked forward to.",regret short live splendour burn shame resentment think nightmare banquet quiet unpretentious little dinner look 
62,"However, it was over now, and it was useless to worry himself about what could not be helped. Besides, fortunately, there was no great harm done; the Jinnee had been brought to see his mistake, and, to do him justice, had shown himself willing enough to put it right. He had promised to go and see the Professor next day, and the result of the interview could not fail to be satisfactory. And after this, Ventimore thought, Fakrash would have the sense and good feeling not to interfere in his affairs again.",useless worry help be great harm do bring see mistake do justice show willing put promise go see next day result interview fail satisfactory think have sense good feeling interfere affair 
63,"Meanwhile he could sleep now with a mind free from his worst anxieties, and he went to his room in a spirit of intense thankfulness that he had a Christian bed to sleep in. He took off his gorgeous robes--the only things that remained to prove to him that the events of that evening had been no delusion--and locked them in his wardrobe with a sense of relief that he would never be required to wear them again, and his last conscious thought before he fell asleep was the comforting reflection that, if there were any barrier between Sylvia and himself, it would be removed in the course of a very few more hours.",sleep mind free bad anxiety go room spirit intense thankfulness have christian bed sleep take gorgeous robe only thing remain prove event evening delusion lock wardrobe sense relief require wear last conscious thought fall asleep comforting reflection be barrier remove course few more hour
