But one good point in Fakrash is that he _does_ take a hint in good part, and, as soon as he can be made to see where he's wrong, he's always ready to set things right. And he thoroughly understands now that these Oriental dodges of his won't do nowadays, and that when people see a penniless man suddenly wallowing in riches they naturally want to know how he came by them. I don't suppose he will trouble me much in future. If he should look in now and then, I must put up with it. Perhaps, if I suggested it, he wouldn't mind coming in some form that would look less outlandish. If he would get himself up as a banker, or a bishop--the Bishop of Bagdad, say--I shouldn't care how often he called. Only, I can't have him coming down the chimney in either capacity.

71,"Then Horace understood. His indefatigable Jinnee had been at work again! Of course, for Fakrash it must have been what he would term ""the easiest of affairs""--especially after a glance at the plans (and Ventimore remembered that the Jinnee had surprised him at work upon them, and even requested to have them explained to him)--to dispense with contractors and bricklayers and carpenters, and construct the entire building in the course of a single night.",understand indefatigable work course term easy affair glance plan remember surprise work request have explain dispense contractor bricklayer carpenter construct entire building course single night

80,"Horace's dismay was curiously shot with relief. The Jinnee, who was certainly very far from being a genius except by courtesy, had taken it upon himself to erect the palace according to his own notions of Arabian domestic luxury--and Horace, taught by bitter experience, could sympathise to some extent with his unfortunate client. On the other hand, it was balm to his smarting self-respect to find that it was not his own plans, after all, which had been found so preposterous; and, by some obscure mental process, which I do not propose to explain, he became reconciled, and almost grateful, to the officious Fakrash. And then, too, he was _his_ Jinnee, and Horace had no intention of letting him be bullied by an outsider.",dismay shoot relief genius courtesy take erect palace accord own notion arabian domestic luxury teach bitter experience sympathise extent unfortunate client other hand balm smart self respect find own plan find preposterous obscure mental process propose explain become reconcile grateful officious have intention let bull outsider

I couldn't afford to keep it up, and I won't have it cumbering my land. Do you hear? _I won't!_ I'll go to law, cost me what it may, and compel you and your Arabian friends there to pull the thing down.

109,"""That is a thing that cannot be,"" returned the Jinnee, ""seeing that thou hast all the credit.""",thing return see hast credit 
110,"""The credit! This is England, not Arabia.

""And save for the magnitude of thy service unto me, I would not hearken to this caprice of thine, nor wilt thou find me so indulgent on another occasion.

118,"""Another surprise for poor old Wackerbath,"" thought Horace, ""but a pleasant one this time. My dear Mr. Fakrash,"" he said aloud, ""I really can't say how grateful I am to you.

127,"There was the oddest expression in the Jinnee's furtive eyes: a kind of elfin mischief combined with a sense of wrong-doing, like a naughty child whose palate is still reminiscent of illicit jam. ""Because,"" he replied, with a sound between a giggle and a chuckle, ""because, in order to overcome his unbelief, it was necessary to transform him into a one-eyed mule of hideous appearance.""",be oddest expression furtive eye kind elfin mischief combine sense wrong do naughty child palate reminiscent illicit jam reply sound giggle chuckle order overcome unbelief necessary transform eyed mule hideous appearance

129,"""Fakrash!"" shouted Horace, ""Mr. Fakrash! Come back! Do you hear? I _must_ speak to you!"" There was no answer; the Jinnee might be well on his way to Lake Chad, or Jericho, by that time--he was certainly far enough from Great Cloister Street.",shout come hear speak be answer way time great 
130,"Horace sat down at his drawing-table, and, his head buried in his hands, tried to think out this latest complication. Fakrash had transformed Professor Futvoye into a one-eyed mule. It would have seemed incredible, almost unthinkable, once, but so many impossibilities had happened to Horace of late that one more made little or no strain upon his credulity.",sit draw table head bury hand try think late complication transform eyed mule seem incredible unthinkable many impossibility happen late more make little strain credulity 
131,"What he felt chiefly was the new barrier that this event must raise between himself and Sylvia; to do him justice, the mere fact that the father of his _fiancée_ was a mule did not lessen his ardour in the slightest. Even if he had felt no personal responsibility for the calamity, he loved Sylvia far too well to be deterred by it, and few family cupboards are without a skeleton of some sort.",feel new barrier event raise do justice mere fact father _fiancée_ mule less ardour slight feel personal responsibility calamity love deterre few family cupboard skeleton sort

133,"But the real point, as he instantly recognised, was whether in the changed condition of circumstances Sylvia would consent to marry _him_. Might she not, after the experiences of that abominable dinner of his the night before, connect him in some way with her poor father's transformation? She might even suspect him of employing this means of compelling the Professor to renew their engagement; and, indeed, Horace was by no means certain himself that the Jinnee might not have acted from some muddle-headed motive of this kind. It was likely enough that the Professor, after learning the truth, should have refused to allow his daughter to marry the _protégé_ of so dubious a patron, and that Fakrash had then resorted to pressure.",real point recognise change condition circumstance consent marry experience abominable dinner night connect way poor father transformation suspect employ means compelling renew engagement means certain act muddle head motive kind likely learn truth refuse allow daughter marry _protégé_ dubious patron resort pressure

135,"It would be unseemly to set down here all that Horace said and thought of the person who had brought all this upon them, but after some wild and futile raving he became calm enough to recognise that his proper place was by Sylvia's side. Perhaps he ought to have told her at first, and then she would have been less unprepared for this--and yet how could he trouble her mind so long as he could cling to the hope that the Jinnee would cease to interfere?",unseemly set say think person bring wild futile raving become calm recognise proper place side tell first unprepared trouble mind cling hope cease interfere

137,"Besides, he could cheer them up; he could bring with him a message of hope. No doubt they believed that the Professor's transformation would be permanent--a harrowing prospect for so united a family; but, fortunately, Horace would be able to reassure them on this point.",cheer bring message hope doubt believe transformation permanent harrowing prospect unite family able reassure point
