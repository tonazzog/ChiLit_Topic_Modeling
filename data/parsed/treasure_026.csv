2,"OWING to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water, and from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but the surface of the bay. Hands, who was not so far up, was in consequence nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks. He rose once to the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good. As the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together on the clean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel's sides. A fish or two whipped past his body. Sometimes, by the quivering of the water, he appeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise. But he was dead enough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my slaughter.",owing cant vessel mast hang water perch cross tree have surface bay hand consequence ship fall bulwark rise surface lather foam blood sink good water settle see lie huddle clean bright sand shadow vessel side fish whip body quivering water appear move little try rise dead shoot drown food fish very place design slaughter 
3,"I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick, faint, and terrified. The hot blood was running over my back and chest. The dirk, where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot iron; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me, for these, it seemed to me, I could bear without a murmur; it was the horror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that still green water, beside the body of the coxswain.",certain begin feel sick faint terrified hot blood run back chest dirk pinn shoulder mast seem burn hot iron much real suffering distress seem bear murmur horror have mind fall cross -tree green water body coxswain 
4,"I clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if to cover up the peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted down to a more natural time, and I was once more in possession of myself.",cling hand nail ach shut eye cover peril mind come pulse quiet natural time possession 
5,"It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me, and I desisted with a violent shudder. Oddly enough, that very shudder did the business. The knife, in fact, had come the nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a mere pinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. The blood ran down the faster, to be sure, but I was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and shirt.",first thought pluck dirk stick nerve fail desisted violent shudder shudder do business knife fact come near world miss hold mere pinch skin shudder tore blood run fast sure own master tack mast coat shirt 
6,"These last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained the deck by the starboard shrouds. For nothing in the world would I have again ventured, shaken as I was, upon the overhanging port shrouds from which Israel had so lately fallen.",last break sudden jerk regain deck starboard shroud world venture shake overhang port shroud fall 
7,"I went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good deal and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it greatly gall me when I used my arm. Then I looked around me, and as the ship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it from its last passenger--the dead man, O'Brien.",go do wound pain good deal ble deep dangerous gall use arm look ship sense own begin think clear last passenger dead man 
8,"He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how different from life's colour or life's comeliness! In that position I could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave, tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding plunge; the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splash subsided, I could see him and Israel lying side by side, both wavering with the tremulous movement of the water. O'Brien, though still quite a young man, was very bald. There he lay, with that bald head across the knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over both.",pitch say bulwark lay horrible ungainly sort puppet life size different life colour life comeliness position have way habit tragical adventure wear terror dead take waist sack bran good heave tumble go sound plunge red cap come remain float surface splash subside see lie side side waver tremulous movement water young man bald lay bald head knee man kill quick fish steering for 
9,"I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had sprung up, and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro.",alone ship tide turn sun few degree setting shadow pine western shore begin reach anchorage fall pattern deck evening breeze spring ward hill peak east cordage begin sing little idle sail rattle for 
10,"I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. Of course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. The peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall, that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the HISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like myself.",begin see danger ship jib douse bring tumble deck main sail hard matter course schooner cant boom swing board cap foot sail hang water think make dangerous strain heavy half fear meddle last get knife cut halyard peak drop great belly loose canvas float water pull like budge downhall extent accomplish rest trust luck 
11,"By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays, I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be chill; the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more on her beam-ends.",time whole anchorage fall shadow last ray remember fall glade wood shine bright jewel flowery mantle wreck begin chill tide fleeting schooner settle more more beam end 
12,"I scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough, and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myself drop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits, leaving the HISPANIOLA on her side, with her main-sail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay. About the same time, the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.",scramble look seem shallow hold cut hawser hand last security let drop water reach waist sand firm cover ripple mark wade great spirit leave side main sail trail wide surface bay same time sun go breeze whistle dusk tossing pine 
13,"At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned thence empty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. I had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the recapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer, and I hoped that even Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time.",least last sea return empty handed lay schooner clear last buccaneer ready own man board get sea have nearer fancy get stockade boast achievement blame bit truantry recapture clenching answer hope confess lose time 
14,"So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward for the block house and my companions. I remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd's anchorage ran from the two-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction that I might pass the stream while it was small. The wood was pretty open, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the corner of that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the watercourse.",think famous spirit begin set face homeward block house companion remember easterly river drain anchorage run peak hill left bend course direction pass stream small wood open keep low spur turn corner hill wade mid-calf watercourse 
15,"This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon; and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. The dusk had come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between the two peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as I judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire. And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so careless. For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes of Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?",bring encounter maroon walk keep eye side dusk come nigh hand open cleft peak become aware waver glow sky judge man island cook supper roar fire wonder heart show careless see radiance reach eye camp shore marsh 
16,Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide myself even roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and the Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few and pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits.,night fall blacker do guide destination double hill glass right hand loom faint fainter star few pale low ground wander keep trip bush roll sandy pit 
17,"Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass, and soon after I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and knew the moon had risen.",kind brightness fall look pale glimmer moonbeam alight summit glass see broad silvery move low tree know moon rise 
18,"With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near to the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies before it, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a trifle warily. It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake.",help pass remain journey walk run draw stockade begin thread grove lie thoughtless slack pace go trifle poor end adventure shoot own party mistake 
19,"The moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall here and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood, and right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees. It was red and hot, and now and again it was a little darkened--as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering.",moon climb high high light begin fall mass open district wood front glow different colour appear tree red hot little darken ember bonfire smoulder 
20,For the life of me I could not think what it might be.,life think 
21,"At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing. The western end was already steeped in moonshine; the rest, and the block house itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light. On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation, contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon. There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze.",last come border clear western end steep moonshine rest block house lay black shadow chequer long silvery streak light other side house immense fire burn clear ember shed steady red reverberation contrast mellow paleness moon be soul stir sound noise breeze 
22,"I stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror also. It had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed, by the captain's orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent.",stop much wonder heart little terror way build great fire captain order firewood begin fear go wrong absent 
23,"I stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and at a convenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the palisade.",steal eastern end keep shadow convenient place darkness thickest cross palisade 
24,"To make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and knees and crawled, without a sound, towards the corner of the house. As I drew nearer, my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant noise in itself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful ""All's well,"" never fell more reassuringly on my ear.",make assurance surer get hand knee crawl sound corner house draw heart lighten pleasant noise complain other time music hear friend snore loud peaceful sleep sea cry watch beautiful fall ear 
25,"In the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an infamous bad watch. If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. That was what it was, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and again I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard.",meantime be doubt thing keep infamous bad watch silver lad creep soul see daybreak think have captain wound blame leave danger few mount guard 
26,"By this time I had got to the door and stood up. All was dark within, so that I could distinguish nothing by the eye. As for sounds, there was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a flickering or pecking that I could in no way account for.",time get door stand dark distinguish eye sound be steady drone snorer small occasional noise flicker peck way account 
27,With my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning.,arm walk lie own place think silent chuckle enjoy face find morning 
28,"My foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper's leg; and he turned and groaned, but without awaking.",foot strike yield sleeper leg turn groan awake 
29,"And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness:",shrill voice break darkness 
30,"""Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!"" and so forth, without pause or change, like the clacking of a tiny mill.",piece piece piece piece piece pause change clacking tiny mill 
31,"Silver's green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain.",green parrot hear peck piece bark keep good watch human being announce arrival wearisome refrain 
32,"I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the voice of Silver cried, ""Who goes?""",have time leave recover sharp clipping tone parrot sleeper awoke spring mighty oath voice cry go 
33,"I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me tight.",turn run strike person recoil run full arm second part close hold tight 
34,"""Bring a torch, Dick,"" said Silver when my capture was thus assured.",bring torch say capture assure 
35,And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a lighted brand.,man leave log house return light brand
