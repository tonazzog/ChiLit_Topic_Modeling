1,CHAPTER 46. Jakes and the Lady,
2," I was sold to a corn dealer and baker, whom Jerry knew, and with him he thought I should have good food and fair work. In the first he was quite right, and if my master had always been on the premises I do not think I should have been overloaded, but there was a foreman who was always hurrying and driving every one, and frequently when I had quite a full load he would order something else to be taken on. My carter, whose name was Jakes, often said it was more than I ought to take, but the other always overruled him. “‘Twas no use going twice when once would do, and he chose to get business forward.”",sell corn dealer baker know think have good food fair work first right master premise think overload be foreman hurry drive one have full load order else take name say more take other overrule twa use go do choose get business 
3,"Jakes, like the other carters, always had the check-rein up, which prevented me from drawing easily, and by the time I had been there three or four months I found the work telling very much on my strength.",other carter have check rein prevent draw time month find work tell strength 
4,"One day I was loaded more than usual, and part of the road was a steep uphill. I used all my strength, but I could not get on, and was obliged continually to stop. This did not please my driver, and he laid his whip on badly. “Get on, you lazy fellow,” he said, “or I’ll make you.”",day load more usual part road steep uphill use strength get oblige stop please driver lay whip get lazy fellow say make 
5,"Again I started the heavy load, and struggled on a few yards; again the whip came down, and again I struggled forward. The pain of that great cart whip was sharp, but my mind was hurt quite as much as my poor sides. To be punished and abused when I was doing my very best was so hard it took the heart out of me. A third time he was flogging me cruelly, when a lady stepped quickly up to him, and said in a sweet, earnest voice:",start heavy load struggle few yard whip come struggle pain great cart whip sharp mind hurt much poor side punish abuse do very good hard take heart third time flog lady step say sweet earnest voice 
6,"“Oh! pray do not whip your good horse any more; I am sure he is doing all he can, and the road is very steep; I am sure he is doing his best.”",pray whip good horse sure do road steep sure do good 
7,"“If doing his best won’t get this load up he must do something more than his best; that’s all I know, ma’am,” said Jakes.",do good get load do more good know say 
8,“But is it not a heavy load?” she said.,heavy load say 
9,"“Yes, yes, too heavy,” he said; “but that’s not my fault; the foreman came just as we were starting, and would have three hundredweight more put on to save him trouble, and I must get on with it as well as I can.”",heavy say fault foreman come start have hundredweight put save trouble get 
10,"He was raising the whip again, when the lady said:",raise whip lady say 
11,"“Pray, stop; I think I can help you if you will let me.”",pray stop think help let 
12,The man laughed.,man laugh 
13,"“You see,” she said, “you do not give him a fair chance; he cannot use all his power with his head held back as it is with that check-rein; if you would take it off I am sure he would do better--do try it,” she said persuasively, “I should be very glad if you would.”",see say give fair chance use power head hold check rein take sure do good try say glad 
14,"“Well, well,” said Jakes, with a short laugh, “anything to please a lady, of course. How far would you wish it down, ma’am?”",say short laugh please lady course wish 
15,"“Quite down, give him his head altogether.”",give head 
16,"The rein was taken off, and in a moment I put my head down to my very knees. What a comfort it was! Then I tossed it up and down several times to get the aching stiffness out of my neck.",rein take moment put head very knee comfort toss several time get ach stiffness neck 
17,"“Poor fellow! that is what you wanted,” said she, patting and stroking me with her gentle hand; “and now if you will speak kindly to him and lead him on I believe he will be able to do better.”",poor fellow want say pat stroke gentle hand speak lead believe able do good 
18,"Jakes took the rein. “Come on, Blackie.” I put down my head, and threw my whole weight against the collar; I spared no strength; the load moved on, and I pulled it steadily up the hill, and then stopped to take breath.",take rein come put head throw whole weight collar spare strength load move pull hill stop take breath 
19,"The lady had walked along the footpath, and now came across into the road. She stroked and patted my neck, as I had not been patted for many a long day.",lady walk footpath come road stroke patt neck patt many long day 
20,"“You see he was quite willing when you gave him the chance; I am sure he is a fine-tempered creature, and I dare say has known better days. You won’t put that rein on again, will you?” for he was just going to hitch it up on the old plan.",see willing give chance sure fine temper creature say know good day put rein go hitch old plan 
21,"“Well, ma’am, I can’t deny that having his head has helped him up the hill, and I’ll remember it another time, and thank you, ma’am; but if he went without a check-rein I should be the laughing-stock of all the carters; it is the fashion, you see.”",deny have head help hill remember time thank go check rein laugh stock carter fashion see 
22,"“Is it not better,” she said, “to lead a good fashion than to follow a bad one? A great many gentlemen do not use check-reins now; our carriage horses have not worn them for fifteen years, and work with much less fatigue than those who have them; besides,” she added in a very serious voice, “we have no right to distress any of God’s creatures without a very good reason; we call them dumb animals, and so they are, for they cannot tell us how they feel, but they do not suffer less because they have no words. But I must not detain you now; I thank you for trying my plan with your good horse, and I am sure you will find it far better than the whip. Good-day,” and with another soft pat on my neck she stepped lightly across the path, and I saw her no more.",good say lead good fashion follow bad one great many gentleman use check rein carriage horse wear year work less fatigue have add serious voice have right distress creature good reason call dumb animal tell feel suffer less have word detain thank try plan good horse sure find good whip good day soft pat neck step path see more 
23,"“That was a real lady, I’ll be bound for it,” said Jakes to himself; “she spoke just as polite as if I was a gentleman, and I’ll try her plan, uphill, at any rate;” and I must do him the justice to say that he let my rein out several holes, and going uphill after that, he always gave me my head; but the heavy loads went on. Good feed and fair rest will keep up one’s strength under full work, but no horse can stand against overloading; and I was getting so thoroughly pulled down from this cause that a younger horse was bought in my place. I may as well mention here what I suffered at this time from another cause. I had heard horses speak of it, but had never myself had experience of the evil; this was a badly-lighted stable; there was only one very small window at the end, and the consequence was that the stalls were almost dark.",real lady bind say speak polite gentleman try plan uphill rate do justice say let rein several hole go give head heavy load go good feed fair rest keep strength full work horse stand overload get pull cause young horse buy place mention suffer time cause hear horse speak have experience evil light stable be small window end consequence stall dark 
24,"Besides the depressing effect this had on my spirits, it very much weakened my sight, and when I was suddenly brought out of the darkness into the glare of daylight it was very painful to my eyes. Several times I stumbled over the threshold, and could scarcely see where I was going.",depressing effect have spirit weaken sight bring darkness glare daylight painful eye several time stumble threshold see go 
25,"I believe, had I stayed there very long, I should have become purblind, and that would have been a great misfortune, for I have heard men say that a stone-blind horse was safer to drive than one which had imperfect sight, as it generally makes them very timid. However, I escaped without any permanent injury to my sight, and was sold to a large cab owner.",believe stay become purblind great misfortune hear man say stone blind horse safe drive have imperfect sight make timid escape permanent injury sight sell large cab owner
