2,"     I will remember what I was, I am sick of rope and chain--         I will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs.

4,"Kala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the Indian Government in every way that an elephant could serve it for forty-seven years, and as he was fully twenty years old when he was caught, that makes him nearly seventy--a ripe age for an elephant. He remembered pushing, with a big leather pad on his forehead, at a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was before the Afghan War of 1842, and he had not then come to his full strength.",mean black serve indian way elephant serve year year old catch make ripe age elephant remember push big leather pad forehead gun stick deep mud afghan come full strength 
5,"His mother Radha Pyari,--Radha the darling,--who had been caught in the same drive with Kala Nag, told him, before his little milk tusks had dropped out, that elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag knew that that advice was good, for the first time that he saw a shell burst he backed, screaming, into a stand of piled rifles, and the bayonets pricked him in all his softest places. So, before he was twenty-five, he gave up being afraid, and so he was the best-loved and the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government of India. He had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds’ weight of tents, on the march in Upper India. He had been hoisted into a ship at the end of a steam crane and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a mortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from India, and had seen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had come back again in the steamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the Abyssinian War medal. He had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid, ten years later; and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles south to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at Moulmein. There he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was shirking his fair share of work.",mother darling catch same drive tell little milk tusk drop elephant afraid hurt know advice good first time see shell burst back scream stand pile rifle bayonet prick softest place give afraid good love good look elephant service carry tent pound weight tent march upper hoist ship end steam crane take day water make carry mortar back strange rocky country see emperor lie dead come steamer entitle soldier say abyssinian medal see fellow elephant die cold epilepsy starvation sunstroke place call year send thousand mile haul pile big balk teak timberyard half kill insubordinate young elephant shirk fair share work 
6,"After that he was taken off timber-hauling, and employed, with a few score other elephants who were trained to the business, in helping to catch wild elephants among the Garo hills. Elephants are very strictly preserved by the Indian Government. There is one whole department which does nothing else but hunt them, and catch them, and break them in, and send them up and down the country as they are needed for work.",take timber hauling employ few score other elephant train business help catch wild elephant hill elephant preserve indian be whole department do else hunt catch break send country need work 
7,"Kala Nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders, and his tusks had been cut off short at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them splitting, with bands of copper; but he could do more with those stumps than any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones. When, after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across the hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last stockade, and the big drop gate, made of tree trunks lashed together, jarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word of command, would go into that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally at night, when the flicker of the torches made it difficult to judge distances), and, picking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer him and hustle him into quiet while the men on the backs of the other elephants roped and tied the smaller ones.",stand fair foot shoulder tusk cut short foot bind end prevent split band copper do more stump untrained elephant do real sharpen one week week cautious driving scatter elephant hill wild monster drive last stockade big drop gate make tree trunk lash jarr word command go flaring trumpet pandemonium night flicker torche make difficult judge distance pick big wild tusker mob hammer hustle quiet man back other elephant rope tie small one 
8,"There was nothing in the way of fighting that Kala Nag, the old wise Black Snake, did not know, for he had stood up more than once in his time to the charge of the wounded tiger, and, curling up his soft trunk to be out of harm’s way, had knocked the springing brute sideways in mid-air with a quick sickle cut of his head, that he had invented all by himself; had knocked him over, and kneeled upon him with his huge knees till the life went out with a gasp and a howl, and there was only a fluffy striped thing on the ground for Kala Nag to pull by the tail.",be way fighting old wise black know stand more time charge wound tiger curl soft trunk harm way knock springing brute mid-air quick sickle cut head invent knock kneel huge knee life go gasp howl be fluffy stripe thing ground pull tail 
9,"“Yes,” said Big Toomai, his driver, the son of Black Toomai who had taken him to Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants who had seen him caught, “there is nothing that the Black Snake fears except me. He has seen three generations of us feed him and groom him, and he will live to see four.”",say big driver son black take grandson see catch be black fear see generation feed groom live see 
10,"“He is afraid of me also,” said Little Toomai, standing up to his full height of four feet, with only one rag upon him. He was ten years old, the eldest son of Big Toomai, and, according to custom, he would take his father’s place on Kala Nag’s neck when he grew up, and would handle the heavy iron ankus, the elephant goad, that had been worn smooth by his father, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather.",afraid say little stand full height foot rag year old old son big accord custom take father place neck grow handle heavy iron ankus elephant goad wear smooth father grandfather great grandfather 
11,"He knew what he was talking of; for he had been born under Kala Nag’s shadow, had played with the end of his trunk before he could walk, had taken him down to water as soon as he could walk, and Kala Nag would no more have dreamed of disobeying his shrill little orders than he would have dreamed of killing him on that day when Big Toomai carried the little brown baby under Kala Nag’s tusks, and told him to salute his master that was to be.",know talk bear shadow play end trunk walk take water walk dream disobey shrill little order dream kill day big carry little brown baby tusk tell salute master 
12,"“Yes,” said Little Toomai, “he is afraid of me,” and he took long strides up to Kala Nag, called him a fat old pig, and made him lift up his feet one after the other.",say little afraid take long stride call fat old pig make lift foot other 
13,"“Wah!” said Little Toomai, “thou art a big elephant,” and he wagged his fluffy head, quoting his father. “The Government may pay for elephants, but they belong to us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag, there will come some rich rajah, and he will buy thee from the Government, on account of thy size and thy manners, and then thou wilt have nothing to do but to carry gold earrings in thy ears, and a gold howdah on thy back, and a red cloth covered with gold on thy sides, and walk at the head of the processions of the King. Then I shall sit on thy neck, O Kala Nag, with a silver ankus, and men will run before us with golden sticks, crying, `Room for the King’s elephant!’ That will be good, Kala Nag, but not so good as this hunting in the jungles.”",say little art big elephant wagg fluffy head quote father government pay elephant belong mahout art old come rich rajah buy account size manners have do carry gold earring ear gold howdah back red cloth cover gold side walk head procession sit neck silver ankus man run golden stick cry room elephant good good hunting jungle 
14,"“Umph!” said Big Toomai. “Thou art a boy, and as wild as a buffalo-calf. This running up and down among the hills is not the best Government service. I am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants. Give me brick elephant lines, one stall to each elephant, and big stumps to tie them to safely, and flat, broad roads to exercise upon, instead of this come-and-go camping. Aha, the Cawnpore barracks were good. There was a bazaar close by, and only three hours’ work a day.”",say big art boy wild buffalo calf run hill good government service get old love wild elephant give brick elephant line stall elephant big stump tie flat broad road exercise come go camping barrack good be bazaar hour work day 
15,"Little Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing. He very much preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat roads, with the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve, and the long hours when there was nothing to do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in his pickets.",little remember elephant line say prefer camp life hate broad flat road daily grubbing grass forage reserve long hour be do watch fidget picket 
16,"What Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths that only an elephant could take; the dip into the valley below; the glimpses of the wild elephants browsing miles away; the rush of the frightened pig and peacock under Kala Nag’s feet; the blinding warm rains, when all the hills and valleys smoked; the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew where they would camp that night; the steady, cautious drive of the wild elephants, and the mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of the last night’s drive, when the elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a landslide, found that they could not get out, and flung themselves at the heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring torches and volleys of blank cartridge.",little like scramble bridle path elephant take dip valley glimpse wild elephant browse mile rush frighten pig peacock foot blind warm rain hill valley smoke beautiful misty morning know camp night steady cautious drive wild elephant mad rush blaze hullabaloo last night drive elephant pour stockade boulder landslide find get flung heavy post drive yell flare torche volley blank cartridge 
17,"Even a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai was as useful as three boys. He would get his torch and wave it, and yell with the best. But the really good time came when the driving out began, and the Keddah--that is, the stockade--looked like a picture of the end of the world, and men had to make signs to one another, because they could not hear themselves speak. Then Little Toomai would climb up to the top of one of the quivering stockade posts, his sun-bleached brown hair flying loose all over his shoulders, and he looking like a goblin in the torch-light. And as soon as there was a lull you could hear his high-pitched yells of encouragement to Kala Nag, above the trumpeting and crashing, and snapping of ropes, and groans of the tethered elephants. “Mael, mael, Kala Nag! (Go on, go on, Black Snake!) Dant do! (Give him the tusk!) Somalo! Somalo! (Careful, careful!) Maro! Mar! (Hit him, hit him!) Mind the post! Arre! Arre! Hai! Yai! Kya-a-ah!” he would shout, and the big fight between Kala Nag and the wild elephant would sway to and fro across the Keddah, and the old elephant catchers would wipe the sweat out of their eyes, and find time to nod to Little Toomai wriggling with joy on the top of the posts.",little boy use useful boy get torch wave yell good good time come driving begin stockade look picture end world man have make sign hear speak little climb top quiver stockade post sun-bleached brown hair fly shoulder look goblin torch light be lull hear high pitch yell encouragement trumpeting crashing snapping rope groan tether elephant go go black do give tusk careful careful hit hit mind post shout big fight wild elephant sway for old elephant catcher wipe sweat eye find time nod little wriggle joy top post 
18,"He did more than wriggle. One night he slid down from the post and slipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope, which had dropped, to a driver who was trying to get a purchase on the leg of a kicking young calf (calves always give more trouble than full-grown animals). Kala Nag saw him, caught him in his trunk, and handed him up to Big Toomai, who slapped him then and there, and put him back on the post.",do more wriggle night slide post slip elephant throw loose end rope drop driver try get purchase leg kick young calf calve give more trouble full grow animal see catch trunk hand big slap put post 
19,"Next morning he gave him a scolding and said, “Are not good brick elephant lines and a little tent carrying enough, that thou must needs go elephant catching on thy own account, little worthless? Now those foolish hunters, whose pay is less than my pay, have spoken to Petersen Sahib of the matter.” Little Toomai was frightened. He did not know much of white men, but Petersen Sahib was the greatest white man in the world to him. He was the head of all the Keddah operations--the man who caught all the elephants for the Government of India, and who knew more about the ways of elephants than any living man.",next morning give scolding say good brick elephant line little tent carry need go elephant catching own account little worthless foolish hunter pay less pay speak matter little frighten know much white man great white man world head operation man catch elephant know more way elephant living man 
20,“What--what will happen?” said Little Toomai.,happen say little 
21,"“Happen! The worst that can happen. Petersen Sahib is a madman. Else why should he go hunting these wild devils? He may even require thee to be an elephant catcher, to sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles, and at last to be trampled to death in the Keddah. It is well that this nonsense ends safely. Next week the catching is over, and we of the plains are sent back to our stations. Then we will march on smooth roads, and forget all this hunting. But, son, I am angry that thou shouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these dirty Assamese jungle folk. Kala Nag will obey none but me, so I must go with him into the Keddah, but he is only a fighting elephant, and he does not help to rope them. So I sit at my ease, as befits a mahout,--not a mere hunter,--a mahout, I say, and a man who gets a pension at the end of his service. Is the family of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden underfoot in the dirt of a Keddah? Bad one! Wicked one! Worthless son! Go and wash Kala Nag and attend to his ears, and see that there are no thorns in his feet. Or else Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and make thee a wild hunter--a follower of elephant’s foot tracks, a jungle bear. Bah! Shame! Go!”",happen bad happen madman go hunt wild devil require elephant catcher sleep fever fill jungle last trample death nonsense end next week catching plain send station march smooth road forget hunting son angry meddle business belong dirty assamese jungle folk obey go fight elephant help rope sit ease befit mahout mere hunter mahout say man get pension end service family trodd underfoot dirt bad one wicked one worthless son go wash attend ear see be thorn foot catch make wild hunter follower elephant foot track jungle bear shame go 
22,"Little Toomai went off without saying a word, but he told Kala Nag all his grievances while he was examining his feet. “No matter,” said Little Toomai, turning up the fringe of Kala Nag’s huge right ear. “They have said my name to Petersen Sahib, and perhaps--and perhaps--and perhaps--who knows? Hai! That is a big thorn that I have pulled out!”",little go say word tell grievance examine foot matter say little turn fringe huge right ear say name know big thorn pull 
23,"The next few days were spent in getting the elephants together, in walking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of tame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march to the plains, and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things that had been worn out or lost in the forest.",next few day spend get elephant walk catch wild elephant couple tame one prevent give much trouble downward march plain take stock blanket rope thing wear lose forest 
24,"Petersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been paying off other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an end, and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to pay the drivers their wages. As each man was paid he went back to his elephant, and joined the line that stood ready to start. The catchers, and hunters, and beaters, the men of the regular Keddah, who stayed in the jungle year in and year out, sat on the backs of the elephants that belonged to Petersen Sahib’s permanent force, or leaned against the trees with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the drivers who were going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the line and ran about.",come clever elephant pay other camp hill season come end be native clerk sit table tree pay driver wage man pay go elephant join line stand ready start catcher hunter beater man regular stay jungle year year sit back elephant belong permanent force learn tree gun arm make fun driver go laugh catch elephant break line run

26,"Now Petersen Sahib had ears all over him, as a man must have who listens to the most silent of all living things--the wild elephant. He turned where he was lying all along on Pudmini’s back and said, “What is that? I did not know of a man among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to rope even a dead elephant.”",have ear man have listen silent living thing wild elephant turn lie say know man plain driver wit rope dead elephant

30,"Little Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him, and Toomai made a sign with his hand, and the elephant caught him up in his trunk and held him level with Pudmini’s forehead, in front of the great Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his face with his hands, for he was only a child, and except where elephants were concerned, he was just as bashful as a child could be.",little frighten speak make sign hand elephant catch trunk hold level forehead front great cover face hand child elephant concerned bashful child 
31,"“Oho!” said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, “and why didst thou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal green corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to dry?”",say smile mustache teach elephant trick help steal green corn roof house ear put dry 
32,"“Not green corn, Protector of the Poor,--melons,” said Little Toomai, and all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter.

34,"“Of that I have my doubts,” said Petersen Sahib. “A boy who can face a full Keddah at his age does not end in jails. See, little one, here are four annas to spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under that great thatch of hair. In time thou mayest become a hunter too.” Big Toomai scowled more than ever. “Remember, though, that Keddahs are not good for children to play in,” Petersen Sahib went on.",have doubt say boy face full age end jail see little one annas spend sweetmeat hast little head great thatch hair time become hunter big scowl more remember good child play go

37,"There was another roar of laughter, for that is an old joke among elephant-catchers, and it means just never. There are great cleared flat places hidden away in the forests that are called elephants’ ball-rooms, but even these are only found by accident, and no man has ever seen the elephants dance. When a driver boasts of his skill and bravery the other drivers say, “And when didst thou see the elephants dance?”",be roar laughter old joke elephant catcher mean be great clear flat place hide forest call elephant ball room find accident man see elephant dance driver boast skill bravery other driver say see elephant dance 
38,"Kala Nag put Little Toomai down, and he bowed to the earth again and went away with his father, and gave the silver four-anna piece to his mother, who was nursing his baby brother, and they all were put up on Kala Nag’s back, and the line of grunting, squealing elephants rolled down the hill path to the plains. It was a very lively march on account of the new elephants, who gave trouble at every ford, and needed coaxing or beating every other minute.",put little bow earth go father give silver anna piece mother nurse baby brother put line grunting squeal elephant roll hill path plain lively march account new elephant give trouble ford need coaxing beat other minute 
39,"Big Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he was very angry, but Little Toomai was too happy to speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him, and given him money, so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he had been called out of the ranks and praised by his commander-in-chief.",big prodd angry little happy speak notice give money feel private soldier feel call rank praise commander chief

42,"An Assamese driver, two or three elephants ahead, turned round angrily, crying: “Bring up Kala Nag, and knock this youngster of mine into good behavior. Why should Petersen Sahib have chosen me to go down with you donkeys of the rice fields? Lay your beast alongside, Toomai, and let him prod with his tusks. By all the Gods of the Hills, these new elephants are possessed, or else they can smell their companions in the jungle.” Kala Nag hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the wind out of him, as Big Toomai said, “We have swept the hills of wild elephants at the last catch. It is only your carelessness in driving. Must I keep order along the whole line?”",assamese driver elephant turn cry bring knock youngster good behavior choose go donkey rice field lay beast let prod tusk new elephant possess smell companion jungle hit new elephant rib knock wind big say sweep hill wild elephant last catch carelessness driving keep order whole line

Therefore all the wild elephants to-night will--but why should I waste wisdom on a river-turtle?”",hear say other driver sweep hill wise plain person mud head see jungle know know drive end season wild elephant night waste wisdom river turtle

49,"Then the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps of pickets, and extra ropes were fitted to the new elephants, and the fodder was piled before them, and the hill drivers went back to Petersen Sahib through the afternoon light, telling the plains drivers to be extra careful that night, and laughing when the plains drivers asked the reason.",elephant chain hind leg big stump picket extra rope fit new elephant fodder pile hill driver go afternoon light tell plain driver careful night laugh plain driver ask reason 
50,"Little Toomai attended to Kala Nag’s supper, and as evening fell, wandered through the camp, unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom. When an Indian child’s heart is full, he does not run about and make a noise in an irregular fashion. He sits down to a sort of revel all by himself. And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he had not found what he wanted, I believe he would have been ill. But the sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom-tom--a drum beaten with the flat of the hand--and he sat down, cross-legged, before Kala Nag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he thumped and he thumped and he thumped, and the more he thought of the great honor that had been done to him, the more he thumped, all alone among the elephant fodder. There was no tune and no words, but the thumping made him happy.",little attend supper evening fall wander camp happy search tom tom indian child heart full run make noise irregular fashion sit sort revel little speak find want believe ill sweetmeat seller camp loan little tom tom drum beat flat hand sit cross legged star begin come tom tom lap thump thump thump more think great honor do thump elephant fodder be tune word thumping make happy 
51,"The new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted from time to time, and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting his small brother to sleep with an old, old song about the great God Shiv, who once told all the animals what they should eat. It is a very soothing lullaby, and the first verse says:",new elephant strain rope squeal trumpet time time hear mother camp hut put small brother sleep old old song great tell animal eat soothing lullaby first verse say

53,"Little Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each verse, till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala Nag’s side. At last the elephants began to lie down one after another as is their custom, till only Kala Nag at the right of the line was left standing up; and he rocked slowly from side to side, his ears put forward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the hills. The air was full of all the night noises that, taken together, make one big silence--the click of one bamboo stem against the other, the rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk of a half-waked bird (birds are awake in the night much more often than we imagine), and the fall of water ever so far away. Little Toomai slept for some time, and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala Nag was still standing up with his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned, rustling in the fodder, and watched the curve of his big back against half the stars in heaven, and while he watched he heard, so far away that it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the stillness, the “hoot-toot” of a wild elephant.",little come joyous tunk tunk end verse feel sleepy stretch fodder side last elephant begin lie custom right line leave stand rock side side ear put listen night wind blow hill air full night noise take make big silence click bamboo stem other rustle alive undergrowth scratch squawk half wake bird bird awake night imagine fall water little sleep time wake brilliant moonlight stand ear cocked little turn rustle fodder watch curve big back star heaven watch hear sound more pinhole noise prick stillness hoot toot wild elephant 
54,"All the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and their grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and drove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and knotted that till all was quiet. One new elephant had nearly grubbed up his picket, and Big Toomai took off Kala Nag’s leg chain and shackled that elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string round Kala Nag’s leg, and told him to remember that he was tied fast. He knew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same thing hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did not answer to the order by gurgling, as he usually did. He stood still, looking out across the moonlight, his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans, up to the great folds of the Garo hills.",elephant line jump shoot grunt last wake sleeping mahout come drive picket peg big mallet tighten rope knotted quiet new elephant grubb picket big take leg chain shackle elephant fore foot hind foot slip loop grass string leg tell remember tie know father grandfather do same thing hundred time answer order gurgle stand look moonlight head little raise ear spread fan great fold hill 
55,"“Tend to him if he grows restless in the night,” said Big Toomai to Little Toomai, and he went into the hut and slept. Little Toomai was just going to sleep, too, when he heard the coir string snap with a little “tang,” and Kala Nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as silently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley. Little Toomai pattered after him, barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling under his breath, “Kala Nag! Kala Nag! Take me with you, O Kala Nag!”  The elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides back to the boy in the moonlight, put down his trunk, swung him up to his neck, and almost before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the forest.",tend grow restless night say big little go hut sleep little go sleep hear coir string snap little tang roll picket cloud roll mouth valley little patter barefoot road moonlight call breath take elephant turn sound take stride boy moonlight put trunk swing neck settle knee slip forest 
56,"There was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the silence shut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes a tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the sides of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would scrape along his back, or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder touched it. But between those times he moved absolutely without any sound, drifting through the thick Garo forest as though it had been smoke. He was going uphill, but though Little Toomai watched the stars in the rifts of the trees, he could not tell in what direction.",be blast furious trumpeting line silence shut begin move tuft high grass wash side wave wash side ship cluster wild pepper vine scrape back bamboo creak shoulder touch time move sound drift thick forest smoke go little watch star rift tree tell direction 
57,"Then Kala Nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute, and Little Toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and furry under the moonlight for miles and miles, and the blue-white mist over the river in the hollow. Toomai leaned forward and looked, and he felt that the forest was awake below him--awake and alive and crowded. A big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear; a porcupine’s quills rattled in the thicket; and in the darkness between the tree stems he heard a hog-bear digging hard in the moist warm earth, and snuffing as it digged.",reach crest ascent stop minute little see top tree lie speckle furry moonlight mile mile blue white mist river hollow learn look feel forest awake awake alive crowded big brown fruit eating bat brush ear porcupine quill rattle thicket darkness tree stem hear hog bear digg moist warm earth snuff digge 
58,"Then the branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began to go down into the valley--not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun goes down a steep bank--in one rush. The huge limbs moved as steadily as pistons, eight feet to each stride, and the wrinkled skin of the elbow points rustled. The undergrowth on either side of him ripped with a noise like torn canvas, and the saplings that he heaved away right and left with his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on the flank, and great trails of creepers, all matted together, hung from his tusks as he threw his head from side to side and plowed out his pathway. Then Little Toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging bough should sweep him to the ground, and he wished that he were back in the lines again.",branch close head begin go valley time runaway gun go steep bank rush huge limb move piston foot stride wrinkled skin elbow point rustle undergrowth side rip noise tear canvas sapling heave leave shoulder spring bang flank great trail creeper matt hang tusk throw head side side plow pathway lay great neck swing bough sweep ground wish line 
59,"The grass began to get squashy, and Kala Nag’s feet sucked and squelched as he put them down, and the night mist at the bottom of the valley chilled Little Toomai. There was a splash and a trample, and the rush of running water, and Kala Nag strode through the bed of a river, feeling his way at each step. Above the noise of the water, as it swirled round the elephant’s legs, Little Toomai could hear more splashing and some trumpeting both upstream and down--great grunts and angry snortings, and all the mist about him seemed to be full of rolling, wavy shadows.",grass begin get squashy foot suck squelch put night mist bottom valley chill little be splash trample rush run water strode bed river feel way step noise water swirl elephant leg little hear more splashing trumpet upstream great grunt angry snorting mist seem full roll wavy shadow 
60,"“Ai!” he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. “The elephant-folk are out tonight. It is the dance, then!”",say half tooth chatter elephant folk tonight dance 
61,"Kala Nag swashed out of the water, blew his trunk clear, and began another climb. But this time he was not alone, and he had not to make his path. That was made already, six feet wide, in front of him, where the bent jungle-grass was trying to recover itself and stand up. Many elephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before. Little Toomai looked back, and behind him a great wild tusker with his little pig’s eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the misty river. Then the trees closed up again, and they went on and up, with trumpetings and crashings, and the sound of breaking branches on every side of them.",swash water blow trunk clear begin climb time alone have make path make foot wide front bend jungle grass try recover stand many elephant go way few minute little look great wild tusker little pig eye glow hot coal lift misty river tree close go trumpeting crashing sound break branch side 
62,"At last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at the very top of the hill. They were part of a circle of trees that grew round an irregular space of some three or four acres, and in all that space, as Little Toomai could see, the ground had been trampled down as hard as a brick floor. Some trees grew in the center of the clearing, but their bark was rubbed away, and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and polished in the patches of moonlight. There were creepers hanging from the upper branches, and the bells of the flowers of the creepers, great waxy white things like convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. But within the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of green--nothing but the trampled earth.",last stand tree trunk very top hill part circle tree grow irregular space acre space little see ground trample brick floor tree grow center clear bark rub white wood show shiny polished patch moonlight be creeper hang upper branch bell flower creeper great waxy white thing convolvuluse hang asleep limit clear be single blade green trample earth 
63,"The moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants stood upon it, and their shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked, holding his breath, with his eyes starting out of his head, and as he looked, more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from between the tree trunks. Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and he counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the tens, and his head began to swim. Outside the clearing he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the hillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks they moved like ghosts.",moonlight show iron gray elephant stand shadow inky black little look hold breath eye start head look more more more elephant swing open tree trunk little count count finger lose count ten head begin swim clear hear crash undergrowth work way hillside circle tree trunk move ghost 
64,"There were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and twigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears; fat, slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black calves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs; young elephants with their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud of them; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious faces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights, and the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their shoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the full-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a tiger’s claws on his side.",be white tusk wild male fall leave nut twig lie wrinkle neck fold ear fat slow footed elephant restless little pinky black calve foot high run stomach young elephant tusk begin show proud lanky scraggy old maid elephant hollow anxious face trunk rough bark savage old bull elephant scarr shoulder flank great weal cut bygone fight cake dirt solitary mud bath drop shoulder be break tusk mark full stroke terrible draw scrape tiger claw side 
65,"They were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground in couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves--scores and scores of elephants.",stand head head walk for ground couple rock sway score score elephant 
66,"Toomai knew that so long as he lay still on Kala Nag’s neck nothing would happen to him, for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive a wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the neck of a tame elephant. And these elephants were not thinking of men that night. Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard the chinking of a leg iron in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen Sahib’s pet elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling up the hillside. She must have broken her pickets and come straight from Petersen Sahib’s camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that he did not know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast. He, too, must have run away from some camp in the hills about.",know lay neck happen rush scramble drive wild elephant reach trunk drag man neck tame elephant elephant think man night start put ear hear chinking leg iron forest pet elephant chain snap short grunt snuffle hillside break picket come camp little see elephant know deep rope gall back breast run camp hill 
67,"At last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest, and Kala Nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into the middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants began to talk in their own tongue, and to move about.",last be sound more elephant move forest roll station tree go middle crowd cluck gurgle elephant begin talk own tongue move 
68,"Still lying down, Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of broad backs, and wagging ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling eyes. He heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by accident, and the dry rustle of trunks twined together, and the chafing of enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd, and the incessant flick and hissh of the great tails. Then a cloud came over the moon, and he sat in black darkness. But the quiet, steady hustling and pushing and gurgling went on just the same. He knew that there were elephants all round Kala Nag, and that there was no chance of backing him out of the assembly; so he set his teeth and shivered. In a Keddah at least there was torchlight and shouting, but here he was all alone in the dark, and once a trunk came up and touched him on the knee.",lie little look score score broad back wag ear toss trunk little roll eye hear click tusk cross other tusk accident dry rustle trunk twin chafing enormous side shoulder crowd incessant flick hissh great tail cloud come moon sit black darkness quiet steady hustling push gurgling go same know be elephant be chance back assembly set tooth shiver least be torchlight shouting alone dark trunk come touch knee 
69,"Then an elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds. The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at first, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and grew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and brought them down on the ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as trip-hammers. The elephants were stamping all together now, and it sounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on, and the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that ran through him--this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth. Once or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward a few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of juicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom of feet on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and groaning somewhere near him. He put out his arm and felt the bark, but Kala Nag moved forward, still tramping, and he could not tell where he was in the clearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once, when two or three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard a thump and a shuffle, and the booming went on. It must have lasted fully two hours, and Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the smell of the night air that the dawn was coming.",elephant trumpet take terrible second dew tree spatter rain unseen back dull boom noise begin loud little tell grow grow lift forefoot other bring ground trip hammer elephant stamp sound war drum beat mouth cave dew fall tree be leave fall booming go ground rock shiver little put hand ear shut sound gigantic jar run stamp hundred heavy foot raw earth feel other surge few stride thumping change crush sound juicy green thing bruise minute boom foot hard earth begin tree creak groan put arm feel bark move tramp tell clear be sound elephant little calve squeak hear thump shuffle booming go last hour little ach nerve know smell night air dawn come 
70,"The morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills, and the booming stopped with the first ray, as though the light had been an order. Before Little Toomai had got the ringing out of his head, before even he had shifted his position, there was not an elephant in sight except Kala Nag, Pudmini, and the elephant with the rope-galls, and there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to show where the others had gone.",morning break sheet pale yellow green hill booming stop first ray light order little get ringing head shift position be elephant sight elephant rope gall be sign rustle whisper hillside show other go 
71,"Little Toomai stared again and again. The clearing, as he remembered it, had grown in the night. More trees stood in the middle of it, but the undergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back. Little Toomai stared once more. Now he understood the trampling. The elephants had stamped out more room--had stamped the thick grass and juicy cane to trash, the trash into slivers, the slivers into tiny fibers, and the fibers into hard earth.",little stare clear remember grow night more tree stand middle undergrowth jungle grass side roll little stare more understand trampling elephant stamp more room stamp thick grass juicy cane trash trash sliver sliver tiny fiber fiber hard earth 
72,"“Wah!” said Little Toomai, and his eyes were very heavy. “Kala Nag, my lord, let us keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib’s camp, or I shall drop from thy neck.”",say little eye heavy lord let keep go camp drop neck 
73,"The third elephant watched the two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and took his own path. He may have belonged to some little native king’s establishment, fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away.",third elephant watch go snort wheel take own path belong little native king establishment mile 
74,"Two hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his elephants, who had been double chained that night, began to trumpet, and Pudmini, mired to the shoulders, with Kala Nag, very footsore, shambled into the camp. Little Toomai’s face was gray and pinched, and his hair was full of leaves and drenched with dew, but he tried to salute Petersen Sahib, and cried faintly: “The dance--the elephant dance! I have seen it, and--I die!” As Kala Nag sat down, he slid off his neck in a dead faint.",hour eat early breakfast elephant double chain night begin trumpet mire shoulder footsore shamble camp little face gray pinch hair full leave drench dew try salute cry dance elephant dance see die sit slide neck dead faint 
75,"But, since native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two hours he was lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahib’s hammock with Petersen Sahib’s shooting-coat under his head, and a glass of warm milk, a little brandy, with a dash of quinine, inside of him, and while the old hairy, scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him, looking at him as though he were a spirit, he told his tale in short words, as a child will, and wound up with:",native child have nerve worth speak hour lie hammock shooting coat head glass warm milk little brandy dash quinine old hairy scarred hunter jungle sit deep look spirit tell tale short word child wind 
76,"“Now, if I lie in one word, send men to see, and they will find that the elephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room, and they will find ten and ten, and many times ten, tracks leading to that dance-room.

Also Kala Nag is very leg-weary!”",lie word send man see find elephant folk trample more room dance room find many time track lead dance room make more room foot see take see leg weary 
77,"Little Toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into the twilight, and while he slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed the track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills. Petersen Sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he had only once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa had no need to look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there, or to scratch with his toe in the packed, rammed earth.",little lay sleep long afternoon twilight sleep follow track elephant mile hill spend year catching elephant find dance place have need look clear see do scratch toe packed ramm earth 
78,"“The child speaks truth,” said he. “All this was done last night, and I have counted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where Pudmini’s leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was there too.”",child speak truth say do last night count track cross river see leg iron cut bark tree 
79,"They looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the ways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to fathom.",look wonder way elephant wit man black white fathom 
80,"“Forty years and five,” said Machua Appa, “have I followed my lord, the elephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what this child has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is--what can we say?” and he shook his head.",year say follow lord elephant hear child man see child see say shake head 
81,"When they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. Petersen Sahib ate alone in his tent, but he gave orders that the camp should have two sheep and some fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and rice and salt, for he knew that there would be a feast.",get camp time evening meal eat tent give order camp have sheep fowl double ration flour rice salt know be feast 
82,"Big Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for his son and his elephant, and now that he had found them he looked at them as though he were afraid of them both. And there was a feast by the blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants, and Little Toomai was the hero of it all. And the big brown elephant catchers, the trackers and drivers and ropers, and the men who know all the secrets of breaking the wildest elephants, passed him from one to the other, and they marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a newly killed jungle-cock, to show that he was a forester, initiated and free of all the jungles.",big come hotfoot camp plain search son elephant find look afraid be feast blaze campfire front line picket elephant little hero big brown elephant catcher tracker driver roper man know secret break wild elephant pass other mark forehead blood breast kill jungle cock show forester initiate free jungle 
83,"And at last, when the flames died down, and the red light of the logs made the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too, Machua Appa, the head of all the drivers of all the Keddahs--Machua Appa, Petersen Sahib’s other self, who had never seen a made road in forty years: Machua Appa, who was so great that he had no other name than Machua Appa,--leaped to his feet, with Little Toomai held high in the air above his head, and shouted: “Listen, my brothers. Listen, too, you my lords in the lines there, for I, Machua Appa, am speaking! This little one shall no more be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of the Elephants, as his great-grandfather was called before him. What never man has seen he has seen through the long night, and the favor of the elephant-folk and of the Gods of the Jungles is with him. He shall become a great tracker. He shall become greater than I, even I, Machua Appa! He shall follow the new trail, and the stale trail, and the mixed trail, with a clear eye! He shall take no harm in the Keddah when he runs under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers; and if he slips before the feet of the charging bull elephant, the bull elephant shall know who he is and shall not crush him. Aihai! my lords in the chains,”--he whirled up the line of pickets--“here is the little one that has seen your dances in your hidden places,--the sight that never man saw! Give him honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my children. Make your salute to Toomai of the Elephants! Gunga Pershad, ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi Guj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa!
