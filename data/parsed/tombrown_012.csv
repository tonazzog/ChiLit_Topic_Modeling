He’s called Madman, you know. And never was such a fellow for getting all sorts of rum things about him.

8,"“Well, he’s great fun, I can tell you,” said Tom, throwing himself back on the sofa, and chuckling at the remembrance. “We had such a game with him one day last half. He had been kicking up horrid stinks for some time in his study, till I suppose some fellow told Mary, and she told the Doctor. Anyhow, one day a little before dinner, when he came down from the library, the Doctor, instead of going home, came striding into the hall. East and I and five or six other fellows were at the fire, and preciously we stared, for he don’t come in like that once a year, unless it is a wet day and there’s a fight in the hall. ‘East,’ says he, ‘just come and show me Martin’s study.’ ‘Oh, here’s a game,’ whispered the rest of us; and we all cut upstairs after the Doctor, East leading. As we got into the New Row, which was hardly wide enough to hold the Doctor and his gown, click, click, click, we heard in the old Madman’s den. Then that stopped all of a sudden, and the bolts went to like fun. The Madman knew East’s step, and thought there was going to be a siege.",great fun tell say throw sofa chuckle remembrance have game day last half kick horrid stink time study suppose fellow tell tell day little dinner come library go come strid hall other fellow fire stare come year wet day be fight hall say come show study game whisper rest cut lead get new wide hold gown click click click hear old dan stop sudden bolt go fun know step think go be siege

The old magpie was standing on the window-sill, all his feathers drooping, and looking disgusted and half-poisoned.",bolt go door open be old standing look precious scared jacket shirt sleeve elbow long skinny arm cover anchor arrow letter tattooe gunpowder sailor boy’ stink fit knock come do stand ground look arm hold nose tight old magpie stand window sill feather droop look disgusted half poison

12,"“‘Please, sir, I was only mixing up this powder; there isn’t any harm in it. And the Madman seized nervously on his pestle and mortar, to show the Doctor the harmlessness of his pursuits, and went on pounding--click, click, click. He hadn’t given six clicks before, puff! up went the whole into a great blaze, away went the pestle and mortar across the study, and back we tumbled into the passage. The magpie fluttered down into the court, swearing, and the Madman danced out, howling, with his fingers in his mouth. The Doctor caught hold of him, and called to us to fetch some water. ‘There, you silly fellow,’ said he, quite pleased, though, to find he wasn’t much hurt, ‘you see you don’t know the least what you’re doing with all these things; and now, mind, you must give up practising chemistry by yourself.’ Then he took hold of his arm and looked at it, and I saw he had to bite his lip, and his eyes twinkled; but he said, quite grave, ‘Here, you see, you’ve been making all these foolish marks on yourself, which you can never get out, and you’ll be very sorry for it in a year or two. Now come down to the housekeeper’s room, and let us see if you are hurt.’ And away went the two, and we all stayed and had a regular turn-out of the den, till Martin came back with his hand bandaged and turned us out. However, I’ll go and see what he’s after, and tell him to come in after prayers to supper.” And away went Tom to find the boy in question, who dwelt in a little study by himself, in New Row.",sir mix powder be harm seize pestle mortar show harmlessness pursuit go pounding click click click give click puff go whole great blaze go pestle mortar study tumble passage magpie flutter court swear dance howl finger mouth catch hold call fetch water silly fellow say pleased find hurt see know least do thing mind give practise chemistry take hold arm look see have bite lip eye twinkle say grave see make foolish mark get sorry year come housekeeper room let see hurt go stay have regular turn dan come hand bandage turn go see tell come prayer supper go find boy question dwele little study new 
13,"The aforesaid Martin, whom Arthur had taken such a fancy for, was one of those unfortunates who were at that time of day (and are, I fear, still) quite out of their places at a public school. If we knew how to use our boys, Martin would have been seized upon and educated as a natural philosopher. He had a passion for birds, beasts, and insects, and knew more of them and their habits than any one in Rugby--except perhaps the Doctor, who knew everything. He was also an experimental chemist on a small scale, and had made unto himself an electric machine, from which it was his greatest pleasure and glory to administer small shocks to any small boys who were rash enough to venture into his study. And this was by no means an adventure free from excitement; for besides the probability of a snake dropping on to your head or twining lovingly up your leg, or a rat getting into your breeches-pocket in search of food, there was the animal and chemical odour to be faced, which always hung about the den, and the chance of being blown up in some of the many experiments which Martin was always trying, with the most wondrous results in the shape of explosions and smells that mortal boy ever heard of. Of course, poor Martin, in consequence of his pursuits, had become an Ishmaelite in the house. In the first place, he half-poisoned all his neighbours, and they in turn were always on the lookout to pounce upon any of his numerous live-stock, and drive him frantic by enticing his pet old magpie out of his window into a neighbouring study, and making the disreputable old bird drunk on toast soaked in beer and sugar. Then Martin, for his sins, inhabited a study looking into a small court some ten feet across, the window of which was completely commanded by those of the studies opposite in the Sick-room Row, these latter being at a slightly higher elevation. East, and another boy of an equally tormenting and ingenious turn of mind, now lived exactly opposite, and had expended huge pains and time in the preparation of instruments of annoyance for the behoof of Martin and his live colony. One morning an old basket made its appearance, suspended by a short cord outside Martin’s window, in which were deposited an amateur nest containing four young hungry jackdaws, the pride and glory of Martin’s life, for the time being, and which he was currently asserted to have hatched upon his own person. Early in the morning and late at night he was to be seen half out of window, administering to the varied wants of his callow brood. After deep cogitation, East and his chum had spliced a knife on to the end of a fishing-rod; and having watched Martin out, had, after half an hour’s severe sawing, cut the string by which the basket was suspended, and tumbled it on to the pavement below, with hideous remonstrance from the occupants. Poor Martin, returning from his short absence, collected the fragments and replaced his brood (except one whose neck had been broken in the descent) in their old location, suspending them this time by string and wire twisted together, defiant of any sharp instrument which his persecutors could command. But, like the Russian engineers at Sebastopol, East and his chum had an answer for every move of the adversary, and the next day had mounted a gun in the shape of a pea-shooter upon the ledge of their window, trained so as to bear exactly upon the spot which Martin had to occupy while tending his nurslings. The moment he began to feed they began to shoot. In vain did the enemy himself invest in a pea-shooter, and endeavour to answer the fire while he fed the young birds with his other hand; his attention was divided, and his shots flew wild, while every one of theirs told on his face and hands, and drove him into howlings and imprecations. He had been driven to ensconce the nest in a corner of his already too-well-filled den.",aforesaid take fancy unfortunate time day fear place public school know use boy seize educate natural philosopher have passion bird beast insect know more habit one know experimental chemist small scale make electric machine great pleasure glory administer small shock small boy rash venture study mean adventure free excitement probability snake drop head twin leg rat get breeche pocket search food be animal chemical odour face hang dan chance blow many experiment try wondrous result shape explosion smell mortal boy hear course poor consequence pursuit become house first place half poison neighbour turn lookout pounce numerous live stock drive frantic entice pet old magpie window neighbour study make disreputable old bird drunk toast soak beer sugar sin inhabit study look small court foot window command study sick room latter high elevation boy torment ingenious turn mind live opposite expend huge pain time preparation instrument annoyance behoof live colony morning old basket make appearance suspend short cord window deposit amateur nest contain young hungry jackdaw pride glory life time being assert hatch own person morning night see half window administer varied want callow brood deep cogitation chum splice knife end fishing rod watch hour severe sawing cut string basket suspend tumble pavement hideous remonstrance occupant poor return short absence collect fragment replace brood neck break descent old location suspend time string wire twist defiant sharp instrument persecutor command russian engineer chum have answer move adversary next day mount gun shape pea-shooter ledge window train bear spot have occupy tend nursling moment begin feed begin shoot vain enemy invest pea- shooter endeavour answer fire feed young bird other hand attention divide shot fly wild one tell face hand drive howling imprecation drive ensconce nest corner fill dan 
14,"His door was barricaded by a set of ingenious bolts of his own invention, for the sieges were frequent by the neighbours when any unusually ambrosial odour spread itself from the den to the neighbouring studies. The door panels were in a normal state of smash, but the frame of the door resisted all besiegers, and behind it the owner carried on his varied pursuits--much in the same state of mind, I should fancy, as a border-farmer lived in, in the days of the moss-troopers, when his hold might be summoned or his cattle carried off at any minute of night or day.",door barricade set ingenious bolt own invention siege frequent neighbour ambrosial odour spread dan neighbour study door panel normal state smash frame door resist besieger owner carry varied pursuit much same state mind fancy border farmer live day moss trooper hold summon cattle carry minute night day

16,"“Oh, very well; stop a moment.” One bolt went back. “You’re sure East isn’t there?”",stop moment bolt go sure 
17,"“No, no; hang it, open.” Tom gave a kick, the other bolt creaked, and he entered the den.",hang open give kick other bolt creak enter dan 
18,"Den indeed it was--about five feet six inches long by five wide, and seven feet high. About six tattered school-books, and a few chemical books, Taxidermy, Stanley on Birds, and an odd volume of Bewick, the latter in much better preservation, occupied the top shelves. The other shelves, where they had not been cut away and used by the owner for other purposes, were fitted up for the abiding-places of birds, beasts, and reptiles. There was no attempt at carpet or curtain. The table was entirely occupied by the great work of Martin, the electric machine, which was covered carefully with the remains of his table-cloth. The jackdaw cage occupied one wall; and the other was adorned by a small hatchet, a pair of climbing irons, and his tin candle-box, in which he was for the time being endeavouring to raise a hopeful young family of field-mice. As nothing should be let to lie useless, it was well that the candle-box was thus occupied, for candles Martin never had. A pound was issued to him weekly, as to the other boys; but as candles were available capital, and easily exchangeable for birds’ eggs or young birds, Martin’s pound invariably found its way in a few hours to Howlett’s the bird-fancier’s, in the Bilton road, who would give a hawk’s or nightingale’s egg or young linnet in exchange. Martin’s ingenuity was therefore for ever on the rack to supply himself with a light. Just now he had hit upon a grand invention, and the den was lighted by a flaring cotton wick issuing from a ginger-beer bottle full of some doleful composition. When light altogether failed him, Martin would loaf about by the fires in the passages or hall, after the manner of Diggs, and try to do his verses or learn his lines by the firelight.",foot inch wide foot high tatter school book few chemical book odd volume latter good preservation occupy top shelf other shelf cut use owner other purpose fit abide place bird beast reptile be attempt carpet curtain table occupy great work electric machine cover remains table cloth jackdaw cage occupy wall other adorn small hatchet pair climb iron tin candle box time endeavour raise hopeful young family field mouse let lie useless candle box occupy candle have pound issue other boy candle available capital exchangeable bird egg young bird pound find way few hour bird fancier road give hawk nightingale egg young linnet exchange ingenuity rack supply light hit grand invention dan light flare cotton wick issuing ginger beer bottle full doleful composition light fail loaf fire passage hall manner try do verse learn line firelight 
19,"“Well, old boy, you haven’t got any sweeter in the den this half. How that stuff in the bottle stinks! Never mind; I ain’t going to stop; but you come up after prayers to our study.

20,"Martin was evidently highly pleased at the invitation, and promised to be up without fail.",pleased invitation promise fail 
21,"As soon as prayers were over, and the sixth and fifth form boys had withdrawn to the aristocratic seclusion of their own room, and the rest, or democracy, had sat down to their supper in the hall, Tom and Arthur, having secured their allowances of bread and cheese, started on their feet to catch the eye of the praepostor of the week, who remained in charge during supper, walking up and down the hall. He happened to be an easy-going fellow, so they got a pleasant nod to their “Please may I go out?” and away they scrambled to prepare for Martin a sumptuous banquet. This Tom had insisted on, for he was in great delight on the occasion, the reason of which delight must be expounded. The fact was that this was the first attempt at a friendship of his own which Arthur had made, and Tom hailed it as a grand step. The ease with which he himself became hail-fellow-well-met with anybody, and blundered into and out of twenty friendships a half-year, made him sometimes sorry and sometimes angry at Arthur’s reserve and loneliness. True, Arthur was always pleasant, and even jolly, with any boys who came with Tom to their study; but Tom felt that it was only through him, as it were, that his chum associated with others, and that but for him Arthur would have been dwelling in a wilderness. This increased his consciousness of responsibility; and though he hadn’t reasoned it out and made it clear to himself yet somehow he knew that this responsibility, this trust which he had taken on him without thinking about it, head over heels in fact, was the centre and turning-point of his school-life, that which was to make him or mar him, his appointed work and trial for the time being. And Tom was becoming a new boy, though with frequent tumbles in the dirt and perpetual hard battle with himself, and was daily growing in manfulness and thoughtfulness, as every high-couraged and well-principled boy must, when he finds himself for the first time consciously at grips with self and the devil. Already he could turn almost without a sigh from the School-gates, from which had just scampered off East and three or four others of his own particular set, bound for some jolly lark not quite according to law, and involving probably a row with louts, keepers, or farm-labourers, the skipping dinner or calling-over, some of Phoebe Jennings’s beer, and a very possible flogging at the end of all as a relish. He had quite got over the stage in which he would grumble to himself--“Well, hang it, it’s very hard of the Doctor to have saddled me with Arthur. Why couldn’t he have chummed him with Fogey, or Thomkin, or any of the fellows who never do anything but walk round the close, and finish their copies the first day they’re set?” But although all this was past, he longed, and felt that he was right in longing, for more time for the legitimate pastimes of cricket, fives, bathing, and fishing, within bounds, in which Arthur could not yet be his companion; and he felt that when the “young un” (as he now generally called him) had found a pursuit and some other friend for himself, he should be able to give more time to the education of his own body with a clear conscience.",prayer sixth fifth form boy withdraw aristocratic seclusion own room rest democracy sit supper hall secure allowance bread cheese start foot catch eye praepostor week remain charge supper walk hall happen easy go fellow get pleasant nod go scramble prepare sumptuous banquet insist great delight occasion reason delight expound fact first attempt friendship own make hail grand step ease become hail fellow meet blunder friendship half year make sorry angry reserve loneliness true pleasant jolly boy come study feel chum associate other dwelling wilderness increase consciousness responsibility reason make clear know responsibility trust take think head heel fact centre turning point school life make make appoint work trial time being become new boy frequent tumble dirt perpetual hard battle daily grow manfulness thoughtfulness high couraged principled boy find first time grip self devil turn sigh gate scamper other own particular set bind jolly lark accord law involve row lout keeper farm labourer skip dinner calling beer possible flog end relish get stage grumble hang hard saddle chumme fellow do walk close finish copy first day set past long feel right longing more time legitimate pastime cricket fives bathing fishing bound companion feel young un call find pursuit other friend able give more time education own body clear conscience 
22,"And now what he so wished for had come to pass; he almost hailed it as a special providence (as indeed it was, but not for the reasons he gave for it--what providences are?) that Arthur should have singled out Martin of all fellows for a friend. “The old Madman is the very fellow,”  thought he; “he will take him scrambling over half the country after birds’ eggs and flowers, make him run and swim and climb like an Indian, and not teach him a word of anything bad, or keep him from his lessons. What luck!” And so, with more than his usual heartiness, he dived into his cupboard, and hauled out an old knuckle-bone of ham, and two or three bottles of beer, together with the solemn pewter only used on state occasions; while Arthur, equally elated at the easy accomplishment of his first act of volition in the joint establishment, produced from his side a bottle of pickles and a pot of jam, and cleared the table. In a minute or two the noise of the boys coming up from supper was heard, and Martin knocked and was admitted, bearing his bread and cheese; and the three fell to with hearty good-will upon the viands, talking faster than they ate, for all shyness disappeared in a moment before Tom’s bottled-beer and hospitable ways. “Here’s Arthur, a regular young town-mouse, with a natural taste for the woods, Martin, longing to break his neck climbing trees, and with a passion for young snakes.”",wish come pass hail special providence reason give providence single fellow friend old very fellow think take scramble country bird egg flower make run swim climb teach word bad keep lesson luck more usual heartiness dive cupboard haul old knuckle bone ham bottle beer solemn pewter use state occasion elated easy accomplishment first act volition joint establishment produce side bottle pickle pot jam clear table minute noise boy come supper hear knock admit bear bread cheese fall hearty good viand talk fast eat shyness disappear moment bottled beer hospitable way regular young town mouse natural taste wood long break neck climb tree passion young snake 
23,"“Well, I say,” sputtered out Martin eagerly, “will you come to-morrow, both of you, to Caldecott’s Spinney then? for I know of a kestrel’s nest, up a fir-tree. I can’t get at it without help; and, Brown, you can climb against any one.”",say sputter come know kestrel nest fir tree get help climb one

26,"“Ay, the old Madman has got the best collection in the house, out and out,” said Tom; and then Martin, warming with unaccustomed good cheer and the chance of a convert, launched out into a proposed bird-nesting campaign, betraying all manner of important secrets--a golden-crested wren’s nest near Butlin’s Mound, a moor-hen who was sitting on nine eggs in a pond down the Barby road, and a kingfisher’s nest in a corner of the old canal above Brownsover Mill. He had heard, he said, that no one had ever got a kingfisher’s nest out perfect, and that the British Museum, or the Government, or somebody, had offered 100 pounds to any one who could bring them a nest and eggs not damaged. In the middle of which astounding announcement, to which the others were listening with open ears, and already considering the application of the 100 pounds, a knock came to the door, and East’s voice was heard craving admittance.",old get good collection house say warm unaccustomed good cheer chance convert launch propose bird nest campaign betray manner important secret golden crest wren nest moor hen sit egg pond road kingfisher nest corner old canal hear say get kingfisher nest perfect british offer pound one bring nest egg damage middle astounding announcement other listen open ear consider application pound knock come door voice hear craving admittance

28,"The fact was, that Tom’s heart had already smitten him for not asking his fidus Achates to the feast, although only an extempore affair; and though prudence and the desire to get Martin and Arthur together alone at first had overcome his scruples, he was now heartily glad to open the door, broach another bottle of beer, and hand over the old ham-knuckle to the searching of his old friend’s pocket-knife.",fact heart smite ask fidus feast extempore affair prudence desire get first overcome scruple glad open door broach bottle beer hand old ham knuckle searching old friend pocket knife 
29,"“Ah, you greedy vagabonds,” said East, with his mouth full, “I knew there was something going on when I saw you cut off out of hall so quick with your suppers. What a stunning tap, Tom! You are a wunner for bottling the swipes.”",greedy vagabond say mouth full know be go see cut hall supper stunning tap wunner bottle swipe

32,"“There’ll be no young rooks fit for pies for a month yet; shows how much you know about it,” rejoined Martin, who, though very good friends with East, regarded him with considerable suspicion for his propensity to practical jokes.",young rook fit pie month show much know rejoin good friend regard considerable suspicion propensity practical joke 
33,"“Scud knows nothing and cares for nothing but grub and mischief,” said Tom; “but young rook pie, specially when you’ve had to climb for them, is very pretty eating.--However, I say, Scud, we’re all going after a hawk’s nest to-morrow, in Caldecott’s Spinney; and if you’ll come and behave yourself, we’ll have a stunning climb.”",know care grub mischief say young rook pie have climb eat say go hawk nest come behave have stunning climb

37,"And the bottled-beer being finished, and his hunger appeased, East departed to his study, “that sneak Jones,” as he informed them, who had just got into the sixth, and occupied the next study, having instituted a nightly visitation upon East and his chum, to their no small discomfort.",bottled beer finish hunger appease depart study sneak inform get sixth occupy next study institute nightly visitation chum small discomfort 
38,"When he was gone Martin rose to follow, but Tom stopped him. “No one goes near New Row,” said he, “so you may just as well stop here and do your verses, and then we’ll have some more talk. We’ll be no end quiet. Besides, no praepostor comes here now. We haven’t been visited once this half.”",go rise follow stop go new say stop do verse have more talk end quiet praepostor come visit half 
39,"So the table was cleared, the cloth restored, and the three fell to work with Gradus and dictionary upon the morning’s vulgus.",table clear cloth restore fall work dictionary morning vulgus 
40,"They were three very fair examples of the way in which such tasks were done at Rugby, in the consulship of Plancus. And doubtless the method is little changed, for there is nothing new under the sun, especially at schools.",fair example way such task do consulship method change be new sun school 
41,"Now be it known unto all you boys who are at schools which do not rejoice in the time-honoured institution of the vulgus (commonly supposed to have been established by William of Wykeham at Winchester, and imported to Rugby by Arnold more for the sake of the lines which were learnt by heart with it than for its own intrinsic value, as I’ve always understood), that it is a short exercise in Greek or Latin verse, on a given subject, the minimum number of lines being fixed for each form.",know boy school rejoice time honoure institution vulgus suppose establish import sake line learn heart own intrinsic value understand short exercise greek latin verse give subject minimum number line fix form 
42,"The master of the form gave out at fourth lesson on the previous day the subject for next morning’s vulgus, and at first lesson each boy had to bring his vulgus ready to be looked over; and with the vulgus, a certain number of lines from one of the Latin or Greek poets then being construed in the form had to be got by heart. The master at first lesson called up each boy in the form in order, and put him on in the lines. If he couldn’t say them, or seem to say them, by reading them off the master’s or some other boy’s book who stood near, he was sent back, and went below all the boys who did so say or seem to say them; but in either case his vulgus was looked over by the master, who gave and entered in his book, to the credit or discredit of the boy, so many marks as the composition merited. At Rugby vulgus and lines were the first lesson every other day in the week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays; and as there were thirty-eight weeks in the school year, it is obvious to the meanest capacity that the master of each form had to set one hundred and fourteen subjects every year, two hundred and twenty-eight every two years, and so on. Now, to persons of moderate invention this was a considerable task, and human nature being prone to repeat itself, it will not be wondered that the masters gave the same subjects sometimes over again after a certain lapse of time. To meet and rebuke this bad habit of the masters, the schoolboy mind, with its accustomed ingenuity, had invented an elaborate system of tradition. Almost every boy kept his own vulgus written out in a book, and these books were duly handed down from boy to boy, till (if the tradition has gone on till now) I suppose the popular boys, in whose hands bequeathed vulgus-books have accumulated, are prepared with three or four vulguses on any subject in heaven or earth, or in “more worlds than one,” which an unfortunate master can pitch upon. At any rate, such lucky fellows had generally one for themselves and one for a friend in my time. The only objection to the traditionary method of doing your vulguses was the risk that the successions might have become confused, and so that you and another follower of traditions should show up the same identical vulgus some fine morning; in which case, when it happened, considerable grief was the result. But when did such risk hinder boys or men from short cuts and pleasant paths?",master form give fourth lesson previous day subject next morning vulgus first lesson boy have bring vulgus ready look vulgus certain number line latin greek poet construe form have get heart master first lesson call boy form order put line say seem say read master other boy book stand send go boy say seem say case vulgus look master give enter book credit discredit boy many mark composition merite vulgus line first lesson other day week be week school year obvious mean capacity master form have set subject year year person moderate invention considerable task human nature prone repeat wonder master give same subject certain lapse time meet rebuke bad habit master schoolboy mind accustom ingenuity invent elaborate system tradition boy keep own vulgus write book book hand boy boy tradition go suppose popular boy hand bequeath vulgus book accumulate prepare vulguse subject heaven earth more world unfortunate master pitch rate such lucky fellow have friend time only objection traditionary method do vulguse risk succession become confused follower tradition show same identical vulgus fine morning case happen considerable grief result such risk hinder boy man short cut pleasant path 
43,"Now in the study that night Tom was the upholder of the traditionary method of vulgus doing. He carefully produced two large vulgus-books, and began diving into them, and picking out a line here, and an ending there (tags, as they were vulgarly called), till he had gotten all that he thought he could make fit. He then proceeded to patch his tags together with the help of his Gradus, producing an incongruous and feeble result of eight elegiac lines, the minimum quantity for his form, and finishing up with two highly moral lines extra, making ten in all, which he cribbed entire from one of his books, beginning “O genus humanum,” and which he himself must have used a dozen times before, whenever an unfortunate or wicked hero, of whatever nation or language under the sun, was the subject. Indeed he began to have great doubts whether the master wouldn’t remember them, and so only throw them in as extra lines, because in any case they would call off attention from the other tags, and if detected, being extra lines, he wouldn’t be sent back to do more in their place, while if they passed muster again he would get marks for them.",study night upholder traditionary method vulgus do produce large vulgus book begin diving pick line ending tag call get think make fit proceed patch tag help produce incongruous feeble result elegiac line minimum quantity form finish moral line extra make cribb entire book begin o genus humanum use time unfortunate wicked hero nation language sun subject begin have great doubt master remember throw extra line case call attention other tag detect extra line send do more place pass muster get mark 
44,"The second method, pursued by Martin, may be called the dogged or prosaic method. He, no more than Tom, took any pleasure in the task, but having no old vulgus-books of his own, or any one’s else, could not follow the traditionary method, for which too, as Tom remarked, he hadn’t the genius. Martin then proceeded to write down eight lines in English, of the most matter-of-fact kind, the first that came into his head; and to convert these, line by line, by main force of Gradus and dictionary into Latin that would scan. This was all he cared for--to produce eight lines with no false quantities or concords: whether the words were apt, or what the sense was, mattered nothing; and as the article was all new, not a line beyond the minimum did the followers of the dogged method ever produce.",second method pursue call dogg prosaic method more take pleasure task have old vulgus book own one else follow traditionary method remark genius proceed write line matter fact kind first come head convert line line main force dictionary scan care produce line false quantity concord word apt sense matter article new line minimum do follower dogg method produce 
45,"The third, or artistic method, was Arthur’s. He considered first what point in the character or event which was the subject could most neatly be brought out within the limits of a vulgus, trying always to get his idea into the eight lines, but not binding himself to ten or even twelve lines if he couldn’t do this. He then set to work as much as possible without Gradus or other help, to clothe his idea in appropriate Latin or Greek, and would not be satisfied till he had polished it well up with the aptest and most poetic words and phrases he could get at.",third artistic method consider first point character event subject bring limit vulgus try get idea line bind line do set work much possible other help clothe idea appropriate latin satisfy polished aptest poetic word phrase get 
46,"A fourth method, indeed, was used in the school, but of too simple a kind to require a comment. It may be called the vicarious method, obtained amongst big boys of lazy or bullying habits, and consisted simply in making clever boys whom they could thrash do their whole vulgus for them, and construe it to them afterwards; which latter is a method not to be encouraged, and which I strongly advise you all not to practise. Of the others, you will find the traditionary most troublesome, unless you can steal your vulguses whole (experto crede), and that the artistic method pays the best both in marks and other ways.",fourth method use school simple kind require comment call vicarious method obtain big boy lazy bullying habit consist make clever boy thrash do whole vulgus construe latter method encourage advise practise other find traditionary troublesome steal vulguse whole experto crede artistic method pay good mark other way 
47,"The vulguses being finished by nine o’clock, and Martin having rejoiced above measure in the abundance of light, and of Gradus and dictionary, and other conveniences almost unknown to him for getting through the work, and having been pressed by Arthur to come and do his verses there whenever he liked, the three boys went down to Martin’s den, and Arthur was initiated into the lore of birds’ eggs, to his great delight. The exquisite colouring and forms astonished and charmed him, who had scarcely ever seen any but a hen’s egg or an ostrich’s, and by the time he was lugged away to bed he had learned the names of at least twenty sorts, and dreamed of the glorious perils of tree-climbing, and that he had found a roc’s egg in the island as big as Sinbad’s, and clouded like a tit-lark’s, in blowing which Martin and he had nearly been drowned in the yolk.",vulguse finish o'clock rejoice measure abundance light dictionary other convenience unknown get work press come do verse like boy go dan initiate lore bird egg great delight exquisite colouring form astonished charm see hen egg ostrich time lugge bed learn name least sort dream glorious peril tree climb find roc egg island big cloude tit lark blowing drown yolk
