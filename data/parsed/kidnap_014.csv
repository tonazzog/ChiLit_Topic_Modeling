1,CHAPTER XIII. THE LOSS OF THE BRIG,loss brig 
2,"It was already late at night, and as dark as it ever would be at that season of the year (and that is to say, it was still pretty bright), when Hoseason clapped his head into the round-house door.",late night dark season year say bright clapp head round house door 
3,"“Here,” said he, “come out and see if ye can pilot.”",say come see pilot 
4,“Is this one of your tricks?” asked Alan.,trick ask 
5,“Do I look like tricks?” cries the captain. “I have other things to think of--my brig’s in danger!”,look trick cry captain have other thing think brig danger 
6,"By the concerned look of his face, and, above all, by the sharp tones in which he spoke of his brig, it was plain to both of us he was in deadly earnest; and so Alan and I, with no great fear of treachery, stepped on deck.",concerned look face sharp tone speak brig plain deadly earnest great fear treachery step deck 
7,"The sky was clear; it blew hard, and was bitter cold; a great deal of daylight lingered; and the moon, which was nearly full, shone brightly. The brig was close hauled, so as to round the southwest corner of the Island of Mull, the hills of which (and Ben More above them all, with a wisp of mist upon the top of it) lay full upon the lar-board bow. Though it was no good point of sailing for the Covenant, she tore through the seas at a great rate, pitching and straining, and pursued by the westerly swell.",sky clear blow bitter cold great deal daylight linger moon full shine brig close haul corner hill more wisp mist top lay full lar board bow good point sailing tore sea great rate pitching straining pursue westerly swell 
8,"Altogether it was no such ill night to keep the seas in; and I had begun to wonder what it was that sat so heavily upon the captain, when the brig rising suddenly on the top of a high swell, he pointed and cried to us to look. Away on the lee bow, a thing like a fountain rose out of the moonlit sea, and immediately after we heard a low sound of roaring.",such ill night keep sea begin wonder sit captain brig rise top high swell point cry look bow thing fountain rise moonlit sea hear low sound roaring 
9,"“What do ye call that?” asked the captain, gloomily.",call ask captain 
10,"“The sea breaking on a reef,” said Alan. “And now ye ken where it is; and what better would ye have?”",sea break reef say good have 
11,"“Ay,” said Hoseason, “if it was the only one.”",say only one 
12,"And sure enough, just as he spoke there came a second fountain farther to the south.",speak come second fountain south 
13,"“There!” said Hoseason. “Ye see for yourself. If I had kent of these reefs, if I had had a chart, or if Shuan had been spared, it’s not sixty guineas, no, nor six hundred, would have made me risk my brig in sic a stoneyard! But you, sir, that was to pilot us, have ye never a word?”",say see have kent reef have chart spare guinea make risk brig sic stoneyard sir pilot word 
14,"“I’m thinking,” said Alan, “these’ll be what they call the Torran Rocks.”",think say call 
15,“Are there many of them?” says the captain.,be many say captain 
16,"“Truly, sir, I am nae pilot,” said Alan; “but it sticks in my mind there are ten miles of them.”",sir pilot say stick mind be mile 
17,Mr. Riach and the captain looked at each other.,captain look other 
18,"“There’s a way through them, I suppose?” said the captain.",be way suppose say captain 
19,"“Doubtless,” said Alan, “but where? But it somehow runs in my mind once more that it is clearer under the land.”",say run mind more clear land 
20,"“So?” said Hoseason. “We’ll have to haul our wind then, Mr. Riach; we’ll have to come as near in about the end of Mull as we can take her, sir; and even then we’ll have the land to kep the wind off us, and that stoneyard on our lee. Well, we’re in for it now, and may as well crack on.”",say have haul wind have come end take sir have land kep wind stoneyard crack 
21,"With that he gave an order to the steersman, and sent Riach to the foretop. There were only five men on deck, counting the officers; these being all that were fit (or, at least, both fit and willing) for their work. So, as I say, it fell to Mr. Riach to go aloft, and he sat there looking out and hailing the deck with news of all he saw.",give order steersman send foretop be man deck count officer fit least fit willing work say fall go sit look hail deck news see 
22,"“The sea to the south is thick,” he cried; and then, after a while, “it does seem clearer in by the land.”",sea south thick cry while seem clear land 
23,"“Well, sir,” said Hoseason to Alan, “we’ll try your way of it. But I think I might as well trust to a blind fiddler. Pray God you’re right.”",sir say try way think trust blind fiddler pray right 
24,"“Pray God I am!” says Alan to me. “But where did I hear it? Well, well, it will be as it must.”",pray say hear 
25,"As we got nearer to the turn of the land the reefs began to be sown here and there on our very path; and Mr. Riach sometimes cried down to us to change the course. Sometimes, indeed, none too soon; for one reef was so close on the brig’s weather board that when a sea burst upon it the lighter sprays fell upon her deck and wetted us like rain.",get nearer turn land reef begin sow very path cry change course reef close brig weather board sea burst light spray fall deck wett rain 
26,"The brightness of the night showed us these perils as clearly as by day, which was, perhaps, the more alarming. It showed me, too, the face of the captain as he stood by the steersman, now on one foot, now on the other, and sometimes blowing in his hands, but still listening and looking and as steady as steel. Neither he nor Mr. Riach had shown well in the fighting; but I saw they were brave in their own trade, and admired them all the more because I found Alan very white.",brightness night show peril day alarming show face captain stand steersman foot other blow hand listen look steady steel show fighting see brave own trade admire more find white 
27,"“Ochone, David,” says he, “this is no the kind of death I fancy!”",say kind death fancy 
28,"“What, Alan!” I cried, “you’re not afraid?”",cry afraid 
29,"“No,” said he, wetting his lips, “but you’ll allow, yourself, it’s a cold ending.”",say wet lip allow cold ending 
30,"By this time, now and then sheering to one side or the other to avoid a reef, but still hugging the wind and the land, we had got round Iona and begun to come alongside Mull. The tide at the tail of the land ran very strong, and threw the brig about. Two hands were put to the helm, and Hoseason himself would sometimes lend a help; and it was strange to see three strong men throw their weight upon the tiller, and it (like a living thing) struggle against and drive them back. This would have been the greater danger had not the sea been for some while free of obstacles. Mr. Riach, besides, announced from the top that he saw clear water ahead.",time sheer side other avoid reef hug wind land get begin come tide tail land run strong throw brig hand put helm lend help strange see strong man throw weight tiller living thing struggle drive great danger sea free obstacle announce top see clear water 
31,"“Ye were right,” said Hoseason to Alan. “Ye have saved the brig, sir. I’ll mind that when we come to clear accounts.” And I believe he not only meant what he said, but would have done it; so high a place did the Covenant hold in his affections.",right say save brig sir mind come clear account believe mean say do high place hold affection 
32,"But this is matter only for conjecture, things having gone otherwise than he forecast.",matter conjecture thing go forecast 
33,"“Keep her away a point,” sings out Mr. Riach. “Reef to windward!”",keep point sing reef windward 
34,"And just at the same time the tide caught the brig, and threw the wind out of her sails. She came round into the wind like a top, and the next moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the deck, and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast.",same time tide catch brig throw wind sail come wind top next moment strike reef dunch throw flat deck come shake place mast 
35,"I was on my feet in a minute. The reef on which we had struck was close in under the southwest end of Mull, off a little isle they call Earraid, which lay low and black upon the larboard. Sometimes the swell broke clean over us; sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef, so that we could hear her beat herself to pieces; and what with the great noise of the sails, and the singing of the wind, and the flying of the spray in the moonlight, and the sense of danger, I think my head must have been partly turned, for I could scarcely understand the things I saw.",foot minute reef strike close end little isle call lay low black larboard swell break clean ground poor brig reef hear beat piece great noise sail singing wind fly spray moonlight sense danger think head turn understand thing see 
36,"Presently I observed Mr. Riach and the seamen busy round the skiff, and, still in the same blank, ran over to assist them; and as soon as I set my hand to work, my mind came clear again. It was no very easy task, for the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper, and the breaking of the heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on; but we all wrought like horses while we could.",observe seamen busy skiff same blank run assist set hand work mind come easy task skiff lay amidship full hamper breaking heavy sea force give hold wring horse 
37,Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the fore-scuttle and began to help; while the rest that lay helpless in their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved.,such wound move come clamber fore scuttle begin help rest lay helpless bunk harrow scream begg save 
38,"The captain took no part. It seemed he was struck stupid. He stood holding by the shrouds, talking to himself and groaning out aloud whenever the ship hammered on the rock. His brig was like wife and child to him; he had looked on, day by day, at the mishandling of poor Ransome; but when it came to the brig, he seemed to suffer along with her.",captain take part seem strike stupid stand hold shroud talk groan ship hammer rock brig wife child look day day mishandling poor come brig seem suffer 
39,"All the time of our working at the boat, I remember only one other thing: that I asked Alan, looking across at the shore, what country it was; and he answered, it was the worst possible for him, for it was a land of the Campbells.",time working boat remember other thing ask look shore country answer bad possible land 
40,"We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and cry us warning. Well, we had the boat about ready to be launched, when this man sang out pretty shrill: “For God’s sake, hold on!” We knew by his tone that it was something more than ordinary; and sure enough, there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted her over on her beam. Whether the cry came too late, or my hold was too weak, I know not; but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean over the bulwarks into the sea.",have wound man tell keep watch sea cry warning have boat ready launch man sing shrill sake hold know tone more ordinary follow sea huge lift brig cant beam cry come late hold weak know sudden tilting ship cast clean bulwark sea 
41,"I went down, and drank my fill, and then came up, and got a blink of the moon, and then down again. They say a man sinks a third time for good. I cannot be made like other folk, then; for I would not like to write how often I went down, or how often I came up again. All the while, I was being hurled along, and beaten upon and choked, and then swallowed whole; and the thing was so distracting to my wits, that I was neither sorry nor afraid.",go drink fill come get blink moon say man sink third time good make other folk like write go come while hurl beat choke swallow whole thing distracting wit sorry afraid 
42,"Presently, I found I was holding to a spar, which helped me somewhat. And then all of a sudden I was in quiet water, and began to come to myself.",find hold spar help quiet water begin come 
43,"It was the spare yard I had got hold of, and I was amazed to see how far I had travelled from the brig. I hailed her, indeed; but it was plain she was already out of cry. She was still holding together; but whether or not they had yet launched the boat, I was too far off and too low down to see.",spare yard get hold amazed see travel brig hail plain cry hold launch boat low see 
44,"While I was hailing the brig, I spied a tract of water lying between us where no great waves came, but which yet boiled white all over and bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles. Sometimes the whole tract swung to one side, like the tail of a live serpent; sometimes, for a glimpse, it would all disappear and then boil up again. What it was I had no guess, which for the time increased my fear of it; but I now know it must have been the roost or tide race, which had carried me away so fast and tumbled me about so cruelly, and at last, as if tired of that play, had flung out me and the spare yard upon its landward margin.",hail brig spy tract water lie great wave come boil white bristle moon ring bubble whole tract swing side tail live serpent glimpse disappear boil have guess time increase fear know roost tide race carry tumble last tired play flung spare yard landward margin 
45,"I now lay quite becalmed, and began to feel that a man can die of cold as well as of drowning. The shores of Earraid were close in; I could see in the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in the rocks.",lay becalm begin feel man die cold drown shore close see moonlight dot heather sparkling mica rock 
46,"“Well,” thought I to myself, “if I cannot get as far as that, it’s strange!”",think get strange 
47,"I had no skill of swimming, Essen Water being small in our neighbourhood; but when I laid hold upon the yard with both arms, and kicked out with both feet, I soon begun to find that I was moving. Hard work it was, and mortally slow; but in about an hour of kicking and splashing, I had got well in between the points of a sandy bay surrounded by low hills.",have skill swim small neighbourhood lay hold yard arm kick foot begin find move hard work slow hour kick splash get point sandy bay surround low hill 
48,"The sea was here quite quiet; there was no sound of any surf; the moon shone clear; and I thought in my heart I had never seen a place so desert and desolate. But it was dry land; and when at last it grew so shallow that I could leave the yard and wade ashore upon my feet, I cannot tell if I was more tired or more grateful. Both, at least, I was: tired as I never was before that night; and grateful to God as I trust I have been often, though never with more cause.",sea quiet be sound surf moon shine clear think heart see place desert desolate dry land last grow shallow leave yard wake foot tell tired grateful least tired night grateful trust more cause
