1,CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille,
2,"The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. ‘Same as if he had a bone in his throat,’ said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:--",sigh draw back flapper eye look try speak minute sob choke voice same have bone throat say set work shake punch back last recover voice tear run cheek go 
3,"‘You may not have lived much under the sea--’ (‘I haven’t,’ said Alice)--‘and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--’ (Alice began to say ‘I once tasted--’ but checked herself hastily, and said ‘No, never’) ‘--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!’",live sea say introduce lobster begin say taste check say have idea delightful thing lobster quadrille

37,"‘You’re wrong about the crumbs,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--’ here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--‘Tell her about the reason and all that,’ he said to the Gryphon.",wrong crumb say crumb wash sea have tail mouth reason yawn shut eye tell reason say 
38,"‘The reason is,’ said the Gryphon, ‘that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.’",reason say go lobster dance throw sea have fall long way get tail mouth get

58,"So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating ‘YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,’ to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said ‘That’s very curious.’",begin tell adventure time see white little nervous creature get close side open eye mouth wide gain courage go listener quiet get part repeat old father word come different draw long breath say curious

62,"‘How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!’ thought Alice; ‘I might as well be at school at once.’ However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--",creature order make repeat lesson think school get begin repeat head full know say word come queer 
63,"  ‘’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,   “You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose   Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.’",voice hear declare bake brown sugar hair duck eyelid nose trim belt button turn toe

77,"‘Yes, I think you’d better leave off,’ said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.",think leave say glad do

80,"The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:--",sigh begin voice choke sob sing
