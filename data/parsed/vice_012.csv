4," Very possibly Chawner's interference in Mr. Bultitude's private affairs has surprised others besides the victim of it; but the fact is that there was a most unfortunate misunderstanding between them from the very first, which prevented the one from seeing, the other from explaining, the real state of the case.",interference private affair surprise other victim fact be unfortunate misunderstanding very first prevent one see other explain real state case 
5,"Chawner, of course, no more guessed Paul's true name and nature than anyone else who had come in contact with him in his impenetrable disguise, and his motive for attempting to prevent an interview with the Doctor can only, I fear, be explained by another slight digression.",course guess true name nature else come contact impenetrable disguise motive attempt prevent interview fear explain slight digression 
6,"The Doctor, from a deep sense of his responsibility for the morals of those under his care, was perhaps a trifle over-anxious to clear his moral garden of every noxious weed, and too constant in his vigilant efforts to detect the growing shoot of evil from the moment it showed above the surface.",deep sense responsibility moral care trifle anxious clear moral garden noxious weed constant vigilant effort detect grow shoot evil moment show surface

8,"The theory was that every right-minded boy ought to feel himself in such a fiduciary position towards his master, that it became a positive duty to acquaint him with any delinquencies he might happen to observe among his fellows; and if, at the same time, he was oppressed by a secret burden on his own conscience, it was understood that he might hope that the joint revelation would go far to mitigate his own punishment.",theory right minded boy feel fiduciary position master become positive duty acquaint delinquency happen observe fellow same time oppress secret burden own conscience understand hope joint revelation go mitigate own punishment

10,"For myself, I am inclined to think that a schoolmaster will find it better in the long run, for both the character and morals of his school, if he is not too anxious to play the detective, and refrains from encouraging the more weak-minded or cowardly boys to save themselves by turning ""schoolmaster's evidence.""",inclined think schoolmaster find good long run character moral school anxious play detective refrain encourage weak minded cowardly boy save turn schoolmaster evidence

12,"There were boys, of course, who took a sturdier view of their own rights and duties, and despised the talebearers as they deserved; there were others, also, too timid and too dependent on the good opinion of others to risk the loss of it by becoming informers; but there were always one or two whose consciences were unequal to the burden of their neighbour's sin, and could only be relieved by frank and full confession.",be boy course take sturdy view own right duty despise talebearer deserve be other timid dependent good opinion other risk loss become informer be conscience unequal burden neighbour sin relieve frank full confession

14,"Chawner was the leader of this conscientious band; he revelled in the system.

16,"Having himself a tendency to acts of sly disobedience, he found it a congenial pastime to set the fashion from time to time in some one of the peccadilloes to which boyhood is prone, and to which the Doctor's somewhat restrictive code added a large number, and as soon as he saw a sufficient number of his companions satisfactorily implicated, his opportunity came.",have tendency act sly disobedience find congenial pastime set fashion time time peccadilloe boyhood prone restrictive code add large number see sufficient number companion implicate opportunity come

18,"To this none would have had any right to object--had it not necessarily, or at least from Chawner's point of view, involved a full, true, and particular account of the misdoings of each and every one; and consequently, for some time after these professions of misgivings, Chawner would be surrounded by a little crowd of anxiously obsequious friends, all trying hard to overcome his scruples or persuade him at least to omit their names from his revelations.",have right object have least point view involve full true particular account misdoing one time profession misgiving surround little crowd obsequious friend try overcome scruple persuade least omit name revelation 
19,"Sometimes he would affect to be convinced by their arguments and send them away reassured; at others his scruples would return in an aggravated form; and so he would keep them on tenterhooks of suspense for days and weeks, until he was tired of the amusement--for this practising on the fears of weaker natures is a horribly keen delight to some--or until some desperate little dog, unable to bear his torture any longer, would threaten to give himself up and make an end of it.",affect convince argument send reassure other scruple return aggravate form keep tenterhook suspense day week tired amusement practising fear weak nature keen delight desperate little dog unable bear torture threaten give make end

21,"Probably the Doctor did not altogether respect the instruments he saw fit to use in this way; some would have declined to hear the informer out, flogged him well, and forgotten it; but Dr. Grimstone--though he was hardly likely to be impressed by these exhibitions of noble candour, and did not fail to see that the prospect of obtaining better terms for the penitent himself had something to do with them--yet encouraged the system as a matter of policy, went thoroughly into the whole affair, and made it the cause of an explosion which he considered would clear the moral atmosphere for some time to come.",respect instrument see fit use way decline hear informer flogge forget likely impress exhibition noble candour fail see prospect obtain good term penitent have do encourage system matter policy go whole affair make cause explosion consider clear moral atmosphere time come

Perhaps a slight glance at instances of extraordinary interventions of the supernatural from the earliest times, tending to show the extreme probability of their survival on rare occasions even to the present day, might be a prudent and cautious introduction to the subject--only he could not think of any, and, after all, it might weary the Doctor.",begin course alarm schoolmaster raise doubt sincerity bad sanity slight glance instance extraordinary intervention supernatural early time tend show extreme probability survival rare occasion present day prudent cautious introduction subject think weary

59,"After that he found it difficult to get any further; he knew himself that all he was about to describe was plain, unvarnished fact--but how would it strike a stranger's ear? He found himself seeking ways in which to tone down the glaring improbability of the thing as much as possible, but in vain; ""I don't know how I shall ever get it all out,"" he told himself at last; ""if I think about it much longer I shall begin to disbelieve in it myself.""",find difficult get know about describe plain unvarnished fact strike stranger ear find seek way tone glaring improbability thing much possible vain know get tell last think begin disbelieve

They brought little offerings to propitiate him and prove the depth of their unaltered regard--pencil-cases and pocket-knives, and so forth, until they drove Paul nearly to desperation.

Twenty minutes past; Chawner and the others might return at any moment--a ring at the bell; they were there! all was over now--no, he was saved, that was Dr. Grimstone's voice in the hall--what an unconscionable time he was taking off his greatcoat and gloves.",long hand go sit stare faint sick feeling pass quarter delay unwarrantable manner farce social civility allow prevail stay supper minute other return moment ring bell save voice hall unconscionable time take greatcoat glove

107,"""Because, sir,"" explained Chawner, ""he knew I had made up my mind to tell you something I thought you ought to know about him, and so he threatened to come first and tell some falsehood (I'm sure I don't know what) about me, sir. I think I ought to be here too.""",sir explain know make mind tell think know threaten come tell falsehood sure know sir think

I hear Chawner first.""",suspicious say conscience good have object prevent hear spite obvious defect character go gulp overcome repulsion boy whole right minded conscientious boy hear

112,"When they were alone once more he turned upon the speechless Paul with furious scorn and indignation. ""Contemptible liar and hypocrite,"" he thundered, pacing restlessly up and down the room in his excitement, till Paul felt very like Daniel, without his sense of security, ""you are unmasked--unmasked, sir! You led me to believe that you were as much shocked and pained at this girl's venturing to write to you as I could be myself. You called it, quite correctly, 'forward and improper'; you pretended you had never given her the least encouragement--had not heard her name even--till to-day. And here is a note, written, as I should imagine, some time since, in which you address her as 'Connie Davenant,' and have the impudence to admire the hat she wore the Sunday before! I shudder, sir, to think of such duplicity, such precocious and shameless depravity. It astounds me.

117,"""He can't want to _torture_ me,"" thought Paul.",want _torture think 
118,"""Yes,"" said the Doctor again, ""the doubt has prevailed. On a mind so hardened the cane would leave no lasting impression. I cannot allow your innocent companions to run the risk of contamination from your society. I must not permit this serpent to glide uncrushed, this cockatrice to practise his epistolary wiles, within my peaceful fold. My mind is made up--at whatever cost to myself--however it may distress and grieve your good father, who is so pathetically anxious for you to do him credit, sir. I must do my duty to the parents of the boys entrusted to my care. I shall not flog you, sir, for I feel it would be useless.

121,"Mr. Bultitude covered his face with his hands, to hide, not his shame and distress, but his indecent rapture. It seemed almost too good to be true! He saw himself about to be provided with every means of reaching home in comfort and safety. He need dread no pursuit now. There was no chance, either, of his being forced to return to the prison-house--the Doctor's letter would convince even Dick of the impossibility of that. And, best of all, this magnificent stroke of good luck had been obtained without the ignominy and pain of a flogging, without even the unpleasant necessity of telling his strange secret.",cover face hand hide shame distress indecent rapture seem good true see about provide means reach home comfort safety need dread pursuit be chance force return prison house letter convince impossibility good magnificent stroke good luck obtain ignominy pain flog unpleasant necessity tell strange secret

125,"When he found himself locked securely into a comfortable, warm bedroom, with curtains and a carpet in it, safe from the persecutions of all those terrible boys, and when he remembered that this was actually the last night of his stay here--that he would certainly see his own home before noon next day, the reaction was so powerful that he could not refrain from skipping and leaping about the room in a kind of hysterical gaiety.",find lock comfortable warm bedroom curtain carpet safe persecution terrible boy remember last night stay see own home noon next day reaction powerful refrain skip leap room kind hysterical gaiety 
126,"And as he laid his head down on a yielding lavender-scented pillow, his thoughts went back without a pang to the varied events of the day; they had been painful, very painful, but it was well worth while to have gone through them to appreciate fully the delightful intensity of the contrast. He freely forgave all his tormentors, even Chawner--for had not Chawner procured his release?--and he closed his eyes at last with a smile of Sybaritic satisfaction and gentle longing for the Monday's dawn to break.",lay head yield lavender scent pillow thought go pang varied event day painful painful worth while go appreciate delightful intensity contrast forgive tormentor procure release close eye last smile sybaritic satisfaction gentle longing dawn break
