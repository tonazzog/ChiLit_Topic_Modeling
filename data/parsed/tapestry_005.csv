3," Onwards quietly stepped the little procession, Houpet first, his tuft waving as usual, with a comfortable air of importance and satisfaction; then Nibble and Grignan abreast--hand-in-hand, I was going to have said; next Hugh and Jeanne; with the two attendant chickens behind bringing up the rear.",step little procession tuft wave usual comfortable air importance satisfaction hand hand go say next attendant chicken bring rear 
4,"""I wonder where they are going to take us to,"" said Hugh in a low voice. Somehow the soft light; the strange loneliness of the great plain, where, now that they were accustomed to it, the rushing of the numberless water-springs seemed to be but one single, steady sound; the solemn behaviour of their curious guides, altogether, had subdued the children's spirits. Jeanne said no more about ""having fun,"" yet she did not seem the least frightened or depressed; she was only quiet and serious.",wonder go take say low voice soft light strange loneliness great plain accustom rush numberless water spring seem single steady sound solemn behaviour curious guide subdued child spirit say more have fun seem least frighten depressed quiet serious

6,"""I don't know--at least I'm not sure,"" said Jeanne; ""but, Chéri, isn't it a good thing that Houpet and the others are with us to show us the way, for though the ground looks so pretty it is quite boggy here and there. I notice that Houpet never goes quite close to the fountains, and just when I went the least bit near one a minute ago my feet began to slip down.""",know least sure say good thing other show way ground look pretty boggy notice go close fountain go least bit minute foot begin slip 
7,"""I haven't felt it like that at all,"" said Hugh. ""Perhaps it's because of my wall-climbers. Dudu gave me a pair of wall-climbers like the flies', you know, Jeanne.""",feel say wall climber give pair wall climber fly know 
8,"""Did he?"" said Jeanne, not at all surprised, and as if wall-climbers were no more uncommon than goloshes. ""He didn't give me any, but then I came a different way from you.

9,"""And very likely Dudu thought I could carry you if there was anywhere you couldn't climb,"" said Hugh, importantly. ""I'm sure I----"" he stopped abruptly, for a sudden crow from Houpet had brought all the party to a standstill. At first the children could not make out why their guide had stopped here--there was nothing to be seen. But pressing forward a few steps to where Houpet stood, Hugh saw, imbedded in the moss at his feet, a stone with a ring in it, just like those which one reads of in the _Arabian Nights_. Houpet stood at the edge of the stone eyeing it gravely, and somehow he managed to make Hugh understand that he was to lift it. Nothing loth, but rather doubtful as to whether he would be strong enough, the boy leant forward to reach the ring, first whispering, however, to Jeanne,",likely think carry be climb say sure stop sudden crow bring party standstill first child make guide stop be see press few step stand see imbedd moss foot stone ring read stand edge stone eye manage make understand lift doubtful strong boy lean reach ring whisper

14,"""Try again,"" said Hugh, and try again they did. But no--the second try succeeded no better than the first--and the children looked at each other in perplexity. Suddenly there was a movement among the animals, who had all been standing round watching the children's attempts; Jeanne felt a sort of little pecking tug at her skirts--how it came about I cannot say, but I think I forgot to tell you that, unlike Hugh in his red flannel dressing gown, _she_ was arrayed for their adventures in her best Sunday pelisse, trimmed with fur--and, looking round, lo and behold! there was Houpet holding on to her with his beak, then came Nibble, his two front paws embracing Houpet's feathered body, Grignan behind him again, clutching with his mouth at Nibble's fur, and the two chickens at the end holding on to Grignan and each other in some indescribable and marvellous way. It was, for all the world, as if they were preparing for the finish-up part of the game of ""oranges and lemons,"" or for that of ""fox and geese!""",try say try second try succeed good first child look other perplexity be movement animal stand watch child attempt feel sort little peck tug skirt come say think forget tell red flannel dress gown array adventure good pelisse trim fur look behold be hold beak come front paw embrace feathered body clutch mouth fur chicken end hold other indescribable marvellous way world prepare finish part game orange lemon fox geese

18,"""Here goes, then,"" said Hugh. ""One, two, _three_;"" and with ""three"" he gave a tremendous tug--a much more tremendous tug than was required, for, to his surprise, the stone yielded at once without the slightest resistance, and back they all fell, one on the top of the other, Hugh, Jeanne, Houpet, Nibble, Grignan, and the two chickens! But none of them were any the worse, and with the greatest eagerness to see what was to be seen where the stone had been, up jumped Hugh and Jeanne and ran forward to the spot.",go say _three_ give tremendous tug tremendous tug require surprise stone yield slight resistance fall top other chicken bad great eagerness see see stone jump run spot 
19,"""There should be,"" said Jeanne, half out of breath--""there _should_ be a little staircase for us to go down, if it is like the stories in the _Arabian Nights_.""",be say half breath little staircase go story 
20,"And, wonderful to relate, so there was! The children could hardly believe their eyes, when below them they saw the most tempting little spiral staircase of white stone or marble steps, with a neat little brass balustrade at one side. It looked quite light all the way down, though of course they could distinguish nothing at the bottom, as the corkscrew twists of the staircase entirely filled up the space.",wonderful relate be child believe eye see tempting little spiral staircase white stone marble step neat little brass balustrade side look light way course distinguish bottom corkscrew twist staircase fill space

25,"So down he went, Jeanne following close after.",go follow close 
26,"""I suppose Houpet and the others will come after us,"" said Jeanne, rather anxiously. But just as she uttered the words a rather shrill crow made both Hugh and her stop short and look up to the top. They saw Houpet and the others standing round the edge of the hole. Houpet gave another crow, in which the two chickens joined him, and then suddenly the stone was shut down--the two children found themselves alone in this strange place, leading to they knew not where! Jeanne gave a little cry--Hugh, too, for a moment was rather startled, but he soon recovered himself.",suppose other come say utter word shrill crow make stop short look top see other stand edge hole give crow chicken join stone shut child find alone strange place lead know give little cry moment startle recover 
27,"""Jeanne,"" he said, ""it must be all right. I don't think we need be frightened. See, it is quite light! The light comes up from below--down there it must be quite bright and cheerful. Give me your hand--if we go down sideways--so--we can hold each other's hands all the way.""",say right think frighten see light light come bright cheerful give hand go hold other hand way 
28,"So, in a rather queer fashion, they clambered down the long staircase. By the time they got to its end they were really quite tired of turning round and round so many times. But now the view before them was so pleasant that they forgot all their troubles.",queer fashion clamber long staircase time get end tired turn many time view pleasant forget trouble 
29,"They had found a little door at the foot of the stair, which opened easily. They passed through it, and there lay before them a beautiful expanse of water surrounded by hills; the door which had closed behind them seemed on this side to have been cut out of the turf of the hill, and was all but invisible. It was light, as Hugh had said, but not with the light of either sun or moon; a soft radiance was over everything, but whence it came they could not tell. The hills on each side of the water, which was more like a calmly flowing river than a lake, prevented their seeing very far, but close to the shore by which they stood a little boat was moored--a little boat with seats for two, and one light pair of oars.",find little door foot stair open pass lay beautiful expanse water surround hill door close seem side cut turf hill invisible light say light sun moon soft radiance come tell hill side water more flow river lake prevent see shore stand little boat moor little boat seat light pair oar

31,"They were soon settled in it, and Hugh, though he had only rowed once or twice before in his life, found it very easy and pleasant, and they went over the water swiftly and smoothly. After a while the hills approached more nearly, gradually the broad river dwindled to a mere stream, so narrow and small at last, that even their tiny boat could go no farther. Hugh was forced to leave off rowing.",settle row life find easy pleasant go water while hill approach broad river dwindle mere stream narrow small last tiny boat go far force leave rowing

33,"Jeanne was peering forward: just before them the brook, or what still remained of it, almost disappeared in a narrow little gorge between the hills.",peer brook remain disappear narrow little gorge hill

35,"""Perhaps,"" said Hugh. ""We may try."" So out the children got--Jeanne pulled in front, Hugh pushed behind. It was so very light that there was no difficulty as to its weight; only the gorge was so narrow that at last the boat stuck fast.",say try child get pull front push light be difficulty weight gorge narrow last boat stick 
36,"""We'd better leave it and clamber through ourselves,"" said Hugh.",leave clamber say 
37,"""But, O Chéri, we can't!"" cried Jeanne. ""From where I am I can see that the water gets wider again a little farther on. And the rocks come quite sharp down to the side. There is nowhere we could clamber on to, and I dare say the water is very deep. There are lots of little streams trickling into it from the rocks, and the boat could go quite well if we could but get it a little farther.""",cry see water get wide little rock come sharp side be clamber say water deep be lot little stream trickle rock boat go get little far

And even then, there would be the forest to go through, and perhaps we couldn't find our way among the trees as Houpet did.

40,Hugh stood still and considered.,stand consider

42,"And before Jeanne could ask him what he meant, he gave three clear, short whistles, and then waited to see the effect.",ask mean give clear short whistle wait see effect 
43,"It was a most unexpected one. Hugh had anticipated nothing else than the sudden appearance, somehow and somewhere, of Monsieur Dudu himself, as large as life--possibly, in this queer country of surprises, where they found themselves, a little larger! When and how he would appear Hugh was perfectly at a loss to imagine--he might fly down from the sky; he might spring up from the water; he might just suddenly stand before them without their having any idea how he had come. Hugh laughed to himself at the thought of Jeanne's astonishment, and after all it was Jeanne who first drew his attention to what was really happening.",unexpected one anticipate else sudden appearance large life queer country surprise find little large appear loss imagine fly sky spring water stand have idea come laugh thought astonishment draw attention happen 
44,"""Hark, Chéri, hark!"" she cried, ""what a queer noise! What can it be?""",cry queer noise 
45,"Hugh's attention had been so taken up in staring about in every direction for the raven that he had not noticed the sound which Jeanne had heard, and which now increased every moment.",attention take stare direction raven notice sound hear increase moment 
46,"It was a soft, swishy sound--as if innumerable little boats were making their way through water, or as if innumerable little fairies were bathing themselves, only every instant it came nearer and nearer, till at last, on every side of the boat in which the children were still standing, came creeping up from below lots and lots and _lots_ of small, bright green frogs, who clambered over the sides and arranged themselves in lines along the edges in the most methodical and orderly manner. Jeanne gave a scream of horror, and darted across the boat to where Hugh was standing.",soft swishy sound innumerable little boat make way water innumerable little fairy bathing instant come nearer last side boat child stand come creep lot lot _lots_ small bright green frog clamber side arrange line edge methodical orderly manner give scream horror dart boat stand 
47,"""O Chéri,"" she cried, ""why did you whistle? It's all that naughty Dudu. He's going to turn us into frogs too, I do believe, because he thinks I laughed at him. Oh dear, oh dear, what shall we do?""",cry whistle naughty go turn frog believe think laugh do 
48,"Chéri himself, though not quite so frightened as Jeanne, was not much pleased with the result of his summons to the raven.",frighten pleased result summons raven

50,"""I don't know,"" said Jeanne, a very little comforted; ""I don't know what it would feel like to be turned into a frog; I've always been a little girl, and so I can't tell.

What can they be going to do?""",know say little comfort know feel turn frog little girl tell feel creepy chilly see frog funny red eye get go do 
51,"She forgot her fears in the interest of watching them; Hugh, too, stared with all his eyes at the frogs, who, arranged in regular lines round the edge of the boat, began working away industriously at something which, for a minute or two, the children could not make out. At last Jeanne called out eagerly,",forget fear interest watch stare eye frog arrange regular line edge boat begin work minute child make last call 
52,"""They are throwing over little lines, Chéri--lots and lots of little lines. There must be frogs down below waiting to catch them.""",throw little line lot lot little line be frog wait catch 
53,"So it was; each frog threw over several threads which he seemed to unwind from his body; these threads were caught by something invisible down below, and twisted round and round several times, till at last they became as firm and strong as a fine twine. And when, apparently, the frogs considered that they had made cables enough, they settled themselves down, each firmly on his two hind legs, still holding by the rope with their front ones, and then--in another moment--to the children's great delight, they felt the boat beginning to move. It moved on smoothly--almost as smoothly as when on the water--there were no jogs or tugs, as might have been the case if it had been pulled by two or three coarse, strong ropes, for all the hundreds of tiny cables pulling together made one even force.",frog throw several thread seem unwind body thread catch invisible twist several time last become firm strong fine twine frog consider make cable settle hind leg hold rope front one moment child great delight feel boat begin move move water be jog tug case pull coarse strong rope hundred tiny cable pull make force

55,"""And to Dudu,"" observed Hugh.",observe 
56,Jeanne shrugged her shoulders. She was not over and above sure of Dudu even now.,shrugg shoulder sure 
57,"The boat moved along for some time; the pass between the hills was dark and gloomy, and though the water got wider, as Jeanne had seen, it would not for some distance have been possible for the children to row. After a time it suddenly grew much lighter; they came out from the narrow pass and found themselves but a few yards from a sheet of still water with trees all round it--a sort of mountain lake it seemed, silent and solitary, and reflecting back from its calm bosom the soft, silvery, even radiance which since they came out from the door on the hillside had been the children's only light.",boat move time pass hill dark gloomy water get wide see distance possible child row time grow light come narrow pass find few yard sheet water tree sort mountain lake seem silent solitary reflect calm bosom soft silvery radiance come door hillside child only light

59,"""Oh, do let us row on to the island,"" said Jeanne eagerly, for by this time the frogs had drawn them to the edge of the lake; there could no longer be any difficulty in rowing for themselves.",let row island say time frog draw edge lake be difficulty rowing 
60,"""First, any way, we must thank the frogs,"" said Hugh, standing up. He would have taken off his cap if he had had one on; as it was, he could only bow politely.",way thank frog say stand take cap have bow 
61,"As he did so, each frog turned round so as to face him, and each gave a little bob of the head, which, though not very graceful, was evidently meant as an acknowledgment of Hugh's courtesy.",do frog turn face give little bob head graceful mean acknowledgment courtesy 
62,"""They are very polite frogs,"" whispered Hugh. ""Jeanne, do stand up and bow to them too.""",polite frog whisper stand bow 
63,"Jeanne, who all this time had been sitting with her feet tucked up under her, showed no inclination to move.",time sit foot tuck show inclination move

65,"The frogs bowed again, which was very considerate of them; then suddenly there seemed a movement among them, those at the end of the boat drew back a little, and a frog, whom the children had not hitherto specially observed, came forward and stood in front of the others. He was bigger, his colour was a brighter green, and his eyes more brilliantly red. He stood up on his hind legs and bowed politely. Then, after clearing his throat, of which there was much need, for even with this precaution it sounded very croaky, he addressed the children.",frog bow considerate seem movement end boat draw little frog child observe come stand front other big colour bright green eye red stand hind leg bow clear throat be much need precaution sound croaky address child

68,"""Before Monsieur and Mademoiselle bid us farewell--before they leave our shores,"" continued the frog with a wave of his ""top legs,"" as Jeanne afterwards called them, ""we should desire to give them what, without presumption, I may call a treat. Monsieur and Mademoiselle are, doubtless, aware that in our humble way we are artists. Our weakness--our strength I should rather say--is music. Our croaking concerts are renowned far and wide, and by a most fortunate coincidence one is about to take place, to celebrate the farewell--the departure to other regions--of a songster whose family fame for many ages has been renowned.

71,"""Just so,"" he said; ""it is the truth. And, therefore, the extreme difficulty of assisting at so unique a performance. It is but seldom--not above half-a-dozen times in the recollection of the oldest of my venerated cousins, the toads, that such an opportunity has occurred--and as to whether human ears have _ever_ before been regaled with what you are about to enjoy, you must allow me, Monsieur and Mademoiselle, with all deference to your race, for whom naturally we cherish the highest respect, to express a doubt.""",say truth extreme difficulty assist unique performance half time recollection old venerate cousin toad opportunity occur human ear _ever_ regale about enjoy allow deference race cherish high respect express doubt

76,"""All round the lake the performers will be stationed,"" replied the frog pompously. ""The chief artist occupies the island which you see from here. If you move forward a little--to about half-way between the shore and the island--you will, I think, be excellently placed. But first,"" seeing that Hugh was preparing to take up the oars, ""first, you will allow us, Monsieur and Mademoiselle, to offer you a little collation--some slight refreshment after all the fatigues of your journey to our shores.""",lake performer station reply frog chief artist occupy island see move little half way shore island think place see prepare take oar allow offer little collation slight refreshment fatigue journey shore

80,"Jeanne shivered, but nevertheless could not help watching with curiosity. Scores of little tadpoles came hopping up the sides of the boat, each dozen or so of them carrying among them large water-lily leaves, on each of which curious and dainty-looking little cakes and bonbons were arranged. The first that was presented to Jeanne contained neat little biscuits about the size of a half-crown piece, of a tempting rich brown colour.",shiver help watch curiosity score little tadpole come hopping side boat carry large water lily leave curious dainty look little cake bonbon arrange first present contain neat little biscuit size half crown piece tempting rich brown colour

Many human beings are under the deplorable mistake of supposing we live on slimy water and dirty insects--ha, ha, ha! whereas our cuisine is astounding in variety and delicacy of material and flavour.

85,"""I _couldn't_ eat minnows' eggs,"" whispered Jeanne, looking rather doubtfully at the succession of leaf trays that continued to appear. She nibbled away at some of the least extraordinary-looking cakes, which the frog informed her were made from the pith of rushes roasted and ground down, and then flavoured with essence of marsh marigold, and found them nearly as nice as macaroons.
