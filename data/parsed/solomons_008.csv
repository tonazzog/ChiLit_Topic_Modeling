6,"This was a new idea, and we re-entered the place to put it to the proof. After the bright light outside, our eyes, weak as they were with staring at the snow, could not pierce the gloom of the cave for a while.

9,"Then I drew near and looked. The body was that of a tall man in middle life with aquiline features, grizzled hair, and a long black moustache. The skin was perfectly yellow, and stretched tightly over the bones. Its clothing, with the exception of what seemed to be the remains of a woollen pair of hose, had been removed, leaving the skeleton-like frame naked. Round the neck of the corpse, which was frozen perfectly stiff, hung a yellow ivory crucifix.",draw look body tall man middle life aquiline feature grizzled hair long black moustache skin yellow stretch bone clothing exception seem remains woollen pair hose remove leave skeleton like frame naked neck corpse freeze stiff hang yellow ivory crucifix

15,"""And what is there to prevent him from lasting for three thousand years in this atmosphere, I should like to know?"" asked Good. ""If only the temperature is sufficiently low, flesh and blood will keep fresh as New Zealand mutton for ever, and Heaven knows it is cold enough here. The sun never gets in here; no animal comes here to tear or destroy. No doubt his slave, of whom he speaks on the writing, took off his clothes and left him. He could not have buried him alone.

17,"""Ay,"" said Sir Henry, ""and this is where he got his ink from,"" and he pointed to a small wound on the Dom's left arm. ""Did ever man see such a thing before?""",say get ink point small wound left arm man see thing 
18,"There was no longer any doubt about the matter, which for my own part I confess perfectly appalled me. There he sat, the dead man, whose directions, written some ten generations ago, had led us to this spot. Here in my own hand was the rude pen with which he had written them, and about his neck hung the crucifix that his dying lips had kissed. Gazing at him, my imagination could reconstruct the last scene of the drama, the traveller dying of cold and starvation, yet striving to convey to the world the great secret which he had discovered:--the awful loneliness of his death, of which the evidence sat before us. It even seemed to me that I could trace in his strongly-marked features a likeness to those of my poor friend Silvestre his descendant, who had died twenty years before in my arms, but perhaps that was fancy. At any rate, there he sat, a sad memento of the fate that so often overtakes those who would penetrate into the unknown; and there doubtless he will still sit, crowned with the dread majesty of death, for centuries yet unborn, to startle the eyes of wanderers like ourselves, if ever any such should come again to invade his loneliness. The thing overpowered us, already almost perished as we were with cold and hunger.",be doubt matter own part confess appall sit dead man direction write generation lead spot own hand rude pen write neck hang crucifix die lip kiss gaze imagination reconstruct last scene drama traveller die cold starvation striving convey world great secret discover awful loneliness death evidence sit seem trace mark feature likeness poor friend descendant die year arm fancy rate sit sad memento fate overtake penetrate unknown sit crown dread majesty death century unborn startle eye wanderer such come invade loneliness thing overpower perish cold hunger 
19,"""Let us go,"" said Sir Henry in a low voice; ""stay, we will give him a companion,"" and lifting up the dead body of the Hottentot Ventvögel, he placed it near to that of the old Dom. Then he stooped, and with a jerk broke the rotten string of the crucifix which hung round da Silvestra's neck, for his fingers were too cold to attempt to unfasten it. I believe that he has it still. I took the bone pen, and it is before me as I write--sometimes I use it to sign my name.",let go say low voice stay give companion lift dead body place old dom stoop jerk break rotten string crucifix hang neck finger cold attempt unfast believe have take bone pen write use sign name 
20,"Then leaving these two, the proud white man of a past age, and the poor Hottentot, to keep their eternal vigil in the midst of the eternal snows, we crept out of the cave into the welcome sunshine and resumed our path, wondering in our hearts how many hours it would be before we were even as they are.",leave proud white man past age poor keep eternal vigil midst eternal snow creep cave welcome sunshine resume path wonder heart many hour 
21,"When we had walked about half a mile we came to the edge of the plateau, for the nipple of the mountain does not rise out of its exact centre, though from the desert side it had seemed to do so. What lay below us we could not see, for the landscape was wreathed in billows of morning fog. Presently, however, the higher layers of mist cleared a little, and revealed, at the end of a long slope of snow, a patch of green grass, some five hundred yards beneath us, through which a stream was running. Nor was this all. By the stream, basking in the bright sun, stood and lay a group of from ten to fifteen _large antelopes_--at that distance we could not see of what species.",walk mile come edge plateau nipple mountain rise exact centre desert side seem do lay see landscape wreathe billow morning fog high layer mist clear little reveal end long slope snow patch green grass yard stream run stream bask bright sun stand lay group _large antelopes_ distance see species 
22,"The sight filled us with an unreasoning joy. If only we could get it, there was food in plenty. But the question was how to do so. The beasts were fully six hundred yards off, a very long shot, and one not to be depended on when our lives hung on the results.",sight fill unreasoning joy get be food plenty question do beast yard long shot depend life hang result 
23,"Rapidly we discussed the advisability of trying to stalk the game, but in the end dismissed it reluctantly. To begin with, the wind was not favourable, and further, we must certainly be perceived, however careful we were, against the blinding background of snow, which we should be obliged to traverse.",discuss advisability try stalk game end dismiss begin wind favourable perceive careful blind background snow oblige traverse 
24,"""Well, we must have a try from where we are,"" said Sir Henry. ""Which shall it be, Quatermain, the repeating rifles or the expresses?""",have try say repeat rifle express 
25,"Here again was a question. The Winchester repeaters--of which we had two, Umbopa carrying poor Ventvögel's as well as his own--were sighted up to a thousand yards, whereas the expresses were only sighted to three hundred and fifty, beyond which distance shooting with them was more or less guess-work. On the other hand, if they did hit, the express bullets, being ""expanding,"" were much more likely to bring the game down. It was a knotty point, but I made up my mind that we must risk it and use the expresses.",question repeater have carry poor own sight yard express sight distance shooting more less guess work other hand hit express bullet expand likely bring game knotty point make mind risk use express 
26,"""Let each of us take the buck opposite to him. Aim well at the point of the shoulder and high up,"" said I; ""and Umbopa, do you give the word, so that we may all fire together.""",let take buck opposite aim point shoulder high say give word fire 
27,"Then came a pause, each of us aiming his level best, as indeed a man is likely to do when he knows that life itself depends upon the shot.",come pause aim level good man likely do know life depend shot 
28,"""Fire,"" said Umbopa in Zulu, and at almost the same instant the three rifles rang out loudly; three clouds of smoke hung for a moment before us, and a hundred echoes went flying over the silent snow. Presently the smoke cleared, and revealed--oh, joy!--a great buck lying on its back and kicking furiously in its death agony. We gave a yell of triumph--we were saved--we should not starve. Weak as we were, we rushed down the intervening slope of snow, and in ten minutes from the time of shooting, that animal's heart and liver were lying before us. But now a new difficulty arose, we had no fuel, and therefore could make no fire to cook them. We gazed at each other in dismay.",fire say same instant rifle ring cloud smoke hang moment echo go fly silent snow smoke clear reveal joy great buck lie back kick death agony give yell triumph save starve weak rush intervene slope snow minute time shooting animal heart liver lie new difficulty arise have fuel make fire cook gaze other dismay 
29,"""Starving men should not be fanciful,"" said Good; ""we must eat raw meat.""",starve man fanciful say good eat raw meat 
30,"There was no other way out of the dilemma, and our gnawing hunger made the proposition less distasteful than it would otherwise have been. So we took the heart and liver and buried them for a few minutes in a patch of snow to cool them. Then we washed them in the ice-cold water of the stream, and lastly ate them greedily. It sounds horrible enough, but honestly, I never tasted anything so good as that raw meat. In a quarter of an hour we were changed men. Our life and vigour came back to us, our feeble pulses grew strong again, and the blood went coursing through our veins. But mindful of the results of over-feeding on starved stomachs, we were careful not to eat too much, stopping whilst we were still hungry.",be other way dilemma gnaw hunger make proposition distasteful take heart liver bury few minute patch snow cool wash ice cold water stream eat sound horrible taste good raw meat quarter hour change man life vigour come feeble pulse grow strong blood go course vein mindful result feeding starve stomach careful eat stop hungry 
31,"""Thank Heaven!"" said Sir Henry; ""that brute has saved our lives. What is it, Quatermain?""",thank say brute save life 
32,"I rose and went to look at the antelope, for I was not certain. It was about the size of a donkey, with large curved horns. I had never seen one like it before; the species was new to me. It was brown in colour, with faint red stripes, and grew a thick coat. I afterwards discovered that the natives of that wonderful country call these bucks ""_inco_."" They are very rare, and only found at a great altitude where no other game will live. This animal was fairly hit high up in the shoulder, though whose bullet brought it down we could not, of course, discover. I believe that Good, mindful of his marvellous shot at the giraffe, secretly set it down to his own prowess, and we did not contradict him.",rise go look antelope certain size donkey large curved horn see species new brown colour faint red stripe grow thick coat discover native wonderful country call buck rare find great altitude other game live animal hit high shoulder bullet bring course discover believe good mindful marvellous shot giraffe set own prowess contradict 
33,"We had been so busy satisfying our hunger that hitherto we had not found time to look about us. But now, having set Umbopa to cut off as much of the best meat as we were likely to be able to carry, we began to inspect our surroundings. The mist had cleared away, for it was eight o'clock, and the sun had sucked it up, so we were able to take in all the country before us at a glance. I know not how to describe the glorious panorama which unfolded itself to our gaze. I have never seen anything like it before, nor shall, I suppose, again.",busy satisfy hunger find time look set cut much good meat likely able carry begin inspect surroundings mist clear o'clock sun suck able take country glance know describe glorious panorama unfold gaze see suppose 
34,"Behind and over us towered Sheba's snowy Breasts, and below, some five thousand feet beneath where we stood, lay league on league of the most lovely champaign country. Here were dense patches of lofty forest, there a great river wound its silvery way. To the left stretched a vast expanse of rich, undulating veld or grass land, whereon we could just make out countless herds of game or cattle, at that distance we could not tell which. This expanse appeared to be ringed in by a wall of distant mountains. To the right the country was more or less mountainous; that is, solitary hills stood up from its level, with stretches of cultivated land between, amongst which we could see groups of dome-shaped huts. The landscape lay before us as a map, wherein rivers flashed like silver snakes, and Alp-like peaks crowned with wildly twisted snow wreaths rose in grandeur, whilst over all was the glad sunlight and the breath of Nature's happy life.",tower snowy breast foot stand lay league league lovely champaign country be dense patch lofty forest great river wind silvery way left stretch vast expanse rich undulate veld grass land make countless herd game cattle distance tell expanse appear ringed wall distant mountain right country mountainous solitary hill stand level stretche cultivate land see group dome shape hut landscape lay map river flash silver snake alp like peak crown twist snow wreath rise grandeur glad sunlight breath happy life 
35,"Two curious things struck us as we gazed. First, that the country before us must lie at least three thousand feet higher than the desert we had crossed, and secondly, that all the rivers flowed from south to north. As we had painful reason to know, there was no water upon the southern side of the vast range on which we stood, but on the northern face were many streams, most of which appeared to unite with the great river we could see winding away farther than our eyes could follow.",curious thing strike gaze country lie least foot high desert cross river flow north have painful reason know be water southern side vast range stand northern face many stream most appear unite great river see wind eye follow 
36,We sat down for a while and gazed in silence at this wonderful view. Presently Sir Henry spoke.,sit while gaze silence wonderful view speak

38,"I nodded, for I was still gazing out over the far country.",nod gaze far country 
39,"""Well, look; there it is!"" and he pointed a little to our right.",look be point little right 
40,"Good and I looked accordingly, and there, winding away towards the plain, was what appeared to be a wide turnpike road. We had not seen it at first because, on reaching the plain, it turned behind some broken country. We did not say anything, at least, not much; we were beginning to lose the sense of wonder. Somehow it did not seem particularly unnatural that we should find a sort of Roman road in this strange land. We accepted the fact, that was all.",good look wind plain appear wide road see first reach plain turn break country say least much begin lose sense wonder seem unnatural find sort roman road strange land accept fact 
41,"""Well,"" said Good, ""it must be quite near us if we cut off to the right. Hadn't we better be making a start?""",say good cut right make start 
42,"This was sound advice, and so soon as we had washed our faces and hands in the stream we acted on it. For a mile or more we made our way over boulders and across patches of snow, till suddenly, on reaching the top of the little rise, we found the road at our feet. It was a splendid road cut out of the solid rock, at least fifty feet wide, and apparently well kept; though the odd thing was that it seemed to begin there. We walked down and stood on it, but one single hundred paces behind us, in the direction of Sheba's Breasts, it vanished, the entire surface of the mountain being strewn with boulders interspersed with patches of snow.",sound advice wash face hand stream act mile more make way boulder patch snow reach top little rise find road foot splendid road cut solid rock least foot wide keep odd thing seem begin walk stand single pace direction vanish entire surface mountain strewn boulder intersperse patch snow 
43,"""What do you make of this, Quatermain?"" asked Sir Henry.",make ask 
44,"I shook my head, I could make nothing of the thing.",shake head make thing 
45,"""I have it!"" said Good; ""the road no doubt ran right over the range and across the desert on the other side, but the sand there has covered it up, and above us it has been obliterated by some volcanic eruption of molten lava.""",have say good road doubt run range desert other side sand cover obliterate volcanic eruption molten lava 
46,"This seemed a good suggestion; at any rate, we accepted it, and proceeded down the mountain. It proved a very different business travelling along down hill on that magnificent pathway with full stomachs from what it was travelling uphill over the snow quite starved and almost frozen. Indeed, had it not been for melancholy recollections of poor Ventvögel's sad fate, and of that grim cave where he kept company with the old Dom, we should have felt positively cheerful, notwithstanding the sense of unknown dangers before us. Every mile we walked the atmosphere grew softer and balmier, and the country before us shone with a yet more luminous beauty. As for the road itself, I never saw such an engineering work, though Sir Henry said that the great road over the St. Gothard in Switzerland is very similar. No difficulty had been too great for the Old World engineer who laid it out. At one place we came to a ravine three hundred feet broad and at least a hundred feet deep. This vast gulf was actually filled in with huge blocks of dressed stone, having arches pierced through them at the bottom for a waterway, over which the road went on sublimely. At another place it was cut in zigzags out of the side of a precipice five hundred feet deep, and in a third it tunnelled through the base of an intervening ridge, a space of thirty yards or more.",seem good suggestion rate accept proceed mountain prove different business travel hill magnificent pathway full stomach travel snow starve freeze melancholy recollection poor sad fate grim cave keep company old feel cheerful notwithstand sense unknown danger mile walk atmosphere grow softer balmy country shine luminous beauty road see engineering work say great road similar difficulty great old engineer lay place come ravine foot broad least foot deep vast gulf fill huge block dress stone have arche pierce bottom waterway road go place cut zigzag side precipice foot deep third tunnell base intervene ridge space yard more 
47,"Here we noticed that the sides of the tunnel were covered with quaint sculptures, mostly of mailed figures driving in chariots. One, which was exceedingly beautiful, represented a whole battle scene with a convoy of captives being marched off in the distance.",notice side tunnel cover quaint sculpture mail figure drive chariot beautiful represent whole battle scene convoy captive march distance 
48,"""Well,"" said Sir Henry, after inspecting this ancient work of art, ""it is very well to call this Solomon's Road, but my humble opinion is that the Egyptians had been here before Solomon's people ever set a foot on it. If this isn't Egyptian or Phoenician handiwork, I must say that it is very like it.""",say inspect ancient work art well call humble opinion person set foot egyptian phoenician handiwork say 
49,"By midday we had advanced sufficiently down the mountain to search the region where wood was to be met with. First we came to scattered bushes which grew more and more frequent, till at last we found the road winding through a vast grove of silver trees similar to those which are to be seen on the slopes of Table Mountain at Cape Town. I had never before met with them in all my wanderings, except at the Cape, and their appearance here astonished me greatly.",midday advance mountain search region wood meet come scatter bush grow frequent last find road wind vast grove silver tree similar see slope meet wandering appearance astonished

51,"Nobody objected to this, so leaving the road we made our way to a stream which was babbling away not far off, and soon had a goodly fire of dry boughs blazing. Cutting off some substantial hunks from the flesh of the _inco_ which we had brought with us, we proceeded to toast them on the end of sharp sticks, as one sees the Kafirs do, and ate them with relish. After filling ourselves, we lit our pipes and gave ourselves up to enjoyment that, compared with the hardships we had recently undergone, seemed almost heavenly.",object leave road make way stream babble have goodly fire dry bough blaze cut substantial hunk flesh _inco_ bring proceed toast end sharp stick see do eat relish fill light pipe give enjoyment compare hardship undergone seem 
52,"The brook, of which the banks were clothed with dense masses of a gigantic species of maidenhair fern interspersed with feathery tufts of wild asparagus, sung merrily at our side, the soft air murmured through the leaves of the silver trees, doves cooed around, and bright-winged birds flashed like living gems from bough to bough. It was a Paradise.",brook bank cloth dense mass gigantic species maidenhair fern intersperse feathery tuft wild asparagus sung side soft air murmure leave silver tree dove cooe bright winged bird flash living gem bough bough paradise 
53,"The magic of the place combined with an overwhelming sense of dangers left behind, and of the promised land reached at last, seemed to charm us into silence. Sir Henry and Umbopa sat conversing in a mixture of broken English and Kitchen Zulu in a low voice, but earnestly enough, and I lay, with my eyes half shut, upon that fragrant bed of fern and watched them.",magic place combine overwhelming sense danger leave promise land reach last seem charm silence sit convers mixture break low voice lay eye half shut fragrant bed fern watch 
54,"Presently I missed Good, and I looked to see what had become of him. Soon I observed him sitting by the bank of the stream, in which he had been bathing. He had nothing on but his flannel shirt, and his natural habits of extreme neatness having reasserted themselves, he was actively employed in making a most elaborate toilet. He had washed his gutta-percha collar, had thoroughly shaken out his trousers, coat and waistcoat, and was now folding them up neatly till he was ready to put them on, shaking his head sadly as he scanned the numerous rents and tears in them, which naturally had resulted from our frightful journey. Then he took his boots, scrubbed them with a handful of fern, and finally rubbed them over with a piece of fat, which he had carefully saved from the _inco_ meat, till they looked, comparatively speaking, respectable. Having inspected them judiciously through his eye-glass, he put the boots on and began a fresh operation. From a little bag that he carried he produced a pocket-comb in which was fixed a tiny looking-glass, and in this he surveyed himself. Apparently he was not satisfied, for he proceeded to do his hair with great care. Then came a pause whilst he again contemplated the effect; still it was not satisfactory. He felt his chin, on which the accumulated scrub of a ten days' beard was flourishing.",miss good look see become observe sit bank stream bathing have flannel shirt natural habit extreme neatness reassert employ make elaborate toilet wash gutta percha collar shake trousers coat waistcoat fold ready put shake head scan numerous rent tear result frightful journey take boot scrubb handful fern rub piece fat save _inco_ meat look speak respectable inspect eye glass put boot begin fresh operation little bag carry produce pocket comb fix tiny look glass survey satisfied proceed do hair great care come pause contemplate effect satisfactory feel chin accumulate scrub days' beard flourish 
55,"""Surely,"" thought I, ""he is not going to try to shave."" But so it was. Taking the piece of fat with which he had greased his boots, Good washed it thoroughly in the stream. Then diving again into the bag he brought out a little pocket razor with a guard to it, such as are bought by people who are afraid of cutting themselves, or by those about to undertake a sea voyage. Then he rubbed his face and chin vigorously with the fat and began. Evidently it proved a painful process, for he groaned very much over it, and I was convulsed with inward laughter as I watched him struggling with that stubbly beard. It seemed so very odd that a man should take the trouble to shave himself with a piece of fat in such a place and in our circumstances. At last he succeeded in getting the hair off the right side of his face and chin, when suddenly I, who was watching, became conscious of a flash of light that passed just by his head.",think go try shave take piece fat grease boot wash stream diving bag bring little pocket razor guard such buy person afraid cut undertake sea voyage rub face chin fat begin prove painful process groan convulse inward laughter watch struggle stubbly beard seem odd man take trouble shave piece fat place circumstance last succeed get hair right side face chin watch become conscious flash light pass head 
56,"Good sprang up with a profane exclamation (if it had not been a safety razor he would certainly have cut his throat), and so did I, without the exclamation, and this was what I saw. Standing not more than twenty paces from where I was, and ten from Good, were a group of men. They were very tall and copper-coloured, and some of them wore great plumes of black feathers and short cloaks of leopard skins; this was all I noticed at the moment. In front of them stood a youth of about seventeen, his hand still raised and his body bent forward in the attitude of a Grecian statue of a spear-thrower. Evidently the flash of light had been caused by a weapon which he had hurled.",good spring profane exclamation safety razor cut throat exclamation see stand more pace group man tall copper coloured wear great plume black feather short cloak leopard skin notice moment front stand youth hand raise body bend attitude grecian statue spear thrower flash light cause weapon hurl

61,"""Greeting,"" answered the old man, not, indeed, in the same tongue, but in a dialect so closely allied to it that neither Umbopa nor myself had any difficulty in understanding him.

62,"""Whence come you?"" he went on, ""who are you? and why are the faces of three of you white, and the face of the fourth as the face of our mother's sons?"" and he pointed to Umbopa. I looked at Umbopa as he said it, and it flashed across me that he was right. The face of Umbopa was like the faces of the men before me, and so was his great form like their forms. But I had not time to reflect on this coincidence.",come go face white face fourth face mother son point look say flash right face face man great form form have time reflect coincidence
