2,"So far as I was concerned myself, I had come to port; but I had still Alan, to whom I was so much beholden, on my hands; and I felt besides a heavy charge in the matter of the murder and James of the Glens. On both these heads I unbosomed to Rankeillor the next morning, walking to and fro about six of the clock before the house of Shaws, and with nothing in view but the fields and woods that had been my ancestors’ and were now mine. Even as I spoke on these grave subjects, my eye would take a glad bit of a run over the prospect, and my heart jump with pride.",concern come port have beholden hand feel heavy charge matter murder head unbosom next morning walk clock house view field wood ancestor speak grave subject eye take glad bit run prospect heart jump pride 
3,"About my clear duty to my friend, the lawyer had no doubt. I must help him out of the county at whatever risk; but in the case of James, he was of a different mind.",clear duty friend lawyer have doubt help county risk case different mind 
4,"“Mr. Thomson,” says he, “is one thing, Mr. Thomson’s kinsman quite another. I know little of the facts, but I gather that a great noble (whom we will call, if you like, the D. of A.)* has some concern and is even supposed to feel some animosity in the matter. The D. of A. is doubtless an excellent nobleman; but, Mr. David, timeo qui nocuere deos. If you interfere to balk his vengeance, you should remember there is one way to shut your testimony out; and that is to put you in the dock. There, you would be in the same pickle as Mr. Thomson’s kinsman. You will object that you are innocent; well, but so is he. And to be tried for your life before a Highland jury, on a Highland quarrel and with a Highland Judge upon the bench, would be a brief transition to the gallows.”",say thing kinsman know little fact gather great noble call like have concern suppose feel animosity matter excellent nobleman interfere balk vengeance remember be way shut testimony put dock same pickle kinsman object innocent try life jury quarrel bench brief transition gallow

6,"Now I had made all these reasonings before and found no very good reply to them; so I put on all the simplicity I could. “In that case, sir,”  said I, “I would just have to be hanged--would I not?”",make reasoning find good reply put simplicity case sir say have hang 
7,"“My dear boy,” cries he, “go in God’s name, and do what you think is right. It is a poor thought that at my time of life I should be advising you to choose the safe and shameful; and I take it back with an apology. Go and do your duty; and be hanged, if you must, like a gentleman. There are worse things in the world than to be hanged.”",dear boy cry go name do think right poor thought time life advise choose safe shameful take apology go do duty hang gentleman be bad thing world hang 
8,"“Not many, sir,” said I, smiling.",many sir say smile 
9,"“Why, yes, sir,” he cried, “very many. And it would be ten times better for your uncle (to go no farther afield) if he were dangling decently upon a gibbet.”",sir cry many time good uncle go dangle gibbet 
10,"Thereupon he turned into the house (still in a great fervour of mind, so that I saw I had pleased him heartily) and there he wrote me two letters, making his comments on them as he wrote.",turn house great fervour mind see pleased write letter make comment write 
11,"“This,” says he, “is to my bankers, the British Linen Company, placing a credit to your name. Consult Mr. Thomson, he will know of ways; and you, with this credit, can supply the means. I trust you will be a good husband of your money; but in the affair of a friend like Mr. Thomson, I would be even prodigal. Then for his kinsman, there is no better way than that you should seek the Advocate, tell him your tale, and offer testimony; whether he may take it or not, is quite another matter, and will turn on the D. of A. Now, that you may reach the Lord Advocate well recommended, I give you here a letter to a namesake of your own, the learned Mr. Balfour of Pilrig, a man whom I esteem. It will look better that you should be presented by one of your own name; and the laird of Pilrig is much looked up to in the Faculty and stands well with Lord Advocate Grant. I would not trouble him, if I were you, with any particulars; and (do you know?) I think it would be needless to refer to Mr. Thomson. Form yourself upon the laird, he is a good model; when you deal with the Advocate, be discreet; and in all these matters, may the Lord guide you, Mr. David!”",say banker british place credit name consult know way credit supply means trust good husband money affair friend prodigal kinsman be good way seek tell tale offer testimony take matter turn reach recommend give letter namesake own learn man esteem look good present own name laird look faculty stand trouble particular know think needless refer form laird good model deal advocate discreet matter guide 
12,"Thereupon he took his farewell, and set out with Torrance for the Ferry, while Alan and I turned our faces for the city of Edinburgh. As we went by the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge, we kept looking back at the house of my fathers. It stood there, bare and great and smokeless, like a place not lived in; only in one of the top windows, there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back and forward, like the head of a rabbit from a burrow. I had little welcome when I came, and less kindness while I stayed; but at least I was watched as I went away.",take farewell set turn face city go footpath gatepost unfinished lodge keep look house father stand bare great smokeless place live top window be peak nightcap bob head rabbit burrow have little welcome come less kindness stay least watch go 
13,"Alan and I went slowly forward upon our way, having little heart either to walk or speak. The same thought was uppermost in both, that we were near the time of our parting; and remembrance of all the bygone days sate upon us sorely. We talked indeed of what should be done; and it was resolved that Alan should keep to the county, biding now here, now there, but coming once in the day to a particular place where I might be able to communicate with him, either in my own person or by messenger. In the meanwhile, I was to seek out a lawyer, who was an Appin Stewart, and a man therefore to be wholly trusted; and it should be his part to find a ship and to arrange for Alan’s safe embarkation. No sooner was this business done, than the words seemed to leave us; and though I would seek to jest with Alan under the name of Mr. Thomson, and he with me on my new clothes and my estate, you could feel very well that we were nearer tears than laughter.",go way have little heart walk speak same thought uppermost time parting remembrance bygone day sate talk do resolve keep county bide come day particular place able communicate own person messenger meanwhile seek lawyer man trust part find ship arrange safe embarkation business do word seem leave seek jest name new clothes estate feel nearer tear laughter 
14,"We came the by-way over the hill of Corstorphine; and when we got near to the place called Rest-and-be-Thankful, and looked down on Corstorphine bogs and over to the city and the castle on the hill, we both stopped, for we both knew without a word said that we had come to where our ways parted. Here he repeated to me once again what had been agreed upon between us: the address of the lawyer, the daily hour at which Alan might be found, and the signals that were to be made by any that came seeking him. Then I gave what money I had (a guinea or two of Rankeillor’s) so that he should not starve in the meanwhile; and then we stood a space, and looked over at Edinburgh in silence.",come way hill get place call thankful look bog city castle hill stop know word say come way part repeat agree address lawyer daily hour find signal make come seek give money have guinea starve stand space look silence 
15,"“Well, good-bye,” said Alan, and held out his left hand.",good bye say hold left hand 
16,"“Good-bye,” said I, and gave the hand a little grasp, and went off down hill.",good say give hand little grasp go hill 
17,"Neither one of us looked the other in the face, nor so long as he was in my view did I take one back glance at the friend I was leaving. But as I went on my way to the city, I felt so lost and lonesome, that I could have found it in my heart to sit down by the dyke, and cry and weep like any baby.",one look other face view take back glance friend leave go way city feel lost lonesome find heart sit dyke cry weep baby 
18,"It was coming near noon when I passed in by the West Kirk and the Grassmarket into the streets of the capital. The huge height of the buildings, running up to ten and fifteen storeys, the narrow arched entries that continually vomited passengers, the wares of the merchants in their windows, the hubbub and endless stir, the foul smells and the fine clothes, and a hundred other particulars too small to mention, struck me into a kind of stupor of surprise, so that I let the crowd carry me to and fro; and yet all the time what I was thinking of was Alan at Rest-and-be-Thankful; and all the time (although you would think I would not choose but be delighted with these braws and novelties) there was a cold gnawing in my inside like a remorse for something wrong.",come noon pass street capital huge height building run storey narrow arched entrie vomit passenger ware merchant window hubbub endless stir foul smell fine clothes other particular small mention strike kind stupor surprise let crowd carry for time think thankful time think choose delight braw novelty be cold gnawing inside remorse wrong
