2," THE next day the great cloud still hung over the mountain, and the rain poured like water from a full sponge. The princess was very fond of being out of doors, and she nearly cried when she saw that the weather was no better. But the mist was not of such a dark dingy gray; there was light in it; and as the hours went on, it grew brighter and brighter, until it was almost too brilliant to look at; and late in the afternoon, the sun broke out so gloriously that Irene clapped her hands, crying,",next day great cloud hang mountain rain pour water full sponge princess fond door cry see weather good mist dark dingy gray be light hour go grow bright bright brilliant look afternoon sun break clapp hand cry

4,"Lootie was very glad to please the princess. She got her hat and cloak, and they set out together for a walk up the mountain; for the road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it, and it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain ceased. The clouds were rolling away in broken pieces, like great, overwoolly sheep, whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost too white for the eyes to bear. Between them the sky shone with a deeper and purer blue, because of the rain. The trees on the road-side were hung all over with drops, which sparkled in the sun like jewels. The only things that were no brighter for the rain, were the brooks that ran down the mountain; they had changed from the clearness of crystal to a muddy brown; but what they lost in color they gained in sound--or at least in noise, for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as before. But Irene was in raptures with the great brown streams tumbling down everywhere; and Lootie shared in her delight, for she too had been confined to the house for three days. At length she observed that the sun was getting low, and said it was time to be going back. She made the remark again and again, but, every time, the princess begged her to go on just a little farther and a little farther; reminding her that it was much easier to go down hill, and saying that when they did turn, they would be at home in a moment. So on and on they did go, now to look at a group of ferns over whose tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch, now to pick a shining stone from a rock by the wayside, now to watch the flight of some bird. Suddenly the shadow of a great mountain peak came up from behind, and shot in front of them. When the nurse saw it, she started and shook, and tremulously grasping the hand of the princess turned and began to run down the hill.",glad please princess get hat cloak set walk mountain road hard steep water rest dry walk few minute rain cease cloud roll break piece great overwoolly sheep wool sun bleach white eye bear sky shine deep purer blue rain tree road side hang drop sparkle sun jewel only thing bright rain brook run mountain change clearness crystal muddy brown lose color gain sound least noise brook swollen musical rapture great brown stream tumble share delight confine house day length observe sun get low say time go make remark time princess begg go little far little far remind easy go hill say turn home moment go look group fern top stream pour watery arch pick shine stone rock wayside watch flight bird shadow great mountain peak come shoot front nurse see start shake grasp hand princess turn begin run hill

8,"It was too true. The nurse almost cried. They were much too far from home. It was against express orders to be out with the princess one moment after the sun was down; and they were nearly a mile up the mountain! If his Majesty, Irene's papa, were to hear of it, Lootie would certainly be dismissed; and to leave the princess would break her heart. It was no wonder she ran. But Irene was not in the least frightened, not knowing anything to be frightened at. She kept on chattering as well as she could, but it was not easy.",true nurse cry home express order princess moment sun mile mountain papa hear dismiss leave princess break heart wonder run least frighten know frighten keep chatter easy

15,"Lootie gave a stifled cry, and ran faster still--so fast, that Irene's little legs could not keep up with her, and she fell with a clash. It was a hard down-hill road, and she had been running very fast--so it was no wonder she began to cry. This put the nurse nearly beside herself; but all she could do was to run on, the moment she got the princess on her feet again.",give stifle cry run fast little leg keep fall clash hard hill road run wonder begin cry put nurse do run moment get princess foot

25,"Now Irene did not know what good reason there was for her nurse's terror, for the servants had all strict orders never to mention the goblins to her, but it was very discomposing to see her nurse in such a fright. Before, however, she had time to grow thoroughly alarmed like her, she heard the sound of whistling, and that revived her. Presently she saw a boy coming up the road from the valley to meet them. He was the whistler; but before they met, his whistling changed to singing. And this is something like what he sang:",know good reason be nurse terror servant have strict order mention goblin discomposing see nurse fright have time grow alarm hear sound whistling revive see boy come road valley meet whistler meet whistling change sing sing

27,"""I wish you would hold _your_ noise,"" said the nurse rudely, for the very word goblin at such a time and in such a place made her tremble. It would bring the goblins upon them to a certainty, she thought, to defy them in that way.

32,"The boy was dressed in a miner's dress, with a curious cap on his head. He was a very nice-looking boy, with eyes as dark as the mines in which he worked, and as sparkling as the crystals in their rocks. He was about twelve years old. His face was almost too pale for beauty, which came of his being so little in the open air and the sunlight--for even vegetables grown in the dark are white; but he looked happy, merry indeed--perhaps at the thought of having routed the goblins; and his bearing as he stood before them had nothing clownish or rude about it.",boy dress miner dress curious cap head nice look boy eye dark mine work sparkling crystal rock year old face pale beauty come little open air sunlight vegetable grow dark white look happy merry thought rout goblin bear stand have clownish rude
