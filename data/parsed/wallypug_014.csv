2," “OH my! Good gracious me!” exclaimed a voice as we approached the entrance to the palace and looking up we beheld the Cockatoo perched on a window-sill. “Just look at these creatures. _What_ a color. Why, why,” she exclaimed, peering at us closely, “I’m bothered if it isn’t the Wallypug and the Hatless Man, and the great Mr. A. Fish, Esq. Where have you been? What did you come back for?

12,"“Shan’t!” replied a voice from within; “who are you ordering about. If you want them arrested, do it yourself.

21,"A. Fish, Esq., busied himself in preparing an elaborate lecture, which he said he would deliver in public on the morrow, on the “Unreasonableness of Misunderstandability,” and which would, he hoped, clearly explain away the mistake which had been made, in accusing his Majesty of treason, in connection with his unfortunate recitation of “A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!”",busy prepare elaborate lecture say deliver public morrow unreasonableness hope explain mistake make accuse treason connection unfortunate recitation horse horse kingdom horse 
22,"While we were thus busily engaged there came an impatient tap-tap-tapping at the door, and on opening it we beheld the Crow looking more disreputably untidy than ever. He carried a large bundle of papers and a quill pen. “Ahem!” he began importantly, “I call on behalf of the _Daily Whyer_ a new paper which I have just established, and which I am happy to say has already an enormous circulation in Why. It is very cheap (four copies for a penny), and contains an enormous amount of totally unreliable information; besides which there is a page devoted to domestic matters, highly interesting to ladies, and includes receipts for artistically furnishing your house with old tea chests and soap boxes, painted with enamel and draped with art muslin; there are also several poems weekly on the subject of ‘Baby’s Little Socks,’ which are immensely popular with some people, here is one of them,” he cried, turning to the back page of his paper, a copy of which he had with him.",engage come impatient tap tap tap door open beheld look untidy carry large bundle paper quill pen begin call behalf new paper establish happy say enormous circulation cheap copy penny contain enormous amount unreliable information be page devote domestic matter interesting lady include receipt furnish house old tea chest soap box paint enamel drape art muslin be several poem subject little popular person cry turn back page paper copy have

31,"“I _promise_ to pay him ever so much a year,” said the Crow, “but—er—ahem—I have a very bad memory.

33,"“Oh! to tell you the truth,” said the Crow, “I wanted to know if the Wallypug would let me print an interview with him in to-morrow’s paper. You have just returned from Wer-har-wei, I believe, haven’t you; I was sitting on the signal post at the station just now and saw you arrive. I think my readers would be very interested in hearing your impressions of the country.”",tell truth say want know let print interview paper return believe sit signal post station see arrive think reader interested hear impression country 
34,"I took his Majesty aside and pointed out to him that very possibly an interview with him appearing in the paper would have a good effect on his people, and he could use it as a means of advertising the reforms he intended making in the government of the land; and his Majesty agreeing with me on the point, he seated himself comfortably in his own particular chair, and the Crow, perching on the back of another, the interview began.",take point interview appear paper have good effect person use means advertise reform intend make government land majesty agree point seat own particular chair perch back interview begin

38,"“Why Y. D.?” I inquired, curiously.",inquire 
39,"“Year of disgrace,” was the prompt reply. “Bless me! this must be a Post Office pen,” he went on, as the pen scattered the ink about in all directions. “They are always bad, you know.” Then, having asked the Wallypug no end of questions, not only about our journey, but on all sorts of private matters also, the wretched-looking bird gathered up his papers, which were covered with unintelligible blots and scratches and scattered in all parts of the room, and, tucking them under his wing, departed, to have the matter set up in print.",year disgrace prompt reply bless pen go pen scatter ink direction bad know ask end question journey sort private matter wretched look bird gather paper cover unintelligible blot scratch scatter part room tuck wing depart have matter set print
