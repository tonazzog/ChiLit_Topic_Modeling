Meanwhile, he was top of all his classes at school, and tip-top of the geography class.",gardener boy mean grow general poet prime admiral civil engineer top class school tip top geography class 
7,"As for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little girl, and everyone loved her. She was always kind and polite, even to her Uncle James and to other people whom she did not like very much; and though she was not very clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her lessons. Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your lessons, you may as well try, and sometimes you find that by some fortunate accident they really _are_ done. Then the Princess had a truly good heart: She was always kind to her pets. She never slapped her hippopotamus when it broke her dolls in its playful gambols, and she never forgot to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the backyard. Her elephant was devoted to her, and sometimes Mary Ann made her nurse quite cross by smuggling the dear little thing up to bed with her and letting it go to sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across her throat, and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear.",good little girl love kind polite other person like clever try do lesson know do lesson try find fortunate accident do have good heart kind pet slap hippopotamus break doll playful gambol forget feed rhinocerose little hutch backyard elephant devote make nurse cross smuggle dear little thing bed let go sleep long trunk lay throat pretty head cuddle royal right ear 
8,"When the Princess had been good all through the week--for, like all real, live, nice children, she was sometimes naughty, but never bad--Nurse would allow her to ask her little friends to come on Wednesday morning early and spend the day, because Wednesday is the end of the week in that country. Then, in the afternoon, when all the little dukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses had finished their rice pudding and had had their hands and faces washed after it, Nurse would say: ""Now, my dears, what would you like to do this afternoon?"" just as if she didn't know. And the answer would be always the same:",good week real live nice child naughty bad allow ask little friend come morning spend day end week country afternoon little duke duchess marquise countess finish rice pudding have hand face wash say dear like do afternoon know answer same

10,"So their pinafores were taken off and they all went to the Zoological Gardens, where twenty of them could ride at a time on the guinea pig, and where even the little ones could feed the great rabbits if some grown-up person were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose.",pinafore take go zoological ride time guinea pig little one feed great rabbit grow person kind lift purpose 
11,"There always was some such person, because in Rotundia everybody was kind--except one.",be such person kind 
12,"Now that you have read as far as this you know, of course, that the Kingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable place; and if you are a thoughtful child--as of course you are--you will not need me to tell you what was the most remarkable thing about it. But in case you are not a thoughtful child--and it is just possible of course that you are not--I will tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was. _All the animals were the wrong sizes!_ And this was how it happened.",read know course remarkable place thoughtful child course need tell remarkable thing case thoughtful child possible course tell remarkable thing animal wrong size happen 
13,"In old, old, olden times, when all our world was just loose earth and air and fire and water mixed up anyhow like a pudding, and spinning around like mad trying to get the different things to settle into their proper places, a round piece of earth got loose and went spinning away by itself across the water, which was just beginning to try to get spread out smooth into a real sea. And as the great round piece of earth flew away, going around and around as hard as it could, it met a long piece of hard rock that had got loose from another part of the puddingy mixture, and the rock was so hard, and was going so fast, that it ran its point through the round piece of earth and stuck out on the other side of it, so that the two together were like a very-very-much-too-big spinning top.",old old olden time world loose earth air fire water mix pudding spinn mad try get different thing settle proper place round piece earth get loose go spinn water begin try spread smooth real sea great round piece earth fly go meet long piece hard rock get loose part puddingy mixture rock hard go run point round piece earth stick other side much big spinning top

15,"Well, when the pointed rock smashed into the round bit of earth the shock was so great that it set them spinning together through the air--which was just getting into its proper place, like all the rest of the things--only, as luck would have it, they forgot which way around they had been going, and began to spin around the wrong way. Presently Center of Gravity--a great giant who was managing the whole business--woke up in the middle of the earth and began to grumble.",point rock smash round bit earth shock great set spinn air get proper place rest thing luck have forget way go begin spin wrong way great giant manage whole business wake middle earth begin grumble 
16,"""Hurry up,"" he said. ""Come down and lie still, can't you?""",hurry say come lie 
17,"So the rock with the round piece of earth fell into the sea, and the point of the rock went into a hole that just fitted it in the stony sea bottom, and there it spun around the wrong way seven times and then lay still. And that round piece of land became, after millions of years, the Kingdom of Rotundia.",rock round piece earth fall sea point rock go hole fit stony sea bottom spun wrong way time lay round piece land become million year 
18,"This is the end of the geography lesson. And now for just a little natural history, so that we may not feel that we are quite wasting our time. Of course, the consequence of the island having spun around the wrong way was that when the animals began to grow on the island they all grew the wrong sizes. The guinea pig, as you know, was as big as our elephants, and the elephant--dear little pet--was the size of the silly, tiny, black-and-tan dogs that ladies carry sometimes in their muffs. The rabbits were about the size of our rhinoceroses, and all about the wild parts of the island they had made their burrows as big as railway tunnels. The dormouse, of course, was the biggest of all the creatures. I can't tell you how big he was. Even if you think of elephants it will not help you at all. Luckily there was only one of him, and he was always asleep. Otherwise I don't think the Rotundians could have borne with him. As it was, they made him a house, and it saved the expense of a brass band, because no band could possibly have been heard when the dormouse was talking in his sleep.",end geography lesson little natural history feel waste time course consequence island spun wrong way animal begin grow island grow wrong size guinea pig know big elephant elephant dear little pet size silly tiny black tan dog lady carry muff rabbit size rhinocerose wild part island make burrow big railway tunnel dormouse course big creature tell big think elephant help be asleep think borne make house save expense brass band band hear dormouse talk sleep

20,"Now the natural history lesson is over, and if you have been attending, you know more about Rotundia than anyone there did, except three people: the Lord Chief Schoolmaster, the Princess's uncle--who was a magician, and knew everything without learning it--and Tom, the gardener's son.",natural history lesson attend know more person chief uncle magician know learn gardener son 
21,"Tom had learned more at school than anyone else, because he wished to take a prize. The prize offered by the Lord Chief Schoolmaster was a _History of Rotundia_, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the back. But after that day when the Princess said she meant to marry Tom, the gardener's boy thought it over, and he decided that the best prize in the world would be the Princess, and this was the prize Tom meant to take; and when you are a gardener's son and have decided to marry a Princess, you will find that the more you learn at school the better.",learn more school else wish take prize prize offer chief _history bind royal arm back day say mean marry gardener boy think decide good prize world prize mean take gardener son decide marry find more learn school good 
22,"The Princess always played with Tom on the days when the little dukes and marquises did not come to tea--and when he told her he was almost sure of the first prize, she clapped her hands and said: ""Dear Tom, dear good, clever Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet elephant--and you can keep him till we're married.""",play day little duke marquise come tea tell sure first prize clapp hand say dear dear good clever deserve prize give pet elephant keep married 
23,"The pet elephant was called Fido, and the gardener's son took him away in his coat pocket. He was the dearest little elephant you ever saw--about six inches long. But he was very, very wise--he could not have been wiser if he had been a mile high. He lay down comfortably in Tom's pocket, and when Tom put in his hand, Fido curled his little trunk around Tom's fingers with an affectionate confidence that made the boy's heart warm to his new little pet. What with the elephant, and the Princess's affection, and the knowledge that the very next day he would receive the _History of Rotundia_, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the cover, Tom could hardly sleep a wink. And, besides, the dog did bark so terribly. There was only one dog in Rotundia--the kingdom could not afford to keep more than one: He was a Mexican lapdog of the kind that in most parts of the world only measures seven inches from the end of his dear nose to the tip of his darling tail--but in Rotundia he was bigger than I can possibly expect you to believe. And when he barked, his bark was so large that it filled up all the night and left no room for sleep or dreams or polite conversation, or anything else at all. He never barked at things that went on in the island--he was too large-minded for that; but when ships went blundering by in the dark, tumbling over the rocks at the end of the island, he would bark once or twice, just to let the ships know that they couldn't come playing about there just as they liked.",pet elephant call gardener son take coat pocket dearest little elephant see inch long wise wise mile high lay pocket put hand curl little trunk finger affectionate confidence make boy heart warm new little pet elephant affection knowledge next day receive bind royal arm cover sleep wink dog bark be dog kingdom afford keep more mexican lapdog kind most part world measure inch end dear nose tip darling tail big expect believe bark bark large fill night leave room sleep dream polite conversation else bark thing go island large minded ship go blunder dark tumble rock end island bark let ship know come play like 
24,"But on this particular night he barked and barked and barked--and the Princess said, ""Oh dear, oh dear, I wish he wouldn't, I am so sleepy."" And Tom said to himself, ""I wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as it's light I'll go and see.""",particular night bark bark bark say dear wish sleepy say wonder matter light go see 
25,"So when it began to be pretty pink-and-yellow daylight, Tom got up and went out. And all the time the Mexican lapdog barked so that the houses shook, and the tiles on the roof of the palace rattled like milk cans in a cart whose horse is frisky.",begin pink yellow daylight get go time mexican lapdog bark house shake tile roof palace rattle milk can cart horse frisky 
26,"""I'll go to the pillar,"" thought Tom, as he went through the town. The pillar, of course, was the top of the piece of rock that had stuck itself through Rotundia millions of years before, and made it spin around the wrong way. It was quite in the middle of the island, and stuck up ever so far, and when you were at the top you could see a great deal farther than when you were not.",go pillar think go town pillar course top piece rock stick million year make spin wrong way middle island stick top see great deal 
27,"As Tom went out from the town and across the downs, he thought what a pretty sight it was to see the rabbits in the bright, dewy morning, frisking with their young ones by the mouths of their burrows. He did not go very near the rabbits, of course, because when a rabbit of that size is at play it does not always look where it is going, and it might easily have crushed Tom with its foot, and then it would have been very sorry afterward. And Tom was a kind boy, and would not have liked to make even a rabbit unhappy. Earwigs in our country often get out of the way when they think you are going to walk on them. They too have kind hearts, and they would not like you to be sorry afterward.",go town down think pretty sight see rabbit bright dewy morning frisk young one mouth burrow go rabbit course rabbit size play look go crush foot sorry kind boy like make rabbit unhappy earwig country get way think go walk have kind heart like sorry 
28,"So Tom went on, looking at the rabbits and watching the morning grow more and more red and golden. And the Mexican lapdog barked all the time, till the church bells tinkled, and the chimney of the apple factory rocked again.",go look rabbit watch morning grow more red golden mexican lapdog bark time church bell tinkle chimney apple factory rock 
29,"But when Tom got to the pillar, he saw that he would not need to climb to the top to find out what the dog was barking at.",get pillar see need climb top find dog bark 
30,"For there, by the pillar, lay a very large purple dragon. His wings were like old purple umbrellas that have been very much rained on, and his head was large and bald, like the top of a purple toadstool, and his tail, which was purple too, was very, very, very long and thin and tight, like the lash of a carriage whip.",pillar lay large purple dragon wing old purple umbrella rain head large bald top purple toadstool tail purple long thin tight lash carriage whip 
31,"It was licking one of its purple umbrella-y wings, and every now and then it moaned and leaned its head back against the rocky pillar as though it felt faint. Tom saw at once what had happened. A flight of purple dragons must have crossed the island in the night, and this poor one must have knocked its wing and broken it against the pillar.",lick purple umbrella-y wing moan learn head rocky pillar feel faint see happen flight purple dragon cross island night poor one knock wing break pillar 
32,"Everyone is kind to everyone in Rotundia, and Tom was not afraid of the dragon, although he had never spoken to one before. He had often watched them flying across the sea, but he had never expected to get to know one personally.",kind afraid dragon speak watch fly sea expect get know 
33,"So now he said: ""I am afraid you don't feel quite well.""",say afraid feel 
34,"The dragon shook his large purple head. He could not speak, but like all other animals, he could understand well enough when he liked.",dragon shake large purple head speak other animal understand like 
35,"""Can I get you anything?"" asked Tom, politely.",get ask 
36,The dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring smile.,dragon open purple eye inquire smile 
37,"""A bun or two, now,"" said Tom, coaxingly. ""There's a beautiful bun tree quite close.""",bun say be beautiful bun tree close 
38,"The dragon opened a great purple mouth and licked his purple lips, so Tom ran and shook the bun tree, and soon came back with an armful of fresh currant buns, and as he came he picked a few of the Bath kind, which grow on the low bushes near the pillar.",dragon open great purple mouth lick purple lip run shake bun tree come armful fresh currant bun come pick few kind grow low bush pillar 
39,"Because, of course, another consequence of the island's having spun the wrong way is that all the things we have to make--buns and cakes and shortbread--grow on trees and bushes, but in Rotundia they have to make their cauliflowers and cabbages and carrots and apples and onions, just as our cooks make puddings and turnovers.",course consequence island spun wrong way thing have make bun cake shortbread grow tree bush have make cauliflower cabbage carrot apple onion cook make pudding turnover 
40,"Tom gave all the buns to the dragon, saying: ""Here, try to eat a little. You'll soon feel better then.""",give bun dragon say try eat little feel good 
41,"The dragon ate up the buns, nodded rather ungraciously, and began to lick his wing again. So Tom left him and went back to the town with the news, and everyone was so excited at a real live dragon's being on the island--a thing that had never happened before--that they all went out to look at it, instead of going to the prize-giving, and the Lord Chief Schoolmaster went with the rest. Now, he had Tom's prize, the _History of Rotundia_, in his pocket--the one bound in calf, with the Royal arms on the cover--and it happened to drop out, and the dragon ate it, so Tom never got the prize after all. But the dragon, when he had gotten it, did not like it.",dragon eat bun nod begin lick wing leave go town news excited real live dragon island thing happen go look go prize give chief go rest have prize pocket one bind calf royal arm cover happen drop dragon eat get prize dragon get like 
42,"""Perhaps it's all for the best,"" said Tom. ""I might not have liked that prize either, if I had gotten it.""",good say like prize get 
43,"It happened to be a Wednesday, so when the Princess's friends were asked what they would like to do, all the little dukes and marquises and earls said, ""Let's go and see the dragon."" But the little duchesses and marchionesses and countesses said they were afraid.",happen friend ask like do little duke marquise earl say let go see dragon little duchess marchioness countess say afraid 
44,"Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, ""Don't be silly, because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of, unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops."" So they went. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon with acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much of his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very, very long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his tail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, ""Oh, you nice, kind, pretty little Princess."" But deep down in his wicked purple heart he was saying, ""Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like to eat you instead of these silly acid drops."" But of course nobody heard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and accustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade.",speak say silly fairy story history thing person unkind want hurt other kind have afraid naughty know own good let go see dragon take acid drop go title child take turn feed dragon acid drop seem pleased flattered wagg much purple tail get long tail come turn give acid drop dragon smile wide smile wagg tail very last long inch much say nice kind little princess wicked purple heart say nice fat little like eat silly acid drop course hear uncle magician accustom listen door part trade 
45,"Now, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete Bad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you know from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the _Babes in the Wood_, or the _Norfolk Tragedy_, and one James at least was bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone is a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you need not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete Bad--and he will come to no good.",remember tell be wicked person conceal complete magician bad know fairy book uncle bad see least bad learn english history magician uncle name expect nice threefold complete come good 
46,"Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the kingdom to himself. He did not like many things--a nice kingdom was almost the only thing he cared for--but he had never seen his way quite clearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will not work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a duck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance for him--because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the island who could stand by each other--himself and the dragon. He said nothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and everyone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance except Tom.",want get rid have kingdom like many thing nice kingdom only thing care see way kind wicked spell work run blameless islander water duck back think be chance know be wicked person island stand other dragon say exchange meaningful glance dragon go tea see meaningful glance 
47,"Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent little creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to the table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had given Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant pointed out a date--the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday, and looked anxiously at its master.",go tell elephant intelligent little creature listen climb knee table stand ornamental calendar give present tiny trunk elephant point date fifteenth birthday look master

50,"[""By-and-by he began to wander."" _See page 29._]",begin wander see page 
51,"At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who lived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he began to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great rabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long, tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and before they had time to say, ""There he goes,"" his ugly purple head would come poking out from another rabbit-hole--perhaps just behind them--or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's laugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't know what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing blind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the habit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on people's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you know how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public kingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were nothing much at first--a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two, and some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say, but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of the Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then came a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had barked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown quite used to the noise.

82,"""Yes,"" Tom cried. ""Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless exile shall have the Princess--if he can catch her. Now then, Mary Ann.""",cry fair play jewel helpless exile have catch 
83,"Mary Ann looked around the big pillar and called to the dragon: ""Bo! you can't catch me,"" and began to run as fast as ever she could, and the dragon ran after her. When the Princess had run a half mile she stopped, dodged around a tree, and ran back to the pillar and around it, and the dragon after her. You see, he was so long he could not turn as quickly as she could. Around and around the pillar ran the Princess. The first time she ran around a long way from the pillar, and then nearer and nearer--with the dragon after her all the time; and he was so busy trying to catch her that he never noticed that Tom had tied the very end of his long, tight, whipcordy tail to the rock, so that the more the dragon ran around, the more times he twisted his tail around the pillar. It was exactly like winding a top--only the peg was the pillar, and the dragon's tail was the string. And the magician was safe between the Belgian hares, and couldn't see anything but darkness, or do anything but choke.",look big pillar call dragon catch begin run dragon run run half mile stop dodg tree run pillar dragon see turn pillar run first time run long way pillar nearer dragon time busy try catch notice tie very end long tight whipcordy tail rock dragon run more time twist tail pillar wind top peg pillar dragon tail string magician safe belgian hare see darkness do choke 
84,"When the dragon was wound onto the pillar as much as he possibly could be, and as tight--like cotton on a reel--the Princess stopped running, and though she had very little breath left, she managed to say, ""Yah--who's won now?""",dragon wind pillar much tight cotton reel stop run have little breath leave manage say win 
85,"This annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his strength--spread his great purple wings, and tried to fly at her. Of course this pulled his tail, and pulled it very hard, so hard that as he pulled the tail _had_ to come, and the pillar _had_ to come around with the tail, and the island _had_ to come around with the pillar, and in another minute the tail was loose, and the island was spinning around exactly like a top. It spun so fast that everyone fell flat on their faces and held on tight to themselves, because they felt something was going to happen. All but the magician, who was choking between the Belgian hares, and felt nothing but fur and fury.",annoy dragon much put strength spread great purple wing try fly course pull tail pull pull tail _had_ come pillar _had_ come tail island _had_ come pillar minute tail loose island spinn top spun fall flat face hold tight feel go happen magician choke belgian hare feel fur fury 
86,"And something did happen. The dragon had sent the kingdom of Rotundia spinning the way it ought to have gone at the beginning of the world, and as it spun around, all the animals began to change sizes. The guinea pigs got small, and the elephants got big, and the men and women and children would have changed sizes too, if they had not had the sense to hold on to themselves, very tight indeed, with both hands; which, of course, the animals could not be expected to know how to do. And the best of it was that when the small beasts got big and the big beasts got small the dragon got small too, and fell at the Princess's feet--a little, crawling, purple newt with wings.",happen dragon send kingdom spinn way go beginning world spun animal begin change size guinea pig get small elephant get big man woman child change size have sense hold tight hand course animal expect know do good small beast get big big beast get small dragon get small fall foot little crawl purple newt wing

89,"But while all the people were still on their faces, holding on tight to themselves, Uncle James, the magician, never thought of holding tight--he only thought of how to punish Belgian hares and the sons of gardeners; so when the big beasts grew small, he grew small with the other beasts, and the little purple dragon, when he fell at the Princess's feet, saw there a very small magician named Uncle James. And the dragon took him because it wanted a birthday present.",person face hold tight magician think hold tight think punish belgian hare son gardener big beast grow small grow small other beast little purple dragon fall foot see small magician name dragon take want birthday present

91,"All this happened several years ago, and the other day I saw in the _Rotundia Times_ an account of the wedding of the Princess with Lord Thomas Gardener, K.C.D., and I knew she could not have married anyone but Tom, so I suppose they made him a Lord on purpose for the wedding--and _K.C.D._, of course, means Clever Conqueror of the Dragon. If you think that is wrong it is only because you don't know how they spell in Rotundia. The paper said that among the beautiful presents of the bridegroom to the bride was an enormous elephant, on which the bridal pair made their wedding tour. This must have been Fido. You remember Tom promised to give him back to the Princess when they were married. The _Rotundia Times_ called the married couple ""the happy pair."" It was clever of the paper to think of calling them that--it is such a pretty and novel expression, and I think it is truer than many of the things you see in papers.",happen several year other day see account wedding know marry suppose make purpose wedding course mean clever think wrong know spell paper say beautiful present bridegroom bride enormous elephant bridal pair make wedding tour remember promise give marry call marry couple happy pair clever paper think call pretty novel expression think truer many thing see paper 
92,"Because, you see, the Princess and the gardener's son were so fond of each other they could not help being happy--and besides, they had an elephant of their very own to ride on. If that is not enough to make people happy, I should like to know what is. Though, of course, I know there are some people who could not be happy unless they had a whale to sail on, and perhaps not even then. But they are greedy, grasping people, the kind who would take four helps of pudding, as likely as not, which neither Tom nor Mary Ann ever did.",see gardener son fond other help happy have elephant very own ride enough make person happy like know course know be person happy have whale sail greedy grasp person kind take help pudding likely
