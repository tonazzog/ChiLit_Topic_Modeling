1,CHAPTER XIII. _Surprises_,
2,"THE prince said nothing, the ambassador said nothing, Lady Rosalind said never a word till they were in the drawing-room. It was a lovely warm evening, and the French windows were wide open on the balcony, which looked over the town and away north to the hills. Below them flowed the clear, green water of the Gluckthal And still nobody said a word. At last the prince spoke: “This is a very strange story, Lord Kelso!”",prince say ambassador say say word draw room lovely warm evening french window wide open balcony look town hill flow clear green water say word last prince speak strange story 
3,"“Very, sir!” said the ambassador. “But true,” added the prince; “at least, there is no reason in the nature of things why it shouldn’t be true.”",sir say ambassador true add prince least be reason nature thing true 
4,"“I can hardly believe, sir, that the conduct of Benson, whom I always found a most respectable man, deserved--”",believe sir conduct find respectable man deserve 
5,"“That he should be ‘come for,’” said the prince. “Oh, no; it was a mere accident, and might have happened to any of us who chanced to sit down on my carpet.”",come say prince mere accident happen chance sit carpet 
6,"And then the prince told them, shortly, all about it: how the carpet was one of a number of fairy properties, which had been given him at his christening; and how so long a time had gone by before he discovered them; and how, probably, the carpet had carried the butler where he had said he wanted to go--namely, to the king’s Court at Falkenstein.",prince tell carpet number fairy property give christening time go discover carpet carry butler say want go king 
7,"“It would not matter so much,” added the prince, “only I had relied on making my peace with his majesty, my father, by aid of those horns and that tail. He was set on getting them; and if the Lady Rosalind had not expressed a wish for them, they would to-day have been in his possession.”",matter add prince rely make peace majesty father aid horn tail set get express wish day possession 
8,"“Oh, sir, you honour us too highly,” murmured Lady Rosalind; and the prince blushed and said:",sir honour murmure prince blush say 
9,“Not at all! Impossible!”,impossible 
10,"Then, of course, the ambassador became quite certain that his daughter was admired by the crown prince, who was on bad terms with the king of the country; and a more uncomfortable position for an ambassador--however, they are used to them.",course ambassador become certain daughter admire crown prince bad term king country uncomfortable position ambassador use 
11,"“What on earth am I to do with the young man?” he thought. “He can’t stay here for ever; and without his carpet he can’t get away, for the soldiers have orders to seize him as soon as he appears in the street. And in the meantime Benson will be pretending that _he_ killed the Firedrake--for he must have got to Falkenstein by now,--and they will be for marrying him to the king’s niece, and making my butler crown prince to the kingdom of Pantouflia! It is dreadful!”",earth do young man think stay carpet get soldier have order seize appear street meantime pretend kill get marry king niece make butler crown prince kingdom dreadful 
12,"Now all this time the prince was on the balcony, telling Lady Rosalind all about how he got the Firedrake done for, in the most modest way; for, as he said: “I didn’t kill him: and it is really the Remora, poor fellow, who should marry Molly; but he ‘s dead.”",time prince balcony tell get do modest way say kill poor fellow marry dead 
13,"At this very moment there was a _whizz_ in the air; something shot past them, and, through the open window, the king, the queen, Benson, and the mortal remains of the Firedrake were shot into the ambassador’s drawing room!",very moment be _whizz_ air shoot open window king queen mortal remains shoot ambassador draw room
