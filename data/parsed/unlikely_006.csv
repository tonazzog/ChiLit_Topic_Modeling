1,BOOK 6. _FORTUNATUS REX & CO._,
2," THERE was once a lady who found herself in middle life with but a slight income. Knowing herself to be insufficiently educated to be able to practise any other trade or calling, she of course decided, without hesitation, to enter the profession of teaching. She opened a very select Boarding School for Young Ladies. The highest references were given and required. And in order to keep her school as select as possible, Miss Fitzroy Robinson had a brass plate fastened on to the door, with an inscription in small polite lettering. (You have, of course, heard of the “polite letters.” Well, it was with these that Miss Fitzroy Robinson’s door-plate was engraved.)",lady find middle life slight income know educate able practise other trade calling course decide hesitation enter profession teaching open select boarding young high reference give require order keep school select possible have brass plate fasten door inscription small polite lettering course hear polite letter door plate engrave

4,"A great many kings who were not at all respectable would have given their royal ears to be allowed to send their daughters to this school, but Miss Fitzroy Robinson was very firm about references, and the consequence was that all the really high-class kings were only too pleased to be permitted to pay ten thousand pounds a year for their daughters’ education. And so Miss Fitzroy Robinson was able to lay aside a few pounds as a provision for her old age. And all the money she saved was invested in land.",great many king respectable give royal ear allow send daughter school firm reference consequence high class king pleased permit pay pound year daughter education able lay few pound provision old age money save invest land 
5,"Only one monarch refused to send his daughter to Miss Fitzroy Robinson, on the ground that so cheap a school could not be a really select one, and it was found out afterwards that his references were not at all satisfactory.",monarch refuse send daughter ground cheap school select one find reference satisfactory 
6,"There were only six boarders, and of course the best masters were engaged to teach the royal pupils everything which their parents wished them to learn, and as the girls were never asked to do lessons except when they felt quite inclined, they all said it was the nicest school in the world, and cried at the very thought of being taken away. Thus it happened that the six pupils were quite grown up and were just becoming parlour boarders when events began to occur. Princess Daisy, the daughter of King Fortunatus, the ruling sovereign, was the only little girl in the school.",be border course good master engage teach royal pupil parent wish learn girl ask do lesson feel inclined say nice school world cry very thought take happen pupil grow become parlour border event begin occur daughter ruling sovereign only little girl school

9,"But when she looked at the card she left off fluttering, and said, “Dear me!” under her breath, because she was very genteel. If she had been vulgar like some of us she would have said “Bother!” and if she had been more vulgar than, I hope, any of us are, she might have said “Drat the man!” The card was large and shiny and had gold letters on it.

11,"Miss Fitzroy Robinson laid down her book—she never taught without a book—smoothed her yellow cap and her grey curls and went into the front parlour to see her visitor.

He was very tall and hungry-looking, with black eyes, and an indescribable mouth.",lay book teach book smooth yellow cap grey curl go front parlour see visitor bow low sight tall hungry look black eye indescribable mouth

May I hope for an engagement as Professor in your Academy?”",travel say smile increase stock wisdom dear lady live learn competent teacher have honour instruct hope engagement

25,"“Well, I never!” said Miss Fitzroy Robinson. She hastened to the top of the house and hurried down the schoolroom chimney, which had been made with steps, in case of fire or other emergency. She stepped out of the grate on to the schoolroom hearthrug just one second too late. The seven Princesses were all gone, and the Professor of Magic stood alone among the ink-stained desks, smiling the largest smile Miss Fitzroy Robinson had seen yet.",say hasten top house hurry schoolroom chimney make step case fire other emergency step grate schoolroom hearthrug second late gone stand ink stain desk smile large smile see

The servant who opened the door had a coarse apron on and cinders in her hair, and the King thought it was sackcloth and ashes, and said so a little anxiously, but the girl said, “No, I’ve only been a-doing of the kitchen range—though, for the matter of that—but you’d best see missus herself.”",next day country call usual take daughter spend half holiday servant open door have coarse apron cinder hair think sackcloth ash say little girl say do kitchen range matter see missus

33,"The King sat down heavily on part of the handsome walnut and rep suite (ladies’ and gentlemen’s easy-chairs, couch and six occasional chairs) and gasped miserably. He could not find words.

51,"The Queen was much more broken-hearted than the King, but of course she had the housekeeping to see to and the making of the pickles and preserves and the young Prince’s stockings to knit, so she had not much time for weeping, and after a year she said to the King—",break hearted course have housekeeping see making pickle preserve young stocking knit have much time weeping year say

53,"“I am frightened of bazaars,” said the King; “they are like bees—they buzz and worry; but foundation stones——” And after that he began to sit and think sometimes, without crying, and to make notes on the backs of old envelopes. So the Queen felt that she had not spoken quite in vain.",frighten bazaar say bee buzz worry foundation stone begin sit think cry make note back old envelope feel speak vain

57,"They bought all the pretty woods and fields they could get and cut them up into squares, and grubbed up the trees and the grass and put streets there and lamp-posts and ugly little yellow brick houses, in the hopes that people would want to live in them. And curiously enough people did. So the King and his Co. made quite a lot of money.",buy pretty wood field get cut square grubb tree grass put street lamp post ugly little yellow brick house hope person want live enough person make lot money

59,"The ugly little streets crawled further and further out of the town, eating up the green country like greedy yellow caterpillars, but at the foot of the Clover Hill they had to stop. For the owner of Clover Hill would not sell any land at all—for any price that Fortunatus Rex & Co. could offer. In vain the solicitors of the Company called on the solicitors of the owner, wearing their best cloaks and swords and shields, and took them out to lunch and gave them nice things to eat and drink. Clover Hill was not for sale.",ugly little street crawl town eat green country greedy yellow caterpillar foot have stop owner sell land price offer vain solicitor company call solicitor owner wear good cloak sword shield take lunch give nice thing eat drink sale

61,"“I am the owner of Clover Hill,” said she, “and you may build on all its acres except the seven at the top and the fifteen acres that go round that seven, and you must build me a high wall round the seven acres and another round the fifteen—of _red_ brick, mind; none of your cheap yellow stuff—and you must make a brand new law that any one who steals my fruit is to be hanged from the tree he stole it from. That’s all. What do you say?”",owner say build acre top acre go build high wall acre brick mind cheap yellow stuff make brand new law one steal fruit hang tree steal say 
62,"The King said “Yes,” because since his trouble he cared for nothing but building, and his royal soul longed to see the green Clover Hill eaten up by yellow brick caterpillars with slate tops. He did not at all like building the two red brick walls, but he did it.",say trouble care building royal soul long see green eat yellow brick caterpillar slate top build red brick wall do

64," But it was such a bother getting the exact amount of ground into the two circles that all the surveyors tore out their hair by handfuls, and at last the King said, “Oh bother! Do it this way,” and drew a plan on the back of an old Act of Parliament. So they did, and it was like this—",bother get exact amount ground circle surveyor tore hair handful last say bother do way draw plan back old

66," The old lady was very vexed when she found that there was only one wall between her orchard and the world, as you see was the case at the corner where the two 1’s and the 15 meet; but the King said he couldn’t afford to build it all over again and that she’d got her two walls as she had said. So she had to put up with it. Only she insisted on the King’s getting her a fierce bull-dog to fly at the throat of any one who should come over the wall at that weak point where the two 1’s join on to the 15. So he got her a stout bull-dog whose name was Martha, and brought it himself in a jewelled leash.",old lady vexed find be wall orchard world see case corner 1’s meet say afford build get wall say have put insist get fierce bull dog fly throat one come wall weak point 1’s join get stout bull dog name bring jewell leash

75,"Now, of course, you will not need to be told that these six Princes were looking for the six grown-up Princesses who had been so happy at the Select Boarding Establishment.

The wax fruit under the glass shade still showed attractively through the dusty panes. The six Princes looked through the window by turns. They were charmed with the furniture, and the refining touch of a woman’s hand drew them like a magnet. They took the house, but they had their meals at the Palace by the King’s special invitation.",get select respectable house close card window say desirable villa residence let moderate term furnish wax fruit glass shade show dusty pane look window turn charm furniture refine touch woman hand draw magnet take house have meal special invitation 
77,"King Fortunatus told the Princes the dreadful story of the disappearance of the entire Select School; and each Prince swore by his sword-hilt and his honour that he would find out the particular Princess that he was to marry, or perish in the attempt.

It said, “Open up Africa!”",first night spend furnish house pass do second third fourth fifth sixth seventh night sit play spilikin schoolroom hear voice say open
