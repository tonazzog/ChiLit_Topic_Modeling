14,"The Alcestis had taken fire on the 12th of April of the former year. There had been much admirable conduct, and the intrepid coolness of Mr. Ernescliffe was especially recorded. The boats had been put off without loss, but they were scantily provisioned, and the nearest land was far distant. For five days the boats kept together, then followed a night of storms, and, when morning dawned, the second cutter, under command of Mr. Ernescliffe, had disappeared. There could be no doubt that she had sunk, and the captain could only record his regrets for the loss the service had experienced in the three brave young officers and their gallant seamen. After infinite toil and suffering, the captain, with the other boats’ crews, had reached Tahiti, whence they had made their way home.",take fire 12th former year be much admirable conduct intrepid coolness record boat put loss provision near land distant day boat keep follow night storm morning dawn second cutter command disappear be doubt sink captain record regret loss service experience brave young officer gallant seamen infinite toil suffering captain other boat crew reach make way

23,"Dr. Spencer entered the drawing-room with Ethel, who tried to read his face as he saw Margaret--restored, as it seemed, to all her girlish bloom, and her eyes sparkling as they were lifted up, far beyond the present scene. Ethel had a moment’s sense that his expression was as if he had seen a death-blow struck, but it was gone in a moment, as he gently shook Margaret by the hand, and spoke a word of greeting, as though to recall her.",enter draw room try read face see restore seem girlish bloom eye sparkling lift present scene have moment sense expression see death blow strike gone moment shake hand speak word greeting recall

I will find your father, and bring him home.” Pressing her hand he departed.",turn head hide face sign natural state say afraid find father bring press hand depart 
29,"Margaret was weeping tranquilly--Ethel knelt down beside her, without daring at first to speak, but sending up intense mental prayers to Him, who alone could bear her or her dear father through their affliction. Then she ventured to take her hand, and Margaret returned the caress, but began to blame herself for the momentary selfishness that had allowed her brother’s loss and her father’s grief to have been forgotten in her own. Ethel’s “oh! no! no!” did not console her for this which seemed the most present sorrow, but the flow of tears was so gentle, that Ethel trusted that they were a relief. Ethel herself seemed only able to watch her, and to fear for her father, not to be able to think for herself.",weep knolt dare first speak send intense mental prayer bear dear father affliction venture take hand return caress begin blame momentary selfishness allow brother loss father grief forget own console seem present sorrow flow tear gentle trust relief seem able watch fear father able think

48,"Blanche and Gertrude came from the schoolroom, where Miss Bracy seemed to have been occupying them, with much kindness and judgment. She came to the door to ask Ethel anxiously for the doctor and Miss May, and looked so affectionate and sympathising, that Ethel gave her a hearty kiss.",come schoolroom seem occupy much kindness judgment come door ask doctor look affectionate sympathise give hearty kiss

51,"Dr. May gathered his children round him, and took out the great Prayer-book. He read a psalm and a prayer from the Burial Service, and the sentence for funerals at sea. Then he touched each of their heads, and, in short broken sentences, gave thanks for those still left to him, and for the blessed hope they could feel for those who were gone; and he prayed that they might so follow in their footsteps, as to come to the same holy place, and in the meantime realise the Communion of Saints. Then they said the Lord’s Prayer, he blessed them, and they arose.",gather child take great prayer book read psalm prayer sentence funeral sea touch head short break sentence give thanks leave bless hope feel gone pray follow footstep come same holy place meantime realise say bless arise

65,"The large Bible lay beside him on the table, and Dr. Spencer thought that he would find more rest there than in his words. Leaving him, therefore, his friend went to undertake his day’s work, and learn, once more, in the anxious inquiries and saddened countenances of the patients and their friends, how great an amount of love and sympathy that Dr. May had won by his own warmth of heart. The patients seemed to forget their complaints in sighs for their kind doctor’s troubles; and the gouty Mayor of Stoneborough kept Dr. Spencer half an hour to listen to his recollections of the bright-faced boy’s droll tricks, and then to the praises of the whole May family, and especially of the mother.",large lay table think find more rest word leave friend go undertake day work learn anxious inquiry sadden countenance patient friend great amount love sympathy win own warmth heart patient seem forget complaint sigh kind doctor trouble gouty keep hour listen recollection bright face boy droll trick praise whole family mother

67,"Ethel wrote letters to her brothers; and Dr. May added a few lines, begging Richard to come home, if only for a few days. Margaret would not be denied writing to Hector Ernescliffe, though she cried over her letter so much that her father could almost have taken her pen away; but she said it did her good.",write letter brother add few line begg come few day deny writing cry letter much father take pen say do good 
68,"When Flora came in the afternoon, Ethel was able to leave Margaret to her, and attend to Mary, with whom Miss Bracy’s kindness had been inefficacious. If she was cheered for a few minutes, some association, either with the past or the vanished future, soon set her off sobbing again. “If I only knew where dear, dear Harry is lying,” she sobbed, “and that it had not been very bad indeed, I could bear it better.”",come afternoon able leave attend kindness inefficacious cheer few minute association past vanish future set sobb know dear dear lie sobb bad bear good

It was like losing Harry over again, to go to bed without it, though she would not for the world seem to grudge it to her father.",discover sharp trouble fond simple girl deprivation precious photograph lose go bed world seem grudge father 
75,"Ethel found an opportunity of telling him of this distress, and it almost made him smile. “Poor Mary,” he said, “is she so fond of it? It is rather a libel than a likeness.”",find opportunity tell distress make smile poor say fond libel likeness 
76,"“Don’t say so to her, pray, papa. It is all the world to her. Three strokes on paper would have been the same, if they had been called by his name.”",say pray papa world stroke paper same call name

78,"He did not forget to restore the treasure with gratitude proportionate to what the loan had cost Mary. With a trembling voice, she proffered it to him for the whole day, and every day, if she might only have it at night; and she even looked black when he did not accept the proposal.",forget restore treasure gratitude proportionate loan cost tremble voice proffer whole day day have night look black accept proposal

82,"A letter soon arrived from Captain Gordon, giving a fuller account of the loss of his ship, and of the conduct of his officers, speaking in the highest terms of Alan Ernescliffe, for whom he said he mourned as for his own son, and, with scarcely less warmth, of Harry, mentioning the high esteem all had felt for the boy, and the good effect which the influence of his high and truthful spirit had produced on the other youngsters, who keenly regretted him.",letter arrive give fuller account loss ship conduct officer speak high term say mourn own son less warmth mention high esteem feel boy good effect influence high truthful spirit produce other youngster regret 
83,"Captain Gordon added that the will of the late Captain Ernescliffe had made him guardian of his sons, and that he believed poor Alan had died intestate. He should therefore take upon himself the charge of young Hector, and he warmly thanked Dr. May and his family for all the kindness that the lad had received.",add will late make guardian son believe poor die intestate take charge young thank family kindness lad receive 
84,"Though the loss of poor Hector’s visits was regretted, it was, on the whole, a comforting letter, and would give still more comfort in future time.",loss poor visit regret whole comforting letter give more comfort future time 
85,"Richard contrived to come home through Oxford and see Norman, whom he found calm, and almost relieved by the cessation from suspense; not inclined, as his father had feared, to drown sorrow in labour, but regarding his grief as an additional call to devote himself to ministerial work. In fact, the blow had fallen when he first heard the rumour of danger, and could not recur with the same force.",contrive come see find calm relieve cessation suspense inclined father fear drown sorrow labour regard grief additional call devote ministerial work fact blow fall hear rumour danger recur same force 
86,"Richard was surprised to find that Margaret was less cast down than he could have dared to hope. It did not seem like an affliction to her. Her countenance wore the same gentle smile, and she was as ready to participate in all that passed, finding sympathy for the little pleasures of Aubrey and Gertrude, and delighting in Flora’s baby; as well as going over Cocksmoor politics with a clearness and accuracy that astonished him, and asking questions about his parish and occupations, so as fully to enjoy his short visit, which she truly called the greatest possible treat.",surprise find cast dare hope seem affliction countenance wear same gentle smile ready participate pass find sympathy little pleasure delight baby go politics clearness accuracy astonished ask question parish occupation enjoy short visit call great possible treat 
87,"If it had not been for the momentary consternation that she had seen upon Dr. Spencer’s face, Ethel would have been perfectly satisfied; but she could not help sometimes entertaining a dim fancy that this composure came from a sense that she was too near Alan to mourn for him. Could it be true that her frame was more wasted, that there was less capability of exertion, that her hours became later in the morning, and that her nights were more wakeful? Would she fade away? Ethel longed to know what her father thought, but she could neither bear to inspire him with the apprehension, nor to ask Dr. Spencer’s opinion, lest she should be confirmed in her own.",momentary consternation see face satisfied help entertaining dim fancy composure come sense mourn true frame waste be less capability exertion hour become morning night wakeful fade long know father think bear inspire apprehension ask opinion confirm own 
88,"The present affliction altered Dr. May more visibly than the death of his wife, perhaps, because there was not the same need of exertion. If he often rose high in faith and resignation, he would also sink very low under the sense of bereavement and disappointment. Though Richard was his stay, and Norman his pride, there was something in Harry more congenial to his own temper, and he could not but be bowed down by the ruin of such bright hopes. With all his real submission, he was weak, and gave way to outbursts of grief, for which he blamed himself as unthankful; and his whole demeanour was so saddened and depressed, that Ethel and Dr. Spencer consulted mournfully over him, whenever they walked to Cocksmoor together.",present affliction alter death wife be same need exertion rise high faith resignation sink low sense bereavement disappointment stay pride be congenial own temper bow ruin such bright hope real submission weak give way outburst grief blame unthankful whole demeanour sadden depressed consult walk 
89,"This was not as often as usual, though the walls of the school were rising, for Dr. Spencer had taken a large share of his friend’s work for the present, and both physicians were much occupied by the condition of Mr. Ramsden who was fast sinking, and, for some weeks, seemed only kept alive by their skill. The struggle ended at last, and his forty years’ cure of Stoneborough was closed. It made Dr. May very sad--his affections had tendrils for anything that he had known from boyhood; and though he had often spoken strong words of the vicar, he now sat sorrowfully moralising and making excuses. “People in former times had not so high an estimate of pastoral duty--poor Mr. Ramsden had not much education--he was already old when better times came in--he might have done better in a less difficult parish with better laity to support him, etc.” Yet after all, he exclaimed with one of his impatient gestures, “Better have my Harry’s seventeen years than his sixty-seven!”",usual wall school rise take large share friend work present physician occupy condition fast sink week seem keep alive skill struggle end last year cure close make sad affection have tendril know boyhood speak strong word vicar sit moralise make excuse person former time high estimate pastoral duty poor have much education old good time come do good difficult parish good laity support etc. exclaim impatient gesture have year
