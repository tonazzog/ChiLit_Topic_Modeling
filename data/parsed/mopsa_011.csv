3," Jack crept under his canopy, went to sleep early that night, and did not wake till the sun had risen, when the apple-woman called him, and said breakfast was nearly ready.",creep canopy go sleep night wake sun rise apple woman call say breakfast ready 
4,"The same thing never happens twice in Fairyland, so this time the breakfast was not spread in a tent, but on the river. The Queen had cut off a tiny piece of her robe, the one-foot-one fairies had stretched it till it was very large, and then they had spread it on the water, where it floated and lay like a great carpet of purple and gold. One corner of it was moored to the side of Jack's boat; but he had not observed this, because of his canopy. However, that was now looped up by the apple-woman, and Jack and Mopsa saw what was going on.",same thing happen time breakfast spread tent river cut tiny piece robe foot fairy stretch large spread water float lay great carpet purple gold corner moor side boat observe canopy loop apple woman see go 
5,"Hundreds of swans had been towing the carpet along, and were still holding it with their beaks, while a crowd of doves walked about on it, smoothing out the creases and patting it with their pretty pink feet till it was quite firm and straight. The swans then swam away, and they flew away.",hundred swan towing carpet hold beak crowd dove walk smooth crease pat pretty pink foot firm straight swan swim fly 
6,"Presently troops of fairies came down to the landing-place, jumped into Jack's boat without asking leave, and so got on to the carpet, while at the same time a great tree which grew on the bank began to push out fresh leaves, as large as fans, and shoot out long branches, which again shot out others, till very soon there was shade all over the carpet,--a thick shadow as good as a tent, which was very pleasant, for the sun was already hot.",troops fairy come landing place jump boat ask leave get carpet same time great tree grow bank begin push fresh leave large fan shoot long branch shoot other be shade carpet thick shadow good tent pleasant sun hot

9,"""Good-morning, Jack,"" said the Queen. ""Good-morning, dear."" This was to the apple-woman; and then she stood still for a moment and looked earnestly at little Mopsa, and sighed.",good morning say good morning dear apple woman stand moment look little sigh 
10,"""Well,"" she said to her, ""don't you mean to speak to me?"" Then Mopsa lifted up her pretty face and blushed very rosy red, and said, in a shy voice, ""Good morning----sister.""",say mean speak lift pretty face blush rosy red say shy voice good morning sister

13,"""It was not rude,"" said Mopsa, and she laughed and blushed again. ""It was not rude, and I am not sorry.""",rude say laugh blush rude sorry 
14,"As she said this the Queen stepped on to the carpet, and all the flowers began to drop down. They were something like camellias, and there were thousands of them.",say step carpet flower begin drop camellias be thousand 
15,"The fairies collected them in little heaps. They had no tables and chairs, nor any plates and dishes for this breakfast; but the Queen sat down on the carpet close to Jack's boat, and leaned her cheek on her hand, and seemed to be lost in thought. The fairies put some flowers into her lap, then each took some, and they all sat down and looked at the Queen, but she did not stir.",fairy collect little heap have table chair plate dish breakfast sit carpet boat learn cheek hand seem lose thought fairy put flower lap take sit look stir 
16,"At last Jack said, ""When is the breakfast coming?""",last say breakfast come 
17,"""This is the breakfast,"" said the apple-woman; ""these flowers are most delicious eating. You never tasted anything so good in your life; but we don't begin till the Queen does.""",breakfast say apple woman flower delicious eating taste good life begin 
18,"Quantities of blossoms had dropped into the boat. Several fairies tumbled into it almost head over heels, they were in such a hurry, and they heaped them into Mopsa's lap, but took no notice of Jack, nor of the apple-woman either.",quantity blossom drop boat several fairy tumble head heel hurry heap lap take notice apple woman 
19,"At last, when every one had waited some time, the Queen pulled a petal off one flower, and began to eat, so every one else began; and what the apple-woman had said was quite true. Jack knew that he never had tasted anything half so nice, and he was quite sorry when he could not eat any more. So, when every one had finished, the Queen leaned her arm on the edge of the boat, and, turning her lovely face towards Mopsa, said, ""I want to whisper to you, sister.""",last one wait time pull petal flower begin eat one else begin apple woman say true know taste half nice sorry eat more one finish learn arm edge boat turn lovely face say want whisper sister 
20,"""Oh!"" said Mopsa, ""I wish I was in Jack's waistcoat pocket again; but I'm so big now."" And she took hold of the two sides of his velvet jacket, and hid her face between them.",say wish waistcoat pocket big take hold side velvet jacket hide face

22,"""What is the message?"" asked Mopsa; but she still hid her face.",message ask hide face 
23,"So the Queen moved over, and put her lips close to Mopsa's ear, and repeated it: ""There cannot be two Queens in one hive.""",move put lip ear repeat be hive 
24,"""If Mopsa leaves the hive, a fine swarm will go with her,"" said the apple-woman. ""I shall, for one; that I shall!""",leave hive fine swarm go say apple woman

26,"""Oh!"" said Mopsa; ""I feel as if I must tell a story too, just as the Queen does."" But the apple-woman broke out in a very cross voice, ""It's not at all like Fairyland, if you go on in this way, and I would as lieve be out of it as in it."" Then she began to sing, that she and Jack might not hear Mopsa's story:--",say feel tell story apple woman break cross voice go way begin sing hear story

30,"""Good-by,"" she said, kissing her hand to them. ""I must go and prepare for the deputation.""",good say kiss hand go prepare deputation 
31,"So Jack and Mopsa played about all the morning, sometimes in the boat and sometimes on the shore, while the apple-woman sat on the grass, with her arms folded, and seemed to be lost in thought. At last she said to Jack, ""What was the name of the great bird that carried you two here?""",play morning boat shore apple woman sit grass arm fold seem lose thought last say name great bird carry

43,"""Bury themselves?"" repeated Jack.",bury repeat 
44,"""Yes, I tell you, they bury themselves. You've seen fairy rings, of course, even in your own country; and here the fields are full of them. Well, when it gets cold, a company of fairies forms itself into a circle, and every one digs a little hole. The first that has finished jumps into his hole, and his next neighbor covers him up, and then jumps into his own little hole, and he gets covered up in his turn, till at last there is only one left, and he goes and joins another circle, hoping he shall have better luck than to be last again. I've often asked them why they do that, but no fairy can ever give a reason for anything. They always say that old Mother Fate makes them do it. When they come up again, they are not fairies at all, but the good ones are mushrooms, and the bad ones are toadstools.""",tell bury see fairy ring course own country field full get cold company fairy form circle one dig little hole first finish jump hole next neighbor cover jump own little hole cover turn last be left go join circle hope have good luck last ask do fairy give reason say old make do come fairy good one mushroom bad one toadstool

47,"""I wish the fairies would not disappear for hours,"" said Jack. ""They all seem to run off and hide themselves.""",wish fairy disappear hour say seem run hide 
48,"""That's their way,"" answered the apple-woman. ""All fairies are part of their time in the shape of human creatures, and the rest of it in the shape of some animal. These can turn themselves, when they please, into Guinea-fowl. In the heat of the day they generally prefer to be in that form, and they sit among the leaves of the trees.",way answer apple woman fairy part time shape human creature rest shape animal turn guinea fowl heat day prefer form sit leave tree

52,"So she began to sing, and the air was darkened by great flocks of these Guinea-fowl.
