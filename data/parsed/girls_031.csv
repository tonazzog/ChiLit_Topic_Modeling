1,CHAPTER 31. GOOD AND BAD ANGELS.,good bad angel 
2,"Hester stayed behind in the shady little arbour, and then, on that soft spring day, while the birds sang overhead, and the warm light breezes came in and fanned her hot cheeks, good angels and bad drew near to fight for a victory.  Which would conquer?  Hester had many faults, but hitherto she had been honourable and truthful; her sins had been those of pride and jealousy, but she had never told a falsehood in her life. She, knew perfectly--she trembled as the full knowledge overpowered her--that she had it in her power to exonerate Annie.  She could not in the least imagine now stupid Susan Drummond could contrive and carry out such a clever and deep-laid plot; but she knew also that if she related what she had seen with her own eyes the night before, she would probably give such a clew to the apparent mystery that the truth would come to light.",stay shady little arbour soft spring day bird sing warm light breeze come fann hot cheek good angel bad draw fight victory conquer have many fault honourable truthful sin pride jealousy tell falsehood life know tremble full knowledge overpower have power exonerate least imagine stupid contrive carry clever deep lay plot know relate see own eye night give clew apparent mystery truth come light 
3,"If Annie was cleared from this accusation, doubtless the old story of her supposed guilt with regard to Mrs Willis's caricature would also be read with its right key.  Hester was a clever and sharp girl; and the fact of seeing Susan Drummond in the school-room in the dead of night opened her eyes also to one or two other apparent little mysteries. While Susan was her own room-mate she had often given a passing wonder to the fact of her extraordinary desire to overcome her sleepiness, and had laughed over the expedients Susan had used to wake at all moments.",clear accusation old story suppose guilt regard caricature read right key clever sharp girl fact see school room dead night open eye other apparent little mystery own room mate give passing wonder fact extraordinary desire overcome sleepiness laugh expedient use wake moment 
4,"These things, at the time, had scarcely given her a moment's serious reflection; but now she pondered them carefully, and became more and more certain that, for some inexplicable and unfathomable reason, sleepy, and apparently innocent, Susan Drummond wished to sow the seeds of mischief and discord in the school.  Hester was sure that if she chose to speak now she could clear poor Annie, and restore her to her lost place in Mrs Willis's favour.",thing time give moment serious reflection ponder become certain inexplicable unfathomable reason sleepy innocent wish sow seed mischief discord school sure choose speak clear poor restore lose place favour 
5,"Should she do so?--ah! should she?  Her lips trembled, her colour came and went as the angels, good and bad, fought hard for victory within her.  How she had longed to revenge herself on Annie!  How cordially she had hated her!  Now was the moment of her revenge.  She had but to remain silent now, and to let matters take their course; she had but to hold her tongue about the little incident of last night, and, without any doubt, circumstantial evidence would point at Annie Forest, and she would be expelled from the school.  Mrs Willis must condemn her now. Mr Everard must pronounce her guilty now.  She would go, and when the coast was again clear the love which she had taken from Hester--the precious love of Hester's only little sister--would return.",do lip tremble colour come go angel good bad fight victory long revenge hate moment revenge have remain silent let matter take course have hold tongue little incident last night doubt circumstantial evidence point expel school condemn pronounce guilty go coast clear love take precious love only little sister return
