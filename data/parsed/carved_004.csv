1,CHAPTER IV. ALL SETTLED.,settle 
2," That Sunday--that last Sunday I somehow feel inclined to call it--stands out in my memory quite differently from its fellows. Both Haddie and I felt dull and depressed, partly owing no doubt to the weather, but still more, I think, from that vague fear of something being wrong which we were both suffering from, though we would not speak of it to each other.",last feel inclined call stand memory fellow feel dull depressed ow doubt weather more think vague fear wrong suffer speak other 
3,"It cleared up a little in the evening, and though it was cold and chilly we went to church. Mamma had said to us we might if we liked, and Lydia was going.",clear little evening cold chilly go church say like go 
4,"When we came in, cook sent us a little supper which we were very glad of; it cheered us up.",come cook send little supper glad cheer 
5,"""Aren't you thankful they're coming home to-morrow?"" I said to Haddie. ""I've never minded their being away so much before.""",thankful come say minded 
6,"They had been away two or three times that we could remember, though never for longer than a day or two.",time remember long day 
7,"""Yes,"" said Haddie, ""I'm very glad.""",say glad 
8,But that was all he said.,say 
9,"They did come back the next day, pretty early in the morning, as father had to be at the bank. He went straight there from the railway station, and mamma drove home with the luggage. She was very particular when she went to stay with her godmother to take nice dresses, for Mrs. Selwood would not have been pleased to see her looking shabby, and it would not have made her any more sympathising or anxious to help, but rather the other way. Long afterwards--at least some years afterwards, when I was old enough to understand--I remember Mrs. Selwood saying to me that it was mamma's courage and good management which made everybody respect her.",come next day morning father have bank go railway station mamma drive luggage particular go stay godmother take nice dress pleased see look shabby make sympathising anxious help other way least year old understand remember say mamma courage good management make respect 
10,"I was watching at the dining-room window, which looked out to the street, when the cab drove up. After the heavy rain the day before, it was for once a fine day, with some sunshine. And sunshine was rare at Great Mexington, especially in late November.",watch dining room window look street cab drive heavy rain day fine day sunshine sunshine rare great late 
11,"Mamma was looking out to catch the first glimpse of me--of course she knew that my brother would be at school. There was a sort of sunshine on her face, at least I thought so at first, for she was smiling. But when I looked more closely there was something in the smile which gave me a queer feeling, startling me almost more than if I had seen that she was crying.",look catch first glimpse course know brother school be sort sunshine face least think smile look smile give queer feeling startling see cry 
12,I think for my age I had a good deal of self-control of a certain kind. I waited till she had come in and kissed me and sent away the cab and we were alone. Then I shut the door and drew her to father's special arm-chair beside the fire.,think age have good deal self control certain kind wait come kiss send cab alone shut door draw father special arm chair fire 
13,"""Mamma, dear,"" I half said, half whispered, ""what is it?""",dear half say half whisper 
14,"Mamma gave a sort of gasp or choke before she answered. Then she said,",give sort gasp choke answer say 
15,"""Why, dear, why should you think--oh, I don't know what I am saying,"" and she tried to laugh.",dear think know say try laugh 
16,But I wouldn't let her.,let 
17,"""It's something in your face, mamma,"" I persisted.",face mamma persist 
18,She was silent for a moment.,silent moment 
19,"""We had meant to tell you and Haddie this evening,"" she said, ""father and I together; but perhaps it is better. Yes, my Geraldine, there is something. Till now it was not quite certain, though it has been hanging over us for some weeks, ever since----""",mean tell evening say father good be certain hang week 
20,"""Since that day I asked you--the morning after father came home so late and you had been crying?""",day ask morning father come cry 
21,"""Yes, since then,"" said mamma.",say mamma 
22,"She put her arm round me, and then she told me all that I have told already, or at least as much of it as she thought I could understand. She told it quietly, but she did not try not to cry--the tears just came trickling down her face, and she wiped them away now and then. I think the letting them come made her able to speak more calmly.",put arm tell tell least much think understand tell try cry tear come trickle face wipe think let come make able speak 
23,"And I listened. I was very sorry for her, very _very_ sorry. But you may think it strange--I have often looked back upon it with wonder myself, though I now feel as if I understood the causes of it better--when I tell you that I was _not_ fearfully upset or distressed myself. I did not feel inclined to cry, _except_ out of pity for mamma. And I listened with the most intense interest, and even curiosity. I was all wound up by excitement, for this was the first great event I had ever known, the first change in my quiet child-life.",listen sorry sorry think strange look wonder feel understand cause good tell upset distressed feel inclined cry pity mamma listen intense interest curiosity wind excitement first great event know first change quiet child life 
24,And my excitement grew even greater when mamma came to the subject of what was decided about us children.,excitement grow great mamma come subject decide child 
25,"""Haddie of course must go to school,"" she said; ""to a larger and better school--Mrs. Selwood speaks of Rugby, if it can be managed. He will be happy there, every one says. But about you, my Geraldine.""",course go school say large good school speak manage happy one say 
26,"""Oh, mamma,"" I interrupted, ""do let me go to school too. I have always wanted to go, you know, and except for being away from you, I would far rather be a boarder. It's really being at school then. I know they rather look down upon day-scholars--Haddie says so.""",mamma interrupt let go school want go know border school know look day scholar say 
27,"Mamma looked at me gravely. Perhaps she was just a little disappointed, even though on the other hand she may have felt relieved too, at my taking the idea of this separation, which to her over-rode _everything_, which made the next two years a black cloud to her, so very philosophically. But she sighed. I fancy a suspicion of the truth came to her almost at once and added to her anxiety--the truth that I did not the least realise what was before me.",look little disappointed other hand feel relieve take idea separation ride make next year black cloud sigh fancy suspicion truth come add anxiety truth least realise 
28,"""We _are_ thinking of sending you to school, my child,"" she said quietly, ""and of course it must be as a boarder. Mrs. Selwood advises Miss Ledbury's school here. She has known the old lady long and has a very high opinion of her, and it is not very far from Fernley in case Miss Ledbury wished to consult Mrs. Selwood about you in any way, or in case you were ill.""",think send school child say course border advise school know old lady have high opinion case wish consult way case ill 
29,"""I am very glad,"" I said. ""I should like to go to Miss Ledbury's.""",glad say like go 
30,"My fancy had been tickled by seeing the girls at her school walking out two and two in orthodox fashion. I thought it must be delightful to march along in a row like that, and to have a partner of your own size to talk to as much as you liked.",fancy tickle see girl school walk orthodox fashion think delightful march row have partner own size talk much like 
31,"Mamma said no more just then. I think she felt at a loss what to say. She was afraid of making me unnecessarily unhappy, and on the other hand she dreaded my finding the reality all the worse when I came to contrast it with my rose-coloured visions.",say more think feel loss say afraid make unhappy other hand dread find reality bad come contrast rose coloured vision 
32,"She consulted father, and he decided that it was best to leave me to myself and my own thoughts.",consult father decide good leave own thought 
33,"""She is a very young child still,"" he said to mamma. (All this of course I was told afterwards.) ""It is quite possible that she will _not_ suffer from the separation as we have feared. It may be much easier for her than if she had been two or three years older.""",young child say mamma course tell possible suffer separation fear easy year old 
34,"Haddie had no illusions. From the very first he took it all in, and that very bitterly. But he was, as I have said, a very good boy, and a boy with a great deal of resolution and firmness. He said nothing to discourage me. Mamma told him how surprised she was at my way of taking it, and he agreed with father that perhaps I would not be really unhappy.",have illusion very first take say good boy boy great deal resolution firmness say discourage tell surprise way take agree father unhappy 
35,"And I do think that my chief unhappiness during the next few weeks came from the sight of dear mamma's pale, worn face, which she could not hide, try as she might to be bright and cheerful.",think chief unhappiness next few week come sight dear mamma pale wear face hide try bright cheerful 
36,"There was of course a great deal of bustle and preparation, and all children enjoy that, I fancy. Even Haddie was interested about his school outfit. He was to go to a preparatory school at Rugby till he could get into the big school. And as far as school went, he told me he was sure he would like it very well, it was only the--but there he stopped.",be course great deal bustle preparation child enjoy fancy interested school outfit go preparatory school get big school school go tell sure like stop 
37,"""The what?"" I asked.",ask 
38,"""Oh, the being all separated,"" he said gruffly.",separate say 
39,"""But you'd have had to go away to a big school some day,"" I reminded him. ""You didn't want always to go to a day-school.""",have go big school day remind want go day school 
40,"""No,"" he allowed, ""but it's the holidays.""",allow holiday 
41,The holidays! I had not thought about that part of it.,holiday think part 
42,"""Oh, I daresay something nice will be settled for the holidays,"" I said lightly.",daresay nice settle holiday say 
43,"In one way Haddie was very lucky. Mrs. Selwood had undertaken the whole charge of his education for the two years our parents were to be away. And after that ""we shall see,"" she said.",way lucky undertake whole charge education year parent see say 
44,"She had great ideas about the necessity of giving a boy the very best schooling possible, but she had not at all the same opinion about _girls'_ education. She was a clever woman in some ways, but very old-fashioned. Her own upbringing had been at a time when _very_ little learning was considered needful or even advisable for our sex. And as she had good practical capacities, and had managed her own affairs sensibly, she always held herself up both in her own mind and to others as a specimen of an _un_learned lady who had got on far better than if she had had all the ""'ologies,"" as she called them, at her fingers' ends.",have great idea necessity give boy good schooling possible same opinion _girl education clever woman way old fashioned own upbringing time little learning consider needful advisable sex have good practical capacity manage own affair hold own mind other specimen _un_learned lady get good have ology call finger end 
45,"This, I think, was one reason why she approved of Miss Ledbury's school, which, as you will hear, was certainly not conducted in accordance with the modern ideas which even then were beginning to make wise parents ask themselves if it was right to spend ten times as much on their sons' education as on their daughters'.",think reason approve school hear conduct accordance modern idea begin make wise parent ask right spend time much sons' education daughter 
46,"""Teach a girl to write a good hand, to read aloud so that you can understand what she says, to make a shirt and make a pudding and to add up the butcher's book correctly, and she'll do,"" Mrs. Selwood used to say.",teach girl write good hand read understand say make shirt make pudding add butcher book do use say 
47,"""And what about accomplishments?"" some one might ask.",accomplishment ask 
48,"""She should be able to play a tune on the piano, and to sing a nice English song or two if she has a voice, and maybe to paint a wreath of flowers if her taste lies that way. That sort of thing would do no harm if she doesn't waste time over it,"" the old lady would allow, with great liberality, thinking over her own youthful acquirements no doubt.",able play tune piano sing nice english song have voice paint wreath flower taste lie way sort thing do harm waste time old lady allow great liberality think own youthful acquirement doubt 
49,"I daresay there was a foundation of solid sense in the first part of her advice. I don't see but that girls nowadays might profit by some of it. And in many cases they _do_. It is quite in accordance with modern thought to be able to make a good many ""puddings,"" though home-made shirts are not called for. But as far as the ""accomplishments"" go, I should prefer none to such a smattering of them as our old friend considered more than enough.",be foundation solid sense first part advice see girl profit many case accordance modern thought able make good many pudding home make shirt call accomplishment go prefer smattering old friend consider more enough 
50,"So far less thought on Mrs. Selwood's part was bestowed on Geraldine--that is myself, of course--than on Haddon, as regarded the school question. And mamma _had_ to be guided by Mrs. Selwood's advice to a great extent just then. She had so much to do and so little time to do it in, that it would have been impossible for her to go hunting about for a school for me more in accordance with her own ideas. And she knew that personally Miss Ledbury was well worthy of all respect.",less thought part bestow course regard school question mamma _had_ guide advice great extent have much do little time do impossible go hunt school more accordance own idea know worthy respect 
51,"She went to see her once or twice to talk about me, and make the best arrangements possible. The first of these visits left a pleasanter impression on her mind than the second. For the first time she saw Miss Ledbury alone, and found her gentle and sympathising, and full of conscientious interest in her pupils, so that it seemed childish to take objection to some of the rules mentioned by the school-mistress which in her heart mamma did not approve of.",go see talk make good arrangement possible first visit leave pleasanter impression mind second first time see find gentle sympathise full conscientious interest pupil seem childish take objection rule mention school mistress heart mamma approve 
52,"One of these was that all the pupils' letters were to be read by one of the teachers, and as to this Miss Ledbury said she could make no exception. Then, again, no story-books were permitted, except such as were read aloud on the sewing afternoons. But if I spent my holidays there, as was only too probable, this rule should be relaxed.",pupil letter read teacher say make exception story book permit such read sewing afternoon spend holiday probable rule relaxed 
53,"The plan for Sundays, too, struck my mother disagreeably.",plan strike mother 
54,"""My poor Geraldine,"" she said to father, when she was telling him all about it, ""I don't know how she will stand such a dreary day.""",poor say father tell know stand dreary day 
55,"Father suggested that I should be allowed to write my weekly letter to them on Sunday, and mamma said she would see if that could be.",father suggest allow write weekly letter mamma say see 
56,And then father begged her not to look at the dark side of things.,father begg look dark side thing 
57,"""After all,"" he said, ""Geraldine is very young, and will accommodate herself better than you think to her new circumstances. She will enjoy companions of her own age too. And we know that Miss Ledbury is a good and kind woman--the disadvantages seem trifling, though I should not like to think the child was to be there for longer than these two years.""",say young accommodate good think new circumstance enjoy companion own age know good kind woman disadvantage seem trifling like think child long year 
58,"Mamma gave in to this. Indeed, there seemed nothing else to do. But the second time she went to see Miss Ledbury, the school-mistress introduced her niece--her ""right hand,"" as she called her--a woman of about forty, named Miss Aspinall, who, though only supposed to be second in command, was really the principal authority in the establishment, much more than poor old Miss Ledbury, whose health was failing, realised herself.",give seem else do second time go see school mistress introduce niece right hand call woman name suppose second command principal authority establishment more poor old health fail realise 
59,"Mamma did not take to Miss Aspinall. But it was now far too late to make any change, and she tried to persuade herself that she was nervously fanciful.",take late make change try persuade fanciful 
60,"And here, perhaps, I had better say distinctly, that Miss Aspinall was not a bad or cruel woman. She was, on the contrary, truly conscientious and perfectly sincere. But she was wanting in all finer feelings and instincts. She had had a hard and unloving childhood, and had almost lost the power of caring much for any one. She loved her aunt after a fashion, but she thought her weak. She was just, or wished to be so, and with some of the older pupils she got on fairly well. But she did not understand children, and took small interest in the younger scholars, beyond seeing that they kept the rules and were not complained of by the under teachers who took charge of them. And as the younger pupils were very seldom boarders it did not very much matter, as they had their own homes and mothers to make them happy once school hours were over.",good say bad cruel woman contrary conscientious sincere want finer feeling instinct have hard unloving childhood lose power care much one love aunt fashion think weak wish old pupil get understand child take small interest young scholar see keep rule complain teacher take charge young pupil seldom border matter have own home mother make happy school hour 
61,"Mamma did not know that there were scarcely any boarders as young as I, for when she first asked about the other pupils, Miss Ledbury, thinking principally of lessons, said, ""oh yes,"" there was a nice little class just about my age, where I should feel quite at home.",know be border young ask other pupil think lesson say be nice little class age feel home 
62,"A few days before _the_ day--the day of separation for us all--mamma took me to see Miss Ledbury. She thought I would feel rather less strange if I had been there once, and had seen the lady who was to be my school-mistress.",few day day day separation mamma take see think feel strange see lady school mistress 
63,"I knew the house--Green Bank, it was called--by sight. It was a little farther out of the town than ours, and had a melancholy bit of garden in front, and a sort of playground at the back. It was not a large house--indeed, it was not really large enough for the number of people living in it--twenty to thirty boarders, and a number of day-scholars, who of course helped to fill the schoolrooms and to make them hot and airless, four resident teachers, and four or five servants. But in those days people did not think nearly as much as now about ventilation and lots of fresh air, and perfectly pure water, and all such things, which we now know to be quite as important to our health as food and clothes.",know house green call sight little far town have melancholy bit garden front sort playground back large house large number person live border number day scholar course help fill schoolroom make hot airless resident teacher servant day person think much ventilation lot fresh air pure water such thing know important health food clothes 
64,"Mamma rang the bell. Everything about Green Bank was neat and orderly, prim, if not grim. So was the maid-servant who opened the door, and in answer to mamma's inquiry for Miss Ledbury, showed us into the drawing-room, a square moderate-sized-room, at the right hand of the passage.",ring bell green neat orderly prim grim maid servant open door answer mamma inquiry show draw room square moderate sized room right hand passage 
65,"I can remember the look of that room even now, perfectly. It was painfully neat, not exactly ugly, for most of the furniture was of the spindle-legged quaint kind, to which everybody now gives the general name of ""Queen Anne."" There were a few books set out on the round table, there was a cottage piano at one side, there were some faint water-colours on the wall, and a rather nice clock on the white marble mantelpiece, the effect of which was spoilt by a pair of huge ""lustres,"" as they were called, at each side of it. The carpet was very ugly, large and sprawly in pattern, and so was the hearth-rug. They were the newest things in the room, and greatly admired by Miss Ledbury and her niece, who were full of the bad taste of the day in furniture, and would gladly have turned out all the delicate spidery-looking tables and chairs to make way for heavy and cumbersome sofas and ottomans, but for the question of expense, and perhaps for the sake of old association on the elder lady's part.",remember look room neat ugly most furniture spindle legged quaint kind give general name be few book set round table be cottage piano side be faint water colour wall nice clock white marble mantelpiece effect spoil pair huge lustre call side carpet ugly large pattern hearth rug new thing room admire niece full bad taste day furniture turn delicate spidery look table chair make way heavy cumbersome sofa ottoman question expense sake old association elder lady part 
66,"There was no fire, though it was November, and mamma shivered a little as she sat down, possibly, however not altogether from cold. It was between twelve and one in the morning--that was the hour at which Miss Ledbury asked parents to call.",be fire mamma shiver little sit cold morning hour ask parent call 
67,"Afterwards, when I got to know the rules of the house, I found that the drawing-room fire was never lighted except on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons, or on some very special occasion.",get know rule house find draw room fire light afternoon special occasion 
68,"I stood beside mamma. Somehow I did not feel inclined to sit down. I was full of a strange kind of excitement, half pleasant, half frightening. I think the second half prevailed as the moments went on. Mamma did not speak, but I felt her hand clasping my shoulder.",stand mamma feel inclined sit full strange kind excitement pleasant half frightening think second half prevail moment go speak feel hand clasp shoulder
