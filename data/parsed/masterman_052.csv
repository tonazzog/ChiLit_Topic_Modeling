2,"The next morning Tommy's face presented a very woeful appearance.  His cheek and lips were swelled and black, and the loss of his two front teeth made him look much worse.",next morning face present woeful appearance cheek lip swell black loss front tooth make look bad 
3,"Tommy looked very glum when he came to breakfast.  There was the pig's fry for breakfast, and the smell of it had been very inviting to Tommy; but when his father scolded him, and told him that he was not to have one bit of the pig, he began to cry and roar so loud, that he was sent away from the tents till he had left off.",look glum come breakfast be pig fry breakfast smell invite father scold tell have bit pig begin cry roar send tent leave 
4,"After breakfast, Ready proposed that he and William should take the boat, and begin their labour of carrying the articles round from the cove to the bay where the house was, pointing out that there was not a day to be lost.  Juno had, at his request, already baked a large piece of the pig for them to take with them, and boiled a piece of salt pork, so that they were all ready to start.",breakfast ready propose take boat begin labour carry article cove bay house point be day lose request bake large piece pig take boil piece salt pork ready start

6,"""Why, madam, this is Wednesday; of course we shall be back on Saturday night.""",madam course night 
7,"""My dear William, I cannot bear the idea of your being absent so long, and as you will be on the water every day, I shall be in a continual fright until I see you again.""",dear bear idea absent water day continual fright see

9,"""Don't laugh at me, William.  I do wish there was a penny post, and that you could write every day.""",laugh wish be penny post write day 
10,"Ready and William made every preparation for a continued absence.  They took their blankets with them, and a small pot for cooking, and when all was prepared they bade Mr and Mrs Seagrave farewell.  They were now to pull to the bay, and leave their luggage, and then go round to the cove. As they shoved off, William took the dog Remus into the boat.",ready make preparation continue absence take blanket small pot cooking prepare bid farewell pull bay leave luggage go cove shove take dog boat 
11,"""Why do you take the dog, William? he will be of use here in keeping the pigs away, but of no use to us.""",take dog use keep pig use

13,"""Well, William, you can always have your own way, as far as I'm concerned; if you wish to take the dog, there is an end of the matter.""",have own way concerned wish take dog be end matter 
14,"They hoisted the sail, and as the breeze was fresh, were round to the bay in a very short time.  They took their provisions and stores up to the house, and made fast the door, called the fowls, and gave them some damaged rice which Ready had brought from the cove, and found, to their great delight, that they had now upwards of forty chickens; some, indeed, quite grown, and large enough to kill.",hoist sail breeze fresh bay short time take provision store house make door call fowl give damage rice ready bring cove find great delight have chicken grow large kill 
15,"They then got into the boat again, and pulled away for the cove; the wind was fresh, and against them, so they had a long pull; but, as Ready observed, it was much better that it should be so, as, when the boat was loaded, they could very quickly sail back again to the bay.",get boat pull cove wind fresh have long pull ready observe good boat load sail bay 
16,"As soon as they arrived at the cove, they lost no time in loading the boat; the nails, and iron work of every description, with the twine and tools, composed the major part of the first cargo; and calling Remus, who was lying on the sandy beach, they shoved off, hoisted their sail, and in an hour had regained the bay, and passed through the reef.",arrive cove lose time load boat nail iron work description twine tool compose major part first cargo call lie sandy beach shove hoist sail hour regain bay pass reef 
17,"""I am glad that this cargo has arrived safe, William, for it is very valuable to us.  Now we will take them all up, and that will be sufficient for to-day; to-morrow, if we can, we will make two trips.""",glad cargo arrive safe valuable take sufficient day make trip 
18,"""We can, if we start early,"" replied William; ""but now let us have our dinner, and carry the remainder of the things up afterwards.""",start reply let have dinner carry remainder thing 
19,"As they were eating their dinner, and William was giving the bones to the dog, Ready said, ""Pray, William, what was the idea in your head which made you bring Remus with you?""",eat dinner give bone dog ready say pray idea head make bring 
20,"""I will tell you, Ready; I mean him to carry a letter to mamma; you know that he always goes back when he is ordered, and now I wish to see if he will not go back to the tents, if he is told.  I have brought a piece of paper and pencil with me.""",tell ready mean carry letter mamma know go order wish see go tent tell bring piece paper pencil 
21,William then wrote on the paper:,write paper 
22,"""Dear Mamma:--We are quite well, and just returned with the first cargo quite safe.  Your affectionate son, WILLIAM.""",dear well return first cargo safe affectionate son 
23,"William tied the paper round the dog's neck with a piece of twine, and then calling him out of the house, said to him, ""Remus, go back, sir--go back, sir;"" the dog looked wistfully at William, as if not sure of what he was to do, but William took up a stone, and pretended to throw it at the dog, who ran away a little distance, and then stopped.",tie paper dog neck piece twine call house say go sir go sir dog look sure do take stone pretend throw dog run little distance stop 
24,"""_Go back_, Remus--_go back_, sir.""  William again pretended to throw the stone, repeating the order, and then the dog set off as fast as his legs could carry him through the cocoa-nut grove.",pretend throw stone repeat order dog set leg carry cocoa nut grove 
25,"""He is gone at all events,"" said William; ""I think he will go home.""",gone event say think go 
26,"""We shall see, sir,"" replied Ready; ""and now that we have finished our dinner, we will bring up the things, and put them in the storehouse.""",see sir reply ready finish dinner bring thing put storehouse
