1,CHAPTER II. THE GOSPEL OF DASHT-MEAN.,mean 
2," It was on the day preceding a great review near the Border town of Edam, that Hugh John Picton Smith first became a soldier and a Napoleon. His father's house was connected by a short avenue with a great main road along which king and beggar had for a thousand years gone posting to town. Now the once celebrated highway lies deserted, for along the heights to the east run certain bars of metal, shining and parallel, over which rush all who can pay the cost of a third-class ticket--a roar like thunder preceding them, white steam and sulphurous reek wreathing after them. The great highway beneath is abandoned to the harmless impecunious bicyclist, and on the North Road the sweeping cloud dust has it all its own way.",day preced great review town become soldier father house connect short avenue great main road king beggar have year go post town celebrate highway lie desert height east run certain bar metal shine parallel rush pay cost third class ticket roar thunder preced white steam sulphurous reek wreath great highway abandon harmless impecunious bicyclist sweep cloud dust have own way 
3,"But Hugh John loved the great thoroughfare, deserted though it was. To his mind there could be no loneliness upon its eye-taking stretches, for who knew but out of the dust there might come with a clatter Mr. Dick Turpin, late of York and Tyburn; Robert the Bruce, charging south into England with his Galloway garrons, to obtain some fresh English beef wherewithal to feed his scurvy Scots; or (best of all) his Majesty King George's mail-coach Highflyer, the picture of which, coloured and blazoned, hung in his father's workroom.",love great thoroughfare desert mind be loneliness eye take stretche know dust come clatter late charge garron obtain fresh english beef wherewithal feed scurvy good mail coach picture coloured blazon hang father workroom 
4,"People told him that all these great folks were long since dead. But Hugh John knew better than to believe any ""rot"" grown-ups might choose to palm off on him. What did grown-ups know anyway? They were rich, of course. Unlimited shillings were at their command; and as for pennies--well, all the pennies in the world lived in their breeches' pockets. But what use did they make of these god-like gifts? Did you ever meet them at the tuck-shop down in the town buying fourteen cheese-cakes for a shilling, as any sensible person would? Did they play with ""real-real trains,"" drawn by locomotives of shining brass? No! they preferred either one lump of sugar or none at all in their tea. This showed how much they knew about what was good for them.",person tell great folk long dead know good believe rot grow up choose palm grow up know rich course unlimited shilling command penny penny world live breeche pocket use make god gift meet tuck shop town buy cheese cake shilling sensible person play real real train draw locomotive shine brass prefer lump sugar tea show much know good 
5,"So if such persons informed him that Robert the Bruce had been dead some time, or showed him the rope with which Turpin was hung, coiled on a pedestal in a horrid dull museum (free on Saturdays, 10 to 4), Hugh John Picton looked and nodded, for he was an intelligent boy. If you didn't nod sometimes as if you were taking it all in, they would explain it all over again to you--with abominable dates and additional particulars, which they would even ask you afterwards if you remembered.",such person inform dead time show rope hang coiled pedestal horrid dull museum free look nod intelligent boy nod take explain abominable date additional particular ask remember 
6,"[""MR. DICK TURPIN, LATE OF YORK AND TYBURN.""]",
7,"For many years Hugh John had gone every day down to the porter's lodge at the end of the avenue, and though old Betty the rheumaticky warder was not allowed to let him out, he stared happily enough through the bars. It was a white gate of strong wood, lovely to swing on if you happened to be there when it was opened for a carriageful of calling-folk in the afternoon, or for Hugh John's father when he went out a-riding.",many year go day porter lodge end avenue old rheumaticky warder allow let stare bar white gate strong wood lovely swing happen open carriageful calling folk afternoon father go -riding 
8,"But you had to hide pretty quick behind the laurels, and rush out in that strictly limited period before old Betty found her key, and yet after the tail of Agincourt, his father's great grey horse, had switched round the corner. If you were the least late, Betty would get ahead of you, and the gates of Paradise would be shut. If you were a moment too soon, it was just as bad--or even worse. For then the voice of ""He-whom-it-was-decidedly-most-healthy-to-obey"" would sound up the road, commanding instant return to the Sandheap or the High Garden.",have hide laurel rush limited period old find key tail father great grey horse switch corner least late get gate shut moment bad bad voice healthy obey sound road commanding instant return high 
9,"So on these occasions Hugh John mostly brought Sir Toady Lion with him--otherwise Arthur George the Sturdy, and at yet other times variously denominated Prince Murat, the Old Guard, the mob that was scattered with the whiff of grapeshot, and (generally) the whole Grand Army of the First Empire. Toady Lion (his own first effort at the name of his favourite hero Richard Coeur-de-Lion) had his orders, and with guile and blandishments held Betty in check till the last frisk of Agincourt's tail had disappeared round the corner. Then Hugh John developed his plans of assault, and was soon swinging on the gate.",occasion bring other time denominate old mob scatter whiff grapeshot whole grand first own first effort name favourite hero have order guile blandishment hold check last frisk tail disappear corner develop plan assault swing gate 
10,"""Out of the way with you, Betty,"" he would cry, ""or you will get hurt--sure.""",way cry hurt sure 
11,"For the white gate shut of itself, and you had only to push it open, jump on, check it at the proper place on the return journey, and with your foot shove off again to have scores and scores of lovely swings. Then Betty would go up the avenue and shout for her husband, who was the aforesaid crusty old gardener. She would have laid down her life for Toady Lion, but by no means even a part of it for Hugh John, which was unfair. Old Betty had once been upset by the slam of the gate on a windy day, and so was easily intimidated by the shouts of the horseman and the appalling motion of his white five-barred charger.",white gate shut have push open jump check proper place return journey foot shove have score score lovely swing go avenue shout husband aforesaid crusty old gardener lay life mean part unfair old upset slam gate windy day intimidate shout horseman appalling motion white barr charge 
12,"Such bliss, however, was transient, and might have to be expiated in various ways--at best with a slap from the hand of Betty (which was as good as nothing at all), at worst, by a visit to father's workroom--which could not be thought upon without a certain sense of solemnity, as if Sunday had turned up once too often in the middle of the week.",such bliss transient have expiate various way good slap hand good bad visit father workroom think certain sense solemnity turn middle week 
13,"But upon this great day of which I have to tell, Hugh John had been honourably digging all the morning in the sand-hole. He had on his red coat, which was his most secret pride, and he was devising a still more elaborate system of fortification. Bastion and trench, scarp and counter-scarp, lunette and ravelenta (a good word), Hugh John had made them all, and he was now besieging his own creation with the latest thing in artillery, calling ""Boom!"" when he fired off his cannon, and ""Bang-whack!"" as often as the projectile hit the wall and brought down a foot of the noble fortification, lately so laboriously constructed and so tenderly patted into shape.",great day have tell digg morning sand hole have red coat secret pride devise elaborate system fortification bastion trench scarp counter scarp lunette ravelenta good word make besieg own creation late thing artillery call fire can non bang whack projectile hit wall bring foot noble fortification construct patt shape 
14,"Suddenly there came a sound which always made the heart of Hugh John beat in his side. It was the low thrilling reverberation of the drum. He had only time to dash for his cap, which he had filled with sand and old nails in order to ""be a bomb-shell""; empty it, put it on his head, gird on his London sword-with-the-gold-hilt, and fly.",come sound make heart beat side low thrilling reverberation drum have time dash cap fill sand old nail order bomb shell empty put head gird sword gold hilt fly 
15,"As he ran down the avenue the shrill fifes kept stinging his ears and making him feel as if needles were running up and down his back. It was at this point that Hugh John had a great struggle with himself. Priscilla and Toady Lion were playing at ""House"" and ""Tea-parties"" under the weeping elm on the front lawn. It was a debasing taste, certainly, but after all blood was thicker than water. And--well, he could not bear that they should miss the soldiers. But then, on the other hand, if he went back the troops might be past before he reached the gate, and Betty, he knew well, would not let him out to run after them, and the park wall was high.",run avenue shrill fife keep sting ear make feel needle run back point have great struggle play tea party weeping elm front lawn debase taste blood thick water bear miss soldier other hand go troops past reach gate know let run park wall high 
16,In this desperate strait Hugh John called all the resources of religion to his aid.,desperate strait call resource religion aid 
17,"""It would,"" he said, ""be dasht-mean to go off without telling them.""",say dasht mean go tell 
18,"Hugh John did not know exactly what ""dasht-mean"" meant. But he had heard his cousin Fred (who was grown up, had been a year at school, and wore a tall hat on Sundays) tell how all the fellows said that it was better to die-and-rot than to be ""dasht-mean""; and also how those who in spite of warnings proved themselves ""dasht-mean"" were sent to a place called Coventry--which from all accounts seemed to be a ""dasht-mean"" locality.",know dasht mean mean hear cousin grow year school wear tall hat tell fellow say good die rot dasht mean spite warning prove dasht mean send place call account seem dasht mean locality 
19,"So Hugh John resolved that he would never get sent there, and whenever a little thing tugged down in his stomach and told him ""not to,"" Hugh John said, ""Hang it! I won't be dasht-mean.""--And wasn't.",resolve send little thing tug stomach tell say hang dasht mean 
20,"Grown-ups call these things conscience and religion; but this is how it felt to Hugh John, and it answered just as well--or even better.",grow up call thing conscience religion feel answer good 
21,"So when the stinging surge of distant pipes sent the wild blood coursing through his veins, and he felt his face grow cold and prickly all over, Napoleon Smith started to run down the avenue. He could not help it. He must see the soldiers or die. But all the same _Tug-tug_ went the little string remorselessly in his stomach.",sting surge distant pipe send wild blood course vein feel face grow cold prickly start run avenue help see soldier die same go little string stomach 
22,"""I must see them. I must--I must!"" he cried, arguing with himself and trying to drown the inner voice.",see cry argue try drown inner voice 
23,"""_Tug-tug-tug!_"" went the string, worse than that which he once put round his toe and hung out of the window, for Tom Cannon the under-keeper to wake him with at five in the morning to go rabbit-ferreting.",tug tug tug go string bad put toe hang window under keeper wake morning go rabbit ferreting 
24,Hugh John turned towards the house and the weeping elm.,turn house weep elm 
25,"""It's a blooming shame,"" he said, ""and they won't care anyway. But I _can't_ be dasht-mean!""",bloom shame say care dasht mean 
26,"And so he ran with all his might back to the weeping elm, and with a warning cry set Prissy and Sir Toady Lion on the alert. Then with anxious tumultuous heart, and legs almost as invisible as the twinkling spokes of a bicycle, so quickly did they pass one another, Hugh John fairly flung himself in the direction of the White Gate.",run weeping elm warning cry set alert anxious tumultuous heart leg invisible twinkling spoke bicycle pass flung direction white
