2,"The next morning was one of bustle; there was packing up and every preparation for departure.  Juno was called here and called there, and was obliged to ask little Caroline to look after the kettle and call to her if it boiled over.  Master Tommy, as usual, was in every one's way, and doing more harm than good in his attempts to assist.",next morning bustle be pack preparation departure call call oblige ask little look kettle call boil master usual one way do more harm good attempt assist 
3,"At last, Ready, to get rid of him, sent him down with a large bundle to the beach.  Tommy shouldered it with great importance, but when he came back, looking rather warm with the exertion, and Ready asked him to take down another, he said he was too tired, and sat down very quietly till breakfast-time, before which everything was ready.",last ready get rid send large bundle beach shoulder great importance come look warm exertion ready ask take say tired sit breakfast time ready 
4,"Mrs Seagrave and Juno packed up the breakfast and dinner things in a basket after breakfast was over, and then Mr and Mrs Seagrave and the family set off on their journey, accompanied by the dogs, through the cocoa-nut grove.",pack breakfast dinner thing basket breakfast family set journey accompany dog cocoa nut grove 
5,"William and Ready lost no time in getting through their work; the crockery, kitchen utensils, table, and chairs, were the first articles put into the boat.  The goat was then led down, and they set off with a full load, and arrived at the bay long before the party who were walking through the wood.  They landed the things on the beach, and then shoved off again to bring round the bedding, which was all that was left.  By three o'clock in the afternoon they had arrived at the bay with their second and last load, and found that the other party had been there about an hour, and Mr Seagrave and Juno were very busy taking the articles up from the beach.",lose time get work crockery kitchen utensil table chair first article put boat goat lead set full load arrive bay party walk wood land thing beach shove bring bedding leave o'clock afternoon arrive bay second last load find other party hour busy take article beach 
6,"""Well, William,"" said Ready, ""this is our last trip for some time, I expect; and so much the better, for our little boat must have something done to her as soon as I can find time.""",say ready last trip time expect good little boat have do find time 
7,"""Yes, indeed, Ready, she has done her work well.  Do you know I feel as if I were coming home, now that we are back to the bay.  I really feel quite glad that we have left the tents.  I found the pigeons among the peas, Ready, so we must pick them as soon as we can.  I think there were near twenty of them.  We shall have pigeon pies next year, I expect.""",ready do work know feel come bay feel glad leave tent find pigeon pea ready pick think be have pigeon pie next year expect 
8,"""If it pleases God that we live and do well,"" replied Ready, who had his eyes fixed upon the sea.",please live do reply ready have eye fix sea 
9,"Before night everything was in its place again in the house, and as comfortable as before, and as they were very tired, they went very early to bed, having first arranged what they should do in the morning.  At daylight Ready and William went down to the turtle-pond and speared a turtle, for now the time was coming on for turning the turtle again, and the pond would soon be filled.  Having cut it up and put a portion of it into the pot, all ready for Mrs Seagrave, as soon as breakfast was over they proceeded to the storehouse.",night place house comfortable tired go bed arrange do morning daylight ready go turtle pond spear turtle time come turn turtle pond fill cut put portion pot ready breakfast proceed storehouse 
10,"After a little consultation with Mr Seagrave, Ready marked out a square of cocoa-nut trees surrounding the storehouse, so as to leave a space within them of about twenty yards each side, which they considered large enough for the inclosure.  These cocoa-nut trees were to serve as the posts between which were to be fixed other cocoa-nut trees cut down, and about fourteen feet high, so as to form a palisade or stockade, which could not be climbed over, and would protect them from any attack of the savages.",little consultation ready mark square cocoa nut tree surround storehouse leave space yard side consider large inclosure cocoa nut tree serve post fix other cocoa nut tree cut foot high form palisade stockade climb protect attack savage 
11,"As soon as the line of trees had been marked out, they set to work cutting down all the trees within the line, and then outside to a distance of ten yards, so as to give them room for their work.  Ready cut out cross-pieces, to nail from tree to tree, and now they found the advantage of having saved so many of the large spike nails, without which they never could have made so good or so quick a job of it.  Mr Seagrave cut down trees, William and Juno sawed them off at a proper length with one of the cross-cut saws, and then carried them to Ready. They soon had more cut out than he could use, and then they dragged away the tops and branches, and piled them at a distance on the ground, to use as winter fuel, while Mr Seagrave helped Ready in fixing up the palisades.  They worked very hard that day, and were not sorry to go to bed.  Ready, however, took an opportunity to speak to William.",line tree mark set work cut tree line distance yard give room work ready cut cross piece nail tree tree find advantage save many large spike nail make good job cut tree saw proper length cross cut saw carry ready have more cut use drag top branch pile distance ground use winter fuel help ready fix palisadd work day sorry go bed ready take opportunity speak 
12,"""I think,"" said he, ""that now we are here again, it will be necessary to keep a sort of night-watch, in case of accident.  I shall not go to bed till it is quite dark, which it will be by nine o'clock, and shall have my glass to examine the offing the last thing.  You see, there is little fear of the savages coming here in the night-time, but they may just before night or very early in the morning, so one of us must be up again before daybreak, that is between two and three o'clock in the morning, to see if there is anything to be seen of them; if there is not, of course we may go to bed again, as they cannot arrive till many hours afterwards; and we must watch the wind and weather, if it is favourable for them to come to us, which, indeed, the wind will not be except at the commencement of the rainy season but it may be very light, and then they would not care for its being against them.  I've been thinking of it, William, a great deal, and my idea is, that it will be at the beginning of the rainy season that we shall have a visit, if we have one at all; for you see that the wind don't blow regular from one quarter, as it does now, but is variable, and then they can make sail in their canoes, and come here easily, instead of pulling between thirty and forty miles, which is hard work against wind and current.  Still, we must not be careless and we must keep a good look-out even now.  I don't want to fret your father and Mrs Seagrave with my fears on the subject, but I tell you what I really think, and what we ought to do.""",think say necessary keep sort night watch case accident go bed dark o'clock have glass examine offing last thing see be little fear savage come night time night morning daybreak o'clock morning see be see be course go bed arrive many hour watch wind weather favourable come wind commencement rainy season light care think great deal idea beginning rainy season have visit have see wind blow regular quarter variable make sail canoe come pull mile hard work wind current careless keep good look want fret father fear subject tell think do 
13,"""I agree with you, Ready, and I will take care to be up before daybreak, and examine very carefully with the spy-glass as soon as the day dawns. You take the night part, and I will do the morning part of the watching.""",agree ready take care daybreak examine spy glass day dawn take night part do morning part watch
