2,"After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers. However, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she had tried to cut the plum-cake, ‘So I wasn’t dreaming, after all,’ she said to herself, ‘unless--unless we’re all part of the same dream. Only I do hope it’s MY dream, and not the Red King’s! I don’t like belonging to another person’s dream,’ she went on in a rather complaining tone: ‘I’ve a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens!’",while noise seem die dead silence lift head alarm be see first thought dreaming queer anglo saxon be great dish lie foot try cut plum cake dreaming say part same dream hope dream red like belong person dream go complain tone have great mind go wake see happen 
3,"At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of ‘Ahoy! Ahoy! Check!’ and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. Just as he reached her, the horse stopped suddenly: ‘You’re my prisoner!’ the Knight cried, as he tumbled off his horse.",moment thought interrupt loud shouting check dress crimson armour come gallop brandish great club reach horse stop prisoner cry tumble horse 
4,"Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again. As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more ‘You’re my--’ but here another voice broke in ‘Ahoy! Ahoy! Check!’ and Alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.",startle frighten moment watch anxiety mount saddle begin voice break check look surprise new enemy 
5,"This time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Alice’s side, and tumbled off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on again, and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking. Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment.",time white draw side tumble horse red do get sit look other time speak look other bewilderment

11,"‘I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are,’ she said to herself, as she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: ‘one Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself--and another Rule seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were Punch and Judy--What a noise they make when they tumble! Just like a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender! And how quiet the horses are! They let them get on and off them just as if they were tables!’",wonder say watch fight peep hiding place rule seem hit other knock horse misse tumble rule seem hold club arm noise make tumble whole set fire iron fall fender quiet horse let get table 
12,"Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off.",notice seem fall head battle end fall way side side get shake hand red mount gallop

She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking soldier in all her life.",breathe say put shaggy hair hand turn gentle face large mild eye think see strange look soldier life

Alice looked at it with great curiosity.",dress tin armour seem fit have queer shape little deal box fasten shoulder upside lid hang open look great curiosity

21,"‘I didn’t know it,’ the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over his face. ‘Then all the things must have fallen out! And the box is no use without them.’ He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and he hung it carefully on a tree. ‘Can you guess why I did that?’ he said to Alice.",know say shade vexation pass face thing fall box use unfasten speak go throw bush sudden thought seem strike hang tree guess do say

25,"‘Yes, it’s a very good bee-hive,’ the Knight said in a discontented tone, ‘one of the best kind. But not a single bee has come near it yet. And the other thing is a mouse-trap.

33,"This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open very carefully, because the Knight was so VERY awkward in putting in the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself instead. ‘It’s rather a tight fit, you see,’ he said, as they got it in a last; ‘There are so many candlesticks in the bag.’ And he hung it to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and fire-irons, and many other things.",take long time manage hold bag open awkward put dish first time try fall tight fit see say get last be many candlestick bag hang saddle load bunch carrot fire iron many other thing

You may try it if you like.’",take upright stick say make hair creep fruit tree reason hair fall hang thing fall know plan own invention try like

42,"Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather suddenly), he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk QUITE close to the horse.",horse stop do fall front go do fall keep have habit fall do side walk find good plan walk horse

44,"The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the remark. ‘What makes you say that?’ he asked, as he scrambled back into the saddle, keeping hold of Alice’s hair with one hand, to save himself from falling over on the other side.",look surprised little offend remark make say ask scramble saddle keep hold hair hand save fall other side

They went on a little way in silence after this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice watching anxiously for the next tumble.",think good say say go little way silence eye shut mutter watch next tumble 
48,"‘The great art of riding,’ the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice, waving his right arm as he spoke, ‘is to keep--’ Here the sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on the top of his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up, ‘I hope no bones are broken?’",great art riding begin loud voice wave right arm speak keep sentence end begin fall top head path walk frighten time say anxious tone pick hope bone break

54,"‘Much more smoothly than a live horse,’ Alice said, with a little scream of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.",live horse say little scream laughter spite do prevent

60,"‘I’ll tell you how I came to think of it,’ said the Knight. ‘You see, I said to myself, “The only difficulty is with the feet: the HEAD is high enough already.” Now, first I put my head on the top of the gate--then I stand on my head--then the feet are high enough, you see--then I’m over, you see.’",tell come think say see say only difficulty foot head high put head top gate stand head foot high see see

63,"He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily. ‘What a curious helmet you’ve got!’ she said cheerfully. ‘Is that your invention too?’",look vex idea change subject curious helmet get say invention 
64,"The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the saddle. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘but I’ve invented a better one than that--like a sugar loaf. When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it always touched the ground directly. So I had a VERY little way to fall, you see--But there WAS the danger of falling INTO it, to be sure. That happened to me once--and the worst of it was, before I could get out again, the other White Knight came and put it on. He thought it was his own helmet.’",look helmet hang saddle say invent good one sugar loaf use wear fall horse touch ground have little way fall see danger fall sure happen bad get other white come put think own helmet

66,"‘I had to kick him, of course,’ the Knight said, very seriously. ‘And then he took the helmet off again--but it took hours and hours to get me out. I was as fast as--as lightning, you know.’",have kick course say take helmet take hour hour get fast lightning know 
67,"‘But that’s a different kind of fastness,’ Alice objected.",different kind fastness object

He raised his hands in some excitement as he said this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a deep ditch.",shake head kind fastness assure say raise hand excitement say roll saddle fall deep ditch 
69,"Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she was afraid that he really WAS hurt this time. However, though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual tone. ‘All kinds of fastness,’ he repeated: ‘but it was careless of him to put another man’s helmet on--with the man in it, too.’",run side ditch look startle fall time keep afraid hurt time see sole foot relieved hear talk usual tone kind fastness repeat careless put man helmet man

In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new things.’",look surprise question matter body happen say mind go work same fact more head more keep invent new thing

In fact,’ he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting lower and lower, ‘I don’t believe that pudding ever WAS cooked! In fact, I don’t believe that pudding ever WILL be cooked! And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.’",next day repeat next day fact go hold head voice get low low believe pudding cook fact believe pudding cook clever pudding invent

93,"Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly. Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it had been only yesterday--the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the Knight--the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her--the horse quietly moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the grass at her feet--and the black shadows of the forest behind--all this she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a half dream, to the melancholy music of the song.",strange thing see journey one remember year bring whole scene yesterday mild blue eye kindly smile setting sun gleam hair shine armour blaze light dazzle horse move rein hang neck cropp grass foot black shadow forest take picture hand shade eye lean tree watch strange pair listen half dream melancholy music song

Right on his head as usual! However, he gets on again pretty easily--that comes of having so many things hung round the horse--’ So she went on talking to herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. After the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight.",shake hand ride forest take see expect say stand watch go head usual get come have many thing hang horse go talk watch horse walk road tumble side other fourth fifth tumble reach turn wave handkerchief wait sight
