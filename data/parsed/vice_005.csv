3," Sleep came at last, and brought too brief forgetfulness. It was not till the dull grey light of morning was glimmering through the blinds that Mr. Bultitude awoke to his troubles.",sleep come last bring brief forgetfulness dull grey light morning glimmer blind awoke trouble 
4,"The room was bitterly cold, and he remained shivering in bed for some time, trying to realise and prepare for his altered condition.",room cold remain shiver bed time try realise prepare alter condition 
5,"He was the only one awake. Now and then from one of the beds around a boy would be heard talking in his sleep, or laughing with holiday glee--at the drolleries possibly of some pantomime performed for his amusement in the Theatre Royal, Dreamland--a theatre mercifully open to all boys free of charge, long after the holidays have come to an end, the only drawbacks being a certain want of definiteness in the plot and scenery, and a liability to premature termination of the vaguely splendid performance.",only one awake bed boy hear talk sleep laugh holiday glee drollery pantomime perform amusement royal theatre open boy free charge holiday come end only drawback certain want definiteness plot scenery liability premature termination splendid performance 
6,"Once Kiffin, the new boy, awoke with a start and a heavy sigh, but he cried himself to sleep again almost immediately.",new boy awoke start heavy sigh cry sleep 
7,"Mr. Bultitude could bear being inactive no longer. He thought, if he got up, he might perhaps see his misfortunes shrink to a more bearable, less hopeless scale, and besides, he judged it prudent, for many reasons, to finish his toilet before the sleepers began theirs.",bear inactive think get see misfortune shrink bearable hopeless scale judge prudent many reason finish toilet sleeper begin 
8,"Very stealthily, dreading to rouse anyone and attract attention in the form of slippers, he broke the clinking crust of ice in one of the basins and, shuddering from the shock, bathed face and hands in the biting water. He parted his hair, which from natural causes he had been unable to accomplish for some years, and now found an awkwardness in accomplishing neatly, and then stole down the dark creaking staircase just as the butler in the hall began to swing the big railway bell which was to din stern reality into the sleepy ears above.",dread rouse attract attention form slipper break clinking crust ice basin shudder shock bath face hand bite water part hair natural cause unable accomplish year find awkwardness accomplish steal dark creaking staircase butler hall begin swing big railway bell din stern reality sleepy ear 
9,"In the schoolroom a yawning maid had just lighted the fire, from which turbid yellow clouds of sulphurous smoke were pouring into the room, making it necessary to open the windows and lower a temperature that was far from high originally.",schoolroom yawn maid light fire turbid yellow cloud sulphurous smoke pour room make necessary open window lower temperature high 
10,"Paul stood shaking by the mantelpiece in a very bad temper for some minutes. If the Doctor had come in then, he might have been spurred by indignation to utter his woes, and even claim and obtain his freedom. But that was not to be.",stand shake mantelpiece bad temper minute come spur indignation utter woe claim obtain freedom 
11,"The door did open presently, however, and a little girl appeared; a very charming little maiden indeed, in a neat dark costume relieved by a fresh white pinafore. She had deep grey eyes and glossy brown hair falling over her forehead and down her back in soft straight masses, her face was oval rather than round, and slightly serious, though her smile was pretty and gay.",door open little girl appear charming little maiden neat dark costume relieve fresh white pinafore have deep grey eye glossy brown hair fall forehead back soft straight mass face oval serious smile pretty gay 
12,"She ran towards Mr. Bultitude with a glad little cry, stretching out her hands.",run glad little cry stretch hand

14,"Some might have been very glad to be welcomed in this way, even vicariously. As for boys, it must have been a very bad school indeed which Dulcie Grimstone could not have robbed of much of its terrors.",glad welcome way boy bad school rob much terror 
15,"Mr. Bultitude, however, as has been explained, did not appreciate children--being a family man himself. When one sees their petty squabbles and jealousies, hears their cruel din, and pays for their monkeyish mischief, perhaps the daintiest children seem but an earthly order of cherubim. He was only annoyed and embarrassed by the interruption, though he endured it.",explain appreciate child family man see petty squabble jealousy hear cruel din pay monkeyish mischief daintiest child seem earthly order cherubim annoyed embarrass interruption endure

18,"""How ought I to talk?"" said Paul.",talk say 
19,"""You didn't talk like that before,"" said Dulcie plaintively. ""I--I thought perhaps you'd be glad to see me. You were once. And--and--when you went away last you asked me to--to--kiss you, and I did, and I wish I hadn't. And you gave me a ginger lozenge with your name written on it in lead pencil, and I gave you a cough-lozenge with mine; and you said it was to show that you were my sweetheart and I was yours. But I suppose you've eaten the one I gave you?""",talk say think glad see go last ask kiss wish give ginger lozenge name write lead pencil give cough lozenge say show sweetheart suppose eat one give 
20,"""This is dreadful!"" thought Mr. Bultitude. ""What shall I do now? The child evidently takes me for that little scoundrel Dick."" ""Tut-tut,"" he said aloud, ""little girls like you are too young for such nonsense. You ought to think about--about your dolls, and--ah, your needlework--not sweethearts!""",dreadful think do child take little scoundrel say little girl young such nonsense think doll needlework sweetheart 
21,"""You say that now!"" cried Dulcie indignantly. ""You know I'm not a little girl, and I've left off playing with dolls--almost. Oh, Dick, don't be unkind! You haven't changed your mind, have you?""",say cry know little girl leave play doll unkind change mind 
22,"""No,"" said Paul dismally, ""I've changed my body. But there--you wouldn't understand. Run away and play somewhere, like a good little girl!""",say change body understand run play good little girl

24,"""This is absurd, you know,"" said Mr. Bultitude. ""You can't think how absurd it is! Now, you'll be a very foolish little girl if you cry. You're making a mistake. I'm not the Dick you used to know!""",absurd know say think absurd foolish little girl cry make mistake use know 
25,"""I know you're not!"" sobbed Dulcie. ""But oh, Dick, you will be. Promise me you will be!"" And, to Paul's horror and alarm, she put her arms round his neck, and cried piteously on his shoulder.",know sobb promise horror alarm put arm neck cry shoulder 
26,"""Good gracious!"" he cried, ""let me go. Don't do that, for Heaven's sake! I can hear some one coming. If it's your father, it will ruin me!""",good gracious cry let go do sake hear one come father ruin 
27,"But it was too late. Over her head he saw Tipping enter the room, and stand glaring at them menacingly. Dulcie saw him too, and sprang away to the window, where she tried to dry her eyes unperceived, and then ran past him with a hurried good morning, and escaped, leaving Paul alone with the formidable Tipping.",late head see tip enter room stand glaring see spring window try dry eye unperceived run hurry good morning escape leave formidable tipping 
28,"There was an awkward silence at first, which Tipping broke by saying, ""What have you been saying to make her cry, eh?""",be awkward silence break say say make cry 
29,"""What's that to you, sir?"" said Paul, trying to keep his voice firm.",sir say try keep voice firm 
30,"""Why, it's just this to me,"" said Tipping, ""that I've been spoons on Dulcie myself ever since I came, and she never would have a word to say to me. I never could think why, and now it turns out to be you! What do you mean by cutting me out like this? I heard her call you 'dear Dick.'""",say spoon come have word say think turn mean cut hear call dear 
31,"""Don't be an ass, sir!"" said Paul angrily.",ass sir say 
32,"""Now, none of your cheek, you know!"" said Tipping, edging up against him with a dangerous inclination first to jostle aggressively, and then maul his unconscious rival. ""You just mind what I say. I'm not going to have Dulcie bothered by a young beggar in the second form; she deserves something better than that, anyway, and I tell you that if I once catch you talking to her in the way you did just now, or if I hear of her favouring you more than any other fellows, I'll give you the very juiciest licking you ever had in your life. So look out!""",cheek know say edg dangerous inclination jostle maul unconscious rival mind say go have bother young beggar second form deserve good tell catch talk way hear favour more other fellow give juiciest lick have life look 
33,"At this point the other boys began to straggle down and cluster round the fire, and Paul withdrew from the aggrieved Tipping, and looked drearily out of the window on the hard road and bare black trees outside.",point other boy begin straggle cluster fire withdraw aggrieved look window hard road bare black tree 
34,"""I _must_ tell the Doctor how I'm situated!"" he thought; ""and yet directly I open my mouth, he threatens to flog me. If I stay here, that little girl will be always trying to speak to me, and I shall be thrashed by the red-haired boy. If I could only manage to speak out after breakfast!""",tell situate think open mouth threaten flog stay little girl try speak thrash red hair boy manage speak breakfast 
35,"It was not without satisfaction that he remembered that he paid extra for ""meat for breakfast"" in his son's school-bills, for he was beginning to look forward to meal-time with the natural desire of a young and healthy frame for nourishment.",satisfaction remember pay extra meat breakfast son school bill begin look meal time natural desire young healthy frame nourishment 
36,"At eight o'clock the Doctor came in and announced breakfast, leading the way himself to what was known in the school as the ""Dining Hall."" It scarcely deserved so high-sounding a name perhaps, being a long low room on the basement floor, with a big fireplace, fitted with taps, and baking ovens, which provoked the suspicion that it had begun existence as a back kitchen.",o'clock come announce breakfast lead way know school deserve high sound name long low room basement floor big fireplace fit tap baking oven provoke suspicion begin existence back kitchen 
37,"The Doctor took his seat alone at a cross table forming the top of one of the two rows of tables, set with white cups and saucers, and plates well heaped with the square pieces of bread and butter, while Mrs. Grimstone with Dulcie and Tom, sat at the foot of the same row, behind two ugly urns of dull block-tin.",take seat cross table form top row table set white cup saucer plate heap square piece bread butter sit foot same row ugly urn dull block tin 
38,"But when Mr. Bultitude, more hungry than he had felt for years, found his place at one of the tables, he was disgusted to find upon his plate--not, as he had confidently expected, a couple of plump poached eggs, with their appetising contrast of ruddy gold and silvery white, not a crisp and crackling sausage or a mottled omelette, not even the homely but luscious rasher, but a brace of chill forbidding sardines, lying grim and headless in bilious green oil!",hungry feel year find place table disgust find plate expect couple plump poach egg appetising contrast ruddy gold silvery white crisp crackle sausage mottled omelette homely luscious rasher brace chill forbid sardine lie grim headless bilious green oil 
39,"It was a fish he positively loathed, nor could it be reasonably expected that the confidence necessary for a declaration was to be forgotten by so sepulchral a form of nutriment.",fish loath expect confidence necessary declaration forget sepulchral form nutriment 
40,"He roused himself, however, to swallow them, together with some of the thin and tin-flavoured coffee. But the meal as a whole was so different from the plentiful well-cooked breakfasts he had sat down before for years as a matter of course, that it made him feel extremely unwell.",rouse swallow thin tin flavoure coffee meal whole different plentiful cook breakfast sit year matter course make feel unwell 
41,"No talking was allowed during the meal. The Doctor now and then looked up from his dish of kidneys on toast (at which envious glances were occasionally cast) to address a casual remark to his wife across the long row of plates and cups, but, as a rule, the dull champing sound of boys solemnly and steadily munching was all that broke the silence.",talking allow meal look dish kidney toast envious glance cast address casual remark wife long row plate cup rule dull champing sound boy munch break silence 
42,"Towards the end, when the plates had been generally cleared, and the boys sat staring with the stolidity of repletion at one another across the tables, the junior house-master, Mr. Tinkler, made his appearance. He had lately left a small and little-known college at Cambridge, where he had contrived, contrary to expectation, to evade the uncoveted wooden spoon by just two places, which enabled the Doctor to announce himself as being ""assisted by a graduate of the University of Cambridge who has taken honours in the Mathematical Tripos.""",end plate clear boy sit stare stolidity repletion table junior house master make appearance leave small little know college contrive contrary expectation evade uncoveted wooden spoon place enable announce assist graduate take honour mathematical 
43,"For the rest, he was a small insignificant-looking person, who evidently disliked the notice his late appearance drew upon himself.",rest small insignificant look person dislike notice late appearance draw 
44,"""Mr. Tinkler,"" said the Doctor in his most awful voice, ""if it were my custom to rebuke my assistants before the school (which it is not), I should feel forced to remind you that this tardiness in rising is a bad beginning of the day's work, and sets a bad example to those under your authority.""",say awful voice custom rebuke assistant school feel force remind tardiness rising bad beginning day work set bad example authority 
45,"Mr. Tinkler made no articulate reply, but sat down with a crushed expression, and set himself to devour bread and butter with an energy which he hoped would divert attention from his blushes; and almost immediately the Doctor looked at his watch and said, ""Now, boys, you have half-an-hour for 'chevy'--make the most of it. When you come in I shall have something to say to you all. Don't rise, Mr. Tinkler, unless you have quite finished.""",make articulate reply sit crush expression set devour bread butter energy hope divert attention blush look watch say boy have half hour chevy make most come have say rise finish 
46,"Mr. Tinkler preferred leaving his breakfast to continuing it under the trying ordeal of his principal's inspection. So, hastily murmuring that he had ""made an excellent breakfast""--which he had not--he followed the others, who clattered upstairs to put on their boots and go out into the playground.",prefer leave breakfast continue try ordeal principal inspection murmure make excellent breakfast follow other clatter put boot go playground 
47,"It was noticeable that they did so without much of the enthusiasm which might be looked for from boys dismissed to their sports. But the fact was that this particular sport, ""chevy,"" commonly known as ""prisoners' base,"" was by no means a popular amusement, being of a somewhat monotonous nature, and calling for no special skill on the part of the performers. Besides this, moreover, it had the additional disadvantage (which would have been fatal to a far more fascinating diversion) of being in a great measure compulsory.",noticeable much enthusiasm look boy dismiss sport fact particular sport chevy know prisoner base mean popular amusement monotonous nature call special skill part performer have additional disadvantage fatal fascinating diversion great measure compulsory 
48,"Football and cricket were of course reserved for half-holidays, and played in a neighbouring field rented by the Doctor, and in the playground he restricted them to ""chevy,"" which he considered, rightly enough, both gave them abundant exercise and kept them out of mischief. Accordingly, if any adventurous spirit started a rival game, it was usually abandoned sooner or later in deference to suggestions from headquarters which were not intended to be disregarded.",football cricket course reserve half holiday play neighbour field rent playground restrict chevy consider give abundant exercise keep mischief adventurous spirit start rival game abandon deference suggestion headquarters intend disregard 
49,"This, though undoubtedly well meant, did not serve to stimulate their affection for the game, an excellent one in moderation, but one which, if played ""by special desire"" two or three hours a day for weeks in succession is apt to lose its freshness and pall upon the youthful mind.",mean serve stimulate affection game excellent one moderation play special desire hour day week succession apt lose freshness pall youthful mind 
50,"It was a bright morning. There had been a hard frost during the night, and the ground was hard, sparkling with rime and ringing to the foot. The air was keen and invigorating, and the bare black branches of the trees were outlined clear and sharp against the pale pure blue of the morning sky.",bright morning be hard frost night ground hard sparkling rime ring foot air keen invigorate bare black branch tree outline clear sharp pale pure blue morning sky 
51,"Just the weather for a long day's skating over the dark green glassy ice, or a bracing tramp on country roads into cheery red-roofed market towns. But now it had lost all power to charm. It was almost depressing by the contrast between the boundless liberty suggested, and the dull reality of a round of uninteresting work which was all it heralded.",weather long day skating dark green glassy ice brace tramp country road cheery red roof market town lose power charm depressing contrast boundless liberty suggest dull reality round uninteresting work herald 
52,"So they lounged listlessly about, gravitating finally towards the end of the playground, where a deep furrow marked the line of the base. There was no attempt to play. They stood gossiping in knots, grumbling and stamping their feet to keep warm. By-and-by the day-boarders began to drop in one by one, several of them, from a want of tact in adapting themselves to the general tone, earning decided unpopularity at once by a cheerful briskness and an undisguised satisfaction at having something definite to do once more.",lounge gravitate end playground deep furrow mark line base be attempt play stand gossipe knot grumble stamp foot keep warm day border begin drop several want tact adapt general tone earn decide unpopularity cheerful briskness undisguised satisfaction have definite do more 
53,"If Mr. Tinkler, who had joined one of the groups, had not particularly distinguished himself at breakfast, he made ample amends now, and by the grandeur and manliness of his conversation succeeded in producing a decided impression upon some of the smaller boys.",join group distinguish breakfast make ample amend grandeur manliness conversation succeed produce decide impression small boy 
54,"""The bore of a place like this, you know,"" he was saying with magnificent disdain, ""is that a fellow can't have his pipe of a morning. I've been used to it, and so, of course, I miss it. If I chose to insist on it Grimstone couldn't say anything; but with a lot of young fellows like you, you see, it wouldn't look well!""",bore place know say magnificent disdain fellow have pipe morning use course miss choose insist say lot young fellow see look 
55,"It could hardly have looked worse than little Mr. Tinkler himself would have done, if he had ventured upon more than the mildest of cigarettes, for he was a poor but pertinacious smoker, and his love for the weed was chastened by wholesome fear. There, however, he was in no danger of betraying this, and indeed it would have been injudicious to admit it.",look bad little do venture more mildest cigarette poor pertinacious smoker love weed chasten wholesome fear danger betray injudicious admit 
56,"""Talking of smoking,"" he went on, with a soft chuckle, as at recollections of unspeakable devilry, ""did I ever tell you chaps of a tremendous scrape I very nearly got into up at the 'Varsity? Well, you must know there's a foolish rule there against smoking in the streets. Not that that made any difference to some of us! Well, one night about nine, I was strolling down Petty Cury with two other men, smoking (Bosher of ""Pothouse,"" and Peebles of ""Cats,"" both pretty well known up there for general rowdiness, you know--great pals of mine!) and, just as we turned the corner, who should we see coming straight down on us but a Proctor with his bull-dogs (not dogs, you know, but the strongest 'gyps' in college). Bosher said, 'Let's cut it!' and he and Peebles bolted. (They were neither of them funks, of course, but they lost their heads.) I went calmly on, smoking my cigar as if nothing was the matter. That put the Proctor in a bait, I can tell you! He came fuming up to me. 'What do you mean, sir,' says he, quite pale with anger (he was a great bull-headed fellow, one of the strongest dons of his year, that's why they made him a Proctor)--'what do you mean by breaking the University Statutes in this way?' 'It _is_ a fine evening,' said I (I was determined to keep cool). 'Do you mean to insult me?' said he. 'No, old boy,' said I, 'I don't; have a cigar?' He couldn't stand that, so he called up his bull-dogs. 'I give him in charge!' he screamed out. 'I'll have him sent down!' 'I'll send you down first,' said I, and I just gave him a push--I never meant to hurt the fellow--and over he went. I rolled over a bull-dog to keep him company, and, as the other fellow didn't want any more and stood aside to let me pass, I finished my stroll and my cigar.""",talk smoking go soft chuckle recollection unspeakable devilry tell chap tremendous scrape get know be foolish rule smoking street make difference night stroll other man smoking cat know general rowdiness know great pal turn corner see come bull dog dog know strong gyp college say let cut bolt funk course lose head go smoke cigar matter put bait tell come fume mean sir say pale anger great bull headed fellow strong don year make mean break way fine evening say determined keep cool mean insult say old boy say have cigar stand call bull dog give charge scream have send send say give push mean hurt fellow go roll bull dog keep company other fellow want more stand let pass finish stroll cigar 
57,"""Was the Proctor hurt, sir?"" inquired a small boy with great respect.",hurt sir inquire small boy great respect 
58,"""More frightened than hurt, I always said,"" said Mr. Tinkler lightly, ""but somehow he never would proctorise any more--it spoilt his nerve. He was a good deal chaffed about it, but of course no one ever knew I'd had anything to do with it!""",frighten hurt say say proctorise more spoil nerve good deal chaff course know have do 
59,"With such tales of Homeric exploit did Mr. Tinkler inculcate a spirit of discipline and respect for authority. But although he had indeed once encountered a Proctor, and at night, he did himself great injustice by this version of the proceedings, which were, as a matter of fact, of a most peaceable and law-abiding character, and though followed by a pecuniary transaction the next day in which six-and-eightpence changed pockets, the Proctors continued their duties much as before, while Mr. Tinkler's feelings towards them, which had ever been reverential in the extreme, were, if anything, intensified by the experience.",such tale homeric exploit inculcate spirit discipline respect authority encounter night do great injustice version proceedings matter fact peaceable law abide character follow pecuniary transaction next day eightpence change pocket continue duty feeling reverential extreme intensify experience 
60,"Upon this incident, however, he had gradually embroidered the above exciting episode, until he grew to believe at intervals that he really had been a devil of a fellow in his time, which, to do him justice, was far from the case.",incident embroider above exciting episode grow believe interval devil fellow time do justice case 
61,"He might have gone on still further to calumniate himself, and excite general envy and admiration thereby, if at that moment Dr. Grimstone had not happened to appear at the head of the cast-iron staircase that led down into the playground; whereupon Mr. Tinkler affected to be intensely interested in the game, which, as a kind of involuntary compliment to the principal, about this time was galvanised into a sort of vigour.",go calumniate excite general envy admiration moment happen appear head cast iron staircase lead playground affect interested game kind involuntary compliment principal time galvanise sort vigour 
62,"But the Doctor, after frowning gloomily down upon them for a minute or so, suddenly called ""All in!""",frown minute call 
63,"He had several ways of saying this. Sometimes he would do so in a half-regretful tone, as one himself obeying the call of duty; sometimes he would appear for some minutes, a benignant spectator, upon the balcony, and summon them to work at length with a lenient pity--for he was by no means a hard-hearted man; but at other times he would step sharply and suddenly out and shout the word of command with a grim and ominous expression. On these last occasions the school generally prepared itself for a rather formidable quarter of an hour.",have several way say do half regretful tone obey call duty appear minute benignant spectator balcony summon work length lenient pity means hard hearted man other time step shout word command grim ominous expression last occasion school prepare formidable quarter hour 
64,"This was the case now and, as a further portent, Mr. Blinkhorn was observed to come down and, after a few words with Mr. Tinkler, withdrew with him through the school gate.",case further portent observe come few word withdraw school gate 
65,"""He's sent them out for a walk,"" said Siggers, who was skilled in omens. ""It's a row!""",send walk say skill omen row 
66,"Rows at Crichton House, although periodical, and therefore things to be forearmed against in some degree, were serious matters. Dr. Grimstone was a quick-tempered man, with a copious flow of words and a taste for indulging it. He was also strongly prejudiced against many breaches of discipline which others might have considered trifling, and whenever he had discovered any such breach he could not rest until by all the means in his power he had ascertained exactly how many were implicated in the offence, and to what extent.",row periodical thing forearm degree serious matter quick temper man copious flow word taste indulg prejudice many breach discipline other consider trifl discover such breach rest means power ascertain many implicate offence extent 
67,"His usual method of doing this was to summon the school formally together and deliver an elaborate harangue, during which he worked himself by degrees into such a state of indignation that his hearers were most of them terrified out of their senses, and very often conscience-stricken offenders would give themselves up as hopelessly detected and reveal transgressions altogether unsuspected by him--much as a net brings up fish of all degrees of merit, or as heavy firing will raise drowned corpses to the surface.",usual method do summon school deliver elaborate harangue work degree state indignation hearer most terrify sense conscience stricken offender give detect reveal transgression unsuspected much net bring fish degree merit heavy fire raise drown corpse surface 
68,"Paul naturally knew nothing of this peculiarity; he had kept himself as usual apart from the others, and was now trying to compel himself to brave the terrors of an avowal at the first opportunity. He followed the others up the steps with an uneasy wonder whether, after all, he would not find himself ignominiously set down to learn lessons.",know peculiarity keep usual other try compel brave terror avowal first opportunity follow other step uneasy wonder find set learn lesson 
69,"The boys filed into the schoolroom in solemn silence, and took their seats at the desks and along the brown tables. The Doctor was there before them, standing up with one elbow resting upon a reading-stand, and with a suggestion of coming thunder in his look and attitude that, combined with the oppressive silence, made some of the boys feel positively ill.",boy file schoolroom solemn silence take seat desk brown table stand elbow rest reading stand suggestion come thunder look attitude combine oppressive silence make boy feel ill

73,"""Ever since I have devoted myself to the cause of tuition,"" continued the Doctor, ""I have made it my object to provide boys under my roof with fare so abundant and so palatable that they should have no excuse for obtaining extraneous luxuries.

77,"""And yet"" (here he began gradually to relax his self-restraint and lash himself into a frenzy of indignation), ""what do I find? There are some natures so essentially base, so incapable of being affected by kindness, so dead to honour and generosity, that they will not scruple to conspire or set themselves individually to escape and baffle the wise precautions undertaken for their benefit.

79,"""I do not like to think,"" said Dr. Grimstone, ""that the evil has a wider existence than I yet know of. It may be so; nothing will surprise me now. There may be some before me trembling with the consciousness of secret guilt. If so, let those boys make the only reparation in their power, and give themselves up in an honourable and straightforward manner!""",like think say evil have wide existence know surprise be tremble consciousness secret guilt let boy make only reparation power give honourable straightforward manner 
80,"To this invitation, which indeed resembled that of the duck-destroying Mrs. Bond, no one made any response. They had grown too wary, and now preferred to play a waiting game.",invitation resemble duck destroy make response grow wary prefer play waiting game 
81,"""Then let the being--for I will not call him boy--who is known to me, step forth and confess his fault publicly, and sue for pardon!"" thundered the Doctor, now warmed to his theme.",let being call boy know step confess fault sue pardon thunder warm theme 
82,"But the being declined from a feeling of modesty, and a faint hope that somebody else might, after all, be the person aimed at.",decline feeling modesty faint hope else person aim

85,"""Yes, you, sir, and let your companions regard you with the contempt and abhorrence you so richly merit!""

86,"""So, Coggs,"" said the Doctor, with a slow and withering scorn, ""so you thought to defy me; to smuggle compressed illness and concentrated unhealthiness into this school with impunity? You flattered yourself that after I had once confiscated your contraband poisons, you would hear no more of it! You deceived yourself, sir! I tell you, once for all, that I will not allow you to contaminate your innocent schoolmates with your gifts of surreptitious sweetmeats; they shall not be perverted with your pernicious peppermints, sir; you shall not deprave them by jujubes, or enervate them with Turkish Delight! I will not expose myself or them to the inroads of disease invited here by a hypocritical inmate of my walls. The traitor shall have his reward!""",say slow wither scorn think defy smuggle compress illness concentrate unhealthiness school impunity flatter confiscate contraband poison hear more deceive sir tell allow contaminate innocent schoolmate gift surreptitious sweetmeat pervert pernicious peppermint sir deprave jujube enervate turkish expose inroad disease invite hypocritical inmate wall traitor have reward 
87,"All of which simply meant that the Doctor, having once had a small boy taken seriously ill from the effects of overeating himself, was naturally anxious to avoid such an inconvenience for the future. ""Thanks to the fearless honesty of a youth,"" continued the Doctor, ""who, in an eccentric manner, certainly, but with, I do not doubt, the best of motives, opened my eyes to the fell evil, I am enabled to cope with it at its birth. Richard Bultitude, I take this occasion of publicly thanking and commending you; your conduct was noble!""",mean have small boy take ill effect overeat anxious avoid inconvenience future thanks fearless honesty youth continue eccentric manner doubt good motive open eye fall evil enable cope birth take occasion thank commend conduct noble 
88,"Mr. Bultitude was too angry and disappointed to speak. He had thought his path was going to be made smooth, and now all this ridiculous fuss was being made about a few peppermint lozenges. He wished he had never mentioned them. It was not the last time he breathed that wish. ""As for you, Coggs,"" said the Doctor, suddenly producing a lithe brown cane, ""I shall make a public example of you.""",angry disappointed speak think path go make smooth ridiculous fuss make few peppermint lozenge wish mention last time breathe wish say produce lithe brown cane make public example 
89,"Coggs stared idiotically and protested, but after a short and painful scene, was sent off up to his bedroom, yelping like a kicked puppy.",cogg stare protest short painful scene send bedroom yelp kick puppy 
90,"""One word more,"" said the Doctor, now almost calm again. ""I know that you all think with me in your horror of the treachery I have just exposed. I know that you would scorn to participate in it."" (A thrill and murmur, expressive of intense horror and scorn, went round the benches.) ""You are anxious to prove that you do so beyond a doubt."" (Again a murmur of assent.) ""I give you all that opportunity. I have implicit trust and confidence in you--let every boarder go down into the box-room and fetch up his playbox, just as it is, and open it here before me.""",word say calm know think horror treachery expose know scorn participate thrill murmur expressive intense horror scorn go bench anxious prove do doubt murmur assent give opportunity have implicit trust confidence let border go box room fetch playbox open 
91,"There was a general fall of jaws at this very unexpected conclusion; but contriving to overcome their dismay, they went outside and down through the playground into the box-room, Paul amongst the rest, and amidst universal confusion, everyone opened his box, and, with a consideration especially laudable in heedless boyhood, thoughtfully and carefully removed from it all such dainties as might be calculated to shock or pain their preceptor.",be general fall jaw unexpected conclusion contrive overcome dismay go playground box room rest universal confusion open box consideration laudable heedless boyhood remove such dainty calculate shock pain preceptor 
92,"Mr. Bultitude found a key which was labelled ""playbox,"" and began to open a box which bore Dick's initials cut upon the lid; without any apprehensions, however, for he had given too strict orders to his daughter, to fear that any luxuries would be concealed there.",find key label playbox begin open box bear initial cut lid apprehension give strict order daughter fear luxury conceal 
93,"But no sooner had he raised the lid than he staggered back with disgust. It was crammed with cakes, butterscotch, hardbake, pots of jam, and even a bottle of ginger wine--enough to compromise a chameleon!",raise lid stagger disgust cramm cake butterscotch hardbake pot jam bottle ginger wine compromise chameleon 
94,"He set himself to pitch them all out as soon as possible with feverish haste, but Tipping was too quick for him. ""Hallo!"" he cried: ""oh, I say, you fellows, come here! Just look at this! Here's this impudent young beggar, who sneaked of poor old Coggs for sucking jujubes, and very nearly got us all into a jolly good row, with his own box full all the time; butterscotch, if you please, and jam, and ginger wine! You'll just put 'em all back again, will you, you young humbug!""",set pitch possible feverish haste tipping quick cry say fellow come look impudent young beggar sneak poor old suck jujube get jolly good row own box full time butterscotch jam ginger wine put e young humbug

96,"""Yes, sir, please, sir,"" jeered Tipping; ""I did venture to take such a liberty, sir.""",sir sir jeer venture take liberty sir 
97,"""Then it was like your infernal impudence,"" growled Paul. ""You be kind enough to leave my affairs alone. Upon my word, what boys are coming to nowadays!""",infernal impudence growl kind leave affair word boy come 
98,"""Are you going to put that tuck back?"" said Tipping impatiently.",go put tuck say tip

100,"""Well, if you won't,"" said Tipping easily, ""I suppose we must. Biddlecomb, kindly knock him down, and sit on his head while I fill his playbox for him.""",say tip suppose knock sit head fill playbox 
101,"This was neatly and quickly done. Biddlecomb tripped Mr. Bultitude up, and sat firmly on him, while Tipping carefully replaced the good things in Dick's box, after which he locked it, and courteously returned the key. ""As the box is heavy,"" he said, with a wicked wink, ""I'll carry it up for you myself,"" which he did, Paul following, more dead than alive, and too shaken even to expostulate.",do trip sit replace good thing box lock return key box heavy say wicked wink carry follow dead alive shake expostulate 
102,"""Bultitude's box was rather too heavy for him, sir,"" he explained as he came in; and Dr. Grimstone, who had quite recovered his equanimity, smiled indulgently, and remarked that he ""liked to see the strong assisting the weak.""",box heavy sir explain come recover equanimity smile remark like see strong assist weak 
103,"All the boxes had by this time been brought up, and were ranged upon the tables, while the Doctor went round, making an almost formal inspection, like a Custom House officer searching compatriots, and becoming milder and milder as box after box opened to reveal a fair and innocent interior.",box have time bring rang table go make formal inspection custom officer search compatriot become mild mild box box open reveal fair innocent interior 
104,"Paul's turn was coming very near, and his heart seemed to shrivel like a burst bladder. He fumbled with his key, and tried hard to lose it. It was terrible to have oneself to apply the match which is to blow one to the winds. If--if--the idea was almost too horrible--but if he, a blameless and respectable city merchant, were actually to find himself served like the miserable Coggs!",turn come heart seem shrivel burst bladder fumble key try lose terrible have apply match blow wind idea horrible blameless respectable city merchant find serve miserable 
105,"At last the Doctor actually stood by him. ""Well, my boy,"" he said, not unkindly, ""I'm not afraid of anything wrong here, at any rate.""",last stand boy say afraid wrong rate 
106,"Mr. Bultitude, who had the best reasons for not sharing his confidence, made some inarticulate sounds, and pretended to have a difficulty in turning the key.",have good reason share confidence make inarticulate sound pretend have difficulty turn key 
107,"""Eh? Come, open the box,"" said the Doctor with an altered manner. ""What are you fumbling at it for in this--this highly suspicious manner? I'll open it myself.""",come open box say alter manner fumble suspicious manner open 
108,"He took the key and opened the lid, when the cakes and wine stood revealed in all their damning profusion. The Doctor stepped back dramatically. ""Hardbake!"" he gasped; ""wine, pots of strawberry jam! Oh, Bultitude, this is a revelation indeed! So I have nourished one more viper in my bosom, have I? A crawling reptile which curries favour by denouncing the very crime it conceals in its playbox!

110,"""Then why were you so anxious to avoid opening the box?"" rejoined the Doctor. ""No, sir, you're too ingenious; your guilt is clear. Go to your dormitory, and wait there till I come to you!""",anxious avoid open box rejoin sir ingenious guilt clear go dormitory wait come 
111,"Paul went upstairs, feeling utterly abandoned and helpless. Though a word as to his real character might have saved him, he could not have said it, and, worse still, knew now that he could not.",go feel abandon helpless word real character save say bad know 
112,"""I shall be caned,"" he told himself, and the thought nearly drove him mad. ""I know I shall be caned! What on earth shall I do?""",cane tell thought drive mad know cane earth do 
113,"He opened the door of his bedroom. Coggs was rocking and moaning on his bed in one corner of the room, but looked up with red furious eyes as Paul came in.",open door bedroom rock moan bed corner room look red furious eye come 
114,"""What do you want up here?"" he said savagely. ""Go away, can't you!""",want say go

118,"""Hooray!"" shouted Coggs hysterically: ""I don't care now. And I'll have some revenge on my own account as well. I don't mind an extra licking, and you're in for one as it is. Will you stand up to me or not?""",shout care have revenge own account mind extra lick stand 
119,"""I don't understand you,"" said Paul. ""Don't come so near. Keep off, you young demon, will you!"" he cried presently, as Coggs, exasperated by all his wrongs, was rushing at him with an evidently hostile intent. ""There, don't be annoyed, my good boy,"" he pleaded, catching up a chair as a bulwark. ""It was a misunderstanding. I wish you no harm. There, my dear young friend! Don't!""",understand say come keep young demon cry exasperate wrong rush hostile intent annoy good boy plead catching chair bulwark misunderstanding wish harm dear young friend 
120,"The ""dear young friend"" was grappling with him and attempting to wrest the chair away by brute force.

121,"""Murder!"" Paul gasped, feeling his hold on the chair relaxing. ""Unless help comes this young fiend will have my blood!""",murder gasp feel hold chair relax help come young fiend have blood 
122,"They were revolving slowly round the chair, watching each other's eyes like gladiators, when Paul noticed a sudden blankness and fixity in his antagonist's expression, and, looking round, saw Dr. Grimstone's awful form framed in the doorway, and gave himself up for lost.",revolve chair watch other eye gladiator notice sudden blankness fixity antagonist expression look see awful form frame doorway give lose
