1,CHAPTER 5. A PROCESSION.,chapter procession 
2,"It was too plain to all now that everything must be yielded to the people, if lives were to be saved.  As soon as it was light, Lafayette led into a balcony the commander of the Flanders regiment,--the body-guard,--with a huge tricolor in his hat, instead of the royal white cockade.  All the soldiers of the regiment immediately mounted tricolor cockades, and were cheered by the mob.  The king appeared on the balcony, with Lafayette, and they cheered him too; but some voices cried that he must go to Paris.",plain yield person life save light lead balcony commander regiment body guard huge tricolor hat royal white cockade soldier regiment mount tricolor cockade cheer mob king appear balcony cheer voice cry go 
3,"The mob then demanded to see the queen.  She asked for her children; and they were brought to her, probably not very willing to face the noisy multitude.  She took Louis in her arms, and led his sister by the hand, and stepped out on the balcony, with Lafayette by her side.  There was a shout, ""No children!""  It does not seem clear why the people would not have the children too; but the queen believed that it was intended that some one should shoot her as she stood, and that the children were not to be endangered.  She gently pushed them back, and bade them go in, and then stepped forward in the sight of the people, with her hands and eyes raised to heaven.  Lafayette took her hand, and, kneeling reverently, kissed it.  This act turned the tide of the people's feelings, and they cheered the queen.  It was finely done of Lafayette, both for presence of mind and noble feeling.",mob demand see queen ask child bring willing face noisy multitude take arm lead sister hand step balcony side be shout child seem clear person have child queen believe intend shoot stand child endangered push bid go step sight person hand eye raise heaven take hand kneel kiss act turn tide person feeling cheer queen do presence mind noble feeling 
4,"Here was the difference between the enraged people and their enlightened leaders.  Lafayette was a friend of the people, and an enemy to tyranny: but he had not been ground down by poverty, reared in hunger and brutal ignorance, and taught to hate proud and selfish oppressors with a cruel hatred.  Such was the difference between him and this wretched mob, whom we feel more disposed to pity than to blame, so great was their ignorance, and so terrible had been the sufferings of their lives. Lafayette's eyes were opened by knowledge and reflection, while theirs were closed by passion and prejudice.  They believed that all royal rulers were wicked, and the queen the most wicked of all; and that if she were but out of the way, with a few more, all would go right,--bread would be cheap, the nobility less extravagant and oppressive, and the king willing to govern by men of the people's choice.  Lafayette saw that all this was very foolish.  He saw that nothing could be worse than the state of France,--the tyranny of the nobility,--the extravagance and frivolity of the court,--and the wretchedness of the people.  He was for amending all this; but he knew that these sins and woes were the growth of many centuries, and that no one person, or dozen of persons, was to be blamed as the cause.  He probably saw that the queen was as ignorant in one way as the mob in another; and was therefore to be pitied.  She had never been taught what millions of people were suffering, and did not know how to frame her conduct so as to spare their irritated and wounded feelings: and therefore she had filled up her youth with shows and pleasures, and from year to year given to her dependents the means of enriching themselves at the expense of the poor, without being in the least aware of the mischief she was doing.  It was in the knowledge of all this, in deep sorrow and compassion for both parties in this great quarrel, and with an earnest desire to bring them to bear with each other, that Lafayette kissed the queen's hand in the balcony.  His heart must have beat with hope and gladness when he heard the people immediately shout, ""Long live the queen!""",difference enrage person enlightened leader friend person enemy tyranny ground poverty rear hunger brutal ignorance teach hate proud selfish oppressor cruel hatred such difference wretched mob feel dispose pity blame great ignorance terrible suffering life eye open knowledge reflection close passion prejudice believe royal ruler wicked queen wicked way few more go bread cheap nobility extravagant oppressive king willing govern man person choice see foolish see bad state tyranny nobility extravagance frivolity court wretchedness person amend know sin woe growth many century person person blame cause see queen ignorant way mob pity teach million person suffer know frame conduct spare irritated wound feeling fill youth show pleasure year year give dependent means enrich expense poor least aware mischief do knowledge deep sorrow compassion party great quarrel earnest desire bring bear other kiss queen hand balcony heart beat hope gladness hear person shout live queen 
5,"Again the cry was, ""The king to Paris!"" and still the king was as unwilling as ever to go.  He wished to consult the Assembly about it, and sent to ask them to come, and hold their sitting in the palace. While they were deliberating whether to do so, the mob became so peremptory, so noisy, that the king dared no longer hesitate.  He did the same thing now that no experience could teach him to avoid, in great affairs or small: he refused as long as possible what the people had set their hearts upon,--then hesitated, and at last had to yield, when it was no longer possible to show any good grace in the action.  From his failures a lesson might be taken by all rulers of a nation which has learned to have a will of its own, and to speak it:--a lesson to grant with readiness and a good grace what must be, or ought to be yielded, and to refuse with firmness what ought not to be granted.  Louis the Sixteenth never could even get so far as to settle in his own mind what ought, and what ought not to be granted; and unhappily there was no one about him well-qualified to advise.  The queen was firm and decided; but she was so deficient in knowledge that she was always as likely to guide him wrong as right.  Now, however, there was no longer room for doubt. The king said from the balcony, ""My children, you wish that I should follow you to Paris.  I consent, on condition that you do not separate me from my wife and children.""  He also stipulated that his guards should be well treated; to which the multitude consented.",cry king king unwilling go wish consult send ask come hold sitting palace deliberate do mob become peremptory noisy king dare hesitate do same thing experience teach avoid great affair small refuse possible person set heart hesitate last have yield possible show good grace action failure lesson take ruler nation learn have will own speak lesson grant readiness good grace yield refuse firmness grant sixteenth get settle own mind grant be qualify advise queen firm decide deficient knowledge likely guide wrong right be long room doubt king say balcony child wish follow consent condition separate wife child stipulate guard treat multitude consent 
6,"It was, however, far from their intention that the king should _follow_ them to Paris.  They did not mean to lose sight of him, for fear he should slip away.  They caused General Lafayette to fix the hour at which the king would go.  One o'clock was fixed.",intention king _follow mean lose sight fear slip cause fix hour king go o'clock fix 
7,"Till one, the royal grooms were preparing the carriages to convey the royal family and suite,--a long train of coaches.  The servants in the palace were packing up what they could for so hurried a removal.  The royal children did no lessons that day, I should think; for Madame de Tourzel, who was to go with them, must have been in great terror for the whole party.  Lafayette was establishing what order he could, riding about, pale and anxious, to arrange what was called the Parisian army. For two nights (and what nights!) he had not closed his eyes.  The people meantime searched out some granaries, and loaded carts with the corn, to take with them to Paris.",royal groom prepare carriage convey royal family suite long train coach servant palace pack hurry removal royal child do lesson day think go great terror whole party establish order ride pale anxious arrange call parisian army night night close eye person search granary load cart corn take 
8,"A more extraordinary procession was perhaps never seen.  Royal carriages, and waggons full of corn,--the king's guards and the ragamuffin crowd; round the king's carriage a mob of dirty, fierce fish-women and market-women, eating as they walked, and sometimes screaming out close at the coach-door, ""We shall not want bread any more.  We have got the baker, and the baker's wife, and the little baker's boy:""--such was the procession.  There was another thing in it which the king and queen saw, but which we must hope the children did not,--the heads of two body-guards who had been killed early in the morning, in the quarrel which led to the attack upon the queen.",extraordinary procession see royal carriage waggon full corn king guard ragamuffin crowd king carriage mob dirty fierce fish woman market woman eat walk scream coach door want bread more get baker baker wife little baker boy such procession be thing king queen see hope child head body guard kill morning quarrel lead attack queen 
9,"The queen sat in her coach, seen by the vast multitude, for five long hours,--calm, dignified, and silent.  From one till two the royal carriage had to stand, while the great procession was preparing to move; and it did not enter Paris till dusk,--till six o'clock.  It was still raining,--a dull, drizzling rain.  Louis could not have liked to hear himself talked about as he was, by the loud dirty women that crowded round the coach; nor to hear them speak to his mother.  Some pointed to the corn-waggons, and told her they had got what they wanted, in spite of her.  Some said, ""Come now, don't you be a traitor any more, and we will all love you.""  There were two hundred thousand people in this procession.",queen sit coach see vast multitude long hour calm dignified silent royal carriage have stand great procession prepare move enter dusk o'clock rain dull drizzle rain like hear talk loud dirty woman crowd coach hear speak mother point corn waggon tell get want spite say come traitor more love be person procession 
10,"When they reached Paris, the royal family did not go straight home to the Tuileries.  There was something to be done first.  They had to go to the great city hall, to meet the authorities of Paris.  The mayor received them, and welcomed them to the city; and the king replied that he always came with pleasure and confidence among his good people of Paris.  In repeating what the king had declared to those assembled, the mayor forgot the word ""confidence.""  The queen said aloud, ""Say _confidence_;--with pleasure and confidence.""",reach royal family go be do have go great city hall meet authority mayor receive welcome city king reply come pleasure confidence good person repeat king declare assemble mayor forget word confidence queen say say pleasure confidence 
11,"Then there were many speeches made, during which poor little Louis, tired as he was, had to wait.  Called up before five in the morning, and having sat so many hours in the carriage, with guns and pistols incessantly popping off, and yells and shouts from such a concourse of people, he might well be tired: but before they could go home, the king had to show himself in the balcony of the city hall, by torch-light, with a great tricolor cockade in his hat.  It was just eleven o'clock before they got to their palace of the Tuileries.",be many speech make poor little tired have wait call morning sit many hour carriage gun pistol popp yell shout concourse person tired go king have show balcony city hall torch light great tricolor cockade hat o'clock get palace 
12,"There everything was comfortless,--for there had been no notice of their coming.  The apartments had been occupied by the servants of the court, who, turning out in a hurry, left everything in confusion.  Probably Louis did not mind this,--glad enough to get to bed at all after such a long and dreary day.  This was the 6th of October.",comfortless be notice come apartment occupy servant court turn hurry leave confusion mind glad get bed long dreary day 6th
