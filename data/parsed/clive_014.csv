2," The house, of which the bedroom occupied by Charlie formed part, was elsewhere two stories higher; this room jutting out, alone, into the angle of the wall. The rest of the suite of rooms were in the house itself, but access could be obtained to this room through the window, which looked on to the terrace of the wall. Charlie's lieutenants always took pains to place men upon whom they could thoroughly rely as sentries, on this terrace.",house bedroom occupy form part story high room jut angle wall rest suite room house access obtain room window look terrace wall lieutenant take pain place man rely sentry terrace 
3,"One night, a fortnight after the events which have been described, Charlie was asleep on his bed, on the flats above his room. On one side the house rose straight beside it. On two others was the fall to the valley, on the fourth side was the wall, along which two sentries were pacing to and fro. From time to time, from a door some distance along the side of the house, opening on to the wall, a white figure came out, stretched himself as if unable to sleep, looked for a while over the parapet down into the valley, appeared to listen intently, and then sauntered into the house again.",night fortnight event describe asleep bed flat room side house rise other fall valley fourth side wall sentry pace for time time door distance side house open wall white figure come stretch unable sleep look while parapet valley appear listen saunter house 
4,"It was the cook, Hossein. It was his custom. Successive sentries had, for many nights past, seen him do the same; but in a country where the nights are hot, a sleepless servant attracts but little attention. Upon the occasion of one of these visits to the parapet, he stood in an attitude of deep attention, longer than usual. Then he carelessly sauntered back. It was but a moment later that his face appeared at the window next to that of Charlie's bedroom. He stretched his head out, and again listened intently. Then he went to Tim, who was sleeping heavily on a couch placed there, and touched him. He put his hand on his lips, as Tim sprang up.",cook custom successive sentry many night see do same country night hot sleepless servant attract little attention occasion visit parapet stand attitude deep attention long usual saunter moment face appear window bedroom stretch head listen go sleep couch place touch put hand lip spring 
5,"""Take arm,"" he said, in Hindostanee. ""Bad man coming.""",take arm say bad man come 
6,"Tim understood the words and, seizing a sword and pistol which lay close to the bedside, followed Hossein, who had glided up the stairs, with a drawn tulwar in his hand. At the moment he did so, there was a noise of heavy bodies dropping, followed by a sudden shout from Charlie. There was a sound of clashing of arms, and the report of a pistol.",understand word seize sword pistol lay bedside follow glide stair draw tulwar hand moment do be noise heavy body drop follow sudden shout be sound clashing arm report pistol 
7,"As Tim's eyes came on a level with the terrace, he saw Hossein bound with uplifted blade into the midst of a group of men in the corner. Three times the blade rose and fell, and each time a loud shriek followed. Then he disappeared in the midst.",eye come level terrace see bind uplift blade midst group man corner time blade rise fall time loud shriek follow disappear midst 
8,"Tim was but a few seconds behind him. Discharging his pistol into the body of one of the men, and running his sword into another, he, too, stood by the side of his master. Charlie, streaming with blood, was half sitting, half lying in the angle of the parapet. Hossein, his turban off, his long hair streaming down his back, was standing over him, fighting furiously against some ten men, who still pressed forward, while several others lay upon the ground.",few second discharg pistol body man run sword stand side master stream blood half sit half lie angle parapet turban long hair stream back stand fight man press several other lay ground 
9,"In spite of the arrival of Charlie's two allies, they still pressed forward, but the shots of the pistols had been echoed by the muskets of the sentries. Loud shouts were heard, showing that the alarm was sounding through the palace.",spite arrival ally press shot pistol echoe musket sentry loud shout hear show alarm sound palace 
10,"One more desperate effort the assailants made, to beat the two men who opposed them over the parapet, but Hossein and the Irishman stood firm. The weight and numbers of their opponents, however, told upon them; when the first of the sentries appeared upon the platform, followed closely by his comrade; and both, with levelled bayonets, charged into the fray.",desperate effort assailant make beat man oppose parapet stand firm weight number opponent tell first sentry appear platform follow comrade levell bayonet charge fray 
11,"The assailants now thought only of escape, but their position was a desperate one. Some rushed to the end of the terrace, and tried to climb the ropes by which they had slid down from the upper roof of the house. Others endeavoured to rush down the staircase; but Tim, with one of the sentries, guarded this point, until a rush of feet below told that the guard were coming to their assistance.",assailant think escape position desperate one rush end terrace try climb rope slide upper roof house other endeavour rush staircase sentry guard point rush foot tell guard come assistance 
12,"It was well that help was at hand, for the conspirators, desperate at finding themselves in a trap, gathering themselves together, rushed with the fury of wild beasts upon Tim and the sentry. One was impaled upon a bayonet, another cut down by Tim, and then, borne back by the weight of their opponents, they were hurled backwards down the stairs. As the assailants followed them with a rush, the guard sprang through the open window, from the terrace below, into the room.",help hand conspirator desperate find trap gather rush fury wild beast sentry impale bayonet cut borne weight opponent hurl stair assailant follow rush guard spring open window terrace room 
13,"There was a short and desperate conflict. Then two of the conspirators bounded up the staircase on to the roof, ran to the parapet and leaped over into the valley, two hundred feet below. They were the last of the eighteen men who had lowered themselves, from the roof above, to attack Charlie.",be short desperate conflict conspirator bound staircase roof run parapet leap valley foot last man lower roof attack 
14,"As soon as Tim picked himself up, he hastened to ascend the stairs again, and to run to the side of his master. Charlie was insensible. Leaning against the parapet, too weak to stand, but still holding his sword, and ready to throw himself once more before him, stood Hossein; who now, seeing Tim approach, and that all danger was over, dropped his sword and sank upon the ground.",pick hasten ascend stair run side master insensible lean parapet weak stand hold sword ready throw stand see approach danger drop sword sink ground 
15,"A minute or two later the rajah himself, sword in hand, hurried up. He was greatly concerned, and excited, at the sight which met his eyes. Charlie was at once lifted, and carried down to one of the rajah's own rooms, where he was instantly attended to.",minute sword hand hurry concerned excited sight meet eye lift carry own room attend 
16,"A hasty examination showed that only two of the attacking party still breathed. None of those who had fallen above survived, so fiercely and deadly had been the blows struck by Hossein and Tim. Charlie himself had cut down one and shot another, before he fell, slashed in many places, just as Hossein bounded through his assailants.",hasty examination show attack party breathe fall survive deadly blow strike cut shoot fall slash many place bound assailant 
17,"The bodies of the dead were, by the rajah's orders, laid together for identification in the morning. The two who still lived were carried to the guardroom, and their wounds dressed, in order that the names of their employers might be obtained from them.",body dead order lay identification morning live carry guardroom wound dress order name employer obtain 
18,"In the meantime, Charlie's lieutenants had hastily formed a body of their soldiers together, and these at once fell upon a number of men who were crowding up the steps to the palace, with shouts of ""Death to the Englishman."" A few volleys poured among these effectually scattered them, and they broke and hurried down the steep road, through the gates to the town, the sentries on the way offering no opposition, but many falling under the fire from the parapet of the fort.",meantime lieutenant form body soldier fall number man crowd step palace shout few volley pour scatter break hurry steep road gate town sentry way offer opposition many fall fire parapet fort 
19,"In ten minutes, all was over. The gates were again closed, and a strong guard placed over them, and the attempted insurrection was at an end.",minute gate close strong guard place attempt insurrection end 
20,"The native surgeon, who attended Charlie, pronounced that none of the five wounds he had received, although for the most part severe, were necessarily fatal; and that there was every chance of his recovery. Hossein's wounds, three in number, were pronounced to be more dangerous, one being a deep stab in the body, given by a man who had rushed at him, as he was guarding the blow of another. Tim's wounds were comparatively slight, and he suffered more from the bruises he had received, when hurled backwards down the stone staircase. However, with one arm in a sling, and his head bandaged, he was able to take his place by his master's bedside.",native surgeon attend pronounce none wound receive most part severe fatal be chance recovery wound number pronounce dangerous deep stab body give man rush guard blow wound slight suffer more bruise receive hurl stone staircase arm sling head bandage able take place master bedside 
21,"Having heard, from him, that it was entirely due to Hossein that Charlie's life had been saved, the rajah directed that every attention should be paid to him; and several times, during the night, Tim stole away to his bedside to press his hand, and call down blessings upon him.",hear due life save rajah direct attention pay several time night steal bedside press hand call blessing 
22,"The stanching of his wounds, and the application of strong restoratives, presently caused Charlie to open his eyes.",stanching wound application strong restorative cause open eye 
23,"""The Lord be praised, Mr. Charles,"" Tim said, ""that you're coming to yourself again. Don't you trouble, sir. We've done for the murdhering rascals; and, plase God, you'll soon be about again. Jist drink this draught, yer honor, and go off to sleep, if you can. In the morning I'll tell you all about it.",praise say come trouble sir do murdher rascal plase drink draught honor go sleep morning tell 
24,"""You're in the rajah's own room,"" he continued, seeing Charlie's eyes wander wonderingly around him, ""and all you've got to do is just to lie still, and get well as soon as you can.""",own room continue see eye wander get do lie get 
25,"It was a fortnight before Charlie, still very weak and feeble, was able to totter from his room to that in which Hossein was lying. He himself knew nothing of what had passed after he fell. The conflict had, to him, been little more than a dream. Awakened from sleep by the sound of his assailants, as they dropped from the ropes, he had leaped up as a rush of figures came towards him, catching up his sword and pistol as he did so. He had shot the first, and cut down the next who rushed at him, but at the same moment he had felt a sharp pain, and remembered no more.",fortnight weak feeble able totter room lie know pass fall conflict little more dream awaken sleep sound assailant drop rope leap rush figure come catching sword pistol do shoot first cut next rush same moment feel sharp pain remember more 
26,"Tim heard from Hossein, when the latter, two days after the fight, was able to speak, that he had suspected that some renewed attempt might be made upon his master's life; and that for many nights he had not slept, contenting himself with such repose as he could snatch in the daytime, between the intervals of preparing meals. A few minutes before the attack, he fancied he heard a movement on the roof of the house; and running to Charlie's room he had, from the window, seen some dark figures sliding down the wall. Then he roused Tim, and rushed up to the rescue.",hear latter day fight able speak suspect renew attempt make master life many night sleep content such repose snatch daytime interval prepare meal few minute attack fancy hear movement roof house run room window see dark figure slide wall rouse rush rescue 
27,"Tim eloquently described to his master the manner in which Hossein sprung upon his foes, and cut his way through, in time to drive back those who were hacking at him as he lay prostrate; and how he found him standing over him, keeping at bay the whole of his assailants.",describe master manner spring foe cut way time drive hack lay prostrate find stand keep bay whole assailant 
28,"Charlie, with difficulty, made his way to the bedside of the brave Mohammedan. The latter, however, did not know him. He was in the delirium of fever. He was talking rapidly to himself.",difficulty make way bedside brave latter know delirium fever talk 
29,"""He trusted me,"" he said. ""He gave me my life. Should I not give mine for him? Anyone else would have had me hung as a dog. I will watch. I will watch. He shall see that Hossein is not ungrateful.""",trust say give life give else have hang dog watch watch see ungrateful 
30,"Charlie's eyes filled with tears, as he looked at the wasted form of his follower.",eye fill tear look waste form follower 
31,"""Is there any hope for him?"" he asked the doctor.",be hope ask doctor 
32,"""It is possible, just possible that he may live,"" the latter said. ""Allah only knows.""",possible possible live latter say know 
33,"""Do all you can to save him,"" Charlie said. ""I shall be ever grateful to you, if you do.""",do save say grateful 
34,"Tim, now that his master could dispense with his services, transferred his attentions to the bedside of Hossein, and was unremitting in the care and attention with which he kept the bandages on his head cool with fresh water, and wetted his hot lips with refreshing drinks. It was another week before his illness took a turn. Then the fever left him, and he lay weak and helpless as an infant. Strong soups now took the place of the cooling drinks, and in a few days the native doctor was able to say, confidently, that the danger was passed, and that Hossein would recover.",master dispense service transfer attention bedside unremitt care attention keep bandage head cool fresh water wett hot lip refresh drink week illness take turn fever leave lay weak helpless infant strong soup take place cooling drink few day native doctor able say danger pass recover 
35,"In the meantime, the investigations of the rajah had brought to light the details of the conspiracy. The wounded men had confessed that they were employed by three of the principal persons at the rajah's court, one of them being the rajah's brother. The information, however, was scarcely needed; as it was found, in the morning, that their apartments were empty; they having fled with the men who had attacked the gates of the palace. These consisted partly of soldiers whom they had bribed, and of desperadoes from the town, who had singly entered the fort during the day, and had been concealed in the apartments of the conspirators, until the signal for attack was given.",meantime investigation rajah bring light detail conspiracy wound man confess employ principal person court brother information need find morning apartment empty flead man attack gate palace consist soldier bribe desperadoe town enter fort day conceal apartment conspirator signal attack give 
36,"The intention of the conspirators was not only to kill the Englishman, but to dethrone the rajah, and install his brother in his place. The attack had commenced with the attempt upon Charlie's life, because it was believed that his death would paralyse the troops who were faithful to the rajah.",intention conspirator kill dethrone install brother place attack commence attempt life believe death paralyse troops faithful rajah 
37,"At the end of six weeks, Charlie was able to resume his duties, and his appearance at the parade ground was hailed with enthusiastic shouts by the soldiers. The rajah was more attached to him than ever, and had again made him large presents, in token of the regret he felt at the sufferings he had endured in his cause.",end week able resume duty appearance parade ground hail enthusiastic shout soldier rajah attach make large present token regret feel suffering endure cause 
38,"Drilling was now carried on with redoubled energy, and large numbers of new levies had been summoned to the standard. A storm was gathering over Ambur. The rajah's brother was raising a force to attack him, and had, by means of large promises in case of success, persuaded Murari Reo to take up his cause; and he had, it was said, also sent messages to the nizam, pointing out that, in case of war with the English, the Rajah of Ambur would be a thorn in his side. He told of the numbers of troops who had been drilled, and how formidable such a force would be, if opposed to him at a critical moment; while if he, the claimant, gained power, the army of Ambur would be at the disposal of the nizam.",drilling carry redoubl energy large number new levy summon standard storm gather brother raise force attack means large promise case success persuade take cause say send message point case war thorn side tell number troops drill formidable force oppose critical moment claimant gain power army disposal nizam 
39,"The rajah, on his side, had also sent messengers to Hyderabad, with assurances to the nizam of his fidelity and friendship. He urged that the preparations he had made were intended solely for the defence of his state, against marauding bands of Mahrattas, and especially against those of Murari Reo, who was a scourge to all his neighbours.",rajah side send messenger assurance nizam fidelity friendship urge preparation make intend defence state maraud band scourge neighbour 
40,"In the meantime, every effort was made to strengthen the defences of Ambur. The walls surrounding the town were repaired, and although these, in themselves, could have offered but a slight defence to a determined assault, the approaches to the town were all covered by the guns of the fort above.",meantime effort make strengthen defence wall surround town repair offer slight defence determine assault approach town cover gun fort 
41,"The weak point of the defence was the hill behind the town. This sloped up, gradually, to a point higher than the level of the projecting rock upon which the castle stood. It then rose, in rugged cliffs, some two hundred feet higher; and then fell away again, steeply, to its summit. This was too far back for the fire of guns placed upon it to injure the castle or town. Guns placed, however, at the foot of the rocky wall, would dominate the castle and render it, at last, untenable.",weak point defence hill town slope point high level project rock castle stand rise rugged cliff foot high fall summit fire gun place injure castle town gun place foot rocky wall dominate castle render last untenable 
42,"Charlie had often looked, with an anxious eye, at this point; and one morning, accompanied by the rajah, he rode up to examine the position. The highest point of the slope, at the foot of the crag, was nearly opposite the castle; and it was here that an active enemy, making his way along the slope, would place his guns. Here, Charlie determined to establish a battery.",look anxious eye point morning accompany rajah ride examine position high point slope foot crag castle active enemy make way slope place gun determine establish battery 
43,"News had arrived that the rajah's brother had raised a force of three thousand men; and that, with seven thousand Mahrattas, he was about to march. This force, Charlie felt certain that he could meet and defeat, in the open. But more disquieting news was that Bussy, hearing that the rajah's troops had been trained by an Englishman, had advised the nizam to declare for his rival, and to send a considerable force to his assistance, if necessary. Fresh messengers were sent off, with new assurances of the rajah's loyalty to the nizam.",news arrive brother raise force man about march force feel certain meet defeat open disquieting news hear troops train advise nizam declare rival send considerable force assistance necessary fresh messenger send new assurance rajah loyalty nizam 
44,"""It may not do much good,"" Charlie said, ""but if we can induce him to remain quiet, until we have defeated Murari Reo, it will be so much gained.""",do good say induce remain quiet defeat gain 
45,"Charlie himself despatched a messenger to Mr. Saunders, begging that assistance might be sent to the rajah.",despatch messenger begg assistance send rajah 
46,"Having decided upon the position for a battery, energetic steps were taken to form it. A space large enough for the construction of the battery, and for the tents and stores of the artillerymen and two hundred infantry, was marked out; and the rajah ordered the whole population of Ambur, men, women, and children, to assist at the work. The troops, too, were all employed; and under Charlie's superintendence, a wondrous change was soon effected. The spot chosen was levelled, a strong earthwork was erected round it, and then the surrounding ground was removed. This was a work of immense labour, the ground consisting first of a layer of soil, then of debris which had fallen from the face of the rock above, stones and boulders, to the depth of some fifteen feet, under which was the solid earth.",decide position battery energetic step take form space large construction battery tent store artillerymen infantry mark rajah order whole population man woman child assist work troops employ superintendence wondrous change effect spot choose levell strong earthwork erect surround ground remove work immense labour ground consist first layer soil debris fall face rock stone boulder depth foot solid earth 
47,"The slope resembled an anthill. The soldiers and able-bodied men broke up the boulders and rock with sledgehammers; or, when necessary, with powder, and blasted the rock, when needed. The women and children carried away the fragments in baskets. The work lasted for a fortnight, at the end of which a position of an almost impregnable nature was formed. At the foot of the earthworks protecting the guns, both at the face and sides, the ground, composed of great boulders and stones, sloped steeply out, forming a bank fifteen feet deep. At its foot, again, the solid rock was blasted away, so as to form a deep chasm, thirty feet wide and ten feet high, round the foot of the fort. For a hundred yards on each side, the earth and stones had been entirely removed down to the solid rock.",slope resemble anthill soldier able bodied man break boulder rock sledgehammer necessary powder blast rock need woman child carry fragment basket work last fortnight end position impregnable nature form foot earthwork protect gun face side ground compose great boulder stone slope form bank foot deep foot solid rock blast form deep chasm foot wide foot high foot fort yard side earth stone remove solid rock 
48,"Ten guns were placed in the battery, and the fire of these swept the slopes behind the town and castle, rendering it impossible, until the fort was carried, for an enemy to attack the town on that side; or to operate, in any way, against the only point at which an attack could be made upon the castle.",gun place battery fire sweep slope town castle rendering impossible fort carry enemy attack town side operate way only point attack make castle 
49,"The rajah was delighted at this most formidable accession to the defensive power of his fortress, which was now in a position to defy any attack which could be made against it. A store of provisions and ammunition was collected there, and the command given to one of Charlie's Sepoy lieutenants, with a hundred trained artillerymen, and two hundred infantry. Numbers of cattle had been driven into the town and castle, and stores of provisions collected.",rajah delight formidable accession defensive power fortress position defy attack make store provision ammunition collect command give lieutenant train artillerymen infantry number cattle drive town castle store provision collect 
50,"It was but two days after the battery was complete that the news arrived that the rajah's brother, with Murari Reo, had entered the rajah's dominions, and was marching up the valley to the assault. The rajah had, in the first place, wished to defend a strong gorge through which the enemy would have to pass; this having hitherto been considered the defensible point of his capital, against an invasion. Charlie pointed out, however, that although no doubt a successful defence might be made here, it would only be a repulse, which would leave the enemy but little weakened for further operations. He argued that it was better to allow them to advance to the point where the valley opened out into a plain, some two miles wide. He had no doubt whatever that the rajah's troops would be able to inflict a crushing defeat upon the invaders, who would be so disheartened, thereby, that they would be little likely to renew the attack.",day battery complete news arrive brother enter dominion march valley assault first place wish defend strong gorge enemy have pass consider defensible point capital invasion point doubt successful defence make repulse leave enemy little weaken further operation argue good allow advance point valley open plain mile wide have doubt troops able inflict crush defeat invader disheartened little likely renew attack 
51,"Two bodies of troops, each three hundred strong, were sent down to the gorge, with orders to remain in hiding among the heights, to allow the invading army to pass unmolested, and then to inflict the greatest possible loss upon them, as they returned. These were under the command of another of Charlie's lieutenants, who received orders from him to erect breastworks of rock on the slopes above the entrance to the gorge, after the enemy had passed on; and to line these with a portion of his men, who should pour a heavy fire into the enemy as they came down the valley; while the rest were to line the heights above the gorge, and to roll down rocks upon those who passed through the fire of their comrades.",body troops strong send gorge order remain hiding height allow invade army pass unmolested inflict great possible loss return command lieutenant receive order erect breastwork rock slope entrance gorge enemy pass line portion man pour heavy fire enemy come valley rest line height gorge roll rock pass fire comrade 
52,"The uniforms were served out to the soldiers, and Charlie surveyed, with pride, the five battalions of trained troops which, with twelve guns, marched down into the valley and took up their post beyond it, at a point which he had carefully chosen, where the guns of the castle would be able to play upon an advancing body of troops. A body of trained artillerymen were told off for this service, and the last-raised levies were posted in the castle and on the walls of the town.",uniform serve soldier survey pride battalion train troops gun march valley take post point choose gun castle able play advance body troops body train artillerymen tell service last raise levy post castle wall town 
53,"The position was so chosen that the flanks of the line rested on the slopes on either side. These were broken by inclosures and gardens; into which, on either side, half a battalion was thrown forward, so as to deliver a flanking fire upon an enemy advancing against the centre. Across the valley, two hundred yards in front of the position, the stream which watered it made a sharp turn, running for some distance directly across it, and several small canals for the irrigation of the fields rendered the ground wet and swampy. Across the line occupied by his troops, a breastwork had been thrown up, and in front of this rows of sharp-pointed stakes had been stuck in the ground. Altogether, the position was a formidable one.",position choose flank line rest slope side break inclosure garden side battalion throw deliver flank fire enemy advance centre valley yard front position stream water make sharp turn run distance several small canal irrigation field render ground wet swampy line occupy troops breastwork throw front row sharp point stake stick ground position formidable one 
54,"An hour or two after the position so carefully prepared had been taken up, large bodies of Mahratta horse were seen dashing up the valley, and smoke rising from several points showed that they had begun their usual work, of plundering and destroying the villages on their way. A few discharges from the field pieces--those in the castle had been ordered to be silent until the raising of a white flag gave them the signal to open fire--checked the advance of the horsemen, and these waited until their infantry should arrive.",hour position prepare take large body horse see dash valley smoke rise several point show begin usual work plunder destroy village way few discharge field piece castle order silent raising white flag give signal open fire check advance horsemen wait infantry arrive 
55,"The force of Murari Reo was, at that time, the most formidable of any purely native army of Southern India. Recruited from desperadoes from all the Mahratta tribes, well disciplined by its leader, it had more than once fought, without defeat, against bodies of Europeans; while it had, in all cases, obtained easy victories over other native armies.",force time formidable native army southern recruit desperadoe tribe disciplined leader have more fight defeat body case obtain easy victory other native army 
56,"Presently the horsemen opened, and a compact body of three thousand Mahratta infantry, accompanied by an equal number of the irregulars of the rajah's brother, advanced to the attack; while the cavalry at their sides swept down upon the flanks of the rajah's position, and thirty pieces of artillery opened fire.",horsemen open compact body infantry accompany equal number irregular brother advance attack cavalry side sweep flank position piece artillery open fire 
57,"Not a shot was fired in return, Charlie ordering his men to lie down behind the breastworks, until they received the word of command to show themselves. The Mahratta horsemen, compelled by the bends of the stream to keep near the foot of the slopes, came forward in gallant style; until suddenly, from every wall and every clump of bushes on the slopes above them, a tremendous fire of musketry broke out, while the twelve field guns, six of which were posted on either side of Charlie's centre, poured a destructive fire into them. So deadly was the rain of iron and lead that the Mahratta horsemen instantly drew bridle and, leaving the ground strewn with their dead, galloped back.",shot fire return order man lie breastwork receive word command show horsemen compel bend stream keep foot slope come gallant style wall clump bush slope tremendous fire musketry break field gun post side centre pour destructive fire deadly rain iron lead horsemen draw bridle leave ground strewn dead gallop 
58,"By this time the infantry, covered by the fire of their artillery, had reached the stream. This was waist deep, and the banks were some two feet above its level. As they scrambled up after crossing it, from the line of embankment in front of them a tremendous fire was opened. Although mowed down in scores, the seasoned warriors of the Mahratta chief, cheered on by his voice as, recklessly exposing himself, he rode among them, pressed forward. Ever increasing numbers gained a footing across the stream, those in front keeping up a heavy fire at the breastwork, whose face was ploughed by their cannon shot.",time infantry cover fire artillery reach stream waist deep bank foot level scramble cross line embankment front tremendous fire open mow score seasoned warrior chief cheer voice expose ride press increase number gain footing stream front keep heavy fire breastwork face plough can non shot 
59,"As they advanced the guns of the castle opened fire, not upon those in front, for these were too near the line of entrenchment, but upon the struggling mass still crossing the stream, into which a ceaseless fire of musketry was poured from the slopes on their flanks. Still the Mahratta infantry struggled bravely on, until within a few yards of the entrenchments. Then, suddenly, with a mighty shout, the rajah's troops leaped to their feet, poured a volley from the crest of the breastwork into the enemy; and then, with fixed bayonets, flung themselves upon them.",advance gun castle open fire front line entrenchment struggle mass cross stream ceaseless fire musketry pour slope flank infantry struggle few yard entrenchment mighty shout rajah troops leap foot pour volley crest breastwork enemy fix bayonet flung 
60,"The effect was decisive. The Mahrattas had, at the commencement of the fight, scarcely outnumbered the troops of the rajah in front of them, and had derived but little assistance from the levies of their ally; who, indeed, had contented themselves with keeping up a fire upon the defenders of the slopes. They had already suffered very severely, and the charge made upon them, along the whole line, was irresistible.",effect decisive commencement fight outnumber troops rajah front derive little assistance levy ally content keep fire defender slope suffer charge make whole line irresistible 
61,"Before the bayonets crossed they broke and fled, hotly pursued by the troops of the rajah. These, in accordance with Charlie's orders, did not scatter, but kept in a close line, four deep, which advanced, pouring tremendous volleys into their foe.",bayonet cross break flead pursue troops rajah accordance order scatter keep close line deep advance pour tremendous volley foe 
62,"In vain did Murari Reo endeavour to rally his men. His infantry, all order lost, fled at the top of their speed, their flight covered by their cavalry, who sacrificed themselves in two or three brilliant charges, right up to the line of pursuers, although suffering terribly from the withering volleys poured into their ranks.",vain do endeavour rally man infantry order lose flead top speed flight cover cavalry sacrifice brilliant charge line pursuer suffer wither volley pour rank 
63,"The troops were now formed into heavy columns, and these rapidly marched down the valley, after their flying enemy. An hour later, the sound of heavy firing was heard in front, and at redoubled speed the troops pressed onward. When they arrived, however, at the gorge, they found that the last of the fugitives had passed through. The ground in front was strewn with dead and dying, for as the mass of fugitives had arrived at the gorge, the infantry from above had opened fire upon them. Several times the frightened throng had recoiled, but at last, impelled by the greater fear of their pursuers behind, they had dashed forward through the fire, only to fall in hundreds in the gorge, crushed beneath the rain of rocks showered down upon them from above.",troops form heavy column march valley fly enemy hour sound heavy fire hear front redoubl speed troops press arrive gorge find last fugitive pass ground front strewn dead die mass fugitive arrive gorge infantry open fire several time frighten throng recoil last impell great fear pursuer dash fire fall hundred gorge crush rain rock shower
