2," It was a great annoyance to Captain Sinclair to have to wait in this manner, but there was no help for it. He was satisfied that it was the most prudent course, and therefore raised no objection. Alfred too was uneasy at the delay, as he was aware how anxious his father and mother would be during the whole time of their absence. They were glad, however, to find that the Indian woman recovered rapidly, and on the fifth day of their taking up their abode in the forest, she said that she was able to travel if they walked slow. It was therefore agreed that on the sixth day they should start again, and they did so, having saved their salt provisions, that they might not be compelled to stop, or use their rifles to procure food. The evening before, they roasted as much venison as they thought they could consume while it was good, and at daylight again proceeded, not to follow the trail, but guided by the Indian woman, in a direct course for the lodges of the Indian band under the Angry Snake.",great annoyance have wait manner be help satisfied prudent course raise objection uneasy delay aware anxious father mother whole time absence glad find indian woman recover fifth day take abode forest say able travel walk slow agree sixth day start do save salt provision compel stop use rifle procure food evening roast much venison think consume good daylight proceed follow trail guide indian woman direct course lodge indian band angry 
3,"As they had now only to proceed as fast as they could without tiring the poor Indian woman, whose head was bound up, and who was still weak from loss of blood, they made a tolerable day's journey, and halted as before. Thus they continued their route till the sixth day, when as they drew up for the night, the Indian stated that they were only three or four miles from the Indians' lodges, which they sought. Thereupon a council was held as to how they should proceed, and at last it was agreed upon that they should be guided by the Indian woman to a spot where they might be concealed, as near as possible to the lodges, and that when the party had arrived there, that the woman and Malachi should go and reconnoiter, to ascertain whether the chief and his band with Mary Percival had returned or not. The night was passed very impatiently, and without sleep by most of them, so anxious were they for the morrow. Long before break of day they again started, advancing with great caution, and were led by the Indian till they were within one hundred and fifty yards of the lodges, in a thick cluster of young spruce, which completely secured them from discovery. Shortly afterward Malachi and the Indian woman, creeping on all fours, disappeared in the surrounding brush wood, that they might, if possible, gain more intelligence from listening. In the meantime, the party had their eyes on the lodges, waiting to see who should come out as soon as the sun rose, for it was hardly clear daybreak when they arrived at their place of concealment.",have proceed tiring poor indian woman head bind weak loss blood make tolerable day journey halt continue route sixth day draw night state mile lodge seek council hold proceed last agree guide indian woman spot conceal possible lodge party arrive woman go reconnoiter ascertain chief band return night pass sleep most anxious morrow long break day start advance great caution lead yard lodge thick cluster young spruce secure discovery indian woman creep four disappear surround brush wood possible gain more intelligence listen meantime party have eye lodge wait see come sun rise clear daybreak arrive place concealment 
4,"They had remained there about half an hour, when they perceived an Indian lad come out of one of the lodges. He was dressed in leggins and Indian shirt of deer skin, and carried in his hand his bow and arrows. An eagle's feather was stuck in his hair above the left ear, which marked him as the son of a chief.",remain hour perceive indian lad come lodge dress leggin indian shirt deer skin carry hand bow arrow eagle feather stuck hair left ear mark son chief

11,"""No,"" replied John, ""but they don't trust him with a rifle.""",reply trust rifle 
12,"They waited some little time longer, when an Indian woman, and then an old man, came out, and in about a quarter of an hour afterward, three more women and an Indian about twenty years old.",wait little time indian woman old man come quarter hour more woman indian year old 
13,"""I think we have the whole force now,"" said Martin.",think have whole force say 
14,"""Yes, I think so too,"" replied Captain Sinclair. ""I wish Malachi would come back, for I do not think he will find out more than we know ourselves.""",think reply wish come think find more know 
15,"In about half an hour afterward, Malachi and the Indian woman returned; they had crept in the brushwood to within fifty yards of the lodges, but were afraid to go nearer, as the woman said that perhaps the dogs might give the alarm; for two of them were left at home. The woman stated her conviction that the party had not come back, and now a council was again held as to their proceedings. The Indian force was nothing--an old man, one lad of twenty, and four women. These might be easily captured and secured, but the question was whether it would be desirable so to do, as in case one should by any means escape, information of their arrival might be conveyed to the absent party, and induce them not to come home with Mary Percival. This question was debated in a low tone between Malachi, Captain Sinclair, and Alfred. At last John interrupted them by saying, ""They are going out to hunt, the old and the young Indian and Percival--they have all their bows and arrows.""",hour indian woman return creep brushwood yard lodge afraid go woman say dog give alarm leave home woman state conviction party come council hold proceedings indian force old man lad woman capture secure question desirable do case means escape information arrival convey absent party induce come question debate low tone last interrupt say go hunt old young indian have bow arrow 
16,"""The boy is right,"" said Malachi. ""Well, I consider this to decide the question. We can now capture the men without the women knowing any thing about it. They will not expect them home till the evening, and even if they do not come, they will not be surprised or alarmed; so now we had better let them go some way, and then follow them. If we secure them, we can then decide what to do about the women.""",boy right say consider decide question capture man woman know thing expect evening come surprise alarm have good let go way follow secure decide do woman 
17,"This was agreed upon, and Malachi explained their intentions to the Indian woman, who approved of them, but said, ""The Old Raven (referring to the old Indian) is very cunning; you must be careful.""",agree explain intention indian woman approve say old refer old cunning careful 
18,"The party remained in their place of concealment for another quarter of an hour, till the two Indians and Percival had quitted the open space before the lodges, and had entered the woods. They then followed in a parallel direction, Malachi and John going ahead: Martin and Alfred following so as to keep them in sight, and the remainder of the party at about the same distance behind Martin and Alfred. They continued in this manner their course through the woods for more than an hour, when a herd of deer darted past Malachi and John. They immediately stopped, and crouched, to hide themselves. Martin and Alfred perceiving this, followed their example, and the rest of the party behind, at the motion of the Strawberry, did the same. Hardly had they done so, when one of the herd, which had been pierced by an arrow, followed in the direction of the rest, and after a few bounds fell to the earth. A minute or two afterward the hunters made their appearance, and stood by the expiring beast, where they remained for a minute or two talking, and then took out their knives to flay and cut it up. While they were thus employed, Malachi and John on one side, Alfred and Martin from another direction, and the rest of the party from a third, were creeping slowly up toward them; but to surround them completely it was necessary the main party should divide, and send one or two more to the eastward. Captain Sinclair dispatched Graves and one of the soldiers, desiring them to creep very softly till they arrived at a spot he pointed out, and then to wait for the signal to be given.",party remain place concealment quarter hour quit open space lodge enter wood follow parallel direction go follow keep sight remainder party same distance continue manner course wood more hour herd deer dart stop crouch hide perceive follow example rest party motion do same do herd pierce arrow follow direction rest few bound fall earth minute hunter make appearance stand expire beast remain minute talk take knife flay cut employ side direction rest party third creep surround necessary main party divide send more eastward dispatch soldier desire creep arrive spot point wait signal give 
19,"As the parties gradually approached nearer and nearer to the Indians and Percival, the Old Raven appeared to be uneasy; he looked round and round him and once or twice laid his ear on the ground; whenever he did this, they all stopped, and almost held their breaths.",party approach old appear uneasy look lay ear ground do stop hold breath 
20,"""The Indian woman says that the Old Raven is suspicious; he is sure that some one is in the woods near him, and she thinks that she had better go to him,"" said the Strawberry to Captain Sinclair.",indian woman say old suspicious sure one wood think good go say 
21,"""Let her go,"" said Captain Sinclair.",let go say 
22,"The Indian rose, and walked up in the direction of the Indians, who immediately turned to her as she approached. She spoke to them, and appeared to be telling them how it was that she returned. At all events, she occupied the attention of the Old Raven till the parties were close to them, when Malachi arose, and immediately all the others did the same, and rushed upon them. After a short and useless struggle, they were secured, but not before the younger Indian had wounded one of the soldiers, by stabbing him with his knife. The thongs were already fast round the arms and legs of the Indians, when Percival, who had not been tied, again attempted to escape, and by the direction of Malachi, he was bound, as well as the other two.",indian rose walk direction turn approach speak appear tell return event occupy attention old party close arise other do same rush short useless struggle secure young wound soldier stabbing knife thong fast arm leg tie attempt escape direction bind other 
23,"As soon as the prisoners were secured, Martin and Graves and the soldiers employed themselves cutting up the venison and preparing it for dinner, while the Strawberry and the Indian woman were collecting wood for a fire. In the meanwhile Captain Sinclair, Malachi, and John were seated by the prisoners, and directing their attention to Percival, whom they had been compelled to bind, that he might not make his escape; for his sojourn of nearly two years in the woods with the Indians, without seeing the face of a white man, had (as has been invariably proved to be the fact in every instance where the parties were very young) wholly obliterated, for the time, his recollections of his former life--so rapid is our falling off to the savage state. To the questions of Alfred he returned no reply, and appeared not to understand him.",prisoner secure soldier employ cut venison prepare dinner indian woman collect wood fire meanwhile seat prisoner direct attention compel bind make escape sojourn year wood see face white man have prove fact instance party young obliterate time recollection former life rapid fall savage state question return reply appear understand 
24,"""Let me try him, sir,"" said Malachi, ""I will speak to him in the Indian tongue, he has perhaps forgotten his own. It's wonderful how soon we return to a state of nature when we are once in the woods.""",let try sir say speak indian tongue forget own wonderful return state nature wood

28,"""Why, the boy is metamorphosed,"" said Captain Sinclair; ""is it possible that so short a time could have produced this?""",boy metamorphose say possible short time produce 
29,"""Yes, sir,"" replied Malachi; ""in young people a very short time will change them thus, but it won't last long. If he were to meet again with his mother at the settlement, he would by degrees forget his Indian life and become reconciled; a woman has more effect than a man. Let the Strawberry speak to him. You see, sir, he is bound, and considers himself a captive, and let him loose we must not, until we have done our work; after that, there will be no fear, and when he has been with us a short time, he will come all right again.""",sir reply young person short time change last meet mother settlement degree forget indian life become reconcile woman have more effect man let speak see sir bind consider captive let lose do work be fear short time come 
30,"Malachi called the Strawberry, and told her to speak to Percival about his home and his mother, and every thing connected with the farm.",call tell speak home mother thing connect farm 
31,"The Strawberry sat down by Percival, and in her soft tones talked to him in her own tongue of his father and mother, of his cousins, and how he had been taken by the Indians when he was hunting; how his mother had wept for him, and all had lamented his loss; running on in a low musical key from one thing to another connected and associated with his former life in the settlement, and it was evident that at last he now listened with attention. The Strawberry continued to talk to him thus, for more than an hour, when Alfred again addressed him and said, ""Percival, don't you know me?""",sit soft tone talk own tongue father mother cousin take hunt mother goot lament loss run low musical key thing connect associate former life settlement evident last listen attention continue talk more hour address say know 
32,"""Yes,"" replied Percival in English, ""I do; you are my brother Alfred.""",reply brother 
33,"""All's right now, sir,"" said Malachi; ""only he must be kept fast; but the lad's coming to his senses again. The Strawberry will talk to him again by and by.""",sir say keep fast lad come sense talk 
34,"They then sat down to their meal; the two Indians were removed to a distance under the guard of one of the soldiers, but Percival remained with them. John sat by Percival, and cutting off a tempting bit of venison, held it to his mouth, saying to him, ""Percival, when we go home again, your hands shall be untied, and you shall have a rifle of your own instead of a bow and arrows; come, eat this.""",sit meal remove distance guard soldier remain sit cut tempting bit venison hold mouth say go hand unty have rifle own bow arrow come eat 
35,"This was a long speech for John, but it produced its effect, for Percival opened his mouth for the venison, and being fed by John, made a very good dinner. As soon as their meal was over, they consulted as to what steps should next be taken. The question discussed was whether they should now capture the women who were left in the lodges, or remain quiet till the Angry Snake and his party arrived?",long speech produce effect open mouth venison feed make good dinner meal consult step take question discuss capture woman leave lodge remain quiet angry party arrive 
36,Malachi's opinion was as follows:--,opinion follow 
37,"""I think we had at all events better wait till to-morrow, sir; you see, the women will not be at all surprised at the hunting party not returning for even a day or two, as they know that they will not return without game, and may not find it immediately; their absence, therefore, will create no suspicion of our being here. I think we should return to our former place of concealment, and watch their motions. There is no saying when the party with Miss Percival may return, they may have arrived while we have been away, or they may come to-morrow. It will be better, therefore, not to encumber ourselves with more prisoners unless it is necessary.""",think have event good wait sir see woman surprise hunting party return day know return game find absence create suspicion think return former place concealment watch motion be say party return arrive come good encumber more prisoner necessary 
38,"This opinion was at last assented to, and they set off, on their return to the Indian lodges. They arrived about an hour before dusk at their hiding-place, having taken the precaution to gag the two Indians for fear of their giving a whoop as notice of their capture. Percival was very quiet, and had begun to talk a little with John.",opinion last assent set return indian lodge arrive hour dusk hiding place take precaution geg fear give whoop notice capture quiet begin talk little

46,"""Yes, my good fellow, but if you wish her nearer, you must be prudent.""",good fellow wish prudent 
47,"""True, very true,"" replied Captain Sinclair.",true true reply

53,"""All's right so far, sir,"" observed Malachi; ""they have left her to the charge of the two women in a lodge by herself, and so there will be no fear for her when we make the attack, which I think we must do very shortly, for if it is quite dark, some of them may escape, and may trouble us afterward.""",right sir observe leave charge woman lodge be fear make attack think do dark escape trouble

No, sir, the Strawberry can be left with the prisoners. I'll give her my hunting-knife; that will be sufficient.""",good sir reply boy hear crack rifle leave prisoner join sure sir leave prisoner give hunting knife sufficient 
63,"They remained for about half an hour more watching the lodges, but every thing appeared quiet, and not a single person came out. Having examined the priming of the rifles, every man was directed to take up a certain position, so as to surround the buildings and support each other. John was appointed to the office of looking after his cousin Mary, and preventing the women from escaping with her from the lodge in which she was confined; and John took his office willingly, as he considered it one of importance, although it had been given him more with a view that he might not be exposed to danger. Leaving the prisoners to the charge of the Strawberry, who, with her knife drawn, stood over them, ready to act upon the slightest attempt of escape on their part, the whole party now crept softly toward the lodges, by the same path as had been taken by Malachi and the Indian woman. As soon as they had all arrived, they waited for a few minutes, while Malachi reconnoitered, and when they perceived that he did so, they all rose up and hastened to their allotted stations round the lodge into which the Angry Snake and his followers had entered. The Indians appeared to be asleep, for every thing remained quiet.",remain hour watch lodge thing appear quiet single person come examine priming rifle man direct take certain position surround building support other appoint office look cousin prevent woman escape lodge confine take office consider importance give more view expose danger leave prisoner charge knife draw stand ready act slight attempt escape part whole party creep lodge same path take indian woman arrive wait few minute reconnoiter perceive rise hasten allot station lodge angry follower enter appear asleep thing remain quiet

65,"""Do you do it, then,"" said Alfred; ""there are plenty of us without you.""",do say be plenty 
66,"Captain Sinclair hastened to the lodge in which Miss Percival had been placed, and opened the door. Mary Percival, as soon as she beheld Captain Sinclair, uttered a loud scream of delight, and, rising from the skins on which she had been laid, fell upon his neck. Captain Sinclair caught her in his arms, and was bearing her out of the lodge, when an Indian woman caught him by the coat; but John, who had entered, putting the muzzle of his rifle into their faces, they let go and retreated, and Captain Sinclair bore away Mary in his arms into the brushwood, where the Strawberry was standing over the Indian prisoners. The scream of Mary Percival had roused the Indians, who, after their exhaustion and privations, were in a sound sleep; but still no movement was to be heard in the lodge, and a debate, between Malachi and Alfred, whether they should enter the lodge or not, was put an end to by a rifle being fired from the lodge, and the fall of one of the soldiers, who was next to Alfred. Another shot followed, and Martin received a bullet in his shoulder, and then out bounded the Angry Snake, followed by his band, the chief whirling his tomahawk, and springing upon Malachi, while the others attacked Alfred and Martin, who were nearest to the door of the lodge. The rifle of Malachi met the breast of the Angry Snake as he advanced, and the contents were discharged through his body. The other Indians fought desperately, but the whole of the attacking party closing in, they were overpowered. Only two of them, however, were taken alive, and these were seriously wounded. They were tied and laid on the ground.",hasten lodge place open door beheld utter loud scream delight rise skin lay fall neck catch arm bear lodge indian woman catch coat enter put muzzle rifle face let go retreat bear arm brushwood stand indian prisoner scream rouse exhaustion privation sound sleep movement hear lodge debate enter lodge put end rifle fire lodge fall soldier shot follow receive bullet shoulder bound angry follow band chief whirl tomahawk spring other attack near door lodge rifle meet breast angry advance content discharge body other fight whole attack party close overpower take alive wound tie lay ground

76,"The two women, who had been in the lodge with Mary Percival, had remained where they were, as John's rifle had kept them from leaving the lodge; but the other two had escaped into the woods during the affray. This was of little consequence; indeed, the others were told that they might go away, if they would; and as soon as they heard this from Malachi, they followed the example of their companions. John and Graves brought out all the arms they could find, and Malachi and Alfred then went to the bushes to which Mary Percival and Sinclair had previously retired. Alfred embraced his cousin, who was still too greatly agitated to say much, being almost overpowered by the sudden transition in all her thoughts and feelings:--and, in the variety of her emotions, perhaps the most bewildering was that occasioned by the re-appearance of Percival,--like a restoration from the dead. Alfred was in consultation with Malachi, when he perceived the flames bursting out of the lodges. Martin, as soon as his wound was dressed, had returned and set fire to them.",woman lodge remain rifle keep leave lodge other escape wood affray little consequence other tell go hear follow example companion bring arm find go bush retire embrace cousin agitated say much overpower sudden transition thought feeling variety emotion bewildering occasion re-appearance restoration dead consultation perceive flame burst lodge wound dress return set fire

As soon as the flames are down, we will take up our quarters in the clearing, and set a watch for the night; and to-morrow, with the help of God, we will commence our journey back.
