2,"The next morning was fine, and as soon as breakfast was over, they took the wheels down to the turtle-pond, and Ready having speared one of the largest by means of a pike with a barb to it, which he had made on purpose, they hauled it on shore, slung it under the wheels, and took it up to the house.  Having killed the turtle, and cut it up, Juno, under the directions of Ready, chose such portions as were required for the soup; and when the pot was on the fire, Ready, Mr Seagrave, and William set off with the cross-cut saw and hatchets, to commence felling the cocoa-nut trees for the building of the outhouse, which was to hold their stores, as soon as they could be brought round from the other side of the island.",next morning fine breakfast take wheel turtle pond ready spear large means pike barb make purpose haul shore sling wheel take house kill turtle cut direction ready choose such portion require soup pot fire ready set cross cut saw hatchet commence fell cocoa nut tree building outhouse hold store bring other side island 
3,"""I mean this to be our place of refuge in case of danger, sir,"" observed Ready; ""and therefore I have selected this thick part of the wood, as it is not very far from the house, and by cutting the path to it in a zigzag, it will be quite hidden from sight; and we must make the path just wide enough to allow the wheels to pass, and stump up the roots of the trees which we are obliged to cut down, otherwise the stumps would attract attention.""",mean place refuge case danger sir observe ready select thick part wood house cut path zigzag hide sight make path wide allow wheel pass stump root tree oblige cut stump attract attention 
4,"""I agree with you, Ready,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""there is no saying what may happen.""",agree ready reply be say happen 
5,"""You see, sir, it is often the custom for the natives, in this part of the world, to come in their canoes from one island to another, merely to get cocoa-nuts.  I can't say that the other islands near us are inhabited, but still it is probable, and we cannot tell what the character of the people may be.  I tell you this, but we had better not say a word to Mrs Seagrave, as it may distress her.""",see sir custom native part world come canoe island get cocoa- nut say other island inhabit probable tell character person tell say word distress

7,"""We are now near the spot, sir.  You see, when we have got over this hill, where the trees are so very thick, the fall in the ground will assist in the concealment of the building.  I should say we are very near right where we now stand.""",spot sir see get hill tree thick fall ground assist concealment building say stand

12,"As soon as they had planned the building, the axes and saw were in full use, and tree after tree fell one upon the other.

15,"""Tommy and I are at variance,"" replied Mrs Seagrave.  ""I had my thimble this morning, and had commenced my sewing, when I was called out by Juno, and Caroline went with me, and Tommy was left in the house.  When I came back I found him outside, and on going back to my work, there was no thimble to be found; I asked him if he had touched it, and his answer was that he would look for it.  He did look, and said he could not find it; I have asked him several times if he took it away, and his only answer is that he will find it by and by.""",variance reply have thimble morning commence sewing call go leave house come find go work be thimble find ask touch answer look look say find ask several time take only answer find

22,"Master Tommy began to cry at this intelligence.  Juno appeared with the turtle-soup; and Tommy cried louder when they had said grace and commenced their dinner.

24,"""No wonder he said he would find it by and by,"" said Ready, smiling; ""he meant to have fished it up, I suppose, from what was left of the soup after dinner.  Well, Mrs Seagrave, I don't mean to say that Tommy is a good boy, but still, although he would not tell where the thimble was, he has not told a falsehood about it.""",wonder say find say ready smile mean fish suppose leave soup dinner mean say good boy tell thimble tell falsehood

37,"""Certainly, ma'am, if you wish it,"" replied Ready.  ""When I left off, I was on board of the collier, bound to London.  We had a very fair wind, and a quick passage.  I was very sick until we arrived in the Nore, and then I recovered, and, as you may suppose, was astonished at the busy scene, and the quantity of vessels which were going up and down the river.  But I did not like my captain; he was very severe and brutal to the men; and the apprentice who was on board told me to run away, and get into another vessel, and not to bind myself apprentice to this captain, or I should be beat all day long, and be treated as bad as he was.  I knew this was the case, as the captain kicked and cuffed him twenty times a day.  The men said that he did not do so to me, for fear I should refuse to be his apprentice; but that, as soon as my indentures were signed, he would treat me in the same way.",wish reply ready leave board collier bind have fair wind quick passage sick arrive recover suppose astonished busy scene quantity vessel go river like captain severe brutal man apprentice board tell run get vessel bind apprentice captain beat day treat bad know case captain kick cuff time day man say do fear refuse apprentice indenture sign treat same way 
38,"""Well, I made up my mind that I would not remain in the collier; and, as the captain had gone on shore, I had plenty of time to look about me. There was a large ship, which was ready to sail, lying in the stream; I spoke to two boys who were at the stairs in her boat, and they told me that they were very comfortable on board, and that the captain wanted two or three apprentices.  I went on board with them, and offered myself.  The captain asked me a great many questions, and I told him the truth, and why I did not like to remain in the collier.  He agreed to take me; and I went on shore with him, signed my indentures, and received from him a sufficient supply of clothes; and, two days afterwards, we sailed for Bombay and China.""",make mind remain collier captain go shore have plenty time look be large ship ready sail lie stream speak boy stair boat tell comfortable board captain want apprentice go board offer captain ask great many question tell truth like remain collier agree take go shore sign indenture receive sufficient supply clothes day sail 
39,"""But you wrote to your mother, Ready, did you not?"" said William.",write mother ready say 
40,"""Yes, I did; for the captain desired me to do so, and he put a few lines at the bottom to comfort her; but, unfortunately, the letter, which was sent on shore by the cook, never arrived.  Whether he dropped it, or forgot it till after the ship sailed, and then tore it up, I do not know; but, as I found out afterwards, it never did get to her hands.""",captain desire do put few line bottom comfort letter send shore cook arrive drop forget ship sail tore know find get hand

43,"""Don't dwell any more upon that portion of your history, Ready; but tell us what took place after you sailed for the East Indies.""",dwell more portion history ready tell take place sail 
44,"""Be it so, if you please.  I certainly was very smart and active for my age, and soon became a great favourite on board, especially with the lady passengers, because I was such a little fellow.  We arrived safely at Bombay, where our passengers went on shore, and in three weeks afterwards we sailed down the straits for China.  It was war time, and we were very often chased by French privateers; but as we had a good crew and plenty of guns, none of them ventured to attack us, and we got safe to Macao, where we unloaded our cargo and took in teas.  We had to wait some time for a convoy, and then sailed for England.  When we were off the Isle of France, the convoy was dispersed in a gale; and three days afterwards, a French frigate bore down upon us, and after exchanging a few broadsides, we were compelled to haul down our colours. A lieutenant was sent on board with forty men to take charge of us, for we were a very rich prize to them.  The captain and most of the crew were taken on board of the frigate, but ten Lascars and the boys were left in the Indiaman, to assist in taking her into the Isle of France, which was at that time in the hands of the French.  I thought it hard that I was to go to prison at twelve years old; but I did not care much about it, and very soon I was as gay and merry as ever.  We had made the island, and were on a wind beating up to the port, when a vessel was seen to windward, and although I could not understand what the Frenchmen said, I perceived that they were in a great fluster and very busy with their spy-glasses, and Jack Romer, one of my brother 'prentices who had been three years at sea, said to me, `I don't think we'll go to prison after all, Ready, for that vessel is an English man-of-war, if I'm not mistaken.'  At last she came down within three miles of us, and hoisted English colours and fired a gun.  The Frenchmen put the ship before the wind, but it was of no use; the man-of-war came up with us very fast, and then the Frenchmen began to pack up their clothes, together with all the other things which they had collected out of the property of our captain and crew; a shot was fired which went clean over our heads, and then they left the helm, and Jack Romer went to it, and, with my help, hove the ship up in the wind; a boat came on board and took possession, and so there was one escape, at all events.",smart active age become great favourite board lady passenger little fellow arrive passenger go shore week sail strait war time chase french privateer have good crew plenty gun venture attack get safe unload cargo take tea have wait time convoy sail convoy disperse gale day french frigate bear exchang few broadside compel haul colour lieutenant send board man take charge rich prize captain most crew take board frigate boy leave assist take time hand think go prison year old care much gay merry make island wind beating port vessel see windward understand say perceive great fluster busy spy glasses brother prentice year sea say think go prison ready vessel english man war mistaken last come mile hoist english colour fire gun put ship wind use man war come begin pack clothes other thing collect property captain crew shot fire go clean head leave helm go help hove ship wind boat come board take possession be escape event 
45,"""They sent a midshipman as prize-master on board of the vessel, and left all us, who had been taken prisoners by the French, in the vessel, to help to work her into port, as the captain did not wish to part with any more men of his own than was necessary.  We soon made sail for England, quite delighted at having escaped a French prison, but, after all, we only exchanged it for a Dutch one.""",send midshipman prize master board vessel leave take prisoner vessel help work port captain wish part more man own necessary make sail delighted escape french prison exchange dutch one 
46,"""How do you mean?""",mean 
47,"""I mean that, two days afterwards, as we were rounding the Cape, another French vessel bore down upon us, and captured us.  This time we did not find any friend in need, and were taken into Table Bay; for at that time the Cape of Good Hope was in the possession of the Dutch, who, as well as the French, were at war with England.""",mean day round french vessel bear capture time find friend need take time good possession war 
48,"""How very unfortunate you were, Ready!"" said Mrs Seagrave.",unfortunate ready say 
49,"""Yes, madam, we were, and I can't say much in favour of a Dutch prison. However, I was very young at that time, and did not care much--I had a light heart.""",madam say much favour dutch prison young time care much have light heart
