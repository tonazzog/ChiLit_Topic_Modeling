1,CHAPTER IX. JESSICA’S FIRST PRAYER ANSWERED.,first prayer answer 
2," Every Sunday evening the barefooted and bareheaded child might be seen advancing confidently up to the chapel where rich and fashionable people worshipped God; but before taking her place she arrayed herself in a little cloak and bonnet which had once belonged to the minister’s elder daughter, and which was kept with Daniel’s serge gown, so that she presented a somewhat more respectable appearance in the eyes of the congregation. The minister had no listener more attentive, and he would have missed the pinched, earnest little face if it were not to be seen in the seat just under the pulpit. At the close of each service he spoke to her for a minute or two in his vestry, often saying no more than a single sentence, for the day’s labor had wearied him. The shilling, which was always lying upon the chimney-piece, placed there by Jane and Winny in turns, was immediately handed over, according to promise, to Daniel as she left the chapel, and so Jessica’s breakfast was provided for her week after week.",evening barefooted bareheaded child see advance chapel rich fashionable person worship take place array little cloak bonnet belong minister elder daughter keep serge gown present respectable appearance eye congregation minister have listener attentive miss pinch earnest little face see seat pulpit close service speak minute vestry say more single sentence day labor weary shilling lie chimney piece place turn hand accord promise leave chapel breakfast provide week week 
3,"But at last there came a Sunday evening when the minister, going up into his pulpit, did miss the wistful, hungry face, and the shilling lay unclaimed upon the vestry chimney-piece. Daniel looked out for her anxiously every morning, but no Jessica glided into his secluded corner, to sit beside him with her breakfast on her lap and with a number of strange questions to ask. He felt her absence more keenly than he could have expected. The child was nothing to him, he kept saying to himself; and yet he felt that she was something, and that he could not help being uneasy and anxious about her. Why had he never inquired where she lived? The minister knew, and for a minute Daniel thought he would go and ask him; but that might awaken suspicion. How could he account for so much anxiety when he was supposed only to know of her absence from chapel one Sunday evening? It would be running a risk, and, after all, Jessica was nothing to him. So he went home and looked over his savings bank book and counted his money, and he found to his satisfaction that he had gathered together nearly four hundred pounds, and that he was adding more every week.",last come evening minister go pulpit miss wistful hungry face shilling lay unclaim vestry chimney piece look morning glide secluded corner sit breakfast lap number strange question ask feel absence expect child keep say feel help uneasy anxious inquire live minister know minute think go ask awake suspicion account much anxiety suppose know absence chapel evening run risk go look savings bank book count money find satisfaction gather pound add more week 
4,"But when upon the next Sunday Jessica’s seat was again empty the anxiety of the solemn chapel-keeper overcame his prudence and his fears. The minister had retired to his vestry, and was standing with his arm resting upon the chimney-piece, and his eyes fixed upon the unclaimed shilling which Winny had laid there before the service, when there was a tap at the door, and Daniel entered with a respectful but hesitating air.",next seat empty anxiety solemn chapel keeper overcame prudence fear minister retire vestry stand arm rest chimney piece eye fix unclaimed shilling lay service be tap door enter respectful hesitate air 
5,"“Well, Standring?” said the minister questioningly.",stand say minister 
6,"“Sir,” he said, “I’m uncomfortable about that little girl, and I know you’ve been once to see after her; she told me about it; and so I make bold to ask you where she lives, and I’ll see what’s become of her.”",say uncomfortable little girl know see tell make bold ask live see become 
7,"“Right, Standring,” answered the minister; “I am troubled about the child, and so are my little girls. I thought of going myself, but my time is very much occupied just now.”",right answer minister troubled child little girl think go time occupy 
8,"“I’ll go, sir,” replied Daniel promptly; and after receiving the necessary information about Jessica’s home he put out the lights, locked the door, and turned towards his lonely lodgings.",go reply receive necessary information home put light lock door turn lonely lodging 
9,"But though it was getting late upon Sunday evening, and Jessica’s home was a long way distant, Daniel found that his anxiety would not suffer him to return to his solitary room. It was of no use to reason with himself, as he stood at the corner of the street, feeling perplexed and troubled, and promising his conscience that he would go the very first thing in the morning after he shut up his coffee-stall. In the dim, dusky light, as the summer evening drew to a close, he fancied he could see Jessica’s thin figure and wan face gliding on before him, and turning around from time to time to see if he were following. It was only fancy, and he laughed a little at himself; but the laugh was husky, and there was a choking sensation in his throat, so he buttoned his Sunday coat over his breast, where his silver watch and chain hung temptingly, and started off at a rapid pace for the centre of the city.",get evening home long way distant find anxiety suffer return solitary room use reason stand corner street feel perplex trouble promise conscience go very first thing morning shut coffee stall dim dusky light summer evening draw close fancy see thin figure want face glide turn time time see follow fancy laugh little laugh husky be choke sensation throat button coat breast silver watch chain hang start rapid pace centre city 
10,"It was not quite dark when he reached the court, and stumbled up the narrow entry leading to it; but Daniel did hesitate when he opened the stable-door, and looked into a blank, black space, in which he could discern nothing. He thought he had better retreat while he could do so safely; but as he still stood with his hand upon the rusty latch he heard a faint, small voice through the nicks of the unceiled boarding above his head.",dark reach court stumble narrow entry lead hesitate open stable door look blank black space discern think have good retreat do stand hand rusty latch hear faint small voice nick unceil boarding head 
11,"“Our Father,” said the little voice, “please to send somebody to me, for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.”",father say little voice send sake 
12,"“I’m here, Jess,” cried Daniel, with a sudden bound of his heart, such as he had not felt for years, and which almost took away his breath as he peered into the darkness until at last he discerned dimly the ladder which led up into the loft.",cry sudden bind heart such feel year take breath peer darkness last discern ladder lead loft 
13," Very cautiously, but with an eagerness which surprised himself, he climbed up the creaking rounds of the ladder and entered the dismal room, where the child was lying in desolate darkness. Fortunately he had his box of matches in his pocket, and the end of a wax candle with which he kindled the lamps, and in another minute a gleam of light shone upon Jessica’s white features. She was stretched upon a scanty litter of straw under the slanting roof where the tiles had not fallen off, with her poor rags for her only covering; but as her eyes looked up into Daniel’s face bending over her a bright smile of joy sparkled in them.",eagerness surprise climb creaking round ladder enter dismal room child lie desolate darkness have box match pocket end wax candle kindle lamp minute gleam light shine white feature stretch scanty litter straw slant roof tile fall poor rag cover eye look face bending bright smile joy sparkle 
14,"“Oh!” she cried, gladly, but in a feeble voice, “it’s Mr. Daniel! Has God told you to come here, Mr. Daniel?”",cry feeble voice tell come 
15,"“Yes,” said Daniel, kneeling beside her, taking her wasted hand in his, and parting the matted hair upon her damp forehead.",say kneel take waste hand part matt hair damp forehead 
16,“What did he say to you?” said Jessica.,say say 
17,"“He told me I was a great sinner,” replied Daniel. “He told me I loved a little bit of dirty money better than a poor, friendless, helpless child, whom he had sent to me to see if I would do her a little good for his sake. He looked at me, or the minister did, through and through, and he said, ‘Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?’ And I could answer him nothing, Jess. He had come to a reckoning with me, and I could not say a word to him.”",tell great sinner reply tell love little bit dirty money good poor friendless helpless child send see do little good sake look minister do say fool night soul require thing provide answer come reckoning say word 
18,"“Aren’t you a good man, Mr. Daniel?” whispered Jessica.",good man whisper 
19,"“No; I’m a wicked sinner,” he cried, while the tears rolled down his solemn face. “I’ve been constant at God’s house, but only to get money; I’ve been steady and industrious, but only to get money; and now God looks at me, and he says, ‘Thou fool!’ Oh, Jess, Jess, you’re more fit for heaven than I ever was in my life!”",wicked sinner cry tear roll solemn face constant house get money steady industrious get money look say fool fit heaven life 
20,“Why don’t you ask him to make you good for Jesus Christ’s sake?” asked the child.,ask make good sake ask child 
21,"“I can’t,” he said. “I’ve been kneeling down Sunday after Sunday when the minister’s been praying, but all the time I was thinking how rich some of the carriage people were. I’ve been loving money and worshipping money all along, and I’ve nearly let you die rather than run the risk of losing part of my earnings. I’m a very sinful man.”",say kneel minister pray time think rich carriage person love money worshipp money let die run risk lose part earnings sinful man 
22,"“But you know what the minister often says,” murmured Jessica:",know minister say murmure 
23,"“‘Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.’”",love love love send son propitiation sin 
24,"“I’ve heard it so often that I don’t feel it,” said Daniel. “I used to like to hear the minister say it, but now it goes in at one ear and out at the other. My heart is very hard, Jessica.”",hear feel say use like hear minister say go ear other heart hard 
25,"By the feeble glimmer of the candle Daniel saw Jessica’s wistful eyes fixed upon him with a sad and loving glance; and then she lifted up her weak hand to her face, and laid it over her closed eyelids, and her feverish lips moved slowly.",feeble glimmer candle see wistful eye fix sad loving glance lift weak hand face lay close eyelid feverish lip move 
26,"“God,” she said, “please to make Mr. Daniel’s heart soft, for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.”",say make heart soft sake 
27,"She did not speak again, nor Daniel, for some time.",speak time 
28,"He took off his Sunday coat and laid it over the tiny, shivering frame, which was shaking with cold even in the summer evening; and as he did so he remembered the words which the Lord says he will pronounce at the last day of reckoning:",take coat lay tiny shiver frame shake cold summer evening remember word say pronounce last day reckoning
