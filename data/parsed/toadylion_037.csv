1,CHAPTER XXXVII. THE GOOD CONDUCT PRIZE.,good 
2," It was three years after. Sometimes three years makes a considerable change in grown-ups. More often it leaves them pretty much where they were. But with boys and girls the world begins all over again every two years at most. So the terms went and came, and at each vacation, instead of returning home, Hugh John went to London. For it so happened that the year he had left for school the house of Windy Standard was burned down almost to the ground, and Mr. Picton Smith took advantage of the fact to build an entirely new mansion on a somewhat higher site.",year year make considerable change grow up leave boy girl world begin year most term go come vacation return go happen year leave school house windy burn ground take advantage fact build new mansion high site 
3,"The first house might have been saved had the Bounding Brothers been in the neighbourhood, or indeed any active and efficient helpers. But the nearest engine was under the care of the Edam fire brigade, who upon hearing of the conflagration, with great enthusiasm ran their engine a quarter of a mile out of the town by hand. Then their ardour suddenly giving out, they sat down and had an amicable smoke on the roadside till the horse was brought to drag the apparatus the rest of the distance.",first house save neighbourhood active efficient helper near engine care fire brigade hear conflagration great enthusiasm run engine quarter mile town hand ardour give sit have amicable smoke roadside horse bring drag apparatus rest distance 
4,"But alas! the animal was too fat to be got between the shafts, so it had to be sent back and a leaner horse forwarded. Meantime the house of Windy Standard was blazing merrily, and when the Edam fire company finally arrived, the ashes were still quite hot.",animal fat get shaft have send leaner horse forward house windy blaze fire company arrive ash hot

6,"So in this way it came about that it was three long years before Hugh John again saw the hoary battlements of the ancient strength on the castle island which he and his army had attacked so boldly. There were great changes in the town itself. The railway had come to Edam, and now steamed and snorted under the very walls of the Abbey. Chimneys had multiplied, and the smoke columns were taller and denser. The rubicund Provost had gone the way of all the earth, even of all provosts! And the leading bailie, one Donnan, a butcher and army contractor, sat with something less of dignity but equal efficiency in his magisterial chair.",way come long year see hoary battlement ancient strength castle island army attack be great change town railway come steam snort very wall chimney multiply smoke column tall denser go way earth provost lead bailie butcher army contractor sit less dignity equal efficiency magisterial chair 
7,"Hugh John from the station platform saw something of this with a sick heart, but he was sure that out in the pure air and infinite quiet of Windy Standard he would find all things the same. But a new and finer house shone white upon the hill. Gardens flourished on unexpected places with that appearance of having been recently planted, frequently pulled up by the roots, looked at and put back, which distinguishes all new gardens. Here and there white-painted vineries and conservatories winked ostentatiously in the sun.",station platform see sick heart sure pure air infinite quiet windy find thing same new finer house shine white hill garden flourish unexpected place appearance plant pull root look put distinguish new garden white paint vinery conservatory wink sun 
8,"What a time Hugh John had been planning they would have! For months he had thought of nothing but this. Toady Lion and he would do all over again those famous deeds of daring he had done at the castle. Again they would attack the island. Other secret passages would be discovered. All would be as it had been--only nicer. And Cissy Carter--more than everything else he had looked forward to meeting Cissy. Prissy had seen her often, and even during the last week she had written to Hugh John (Prissy always did like to write letters) that Cissy Carter was just splendid--so much older and _so_ improved. Cissy was now nearly seventeen, being (as before) a year and three months older than Hugh John.",time plan have month think do famous deed dare do castle attack island other secret passage discover nice more else look meet prissy see last week write like write letter splendid old improve year month old 
9,"Now the distinguished military hero had not been much troubled with sentiment during his school terms. Soldiers at the front never are. He was fully occupied in doing his lessons fairly. He got on well with ""the fellows."" He was anxious to keep up his end in the games. But, for all that, during these years he had sacredly kept the half of the crooked sixpence in his box, hidden in the end of a tie which he never wore. Now, however, he had looked it out, and by dint of hammering his imagination, he had managed to squeeze out an amount of feeling which quite astonished himself.",distinguished military hero trouble sentiment school term soldier front occupy do lesson get fellow anxious keep end game year keep half crooked sixpence box hide end tie wear look dint hammer imagination manage squeeze amount feeling astonished 
10,"He would be noble, generous, forbearing. He remembered how faithfully Cissy had loved him, and how unresponsive he had been in the past. He resolved that all would be very different now.",noble generous forbear remember love unresponsive past resolve different

12,"Then again he had brought back a record of some distinction from St. Salvator's. He had won the school golf championship. He possessed also a fine bat with an inscription on silver, telling how in the match with St. Aiden's, a rival college of much pretension, he had made 100 not out, and taken eight wickets for sixty-nine.",bring record distinction win school golf championship possess fine bat inscription silver tell match rival college much pretension make take wicket 
13,"Besides this presentation cricket bat Hugh John had brought home only one other prize. This was a fitted dressing-bag of beautiful design, with a whole armoury of wonderful silver-plated things inside. It was known as the Good Conduct Prize, and was awarded every year, not by the masters, but by the free votes of all the boys. Prissy was enormously proud of this tribute paid to her brother by his companions. The donor was an old gentleman whose favourite hobby was the promotion of the finer manners of the ancient days, and the terms of the remit on which the award must be made were, that it should be given to the boy who, in the opinion of his fellow-students, was most distinguished for consistent good manners and polite breeding, shown both by his conduct to his superiors in school, and in association with his equals in the playing fields.",presentation cricket bat bring other prize fit dress bag beautiful design whole armoury wonderful silver plate thing know good award year master free vote boy prissy proud tribute pay brother companion donor old gentleman favourite hobby promotion finer manners ancient day term remit award make give boy opinion fellow student distinguish consistent good manners polite breeding show conduct superior school association equal playing field 
14,"At first Hugh John had taken no interest whatever in this award, perhaps from a feeling that his own claims were somewhat slender--or thinking that the prize would merely be some ""old book or other."" But it happened that, in order to stimulate the school during the last lax and sluggish days of the summer term, the head-master took out the fittings of the dressing-bag, and set the stand containing them on his desk in view of all.",first take interest award feeling own claim slender think prize old book other happen order stimulate school last lax sluggish day summer term head master take fitting dress bag set stand contain desk view 
15,There was a set of razors among them.,be set razor 
16,Instantly Hugh John's heart yearned with a mighty desire to obtain that prize. How splendid it would be if he could appear at home before Toady Lion and Cissy Carter with a moustache!,heart yearn mighty desire obtain prize splendid appear home moustache 
17,That night he considered the matter from all points of view--and felt his muscles. In the morning he was down bright and early. He prowled about the purlieus of the playground. At the back of the gymnasium he met Ashwell Major.,night consider matter point view feel muscle morning bright prowl purlieus playground back gymnasium meet

21,"""Well,"" said the other, ""let's give it to little Brown. Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. He's such a cake.""",say other let give little butter melt mouth cake 
22,Hugh John felt that the time for moral suasion had come.,feel time moral suasion come 
23,"""Smell that!"" he said, suddenly extending the clenched fist with which a week before he had made ""bran mash"" of the bully of the school.",smell say extend clench fist week make bran mash bully school

25,"Reluctantly Ashwell Major's nostrils inhaled the bouquet of Hugh John's knuckles. Ashwell Major seemed to have a dainty and discriminating taste in perfumes, for he did not appear to relish this one.",nostril inhal bouquet knuckle seem have dainty discriminate taste perfume appear relish one 
26,Then Ashwell Major said that now he was going to vote solidly for Hugh John Smith. He had come to the conclusion that his manners were quite exceptional.,say go vote come conclusion manners exceptional 
27,"And so as the day went on, did the candidate for the fitted dressing-bag argue with the other boarders, waylaying them one by one as they came out into the playground. The day-boys followed, and each enjoyed the privilege of a smell at the fist of power.",day go candidate fit dress bag argue other border waylay come playground day boy follow enjoy privilege smell fist power

29,"""I rejoice to announce that the Good Conduct Prize has been awarded by the unanimous vote of all the scholars of Saint Salvator's to Hugh John Picton Smith of the fifth form. I am the more pleased with this result, that I have never before known such complete and remarkable unanimity of choice in the long and distinguished history of this institution.""",rejoice announce good award unanimous vote scholar fifth form pleased result know such complete remarkable unanimity choice long distinguished history institution 
30,"These were the memorable words of the headmaster on the great day of the prize-giving. Whereupon our hero, going up to receive his well-earned distinction, blushed modestly and becomingly; and was gazed upon with wrapt wonder by the matrons and maids assembled, as beyond controversy the model boy of the school. And such a burst of cheering followed him to his seat as had never been heard within the walls of St. Salvator's. For quite casually Hugh John had mentioned that he would be on the look-out for any fellow that was a sneak and didn't cheer like blazes.",memorable word headmaster great day prize give hero go receive earn distinction blush gaze wrapt wonder matron maid assemble controversy model boy school burst cheering follow seat hear wall mention look fellow sneak cheer blaze
