2," THE same moment her nurse came into the room, sobbing. When she saw her sitting there, she started back with a loud cry of amazement and joy.

4,"""Not quite from the top,"" thought Irene to herself; and she might have added--""not quite to the bottom,"" perhaps, if she had known all. But the one she would not, and the other she could not say.",top think add bottom know one other say 
5,"""Oh, Lootie! I've had such a dreadful adventure!"" she replied, and told her all about the cat with the long legs, and how she ran out upon the mountain, and came back again. But she said nothing of her grandmother or her lamp.",have dreadful adventure reply tell cat long leg run mountain come say grandmother lamp 
6,"""And there we've been searching for you all over the house for more than an hour and a half!"" exclaimed the nurse. ""But that's no matter, now we've got you! Only, princess, I must say,"" she added, her mood changing, ""what you ought to have done was to call for your own Lootie to come and help you, instead of running out of the house, and up the mountain, in that wild--I must say, foolish fashion.""",search house more hour half exclaim nurse matter get princess say add mood change do call own lootie come help run house mountain wild say foolish fashion 
7,"""Well, Lootie,"" said Irene quietly, ""perhaps if you had a big cat, all legs, running at you, you mightn't exactly know which was the wisest thing to do at the moment.""",say have big cat leg run know wisest thing do moment

10,"This put a stop to Lootie's reproaches. She had been on the point of saying that the long-legged cat must have been a twilight fancy of the princess's, but the memory of the horrors of that night, and of the talking-to which the king had given her in consequence, prevented her from saying that which after all she did not half believe--having a strong suspicion that the cat was a goblin; for the fact was that she knew nothing of the difference between the goblins and their creatures: she counted them all just goblins.",put stop reproache point say long legged cat twilight fancy princess memory horror night talking king give consequence prevent say believe have strong suspicion cat goblin fact know difference goblin creature count goblin 
11,"Without another word she went and got some fresh tea and bread and butter for the princess. Before she returned, the whole household, headed by the housekeeper, burst into the nursery to exult over their darling. The gentlemen-at-arms followed, and were ready enough to believe all she told them about the long-legged cat. Indeed, though wise enough to say nothing about it, they remembered with no little horror, just such a creature amongst those they had surprised at their gambols upon the princess's lawn. In their own hearts they blamed themselves for not having kept better watch. And their captain gave order that from this night the front door and all the windows on the ground floor should be locked immediately the sun set, and opened after upon no pretence whatever. The men-at-arms redoubled their vigilance, and for some time there was no further cause of alarm.",word go get fresh tea bread butter princess return whole household head housekeeper burst nursery exult darling gentleman arm follow ready believe tell long legged cat wise say remember little horror creature surprise gambol princess lawn own heart blame keep good watch captain give order night front door window ground floor lock sun set open pretence man arm redoubl vigilance time be further cause alarm
