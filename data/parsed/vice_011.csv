4," Sunday came--a day which was to begin a new week for Mr. Bultitude, and, of course, for the rest of the Christian world as well. Whether that week would be better or worse than the one which had just passed away he naturally could not tell--it could hardly be much worse.",come day begin new week course rest christian world week good bad one pass tell bad 
5,"But the Sunday itself, he anticipated, without, however, any very firm grounds for such an assumption, would be a day of brief but grateful respite; a day on which he might venture to claim much the same immunity as was enjoyed in former days by the insolvent; a day, in short, which would glide slowly by with the rather drowsy solemnity peculiar to the British sabbath as observed by all truly respectable persons.",anticipate firm grounds assumption day brief grateful respite day venture claim same immunity enjoy former day insolvent day short glide drowsy solemnity peculiar british sabbath observe respectable person 
6,"And yet that very Sunday, could he have foreseen it, was destined to be the most eventful day he had yet spent at Crichton House, where none had proved wanting in incident. During the next twelve hours he was to pass through every variety of unpleasant sensation. Embarrassment, suspense, fear, anxiety, dismay, and terror were to follow each other in rapid succession, and to wind up, strangely enough, with a delicious ecstasy of pure relief and happiness--a fatiguing programme for any middle-aged gentleman who had never cultivated his emotional faculties.",forese destine eventful day spend prove want incident next hour pass variety unpleasant sensation embarrassment suspense fear anxiety dismay terror follow other rapid succession wind delicious ecstasy pure relief happiness fatiguing programme middle aged gentleman cultivate emotional faculty 
7,"Let me try to tell how this came about. The getting-up bell rang an hour later than on week-days, but the boys were expected to prepare certain tasks suitable for the day before they rose. Mr. Bultitude found that he was required to learn by heart a hymn in which the rhymes ""join"" and ""divine,"" ""throne"" and ""crown,"" were so happily wedded that either might conform to the other--a graceful concession to individual taste which is not infrequent in this class of poetry. Trivial as such a task may seem in these days of School Boards, it gave him infinite trouble and mental exertion, for he had not been called upon to commit anything of the kind to memory for many years, and after mastering that, there still remained a long chronological list (the dates approximately computed) of the leading events before and immediately after the Deluge, which was to be repeated ""without looking at the book.""",let try tell come getting bell ring hour week day boy expect prepare certain task suitable day rise find require learn heart hymn rhyme join divine throne crown wedd conform other graceful concession individual taste infrequent class poetry trivial task seem day give infinite trouble mental exertion call commit kind memory many year master remain long chronological list date compute lead event repeat look book 
8,"While he was wrestling desperately with these, for he was determined, as I have said before, to do all in his power to keep himself out of trouble, Mrs. Grimstone, in her morning wrapper, paid a visit to the dormitories and, in spite of all Paul's attempts to excuse himself, insisted upon pomatuming his hair--an indignity which he felt acutely.",wrestle determine say do power keep trouble morning wrapper pay visit dormitory spite attempt excuse insist pomatume hair indignity feel

10,"Then there was breakfast, at which Dr. Grimstone appeared, resplendent in glossy broadcloth, and dazzling shirt-front and semi-clerical white tie, and after breakfast, an hour in the schoolroom, during which the boys (by the aid of repeated references to the text) wrote out ""from memory"" the hymn they had learnt, while Paul managed somehow to stumble through his dates and events to the satisfaction of Mr. Tinkler, who, to increase his popularity, made a point of being as easily satisfied with such repetitions as he decently could.",be breakfast appear resplendent glossy broadcloth dazzle shirt front semi-clerical white tie breakfast hour schoolroom boy aid repeat reference text write memory hymn learn manage stumble date event satisfaction increase popularity make point satisfied such repetition 
11,"After that came the order to prepare for church. There was a general rush to the little room with the shelves and bandboxes, where church books were procured, and great-coats and tight kid gloves put on.",come order prepare church be general rush little room shelf bandboxe church book procure great coat tight kid glove put

14,"And this he proceeded to do from a store he had with him of that most convenient coin--the chosen expression of a congregation's gratitude--the common silver threepence, for the school occupied a prominent position in the church, and had acquired a great reputation amongst the churchwardens for the admirable uniformity with which one young gentleman after another ""put into the plate""; and this reputation the Doctor was naturally anxious that they should maintain.",proceed do store have convenient coin choose expression congregation gratitude common silver threepence school occupy prominent position church acquire great reputation churchwarden admirable uniformity young gentleman put plate reputation anxious maintain 
15,"I am sorry to say that Mr. Bultitude, fearing lest he should be asked if he had the required sum about him, and thus his penniless condition might be discovered and bring him trouble, got behind the door at the beginning of the money-changing transactions and remained there till it was over--it seemed to him that it would be too paltry to be disgraced for want of threepence.",sorry say fear ask have require sum penniless condition discover bring trouble get door beginning money change transaction remain seem paltry disgrace want threepence

17,"Mr. Bultitude walked nearly last with Jolland, whose facile nature had almost forgotten his friend's shortcomings on the previous day. He kept up a perpetual flow of chatter which, as he never stopped for an answer, permitted Paul to indulge his own thoughts unrestrained.",walk last facile nature forget friend shortcoming previous day keep perpetual flow chatter stop answer permit indulge own thought unrestrained 
18,"""Are you going to put your threepenny-bit in?"" said Jolland; ""I won't if you don't. Sometimes, you know, when the plate comes round, old Grim squints down the pews to see we don't shirk. Then I put in sixpence. Have you done your hymn? I do hate a hymn. What's the use of learning hymns? They won't mark you for them, you know, in any exam. I ever heard of, and it can't save you the expense of a hymnbook unless you learnt all the hymns in it, and that would take you years. Oh, I say, look! there's young Mutlow and his governor and mater. I wonder what Mutlow's governor does? Mutlow says he's a 'gentleman' if you ask him, but I believe he lies.

21,"And so the pair walked on in silence; Jolland with his nose in the air, determined that after this he really must cut his former friend as the other fellows had done, since his devotion was appreciated so little, and Paul watching the ascending double line of tall chimney-pot hats as they surged before him in regular movement, and feeling a dull wonder at finding himself setting out to church in such ill-assorted company.",pair walk silence nose air determine cut former friend other fellow do devotion appreciate little watch ascend double line tall chimney pot hat surge regular movement feel dull wonder find set church such ill assort company 
22,"They entered the church, and Paul was sent down to the extreme end of a pew next to the one reserved for the Doctor and his family. Dulcie was sitting there already on the other side of the partition; but she gave no sign of having noticed his arrival, being apparently absorbed in studying the rose-window over the altar.",enter church send extreme end pew one reserve family sit other side partition give sign notice arrival absorb study rose window altar 
23,"He sat down in his corner with a sense of rest and almost comfort, though the seat was not a cushioned one. He had the inoffensive Kiffin for a neighbour, his chief tormentors were far away from him in one of the back pews, and here at least he thought no harm could come to him. He could allow himself safely to do what I am afraid he generally did do under the circumstances--snatch a few intermittent but sweet periods of dreamless slumber.",sit corner sense rest comfort seat cushion one have inoffensive neighbour chief tormentor back pew least think harm come allow do afraid do circumstance snatch few intermittent sweet period dreamless slumber 
24,"But, while the service was proceeding, Mr. Bultitude was suddenly horrified to observe that a young lady, who occupied a pew at right angles to and touching that in which he sat, was deliberately making furtive signals to him in a most unmistakable manner.",service proceed horrify observe young lady occupy pew right angle touch sit make furtive signal unmistakable manner 
25,"She was a decidedly pretty girl of about fifteen, with merry and daring blue eyes and curling golden hair, and was accompanied by two small brothers (who shared the same book and dealt each other stealthy and vicious kicks throughout the service), and by her father, a stout, short-sighted old gentleman in gold spectacles, who was perpetually making the wrong responses in a loud and confident tone.",pretty girl merry dare blue eye curl golden hair accompany small brother share same book deal other stealthy vicious kick service father stout short sight old gentleman gold spectacle make wrong response loud confident tone 
26,"To be signalled to in a marked manner by a strange young lady of great personal attractions might be a coveted distinction to other schoolboys, but it simply gave Mr. Bultitude cold thrills.",signall mark manner strange young lady great personal attraction covete distinction other schoolboy give cold thrill 
27,"""I suppose _that's_ 'Connie Davenant,'"" he thought, shocked beyond measure as she caught his eye and coughed demurely for about the fourth time. ""A very forward young person! I think somebody ought to speak seriously to her father.""",suppose think shocked measure catch eye cough fourth time forward young person think speak father 
28,"""Good gracious! she's writing something on the flyleaf of her prayer-book,"" he said to himself presently. ""I hope she's not going to send it to _me_. I won't take it. She ought to be ashamed of herself!""",good gracious write flyleaf prayer book say hope go send take ashamed 
29,"Miss Davenant was indeed busily engaged in pencilling something on a blank sheet of paper; and, having finished, she folded it deftly into a cocked-hat, wrote a few words on the outside, and placed it between the leaves of her book.",engage pencill blank sheet paper finish fold cocked hat write few word place leave book 
30,"Then, as the congregation rose for the Psalms, she gave a meaning glance at the blushing and scandalised Mr. Bultitude and by dexterous management of her prayer-book shot the little cocked-hat, as if unconsciously, into the next pew.",congregation rise give meaning glance blushing scandalise dexterous management prayer book shot little cocked hat next pew 
31,"By a very unfortunate miscalculation, however, the note missed its proper object, and, clearing the partition, fluttered deliberately down on the floor by Dulcie's feet.",unfortunate miscalculation note miss proper object clear partition flutter floor foot 
32,Paul saw this with alarm; he knew that at all hazards he must get that miserable note into his own possession and destroy it. It might have his name somewhere about it; it might seriously compromise him.,see alarm know hazard get miserable note own possession destroy have name compromise 
33,"So he took advantage of the noise the congregation made in repeating a verse aloud (it was not a high church) to whisper to Dulcie: ""Little Miss Grimstone, excuse me, but there's a--a note in the pew down by your feet. I believe it's intended for me.""",take advantage noise congregation make repeat verse high church whisper little excuse be note pew foot believe intend 
34,"Dulcie had seen the whole affair and had been not a little puzzled by it, a clandestine correspondence being a new thing in her short experience; but she understood that in this golden-haired girl, her elder by several years, she saw her rival, for whom Dick had so basely abandoned her yesterday, and she was old enough to feel the slight and the sweetness of revenge.",see whole affair little puzzle clandestine correspondence new thing short experience understand golden haired girl elder several year see rival abandon yesterday old feel slight sweetness revenge 
35,"So she held her head rather higher than usual, with her firm little chin projecting wilfully, and waited for the next verse but one before retorting, ""Little Master Bultitude, I know it is.""",hold head high usual firm little chin project wait next verse retort little know

40,"The other girl, she noticed with satisfaction, had become aware of the situation and was evidently uneasy. She looked as imploringly as she dared at remorseless little Dulcie, as if appealing to her not to get her into trouble; but Dulcie bent her eyes obstinately on her book and would not see her.",other girl notice satisfaction become aware situation uneasy look dare remorseless little appeal get trouble bend eye book see 
41,"If the letter had been addressed to any other boy in the school, she would have done her best to shield the culprits; but this she could not bring herself to do here. She found a malicious pleasure in remaining absolutely neutral, which of course was very wrong and ill-natured of her.",letter address other boy school do good shield culprit bring do find malicious pleasure remain neutral course wrong ill natured 
42,"Mr. Bultitude began now to be seriously alarmed. The fatal paper must be seen by some one in the Doctor's pew as soon as the congregation sat down again; and, if it reached the Doctor's hands, it was impossible to say what misconstruction he might put upon it or what terrible consequences might not follow.",begin alarm fatal paper see pew congregation sit reach hand impossible say misconstruction put terrible consequence follow 
43,"He was innocent, perfectly innocent; but though the consciousness of innocence is frequently a great consolation, he felt that unless he could imbue the Doctor with it as well, it would not save him from a flogging.",innocent innocent consciousness innocence great consolation feel imbue doctor save flog 
44,"So he made one more desperate attempt to soften Dulcie's resolution: ""Don't be a naughty little girl,"" he said, very injudiciously for his purpose, ""I tell you I must have it. You'll get me into a terrible mess if you're not careful!""",make desperate attempt soften resolution naughty little girl say purpose tell have get terrible mess careful 
45,"But although Dulcie had been extremely well brought up, I regret to say that the only answer she chose to make to this appeal was that slight contortion of the features, which with a pretty girl is euphemised as a ""_moue_,"" and with a plain one is called ""making a face."" When he saw it he knew that all hope of changing her purpose must be abandoned.",bring regret say only answer choose make appeal slight contortion feature pretty girl euphemise _moue_ plain one call make face see know hope change purpose abandon

48,"It fell at last. Dulcie, either with the malevolent idea of hastening the crisis, or (which I prefer to believe for my own part) finding that her ex-lover's visible torments were too much for her desire of vengeance, was softly moving a heavy hassock towards the guilty note. The movement caught her mother's eye, and in an instant the compromising paper was in her watchful hands.",fall last malevolent idea hasten crisis prefer believe own part find ex-lover visible torment much desire vengeance move heavy hassock guilty note movement catch mother eye instant compromise paper watchful hand 
49,"She read it with incredulous horror, and handed it at once to the Doctor.",read incredulous horror hand 
50,"The golden-haired one saw it all without betraying herself by any outward confusion. She had probably had some experience in such matters, and felt tolerably certain of being able, at the worst, to manage the old gentleman in the gold spectacles. But she took an early opportunity of secretly conveying her contempt for the traitress Dulcie, who continued to meet her angry glances with the blandest unconsciousness.",golden hair one see betray outward confusion have experience such matter feel certain able bad manage old gentleman gold spectacle take early opportunity convey contempt traitress continue meet angry glance blandest unconsciousness 
51,"Dr. Grimstone examined the cocked-hat through his double eyeglasses, with a heavy thunder-cloud gathering on his brows. When he had mastered it thoroughly, he bent forward and glared indignantly past his wife and daughter for at least half a minute into the pew where Mr. Bultitude was cowering, until he felt that he was coming all to pieces under the piercing gaze.",examine cocked hat double eyeglass heavy thunder cloud gather brow master bend glare wife daughter least minute pew cower feel come piece pierce gaze 
52,The service passed all too quickly after that. Paul sat down and stood up almost unconsciously with the rest; but for the first time in his life he could have wished the sermon many times longer.,service pass sit stand rest first time life wish sermon many time 
53,"The horror of his position quite petrified him. After all his prudent resolutions to keep out of mischief and to win the regard and confidence of his gaoler by his good conduct, like the innocent convict in a melodrama, this came as nothing less than a catastrophe. He walked home in a truly dismal state of limp terror.",horror position petrify prudent resolution keep mischief win regard confidence gaoler good conduct innocent convict melodrama come less catastrophe walk dismal state limp terror 
54,"Fortunately for him none of the others seemed to have noticed his misfortune, and Jolland made no further advances. But even the weather tended to increase his depression, for it was a bleak, cheerless day, with a bitter and searching wind sweeping the gritty roads where yesterday's rain was turned to black ice in the ruts, and the sun shone with a dull coppery glitter that had no warmth or geniality about it.",other seem notice misfortune make further advance weather tend increase depression bleak cheerless day bitter search wind sweep gritty road yesterday rain turn black ice rut sun shine dull coppery glitter have warmth geniality 
55,"The nearer they came to Crichton House the more abjectly miserable became Mr. Bultitude's state of mind. It was as much as he could do to crawl up the steps to the front door, and his knees positively clapped together when the Doctor, who had driven home, met them in the hall and said in a still grave voice, ""Bultitude, when you have taken off your coat, I want you in the study.""",nearer come miserable become state mind much do crawl step front door knee clapp drive meet hall say grave voice take coat want study

He remembered the room well, with its ebony-framed etchings on the walls, bookcases and blue china over the draped mantelpiece, even to a large case of elaborately carved Indian chessmen in bullock-carts and palanquins, on horses and elephants, which stood in the window-recess. It was the very room to which he had been shown when he first called about sending his son to the school. He had little thought then that the time would come when he would attend there for the purpose of being flogged; few things would have seemed less probable. Yet here he was.",long take coat dare last go tremble study find empty remember room ebony frame etching wall bookcase blue china drape mantelpiece large case carve indian chessmen bullock cart palanquin horse elephant stand window recess very room show call send son school have little thought time come attend purpose flogge few thing seem probable 
57,"But his train of thought was abruptly broken by the entrance of the Doctor. He marched solemnly in, holding out the offending missive.
