7,"""I only hope it is not the Queen,"" exclaimed Richard, in dismay.

But come down, Alberic; I will say nothing unkind of Lothaire, if I can help it.""",hope exclaim dismay coward doubt afraid ride trust darling shut demoiselle come say unkind help

9,"With black looks, Lothaire stepped from the litter, took no heed of the little Duke, but, roughly calling his attendant, Charlot, to follow him, he marched into the hall, vouchsafing neither word nor look to any as he passed, threw himself into the highest seat, and ordered Charlot to bring him some wine.",black look step litter take heed little call attendant follow march hall vouchsafe word look pass throw high seat order bring wine

17,"Fru Astrida advanced to take his hand, speaking in a soothing voice, but he shrank and started with a fresh cry of terror--her tall figure, high cap, and wrinkled face, were to him witch-like, and as she knew no French, he understood not her kind words.  However, he let Richard lead him into the hall, where Lothaire sat moodily in the chair, with one leg tucked under him, and his finger in his mouth.",advance take hand speak soothing voice shrank start fresh cry terror tall figure high cap wrinkle face witch know understand kind word let lead hall sit chair leg tuck finger mouth

29,"""He is too brave not to be gentle,"" said Osmond; and, indeed, the high-spirited, impetuous boy was as soft and kind as a maiden, with that feeble, timid child.  He coaxed him to eat, consoled him, and, instead of laughing at his fears, kept between him and the great bloodhound Hardigras, and drove it off when it came too near.",brave gentle say high spirit impetuous boy soft kind maiden feeble timid child coax eat console laugh fear keep great bloodhound drive come

38,"Either Lothaire did not hear, or did not believe, and fought more furiously in Osmond's arms, but he had little chance with the stalwart young warrior, and, in spite of Richard's remonstrances, he was carried from the hall, roaring and kicking, and locked up alone in an empty room.",hear believe fight arm have little chance stalwart young warrior spite remonstrance carry hall roar kick lock empty room

And were you really there, Richard?""",do repeat angry mother cross stop meet bundle straw give blow knock 
45,"Richard told his story, and was glad to find Carloman could smile at it; and then Fru Astrida advised him to take his little friend to bed.

63,"And he swung back the heavy door with a resounding clang.  But his heart smote him when he told his beads, and remembered what he had said to Carloman.

To be sure, Sir Eric said it would do him good, but Sir Eric little knew how tender the French Princes were.",swing heavy door resounding clang heart smeat tell bead remember say know sleep warm bed cold gusty room sure say do good know tender french

67,"Lothaire was subdued by fright, cold, and darkness, and quietly allowed Richard to lead him down.  Round the fire, at the lower end of the hall, snored half-a-dozen men-at-arms; at the upper hearth there was only Hardigras, who raised his head as the boys came in.  Richard's whisper and soft pat quieted him instantly, and the two little Princes sat on the hearth together, Lothaire surprised, but sullen.  Richard stirred the embers, so as to bring out more heat, then spoke: ""Prince, will you let us be friends?""",subdued fright cold darkness allow lead fire low end hall snore half man arm upper hearth be raise head boy come whisper soft pat quiet little sit hearth surprise sullen stirr ember bring more heat speak let friend
