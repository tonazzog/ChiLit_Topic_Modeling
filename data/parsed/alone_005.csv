1,CHAPTER V. FORSAKEN AGAIN.,
2," The next three days were a season of unmixed happiness to old Oliver. The little child was so merry, yet withal so gentle and sweet-tempered, that she kept him in a state of unwearied delight, without any alloy of anxiety or trouble. She trotted at his side with short, running footsteps, when he went out early in the morning to fetch his daily stock of newspapers. She watched him set his room tidy, and made believe to help him by dusting the legs and seats of his two chairs. She stood with folded hands and serious face, looking on as he was busy with his cooking. When she was not thus engaged she played contentedly with Beppo, prattling to him in such a manner, that Oliver often forgot what he was about while listening to her. She played with him, too, frolicsome little games of hide-and-seek, in which he grew as eager as herself; and sometimes she stole his spectacles, or handkerchief, or anything she could lay her mischievous fingers upon to hide away in some unthought-of spot; while her shrewd, cunning little face put on an expression of profound gravity as old Oliver sought everywhere for them.",next day season unmixed happiness old little child merry gentle sweet temper keep state unwearied delight alloy anxiety trouble trotet side short run footstep go morning fetch daily stock newspaper watch set room tidy make believe help dust leg seat chair stand fold hand serious face look busy cooking engage play prattle manner forget listen play frolicsome little game hide seek grow eager steal spectacle handkerchief lay mischievous finger hide unthought spot shrewd cunn little face put expression profound gravity old seek 
3,"As Friday evening drew near, the old man's gladness took a shade of anxiety. His daughter was coming home to him, and his heart was full of unutterable joy and gratitude; but he did not know exactly how they should go on in the future. He was averse to change; yet this little house, with its single room, to which he had moved when she forsook him, was too scanty in its accommodation. He had made up a rude sort of bed for himself under the counter in the shop, and was quite ready to give up his own to Susan and his little love, as he called Dolly; but would Susan let him have his own way in this, and many other things? He provided a sumptuous tea, and added a fresh salad to it from the greengrocer's next door; but though he and Dolly waited and watched till long after the child's bed-time, taking occasional snatches of bread and butter, still Susan did not arrive. At length a postman entered the little shop with a noise which made Oliver's heart beat violently, and tossed a letter down upon the counter. He carried it to the door, where there was still light enough to read it, and saw that it was in Susan's handwriting.",evening draw old man gladness take shade anxiety daughter come heart full unutterable joy gratitude know go future averse change little house single room move forsook scanty accommodation make rude sort bed counter shop ready give own little love call let have own way many other thing provide sumptuous tea add fresh salad greengrocer next door wait watch child bed time take occasional snatch bread butter arrive length postman enter little shop noise make heart beat toss letter counter carry door be light read see handwriting

5,"""My heart is almost broke, betwixt one thing and another. His regiment is to set sail immediate, and the colonel's lady has offered me very handsome wages to go out with her as lady's maid, her own having disappointed her at the last moment; which I could do very well, knowing the dressmaking. He said, 'Do come, Susan, and I'll never get drunk again, so help me God; and if you don't, I shall go to the bad altogether; for I do love you, Susan.' I said, 'Oh my child!' And the colonel's lady said, 'She's safe with her grandfather; and if he's a good man, as you say he is, he'll take the best of care of her. I'll give you three pounds to send him from here, and we'll send more from Calcutta.' So they overpersuaded me, and there isn't even time to come back to London, for we are going in a few hours. You'll take care of my little dear, I know, you and aunt Charlotte. I've sent a little box of clothes for her by the railway, and what more she wants aunt Charlotte will see to, I'm sure, and do her mending, and see to her manners till I come home. Oh! if I could only hear you say 'Susan, my dear, I forgive you, and love you almost as much as ever,' I'd go with a lighter heart, and be almost glad to leave Dolly to be a comfort to you. She will be a comfort to you, though she is so little, I'm sure. Tell her mammy says she must be a good girl always till mammy comes back. A hundred thousand kisses for my dear father and my little girl. We shall come home as soon as ever we can; but I don't rightly know where India is. I think it's my bounden duty to go with him, as things have turned out. Pray God take care of us all.",heart broke betwixt thing regiment set sail immediate colonel lady offer handsome wage go lady maid own disappoint last moment do know dressmaking say come get drunk help go bad love say child colonel lady say safe grandfather good man say take good care give pound send send more overpersuad be time come go few hour take care little dear know aunt send little box clothes railway more want aunt see sure do mending see manners come hear say dear forgive love much go light heart glad leave comfort comfort little sure tell mammy say good girl mammy come kisse dear father little girl come know think bounden duty go thing turn pray take care
