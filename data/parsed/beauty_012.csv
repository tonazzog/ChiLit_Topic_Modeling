1,CHAPTER 12. A Stormy Day,stormy day 
2," One day late in the autumn my master had a long journey to go on business. I was put into the dog-cart, and John went with his master. I always liked to go in the dog-cart, it was so light and the high wheels ran along so pleasantly. There had been a great deal of rain, and now the wind was very high and blew the dry leaves across the road in a shower. We went along merrily till we came to the toll-bar and the low wooden bridge. The river banks were rather high, and the bridge, instead of rising, went across just level, so that in the middle, if the river was full, the water would be nearly up to the woodwork and planks; but as there were good substantial rails on each side, people did not mind it.",day autumn master have long journey go business put dog cart go master like go dog cart light high wheel run be great deal rain wind high blow dry leave road shower go come toll bar low wooden bridge river bank high bridge rise go level middle river full water woodwork plank be good substantial rail side person mind 
3,"The man at the gate said the river was rising fast, and he feared it would be a bad night. Many of the meadows were under water, and in one low part of the road the water was halfway up to my knees; the bottom was good, and master drove gently, so it was no matter.",man gate say river rise fear bad night many meadow water low part road water knee bottom good master drive matter 
4,"When we got to the town of course I had a good bait, but as the master’s business engaged him a long time we did not start for home till rather late in the afternoon. The wind was then much higher, and I heard the master say to John that he had never been out in such a storm; and so I thought, as we went along the skirts of a wood, where the great branches were swaying about like twigs, and the rushing sound was terrible.",get town course have good bait master business engage long time start home afternoon wind high hear master say storm think go skirt wood great branch sway twig rush sound terrible 
5,"“I wish we were well out of this wood,” said my master.",wish wood say master 
6,"“Yes, sir,” said John, “it would be rather awkward if one of these branches came down upon us.”",sir say awkward branch come 
7,"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when there was a groan, and a crack, and a splitting sound, and tearing, crashing down among the other trees came an oak, torn up by the roots, and it fell right across the road just before us. I will never say I was not frightened, for I was. I stopped still, and I believe I trembled; of course I did not turn round or run away; I was not brought up to that. John jumped out and was in a moment at my head.",word mouth be groan crack split sound tear crash other tree come oak tear root fall road say frighten stop believe tremble course turn run bring jump moment head 
8,"“That was a very near touch,” said my master. “What’s to be done now?”",near touch say master do 
9,"“Well, sir, we can’t drive over that tree, nor yet get round it; there will be nothing for it, but to go back to the four crossways, and that will be a good six miles before we get round to the wooden bridge again; it will make us late, but the horse is fresh.”",sir drive tree get be go crossway good mile get wooden bridge make late horse fresh 
10,"So back we went and round by the crossroads, but by the time we got to the bridge it was very nearly dark; we could just see that the water was over the middle of it; but as that happened sometimes when the floods were out, master did not stop. We were going along at a good pace, but the moment my feet touched the first part of the bridge I felt sure there was something wrong. I dare not go forward, and I made a dead stop. “Go on, Beauty,” said my master, and he gave me a touch with the whip, but I dare not stir; he gave me a sharp cut; I jumped, but I dare not go forward.",go crossroad time get bridge dark see water middle happen flood master stop go good pace moment foot touch first part bridge feel sure be wrong go make dead stop go say master give touch whip stir give sharp cut jump go 
11,"“There’s something wrong, sir,” said John, and he sprang out of the dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward. “Come on, Beauty, what’s the matter?” Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe.",be wrong sir say spring dog cart come head look try lead come beauty matter course tell know bridge safe 
12,"Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.",man toll gate other side run house toss torch mad 
13,"“Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!” he cried.",stop cry 
14,“What’s the matter?” shouted my master.,matter shout master 
15,"“The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if you come on you’ll be into the river.”",bridge break middle part carry come river 
16,"“Thank God!” said my master. “You Beauty!” said John, and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor John spoke, and then master began in a serious voice. I could not understand much of what they said, but I found they thought, if I had gone on as the master wanted me, most likely the bridge would have given way under us, and horse, chaise, master, and man would have fallen into the river; and as the current was flowing very strongly, and there was no light and no help at hand, it was more than likely we should all have been drowned. Master said, God had given men reason, by which they could find out things for themselves; but he had given animals knowledge which did not depend on reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect in its way, and by which they had often saved the lives of men. John had many stories to tell of dogs and horses, and the wonderful things they had done; he thought people did not value their animals half enough nor make friends of them as they ought to do. I am sure he makes friends of them if ever a man did.",thank say master beauty say take bridle turn right hand road river side sun set time wind seem lull furious blast tore tree grow dark dark stiller stiller trotet wheel make sound soft road good master speak master begin serious voice understand much say find think go master want likely bridge give way horse chaise master man fall river current flow be light help hand more likely drown master say give man reason find thing give animal knowledge depend reason prompt perfect way save life man have many story tell dog horse wonderful thing do think person value animal half make friend do sure make friend man 
17,"At last we came to the park gates and found the gardener looking out for us. He said that mistress had been in a dreadful way ever since dark, fearing some accident had happened, and that she had sent James off on Justice, the roan cob, toward the wooden bridge to make inquiry after us.",last come park gate find gardener look say mistress dreadful way dark fear accident happen send roan cob wooden bridge make inquiry 
18,"We saw a light at the hall-door and at the upper windows, and as we came up mistress ran out, saying, “Are you really safe, my dear? Oh! I have been so anxious, fancying all sorts of things. Have you had no accident?”",see light hall door upper window come mistress run say safe dear anxious fancy sort thing have accident 
19,"“No, my dear; but if your Black Beauty had not been wiser than we were we should all have been carried down the river at the wooden bridge.”  I heard no more, as they went into the house, and John took me to the stable. Oh, what a good supper he gave me that night, a good bran mash and some crushed beans with my oats, and such a thick bed of straw! and I was glad of it, for I was tired.",dear black wise carry river wooden bridge hear more go house take stable good supper give night good bran mash crush bean oat thick bed straw glad tired
