1,CHAPTER 21. The Battle Outside Calcutta.,
2," After the defeat of the enemy, who had surprised and so nearly annihilated him, Clive marched at once towards the fort of Baj-baj. On the way he met Major Kilpatrick, who was advancing, with a force which had been landed from the ships when the sound of firing was heard, to his assistance.",defeat enemy surprise annihilate march fort way meet advance force land ship sound fire hear assistance 
3,"The fleet had, at daybreak, opened a heavy fire upon the ramparts; and by the afternoon effected a breach. As his men were greatly fatigued, and had had but an hour's sleep, Clive determined upon delaying the attack until the morning; and a party of two hundred and fifty sailors, with two guns, were landed to take part in the storming.",fleet daybreak open heavy fire rampart afternoon effect breach man fatigue have hour sleep determine delay attack morning party sailor gun land take part storming 
4,"Many of these sailors had drunk freely before landing, and as night fell, some of them strolled towards the fort. One of the number, named Strahan, moved along, unobserved by the enemy, to the foot of the breach, climbed up it, and came suddenly upon a party of its defenders sitting round a fire, smoking. Strahan immediately fired his pistol among them, with a shout of, ""The fort is mine!"" and then gave three rousing cheers.",many sailor drink land night fall stroll fort number name move unobserve enemy foot breach climb come party defender sit fire smoking fire pistol shout fort give rousing cheer 
5,"The enemy leaped to their feet and ran off for a little way. Then, seeing Strahan was alone, they rushed back and attacked him, firing as they came. Strahan, drawing his cutlass, defended himself vigorously for some time; but his weapon broke off at the hilt, just as a number of Sepoys and men of the 39th, who had been awakened from their sleep by the shouting and firing, came running up. Reinforcements of the garrison also joined their friends, but these were dispirited by the sudden and unexpected attack; and, as the troops continued to stream up the breach, the garrison were pressed; and, losing heart, fled through the opposite gate of the fort.",enemy leap foot run little way see alone rush attack fire come draw cutlass defend time weapon break hilt number man 39th awaken sleep shouting fire come run reinforcement garrison join friend dispirite sudden unexpected attack troops continue stream breach garrison press lose heart flead opposite gate fort 
6,"The only casualty on the British side was that Captain Campbell, marching up at the head of the Sepoys, was mistaken for an enemy by the sailors, and shot dead. Strahan was, in the morning, severely reprimanded by the admiral for his breach of discipline; and, retiring from the cabin, said to his comrades:",only casualty british side march head mistaken enemy sailor shoot dead morning reprimand admiral breach discipline retire cabin say comrade

8,"Manak Chand was so alarmed at the fighting powers shown by the English in these two affairs, that, leaving only a garrison of five hundred men at Calcutta, he retired with his army to join the nabob at Moorshedabad. When the fleet arrived before the town, the enemy surrendered the fort at the first shot, and it was again taken possession of by the English.",alarmed fighting power show affair leave garrison man retire army join nabob fleet arrive town enemy surrender fort first shot take possession 
9,"Major Kilpatrick was at once sent up, with five ships and a few hundred men, to capture the town of Hoogly, twenty miles farther up. The defences of the place were strong. It was held by two thousand men, and three thousand horsemen lay around it. The ships, however, at once opened a cannonade upon it, and effected a breach before night, and at daybreak the place was taken by storm.",send ship few man capture town mile defence place strong hold man horsemen lay ship open cannonade effect breach night daybreak place take storm 
10,"Two days after the capture of Calcutta, the news arrived that war had again been declared between England and France. It was fortunate that this was not known a little earlier; for had the French forces been joined to those under Manak Chand, the reconquest of Calcutta would not have been so easily achieved.",day capture news arrive war declare fortunate know little french force join reconquest achieve 
11,"The nabob, furious at the loss of Calcutta, and the capture and sack of Hoogly, at once despatched a messenger to the governor of the French colony of Chandranagore, to join him in crushing the English. The governor, however, had received orders that, in the event of war being declared between England and France, he was, if possible, to arrange with the English that neutrality should be observed between them. He therefore refused the nabob's request, and then sent messengers to Calcutta, to treat.",nabob furious loss capture sack despatch messenger governor french colony join crush governor receive order event war declare possible arrange neutrality observe refuse nabob request send messenger treat 
12,"The nabob had gathered an army of ten thousand foot and fifteen thousand horse, and advanced against Calcutta, arriving before the town on the 2nd February, 1757. Clive's force had now, owing to the arrival of some reinforcements from Europe, and the enlisting of fresh Sepoys, been raised to seven hundred European infantry, a hundred artillerymen, and fifteen hundred Sepoys, with fourteen light field pieces.",nabob gather army foot horse advance arrive town 2nd force ow arrival reinforcement enlisting fresh raise european infantry artillerymen sepoy light field piece 
13,"The whole of the town of Calcutta was surrounded by a deep cut, with a bank behind, called the Mahratta Ditch. A mile beyond this was a large saltwater lake, so that an enemy advancing from the north would have to pass within a short distance of Clive's intrenched position outside the town, affording him great opportunities for a flank attack. On the day of their arrival Clive marched out, but the enemy opened a heavy fire, and he retired.",whole town surround deep cut bank call mile large saltwater lake enemy advance north have pass short distance intrenched position town afford great opportunity flank attack day arrival march enemy open heavy fire retire 
14,"Clive determined to attack the enemy, next morning. Admiral Watson, at his request, at once landed five hundred and sixty sailors, under the command of Captain Warwick of the Thunderer. A considerable portion of the enemy had crossed the Mahratta Ditch, and encamped within it. The nabob himself pitched his tent in the garden of Omichund (a native Calcutta merchant who, though in the nabob's camp from motives of policy, sympathized entirely with the English), which occupied an advanced bastion within the Mahratta Ditch. The rest of the army were encamped between the ditch and the saltwater lake.",determine attack enemy next morning request land sailor command considerable portion enemy cross encamp nabob pitch tent garden native merchant nabob camp motive policy sympathize occupy advanced bastion rest army encamp ditch saltwater lake 
15,"Clive's intentions were to march first against the battery which had played on him so effectually the day before; and, having carried this, to march directly against the garden in which the nabob was encamped. The force with which he started, at three o'clock in the morning of the 3rd, consisted of the five hundred and sixty sailors, who drew with them six guns, six hundred and fifty European infantry, a hundred European artillery, and eight hundred Sepoys. Half the Sepoys led the advance, the remainder covered the rear.",intention march battery play day carry march garden nabob encamp force start o'clock morning 3rd consist sailor draw gun european infantry european artillery sepoy lead advance remainder cover rear 
16,"Soon after daybreak, the Sepoys came in contact with the enemy's advanced guard, placed in ditches along a road leading from the head of the lake to the Mahratta Ditch. These discharged their muskets, and some rockets, and took to flight. One of the rockets caused a serious disaster. The Sepoys had their ammunition pouches open, and the contents of one of these was fired by the rocket. The flash of the flame communicated the fire to the pouch of the next Sepoy, and so the flame ran along the line, killing, wounding, and scorching many, and causing the greatest confusion. Fortunately the enemy were not near, and Captain Eyre Coote, who led the British infantry behind them, aided Charlie, who led the advance, in restoring order, and the forward movement again went on.",daybreak come contact enemy advanced guard place ditch road lead head lake discharge musket rocket take flight rocket cause serious disaster have ammunition pouch open content fire rocket flash flame communicate fire pouch next flame run line kill wound scorch many cause great confusion enemy lead british infantry aid lead advance restore order forward movement go 
17,"A new obstacle had, however, arisen. With the morning a dense fog had set in, rendering it impossible for the troops to see even a few yards in advance of them. Still they pushed on and, unopposed, reached a point opposite Omichund's garden, but divided from it by the Mahratta Ditch.",new obstacle arise morning dense fog set rendering impossible troops see few yard advance push unopposed reach point garden divide 
18,"Presently they heard the thunder of a great body of approaching cavalry. They waited quietly until the unseen horse had approached within a few yards of them, and then poured a mighty volley into the fog. The noise ceased abruptly, and was followed by that of the enemy's cavalry in retreat.",hear thunder great body approach cavalry wait unseen horse approach few yard pour mighty volley fog noise cease follow enemy cavalry retreat 
19,"The fog was now so dense that it was impossible even to judge of the directions in which the troops were moving. Clive knew, however, that the Mahratta Ditch was on his right and, moving a portion of his troops till they touched this, he again advanced, his object being to gain a causeway which, raised several feet above the country, led from Calcutta, across the Mahratta Ditch, into the country beyond. Towards this Clive now advanced, his troops firing, as they marched, into the fog ahead of them, and the guns firing from the flanks, obliquely, to the right and left.",fog dense impossible judge direction troops move know right move portion troops touch advance object gain causeway raise several foot country lead country advance troops fire march fog gun fire flank right leave 
20,"Without experiencing any opposition Clive reached the causeway, and the Sepoys, turning to their right, advanced along this towards the ditch. As they crossed this, however, they came in the line of fire of their own guns, the officer commanding them being ignorant of what was taking place in front, and unable to see a foot before him. Charlie, closely accompanied always by Tim, was at the head of his troops when the iron hail of the English guns struck the head of the column, mowing down numbers of men. A panic ensued, and the Sepoys, terror stricken at this discharge, from a direction in which they considered themselves secure, leaped from the causeway into the dry ditch and sheltered themselves there. Charlie and his companion were saved by the fact that they were a few paces ahead of the column.",experience opposition reach causeway turn right advance ditch cross come line fire own gun officer commanding ignorant take place front unable see foot accompany head troops iron hail english gun strike head column mow number man panic ensue terror stricken discharge direction consider secure leap causeway dry ditch shelter companion save fact few pace column 
21,"""Run back, Tim,"" Charlie said. ""Find Colonel Clive, and tell him that we are being mowed down by our own artillery. If you can't find him, hurry back to the guns, and tell the officer what he is doing.""",run say find tell mow own artillery find hurry gun tell officer do 
22,"Charlie then leaped down into the ditch, and endeavoured to rally the Sepoys. A few minutes later Clive himself arrived, and the Sepoys were induced to leave the ditch, and to form again by the side of the causeway, along which the British troops were now marching.",leap ditch endeavour rally few minute arrive induce leave ditch form side causeway british troops march 
23,"Suddenly, however, from the fog burst out the discharge of two heavy guns, which the enemy had mounted on a bastion flanking the ditch. The shouts of the officers, and the firing of the men, indicated precisely the position of the column. The grapeshot tore through it, and twenty-two of the English troops fell dead and wounded. Immediately afterwards another discharge followed, and the column, broken and confused, bewildered by the dense fog, and dismayed by the fire of these unseen guns, fell back.",fog burst discharge heavy gun enemy mount bastion flank ditch shout officer fire man indicate position column grapeshot tore english troops fall dead wound discharge follow column break confuse bewilder dense fog dismay fire unseen gun fall 
24,"Clive now determined to push on to the main road, which he knew crossed the fields half a mile in front of him. The country was, however, here laid out in rice fields, each inclosed by banks and ditches. Over these banks it was impossible to drag the guns, and the sailors could only get them along by descending into the ditches, and using these as roads. The labour was prodigious, and the men, fatigued and harassed by this battle in darkness, and by the fire from the unseen guns which the enemy continued to pour in their direction from either flank, began to lose heart.",determine push main road know cross field mile front country lay rice field inclose bank ditch bank impossible drag gun sailor get descend ditch use road labour prodigious man fatigue harass battle darkness fire unseen gun enemy continue pour direction flank begin lose heart 
25,"Happily, however, the fog began to lift. The flanks of the columns were covered by bodies of troops, thrown out on either side, and after more than an hour's hard work, and abandoning two of the guns which had broken down, Clive reached the main road, again formed his men in column, and advanced towards the city.",fog begin lift flank column cover body troops throw side more hour hard work abandon gun break reach main road form man column advance city 
26,"The odds were overwhelmingly against him. There were guns, infantry, and cavalry, both in front and behind them. The column pressed on, in spite of the heavy fire, crossed the ditch, and attacked a strong body of the enemy drawn up on the opposite side. While it did so, a great force of the nabob's cavalry swept down on the rear, and for a moment captured the guns. Ensign Yorke, of the 39th Foot, faced the rear company about, and made a gallant charge upon the horsemen, drove them back, and recaptured the guns.",odd be gun infantry cavalry front column press spite heavy fire cross ditch attack strong body enemy draw opposite side great force nabob cavalry sweep rear moment capture gun 39th face rear company make gallant charge horsemen drive recapture gun 
27,"Clive's whole army was now across the ditch, and it was open to him either to carry out his original plan of attacking Omichund's garden, or of marching forward into the fort of Calcutta. Seeing that his men were fatigued, and worn out with six hours of labour and marching under the most difficult circumstances, he took the latter alternative, entered Calcutta, and then, following the stream, marched back to the camp he had left in the morning.",whole army ditch open carry original plan attack garden march fort see man fatigue wear hour labour march difficult circumstance take latter alternative enter follow stream march camp leave morning 
28,"His loss amounted to thirty-nine Europeans killed, and eighteen Sepoys; eighty-two Europeans wounded, and thirty-five Sepoys; the casualties being caused almost entirely by the enemy's cannon.",loss amount kill sepoy wound sepoy casualty cause enemy 
29,"The expedition, from a military point of view, had been an entire failure. He had carried neither the battery nor Omichund's garden. Had it not been for the fog he might have succeeded in both these objects; but, upon the other hand, the enemy were as much disconcerted by the fog as he was, and were unable to use their forces with any effect. Military critics have decided that the whole operation was a mistake; but although a mistake and a failure, its consequences were no less decisive.",expedition military point view entire failure carry battery garden fog succeed object other hand enemy disconcert fog unable use force effect military critic decide whole operation mistake mistake failure consequence decisive 
30,"The nabob, struck with astonishment at the daring and dash of the English, in venturing with so small a force to attack him, and to march through the very heart of his camp, was seized with terror. He had lost thirteen hundred men in the fight, among whom were twenty-four rajahs and lesser chiefs, and the next morning he sent in a proposal for peace.",nabob strike astonishment dare dash venture small force attack march very heart camp seize terror lose man fight rajah less chief next morning send proposal peace 
31,"A less determined man than Clive would, no doubt, have accepted the proposal. Calcutta was still besieged by a vastly superior force, supplies of all kinds were running short, the attack of the previous day had been a failure. He knew, however, the character of Asiatics, and determined to play the game of bounce. The very offer of the nabob showed him that the latter was alarmed. He therefore wrote to him, saying that he had simply marched his troops through his highness' camp to show him of what British soldiers were capable; but that he had been careful to avoid hurting anyone, except those who actually opposed his progress. He concluded by expressing his willingness to accede to the nabob's proposal, and to negotiate.",determined man accept proposal besiege superior force supplies kind run short attack previous day failure know character determined play game bounce very offer nabob show latter alarm write say march troops highness camp show british soldier capable careful avoid hurt oppose progress conclude express willingness accede nabob proposal negotiate 
32,"The nabob took it all in. If all this destruction and confusion had been wrought by a simple march through his camp, what would be the result if Clive were to take into his head to attack him in earnest? He therefore at once withdrew his army three miles to the rear, and opened negotiations. He granted all that the English asked: that all the property and privileges of the Company should be restored, that all their goods should pass into the country free of tax, that all the Company's factories, and all moneys and properties belonging to it or its servants, should be restored or made good, and that permission should be given to them to fortify Calcutta as they pleased.",nabob take destruction confusion wring simple march camp result take head attack earnest withdraw army mile rear open negotiation grant ask property privilege company restore goods pass country free tax company factory money property belong servant restore make good permission give fortify pleased 
33,"Having agreed to these conditions, the nabob, upon the 11th of February, retired with his army to his capital; leaving Omichund with a commission to propose to the English a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, against all enemies. This proposal was a most acceptable one, and Clive determined to seize the opportunity to crush the French. His previous experiences, around Madras, had taught him that the French were the most formidable rivals of England in India. He knew that large reinforcements were on their way to Pondicherry, and he feared that the nabob, when he recovered from his panic, might regret the conditions which he had granted, and might ally himself with the French in an effort, again, to expel the English.",agree condition nabob 11th retire army capital leave commission propose treaty alliance offensive defensive enemy proposal acceptable one determine seize opportunity crush previous experience teach formidable rival know large reinforcement way fear nabob recover panic regret condition grant ally effort expel 
34,"He therefore determined at once to attack the French. The deputies sent by Monsieur Renault, the governor of Chandranagore, had been kept waiting from day to day, under one pretence or another; and they now wrote to the governor that they believed that there was no real intention, on the part of the English, to sign an agreement of neutrality with him; and that they would be the next objects of attack. Monsieur Renault immediately sent messengers to the nabob, urging upon him that, if the English were allowed to annihilate the French, they would be more dangerous enemies than ever; and Suraja-u-Dowlah, having now recovered from his terror, wrote at once to Calcutta, peremptorily forbidding any hostilities against the French.",determine attack deputy send governor keep wait day day pretence write governor believe be real intention part sign agreement neutrality next object attack send messenger nabob urge allow annihilate dangerous enemy recover terror write forbid hostility 
35,"To show his determination, he despatched fifteen hundred men to Hoogly, which the English had abandoned after capturing it, with instructions to help the French if attacked; and he sent a lac of rupees to Monsieur Renault, to aid him in preparing for his defence.",show determination despatch man abandon capture instruction help attack send lac rupee aid prepare defence 
36,"Clive, unwilling to face a coalition between the French and the nabob, was in favour of acceding to the nabob's orders. The treaty of neutrality with the French was drawn up, and would have been signed, had it not been for the obstinate refusal of Admiral Watson to agree to it. Between that officer and Clive there had never been any cordial feeling, and from the time of their first connection, at the siege of Gheriah, differences of opinion, frequently leading to angry disputes, had taken place between them. Nor was it strange that this should be so. Both were brave and gallant men; but while Watson had the punctilious sense of honor which naturally belongs to an English gentleman, Clive was wholly unscrupulous as to the means which he employed to gain his ends.",unwilling face coalition french nabob favour acced nabob order treaty neutrality draw sign obstinate refusal agree officer be cordial feeling time first connection siege difference opinion lead angry dispute take place strange brave gallant man have punctilious sense honor belong english gentleman unscrupulous means employ gain end 
37,"Between two such men, it is not singular that disagreements arose. Admiral Watson, impelled by feelings of personal dislike to Clive, often allowed himself to be carried to unwarrantable lengths. On the occasion of the capture of Calcutta, he ordered Captain Eyre Coote, who first entered it, to hold it in the king's name, and to disobey Clive's orders, although the latter had been granted a commission in the royal army as lieutenant colonel, and was, moreover, the chief authority of the Company in all affairs on land. Upon Clive's asserting himself, Admiral Watson absolutely threatened to open fire upon his troops. Apparently from a sheer feeling of opposition, he now opposed the signing of the treaty with the French, and several days were spent in stormy altercations.",such man singular disagreement arise impell feeling personal dislike allow carry unwarrantable length occasion capture order enter hold king name disobey order latter grant commission royal army lieutenant colonel chief authority company affair land assert threaten open fire troops sheer feeling opposition oppose signing treaty several day spend stormy altercation 
38,"Circumstances occurred, during this time, which strengthened the view he took, and changed those of Clive and his colleagues of the council. Just then, the news reached Suraja-u-Dowlah that Delhi had been captured by the Afghans; and, terrified at the thought that the victorious northern enemy might next turn their arms against him, he wrote to Clive, begging him to march to his assistance, and offering a lac of rupees a month towards the expense of his army.",circumstance occur time strengthen view take change colleague council news reach capture terrified thought victorious northern enemy turn arm write begg march assistance offer lac rupee month expense army 
39,"On the same day that Clive received the letter, he heard that Commodore James and three ships, with reinforcements from Bombay, had arrived at the mouth of the Hoogly; and that the Cumberland, with three hundred troops, which had grounded on her way from Madras, was now coming up the river.",same day receive letter hear ship reinforcement arrive mouth troops ground way come river 
40,"Almost at the same moment he heard, from Omichund, who had accompanied the nabob to Moorshedabad, that he had bribed the governor of Hoogly to offer no opposition to the passage of the troops up the river.",same moment hear accompany nabob bribe governor offer opposition passage troops river 
41,"Clive was now ready to agree to Admiral Watson's views, and to advance at once against Chandranagore; but the admiral again veered round, and refused to agree to the measure, unless the consent of the nabob was obtained. He wrote, however, himself, a threatening, and indeed violent letter to the nabob, ordering him to give his consent. The nabob, still under the influence of his fears from the Afghans, replied in terms which amounted to consent, but the very next day, having received news which calmed his fears as to the Afghans, he wrote peremptorily, forbidding the expedition against the French. This letter, however, was disregarded, and the expedition prepared to start.",ready agree view advance admiral veer refuse agree measure consent nabob obtain write threatening violent letter nabob order give consent nabob influence fear reply term amount consent next day receive news calm fear write forbid expedition letter disregard expedition prepare start 
42,"It consisted of seven hundred Europeans and fifteen hundred native infantry, who started by land; a hundred and fifty artillery proceeding in boats, escorted by three ships of war and several smaller vessels, under Admiral Watson.",consist native infantry start land artillery proceed boat escort ship war several small vessel 
43,"The French garrison consisted only of a hundred and forty-six French, and three hundred Sepoys. Besides these were three hundred of the European population, and sailors of the merchant ships in port, who had been hastily formed into a militia.",french garrison consist french sepoy european population sailor merchant ship port form militia 
44,"The governor, indignant at the duplicity with which he had been treated, had worked vigorously at his defences. The settlement extended along the river banks for two miles. In the centre stood the fort, which was a hundred and twenty yards square, mounting ten thirty-two pounder guns on each of its four bastions. Twenty four-pounder guns were placed on the ramparts, facing the river on the south. On an outlying work commanding the watergate eight thirty-two pounders were mounted. Monsieur Renault set to work to demolish all the houses within a hundred yards of the fort, and to erect batteries commanding the approaches. He ordered an officer to sink several ships in the only navigable channel, about a hundred and fifty yards to the south of the fort, at a point commanded by the guns of one of the batteries.",governor indignant duplicity treat work defence settlement extend river bank mile centre stand fort yard square mount pounder gun bastion pounder gun place rampart face river south outly work commanding watergate pounder mount set work demolish house yard fort erect battery commanding approach order officer sink several ship only navigable channel yard south fort point command gun battery 
45,"The officer was a traitor. He purposely sank the ships in such a position as to leave a channel, through which the English ships might pass; and then, seizing his opportunity, deserted to them.",officer traitor sink ship position leave channel english ship pass seize opportunity desert 
46,"On approaching the town Clive, knowing that Charlie could speak the native language fluently, asked him whether he would undertake to reconnoitre the position of the enemy, with which he was entirely unacquainted. Charlie willingly agreed. When, on the night of the 13th of March, the army halted a few miles from the town, Charlie, disguising himself in a native dress and accompanied by Hossein, left the camp and made his way to the town. This he had no difficulty in entering. It extended a mile and a half back from the river, and consisted of houses standing in large gardens and inclosures. The whole of the Europeans were labouring at the erection of the batteries, and the destruction of the houses surrounding them; and Charlie and his companion, approaching closely to one of these, were pounced upon by the French officer in command of a working party, and set to work, with a number of natives, in demolishing the houses.",approach town know speak native language ask undertake reconnoitre position enemy unacquaint agree night 13th army halt few mile town disguise native dress accompany leave camp make way town have difficulty enter extend mile half river consist house stand large garden inclosure whole labour erection battery destruction house surround companion approach pounce french officer command working party set work number native demolish house

48,"""Native man never work like that, sahib. Not when he's paid ever so much. Work still less, no pay. The French would soon notice the sahib, if he laboured like that.""",native man work pay much work less pay notice sahib laboure 
49,"Thus admonished, Charlie adapted his actions to those of his companions and, after working until dawn approached, he managed, with Hossein, to evade the attention of the officer; and, drawing off, hurried away to rejoin Clive. The latter was moving from the west, by a road leading to the northern face of the fort. It was at the battery which Renault was erecting upon this road that Charlie had been labouring. The latter informed Clive of the exact position of the work, and also, that although strong by itself, it was commanded by many adjoining houses; which the French, in spite of their efforts, had not time to destroy.",admonish adapt action companion work dawn approach manage evade attention officer draw hurry rejoin latter move west road lead northern face fort battery erect road labour latter inform exact position work strong command many adjoin house spite effort have time destroy
