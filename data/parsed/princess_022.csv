I think that will be better anyhow, for I'm sure nobody who met us would believe a word we said to them. They would think we made it all up.

38,"""What does it all mean, grandmother?"" she sobbed, and burst into fresh tears.",mean grandmother sobb burst fresh tear 
39,"""It means, my love, that I did not mean to show myself. Curdie is not yet able to believe some things. Seeing is not believing--it is only seeing.

40,"""Yes; but I should have thought Curdie--""",think 
41,"""You are right. Curdie is much farther on than Lootie, and you will see what will come of it. But in the meantime, you must be content, I say, to be misunderstood for a while.

57,"And she held up to her a little mirror which she had brought from the cabinet. The princess burst into a merry laugh at the sight. She was so draggled with the stream, and dirty with creeping through narrow places, that if she had seen the reflection without knowing it was a reflection, she would have taken herself for some gypsy-child whose face was washed and hair combed about once in a month. The lady laughed too, and lifting her again upon her knee, took off her cloak and night-gown. Then she carried her to the side of the room. Irene wondered what she was going to do with her, but asked no questions--only starting a little when she found that she was going to lay her in the large silver bath; for as she looked into it, again she saw no bottom, but the stars shining miles away as it seemed in a great blue gulf. Her hands closed involuntarily on the beautiful arms that held her, and that was all.",hold little mirror bring cabinet princess burst merry laugh sight draggle stream dirty creep narrow place see reflection know reflection take gypsy child face wash hair comb month lady laugh lift knee take cloak night gown carry side room wonder go do ask question start little find go lay large silver bath look see bottom star shine mile seem great blue gulf hand close beautiful arm hold

61,"When she opened her eyes, she saw nothing but a strange lovely blue over and beneath and all about her. The lady and the beautiful room had vanished from her sight, and she seemed utterly alone. But instead of being afraid, she felt more than happy--perfectly blissful. And from somewhere came the voice of the lady, singing a strange sweet song, of which she could distinguish every word; but of the sense she had only a feeling--no understanding. Nor could she remember a single line after it was gone. It vanished, like the poetry in a dream, as fast as it came. In after years, however, she would sometimes fancy that snatches of melody suddenly rising in her brain, must be little phrases and fragments of the air of that song; and the very fancy would make her happier, and abler to do her duty.",open eye see strange lovely blue lady beautiful room vanish sight seem alone afraid feel more happy blissful come voice lady sing strange sweet song distinguish word sense have feeling understanding remember single line gone vanish poetry dream come year fancy snatch melody rise brain little phrase fragment air song very fancy make happy abler do duty 
62,"How long she lay in the water she did not know. It seemed a long time--not from weariness, but from pleasure. But at last she felt the beautiful hands lay hold of her, and through the gurgling waters she was lifted out into the lovely room. The lady carried her to the fire, and sat down with her in her lap, and dried her tenderly with the softest towel. It was so different from Lootie's drying! When the lady had done, she stooped to the fire, and drew from it her night-gown, as white as snow.",lay water know seem long time weariness pleasure last feel beautiful hand lay hold gurgle water lift lovely room lady carry fire sit lap dry softest towel different drying lady do stoop fire draw night gown white snow

67,"""Don't trouble yourself about it. You will find it all come right,"" said her grandmother, and laid her into the blue bed, under the rosy counterpane.",trouble find come say grandmother lay blue bed rosy counterpane 
68,"""There is just one thing more,"" said Irene. ""I am a little anxious about Curdie. As I brought him into the house, I ought to have seen him safe on his way home.""",be thing more say little anxious bring house see safe way 
69,"""I took care of all that,"" answered the lady. ""I told you to let him go, and therefore I was bound to look after him. Nobody saw him, and he is now eating a good dinner in his mother's cottage, far up the mountain.""",take care answer lady tell let go bind look see eat good dinner mother cottage mountain
