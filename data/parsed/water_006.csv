5," I come to the very saddest part of all my story.  I know some people will only laugh at it, and call it much ado about nothing. But I know one man who would not; and he was an officer with a pair of gray moustaches as long as your arm, who said once in company that two of the most heart-rending sights in the world, which moved him most to tears, which he would do anything to prevent or remedy, were a child over a broken toy and a child stealing sweets.",come saddest part story know person laugh call much ado know man officer pair gray moustach arm say company heart rending sight world move most tear do prevent remedy child break toy child steal sweet 
6,"The company did not laugh at him; his moustaches were too long and too gray for that:  but, after he was gone, they called him sentimental and so forth, all but one dear little old Quaker lady with a soul as white as her cap, who was not, of course, generally partial to soldiers; and she said very quietly, like a Quaker:",company laugh moustach long gray gone call sentimental dear little old lady soul white cap course partial soldier say 
7,"""Friends, it is borne upon my mind that that is a truly brave man.""",friend borne mind brave man 
8,"Now you may fancy that Tom was quite good, when he had everything that he could want or wish:  but you would be very much mistaken. Being quite comfortable is a very good thing; but it does not make people good.  Indeed, it sometimes makes them naughty, as it has made the people in America; and as it made the people in the Bible, who waxed fat and kicked, like horses overfed and underworked.  And I am very sorry to say that this happened to little Tom.  For he grew so fond of the sea-bullseyes and sea-lollipops that his foolish little head could think of nothing else:  and he was always longing for more, and wondering when the strange lady would come again and give him some, and what she would give him, and how much, and whether she would give him more than the others.  And he thought of nothing but lollipops by day, and dreamt of nothing else by night--and what happened then?",fancy good have want wish mistaken comfortable good thing make person good make naughty make person make person wax fat kick horse overf underwork sorry say happen little grow fond sea bullseye sea lollipop foolish little head think else long more wonder strange lady come give give much give more other think lollipop day dreamt else night happen 
9,"That he began to watch the lady to see where she kept the sweet things:  and began hiding, and sneaking, and following her about, and pretending to be looking the other way, or going after something else, till he found out that she kept them in a beautiful mother-of-pearl cabinet away in a deep crack of the rocks.",begin watch lady see keep sweet thing begin hide sneak follow pretend look other way go else find keep beautiful mother pearl cabinet deep crack rock 
10,"And he longed to go to the cabinet, and yet he was afraid; and then he longed again, and was less afraid; and at last, by continual thinking about it, he longed so violently that he was not afraid at all.  And one night, when all the other children were asleep, and he could not sleep for thinking of lollipops, he crept away among the rocks, and got to the cabinet, and behold! it was open.",long go cabinet afraid long afraid last continual think long afraid night other child asleep sleep think lollipop creep rock get cabinet behold open 
11,"But, when he saw all the nice things inside, instead of being delighted, he was quite frightened, and wished he had never come there.  And then he would only touch them, and he did; and then he would only taste one, and he did; and then he would only eat one, and he did; and then he would only eat two, and then three, and so on; and then he was terrified lest she should come and catch him, and began gobbling them down so fast that he did not taste them, or have any pleasure in them; and then he felt sick, and would have only one more; and then only one more again; and so on till he had eaten them all up.",see nice thing delight frighten wish come touch taste eat eat terrified come catch begin gobble taste have pleasure feel sick have more eat 
12,"And all the while, close behind him, stood Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid.",while close stand 
13,"Some people may say, But why did she not keep her cupboard locked? Well, I know.--It may seem a very strange thing, but she never does keep her cupboard locked; every one may go and taste for themselves, and fare accordingly.  It is very odd, but so it is; and I am quite sure that she knows best.  Perhaps she wishes people to keep their fingers out of the fire, by having them burned.",person say keep cupboard lock know seem strange thing keep cupboard lock one go taste fare odd sure know good wish person keep finger fire have burn 
14,"She took off her spectacles, because she did not like to see too much; and in her pity she arched up her eyebrows into her very hair, and her eyes grew so wide that they would have taken in all the sorrows of the world, and filled with great big tears, as they too often do.",take spectacle like see much pity arched eyebrow very hair eye grow wide take sorrow world fill great big tear do 
15,But all she said was:,say 
16,"""Ah, you poor little dear! you are just like all the rest.""",poor little dear rest 
17,"But she said it to herself, and Tom neither heard nor saw her. Now, you must not fancy that she was sentimental at all.  If you do, and think that she is going to let off you, or me, or any human being when we do wrong, because she is too tender-hearted to punish us, then you will find yourself very much mistaken, as many a man does every year and every day.",say hear see fancy sentimental think go let human being do wrong tender hearted punish find mistaken many man do year day 
18,But what did the strange fairy do when she saw all her lollipops eaten?,strange fairy do see lollipop eat 
19,"Did she fly at Tom, catch him by the scruff of the neck, hold him, howk him, hump him, hurry him, hit him, poke him, pull him, pinch him, pound him, put him in the corner, shake him, slap him, set him on a cold stone to reconsider himself, and so forth?",fly catch scruff neck hold howk hump hurry hit poke pull pinch pound put corner shake slap set cold stone reconsider 
20,"Not a bit.  You may watch her at work if you know where to find her.  But you will never see her do that.  For, if she had, she knew quite well Tom would have fought, and kicked, and bit, and said bad words, and turned again that moment into a naughty little heathen chimney-sweep, with his hand, like Ishmael's of old, against every man, and every man's hand against him.",bit watch work know find see do have know fight kick bit say bad word turn moment naughty little heathen chimney sweep hand old man man hand 
21,"Did she question him, hurry him, frighten him, threaten him, to make him confess?  Not a bit.  You may see her, as I said, at her work often enough if you know where to look for her:  but you will never see her do that.  For, if she had, she would have tempted him to tell lies in his fright; and that would have been worse for him, if possible, than even becoming a heathen chimney-sweep again.",question hurry frighten threaten make confess bit see say work know look see do have tempt tell lie fright bad possible become heathen chimney sweep 
22,"No.  She leaves that for anxious parents and teachers (lazy ones, some call them), who, instead of giving children a fair trial, such as they would expect and demand for themselves, force them by fright to confess their own faults--which is so cruel and unfair that no judge on the bench dare do it to the wickedest thief or murderer, for the good British law forbids it--ay, and even punish them to make them confess, which is so detestable a crime that it is never committed now, save by Inquisitors, and Kings of Naples, and a few other wretched people of whom the world is weary.  And then they say, ""We have trained up the child in the way he should go, and when he grew up he has departed from it.  Why then did Solomon say that he would not depart from it?""  But perhaps the way of beating, and hurrying and frightening, and questioning, was not the way that the child should go; for it is not even the way in which a colt should go if you want to break it in and make it a quiet serviceable horse.",leave anxious parent teacher lazy one call give child fair trial such expect demand force fright confess own fault cruel unfair judge bench do wickedest thief murderer good british law forbid punish make confess detestable crime commit save inquisitor few other wretched person world weary say train child way go grow depart say depart way beat hurry frightening question way child go way colt go want break make quiet serviceable horse 
23,"Some folks may say, ""Ah! but the Fairy does not need to do that if she knows everything already.""  True.  But, if she did not know, she would not surely behave worse than a British judge and jury; and no more should parents and teachers either.",folk say need do know true know behave bad british judge jury more parent teacher 
24,"So she just said nothing at all about the matter, not even when Tom came next day with the rest for sweet things.  He was horribly afraid of coming:  but he was still more afraid of staying away, lest any one should suspect him.  He was dreadfully afraid, too, lest there should be no sweets--as was to be expected, he having eaten them all--and lest then the fairy should inquire who had taken them.  But, behold! she pulled out just as many as ever, which astonished Tom, and frightened him still more.",say matter come next day rest sweet thing afraid come afraid stay one suspect afraid sweet expect eat fairy inquire take pull many astonished frighten more 
25,"And, when the fairy looked him full in the face, he shook from head to foot:  however she gave him his share like the rest, and he thought within himself that she could not have found him out.",fairy look full face shake head foot give share rest think find 
26,"But, when he put the sweets into his mouth, he hated the taste of them; and they made him so sick that he had to get away as fast as he could; and terribly sick he was, and very cross and unhappy, all the week after.",put sweet mouth hate taste make sick have get sick cross unhappy week

31,"Which was quite natural; for you must know and believe that people's souls make their bodies just as a snail makes its shell (I am not joking, my little man; I am in serious, solemn earnest). And therefore, when Tom's soul grew all prickly with naughty tempers, his body could not help growing prickly, too, so that nobody would cuddle him, or play with him, or even like to look at him.",natural know believe person soul make body snail make shell joke little man serious solemn earnest soul grow prickly naughty temper body help grow prickly cuddle play like look

33,"And he was so miserable all that week that when the ugly fairy came and looked at him once more full in the face, more seriously and sadly than ever, he could stand it no longer, and thrust the sweetmeats away, saying, ""No, I don't want any:  I can't bear them now,"" and then burst out crying, poor little man, and told Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid every word as it happened.",miserable week ugly fairy come look full face stand thrust sweetmeat say want bear burst cry poor little man tell word happen 
34,"He was horribly frightened when he had done so; for he expected her to punish him very severely.  But, instead, she only took him up and kissed him, which was not quite pleasant, for her chin was very bristly indeed; but he was so lonely-hearted, he thought that rough kissing was better than none.",frighten do expect punish take kiss pleasant chin lonely hearted think rough kissing good

40,"Tom was frightened at the notion of a school-mistress; for he thought she would certainly come with a birch-rod or a cane; but he comforted himself, at last, that she might be something like the old woman in Vendale--which she was not in the least; for, when the fairy brought her, she was the most beautiful little girl that ever was seen, with long curls floating behind her like a golden cloud, and long robes floating all round her like a silver one.",frighten notion school mistress think come birch rod cane comfort last old woman least fairy bring beautiful little girl see long curl float golden cloud long robe float silver one 
41,"""There he is,"" said the fairy; ""and you must teach him to be good, whether you like or not.""",say fairy teach good like 
42,"""I know,"" said the little girl; but she did not seem quite to like, for she put her finger in her mouth, and looked at Tom under her brows; and Tom put his finger in his mouth, and looked at her under his brows, for he was horribly ashamed of himself.",know say little girl seem put finger mouth look brow put finger mouth look brow ashamed 
43,"The little girl seemed hardly to know how to begin; and perhaps she would never have begun at all if poor Tom had not burst out crying, and begged her to teach him to be good and help him to cure his prickles; and at that she grew so tender-hearted that she began teaching him as prettily as ever child was taught in the world.",little girl seem know begin begin poor burst cry begg teach good help cure prickle grow tender hearted begin teach child teach world 
44,"And what did the little girl teach Tom?  She taught him, first, what you have been taught ever since you said your first prayers at your mother's knees; but she taught him much more simply.  For the lessons in that world, my child, have no such hard words in them as the lessons in this, and therefore the water-babies like them better than you like your lessons, and long to learn them more and more; and grown men cannot puzzle nor quarrel over their meaning, as they do here on land; for those lessons all rise clear and pure, like the Test out of Overton Pool, out of the everlasting ground of all life and truth.",little girl teach teach teach say first prayer mother knee teach lesson world child have such hard word lesson water baby like good like lesson learn more more grow man puzzle quarrel meaning do land lesson rise clear pure test everlasting ground life truth

48,"And then they began telling each other all their story--how he had got into the water, and she had fallen over the rock; and how he had swum down to the sea, and how she had flown out of the window; and how this, that, and the other, till it was all talked out:  and then they both began over again, and I can't say which of the two talked fastest.",begin tell other story get water fall rock swum sea fly window other talk begin say talk fast

53,"Ah! that is just what she could not say.  And it is strange, but true, that no one can say; and that those who have been oftenest in it, or even nearest to it, can say least about it, and make people understand least what it is like.  There are a good many folks about the Other-end-of-Nowhere (where Tom went afterwards), who pretend to know it from north to south as well as if they had been penny postmen there; but, as they are safe at the Other-end-of- Nowhere, nine hundred and ninety-nine million miles away, what they say cannot concern us.",say strange true say oftenest near say least make person understand least be good many folk other end go pretend know south penny postmen safe other end mile say concern

70,"Tom was very unhappy at that.  And, when Ellie went home on Sunday, he fretted and cried all day, and did not care to listen to the fairy's stories about good children, though they were prettier than ever.  Indeed, the more he overheard of them, the less he liked to listen, because they were all about children who did what they did not like, and took trouble for other people, and worked to feed their little brothers and sisters instead of caring only for their play.  And, when she began to tell a story about a holy child in old times, who was martyred by the heathen because it would not worship idols, Tom could bear no more, and ran away and hid among the rocks.",unhappy go fret cry day care listen fairy story good child pretty overhear less like listen child do like take trouble other person work feed little brother sister care play begin tell story holy child old time martyr heathen worship idol bear more run hide rock

And then he grew quite cross with her, because she was superior to him, and did what he could not do.  And poor Ellie was quite surprised and sad; and at last Tom burst out crying; but he would not tell her what was really in his mind.",come shy fancy look think coward grow cross superior do do poor surprised sad last burst cry tell mind 
72,"And all the while he was eaten up with curiosity to know where Ellie went to; so that he began not to care for his playmates, or for the sea-palace or anything else.  But perhaps that made matters all the easier for him; for he grew so discontented with everything round him that he did not care to stay, and did not care where he went.",eat curiosity know go begin care playmate sea palace else make matter easy grow discontent care stay care go

He shouted after her, but she did not answer; he asked all the other children, but they had not seen her; and at last he went up to the top of the water and began crying and screaming for Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid--which perhaps was the best thing to do--for she came in a moment.",frighten swim rock hall chamber fast swim find shout answer ask other child see last go top water begin cry scream good thing do come moment

It may have been so; but it is considered right in the new philosophy, you know, to give spiritual causes for physical phenomena--especially in parlour-tables; and, of course, physical causes for spiritual ones, like thinking, and praying, and knowing right from wrong.

And then she told him how he had been in the nursery long enough, and must go out now and see the world, if he intended ever to be a man; and how he must go all alone by himself, as every one else that ever was born has to go, and see with his own eyes, and smell with his own nose, and make his own bed and lie on it, and burn his own fingers if he put them into the fire.  And then she told him how many fine things there were to be seen in the world, and what an odd, curious, pleasant, orderly, respectable, well-managed, and, on the whole, successful (as, indeed, might have been expected) sort of a place it was, if people would only be tolerably brave and honest and good in it; and then she told him not to be afraid of anything he met, for nothing would harm him if he remembered all his lessons, and did what he knew was right.

But they did not like to face facts, my dears, as very few people do; and so they invented a cock-and-bull story, which, I am sure, I never told them, that the smoke was the breath of a giant, whom some gods or other had buried under the mountain; and that the cinders were what the dwarfs roasted the little pigs whole with; and other nonsense of that kind.

And they were few in number:  but they only said, The more the merrier, but the fewer the better fare. However, that was not quite true; for all the flapdoodle-trees were killed by the volcano, and they had eaten all the roast pigs, who, of course, could not be expected to have little ones.  So they had to live very hard, on nuts and roots which they scratched out of the ground with sticks.  Some of them talked of sowing corn, as their ancestors used to do, before they came into the land of Readymade; but they had forgotten how to make ploughs (they had forgotten even how to make Jews' harps by this time), and had eaten all the seed-corn which they brought out of the land of Hardwork years since; and of course it was too much trouble to go away and find more.

Beside, they are grown so fierce and suspicious and brutal that they keep out of each other's way, and mope and sulk in the dark forests, never hearing each other's voice, till they have forgotten almost what speech is like.
