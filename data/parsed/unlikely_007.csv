4,"It does not look very hard, perhaps, to you who have studied ardently for years at a Board School, or a High School, or a Preparatory School for the sons of gentlemen; but to Edwin it looked as hard as a ship’s biscuit. But he went for it like a man, and presently produced an Answer and his Master wrote a big curly R across the sum. Perhaps you do not know that a big curly R means Right? As for the answer to the sum, I will try to get a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge (who is a very terrible person), to work it out for you, and if he can do it I will put the answer at the end of this story. I cannot work it myself.",look hard study year high preparatory son gentleman look ship biscuit go man produce answer master write big curly r sum know big curly r mean right answer sum try get terrible person work do put answer end story work

If you put seeds in the garden they come up flowers, unless they’re rotten seeds or you forget where you put them. And if you buy a rabbit—well, there it is, unless it dies. And if you eat your dinner—well, you’re not hungry any more for an hour or two. But lessons!”",use say else lead else lesson put seed garden come flower rotten seed forget put buy rabbit die eat dinner hungry more hour lesson

For it was the light of pure reason, and it glowed from the glorious eyes of the Arithmetic Fairy. You did not know that there was an Arithmetic Fairy?

29,"A new example was set. And, curiously enough, white rabbits were in it.",new example set white rabbit

32,"The whole of the front garden, as well as most of the back garden, was a seething mass of white rabbits. Seven thousand five hundred and sixty-three there were, to be exact. I alone know this. The joyous Edwin and his distracted parents were never able to count them.",whole front garden most back garden seethe mass white rabbit exact know joyous distract parent able count 
33,"“What a lot of hutches we shall want,” Edwin thought gaily. But when his father came home from the Stock Exchange, where he spent his days in considering 7⅝ and 10-3/32—no doubt under the direct guidance of the Arithmetic Fairy, he said at once—",lot hutch want think father come spend day consider ⅝ doubt direct guidance arithmetic say

39,"Edwin went to bed, feeling now quite sure that he had _not_ dreamed the Arithmetic Fairy, and anxiously wondering what to-morrow’s sums would be about. Not, he trusted, about snakes, or Sunday School teachers.",go bed feel sure dream arithmetic wonder sum trust snake teacher 
40,"The next day’s sum was about oranges. Edwin did it correctly, and went home a prey to the most golden apprehensions. Nor were these unfounded. The whole of the dining-room and most of the hall—up to the seventh step of the neatly carpeted stairs, was golden with oranges. Edwin’s father said some severe things about practical jokers, and sent for the greengrocer. Edwin ate nine 3/7th oranges, and went to bed yellow, but not absolutely unhappy.",next day sum orange do go prey golden apprehension unfounded whole dining room most hall seventh step carpet stair golden orange father say severe thing practical joker send greengrocer eat 7th orange go bed yellow unhappy

43,"No one suspected Edwin of having anything to do with these happenings. And indeed, it was not his fault, so how and why could or should he have owned up to it?",suspect have do happening fault own 
44,"I wish I had time to tell you of the events that occurred when Edwin’s sums were set in buttered muffins. Of the seventy-five pigs travelling in a circle at varying rates, I can only say that part of this circle ran through Edwin’s mother’s drawing-room. Nor can I here relate the tale of the three hundred lightning conductors which were suddenly found to be attached to the once happy villa-home. Edwin’s mother cried all day when she was not laughing, and people came from far and near to see the haunted house. For when it came to four thousand white owls and a church steeple every one felt that it was more than a mere accident.",wish have time tell event occur sum set butter muffin pig travel circle vary rate say part circle run mother draw room relate tale lightning conductor find attach happy villa home mother cry day laugh person come see haunted house come white owl church steeple one feel more mere accident 
45,"Edwin’s master had a pretty taste in sums, and about once a term he used to set a sum about canes. Edwin worked that sum wrong on purpose, so I suppose it served him right that the canes should be at home before he was, just as they would have been if he had worked the sum properly, and as he had borrowed his father’s razor that morning to sharpen a slate-pencil, the fifty-seven canes were not all thrown away.",master have pretty taste sum term use set sum cane work sum wrong purpose suppose serve right cane home work sum borrow father razor morning sharp slate pencil cane throw 
46,"But it was the sum about the cistern that convinced Edwin of the desperate need of finding the Arithmetic Fairy, and begging her to take back the present she had made him. It is not polite to ask this, but Edwin had to do it. You see in the sum the cistern had to leak three pints in thirteen minutes and a quarter, but the cistern at home happened to have a little leak of its own already, where Edwin had tried his new drill on it, and the two leaks together managed so well that when Edwin got home he found water dripping from all the top bedroom ceilings and the staircase was a sort of Niagara. It was very exciting—but when the plumber came he let Edwin’s father know all about the little drilled hole, and Edwin got the credit of the leak in the sum, which was much larger and most unfair. His father spoke to Edwin about this matter in his study, and it was then that Edwin saw that he must put an end to the sums that came true.",sum cistern convince desperate need find arithmetic begg take present make polite ask have do see sum cistern have leak pint minute quarter cistern home happen have little leak own try new drill leak manage get find water drip top bedroom ceiling staircase sort exciting plumber come let father know little drill hole get credit leak sum large unfair father speak matter study see put end sum come true 
47,"So he went up to his bedroom with his candle and his arithmetic book. Directly he put the candle on the chest of drawers a big splash of water from the ceiling fell right on the flame and it went out. He had to go right down stairs to get another light. Then he put the candle on the dressing table—splash—out it went. Chair. Splash! Out! At last he got the candle to stay alight on the washhand-stand, which was, by some curious accident, the only dry place in the room.",go bedroom candle arithmetic book put candle chest drawer big splash water ceiling fall flame go have go stair get light put candle dress table splash go splash last get candle stay alight washhand stand curious accident only dry place room 
48,"Then he opened his book. Somewhere in the book he knew there must be something that would fetch the fairy. He said the Multiplication Table up to nine times-after that, as you know, the worst is over. But no fairy appeared.",open book book know be fetch fairy say multiplication table time know bad fairy appear

50,Then he called to the Fairy—but she did not come.,call come 
51,Then he tried counting. Then counting and calling mixed with other things. Like this:,try count count call mix other thing 
52,"“Oh, good Fairy! One-two-three-four-five-six-seven; do come and help me! Eight-nine-ten-eleven! Beautiful, dear, kind, lovely fairy! Nine nines are eighty-one! Dear fairy, do come! Seven million two hundred thousand six hundred and fifty-nine! I will always love you if you will come to me now. Three-sevenths of five-ninths of five-twelfths of sixteen-fiftieths. You were so kind the other day. Two and two are four, and three are seven! Do come now—you’ve no idea what an awful mess you’ve got me into.

53,"Edwin stopped, out of breath. He looked round him for the Fairy. But his room, with the water dripping from the roof and the wet towels and basins on the floor, was not a fairy-like place. Edwin saw, with a sigh, that it was no go.",stop breath look room water drip roof wet towel basin floor fairy like place see sigh go

55,The Mathematical Master was pleased with himself that day because he had succeeded in preventing his best boy from yielding to the allurements of the Head-master and the Classical side.,mathematical pleased day succeed prevent good boy yield allurement master classical side 
56,Of course his class knew at once what kind of temper the Mathematical Master was in—you know we always know that—and Edwin ventured to ask that the examples that day might be about a model steam engine.,course class know kind temper mathematical master know know venture ask example day model steam engine 
57,"“Only _one_, sir, please,” he was careful to explain. The Master kindly consented, and by great good fortune the example did not deal with a faulty boiler, nor with any other defect—but concerned itself solely with the model engine’s speed. So Edwin knew, when he had worked his sum, exactly what pace the model engine he would find at home would be good for. He worked the sum right.",sir careful explain master consent great good fortune example deal faulty boiler other defect concern model engine speed know work sum pace model engine find home good work sum 
58,Then he put his head into his desk and began again.,put head desk begin 
59,"“Oh, good Fairy, if a sum of £4,700 is to be divided between A, B, and C,—do, do come and help me. Three-tenths of a pound is six shillings, dear Fairy—eleven—twelve—thirteen—fourteen—oh, lovely Fairy—” and so on.",good sum divide a b do come help tenth pound shilling dear lovely fairy

61,“What are you chunnering about?” and stuck a pin into Edwin’s leg. “Can’t you do the beastly example?”,chunner stick pin leg do beastly example

64,"When he had worked it the answer was one. Very quickly he opened his desk again, and there was the Arithmetic Fairy, looking more lovely than ever in a rich gown of indices, lined with surds, that fell to her feet in osculating curves. In her hand, like a sceptre, shone the starry glory of the binomial theorem. But her eyes were starrier still. She smiled, but her first words were severe.",work answer open desk be arithmetic look lovely rich gown index line surd fall foot osculate curve hand sceptre shine starry glory binomial theorem eye starry smile first word severe 
65,"“You careless boy,” she said. “Why can’t you learn to be accurate? It’s the merest chance you got me. You should have stated your problem more clearly, and you should have said seven thousand _Arithmetic_ Fairies. Why suppose you had found one fairy in your desk, and it had been the Grammar Fairy, or the Football Fairy—what would you have done then?”",careless boy say learn accurate merest chance get state problem say suppose find fairy desk do
