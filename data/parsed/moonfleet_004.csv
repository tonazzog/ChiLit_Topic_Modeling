1,CHAPTER 4. IN THE VAULT,chapter vault 
2,Let us hob and nob with Death--_Tennyson_,let hob nob 
3," Though nothing of the vault except the roof was visible from where I lay, and so I could not see these visitors, yet I heard every word spoken, and soon made out one voice as being Master Ratsey's. This discovery gave me no surprise but much solace, for I thought that if the worst happened and I was discovered, I should find one friend with whom I could plead for life.",vault roof visible lay see visitor hear word speak make voice discovery give surprise much solace think bad happen discover find friend plead life 
4,"'It is well the earth gave way', the sexton was saying, 'on a night when we were here to find it. I was in the graveyard myself after midday, and all was snug and tight then. 'Twould have been awkward enough to have the hole stand open through the day, for any passer-by to light on.'",earth give way say night find graveyard midday snug tight awkward have hole stand open day passer light 
5,"There were four or five men in the vault already, and I could hear more coming down the passage, and guessed from their heavy footsteps that they were carrying burdens. There was a sound, too, of dumping kegs down on the ground, with a swish of liquor inside them, and then the noise of casks being moved.",be man vault hear more come passage guess heavy footstep carry burden be sound dump keg ground swish liquor noise cask move 
6,"'I thought we should have a fall there ere long,' Ratsey went on, 'what with this drought parching the ground, and the trampling at the edge when we move out the side stone to get in, but there is no mischief done beyond what can be easily made good. A gravestone or two and a few spades of earth will make all sound again. Leave that to me.'",think have fall go drought parch ground trampling edge move side stone get be mischief do make good gravestone few spade earth make sound leave 
7,"'Be careful what you do,' rejoined another man's voice that I did not know, 'lest someone see you digging, and scent us out.'",careful do rejoin man voice know see digg scent 
8,"'Make your mind easy,' Ratsey said; 'I have dug too often in this graveyard for any to wonder if they see me with a spade.'",make mind easy say dig graveyard wonder see spade 
9,"Then the conversation broke off, and there was little more talking, only a noise of men going backwards and forwards, and of putting down of kegs and the hollow gurgle of good liquor being poured from breakers into the casks. By and by fumes of brandy began to fill the air, and climb to where I lay, overcoming the mouldy smell of decayed wood and the dampness of the green walls. It may have been that these fumes mounted to my head, and gave me courage not my own, but so it was that I lost something of the stifling fear that had gripped me, and could listen with more ease to what was going forward. There was a pause in the carrying to and fro; they were talking again now, and someone said--",conversation break be little more talking noise man go forward put keg hollow gurgle good liquor pour breaker cask fume brandy begin fill air climb lay overcome mouldy smell decay wood dampness green wall fume mount head give courage own lose stifling fear grip listen more ease go be pause carry for talk say 
10,"'I was in Dorchester three days ago, and heard men say it will go hard with the poor chaps who had the brush with the _Elector_ last summer. Judge Barentyne comes on Assize next week, and that old fox Maskew has driven down to Taunton to get at him before and coach him back; making out to him that the Law's arm is weak in these parts against the contraband, and must be strengthened by some wholesome hangings.'",day hear man say go poor chap have brush last summer come next week old drive get coach make arm weak part contraband strengthen wholesome hanging 
11,"'They are a cruel pair,' another put in, 'and we shall have new gibbets on Ridgedown for leading lights. Once I get even with Maskew, the other may go hang, ay, and they may hang me too.'",cruel pair put have new gibbet lead light get other go hang hang 
12,"'The Devil send him to meet me one dark night on the down alone,' said someone else, 'and I will give him a pistol's mouth to look down, and spoil his face for him.'",send meet dark night say else give pistol mouth look spoil face 
13,"'No, thou wilt not,' said a deep voice, and then I knew that Elzevir was there too; 'none shall lay hand on Maskew but I. So mark that, lad, that when his day of reckoning comes, 'tis _I_ will reckon with him.'",say deep voice know lay hand mark day reckoning come reckon 
14,"Then for a few minutes I did not pay much heed to what was said, being terribly straitened for room, and cramped with pain from lying so long in one place. The thick smoke from the pitch torches too came curling across the roof and down upon me, making me sick and giddy with its evil smell and taste; and though all was very dim, I could see my hands were black with oily smuts. At last I was able to wriggle myself over without making too much noise, and felt a great relief in changing sides, but gave such a start as made the coffin creak again at hearing my own name.",few minute pay much heed say straiten room cramped pain lie place thick smoke pitch torche come curl roof make sick giddy evil smell taste dim see hand black oily smut last able wriggle make much noise feel great relief change side give start make coffin creak hear own name 
15,"'There is a boy of Trenchard's,' said a voice that I thought was Parmiter's, who lived at the bottom of the village--'there is a boy of Trenchard's that I mistrust; he is for ever wandering in the graveyard, and I have seen him a score of times sitting on this tomb and looking out to sea. This very night, when the wind fell at sundown, and we were hung up with sails flapping, three miles out, and waited for the dark to get the sweeps, I took my glass to scan the coast-line, and lo, here on the tomb-top sits Master Trenchard. I could not see his face, but knew him by his cut, and fear the boy sits there to play the spy and then tells Maskew.'",be boy say voice think live bottom village be boy mistrust wonder graveyard see score time sit tomb look sea very night wind fall sundown hang sail flap mile wait dark get sweep take glass scan coast line tomb top sit see face know cut fear boy sit play spy tell 
16,"'You're right,' said Greening of Ringstave, for I knew his slow drawl; 'and many a time when I have sat in The Wood, and watched the Manor to see Maskew safe at home before we ran a cargo, I have seen this boy too go round about the place with a hangdog look, scanning the house as if his life depended on't.'",right say know slow drawl many time sit watch see safe home run cargo see boy go place hangdog look scan house life depend 
17,"'Twas very true what Greening said; for of a summer evening I would take the path that led up Weatherbeech Hill, behind the Manor; both because 'twas a walk that had a good prospect in itself, and also a sweet charm for me, namely, the hope of seeing Grace Maskew. And there I often sat upon the stile that ends the path and opens on the down, and watched the old half-ruined house below; and sometimes saw white-frocked Gracie walking on the terrace in the evening sun, and sometimes in returning passed her window near enough to wave a greeting. And once, when she had the fever, and Dr. Hawkins came twice a day to see her, I had no heart for school, but sat on that stile the livelong day, looking at the gabled house where she was lying ill. And Mr. Glennie never rated me for playing truant, nor told Aunt Jane, guessing, as I thought afterwards, the cause, and having once been young himself. 'Twas but boy's love, yet serious for me; and on the day she lay near death, I made so bold as to stop Dr. Hawkins on his horse and ask him how she did; and he bearing with me for the eagerness that he read in my face, bent down over his saddle and smiled, and said my playmate would come back to me again.",twa true say summer evening take path lead twat walk have good prospect sweet charm hope see sit stile end path open down watch old half ruin house see white frock walk terrace evening sun return pass window wave greeting have fever come day see have heart school sit stile livelong day look gabl house lie ill rate play truant tell guess think cause young boy love serious day lay death make bold stop horse ask bear eagerness read face bend saddle smile say playmate come 
18,"So it was quite true that I had watched the house, but not as a spy, and would not have borne tales to old Maskew for anything that could be offered. Then Ratsey spoke up for me and said--''Tis a false scent. The boy is well enough, and simple, and has told me many a time he seeks the churchyard because there is a fine view to be had there of the sea, and 'tis the sea he loves. A month ago, when the high tide set, and this vault was so full of water that we could not get in, I came with Elzevir to make out if the floods were going down inside, or what eddy 'twas that set the casks tapping one against another. So as I lay on the ground with my ear glued close against the wall, who should march round the church but John Trenchard, Esquire, not treading delicately like King Agag, or spying, but just come on a voyage of discovery for himself. For in the church on Sunday, when we heard the tapping in the vault below, my young gentleman was scared enough; but afterwards, being told by Parson Glennie--who should know better--that such noises were not made by ghosts, but by the Mohunes at sea in their coffins, he plucks up heart, and comes down on the Monday to see if they are still afloat. So there he caught me lying like a zany on the ground. You may guess I stood at attention soon enough, but told him I was looking at the founds to see if they wanted underpinning from the floods. And so I set his mind at ease, for 'tis a simple child, and packed him off to get my dubbing hammer. And I think the boy will not be here so often now to frighten honest Parmiter, for I have weaved him some pretty tales of Blackbeard, and he has a wholesome scare of meeting the Colonel. But after dark I pledge my life that neither he nor any other in the town would pass the churchyard wall, no, not for a thousand pounds.'",true watch house spy borne tale old offer speak say tis false scent boy enough simple tell time seek churchyard be fine view have sea tis sea love month high tide set vault full water get come make flood go eddy twa set cask tap lay ground ear glue wall march church tread spying come voyage discovery church hear tapping vault young gentleman scared tell know good such noise make ghost sea coffin pluck heart come see afloat catch lie zany ground guess stand attention tell look find see want underpin flood set mind ease simple child pack get dubbing hammer think boy frighten honest weave pretty tale have wholesome scare meet dark pledge life other town pass churchyard wall pound 
19,"I heard him chuckling to himself, and the others laughed loudly too, when he was telling how he palmed me off; but 'he laughs loudest who laughs last', thought I, and should have chuckled too, were it not for making the coffin creak. And then, to my surprise, Elzevir spoke: 'The lad is a brave lad; I would he were my son. He is David's age, and will make a good sailor later on.'",hear chuckle other laugh tell palm laugh loudest laugh last think chuckle make coffin creak surprise speak lad brave lad son age make good sailor 
20,"They were simple words, yet pleasing to me; for Elzevir spoke as if he meant them, and I had got to like him a little in spite of all his grimness; and beside that, was sorry for his grief over his son. I was so moved by what he said, that for a moment I was for jumping up and calling out to him that I lay here and liked him well, but then thought better of it, and so kept still.",simple word pleasing speak mean get like little spite grimness sorry grief son move say moment jump call lay like think good keep 
21,"The carrying was over, and I fancy they were all sitting on the ends of kegs or leaning up against the pile; but could not see, and was still much troubled with the torch smoke, though now and then I caught through it a whiff of tobacco, which showed that some were smoking.",carry fancy sit end keg lean pile see trouble torch smoke catch whiff tobacco show smoke 
22,"Then Greening, who had a singing voice for all his drawl, struck up with--",have sing voice drawl strike 
23,"Says the Cap'n to the crew, We have slipt the revenue,",say crew slipt revenue 
24,"but Ratsey stopped him with a sharp 'No more of that; the words aren't to our taste tonight, but come as wry as if the parson called _Old Hundred_ and I tuned up with _Veni_.' I knew he meant the last verse with a hanging touch in it; but Greening was for going on with the song, until some others broke in too, and he saw that the company would have none of it.",stop sharp more word taste tonight come wry parson call old tune know mean last verse hanging touch go song other break see company have 
25,"'Not but what the labourer is worthy of his hire,' went on Master Ratsey; 'so spile that little breaker of Schiedam, and send a rummer round to keep off midnight chills.'",labourer worthy hire go spile little breaker send rummer keep midnight chill 
26,"He loved a glass of the good liquor well, and with him 'twas always the same reasoning, namely, to keep off chills; though he chopped the words to suit the season, and now 'twas autumn, now winter, now spring, or summer chills.",love glass good liquor same reasoning keep chill choppe word suit season autumn winter spring summer chill 
27,"They must have found glasses, though I could not remember to have seen any in the vault, for a minute later fugleman Ratsey spoke again--",find glasses remember see vault minute speak 
28,"'Now, lads, glasses full and bumpers for a toast. And here's to Blackbeard, to Father Blackbeard, who watches over our treasure better than he did over his own; for were it not the fear of him that keeps off idle feet and prying eyes, we should have the gaugers in, and our store ransacked twenty times.'",lad glasses full bumper toast watch treasure good do own fear keep idle foot pry eye have gauger store ransack time 
29,"So he spoke, and it seemed there was a little halting at first, as of men not liking to take Blackbeard's name in Blackbeard's place, or raise the Devil by mocking at him. But then some of the bolder shouted 'Blackbeard', and so the more timid chimed in, and in a minute there were a score of voices calling 'Blackbeard, Blackbeard', till the place rang again.",speak seem be little halting first man like take name place raise mocking bold shout timid chime minute be score voice call place ring 
30,"Then Elzevir cried out angrily, 'Silence. Are you mad, or has the liquor mastered you? Are you Revenue-men that you dare shout and roister? or contrabandiers with the lugger in the offing, and your life in your hand. You make noise enough to wake folk in Moonfleet from their beds.'",cry silence mad liquor master revenue man dare shout roister contrabandier lugger offing life hand make noise wake folk bed 
31,"'Tut, man,' retorted Ratsey testily, 'and if they waked, they would but pull the blankets tight about their ears, and say 'twas Blackbeard piping his crew of lost Mohunes to help him dig for treasure.'",retort wake pull blanket tight ear say pipe crew lose help dig treasure 
32,"Yet for all that 'twas plain that Block ruled the roost, for there was silence for a minute, and then one said, 'Ay, Master Elzevir is right; let us away, the night is far spent, and we have nothing but the sweeps to take the lugger out of sight by dawn.'",twa plain block rule roost be silence minute say right let night spend have sweep take lugger sight dawn 
33,"So the meeting broke up, and the torchlight grew dimmer, and died away as it had come in a red flicker on the roof, and the footsteps sounded fainter as they went up the passage, until the vault was left to the dead men and me. Yet for a very long time--it seemed hours--after all had gone I could hear a murmur of distant voices, and knew that some were talking at the end of the passage, and perhaps considering how the landslip might best be restored. So while I heard them thus conversing I dared not descend from my perch, lest someone might turn back to the vault, though I was glad enough to sit up, and ease my aching back and limbs. Yet in the awful blackness of the place even the echo of these human voices seemed a kindly and blessed thing, and a certain shrinking loneliness fell on me when they ceased at last and all was silent. Then I resolved I would be off at once, and get back to the moonlight bed that I had left hours ago, having no stomach for more treasure-hunting, and being glad indeed to be still left with the treasure of life.",meeting break torchlight grow dimmer die come red flicker roof footstep sound fainter go passage vault leave dead man long time seem hour go hear murmur distant voice know talk end passage consider landslip restore hear convers descend perch turn vault glad sit ease aching back limb awful blackness place echo human voice seem kindly bless thing certain shrink loneliness fall cease last silent resolve get moonlight bed leave hour have stomach more treasure hunting glad leave treasure life 
34,"Thus, sitting where I was, I lit my candle once more, and then clambered across that great coffin which, for two hours or more, had been a mid-wall of partition between me and danger. But to get out of the niche was harder than to get in; for now that I had a candle to light me, I saw that the coffin, though sound enough to outer view, was wormed through and through, and little better than a rotten shell. So it was that I had some ado to get over it, not daring either to kneel upon it or to bring much weight to bear with my hand, lest it should go through. And now having got safely across, I sat for an instant on that narrow ledge of the stone shelf which projected beyond the coffin on the vault side, and made ready to jump forward on to the floor below. And how it happened I know not, but there I lost my balance, and as I slipped the candle flew out of my grasp. Then I clutched at the coffin to save myself, but my hand went clean through it, and so I came to the ground in a cloud of dust and splinters; having only got hold of a wisp of seaweed, or a handful of those draggled funeral trappings which were strewn about this place. The floor of the vault was sandy; and so, though I fell crookedly, I took but little harm beyond a shaking; and soon, pulling myself together, set to strike my flint and blow the match into a flame to search for the fallen candle. Yet all the time I kept in my fingers this handful of light stuff; and when the flame burnt up again I held the thing against the light, and saw that it was no wisp of seaweed, but something black and wiry. For a moment, I could not gather what I had hold of, but then gave a start that nearly sent the candle out, and perhaps a cry, and let it drop as if it were red-hot iron, for I knew that it was a man's beard.",sit light candle more clamber great coffin hour more mid -wall partition danger get niche hard get have candle light see coffin sound outer view worm little good rotten shell have ado get dare kneel bring much weight bear hand go get sit instant narrow ledge stone shelf project coffin vault side make ready jump floor happen know lose balance slip candle fly grasp clutch coffin save hand go clean come ground cloud dust splinter get hold wisp seaweed handful draggle funeral trapping strewn place floor vault sandy fall take little harm shaking pull set strike flint blow match flame search fall candle time keep finger handful light stuff flame burn hold thing light see wisp seaweed black wiry moment gather hold give start send candle cry let drop red hot iron know man beard 
35,"Now when I saw that, I felt a sort of throttling fright, as though one had caught hold of my heartstrings; and so many and such strange thoughts rose in me, that the blood went pounding round and round in my head, as it did once afterwards when I was fighting with the sea and near drowned. Surely to have in hand the beard of any dead man in any place was bad enough, but worse a thousand times in such a place as this, and to know on whose face it had grown. For, almost before I fully saw what it was, I knew it was that black beard which had given Colonel John Mohune his nickname, and this was his great coffin I had hid behind.",see feel sort throttling fright catch hold heartstring many such strange thought rise blood go pound head fight sea drown have hand beard dead man place bad bad time place know face grow see know black beard give nickname great coffin hide 
36,"I had lain, therefore, all that time, cheek by jowl with Blackbeard himself, with only a thin shell of tinder wood to keep him from me, and now had thrust my hand into his coffin and plucked away his beard. So that if ever wicked men have power to show themselves after death, and still to work evil, one would guess that he would show himself now and fall upon me. Thus a sick dread got hold of me, and had I been a woman or a girl I think I should have swooned; but being only a boy, and not knowing how to swoon, did the next best thing, which was to put myself as far as might be from the beard, and make for the outlet. Yet had I scarce set foot in the passage when I stopped, remembering how once already this same evening I had played the coward, and run home scared with my own fears. So I was brought up for very shame, and beside that thought how I had come to this place to look for Blackbeard's treasure, and might have gone away without knowing even so much as where he lay, had not chance first led me to be down by his side, and afterwards placed my hand upon his beard. And surely this could not be chance alone, but must rather be the finger of Providence guiding me to that which I desired to find. This consideration somewhat restored my courage, and after several feints to return, advances, stoppings, and panics, I was in the vault again, walking carefully round the stack of barrels, and fearing to see the glimmer of the candle fall upon that beard. There it was upon the sand, and holding the candle nearer to it with a certain caution, as though it would spring up and bite me, I saw it was a great full black beard, more than a foot long, but going grey at the tips; and had at the back, keeping it together, a thin tissue of dried skin, like the false parting which Aunt Jane wore under her cap on Sundays. This I could see as it lay before me, for I did not handle or lift it, but only peered into it, with the candle, on all sides, busying myself the while with thoughts of the man of whom it had once been part.",lain time cheek jowl thin shell tinder wood keep thrust hand coffin pluck beard wicked man have power show death work evil guess show fall sick dread get hold woman girl think swoon boy know swoon do next good thing put beard make outlet scarce set foot passage stop remember same evening play coward run scared own fear bring shame think come place look treasure go know much lay chance lead side place hand beard chance alone finger guide desire find consideration restore courage several feint return advance stopping panic vault walk stack barrel fear see glimmer candle fall beard be sand hold candle certain caution spring bite see great full black beard more foot long go grey tip have back keep thin tissue dry skin false parting wear cap see lay handle lift peer candle side busy while thought man part 
37,"In returning to the vault, I had no very sure purpose in mind; only a vague surmise that this finding of Blackbeard's coffin would somehow lead to the finding of his treasure. But as I looked at the beard and pondered, I began to see that if anything was to be done, it must be by searching in the coffin itself, and the clearer this became to me, the greater was my dislike to set about such a task. So I put off the evil hour, by feigning to myself that it was necessary to make a careful scrutiny of the beard, and thus wasted at least ten minutes. But at length, seeing that the candle was burning low, and could certainly last little more than half an hour, and considering that it must now be getting near dawn, I buckled to the distasteful work of rummaging the coffin. Nor had I any need to climb up on to the top shelf again, but standing on the one beneath, found my head and arms well on a level with the search. And beside that, the task was not so difficult as I had thought; for in my fall I had broken off the head-end of the lid, and brought away the whole of that side that faced the vault. Now, any lad of my age, and perhaps some men too, might well have been frightened to set about such a matter as to search in a coffin; and if any had said, a few hours before, that I should ever have courage to do this by night in the Mohune vault, I would not have believed him. Yet here I was, and had advanced along the path of terror so gradually, and as it were foot by foot in the past night, that when I came to this final step I was not near so scared as when I first felt my way into the vault. It was not the first time either that I had looked on death; but had, indeed, always a leaning to such sights and matters, and had seen corpses washed up from the _Darius_ and other wrecks, and besides that had helped Ratsey to case some poor bodies that had died in their beds.",return vault have sure purpose mind vague surmise finding coffin lead finding treasure look beard ponder begin see do search coffin clear become great dislike set task put evil hour feign necessary make careful scrutiny beard waste least minute length see candle burn low last little more hour consider get dawn buckle distasteful work rummage coffin need climb top shelf stand one find head arm level search task difficult think fall break head end lid bring whole side face vault lad age man frighten set matter search coffin say few hour have courage do night vault believe advance path terror foot foot past night come final step scared feel way vault first time look death lean such sight matter see corpse wash other wreck help case poor body die bed 
38,"The coffin was, as I have said, of great length, and the side being removed, I could see the whole outline of the skeleton that lay in it. I say the outline, for the form was wrapped in a woollen or flannel shroud, so that the bones themselves were not visible. The man that lay in it was little short of a giant, measuring, as I guessed, a full six and a half feet, and the flannel having sunk in over the belly, the end of the breast-bone, the hips, knees, and toes were very easy to be made out. The head was swathed in linen bands that had been white, but were now stained and discoloured with damp, but of this I shall not speak more, and beneath the chin-cloth the beard had once escaped. The clutch which I had made to save myself in falling had torn away this chin-band and let the lower jaw drop on the breast; but little else was disturbed, and there was Colonel John Mohune resting as he had been laid out a century ago. I lifted that portion of the lid which had been left behind, and reached over to see if there was anything hid on the other side of the body; but had scarce let the light fall in the coffin when my heart gave a great bound, and all fear left me in the flush of success, for there I saw what I had come to seek.",coffin say great length side remove see whole outline skeleton lay say outline form wrap woollen flannel shroud bone visible man lay little short giant measure guess full half foot flannel sink belly end breast bone hip knee toe easy make head swath linen band white stain discoloure damp speak more chin cloth beard escape clutch make save fall tear chin band let low jaw drop breast little else disturb be rest lay century lift portion lid leave reach see be hide other side body have scarce let light fall coffin heart give great bind fear leave flush success see come seek 
39,"On the breast of this silent and swathed figure lay a locket, attached to the neck by a thin chain, which passed inside the linen bandages. A whiter portion of the flannel showed how far the beard had extended, but locket and chain were quite black, though I judged that they were made of silver. The shape of this locket was not unlike a crown-piece, only three times as thick, and as soon as I set eyes upon it I never doubted but that inside would be found the diamond.",breast silent swath figure lay locket attach neck thin chain pass linen bandage whit portion flannel show beard extend locket chain black judge make silver shape locket crown piece time thick set eye doubt find diamond 
40,"It was then that a great pity came over me for this thin shadow of man; thinking rather what a fine, tall gentleman Colonel Mohune had once been, and a good soldier no doubt besides, than that he had wasted a noble estate and played traitor to the king. And then I reflected that it was all for the bit of flashing stone, which lay as I hoped within the locket, that he had sold his honour; and wished that the jewel might bring me better fortune than had fallen to him, or at any rate, that it might not lead me into such miry paths. Yet such thoughts did not delay my purpose, and I possessed myself of the locket easily enough, finding a hasp in the chain, and so drawing it out from the linen folds. I had expected as I moved the locket to hear the jewel rattle in the inside, but there was no sound, and then I thought that the diamond might cleave to the side with damp, or perhaps be wrapped in wool. Scarcely was the locket well in my hand before I had it undone, finding a thumb-nick whereby, after a little persuasion, the back, though rusted, could be opened on a hinge. My breath came very fast, and I shook so that I had a difficulty to keep my thumbnail in the nick, yet hardly was it opened before exalted expectation gave place to deepest disappointment.",great pity come thin shadow man think fine tall gentleman good soldier doubt waste noble estate play traitor king reflect bit flash stone lay hope locket sell honour wish jewel bring good fortune fall rate lead such miry path such thought delay purpose possess locket find hasp chain draw linen fold expect move locket hear jewel rattle inside be sound think diamond cleave side damp wrap wool locket hand have undone find thumb nick little persuasion back rust open hinge breath come shake have difficulty keep thumbnail nick open exalt expectation give place deep disappointment 
41,"For there lay all the secret of the locket disclosed, and there was no diamond, no, nor any other jewel, and nothing at all except a little piece of folded paper. Then I felt like a man who has played away all his property and stakes his last crown--heavy-hearted, yet hoping against hope that luck may turn, and that with this piece he may win back all his money. So it was with me; for I hoped that this paper might have written on it directions for the finding of the jewel, and that I might yet rise from the table a winner. It was but a frail hope, and quickly dashed; for when I had smoothed the creases and spread out the piece of paper in the candle-light, there was nothing to be seen except a few verses from the Psalms of David. The paper was yellow, and showed a lattice of folds where it had been pressed into the locket; but the handwriting, though small, was clear and neat, and there was no mistaking a word of what was there set down. 'Twas so short, I could read it at once:",lay secret locket disclose be diamond other jewel little piece fold paper feel man play property stake last crown heavy hearted hope hope luck turn piece win money hope paper write direction finding jewel rise table winner frail hope dash smooth crease spread piece paper candle light be see few verse paper yellow show lattice fold press locket handwriting small clear neat be mistake word set twa short read 
42,"The days of our age are threescore years and ten; And though men be so strong that they come To fourscore years, yet is their strength then But labour and sorrow, so soon passeth it Away, and we are gone. --Psalm 90, 21",day age year man strong come fourscore year strength labour sorrow passeth gone 
43,"And as for me, my feet are almost gone; My treadings are wellnigh slipped. --73, 6",foot gone treading wellnigh slip 
44,"But let not the waterflood drown me; neither let The deep swallow me up. --69, 11",let waterflood drown let deep swallow 
45,"So, going through the vale of misery, I shall Use it for a well, till the pools are filled With water. --84, 14",go vale misery use pool fill water 
46,"For thou hast made the North and the South: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. --89, 6",hast make rejoice name 
47,"So here was an end to great hopes, and I was after all to leave the vault no richer than I had entered it. For look at it as I might, I could not see that these verses could ever lead to any diamond; and though I might otherwise have thought of ciphers or secret writing, yet, remembering what Mr. Glennie had said, that Blackbeard after his wicked life desired to make a good end, and sent for a parson to confess him, I guessed that such pious words had been hung round his neck as a charm to keep the spirits of evil away from his tomb. I was disappointed enough, but before I left picked up the beard from the floor, though it sent a shiver through me to touch it, and put it back in its place on the dead man's breast. I restored also such pieces of the coffin as I could get at, but could not make much of it; so left things as they were, trusting that those who came there next would think the wood had fallen to pieces by natural decay. But the locket I kept, and hung about my neck under my shirt; both as being a curious thing in itself, and because I thought that if the good words inside it were strong enough to keep off bad spirits from Blackbeard, they would be also strong enough to keep Blackbeard from me.",end great hope leave vault richer enter look see verse lead diamond think cipher secret writing remember say wicked life desire make good end send parson confess guess such pious word hang neck charm keep spirit evil tomb disappointed leave pick beard floor send shiver touch put place dead man breast restore such piece coffin get make much leave thing trust come think wood fall piece natural decay locket keep hang neck shirt curious thing think good word strong keep bad spirit strong keep 
48,"When this was done the candle had burnt so low, that I could no longer hold it in my fingers, and was forced to stick it on a piece of the broken wood, and so carry it before me. But, after all, I was not to escape from Blackbeard's clutches so easily; for when I came to the end of the passage, and was prepared to climb up into the churchyard, I found that the hole was stopped, and that there was no exit.",do candle burn low hold finger force stick piece break wood carry escape clutch come end passage prepare climb churchyard find hole stop be exit 
49,"I understood now how it was that I had heard talking so long after the company had left the vault; for it was clear that Ratsey had been as good as his word, and that the falling in of the ground had been repaired before the contraband-men went home that night. At first I made light of the matter, thinking I should soon be able to dislodge this new work, and so find a way out. But when I looked more narrowly into the business, I did not feel so sure; for they had made a sound job of it, putting one very heavy burial slab at the side to pile earth against till the hole was full, and then covering it with another. These were both of slate, and I knew whence they came; for there were a dozen or more of such disused and weather-worn covers laid up against the north side of the church, and every one of them a good burden for four men. Yet I hoped by grouting at the earth below it to be able to dislodge the stone at the side; but while I was considering how best to begin, the candle flickered, the wick gave a sudden lurch to one side, and I was left in darkness.",understand hear talk company leave vault clear good word falling ground repair contraband man go night first make light matter think able dislodge new work find way look business feel sure make sound job put heavy burial slab side pile earth hole full cover slate know come be more such disused weather wear cover lay north side church good burden man hope grout earth able dislodge stone side consider good begin candle flicker wick give sudden lurch side leave darkness 
50,"Thus my plight was evil indeed, for I had nothing now to burn to give me light, and knew that 'twas no use setting to grout till I could see to go about it. Moreover, the darkness was of that black kind that is never found beneath the open sky, no, not even on the darkest night, but lurks in close and covered places and strains the eyes in trying to see into it. Yet I did not give way, but settled to wait for the dawn, which must, I knew, be now at hand; for then I thought enough light would come through the chinks of the tomb above to show me how to set to work. Nor was I even much scared, as one who having been in peril of life from the contraband-men for a spy, and in peril from evil ghosts for rifling Blackbeard's tomb, deemed it a light thing to be left in the dark to wait an hour till morning. So I sat down on the floor of the passage, which, if damp, was at least soft, and being tired with what I had gone through, and not used to miss a night's rest, fell straightway asleep.",plight evil have burn give light know twat use setting grout see go darkness black kind find open sky dark night lurk close cover place strain eye try see give way settle wait dawn know hand think enough light come chink tomb show set work scared peril life contraband man spy peril evil ghost rifl tomb deem light thing leave dark wait hour morning sit floor passage damp least soft tired go use miss night rest fall asleep 
51,"How long I slept I cannot tell, for I had nothing to guide me to the time, but woke at length, and found myself still in darkness. I stood up and stretched my limbs, but did not feel as one refreshed by wholesome sleep, but sick and tired with pains in back, arms, and legs, as if beaten or bruised. I have said I was still in darkness, yet it was not the blackness of the last night; and looking up into the inside of the tomb above, I could see the faintest line of light at one corner, which showed the sun was up. For this line of light was the sunlight, filtering slowly through a crevice at the joining of the stones; but the sides of the tomb had been fitted much closer than I reckoned for, and it was plain there would never be light in the place enough to guide me to my work. All this I considered as I rested on the ground, for I had sat down again, feeling too tired to stand. But as I kept my eye on the narrow streak of light I was much startled, for I looked at the south-west corner of the tomb, and yet was looking towards the sun. This I gathered from the tone of the light; and although there was no direct outlet to the air, and only a glimmer came in, as I have said, yet I knew certainly that the sun was low in the west and falling full upon this stone.",sleep tell have guide time wake length find darkness stand stretch limb feel refresh wholesome sleep sick tired pain back arm leg beat bruise say darkness blackness last night look inside tomb see faintest line light corner show sun line light sunlight filter crevice join stone side tomb fit close reckon plain be light place guide work consider rest ground sit feel tired stand keep eye narrow streak light startle look south west corner tomb look sun gather tone light be direct outlet air glimmer come say know sun low west fall full stone 
52,"Here was a surprise, and a sad one for me, for I perceived that I had slept away a day, and that the sun was setting for another night. And yet it mattered little, for night or daytime there was no light to help me in this horrible place; and though my eyes had grown accustomed to the gloom, I could make out nothing to show me where to work. So I took out my tinder-box, meaning to fan the match into a flame, and to get at least one moment's look at the place, and then to set to digging with my hands.",surprise sad one perceive sleep day sun set night matter little night daytime be light help horrible place eye grow accustom gloom make show work take tinder box mean fan match flame get least moment look place set digg hand 
53,"But as I lay asleep the top had been pressed off the box, and the tinder got loose in my pocket; and though I picked the tinder out easily enough, and got it in the box again, yet the salt damps of the place had soddened it in the night, and spark by spark fell idle from the flint.",lay top press box tinder get loose pocket pick tinder get box salt damp place sodden night spark spark fall flint 
54,"And then it was that I first perceived the danger in which I stood; for there was no hope of kindling a light, and I doubted now whether even in the light I could ever have done much to dislodge the great slab of slate. I began also to feel very hungry, as not having eaten for twenty-four hours; and worse than that, there was a parching thirst and dryness in my throat, and nothing with which to quench it. Yet there was no time to be lost if I was ever to get out alive, and so I groped with my hands against the side of the grave until I made out the bottom edge of the slab, and then fell to grubbing beneath it with my fingers. But the earth, which the day before had looked light and loamy to the eye, was stiff and hard enough when one came to tackle it with naked hands, and in an hour's time I had done little more than further weary myself and bruise my fingers.",perceive danger stand be hope kindle light doubt light do much dislodge great slab slate begin feel hungry eat hour bad be parch thirst dryness throat quench be time lose get alive grope hand side grave make bottom edge slab fall grubb finger earth day look light loamy eye stiff hard come tackle naked hand hour time do little more weary bruise finger 
55,"Then I was forced to rest; and, sitting down on the ground, saw that the glimmering streak of light had faded, and that the awful blackness of the previous night was creeping up again. And now I had no heart to face it, being cowed with hunger, thirst, and weariness; and so flung myself upon my face, that I might not see how dark it was, and groaned for very lowness of spirit. Thus I lay for a long time, but afterwards stood up and cried aloud, and shrieked if anyone should haply hear me, calling to Mr. Glennie and Ratsey, and even Elzevir, by name, to save me from this awful place. But there came no answer, except the echo of my own voice sounding hollow and far off down in the vault. So in despair I turned back to the earth wall below the slab, and scrabbled at it with my fingers, till my nails were broken and the blood ran out; having all the while a sure knowledge, like a cord twisted round my head, that no effort of mine could ever dislodge the great stone. And thus the hours passed, and I shall not say more here, for the remembrance of that time is still terrible, and besides, no words could ever set forth the anguish I then suffered, yet did slumber come sometimes to my help; for even while I was working at the earth, sheer weariness would overtake me, and I sank on to the ground and fell asleep.",force rest sit ground see glimmer streak light fade awful blackness previous night creep have heart face cow hunger thirst weariness flung face see dark groan lowness spirit lay long time stand cry shriek hear call name save awful place come answer echo own voice sound hollow vault despair turn earth wall slab scrabble finger nail break blood run have while sure knowledge cord twist head effort dislodge great stone hour pass say remembrance time terrible word set anguish suffer slumber come help work earth sheer weariness overtake sink ground fall asleep 
56,"And still the hours passed, and at last I knew by the glimmer of light in the tomb above that the sun had risen again, and a maddening thirst had hold of me. And then I thought of all the barrels piled up in the vault and of the liquor that they held; and stuck not because 'twas spirit, for I would scarce have paused to sate that thirst even with molten lead. So I felt my way down the passage back to the vault, and recked not of the darkness, nor of Blackbeard and his crew, if only I could lay my lips to liquor. Thus I groped about the barrels till near the top of the stack my hand struck on the spile of a keg, and drawing it, I got my mouth to the hold.",hour pass last know glimmer light tomb sun rise maddening thirst have hold think barrel pile vault liquor hold stick twa spirit pause sate thirst molten lead feel way passage vault reck darkness crew lay lip liquor grope barrel top stack hand strike spile keg draw get mouth hold 
57,"What the liquor was I do not know, but it was not so strong but that I could swallow it in great gulps and found it less burning than my burning throat. But when I turned to get back to the passage, I could not find the outlet, and fumbled round and round until my brain was dizzy, and I fell senseless to the ground.",liquor know strong swallow great gulp find burn burning throat turn get passage find outlet fumble brain dizzy fall senseless ground
