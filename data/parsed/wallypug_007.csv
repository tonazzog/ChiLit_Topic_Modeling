7,"The first witness was A. Fish, Esq., who coughed importantly as he stepped up into the box with a jaunty air. “Let’s see, what’s your name?” asked the Doctor-in-Law, with a supercilious stare. Now, this was absurd, for, of course, he knew as well as I did what the Fish’s name was; but as I heard him whisper to Madame, the judges in England always pretend not to know _anything_, and he was doing the same.",first witness cough step box jaunty air let see name ask supercilious stare absurd course know do name hear whisper judge pretend know do same

Oh! it is too much! the heartless creature! Oh-h!” and the lady sank back and gasped hysterically. At this there was a terrible uproar in the court—the animals stood up on the seats, frantically gesticulating and crying: “Traitor!” “Down with the Wallypug!” “Off with his head!” “Banish him!” “Send him to jail!” while above all could be heard the Cockatoo screaming:",traitor cry hear scream have effrontery tell face willing sell whole kingdom horse much heartless creature lady sink gasp be terrible uproar court animal stand seat gesticulate cry traitor head banish send jail hear scream

34,"The whole assembly seemed to have taken leave of their senses, and for a few moments the utmost confusion prevailed. The creatures nearest to the Wallypug seemed as though they would tear him to pieces in their fury, and if it had not been for his jailers, the Crocodiles, I am convinced they would have done him some injury. “This is outrageous,” I managed to shout at last. “You are making all this disturbance for nothing. What the Wallypug said was merely a quotation from one of Shakespeare’s plays.”",whole assembly seem take leave sense few moment utmost confusion prevail creature seem tear piece fury jailer convinced do injury outrageous manage shout last make disturbance say quotation play

I was highly indignant with his heartless ingratitude, but could do positively nothing, while all of my protests were drowned in the babel of sounds made by the furious creatures in the body of the court.",protest load chain march rob crown sceptre orb other insignia kind word say old sovereign seem rejoice downfall indignant heartless ingratitude do protest drown babel sound make furious creature body court

39,"After being taken from the dock I was marched off in one direction and his Majesty in another, and the last view I had of the Wallypug was that of the poor little fellow being limply dragged along by two Crocodiles in the direction of the dungeons.

Arrest of the Wallypug! Shocking discovery! The Wallypug a traitor! Sister-in-Law prostrate with excitement! The Hatless Man implicated!” He was doing a roaring trade, as nearly everybody was buying papers of him, and excited groups of animals were standing about eagerly discussing what was evidently the cause of a tremendous sensation in the kingdom of Why.",evening hear shouting bottom tower look barr window see rush packet newspaper arm hear call loud voice special edition arrest shocking discovery traitor prostrate excitement implicate do roar trade buy paper excite group animal stand discuss cause tremendous sensation kingdom
