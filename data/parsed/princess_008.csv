1,CHAPTER VIII. THE GOBLINS,goblins 
2," FOR some time Curdie worked away briskly, throwing all the ore he had disengaged on one side behind him, to be ready for carrying out in the morning. He heard a good deal of goblin-tapping, but it all sounded far away in the hill, and he paid it little heed. Toward midnight he began to feel rather hungry; so he dropped his pickaxe, got a lump of bread which in the morning he had laid in a damp hole in the rock, sat down on a heap of ore and ate his supper. Then he leaned back for five minutes' rest before beginning his work again, and laid his head against the rock. He had not kept the position for one minute before he heard something which made him sharpen his ears. It sounded like a voice inside the rock. After a while he heard it again. It was a goblin-voice--there could be no doubt about that--and this time he could make out the words.",time work throw ore disengage side ready carry morning hear good deal goblin tapping sound hill pay little heed midnight begin feel hungry drop pickaxe get lump bread morning lay damp hole rock sit heap ore eat supper learn minute rest begin work lay head rock keep position minute hear make sharp ear sound voice rock while hear goblin voice be doubt time make word

7,"""Yes, but a good bit farther on than he has got to yet. If he had struck a stroke more to the side just here,"" said the goblin, tapping the very stone, as it seemed to Curdie, against which his head lay, ""he would have been through; but he's a couple of yards past it now, and if he follow the lode it will be a week before it leads him in. You see it back there--a long way. Still, perhaps, in case of accident, it would be as well to be getting out of this. Helfer, you'll take the great chest.

18,"""The queen does.""",queen 
19,"""Yes; but that's for distinction. The first queen, you see--I mean the king's first wife--wore shoes of course, because she came from upstairs; and so, when she died, the next queen would not be inferior to her as she called it, and would wear shoes too. It was all pride. She is the hardest in forbidding them to the rest of the women.""",distinction first queen see mean king first wife wear shoe course come die next queen inferior call wear shoe pride hard forbid rest woman

57,"He dropped his voice so low that Curdie could hear only a growl. The growl went on in a low bass for a good while, as inarticulate as if the goblin's tongue had been a sausage; and it was not until his wife spoke again that it rose to its former pitch.",drop voice low hear growl growl go low bass good while inarticulate goblin tongue sausage wife speak rise former pitch

60,After this arose a confused conversation about the various household goods and their transport; and Curdie heard nothing more that was of any importance.,arise confuse conversation various household goods transport hear more importance 
61,"He now knew at least one of the reasons for the constant sound of the goblin hammers and pickaxes at night. They were making new houses for themselves, to which they might retreat when the miners should threaten to break into their dwellings. But he had learned two things of far greater importance. The first was, that some grievous calamity was preparing, and almost ready to fall upon the heads of the miners; the second was--the one weak point of a goblin's body: he had not known that their feet were so tender as he had now reason to suspect. He had heard it said that they had no toes: he had never had opportunity of inspecting them closely enough in the dusk in which they always appeared, to satisfy himself whether it was a correct report. Indeed, he had not been able even to satisfy himself as to whether they had no fingers, although that also was commonly said to be the fact. One of the miners, indeed, who had had more schooling than the rest, was wont to argue that such must have been the primordial condition of humanity, and that education and handicraft had developed both toes and fingers--with which proposition Curdie had once heard his father sarcastically agree, alleging in support of it the probability that babies' gloves were a traditional remnant of the old state of things; while the stockings of all ages, no regard being paid in them to the toes, pointed in the same direction. But what was of importance was the fact concerning the softness of the goblin-feet, which he foresaw might be useful to all miners. What he had to do in the mean time, however, was to discover, if possible, the special evil design the goblins had now in their heads.",know least reason constant sound goblin hammer pickaxe night make new house retreat miner threaten break dwelling learn thing great importance first grievous calamity prepare ready fall head miner second weak point goblin body know foot tender have reason suspect hear say have toe have opportunity inspect dusk appear satisfy correct report able satisfy have finger say fact miner have more schooling rest wont argue such primordial condition humanity education handicraft develop toe finger proposition hear father agree allege support probability baby glove traditional remnant old state thing stocking age regard pay toe point same direction importance fact concern softness goblin foot foresee useful miner have do mean time discover possible special evil design goblin have head 
62,"Although he knew all the gangs and all the natural galleries with which they communicated in the mined part of the mountain, he had not the least idea where the palace of the king of the gnomes was; otherwise he would have set out at once on the enterprise of discovering what the said design was. He judged, and rightly, that it must lie in a farther part of the mountain, between which and the mine there was as yet no communication. There must be one nearly completed, however; for it could be but a thin partition which now separated them. If only he could get through in time to follow the goblins as they retreated! A few blows would doubtless be sufficient--just where his ear now lay; but if he attempted to strike there with his pickaxe, he would only hasten the departure of the family, put them on their guard, and perhaps lose their involuntary guidance. He therefore began to feel the wall with his hands, and soon found that some of the stones were loose enough to be drawn out with little noise.",know gang natural gallery communicate mine part mountain have least idea palace king gnome set enterprise discover say design judge lie far part mountain communication be complete thin partition separate get time follow goblin retreat few blow sufficient ear lay attempt strike pickaxe hast departure family put guard lose involuntary guidance begin feel wall hand find stone loose draw little noise

68,"""Then I suppose it must have been a stone carried down the brook inside.""",suppose stone carry brook 
69,"""Perhaps. It will have more room by and by.""",have more room 
70,"Curdie kept quite still. After a little while, hearing nothing but the sounds of their preparations for departure, mingled with an occasional word of direction, and anxious to know whether the removal of the stone had made an opening into the goblins' house, he put in his hand to feel. It went in a good way, and then came in contact with something soft. He had but a moment to feel it over, it was so quickly withdrawn: it was one of the toeless goblin-feet. The owner of it gave a cry of fright.",keep little while hear sound preparation departure mingle occasional word direction anxious know removal stone make opening goblin house put hand feel go good way come contact soft have moment feel withdraw toeless goblin foot owner give cry fright

77,"""I tell you to hold your tongue. You are no patriot.""",tell hold tongue patriot 
78,"Curdie suppressed his laughter, and lay still as a mouse--but no stiller, for every moment he kept nibbling away with his fingers at the edges of the hole. He was slowly making it bigger, for here the rock had been very much shattered with the blasting.",suppress laughter lay mouse stiller moment keep nibble finger edge hole make big rock shattered blasting 
79,"There seemed to be a good many in the family, to judge from the mass of confused talk which now and then came through the hole; but when all were speaking together, and just as if they had bottle-brushes--each at least one--in their throats, it was not easy to make out much that was said. At length he heard once more what the father-goblin was saying.",seem be good many family judge mass confuse talk come hole speak have bottle brush least throat easy make much say length hear more father goblin say

82,"""Your turn will come in good time enough! Make haste. I _must_ go to the meeting at the palace to-night. When that's over, we can come back and clear out the last of the things before our enemies return in the morning. Now light your torches, and come along. What a distinction it is to provide our own light, instead of being dependent on a thing hung up in the air--a most disagreeable contrivance--intended no doubt to blind us when we venture out under its baleful influence! Quite glaring and vulgar, I call it, though no doubt useful to poor creatures who haven't the wit to make light for themselves!""",turn come good time make haste go meeting palace night come clear last thing enemy return morning light torche come distinction provide own light dependent thing hang air disagreeable contrivance intend doubt blind venture baleful influence glaring vulgar call useful poor creature have wit make light

But a moment's reflection showed him that they would have said they did, inasmuch as they struck two stones together, and the fire came.",keep call know make fire light torche moment reflection show say strike stone fire come
