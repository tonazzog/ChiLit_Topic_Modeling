1,"CHAPTER 12. THE ""DOMINICAN"" AGAIN.",
2,"The circumstances which had attended the publication of the first number of the _Dominican_ had been such as to throw a damper over the future success of that valuable paper.  It was most uncomfortably connected in the minds of the Fifth with the cowardice of Oliver Greenfield, and with the stigma which his conduct had cast upon the whole Form, and they one and all experienced a great diminution of interest in its future.",circumstance attend publication first number such throw damper future success valuable paper connect mind fifth cowardice stigma conduct cast whole form experience great diminution interest future 
3,"The Fifth were far more intent on vindicating their reputation with the Sixth--and, indeed, with the rest of the school.  They sought every opportunity of bringing on a collision with the monitors.  One or two of their number went, so far as to pick quarrels with members of the rival class, in hopes of a fight.  But in this they were not successful.  The Sixth chose to look upon this display of feeling among their juniors as a temporary aberration of mind, and were by no means to be tempted into hostilities.  They asserted their authority wherever they could enforce it, and sacrificed it whenever it seemed more discreet to do so.  Only one thing evoked a temporary display of vexation from them, and that was when Ricketts and Braddy appeared one day, arm-in-arm, in the passages with _tall hats_ on their heads.  Now, tall hats on week-days were the exclusive privilege of the Sixth at Saint Dominic's, and, worn by them during school hours, served as the badge of monitorship.  This action on the part of the Fifth, therefore, was as good as a usurpation of monitorial rights, and that the Sixth were not disposed to stand. However, Raleigh, the captain, when appealed to, pooh-poohed the matter. ""Let them be,"" said he; ""what do you want to make a row about it for? If the boys do mistake them for monitors, so much the less row in the passages.""",fifth intent vindicate reputation sixth rest school seek opportunity bring collision monitor number go pick quarrel member rival class hope fight successful choose look display feeling junior temporary aberration mind means tempt hostility assert authority enforce sacrifice seem discreet do thing evoke temporary display vexation appear day arm arm passage _tall hats_ head tall hat week day exclusive privilege wear school hour serve badge monitorship action part fifth good usurpation monitorial right dispose stand captain appeal pooh pooh matter let say want make row boy mistake monitor much less row passage 
4,"Raleigh was always a man of peace--though it was rumoured he could, if he chose, thrash any two Dominicans going--and the monitors were much disgusted to find that he did not authorise them to interfere with the Fifth in the matter.  But the Fifth _were_ interfered with in another quarter, and in a way which caused them to drop their chimney-pots completely.  One afternoon the entire Fourth Junior appeared in the corridors in their Sunday tiles!  In their Sunday tiles they slid down the banisters; in their Sunday tiles they played leapfrog; in their Sunday tiles they executed a monster tug-of-war in the bottom corridor! Stephen and Bramble fought their usual battle in top hats, and Master Paul insisted on wearing the same decoration while washing up Oliver's tea-things.  It was a splendid hit, and for once in a way Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles scored one, for the Fifth appeared next day in their ordinary ""boilers,"" and the dignity of the monitors was vindicated.",man peace rumoure choose thrash go monitor disgusted find authorise interfere fifth matter fifth interfer quarter way cause drop chimney pot afternoon entire fourth appear corridor tile tile slide banister tile play leapfrog tile execute monster tug war bottom corridor fight usual battle top hat insist wear same decoration wash tea- thing splendid hit way guinea pig score fifth appear next day ordinary boiler dignity monitor vindicate

18,"Oliver was as bad; he declared the things he had written before--even with Pembury's assistance--had taken him such ages to do, that he wasn't going in for the next number.  He was very sorry to disappoint, and all that; but if Tony was in for a scholarship next Michaelmas he would understand the reason.  Why not let the thing drop this month?",bad declare thing write assistance take such age do go next number sorry disappoint scholarship next understand reason let thing drop month 
19,"This, however, by no means met Tony's views.  A pretty figure he would cut if it were to be said he couldn't keep up a paper for two numbers running!  No! his mind was made up.  Number 2 _should_ come out, even if he wrote every word of it himself!  And with that determination he hobbled off to his study.

22,"""Oh, never mind.  I could do some more bits about other things, you know, if you like.""",mind do more bit other thing know like 
23,"Pembury said he didn't think he should require any more ""bits,"" but was awfully obliged by this one, which was first-rate, a recommendation which sent Simon away happy to his study, there immediately to compose the opening stanza of his famous epic, ""The Sole's Allegery--a sacred Poem.""",say think require more bit oblige one first rate recommendation send happy study compose open stanza famous epic sacred poem 
24,"With one contribution in hand, Tony locked his door and sat down to write.  There was something out of the common about Pembury.  With the body of a cripple he had the heart of a lion, and difficulties only made it more dauntless.  Any one else would have thought twice, indeed, before undertaking the task he was now setting himself to do, and ninety-nine out of every hundred would have abandoned it before it was half done.  But Tony was indomitable.  Every night that week he locked his study-door, and threats and kicks and entreaties would not open it even to his dearest friends.  And slowly the huge white sheet before him showed the signs of his diligence.  The great long columns, one after another, filled up; paragraph followed paragraph, and article article. He coolly continued the ""History of Saint Dominic's"" begun last month by Bullinger, and the ""Reports of the Sixth Form Debates"" commenced by Tom Senior.  And the ""Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse"" went on just as if Wraysford had never abandoned it; and the poem on the Guinea-pigs, promised in Number 1, by the author of ""To a Tadpole,"" duly appeared also.  Besides this, there were the continuations of Tony's own articles, and his ""Personal Notes,"" and ""Squeaks from Tadpoleopolis,"" and advertisements just as usual; until, in due time, the last column was filled up, the sheet triumphantly fixed in its frame, and as triumphantly hung up on its own particular nails on the wall outside the Fifth Form door.",contribution hand lock door sit write be common body cripple have heart lion difficulty make dauntless one else think undertake task set do abandon half do indomitable night week lock study door threat kick entreaty open dearest friend huge white sheet show sign diligence great long column fill paragraph follow paragraph article article continue begin last month sixth commence sixth go abandon poem guinea pig promise author appear be continuation own article personal advertisement usual due time last column fill sheet fix frame hang own particular nail wall fifth door 
25,"It was a feat to be proud of, and Tony was justly and pardonably proud. It was at least a gratification next morning to see not only that the school generally took unabated interest in the _Dominican_, but that he had fairly astonished his own class-fellows.  Their admiration of the editor was unbounded and undisguised.  Their consciences had all, more or less, reproached them for backing out of their responsibilities in the way they had; and now it quite touched them to see how, notwithstanding, Anthony had by his own labour made up for their defect, and sustained the reputation of the Fifth before all the school.",feat proud proud least gratification next morning see school take unabated interest astonished own class fellow admiration editor unbounded undisguised conscience more reproach back responsibility way have touch see notwithstand have own labour make defect sustain reputation fifth school

This pretty business might have gone on till to-morrow week had the men's upper stories been as `O.K.' as their timbers, but they messed about over a pretty snick of Noll's, and, after popping the question three times, Teddy got home just in time to see his two bails tumble out of their groove.

29,"This version of the incident was by no means pleasant to Loman, but to every one else it was highly diverting, and it actually made one or two of the Fifth think that Oliver, after all, had not done such a very discreditable thing in taking that angry word in silence.  If only he had shown more spirit about the blow, they could have forgiven the rest.",version incident means pleasant one else divert make fifth think do discreditable thing take angry word silence show more spirit blow forgive rest

I wonder, by the way, why that bird found it so hard to translate the simplest sentence without his Bohn!  The Doctor really shouldn't--I hope he will restore to Wren his backbone by giving him back his Bohn.  Hum! I heard some one smiling.

43,"Again Simon, who had watched with intense interest the reception of his poem, was perplexed to notice the amusement it had caused.  Even Pembury had mistaken its ""inmost soul,"" for he had placed it in the column devoted to ""Facetiae.""  Nor could Simon understand why, for the next week, every one he met had his thumb in his mouth.  It was very queer-- one of life's mysteries--and he had thoughts of embodying the fact in his ""Sole's Allegery,"" which was now rapidly approaching completion.",watch intense interest reception poem perplex notice amusement cause mistaken inmost soul place column devote understand next week one meet have thumb mouth queer life mystery have thought embody fact approach completion

That meeting lasted from three to five.  What awful threats were uttered, and what awful vows taken, no one knew.  At five o'clock Stephen's fight with Bramble came off as usual, and all that evening Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles did nothing but make paper darts.  It was certain a crisis had come in their history.

51,"""Nevertherless, we would refer to one or two of these interesting attempts.  Take, for example, the essay on the `Character of Julius Caesar,' by one who signs himself Raleigh.  This is very well written. Pains have been taken about the formation of the letters, and some of the capitals are specially worthy of praise.  For one so young, we rarely saw the capital D so well done.  Dr Smith, were he alive, would be pleased to see his remarks on Caesar so well and accurately copied out.  Master Wren gives us some verse--a translation out of Horace.  We wonder if Mr Wren is any relation to the late Jenny Wren who married Mr Cock Robin.  We should imagine from these verses that Mr Wren must be well acquainted with _Robbin_.  Take one more, Master Loman's `A Funny Story.'  We are sorry to find Master Loman tells stories.  Boys shouldn't tell stories; it's not right.  But Master Loman unfortunately does tell stories, and this is one.  He calls it `A Funny Story.'  That is a story to begin with, for it is not funny.  We don't know what Master Loman thinks funny; perhaps he calls being run out at cricket funny, or hitting another boy in the mouth when he's looking another way.  In any case, we can't make out why he calls this story funny.  The only funny thing about it is its title, and his spelling `attach' `attatch.'  The last is really funny.  It shows how partial Mr Loman is to _tea_.  If this funny story is the result of his partiality to tea, we are afraid it was very weak stuff.""",refer interesting attempt take example essay sign write pain take formation letter capital worthy praise young see capital d do alive pleased see remark copy give verse translation wonder relation late marry imagine verse acquainted take more funny sorry find tell story boy tell story right tell story call funny story begin funny know think funny call run cricket funny hit boy mouth look way case make call story funny only funny thing title spelling attach attatch last funny show partial funny story result partiality tea afraid weak stuff

He was one of those vain fellows who cannot see a jest where it is levelled at themselves.  The rest of the Sixth had the sense, whatever they felt, to laugh at Anthony's hard hits.  But not so Loman; he lost his temper completely.  He ordered the _Dominican_ to be taken down; he threatened to report the whole Fifth to the Doctor.  He would not allow the junior boys to stand and read it.
