And in his clear and ready smile,   Unshaded by a thought of guile   And unrepress'd by sadness,--   Which brings me to my childhood back,   As if I trod its very track,   And felt its very gladness.",be noble boy brave free hearted careless one uncheck unbidden joy dread book love fun clear ready smile unshade thought guile unrepress sadness bring childhood trod very track feel gladness

4," One evening, when Harry and Laura came down to dessert, they were surprised to observe the two little plates usually intended for them, turned upside down, while uncle David pretended not to notice anything, though he stole a glance to see what would happen next. On lifting up these mysterious plates, what did they see lying underneath, but two letters with large red seals, one directed to ""Master Harry Graham,"" and the other to ""Miss Laura Graham.""",evening come dessert surprise observe little plate intend turn uncle pretend notice steal glance see happen lift mysterious plate see lie letter large red seal direct other 
5,"""A letter for me!!"" cried Harry, in a tone of delighted astonishment, while he tore open the seal, and his hand shook with impatience, so that he could hardly unfold the paper. ""What can it be about! I like getting a letter very much! Is it from papa? Did the postman bring it?""",letter cry tone delight astonishment tore open seal hand shake impatience unfold paper like get letter papa postman bring

8,"""I am asked too! and not Mrs. Crabtree!"" cried Harry, looking at his letter, and almost screaming out for joy, whilst he skipped about the room, rubbing his hands together, and ended by twirling Laura round and round, till they both fell prostrate on the floor.",ask cry look letter scream joy skip room rub hand end twirl fall prostrate floor 
9,"""If that be meant as a specimen of how you intend to behave at Holiday House, we had better send your apology at once,"" observed Lady Harriet, smiling. ""Lord Rockville is very particular about never hearing any noise, and the slamming of a door, or even the creaking of a pair of unruly shoes, would put him distracted.""",mean specimen intend behave send apology observe smile particular hear noise slamming door creaking pair unruly shoe put distract 
10,"""Yes!"" added uncle David, ""Holiday House is as quiet as Harry's drum with a hole in it. If a pin drops in any part of the mansion, Lord Rockville becomes annoyed, and the very wasps scarcely dare to buz at his window so loud as at any other person's. You will feel quite fish-out-of-water-ish, trying to be quiet and hum-drum for a whole week, so let me advise you not to go.""",add uncle quiet drum hole pin drop part mansion become annoy very wasp dare buz window other person feel fish water try quiet hum drum whole week let advise go 
11,"""The meaning of advice always is something that one would rather wish not to do,"" observed Laura, gravely. ""I never in my life was advised to enjoy anything pleasant! Taking physic--or learning lessons--or staying at home, are very often advised, but never playing--or having a holiday--or amusing ourselves!""",meaning advice wish do observe life advise enjoy pleasant take physic learning lesson stay home advise play have holiday amusing 
12,"""You know, Laura! that Harry's little Shetland pony, Tom Thumb, in my field, is of no use at present, but kicks, and capers, and runs about all day; yet presently he will be led out fastened to a rope, and made to trot round and round in a circle, day after day, till he has no longer a will of his own,--that is education. Afterwards he shall have a bridle put in his mouth, which some little girls would be much the better of also, when he shall be carefully guided ever afterwards in the best ways; and you likewise will go much more steadily for all the reining-in and whipping you have got from Mrs. Crabtree and me, which may, perhaps, make you keep in the road of duty more easily hereafter.""",know little pony field use present kick caper run day lead fasten rope make trot circle day day have will own education have bridle put mouth little girl good guide good way go reining whipping get make keep road duty 
13,"""Uncle David!"" said Harry, laughing, ""we have read in the Arabian Nights, about people being turned into animals, but I never thought you would turn Laura into a horse! What shall we do with my little Shetland pony if I go away next week?""",uncle say laugh read arabian person turn animal think turn horse do little pony go next week 
14,"""I have thought of a capital plan for making Tom Thumb useful during the whole winter!

15,"""Uncle David should be Professor of Nonsense at the University,"" said Lady Harriet, smiling. ""But, my dear children, if you are allowed to pay this visit at Holiday House, I hope you will endeavour to behave creditably?""",say smile dear child allow pay visit hope endeavour behave 
16,"""Yes,"" added Major Graham, ""I understand that Lord Rockville wished to have some particularly quiet children there, for a short time, so he fixed upon Harry and Laura! Poor, mistaken Lord Rockville! But, my good friends, try not to break all his china ornaments the first day--spare a few jars and tea-cups--leave a pane of glass or two in the windows, and throw none of your marbles at the mirrors.""",add understand wish have quiet child short time fix poor mistaken good friend try break china ornament first day spare few jar tea cup leave pane glass window throw marble mirror 
17,"""I remember hearing,"" said Lady Harriet, ""that when Miss Pelham was married last year, her old aunt, Mrs. Bouverie, sent for her and said, that as she could not afford to give baubles or trinkets, she would give her a very valuable piece of advice; and what do you think it was, Laura?""",remember hear say marry last year old aunt send say afford give bauble trinket give valuable piece advice think 
18,"""I have no idea! Do tell me.""",have idea tell 
19,"""Then I shall bestow it on you, as the old lady did on her niece--'Be careful of china, paper and string, for they are all very transitory possessions in this world!'""",bestow old lady do niece careful china paper string transitory possession world 
20,"""Very true! and most judicious!"" observed Major Graham, laughing. ""I certainly know several persons who must have served an apprenticeship under that good lady. Many gentlemen now, who despatch all their epistles from the club, because there the paper costs them nothing, and a number of ladies, who, for the same good reason, never write letters till they are visiting in a country house.""",true judicious observe laugh know several person serve apprenticeship good lady many gentleman despatch epistle club paper cost number lady same good reason write letter visit country house 
21,"Having received so many warnings and injunctions about behaving well, Harry and Laura became so quiet during the first few days at Holiday House, that they were like shadows flitting through the rooms, going almost on tiptoe, scarcely speaking above a whisper, and observing that valuable rule for children, to let themselves be seen, but not heard. Lord Rockville was quite charmed with such extreme good conduct, for they were both in especial awe of him, and thought it a great condescension if he even looked at them, he was so tall, so grand, and so grave, wearing a large powdered wig and silver spectacles, which gave him a particularly venerable appearance, though Harry was one day very near getting into disgrace upon that subject. His Lordship had a habit of always carrying two pairs of spectacles in his pocket, and often, after thrusting one pair high on his forehead, he forgot where they were, and put the others on his nose, which had such a droll appearance, that the first time Harry saw it, he felt quite taken by surprise, and burst into a fit of laughter, upon which Lord Rockville gave him such a comical look of surprise and perplexity, that Harry's fit of laughing got worse and worse. The more people know they are wrong, and try to stop, the more convulsive it becomes, and the more difficult to look grave again, so at last, after repeated efforts to appear serious and composed, Harry started up, and in his hurry to escape, very nearly slammed the door behind him, which would have given the last finish to his offences.",receive many warning injunction behave become quiet first few day shadow flit room go tiptoe speak whisper observe valuable rule child let see hear charm such extreme good conduct especial awe think great condescension look tall grand grave wear large powder wig silver spectacle give venerable appearance day get disgrace subject have habit carry pair spectacle pocket thrust pair high forehead forget put other nose have droll appearance first time see feel take surprise burst fit laughter give comical look surprise perplexity fit laugh get bad bad more person know wrong try stop convulsive become difficult look grave last repeat effort appear serious compose start hurry escape slam door give last finish offence 
22,"Both the little visitors found Lady Rockville so extremely indulgent and kind, that she seemed like another grandmama, therefore they gradually ventured to talk some of their own nonsense before her, and even to try some of their old ways, and frolicsome tricks, which she seldom found any fault with, except when Harry one day eloped with Lord Rockville's favourite walking-stick, to be used as a fishing-rod among the minnows, with a long thread at the end for a line, and a crooked pin to represent the hook, while, on the same day, Laura privately mounted the ass that gave Lord Rockville's ass's milk, and rode it all round the park, while he sat at home expecting his usual refreshing tumbler. Still they both passed muster for being very tolerable children, and his Lordship was heard once to say, in a voice of great approbation, that Master and Miss Graham were so punctual at dinner, and so perfectly quiet, he really often forgot they were in the house. Indeed, Harry's complaisance on the day after he had laughed so injudiciously about the spectacles, was quite unheard of, as he felt anxious to make up for his misconduct; and when Lord Rockville asked if he would like a fire in the play-room, as the evening was chilly, he answered very politely, ""Thank you, my Lord! We are ready to think it hot or cold, just as you please!""",little visitor find indulgent kind seem grandmama venture talk own nonsense try old way frolicsome trick find fault day elope favourite walking stick use fishing rod minnow long thread end line crooked pin represent hook same day mount ass give ass milk ride park sit home expect usual refresh tumbler pass muster tolerable child lordship hear say voice great approbation punctual dinner quiet forget house complaisance day laugh spectacle unheard feel anxious make misconduct ask like fire play room evening chilly answer thank ready think hot cold 
23,"All this was too good to last! One morning, when Harry and Laura looked out of the window, it was a most deplorably wet day. The whole sky looked like a large grey cotton umbrella, and the clouds were so low that Harry thought he could almost have touched them. In short, as Lord Rockville remarked, ""it rained cats and dogs,"" so his Lordship knitted his brows, and thrust his hands into his waistcoat pockets, walking up and down the room in a perfect fume of vexation, for he was so accustomed to be obeyed, that it seemed rather a hardship when even the weather contradicted his wishes. To complete his vexation, as ""single misfortunes never come alone,"" his valet, when carelessly drying the Morning Post at a large kitchen fire, had set it in flames, so that all the wonderful news it contained became reduced to ashes, therefore Lord Rockville might well have given notice, that, for this day at least, he had a right to be in extremely bad humour.",good last morning look window wet day whole sky look large grey cotton umbrella cloud low think touch short remark rain cat dog knite brow thrust hand waistcoat pocket walk room perfect fume vexation accustom obey seem hardship weather contradict wish complete vexation single misfortune come valet drying large kitchen fire set flame wonderful news contain become reduce ash give notice day least have right bad humour 
24,"Lady Rockville privately recommended Harry and Laura to sit quietly down and play at cat's cradle, which accordingly they did, and when that became no longer endurable, some dominos were produced. Thus the morning wore tediously away till about two o'clock, when suddenly the rain stopped, the sun burst forth with prodigious splendour, every leaf in the park glittered, as if it had been sprinkled with diamonds, and a hundred birds seemed singing a chorus of joy, while bees and butterflies fluttered at the windows and flew away rejoicing.",recommend sit play cat cradle become endurable dominos produce morning wear o'clock rain stop sun burst prodigious splendour leaf park glitter sprinkle diamond bird seem sing chorus joy bee butterfly flutter window fly rejoice 
25,"Harry was the first to observe this delightful change, and with an exclamation of delight, he sprang from his seat, pulled Laura from hers, upset the domino-table, and rushed out of the room, slamming the door with a report like twenty cannons. Away they both flew to the forest, Laura swinging her bonnet in her hand, and Harry tossing his cap in the air, while Lord Rockville watched them angrily from the drawing-room window, saying, in a tone of extreme displeasure, ""That boy has a voice that might do for the town-crier! He laughs so loud, it is enough to crack every glass in the room! I wish he were condemned to pass a week in those American prisons where no one is allowed to speak. In short, he would be better anywhere than here, for I might as well live with a hammer and tongs, as with the two children together. They are more restless than the quicksilver figures from China, and I wish they were as quiet, but my only comfort is, that at any rate they come home punctually to dinner at five. Nothing is so intolerable as people dropping in too late and disordering the table.""",first observe delightful change exclamation delight spring seat pull upset domino table rush room slamm door report cannon fly forest swing bonnet hand toss cap air watch draw room window say tone extreme displeasure boy have voice do town crier laugh enough crack glass room wish condemn pass week american prison allow speak short good live hammer tong child restless quicksilver figure wish quiet only comfort rate come dinner intolerable person drop late disorder table 
26,"Meantime, the woods at Holiday House rung with sounds of mirth and gaiety, while Harry scrambled up the trees like a squirrel, and swung upon the branches, gathering walnuts and crab-apples for Laura, after which they both cut their names upon the bark of Lord Rockville's favourite beech, so that every person who passed that way must observe the large distinct letters. They were laughing and chatting over this exploit, both talking at once, as noisy and happy as possible, and expecting nothing particular to happen, when, all on a sudden, Laura turned pale, and grasped hold of Harry's arm, saying, in a low frightened voice,",wood rung sound mirth gaiety scramble tree squirrel swing branch gather walnut crab apple cut name bark favourite beech person pass way observe large distinct letter laugh chat exploit talk noisy happy possible expect particular happen sudden turn pale grasp hold arm say low frighten voice 
27,"""Hush, Harry!--hush!--I hear a very strange noise. It sounds like some wild beast! What can that be?""",hear strange noise sound wild beast 
28,"Harry listened as if he had ten pair of ears, and nearly cracked his eye-balls staring round him, to see what could be the matter. A curious deep growling sound might be heard at some distance, while there was the noise of something trampling heavily on the ground, and of branches breaking off the trees, as if some large creature was forcing his way through. Harry and Laura now stood like a couple of little statues, not daring to breathe, they felt so terrified! The noise grew louder and louder, while it gradually came nearer and nearer, till at length a large black bull burst into view, with his tail standing high in the air, while he tore up the ground with his horns, bellowing as loudly as he could roar, and galloping straight towards the place where they stood.",listen have pair ear crack eye ball stare see matter curious deep growl sound hear distance be noise trample ground branch break tree large creature force way stand couple little statue dare breathe feel terrified noise grow louder louder come length large black bull burst view tail stand air tore ground horn bellow roar gallop place stand 
29,"Laura's knees tottered under her, and she instantly dropped on the ground with terror, feeling as if she would die the next minute of fright, while, as for attempting to escape, it never entered her head to think that possible. Harry felt quite differently, for he was a bold boy, not easily scared out of his senses, and instantly saw that something must be done, or they would both be lost. Many selfish people would have run away alone, without caring for the safety of any one but themselves, which was not at all the case with Harry, who thought first of his poor frightened companion. ""Hollo, Laura! are you hiding in a cart rut?"" he exclaimed, pulling her hastily off the ground. ""The bull will soon find you there! Come! come! as fast as possible! we must have a race for it yet! That terrible beast can scarcely make his way through the trees and branches, they grow so closely! Perhaps we may get on as fast as he!""",knee totter drop ground terror feel die next minute fright attempt escape enter head think possible feel bold boy scared sense see do lose many selfish person run care safety one case think first poor frighten companion hide cart rut exclaim pull ground bull find come come possible have race terrible beast make way tree branch grow get 
30,"All this time, Harry was dragging Laura along, and running himself into the thickest part of the plantation; but it was very difficult to make any progress, as she had become quite faint and bewildered with fright.",time drag run thickest part plantation difficult make progress become faint bewilder fright 
31,"""Oh, Harry!"" cried she, trembling all over, ""you must get on alone! I am so weak with terror, it is impossible to run a step farther.""",cry tremble get alone weak terror impossible run step 
32,"""Do not waste your breath with talking,"" answered Harry, still pushing on at full speed. ""How can you suppose I would be so shabby as to make my escape without you! No! no! we must either both be caught, or both get off!""",waste breath talking answer push full speed suppose shabby make escape catch get 
33,"Laura felt so grateful to Harry when he said this, that she seemed for a moment almost to forget the bull, which was still coming furiously on behind, while she now made a desperate exertion to run faster than she had been able to do before, clearing the ground almost as rapidly as Harry could have done, though he still held her firmly by the hand, to encourage her.",feel grateful say seem moment forget bull come make desperate exertion run fast able do clear ground do hold hand encourage 
34,"The trampling noise continued, the breaking of branches, and the frightful bellowing of this dreadful animal, when at last Harry caught sight of a wooden paling, which he silently pointed out to Laura, being quite unable now to speak. Having rushed forward to it, with almost frantic haste, Harry threw himself over the top, after which he helped Laura to squeeze herself through underneath, when they proceeded rather more leisurely onwards.",trampling noise continue breaking branch frightful bellowing dreadful animal last catch sight wooden paling point unable speak rush frantic haste throw top help squeeze proceed 
35,"""That fence will puzzle Mr. Bull,"" said Harry triumphantly, yet gasping for breath. ""We can push through places where his great hoof could scarcely be thrust! I saw him coming along, with his heels high in the air, and his head down, like an enormous wheel-barrow.""",fence puzzle say gasp breath push place great hoof thrust see come heel high air head enormous wheel barrow 
36,"Scarcely had Harry spoken, before the infuriated animal advanced at full gallop towards the fence, and after running along the side a little way, he suddenly tore up the paling with his horns, as if it had been made of paper, and rushed forward more rapidly than ever.",speak infuriate animal advance full gallop fence run side little way tore paling horn make paper rush 
37,"Harry now began to fear that indeed all was over, for his strength had become nearly exhausted, when, to his great joy, he espied a large, rough stone wall, not very far off, which was as welcome a sight as land to a shipwrecked sailor.",begin fear strength become exhaust great joy espy large rough stone wall welcome sight land shipwreck sailor 
38,"""Run for your life, Laura!"" he cried, pointing it out, to encourage her. ""There is safety, if we reach it.""",run life cry point encourage be safety reach 
39,"On they both flew, faster than the wind, and Harry having scrambled up the wall, like a grasshopper, pulled Laura up beside him, and there they both stood at last, encamped quite beyond the reach of danger, though the enemy arrived a few minutes afterwards, pawing the air, and foaming and bellowing with disappointment.",fly fast wind scramble wall grasshopper pull stand last encamp reach danger enemy arrive few minute paw air foam bellow disappointment 
40,"""Laura!"" said Harry, after she had a little recovered from her fright, and was walking slowly homewards, while she cast an alarmed glance frequently behind, thinking she still heard the bull in pursuit, ""you see, as uncle David says, whatever danger people are in, it is foolish to be quite in despair, but we should rather think what it is best to do, and do it directly.""",say have little recover fright walk homeward cast alarm glance think hear bull pursuit see uncle say danger person foolish despair think good do do 
41,"""Yes, Harry! and I shall never forget that you would not forsake me, but risked your own life, like a brave brother, in my defence. I should like to do as much for you another time!""",forget forsake risk own life brave brother defence like do much time 
42,"""Thank you, Laura, as much as if you had, but I hope we shall never be in such a scrape again! If Frank were here, he would put us both in mind to thank a merciful God for taking so much care of us, and bringing us safely home!""",thank have hope scrape put mind thank merciful take much care bring 
43,"""Yes, Harry! It is perhaps a good thing being in danger sometimes, to remind us that we cannot be safe or happy an hour without God's care, so in our prayers to-night we must remember what has happened, and return thanks very particularly.""",good thing danger remind safe happy hour care prayer night remember happen return thanks 
44,"It was long past five before Harry and Laura reached Holiday House, where Lord Rockville met them at the drawing-room door, looking taller, and grander, and graver than ever, while Lady Rockville rose from her sofa, and came up to them, saying, in a tone of gentle reproach,",long past reach meet draw room door look tall grander graver rise sofa come say tone gentle reproach 
45,"""My dear children! you ought to return home before the dinner hour, and not keep his Lordship waiting!""",dear child return dinner hour keep lordship waiting 
46,"The very idea of Lord Rockville waiting dinner was too dreadful ever to have entered their heads till this minute; but Harry and Laura immediately explained how exceedingly sorry they were for what had occurred, and to show that it was their misfortune rather than their fault, they told the whole frightful story of the mad bull, to which Lady Rockville listened, as if her very hair were standing upon end, to hear of such doings. She even turned up her eyes with astonishment to think what a wonderful escape they had made; but his Lordship frowned through his spectacles, and leaned his chin upon his stick, looking, as Harry thought, very like a bear upon a pole.",very idea wait dinner dreadful enter head minute explain sorry occur show misfortune fault tell whole frightful story mad bull listen very hair stand end hear such doing turn eye astonishment think wonderful escape make frown spectacle learn chin stick look think bear pole 
47,"""Pshaw!--nonsense!"" exclaimed Lord Rockville impatiently. ""The bull would have done you no harm! He is a most respectable, quiet, well-disposed animal, and brought an excellent character from his last place! I never heard a complaint of him before!""",nonsense exclaim bull do harm respectable quiet dispose animal bring excellent character last place hear complaint 
48,"""It is curious,"" observed Laura, ""that all bulls are reckoned peaceable and tame, till they have tossed two or three people, and killed them!""",curious observe bull reckon peaceable tame toss person kill 
49,"""I thought,"" added Lord Rockville, looking very grand and contemptuous, ""that Harry was grown more a man than to be so easily put to flight. When a bull, another time, threatens to toss you, seize hold of his tail,--or toss him!--or, in short, do anything rather than run away the first time an animal looks at you. This is a mere cock-and-a-bull story, to excuse your keeping me waiting almost a quarter of an hour for my dinner!--you should be made guard of a mail-coach for a month, to teach you punctuality, Master Graham.""",think add look grand contemptuous grow man put flight bull time threaten toss seize hold tail toss short do run first time animal look mere cock bull story excuse keep wait quarter hour dinner make guard mail coach month teach punctuality 
50,"Lord Rockville gravely looked at his watch, while Harry luckily considered how often his grandmama had recommended him to make no answer when he was scolded, so he nearly bit off the tip of his tongue to keep it quiet, while he could not but wish, in his own mind, that my Lord himself saw how very fierce the bull had looked.",look watch consider grandmama recommend make answer scold bite tip tongue keep quiet wish own mind see fierce bull look 
51,"Laura felt more vexed on Harry's account than her own, and the dinner went on as uncomfortably as possible; for even when a French cook has dressed it, if ill-humour be the sauce, any dish becomes unpalatable. Nothing was to be seen reflected on the surface of many fine silver covers, but very cross, or very melancholy faces; while Lady Rockville tried to make her own countenance look both cheerful and good-natured. She told Harry and Laura, to divert them, that old Mrs. Bouverie had once been pursued by a furious milch cow, along a lane, flanked on both sides by such very high walls, that escape seemed impossible, so the good lady, who was fat and breathless, became so desperate, that without a hope of getting off, she seized the enraged animal by the horns, and screamed in its face, till the cow herself became frightened. The creature stared, stepping backwards and backwards, with increasing alarm, till at last, to the old lady's great relief and surprise, she fairly turned her tail and ran off.",feel vex account own dinner go possible french cook dress ill humour sauce dish become unpalatable see reflect surface many fine silver cover cross melancholy face try make own countenance look cheerful good natured tell divert old pursue furious milch cow lane flank side such high wall escape seem impossible good lady fat breathless become desperate hope get seize enrage animal horn scream face cow become frighten creature stare step increase alarm last old lady great relief surprise turn tail run 
52,"In the evening, Lord Rockville had not yet recovered his equanimity, and went out, rather in bad humour, to take his usual walk before supper. Without once remembering about Harry and the bull, he strolled a great way into the woods, marking several trees to be cut down, and admiring a fine forest which he had planted himself long ago, but without particularly considering what way he turned. It was beginning, at last, to grow very dark and gloomy, so Lord Rockville had some thoughts of returning home, when he became suddenly startled by hearing a loud roar not far off, and a moment afterwards the furious bull dashed out of a neighbouring thicket, raging and foaming, and tearing the ground with his horns, exactly as Harry had described in the morning, while poor Lord Rockville, who seldom moved faster than a very dignified walk, instantly quickened his pace, in an opposite direction, striding away faster and faster, till at last,--it must be confessed,--his Lordship ended by running!!!",evening recover equanimity go bad humour take usual walk supper remember bull stroll great way wood mark several tree cut admire fine forest plant consider way turn begin last grow dark gloomy have thought return become startle hear loud roar moment furious bull dash neighbour thicket rage foam tear ground horn describe morning poor move fast dignified walk quicken pace opposite direction strid fast fast last confess end run 
53,"In spite of all Lord Rockville's exertions, the bull continued rapidly to gain upon him, for his Lordship, being rather corpulent and easily fatigued, stopped every now and then to gasp for breath; till at last, feeling it impossible to get on faster, though the stables were now within sight, he seized the branch of a large oak tree, which swept nearly to the ground, and contrived, with great difficulty, to scramble out of reach.",spite exertion bull continue gain corpulent fatigued stop gasp breath last feel impossible get fast stable sight seize branch large oak tree sweep ground contrive great difficulty scramble reach 
54,"The enraged bull gazed up into the tree and bellowed with fury, when he saw Lord Rockville so judiciously perched overhead, and he remained for half-an-hour, watching to see if his Lordship would venture down again. At last the tormenting animal began leisurely eating grass under the tree, but gradually he moved away, turning his back while he fed, till Lord Rockville vainly deluded himself with the hope of stealing off unobserved. Being somewhat rested and refreshed, while the enemy was looking in another direction, he descended cautiously, as if he had been going to tread upon needles and pins; but, unaccustomed to such movements, he jumped so heavily upon the ground, that the bull hearing a noise, turned round, and set up a loud furious roar, when he saw his intended victim again within reach.",enrage bull gaze tree bellow fury see perch remain half hour watch see lordship venture last torment animal begin eat grass tree move turn back feed delude hope steal unobserved rest refresh enemy look direction descend go tread needle pin unaccustomed such movement jump ground bull hear noise turn set loud furious roar see intend victim reach 
55,"Now the race began once more with redoubled agility! The odds seemed greatly in favour of the bull, and Lord Rockville thought he already felt the animal's horns in his side, when a groom, who saw the party approaching, instantly seized a pitchfork and flew to the rescue of his master. Lord Rockville never stopped his career till he reached the stable, and ran up into a loft, from the window of which he gave the alarm and called for more assistance, when several ploughmen and stable-boys assembled, who drove the animal with great difficulty, into a stall, where he continued so ungovernable, that iron chains were put round his neck, and some days afterwards, seeing no one could manage him, Lord Rockville ordered the bull to be shot, and his carcase turned into beef for the poor of the parish, who all, consequently, rejoiced at his demise; though the meat turned out so tough, that it required their best teeth to eat it with.",race begin more redoubl agility odd seem favour bull think feel animal horn side groom see party approach seize pitchfork fly rescue master stop career reach stable run loft window give alarm call more assistance several ploughmen stable boy assemble drive animal great difficulty stall continue ungovernable iron chain put neck day see manage order bull shoot carcase turn beef poor parish rejoice demise meat turn tough require good tooth eat 
56,"Meantime, on that memorable evening of so many adventures, Harry, Laura, and Lady Rockville, wondered often what had become of his Lordship, and, at last, when supper appeared at the usual hour, his absence became still more unaccountable!",memorable evening many adventure wonder become last supper appear usual hour absence become unaccountable 
57,"""What can be the matter?"" exclaimed Lady Rockville, anxiously. ""This is very odd! His Lordship is as punctual as the postman in general! especially for supper; and here is Lord Rockville's favourite dish of sago and wine, which will become uneatably cold in ten minutes, if he does not return home to enjoy it!""",matter exclaim odd lordship punctual postman general supper favourite dish sago wine become cold minute return enjoy 
58,"Scarcely had she finished speaking, when the door opened and Lord Rockville walked majestically into the room. There was something so different from usual in his manner and appearance, however, that Harry and Laura exchanged looks of astonishment; his neckcloth was loose--his face excessively red--and his hand shook, while he breathed so hard, that he might have been heard at the porter's lodge. Lady Rockville gazed with amazement at all she saw, and then asked what he chose for supper; but when Lord Rockville tried to speak, the words died on his lips, so he could only point in silence to the sago and wine.",finish speak door open walk room be different usual manner appearance exchange look astonishment neckcloth loose face red hand shake breathe hear porter lodge gaze amazement see ask choose supper try speak word die lip point silence sago wine 
59,"""What in all the world has happened to you this evening, my Lord?"" exclaimed Lady Rockville, unable to restrain her curiosity a moment longer. ""I never saw you in such a way before! Your eyes are perfectly blood-shot--your dress strangely disordered--and you seem so hot and so fatigued! Tell me!--what is the matter?""",world happen evening exclaim unable restrain curiosity moment see way eye blood shot dress disorder seem hot fatigued tell matter 
60,"""Nothing!"" answered Lord Rockville, drawing himself up, while he tried to look grander and graver than ever, though his Lordship could not help panting for breath--putting his hands to his sides--and wiping his forehead with his pocket-handkerchief in an agony of fatigue. Harry observed all this for some time, as eagerly and intently as a cat watches a bird on a tree. He saw that something extraordinary had occurred, and he began to have hopes that it really was the very thing he wished; because, seeing Lord Rockville now perfectly safe, he would not have grudged him a pretty considerable fright from his friend the bull. At last, unable any longer to control his impatience, Harry started off his chair, gazing so earnestly at Lord Rockville, that his eyes almost sprung out of their sockets, while he rubbed his hands with ecstacy, saying,",answer draw try look grander graver lordship help pant breath put hand side wipe forehead pocket handkerchief agony fatigue observe time cat watch bird tree see extraordinary occur begin have hope very thing wish see safe grudge considerable fright friend bull last unable control impatience start chair gaze eye spring socket rub hand ecstacy say
