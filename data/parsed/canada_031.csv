1,CHAPTER XXXI.,
2," Thus in one short day was the family of Mr. Campbell changed from a house of joy to one of mourning. And true was the remark of Malachi, that misfortunes seldom come single, for now they had another cause of anxiety. Emma, by her imprudent exposure to the intense chill of the night air and the wetting of her feet, was first taken with a violent cold, which was followed by a fever, which became more alarming every day. Thus, in addition to the loss of one of their children, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were threatened with being deprived of two more; for their nieces were regarded as such, and Alfred was in a very precarious state. The wounds had assumed such an angry appearance, that Mr. Campbell was fearful of mortification. This accumulated distress had, however, one good effect upon them. The danger of losing Emma and Alfred so occupied their minds and their attention, that they had not time to bewail the loss of Percival; and even Mrs. Campbell, in her prayers, was enabled to resign herself to the Almighty's will in taking away her child, if it would but please Him to spare the two others who were afflicted. Long and tedious were the hours, the days, and the weeks that passed away before either of them could be considered in a state of convalescence; but when her prayers were heard, and, as the winter closed, their recovery was no longer doubtful. A melancholy winter it had been to them all, but the joy of once more seeing Emma resume her duties, and Alfred, supported on cushions, able to be moved into the sitting-room, had a very exhilarating effect upon their spirits. True, there was no longer the mirth and merriment that once reigned, but there was a subdued gratitude to Heaven, which, if it did not make them at once cheerful, at least prevented any thing like repining or complaint. Grateful for the mercies vouchsafed to them, in having Alfred and Emma spared to them, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell consoled themselves in reference to Percival, with the reflection that, at so early an age, before he had lived to be corrupted by the world, to die was gain,--and that their dear boy had become, through Divine grace, an inhabitant of the kingdom of Heaven. By degrees the family became cheerful and happy; the merry laugh of Emma once more enlivened them, Alfred again recovered his former health and spirits, and Mrs. Campbell could bear the mention of the name of Percival, and join in the praises of the amiable child.",short day family change house joy mourn true remark misfortune come single have cause anxiety imprudent exposure intense chill night air wetting foot take violent cold follow fever become alarming day addition loss child threaten deprive more niece regard such precarious state wound assume angry appearance fearful mortification accumulate distress good effect danger lose occupy mind attention have time bewail loss prayer enable resign will take child spare other afflict long tedious hour day week pass consider state convalescence prayer hear winter close recovery doubtful melancholy winter joy see resume duty support cushion able move sitting room have exhilarating effect spirit true be mirth merriment reign be subdued gratitude make cheerful least prevent thing repining complaint grateful mercie vouchsafe have spare console reference reflection age live corrupt world die gain dear boy become divine grace inhabitant kingdom degree family become cheerful happy merry laugh enliven recover former health spirit bear mention name join praise amiable child 
3,"The spring now came on, the snow gradually disappeared, the ice was carried down the rapids, and once more left the blue lake clear; the cattle were turned out to feed off the grass the year before left on the prairie, and all the men were busy in preparing to put in the seed. As soon as the snow was gone, Malachi, Martin and Alfred, without saying a word to Mrs. Campbell, had gone into the forest, and made search for the body of poor Percival, but without success, and it was considered that he had wandered and died on some spot which they could not discover, or that the wolves had dug his remains out of the snow, and devoured them. Not a trace of him could any where be discovered; and the search was, after a few days, discontinued. The return of the spring had another good effect upon the spirits of the party; for, with the spring came on such a variety of work to be done, that they had not a moment to spare. They had now so many acres for corn, that they had scarcely time to get through all the preparatory work, and fortunate it was that Alfred was so much recovered that he could join in the labor. Malachi, John, and even Mr. Campbell, assisted, and at last the task was completed. Then they had a communication with the fort, and letters from Quebec, Montreal, and England: there were none of any importance from England, but one from Montreal informed Mr. Campbell, that, agreeably to contract, the engineer would arrive in the course of the month, with the _bateaux_ containing the machinery, and that the water-mill would be erected as soon as possible. There was also a letter from England, which gave them great pleasure; it was from Captain Sinclair to Alfred, informing him that he had arranged all his business with his guardian, and that he should rejoin his regiment and be at the fort early in the spring, as he should sail in the first vessel which left England. He stated how delighted he should be at his return, and told him to say to Emma that he had not found an English wife, as she had prophesied, but was coming back as heart-whole as he went. Very soon afterward they had a visit from Colonel Forster and some of the officers of the garrison. The Colonel offered Mr. Campbell a party of soldiers to assist in raising the mill, and the offer was thankfully accepted.",spring come snow disappear ice carry rapid leave blue lake clear cattle turn feed grass year leave prairie man busy prepare put seed snow gone say word go forest make search body poor success consider wander die spot discover wolf dig remains snow devoure trace discover search few day discontinue return spring have good effect spirit party spring come variety work do have moment spare have many acre corn have time get preparatory work fortunate recover join labor assist last task complete have communication fort letter be importance inform contract engineer arrive course month _bateaux_ contain machinery water mill erect possible be letter give great pleasure inform arrange business guardian rejoin regiment fort spring sail first vessel leave state delighted return tell say find english wife prophesy come heart whole go have visit officer garrison offer party soldier assist raise mill offer accept 
4,"""We were very much alarmed about you last autumn, when the woods were on fire, Mr. Campbell,"" said the Colonel; ""but I perceive that it has been of great advantage to you. You have now a large quantity of cleared land sown with seed, and if you had possessed sufficient means, might have had much more put in, as I perceive all the land to the north-west is cleared by the fire.""",alarmed last autumn wood fire say perceive great advantage have large quantity clear land sow seed possess sufficient means have put perceive land north west clear fire 
5,"""Yes,"" replied Mr. Campbell; ""but my allotment, as you know, extends along the beach, and we have sown the seed as far from the beach as the property extends.""",reply allotment know extend beach sow seed beach property extend 
6,"""Then I should recommend you to write to Quebec, and apply for another grant on each side of the stream; indeed, at the back of and equal to what you now have.""",recommend write apply grant side stream back equal have 
7,"""But if I do, I have not the means of working the land.""",have means work land 
8,"""No, not with your present force, I grant; but there are many emigrants who would be glad of work, and who would settle here upon favorable conditions.""",present force grant be many emigrant glad work settle favorable condition 
9,"""The expense would be very great,"" said Mr. Campbell.",expense great say 
10,"""It would; but the return would indemnify you. The troops at the fort would take all the flour off your hands, if you had ever so much.""",return indemnify troops fort take flour hand have much 
11,"""I am not inclined at present to speculate much further,"" replied Mr. Campbell, ""but I shall see how this year turns out, and if I find that I am successful, I will then decide.""",inclined present speculate reply see year turn find successful decide 
12,"""Of course, you will but act prudently. You can send down to your agent at Quebec, and ascertain what would be the probable terms of the men you might require. But there is another way, which is to give them the land to cultivate, and the seed, and to receive from them a certain portion of corn in return, as rent; that is very safe, and your land will be all gradually brought into cultivation, besides the advantage of having neighbors about you. You might send one of your sons down to Montreal, and arrange all that.""",course act send agent ascertain probable term man require be way give land cultivate seed receive certain portion corn return rent safe land bring cultivation advantage have neighbor send son arrange 
13,"""I certainly will write to my agent and institute inquiries,"" replied Mr. Campbell, ""and many thanks to you for the suggestion; I have still a few hundred at the bank to dispose of, if necessary.""",write agent institute inquiry reply many thanks suggestion have few bank dispose necessary 
14,"About three weeks after this conversation, the _bateaux_ arrived with the engineer and machinery for the flour and saw-mills: and now the settlement again presented a lively scene, being thronged with the soldiers who were sent from the fort. The engineer was a very pleasant, intelligent young Englishman, who had taken up his profession in Canada, and was considered one of the most able in the colony. The site of the mill was soon chosen, and now the axes again resounded in the woods, as the trees were felled and squared under his directions. Alfred was constantly with the engineer, superintending the labor of the men, and contracted a great intimacy with him; indeed, that gentleman was soon on such a footing with the whole family, as to be considered almost as one of them, for he was very amusing, very well bred, and had evidently received every advantage of education. Mr. Campbell found that Mr. Emmerson, for such was his name, could give him every particular relative to the emigrants who had come out, as he was so constantly traveling about the country, and was in such constant communication with them.",week conversation arrive engineer machinery flour see mill settlement present lively scene throng soldier send fort engineer pleasant intelligent young englishman take profession consider able colony site mill choose axe resound wood tree fell square direction engineer superintend labor man contract great intimacy gentleman footing whole family consider amusing breed receive advantage education find such name give particular relative emigrant come travel country such constant communication 
15,"""You are very fortunate in your purchase,"" said he to Mr. Campbell; ""the land is excellent, and you have a good water-power in the stream, as well as convenient carriage by the lake. Fifty years hence this property will be worth a large sum of money.""",fortunate purchase say land excellent have good water power stream convenient carriage lake year property worth large sum money 
16,"""I want very much to get some more emigrants to settle here,"" observed Mr. Campbell. ""It would add to our security and comfort; and I have not sufficient hands to cultivate the land which has been cleared by the fire of last autumn. If not cultivated in a short time, it will be all forest again.""",want much get more emigrant settle observe add security comfort have sufficient hand cultivate land clear fire last autumn cultivate short time forest 
17,"""At present it is all raspberries, and very good ones too, are they not, Mr. Emmerson?"" said Emma.",present raspberry good one say 
18,"""Yes, miss, most excellent,"" replied he; ""but you are aware that, whenever you cut down trees here, and do not hoe the ground to sow it, raspberry bushes grow up immediately.""",miss excellent reply aware cut tree hoe ground sow raspberry bush grow 
19,"""Indeed, I was not aware of it.""",aware 
20,"""Such is the case, nevertheless. After the raspberries, the seedling hardwood trees spring up, and, as Mr. Campbell says, they soon grow into a forest again.""",such case raspberry seedling hardwood tree spring say grow forest 
21,"""I do not think that you would have much trouble in getting emigrants to come here, Mr. Campbell, but the difficulty will be in persuading them to remain. Their object in coming out to this country is to obtain land of their own, and become independent. Many of them have not the means to go on, and, as a temporary resource, are compelled to act as laborers; but the moment that they get sufficient to purchase for themselves, they will leave you.""",think have much trouble get emigrant come difficulty persuade remain object come country obtain land own become independent many have means go temporary resource compel act laborer moment sufficient purchase leave 
22,"""That is very natural; but I have been thinking of obtaining a larger grant than I have now, and I wish very much that I could make an arrangement with some emigrants. The Colonel says that I might do so by supplying them with seed, and taking corn in return as rent.""",natural think obtain large grant have wish make arrangement emigrant say do supply seed take corn return rent 
23,"""That would not be a permanent arrangement,"" replied Mr. Emmerson. ""How much land, do you propose applying for?""",permanent arrangement reply much land propose apply 
24,"""Six hundred acres.""",acre 
25,"""Well, sir, I think it would meet the views of both parties if you were to offer terms like the following--that is, divide the land into lots of one hundred acres each, and allow them to cultivate for you the fifty acres that adjoin your own land, with the right of purchasing the other fifty as their own property, as soon as they can. You will then obtain three hundred acres of the most valuable land, in addition to your present farm, and have fixed neighbors around you, even after they are enabled to purchase the other fifty.""",sir think meet view party offer term follow divide land lot acre allow cultivate acre adjoin own land right purchase other own property obtain acre valuable land addition present farm have fix neighbor enable purchase other 
26,"""I think that a very good arrangement, Mr. Emmerson, and I would gladly consent to it.""",think good arrangement consent

28,"""And with such expectations I will apply for the additional grant,"" said Mr. Campbell, ""for to have neighbors in this solitude, I would almost make them a present of the land.""",such expectation apply additional grant say have neighbor solitude make present land 
29,"""I suspect that in a few years you will have neighbors enough, without resorting to such an expedient,"" replied Mr. Emmerson, ""but according to your present proposal, they may be better selected, and you may make terms which will prevent any nuisances.""",suspect few year have neighbor resort expedient reply accord present proposal select make term prevent nuisance 
30,"The works at the mill proceeded rapidly, and before the hay-harvest the mill was complete. Alfred was very careful, and paid every attention to what was going on, and so did Martin, that they might understand the machinery. This was very simple. Mr. Emmerson tried the mill, and found it to answer well. He explained every thing to Alfred, and put the mill to work, that he might be fully master of it. As it was a fortnight after the mill was at work before Mr. Emmerson could obtain a passage back to Montreal, Alfred and Martin worked both mills during that time, and felt satisfied that they required no further instruction. The soldiers, at the request of Mr. Campbell, were allowed to remain till the hay-harvest, and as soon as the hay was gathered in, they were paid and returned to the fort. Captain Sinclair, who, from his letter, had been expected to arrive much sooner, came just as the soldiers had left the farm. It need hardly be said that he was received most warmly. He had a great deal to tell them, and had brought out a great many presents; those for poor little Percival he kept back, of course. Emma and Mary were delighted to have him again as a companion, and to resume their walks with him; a fortnight thus passed away very quickly, when his leave of absence expired, and he was obliged to return to the fort. Previous, however, to his going away, he requested a private interview with Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, in which he stated his exact position and his means, and requested their sanction to his paying his addresses to Mary. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, who had already perceived the attentions he had shown to her, did not hesitate to express their satisfaction at his request, and their best wishes for his success; and having so done, they left him to forward his own suit, which Captain Sinclair did not fail to do that very evening, Mary Percival was too amiable and right-minded a girl not at once to refuse or accept Captain Sinclair. As she had long been attached to him she did not deny that such was the case, and Captain Sinclair was overjoyed at his success.",work mill proceed hay harvest mill complete careful pay attention go do understand machinery simple try mill find answer explain thing put mill work master fortnight mill work obtain passage work mill time feel satisfied require further instruction soldier request allow remain hay harvest hay gather pay return fort letter expect arrive come soldier leave farm need say receive most have great deal tell bring great many present poor little keep course delight have companion resume walk fortnight pass leave absence expire oblige return fort previous go request private interview state exact position means request sanction pay address perceive attention show hesitate express satisfaction request good wish success do leave forward own suit fail do very evening amiable right minded girl refuse accept attach deny such case overjoy success

34,"""And what is that?""",
35,"""It is that, under present circumstances, I must not think of leaving my uncle and aunt. I have been bred up and educated by them; I have as an orphan shared their prosperity; I have a deep debt of gratitude to pay, and I can not consent to return to England to enjoy all the advantages which your means will afford, while they remain in their present isolated position.

39,"""I trust you will not hesitate, but determine to adhere steadily to your profession for the present, Captain Sinclair.

43,"""We are both very young, Captain Sinclair,"" observed Mary; ""in a year or two, my uncle and aunt may be less lonely and more comfortable than at present. In a year or two the war may end, and you may honorably retire upon half-pay; in fact, so many chances are there which are hidden from us and come upon us so unexpectedly, that it is impossible to say what may take place. And if, after waiting patiently for some time, none of these chances do turn up, you have yet another in your favor.""",young observe year uncle aunt lonely comfortable present year war end retire half pay fact many chance hide come impossible say take place wait time chance turn have favor
