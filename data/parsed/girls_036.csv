1,CHAPTER 36. HOW MOSES MOORE KEPT HIS APPOINTMENT.,kept appointment 
2,"Susan Drummond got back to Lavender House without apparent discovery. She was certainly late when she took her place in the class-room for her next day's preparation; but, beyond a very sharp reprimand from Mademoiselle, no notice was taken of this fact.  She managed to whisper to Nora and Phyllis that the basket would be moved by the first dawn the next morning, and the little girls went to bed happier in consequence. Nothing ever could disturb Susan's slumbers, and that night she certainly slept without rocking.  As she was getting into bed she ventured to tell Annie how successfully she had manoeuvred; but Annie received her news with the most absolute indifference, looking at her for a moment with a queer smile, and then saying--",get apparent discovery late take place class room next day preparation sharp reprimand notice take fact manage whisper basket move first dawn next morning little girl go bed happy consequence disturb slumber night sleep rock get bed venture tell manoeuvr receive news absolute indifference look moment queer smile say 
3,"""My own wish is that this should be found out.  As a matter of course, I sha'n't betray you, girls; but as things now stand I am anxious that Mrs Willis should know the very worst of me.""",own wish find matter course betray girl thing stand anxious know bad 
4,"After a remark which Susan considered so simply idiotic, there was, of course, no further conversation between the two girls.",remark consider idiotic be course further conversation girl 
5,"Moses Moore had certainly promised Betty to rise soon after dawn on the following morning and go to Lavender House to carry off the basket from under the laurel-tree.  Moses, a remarkably indolent lad, had been stimulated by the thought of the delicious cherries which would be his as soon as he brought the basket to Betty.  He had cleverly stipulated that a quart--not a pint--of cherries was to be his reward, and he looked forward with considerable pleasure to picking them himself, and putting a few extra ones into his mouth on the sly.",promise rise dawn follow morning go carry basket laurel tree indolent lad stimulate thought delicious cherry bring basket stipulate quart pint cherry reward look considerable pleasure pick put few extra one mouth sly 
6,"Moses was not at all the kind of boy who would have scrupled to steal a few cherries; but in this particular old Betty, ill as she was, was too sharp for him, or for any of the other village lads.  Her bed was drawn up close to her little window, and her window looked directly on to the two cherry trees.  Never, to all appearance, did Betty close her eyes. However early the hour might be in which a village boy peeped over the wall of her garden, he always saw her white night-cap moving, and he knew that her bright blue eyes would be on him, and he would be proclaimed a thief all over the place before many minutes were over.",kind boy scruple steal few cherry particular old ill sharp other village lad bed draw close little window window look cherry tree appearance close eye hour village boy peep wall garden see white night cap move know bright blue eye proclaim thief place many minute 
7,"Moses, therefore, was very glad to secure his cherries by fair means, as he could not obtain them by foul; and he went to bed and to sleep determined to be off on his errand with the dawn.",glad secure cherry fair means obtain foul go bed sleep determined errand dawn 
8,"A very natural thing, however, happened.  Moses, unaccustomed to getting up at half-past three in the morning, never opened his eyes until the church clock struck five.  Then he started upright, rubbed and rubbed at his sleepy orbs, tumbled into his clothes, and, softly opening the cottage door, set off on his errand.",natural thing happen unaccustom get half morning open eye church clock strike start rub rub sleepy orb tumble clothes open cottage door set errand 
9,"The fact of his being nearly an hour and a half late did not trouble him in the least.  In any case, he would get to Lavender House before six o'clock, and would have consumed his cherries in less than an hour from that date.",fact hour half trouble least case get o'clock consume cherry less hour date 
10,"Moses sauntered gayly along the roads, whistling as he went, and occasionally tossing his battered cap in the air.  He often lingered on his way, now to cut down a particularly tempting switch from the hedge, now to hunt for a possible bird's nest.  It was very, nearly six o'clock when he reached the back avenue, swung himself over the gate, which was locked, and ran softly on the dewy grass in the direction of the laurel-bush.  Old Betty had given him most careful instructions, and he was far too sharp a lad to forget what was necessary for the obtaining of a quart of cherries.  He found his tree, and lay flat down on the ground in order to pull out the basket.  His fingers had just clasped the handle when there came a sudden interruption--a rush, a growl, and some very sharp teeth had inserted themselves into the back of his ragged jacket.  Poor Moses found himself, to his horror, in the clutches of a great mastiff.  The creature held him tight, and laid one heavy paw on him to prevent him rising.",saunter road whistle go toss batter cap air linger way cut tempting switch hedge hunt possible bird nest o'clock reach back avenue swing gate lock run dewy grass direction laurel bush old give careful instruction sharp lad forget necessary obtain quart cherry find tree lay flat ground order pull basket finger clasp handle come sudden interruption rush growl sharp tooth insert back ragged jacket poor find horror clutch great mastiff creature hold tight lay heavy paw prevent rise 
11,"Under these circumstances, Moses thought it quite unnecessary to retain any self-control.  He shrieked, he screamed, he wriggled; his piercing yells filled the air, and, fortunately for him, his being two hours too late brought assistance to his aid.  Michael, the gardener, and a strong boy who helped him, rushed to the spot, and liberated the terrified lad, who, after all, was only frightened, for Rover had satisfied himself with tearing his jacket to pieces, not himself.",circumstance think unnecessary retain self control shriek scream wriggle piercing yell fill air hour bring assistance aid gardener strong boy help rush spot liberate terrified lad frighten satisfy tear jacket piece 
12,"""Give me the b-basket,"" sobbed Moses, ""and let me g-g-go.""",give benefit basket sobb let geg go 
13,"""You may certainly go, you little tramp,"" said Michael, ""but Jim and me will keep the basket.  I much misdoubt me if there isn't mischief here. What's the basket put hiding here for, and who does it belong to?""",go little tramp say keep basket misdoubt be mischief basket put hide belong 
14,"""Old B-B-Betty,"" gasped forth the agitated Moses.",old gasp agitate 
15,"""Well, let old Betty fetch it herself.  Mrs Willis will keep it for her,"" said Michael.  ""Come along, Jim, get to your weeding, do.  There, little scamp, you had better make yourself scarce.""",let old fetch keep say come get weeding do little scamp good make scarce 
16,"Moses certainly look his advice, for he scuttled off like a hare. Whether he ever got his cherries or not, history does not disclose.",look advice scuttle hare get cherry history disclose 
17,"Michael, looking gravely at Jim, opened the basket, examined its contents, and, shaking his head solemnly, carried it into the house.",look open basket examine content shake head carry house 
18,"""There's been deep work going on, Jim, and my Missis ought to know,"" said Michael, who was an exceedingly strict disciplinarian.  Jim, however, had a soft corner in his heart for the young ladies, and he commenced his weeding with a profound sigh.",be deep work go know say strict disciplinarian have soft corner heart young lady commence weeding profound sigh
