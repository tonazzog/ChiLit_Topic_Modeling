2," It was not the last time that Jessica concealed herself behind the baize-covered door. She could not overcome the urgent desire to enjoy again and again the secret and perilous pleasure, and Sunday after Sunday she watched in the dark streets for the moment when she could slip in unseen. She soon learned the exact time when Daniel would be occupied in lighting up, before the policeman would take up his station at the entrance, and again, the very minute at which it would be wise and safe to take her departure. Sometimes the child laughed noiselessly to herself until she shook with suppressed merriment, as she saw Daniel standing unconsciously, in the lobby, with his solemn face and grave air, to receive the congregation, much as he faced his customers at the coffee-stall. She learned to know the minister by sight, the tall, thin, pale gentleman who passed through a side door, with his head bent as if in deep thought, while two little girls, about her own age, followed him with sedate yet pleasant faces. Jessica took a great interest in the minister’s children. The younger one was fair, and the elder was about as tall as herself, and had eyes and hair as dark; but oh, how cared for, how plainly waited on by tender hands! Sometimes, when they were gone by, she would close her eyes, and wonder what they would do in one of the high black pews inside, where there was no place for a ragged barefooted girl like her; and now and then her wonderings almost ended in a sob, which she was compelled to stifle.",last time conceal baize cover door overcome urgent desire enjoy secret perilous pleasure watch dark street moment slip unseen learn exact time occupy light policeman take station entrance very minute wise safe take departure child laugh shake suppress merriment see stand lobby solemn face grave air receive congregation much face customer coffee stall learn know minister sight tall thin pale gentleman pass side door head bend deep thought little girl own age follow sedate pleasant face take great interest minister child young one fair elder tall have eye hair dark care wait tender hand go close eye wonder do high black pew be place ragged barefoot girl wondering end sob compel stifle 
3,"It was an untold relief to Daniel that Jessica did not ply him with questions, as he feared, when she came for breakfast every Wednesday morning; but she was too shrewd and cunning for that. She wished him to forget that she had ever been there, and by-and-by her wish was accomplished, and Daniel was no longer uneasy, while he was lighting the lamps, with the dread of seeing the child’s wild face starting up before him.",untold relief ply question fear come breakfast morning shrewd cunning wish forget wish accomplish uneasy light lamp dread see child wild face start 
4,"But the light evenings of summer-time were drawing near apace, and Jessica foresaw with dismay that her Sunday treats would soon be over. The risk of discovery increased every week, for the sun was later in setting, and there would be no chance of creeping in and out unseen in the broad daylight. Already it needed both watchfulness and alertness to dart in at the right moment in the gray twilight; but still she could not give it up; and if it had not been for the fear of offending Mr. Daniel, she would have resolved upon going until she was found out. They could not punish her very much for standing in the lobby of a chapel.",light evening summer time draw foresee dismay treat risk discovery increase week sun setting be chance creep unseen broad daylight need watchfulness alertness dart right moment gray twilight give fear offend resolve go find punish stand lobby chapel 
5,"Jessica was found out, however, before the dusky evenings were quite gone. It happened one night that the minister’s children, coming early to the chapel, saw a small tattered figure, bareheaded and barefooted, dart swiftly up the steps before them and disappear within the lobby. They paused and looked at one another, and then, hand in hand, their hearts beating quickly, and the color coming and going on their faces, they followed this strange new member of their father’s congregation. The pew-opener was nowhere to be seen, but their quick eyes detected the prints of the wet little feet which had trodden the clean pavement before them, and in an instant they discovered Jessica crouching behind the door.",find dusky evening gone happen night minister child come chapel see small tatter figure barehead barefoot dart step disappear lobby pause look hand hand heart beat color come go face follow strange new member father congregation pew opener see quick eye detect print wet little foot trodd clean pavement instant discover crouch door 
6,"“Let us call Daniel Standring,” said Winny, the younger child, clinging to her sister; but she had spoken aloud and Jessica overheard her, and before they could stir a step she stood before them with an earnest and imploring face.",let call say young child cling sister speak overhear stir step stand earnest implor face 
7,"“Oh, don’t have me drove away,” she cried; “I’m a very poor little girl, and it’s all the pleasure I’ve got. I’ve seen you lots of times, with that tall gentleman as stoops, and I didn’t think you’d have me drove away. I don’t do any harm behind the door, and if Mr. Daniel finds me out he wont give me any more coffee.”",have drive cry poor little girl pleasure get see lot time tall gentleman stoop think have drive do harm door find give more coffee

9,"“I like to hear the music,” answered Jessica, “and I want to find out what pray is, and the minister, and God. I know it’s only for ladies and gentlemen, and fine children like you; but I’d like to go inside, just for once, and see what you do.”",like hear music answer want find pray minister know lady gentleman fine child like go see do 
10,"“You shall come with us into our pew,” cried Winny, in an eager and impulsive tone; but Jane laid her hand upon her outstretched arm, with a glance at Jessica’s ragged clothes and matted hair. It was a question difficult enough to perplex them. The little outcast was plainly too dirty and neglected for them to invite her to sit side by side with them in their crimson-lined pew, and no poor people attended the chapel with whom she could have a seat. But Winny, with flushed cheeks and indignant eyes, looked reproachfully at her elder sister.",come pew cry eager impulsive tone lay hand outstretched arm glance ragge clothes matt hair question difficult perplex little outcast dirty neglect invite sit side side crimson line pew poor person attend chapel have seat flush cheek indignant eye look elder sister 
11,"“Jane,” she said, opening her Testament, and turning over the leaves hurriedly, “this was papa’s text a little while ago: ‘For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool; are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?’ If we don’t take this little girl into our pew we ‘have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.’”",say open turn leave text little while come assembly man gold ring goodly apparel come poor man vile raiment have respect weareth gay clothing say sit good place say poor stand sit footstool partial become judge evil thought take little girl pew have faith glory respect person 
12,"“I don’t know what to do,” answered Jane, sighing; “the Bible seems plain, but I’m sure papa would not like it. Let us ask the chapel-keeper.”",know do answer sigh seem plain sure papa like let ask chapel keeper 
13,"“Oh, no, no!” cried Jessica, “don’t let Mr. Daniel catch me here. I wont come again, indeed; and I’ll promise not to try to find out about God and the minister, if you’ll only let me go.”",cry let catch come promise try find minister let go 
14,"“But, little girl,” said Jane, in a sweet but grave manner, “we ought to teach you about God, if you don’t know him. Our papa is the minister, and if you’ll come with us we’ll ask him what we must do.”",little girl say sweet grave manner teach know papa minister come ask do

16,"“Nobody but papa is in the vestry,” answered Jane, “and he’ll tell us all, you and us, what we ought to do. You’ll not be afraid of him, will you?”",papa vestry answer tell do afraid 
17,"“No,” said Jessica cheerfully, following the minister’s children as they led her along the side of the chapel towards the vestry.",say follow minister child lead side chapel vestry 
18,"“He is not such a terrible personage,” said Winny, looking round encouragingly, as Jane tapped softly at the door, and they heard a voice saying, “Come in.”",terrible personage say look tap door hear voice say come
