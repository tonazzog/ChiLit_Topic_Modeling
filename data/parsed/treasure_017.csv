2,"WE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.",make good speed strip wood divide stockade step take voice buccaneer ring hear footfall run cracking branch breast bit thicket 
3,I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming.,begin see have brush earnest look priming 
4,"""Captain,"" said I, ""Trelawney is the dead shot. Give him your gun; his own is useless.""",say dead shot give gun own useless 
5,"They exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service. At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. It was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt.",exchange gun silent cool beginning bustle hang moment heel see fit service same time observe unarmed hand cutlass do heart good see spit hand knit brow make blade sing air plain line body new hand worth salt 
6,"Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, the boatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner.",pace come edge wood see stockade front strike enclosure middle south side same time mutineer boatswain head appear full cry southwestern corner 
7,"They paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to fire. The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did the business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.",pause take recover squire block house have time fire shot come scatter volley do business enemy fall rest hesitation turn plunge tree 
8,"After reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy. He was stone dead--shot through the heart.",reload walk outside palisade see fall enemy stone dead shoot heart 
9,"We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. Both the squire and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable we only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom.",begin rejoice good success moment pistol crack bush ball whistle ear poor stumble fall length ground squire return shot have aim probable waste powder reload turn attention poor 
10,"The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an eye that all was over.",captain examine see eye 
11,"I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and bleeding, into the log-house.",believe readiness return volley scatter mutineer more suffer further molestation get poor old gamekeeper hoist stockade carry groan bleed log house 
12,"Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint, fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was to die.",poor old fellow utter word surprise complaint fear acquiescence very beginning trouble lay log house die lain mattress gallery follow order old party score year sullen old serviceable servant die 
13,"The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand, crying like a child.",squire drop knee kiss hand cry child 
14,"""Be I going, doctor?"" he asked.",go doctor ask 
15,"""Tom, my man,"" said I, ""you're going home.""",man say go 
16,"""I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,"" he replied.",wish have lick gun reply 
17,"""Tom,"" said the squire, ""say you forgive me, won't you?""",say squire say forgive 
18,"""Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?"" was the answer. ""Howsoever, so be it, amen!""",respectful squire answer 
19,"After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read a prayer. ""It's the custom, sir,"" he added apologetically. And not long after, without another word, he passed away.",little while silence say think read prayer custom sir add word pass 
20,"In the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various stores--the British colours, a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink, the log-book, and pounds of tobacco. He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure, and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle. Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours.",meantime captain observe swollen chest pocket turn great many various store british colour coil stoutish rope pen ink log book pound tobacco find longish fir tree lying fell trim enclosure help set corner log house trunk cross make angle climb roof have own hand bend run colour 
21,"This seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed. But he had an eye on Tom's passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.",seem relieve re-enter log house set count store else exist have eye passage come flag spread body 
22,"""Don't you take on, sir,"" he said, shaking the squire's hand. ""All's well with him; no fear for a hand that's been shot down in his duty to captain and owner. It mayn't be good divinity, but it's a fact.""",take sir say shake squire hand fear hand shoot duty captain owner good divinity fact 
23,Then he pulled me aside.,pull 
24,"""Dr. Livesey,"" he said, ""in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort?""",say many week squire expect consort 
25,"I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but neither sooner nor later. ""You can calculate for yourself,"" I said.",tell question week month end send find calculate say 
26,"""Why, yes,"" returned the captain, scratching his head; ""and making a large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I should say we were pretty close hauled.""",return captain scratch head make large allowance sir gift say close haul 
27,"""How do you mean?"" I asked.",mean ask 
28,"""It's a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That's what I mean,"" replied the captain. ""As for powder and shot, we'll do. But the rations are short, very short--so short, Dr. Livesey, that we're perhaps as well without that extra mouth.""",pity sir lose second load mean reply captain powder shot do ration short short short extra mouth 
29,And he pointed to the dead body under the flag.,point dead body flag 
30,"Just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.",roar whistle round shot pass roof log house plump wood 
31,"""Oho!"" said the captain. ""Blaze away! You've little enough powder already, my lads.""",say captain blaze have little enough powder lad 
32,"At the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage.",second trial aim good ball descend stockade scatter cloud sand do further damage 
33,"""Captain,"" said the squire, ""the house is quite invisible from the ship. It must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be wiser to take it in?""",say squire house invisible ship flag aim wise take 
34,"""Strike my colours!"" cried the captain. ""No, sir, not I""; and as soon as he had said the words, I think we all agreed with him. For it was not only a piece of stout, seamanly, good feeling; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.",strike colour cry captain sir say word think agree piece stout seamanly good feeling good policy show enemy despise cannonade 
35,"All through the evening they kept thundering away. Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure, but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand. We had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket.",evening keep thunder ball ball fly fall short kick sand enclosure have fire high shot fall dead bury soft sand have ricochet fear pop roof log house floor use sort horse play minded more cricket 
36,"""There is one good thing about all this,"" observed the captain; ""the wood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good while; our stores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring in pork.""",be good thing observe captain wood front clear ebb make good while store uncover volunteer go bring pork 
37,"Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they stole out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel's gunnery. For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own.",first come armed steal stockade prove useless mission mutineer bold fancy put more trust gunnery busy carry store wading gig lay pull oar hold current stern sheet command man provide musket secret magazine own
