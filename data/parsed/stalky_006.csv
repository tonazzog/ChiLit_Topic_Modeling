1,CHAPTER 6. A LITTLE PREP.,little prep 
2," Easter term was but a month old when Stettson major, a day-boy, contracted diphtheria, and the Head was very angry. He decreed a new and narrower set of bounds--the infection had been traced to an out-lying farmhouse--urged the prefects severely to lick all trespassers, and promised extra attentions from his own hand. There were no words bad enough for Stettson major, quarantined at his mother’s house, who had lowered the school-average of health. This he said in the gymnasium after prayers. Then he wrote some two hundred letters to as many anxious parents and guardians, and bade the school carry on. The trouble did not spread, but, one night, a dog-cart drove to the Head’s door, and in the morning the Head had gone, leaving all things in charge of Mr. King, senior house-master. The Head often ran up to town, where the school devoutly believed he bribed officials for early proofs of the Army Examination papers; but this absence was unusually prolonged.",term month old major day boy contract diphtheria angry decree new narrower set bound infection trace lying farmhouse urge prefect lick trespasser promise extra attention own hand be word bad major quarantine mother house lower school average health say gymnasium prayer write letter many anxious parent guardian bid school carry trouble spread night dog cart drive door morning go leave thing charge senior house master run town school believe bribe official early proof examination paper absence prolonged

7,"“That’s rather a sickly way of spending an afternoon. Stinks too. Let’s come out an’ smoke. Here’s a treat.” Stalky held up a long Indian cheroot. “‘Bagged it from my pater last holidays.

They pushed through a dripping hedge, landed among water-logged clods, and sat down on a rust-coated harrow. The cheroot burned with sputterings of saltpetre.

Limp and empty, they sprawled across the harrow, the rust marking their ulsters in red squares and the abandoned cheroot-end reeking under their very cold noses.

You will go back to the College and give my compliments to Mr. King and ask him to give you an extra-special licking. You will then do me five hundred lines. I shall be back to-morrow.

Luckily, he was no expert in the gentle art.",make answer soft one go receive send enjoy virtue seniority boy exempt hand save special order expert gentle art

They regained their study and settled down to the imposition.",strange desire outrun performance say quote play cramm term regain study settle imposition

36,"“Look here,” McTurk began with cold venom, “we aren’t goin’ to row you about this business, because it’s too bad for a row; but we want you to understand you’re jolly well excommunicated, Stalky.

47,"The Head returned next day without explanation, to find the lines waiting for him and the school a little relaxed under Mr. King’s viceroyalty. Mr. King had been talking at and round and over the boys’ heads, in a lofty and promiscuous style, of public-school spirit and the traditions of ancient seats; for he always improved an occasion. Beyond waking in two hundred and fifty young hearts a lively hatred of all other foundations, he accomplished little--so little, indeed, that when, two days after the Head’s return, he chanced to come across Stalky & Co., gated but ever resourceful, playing marbles in the corridor, he said that he was not surprised--not in the least surprised. This was what he had expected from persons of their _morale_.",return next day explanation find line wait school little relaxed viceroyalty talk boy head lofty promiscuous style public school spirit tradition ancient seat improve occasion wake young heart lively hatred other foundation accomplish little little day return chance come gated resourceful play marble corridor say surprise least surprise expect person _morale_

It was not a Sixth to be handled without gloves, as King found.",half year count month crammer roof return homesick final polish be other senior go same mill mention boy reject other establishment account certain overwhelmingness wring fair shape sixth handle glove find

65,"It might have been because he felt the air was a little thunderous that the Head took his after-dinner cheroot to Flint’s study; but he so often began an evening in a prefect’s room that nobody suspected when he drifted in pensively, after the knocks that etiquette demanded.",feel air little thunderous take dinner cheroot study begin evening prefect room suspect drift knock etiquette demand

89,"With the last week of the term the Old Boys began to arrive, and their welcome was nicely proportioned to their worth. Gentlemen cadets from Sandhurst and Woolwich, who had only left a year ago, but who carried enormous side, were greeted with a cheerful “Hullo! What’s the Shop like?” from those who had shared their studies. Militia subalterns had more consideration, but it was understood they were not precisely of the true metal. Recreants who, failing for the Army, had gone into business or banks were received for old sake’s sake, but in no way made too much of. But when the real subalterns, officers and gentlemen full-blown--who had been to the ends of the earth and back again and so carried no side--came on the scene strolling about with the Head, the school divided right and left in admiring silence. And when one laid hands on Flint, even upon the Head of the Games crying, “Good Heavens! What do you mean by growing in this way? You were a beastly little fag when I left,” visible haloes encircled Flint. They would walk to and fro in the corridor with the little red school-sergeant, telling news of old regiments; they would burst into form-rooms sniffing the well-remembered smells of ink and whitewash; they would find nephews and cousins in the lower forms and present them with enormous wealth; or they would invade the gymnasium and make Foxy show off the new stock on the bars.",last week term old begin arrive welcome proportion worth gentlemen cadet leave year carry enormous side greet cheerful shop share study militia subaltern have more consideration understand true metal recreant fail go business bank receive old sake sake way make much real subaltern officer gentleman full blow end earth carry side come scene stroll school divide leave admire silence lay hand cry good heavens mean grow way beastly little fag leave visible haloe encircle walk for corridor little red school sergeant tell news old regiment burst form room sniff remember smell ink whitewash find nephew cousin low form present enormous wealth invade gymnasium make show new stock bar 
90,"Chiefly, though, they talked with the Head, who was father-confessor and agent-general to them all; for what they shouted in their unthinking youth, they proved in their thoughtless manhood--to wit, that the Prooshan Bates was “a downy bird.” Young blood who had stumbled into an entanglement with a pastry-cook’s daughter at Plymouth; experience who had come into a small legacy but mistrusted lawyers; ambition halting at cross-roads, anxious to take the one that would lead him farthest; extravagance pursued by the money-lender; arrogance in the thick of a regimental row--each carried his trouble to the Head; and Chiron showed him, in language quite unfit for little boys, a quiet and safe way round, out, or under. So they overflowed his house, smoked his cigars, and drank his health as they had drunk it all the earth over when two or three of the old school had foregathered.",talk father confessor agent general shout unthinking youth prove thoughtless manhood wit downy bird young blood stumble entanglement pastry cook daughter experience come small legacy mistrust lawyer ambition halt cross-road anxious take one lead farthest extravagance pursue money lender arrogance thick regimental row carry trouble show language unfit little boy quiet safe way overflow house smoke cigar drink health drink earth old school foregather

Crandall of an ordinary Indian regiment--arrived from Exeter on the morning of the match, he was cheered along the whole front of the College, for the prefects had repeated the sense of that which the Head had read them in Flint’s study. When Prout’s house understood that he would claim his Old Boy’s right to a bed for one night, Beetle ran into King’s house next door and executed a public “gloat” up and down the enemy’s big form-room, departing in a haze of ink-pots.",minor ordinary indian regiment arrive morning match cheer whole front prefect repeat sense read study house understand claim old bed night run house next door execute public gloat enemy big form room depart haze ink pot

106,"The technique of that match belongs to a bygone age. Scrimmages were tight and enduring; hacking was direct and to the purpose; and around the scrimmage stood the school, crying, “Put down your heads and shove!”  Toward the end everybody lost all sense of decency, and mothers of day-boys too close to the touch-line heard language not included in the bills. No one was actually carried off the field, but both sides felt happier when time was called, and Beetle helped Stalky and McTurk into their overcoats. The two had met in the many-legged heart of things, and, as Stalky said, had “done each other proud.” As they swaggered woodenly behind the teams--substitutes do not rank as equals of hairy men--they passed a pony-carriage near the wall, and a husky voice cried, “Well played. Oh, played indeed!” It was Stettson major, white-checked and hollow-eyed, who had fought his way to the ground under escort of an impatient coachman.",technique match belong bygone age scrimmage tight endure hack direct purpose scrimmage stand school cry put head shove end lose sense decency mother day boy close touch line hear language include bill carry field side feel happy time call help overcoat meet many legged heart thing say do other proud swagger team substitute rank equal hairy man pass pony carriage wall husky voice cry play play major white check hollow eye fight way ground escort impatient coachman

Fact was, I’d heard the firing and was just going to see about it, when Duncan’s men came up. So we all turned back together. They told me something about an officer, but I couldn’t get the hang of things till I saw a chap under the wheels of the cart out in the open, propped up on one arm, blazing away with a revolver. You see, the escort had abandoned the cart, and the Afridis--they’re an awfully suspicious gang--thought the retreat was a trap--sort of draw, you know--and the cart was the bait. So they had left poor old Duncan alone. ‘Minute they spotted how few we were, it was a race across the flat who should reach old Duncan first. We ran, and they ran, and we won, and after a little hackin’ about they pulled off. I never knew it was one of us till I was right on top of him.

No school in the world did prep. on the last night of the term. This thing was monstrous, tyrannical, subversive of law, religion, and morality. They would go into the form-rooms, and they would take their degraded holiday task with them, but--here they smiled and speculated what manner of man the Common-room would send up against them. The lot fell on Mason, credulous and enthusiastic, who loved youth. No other master was anxious to take that “prep.,” for the school lacked the steadying influence of tradition; and men accustomed to the ordered routine of ancient foundations found it occasionally insubordinate. The four long form-rooms, in which all below the rank of study-boys worked, received him with thunders of applause. Ere he had coughed twice they favored him with a metrical summary of the marriage laws of Great Britain, as recorded by the High Priest of the Israelites and commented on by the leader of the host. The lower forms reminded him that it was the last day, and that therefore he must “take it all in play.” When he dashed off to rebuke them, the Lower Fourth and Upper Third began with one accord to be sick, loudly and realistically. Mr. Mason tried, of all vain things under heaven, to argue with them, and a bold soul at a back desk bade him “take fifty lines for not ‘olding up ‘is ‘and before speaking.” As one who prided himself upon the perfection of his English this cut Mason to the quick, and while he was trying to discover the offender, the Upper and Lower Second, three form-rooms away, turned out the gas and threw ink-pots. It was a pleasant and stimulating “prep.”  The study-boys and prefects heard the echoes of it far off, and the Common-room at dessert smiled.",school frolick packed trunk whoop corridor gloat form room receive news amazement rage school world prep last night term thing monstrous tyrannical subversive law religion morality go form room take degrade holiday task smile speculate manner man common room send lot fall credulous enthusiastic love youth other master anxious take prep. school lack steady influence tradition man accustom order routine ancient foundation find insubordinate long form room rank study boy work receive thunder applause cough favore metrical summary marriage law great record high comment leader host low form remind last day take play dash rebuke lower fourth upper begin accord sick try vain thing heaven argue bold soul back desk bid take line old speak pride perfection english cut quick try discover offender upper lower second form room turn gas throw ink pot pleasant stimulate prep study boy prefect hear echo common room dessert smile
