17,"“Now go and tell Oom Hi and the Kangaroo, and if they come to the conclusion that his Majesty’s complexion has been restored through using the stuff they call ‘Wallypug’s Blush,’ don’t say anything to the contrary; it will put them into a good temper and perhaps make them kinder to his Majesty.”",go tell come conclusion complexion restore use stuff call say contrary put good temper make kinder

22,"“Er, we didn’t mean to be _too_ severe, you know, and what we have done has been all for the best. You will be pleased to hear that my invaluable preparation, ‘Wallypug’s Blush,’ has proved perfectly satisfactory, and his Majesty the Wallypug is a living testimony to its worth. His beautiful complexion has entirely returned, and I have no doubt if we could persuade you to use it too it would be equally successful in your case. You will try it, won’t you?” he pleaded earnestly.",mean severe know do good pleased hear invaluable preparation prove satisfactory living testimony worth beautiful complexion return have doubt persuade use successful case try plead

30,"“I _knew_ it must be good for something or another,” he went on, “but of course we could not tell exactly what till we had tried. It _very nearly_ cured a cold once, you know, when I called it Broncho, though I am bound to admit that it was not exactly a success as Vimbril. Do you think ‘Wallypug’s Blush’ a good title,” he asked anxiously.",_knew good go course tell try nearly_ cure cold know call bound admit success think good title ask

33,"“Now then, what’s this I hear?” she began, giving me a keen glance; “‘Wallypug’s Blush’ restored your complexion. Why so it has, though I cannot say much for it even now. However, since you have no longer a blue face you are scarcely likely to be valuable as a curiosity, so you had better get about your business,” and, flinging open the door, the Cockatoo motioned me out with her crutched stick.",hear begin give keen glance restore complexion say much have blue face likely valuable curiosity good get business fling open door motion crutched stick 
34,You may be sure I was not long in availing myself of my liberty and hurrying to the spot where I had last seen his Majesty.,sure long avail liberty hurry spot see

43,"“Well she is a trial, certainly,” I agreed, “and I think if I were you I should adopt some very strong measures for preventing her from interfering as she does.”",trial agree think adopt strong measure prevent interfere 
44,"“Hm! yes,” said his Majesty, “let’s go and hear what the Doctor-in-Law has to say about it; he may be able to advise us as to the best way of putting her down, and though he will probably charge pretty stiffly for it, his advice _is_ worth having sometimes.”",say let go hear have say able advise good way put charge advice worth have 
45,So we went together to the Doctor-in-Law’s room.,go room 
46,"We were surprised to hear several voices talking excitedly within, and when in reply to a rather impatient “Come in!” we opened the door, we were astonished to see the Doctor-in-Law in his dressing-gown and slippers, in busy consultation with Oom Hi, the Kangaroo, and the Cockatoo.",surprise hear several voice talk reply impatient come open door astonished see dress gown slipper busy consultation 
47,"“I’ve been greatly interested in hearing of the success of ‘Wallypug’s Blush,’” said the little man, “and am just helping Oom Hi (ahem, for a consideration) to draw up a prospectus for turning it into a Limited Company. In consideration of the payment to me of several thousands of pounds, I am about to become a director, and am to be paid several thousands more for persuading the Cockatoo to join the board too.”",interested hear success say little man help consideration draw prospectus turn limited company consideration payment several thousand pound about become director pay several thousand more persuade join board

53,"“Yes, I really don’t see that your contention has much weight,” said the Doctor-in-Law. “Provided it is only advertised enough, the public will buy _any_ rubbish, whether it does what it professes to do or not. And we shall simply call it ‘Wallypug’s Blush _for the complexion_,’ you know; besides, even if it doesn’t answer, we can turn it into something else, Boot Polish or Hair Wash, you know.”",see contention have much weight say provide advertise public buy rubbish do profess do call complexion_ know answer turn else know
