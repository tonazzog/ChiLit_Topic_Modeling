5,"‘You will eat your breakfast before it’s cold, won’t you?’ said Anthea. ‘Yes, we had a splendid time. The charm made it all dark, and then greeny light, and then it spoke. Oh! I wish you could have heard it--it was such a darling voice--and it told us the other half of it was lost in the Past, so of course we shall have to look for it there!’",eat breakfast cold say have splendid time charm make dark greeny light speak wish hear darling voice tell other half lose course have look 
6,The learned gentleman rubbed his hair with both hands and looked anxiously at Anthea.,learn gentleman rub hair hand look

8,"‘I can’t tell you,’ she said. ‘I know it seems most awfully rude, especially after being so kind about telling us the name of power, and all that, but really, I’m not allowed to tell anybody anything about the--the--the person who told me. You won’t forget your breakfast, will you?’",tell say know seem rude kind tell name power allow tell person tell forget breakfast

12,"He had not had many adventures with children in them, and he wondered whether all children were like these. He spent quite five minutes in wondering before he settled down to the fifty-second chapter of his great book on ‘The Secret Rites of the Priests of Amen Ra’.",have many adventure child wonder child spend minute wonder settle second chapter great book secret 
13," It is no use to pretend that the children did not feel a good deal of agitation at the thought of going through the charm into the Past. That idea, that perhaps they might stay in the Past and never get back again, was anything but pleasing. Yet no one would have dared to suggest that the charm should not be used; and though each was in its heart very frightened indeed, they would all have joined in jeering at the cowardice of any one of them who should have uttered the timid but natural suggestion, ‘Don’t let’s!’",use pretend child feel good deal agitation thought go charm idea stay get pleasing dare suggest charm use heart frighten join jeer cowardice one utter timid natural suggestion let 
14,"It seemed necessary to make arrangements for being out all day, for there was no reason to suppose that the sound of the dinner-bell would be able to reach back into the Past, and it seemed unwise to excite old Nurse’s curiosity when nothing they could say--not even the truth--could in any way satisfy it. They were all very proud to think how well they had understood what the charm and the Psammead had said about Time and Space and things like that, and they were perfectly certain that it would be quite impossible to make old Nurse understand a single word of it. So they merely asked her to let them take their dinner out into Regent’s Park--and this, with the implied cold mutton and tomatoes, was readily granted.",seem necessary make arrangement day be reason suppose sound dinner bell able reach seem unwise excite old curiosity say truth way satisfy proud think understand charm say time space thing certain impossible make old nurse understand single word ask let take dinner imply cold mutton tomato grant 
15,"‘You can get yourselves some buns or sponge-cakes, or whatever you fancy-like,’ said old Nurse, giving Cyril a shilling. ‘Don’t go getting jam-tarts, now--so messy at the best of times, and without forks and plates ruination to your clothes, besides your not being able to wash your hands and faces afterwards.’",get bun sponge cake fancy say old give shilling go get jam tart messy good time fork plate ruination clothes able wash hand face 
16,"So Cyril took the shilling, and they all started off. They went round by the Tottenham Court Road to buy a piece of waterproof sheeting to put over the Psammead in case it should be raining in the Past when they got there. For it is almost certain death to a Psammead to get wet.",take shilling start go buy piece waterproof sheet put case rain get certain death get wet 
17,"The sun was shining very brightly, and even London looked pretty. Women were selling roses from big baskets-full, and Anthea bought four roses, one each, for herself and the others. They were red roses and smelt of summer--the kind of roses you always want so desperately at about Christmas-time when you can only get mistletoe, which is pale right through to its very scent, and holly which pricks your nose if you try to smell it. So now everyone had a rose in its buttonhole, and soon everyone was sitting on the grass in Regent’s Park under trees whose leaves would have been clean, clear green in the country, but here were dusty and yellowish, and brown at the edges.",sun shine look pretty woman sell rose big basket full buy rose other red rose smelt summer kind rose want time get mistletoe pale very scent holly prick nose try smell have rose buttonhole sit grass tree leave clean clear green country dusty yellowish brown edge

23,"Jane with trembling hands took the Psammead and its fish-basket under one arm. The charm’s long string was hung round her neck. Then they all stood up. Jane held out the charm at arm’s length, and Cyril solemnly pronounced the word of power.",tremble hand take fish basket arm charm long string hang neck stand hold charm arm length pronounce word power 
24,"As he spoke it the charm grew tall and broad, and he saw that Jane was just holding on to the edge of a great red arch of very curious shape. The opening of the arch was small, but Cyril saw that he could go through it. All round and beyond the arch were the faded trees and trampled grass of Regent’s Park, where the little ragged children were playing Ring-o’-Roses. But through the opening of it shone a blaze of blue and yellow and red. Cyril drew a long breath and stiffened his legs so that the others should not see that his knees were trembling and almost knocking together. ‘Here goes!’ he said, and, stepping up through the arch, disappeared. Then followed Anthea. Robert, coming next, held fast, at Anthea’s suggestion, to the sleeve of Jane, who was thus dragged safely through the arch. And as soon as they were on the other side of the arch there was no more arch at all and no more Regent’s Park either, only the charm in Jane’s hand, and it was its proper size again. They were now in a light so bright that they winked and blinked and rubbed their eyes. During this dazzling interval Anthea felt for the charm and pushed it inside Jane’s frock, so that it might be quite safe. When their eyes got used to the new wonderful light the children looked around them. The sky was very, very blue, and it sparkled and glittered and dazzled like the sea at home when the sun shines on it.",speak charm grow tall broad see hold edge great red arch curious shape opening arch small see go arch fade tree trample grass little ragged child play opening shine blaze blue yellow red draw long breath stiffen leg other see knee tremble knock go say step arch disappear follow come hold suggestion sleeve drag arch other side arch be more arch more charm hand proper size light bright wink blink rub eye dazzling interval feel charm push frock safe eye use new wonderful light child look sky blue sparkle glitter dazzle sea home sun shine 
25,"They were standing on a little clearing in a thick, low forest; there were trees and shrubs and a close, thorny, tangly undergrowth. In front of them stretched a bank of strange black mud, then came the browny-yellowy shining ribbon of a river. Then more dry, caked mud and more greeny-browny jungle. The only things that told that human people had been there were the clearing, a path that led to it, and an odd arrangement of cut reeds in the river.",stand little clear thick low forest be tree shrub close thorny tangly undergrowth front stretch bank strange black mud come browny yellowy shine ribbon river dry cake mud greeny browny jungle only thing tell human person clear path lead odd arrangement cut reed river

40,"‘I’m glad it’s being real on the other side of the river,’ said Jane. And now there was a crackling of reeds and twigs behind them. This was horrible. Of course it might be another hippopotamus, or a crocodile, or a lion--or, in fact, almost anything.",glad real other side river say be crackling reed twig horrible course hippopotamus crocodile lion fact

45,"It was. It was a girl--of about Anthea’s age. Her hair was short and fair, and though her skin was tanned by the sun, you could see that it would have been fair too if it had had a chance. She had every chance of being tanned, for she had no clothes to speak of, and the four English children, carefully dressed in frocks, hats, shoes, stockings, coats, collars, and all the rest of it, envied her more than any words of theirs or of mine could possibly say. There was no doubt that here was the right costume for that climate.",girl age hair short fair skin tann sun see fair have chance have chance tann have clothes speak english child dress frock hat shoe stocking coat collar rest envie more word say be doubt right costume climate 
46,"She carried a pot on her head, of red and black earthenware. She did not see the children, who shrank back against the edge of the jungle, and she went forward to the brink of the river to fill her pitcher. As she went she made a strange sort of droning, humming, melancholy noise all on two notes. Anthea could not help thinking that perhaps the girl thought this noise was singing.",carry pot head red black earthenware see child shrank edge jungle go brink river fill pitcher go make strange sort droning hum melancholy noise note help think girl think noise sing 
47,"The girl filled the pitcher and set it down by the river bank. Then she waded into the water and stooped over the circle of cut reeds. She pulled half a dozen fine fish out of the water within the reeds, killing each as she took it out, and threading it on a long osier that she carried. Then she knotted the osier, hung it on her arm, picked up the pitcher, and turned to come back. And as she turned she saw the four children. The white dresses of Jane and Anthea stood out like snow against the dark forest background. She screamed and the pitcher fell, and the water was spilled out over the hard mud surface and over the fish, which had fallen too. Then the water slowly trickled away into the deep cracks.",girl fill pitcher set river bank wade water stoop circle cut reed pull fine fish water reed kill take thread long osier carry knotted osier hang arm pick pitcher turn come turn see child white dress stand snow dark forest background scream pitcher fall water spill hard mud surface fish fall water trickle deep crack

49,‘Who are you?’ said the girl.,say girl 
50,"Now, once for all, I am not going to be bothered to tell you how it was that the girl could understand Anthea and Anthea could understand the girl. YOU, at any rate, would not understand ME, if I tried to explain it, any more than you can understand about time and space being only forms of thought. You may think what you like. Perhaps the children had found out the universal language which everyone can understand, and which wise men so far have not found. You will have noticed long ago that they were singularly lucky children, and they may have had this piece of luck as well as others. Or it may have been that... but why pursue the question further? The fact remains that in all their adventures the muddle-headed inventions which we call foreign languages never bothered them in the least. They could always understand and be understood. If you can explain this, please do. I daresay I could understand your explanation, though you could never understand mine.",go bother tell girl understand understand girl rate understand try explain more understand time space form thought think like child find universal language understand wise man find notice lucky child have piece luck other pursue question fact remain adventure muddle head invention call foreign language bother least understand understand explain do understand explanation understand

58,"Anthea had a bangle on her arm. It was a sevenpenny-halfpenny trumpery thing that pretended to be silver; it had a glass heart of turquoise blue hanging from it, and it was the gift of the maid-of-all-work at the Fitzroy Street house. ‘Here,’ said Anthea, ‘this is for you. That is to show we will not hurt you. And if you take it I shall know that you won’t hurt us.’",have bangle arm sevenpenny halfpenny trumpery thing pretend silver have glass heart turquoise blue hang gift maid work house say show hurt take know hurt

65,"The whole party suddenly came out of the wood’s shadow into the glare of the sunlight that shone on a great stretch of yellow sand, dotted with heaps of grey rocks where spiky cactus plants showed gaudy crimson and pink flowers among their shabby, sand-peppered leaves. Away to the right was something that looked like a grey-brown hedge, and from beyond it blue smoke went up to the bluer sky. And over all the sun shone till you could hardly bear your clothes.",whole party come wood shadow glare sunlight shine great stretch yellow sand dot heap grey rock spiky cactus plant show gaudy crimson pink flower shabby sand pepper leave right look grey brown hedge blue smoke go bluer sky sun shine bear clothes

68,"The Psammead ought to have been touched by this proof of confidence. Perhaps, however, it looked upon it as a proof of doubt, for it merely snarled--",touch proof confidence look proof doubt snarl

77,"There was an opening in the hedge, and they followed the girl through it. A little way further on was another hedge, not so high, also of dry thorn bushes, very prickly and spiteful-looking, and within this was a sort of village of huts.",be opening hedge follow girl little way hedge high dry thorn bush prickly spiteful look sort village hut 
78,"There were no gardens and no roads. Just huts built of wood and twigs and clay, and roofed with great palm-leaves, dumped down anywhere. The doors of these houses were very low, like the doors of dog-kennels. The ground between them was not paths or streets, but just yellow sand trampled very hard and smooth.",be garden road hut build wood twig clay roof great palm leave dump door house low door dog kennel ground path street yellow sand trample smooth

87,"‘We come,’ said Cyril, with some dim remembrance of a dreadful day when he had had to wait in an outer office while his father interviewed a solicitor, and there had been nothing to read but the Daily Telegraph--‘we come from the world where the sun never sets. And peace with honour is what we want. We are the great Anglo-Saxon or conquering race. Not that we want to conquer YOU,’ he added hastily. ‘We only want to look at your houses and your--well, at all you’ve got here, and then we shall return to our own place, and tell of all that we have seen so that your name may be famed.’",come say dim remembrance dreadful day have wait outer office father interview solicitor be read daily come world sun set peace honour want great anglo conquer race want conquer add want look house get return own place tell see name famed 
88,"Cyril’s speech didn’t keep the crowd from pressing round and looking as eagerly as ever at the clothing of the children. Anthea had an idea that these people had never seen woven stuff before, and she saw how wonderful and strange it must seem to people who had never had any clothes but the skins of beasts. The sewing, too, of modern clothes seemed to astonish them very much. They must have been able to sew themselves, by the way, for men who seemed to be the chiefs wore knickerbockers of goat-skin or deer-skin, fastened round the waist with twisted strips of hide. And the women wore long skimpy skirts of animals’ skins. The people were not very tall, their hair was fair, and men and women both had it short. Their eyes were blue, and that seemed odd in Egypt. Most of them were tattooed like sailors, only more roughly.",speech keep crowd press look clothing child have idea person see wove stuff see wonderful strange seem person have clothes skin beast sewing modern clothes seem astonish able sew way man seem chief wear knickerbocker goat skin deer skin fasten waist twist strip hide woman wear long skimpy skirt animal skin person tall hair fair man woman have short eye blue seem odd most tattooe sailor

92,She spoke in the tone of authority which she had always found successful when she had not time to coax her baby brother to do as he was told. The tone was just as successful now. The children were left together and the crowd retreated. It paused a dozen yards away to look at the lace collar and to go on talking as hard as it could.,speak tone authority find successful have time coax baby brother do tell tone successful child leave crowd retreat pause yard look lace collar go talk 
93,"The children will never know what those people said, though they knew well enough that they, the four strangers, were the subject of the talk. They tried to comfort themselves by remembering the girl’s promise of friendliness, but of course the thought of the charm was more comfortable than anything else. They sat down on the sand in the shadow of the hedged-round place in the middle of the village, and now for the first time they were able to look about them and to see something more than a crowd of eager, curious faces.",child know person say know stranger subject talk try comfort remember girl promise friendliness course thought charm comfortable else sit sand shadow hedge round place middle village first time able look see more crowd eager curious face

Look here, they’ll get suspicious if we talk among ourselves, and I do want to know about how they do things.

103,"I wish I had time to tell you of that talk. The English children wanted to hear all about this new place, but they also wanted to tell of their own country. It was like when you come back from your holidays and you want to hear and to tell everything at the same time. As the talk went on there were more and more words that the girl could not understand, and the children soon gave up the attempt to explain to her what their own country was like, when they began to see how very few of the things they had always thought they could not do without were really not at all necessary to life.",wish have time tell talk english child want hear new place want tell own country come holiday want hear tell same time talk go more more word girl understand child give attempt explain own country begin see few thing think do necessary life 
104,"The girl showed them how the huts were made--indeed, as one was being made that very day she took them to look at it. The way of building was very different from ours. The men stuck long pieces of wood into a piece of ground the size of the hut they wanted to make. These were about eight inches apart; then they put in another row about eight inches away from the first, and then a third row still further out. Then all the space between was filled up with small branches and twigs, and then daubed over with black mud worked with the feet till it was soft and sticky like putty.",girl show hut make make very day take look way building different man stick long piece wood piece ground size hut want make inch put row inch first third row space fill small branch twig daub black mud work foot soft sticky putty 
105,"The girl told them how the men went hunting with flint spears and arrows, and how they made boats with reeds and clay. Then she explained the reed thing in the river that she had taken the fish out of. It was a fish-trap--just a ring of reeds set up in the water with only one little opening in it, and in this opening, just below the water, were stuck reeds slanting the way of the river’s flow, so that the fish, when they had swum sillily in, sillily couldn’t get out again. She showed them the clay pots and jars and platters, some of them ornamented with black and red patterns, and the most wonderful things made of flint and different sorts of stone, beads, and ornaments, and tools and weapons of all sorts and kinds.",girl tell man go hunt flint spear arrow make boat reed clay explain reed thing river take fish fish trap ring reed set water little opening opening water stuck reed slant way river flow fish swum get show clay pot jar plateer ornament black red pattern wonderful thing make flint different sort stone bead ornament tool weapon sort kind
