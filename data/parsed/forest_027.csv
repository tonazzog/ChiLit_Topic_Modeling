Edward and his friends joined them, with about three hundred English and Scotchmen, which they had enlisted, and very soon afterward Conde obtained the victory at Blenan, and in April, 1652, advanced to Paris. Turenne, who had taken the command of the French army, followed him, and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of St. Antoine, in which neither party had the advantage. But eventually Conde was beaten back by the superior force of Turenne; and, not receiving the assistance he expected from the Spaniards, he fell back to the frontiers of Champagne.",month interview join great number noble re-enforce troops set standard revolt friend join english enlist obtain victory advance take command french army follow severe action fight street suburb party have advantage beat superior force receive assistance expect fall frontier 
15,"Previous to his departure from Paris, Edward had received Humphrey's letter, explaining away the intendant's conduct; and the contents removed a heavy load from Edward's mind; but he now thought of nothing but war, and although he cherished the idea of Patience Heatherstone, he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could. He wrote a letter to the intendant, thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him, and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again. He did not however think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter, except in inquiring after her health, and sending his respects.

They took their leave of the prince, who thanked them for their long and meritorious services; and they then hastened to King Charles, who had left Spain and come to the Low Countries.

Recollect also that Mr. Heatherstone, and his brother-in-law, Sir Ashley Cooper, have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do. They have been most important agents in his restoration, and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you.

That much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands, I know; and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king.

Now, from wiser heads than mine, I have been told that these applications will not be acceded to, HM is supposed; but, at the same time, if they were to meet the parties, and close with them at once, before the king's intentions are known, they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value. Now is their time: even a few days' delay may make a difference. They can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys.

The court was now one continual scene of fetes and gayety. On the following day a drawing-room was to be held, and Edward's sisters were to be presented. Edward was standing, with many others of the suit, behind the chair of the king, amusing himself with the presentations as they took place, and waiting for the arrival of his sisters--Chaloner and Grenville were not with him, they had obtained leave to go into the country, for the object we have before referred to--when his eyes caught, advancing toward the king, Mr. Heatherstone, who led his daughter, Patience. That they had not perceived him was evident; indeed her eyes were not raised once, from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty. Edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve. She was indeed a lovely young person, but little altered, except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure; and her court-dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the New Forest had concealed, or which time had not matured. There was the same pensive, sweet expression in her face, which had altered little; but the beautiful rounded arms, the symmetrical fall of the shoulders, and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him; and Edward, in his own mind, agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day.",remain court several day write dispatch messenger letter messenger return court continual scene fete gayety follow day draw room hold sister present stand many other suit chair king amusing presentation take place wait arrival sister obtain leave go country object refer eye catch advance king lead daughter perceive evident eye raise natural timidity feel young woman presence royalty half conceal companion gaze reserve lovely young person little alter grow tall round perfect figure court dress display proportion humble costume new conceal time mature be same pensive sweet expression face alter little beautiful round arm symmetrical fall shoulder proportion whole figure surprise own mind agree reign toast day

It is now seven years since you quitted the forest, and in your letters to Mr. Heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and Patience. Since that, you have never corresponded or sent any messages; and you can hardly expect that a girl, from the age of seventeen to twenty-four, will cherish the image of one, who, to say the least, had treated her with indifference.

His love of farming continued. Edward gave him a large farm, rent free; and in a few years Humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself. He then married Clara Ratcliffe, who has not appeared lately on the scene, owing to her having been, about two years before the Restoration, claimed by an elderly relation, who lived in the country, and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house. He left his property to Clara, about a year after her marriage to Humphrey. The cottage in the New Forest was held by, and eventually made over to, Pablo, who became a very steady character, and in the course of time married a young girl from Arnwood, and had a houseful of young gipsies. Oswald, so soon as Edward came down to Arnwood, gave up his place in the New Forest, and lived entirely with Edward as his steward; and Phoebe also went to Arnwood, and lived to a good old age, in the capacity of housekeeper, her temper becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years.",young reader content hear particular other personage appear little history take first place love farming continue give large farm rent free few year save sufficient purchase property marry appear scene ow year claim elderly relation live country infirm state health permit quit house leave property year marriage cottage new hold make become steady character course time marry young girl have houseful young gipsie come give place new live steward go live good old age capacity housekeeper temper become bad good advance year
