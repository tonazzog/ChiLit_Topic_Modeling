1,CHAPTER 20. IN THE SOUTH PARLOUR.,chapter south 
2,"Immediately after Easter the real excitement of the school-year began. All the girls who had ambition, who had industry, and who had a desire to please distant fathers, mothers, or guardians, worked hard for that great day at Midsummer when Mrs Willis distributed her valuable prizes.",real excitement school year begin girl have ambition have industry have desire please distant father mother guardian work great day distribute valuable prize 
3,"From the moment of Hester's entrance into the school she had heard this day spoken of.  It was, without doubt, the greatest day of the year at Lavender House.  Smaller prizes were given at Christmas, but the great honours were always reserved for this long sunshiny June day, when Mrs Willis herself presented her marks of approbation to her successful pupils.",moment entrance school hear day speak doubt great day year smaller prize give great honour reserve long sunshiny day present mark approbation successful pupil 
4,"The girls who had lived in the school for two or three years gave Hester vivid descriptions of the excitements, the pleasures, the delights of this day of days.  In the first place, it was the first of the holidays, in the second it was spent almost from morning to night in the open air--for a great tent was erected on the lawn; and visitors thronged to Lavender House, and fathers and mothers, and aunts and uncles, arrived from a distance to witness the triumphs of the favoured children who had won the prizes.  The giving away of the prizes was, of course, _the_ event of the day; but there were many other minor joys.  Always in the evenings there was some special entertainment.  These entertainments differed from year to year, Mrs Willis allowing the girls to choose them for themselves, and only making one proviso, that they must take all the trouble, and all the pains--in short, that they themselves must be the entertainers.  One year they had tableaux vivants; another a fancy ball, every pretty dress of which had been designed by themselves, and many even made by their own industrious little fingers.  Mrs Willis delighted in the interest and occupation that this yearly entertainment gave to her pupils, and she not only, encouraged them in their efforts to produce something very unique and charming, but took care that they should have sufficient time to work up their ideas properly.  Always after Easter she gave the girls of the three first classes two evenings absolutely to themselves; and these they spent in a pretty room called the South Parlour, which belonged to Mrs Willis's part of the house, and was rarely used, except for these great preparations.",girl live school year give vivid description excitement pleasure delight day day first place first holiday second spend morning night open air great tent erect lawn visitor throng father mother aunt uncle arrive distance witness triumph favour child win prize give prize course _the_ event day be many other minor joy evening be special entertainment entertainment differ year year allow girl choose make proviso take trouble pain short entertainer year have tableaux vivant fancy ball pretty dress design many make own industrious little finger delight interest occupation yearly entertainment give pupil encourage effort produce unique charming take care have sufficient time work idea give girl first class evening spend pretty room call belong part house use great preparation 
5,"Hester, therefore, after Easter found her days very full indeed.  Every spare moment she devoted to little Nan, but she was quite determined to win a substantial prize, and she was also deeply interested in various schemes proposed in the South Parlour.",find day full spare moment devote little determined win substantial prize interested various scheme propose 
6,"With regard to prizes, Mrs Willis also went on a plan of her own.  Each girl was expected to come up to a certain standard of excellence in all her studies, and if she fell very much below this standard she was not allowed to try for any prize; if she came up to it, she could select one subject, but only one, for competition.",regard prize go plan own girl expect come certain standard excellence study fall standard allow try prize come select subject competition 
7,"On the Monday after the Easter holidays the special subjects for the Midsummer prizes were given out, and the girls were expected to send in their answers as to the special prize they meant to compete for by the following Friday.",holiday special subject prize give girl expect send answer special prize mean compete follow 
8,"When this day arrived Hester Thornton and Dora Russell both discovered that they had made the same choice--they were going to try for the English composition prize.  This subject always obtained one of the most costly prizes, and several of the girls shook their heads over Hester's choice.",day arrive discover make same choice go try english composition prize subject obtain costly prize several girl shake head choice 
9,"""You are very silly to try for that, Hetty,"" they exclaimed, ""for Mrs Willis has such queer ideas with regard to English composition.  Of course, we go in for it in a general way, and learn the rules of grammar and punctuation, and so forth, but Mrs Willis says that school-girls' themes are so bad and affected, as a rule, and she says she does not think anyone will go in for her pet prize who has not natural ability. In consequence, she gives only one prize for composition between the three first classes.  You had better change your mind, Hetty, before it is too late, for much older girls will compete with you, and there are several who are going to try.""",silly try exclaim have such queer idea regard english composition course go general way learn rule grammar punctuation say school girl theme bad affect rule say think go pet prize have natural ability consequence give prize composition first class good change mind late old girl compete be several go try 
10,"Hester, however, only smiled, and assured her eager friend that she would stick to her pet subject, and try to do the best she could.",smile assure eager friend stick pet subject try do good 
11,"On the morning when the girls signified their choice of subject, Mrs Willis came into the school-room and made one of her little yearly speeches with regard to the right spirit in which her girls should try for these honours.  The few and well-chosen words of the head-mistress generally roused those girls who loved her best to a fever of enthusiasm, and even Hester, who was comparatively a newcomer, felt a great wish, as she listened to that clear and vibrating voice and watched the many expressions which passed over the noble face, that she might find something beyond the mere earthly honour and glory of success in this coming trial.  Having finished her little speech, Mrs Willis made several remarks with regard to the choice of subjects.  She spoke of the English composition prize last, and here she heightened the interest and excitement which always hung around this special prize. Contrary to her usual rule, she would this year give no subject for an English theme.  Each girl might choose what pleased her best.",morning girl signify choice subject come school room make little yearly speech regard right spirit girl try honour few choose word head mistress rouse girl love good fever enthusiasm newcomer feel great wish listen clear vibrate voice watch many expression pass noble face find mere earthly honour glory success come trial finish little speech make several remark regard choice subject speak english composition prize last heighten interest excitement hang special prize contrary usual rule year give subject english theme girl choose pleased good 
12,"On nearing these words Annie Forest, who had been sitting by her desk looking rather dull and dejected, suddenly sprang to her feet, her face aglow, her eyes sparkling, and began whispering vigorously to Miss Good.",near word sit desk look dull deject spring foot face aglow eye sparkling begin whisper 
13,"Miss Good nodded, and, going up to Mrs Willis, said aloud that Annie had changed her mind, and that from not wishing to try for any of the prizes, she now intended to compete for the English composition.",nod go say change mind wish try prize intend compete english composition 
14,"Mrs Willis looked a little surprised, but without any comment she immediately entered Annie's name in the list of competitors, and Annie sat down again, not even glancing at her astonished school-fellows, who could not conceal their amazement, for she had never hitherto shown the slightest desire to excel in this department.",look little surprise comment enter name list competitor sit glance astonished school fellow conceal amazement show slight desire excel department 
15,"On the evening of this Friday the girls of the three first classes assembled for the first time in the South Parlour.  Hitherto these meetings had been carried on in a systematic and business-like fashion. It was impossible for all the girls who belonged to these three large classes to assemble on each occasion.  Careful selections, therefore, were, as a rule, made from their numbers.  These girls formed a committee to superintend and carry on the real preparations for the coming treat, and the others only met when specially summoned by the committee to appear.",evening girl first class assemble first time meeting carry systematic business like fashion impossible girl belong large class assemble occasion careful selection rule make number girl form committee superintend carry real preparation come treat other meet summon committee appear 
16,"As usual now the three classes found themselves in the South Parlour--as usual they chattered volubly, and started schemes, to reject them again with peals of laughter.  Many ideas were put forward, to be cast aside as utterly worthless.  No one seemed to have any very brilliant thought, and as the first step on these occasions was to select what the entertainment should be, proceedings seemed to come to a standstill.",usual class find usual chatter start scheme reject peal laughter many idea put cast worthless seem have brilliant thought first step occasion select entertainment proceedings seem come standstill 
17,"The fact was the most daring originator, the one whoso ideas were always flavoured with a spice of novelty, was absolutely silent.",fact dare originator one idea flavoure spice novelty silent 
18,"Cecil Temple, who had taken a seat near Annie, suddenly, bent forward and spoke to her aloud.",take seat bend speak 
19,"""We have all said what we would like, and we none of us appear to have thought of anything at all worth having,"" she said; ""but you have not spoken at all, Annie.  Give us an idea, dear--you know you originated the fancy ball last year.""",say like appear think worth have say speak give idea dear know originate fancy ball last year 
20,"Thus publicly appealed to, Annie raised her full brown eyes, glanced at her companions, not one of whom, with the exception of Cecil, returned her gaze fully; then, rising to her feet, she spoke in a slightly contemptuous tone.",appeal raise full brown eye glance companion exception return gaze rise foot speak contemptuous tone 
21,"""These preparations seem to me to be much ado about nothing; they lake up a lot of our time, and the results aren't worth the trouble--I have nothing particular to say.  Oh, well, yes, if you like--let's have blind man's buff and a magic lantern;"" and then, dropping a mock curtsey to her companions, she dashed out of the South Parlour.",preparation seem ado lake lot time result worth trouble have particular say like let have blind man buff magic lantern drop mock curtsey companion dash 
22,"""Insufferable girl!"" said Dora Russell; ""I wonder you try to draw her out, Cecil.  You know perfectly that we none of us care to have anything to do with her.""",insufferable girl say wonder try draw know none care have do 
23,"""I know perfectly that you are all doing your best to make her life miserable,"" said Cecil, suddenly and boldly.  ""No one in this school has obeyed Mrs Willis's command to treat Annie as innocent--you are practically sending her to Coventry, and I think it is unjust and unfair.  You don't know, girls, that you are ruining poor Annie's happiness.""",know do good make life miserable say school obey command treat innocent send think unjust unfair know girl ruin poor happiness 
24,"""Oh, dear! she doesn't seem at all dull,"" said Miss West, a second-class girl.  ""I do think she's a hardened little wretch.""",dear seem dull say second class girl think harden little wretch 
25,"""Little you know about her,"" said Cecil, the colour fading out of her pale face.  Then, after a pause, she added, ""The injustice of the whole thing is that in this treatment of Annie you break the spirit of Mrs Willis's command--you, none of you, certainly tell her that she is guilty, but you treat her as such.""",little know say colour fade pale face pause add injustice whole thing treatment break spirit command tell guilty treat such 
26,Here Hester Thornton said a daring thing.,say dare thing 
27,"""I don't believe Mrs Willis in her heart of hearts considers Annie guiltless.""",believe heart heart consider guiltless 
28,"These words of Hester's were laughed at by most of the girls, but Dora Russell gave her an approving nod, and Cecil, looking paler than ever, dropped suddenly into her seat, and no longer tried to defend her absent friend.",word laugh most girl give approve nod look paler drop seat try defend absent friend 
29,"""At any rate,"" said Miss Conway, who as the head girl of the whole school was always listened to with great respect.  ""It is unfortunate for the success of our entertainment that there should be all this discussion and bad feeling with regard to Miss Forest.  For my own part, I cannot make out why the poor little creature should be hunted down, or what affair it is of ours whether she is innocent or not.  If Mr Everard and Mrs Willis says she is innocent, is not that enough?  The fact of her guilt or innocence can't hurt us one way or another.  It is a great pity, however, for our own sakes, that we should be out with her now, for, whatever her faults, she is the only one of us who is ever gifted with an original thought.  But, as we can't have her, let us set to work without her--we really can't waste the whole evening over this sort of talk.""",rate say head girl whole school listen great respect unfortunate success entertainment be discussion bad feeling regard own part make poor little creature hunt affair innocent say innocent enough fact guilt innocence hurt way great pity own sake fault only one gift original thought have let set work waste whole evening sort talk 
30,"Discussions as to the coming pleasure were now again resumed with vigour, and after a great deal of animated arguing it was resolved that two short plays should be acted; that a committee should be immediately formed, who should select the plays, and apportion their various parts to the different actors.",discussion come pleasure resume vigour great deal animated argue resolve short play act committee form select play apportion various part different actor 
31,"The committee selected included Miss Russell, Miss Conway, Hester Thornton, Cecil Temple, and two other girls of the second-class.  The conference then broke up, but there was a certain sense of flatness over everything, and Cecil was not the only girl who sighed for the merry meetings of last year--when Annie had been the life and soul of all the proceedings, and when one brilliant idea after another with regard to the costumes for the fancy ball had dropped from her merry tongue.",committee select include other girl second class conference break be certain sense flatness only girl sigh merry meeting last year life soul proceedings brilliant idea regard costume fancy ball drop merry tongue
