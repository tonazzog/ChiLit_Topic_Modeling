1,CHAPTER 25. LOMAN IN LUCK.,luck 
2,"While we have been talking of Oliver and Wraysford, and of the manner in which the results of the Nightingale examination affected them and the class to which they belonged, the reader will hardly have forgotten that there was another whose interest in that result was fully as serious and fully as painful.",talk manner result examination affect class belong reader forget be interest result serious painful 
3,"Loman had been counting on gaining the scholarship to a dead certainty. From the moment when it occurred to him he would be able to free himself of his money difficulties with Cripps by winning it, he had dismissed, or seemed to dismiss, all further anxiety from his mind.  He never doubted that he in the Sixth could easily beat the two boys in the Fifth; and though, as we have seen, he now and then felt a sneaking misgiving on the subject, it never seriously disturbed his confidence.",count gain scholarship dead certainty moment occur able free money difficulty win dismiss seem dismiss further anxiety mind doubt beat boy fifth see feel sneak misgiving subject disturb confidence 
4,"Now, however, he was utterly floored.  He did not need to wait for the announcement of the results to be certain he had not won, for he had known his fate the moment his eyes glanced down the questions on the paper on the morning of examination.",floor need wait announcement result certain win know fate moment eye glance question paper morning examination 
5,"At his last interview with Cripps that memorable Saturday afternoon, he had promised confidently to call at the Cockchafer next Thursday with the news of the result, as a further guarantee for the payment of the thirty pounds, never doubting what that result would be.  How was he to face this interview now?",last interview memorable afternoon promise call next news result further guarantee payment pound doub result face interview 
6,"He could never tell Cripps straight out that he had been beaten in the examination; that would be the same thing as telling him to go at once to the Doctor or his father with the document which the boy had signed, and expose the whole affair.  And it would be no use making a poor mouth to the landlord of the Cockchafer and begging to be forgiven the debt; Loman knew enough by this time to feel convinced of the folly of that. What was to be done?",tell beat examination same thing tell go father document boy sign expose whole affair use make poor mouth landlord begg forgive debt know time feel convinced folly do 
7,"""I shall have to humbug the fellow some way,"" said Loman to himself, as he sat in his study the afternoon after the announcement of the result. And then followed an oath.",have humbug fellow way say sit study afternoon announcement result follow oath 
8,"Loman had been going from bad to worse the last month.  Ever since he had begun, during the holidays, regularly to frequent the Cockchafer, and to discover that it was his interest to make himself agreeable to the man he disliked and feared, the boy's vicious instincts had developed strangely.  Company which before would have offended him, he now found--especially when it flattered him--congenial, and words and acts from which in former days he would have shrunk now came naturally.",go bad bad last month begin holiday frequent discover interest make agreeable man dislike fear boy vicious instinct develop company offend find flatter congenial word act former day shrink come 
9,"""I shall have to humbug the fellow somehow,"" said he; ""I only wish I knew how;"" and then Loman set himself deliberately to invent a lie for Mr Cripps.",have humbug fellow say wish know set invent lie 
10,A charming afternoon's occupation this for a boy of seventeen!,charming afternoon occupation boy 
11,"He sat and pondered for an hour or more, sometimes fancying he had hit upon the object of his search, and sometimes finding himself quite off the tack.  Had Cripps only known what care and diligence was being bestowed on him that afternoon he would assuredly have been highly nattered.",sit ponder hour more fancy hit object search find tack know care diligence bestow afternoon natter 
12,"At length he seemed to come to a satisfactory decision, and, naturally exhausted by such severe mental exertion, Loman quitted his study and sought in the playground the fresh air and diversion he so much needed. One of the first boys he met there was Simon.  ""Hullo, Loman!"" said that amiable genius, ""would you have believed it?""",length seem come satisfactory decision exhaust such severe mental exertion quit study seek playground fresh air diversion need first boy meet say amiable genius believe

15,"""Look here! you'd better hold your row!"" said Loman, surlily, ""unless you want a hiding.""",look hold row say surlily want hiding 
16,"""Oh; it's not that, you know.  What I meant was about Greenfield senior. Isn't that a go?""",know mean senior go 
17,"""What about him?  Why can't you talk like an ordinary person, and not like a howling jackass?""",talk ordinary person howling jackass

19,"""What paper?"" said Loman, impatiently.  ""The one that was stolen out of the Doctor's study, you know.  Isn't that a go?  But we're going to hush it up.  Honour bright!""",paper say one steal study know go go hush honour bright 
20,"Loman's face at that moment was anything but encouraging.  Somehow, this roundabout way of the poet's seemed particularly aggravating to him, for he turned quite pale with rage, and, seizing the unhappy bard by the throat, said, with an oath, ""What do you mean, you miserable beast? What about the paper?""",face moment encouraging roundabout way poet seem aggravate turn pale rage seize unhappy bard throat say oath mean miserable beast paper 
21,"""Oh!"" said Simon, not at all put about by this rough handling--""why, don't you know? _we_ know who took it, we do; but we're all going to--""",say put rough handling know know take go 
22,"But at this point Simon's speech was interrupted, for the very good reason that Loman's grip on his throat became so very tight that the wretched poet nearly turned black in the face.",point speech interrupt good reason grip throat become tight wretched poet turn black face 
23,"With another oath the Sixth Form boy exclaimed, ""Who took it?""",oath sixth boy exclaim take

35,"""Yes; that is, he doesn't say he didn't; and all the fellows are going to cut him dead, but we mean to hush it up if we can.""",say fellow go cut dead mean hush 
36,"""Hush yourself up, that's what you'd better do,"" said Loman, turning his back unceremoniously on his informant, and proceeding, full of this strange news, on his solitary walk.  What was in his mind as he went along I cannot tell you.  I fancy it was hardly sorrow at the thought that a schoolfellow could stoop to a mean, dishonest action, nor, I think, was it indignation on Wraysford's or his own account.",hush do say turn back informant proceeding full strange news solitary walk mind go tell fancy sorrow thought schoolfellow stake mean dishonest action think indignation own account 
37,"Indeed, the few boys who passed Loman that afternoon were struck with the cheerfulness of his appearance.  Considering he had been miserably beaten in the scholarship examination, this show of satisfaction was all the more remarkable.",few boy pass afternoon strike cheerfulness appearance consider beat scholarship examination show satisfaction remarkable 
38,"""The fellow seems quite proud of himself,"" said Callonby to Wren as they passed him.",fellow seem proud say pass

42,"""Wren and I are going a stroll together,"" said Callonby, coldly; ""good-bye.""",go stroll say good bye

44,"""Considering I was sitting on the same form with you when they were, I suppose I did,"" said Wren.",consider sit same form suppose say 
45,"""That's all right,"" said Loman, evidently determined not to notice the snubbing bestowed on him.  ""Mine wasn't a very loud score, was it? Seventy!  I was surprised it was as much!""",right say determined notice snubbing bestow loud score surprise much

""But the fact is, some one did take it--you can guess who--and you don't suppose I was going to be fool enough to take any trouble over my answers when I knew one of the other fellows had had the paper in his pocket a day and a half before the exam.""  And here Loman laughed.",think say fact take guess suppose go fool take trouble answer know other fellow have paper pocket day half exam laugh

As usual, he was as surprised as he was delighted at the honour done him, and could not imagine for the life of him to what he was indebted for so charming a condescension.  In other words, he left Loman to open the business as best he could.",have next afternoon peculiar pleasure welcoming young friend patron hospitable roof usual surprised delight honour do imagine life indebt charming condescension other word leave open business good
