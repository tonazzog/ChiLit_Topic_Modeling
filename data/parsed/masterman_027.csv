After breakfast, William and Juno finished the pond where the walls had not been raised high enough; and, when they returned to dinner, reported that their task was completed.  Mr Seagrave also said that he had, he thought, cleared quite ground enough for the present; and as Mrs Seagrave wanted Juno to help her to wash the linen that afternoon, it was agreed that William, Ready, and Mr Seagrave should all go down to the garden, and put in the potatoes.",next morning breakfast hand employ get turtle pond breakfast finish pond wall raise high return dinner report task complete say think clear ground present want help wash linen afternoon agree ready go garden put potato
