2,"      ""We are not worst at once; the course of evil      Begins so slowly, and from such slight source,      An infant's hand might stop the breach with clay;      But let the stream grow wider, and Philosophy--      Ay, and Religion too--may strive in vain      To stem the headlong current!""--ANON.",bad course evil begin such slight source infant hand stop breach clay let stream grow wide philosophy religion strive vain stem headlong current 
3,"With intense delight Eric heard it announced next morning, when the new school-list was read, that he had got his remove into the ""Shell,"" as the form was called which intervened between the fourth and the fifth. Russell, Owen, and Montagu also got their removes with him, but his other friends were left for the present in the form below.",intense delight hear announce next morning new school list read get remove form call interven fourth fifth get remove other friend leave present form 
4,"Mr. Rose, hiss new master, was in every respect a great contrast with Mr. Gordon. He was not so brilliant in his acquirements, nor so vigorous in his teaching, and therefore clever boys did not catch fire from him so much as from the fourth-form master. But he was a far truer and deeper Christian; and, with no less scrupulous a sense of honor, and detestation of every form of moral obliquity, he never yielded to those storms of passionate indignation which Mr. Gordon found it impossible to control. Disappointed in early life, subjected to the deepest and most painful trials, Mr. Rose's fine character had come out like gold from the flame. He now lived in and for the boys alone, and his whole life was one long self-devotion to their service and interests. The boys felt this, and even the worst of them, in their worst moments, loved and honored Mr. Rose. But he was not seeking for gratitude, which he neither expected nor required; he asked no affection in return for his self-denials; he worked with a pure spirit of human and self-sacrificing love, happy beyond all payment if ever he were instrumental in saving one of his charge from evil, or turning one wanderer from the error of his ways.",new master respect great contrast brilliant acquirement vigorous teaching clever boy catch fire fourth form master truer deep scrupulous sense honor detestation form moral obliquity yield storm passionate indignation find impossible control disappointed early life subject deep painful trial fine character come gold flame live boy whole life long self devotion service interest boy feel bad bad moment love honor seek gratitude expect require ask affection return self denial work pure spirit human self sacrifice love happy payment instrumental save charge evil turn wanderer error way 
5,"He was an unmarried man, and therefore took no boarders himself, but lived in the school-buildings, and had the care of the boys in Dr. Rowlands' house.",unmarried man take border live school building have care boy house 
6,"Such was the master under whom Eric was now placed, and the boy was sadly afraid that an evil report would have reached his ears, and given him already an unfavorable impression. But he was soon happily undeceived. Mr. Rose at once addressed him with much kindness, and he felt that, however bad he had been before, he would now have an opportunity to turn over a new leaf, and begin again a career of hope. He worked admirably at first, and even beat, for the first week or two, his old competitors, Owen and Russell.",such master place boy afraid evil report reach ear give unfavorable impression undeceived address much kindness feel bad have opportunity turn new leaf begin career hope work first beat first week old competitor 
7,"From the beginning, Mr. Rose took a deep interest in him. Few could look at the boy's bright blue eyes and noble face without doing so, and the more when they knew that his father and mother were thousands of miles away, leaving him alone in the midst of so many dangers. Often the master asked him, and Russell, and Owen, and Montagu, to supper with him in the library, which gave them the privilege of sitting up later than usual, and enjoying a more quiet and pleasant evening than was possible in the noisy rooms. Boys and master were soon quite at home with each other, and in this way Mr. Rose had an opportunity of instilling many a useful warning without the formality of regular discipline or stereotyped instruction.",beginning take deep interest few look boy bright blue eye noble face do more know father mother thousand mile leave alone midst many danger master ask supper library give privilege sit usual enjoy quiet pleasant evening possible noisy room boy master home other way have opportunity instil many useful warning formality regular discipline stereotyp instruction 
8,"Eric found the life of the ""boarders' room"" far rougher than he had expected. Work was out of the question there, except during the hours of preparation, and the long dark winter evenings were often dull enough. Sometimes, indeed, they would all join in some regular indoor boys' game like ""baste the bear,"" or ""high-cockolorum;"" or they would have amusing ""ghost-hunts,"" as they called them, after some dressed-up boy among the dark corridors and staircases. This was good enough fun, but at other times they got tired of games, and could not get them up, and then numbers of boys felt the idle time hang heavy on their hands. When this was the case, some of the worse sort, as might have been expected, would fill up their leisure with bullying or mischief.",find life border room rougher expect work question hour preparation long dark winter evening dull join regular indoor boys' game baste bear high cockolorum have amusing ghost hunt call dress boy dark corridor staircase good enough fun other time get tired game get number boy feel idle time hang heavy hand case bad sort expect fill leisure bullying mischief 
9,"For some time they had a form of diversion which disgusted and annoyed Eric exceedingly. On each of the long iron-bound deal tables were placed two or three tallow candles in tin candlesticks, and this was the only light the boys had. Of course, these candles often, wanted snuffing, and as snuffers were sure to be thrown about and broken as soon as they were brought into the room, the only resource was to snuff them with the fingers, at which all the boys became great adepts from necessity. One evening Barker, having snuffed the candle, suddenly and slyly put the smouldering wick unnoticed on the head of a little quiet inoffensive fellow named Wright, who happened to be sitting next to him. It went on smouldering for some time without Wright's perceiving it, and at last Barker, highly delighted, exclaimed--",time have form diversion disgust annoy long iron bound deal table place tallow candle tin candlestick only light boy have course candle want snuff snuffer sure throw break bring room only resource snuff finger boy become great adept necessity evening snuff candle put smoulder wick unnoticed head little quiet inoffensive fellow name happen sit go smoulder time perceive last delighted exclaim 
10,"""I see a chimney,"" and laughed.",see chimney laugh 
11,"Four or five boys looked up, and very soon every one in the room had noticed the trick except little Wright himself, who unconsciously wrote on at the letter he was sending home.",boy look one room notice trick little write letter send 
12,"Eric did not like this; but not wishing to come across Barker again, said nothing, and affected not to have observed. But Russell said quietly, ""There's something on your head, Wright,"" and the little boy putting up his hand, hastily brushed off the horrid wick.",like wish come say affect observe say be head little boy put hand brush horrid wick 
13,"""What a shame!"" he said, as it fell on his letter, and made a smudge.",shame say fall letter make smudge 
14,"""Who told you to interfere?"" said Barker, turning fiercely to Russell. Russell, as usual, took not the slightest notice of him, and Barker, after a little more bluster, repeated the trick on another boy. This time Russell thought that every one might be on the look out for himself, and so went on with his work. But when Barker again chanted maliciously--",tell interfere say turn usual take slight notice little more bluster repeat trick boy time think one look go work chant 
15,"""I see a chimney,"" every boy who happened to be reading or writing, uneasily felt to discover this time he was himself the victim or no; and so things continued for half an hour.",see chimney boy happen read write feel discover time victim thing continue hour 
16,"Ridiculous and disgusting as this folly was, it became, when constantly repeated, very annoying. A boy could not sit down to any quiet work without constant danger of having some one creep up behind him and put the offensive fragment of smoking snuff on his head; and neither Barker nor any of his little gang of imitators seemed disposed to give up their low mischief.",ridiculous disgusting folly become repeat annoying boy sit quiet work constant danger have one creep put offensive fragment smoking snuff head little gang imitator seem dispose give low mischief 
17,"One night, when the usual exclamation was made, Eric felt sure, from seeing several boys looking at him, that this time some one had been treating him in the same way. He indignantly shook his head, and sure enough the bit of wick dropped off. Eric was furious, and springing up, he shouted--",night usual exclamation make feel sure see several boy look time one treat same way shake head sure bit wick drop furious spring shout

19,"""You'll have to sit it then,"" said Barker.",have sit say 
20,"""O, it was _you_ who did it, was it? Then take that;"" and, seizing one of the tin candlesticks, Eric hurled it at Barker's head. Barker dodged, but the edge of it cut open his eyebrow as it whizzed by, and the blood flowed fast.",do take seize tin candlestick hurl head dodg edge cut open eyebrow whizz blood flow 
21,"""I'll kill you for that,"" said Barker, leaping at Eric, and seizing him by the hair.",kill say leap seize hair 
22,"""You'll get killed yourself then, you brute,"" said Upton, Russell's cousin, a fifth-form boy, who had just come into the room--and he boxed his ears as a premonitory admonition. ""But, I say, young un,"" continued he to Eric, ""this kind of thing won't do, you snow. You'll get into rows if you shy candlesticks at fellows' heads at that rate.""",kill brute say cousin fifth form boy come room box ear premonitory admonition say young continue kind thing do snow get row shy candlestick fellow head rate 
23,"""He has been making the room intolerable for the last month by his filthy tricks,"" said Eric hotly; ""some one must stop him, and I will somehow, if no one else does.""",make room intolerable last month filthy trick say stop else 
24,"""It wasn't I who put the thing on your head, you passionate young fool,"" growled Barker.",put thing head passionate young fool growl 
25,"""Who was it then? How was I to know? You began it.""",know begin 
26,"""You shut up, Barker,"" said Upton; ""I've heard of your ways before, and when I catch you at your tricks, I'll teach you a lesson. Come up to my study, Williams, if you like.""",shut say hear way catch trick teach lesson come study like 
27,"Upton was a fine sturdy fellow of eighteen, immensely popular in the school for his prowess and good looks. He hated bullying, and often interfered to protect little boys, who accordingly idolised him, and did anything he told them very willingly. He meant to do no harm, but he did great harm. He was full of misdirected impulses, and had a great notion of being manly, which he thought consisted in a fearless disregard of all school rules, and the performance of the wildest tricks. For this reason he was never very intimate with his cousin Russell, whom he liked very much, but who was too scrupulous and independent to please him. Eric, on the other hand, was just the boy to take his fancy, and to admire him in return; his life, strength, and pluck, made him a ready pupil in all schemes of mischief, and Upton, who had often noticed him, would have been the first to shudder had he known how far his example went to undermine all Eric's lingering good resolutions, and ruin for ever the boy of whom he was so fond.",fine sturdy fellow popular school prowess good look hate bullying interfer protect little boy idolise do tell mean do harm do great harm full misdirected impulse have great notion manly think consist fearless disregard school rule performance wild trick reason intimate cousin like scrupulous independent please other hand boy take fancy admire return life strength pluck make ready pupil scheme mischief notice first shudder know example go undermine linger good resolution ruin boy fond 
28,"From this time Eric was much in Upton's study, and constantly by his side in the playground. In spite of their disparity in age and position in the school, they became sworn friends, though, their friendship was broken every now and then by little quarrels, which united them all the more closely after they had not spoken to each other perhaps for a week.",time study side playground spite disparity age position school become swear friend friendship break little quarrel unite speak other week 
29,"""Your cousin Upton has 'taken up' Williams,"" said Montagu to Russell one afternoon, as he saw the two strolling together on the beach, with Eric's arm in Upton's.",cousin take say afternoon see stroll beach arm 
30,"""Yes, I am sorry for it.""",sorry 
31,"""So am I. We shan't see so much of him now.""",see much 
32,"""O, that's not my only reason,"" answered Russell, who had a rare habit of always going straight to the point.",only reason answer have rare habit go point 
33,"""You mean you don't like the 'taking-up' system.""",mean like taking system 
34,"""No, Montagu; I used once to have fine theories about it. I used to fancy that a big fellow would do no end of good to one lower in the school, and that the two would stand to each other in the relation of knight to squire. You know what the young knights were taught, Monty--to keep their bodies under, and bring them into subjection; to love God, and speak the truth always. That sounds very grand and noble to me. But when a big fellow takes up a little one _you_ know pretty well that _those_ are not the kind of lessons he teaches.""",use have fine theory use fancy big fellow do end good low school stand other relation knight squire know young knight teach keep body bring subjection love speak truth sound grand noble big fellow take little one _you_ know _those_ kind lesson teach 
35,"""No, Russell; you're quite right. It's bad for a fellow in every way. First of all, it keeps him in an unnatural sort of dependence; then ten to one it makes him conceited, and prevents his character from really coming out well. And besides, the young chap generally gets paid out in kicks and abuse from the jealousy and contempt of the rest; and if his protector happens to leave, or anything of that kind, woe betide him!""",right bad fellow way first keep unnatural sort dependence make conceited prevent character come young chap pay kick abuse jealousy contempt rest protector happen leave kind woe betide 
36,"""No fear for Eric in that line, though,"" said Russell; ""he can hold his own pretty well against any one. And after all, he is a most jolly fellow. I don't think even Upton will spoil him; it's chiefly the soft self-indulgent fellows, who are all straw and no iron, who get spoilt by being 'taken up.'""",fear line say hold own one jolly fellow think spoil soft self indulgent fellow straw iron get spoil take 
37,"Russell was partly right. Eric learnt a great deal of harm from Upton, and the misapplied hero-worship led to bad results. But he was too manly a little fellow, and had too much self-respect, to sink into the effeminate condition which usually grows on the young delectables who have the misfortune to be ""taken up.""",right learn great deal harm misapply hero worship lead bad result manly little fellow have much self respect sink effeminate condition grow young delectable have misfortune take 
38,"Nor did he in the least drop his old friends, except Owen. A coolness grew up between the latter and Eric, not unmingled with a little mutual contempt. Eric sneered at Owen as a fellow who did nothing but grind all day long, and had no geniality in him; while Owen pitied the love of popularity which so often led Eric into delinquencies, which he himself despised. Owen had, indeed, but few friends in the school; the only boy who knew him well enough to respect and like him thoroughly was Russell, who found in him the only one who took the same high, ground with himself. But Russell loved the good in every one, and was loved by all in return, and Eric he loved most of all, while he often mourned over his increasing failures.",least drop old friend coolness grow latter unmingle little mutual contempt sneer fellow do grind day have geniality pity love popularity lead delinquency despise few friend school only boy know respect like find only one take same high ground love good one love return love most mourn increase failure 
39,"One day as the two were walking together in the green playground, Mr. Gordon passed by; and as the boys touched their caps, he nodded and smiled pleasantly at Russell, but hardly noticed, and did not return Eric's salute. He had begun to dislike the latter more and more, and had given him up altogether as one of the reprobates.",day walk green playground pass boy touch cap nod smile notice return salute begin dislike latter more more give reprobate 
40,"""What a surly devil that is,"" said Eric, when he had passed; ""did you see how he purposely cut me?""",surly devil say pass see cut 
41,"""A surly ...? Oh Eric, that's the first time I ever heard you swear.""",surly first time hear swear 
42,"Eric blushed. He hadn't meant the word to slip out in Russell's hearing, though similar expressions were common enough in his talk with other boys. But he didn't like to be reproved, even by Russell, and in the ready spirit of self-defence, he answered--",blush mean word slip hearing similar expression common talk other boy like reprove ready spirit self defence answer 
43,"""Pooh, Edwin, you don't call that swearing, do you? You're so strict, so religious, you know. I love you for it, but then, there are none like you. Nobody thinks anything of swearing here.""",call swearing strict religious know love be think swearing 
44,Russell was silent.,silent 
45,"""Besides, what can be the harm of it? it means nothing. I was thinking the other night, and I concluded that you and Owen are the only two fellows here who don't swear.""",harm mean think other night conclude only fellow swear 
46,Russell still said nothing.,say 
47,"""And, after all, I didn't swear; I only called that fellow a surly devil.""",swear call fellow surly 
48,"""O, hush! Eric, hush!"" said Russell sadly. ""You wouldn't have said so half-a-year ago.""",say say half year 
49,"Eric knew what he meant. The image of his father and mother rose before him, as they sate far away in their lonely Indian home, thinking of him, praying for him, centring all their hopes in him. In him!--and he knew how many things he was daily doing and saying, which would cut them to the heart. He knew that all his moral consciousness was fast vanishing, and leaving him a bad and reckless boy.",know mean image father mother rise sate lonely indian home think pray centre hope know many thing daily do say cut heart know moral consciousness fast vanish leave bad reckless boy 
50,"In a moment, all this passed through his mind. He remembered how shocked he had been at swearing at first; and even when it became too familiar to shock him, how he determined never to fall into the habit himself. Then he remembered how gradually it had become quite a graceful sound in his ears; a sound of entire freedom and independence of moral restraint; an open casting off, as it were, of all authority, so that he had begun to admire it, particularly in Duncan, and above all, in his new hero, Upton; and he recollected how, at last, an oath had one day slipped out suddenly in his own words, and how strange it sounded to him, and how Upton smiled to hear it, though conscience had reproached him bitterly; but now that he had done it once, it became less dreadful, and gradually grew common enough, till even conscience hardly reminded him that he was doing wrong.",moment pass mind remember shocked swear first become familiar shock determine fall habit remember become graceful sound ear sound entire freedom independence moral restraint open casting authority begin admire new hero recollect last oath day slip own word strange sound smile hear conscience reproach do become dreadful grow common conscience remind do wrong 
51,"He thought of all this, and hung his head. Pride struggled with him for a moment, but at length he answered, ""O Edwin, I fear I am getting utterly bad; I wish I were more like you,"" he added, in a low sad tone.",think hang head struggle moment length answer fear get bad wish more add low sad tone 
52,"""Dear Eric, I have no right to say it, full of faults as I am myself; but you will be so much happier, if you try not to yield to all the bad things round us. Remember, I know more of school than you.""",dear have right say full fault happy try yield bad thing remember know more school
