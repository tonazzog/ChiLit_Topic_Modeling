2," MATILDA’S ears were red and shiny. So were her cheeks. Her hands were red too. This was because Pridmore had washed her. It was not the usual washing, which makes you clean and comfortable, but the “thorough good wash,” which makes you burn and smart till you wish you could be like the poor little savages who do not know anything, and run about bare in the sun, and only go into the water when they are hot.",ear red shiny cheek hand red wash usual washing make clean comfortable thorough good wash make burn smart wish poor little savage know run bare sun go water hot

5,"But Pridmore only said, “Stuff and nonsense,” and then she said, “don’t wriggle so, child, for goodness’ sake.”",say stuff nonsense say wriggle child goodness sake 
6,"Pridmore was Matilda’s nursemaid. Matilda sometimes found her trying. Matilda was quite right in believing that savage children do not wear frocks that hurt. It is also true that savage children are not over-washed, over-brushed, over-combed, gloved, booted, and hatted and taken in an omnibus to Streatham to see their Great-aunt Willoughby. This was intended to be Matilda’s fate. Her mother had arranged it. Pridmore had prepared her for it. Matilda, knowing resistance to be vain, had submitted to it.",nursemaid find try right believe savage child wear frock hurt true savage child wash brush comb glove boot hatt take omnibus see great aunt intend fate mother arrange prepare know resistance vain submit 
7,"But Destiny had not been consulted, and Destiny had plans of its own for Matilda.",consult have plan own 
8,"When the last button of Matilda’s boots had been fastened (the button-hook always had a nasty temper, especially when it was hurried, and that day it bit a little piece of Matilda’s leg quite spitefully) the wretched child was taken downstairs and put on a chair in the hall to wait while Pridmore popped her own things on.",last button boot fasten button hook have nasty temper hurry day bite little piece leg wretched child take put chair hall wait pop own thing 
9,"“I shan’t be a minute,” said Pridmore. Matilda knew better. She seated herself to wait, and swung her legs miserably. She had been to her Great-aunt Willoughby’s before, and she knew exactly what to expect. She would be asked about her lessons, and how many marks she had, and whether she had been a good girl. I can’t think why grown-up people don’t see how impertinent these questions are. Suppose you were to answer, “I’m top of my class, Auntie, thank you, and I’m very good. And now let’s have a little talk about you. Aunt, dear, how much money have you got, and have you been scolding the servants again, or have you tried to be good and patient as a properly brought up aunt should be, eh, dear?”",minute say know good seat wait swing leg great aunt know expect ask lesson many mark have good girl think grow person see impertinent question suppose answer top class thank good let have little talk aunt dear much money get scold servant try good patient bring aunt dear

13,"Then she would be sent to walk in the garden—the garden had a gritty path, and geraniums and calceolarias and lobelias in the beds. You might not pick anything. There would be minced veal at dinner, with three-cornered bits of toast round the dish, and a tapioca pudding. Then the long afternoon with a book, a bound volume of the “Potterer’s Saturday Night”—nasty small print—and all the stories about children who died young because they were too good for this world.",send walk garden garden have gritty path geranium calceolarias lobelia bed pick be mince veal dinner corner bit toast dish tapioca pudding long afternoon book bound volume night nasty small print story child die young good world 
14,"Matilda wriggled wretchedly. If she had been a little less uncomfortable she would have cried, but her new frock was too tight and prickly to let her forget it for a moment, even in tears.",wriggle little uncomfortable cry new frock tight prickly let forget moment tear

21,"Now Pridmore was a very careful person, though cross, but even the most careful persons make mistakes sometimes—and she must have taken the wrong omnibus, or this story could never have happened, and where should we all have been then? This shows you that even mistakes are sometimes valuable, so do not be hard on grown-up people if they are wrong sometimes. You know after all, it hardly ever happens.",careful person cross careful person make mistake take wrong omnibus story happen show mistake valuable hard grow person wrong know happen 
22,"It was a very bright green and gold omnibus, and inside the cushions were green and very soft. Matilda and her nursemaid had it all to themselves, and Matilda began to feel more comfortable, especially as she had wriggled till she had burst one of her shoulder-seams and got more room for herself inside her frock.",bright green gold omnibus cushion green soft nursemaid have begin feel comfortable wriggle burst shoulder seam get more room frock 
23,"So she said, “I’m sorry I was cross, Priddy dear.”",say sorry cross dear

25,"It was certainly the wrong omnibus because instead of jolting slowly along dusty streets, it went quickly and smoothly down a green lane, with flowers in the hedges, and green trees overhead. Matilda was so delighted that she sat quite still, a very rare thing with her. Pridmore was reading a penny story called “The Vengeance of the Lady Constantia,” so she did not notice anything.",wrong omnibus jolt dusty street go green lane flower hedge green tree delighted sit rare thing read penny story call notice

30,"The driver was the most beautiful omnibus driver you ever saw, and his clothes were like him in beauty. He had white silk stockings and a ruffled silk shirt of white, and his coat and breeches were green and gold.

40,"When they looked round them, no, this was certainly not Streatham Common.

The houses were grouped round a village green, on which children in pretty loose frocks or smocks were playing happily.",look wrong omnibus bring strange village neatest sweetest reddest greenest clean prettiest village world house group village green child loose frock smock play 
41,"Not a tight armhole was to be seen, or even imagined in that happy spot. Matilda swelled herself out and burst three hooks and a bit more of the shoulder seam.",tight armhole see imagine happy spot swell burst hook bit more shoulder seam 
42,"The shops seemed a little queer, Matilda thought. The names somehow did not match the things that were to be sold. For instance, where it said “Elias Groves, Tinsmith,” there were loaves and buns in the window, and the shop that had “Baker” over the door, was full of perambulators—the grocer and the wheelwright seemed to have changed names, or shops, or something—and Miss Skimpling, Dressmaker or Milliner, had her shop window full of pork and sausage meat.",shop seem little queer think name match thing sell instance say be loaf bun window shop have door full perambulator grocer wheelwright seem change name shop have shop window full pork sausage meat

48,"Pridmore muttered something which the little boy did not hear. Matilda caught a few words. “Smacked,” “bed,” “bread and water”—familiar words all of them.",mutter little boy hear catch few word smack bed bread water familiar word 
49,"“If it’s a game,” said Matilda to the boy, “I should like to play.”",game say boy like play 
50,He frowned.,frown 
51,"“I advise you to come at once,” he said, so sternly that even Pridmore was a little frightened. “His Majesty’s Palace is in this direction.” He walked away, and Matilda made a sudden jump, dragged her hand out of Pridmore’s, and ran after him. So Pridmore had to follow, still grumbling.",advise come say little frighten direction walk make sudden jump drag hand run have follow grumble 
52,"The Palace stood in a great green park dotted with white-flowered may-bushes. It was not at all like an English palace, St. James’s or Buckingham Palace, for instance, because it was very beautiful and very clean. When they got in they saw that the Palace was hung with green silk. The footmen had green and gold liveries, and all the courtiers’ clothes were the same colours.",stand great green park dot white flower bush english palace instance beautiful clean get see hang green silk footmen have green gold livery courtier clothes same colour

60,"“Yes,” said Matilda, “Pridmore is—Oh, dear!”",say dear 
61,"For before her eyes she saw an awful change taking place in Pridmore. In an instant all that was left of the original Pridmore were the boots and the hem of her skirt—the top part of her had changed into painted iron and glass, and even as Matilda looked the bit of skirt that was left got flat and hard and square. The two feet turned into four feet, and they were iron feet, and there was no more Pridmore.",eye see awful change take place instant leave original boot hem skirt top part change paint iron glass look bit skirt leave get flat hard square foot turn foot iron foot be more

65,But there was no chocolate to be seen through the glass of the machine that once had been Pridmore. Only little rolls of paper.,be chocolate see glass machine little roll paper

88,"Matilda looked about her between the games and admired everything very much, and asked questions, of course. There was a very large bird chained to a perch in the middle of a very large cage. Indeed the cage was so big that it took up all one side of the rose-garden. The bird had a yellow crest like a cockatoo and a very large bill like a toucan.

124,"“Oh, dear!” she cried, “I feel so different. Oh! wait a minute. Oh! whatever is it? Oh!”",dear cry feel different wait minute

126,"But in the morning Matilda’s head felt strangely clear; only when she came down to breakfast full of plans for helping the King, she found that the Cockatoucan must have laughed in the night, for the beautiful Palace had turned into a butcher’s shop, and the King, who was too wise to fight against Fate, had tucked up his royal robes, and was busy in the shop weighing out six ounces of the best mutton-chops for a child with a basket.",morning head feel clear come breakfast full plan help find laugh night beautiful turn butcher shop wise fight tuck royal robe busy shop weigh ounce good mutton chop child basket

128,"So the King settled down to business, respected by his subjects, who had all, since the coming of the Cockatoucan, had their little ups and downs. And Matilda kept the books and wrote out the bills, and really they were both rather happy. Pridmore, disguised as the automatic machine, stood in the shop and attracted many customers. They used to bring their children, and make the poor innocents put their pennies in, and then read Pridmore’s good advice. Some parents are so harsh. And the Princess sat in the back garden with the Cockatoucan, and Matilda played with her every afternoon. But one day, as the King was driving through another kingdom, the King of that kingdom looked out of one of his Palace windows, and laughed as the King went by, and shouted, “Butcher!”",settle business respect subject coming have little up down keep book write bill happy disguise automatic machine stand shop attract many customer use bring child make poor innocent put penny read good advice parent harsh sit back garden play afternoon day drive kingdom kingdom look window laugh go shout

131,"So the King sent his Army, and the enemy were crushed. The Bird laughed the King back into his throne, and laughed away the butcher’s shop just in time for his Majesty to proclaim a general holiday, and to organise a magnificent reception for the Army. Matilda now helped the King to manage everything. She wonderfully enjoyed the new delightful feeling of being clever, so that she felt it was indeed too bad when the Cockatoucan laughed just as the reception was beautifully arranged. It laughed, and the general holiday was turned into an income tax; the magnificent reception changed itself to a royal reprimand, and the Army itself suddenly became a discontented Sunday-school treat, and had to be fed with buns and brought home in brakes, crying.",send enemy crush bird laugh throne laugh butcher shop time proclaim general holiday organise magnificent reception help manage enjoy new delightful feeling clever feel bad laugh reception arrange laugh general holiday turn income tax magnificent reception change royal reprimand become discontented school treat have feed bun bring brake cry

He hurried on, but his beautiful crown grew large and brassy, and was set with cheap glass in the worst possible taste. His robe turned from velvet and ermine to flannelette and rabbit’s fur. His sceptre grew twenty feet long and extremely awkward to carry. But he persevered, his royal blood was up.",hurry road open bird put head side laugh go hurry beautiful crown grow large brassy set cheap glass bad possible taste robe turn velvet ermine flannelette rabbit fur sceptre grow foot long awkward carry persever royal blood

137,"But when he got there, he was so agitated that he could not remember which was the right key to open Parliament with, and in the end he hampered the lock and so could not open Parliament at all, and members of Parliament went about making speeches in the roads to the great hindrance of the traffic.",get agitated remember right key open end hamper lock open member go make speech road great hindrance traffic 
138,The poor King went home and burst into tears.,poor go burst tear 
139,"“Matilda,” he said, “this is too much. You have always been a comfort to me. You stood by me when I was a butcher; you kept the books; you booked the orders; you ordered the stock. If you really are clever enough, now is the time to help me. If you won’t, I’ll give up the business. I’ll leave off being a King. I’ll go and be a butcher in the Camberwell New Road, and I will get another little girl to keep my books, not you.”",say much comfort stand butcher keep book book order order stock clever time help give business leave go butcher new get little girl keep book 
140,"This decided Matilda. She said, “Very well, your Majesty, then give me leave to prowl at night. Perhaps I shall find out what makes the Cockatoucan laugh; if I can do that, we can take care he never gets it, whatever it is.”",decide say give leave prowl night find make laugh do take care get 
141,"“Ah!” said the poor King, “if you could only do that.”",say poor do 
142,"When Matilda went to bed that night, she did not go to sleep. She lay and waited till all the Palace was quiet, and then she crept softly, pussily, mousily to the garden, where the Cockatoucan’s cage was, and she hid behind a white rosebush, and looked and listened. Nothing happened till it was gray dawn, and then it was only the Cockatoucan who woke up. But when the sun was round and red over the Palace roof, something came creeping, creeping, pussily, mousily out of the Palace; and it looked like a yard and a half of white tape creeping along; and it was the Princess herself.",go bed night go sleep lay wait quiet creep garden cage hide white rosebush look listen happen gray dawn wake sun red roof come creep creep look yard half white tape creep 
143,"She came quietly up to the cage, and squeezed herself between the bars; they were very narrow bars, but a yard and a half of white tape can go through the bars of any birdcage I ever saw. And the Princess went up to the Cockatoucan and tickled him under his wings till he laughed aloud. Then, quick as thought, the Princess squeezed through the bars, and was back in her room before the bird had finished laughing. Matilda went back to bed. Next day all the sparrows had turned into cart horses, and the roads were impassable.",come cage squeeze bar narrow bar yard half white tape go bar birdcage see go tickle wing laugh quick think squeeze bar room bird finish laugh go bed next day sparrow turn cart horse road impassable

146,"“Matilda,” she said simply, “you have a noble heart. No one else has ever asked me that, though they tried to cure it. And I couldn’t answer till I was asked, could I?

154,"Of course, Matilda went at once to the King, and while she was on her way the Cockatoucan happened to laugh. When she reached the King, he was in no condition for ordering dinner, for he had turned into a villa-residence, replete with every modern improvement. Matilda only recognised him, as he stood sadly in the Park, by the crown that stuck crookedly on one of the chimney-pots, and the border of ermine along the garden path. So she ordered the Princess’s favourite pudding on her own responsibility, and the whole Court had it every day for dinner, till there was no single courtier but loathed the very sight of bread and milk, and there was hardly one who would not have run a mile rather than meet a pear-drop. Even Matilda herself got rather tired of it, though being clever, she knew how good bread and milk was for her.",course go way happen laugh reach condition order dinner turn villa residence replete modern improvement recognise stand crown stick chimney pot border ermine garden path order favourite pudding own responsibility whole court have day dinner be single courtier loath very sight bread milk be run mile meet pear drop get tired clever know good bread milk

Her thread-paper gowns had to be let out, and let out, till there were no more turnings in left to be let out, and then she had to wear the old ones that Matilda had been wearing, and then to have new ones.

157,"When the Princess was as fat as any Princess ought to be, Matilda went to her one day, and threw her arms round her and kissed her. The Princess kissed her back, and said, “Very well, I _am_ sorry then, but I didn’t want to say so, but now I will. And the Cockatoucan never laughs except when he’s tickled. So there! He hates to laugh.”",fat go day throw arm kiss kiss back say sorry want say laugh tickle hate laugh

160,"“But how can any one be happy?” asked Matilda, severely, “when every one is turned into something they weren’t meant to be? There’s your dear father—he’s a desirable villa—the Prime Minister was a little boy, and he got back again, and now he’s turned into a Comic Opera. Half the Palace housemaids are breakers, dashing themselves against the Palace crockery: the Navy, to a man, are changed to French poodles, and the Army to German sausages. Your favourite nurse is now a flourishing steam laundry, and I, alas! am too clever by half.

The only way to make everything come right again would be—but it can’t be done! If we could only make him laugh on the wrong side of his mouth. That’s the secret. He told me so.

166,"The Princess opened the cage-door with the Prime Minister’s key, which a tenor singer had found at the beginning of his music. It was also the key of the comic opera. She crept up behind the Cockatoucan and tickled him under both wings. He fixed his baleful eye on the red Automatic Machine and laughed long and loud; he saw the red iron and glass change before his eyes into the form of Pridmore.

170,"But instantly all the things changed back as if by magic to what they had been before.

So he has not quite lost his old power. Only now he is in halves, any power he may have has to be used without laughing.

But Matilda was very sleepy. She had been clever for so long that she was quite tired out. It is indeed a very fatiguing thing, as no doubt you know. And the soldiers must have been sleepy too, for one by one the whole Army disappeared, and by the time Pridmore and Matilda reached home there was only one left, and he was the policeman at the corner.",grateful send escort whole dress sausage skin uniform dazzle beauty drum banner see sleepy clever tired fatiguing thing doubt know soldier sleepy whole disappear time reach be left policeman corner
