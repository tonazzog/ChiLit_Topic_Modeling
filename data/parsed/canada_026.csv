1,CHAPTER XXVI.,
2," It was very nearly five weeks before Henry returned from his expedition to Montreal. During this time, the Colonel had repeated his visit and made arrangements with Mr. Campbell. A party of twenty soldiers had been sent to work at felling timber and splitting rails, for whose services Mr. Campbell paid as before. The winter house and palisade fence for the sheep were put in hand, and great progress was made in a short time, now that so many people were employed. They had also examined the stream for some distance, to ascertain which would be the most eligible site for the water-mill, and had selected one nearly half a mile from the shore of the lake, and where there was a considerable fall, and the stream ran with great rapidity. It was not, however, expected that the mill would be erected until the following year, as it was necessary to have a millwright and all the machinery from either Montreal or Quebec. It was intended that the estimate of the expense should be given in, the contract made, and the order given during the autumn, so that it might be all ready for the spring of the next year. It was on a Monday morning that Henry arrived from the fort, where he had staid the Sunday, having reached it late on Saturday night. The _bateaux_, with the stock and stores, he had left at the fort; they were to come round during the day, but Henry's impatience to see the family would not allow him to wait. He was, as may be supposed, joyfully received, and, as soon as the first recognitions were over, he proceeded to acquaint his father with what he had done. He had obtained from a Canadian farmer forty ewes of very fair stock, although not any thing equal to the English; but the agent had worked hard for him, and procured him twenty English sheep and two rams of the best kind, to improve the breed. For the latter he had to pay rather dear, but they were worth any money to Mr. Campbell, who was quite delighted with the acquisition. In selecting the sheep, of course Henry was obliged to depend on the agent and the parties he employed, as he was no judge himself; but he had, upon his own judgment, purchased two Canadian horses, for Henry had been long enough at Oxford to know the points of a horse, and as they turned out, he had made a very good bargain. He had also bought a sow and pigs of an improved breed, and all the other commissions had been properly executed; the packages of skins also realized the price which had been put on them. As it may be supposed, he was full of news, talking about Montreal, the parties he had been invited to and the people with whom he had become acquainted. He had not forgotten to purchase some of the latest English publications for his cousins, besides a few articles of millinery, which he thought not too gay for their present position. He was still talking, and probably would have gone on talking for hours longer, so many were the questions which he had to reply to, when Martin came in and announced the arrival of the _bateaux_ with the stores and cattle, upon which they all went down to the beach to see them disembarked and brought up by the soldiers, who were at work. The stores were carried up to the door of the storehouse, and the sheep and horses were turned into the prairie with the cows. A week's rations for the soldiers were also brought up from the fort, and the men were very busy in the distribution, and carrying them to the little temporary huts of boughs which they had raised for their accommodation, during the time they worked for Mr. Campbell. Before the evening set in every thing was arranged, and Henry was again surrounded by the family and replying to their remaining interrogatories. He told them that the Governor of Montreal had sent them an invitation to pass the winter at Government-House, and promised the young ladies that no wolf should venture to come near to them, and that the aids-de-camp had requested the honor of their hands at the first ball, which should be given after their arrival, at which they all laughed heartily. In short, it appeared that nothing could equal the kindness and hospitality which had been shown to him, and that there was no doubt, if they chose to go there, that it would be equally extended to the other members of the family.",week return expedition time repeat visit make arrangement party soldier send work fell timber split rail service pay winter house palisade fence sheep put hand great progress make short time many person employ examine stream distance ascertain eligible site water mill select mile shore lake be considerable fall stream run great rapidity expect mill erect follow year necessary have millwright machinery intend estimate expense give contract make order give autumn ready spring next year morning arrive fort stay reach night _bateaux_ stock store leave fort come day impatience see family allow wait suppose receive first recognition proceed acquaint father do obtain canadian farmer ewe fair stock thing equal agent work procure english sheep ram good kind improve breed latter have pay dear worth money delighted acquisition select sheep course oblige depend agent party employ judge own judgment purchase canadian horse long know point horse turn make good bargain buy sow pig improve breed other commission execute package skin realize price put suppose full news talk party invite person become acquainted forget purchase late english publication cousin few article millinery think gay present position talk go talk hour many question have reply come announce arrival _bateaux_ store cattle go beach see disembark bring soldier work store carry door storehouse sheep horse turn prairie cow week ration soldier bring fort man busy distribution carry little temporary hut bough raise accommodation time work evening set thing arrange surround family reply remain interrogatory tell send invitation pass winter promise young lady wolf venture come aid camp request honor hand first ball give arrival laugh short appear equal kindness hospitality show be doubt choose go extend other member family

4,"""Martin wishes me to speak to you, sir,"" said Malachi.",wish speak sir say 
5,"""Martin,"" said Mr. Campbell, looking round for him, and perceiving that he was not in the room; ""why, yes, I perceive he is gone out. What can it be that he can not say for himself?""",say look perceive room perceive go say 
6,"""That's just what I said to him,"" replied Malachi; ""but he thought it were better to come through me; the fact is, sir, that he has taken a liking to the Strawberry, and wishes to make her his wife.""",say reply think good come fact sir take like wish make wife 
7,"""Indeed!""",
8,"""Yes, sir; I don't think that he would have said any thing about it as yet, but you see, there are so many soldiers here, and two or three of them are of Martin's mind, and that makes him feel uncomfortable till the thing is settled; and as he can't well marry while in your service without your leave, he has asked me to speak about it.""",sir think say thing see be many soldier mind make feel uncomfortable thing settle marry service leave ask speak 
9,"""Well, but the Strawberry is your property, not mine. Malachi.""",property 
10,"""Yes, sir, according to Indian fashion, I am her father; but I've no objection, and shan't demand any presents for her.""",sir accord indian fashion father have objection demand present 
11,"""Presents for her! why we in general give presents or money with a wife,"" said Emma.",present general give present money wife say 
12,"""Yes, I know you do, but English wives ain't Indian wives; an English wife requires people to work for her and costs money to keep, but an Indian wife works for herself and her husband, so she is of value and is generally bought of the father; I reckon in the end that it's cheaper to pay for an Indian wife than to receive money with an English one; but that's as may be.""",know english wife indian wife english wife require person work cost money keep indian wife work husband value buy father reckon end cheap pay indian wife receive money english one 
13,"""That's not a very polite speech of yours, Malachi,"" said Mrs. Campbell.",polite speech say 
14,"""Perhaps it ain't, ma'am, but it's near the mark, nevertheless. Now I am willing that Martin should have the Strawberry, because I know that he is a smart hunter, and will keep her well; and somehow or another, I feel that if he made her his wife, I should be more comfortable; I shall live with them here close by, and Martin will serve you, and when he has a wife he will not feel inclined to change service and go into the woods.""",mark willing have know smart hunter keep feel make wife comfortable live serve have wife feel inclined change service go wood 
15,"""I think it is an excellent proposal, Malachi, and am much pleased with it, as we now shall have you all together,"" said Mrs. Campbell.",think excellent proposal pleased have say 
16,"""Yes, ma'am, so you will, and then I'll be always with the boy to look after him, and you'll always know where we are, and not be frightened.""",boy look know frighten 
17,"""Very true, Malachi,"" said Mr. Campbell; ""I consider it a very good arrangement. We must build you a better lodge than the one that you are in.""",true say consider good arrangement build good lodge one 
18,"""No, sir, not a better one, for if you have all you want, you can't want more; it's big enough, but perhaps not quite near enough. I'm thinking that when the sheep-fold is finished, it might be as well to raise our lodge inside of the palisades, and then we shall be a sort of guard to the creatures.""",sir good one have want want more big think sheep fold finish raise lodge palisadd sort guard creature 
19,"""A very excellent idea, Malachi; well then, as far as I am concerned, Martin has my full consent to marry as soon as he pleases.""",excellent idea concerned have full consent marry please 
20,"""And mine, if it is at all necessary,"" observed Mrs. Campbell.",necessary observe 
21,"""But who is to marry them?"" said Emma; ""they have no chaplain at the fort; he went away last year.""",marry say have chaplain fort go last year 
22,"""Why, miss, they don't want no chaplain; she is an Indian girl, and he will marry her Indian-fashion.""",miss want chaplain indian girl marry indian fashion 
23,"""But what fashion is that, Malachi?"" said Mary.",fashion say 
24,"""Why, miss, he'll come to the lodge, and fetch her away to his own house.""",miss come lodge fetch own house 
25,"Alfred burst out into laughter. ""That's making short work of it,"" said he.",burst laughter make short work say 
26,"""Yes, rather too short for my approval,"" said Mrs. Campbell. ""Malachi, it's very true that the Strawberry is an Indian girl, but we are not Indians, and Martin is not an Indian, neither are you who stand as her father; indeed, I can not consent to give my sanction to such a marriage.""",short approval say true indian girl indian stand father consent give sanction marriage 
27,"""Well, ma'am, as you please, but it appears to me to be all right. If you go into a country and wish to marry a girl of that country, you marry her according to the rules of that country. Now, Martin seeks an Indian squaw, and why not therefore marry her after Indian fashion?""",appear right go country wish marry girl country marry accord rule country seek indian squaw marry indian fashion 
28,"""You may be right, Malachi, in your argument,"" said Mrs. Campbell; ""but still you must make allowances for our prejudices. We never should think that she was a married woman, if no further ceremony was to take place than what you propose.""",right argument say make allowance prejudice think married woman further ceremony take place propose 
29,"""Well, ma'am, just as you please; but still, suppose you marry them after your fashion, the girl won't understand a word that is said, so what good will it do?""",suppose marry fashion girl understand word say good do 
30,"""None to her at present, Malachi; but recollect, if she is not a Christian at present, she may be hereafter; I have often thought upon that subject, and although I feel it useless to speak to her just now, yet as soon as she understands English well enough to know what I say to her, I hope to persuade her to become one. Now, if she should become a Christian, as I hope in God she will, she then will perceive that she has not been properly married, and will be anxious to have the ceremony properly performed over again; so why not do it now?""",present recollect present think subject feel useless speak understand know say hope persuade become become hope perceive marry anxious have ceremony perform do 
31,"""Well, ma'am, if it pleases you, I have no objection; I'm sure Martin will have none.""",please have objection sure have 
32,"""It will please me very much, Malachi,"" replied Mrs. Campbell.",please reply 
33,"""And although there is no chaplain at the fort,"" observed Mr. Campbell, ""yet the Colonel can marry in his absence; a marriage by a commanding officer is quite legal.""",be chaplain fort observe marry absence marriage commanding officer legal 
34,"""Yes,"" replied Alfred, ""and so is one by a Captain of a man-of-war.""",reply man war 
35,"""So be it then,"" replied Malachi, ""the sooner the better, for the soldiers are very troublesome, and I can not keep them out of my lodge.""",reply good soldier troublesome keep lodge 
36,"Martin, who had remained outside the door and overheard all that passed, now came in; the subject was again canvassed, and Martin returned his thanks for the permission given to him.",remain door overhear pass come subject canvass return thanks permission give 
37,"""Well,"" said Emma, ""I little thought we should have a wedding in the family so soon; this is quite an event. Martin, I wish you joy--you will have a very pretty and a very good wife.""",say think have wedding family event wish joy have pretty good wife 
38,"""I think so too, miss,"" replied Martin.",think miss reply 
39,"""Where is she?"" said Mary.",say 
40,"""She is in the garden, miss,"" said Malachi, ""getting out of the way of the soldiers; now that the work is done, they torment her not a little, and she is glad to escape from them; I'd tell them to go away, but they don't mind me; they know I must not use my rifle.""",garden miss say get way soldier work do torment little glad escape tell go mind know use rifle 
41,"""I should hope not,"" replied Mrs. Campbell, ""it would be hard to shoot a good man merely because he wished to marry your daughter.""",hope reply hard shoot good man wish marry daughter 
42,"""Why, yes, ma'am, it would,"" replied Malachi, ""so the sooner she is given to Martin the sooner we shall have peace.""",reply give have peace 
43,"As the boat was continually going backward and forward between the fort and the farm, Mr. Campbell wrote to the Colonel, stating what they wished him to do, and the Colonel appointed that day week, on which he would come and perform the ceremony. It was a little fête at the farm. Mrs. Campbell and the Miss Percivals dressed themselves more than usually smart, so did all the males of the establishment; a better dinner than usual was prepared, as the Colonel and some of the officers were to dine and spend the day with them. Martin was very gayly attired, and in high spirits. The Strawberry had on a new robe of young deer skin, and had a flower or two in her long black hair; she looked as she was, very pretty and very modest, but not at all embarrassed. The marriage ceremony was explained to her by Malachi, and she cheerfully consented. Before noon the marriage took place, and an hour or two afterward they sat down to a well-furnished table, and the whole party were very merry, particularly as the Colonel, who was most unusually gay, insisted upon the Strawberry sitting at the table, which she had never done before. She acquitted herself, however, without embarrassment, and smiled when they laughed, although she could understand but little of what they said. Mr. Campbell opened two of his bottles of wine to celebrate the day, and they had a very happy party; the only people who were discontented were three or four of the soldiers outside, who had wanted to marry the Strawberry themselves; but the knowledge that the Colonel was there, effectually put a stop to any thing like annoyance or disturbance on their part. At sunset, the Colonel and officers departed for the fort, the family remained in the house till past ten o'clock, by which time all the soldiers had gone to bed. Mr. Campbell then read prayers, and offered up an additional one for the happiness of the newly-married couple, after which they all saluted the Strawberry and wished her good-night; she was then led to the lodge by Martin, accompanied by Alfred, Henry, Malachi, Percival, and John, who all went home with them as a guard from any interruption on the part of the disappointed suitors.",boat go fort farm write state wish do appoint day week come perform ceremony little fête farm dress more smart do male establishment good dinner usual prepare officer dine spend day gayly attired high spirit have new robe young deer skin have flower long black hair look pretty modest embarrass marriage ceremony explain consent noon marriage take place hour sit furnish table whole party merry gay insist sit table do acquitt embarrassment smile laugh understand little say open bottle wine celebrate day have happy party only person discontent soldier want marry knowledge put stop thing annoyance disturbance part sunset officer depart fort family remain house o'clock time soldier go bed read prayer offer additional one happiness marry couple salute wish good night lead lodge accompany go guard interruption part disappoint suitor
