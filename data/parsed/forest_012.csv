12,"Humphrey gave his knife to Edward, and taking up his gun, set off for the cottage. Edward had skinned two of the bulls before Humphrey's return; and Smoker, although he evidently was in great pain, was on his legs again. As soon as they had finished and quartered the beasts, the cart was loaded and they returned home; they had to return a second time, and both the pony and they were very tired before they sat down to supper They found the gipsy boy very much recovered and in good spirits. Alice said that he had been amusing Edith and her by tossing up three potatoes at a time, and playing them like balls; and that he has spun a platter upon an iron skewer and balanced it on his chin. They gave him some supper, which he ate in the chimney corner, looking up and staring every now and then at Edith, to whom he appeared very much attached already.",give knife take gun set cottage skinned bull return great pain leg finish quarter beast cart load return have return second time pony tired sit supper find gipsy boy recover good spirit say amusing toss potato time play ball spun platter iron skewer balance chin give supper eat chimney corner look stare appear attach

15,"Early on the following morning, Edward and Humphrey set off to Lymington with the cart laden with meat. Edward showed Humphrey all the shops and the streets they were in where the purchases were to be made--introduced him to the landlord of the hostelry--and having sold their meat, they returned home. The rest of the meat was taken to Lymington and disposed of by Humphrey on the following day; and the day after that the three skins were carried to the town and disposed of.",follow morning set cart laden meat show shop street purchase make introduce landlord hostelry sell meat return rest meat take dispose follow day day skin carry town dispose

24,"""Well, I shall have plenty to do when you are away--the potatoes must be hoed up, and I shall see what I can make of Master Pablo. He appears well enough, and he has played quite long enough, so I shall take him with me to the garden to-morrow, and set him to work. What a quantity of fruit there is a promise of in the orchard this year! And Edward, if this boy turns out of any use, and is a help to me, I think that I shall take all the orchard into garden, and then inclose another piece of ground, and see if we can not grow some corn for ourselves.

Now, I'll tell you one thing--I will dig a sawpit and get a saw, and then I can cut out boards and build any thing we want. The first time I go to Lymington I will buy a saw--I can afford it now; and I'll make a carpenter's bench for the first thing, and then, with some more tools, I shall get on; and then, Edward, I'll tell you what else I will do.""",hope get work reply many thing do work tell thing dig sawpit get saw cut board build thing want first time go buy saw afford make carpenter bench first thing more tool get tell do

39,"At sunrise, Edward and Humphrey were both up; Alice came out when they tapped at her door, as she would not let Edward go without his breakfast. Edith joined them, and they went to prayers. While they were so employed, Pablo came out and listened to what was said. When prayers were over, Humphrey asked Pablo if he knew what they had been doing.",sunrise come tap door let go breakfast join go prayer employ come listen say prayer ask know do

45,"Edward threw his gun over his arm, and calling his puppy, which he had named Holdfast, bade Humphrey and his sisters farewell, and set off on his journey across the forest.",throw gun arm call puppy name bid sister farewell set journey forest 
46,"Holdfast, as well as Humphrey's puppy, which had been named Watch, had grown very fine young animals. The first had been named Holdfast, because it would seize the pigs by the ears and lead them into the sty, and the other because it was so alert at the least noise; but, as Humphrey said, Watch ought to have learned to lead the pigs, it being more in his line of business than Holdfast's, which was to be brought up for hunting in the forest, while Watch was being educated as a house and farmyard dog.",puppy name grow fine young animal first name seize pig ear lead sty other alert least noise say watch learn lead pig more line business bring hunting forest educate house farmyard dog 
47,"Edward had refused to take the pony, as Humphrey required it for the farm-work, and the weather was so fine that he preferred walking; the more so, as it would enable him on his return across the forest to try for some venison, which he could not have done if he had been mounted on Billy's back. Edward walked quick, followed by his dog, which he had taught to keep to heel. He felt happy, as people do who have no cares, from the fine weather--the deep green of the verdure checkered by the flowers in bloom, and the majestic scenery which met his eye on every side. His heart was as buoyant as his steps, as he walked along, the light summer breeze fanning his face. His thoughts, however, which had been more of the chase than any thing else, suddenly changed, and he became serious. For some time he had heard no political news of consequence, or what the Commons were doing with the king. This revery naturally brought to his mind his father's death, the burning of his property, and its sequestration. His cheeks colored with indignation, and his brow was moody. Then he built castles for the future. He imagined the king released from his prison, and leading an army against his oppressors; he fancied himself at the head of a troop of cavalry, charging the Parliamentary horse. Victory was on his side. The king was again on his throne, and he was again in possession of the family estate. He was rebuilding the hall, and somehow or another it appeared to him that Patience was standing by his side, as he gave directions to the artificers, when his revery was suddenly disturbed by Holdfast barking and springing forward in advance.",refuse take pony require farm work weather fine prefer walking enable return forest try venison do mount back walk follow dog teach keep heel feel happy person have care fine weather deep green verdure checker flower bloom majestic scenery meet eye side heart buoyant step walk light summer breeze fann face thought more chase thing else change become serious time hear political news consequence do king revery bring mind father death burning property sequestration cheek color indignation brow moody build castle future imagine king release prison lead army oppressor fancy head troop cavalry charge parliamentary horse side king throne possession family estate rebuild hall appear stand side give direction artificer revery disturb barking spring advance 
48,"Edward, who had by this time got over more than half his journey, looked up, and perceived himself confronted by a powerful man, apparently about forty years of age, and dressed as a verderer of the forest. He thought at the time that he had seldom seen a person with a more sinister and forbidding countenance.",have time get more journey look perceive confront powerful man year age dress verderer forest think time see person sinister forbid countenance 
49,"""How now, young fellow, what are you doing here?"" said the man, walking up to him and cocking the gun which he held in hand as he advanced.",young fellow do say man walk cock gun hold hand advance

Sheer off, or you may meet with harm.""",deer stealer reply sufficient give title find venison possession go sheer meet harm 
53,"""Why, you young good-for-nothing, if you have not venison, it is not from any will not to take it; you are out in pursuit of it, that is clear.

54,"""If you can,"" replied Edward; ""but you must first prove that you are able so to do; my gun is as good and my aim is as sure as yours, whoever you may be. I tell you again, I am no poacher, nor have I come out to take the deer, but to cross over to the intendant's cottage, whither I am now going. I tell you thus much, that you may not do any thing foolish; and having said this, I advise you to think twice before you act once.

55,"There was something so cool and so determined in Edward's quiet manner, that the verderer hesitated. He perceived that any attempt to take Edward would be at the risk of his own life; and he knew that his orders were to apprehend all poachers, but not to shoot people. It was true, that resistance with firearms would warrant his acting in self-defense; but admitting that he should succeed, which was doubtful, still Edward had not been caught in the act of killing venison, and he had no witnesses to prove what had occurred. He also knew that the intendant had given very strict orders as to the shedding of blood, which he was most averse to, under any circumstances; and there was something in Edward's appearance and manner so different from a common person, that he was puzzled. Moreover, Edward had stated that he was going to the intendant's house. All things considered, as he found that bullying would not succeed, he thought it advisable to change his tone, and therefore said, ""You tell me that you are going to the intendant's house; you have business there, I presume? If I took you prisoner, it is there I should have conducted you, so, young man, you may now walk on before me.""",be cool determine quiet manner verderer hesitate perceive attempt take risk own life know order apprehend poacher shoot person true resistance firearm warrant acting self defense admit succeed doubtful catch act kill venison have witness prove occur know intendant give strict order shedding blood averse circumstance be appearance manner different common person puzzle state go intendant house thing consider find bullying succeed think advisable change tone say tell go intendant house have business presume take prisoner conduct young man walk

65,"This reply puzzled the man still more; and he now, from the tone of authority assumed by Edward, began to imagine that he had made some mistake, and that he was speaking to a superior, although clad in a forester's dress. He therefore answered humbly, observing that he had only been doing his duty.",reply puzzle man tone authority assume begin imagine make mistake speak superior clad forester dress answer observe do duty
