2," In the chaste retirement of his sick room the Field-Marshal had just reached this conclusion, when he heard a noise in the hall. There was a sound of the gruff unmirthful voices of grown-ups, a scuffling of feet, a planting of whips and walking-sticks on the zinc-bottomed hall-stand, and then, after a pause which meant drinks, heavy footsteps in the passage which led to the hero's chamber.",chaste retirement sick room reach conclusion hear noise hall be sound gruff unmirthful voice grow up scuffling foot planting whip walking stick zinc bottom hall stand pause mean drink heavy footstep passage lead hero chamber 
3,"Hugh John snatched up Sambo Soulis and thrust him deep beneath the bedclothes, where he could readily push him over the end with his toes, if it should chance to be ""the doctor-beast"" come to uncover him and ""fool with the bandages.""

10,"The other man who had come in with Mr. Smith was a thick-set fellow of middle height, with a curious air of being dressed up in somebody else's clothes. Yet they fitted him very well. He wore on his face (in addition to a slight moustache) an expression which somehow made Hugh John think guiltily of all the orchards he had ever visited along with Toady Lion and Sammy Carter's sister Cissy, who was ""no end of a nice girl"" in Hugh John's estimation.",other man come thick set fellow middle height curious air dress else clothes fit wear face addition slight moustache expression make think orchard visit sister end nice girl estimation

22,"Presently the other two children were pushed in at the door, Toady Lion trying a bolt at the last moment, which Janet Sheepshanks easily foiled by catching at the slack of his trousers behind, while Prissy stood holding her hands primly as if in Sunday-school class. Both afforded to the critical eye of Hugh John complete evidence that they had only just escaped from the Greater Pain of the comb and soaped flannel-cloth of Janet Sheepshanks. Prissy's curls were still wet and smoothed out, and Toady Lion was trying in vain to rub the yellow soap out of his eyes.",other child push door try bolt last moment foil catching slack trousers stand hold hand school class afford critical eye complete evidence escape great comb soap flannel cloth prissy curl wet smooth try vain rub yellow soap eye 
23,"So at the headquarters of its general, the army of Windy Standard formed up. Sir Toady Lion wished to get within supporting distance of Prissy, and accordingly kept snuggling nearer all the time, so that he could get a furtive hold of her skirts at awkward places in the examination. This he could do the more easily that General Field-Marshal Smith was prevented by the bandages over his right eye, and also by the projecting edges of the pillow, from seeing Toady Lion's left hand.",headquarters general army windy form wish get support distance keep snuggle time get furtive hold skirt awkward place examination do prevent bandage right eye project edge pillow see left hand

25,"""Wasn't no lamb--Donald was a sheep, and he could fight,"" began Toady Lion, without relevance, but with his usual eagerness to hear the sound of his own piping voice.
