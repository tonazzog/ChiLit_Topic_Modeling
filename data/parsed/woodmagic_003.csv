1,CHAPTER III. ADVENTURES OF THE WEASEL.,adventure weasel 
2," After awhile the mowers came and began to cut the long grass in the Home Field, and the meadow by the brook. Bevis could see them from the garden, and it was impossible to prevent him from straying up the footpath, so eager was he to go nearer. The best thing that could be done, since he could not be altogether stopped, was to make him promise that he would not go beyond a certain limit. He might wander as much as he pleased inside the hedge and the Home Field, in which there was no pond, nor any place where he could very well come to harm. But he must not creep through the hedge, so that he would always be in sight from the garden. If he wished to enter the meadow by the brook he must ask special permission, that some one might be put to watch now and then.",mower come begin cut long grass meadow brook see garden impossible prevent stray footpath eager go good thing do stop make promise go certain limit wander pleased hedge be pond place come harm creep hedge sight garden wish enter meadow brook ask special permission one put watch 
3,"But more expressly he was forbidden to enter the Little Field. The grass there was not yet to be mown--it was too long to walk in--and they were afraid lest he should get through the hedge, or climb over the high padlocked gate in some way or other, for the Long Pond was on the other side, though it could not be seen for trees. Nor was he to approach nearer to the mowers than one swathe; he was always to keep one swathe between him and the scythes, which are extremely sharp and dangerous instruments.",forbidden enter little grass mown long walk afraid get hedge climb high padlock gate way other long other side see tree approach nearer mower swathe keep swathe scythe sharp dangerous instrument 
4,"Sir Bevis repeated these promises so seriously, and with so demure and innocent an expression, that no one could doubt but that he would keep them strictly, nor, indeed, did any idea of exceeding these limits occur to him. He was so overjoyed at the vast extent of territory, almost a new world thrown open for exploration, that he did not think it possible he could ever want to go any farther. He rushed into the Home Field, jumping over the swathes till he was tired, and kicking the grass about with his feet. Then he wanted a prong, and a stout stick with a fork was cut and pointed for him, and with this he went eagerly to work for five minutes. Next he wanted some one to bury under the grass, and could not be satisfied till the dairy-maid was sent out and submitted to be completely hidden under a heap of it.",repeat promise demure innocent expression doubt keep do idea exceed limit occur overjoyed vast extent territory new world throw open exploration think possible want go rush jump swathe tired kick grass foot want prong stout stick fork cut point go work minute want one bury grass satisfy dairy maid send submit hide heap 
5,"Next he walked all round the field, and back home down the middle. By-and-by he sat down and looked at the mowers, who were just finishing the last corner before they went into the meadow by the brook. While he was sitting there a number of greenfinches, and sparrows, and two or three hasty starlings (for they are always in a hurry), came to the sward where the mowers had just passed, and searched about for food. They seemed so happy and looked so pretty, Bevis thought he should like to shoot one, so away he ran home to the summer-house for his bow and arrow. Hastening back with these, he built a heap of the grass to hide behind, like a breastwork, and then sat down and watched for the birds.",walk field middle sit look mower finish last corner go meadow brook sit number greenfinche sparrow hasty starling hurry come sward mower pass search food seem happy look pretty think like shoot run summer house bow arrow hasten build heap grass hide breastwork sit watch bird 
6,"They did not come directly, as they ought to have done, so he kicked up his heels, and rolled over on his back, and looked up at the sky, as was his wont. Every now and then he could hear Pan whining woefully in his tub a long way off. Since the whipping the spaniel had been in disgrace, and no one would let him loose. Bevis, so delighted with his field to roam about in, quite forgot him, and left him to sorrow in his tub. Presently he heard a lark singing so sweetly, though at a great distance, that he kept quite still to listen. The song came in verses, now it rose a little louder, and now it fell till he could hardly hear it, and again returned. Bevis got up on his knees to try and find where the lark was, but the sky was so blue there or the bird so high up, he could not see it, though he searched and searched. It was somewhere in the next field, far beyond the great oak where he once fell asleep.",come do kick heel roll back look sky hear pan whine tub long way whipping spaniel disgrace let lose delight field roam forget leave sorrow tub hear lark sing great distance keep listen song come verse rise little louder fall hear return get knee try find lark sky blue bird high see search search next field great oak fall asleep 
7,"He then peered round his heap of grass, but there were no greenfinches near; they had come out from the hedges, and the starling had come from the hollow pollard where he had a nest, but all had settled a long way off from his hiding-place. Bevis was very angry, so he stood up, and pulled his bow with all his might, and let the arrow fly into the air almost straight up. When it had risen so far, it turned over and came down among the flock of birds and stuck in the ground.",peer heap grass be greenfinche come hedge starling come hollow pollard have nest settle long way hiding place angry stand pull bow let arrow fly air rise turn come flock bird stuck ground 
8,"They flew away in terror, and though he had not killed any, Bevis was highly delighted at the fright they were in. He picked up his arrow, and tried another long shot at a rook on the other side of the field, but he could not send it so great a distance. As he ran for it, he saw that the rook's back was towards him, and, thinking that the rook could not see him, he raced on quietly to try and catch him, but just as he got close, up rose the rook over the hedge with a ""Caw, caw!"" Whizz! went Bevis's arrow after him, and fell on the other side of the hedge, where he was not to go.",fly terror kill delight fright pick arrow try long shot rook other side field send great distance run see rook back think rook see race try catch get close rise rook hedge caw caw whizz go arrow fall other side hedge go 
9,"In his anger at the rook's behaviour Bevis forgot all about his promise; he jumped into the ditch regardless of the stinging-nettles, pushed his way up through the briars, tearing his sleeve, forced his way across the mound, and went on his hands and knees through the young green fern on the other side (just as Pan would have done) under the thick thorn bushes, and so out into the next field. It was the very field where he and Pan had wandered before, only another part of it. There was his arrow ever so far off, sticking upright in the grass among the cowslips. As he went to pick up his arrow he saw another flower growing a little farther on, and went to gather that first; it was an orchid, and when he stood up with it in his hand he heard a mouse rustle in the grass, and stepped quietly to try and see it, but the mouse hid in a hole.",anger rook behaviour forget promise jump ditch sting nettle push way briar tear sleeve force way mound go hand knee young green fern other side pan do thick thorn bush next field very field wander part be arrow stick grass cowslip go pick arrow see flower grow little go gather first orchid stand hand hear mouse rustle grass step try see mouse hide hole 
10,"Then there was an enormous humble-bee, so huge that when it stayed to suck a cowslip, the cowslip was bent down with its weight. Bevis walked after the giant humble-bee, and watched it take the honey from several cowslips; then he saw a stone standing in the field, it was not upright, but leaned to one side--yet it was almost as tall as he was. He went to the stone and looked all round it, and got up on it and sat still a minute, and while he was there a cuckoo came by, so close, that he jumped off to run after it. But the cuckoo flew fast, and began to call ""Cuckoo!"" and it was no use to chase him.",be enormous humble bee huge stay suck cowslip cowslip bend weight walk giant humble bee watch take honey several cowslip see stone stand field upright learn side tall go stone look get sit minute cuckoo come close jump run cuckoo fly begin call use chase 
11,"When Bevis stopped and looked about he was in a hollow, like a big salad bowl, only all grass, and he could see nothing but the grass and cowslips all round him--no hedges--and the sky overhead. He began to dance and sing with delight at such a curious place, and when he paused the lark was on again, and not very far this time. There he was, rising gradually, singing as he went. Bevis ran up the side of the hollow towards the lark, and saw a hedge cut and cropped low, and over it a wheat-field. He watched the lark sing, sing, sing, up into the sky, and then he thought he would go and find his nest, as he remembered the ploughboy had told him larks made their nests on the ground among the corn.",stop look hollow big salad bowl grass see grass cowslip hedge sky begin dance sing delight curious place pause lark time rise sing go run side hollow lark see hedge cut croppe low wheat field watch lark sing sing sing sky think go find nest remember ploughboy tell lark make nest ground corn 
12,"He ran to the low hedge, but though it was low it was very thorny, and while he was trying to find a place to get through, he looked over and spied a hare crouched in the rough grass, just under the hedge between it and the wheat. The hare was lying on the ground; she did not move, though she saw Bevis, and when he looked closer he saw that her big eyes were full of tears. She was crying very bitterly, all by herself, while the sun was shining so brightly, and the wind blowing so sweetly, and the flowers smelling so pleasantly, and the lark sing, sing, singing overhead.",run low hedge low thorny try find place get look spy hare crouch rough grass hedge wheat hare lie ground move see look close see big eye full tear cry sun shine wind blow flower smell lark sing sing sing 
13,"""Oh! dear,"" said Bevis, so eager and so sorry, that he pushed against the hedge, and did not notice that a thorn was pricking his arm: ""Whatever is the matter?"" But the hare was so miserable she would not answer him at first, till he coaxed her nicely. Then she said: ""Bevis, Bevis, little Sir Bevis, do you know what you have done?""",dear say eager sorry push hedge notice thorn prick arm matter hare miserable answer first coax say little know do 
14,"""No,"" said Bevis, ""I can't think: was it me?""",say think 
15,"""Yes, it was you; you let the weasel loose, when he was caught in the gin.""",let weasel lose catch gin 
16,"""Did I?"" said Bevis, ""I have quite forgotten it.""",say forget 
17,"""But you did it,"" said the hare, ""and now the weasel has killed my son, the leveret, while he was sleeping, and sucked his blood, and I am so miserable; I do not care to run away any more."" Then the hare began to weep bitterly again, till Bevis did not know what to do to comfort her.",do say hare weasel kill son leveret sleep suck blood miserable care run more hare begin weep know do comfort 
18,"""Perhaps the weasel only killed the leveret for your good,"" he said presently.",weasel kill leveret good say 
19,"""What!"" cried the hare, putting her fore-feet down hard, and stamping with indignation. ""That is what the wicked old wretch told you, did he not, about the mouse and the partridge's eggs. Cannot you see that it is all a pack of lies? But I do not wonder that he deceives you, dear, since he has deceived the world for so long. Let me tell you, Sir Bevis, the weasel is the wickedest and most dreadful creature that lives, and above all things he is so cunning he can make people believe anything he chooses, and he has succeeded in making fools of us all--every one.",cry hare put fore foot stamp indignation wicked old wretch tell mouse partridge egg see pack lie wonder deceive dear deceive world let tell weasel wickedest dreadful creature live thing cunning make person believe choose succeed make fool one 
20,"""There is not one of all the animals in the hedge, nor one of the birds in the trees, that he has not cheated. He is so very, very cunning, and his talk is so soft and smooth. Do you please take care, Sir Bevis, or perhaps he may deceive you, as he deceived the fox. Why, do you know, he has made the people believe that his crimes are committed by the fox, who consequently bears all the disgrace; and not only that, but he has spread it abroad that the fox is the most cunning of all, in order that he may not be suspected of being so clever as he is. I daresay the weasel will have me some day, and I do not care if he does, now my leveret is dead; and very soon his poor bones will be picked clean by the ants, and after the corn is carried the plough will bury them.""",be animal hedge bird tree cheat cunning talk soft smooth take care deceive deceive fox know make person believe crime commit fox bear disgrace spread fox cunning order suspect clever daresay weasel have day care leveret dead poor bone pick clean ant corn carry plough bury 
21,"Bevis was terribly distressed at the hare's story, and showed such indignation against the weasel, and stamped his little foot so hard, knitting his brow, that the hare was somewhat appeased, and began to explain all about it.",distressed hare story show such indignation weasel stamp little foot knitting brow hare appease begin explain 
22,"""Of course you did not know, dear,"" she said, ""when you stepped on the spring of the gin, what trouble we had had to get him into the trap. For we had all suffered so long from his cruelty, that we had all agreed at last to try and put an end to it. The trees could not bear to stand still and see it go on under them, yet they could not move. The earth could not bear to feel him running about on his bloodthirsty business, through the holes the rabbits had made. The grass hated to feel him pushing through, for it had so often been stained with the blood that he had shed. So we all took counsel together, and I carried the messages, dear, from the oak, where you slept, to the ash and the elm, and to the earth in the corner where the rabbits live; and the birds came up into the oak and gave their adherence, every one; and the fox, too, though he did not come himself, for he is too cunning to commit himself till he knows which way the wind is going to blow, sent word of his high approval.",course know dear say step spring gin trouble have get trap suffer cruelty agree last try put end tree bear stand see go move earth bear feel run bloodthirsty business hole rabbit make grass hate feel push stain blood shed take counsel carry message dear oak sleep ash elm earth corner rabbit live bird come oak give adherence one fox come cunning commit know way wind go blow send word high approval 
23,"""Thus we were all prepared to act against that midnight assassin, the weasel, but we could not begin. The trees could not move, the earth could not wag a step, the grass could do nothing, and so it went on for some months, during all which time the weasel was busy with his wickedness, till at last the bailiff set the gin for the rat by the cart-house. Then the fox came out by day--contrary to his custom, for he likes a nap--and went to a spot where he knew a rabbit sat in the grass; and he hunted the poor rabbit (it was very good sport to see--I do not like rabbits), till he had driven him across the ditch, where the weasel was. Then the fox stopped, and hid himself in the furze; and the weasel, first looking round to see that no one was near, stole after the rabbit. Now the rabbit knew that the fox was about, and therefore he was afraid to run across the open field; all he could do was to go down the hedge towards the garden.",prepare act midnight assassin weasel begin tree move earth be step grass do go month time weasel busy wickedness last bailiff set gin rat cart house fox come day contrary custom like nap go spot know rabbit sit grass hunt poor rabbit good sport see like rabbit drive ditch weasel fox stop hide furze weasel look see steal rabbit rabbit know fox afraid run open field do go hedge garden 
24,"""Everything was going on well, and we sent word to the rat, to warn him against the gin--we did not like the rat, but we did not want the gin thrown--don't you see, dear? But when the rabbit had gone half-way down the hedge, and was close to the garden, he became afraid to venture any nearer your house, Bevis. Still the weasel crept after him, and presently drove him almost up to your sycamore-tree. Then the rabbit did not know what to do; for if he went forward the people in the house might see him and bring out the gun, and if he turned back the weasel would have him, and if he ran out into the field the fox would be there, and he could not climb up a tree. He stopped still, trying to think, till the weasel came so near he could smell the rabbit's blood, and then, in his terror, the rabbit darted out from the hedge, and into the ditch of your haha wall, under where the bee-hives are. There he saw a dry drain, and hopped into it, forgetting in his fright that he might not be able to get out at the other end.",go send word rat warn gin like rat want gin throw see dear rabbit go half way hedge close garden become afraid venture house weasel creep drive sycamore tree rabbit know do go person house see bring gun turn weasel have run field fox climb tree stop try think weasel come smell rabbit blood terror rabbit dart hedge ditch haha wall bee hive see dry drain hopp forget fright able get other end 
25,"""The weasel thought he had now got him safe, and was just going to rush across and follow, when an ant spoke to him from the trunk of a tree it was climbing. The ant said the fox had asked him yesterday to watch, and if the weasel came that way, to warn him that there was a plot laid for his life, and not to be too venturesome. This was a piece of the same double-faced ways the fox has been notorious for these many years past. No one hates the weasel so much as the fox, but he said to himself: 'The weasel is so cunning, that even if he is caught, he is sure to find some way to get free, and then he will perhaps discover that I had a hand in it, and will turn round on me and spoil some of my schemes out of spite. Besides which, I don't see why I should take much interest in the hare or the mouse.' So, though he hunted the rabbit for us, yet he sent the weasel this message, to take care and mind and not be too bold.",weasel think get safe go rush follow ant speak trunk tree climb ant say fox ask yesterday watch weasel come way warn be plot lay life venturesome piece same double face way fox notorious many year past hate weasel much fox say weasel cunning catch sure find way get free discover have hand turn spoil scheme spite see take much interest hare mouse hunt rabbit send weasel message take care mind bold 
26,"""When the weasel heard this he stopped, and thought to himself that it was rather dangerous to go so near a house, almost under it; and yet he could not help licking his mouth, as he remembered the sweet scent of the rabbit's blood. But he was so very, very cunning, that he thought to himself the rabbit would be obliged to come out again presently, and would be sure to come up the hedge if he did not see the weasel. So the weasel turned round to go up the hedge, and we were all in anxiety lest the scheme should miscarry. But as the weasel was going under the elm, the elm dropped a large dead branch, and as it came crashing down, it fell so near the weasel as to pinch his foot, and, hearing another branch go crack, he lost his presence of mind, turned back again, and darted across the corner into the drain. There the scent of the rabbit was so strong he could not help but follow it, and in a moment or two he saw the poor creature crouched at the end where he could not pass.",weasel hear stop think dangerous go house help lick mouth remember sweet scent rabbit blood cunning think rabbit oblige come sure come hedge see weasel weasel turn go hedge anxiety scheme miscarry weasel go elm elm drop large dead branch come crash fall weasel pinch foot hear branch go crack lose presence mind turn dart corner drain scent rabbit strong help follow moment see poor creature crouch end pass 
27,"""The weasel bounded forward, when the earth squeezed out a stone, and the stone fell between the weasel and the rabbit. Before he could tell what to do, the earth squeezed out another stone behind him and he was caught, and could neither go forward or backward. Now we thought we had got him, and that he must starve to death. As for the rabbit, when the stone fell down it left a hole above, up which he scrambled into the cow-yard, and there hid himself behind a bunch of nettles till night, when he escaped into the field.",weasel bound earth squeeze stone stone fall weasel rabbit tell do earth squeeze stone catch go think get starve death rabbit stone fall leave hole scramble cow yard hide bunch nettle night escape field 
28,"""Meantime the weasel in a dreadful fright was walking to and fro in his narrow prison, gnashing his teeth with rage and terror, and calling to all the animals and birds and insects and even to the mole (whom he despised most of all) to help him out. He promised to be the nicest, kindest weasel that ever was known; but it was no use, for they were all in the secret, and overjoyed to see him on the point of perishing. There he had to stay, and though he scratched and scratched, he could not make any hole through the solid stone, and by-and-by he got weaker, and he began to die. While he was dying the rat came and peeped down at him through a chink, and laughed and said: 'What is the use of all your cunning, you coward? If you had been bold like me you would never have got into this scrape, by being afraid of a dead branch of a tree because it pinched your foot. I should have run by quickly. You are a silly, foolish, blind sort of creature; could you not see that all the things had agreed to deceive you?'",weasel dreadful fright walk narrow prison gnash tooth rage terror call animal bird insect mole despise most help promise nice kindest weasel know use secret overjoy see point perish have stay scratch scratch make hole solid stone get weak begin die die rat come peep chink laugh say use cunning coward bold get scrape afraid dead branch tree pinch foot run silly foolish blind sort creature see thing agree deceive 
29,"""At this the weasel was so wroth it woke him up from his dying, and he returned the taunt and said: 'Rat, you are by far the silliest to help the hare and the mouse; it is true they sent you a message about the gin, but that was not for love of you, I am sure, and I can't think why they should send it; but you may depend it is some trick, and very likely the gin is not where they said at all, but in another place, and you will walk into it when you are not thinking, and then you will curse the hare and the mouse'.",weasel wroth wake die return taunt say silliest help hare mouse true send message gin love sure think send depend trick likely gin say place walk think curse hare mouse 
30,"""'Ah,' said the rat, 'that sounds like reason; you are right, the hare and the mouse are going to play me a trick. But I will spite them, I will let you out.'",say rat sound reason right hare mouse go play trick spite let 
31,"""'Will you?' said the weasel, starting up and feeling almost strong again. 'But you can't, these stones are so thick you cannot move them, nor scratch through them, nor raise them; no, you cannot let me out.'",say weasel start feel strong stone thick move scratch raise let 
32,"""'Oh, yes, I can,' said the rat, 'I know a way to move the biggest stones, and if you can only wait a day or two I will make this chink large enough for you to come up.'",say rat know way move big stone wait day make chink large come 
33,"""'A day or two,' said the weasel in despair; 'why, I am nearly dead now with hunger.'",day say weasel despair dead hunger 
34,"""'Well then,' said the rat, 'gnaw your own tail;' and off he went laughing at the joke. The miserable weasel cried and sniffed, and sniffed and cried, till by-and-by he heard the rat come back and begin to scratch outside. Presently the rat stopped, and was going away again, when the weasel begged and prayed him not to leave him to die there in the dark.",say rat gnaw own tail go laugh joke miserable weasel cry sniff sniff cry hear rat come begin scratch rat stop go weasel begg pray leave die dark 
35,"""'Very well,' said the rat, 'I will send the cricket to sing to you. In a day or two you will see the chink get bigger, and meantime you can eat your tail; and as you will get very thin, you will be able to creep through a very small hole and get out all the quicker. Ha! ha! As for me, I am going to have a capital dinner from Pan's dish, for he has fallen asleep in his tub.'",say rat send cricket sing day see chink get big eat tail get thin able creep small hole get quick go have capital dinner dish fall asleep tub 
36,"""So the weasel was left to himself, and though he watched and watched, he could not see the chink open in the least, and he got so dreadfully hungry that at last, after sucking his paws, he was obliged to bring his tail round and begin to gnaw it a little bit. The pain was dreadful, but he could not help himself, he was obliged to do it or die. In the evening the cricket came, as the rat had promised, to the top of the chink, and at once began to sing. He sang all about the lady cricket with whom he was in love, and then about the beautiful stars that were shining in the sky, and how nice it was to be a cricket, for the crickets were by far the most handsome and clever of all creatures, and everybody would like to be a cricket if they could.",weasel leave watch watch see chink open least get hungry last suck paw oblige bring tail begin gnaw little bit pain dreadful help oblige do die evening cricket come rat promise top chink begin sing sing lady cricket love beautiful star shine sky nice cricket cricket handsome clever creature like cricket 
37,"""Next, he went on to praise himself, that his lady might hear what fine limbs he had, and so noble a form, and such a splendid chink to live in. Thus he kept on the livelong night, and all about himself; and his chirp, chirp, chirp filled the weasel's prison with such a noise that the wretched thing could not sleep. He kept asking the cricket to tell him if the rat had really done anything to enlarge the chink; but the cricket was too busy to answer him till the dawn, and then, having finished his song, he found time to attend to the weasel.",go praise lady hear fine limb have noble form splendid chink live keep livelong night chirp chirp chirp fill weasel prison noise wretched thing sleep keep ask cricket tell rat do enlarge chink cricket busy answer dawn finish song find time attend weasel 
38,"""'You have been very rude,' he said, 'to keep on talking while I was singing, but I suppose, as you are only an ignorant weasel, you do not understand good manners, and therefore I will condescend so far as to inform you of the measures taken by my noble friend the rat to get you out. If you were not so extremely ignorant and stupid you would guess what he has done.'",rude say keep talk sing suppose ignorant weasel understand good manners condescend inform measure take noble friend rat get ignorant stupid guess do 
39,"""Now all this was very bitter to the weasel, who had always thought he knew everything, to be insulted by a cricket; still he begged to be told what it was. 'The rat,' went on the cricket, 'has brought a little piece from a fungus, and has scratched a hole beside the stone and put it in there. Now, when this begins to grow and the fungus pushes up, it will move the stone and open a chink. In this way I have seen my lord the rat heave up the heaviest paving stones and make a road for himself. Now are you not stupid?' Then the cricket went home to bed.",bitter weasel think know insult cricket begg tell rat go cricket bring little piece fungus scratch hole stone put begin grow fungus push move stone open chink way see lord rat heave heavy pave stone make road stupid cricket go bed 
40,"""All day long the miserable weasel lay on the floor of his prison, driven every now and then to gnaw his tail till he squeaked with the pain. The only thing that kept him from despair was the hope of the revenge he would have, if ever he did get out, on those who had laid the trap for him. For hours he lay insensible, and only woke up when the rat looked down the chink and asked him, with a jolly chuckle, how his tail tasted, and then went off without waiting for an answer. Then the cricket came again, and taking not the least notice of the prisoner, sang all night.",day miserable weasel lay floor prison drive gnaw tail squeak pain only thing keep despair hope revenge get lay trap hour lay insensible wake rat look chink ask jolly chuckle tail taste go wait answer cricket come take least notice prisoner sing night 
41,"""In the morning the weasel looked up, and saw that the chink had really opened. He crawled to it, he was so faint he could not walk, so he had to crawl over the floor, which was all red with his own blood. The fungus, a thick, yellowish-green thing, like a very large and unwholesome mushroom, was growing fast, so fast he could see it move, and very slowly it shoved and lifted up the stone. The chink was now so far open that in his thin, emaciated state, the weasel could have got through; but he was so weak he could not climb up. He called to the rat, and the rat came and tried to reach him, but it was just a little too far down.",morning weasel look see chink open crawl faint walk have crawl floor red own blood fungus thick yellowish green thing large unwholesome mushroom grow see move shove lift stone chink open thin emaciated state weasel get weak climb call rat rat come try reach little 
42,"""'If I only had something to drink,' said the weasel, 'only one drop of water, I think I could do it, but I am faint from thirst.'",have drink say weasel drop water think do faint thirst 
43,"""Off ran the rat to see what he could do, and as he passed the tub where Pan lived he saw a bowl of water just pumped for the spaniel. The bowl was of wood with a projecting handle--not a ring to put the fingers through, but merely a short straight handle. He went round to the other side of the tub in which Pan was dozing and began to scratch. Directly Pan heard the scratching:--",run rat see do pass tub pan live see bowl water pump spaniel bowl wood project handle ring put finger short straight handle go other side tub pan doze begin scratch pan hear scratching 
44,"""'Ho! ho!' said he, 'that's that abominable rat that steals my food,' and he darted out, and in his tremendous hurry his chain caught the handle of the bowl, just as the rat had hoped it would. Over went the bowl, and all the water was spilt, but the rat, the instant he heard Pan coming, had slipped away back to the weasel.",say abominable rat steal food dart tremendous hurry chain catch handle bowl rat hope go bowl water spilt rat instant hear pan come slip weasel 
45,"""When Pan was tired of looking where he had heard the scratching, he went back to take a lap, but found the bowl upset, and that all the water had run down the drain. As he was very thirsty after gnawing a salt bacon-bone, he set up a barking, and the dairy-maid ran out, thinking it was a beggar, and began to abuse him for being so clumsy as to knock over his bowl. Pan barked all the louder, so she hit him with the handle of her broom, and he went howling into his tub. He vowed vengeance against the rat, but that did not satisfy his thirst.",pan tired look hear scratching go take lap find bowl upset water run drain thirsty gnaw salt bacon bone set barking dairy maid run think beggar begin abuse clumsy knock bowl pan bark louder hit handle broom go howl tub vow vengeance rat satisfy thirst 
46,"""Meantime the water had run along the drain, and though the fungus greedily sucked up most of it, the weasel had a good drink. After that he felt better, and he climbed up the chink, squeezing through and dragging his raw tail behind him, till he nearly reached the top. But there it was still a little tight, and he could not manage to push through, not having strength enough left. He felt himself slipping back again, and called on the rat to save him. The rat without ceremony leant down the chink, and caught hold of his ear with his teeth, and snipped it so tight he bit it right through, but he dragged the weasel out.",water run drain fungus suck most weasel have good drink feel good climb chink squeez drag raw tail reach top be little tight manage push have strength leave feel slip call rat save rat ceremony lean chink catch hold ear tooth snipp tight bite drag weasel 
47,"""There he lay a long time half dead and exhausted, under a dock leaf which hid him from view. The rat began to think that the weasel would die after all, so he came and said: 'Wake up, coward, and come with me into the cart-house; there is a very nice warm hole there, and I will tell you something; if you stay here very likely the bailiff may see you, and if Pan should be let loose he will sniff you out in a second'. So the weasel, with very great difficulty, dragged himself into the cart-house, and found shelter in the hole.",lay long time half dead exhaust dock leaf hide view rat begin think weasel die come say wake come cart house be nice warm hole tell stay likely bailiff see pan let loose sniff second weasel great difficulty drag cart house find shelter hole 
48,"""Now the rat, though he had helped the weasel, did not half like him, for he was afraid to go to sleep while the weasel was about, lest his guest should fasten on his throat, for he knew he was treacherous to the last degree. He cast about in his mind how to get rid of him, and at the same time to serve his own purpose. By-and-by he said that there was a mouse in the cart-house who had a very plump wife, and two fat little mouses. At this the weasel pricked up his ears, for he was so terribly hungry, and sat up and asked where they were. The rat said the wife and the children were up in the beam; the wood had rotted, and they had a hole there, but he was afraid the mouse himself was away from home just then, most likely in the corn-bin, where the barley-meal for the pigs was kept.",rat help weasel half afraid go sleep weasel guest fast throat know treacherous last degree cast mind get rid same time serve own purpose say be mouse cart house have plump wife fat little mouse weasel prick ear hungry sit ask rat say wife child beam wood rott have hole afraid mouse home likely corn bin barley meal pig keep 
49,"""'Never mind,' said the weasel, eagerly, 'the wife and the baby mice will do very well,' and up he started and climbed up through the rat's hole in the wall to the roof, and then into the hole in the beam, where he had a good meal on the mice. Now the rat hated this mouse because he lived so near, and helped himself to so much food, and being so much smaller, he could get about inside the house where you live, Bevis, without being seen, and so got very fat, and made the rat jealous. He thought, too, that when the weasel had eaten the wife and the babies, that he would be strong enough to go away. Presently the weasel came down from his meal, and looked so fierce and savage that the rat, strong as he was, was still more anxious to get rid of him as quickly as possible.",mind say weasel wife baby mouse do start climb rat hole wall roof hole beam have good meal mouse rat hate mouse live help much food small get house live see get fat make rat jealous think weasel eat wife baby strong go weasel come meal look fierce savage rat strong anxious get rid possible 
50,"""He told the weasel that there was a way by which he could get to the corn-bin without the least danger, though it was close to the house, and there he would be certain to find the mouse himself, and very likely another Miss Mouse whom he used to meet there. At this the weasel was so excited he could hardly wait to be shown the way, and asked the rat to put him in the road directly; he was so hungry he did not care what he did. Without delay the rat took him to the mouth of the hole, and told him to stay there and listen a minute to be sure that no one was coming. If he could not hear any footsteps, all he had to do was to rush across the road there, only two or three yards, to the rough grass, the dandelions, and the docks opposite. Just there there was an iron grating made in the wall of the house to let in the air and keep the rats out; but one of the bars had rusted off and was broken, and that was the mouse's track to the corn-bin.",tell weasel be way get corn bin least danger close house certain find mouse use meet weasel excited wait show way ask rat put road hungry care delay rat take mouth hole tell stay listen minute sure come hear footstep have do rush road yard rough grass dandelion dock opposite be iron grating make wall house let air keep rat bar rust break mouse track corn bin 
51,"""The weasel put out his head, glanced round, saw no one, and without waiting to listen rushed out into the roadway. In an instant the rat pushed against a small piece of loose stone, which he kept for the purpose, and it fell down and shut up the mouth of his hole. As the weasel was running across the roadway suddenly one of the labourers came round the corner with a bucket of food for the pigs. Frightened beyond measure, the weasel hastened back to the rat's hole, but could not get in because of the stone. Not knowing what to do, he ran round the cart-house, where there was some grass under the wall, with the man coming close behind him. Now it was just there that the bailiff had set the gin for the rat, near the mouth of the drain, but the rat knew all about it, and used the other hole.",weasel put head glance see wait listen rush roadway instant rat push small piece loose stone keep purpose fall shut mouth hole weasel run roadway labourer come corner bucket food pig frighten measure weasel hasten rat hole get stone know do run cart house be grass wall man come close bailiff set gin rat mouth drain rat know use other hole 
52,"""The grass, knowing that we wished to drive the weasel that way into the gin, had tried to grow faster and hide the trap, but could not get on very well because the weather was so dry. But that morning, when the rat upset Pan's bowl of water, and it ran down the drain, some part of it reached the roots of the grass and moistened them, then the grass shot up quick and quite hid the trap, except one little piece. Now, seeing the weasel rushing along in his fright, the grass was greatly excited, but did not know what to do to hide this part, so the grass whispered to his friend the wind to come to his help.",grass know wish drive weasel way gin try grow fast hide trap get weather dry morning rat upset bowl water run drain part reach root grass moisten grass shoot hide trap little piece see weasel rush fright grass excited know do hide part grass whisper friend wind come help 
53,"""This the wind was very ready to do, for this reason--he hated to smell the decaying carcases of the poor creatures the weasel killed, and left to rot and to taint the air, so that it quite spoilt his morning ramble over the fields. With a puff the wind came along and blew a dead leaf, one of last year's leaves, over the trap, and so hid it completely.",wind ready do reason hate smell decay carcase poor creature weasel kill leave rot taint air spoil morning ramble field puff wind come blow dead leaf last year leave trap hide 
54,"""The weasel saw the mouth of the drain, and thinking to be safe in a minute darted at it, and was snapped up by the gin. The sudden shock deprived him of sense or motion, and well for him it did, for had he squeaked or moved ever so little the man with the bucket must have seen or heard him. After a time he came to himself, and again began to beg the rat to help him; but the rat, having had his revenge on the mouse, did not much care to trouble about it, and, besides, he remembered how very wolfish and fierce the weasel had looked at him when in his hole. At least he thought he would have a night's sleep in comfort first, for he had been afraid to sleep a wink with the weasel so near. Now the weasel was in the gin he could have a nap.",weasel see mouth drain think safe minute dart snap gin sudden shock deprive sense motion squeak move little man bucket see hear time come begin beg rat help rat have revenge mouse care trouble remember wolfish fierce weasel look hole least think have night sleep comfort afraid sleep wink weasel weasel gin have nap

Well, in the morning the weasel begged so piteously of the rat to help him again, that the rat began to think he would, now he had had a good sleep, when just as he was peeping out along you came, Bevis, dear, and found the weasel in the gin.",night weasel gin certainty see bailiff sure come look trap remember dear very day lose asleep oak confusion gin forget morning weasel begg rat help rat begin think have good sleep peep come dear find weasel gin 
56,"""Now, I daresay you remember the talk you had with the weasel, and what the mouse said; well, the rat was listening all the while, and he heard the weasel say to you that he always killed the rats. 'Aha!' thought the rat, 'catch me helping you again, sir;' and the weasel heard him say it. So when you stepped on the spring and loosed the weasel, he did not dare go into the drain, knowing that the rat (while awake) was stronger than he, but hobbled as well as he could across to the wood-pile. There he stopped, exhausted, and stiff from his wounds. Meantime the rat deliberated how best he could drive the treacherous weasel away from the place.",remember talk have weasel mouse say rat listen while hear weasel say kill rat think rat catch help sir weasel hear say step spring loose weasel dare go drain know rat awake strong hobble wood pile stop exhaust stiff wound rat deliberate good drive treacherous weasel place 
57,"""At night, accordingly, he cautiously left his hole and went across to the tub where Pan was sleeping, curled up comfortably within. The end of Pan's chain, where it was fastened to the staple outside the tub, was not of iron, but tar-cord. The last link had been broken, and it was therefore tied in this manner. The rat easily gnawed through the tar-cord, and then slipped back to his hole to await events. About the middle of the night, when the weasel had rested and began to stir out, Pan woke up, and seeing that it was light, stepped out to bay at the moon. He immediately found that his chain was undone, and rushed about to try and find some water, being very thirsty. He had not gone very far before he smelt the weasel, and instantly began to chase him. The weasel, however, slipped under a faggot, and so across and under the wood-pile, where he was safe; but he was so alarmed that presently he crept out the other side, and round by the pig-sty, and so past the stable to the rick-yard, and then into the hedge, and he never stopped running, stiff as he was, till he was half-a-mile away in the ash copse and had crept into a rabbit's hole. He could not have got away from the wood-pile, only Pan, being so thirsty, gave up looking for him, and went down to the brook.",night leave hole go tub pan sleep curl end chain fasten staple tub iron tar cord last link break tie manner rat gnaw tar cord slip hole await event middle night weasel rest begin stir pan wake see light step bay moon find chain undone rush try find water thirsty go smell weasel begin chase weasel slip faggot wood pile safe alarmed creep other side pig-sty stable rick yard hedge stop run stiff half mile ash copse creep rabbit hole get wood pile pan thirsty give look go brook

You must know that when the weasel was in the trap we all thought it was quite safe, and that our enemy was done for at last, and so we went off to a dancing-party, on the short grass of the downs by moonlight, leaving our leverets to nibble near the wheat. We stayed at the dancing-party so late that the dawn came and we were afraid to go home in the daylight, and next night we all felt so merry we had another dance, and again danced till it was morning.",morning think pan break chain kick spaniel howl tub come sad part dear know weasel trap think safe enemy do last go dancing party short grass down moonlight leave leveret nibble wheat stay dancing party late dawn come afraid go daylight next night feel merry have dance dance morning 
59,"""While we were sleeping in the day, the weasel, having now recovered a good deal, crept out from the rabbit-hole in the copse. We were so far off, you see, the mice could not send us word that he had escaped from the gin in time, and, indeed, none of them knew exactly where to find us; they told the swallows, and the swallows searched, but missed us. The wind, too, blew as many ways as he could to try and reach us, but he had to blow east that day, and could not manage it. If we had only been at home we should have been on the watch; but my poor leveret, and my two friends' poor leverets, were sleeping so comfortably when the wicked weasel stole on them one by one, and bit their necks and killed them.

61,"But when he looked round he had got neither of them; he had dropped the bow in the Home Field when he jumped into the ditch to scramble through the hedge, and he had wandered so far among the cowslips that he could not see the arrow.

77,"While Bevis was thinking about this, and how stupid it was of the hares to have roads, the hare ran off, and in two or three minutes came to him through the cowslips. ""Oh, you pretty creature!"" said Sir Bevis, stooping down and stroking her back, and playing with the tips of her long ears. ""Oh, I do love you so!"" At this the hare was still more pleased, and rubbed her head against Bevis's hand.",think stupid hare have road hare run minute come cowslip creature say stoop stroke back play tip long ear love hare pleased rub head hand

She went on before him, and Bevis ran behind, and in a minute or two they went over the rising ground, past the tall stone (put there for the cows to rub their sides against), and then the hare stopped and showed Bevis the great oak tree, where he once went to sleep. She told him to look at it well, and recollect the shape of it, so that another time he could find his way home by the tree. Then she told him to walk straight to the tree, and on his way there he would find the arrow, and close by the tree was the gap in the hedge, and when he got through the gap, he would see the house and the ricks, and if he followed the ditch then he would presently come to the place where he dropped his bow. ""Thank you,"" said Bevis, ""I will run as fast as I can, for I am sure it must be nearly dinner time. Good-bye, you pretty creature;"" and having stroked her ears just once more, off he started. In a few minutes he found his arrow, and looked back to show it to the hare, but she was gone; so he went on to the oak, got through the gap, and there was the house at the other side of the field. He could hear Pan barking, so he felt quite at home, and walked along the ditch till he picked up his bow. He was very hungry when he got home, and yet he was glad when the dinner was over, that he might go to the cupboard and get his brass cannon.",say come stay short grass dog see follow dear go run minute go rise ground tall stone put cow rub side hare stop show great oak tree go sleep tell look recollect shape time find way tree tell walk tree way find arrow close tree gap hedge get gap see house rick follow ditch come place drop bow thank say run sure dinner time good pretty creature stroke ear more start few minute find arrow look show hare gone go oak get gap be house other side field hear pan barking feel home walk ditch pick bow hungry get glad dinner go cupboard get brass 
79,"When he came to examine the cannon, and to think about shooting the weasel with it, he soon found that it would not do very well, because he could not hold it in his hand and point it straight, and when it went off it would most likely burn his fingers. But looking at his papa's gun he saw that the barrel, where the powder is put in, was fixed in a wooden handle called the stock, so he set to work with his pocket-knife to make a handle for his cannon. He cut a long thick willow stick, choosing the willow because it was soft and easiest to cut, and chipped away till he had made a groove in it at one end in which he put the cannon, fastening it in with a piece of thin copper wire twisted round. Next he cut a ramrod, and then he loaded his gun, and fired it off with a match to see how it went.",come examine cannon think shoot weasel find do hold hand point go burn finger look papa gun see barrel powder put fix wooden handle call stock set work pocket knife make handle cut long thick willow stick choose willow soft easy cut chip make groove end put cannon fasten piece thin copper wire twist cut ramrod load gun fire match see go 
80,"This he did at the bottom of the orchard, a long way from the house, for he was afraid that if they saw what he was doing they might take it from him, so he kept it hidden in the summer-house under an old sack. The cannon went off with a good bang, and the shot he had put in it stuck in the bark of an apple tree. Bevis jumped about with delight, and thought he could now kill the weasel. It was too late to start that day, but the next morning off he marched with his gun into the Home Field, and having charged it behind the shelter of a tree out of sight, began his chase for the weasel.",do bottom orchard long way house afraid see do take keep hide summer house old sack can go good bang shot put stick bark apple tree jump delight think kill weasel late start day next morning march gun charge shelter tree sight begin chase weasel

The rabbits knew very well, but they were afraid to answer, lest the weasel should hear about it, and come and kill the one that had betrayed him. Twice he searched up and down without success, and was just going to call to the hare to come and show him, when suddenly he discovered a thrush sitting on her nest in a bush. He put down his gun, and was going to see how many eggs she had got, when the weasel (who had no idea he was there) peeped over the bank, having a fancy for the eggs, but afraid that the nest was too high for him to reach.",field go look ditch hedge ask rabbit hole know scoundrel rabbit know afraid answer weasel hear come kill one betray search success go call hare come show discover thrush sit nest bush put gun go see many egg get weasel have idea peep bank have fancy egg afraid nest high reach
