1,CHAPTER 16. THE END OF THE TREASURE-SEEKING,end treasure seeking 
2,"Now it is coming near the end of our treasure-seeking, and the end was so wonderful that now nothing is like it used to be. It is like as if our fortunes had been in an earthquake, and after those, you know, everything comes out wrong-way up.",come end treasure seek end wonderful use fortune earthquake know come wrong 
3,"The day after the Uncle speared the pudding with us opened in gloom and sadness. But you never know. It was destined to be a day when things happened. Yet no sign of this appeared in the early morning. Then all was misery and upsetness. None of us felt quite well; I don’t know why: and Father had one of his awful colds, so Dora persuaded him not to go to London, but to stay cosy and warm in the study, and she made him some gruel. She makes it better than Eliza does; Eliza’s gruel is all little lumps, and when you suck them it is dry oatmeal inside.",day spear pudding open gloom sadness know destine day thing happen sign appear early morning misery upsetness feel know have awful cold persuade go stay cosy warm study make gruel make good gruel little lump suck dry oatmeal 
4,"We kept as quiet as we could, and I made H. O. do some lessons, like the G. B. had advised us to. But it was very dull. There are some days when you seem to have got to the end of all the things that could ever possibly happen to you, and you feel you will spend all the rest of your life doing dull things just the same way. Days like this are generally wet days. But, as I said, you never know.",keep quiet make do lesson advise dull be day seem get end thing happen feel spend rest life do dull thing same way day wet day say know 
5,"Then Dicky said if things went on like this he should run away to sea, and Alice said she thought it would be rather nice to go into a convent. H. O. was a little disagreeable because of the powder Eliza had given him, so he tried to read two books at once, one with each eye, just because Noel wanted one of the books, which was very selfish of him, so it only made his headache worse. H. O. is getting old enough to learn by experience that it is wrong to be selfish, and when he complained about his head Oswald told him whose fault it was, because I am older than he is, and it is my duty to show him where he is wrong. But he began to cry, and then Oswald had to cheer him up because of Father wanting to be quiet. So Oswald said--",say thing go run sea say think nice go convent little disagreeable powder give try read book eye want book selfish make headache bad get old learn experience wrong selfish complain head tell fault old duty show wrong begin cry have cheer father want quiet say 
6,‘They’ll eat H. O. if you don’t look out!’ And Dora said Oswald was too bad.,eat look say bad 
7,"Of course Oswald was not going to interfere again, so he went to look out of the window and see the trams go by, and by and by H. O. came and looked out too, and Oswald, who knows when to be generous and forgiving, gave him a piece of blue pencil and two nibs, as good as new, to keep.",course go interfere go look window see tram go come look know generous forgiving give piece blue pencil nib good new keep 
8,As they were looking out at the rain splashing on the stones in the street they saw a four-wheeled cab come lumbering up from the way the station is. Oswald called out--,look rain splash stone street see wheel cab come lumber way station call 
9,"‘Here comes the coach of the Fairy Godmother. It’ll stop here, you see if it doesn’t!’",come coach stop see 
10,"So they all came to the window to look. Oswald had only said that about stopping and he was stricken with wonder and amaze when the cab really did stop. It had boxes on the top and knobby parcels sticking out of the window, and it was something like going away to the seaside and something like the gentleman who takes things about in a carriage with the wooden shutters up, to sell to the drapers’ shops. The cabman got down, and some one inside handed out ever so many parcels of different shapes and sizes, and the cabman stood holding them in his arms and grinning over them.",come window look say stop stricken wonder amaze cab stop have box top knobby parcel stick window go seaside gentleman take thing carriage wooden shutter sell draper shop cabman get one hand many parcel different shape size cabman stand hold arm grinn 
11,"Dora said, ‘It is a pity some one doesn’t tell him this isn’t the house.’ And then from inside the cab some one put out a foot feeling for the step, like a tortoise’s foot coming out from under his shell when you are holding him off the ground, and then a leg came and more parcels, and then Noel cried--",say pity one tell house cab one put foot feel step tortoise foot come shell hold ground leg come more parcel cry 
12,‘It’s the poor Indian!’,poor indian 
13,And it was.,
14,"Eliza opened the door, and we were all leaning over the banisters. Father heard the noise of parcels and boxes in the hall, and he came out without remembering how bad his cold was. If you do that yourself when you have a cold they call you careless and naughty. Then we heard the poor Indian say to Father--",open door lean banister father hear noise parcel box hall come remember bad cold do have cold call careless naughty hear poor indian say father 
15,"‘I say, Dick, I dined with your kids yesterday--as I daresay they’ve told you. Jolliest little cubs I ever saw! Why didn’t you let me see them the other night? The eldest is the image of poor Janey--and as to young Oswald, he’s a man! If he’s not a man, I’m a nigger! Eh!--what? And Dick, I say, I shouldn’t wonder if I could find a friend to put a bit into that business of yours--eh?’",say dine kid yesterday daresay tell jolliest little cub see let see other night old image poor young man man nigger say wonder find friend put bit business 
16,"Then he and Father went into the study and the door was shut--and we went down and looked at the parcels. Some were done up in old, dirty newspapers, and tied with bits of rag, and some were in brown paper and string from the shops, and there were boxes. We wondered if the Uncle had come to stay and this was his luggage, or whether it was to sell. Some of it smelt of spices, like merchandise--and one bundle Alice felt certain was a bale. We heard a hand on the knob of the study door after a bit, and Alice said--",go study door shut go look parcel do old dirty newspaper tie bit rag brown paper string shop be box wonder come stay luggage sell smell spice merchandise bundle feel certain bale hear hand knob study door bit say 
17,"‘Fly!’ and we all got away but H. O., and the Uncle caught him by the leg as he was trying to get upstairs after us.",fly get catch leg try get 
18,"‘Peeping at the baggage, eh?’ said the Uncle, and the rest of us came down because it would have been dishonourable to leave H. O. alone in a scrape, and we wanted to see what was in the parcels.",peep baggage say rest come dishonourable leave scrape want see parcel 
19,"‘I didn’t touch,’ said H. O. ‘Are you coming to stay? I hope you are.’",touch say come stay hope 
20,"‘No harm done if you did touch,’ said the good, kind, Indian man to all of us. ‘For all these parcels are _for you_.’",harm do touch say good kind indian man parcel 
21,"I have several times told you about our being dumb with amazement and terror and joy, and things like that, but I never remember us being dumber than we were when he said this.",have several time tell dumb amazement terror joy thing remember dumber say 
22,"The Indian Uncle went on: ‘I told an old friend of mine what a pleasant dinner I had with you, and about the threepenny-bit, and the divining-rod, and all that, and he sent all these odds and ends as presents for you. Some of the things came from India.’",indian go tell old friend pleasant dinner have threepenny bit divining rod send odd end present thing come 
23,"‘Have you come from India, Uncle?’ Noel asked; and when he said ‘Yes’ we were all very much surprised, for we never thought of his being that sort of Indian. We thought he was the Red kind, and of course his not being accounted for his ignorance of beavers and things.",come ask say surprised think sort think red kind course account ignorance beaver thing 
24,"He got Eliza to help, and we took all the parcels into the nursery and he undid them and undid them and undid them, till the papers lay thick on the floor. Father came too and sat in the Guy Fawkes chair. I cannot begin to tell you all the things that kind friend of Uncle’s had sent us. He must be a very agreeable person.",get help take parcel nursery undid undid undid paper lay thick floor come sit chair begin tell thing kind friend send agreeable person 
25,"There were toys for the kids and model engines for Dick and me, and a lot of books, and Japanese china tea-sets for the girls, red and white and gold--there were sweets by the pound and by the box--and long yards and yards of soft silk from India, to make frocks for the girls--and a real Indian sword for Oswald and a book of Japanese pictures for Noel, and some ivory chess men for Dicky: the castles of the chessmen are elephant-and-castles. There is a railway station called that; I never knew what it meant before. The brown paper and string parcels had boxes of games in them--and big cases of preserved fruits and things. And the shabby old newspaper parcels and the boxes had the Indian things in. I never saw so many beautiful things before. There were carved fans and silver bangles and strings of amber beads, and necklaces of uncut gems--turquoises and garnets, the Uncle said they were--and shawls and scarves of silk, and cabinets of brown and gold, and ivory boxes and silver trays, and brass things. The Uncle kept saying, ‘This is for you, young man,’ or ‘Little Alice will like this fan,’ or ‘Miss Dora would look well in this green silk, I think. Eh!--what?’",be toy kid model engine lot book japanese china tea- set girl red white gold be sweet pound box long yard yard soft silk make frock girl real indian sword book japanese picture ivory chess man castle chessmen elephant castle be railway station call know mean brown paper string parcel have box game big case preserve fruit thing shabby old newspaper parcel box have indian thing see many beautiful thing be carve fan silver bangle string amber bead necklace uncut gem turquoise garnet say shawl scarve silk cabinet brown gold ivory box silver tray brass thing keep say young man little like fan look green silk think 
26,"And Father looked on as if it was a dream, till the Uncle suddenly gave him an ivory paper-knife and a box of cigars, and said, ‘My old friend sent you these, Dick; he’s an old friend of yours too, he says.’ And he winked at my Father, for H. O. and I saw him. And my Father winked back, though he has always told us not to.",father look dream give ivory paper knife box cigar say old friend send old friend say wink see father wink tell 
27,"That was a wonderful day. It was a treasure, and no mistake! I never saw such heaps and heaps of presents, like things out of a fairy-tale--and even Eliza had a shawl. Perhaps she deserved it, for she did cook the rabbit and the pudding; and Oswald says it is not her fault if her nose turns up and she does not brush her hair. I do not think Eliza likes brushing things. It is the same with the carpets. But Oswald tries to make allowances even for people who do not wash their ears.",wonderful day treasure mistake see such heap heap present thing fairy tale have shawl deserve cook rabbit pudding say fault nose turn brush hair think like brush thing same carpet try make allowance person wash ear 
28,"The Indian Uncle came to see us often after that, and his friend always sent us something. Once he tipped us a sovereign each--the Uncle brought it; and once he sent us money to go to the Crystal Palace, and the Uncle took us; and another time to a circus; and when Christmas was near the Uncle said--",indian come see friend send tip sovereign bring send money go crystal take time circus say 
29,"‘You remember when I dined with you, some time ago, you promised to dine with me some day, if I could ever afford to give a dinner-party. Well, I’m going to have one--a Christmas party. Not on Christmas Day, because every one goes home then--but on the day after. Cold mutton and rice pudding. You’ll come? Eh!--what?’",remember dine time promise dine day afford give dinner party go have party one go day cold mutton rice pudding come 
30,"We said we should be delighted, if Father had no objection, because that is the proper thing to say, and the poor Indian, I mean the Uncle, said, ‘No, your Father won’t object--he’s coming too, bless your soul!’",say delighted have objection proper thing say poor mean say father object come bless soul 
31,"We all got Christmas presents for the Uncle. The girls made him a handkerchief case and a comb bag, out of some of the pieces of silk he had given them. I got him a knife with three blades; H. O. got a siren whistle, a very strong one, and Dicky joined with me in the knife, and Noel would give the Indian ivory box that Uncle’s friend had sent on the wonderful Fairy Cab day. He said it was the very nicest thing he had, and he was sure Uncle wouldn’t mind his not having bought it with his own money.",get present girl make handkerchief case comb bag piece silk give get knife blade get siren whistle strong one join knife give indian ivory box friend send wonderful day say nice thing have sure mind buy own money 
32,"I think Father’s business must have got better--perhaps Uncle’s friend put money in it and that did it good, like feeding the starving. Anyway we all had new suits, and the girls had the green silk from India made into frocks, and on Boxing Day we went in two cabs--Father and the girls in one, and us boys in the other.",think business get good friend put money do good feed starve have new suit girl have green silk make frock boxing go cab girl boy other 
33,"We wondered very much where the Indian Uncle lived, because we had not been told. And we thought when the cab began to go up the hill towards the Heath that perhaps the Uncle lived in one of the poky little houses up at the top of Greenwich. But the cab went right over the Heath and in at some big gates, and through a shrubbery all white with frost like a fairy forest, because it was Christmas time. And at last we stopped before one of those jolly, big, ugly red houses with a lot of windows, that are so comfortable inside, and on the steps was the Indian Uncle, looking very big and grand, in a blue cloth coat and yellow sealskin waistcoat, with a bunch of seals hanging from it.",wonder indian live tell think cab begin go hill live poky little house top cab go big gate shrubbery white frost fairy forest time last stop jolly big ugly red house lot window comfortable step indian look big grand blue cloth coat yellow sealskin waistcoat bunch seal hang 
34,‘I wonder whether he has taken a place as butler here?’ said Dicky.,wonder take place butler say 
35,"‘A poor, broken-down man--’",poor break down man 
36,"Noel thought it was very likely, because he knew that in these big houses there were always thousands of stately butlers.",think likely know big house be thousand stately butler 
37,"The Uncle came down the steps and opened the cab door himself, which I don’t think butlers would expect to have to do. And he took us in. It was a lovely hall, with bear and tiger skins on the floor, and a big clock with the faces of the sun and moon dodging out when it was day or night, and Father Time with a scythe coming out at the hours, and the name on it was ‘Flint. Ashford. 1776’; and there was a fox eating a stuffed duck in a glass case, and horns of stags and other animals over the doors.",come step open cab door think butler expect have do take lovely hall bear tiger skin floor big clock face sun moon dodg day night scythe come hour name be fox eat stuff duck glass case horn stag other animal door 
38,"‘We’ll just come into my study first,’ said the Uncle, ‘and wish each other a Merry Christmas.’ So then we knew he wasn’t the butler, but it must be his own house, for only the master of the house has a study.",come study say wish other know butler own house master house have study 
39,"His study was not much like Father’s. It had hardly any books, but swords and guns and newspapers and a great many boots, and boxes half unpacked, with more Indian things bulging out of them.",study have book sword gun newspaper great many boot box unpack more indian thing bulg 
40,"We gave him our presents and he was awfully pleased. Then he gave us his Christmas presents. You must be tired of hearing about presents, but I must remark that all the Uncle’s presents were watches; there was a watch for each of us, with our names engraved inside, all silver except H. O.’s, and that was a Waterbury, ‘To match his boots,’ the Uncle said. I don’t know what he meant.",give present pleased give present tired hear present remark present watch be watch name engrave silver match boot say know mean 
41,"Then the Uncle looked at Father, and Father said, ‘You tell them, sir.’",look say tell sir 
42,So the Uncle coughed and stood up and made a speech. He said--,cough stand make speech say 
43,"‘Ladies and gentlemen, we are met together to discuss an important subject which has for some weeks engrossed the attention of the honourable member opposite and myself.’",lady gentleman meet discuss important subject week engross attention honourable member opposite 
44,"I said, ‘Hear, hear,’ and Alice whispered, ‘What happened to the guinea-pig?’ Of course you know the answer to that.",say hear hear whisper happen guinea pig course know answer 
45,The Uncle went on--,go 
46,"‘I am going to live in this house, and as it’s rather big for me, your Father has agreed that he and you shall come and live with me. And so, if you’re agreeable, we’re all going to live here together, and, please God, it’ll be a happy home for us all. Eh!--what?’",go live house big father agree come live agreeable go live happy home 
47,"He blew his nose and kissed us all round. As it was Christmas I did not mind, though I am much too old for it on other dates. Then he said, ‘Thank you all very much for your presents; but I’ve got a present here I value more than anything else I have.’",blow nose kiss mind old other date say thank present get present value more else have 
48,"I thought it was not quite polite of him to say so, till I saw that what he valued so much was a threepenny-bit on his watch-chain, and, of course, I saw it must be the one we had given him.",think polite say see value threepenny bit watch chain course see one give 
49,"He said, ‘You children gave me that when you thought I was the poor Indian, and I’ll keep it as long as I live. And I’ve asked some friends to help us to be jolly, for this is our house-warming. Eh!--what?’",say child give think poor keep live ask friend help jolly house warming 
50,"Then he shook Father by the hand, and they blew their noses; and then Father said, ‘Your Uncle has been most kind--most--’",shake father hand blow nose say uncle kind most 
51,"But Uncle interrupted by saying, ‘Now, Dick, no nonsense!’ Then H. O. said, ‘Then you’re not poor at all?’ as if he were very disappointed. The Uncle replied, ‘I have enough for my simple wants, thank you, H. O.; and your Father’s business will provide him with enough for yours. Eh!--what?’",interrupt say nonsense say poor disappointed reply have enough simple want thank father business provide enough 
52,"Then we all went down and looked at the fox thoroughly, and made the Uncle take the glass off so that we could see it all round and then the Uncle took us all over the house, which is the most comfortable one I have ever been in. There is a beautiful portrait of Mother in Father’s sitting-room. The Uncle must be very rich indeed. This ending is like what happens in Dickens’s books; but I think it was much jollier to happen like a book, and it shows what a nice man the Uncle is, the way he did it all.",go look fox make uncle take glass see take house comfortable one be beautiful portrait sitting room uncle rich ending happen book think jolly happen book show nice man uncle way do 
53,"Think how flat it would have been if the Uncle had said, when we first offered him the one and threepence farthing, ‘Oh, I don’t want your dirty one and three-pence! I’m very rich indeed.’ Instead of which he saved up the news of his wealth till Christmas, and then told us all in one glorious burst. Besides, I can’t help it if it is like Dickens, because it happens this way. Real life is often something like books.",think flat say offer one threepence farthing want dirty one pence rich save news wealth tell glorious burst help happen way real life book 
54,"Presently, when we had seen the house, we were taken into the drawing-room, and there was Mrs Leslie, who gave us the shillings and wished us good hunting, and Lord Tottenham, and Albert-next-door’s Uncle--and Albert-next-door, and his Mother (I’m not very fond of her), and best of all our own Robber and his two kids, and our Robber had a new suit on. The Uncle told us he had asked the people who had been kind to us, and Noel said, ‘Where is my noble editor that I wrote the poetry to?’",see house take draw room be give shilling wish good hunting next door next door mother fond good own kid have new suit tell ask person kind say noble editor write poetry 
55,"The Uncle said he had not had the courage to ask a strange editor to dinner; but Lord Tottenham was an old friend of Uncle’s, and he had introduced Uncle to Mrs Leslie, and that was how he had the pride and pleasure of welcoming her to our house-warming. And he made her a bow like you see on a Christmas card.",say have courage ask strange editor dinner old friend introduce have pride pleasure welcoming house warming make bow see card 
56,"Then Alice asked, ‘What about Mr Rosenbaum? He was kind; it would have been a pleasant surprise for him.’",ask kind pleasant surprise 
57,"But everybody laughed, and Uncle said--",laugh say 
58,‘Your father has paid him the sovereign he lent you. I don’t think he could have borne another pleasant surprise.’,father pay sovereign loan think borne pleasant surprise 
59,"And I said there was the butcher, and he was really kind; but they only laughed, and Father said you could not ask all your business friends to a private dinner.",say be butcher kind laugh say ask business friend private dinner 
60,"Then it was dinner-time, and we thought of Uncle’s talk about cold mutton and rice. But it was a beautiful dinner, and I never saw such a dessert! We had ours on plates to take away into another sitting-room, which was much jollier than sitting round the table with the grown-ups. But the Robber’s kids stayed with their Father. They were very shy and frightened, and said hardly anything, but looked all about with very bright eyes. H. O. thought they were like white mice; but afterwards we got to know them very well, and in the end they were not so mousy. And there is a good deal of interesting stuff to tell about them; but I shall put all that in another book, for there is no room for it in this one. We played desert islands all the afternoon and drank Uncle’s health in ginger wine. It was H. O. that upset his over Alice’s green silk dress, and she never even rowed him. Brothers ought not to have favourites, and Oswald would never be so mean as to have a favourite sister, or, if he had, wild horses should not make him tell who it was.",dinner time think talk cold mutton rice beautiful dinner see dessert have plate take sitting room jolly sit table grow up kid stay father shy frighten say look bright eye think white mouse get know end mousy be good deal interesting stuff tell put book be room one play desert island afternoon drink uncle health ginger wine upset green silk dress row brother have favourite mean have favourite sister have wild horse make tell 
61,"And now we are to go on living in the big house on the Heath, and it is very jolly.",go live big house jolly 
62,"Mrs Leslie often comes to see us, and our own Robber and Albert-next-door’s uncle. The Indian Uncle likes him because he has been in India too and is brown; but our Uncle does not like Albert-next-door. He says he is a muff. And I am to go to Rugby, and so are Noel and H. O., and perhaps to Balliol afterwards. Balliol is my Father’s college. It has two separate coats of arms, which many other colleges are not allowed. Noel is going to be a poet and Dicky wants to go into Father’s business.",come see own next door uncle indian uncle like brown uncle like next door say muff go college have separate coat arm many other college allow go poet want go business 
63,"The Uncle is a real good old sort; and just think, we should never have found him if we hadn’t made up our minds to be Treasure Seekers! Noel made a poem about it--",real good old sort think find make mind treasure seeker make poem

65,"I thought it was rather rot, but Alice would show it to the Uncle, and he liked it very much. He kissed Alice and he smacked Noel on the back, and he said, ‘I don’t think I’ve done so badly either, if you come to that, though I was never a regular professional treasure seeker. Eh!--what?’",think rot show like kiss smack back say think do come regular professional treasure seeker
