1,CHAPTER III. A LITTLE PEACEMAKER.,little 
2," It was a very strange event which had befallen old Oliver. He went back to his own chair, where he smoked his Broseley pipe every night, and sank down in it, rubbing his legs softly; for it was a long time since he had nursed any child, and even Dolly's small weight was a burden to him. Her tiny clothes were scattered up and down, and there was no one beside himself to gather them together, and fold them straight. In shaking out her frock a letter fell from it, and Oliver picked it up wondering whoever it could be for. It was directed to himself, ""Mr. James Oliver, News-agent,"" and he broke the seal with eager expectation. The contents were these, written in a handwriting which he knew at first sight to be his daughter's:--",strange event befall old go own chair smoke pipe night sink rub leg long time nurse child small weight burden tiny clothes scatter be gather fold shake frock letter fall pick wonder direct agent break seal eager expectation content write handwriting know first sight daughter

I'm certain sure you'll never turn her away from your door. I'm going down to Portsmouth for three days, because he listed five months ago, and his regiment's ordered out to India, and he sails on Friday. So I thought I wouldn't take my little girl to be in the way, and I said I'll leave her with father till I come back, and her pretty little ways will soften him towards me, and we'll live all together in peace and plenty till his regiment comes home again, poor fellow. For he's very good to me when he's not in liquor, which is seldom for a man. Please do forgive me for pity's sake, and for Christ's sake, if I'm worthy to use his name, and do take care of my little girl till I come home to you both on Friday, From your now dutiful daughter,",sorry do make angry poor little girl come little peacemaker certain sure turn door go day list month regiment order sail think take little girl way say leave father come pretty little way soften live peace plenty regiment come poor fellow good liquor man forgive pity sake sake worthy use name take care little girl come dutiful daughter

6,"The tears rolled fast down old Oliver's cheeks as he read this letter through twice, speaking the words half aloud to himself. Why! this was his own little grandchild, then--his very own! And no doubt Susan had christened her Dorothy, after her own mother, his dear wife, who had died so many years ago. Dolly was the short for Dorothy, and in early times he had often called his wife by that name. He had turned his gas off and lighted a candle, and now he took it up and went to the bedside to look at his new treasure. The tiny face lying upon his pillow was rosy with sleep, and the fair curly hair was tossed about in pretty disorder. His spectacles grew very dim indeed, and he was obliged to polish them carefully on his cotton handkerchief before he could see his grand-daughter plainly enough. Then he touched her dimpled cheek tremblingly with the end of his finger, and sobbed out, ""Bless her! bless her!"" He returned to his chair, his head shaking a good deal before he could regain his composure; and it was not until he had kindled his pipe, and was smoking it, with his face turned towards the sleeping child, that he felt at all like himself again.",tear roll old cheek read letter speak word half own little grandchild own christen own mother dear wife die many year short early time call wife name turn gas light candle take go bedside look new treasure tiny face lie pillow rosy sleep fair curly hair toss pretty disorder spectacle grow dim oblige polish cotton handkerchief see grand daughter touch dimple cheek end finger sobb bless bless return chair head shake good deal regain composure kindle pipe smoke face turn sleeping child feel 
7,"""Dear Lord!"" he said, half aloud, between the whiffs of his pipe, ""dear Lord! how very good thou art to me! Didst thee not say, 'I'll not leave thee comfortless, I'll come to thee?' I know what that means, bless thy name; and the good Spirit has many a time brought me comfort, and cheered my heart. I know thou didst not leave me alone before. No, no! that was far from thee, Lord. Alone!--why, thou'rt always here; and now there's the little lass as well. Lonesome!--they don't know thee, Lord, and they don't know me. Thou'rt here, with the little lass and me. Yes, yes,--yes.""",dear say half whiff pipe dear good art say leave comfortless come know mean bless name good have many time bring comfort cheer heart know leave be little lass know know little lass 
8,"He murmured the word ""yes"" in a tone of contentment over and over again, until, the pipe being finished, he prepared for sleep also. But no sleep came to the old man. He was too full of thought, and too fearful of the child waking in the night and wanting something. The air was close and hot, and now and then a peal of thunder broke overhead; but a profound peace and tranquillity, slightly troubled by his new joy, held possession of him. His grandchild was there, and his daughter was coming back to him in three days.",murmure word tone contentment pipe finish prepare sleep sleep come old man full thought fearful child wake night want air close hot peal thunder break profound peace tranquillity trouble new joy hold possession grandchild daughter come day 
9,"Oh, how he would welcome her! He would not let her speak one word of her wilfulness and disobedience, and the long, cruel neglect which had left him in ignorance of where she lived, and what had become of her. It was partly his fault, for having been too hard upon her, and too hasty and hot-tempered. He had learnt better since then.",welcome let speak word wilfulness disobedience long cruel neglect leave ignorance live become fault hard hasty hot temper learn good
