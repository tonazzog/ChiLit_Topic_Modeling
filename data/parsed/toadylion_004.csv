1,CHAPTER IV. CASTLE PERILOUS.,castle perilous 
2," In one corner of the property of Hugh John's father stood an ancient castle--somewhat doubtfully of it, however, for it was claimed as public property by the adjoining abbey town, now much decayed and fallen from its high estate, but desirous of a new lease of life as a tourist and manufacturing centre. The castle and the abbey had for centuries been jealous neighbours, treacherous friends, embattled enemies according to the fluctuating power of those who possessed them. The lord of the castle harried the abbot and his brethren. The abbot promptly retaliated by launching, in the name of the Church, the dread ban of excommunication against the freebooter. The castle represented feudal rights, the abbey popular and ecclesiastical authority.",corner property father stand ancient castle claim public property adjoin abbey town decay fall high estate desirous new lease life tourist manufacturing centre castle abbey have century jealous neighbour treacherous friend embattled enemy accord fluctuate power possess lord castle harry abbot brethren abbot retaliate launch name dread ban excommunication freebooter castle represent feudal right abbey popular ecclesiastical authority 
3,"And so it was still. Mr. Picton Smith had, indeed, only bought the property a few years before the birth of our hero; but, among other encumbrances, he had taken over a lawsuit with the town concerning the castle, which for years had been dragging its slow length along. Edam Abbey was a show-place of world-wide repute, and the shillings of the tourist constituted a very important item in the finances of the overburdened municipality. If the Council and magistrates of the good town of Edam could add the Castle of Windy Standard to their attractions, the resultant additional sixpence a head would go far towards making up the ancient rental of the town parks, which now let for exactly half of their former value.",buy property few year birth hero other encumbrance take lawsuit town concern castle year drag slow length show place world wide repute shilling tourist constitute important item finances overburden municipality magistrate good town add windy attraction resultant additional sixpence head go make ancient rental town park let half former value 
4,"But Mr. Picton Smith was not minded thus tamely to hand over an ancient fortress, secured to him by deed and charter. He declared at once that he would resist the claims of the town by every means in his power. He would, however, refuse right-of-way to no respectable sightseer. The painter, all unchallenged, might set up his easel there, the poet meditate, even the casual wanderer in search of the picturesque and romantic, have free access to these gloomy and desolate halls. The townspeople would be at liberty to conduct their friends and visitors thither. But Mr. Smith was resolved that the ancient fortalice of the Windy Standard should not be made a vulgar show. Sandwich papers and ginger-beer bottles would not be permitted to profane the green sward of the courtyard, across which had so often ridden all the chivalry of the dead Lorraines.",minded hand ancient fortress secure deed charter declare resist claim town means power refuse right way respectable sightseer painter unchallenged set easel poet meditate casual wanderer search picturesque romantic have free access gloomy desolate hall townspeople liberty conduct friend visitor resolve ancient fortalice windy make vulgar show sandwich paper ginger beer bottle permit profane green sward courtyard ride chivalry dead 
5,"""Those who want sixpenny shows will find plenty at Edam Fair,"" was Mr. Picton Smith's ultimatum. And when he had once committed himself, like most of his stalwart name, Mr. Smith had the reputation of being very set in his mind.",want sixpenny show find plenty ultimatum commit most stalwart name have reputation set mind 
6,But in spite of this the town asserted its right-of-way through the courtyard. A footpath was said to have passed that way by which persons might go to and fro to kirk and market.,spite town assert right way courtyard footpath say pass way person go for kirk market 
7,"""I have no doubt a footpath passed through my dining-room a few centuries ago,"" said Mr. Smith, ""but that does not compel me to keep my front and back doors open for all the rabble of Edam to come and go at their pleasure.""",have doubt footpath pass dining room few century say compel keep front back door open rabble come go pleasure 
8,"And forthwith he locked his lodge gates and bought the largest mastiff he could obtain. The castle stood on an island rather more than a mile long, a little below the mansion house. A wooden bridge led over the deeper, narrower, and more rapid branch of the Edam River from the direction of the abbey and town. Across the broader and shallower branch there could be traced, from the house of Windy Standard, the remains of an ancient causeway. This, in the place where the stream was to be crossed, had become a series of stepping-stones over which Hugh John and Priscilla could go at a run (without falling in and wetting themselves more than once in three or four times), but which still constituted an impregnable barrier to the short fat legs of Toady Lion--who usually stood on the shore and proclaimed his woes to the world at large till somebody carried him over and deposited him on the castle island.",lock lodge gate buy large mastiff obtain castle stand island more mile long little mansion house wooden bridge lead deep narrower rapid branch direction abbey town broad shallower branch trace house windy remains ancient causeway place stream cross become series step stone go run fall wet more time constitute impregnable barrier short fat leg stand shore proclaim woe world large carry deposit castle island 
9,"Affairs were in this unsettled condition when, at twelve years of age, Hugh John ceased to be Hugh John, and became, without, however, losing his usual surname of Smith, one of the august and imperial race of the Buonapartes.",affair unsettled condition year age cease become lose usual surname imperial race 
10,"It was a clear June evening, the kind of night when the whole landscape seems to have been newly swept, washed down, and generally spring-cleaned. All nature spoke peace to Janet Sheepshanks, housekeeper, nurse, and general responsible female head of the house of Windy Standard, when a procession came towards her across the stepping-stones over the broad Edam water from the direction of the castle island. Never had such a disreputable sight presented itself to the eyes of Janet Sheepshanks. At once douce and severe, sharp-tongued and covertly affectionate, she represented the authority of a father who was frequently absent from them, and the memory of a dead mother which remained to the three children in widely different degrees. To Priscilla her mother was a loving being, gracious alike by the tender sympathy of her voice and by the magic of a touch which healed all childish troubles with the kiss of peace upon the place ""to make it well."" To Hugh John she had been a confidant to whom he could rush, eager and dishevelled, with the tale of the glorious defeat of some tin enemy (for even in those prehistoric days Hugh John had been a soldier), and who, smoothing back his ruffled hair, was prepared to join as eagerly as himself in all his tiny triumphs. But to Toady Lion, though he hushed the shrill persistence of his treble to a reverent murmur when he talked of ""muvver,"" she was only an imagination, fostered mostly by Priscilla--his notion of motherhood being taken from his rough-handed loving Janet Sheepshanks; while the tomb in the village churchyard was a place to which he had no desire to accompany his mother, and from whose gloomy precincts he sought to escape as soon as possible.",clear evening kind night whole landscape seem sweep wash spring clean nature speak peace housekeeper nurse general responsible female head house windy procession come step stone broad water direction castle island have disreputable sight present eye severe sharp tongued affectionate represent authority father absent memory dead mother remain child different degree mother loving being gracious tender sympathy voice magic touch healed childish trouble kiss peace place make confidant rush eager dishevelled tale glorious defeat tin enemy prehistoric day soldier smooth ruffled hair prepare join tiny triumph hush shrill persistence treble reverent murmur talk muvver imagination foster notion motherhood take rough hand love tomb village churchyard place have desire accompany mother gloomy precinct seek escape possible
