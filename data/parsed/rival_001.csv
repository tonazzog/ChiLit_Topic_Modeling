Harry!--lazy fellows that you are!--Why are you not in attendance?"" said Lord Robert Summers in an angry tone, throwing the rein of his pony to his grooms, and rushing up the great staircase with his handkerchief held close to his face.",lazy fellow attendance say angry tone throw rein pony groom rush great staircase handkerchief hold face

7,"""They never meet now without a battle,"" returned the groom. ""Lord Robert has been so used to domineer over men twice his age, on board ship, that he is more unbearable than any young man of rank I ever served. I wonder who is to put up with all his tempers? If his elder brother, my young lord, were half so hasty with his hands, or so flippant with his tongue, I would leave his service to-morrow: however, he wont be with us long--that's my comfort. It was but the other day I was airing the dogs, and trod, by accident, on his favourite Neptune's toe. The plaguy beast set up a yell. In an instant, I had a cuff of the head from the young tyrant, and was called a careless rascal and scoundrel, while he had breath to heap such epithets on me. I am glad the lad has given him a dressing, and wish it had been twice as much; it might have done him good.""",meet battle return groom use domineer man age board ship unbearable young man rank serve wonder put temper elder brother young lord half hasty hand flippant tongue leave service comfort other day airing dog trod accident favourite toe plaguy beast set yell instant have cuff head young tyrant call careless rascal scoundrel have breath heap such epithet glad lad give dress wish much do good 
8,"With this wish, George led off the pony. The fact was, Lord Robert had caught Philip Harley trespassing, according to custom, in the Park, and had tried to horsewhip him out of the grounds, but had fairly got the worst of it. Lord Robert, though a stout and courageous youth, was pulled off his horse by the desperate young rustic, and in the fray received several contusions on the face. Philip did not part without some tokens of his enemy's vengeance; but he certainly remained victor in the contest. Lord Robert was glad to regain his pony and make a hasty retreat, much mortified, and in a very evil temper.",wish lead pony fact catch trespass accord custom try horsewhip grounds get bad stout courageous youth pull horse desperate young rustic fray receive several contusion face part token enemy vengeance remain victor contest glad regain pony make hasty retreat mortify evil temper 
9,"When he had reached his apartment, he washed the blood from his face, and composed the swelling of his haughty spirit; and after smoothing his ruffled plumes, he descended into the dining-room and joined the family party. His mother made some inquiry respecting the bruises on his face; but he turned it off with an evasive answer, as the effect of a fall he had met with in the Park. No farther notice was taken, except a slight sarcasm on the proverbial bad horsemanship of sailors.",reach apartment wash blood face compose swell haughty spirit smooth ruffle plume descend dining room join family party mother make inquiry respect bruise face turn evasive answer effect fall meet far notice take slight sarcasm proverbial bad horsemanship sailor 
10,"At the dessert, the Marquis, his father, handed him a letter. ""It is from your uncle, Sir Henry. See, Robert, what a charming surprise he has prepared for you! He spoils you, boy! I think you would not be so petulant and imperious, if every wish of that wayward heart were not gratified by his fond affection.""",dessert father hand letter uncle see charming surprise prepare spoil think petulant imperious wish wayward heart gratified fond affection 
11,"Lord Robert was so eager to read the letter from his beloved uncle, that he scarcely heard this reproof, which, gentle as it was, at any other time would have clouded his handsome brow with frowns.",eager read letter beloved uncle hear reproof gentle other time cloude handsome brow frown 
12,"Captain Sir Henry Stanley wrote to his brother-in-law, that he should sail in the Diomede, from Portsmouth, in less than a month; when he should expect his noble boy, his brave Robert, again to accompany him to victory. ""I think it long till we are afloat,"" continued he; ""and so, I dare say, does my dear nephew. However, that the time may not appear so very tedious, I have sent him a little pleasure-brig, the most complete that could be procured: he can sail and manoeuvre it on your lake; not that I approve of freshwater sailing, but it is better than dancing after horses and dogs, and such landsmen's amusements.""",write brother law sail less month expect noble boy brave accompany victory think afloat continue say dear nephew time appear tedious send little pleasure brig complete procure sail manoeuvre lake approve freshwater sailing good dancing horse dog such landsmen amusement 
13,"Lord Robert then heard that this fairy frigate had been safely landed that day at a sea-port town, some little distance from his father's domains. A waggon and team of horses had been despatched to bring it home; and a servant soon afterwards entered to say that it had arrived, and was carefully placed by the side of the lake, ready for launching, which ceremony Lord Robert, full of impatient joy, sprang off to superintend.",hear fairy frigate land day sea port town little distance father domain waggon team horse despatch bring servant enter say arrive place side lake ready launch ceremony full impatient joy spring superintend 
14,"It sometimes happens that time and tide will not wait obsequiously even on the children of prosperity. These stubborn powers will sometimes fret and chafe the proud and great, and, frequently, are so unpolite as to ruffle a rose-leaf on their couch of pleasure; but, as if the young lord had suffered mortification enough in the morning, his cup of delight was full in the evening. The pleasure was scarcely promised before it was realized. The gay glittering frigate dashed bravely into the lake: she bounded and danced on the waves, with as much spirit as the youthful noble could wish. The bottle of claret was flung with great effect; and she received her name amidst the applauses of the peasantry of the neighbouring village, who, as a great favour, were permitted to behold this sight at an awful distance.",happen time tide wait child prosperity stubborn power fret chafe proud great unpolite ruffle rose leaf couch pleasure young lord suffer mortification morning cup delight full evening pleasure promise realize gay glitter frigate dash lake bound dance wave much spirit youthful noble wish bottle claret flung great effect receive name applause peasantry neighbour village great favour permit behold sight awful distance 
15,"Lord Robert sank to rest that night, anticipating the charming sail he should take in the morning.",sink rest night anticipate charming sail take morning 
16,"The eyes of the young lord were open before sunrise; but whilst his valet was hastily dressing him, what was his indignation, on casting his eyes towards the lake, to see his fairy frigate, his beautiful Ariel, spreading her white sails to the breeze, and gliding on the lake as gallantly as if her noble master were commanding her? Who could be the person that had dared to unmoor her? Down flew Lord Robert, half undressed; and the servants were summoned; but none of the household had been guilty of such a piece of audacity. At last, a thought struck him, that it could be no other than that contemner of all legal authority, Philip Harley. Lord Robert was soon by the border of the lake; and there he saw his young enemy reclined in the gilded pleasure-boat, sailing at his ease, and coasting near enough for Lord Robert to behold the look of calm defiance with which he surveyed his anger: and he continued to manage the Ariel with as much coolness as if her lawful owner had not been viewing her manoeuvres with the greatest indignation. Lord Robert was still more provoked, when he recollected that he had no means of reaching the offender, to expel him from the boat.",eye young lord open sunrise valet dress indignation cast eye lake see fairy frigate beautiful spread white sail breeze glide lake noble master commanding person dare unmoor fly half undress servant summon household guilty piece audacity last thought strike other contemner legal authority border lake see young enemy recline gilded pleasure boat sail ease coast behold look calm defiance survey anger continue manage much coolness lawful owner view manoeuvre great indignation provoke recollect have means reach offender expel boat

18,"""No, my Lord,"" said Edwards, the old gardener; ""there is nothing of the kind on any of the pieces of water within a mile or two of the hall. Your Lordship may remember that when you were very young, and took such a fancy to everything relating to ships and sailing, my Lady had all the boats destroyed, for fear you should endanger your life by venturing on the water.""",say old gardener be kind piece water mile hall lordship remember young take fancy relate ship sailing have boat destroy fear endanger life venture water 
19,"""And have they never been replaced?"" asked Lord Robert.",replace ask 
20,"""No, my Lord: there were two boats and a fishing-punt staved in by her Ladyship's order,"" replied Edwards. ""You may recollect that your Lordship got into sad disgrace, the next day, by embarking on the lake in a large washing-tub.""",be boat fishing punt stave order reply recollect lordship get sad disgrace next day embark lake large washing tub 
21,"Lord Robert could not help laughing. ""On my honour, Edwards,"" said he, ""I could find it in my heart to embark in a washing-tub at present, if I thought it of any use.""",help laugh honour say find heart embark washing tub present think use 
22,"""I think, my Lord,"" said his valet, ""Captain Bently has a small boat on the river, about a mile from the Park.""",think say valet have small boat river mile 
23,"""Run, carry my compliments to Captain Bently, and ask him to lend it to me for an hour.""",run carry compliment ask lend hour 
24,"Two or three messengers started with obedient speed to fulfil the wishes of their master: but the land conveyance of a boat is a work of time; and, long before their return, Philip, tired, as we may suppose, of his amusement, steered the boat to the most distant part of the lake (which happened to be nearest his own home), and jumped on shore, behind some bushes, which jutted out and concealed his landing. He had walked quietly through the Park, and arrived at the village, before Lord Robert perceived, by the irregular drifting of the little vessel, that she was deserted, and the culprit had escaped his vengeance.",messenger start obedient speed fulfil wish master land conveyance boat work time return tired suppose amusement steer boat distant part lake happen own home jump shore bush jutt conceal landing walk arrive village perceive irregular drifting little vessel desert culprit escape vengeance 
25,"Lord Robert was literally glowing with rage, when he met his father in the breakfast-room. For some reason best known to himself, he had hitherto concealed from the Marquis his encounters with Philip Harley; but, in the moment of indignation, everything blazed forth; and, in all the exaggeration of anger, he informed his father of every outrage Philip had been guilty of towards him; adding, that the reason of their first disagreement was, his interrupting Philip in the act of poaching.",glow rage meet father breakfast room reason know conceal encounter moment indignation blaze exaggeration anger inform father outrage guilty add reason first disagreement interrupt act poaching 
26,"The Marquis was a good and humane man; but the representations of Lord Robert highly incensed him. That a young ruffian, exercising the lawless pursuits of a poacher, should take every opportunity of insulting and thwarting his son, and even of brutally assaulting him in his own park, was too much to be endured, and called for the severest punishment. Certainly, of all the species of theft (and it is _theft_), poaching is considered with the least mercy by noblemen and gentlemen of landed property. Perhaps the Marquis may be reckoned severe, but this was an aggravated case.",good humane man representation incense young ruffian exercising lawless pursuit poacher take opportunity insult thwart son assault own park much endure call severest punishment species theft _theft_ poaching consider least mercy noblemen gentleman land property reckon severe aggravate case 
27,"It was then in the middle of the American war, and a press-gang paid pretty frequent visits to the neighbouring sea-port town. His Lordship, therefore, informed them that he wished to remove a noxious person from the vicinity, and they took their measures accordingly.",middle american war press gang pay frequent visit neighbour sea port town inform wish remove noxious person vicinity take measure 
28,"Philip was partial to the sea: he was clever in the management of a boat, and was in the habit of taking trips, now and then, with some seafaring friends. He was preparing for one of these excursions, when the press-gang caught him near the harbour, dressed in a blue jacket and trousers; and the unfortunate youth was immediately dragged from his native place, without even being suffered to bid farewell to his parents; and it was with the greatest difficulty that he obtained leave to inform them of what had befallen him. Indeed, the first news they heard of him was, that he was on board a tender, and destined to sail in the first fleet that left England.",partial sea clever management boat habit take trip seafare friend prepare excursion press gang catch harbour dress blue jacket trousers unfortunate youth drag native place suffer bid farewell parent great difficulty obtain leave inform befall first news hear board tender destine sail first fleet leave 
29,"Philip Harley has hitherto appeared in no very respectable light. That he was a desperate trespasser and depredator is the most favourable opinion that can be formed of him; yet there were people in the neighbourhood, who, having known Philip from his infancy, ventured to think that he had met with harsh treatment, and that his heart, once so good and upright, must have undergone an extraordinary change, or that he had received great provocation, to be guilty of such daring outrages.",appear respectable light desperate trespasser depredator favourable opinion form be person neighbourhood know infancy venture think meet harsh treatment heart good upright undergone extraordinary change receive great provocation guilty such dare outrage 
30,"There is an excellent saying, which, though old and trite, it is sometimes necessary to bear in mind: namely, ""That one story is good till another is told.""--There was, in truth, some little excuse for Philip's conduct; though he certainly deserved blame, and even punishment, for giving up every proper pursuit and feeling to the gratification of resentment.",be excellent saying old trite necessary bear mind story good tell be truth little excuse conduct deserve blame punishment give proper pursuit feeling gratification resentment 
31,"Before Lord Robert's return from his long voyage, Philip Harley was considered as gentle in disposition, as he was manly and high-spirited. At this time, he was just sixteen, and had begun to make himself useful in his father's business, which was that of a carpenter.",return long voyage consider gentle disposition manly high spirit time begin make useful father business carpenter 
32,"His father was rather independent in his circumstances; and his whole family consisted of two children--this Philip, and a lovely little blind girl, called Kate. This unhappy sister (if a creature in the practice of the most angelic patience can be called _unhappy_) was the darling of Philip's heart. Every spare minute he devoted to amusing and caressing this child, who was many years younger than himself; and she returned his love with the most grateful affection. The cottage where they lived fronted the west, and could be seen from the London road; and blind Kate used to take her evening seat on the threshold, waiting to hear the step of this beloved brother on his return from work; with her fair face and glittering curls turned to the setting sun--with a divine expression of hope and peace on her innocent countenance, that attracted the admiration of every passenger.",father independent circumstance whole family consist child lovely little blind girl call unhappy sister creature practice angelic patience call darling heart spare minute devote amusing caress child many year young return love grateful affection cottage live front west see road blind use take evening seat threshold wait hear step beloved brother return work fair face glitter curl turn setting sun divine expression hope peace innocent countenance attract admiration passenger 
33,"Philip had a very large spaniel, one of the handsomest of that beautiful species. This creature he had reared from a puppy, and taught to be obedient to his sister; and in his absence Rover was her only source of amusement; but he was, indeed, a most faithful and attached attendant, serving both for a guard and guide.",have large spaniel handsomest beautiful species creature rear puppy teach obedient sister absence only source amusement faithful attach attendant serve guard guide 
34,"Sometimes Kate would walk on the road before the cottage, with her fair hands grasping Rover's silky coat, who would restrain his natural vivacity to guide the darkling steps of his little mistress. At other times, when the sun shone warm and bright, and the grass was soft and thick, Kate was as full of frolic and play as Rover himself, and would gambol with him a whole spring-day on the lawn in front of the cottage; but as the evening approached, Kate and Rover took their station at the cottage-door, and greeted the return of Philip with the utmost joy. Both were most dear to Philip: he tenderly loved his suffering sister; and he loved the faithful dog for her sake. It is not surprising, therefore, that Philip was almost broken-hearted when Kate fell sick, and after a few days expired. True, she was removed to a better place. Philip knew that she was taken in mercy, as her lot in this world was one of peculiar hardship; but he could not bear to lose her; and he and Rover moped in the most cheerless manner for many days after the funeral.",walk road cottage fair hand grasp silky coat restrain natural vivacity guide darkling step little mistress other time sun shine warm bright grass soft thick full frolic play gambol whole spring day lawn front cottage evening approach take station cottage door greet return utmost joy dear love suffering sister love faithful dog sake surprising break hearted fall sick few day expire true remove good place know take mercy lot world peculiar hardship bear lose mope cheerless manner many day funeral 
35,"It was some little time before this that Lord Robert returned to the hall, after several years' absence. He had promised himself much pleasure from the autumnal field-sports; but in this amusement, as in every other occupation, he was too apt to suffer trifles to ruffle his temper, and make him violent and unreasonable.",little time return hall several year absence promise much pleasure autumnal field sport amusement other occupation apt suffer trifle ruffle temper make violent unreasonable 
36,"One gloomy October evening, Lord Robert was returning with his gun and dogs through the park, attended by a gamekeeper. He had pursued his amusement that day with very little success: everything had gone wrong; the dogs had pointed badly, and his new fowling-piece, that had cost him twenty guineas only the week before, had hung fire several times, at the very moment when the game sprang before him the finest mark possible. In short, he had suffered disappointment enough to vex the heart of the most patient person in the world, who had never in his life felt what real affliction was. At this unlucky minute, it was Philip Harley's ill fortune to cross the park by a public footway that led through the grounds. It was the first day Philip had resumed his work since the death of his sister; and he was walking in a melancholy way, carrying his basket of tools, with his eyes fixed on the ground, attending very little to what was passing around him, and Rover was trudging by his side, when, unluckily, just as Lord Robert came up to him, a hare darted out of some bushes, and Rover scampered after it.",gloomy evening return gun dog park attend gamekeeper pursue amusement day little success go wrong dog point new fowling piece cost guinea week hang fire several time very moment game spring fine mark possible short suffer disappointment vex heart patient person world life feel real affliction unlucky minute ill fortune cross park public footway lead grounds first day resume work death sister walk melancholy way carry basket tool eye fix ground attend little pass trudg side come hare dart bush scamper 
37,"""That is the way all the game is poached off the estate!"" exclaimed Lord Robert in a fit of passion; and, yielding to the influence of temper, he levelled his gun at the dog. The piece, that had so many times missed fire that day, now rang sharp and true: the faithful creature was mortally wounded; he crawled feebly to his master's feet, and expired. Philip hung over his poor dog, while he saw him die, with anguish that gave a painful sensation to Lord Robert; yet still, under the dominion of temper, he said to his servant--",way game poach estate exclaim fit passion yield influence temper levell gun dog piece have many time miss fire day ring sharp true faithful creature wound crawl master foot expire hang poor dog see die anguish give painful sensation dominion temper say servant 
38,"""What a fool the fellow makes of himself about a dog!""",fool fellow make dog 
39,"Philip lifted the body of his poor favourite from the ground, and taking it in his arms, rushed by the young lord, giving him a look of contempt and indignation as he passed.",lift body poor favourite ground take arm rush young lord give look contempt indignation pass 
40,"""It is the dog that used to lead about his blind sister,"" said the humane gamekeeper. ""She is just dead.""",dog use lead blind sister say humane gamekeeper dead 
41,Lord Robert then remembered meeting Kate and the dog when he first came home: he had patted her curly head and admired her beauty.,remember meet dog come patt curly head admire beauty 
42,"""Was it blind Kate's dog?"" said Lord Robert. ""Had I known that, he might have destroyed every head of game on the estate before I would have shot him.""",blind dog say know destroy head game estate shoot 
43,"Perhaps, had Philip heard this half acknowledgment of error, much evil might have been prevented. The next time he met the young noble, it was with the most bitter feelings. He considered that Lord Robert had wantonly murdered the innocent companion of his sister; and all the grief he felt for her loss was turned into rage. Contemptuous words succeeded angry looks: and these ere not to be borne by Lord Robert's untamed spirit; though he felt greatly displeased with himself, and would have given half his fortune to have recalled the past, yet he would not bear Philip's reproaches. A very little provoked him to strike him, and a desperate encounter ensued. This was followed by many others; for Philip neglected all his better pursuits to gratify his revenge; he lay in wait to attack Lord Robert, and took every opportunity of defying him; till the most ferocious hatred took place between the two youths, which led to the consequences we have already seen. In one instance, however, Philip was wrongfully accused, as he never had stained his hands with dishonest practices. Lord Robert well knew that the dog's accidentally chasing the hare was perfectly involuntary on the part of Philip, who was scarcely conscious of it before the poor animal was put to death.",hear half acknowledgment error much evil prevent next time meet young noble bitter feeling consider murder innocent companion sister grief feel loss turn rage contemptuous word succeed angry look borne untamed spirit feel displease give fortune recall past bear reproache little provoke strike desperate encounter ensue follow many other neglect good pursuit gratify revenge lay wait attack take opportunity defy ferocious hatred take place youth lead consequence see instance accuse stain hand dishonest practice know dog chase hare involuntary part conscious poor animal put death 
44,"This incident had given Lord Robert Summers great mental pain: he was as angry with himself as with Philip Harley; he could not bear to think of his conduct in this affair--he could not bear to recall any circumstance relating to it; and only the _name_ of Philip Harley gave him the greatest uneasiness. Yet he was not conscious that the whole of this uneasiness sprang from giving the reins one moment to ungovernable temper; for it was neither Philip nor his dog that had offended or irritated him; but accidental circumstances had put him in a very ill humour, and he vented his temper on the first beings that crossed his path, and, by that means, he was induced to commit an act of cruelty and oppression really foreign to his own disposition, and which outraged the best feelings of a fellow-creature, already under the pressure of acute affliction. If young people will look into their own hearts, they will find that there is no frailty belonging to our erring nature so deceptive as _temper_. Strange as it may appear, it often happens that many individuals, when they express anger, generally wreak it on the last person who would have thought of exciting it. Some unfortunate servant, or still more unhappy dependant, is made the victim of ill humour; which is not only in itself as blind and erring as it is unjust, but also brings with it the additional pain of self-reproach. Yet the heart is not always bad that gives way to its evil dominion; but it is for want of self-examination--of saying, ""I find myself mentally uneasy, perhaps from accidental events, or even from indisposition of body; why then should I make myself odious to this person, who is in my power, and must endure my ill treatment, when a little patience and forbearance will remove the cloud that rests on my mind, and my spirit will rise bright and unclouded, rejoicing in the consciousness of having overcome one of the most painful infirmities of human nature?"" This self-confession (if it may be so called) will bring mental health, and rectify the most irritable disposition.",incident give great mental pain angry bear think conduct affair bear recall circumstance relate _name_ give great uneasiness conscious whole uneasiness spring give rein moment ungovernable temper dog offend irritate accidental circumstance put ill humour vent temper first being cross path means induce commit act cruelty oppression foreign own disposition outrage good feeling fellow creature pressure acute affliction young person look own heart find be frailty belong err nature deceptive strange appear happen many individual express anger wreak last person think exciting unfortunate servant unhappy dependant make victim ill humour blind erring unjust bring additional pain self reproach heart bad give way evil dominion want self examination say find uneasy accidental event indisposition body make odious person power endure ill treatment little patience forbearance remove cloud rest mind spirit rise bright unclouded rejoice consciousness overcome painful infirmity human nature self confession call bring mental health rectify irritable disposition 
45,"Never did a month seem so long, as the time appeared to Lord Robert Summers while he remained on shore. He parted from his noble relatives with the less regret as he longed to be at sea, to lose in active employment the memory of these errors and mortifying reflections.",do month seem long time appear remain shore part noble relative less regret long sea lose active employment memory error mortify reflection 
46,"This young nobleman had passed his examination as lieutenant with the greatest credit; and in a severe engagement between his uncle's ship and a French man-of-war of superior force (which ended in the capture of the Frenchman), Lord Robert Summers behaved with such distinguished valour, that he was considered, both for intrepidity and nautical skill, a most promising young officer; yet, on account of his youth, being but just sixteen, he did not expect his commission for some time to come. In this idea, however, he was agreeably deceived; for, before the Diomede put to sea, he received his commission as lieutenant. Lord Robert was greatly attached to his profession; and this early promotion, which he was conscious was less the effect of interest than desert, seemed to him the first fruits of a brilliant career of naval honours.",young nobleman pass examination lieutenant great credit severe engagement uncle ship french man war superior force end capture behave such distinguished valour consider intrepidity nautical skill promising young officer account youth expect commission time come idea deceive put sea receive commission lieutenant attach profession early promotion conscious effect interest desert seem first fruit brilliant career naval honour 
47,"He was received with transport by Sir Henry Stanley; who, himself an ornament to the British navy, foresaw, in the early valour of this beloved nephew, the glory of a Vernon or a Rodney. The Diomede had received sailing orders; Lord Robert, in high spirits, and joyful expectation of future triumphs, was in one of his happiest humours, when a boat from a tender came alongside the Diomede, with a supply of pressed men to recruit the ship's company.",receive transport ornament british navy foresee early valour beloved nephew glory receive sailing order high spirit joyful expectation future triumph happy humour boat tender come supply press man recruit ship company 
48,"""Summers, are you ill?"" asked a young officer, with whom Lord Robert was gaily conversing; when a sudden alteration became observable in his voice and manner, and his cheek was overspread with a deadly paleness. Lord Robert did not hear him, being wholly occupied in watching the progress of a young sailor up the ship's side.",summer ill ask young officer convers sudden alteration become observable voice manner cheek overspread deadly paleness hear occupy watch progress young sailor ship side 
49,"Lieutenant Cary repeated the question, but received no answer; and, supposing that Lord Robert was troubled with one of his occasional fits of patrician haughtiness, and being to the full as high-spirited as himself, left him to his contemplations. These were of no pleasant nature; for though emaciated, ragged, and dirty, and in many respects different from the handsome youth he had lately seen, the young sailor (who by this time stood on the deck of the Diomede) was Philip Harley! He now felt that his dislike and abhorrence had arisen to a more intolerable degree than ever; he fretted at the perverse accident that had thrown this hated object in his way, and actually proceeded some paces to request his uncle to remove Philip Harley from the ship; but then he recollected that he should most likely be forced to enter into particulars that he detested to recall, besides giving his enemy reason to suppose that the presence or absence of so abject a creature could be of the least consequence to him.",repeat question receive answer suppose trouble occasional fit patrician haughtiness full high spirit leave contemplation pleasant nature emaciated ragged dirty many respect different handsome youth see young sailor time stand deck feel dislike abhorrence arise intolerable degree fret perverse accident throw hate object way proceed pace request uncle remove ship recollect force enter particular detest recall give enemy reason suppose presence absence abject creature least consequence 
50,"""No,"" said he to himself, ""let him remain; he will, in the discipline of a man-of-war, be cured perhaps of his audacity, and learn submission to proper authority."" This was the result of Lord Robert's debate with himself. At first, he had been a little touched by Philip's pale and altered countenance; but, on a second glance, he found his enemy had recognised him, and returned his glance with a look so full of reproach and contempt, that Lord Robert vowed within himself that his haughty spirit should be broken.",say let remain discipline man war cure audacity learn submission proper authority result debate little touch pale alter countenance second glance find enemy recognise return glance look full reproach contempt vow haughty spirit break 
51,"Alas, for Philip! he needed no worse enemy than himself. Instead of a manly resignation to what he knew was unavoidable, and a determination to perform his duties so well as to gain respect from the crew--instead of pursuing this course, which would have partly defeated the hatred of his enemy,--he continued so sullen and contrary, that no means, whether good or bad, could bring him out of his fits of obstinacy. There needed no interference of Lord Robert's to bring on him the most severe and cruel punishments. But no bodily pain could subdue Philip; disgrace and suffering only rendered him furious and desperate; and he was considered mutinous and ungovernable to such a degree, that he passed the first three months of a seafaring life in a succession of confinement and punishment.",need bad enemy manly resignation know unavoidable determination perform duty gain respect crew pursue course defeat hatred enemy continue sullen contrary means good bad bring fit obstinacy need interference bring severe cruel punishment bodily pain subdue disgrace suffering render furious desperate consider mutinous ungovernable degree pass first month seafare life succession confinement punishment 
52,"Had young Harley, instead of such headstrong conduct, exerted his real abilities as a seaman, applied himself to his profession, and shown his officers and commanders, that, though a mere youth, he could hand, reef, and steer, as well as the most experienced seaman,--and this, added to the sober and moral conduct natural to him, with an education and manners far above his station in life, joined to a stout and active body, and undaunted courage;--these qualifications would have created respect in every one, and in no one more than his just and upright commander; and his persecutor must have exposed his motives before he could have injured him: _now_ he was fully in his power, and Lord Robert vowed that he should most submissively implore his pardon for all his transgressions, before he should find any mercy.",have young such headstrong conduct exert real ability seaman apply profession show officer commander mere youth hand reef steer experience seaman add sober moral conduct natural education manners station life join stout active body undaunted courage qualification create respect one more upright commander persecutor expose motive injure power vow implore pardon transgression find mercy 
53,"""I can't tell what to make of that lad,"" said Lieutenant Cary to Lord Robert, as the boatswain was untying Harley from a gun, where he had borne, with Spartan firmness, the infliction of a cruel punishment, which his wilful disobedience had brought on him: ""he neither drinks nor swears, nor associates with the more dissolute part of the crew: but we have more trouble with him than with the most abandoned reprobate. Yet he seems to me to be meant for better things.""",tell make lad say boatswain unty gun borne firmness infliction cruel punishment wilful disobedience bring drink swear associate dissolute part crew have more trouble abandon reprobate seem mean good thing 
54,"Cary said this as a sort of encouragement to the unfortunate youth, whose manly endurance of extreme suffering had touched his heart.",say sort encouragement unfortunate youth manly endurance extreme suffering touch heart

62,"At this period, the ship and her convoy were approaching the coast of Brazil; they had hitherto enjoyed a prosperous voyage, with fair winds and weather, and a healthy passage. The Diomede was destined to convoy a fleet of merchant-ships bound for the Portuguese settlement of Rio de Janeiro. Before they neared the Brazilian shore, they descried a sail, which proved to be a French man-of-war, of nearly equal strength with their own. Scarcely had the Diomede recognised her for an enemy, before another sail appeared, which was soon known to be her consort. These ships had been stationed to intercept our richly-freighted merchantmen. The defenceless merchant-ships dispersed in every direction, leaving the valiant Diomede to bear the thunders of the unequal combat. This engagement was a fortunate circumstance for the unhappy Harley. I believe it is a usual thing for seamen under confinement for mutiny to be released before an engagement: however this may be, Philip was set at liberty, by the orders of the Captain.",period ship convoy approach coast enjoy prosperous voyage fair wind weather healthy passage destine convoy fleet merchant ship bind portuguese settlement near brazilian shore descry sail prove french man war equal strength own have recognise enemy sail appear know consort ship station intercept freight merchantmen defenceless merchant ship disperse direction leave valiant bear thunder unequal combat engagement fortunate circumstance unhappy believe usual thing seamen confinement mutiny release engagement set liberty order

65,"By this time the decks were cleared; and, everything being prepared for action on both sides, the Frenchmen approached pretty close. During the awful pause, while this unequal force bore down upon them, perhaps even some of the boldest hearts felt a chill of anxiety; for they were not fighting now for wealth or conquest, but for life, liberty, and the honour of their flag,--that flag which they had borne in triumph round half the world, and which had never yet been lowered to a foe. True, the odds against them were tremendous; but they were British seamen, and would not doubt the result. Yet there was the heart of one amongst them that throbbed high with desperate ardour for the combat, with the hope of redeeming disgrace, and showing that he was worthy a better fate than the death of a felon.",time deck clear prepare action side approach close awful pause unequal force bear bold heart feel chill anxiety fight wealth conquest life liberty honour flag flag borne triumph world lower foe true odd tremendous british seamen doubt result be heart throbb high desperate ardour combat hope redeem disgrace show worthy good fate death felon

About two in the morning, the wind lulled, and they flattered themselves that the gale was breaking. Soon after, there was much thunder and lightning, with rain; when it began to blow strong in gusts of wind, which obliged them to haul up the main-sail, the ship being then under bare poles. This was scarcely done, when a gust of wind, exceeding everything of the kind they had ever any conception of, laid the ship on her beam-ends. The water forsook the hold and appeared between the decks, so as to fill the men's hammocks to leeward; the ship lay motionless, and to all appearance irrecoverably overset. The water increasing fast, the captain gave directions to cut away the main and mizen masts,[1] hoping, when the ship righted, to wear her. The mizen-mast went first, without the smallest effect on the ship. The main-mast followed; and they had the mortification to see the foremast and bow-sprit follow also. The ship, upon this, immediately righted, but with great violence; and the motion was so quick, that it was difficult for the people to work the pumps.",midnight ship spring much water hand oblige spell pump morning wind lull flatter gale break be much thunder lightning rain begin blow strong gust wind oblige haul main sail ship bare pole do gust wind exceed kind have conception lay ship beam end water forsook hold appear deck fill man hammock leeward ship lay motionless appearance overset water increase captain give direction cut main mizen mast hope ship right wear mizen mast go small effect ship main mast follow have mortification see foremast bow sprit follow ship right great violence motion quick difficult person work pump

The masts had not been over the side ten minutes, before the tiller broke short in the rudder-head; and before the checks could be placed, the rudder itself was gone. Thus they were as much disastered as possible, lying at the mercy of the wind.

At this time it was observed that the water had not a passage to the well; all the rum (twenty-six puncheons), all the provisions in casks, were stove; having floated with violence from side to side, until there was not a whole cask remaining: even the staves, that were found upon clearing the hold, were most of them broken in two or three pieces. In the fore-hold they had the prospect of perishing. Should the ship swim, they had no water but what remained in the ground tier; and over this all the wet provisions in barrels were floating, with so much motion, that no man could go into the hold without the risk of his life. There was nothing left, but to try baling with buckets at the fore-hatchway and fish-room; and twelve large canvas buckets were immediately employed in each. On opening the fish-room, they were so fortunate as to discover that two puncheons of rum had escaped.

However, the water by noon had considerably diminished by working the buckets; but there appeared no prospect of saving the ship, if the gale continued. The labour was too great to hold out without water, yet the people worked without a murmur, and, indeed, with cheerfulness. But their sufferings for want of water were very great, and many of them could not be restrained from drinking salt water. They fired many guns of distress, in hopes some of the merchant-ships might approach and give them some supply; but on the beginning of the storm they had run before the wind, and made some port on the coast of Brazil,--an example which the Diomede would have been glad to follow before the hurricane began, but her crippled state from the engagement rendered this impossible.",find account bale spare pump put fore hatchway pump shift fish room motion ship wash coal small reach part ship pump choke water noon diminish work bucket appear prospect save ship gale continue labour great hold water person work murmur cheerfulness suffering want water great many restrain drink salt water fire many gun distress hope merchant ship approach give supply beginning storm run wind make port coast example glad follow hurricane begin crippled state engagement render impossible

The captain divided the ship's company, with the officers attending them, into parties, to raise the jury foremast, to heave overboard the lower deck guns,[3] to clear the wrecks of the fore and after holds, to prepare a machine for steering the ship, and to work the pumps.

He seemed to think the benign looks of Sir Henry Stanley, ever bent with peculiar complacency on those who performed their duties with manly firmness, were a reward for the most painful exertions. All the officers, indeed, noticed the altered conduct of the young mutineer: no traces remained of his former rebellion, except that of his returning the haughty glances of Lord Robert Summers with equal fierceness, when they chanced to meet in the performance of their arduous duties. But nothing could induce him to return the taunts this young officer sometimes bestowed on him with disrespectful language. Depending on the justice of his captain, he bore all in unmoved silence; indeed, his Lordship (who considered Philip as too much his inferior to give him the opportunity of joining in a warfare of words) never condescended to address any provoking speeches _to_ him, but always _at_ him. One would have thought that such frightful circumstances would have tamed the haughtiest minds; but they both required still severer trials to wring the black spot from their hearts.",time peril hardship help observe satisfaction alter conduct young active enterprising courageous difficulty overcome hardship make complain seem think benign look bend peculiar complacency perform duty manly firmness reward painful exertion officer notice alter conduct young mutineer trace remain former rebellion return haughty glance equal fierceness chance meet performance arduous duty induce return taunt young officer bestow disrespectful language depend justice captain bear unmoved silence consider much inferior give opportunity join warfare word condescend address provoke speech think such frightful circumstance tame haughtiest mind require severer trial wring black spot heart 
97,"The ship, in this perilous state, was in the middle of the great Atlantic, nearly under the equinoctial line, with the water-casks beat to pieces, and most of the provisions spoiled; so that if, by especial providence, the ship should swim, so as to reach a port on the Brazilian coast, the crew would suffer the most cruel hardships from thirst--painful at all times, but intolerable in these burning latitudes. In this dilemma, some of the people descried land; and they hoped it was one of those small islands on which the Portuguese have little settlements to supply their ships, which trade to Africa, with water and needful refreshments. This island, like those of St. Helena and Ascension, appeared rocky and volcanic; but there were good hopes that springs of water might be discovered on it, if any of the crew could be found enterprising enough to effect a landing, with such a sea, and on such a coast; for, though the gale had lulled, the breakers were furiously high on the shore.",ship perilous state middle great equinoctial line water cask beat piece most provision spoiled especial ship swim reach port brazilian coast crew suffer cruel hardship thirst painful time intolerable burn latitude dilemma person descry land hope small island have little settlement supply ship trade water needful refreshment island appear rocky volcanic be good hope spring water discover crew find enterprise effect landing sea coast gale lull breaker high shore

Three of the most experienced seamen offered to man the boat; but five hands were indispensable. His Lordship said that he himself would steer the boat, if one more seaman would venture. Philip Harley volunteered his assistance. ""Any one but him!"" muttered Lord Robert between his shut teeth, incensed that Philip should show that his courage was equal to his own: however, as his services were offered for the public good, he thought proper, although very unwillingly and ungraciously, to accept them, and the boat was lowered. Sir Henry Stanley bade adieu to his gallant nephew with pain; but he did not attempt to withhold him, dear as he was, from the benefit he was proposing to render the ship's company. When the boat got among the breakers, the prospect of landing appeared so hazardous, that one of the oldest of the seamen, who rowed the boat, proposed returning to the ship. Lord Robert, considering himself accountable for the lives of the men under his care, would not insist on their continuing their efforts, but said:",dare ardent prefer danger linger agony thirst volunteer command boat crew venture guidance experienced seamen offer man boat hand indispensable say steer boat more seaman venture volunteer assistance one mutter shut tooth incense show courage equal own service offer public good think proper accept boat lower bid adieu gallant nephew pain attempt withhold dear benefit propose render ship company boat get breaker prospect landing appear hazardous old seamen row boat propose return ship consider accountable life man care insist continue effort say

100,"The sailors then determined to persevere, their recent sufferings from thirst being fresh in their minds. At length, by a desperate effort, they gained the shore, and landed their water-casks. They soon found a pure spring, which gushed from a rocky hill at some little distance from the shore: there was a large wooden cross erected on an eminence, at the spring head; but they found no Portuguese guard at the spring, which is usual in a settlement in those latitudes; so they presumed the island was uninhabited. The land seemed barren, rocky, and desolate; but, after some research, they found, in a sheltered valley, a few fine lime and cocoa-nut trees, which had evidently been planted by some beneficent navigator. Gathering cocoa-nuts is no very easy operation, as they adhere in close bunches to the crown of the tree by tough ligaments; but as young Harley had brought his axe and saw to cut wood for firing, he climbed the trees, while his comrades were filling the water-casks, and expeditiously obtained a good number, both of limes and cocoa-nuts, which he considered would be an acceptable refreshment to his exhausted companions on board the Diomede.",sailor determine persevere recent suffering thirst fresh mind length desperate effort gain shore land water cask find pure spring gush rocky hill little distance shore be large wooden cross erect eminence spring head find portuguese guard spring usual settlement latitude presume island uninhabited land seem barren rocky desolate research find shelter valley few fine lime cocoa nut tree plant beneficent navigator gather cocoa nut easy operation adhere close bunch crown tree tough ligament young bring axe see cut wood fire climb tree comrade fill water cask obtain good number lime cocoa nut consider acceptable refreshment exhaust companion board

Their fate was beheld from the ship; but no aid could be given, as the renewed hurricane had rendered her state more deplorable than ever: she was driven before the wind, and soon lost sight of this fatal island.",sailor hurry water cask store fruit boat launch breaker infinite toil get surf safety wind blow shore furious gust come moment increase strength last surge rise such overwhelming violence spite effort boat upset unhappy crew engulf roar water fate beheld ship aid give renew hurricane render state deplorable drive wind lose sight fatal island

These speedily sank; but Lord Robert, being young and robust, strove hard for life, and at length gained the shore, almost exhausted by his contentions with the surfy breakers. When he had a little recovered his breath, he climbed the hill on which the cross was erected, and gazed towards the ship, which he saw driving before the wind, surrounded by foaming billows, and with every appearance of speedily sharing the fate he had so lately escaped. Wholly occupied in the thoughts of the revered friend that ship contained, he forgot his own desolate state, till the last appearance of the ship vanished, and he found himself alone.",boat crew struggle little time wave old man exhaust fatigue undergone sink young robust strive life length gain shore exhaust contention surfy breaker have little recover breath climb hill cross erect gaze ship see drive wind surround foaming billow appearance share fate escape occupy thought rever friend ship contain forget own desolate state last appearance ship vanish find alone

It was a night of peculiar horror--tempestuous, dark, and rainy; and Lord Robert, though in a state of complete exhaustion, found that, in his late struggle with the breakers, he had received so many bruises, that to sleep was impossible. At intervals, as the lightning gleamed on the stormy expanse of waters before him, he thought how many of his brave companions, in all probability, slept beneath its roaring waves; and at that moment, instead of returning thanks to Heaven for his own preservation, he felt inclined to envy his comrades. To be entirely shut out from all intercourse with his fellow-creatures, never again to hear the sound of a human voice, and to be condemned, in the very bloom of youth, to pine away existence in that desolate place, far from every friend, appeared a doom so dreadful, that he was insensibly led to reflect for what crime so heavy a punishment could have befallen him.",situation pass night succeed dismal day night peculiar horror tempestuous dark rainy state complete exhaustion find late struggle breaker receive many bruise sleep impossible interval lightning gleam stormy expanse water think many brave companion probability sleep roar wave moment return thanks own preservation feel inclined envy comrade shut intercourse fellow creature hear sound human voice condemn very bloom youth pine existence desolate place friend appear doom dreadful lead reflect crime heavy punishment befall

108,"For some time, he pursued his melancholy walk, interrupted only by the dismal sight of pieces of wreck, which the impetuous waves from time to time dashed at his feet. The sea now running in high tide on the shore, inspired him with the hope of seeing the pinnace and boats, or rafts from the wreck; and that some, at least, of the ship's company might be so fortunate as to reach the island with life. The sun, rising brightly over the stormy ocean, discovered something struggling with the waves at no great distance. Lord Robert felt the most agonizing sensations at the idea that it was out of his power to render any assistance. All he could do was to wave his handkerchief, from the little rocky promontory on which he stood, and to shout with all his strength, to encourage him in his efforts. At that moment, a tremendous wave engulfed the object of his solicitude,--it sank, and his heart sank with it;--again it rose and neared the shore;--but its efforts grew fainter and fainter;--and Lord Robert, fearing that its strength would fail, though so near the shore, regardless of his own safety, dashed through the breakers to render his assistance, cheering as he did so. At the sound of his voice, the poor creature appeared to recover his strength, and, struggling through the breakers, sprang towards him with a joyful cry.",time pursue melancholy walk interrupt dismal sight piece wreck impetuous wave time time dash foot sea run high tide shore inspire hope see pinnace boat raft wreck least ship company fortunate reach island life sun rise stormy ocean discover struggle wave great distance feel agonizing sensation idea power render assistance do wave handkerchief little rocky promontory stand shout strength encourage effort moment tremendous wave engulf object solicitude sink heart sink rise near shore effort grow fainter fainter fear strength fail shore own safety dash breaker render assistance cheer do sound voice poor creature appear recover strength struggle breaker spring joyful cry 
109,"""Ah, my poor Neptune! Is it you?"" exclaimed Lord Robert, with mingled anguish and pleasure, as he threw his arms round the faithful animal, and gave vent to his feelings with a burst of tears. ""Yes!"" said he, as he threw himself on the beach in bitter sorrow, ""the Diomede must indeed have foundered, or my kind, my benevolent uncle, would never have committed this old memorial of his lost nephew to the mercy of the waves, for the sake of lightening the vessel, or saving the morsel of food he would have consumed."" But again remembering the chance that some of the crew might be saved by the pinnace, and condemning the indulgence of his grief, he rose, and, dripping as he was, pursued his search, attended by his faithful Neptune, who bounded round him with joyful affection. In the course of his walk, he found some limes and cocoa-nuts scattered on the beach; and, yielding to the painful thirst that consumed him, he raised one of the limes to his parched lips, when he recollected that they were some of the fruit young Harley had gathered, and was carrying to the ship at the time the boat was upset, and the unfortunate youth had been buried in the waves. This thought recalled the bitter reflections he had with difficulty succeeded in banishing from his mind; and when he remembered that, though he had not been the immediate, he had certainly been the ultimate cause of his death, he sickened at the thought, and casting the untasted fruit from him, he said, ""No; I cannot eat these!"" Proceeding on his walk, he gained the spot where he had landed with his unfortunate companions the day before. He sighed deeply as he passed it; and, doubling a projection of rock, he discovered the pinnace, floating bottom upwards close in shore. At that sight, the most agonizing in the world to the heart of a sailor, he turned away, and wept almost to suffocation. For some moments, he continued to give way to the grief which oppressed him, till roused from the indulgence of his feelings by a loud and joyful bark from Neptune, and, uncovering his eyes, he perceived a young sailor, whose face was turned from him, gazing on the pinnace, apparently in as melancholy a mood as himself. This doubtless was the only one of her unfortunate crew who had escaped the violence of the waves; and Lord Robert, losing all distinction of rank in the fellowship of misfortune, sprang towards him with open arms, exclaiming, in a voice broken by emotion--""What cheer, my lad?"" At the sound of his voice, the young man turned slowly round, and discovered a face pale with contending feelings--it was Philip Harley! For a moment, the two enemies surveyed each other in silence; each wondering at the other's preservation; each somewhat softened by the traces of sorrow and suffering in the countenance of the other,--but, alas! each mutually yielding to the same stubborn and haughty temper which had so long been the spring of all that was evil in their separate characters, they surveyed each other with a look of defiance, and walked gloomily away in opposite directions.",poor exclaim mingle anguish pleasure throw arm faithful animal give vent feeling burst tear say throw beach bitter sorrow founder kind benevolent uncle commit old memorial lose nephew mercy wave sake lighten vessel save morsel food consume remember chance crew save pinnace condemn indulgence grief rise drip pursue search attend faithful bound joyful affection course walk find lime cocoa nut scatter beach yield painful thirst consume raise lime parched lip recollect fruit young gather carry ship time boat upset unfortunate youth bury wave thought recall bitter reflection have difficulty succeed banish mind remember immediate ultimate cause death sicken thought cast untasted fruit say eat proceed walk gain spot land unfortunate companion day sigh pass double projection rock discover pinnace float bottom close shore sight agonizing world heart sailor turn goot suffocation moment continue give way grief oppress rouse indulgence feeling loud joyful bark uncover eye perceive young sailor face turn gaze pinnace melancholy mood only one unfortunate crew escape violence wave lose distinction rank fellowship misfortune spring open arm exclaim voice break emotion cheer lad sound voice young man turn discover face pale contend feeling moment enemy survey other silence wonder other preservation soften trace sorrow suffering countenance other yield same stubborn haughty temper spring evil separate character survey other look defiance walk opposite direction 
110,"Lord Robert certainly did feel his heart relieved of half the painful emotions which had, for the last ten hours, oppressed it almost to bursting; and as he retraced his steps almost instinctively to his cheerless chamber in the rock, where he had spent that dreadful night, he exclaimed, ""Thank God, he lives! I am not then his murderer! It is true, that entire solitude would have been much more agreeable to me, than the idea of breathing the same air with him, and being constantly exposed to the chance of meeting him; but that is more than compensated by the knowledge that he lives, and is, indeed, no worse off than myself.""",feel heart relieve painful emotion last hour oppress burst retrace step cheerless chamber rock spend dreadful night exclaim thank live murderer true entire solitude agreeable idea breathe same air expose chance meet more compensate knowledge live bad 
111,"Thus did Lord Robert compose his troubled thoughts, and lull to sleep those better feelings which almost prompted him, at the first sight of young Harley, to make such advances towards amity, as would have been pleasing in the sight of God, and even in that of his enemy, whose heart, naturally kind and good, had been greatly softened by the awful circumstances under which their last interview had taken place. Besides, he had been an unseen spectator of Lord Robert's manly but acute sorrow, when he beheld, in the deplorable situation of the pinnace, a confirmation of his worst fears respecting the fate of his uncle and friends. He, too, had been weeping; for he reverenced Sir Henry Stanley, and loved Lieutenant Cary; and he was disposed to behold even Lord Robert with complacency, for their sakes; for he knew he was very dear to them both; and when he saw the agony with which Lord Robert staggered forward, on reaching the spot which commanded this melancholy sight, and heard his repeated sobs, he felt his hatred towards him so much diminished, that he was forced to recollect all the injuries he had received from this young officer, before he could sufficiently repel the inclination he felt to speak to him in the voice of kindness and comfort. Lord Robert had hitherto appeared to him haughty, rude, and unfeeling; and Philip knew not that this spoiled child of prosperity possessed at times much sensibility, strong affections, and feelings, which, had they been properly directed, would have been conducive to the happiness of all around him; instead of which, his unchecked passions produced danger and inconvenience to all who, even unintentionally, irritated them, and misery to their unhappy possessor, far beyond what he had ever inflicted on others.",compose troubled thought lull sleep good feeling prompt first sight young make such advance amity pleasing sight enemy heart kind good soften awful circumstance last interview take place unseen spectator manly acute sorrow beheld deplorable situation pinnace confirmation bad fear respect fate uncle friend weep reverence love dispose behold complacency sake know dear see agony stagger reach spot command melancholy sight hear repeat sob feel hatred diminish force recollect injury receive young officer repel inclination feel speak voice kindness comfort appear haughty rude unfeeling know spoiled child prosperity possess time much sensibility strong affection feeling direct conducive happiness unchecked passion produce danger inconvenience irritate misery unhappy possessor inflict other 
112,"But Philip was in many respects too like his adversary in character; and he never took the trouble of asking his own heart, if he were not sometimes to blame, as well as his high-born enemy. If Lord Robert was haughty, Philip was insolent; if one was hasty in giving a provocation, the other was still more so in retaliating. Had Philip for one moment remembered that most divine maxim of holy writ, ""A soft answer turneth away wrath,"" and had he been sufficiently of a Christian disposition to practise it in _one_ instance only, Lord Robert would have been appeased; and what mischief might have been spared, what suffering avoided, on one side! and what painful remorse on the other! When Philip beheld Lord Robert's tears, his first emotion was surprise; and he said to himself, ""Can he weep? _he_ that is so hard-hearted and proud!"" and then the thought occurred to him, ""Perhaps his heart is not so very hard as I have reason to believe?"" Philip was not uncandid; and he remembered then, that he had often thrown himself in Lord Robert's way, and committed many outrages, on purpose to provoke him. For the first time in his life, he put himself in his Lordship's place, and asked his own heart, whether he were sure, under such circumstances, that he should have acted better? But Philip was not yet sufficiently acquainted with the faults of his own character, to see that he had been almost equally blameable; and though, perhaps, he would not have refused to forgive, he had no idea that _he too_ required to be forgiven, if not by his erring fellow-creature, at least by his heavenly Father. Had _this_ occurred to him, he would not have renewed their suspended enmity, by being the first to assume a look of defiance, while Lord Robert was undecided what course to pursue: but the favourable moment was unfortunately lost; for Lord Robert returned the glance with equal disdain, and they were as much at variance as before.",many respect adversary character take trouble ask own heart blame high bear enemy haughty insolent hasty give provocation other retaliate have moment remember divine maxim holy writ soft answer turneth wrath christian disposition practise instance appease mischief spare suffering avoid side painful remorse other beheld tear first emotion surprise say weep hard hearted proud thought occur heart hard have reason believe uncandid remember throw way commit many outrage purpose provoke first time life put place ask own heart sure such circumstance act good acquainted fault own character see blameable refuse forgive have idea too_ require forgive err fellow creature least heavenly occur renew suspend enmity first assume look defiance undecided course pursue favourable moment lose return glance equal disdain much variance 
113,"Lord Robert had returned to the cleft in the rock, and thrown himself at full length, lost in unpleasant and bitter reflections for some hours, before the cravings of hunger reminded him that it was necessary to make some exertion for the preservation of that life which Heaven had spared; but perhaps he would, in his gloomy frame of mind, have disregarded his own wants, and remained obstinate in his self-neglect, had not the mute appeals of his faithful Neptune roused him from inertion. Neptune was a fine water-dog, a present from his elder brother at parting; and Lord Robert, who had long desired to possess this animal, treated him with the most unbounded affection; and always suffered him to share every meal with him, and even divided with him his share of food and water during their late dreadful privations; and Neptune, who had not tasted food for many hours, continued to put his paws on his master's knees, and to survey him with a wishful look, till Lord Robert rose, and left the cave in search of something to satisfy his cravings. Amongst his other troubles, he had little fear of perishing by famine; for he knew, by the latitude he was in, that he should most likely find turtle, or turtles' eggs, on the beach. In fact, while he was listlessly pacing the shore, thinking of anything rather than the object of his search, Neptune, who was not quite so uninterested, pounced on something in a hole in the sand, which proved to be a fine turtle. His master soon killed it, and satisfied the hunger of his humble friend with part of the flesh; and then, in a more leisurely manner, set about collecting pieces of wreck to make a fire; but, alas! he was wholly unpractised in the sleight of striking a few sparks to kindle a flame. It is true, he knew how they were to be procured, and soon found a flint proper for the purpose: but in striking it with the back of his knife, he only rubbed the skin off his hands, and bruised his knuckles, without producing the desired effect; or, if he did elicit a few sparks, they died away for want of proper kindling. This put him in a passion, and he redoubled his violence till he broke the flint into a thousand pieces; and sat down in a very ill humour, looking at his pile of wood and his raw turtle with much discontent. At last he recollected, that if he could not cook his turtle, he could quench his thirst at the clear spring they had discovered on their first landing: this he soon found, and was much refreshed by a draught from it. At a small distance, within view of the spring, he saw the little grove of limes and cocoas in the valley; there he beheld, with some little envy, a bright blazing fire, near which Philip was employed cooking his supper. He hastily avoided the spot, and returned to the beach, where he found in the sand some turtles' eggs, which he could eat raw, and with them satisfied the calls of hunger. He then lay down on his flinty couch, with Neptune for a pillow; and, being completely exhausted by fatigue, notwithstanding his distress and discontent, sank into a profound sleep.",return cleft rock throw full length lose unpleasant bitter reflection hour craving hunger remind necessary make exertion preservation life spare gloomy frame mind disregard own want remain obstinate self neglect mute appeal faithful rouse inertion fine water dog present elder brother parting desire possess animal treat unbounded affection suffer share meal divide share food water late dreadful privation taste food many hour continue put paw master knee survey wishful look rise leave cave search satisfy craving other trouble have little fear perish famine know latitude find turtle turtle egg beach fact pace shore think object search uninterested pounce hole sand prove fine turtle master kill satisfy hunger humble friend part flesh leisurely manner set collect piece wreck make fire unpractise sleight strike few spark kindle flame true know procure find flint proper purpose strike back knife rub skin hand bruise knuckle produce desire effect elicit few spark die want proper kindling put passion redoubl violence break flint piece sit ill humour look pile wood raw turtle much discontent last recollect cook turtle quench thirst clear spring discover first landing find refresh draught small distance view spring see little grove lime cocoa valley beheld little envy bright blaze fire employ cook supper avoid spot return beach find sand turtle egg eat raw satisfy call hunger lay flinty couch pillow exhaust fatigue notwithstand distress discontent sink profound sleep 
114,"The next morning saw him still perplexed with those minor difficulties. For though he could bear, with heroic self-denial, the hardships incidental to his profession, and had not taken a morsel more food, or a drop more water, in their late distress on board ship, than any other of the suffering crew, and had even shared his scanty morsel with his famishing dog, this he _could_ do, for he felt there was something noble and refined in such conduct; but he felt sadly irritated at being thrown on his own resources in the little common everyday necessaries of life. From his infancy, he had been surrounded by servants, who were accustomed to perform for him the most minute services, so that at seventeen his Lordship (though a valiant officer, and perfect in his professional duties,) was ignorant of many things very necessary for every one to know; and if he was acquainted with the methods resorted to in many situations, he was at least very awkward in his attempts of putting them into practice. However, on this occasion, making use of his own good sense, after a little calm reflection, he collected from the sides of the rock some dry grey moss, and, drawing some rays from the sun in the focus of a little perspective glass he had in his pocket, he soon set his pile of wood in a blaze, and cooked sufficient turtle to feed him for a day or two.",next morning see perplex minor difficulty bear heroic self denial hardship incidental profession take morsel more food drop more water late distress board ship other suffering crew share scanty morsel famishing dog do feel be noble refine such conduct feel irritated throw own resource little common everyday necessary life infancy surround servant accustom perform minute service valiant officer perfect professional duty ignorant many thing necessary one know acquainted method resort many situation least awkward attempt put practice occasion make use own good sense little calm reflection collect side rock dry grey moss draw ray sun focus little perspective glass have pocket set pile wood blaze cook sufficient turtle feed day 
115,"He had scarcely completed this employment, when the sun, which had for days been shaded by tempestuous clouds, broke forth with its usual splendour; and there was promise of a continuance of that sultry weather so seldom interrupted in these latitudes. Lord Robert, when he felt the sun beat on his uncovered temples, fled for shelter to his cave, which he found nearly of the same temperature as an oven half heated. Panting for breath, he remembered the grove, of which Philip had taken possession, and bent his steps towards it; but he found that this spot of verdure did not consist of more than a rood of land; and he did not choose to be so near young Harley as the farthest extremity of its shelter. So he remained on the burning beach, or under the shade of some arid rock, during the day, determining to make a tour of the island in the cool of the evening, and hoping to fix his residence in some shady vale similar to Philip's territories. But how can his disappointment be expressed, when, after a most fatiguing walk, all the good he gained was a knowledge of the extent of his prison? He had in vain searched for a grove; barren rocks and burning sands alone met his sight: at last, he climbed a conical hill, which towered above the other rocks, and which, from his geological knowledge, he was certain contained the exhausted crater of a volcano. Here he had a view of every nook of the island, which was of the extent of about five miles, and presented a prospect of one pile of horrid rocks heaped on another, without one spot of fertility, except Philip's little cluster of trees, whose bright verdure formed a refreshing contrast to the burning rocks, which seemed yet to glow with the intense heat that had been poured on them through the day. As he fixed his eyes wistfully on this favoured spot, and saw the smoke of Philip's evening fire curling above the trees, he exclaimed, ""Yes; I must, though most reluctantly, share this only habitable place with him; for such a day as the last I cannot endure again. Doubtless, this grove was planted by some benevolent navigator (such as I have often read of) on the soil formed by the accidental residence of sea-birds; and the grass and trees[4] have gradually spread over a small extent of land. Surely, as it was meant for universal benefit, I have a right to a share of it."" So saying, he descended the hill, and after a toilsome walk arrived at the grove after nightfall, where he enjoyed the luxury of stretching his aching limbs on the soft grass, under the fragrant shade of a lime-tree, and slept soundly till after sunrise. He awoke in the morning with the cheerful sound of a human voice singing, and on opening his eyes, saw Philip Harley, a few paces from him, busy at work. He was astonished to see the progress his enemy had made in forming himself a habitation; for he had got very forward in the frame-work of a neat hut, and was now boarding it in with planks, which he had collected on the beach, singing as he knocked in every nail. This hut was situated among the thickest cluster of trees, directly under a fine young vine, the only one in the island; and as Philip roofed his hut, he carefully trained the rich branches all over the dwelling, taking care not to injure the purpling fruit, which was nearly ripe; thus giving his hut, as soon as it was finished, the charming appearance of a bower.",complete employment sun have day shade tempestuous cloud break usual splendour be promise continuance sultry weather interrupt latitude feel sun beat uncover temple flead shelter cave find same temperature oven half heat pant breath remember grove take possession bend step find spot verdure consist more rood land choose young farthest extremity shelter remain burning beach shade arid rock day determine make tour island cool evening hope fix residence shady vale similar territory disappointment express fatiguing walk good gain knowledge extent prison vain search grove barren rock burning sand meet sight last climb conical hill tower other rock geological knowledge certain contain exhaust crater volcano have view nook island extent mile present prospect pile horrid rock heap spot fertility little cluster tree bright verdure form refresh contrast burn rock seem glow intense heat pour day fix eye favour spot see smoke evening fire curl tree exclaim share habitable place day last endure grove plant benevolent navigator such read soil form accidental residence sea bird grass tree spread small extent land mean universal benefit have right share say descend hill toilsome walk arrive grove nightfall enjoy luxury stretch ach limb soft grass fragrant shade lime tree sleep sunrise awoke morning cheerful sound human voice sing open eye see few pace busy work astonished see progress enemy make form habitation get frame work neat hut board plank collect beach sing knock nail hut situate thickest cluster tree fine young vine only one island roof hut train rich branch dwelling take care injure purple fruit ripe give hut finish charming appearance bower 
116,"[Footnote 4: The progress of vegetation is very curious in those islands, which are supposed by geologists to be thrown up from the bottom of the sea by volcanoes, or formed by the unceasing labours of the coral animalculi. These generally present at first a rocky surface, barren and arid. By degrees, a little soil is deposited by sea-fowl and birds of passage; on this at first grow the seeds of some of those minute plants, which are literally carried on the wings of the wind from countries that appear too far distant for any such conveyance. These plants flourish, fade, and are renewed by the seasons, until from their decayed parts is formed that fine vegetable mould which overspreads the more fertile surface of the earth. When this process is begun, if the land receives from the hand of some benevolent discoverer a few seeds of trees or plants to which the climate is congenial, the work of fertilization is rapidly accelerated; grass grows luxuriantly under the shade of the trees: verdure increases, and creeps farther and farther, till from one little spot, an oasis in the midst of a desert, the whole island becomes fruitful.]",footnote progress vegetation curious island suppose geologist throw bottom sea volcano form uncease labour coral animalculi present first rocky surface barren arid degree little soil deposit sea fowl bird passage first grow seed minute plant carry wing wind country appear distant such conveyance plant flourish fade renew season decay part form fine vegetable mould overspread fertile surface earth process begin land receive hand benevolent discoverer few seed tree plant climate congenial work fertilization accelerate grass grow shade tree verdure increase creep little spot oasis midst desert whole island become fruitful 
117,"Overcome by the heat of the climate, Lord Robert lay for a day or two wholly inactive, stretched beneath his lime-tree, amusing himself with playing with Neptune, or when he thought he was unperceived, watching the progress of his enemy's work, but not condescending to address one word to him; who, on his part, preserved the same sullen silence. Lord Robert could not help wondering how Harley came by the saw and hatchet which he handled with so much adroitness; but he would not condescend to ask him. The fact was, that when Philip and the sailors were called away from gathering the cocoas, Philip, in his hurry had left the saw and hatchet at the foot of the tree; and there he found them when he regained the land. Possessed of these treasures, he made himself a hammer of a hollow stone; and, drawing nails out of the wreck, he set to work, and soon completed his hut. But when he proceeded to make a stool and table, Lord Robert was moved to some exertion; for he thought, that if he could make himself something of the kind to place under his lime-tree, he should not regret the hut his adversary seemed so proud of; and he was determined to try to construct some such articles of comfort and convenience. He accordingly went to the beach, and soon collected timber, from which he selected pieces with which he meant to try to form a table and three-legged stool. He would willingly have worked on the beach, out of the impertinent ken of his enemy: but the intolerable heat soon drove him back to the delicious shade of the grove, where a perpetual breeze seemed to play amongst the leaves; and thither he reluctantly proceeded, carrying the wood, and followed by Neptune. Sorry I am to record, that when Philip saw his haughty enemy appear thus laden, he paused in his work with a malicious curiosity to see how Lord Robert would acquit himself in his new employment. The first thing he did was to tear a bough or two off a tree, meaning to cut three truncheons to form the legs of his stool. It was lignum vitæ wood, extremely hard; and Lord Robert eyed Philip's saw, which just then would have been of great service to him, but he disdained to ask the loan of it. So he seated himself on the turf, and began to cut the legs with his pocket-knife (his only tool) with great difficulty; then he chose from the fragments of wreck a small piece of square wood, and marked with his pencil the holes he designed to make; he then walked, in a very stately manner, to Philip's fire, and taking from thence three hot coals, he laid them on his pencilled marks, and kept renewing them till the wood was nearly burnt through; then he scraped through the burnt wood, till he had got three holes; into these he knocked his truncheons with a great stone, and placed his stool on the ground to admire his own ingenuity; but he had knocked one leg more and another less, so that their lengths were unequal, and down the stool fell. Philip, who had seen this defect all the time, was highly diverted at his disappointment, when the stool fell, particularly when he saw how it irritated Lord Robert's impatient temper. At last, overcoming his inclination to laugh, he said: ""You must shorten the middle leg of your stool, or it will never stand;"" at the same time pushing his rule and saw towards his Lordship, who rejected them with great disdain, saying--""Do you think that I can condescend to learn the low mechanic art of a _carpenter_?"" And he laid a most contemptuous stress on the word _carpenter_.",overcome heat climate lay day inactive stretch lime tree amusing play think unperceived watch progress enemy work condescending address word part preserve same sullen silence help wonder come saw hatchet handle much adroitness condescend ask fact sailor call gather cocoa hurry leave saw hatchet foot tree find regain land possess treasure make hammer hollow stone draw nail wreck set work complete hut proceed make stool table move exertion think make kind place lime tree regret hut adversary seem proud determined try construct such article comfort convenience go beach collect timber select piece mean try form table legged stool work beach impertinent ken enemy intolerable heat drive delicious shade grove perpetual breeze seem play leave proceed carry wood follow sorry record see haughty enemy appear laden pause work malicious curiosity see acquit new employment first thing do tear bough tree mean cut truncheon form leg stool lignum vitæ wood eye see great service disdain ask loan seat turf begin cut leg pocket knife only tool great difficulty choose fragment wreck small piece square wood mark pencil hole design make walk stately manner fire take hot coal lay pencil mark keep renew wood burn scrape burnt wood get hole knock truncheon great stone place stool ground admire own ingenuity knock leg more less length unequal stool fall see defect time divert disappointment stool fall see irritate impatient temper last overcome inclination laugh say shorten middle leg stool stand same time push rule see reject great disdain say think condescend learn low mechanic art _carpenter_ lay contemptuous stress word _carpenter_

119,"Lord Robert haughtily flung back the rule and saw, and began to shorten the leg with his knife. This was a work of time and difficulty: the wood was hard, and the knife unfit for the purpose, and, worse than all, Lord Robert was very awkward in his mechanical attempts; but he was unusually so in this, for he was in a pet, and he saw that Philip watched him and enjoyed his unskilful manoeuvres. This had the effect of enraging and confusing him; and, in his anger, the knife slipped and cut his knuckles across. He glanced at Philip, and saw him smile. This greatly provoked him, and he darted towards his enemy a furious look; but Philip continued to survey his operations with a calm but sarcastic regard. The next thing Lord Robert did was to set his knife so fast in the wood that he could not move it. Philip smiled again; and Lord Robert, out of all patience, used so violent an effort to get it free, that the blade snapped in the middle, and, starting up in a passion, he dashed the stool violently against the ground. Philip laughed aloud.",flung rule see begin shorten leg knife work time difficulty wood hard knife unfit purpose bad awkward mechanical attempt pet see watch enjoy unskilful manoeuvre have effect enraging confusing anger knife slip cut knuckle glance see smile provoke dart enemy furious look continue survey operation calm sarcastic regard next thing set knife wood move smile patience use violent effort get free blade snap middle start passion dash stool ground laugh

Basely and cruelly did you trample on me, when you knew that to resist the authority you abused was impossible. I _was_ your victim, but am so no longer!

124,"There was an expression so terrible in Philip's eyes as he spoke these words, that Lord Robert, stout-hearted as he was, (and there never was a braver officer,) changed colour; but in a moment recovering his intrepid spirit and haughty bearing, he flashed back a look of defiance, and assumed a posture of defence.",be expression terrible eye speak word stout hearted be brave officer change colour moment recover intrepid spirit haughty bear flash look defiance assume posture defence 
125,"""It is unnecessary,"" said Philip; ""I am not going to attack you. You have in many contests proved the strength of this arm: that it always was superior to yours, I scarcely need remind you.

127,"""Perhaps not,"" replied Philip; ""but I would advise you not to provoke me unnecessarily.""",reply advise provoke 
128,"So saying, he retired within his hut, leaving Lord Robert speechless with contending emotions. He was indeed much ruffled by the short but fierce altercation which had passed between himself and young Harley; and the more so, when he reflected that Philip's bodily strength was superior to his own, and that his high rank would be of no avail to him in this desolate place, as Philip had very unceremoniously told him: and as his own conscience whispered that he had formerly offered him the most dreadful provocation, he could scarcely be astonished if Philip, now that he was the more powerful, should meditate retaliation, and take, as he threatened, unbounded vengeance for all that he had suffered on board the Diomede and elsewhere.",say retire hut leave speechless contend emotion ruffle short fierce altercation pass young reflect bodily strength superior own high rank avail desolate place tell own conscience whisper offer dreadful provocation astonished powerful meditate retaliation take threaten unbound vengeance suffer board 
129,"He was reluctant to abandon this sheltered and beautiful spot; but he preferred returning to his dreary cleft in the rock, to residing in the valley, where Philip had erected his dwelling; considering the heat and barrenness of the rest of the island as far less evils than the company of Philip, whose very sight, after the threats he had used, was most intolerable to him: and Lord Robert felt that he could not bend his haughty spirit to practise the civility and moderation which Philip had recommended, lest this behaviour should be construed into fear of his superior force. On the other hand, he reflected that if he persisted in his natural imperiousness, so far as to provoke Philip to a personal contest with him, the languor incidental to the climate had so much enervated him, that, to maintain a combat with such an adversary as young Harley had often proved himself to be, with the slightest prospect of success, was impossible, and would only expose him to insult and contempt, and perhaps even to more disgraceful treatment, from his justly incensed enemy. To avoid such consequences, he judged it most suitable to his dignity to retire; and, whistling to Neptune to follow him, he slowly and sullenly returned to the beach, leaving Philip in uninterrupted possession of the Valley of Limes.",reluctant abandon shelter beautiful spot prefer return dreary cleft rock reside valley erect dwelling consider heat barrenness rest island less evil company very sight threat use intolerable feel bend haughty spirit practise civility moderation recommend behaviour construe fear superior force other hand reflect persist natural imperiousness provoke personal contest languor incidental climate enervate maintain combat adversary young prove slight prospect success impossible expose insult contempt disgraceful treatment incense enemy avoid such consequence judge suitable dignity retire whistle follow return beach leave uninterrupted possession 
130,"Though Philip, still smarting under the remembrance of the many injuries he had received from Lord Robert, had, on the haughty expressions of contempt uttered by that young officer, used threats which were most irritating to his proud spirit, he by no means designed to proceed to personal hostilities; for Philip was, in spite of all his faults, too really generous to exert in this instance the advantages his superior strength gave him; and he was far from intending to drive his companion in misfortune from the only spot in the island capable of affording him any of the comforts of life. In short, he expected that when Lord Robert had vented his displeasure in a solitary walk, he would return to the valley. When Philip's temper cooled, he began to reflect on the luxuries Lord Robert had been accustomed to from his cradle; he thought how severely his high-born adversary must feel the privations to which he was now exposed; and his heart smote him for having, by his provoking ridicule, occasioned that ebullition of feeling which had vented itself in expressions of wrathful contempt, which he, on his part, (not considering the provocation was of his own giving,) had been so ready to return; and that their mutual recriminations had induced him to utter menaces, which had driven his companion in misfortune from an employment necessary even for the preservation of his existence.",smart remembrance many injury receive haughty expression contempt utter young officer use threat irritating proud spirit means design proceed personal hostility spite fault generous exert instance advantage superior strength give intend drive companion misfortune only spot island capable afford comfort life short expect vent displeasure solitary walk return valley temper cool begin reflect luxury accustom cradle think high bear adversary feel privation expose heart smeat provoke ridicule occasion ebullition feeling vent expression wrathful contempt part consider provocation own give ready return mutual recrimination induce utter menace drive companion misfortune employment necessary preservation existence 
131,"Occupied by these thoughts, Philip often paused in his work, and looked round to see if Lord Robert had returned to the valley, and listened for his step with anxiety; but he did not come. Night arrived, and Philip did not see him reposing under his favourite lime-tree; and he felt out of humour with himself, for being the cause of keeping him away.",occupy thought pause work look see return valley listen step anxiety come night arrive see repose favourite lime tree feel humour cause keep 
132,"From some uneasy self-reproaches, he did not taste at night the calm repose which generally follows a day of labour; on the contrary, he felt that evening some of those painful feelings of remorse which had so often tortured Lord Robert, but which had never been experienced by himself before; and he now remembered that, though Lord Robert had ill-treated him, yet there _was_ a difference in their rank, and that it was brutal in him to threaten a high-spirited and elegant young man with personal violence when they were united in the same distress: and that Lord Robert's contemptuous expressions were caused by his laughter at that which was a serious misfortune to his high-born foe; namely, his want of skill in mechanics, and the mischance of breaking his knife, the loss of which was irreparable, and would perhaps deprive him, on some occasions, even of the means of procuring food.",uneasy self reproache taste night calm repose follow day labour contrary feel evening painful feeling remorse torture experience remember have ill treat _was_ difference rank brutal threaten high spirit elegant young man personal violence unite same distress contemptuous expression cause laughter serious misfortune high bear foe want skill mechanics mischance break knife loss irreparable deprive occasion means procure food 
133,"Philip would have repaired to the beach, to see what had become of Lord Robert; but he thought it probable that some new cause of offence might arise between them. However, in the afternoon, he had occasion to visit the beach to search for some pieces of wreck. When he reached the shore, he found there had been a very high tide the preceding night, and many articles were scattered on the sand; as staves, pieces of rope, and splinters from the mast. These Philip carefully collected, and placed above high-water mark, lest they should be washed to sea again. In the course of this important avocation, he approached the cave where Lord Robert had again taken up his residence: but he had been too busily engaged to think of him, till his eye was attracted by the flash of his epaulet in the evening sun; and he saw him, at a little distance, bending over some employment, in which he was too much occupied to perceive the approach of Philip, who was tempted to draw near enough to ascertain what it was that so deeply engaged his attention; but he did so somewhat cautiously, lest he should again give offence. He soon was near enough to discover that Lord Robert's employment was that of digging a grave in the sand, with a butt-stave, and near him lay the bodies of five seamen, which the high tide had washed on shore, close to the entrance of Lord Robert's cave. Philip felt a bitter pang as he gazed on the lifeless remains of his unfortunate messmates; and seizing another stave, he placed himself opposite to Lord Robert, and began to assist in the sad duty; but neither spoke.",repair beach see become think probable new cause offence arise afternoon have occasion visit beach search piece wreck reach shore find be high tide preced night many article scatter sand stave piece rope splinter mast collect place high water mark wash sea course important avocation approach cave take residence engage think eye attract flash epaulet evening sun see little distance bending employment occupy perceive approach tempt draw ascertain engage attention give offence discover employment digg grave sand butt stave lay body seamen high tide wash shore close entrance cave feel bitter pang gaze lifeless remains unfortunate messmate seize stave place opposite begin assist sad duty speak 
134,"One of the bodies was that of a midshipman, whom Lord Robert had loved; and as he now proceeded to place his remains in the narrow bed he had scooped for him with so much toil, his tears fell fast on the face of the deceased. When he attempted to raise him from the shingle, to lay him decently in the grave, the effort was too much for him. Philip immediately sprang forwards and assisted him, otherwise the corpse would have fallen from his grasp. He did not reject the aid of his foe; but he did not even glance at him in return. In silence they began their melancholy task; in silence they proceeded in it; and the moon had risen high and shone with splendour by the time they had dug the last grave, when unfortunately, as they placed the seaman in the ""house appointed for all living,"" Philip recognised his features: it was the boatswain of the Diomede! A crowd of agonizing feelings passed through Philip's breast, as he recollected that from this man's hand he had received such disgraceful punishment. He first turned pale, and then scarlet; and it recurred to his mind, that this person had only been the passive instrument obeying the orders of others.",body midshipman love proceed place remains narrow bed scoop much toil tear fall face decease attempt raise shingle lay grave effort much spring forward assist corpse fall grasp reject aid foe glance return silence begin melancholy task silence proceed moon rise high shine splendour time dig last grave place seaman house appoint living recognise feature boatswain crowd agonizing feeling pass breast recollect man hand receive such disgraceful punishment turn pale scarlet recurr mind person passive instrument obey order other 
135,"""It was thy malice, tyrant! that added this worst wrong to all the rest,"" thought he. True, he did not utter these words: but he regarded Lord Robert with a look, in which hatred and rage were but too visibly painted to escape his Lordship's observation, though he was ignorant of the cause of it; but he thought it shocking of Philip to take the opportunity of insulting him at such an awful time, particularly when he had condescended to _permit_ his assistance; and he returned Philip's indignant look in so disdainful a manner, that, scarcely conscious that he was the first himself to renew hostilities, Philip took fire, and provokingly reminded his Lordship ""that his haughty looks were useless, when directed to him; and he advised him to reserve them for those who cared for them, if he could find any such in the island.""",malice tyrant add bad wrong rest think true utter word regard look hatred rage paint escape observation ignorant cause think shocking take opportunity insult awful time condescend assistance return indignant look disdainful manner conscious first renew hostility take fire remind haughty look useless direct advise reserve care find such island 
136,"""To the full as many as will endure your low-bred insolence,"" returned Lord Robert with equal scorn. ""However, Mr. Harley, if I might condescend to speak to you in the language of entreaty, it would be to request the favour of your absence. You have taken possession of the only habitable spot in the island, and _I_ have not attempted to deprive you of it; and I think the least you can do, in return for my moderation, is to leave me undisturbed on my barren domain.""",full many endure low breed insolence return equal scorn condescend speak language entreaty request favour absence take possession only habitable spot island attempt deprive think least do return moderation leave undisturbed barren domain 
137,"""If all my security were the _moderation_ of Lord Robert Summers,"" replied Philip with a contemptuous laugh, ""I should be as soon driven from my dwelling here as I was forced from the home of my parents: but here I can, by the strength of my own right hand, maintain my rights; and whoever attempts to invade them, may chance to repent of his folly.""",security _moderation_ reply contemptuous laugh drive dwelling force home parent strength own right hand maintain right attempt invade chance repent folly 
138,"As Philip uttered this threat, he finished casting the last heap of sand on the boatswain's grave; on which, apparently exhausted with fatigue, Lord Robert had seated himself. The sight of these bodies had recalled the fate of his uncle, and he had been lately weeping bitterly; and when young Harley observed his tearful eyes, and the evident languor and despondency visible in his whole appearance, his conscience again smote him; he remembered what he had so lately suffered from self-reproach; and he reflected, that if he so much abused the mere bodily superiority his strength gave him, it was by no means wonderful that when Lord Robert possessed so much power, he should exert it when offended.",utter threat finish cast last heap sand boatswain grave exhaust fatigue seat sight body recall fate uncle weep young observe tearful eye evident languor despondency visible whole appearance conscience smeat remember suffer self reproach reflect abuse mere bodily superiority strength give means wonderful possess much power exert offend 
139,"He paused, and looked earnestly at Lord Robert. The moon shone brightly on his face; the flush of resentment had faded from it; and he looked so ill, and there was such an expression of hopeless dejection in his eyes, that Philip was greatly touched; and he even thought of apologizing to him for what he had lately said, and of entreating him to return with him to the Valley of Limes. While he yet hesitated, Lord Robert looked up, and waved his hand impatiently for him to be gone: and Philip, finding that the conquest of his own pride was too great an effort to be made at that time, retired to his home, self-condemned and unhappy.",pause look moon shine face flush resentment fade look ill be expression hopeless dejection eye touch think apologize say entreat return hesitate look wave hand gone find conquest own pride great effort make time retire home self condemn unhappy 
140,"Lord Robert continued sitting on the grave, in a listless attitude, leaning his head on his hand, almost unconscious that he was alone. The faintness and languor which had been for some time stealing on him, seemed so wholly overpowering, as even to take away the inclination of retorting Philip's last innuendo; but now, though the words still rang upon his ear, and he fully understood their meaning to comprise reproach, insult, and threat, either of which was sufficient to put his proud spirit in a flame, yet he was conscious of a growing confusion in his own mind, which seemed to prevent his forming a suitable reply; and, for the first time in his life, he found himself unwilling to continue the war of words. He felt an impatient desire of quiet; and, forgetful that Philip would most likely pay no attention to his mandate, he motioned for him to retire, with no little of his habitual air of superiority. Philip, however, _did_ obey in this instance. Lord Robert, after some minutes, raised his aching head from his hand, and, looking round to see if he were gone, uttered an expression of satisfaction at finding himself alone.",continue sit grave listless attitude lean head hand unconscious alone faintness languor time steal seem overpowering take inclination retort last innuendo word ring ear understand meaning comprise reproach insult threat sufficient put proud spirit flame conscious grow confusion own mind seem prevent form suitable reply first time life find unwilling continue war word feel impatient desire quiet forgetful pay attention mandate motion retire little habitual air superiority obey instance minute raise ach head hand look see gone utter expression satisfaction find 
141,"Lord Robert's naturally fine constitution had been greatly impaired since his residence in the island, by the pain of mind he had suffered from the loss of his uncle and friends, the remorse he felt for his numerous errors, joined to his discontent and impatience at being placed in a situation so uncongenial to all his former habits. Besides, he suffered from the hardships which he was forced to endure: sleeping on the flinty rock, or passing the night on the turf under the lime-tree--a most unhealthy practice--for the dews were very heavy, and, in common to all hot countries, very noxious to those who were exposed to their influence.",fine constitution impair residence island pain mind suffer loss uncle friend remorse feel numerous error join discontent impatience place situation uncongenial former habit suffer hardship force endure sleep flinty rock pass night turf lime tree unhealthy practice dew heavy common hot country noxious expose influence 
142,"He had lost his hat when the boat was overset; and, trivial as this loss may appear to the natives of a temperate climate, it was attended with very painful consequences to Lord Robert, on whose head the rays of the sun fell with unmitigated violence, and occasioned him the most acute headache whenever he was exposed to the noon-day heat. After his retreat from the Valley of Limes, he had for many hours paced the beach in a tumult of rage, with the perpendicular rays of a tropical sun darting on his uncovered head. The night he had passed without sleep; and, early in the morning, he found the remains of the unfortunate seamen. He was ill and feverish; and it was only by a strong effort that he so far overcame his painful languor as to attempt the necessary but mournful task of giving them burial.",lose hat boat overset trivial loss appear native temperate climate attend painful consequence head ray sun fall unmitigated violence occasion acute headache expose noon day heat retreat have many hour pace beach tumult rage perpendicular ray tropical sun dart uncover head night pass sleep morning find remains unfortunate seamen ill feverish strong effort overcame painful languor attempt necessary mournful task give burial 
143,"Notwithstanding the heat of the day, and the toilsome task he was engaged in, he experienced repeated fits of shivering; the burning rays of the sun pouring on his head, though they occasioned the most acute pain, failed to impart warmth to his frame. This was accompanied with so strong a disinclination to move, that he several times paused in the course of digging the first grave; and, yielding to the sickly lassitude which oppressed him, he retired to his cave; but that commanding a full view of the poor seamen, the dreadful sight roused him from his inactivity, and again he proceeded in his mournful work. He had scarcely completed digging one grave with great toil and pain, and was wondering how it would be possible for him, ill as he was, to go through the whole business of interment, when Philip appeared and afforded his powerful aid. This was too valuable to be rejected; and he felt grateful for the silent manner in which he tendered his assistance and worked by his side; and he was about to thank him for his services, when, on raising his head for that purpose, he caught the offensive look which has already been mentioned. Lord Robert, lost in his own sad thoughts, did not perceive the _reason_ of this. Had he, indeed, recognised the features of the boatswain in the person they were burying, perhaps the same idea might have occurred to him. But, after having interred his friend, he had sedulously averted his eyes from the faces of the dead. Ignorant, therefore, of Philip's motives for renewed indignation, he returned his hostile glance, and the second contention ensued.",heat day toilsome task engage experience repeat fit shiver burning ray sun pour head occasion acute pain fail impart warmth frame accompany strong disinclination move several time pause course digg first grave yield sickly lassitude oppress retire cave commanding full view poor seamen dreadful sight rouse inactivity proceed mournful work complete digg grave great toil pain wonder possible ill go whole business interment appear afford powerful aid valuable reject feel grateful silent manner tender assistance work side about thank service raise head purpose catch offensive look mention lose own sad thought perceive _reason_ recognise feature boatswain person bury same idea occur interre friend avert eye face dead ignorant motive renew indignation return hostile glance second contention ensue 
144,"The rest of the night Lord Robert passed in a sort of stupor, seated on the boatswain's grave; from which he felt unable to rise through extreme exhaustion. The first rays of the sun drove him for shelter to the cave. His thirst was excessive; and he had no means of allaying it, unless he proceeded either to the Valley of Limes or the spring of water. The remembrance of Philip induced him to prefer the latter; and thither, with some difficulty, he crept rather than walked. Having drank profusely, he filled a large shell for a supply in the cave; for he thought it probable he should never be able to perform another journey to the stream; and slowly and faintly returned to his comfortless dwelling in the rock. The chills of the preceding day had terminated in the burning heat of raging fever; and as he retraced his melancholy steps through the sand, which reflected the intolerable rays of the sun to his eyes, and surveyed the barren rocks and frightful basalts of which the island was composed, he with a bitter sigh recalled the verdure of his father's park, and the shades of his native groves which bounded that beautiful domain.",rest night pass sort stupor seat boatswain grave feel unable rise extreme exhaustion first ray sun drive shelter cave thirst excessive have means allay proceed spring water remembrance induce prefer latter difficulty creep walk drink fill large shell supply cave think probable able perform journey stream return comfortless dwelling rock chill preced day terminate burn heat rage fever retrace melancholy step sand reflect intolerable ray sun eye survey barren rock frightful basalt island compose bitter sigh recall verdure father park shade native grove bound beautiful domain 
145,"""But these,"" said Lord Robert, ""I shall never see again: I shall perish on this arid, frightful spot, without a living creature near who cares for me, except my poor Neptune!--And you, my tender mother, who are so benevolently solicitous to provide comforts for the sick poor, what would be your feelings, could you see your unhappy son stretched on this burning flint!"" continued he, as entering the rocky chamber, he sank exhausted on the floor. He thought his death was near; yet he felt far from being in a proper frame of mind to die. Like too many of the young and thoughtless, if he were not profane, he was careless in matters of religion; in this awful moment, a thousand instances of neglect and offence against his Creator occurred to his mind; and he felt that he would have given worlds, had he possessed them, for a few hours of the time he had so often abused.",say see perish arid frightful spot living creature care poor tender mother solicitous provide comfort sick poor feeling see unhappy son stretch burning flint continue enter rocky chamber sink exhaust floor think death feel proper frame mind die many young thoughtless profane careless matter religion awful moment instance neglect offence occur mind feel give world possess few hour time abuse 
146,"He recollected, too, with bitter regret, his pride, imperiousness, and implacability of disposition; of this, his conduct to young Harley was a frightful instance; he vainly wished he could have recalled the _past_, but that was not in his power; and he felt it very doubtful, if for him a _future_ in this world would be granted. The present was all he could call his own; and it behoved him to make the best use he could of the precious moments that were yet allowed him to make his peace with God. But, alas! the confusion incidental to fever had already attacked his brain; and, though he felt the necessity of penitence and prayer, it was no longer in his power to collect his wandering thoughts, so as to raise a single petition to the Throne of Mercy. He was sensible that he was on the brink of eternity; yet the minutes passed rapidly away, leaving his mind in a state between reason and delirium, yet conscious of his danger, and the importance of that time which was ebbing from him for ever.",recollect bitter regret pride imperiousness implacability disposition conduct young frightful instance wish recall _past_ power feel doubtful _future_ world grant present call own behove make good use precious moment allow make peace confusion incidental fever attack brain feel necessity penitence prayer power collect wonder thought raise single petition sensible brink eternity minute pass leave mind state reason delirium conscious danger importance time ebb 
147,"His bodily sufferings, too, were dreadful. Burning with fever, he had no means of quenching his thirst--he had long since drained the last drop from the shell, and could not replenish it; for the next morning saw him raving in delirium, or sunk in long and death-like fits of stupor, from which his faithful Neptune strove in vain to arouse him by his caresses.",bodily suffering dreadful burn fever have means quench thirst drain last drop shell replenish next morning see rave delirium sink long death fit stupor faithful strive vain arouse caresse 
148,"Philip, in the mean time, had returned to his comfortable hut in the Valley of Limes, and laid himself down to rest; but the image of Lord Robert, pale and languid as he had seen him seated on the boatswain's grave after their last altercation, pursued him when awake, and haunted his slumbers when he closed his eyes in sleep. In the morning, Philip sedulously pursued his useful employments, to divert these painful thoughts. He had discovered on the other side of the island some grass, the only natural production of the place, growing in long, dry, silky tufts out of the clefts of the rocks. He had cut several bundles of this grass, and braided it into a soft, thick mat; this mat he had fixed on a frame-work which he had made, and formed it into a most comfortable couch, rolling one end of the mat over for a pillow. He was so completely occupied and pleased with this employment, that he did not think of Lord Robert, till, on stretching his limbs upon this excellent bed, he remembered how differently his unfortunate enemy would sleep that night. He recollected that he had seen nothing of him in the Valley of Limes that day; and when he recalled the reproaches and threats he had used the day before, and reflected on Lord Robert's high spirit, he thought it probable that he would endure every suffering, rather than improve his condition by procuring anything from that spot. Of Neptune, Philip had seen nothing since the preceding day, when he had once visited the valley, and begged for a share of his dinner; for Lord Robert had peevishly chidden the dog for his importunities; indeed, he had nothing to give him, being too ill to go in search of food. Philip, who was very fond of Neptune, and had been accustomed to caress him when Lord Robert was out of sight, had fed him, and expected to see him again, but he did not come; and Philip thought it likely that Lord Robert was very ill; and he again bitterly regretted having used such expressions as had driven him from the valley.",mean time return comfortable hut lay rest image pale languid see seat boatswain grave last altercation pursue awake haunt slumber close eye sleep morning pursue useful employment divert painful thought discover other side island grass only natural production place grow long dry silky tuft cleft rock cut several bundle grass braid soft thick mat mat fix frame work make form comfortable couch roll end mat pillow occupy pleased employment think stretch limb excellent bed remember unfortunate enemy sleep night recollect see day recall reproache threat use day reflect high spirit think probable endure suffering improve condition procure spot see preced day visit valley begg share dinner chidd dog importunity have give ill go search food fond accustom caress sight feed expect see come think likely ill regret use such expression drive valley 
149,"The next day, Philip again visited the beach, where he had never been before in the meridian heat of the day, and when he experienced the blinding effects of the sunbeams, which soon occasioned him to feel, though in a lesser degree, one of those headaches that had continually tortured his more delicate rival, he wondered where Lord Robert could find shelter from the intense heat. Actuated by more humane motives than mere curiosity, he continued to pace the beach, determining not to return till he had seen Lord Robert. For some time he pursued his solitary walk, without discovering the object of his research. The sight of the seamen's graves redoubled his pain of mind. When he remembered the hopeless dejection visible in Lord Robert's face, so different from his usual animated expression of countenance, and combined it with the illness so apparent in his whole person, the thought crossed his mind, that he might have expired without a human creature near him. Philip shuddered as this dreadful idea presented itself. He was busy with self-accusing thoughts, when he paused before Lord Robert's cave, wishing, yet unwilling, to enter, when Neptune sprang from the interior part of it, and bounding round him, looked up wistfully in his face, and returned, as if to invite him to follow. This Philip could not prevail on himself to do. After waiting a few minutes, Neptune came again; and, laying hold of his jacket with his teeth, endeavoured to draw him into the cave--looking at him in such an imploring manner, that Philip could no longer resist his entreaties, not withstanding the reluctance he felt at intruding himself into Lord Robert's presence.",next day visit beach meridian heat day experience blind effect sunbeam occasion feel less degree headache torture delicate rival wonder find shelter intense heat actuate more humane motive mere curiosity continue pace beach determine return see time pursue solitary walk discover object research sight seamen grave redoubl pain mind remember hopeless dejection visible face different usual animated expression countenance combine illness apparent whole person thought cross mind expire human creature shudder dreadful idea present busy self accuse thought pause cave wish unwilling enter spring interior part bound look face return invite follow prevail do wait few minute come lay hold jacket tooth endeavour draw cave look implor manner resist entreaty withstand reluctance feel intrude presence 
150,"On entering the cave he beheld the unfortunate young nobleman stretched on the flinty floor in a stupor, so nearly resembling death, that Philip started back in horror; and so much had the violence of the disorder changed the appearance of his once beautiful countenance, that his dearest friends would scarcely have recognised his convulsed and livid features. On a second glance, Philip discovered that he still breathed, but was unconscious of his approach. His heavy eyes, half closed and fixed, had lost their expression of spirit and intelligence; his lips appeared parched and burning; and his light brown ringlets hung in disordered profusion, tangled and neglected, over his forehead.",enter cave beheld unfortunate young nobleman stretch flinty floor stupor resemble death start horror have violence disorder change appearance beautiful countenance dearest friend recognise convulse livid feature second glance discover breathe unconscious approach heavy eye half close fix lose expression spirit intelligence lip appear parched burn light brown ringlet hang disorder profusion tangle neglect forehead 
151,"At this heart-rending sight, Philip, forgetful of the enmity that had subsisted between him and the unhappy sufferer, turned away, and wept bitterly. It was with feelings of the most bitter compunction he recalled the altercation that had passed over the boatswain's grave--particularly when he experienced the stifling closeness of the cave, where he felt a difficulty in respiring; and reflected, that his menaces had had the effect of driving Lord Robert from the only temperate spot on the island.",heart rend sight forgetful enmity subsist unhappy sufferer turn goot feeling bitter compunction recall altercation pass boatswain grave experience stifling closeness cave feel difficulty respire reflect menace have effect drive only temperate spot island 
152,"Philip could form some idea of his Lordship's sufferings, from the recollection of an autumnal fever which had attacked him in his childhood, and nearly brought him to the brink of the grave; he remembered how much he had suffered from thirst, and the relief he had felt from some ices which the Marchioness, Lord Robert's mother, had brought him in her carriage. That noble lady had supplied him with the most delicate fruits from the hothouse; and his mother believed that these ices and fruits, which he took with so much avidity, had saved his life.",form idea suffering recollection autumnal fever attack childhood bring brink grave remember much suffer thirst relief feel ice mother bring carriage noble lady supply delicate fruit hothouse mother believe ice fruit take much avidity save life

154,"Here Philip was interrupted by Lord Robert's trying to articulate something; but so very faint was the attempt, that it was not till he had knelt down by his side, and raised his head on his arm, that he could catch his imperfect accents, or distinguish what he intended to express. Alas! it was but one word--""_Water!_"" and that repeated incessantly, in tones of agony, which Philip, some years after that melancholy period, declared that night and day he strove in vain to forget: and at that moment, when he beheld the parched and blackening lips from which those sounds proceeded, they pierced his heart with an anguish no tongue can describe. Fortunately he had a lime in his pocket, with the juice of which he moistened the sufferer's mouth. Some minutes elapsed before this appeared to have the least effect; but at length his Lordship became conscious of the relief, and swallowed with avidity the cooling fluid; and, opening his languid eyes, he turned them on Philip with an expression of gratitude which overpaid him for his exertions. It was evident, however, that he took him for some other person; for, extending his arms towards him, he called him ""Augustus! his beloved brother!"" and besought him in the most pathetic manner, ""to remove him from that horrid place, and to let him have a better bed than the hard one on which he lay, which he assured him had sadly bruised his body.""",interrupt try articulate faint attempt knolt side raise head arm catch imperfect accent distinguish intend express word water repeat tone agony year melancholy period declare night day strive vain forget moment beheld parched blacken lip sound proceed pierce heart anguish tongue describe have lime pocket juice moisten sufferer mouth minute elapse appear have least effect length become conscious relief swallow avidity cooling fluid open languid eye turn expression gratitude overpaid exertion evident take other person extend arm call beloved brother besig pathetic manner remove horrid place let have good bed hard one lay assure bruise body

158,"The touch of his dry and burning hand gave a sensation of pain to Philip, when it came in contact with his own, and his head dropped in powerless languor on his shoulder. Philip rested by the spring of water, and bathed Lord Robert's face and hands in the cool element: this seemed to revive him a little, and he drank eagerly from a shell of water which Philip held to his burning lips. Had it not been for this refreshment, the sufferer must have expired from thirst and exhaustion before they arrived at the valley. As it was, he appeared to endure so much pain from his exposure to the heat of the sun, that Philip uttered an expression of thankfulness when he reached the shelter of the hut, and laid his helpless burden on the couch of matting within it. But Lord Robert had swooned from weakness and fatigue, and lay for many hours without motion or sensation.",touch dry burn hand give sensation pain come contact own head drop powerless languor shoulder rest spring water bath face hand cool element seem revive little drink shell water hold burning lip refreshment sufferer expire thirst exhaustion arrive valley appear endure much pain exposure heat sun utter expression thankfulness reach shelter hut lay helpless burden couch matt swoon weakness fatigue lay many hour motion sensation 
159,"Philip now busied himself in procuring a large supply both of water and limes; and, mixing the juice of the limes in water, continually bathed the sufferer's hands and temples with this refreshing liquid, watching anxiously for returning life. The next day Lord Robert opened his eyes, and expressed his surprise and pleasure at finding his condition so much improved. But his reason was lost in delirium; he talked incessantly; and, addressing Philip by the name of his brother, bestowed on him the most endearing expressions of affection and described to him the particulars of his illness, and all his dreadful privations, in a manner pathetically minute.",busy procure large supply water lime mix juice lime water bath sufferer hand temple refresh liquid watch return life next day open eye express surprise pleasure find condition improve reason lose delirium talk address name brother bestow endearing expression affection describe particular illness dreadful privation manner minute 
160,"Philip, deeply interested, and forgetting that he spoke under the influence of delirium, anxiously exclaimed, ""Why did you not return to the Valley of Limes?""--""Because,"" replied his Lordship, wholly unconscious to whom he spoke, ""I was ill and alone, and totally unable to cope with that insolent Harley, who menaced me with his superior strength.""",interested forget speak influence delirium exclaim return reply unconscious speak ill alone unable cope insolent menace superior strength

162,"Philip was greatly surprised and agitated, when, after much unconnected wandering, Lord Robert said: ""You, Augustus, always blamed me about that Philip Harley, and said you knew him to be an estimable youth, and that he had been hardly used through a prejudice I had against him; but what would you have thought, Augustus, had you seen him clench his hand and threaten your unhappy brother with personal ill-treatment, when he was too ill to defend himself from his violence?""",surprise agitated much unconnected wonder say blame say know estimable youth use prejudice have think see clench hand threaten unhappy brother personal ill treatment ill defend violence

164,"From these self-reproaches he was again roused by Lord Robert's speaking; but he had wandered to a different subject, and evidently imagined himself at his own home, for he demanded ""ices, peaches, and strawberries,"" in a tone of feverish impatience; and Philip was at a loss how to satisfy these cravings; but when at last Lord Robert mentioned ""grapes,"" Philip remembered those that were ripening on the roof of the hut, and hastened to see if any were fit to eat; though his patient, in a tone of displeasure, called him to return and send a servant to execute his orders, for he did not choose to be left alone. This was, however, unavoidable; and in a moment he returned with a rich cluster, perfectly ripe. Lord Robert eagerly seized them, with an exclamation of joy; but he was reduced to such a state of weakness, that he was unable to convey them to his mouth; and resigning the cluster to Philip, begged him to feed him. Philip obeyed, and attended to all his whims with the greatest patience. At length, exhausted by the volubility of delirium, he sank again into a death-like stupor, in which he lay, without sense or motion, the whole of the night, and till the next day was far advanced.",self reproache rouse speak wander different subject imagine own home demand ice peach strawberry tone feverish impatience loss satisfy craving last mention grape remember ripen roof hut hasten see fit eat patient tone displeasure call return send servant execute order choose leave alone unavoidable moment return rich cluster ripe seize exclamation joy reduce state weakness unable convey mouth resign cluster begg feed obey attend whim great patience length exhaust volubility delirium sink death like stupor lay sense motion whole night next day advance 
165,"Philip, who had continued to bathe his hands and face at intervals, perceived by the painful motion of his lips that he wanted something to drink. Philip raised his head, and supported it on his bosom, while he held to his lips a shell full of the juice of limes and grapes. Lord Robert drank this delicious beverage eagerly; then opening his eyes, which Philip thought would never again have unclosed, he looked up in his face, as if to thank him for the relief; and Philip saw by the expression of wonder and astonishment in those eyes, so lately fixed and rayless, that he knew him, and was no longer under the influence of delirium. A deep crimson mounted to his pallid cheek, as he said--""Harley, I don't deserve this kindness at _your_ hands:"" and with a deep sigh he again relapsed into insensibility. The sound of his voice, and the manner in which he pronounced this short sentence, thrilled to Philip's heart; and he hung over him with a tender interest, watching the progress of his disorder with the most intense anxiety. Philip had been little accustomed to witness illness: he had scarcely ever watched by a sick-bed, with the exception of the illness of his sister, who had died; but death had laid so gentle a hand on her, that her decease rather resembled the withering of a flower than the passage of a mortal to the grave: far different from the terrific advances of a raging tropical fever, which brought Lord Robert, through stages of exquisite suffering, nearly to the eve of dissolution.",continue bathe hand face interval perceive painful motion lip want drink raise head support bosom hold lip shell full juice lime grape drink delicious beverage open eye think unclose look face thank relief see expression wonder astonishment eye fix rayless know influence delirium deep crimson mount pallid cheek say deserve kindness hand deep sigh relaps insensibility sound voice manner pronounce short sentence thrill heart hang tender interest watch progress disorder intense anxiety little accustom witness illness watch sick bed exception illness sister die death lay gentle hand decease resemble withering flower passage mortal grave different terrific advance rage tropical fever bring stage exquisite suffering eve dissolution 
166,"The sight of these sufferings had extinguished the last spark of animosity in Philip's bosom; and it was with feelings nearly allied to those with which he contemplated the death-bed of that beloved sister, that he awaited the termination of Lord Robert's disorder. That it would be fatal he doubted not, for he watched in vain for a second interval of reason; but day after day passed, without the slightest intermission of suffering; but the fever seemed rather to increase in violence, and his Lordship's wanderings from reason assumed a more gloomy character, in which the most unbounded expressions of self-reproach had a principal share. No longer petulant and impatient, he appeared sunk in the deepest despondency; and this turn in the disease alarmed Philip more than his most extravagant fits of raving. It was truly awful to see a fellow-creature, and, alas! a very erring one, on the brink of eternity, without a ray of reason being granted him to prepare to meet his great account. It then occurred to Philip, that many of the faults of which the unhappy sufferer accused himself, had been occasioned by his own pertinacity in throwing himself in his way, and provoking him to violent conduct; by that means setting his fiery temper in a blaze, and causing his evil passions to be ever uppermost, till they prompted him to commit those injuries for which he now suffered the most bitter remorse.",sight suffering extinguish last spark animosity bosom feeling ally contemplate death bed beloved sister await termination disorder fatal doubt watch vain second interval reason day day pass slight intermission suffering fever seem increase violence wandering reason assume gloomy character unbounded expression self reproach have principal share petulant impatient appear sink deep despondency turn disease alarm more extravagant fit raving awful see fellow creature erring one brink eternity ray reason grant prepare meet great account occur many fault unhappy sufferer accuse occasion own pertinacity throw way provoke violent conduct mean set fiery temper blaze cause evil passion uppermost prompt commit injury suffer bitter remorse

168,"Philip pursued these self-accusing reflections as he was kneeling by Lord Robert's side, and fanning him with the wing of a sea-fowl, which Neptune had brought him the day before. The weather had been intensely hot, and attended with thunder and lightning; but as the day declined, some heavy rain descended, which had the effect of cooling the burning earth. This salutary change produced an alteration in Lord Robert, who opening his eyes, gazed round him in indescribable astonishment. At last he said, ""Where am I?

171,"He turned away his face, and covered it with his emaciated hands; but Philip knew, by the convulsive heaving of his bosom, that he was weeping. Philip, from a feeling of delicacy, withdrew to a little distance, to avoid the intrusive appearance of watching Lord Robert's emotions; and he feared to increase his agitation, or offend his proud spirit, by even offering a word of comfort. Yet his caution was unnecessary, for the tears Lord Robert shed were not those of humbled pride, but they were those of a broken and contrite spirit; they were such tears as would occasion joy in Heaven, for they were those of true penitence; and Lord Robert was not ashamed of indulging in them, neither did he seek to conceal their traces from Philip, when he turned his eyes towards him, and motioned him to approach.",turn face cover emaciated hand know convulsive heaving bosom weep feeling delicacy withdraw little distance avoid intrusive appearance watch emotion fear increase agitation offend proud spirit offer word comfort caution unnecessary tear shed humble pride broken contrite spirit such tear occasion joy true penitence ashamed indulg seek conceal trace turn eye motion approach

Lord Robert threw himself into his arms, and Philip felt his tears wet his bosom. Yet at that moment each felt happier than he had done for months before. But Philip became painfully anxious for the invalid, the violence of whose emotions brought on a fresh access of fever.

178,"Philip now entertained the greatest apprehensions for his Lordship's life, and was himself surprised at the pain he felt at the idea of losing him. He had evinced such full and noble contrition for his errors, that Philip, forgetting all his injuries, wondered how he had ever borne a hatred so bitter against him. That hatred had, indeed, changed gradually into an affection so warm, that he was ready to impute to his own faulty temper the blame of all that had passed. ""And, oh!"" said he, as he hung over the couch where Lord Robert lay, apparently unconscious of his presence, ""who could think that I, who now watch so anxiously every change of his pallid countenance, could once have taken delight in provoking him to fight with me, and then took a savage pleasure in aiming my blows at his face, and disfiguring his fine features with the marks of my violence?

182,"After some time, Philip succeeded in soothing his patient into some degree of composure; and at length he had the satisfaction of seeing him sink into a profound sleep. Then, being worn out with anxious watching and fatigue, he threw himself on the ground, and enjoyed a calm and refreshing slumber. When he awoke, it was about sunrise; and seeing Lord Robert still asleep, he went out to get a supply of fruit and turtle. On his return, he found Lord Robert awake and evidently better; for he was returning the caresses of Neptune, who certainly had deserved his fondness, for he had been almost as watchful and abstinent, and as attentive to his master's sufferings, as Philip himself. The patient extended his hand towards Philip as he entered, who hastened to him and inquired tenderly, ""how long he had been awake, and how he found himself?""",time succeed soothing patient degree composure length have satisfaction see sink profound sleep wear anxious watch fatigue throw ground enjoy calm refresh slumber awoke sunrise see asleep go get supply fruit turtle return find good return caresse deserve fondness watchful abstinent attentive master suffering patient extend hand enter hasten inquire awake find

Philip respectfully took the hand that was extended towards him; and, after expressing his pleasure at seeing him so much recovered, began to busy himself in procuring him all the comforts in his power. Lord Robert, for the first time since his illness, was able to raise himself to wash his hands and face in some water which Philip brought him in a turtle-shell. After this grateful refreshment, he attempted with his pocket-comb to disentangle his ruffled and matted hair; but his hands trembled so much from weakness, that he sank exhausted on the couch. Philip took the comb from his hands, and with great care and patience succeeded in smoothing and reducing to their natural order these refractory ringlets. Lord Robert repeatedly bade him give himself no farther trouble, but take his knife and cut them off as well as he could. But Philip did not like to spoil the fine hair which Lord Robert had once been proud of; and had the Marchioness herself presided at this operation, it could not have been more tenderly performed than by the hands of this young sailor; and his patient appeared to derive great benefit from this attention to his personal comforts, though reduced to a state of infantine weakness.",long miss thank unwearied kindness say melancholy smile take hand extend express pleasure see recover begin busy procure comfort power first time illness able raise wash hand face water bring turtle shell grateful refreshment attempt pocket comb disentangle ruffled matt hair hand tremble weakness sink exhaust couch take comb hand great care patience succeed smooth reduce natural order refractory ringlet bid give far trouble take knife cut like spoil fine hair proud have preside operation perform hand young sailor patient appear derive great benefit attention personal comfort reduce state infantine weakness 
184,"Lord Robert now rapidly improved in health, and was soon enabled, with the assistance of Philip's arm, to walk in the Valley of Limes in the cool of the morning. Notwithstanding this improvement, however, Philip continued to attend on him with the most assiduous care; and even when he was in a state of convalescence, still performed for him all those little offices which he knew Lord Robert had been accustomed to have done for him by his attendants, though his Lordship did not wish to consider himself entitled to such services in his present situation.",improve health enable assistance arm walk cool morning improvement continue attend assiduous care state convalescence perform little office know accustom do attendant wish consider entitle such service present situation

On his return from the beach with a load of wreck, he was much surprised, not only to see Lord Robert up and dressed, but employing himself in preparing the breakfast.

In this search they wandered to a different part of the island, and Lord Robert discovered, at a little distance, something dark and large heaving among the surf; he called Philip's attention to it, who soon got it on shore; and they found it to be a chest belonging to some of the unfortunate crew of the Diomede: it was heavy, but Philip soon carried it to the hut.",day conversation accompany beach seek turtle egg search wander different part island discover little distance dark large heave surf call attention get shore find chest belong unfortunate crew heavy carry hut

No longer proud and irritable, his behaviour was gentle, mild, and considerate; his manners, always elegant and polished, possessed a charm altogether irresistible; and his conversation, pure, refined, and chiefly directed to intellectual subjects, was so delightful, that Philip thought his society would unfit him for any other.",affection form high bear companion strong animosity illness conduct manner deserve unbounded attachment lowly warm hearted friend testify proud irritable behaviour gentle mild considerate manners elegant polished possess charm irresistible conversation pure refine direct intellectual subject delightful think society unfit other

Here then, after spending the day in study or useful employment, they passed the evening, conversing together, or examining the starry heavens, and noting constellations, which appear very different from those of Europe. Sometimes, Lord Robert would play on Cary's flute; but though it was enchanting to listen to this music in the stillness of a moonlight evening, when all the fire-flies in the island were collected in this only spot of verdure, and were blazing round them, and everything above and around accorded so well with these sweet sounds, yet it was forbidden pleasure; for playing on the flute was injurious to Lord Robert's health; and Philip, though he loved music, and this music most of all, would often take the flute almost by force from the hands of his noble friend, who, being a fine performer, and much attached to music, never knew how to resign it in prudent time.",make latticed porch hut train vine enjoy cool evening expose noxious effect dew spend day study useful employment pass evening convers examine starry heaven note constellation appear different play flute enchanting listen music stillness moonlight evening fire fly island collect only spot verdure blaze accord sweet sound forbidden pleasure play flute injurious health love music music most take flute force hand noble friend fine performer attach music know resign prudent time 
226,"The happiness Philip now enjoyed was only interrupted by the pain he felt, whenever the probability was mentioned of their leaving the island. Lord Robert expected that, when certain winds set in, some vessel or other would touch at the island for water or turtle; and Philip guessed, that when they were taken from their present abode, this delightful intercourse would cease, and Lord Robert would be for ever separated from him by the forms of society. This made him feel almost pettish when he found that, when these winds commenced, Lord Robert left him for hours, and passed his time leaning against the cross on the hill, making observations through his perspective-glass; while Philip remained in the valley, employing himself for their mutual benefit. But though he felt almost angry with Lord Robert for depriving him so much of his company, yet he never presumed to remonstrate with him on this or any other subject; and when he saw him approach the valley on his return, he would forget all his repinings, and hasten to meet him, and offer his arm for his support, if he seemed faint or fatigued. It is not surprising that Lord Robert returned this tender affection with the utmost regard. He now felt the gratifying conviction, that it was not to the superiority of his rank and power, but to his virtues, his acquirements, and charming manners, that he owed his influence over the heart of one on whom his situation in life had made no impression, and who had denied him the slightest respect till he had proved himself deserving of it; and he could not help remarking, that he had never, when in the height of his pride and power, received half the real deference, or marks of delicate attention, which had been shown him since his residence on the island, by his only companion and former enemy, Philip Harley.",happiness enjoy interrupt pain feel probability mention leave island expect certain wind set vessel other touch island water turtle guess take present abode delightful intercourse cease separate form society make feel pettish find wind commence leave hour pass time lean cross hill make observation perspective glass remain valley employ mutual benefit feel angry deprive much company presume remonstrate other subject see approach valley return forget repining hast meet offer arm support seem faint fatigued surprising return tender affection utmost regard feel gratifying conviction superiority rank power virtue acquirement charming manners owe influence heart situation life make impression deny slight respect prove deserve help remark height pride power receive real deference mark delicate attention show residence island only companion former enemy

But if there was a man in the world whom Lord Robert feared, it was Sir Henry; yet, at the same time, he was so unerringly just and judicious, that his nephew loved him with the most ardent affection, and was used to consider the displeasure of his uncle as the most serious misfortune that could befal him: and such was the good effect this salutary awe had on him, when on board ship, that Sir Henry was not a little proud of his officer-like conduct, never having had occasion to frown on him for any breach of duty or immorality. Lord Robert knew the high place he held in his uncle's opinion, and the idea of forfeiting his esteem was dreadful. True, he was not actually under the necessity of making a confession so mortifying. Sir Henry need never know the misrepresentation he had made to his father:--a single word to that fond parent would not only prevail on him to bury the whole in oblivion, but induce him to devise excuses to cover his faults and reconcile him to himself.

In this frame of mind, he looked back with the most painful regret to their residence on the island, and the delightful hours he had spent with his noble friend in the acquirement of knowledge. In the midst of these repinings, he received a summons to Lord Robert's cabin. He did not find any one there; but was told by his conductor to wait till his Lordship returned from dining with his uncle.

Lord Robert could not help smiling to find that he had, for once, overcome that firmness for which Philip generally was distinguished. His agitation was painful in the extreme; but when he did at length speak, it was with a vehemence of gratitude, which showed Lord Robert the dominion he now possessed over the once stubborn and haughty mind of Philip Harley. ""It is not,"" said he, wringing Lord Robert's hand as he spoke, ""because I am proud and ambitious, and you have raised me from my lowly rank, and given me an opportunity of distinguishing myself--this is, indeed, much,--but it is not that which makes my heart overflow with joy: it is the consciousness that I shall now sometimes be suffered to be near you, and that my humble situation will not deprive me of your friendship.""",change sudden take power express joy help smile find overcome firmness distinguished agitation painful extreme length speak vehemence gratitude show dominion possess stubborn haughty mind say wring hand speak proud ambitious raise lowly rank give opportunity distinguish much make heart overflow joy consciousness suffer humble situation deprive friendship

Harley pursued his retreating figure with his eyes, as he followed Sir Henry Stanley and Lieutenant Cary into the splendid state-barge, which the Portuguese Governor had sent to convey them on shore. As the sun shone brightly on the gilded vessel, and her silken streamers fluttered in the breeze, it recalled to his mind the remembrance of the Ariel; and he recollected with shame his lawless exploit of sailing in that fairy frigate, in defiance of her owner, and in his very sight.",dear friend say leave wish barge wait convey uncle shore spend day pleasure attend mean time find sufficient amusement doubt brother officer say withdraw pursue retreat figure eye follow splendid state barge portuguese send convey shore sun shine gilded vessel silken streamer flutter breeze recall mind remembrance recollect shame lawless exploit sail fairy frigate defiance owner very sight

Yet Philip was deceived when, in the warmth of his affection, he thought it must have been his own prejudices that made Lord Robert appear to him at one time so cruel and tyrannical. It was from the trials experienced in adversity, that he had learned to correct his faults and follies: yet it is but justice to Lord Robert to say, that he never would have committed such outrages, had not Philip studied modes of insult and provocation sufficient to have irritated a much calmer spirit, and which finally drew upon Philip severe punishment, and on Lord Robert proportionable remorse and suffering.",enrage repeat trespass think look new uniform consider noble friend behave present wonder appear overbearing arrogant deceive warmth affection think own prejudice make appear time cruel tyrannical trial experience adversity learn correct fault follie justice say commit such outrage study mode insult provocation sufficient irritate calmer spirit draw severe punishment proportionable remorse suffering

Perhaps many of them were not without prejudice on that subject; but, in addition to this, his former mutinous conduct had not failed to make a very ill impression on the minds of these gentlemen; and this conduct they now appeared to remember, so far as to render the time of Lord Robert's absence very uncomfortable, and to deprive Philip of most of the pleasure his new rank had given him. When Lord Robert returned, he found his friend, whom he expected to have seen full of joy and spirits, walking by himself in a very melancholy mood. To his anxious inquiries respecting the reason of his dejection, he replied, by relating the various slights which he had experienced since his departure.",present quarter deck have mortification perceive general coldness disapprobation officer painful quick feeling high spirit attribute contempt low birth many prejudice subject addition former mutinous conduct fail make ill impression mind gentleman conduct appear remember render time absence uncomfortable deprive most pleasure new rank give return find friend expect see full joy spirit walk melancholy mood anxious inquiry respect reason dejection reply relate various slight experience departure

I say nothing of his admirable conduct to myself; though, I trust, that, with all my faults, his having been the means of saving my life will be a recommendation to my brother officers; and I should hope that his lowly birth will not be remembered to his prejudice by officers of the British navy, whose boast it is that some of its proudest ornaments[7] have risen from before the mast.""",gentlemen say give leave present friend former fault own more answerable sensible have cause offend different time trust have reason future forget rashness press man merit midshipman rank noble captain reward valour last engagement think proper promote say admirable conduct trust fault means save life recommendation brother officer hope lowly birth remember prejudice officer british navy boast proud ornament rise mast

309,"A murmur of applause followed this speech, which was seconded by Lieutenant Cary's presenting his hand to young Harley; and his example was followed by all the gentlemen present, who, with the frankness of British officers, offered him successively their congratulations on his promotion.",murmur applause follow speech second present hand young example follow gentleman present frankness british officer offer congratulation promotion 
310,"""Spoken like yourselves, my gallant friends!"" exclaimed Lord Robert, warmly shaking hands with his brother officers; ""it shall never be said by our enemies, that valour and merit were slighted in the British navy, unless recommended by the adventitious advantages of rank or riches in their possessor.""",spoken gallant friend exclaim shake hand brother officer say enemy valour merit slight british navy recommend adventitious advantage rank rich possessor 
311,"Lord Robert knew the way to the hearts of his brave friends. To their good feelings he did not appeal in vain; and Philip never again had reason to complain of the least slight or disregard from any officer on board the Diomede; and never till that hour had Lord Robert tasted how truly delightful is the possession of power, when the influence which more or less it holds in society is applied to a noble purpose; and Philip Harley, by his steady attention to his duty, and his officer-like and gallant conduct in his new rank, speedily erased from the minds of these gentlemen his former mutinous and violent behaviour, and obtained the highest praise from his just and discriminating commander. How proud was Philip--how happy Lord Robert, whenever Sir Henry Stanley expressed his approbation at this conduct! There never was a friendship more warm or sincere than that which now subsisted between the two former enemies, who used often to relate their mutual sufferings, as a warning of the folly of answering a provocation, or retaliating an injury.",know way heart brave friend good feeling appeal vain have reason complain least slight disregard officer board hour taste delightful possession power influence more less hold society apply noble purpose steady attention duty officer like gallant conduct new rank erase mind gentleman former mutinous violent behaviour obtain high praise discriminate commander proud happy express approbation conduct be friendship warm sincere subsist former enemy use relate mutual suffering warning folly answer provocation retaliate injury 
312,"Before they sailed from Rio de Janeiro, Sir Henry Stanley generously presented Philip with every equipment necessary for his appearance as a gentleman; and, during the voyage home, he was the friend, companion, and pupil of Lord Robert, who delighted to impart to him every accomplishment and took the greatest pleasure in witnessing the development of his naturally fine talents.",sail present equipment necessary appearance gentleman voyage home friend companion pupil delight impart accomplishment take great pleasure witness development fine talent 
313,"When the Diomede approached the shores of England, Philip again began to be fearful lest the high rank of Lord Robert should separate them; but he was agreeably surprised, when, on their landing, Lord Robert insisted on his taking a place in the equipage that conveyed him to Lancashire; and, though he permitted Philip to visit first the lowly home of his sorrowing parents, yet he and his noble father came for him the next day, and invited him to the Hall, where he shared in all the unbounded affection and caresses which the Marquis and Marchioness bestowed on their noble son.",approach shore begin fearful high rank separate surprise landing insist take place equipage convey permit visit lowly home sorrow parent noble father come next day invite share unbounded affection caresse bestow noble son 
314,"On the first arrival of the Diomede at Rio de Janeiro, Sir Henry Stanley, supposing he had seen his nephew and Philip Harley perish, wrote to England an account of the dreadful loss, which was received both in the cottage and at the Hall with the deepest affliction. Since that time, no communication had been received; but as the Diomede was nearly ready to sail when the young friends arrived from the island, they themselves brought the first intelligence to England of their safety and welfare. They found each family in deep mourning, and plunged in acute sorrow, which was changed into extravagant joy at their unexpected arrival. The Marquis had become acquainted with most of the circumstances that occasioned the enmity between his son and Philip Harley, and had suffered much remorse, reproaching himself continually for having torn the only surviving child from his parents to meet an untimely death. From his natural goodness of heart, he greeted Philip's safe return as that of another son, particularly when he found he was indebted to him for the delight of seeing Lord Robert once again.",first arrival suppose see nephew perish write account dreadful loss receive cottage deep affliction time communication receive ready sail young friend arrive island bring first intelligence safety welfare find family deep mourn plunge acute sorrow change extravagant joy unexpected arrival become acquainted most circumstance occasion enmity son suffer much remorse reproach tear only survive child parent meet untimely death natural goodness heart greet safe return son find indebt delight see 
315,"The unlimited indulgence which the young friends met with at home might have been attended with bad effects, had they remained long exposed to its influence. But, in less than a month, they were again summoned to resume their duties on board the Diomede, where Sir Henry had hoisted his flag on his promotion to the rank of Admiral.",unlimited indulgence young friend meet home attend bad effect remain expose influence less month summon resume duty board hoist flag promotion rank 
316,"Both the friends were possessed of those high talents which, when combined with valour, seldom fail of obtaining great distinction; and so nobly did they acquit themselves in their naval duties, that after many years had witnessed their career of glory, and they had attained the height of their profession, England never saw two braver admirals than Lord Robert Summers and the Mutineer.",friend possess high talent combine valour fail obtain great distinction acquit naval duty many year witness career glory attain height profession see brave admiral
