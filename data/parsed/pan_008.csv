1,CHAPTER 8. THE MERMAIDS’ LAGOON,chapter 
2,"If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.",shut eye lucky one see time shapeless pool lovely pale colour suspend darkness squeeze eye tight pool begin take shape colour become vivid squeeze go fire go fire see lagoon near get mainland heavenly moment be moment see surf hear mermaid sing 
3,"The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners’ Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.",child spend long summer day lagoon swim float most time play mermaid game water think mermaid friendly term contrary last regret time island have civil word steal edge lagoon see score rock love bask comb hair lazy way irritate swim tiptoe yard see dive splash tail accident 
4,"They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.",treat boy same way course chate rock hour sit tail get cheeky give comb 
5,"The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.",haunting time see turn moon utter strange wail cry lagoon dangerous mortal evening have tell see lagoon moonlight less fear course accompany have strict rule one bed lagoon sunny day rain mermaid come extraordinary number play bubble bubble many colour make rainbow water treat ball hit tail try keep rainbow burst goal end rainbow keeper allow use hand game go lagoon time pretty sight 
6,"But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.",moment child try join have play mermaid disappear have proof watch interloper take idea introduce new way hit bubble head hand mermaid adopt mark leave 
7,"It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.",pretty see child rest rock hour mid-day meal insist do have real rest meal make believe lay sun body glisten sit look important 
8,"It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock. The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy, stitching.",such day rock large great bed course know take much room doze least lie eye shut pinch think look busy stitch 
9,"While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly.",stitch change come lagoon little shiver run sun go shadow steal water turn cold see thread needle look lagoon laugh place seem formidable unfriendly 
10,"It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?",know night come dark night come bad come send shiver sea say come 
11,"There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners’ Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged.",crowd story tell call evil captain put sailor leave drown drown tide rise submerge 
12,"Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?",course rouse child unknown stalk good sleep rock grow chilly young mother know think stick rule hour mid day meal fear long hear male voice wake hear sound muffle oar heart mouth wake stand let have sleep brave 
13,"It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.",boy be sniff danger sleep spring erect dog warning cry rouse other 
14,"He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.",stand motionless hand ear 
15,"“Pirates!” he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.",cry other come close strange smile play face see shudder smile face dare address do stand ready obey order come sharp incisive

17,"There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted. Marooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself marooned.",be gleam leg lagoon seem desert rock stand forbid water maroon 
18,"The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it is enough.",boat draw pirate dinghy figure third captive other hand ankle tie know fate leave rock perish end race terrible death fire torture write book tribe be path water happy hunting ground face impassive daughter chief die chief daughter enough 
19,"They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth. No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to guard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.",catch board pirate ship knife mouth watch keep ship hook boast wind name guard ship mile fate help guard more wail go round wind night

22,It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.,work brutal moment land beautiful girl rock proud offer vain resistance 
23,"Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down, Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.",rock sight head bob cry first tragedy see see many tragedy forget sorry anger mean save easy way wait pirate go choose easy way

37,"Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness; but she knew that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was stayed even in the act, for “Boat ahoy!” rang over the lagoon in Hook’s voice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.",course elated cleverness know elate likely crow betray hand go cover mouth stay act ring lagoon voice time speak

41,"He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him he had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook grip the boat’s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit. “Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!” he whispered to her, and though she thought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself.",swim boat man show light guide reach light lantern see hook grip boat side see evil swarthy face rise drip water quak like swim budge tingle life top heavy conceit wonder wonder whisper think glad sake reputation hear

54,"Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying, “What was that?”",pull water start cry 
55,"“I heard nothing,” said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting on it.",hear say raise lantern water pirate look see strange sight nest tell float lagoon bird sit

132,"Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb. Neither knew that the other was coming.

After all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook’s belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe. It would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.",great hero confess fall begin combat have sinking feeling stomach moment admit only man fear have sinking have feeling gladness gnash pretty tooth joy quick think snatch knife belt about drive see high rock foe fight fair give pirate hand help 
134,It was then that Hook bit him.,bite 
135,"Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made him quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After you have been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot it.

On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy” as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids. “They must be swimming back or flying,” the boys concluded. They were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy’s fault!",few moment other boy see hook water strike ship elation pestilent face white fear crocodile dogg pursuit ordinary occasion boy swum cheering uneasy lose scour lagoon call name find dinghy go shouting go answer come mocking laughter mermaid swim fly boy conclude anxious have such faith chuckle boylike late bed mother fault

Peter was alone on the lagoon.",lady tie tail cling refuse go good bye push rock few minute borne sight alone lagoon

Pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling to the moon.,rock small submerge pale ray light tiptoe water be hear sound musical melancholy world mermaid call moon 
164,"Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was saying, “To die will be an awfully big adventure.”",other boy afraid last tremour run shudder pass sea sea shudder follow be hundred feel one next moment stand erect rock smile face drum beat say die big adventure
