Mrs Edmonstone thought at first his reluctance was only shyness and stay-at-home nonsense, that ought to be overcome; but when she had been there, and saw how Mrs. Brownlow beset him, and the unpleasant fuss they made about his singing, she quite came round to his mind, and was very sorry she had exposed him to so much that was disagreeable.’",have niece give musical party voice make valuable tell go believe like first find be end take great deal time style thing desirable think first reluctance shyness stay home nonsense overcome see beset unpleasant fuss make singing come mind sorry expose much disagreeable

At the least critical parts of the work, she asked after the rest of the party, and was answered that papa had driven Charles out in the pony carriage, and that Laura and Eveleen were sitting on the lawn, reading and working with mamma.

56,"Coming out on the lawn, they found the three ladies sitting under the acacia, with their books and work. Laura did, indeed, look older than her real age, as much above twenty as Amy looked under nineteen. She was prettier than ever; her complexion exquisite in delicacy, her fine figure and the perfect outline of her features more developed; but the change from girl to woman had passed over her, and set its stamp on the anxious blue eye, and almost oppressed brow. Mary thought it would be hard to define where was that difference. It was not want of bloom, for of that Laura had more than any of the others, fresh, healthy, and bright, while Amy was always rather pale, and Lady Eveleen was positively wan and faded by London and late hours; nor was it loss of animation, for Laura talked and laughed with interest and eagerness; nor was it thought, for little Amy, when at rest, wore a meditative, pensive countenance; but there was something either added or taken away, which made it appear that the serenity and carelessness of early youth had fled from her, and the air of the cares of life had come over her.",come lawn find lady sit acacia book work look old real age look pretty complexion exquisite delicacy fine figure perfect outline feature develop change girl woman pass set stamp anxious blue eye oppress brow think hard define difference want bloom have more other fresh healthy bright pale wan fade late hour loss animation talk laugh interest eagerness think little rest wear meditative pensive countenance be add take make appear serenity carelessness early youth flead air care life come 
57,"Mary told her plans,--Church service at four, followed by a tea-drinking in the fields; tea in the garden for the company, and play for the school children and all who liked to join them.

58,"Mrs. Edmonstone gladly made the engagement and Lady Eveleen promised to be quite well, and to teach the children all manner of new games, though she greatly despised the dullness of English children, and had many droll stories of the stupidity of Laura’s pupils, communicated to her, with perhaps a little exaggeration, by Charles, and still further embellished by herself, for the purpose of exciting Charlotte’s indignation.",make engagement promise teach child manner new game despise dullness english child have many droll story stupidity pupil communicate little exaggeration embellish purpose exciting indignation 
59,"Mary proceeded to her consultation about the singing, and was conducted by Guy and Amy to the piano, and when her ears could not be indoctrinated by their best efforts, they more than half engaged to walk to East-hill, and have a conversation with the new school-master, whom Mary pitied for having fallen on people so unable to appreciate his musical training as herself and her father. The whole party walked back with her as far as the shade lasted; and at the end of the next field she turned, saw them standing round the stile, thought what happy people they were, and then resumed her wonder whither Laura’s youthfulness had flown.",proceed consultation singing conduct piano ear indoctrinate good effort more half engage walk hill have conversation new school master pity fall person unable appreciate musical training father whole party walk shade last end next field turn see stand stile think happy person resume wonder youthfulness fly 
60,"The situation of Philip and Laura had not changed. His regiment had never been at any great distance from Hollywell, and he often came, venturing more as Laura learnt to see him with less trepidation. He seldom or never was alone with her; but his influence was as strong as ever, and look, word, and gesture, which she alone could understand, told her what she was to him, and revealed his thoughts. To him she was devoted, all her doings were with a view to please him, and deserve his affection; he was her world, and sole object. Indeed, she was sometimes startled by perceiving that tenderly as she loved her own family, all were subordinate to him. She had long since known the true name of her feelings for him; she could not tell when or how the certainty had come, but she was conscious that it was love that they had acknowledged for one another and that she only lived in the light of his love. Still she did not realize the evil of concealment; it was so deep a sensation of her innermost heart, that she never could imagine revealing it to any living creature, and she had besides so surrendered her judgment to her idol, that no thought could ever cross her that he had enjoined what was wrong. Her heart and soul were his alone, and she left the future to him without an independent desire or reflection. All the embarrassments and discomforts which her secret occasioned her were met willingly for his sake, and these were not a few, though time had given her more self-command, or, perhaps, more properly speaking, had hardened her.",situation change regiment great distance come venture learn see less trepidation alone influence strong look word gesture understand tell reveal thought devote doing view please deserve affection world sole object startle perceive love own family subordinate know true name feeling tell certainty come conscious love acknowledge live light love realize evil concealment deep sensation innermost heart imagine reveal living creature have surrender judgment idol thought cross enjoin wrong heart soul alone leave future independent desire reflection embarrassment discomfort secret occasion meet sake few time give more self command speak harden 
61,"She always had a dread of tete-a-tetes and conversations over novels, and these were apt to be unavoidable when Eveleen was at Hollywell. The twilight wanderings on the terrace were a daily habit, and Eveleen almost always paired with her. On this evening in particular, Laura was made very uncomfortable by Eveleen’s declaring that it was positively impossible and unnatural that the good heroine of some novel should have concealed her engagement from her parents. Laura could not help saying that there might be many excuses; then afraid that she was exciting suspicion, changed the subject in great haste, and tried to make Eveleen come indoors, telling her she would tire herself to death, and vexed by her cousin’s protestations that the fresh cool air did her good. Besides, Eveleen was looking with attentive eyes at another pair who were slowly walking up and down the shady walk that bordered the grass-plot, and now and then standing still to enjoy the subdued silence of the summer evening, and the few distant sounds that marked the perfect lull.",have dread tete tete conversation novel apt unavoidable twilight wandering terrace daily habit pair evening particular make uncomfortable declare impossible unnatural good heroine novel conceal engagement parent help say be many excuse afraid exciting suspicion change subject great haste try make come tell tire death vex cousin protestation fresh cool air do good look attentive eye pair walk shady walk border grass plot stand enjoy subdued silence summer evening few distant sound mark perfect lull

She had not forgotten her notion that Eveleen was attracted by Guy’s manners, and had been curious to see what would happen when Eveleen was sent to Hollywell for country air.",think night forget notion attract manners curious see happen send country air 
78,"She had a very good opinion of Lady Eveleen. Since the former visit, she had shown more spirit of improvement, and laid aside many little follies; she had put herself under Laura’s guidance, and tamed down into what gave the promise of a sensible woman, more than anything that had hitherto been observed in her; and little addicted to match-making as Mrs. Edmonstone was, she could not help thinking that Eva was almost worthy of her dear Guy (she never could expect to find anyone she should think quite worthy of him, he was too like one of her own children for that), and on the other hand, how delighted Lord and Lady Kilcoran would be. It was a very pretty castle in the air; but in the midst of it, the notion suddenly darted into Mrs. Edmonstone’s head, that while she was thinking of it, it was Amy, not Eveleen, who was constantly with Guy. Reading and music, roses, botany, and walks on the terrace! She looked back, and it was still the same. Last Easter vacation, how they used to study the stars in the evening, to linger in the greenhouse in the morning nursing the geraniums, and to practise singing over the school-room piano; how, in a long walk, they always paired together; and how they seemed to share every pursuit or pleasure.",have good opinion former visit show more spirit improvement lay many little follie put guidance tame give promise sensible woman more observe little addicted match make help think worthy dear expect find think worthy own child other hand delight pretty castle air midst notion dart head think reading music rose botany walk terrace look same last vacation use study star evening linger greenhouse morning nurse geranium practise sing school room piano long walk pair seem share pursuit pleasure 
79,"Now Mrs. Edmonstone was extremely fond of Guy, and trusted him entirely; but she thought she ought to consider how far this should be allowed. Feeling that he ought to see more of the world, she had sent him as much as she could into society, but it had only made him cling closer to home. Still he was but twenty, it was only a country neighbourhood, and there was much more for him to see before he could fairly be supposed to know his own mind. She knew he would act honourably; but she had a horror of letting him entangle himself with her daughter before he was fairly able to judge of his own feelings. Or, if this was only behaving with a brother’s freedom and confidence, Mrs. Edmonstone felt it was not safe for her poor little Amy, who might learn so to depend on him as to miss him grievously when this intimacy ceased, as it must when he settled at his own home. It would be right, while it was still time, to make her remember that they were not brother and sister, and by checking their present happy, careless, confidential intercourse, to save her from the chill which seemed to have been cast on Laura. Mrs. Edmonstone was the more anxious, because she deeply regretted not having been sufficiently watchful in Laura’s case, and perhaps she felt an unacknowledged conviction that if there was real love on Guy’s part, it would not be hurt by a little reserve on Amy’s. Yet to have to speak to her little innocent daughter on such a matter disturbed her so much, that she could hardly have set about it, if Amy had not, at that very moment, knocked at her door.",fond trust think consider allow feel see more world send much society make cling close home country neighbourhood be more see suppose know own mind know act have horror let entangle daughter able judge own feeling behave brother freedom confidence feel safe poor little learn depend miss intimacy cease settle own home right time make remember brother sister check present happy careless confidential intercourse save chill seem cast anxious regret watchful case feel unacknowledged conviction be real love guy part hurt little reserve have speak little innocent daughter matter disturb set very moment knock door

92,"Every word, no matter what, increased the burning of poor Amy’s cheeks. A broad accusation of flirting would have been less distressing to many girls than this mild and delicate warning was to one of such shrinking modesty and maidenly feeling. She had a sort of consciousness that she enjoyed partaking in his pursuits, and this made her sense of confusion and shame overwhelming. What had she been thoughtlessly doing? She could not speak, she could not look. Her mother put her arm round her, and Amy hid her head on her shoulder, and held her fast. Mrs. Edmonstone kissed and caressed the little fluttering bird, then saying, ‘Good night, my own dear child,’ unloosed her embrace.",word matter increase burning poor cheek broad accusation flirting distressing many girl mild delicate warning such shrink modesty feel have sort consciousness enjoy partaking pursuit make sense confusion shame overwhelming do speak look mother put arm hide head shoulder hold kiss caress little flutter bird say good night own dear child unloose embrace

95,"Poor little Amy! what was her dismay as she asked herself, again and again, what she had been doing and what she was to do? The last was plain,--she knew what was right, and do it she must. There would be an end of much that was pleasant, and a fresh glow came over her as she owned how very, very pleasant; but if it was not quite the thing,--if mamma did not approve, so it must be. True, all her doings received their zest from Guy,--her heart bounded at the very sound of his whistle, she always heard his words through all the din of a whole party,--nothing was complete without him, nothing good without his without his approval,--but so much the more shame for her. It was a kind of seeking him which was of all things the most shocking. So there should be an end of it,--never mind the rest! Amy knelt down, and prayed that she might keep her resolution.",poor little dismay ask do do last plain know right do be end much pleasant fresh glow come own pleasant thing mamma approve true doing receive zest heart bound very sound whistle hear word din whole party complete good approval more shame kind seek thing shocking be end mind rest knolt pray keep resolution 
96,"She did not know how much of her severity towards herself was learned from the example that had been two years before her.

97,"The morning gave vigour to her resolution, and when Laura came to ask what mamma thought of their project, Amy looked confused--said she did not know--she believed it would not do. But just then in came her mother, to say she had been considering of the expedition, and meant to join it herself. Amy understood, blushed, and was silently grateful.",morning give vigour resolution come ask mamma think project look confused say know believe do come mother say consider expedition mean join understand blush grateful 
98,"When Laura wanted to alter her demeanour towards Guy, being perfectly cool, and not in the least conscious, she had acted with great judgment, seen exactly what to do, and what to leave undone, so as to keep up appearances. But it was not so with Amy. She was afraid of herself, and was in extremes. She would not come down till the last moment, that there might be no talking in the window. She hardly spoke at breakfast-time, and adhered closely to Laura and Eveleen when they wandered in the garden. Presently Charles looked out from the dressing-room window, calling,--",want alter demeanour guy cool least conscious act great judgment see do leave undone keep appearance afraid extreme come last moment be talking window speak breakfast time adhere wander garden look dress room window calling

101,"The hour for the expedition came, and Amy set off walking with Laura, because Guy was with Mrs. Edmonstone; but presently, after holding open a gate for Charlotte, who was on the donkey, he came up to the sisters, and joined in the conversation. Amy saw something in the hedge--a foxglove, she believed--it would have done as well if it had been a nettle--she stopped to gather it, hoping to fall behind them, but they waited for her. She grew silent, but Guy appealed to her. She ran on to Charlotte and her donkey, but at the next gate Guy had joined company again. At last she put herself under her mother’s wing, and by keeping with her did pretty well all the time she was at East-hill. But when they went on, she was riding the donkey, and it, as donkeys always are, was resolved on keeping a-head of the walkers, so that as Guy kept by her side, it was a more absolute tete-a-tete than ever.",hour expedition come set walk guy hold open gate donkey come sister join conversation see hedge foxglove believe do nettle stop gather hope fall wait grow silent guy appeal run donkey next gate join company last put mother wing keep do time hill go ride donkey donkey resolve keep head walker guy keep side absolute tete tete 
102,"At the top of the hill they found a fine view, rich and extensive, broad woods, fields waving with silvery barley, trim meadows, fair hazy blue distance, and a dim line of sea beyond. This, as Amy knew, was Guy’s delight, and further, what she would not tell herself, was that he chiefly cared for showing it to her. It was so natural to call him to admire everything beautiful, and ask if it was equal to Redclyffe, that she found herself already turning to him to participate in his pleasure, as he pointed out all that was to be seen; but she recollected, blushed, and left her mother to speak. He had much to show. There was a hanging wood on one side of the hill, whence he had brought her more than one botanical prize, and she must now visit their native haunts. It was too great a scramble for Mrs. Edmonstone, with all her good will; Eveleen was to be kept still, and not to tire herself; Laura did not care for botany, nor love brambles, and Amy was obliged to stand and look into the wood, saying, ‘No, thank you, I don’t think I can,’ and then run back to Mary and Charles; while Charlotte was loudly calling out that it was delightful fun, and that she was very stupid. In another minute Guy had overtaken her, and in his gentle, persuasive voice, was telling her it was very easy, and she must come and see the bird’s-nest orchises. She would have liked it above all things, but she thought it very kind of Guy not to seem angry when she said, ‘No, thank you.’",top hill find fine view rich extensive broad wood field wave silvery barley trim meadow fair hazy blue distance dim line sea know delight tell care show natural call admire beautiful ask equal find turn participate pleasure point see recollect blush leave mother speak have much show be hanging wood side hill bring more botanical prize visit native haunt great scramble good will keep tire care botany love bramble oblige stand look wood say thank think run call delightful fun stupid minute overtake gentle persuasive voice tell easy come see bird nest orchise like thing think kind guy seem angry say thank 
103,"Mary, after what she had seen yesterday, could not guess at the real reason, or she would have come with her; but she thought Amy was tired, and would rather not. Poor Amy was tired, very tired, before the walk was over, but her weary looks made it worse, for Guy offered her his arm. ‘No thank you,’ she said, ‘I am getting on very well;’ and she trudged on resolutely, for her mother was in the carriage, and to lag behind the others would surely make him keep with her.",see yesterday guess real reason come think tired poor tired tired walk weary look make bad offer arm thank say get trudge mother carriage le other make keep 
104,"Mrs. Edmonstone was very sorry for her fatigue, but Amy found it a good excuse for not wandering in the garden, or joining in the music. It had been a very uncomfortable day; she hoped she had done right; at any rate, she had the peaceful conviction of having tried to do so.",sorry fatigue find good excuse wonder garden join music uncomfortable day hope do right rate have peaceful conviction try do 
105,"The next day, Amy was steady to her resolution. No reading with the two youths, though Charles scolded her; sitting in her room till Guy was gone out, going indoors as soon as she heard him return, and in the evening staying with Charles when her sisters and cousins went out; but this did not answer, for Guy came and sat by them. She moved away as soon as possible, but the more inclined she was to linger, the more she thought she ought to go; so murmuring something about looking for Laura, she threw on her scarf, and sprung to the window. Her muslin caught on the bolt, she turned, Guy was already disentangling it, and she met his eye. It was full of anxious, pleading inquiry, which to her seemed upbraiding, and, not knowing what to do, she exclaimed, hurriedly, ‘Thank you; no harm done!’ and darted into the garden, frightened to feel her face glowing and her heart throbbing. She could not help looking back to see if he was following. No, he was not attempting it; he was leaning against the window, and on she hastened, the perception dawning on her that she was hurting him; he might think her rude, unkind, capricious, he who had always been so kind to her, and when he was going away so soon. ‘But it is right; it must be done,’ said little Amy to herself, standing still, now that she was out of sight. ‘If I was wrong before, I must bear it now, and he will see the rights of it sooner or later. The worst of all would be my not doing the very _most_ _right_ to please any body. Besides he can’t really care for missing silly little Amy when he has mamma and Charlie. And he is going away, so it will be easier to begin right when he comes back. Be that as it may, it must be done. I’ll get Charlie to tell me what he was saying about the painted glass.’",next day steady resolution reading youth scold sit room guy go go hear return evening stay sister cousin go answer come sit move possible inclined linger more think go murmure look throw scarf spring window muslin catch bolt turn guy disentangle meet eye full anxious plead inquiry seem upbraiding know do exclaim thank harm do dart garden frighten feel face glow heart throbbing help look see follow attempt lean window hasten perception dawn hurt think rude unkind capricious kind go right do say little stand sight wrong bear see right bad do _most_ _right_ please body care miss silly little have mamma go easy begin come do get tell say paint glass
