15,"""No,"" said Eric, ""I don't care. He does come every now and then.""",say care come 
16,"Duncan went to fetch Wildney, and while he was gone, Brie was thinking _why_ he didn't give Vernon the free run of his study. He would not admit to himself the true reason, which was, that he had too much ground to fear that his example would do his brother no good.",go fetch gone think give free run study admit true reason have much ground fear example do brother good 
17,"Eric soon learned to like Wildney, who was a very bright, engaging, spirited boy, with a dash of pleasant impudence about him which took Eric's fancy. He had been one of the most mischievous of the lower fellows, but, although clever, did little or nothing in school, and was in the worst repute with the masters. Until he was ""taken up"" by Eric, he had been a regular little hero among his compeers, because he was game for any kind of mischief, and, in the new tone of popular morality, his fearless disregard of rules made him the object of general admiration. From this time, however, he was much in the studies, and unhappily carried with him to those upper regions the temptation to a deeper and more injurious class of transgressions than had yet penetrated there.",learn like bright engaging spirit boy dash pleasant impudence take fancy mischievous low fellow clever do little school bad repute master take regular little hero compeer game kind mischief new tone popular morality fearless disregard rule make object general admiration time study carry upper region temptation deep injurious class transgression penetrate

25,"""Phew!"" said Eric, ""then I suppose I must smoke too to keep you in countenance;"" and he took a cigar. It was the first time he had touched one since the day at the Stack.

47,"""Hush! then _I_ will,"" and he glided away, while Eric, as quietly as he could, broke away the glass until it was all removed.",glide break glass remove 
48,"""There's only old Stupid,"" whispered he, irreverently designating an under-master named Harley, ""and he's asleep before the fire. Now, then, just lift me up, Eric, will you?""",be old stupid whisper designate master name asleep fire lift 
49,"Eric lifted him, and he removed the nails which fastened the end of the bar. They looked secure enough, and were nails an inch long driven into the mortar; but they had been successfully loosened, and only wanted a little pull to bring them out. In one minute Wildney had unfastened and pushed down one end of the bar. He then got through the broken pane, and dropped down outside. Eric followed with some little difficulty, for the aperture would only just admit his passage; and Duncan, going back to the study, anxiously awaited their return.",lift remove nail fasten end bar look secure nail inch drive mortar loosen want little pull bring minute unfasten push end bar get break pane drop follow little difficulty aperture admit passage go study await return 
50,"It was a bright moonlight night, and the autumn air was pleasant and cool. But Eric's first thought, as he dropped on to the ground, was one of shame that he should suffer his new friend, a mere child, so easily to tempt him into disobedience and sin. He had hardly thought till then of what their errand was to be, but now his couldn't help so strongly disapproving of it, that he was half-inclined to turn back. He did not, however, dare to suggest this, lest Wildney should charge him with cowardice, and betray it to the rest. Besides, the adventure had its own excitement, the stars looked splendid, and the stolen waters were sweet.",bright moonlight night autumn air pleasant cool first thought drop ground shame suffer new friend mere child temp disobedience sin think errand help disapprove half inclined turn dare suggest charge cowardice betray rest adventure have own excitement star look splendid steal water sweet

52,"He was obviously beginning to be afraid, so Eric assumed an air of nonchalance, and played the part of protector.",begin afraid assume air nonchalance play part protector 
53,"""Here, take my arm,"" he said; and as Wildney grasped it tight, instead of feeling angry and ashamed at having been misled by one so much his junior, Eric felt strongly drawn towards him by community of danger and interest. Reaching Ellan, it suddenly struck him that he didn't know where they were going to buy the beer. He asked Wildney.",take arm say grasp tight feel angry ashamed misl junior feel draw community danger interest reach strike know go buy beer ask

And he showed them into a dingy horrid room behind the house, stale with smoke, and begrimed with dust.",say man hateful twinkle eye spree continue wink know way walk back parlor get show dingy horrid room house stale smoke begrime dust

71,"Under a lamp-post, directly opposite them, stood Mr. Rose! He had heard voices and footsteps a moment before, and, puzzled at their sudden cessation in the noiseless street, he was looking round.",lamp post stand hear voice footstep moment puzzle sudden cessation noiseless street look 
72,"""We must run for it,"" whispered Wildney hastily, as Mr. Rose approached the porch; and the two boys took to their heels, and scampered away as hard as they could, Eric helping on Wildney by taking his hand, and neither of them looking behind. They heard Mr. Rose following them at first, but soon distanced him, and reached a place where two roads met, either of which would lead to the school.",run whisper approach porch boy take heel scamper help take hand look hear follow first distance reach place road meet lead school

77,"They had hardly separated when Mr. Rose's step was heard on the stairs. He was just returning from a dinner-party, when the sight of two boys and the sound of their voices startled him in the street, and their sudden disappearance made him sure that they were Roslyn boys, particularly when they began to run. He strongly suspected that he recognised Wildney as one of them, and therefore made straight for his dormitory, which he entered, just as that worthy had thrust the beer-stained trousers under his bed. Mr. Rose, walked up quietly to his bedside, and observed that he was not asleep, and that he still had half has clothes on. He was going away when he saw a little bit of the trousers protruding under the mattress, and giving a pull, out they came, wringing wet with the streams of beer. He could not tell at first what this imported, but a fragment of the bottle fell out of the pocket with, a crash on the floor, and he then discovered. Taking no notice of Wildney's pretended sleep, he said, quietly, ""Come to me before breakfast tomorrow, Wildney,"" and went down stairs.",separate step hear stair return dinner party sight boy sound voice startle street sudden disappearance make sure boy begin run suspect recognise make dormitory enter worthy thrust beer stain trousers bed walk bedside observe asleep have half have clothes go see little bit trousers protrude mattress give pull come wring wet stream beer tell first import fragment bottle fall pocket crash floor discover take notice pretend sleep say come breakfast tomorrow go stair

107,"Next morning Wildney received a severe flogging, but gained great reputation by not betraying his companion, and refusing to drop the least hint as to their means of getting out, or their purpose in visiting Ellan. So the secret of the bar remained undiscovered, and when any boy wanted to get out at night--(unhappily the trick now became common enough)--he had only to break a pane of glass in that particular window, which, as it was in the passage, often remained unmended and undiscovered for weeks.",next morning receive severe flog gain great reputation betray companion refuse drop least hint means get purpose visit secret bar remain undiscovered boy want get night trick become common have break pane glass particular window passage remain unmended undiscovered week

This plague-spot had fretted more deeply than any other into the heart of the school morality, and the least boys seemed the greatest proficients in unbaring without a blush, its hideous ugliness.",repugnance boy seem evaporate appearance swear friend shrink such conversation pursue uncheck presence one bad lose horror afraid ashamed join plague spot fret other heart school morality least boy seem great proficient unbaring blush hideous ugliness
