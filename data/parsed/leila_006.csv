1,CHAPTER V.,
2," Nearly a month had passed rapidly away: Mr. Howard had been much in London during the mornings, selecting furniture for Woodlands, and giving many necessary orders for their future comfort; and Mrs. Stanley had been well pleased to find that the joint example of Selina and Leila appeared to have a beneficial effect on Matilda; the daily lessons went on smoothly and well. Matilda now learned her texts regularly, and after the first few days, had always selected them for herself; and these texts generally evinced, not only a knowledge of her own faults, but a sincere desire to get the better of them: the text for that morning had been, “Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness’ sake, O Lord.”",month pass morning select furniture give many necessary order future comfort pleased find joint example appear have beneficial effect daily lesson go learn text first few day select text evince knowledge own fault sincere desire get good text morning remember sin youth transgression accord mercy remember goodness sake

4,"During this period Woodlands had been frequently visited. Leila had become more and more pleased with the grounds, and the beautiful walks with which it abounded.",period visit become pleased grounds beautiful walk abound 
5,"Mr. Howard had selected a pretty little cottage, near the poultry-yard, for Peggy Dobie, and Leila had had much delight in seeing the China roses, and several pretty creepers, trained on its white walls, and the little garden put in nice order, and well stocked with useful winter vegetables. She had asked the gardener to put up a green turf seat in a warm corner of the garden; he had humbly proposed that it should be in the shade, but Leila said no--that Peggy Dobie always sat in the sun when she watched her bees, and that she said, “The sun was gude baith for bees and bodies, and gladdened her auld heart.”",select little cottage poultry yard have much delight see rose several pretty creeper train white wall little garden put nice order stock useful winter vegetable ask gardener put green turf seat warm corner garden propose shade say sit sun watch bee say sun gude baith bee body gladden auld heart 
6,"Peggy had been allowed time to visit her friends before leaving her country, but the period was now approaching for her arrival, and Leila’s gay spirits were in full flow. Selina, the cat, and one solitary parrot, had been poor substitutes for the loss of all the other favourites; above all, the absence of Dash had been particularly felt and mourned over. “Now,” she said, “I have but a few days to wait, and I can scarce count up all the pleasures that are coming upon me;--Woodlands, and all the Christmas party, with all the friends that I love; and Dash, and Peggy Dobie, and all my birds and turtle-doves again,--joy, nothing but joy.”",allow time visit friend leave country period approach arrival gay spirit full flow cat solitary parrot poor substitute loss other favourite absence feel mourn say have few day wait scarce count pleasure come party friend love bird turtle dove joy joy 
7,"The morning in which Peggy Dobie was to embark with her precious cargo rose calm and bright. The wind, which had been threatening to rise the day before, was completely lulled, and Leila had been rejoicing in the brightness of the day, and had watched the sun go down in golden splendour. Later in the evening, however, the wind began to rise again, but not so as at all to alarm her, and Leila’s tranquil sleep was unbroken by the coming storm, the loud howling of the blast amidst the trees, and the sound of distant thunder--it was a fearful night. Mr. Howard had more than once left his bed to look out upon the scene of desolation, for the ground was strewed with branches from the trees, and the clouds were driving before the wind with unceasing velocity. It recalled to his mind that dreadful night when he seemed about to part with all most dear to him, and though deeply grateful for the present safety of one so loved, he yet felt painfully anxious for those that might now be in similar circumstances. The good old woman too, whom he had been the means of removing from her quiet home, he thought what Leila’s grief would be, and his own regrets, if aught of ill befell her. Of all this threatened danger Leila was in ignorance till awakened next morning by Nurse: her face of dismay Leila was too sleepy to observe, but her words were startling.",morning embark precious cargo rise calm bright wind threaten rise day lull rejoice brightness day watch sun go golden splendour evening wind begin rise alarm tranquil sleep unbroken come storm loud howling blast tree sound distant thunder fearful night have more leave bed look scene desolation ground strew branch tree cloud drive wind uncease velocity recall mind dreadful night seem about part dear grateful present safety love feel anxious similar circumstance good old woman means remove quiet home think grief own regret aught ill befell threaten danger ignorance awaken next morning face dismay sleepy observe word startling

9,"“What is it, Nurse?” Leila cried, starting up and rubbing her eyes; “are they arrived?--but no; that is not possible; they cannot arrive for two days yet. What has happened? why do you look so? Oh, tell me!”",cry start rub eye arrive possible arrive day happen look tell 
10,"“Calm yourself, my dear Miss Leila. It was not like my usual prudence to frighten you in this way; but did you not hear the awful wind in the night? listen to it now, how it roars.”",calm dear usual prudence frighten way hear awful wind night listen roar 
11,"Leila was out of bed in a moment, and gazing from the window. The lawn was strewed with leaves and branches from the trees; one branch lay across the doorway, so very large, it seemed an entire tree. She shuddered. Mr. Howard entered the room at this moment, and lifting her in his arms, he replaced her in bed, and sat down beside her.",bed moment gaze window lawn strew leave branch tree branch lay doorway large seem entire tree shudder enter room moment lift arm replace bed sit 
12,"Leila’s long dark eyelashes were wet with tears; her cheeks were very pale, and she trembled violently. Mr. Howard stooped down and kissed her forehead.",long dark eyelashe wet tear cheek pale tremble stoop kiss forehead 
13,"“You were wrong to leave your bed, my child, you are very cold--and cold also, I fear, from excessive agitation. Now, dear Leila, give me a proof this day that you are endeavouring to gain more command over your feelings, and let me see that you do not give way to what are, I trust, unnecessary fears.”",wrong leave bed child cold cold fear excessive agitation dear give proof day endeavour gain more command feeling let see give way trust unnecessary fear 
14,"“Unnecessary?” she replied, in a low voice. “Papa, do you remember Clara?”",unnecessary reply low voice remember 
15,"“Yes, my dear child, I do remember; but I remember also that there is _One_ whose arm is mighty to save. He can say to the angry waves, ‘Be still;’ and without his knowledge ‘not a sparrow falls to the ground.’ He took Clara to Himself, and He saved us from further trial. He willed it so--let us trust to Him entirely. He alone, who knows the end from the beginning, can make all work together for good.”",dear child remember remember be arm mighty save say angry wave knowledge sparrow fall ground take save further trial will let trust know end beginning make work good 
16,"Leila hastily brushed the tears from her eyes, and laid her little hand on her papa’s. Mr. Howard started, it was so very cold; but she struggled for composure, and said in a calm voice,----“Yes, papa, I will try to think of all this, and my text for to-day shall be, ‘The waves of the sea are mighty and rage horribly, but yet the Lord who dwelleth on high is mightier: for He maketh the storm to cease, so that the waves thereof are still.’ Now kiss me, papa, and please send Amy to help me to dress, and when I have been to your room to say my prayers and to read to you, I am sure I shall feel quite comforted again, and you shall see that I am getting command, papa.”",brush tear eye lay little hand papa start cold struggle composure say calm voice papa try think text day wave sea mighty rage dwelleth high mighty maketh storm cease wave kiss papa send help dress room say prayer read sure feel comfort see get command papa 
17,"Leila kept her promise. Not a moment did she give way to outward emotion, but during that day many an anxious expression passed over her sweet face, for the storm continued to rage fearfully, and the party were constantly startled from their seats by the crashing sound of some large branch from the surrounding trees. These creaking and crashing sounds constantly brought a frightful moment to Leila’s imagination, and no one was without anxiety, for it was impossible to believe but that such a storm must bring disastrous consequences to many an anxious heart. Selina seldom left Leila’s side for a moment, and made constant efforts to draw her into conversation; and Matilda, as every fresh gust of wind arose, exerted herself in every way she could think of to distract her attention from the scene without. Later in the day it began to rain heavily, and the wind fell, and towards evening the sky cleared, and the moon shone out so bright, so calm, its mild rays shed instant peace and hope into Leila’s young heart, and she lay down to sleep with many bright anticipations of the morrow.",keep promise moment give way outward emotion day many anxious expression pass sweet face storm continue rage party startle seat crash sound large branch surround tree creaking crashing sound bring frightful moment imagination anxiety impossible believe storm bring disastrous consequence many anxious heart leave side moment make constant effort draw conversation fresh gust wind arise exert way think distract attention scene day begin rain wind fall evening sky clear moon shine bright calm mild ray shed instant peace hope young heart lay sleep many bright anticipation morrow 
18,"The morrow came, the lawn looked fresh and green, all traces of the storm had been removed, and every surrounding object seemed rejoicing in the sunshine. Leila proposed that after the lessons they should walk with Nurse and Amy to Woodlands to see if all was in order in Peggy Dobie’s cottage for her reception in the evening.",come lawn look fresh green trace storm remove surround object seem rejoice sunshine propose lesson walk see order cottage reception evening 
19,"“I am sorry,” she said, “that she is not to arrive here at first with my pets, for we cannot know the very moment, and it will take some time for Bill to send us the message. How nice it would be if we had a carrier-pigeon, papa, then it could fly to us in a moment; when we are staying at Woodlands, perhaps you will allow me to teach a carrier-pigeon, then I can send letters to Selina and Matilda whenever I wish to tell them any thing. Eh, papa? is not this a nice little plan? But you have not answered me yet if we may go to Woodlands.”",sorry say arrive first pet know very moment take time send message nice have carrier pigeon papa fly moment stay allow teach carrier pigeon send letter wish tell thing nice little plan answer go 
20,"“Why, my dear child, so many nice little plans from you come popping out, one after another, that it is not easy to answer them all; but I have no objections to your going to Woodlands, only remember, Leila, that it is not at all certain that Peggy will arrive this evening; the steamboat will probably have been detained by the storm.”",dear child many nice little plan come popp easy answer have objection go remember certain arrive evening steamboat detain storm 
21,"“Well, papa, I will try to be very patient; but I don’t think it will be detained; I think that perhaps the wind will have blown it on much quicker; so we must be quick also. You know, papa, you say we must not anticipate evils, or give way to imaginary fears, eh, papa?”",try patient think detain think wind blow quick quick know say anticipate evil give way imaginary fear papa 
22,"“Get along, little woman,” was all Mr. Howard’s answer, as he patted her head, and the next moment she was gone.",get little woman answer patt head next moment gone 
23,"As soon as the lessons were over, the young party proceeded merrily on their way to Woodlands. They soon reached the lodge, and found Bill at his post, who opened the gates, and gave them entrance with the greatest alacrity; and when informed of their intention to visit Peggy Dobie’s cottage, took down a large key that hung behind his own door, and prepared to lead the way. He would not hear of Nurse’s proposal to save him that trouble. “What!” he said, “was he not proud to do that small service for his master’s daughter, or any of her friends--he hoped to do many a greater service than that for the family ere long.”",lesson young party proceed way reach lodge find post open gate give entrance great alacrity inform intention visit cottage take large key hang own door prepare lead way hear proposal save trouble say proud do small service master daughter friend hope do many great service family long 
24,"They were all much pleased with the perfect order in which they found every thing around the cottage, and still more delighted with all within. Mr. Howard had indeed done his part; the little bed-room looked so comfortable, with its nice tidy bed in one corner, its chest of drawers, its white deal table, with basin, ewer, &c., all, in short, was complete. And then the kitchen--the kitchen was a picture indeed; there stood the pretty chairs, and the small round table of walnut-tree, looking so bright, which Leila had entreated her papa to procure for Peggy. In a corner next the latticed window, was a small cupboard with a glass door, showing such pretty cups, saucers, and glasses within, as could not fail soon to become the pride of Peggy’s heart. Above the small dresser there were shelves with plates, and dishes, and bowls, and mugs innumerable, and close by the door a cuckoo clock was ticking cheerily. They all looked round in perfect ecstasies.",pleased perfect order find thing cottage delight do part little bed room look comfortable nice tidy bed corner chest drawer white deal table basin ewer &c. short complete kitchen kitchen picture stand pretty chair small round table walnut tree look bright entreat papa procure corner latticed window small cupboard glass door show such pretty cup saucer glasses fail become pride heart small dresser be shelf plate dish bowl mug innumerable door cuckoo clock tick look perfect ecstasie 
25,"“It is most delightful,” Leila exclaimed; “there is just one thing that could be better, this arm-chair for Peggy should be turned round to the hearth, a cat should be lying before it, and a nice fire burning. Were you able to find peats in this country?” she said, turning to Bill; “you know I begged you to try.”",delightful exclaim be thing good arm chair turn hearth cat lie nice fire burning able find peat country say turn know begg try 
26,"“Yes, yes,” Matilda said, “he did find them--I saw them in a box behind the door.” She was off in a moment, and returned with a couple in her hand.",say find see box door moment return couple hand 
27,"“Now, Nurse, dear Nurse,” Leila said, coaxingly, “do let me light Peggy’s first fire myself--you know how very kind she was to me; now there’s a good Nurse, I see you are going to let me--you have your good-natured face on, though you are shaking your head; but I know what you mean by shaking it--you think I shall dirty my hands, and that is not a young lady’s work; but peats don’t dirty the hands--I am only going to put on peats and wood, you know.”",dear say let light first fire know kind be good nurse see go let have good natured face shake head know mean shake think dirty hand young lady work peat dirty hand go put peat wood know

29,"“But, Nurse, you know you say yourself that I should not have useless hands and be a fine lady. There, now I see it is yes by your eyes. Matilda, give me that match-box from the chimney-piece.” She was on her knees on the hearth, and had struck a light in a moment.",know say have useless hand fine lady see eye give match box chimney piece knee hearth strike light moment 
30,"“Now, Selina, take the bellows, and blow very gently while I am crumbling down a little of the peat; that’s it. Oh, how nice! See what a blaze already--now for the wood; we must put the wood behind, and more peats in the front--how it burns! is not this charming?”",take bellow blow crumble little peat nice see blaze wood put wood more peat front burn charming 
31,"Bill stood looking on in mute astonishment. “Well,” he said at last, “desert island, or _no desert island_, you are a handy little miss; see when a London young lady would have kindled a fire in such a fashion,--but you seem all of one stamp. Heaven be praised for such a family.”",stand look mute astonishment say last desert island desert handy little miss see young lady kindle fire fashion seem stamp heaven praise family 
32,"“There is still one thing wanting,” Leila said, “still the cat. Peggy will not think herself at home without a cat upon the hearth. You are so good-natured,” she continued, looking up in Bill’s face, “perhaps you would be so very kind as to give us your cat, just for one day, till Peggy has time to unpack her own.”",be thing want say cat think home cat hearth good natured continue look face kind give cat day have time unpack own 
33,"Bill smiled. “There is nothing in my house that I would not give,” he replied, “to pleasure my young mistress; but, bless your heart, the cats in our country would never abide on a strange hearth. Our cat would be through the window in no time, I am afeared.”",smile be house give reply pleasure young mistress bless heart cat country abide strange hearth cat window time afeared 
34,"“It was very foolish in me to propose this,” Leila answered, “for I dare say all cats are the same, and our Selina almost mewed her heart out when she was first put into the ship--she can’t bear strange places either.”",foolish propose answer say cat same mew heart put ship bear strange place 
35,"Once more she looked around the room to see if all was perfect; the small latticed window with the China-roses clustering in about it, she was sure would delight Peggy, for Peggy was so fond of flowers; might they not gather a few and make a nosegay for the middle of the table. The next moment they were all in the little garden--the flowers were quickly gathered and arranged, and after giving Bill many injunctions to be so very kind as to step up frequently and put more wood on the fire, and also to be quite sure to send off a quick messenger the very moment Peggy and the pets entered the gates, they left the cottage.",more look room see perfect small latticed window rose cluster sure delight fond flower gather few make nosegay middle table next moment little garden flower gather arrange give many injunction kind step put more wood fire sure send quick messenger very moment pet enter gate leave cottage 
36,"They had not time to enter the house at Woodlands, where all with regard to furnishing had been going on prosperously, but they had seen what had been done there more than once. Leila had thought it all beautiful, but she had a simple taste; she really did not like fine things, and her only request with regard to the furnishing had been, “Nothing fine in my room, papa--please, nothing fine; just a nice little bed with white dimity curtains, and a large sea-grass mat under my little washhand-stand, for I don’t like to wash and dash and splash on a Brussels carpet.”",have time enter house regard furnishing go see do more think beautiful have simple taste like fine thing only request regard furnishing fine room papa fine nice little bed white dimity curtain large sea grass mat little washhand stand like wash dash splash carpet 
37,"The rest of the day passed in pleasant expectation, but towards evening the young people got very restless indeed, and little Alfred was perpetually popping out at the door and running a little way down the gravel walk, in the hope of meeting some one from Woodlands, and bringing the first intelligence; but no carrier-pigeon or swift messenger of any kind arrived; and at a later hour than usual the young people retired to rest, disappointed, but not alarmed. To-morrow was a new day, and to-morrow would bring all they wished. But to-morrow came; it was a long trying day of expectation, and still no tidings were received. It was with great difficulty that they could attend at all to their lessons; but Mrs. Stanley was very indulgent, and repeated most of them herself; and the moment they were over, she despatched them all to count over their clothes, and to put their drawers in order; to be busy and active was what she particularly required of them on that long, long day. It came to an end at last, and they went early to bed; but Mr. Howard had now become seriously uneasy, and next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, went to London to inquire at the steamboat office if they had received any intelligence with regard to the “Victoria.”",rest day pass pleasant expectation evening young person get restless little popp door run little way gravel walk hope meet one bring first intelligence carrier pigeon swift messenger kind arrive late hour usual young person retire rest disappointed alarm new day bring wish come long try day expectation tiding receive great difficulty attend lesson indulgent repeat most moment despatch count clothes put drawer order busy active require long long day come end last go bed become uneasy next morning breakfast go inquire steamboat office receive intelligence regard 
38,Leila’s face quite brightened as she saw him depart; the very idea that he would bring back intelligence quite raised her spirits; she never for a moment dreaded that this intelligence might not be favourable.,face brighten see depart very idea bring intelligence raise spirit moment dread intelligence favourable 
39,"Mr. Howard returned sooner than was expected, but he had learned nothing. Neither the Victoria, nor the other steamboat which had sailed on the same day, had come in, and the owners were in much anxiety, as there were reports of several wrecks on the coast. This last part of the intelligence received, Mr. Howard did not communicate to Leila, but he looked anxious, and she knew his face too well not to feel considerable alarm. Next day he again went to London. Mrs. Stanley saw it would be too much to ask any of them to attend to their lessons; Leila was beginning to have a pale, exhausted look, she therefore gave Selina a book of natural history to read to them aloud, while the other two worked by the window. Poor Leila, she did not listen much. She worked very little, and looked out a great deal; after some hours horses’ hoofs were heard on the gravel walk; she saw her papa alight at the door; her heart beat violently; she felt unable to move; he looked up and smiled; she could not read that smile; it was sweet as usual, for when was his smile ever otherwise when it rested on her? But it was a melancholy smile. He entered the room, they all clustered round him.",return expect learn other steamboat sail same day come owner much anxiety be report several wreck coast last part intelligence receive communicate look anxious know face feel considerable alarm next day go see much ask attend lesson begin have pale exhaust look give book natural history read other work window poor listen much work little look great deal hour horse hoof hear gravel walk see papa door heart beat feel unable move look smile read smile sweet usual smile rest melancholy smile enter room cluster 
40,"“The Victoria has come in,” he said.",come say 
41,"Leila clapped her hands. “My pets, my pets,” she cried; “and Dash, and Peggy Dobie--all--ALL safe!”",clapp hand pet pet cry safe 
42,"“Dear child,” Mr. Howard continued, looking anxiously at her, “dear child, your pets are safe, but Dash and Peggy--” he stopped.",dear child continue look dear child pet safe stop 
43,"“What of them, papa? Oh tell me, tell me quick--why do you look so grieved?”",papa tell tell look grieve 
44,"Mr. Howard drew her towards him. “Try to calm yourself, my beloved child, for you have much to bear. Peggy and Dash are not in the Victoria; they have not been seen since the night of the storm.”",draw try calm beloved child have much bear see night storm 
45,"“But how is that possible, papa? It cannot be, they were in the ship--oh, yes they were. I cannot understand what you mean. I am not very frightened; say it all out quick.”",possible papa ship understand mean frighten say 
46,"Mr. Howard then went on to say that he had not been able to see the captain, and had got but a confused account from two of the sailors, but that both agreed in the same story. The storm had been most fearful; they had anchored that dreadful night off Scarborough, but with little hope of being able to keep their anchor. They expected every moment to be driven on the shore. The passengers in the fore cabin were too much frightened to keep below as they were advised and entreated to do. A heavy sea had swept the deck, and several of them were swept overboard. Peggy, with Dash by her side, had been seen on deck the moment before by both these sailors. The night was frightfully dark, the sea running mountain high; to save any of them was impossible. Next morning both Peggy and Dash were amongst those missing.",go say able see captain get confused account sailor agree same story storm fearful anchore dreadful night little hope able keep anchor expect moment drive shore passenger fore cabin frighten keep advise entreat do heavy sea sweep deck several sweep side see deck moment sailor night dark sea running mountain high save impossible next morning miss 
47,"Leila for a moment did not utter a word, she grew deadly pale, then throwing her arms round her papa’s neck, she cried, “Lost to me, lost to me for ever! Oh, poor Peggy, and my dear, dear Dash--my dearest friend--” but seeing her papa’s look of distress, she stopped, then continued, “I am wrong, very, very wrong; I am vexing you. Peggy herself said, if the dearest was left, if she had him to love and him to listen to--and have I not you, papa, and are you not my dearest one, and so many besides to love?” and she drew Selina towards her, and with her pocket-handkerchief she wiped Selina’s eyes, then went on, “and it is bad in me to be so sorry for Dash--for poor Peggy is a human being--but Dash, my own Dash, and twice he saved my life.” She covered her face with her hands and sobbed violently.",moment utter word grow deadly pale throw arm papa neck cry lose lose poor dear dear dearest friend see papa look distress stop continue wrong wrong vex say dearest leave have love listen papa dearest one many love draw pocket handkerchief wipe eye go bad sorry poor human being own save life cover face hand sobb 
48,"Mr. Howard did not attempt to console her or to stop her tears; he lifted her gently in his arms, and laying her on the sofa, sat down beside her, clasping her hand in his.",attempt console stop tear lift arm lay sofa sit clasp hand 
49,"After some time she became more calm; she lifted his hand to her lips and kissed it, then shutting her eyes she in a few minutes dropped asleep; it was but a troubled sleep, but all were thankful that it had brought forgetfulness for the present. After some time she awoke with a sudden start, slowly she remembered all. Sad memories they were which clouded her sweet face, and tears again filled her eyes, but brushing them hastily away, she said, in a low voice, “The great trial has come to me at last, and I must bear it, but God will help me.” Then rising from the sofa she slowly left the room.",time become calm lift hand lip kiss shut eye few minute drop asleep troubled sleep thankful bring forgetfulness present time awoke sudden start remember sad memory cloude sweet face tear fill eye brush say low voice great trial come last bear help rise sofa leave room

51,"Anxious to see the captain of the Victoria, and if possible to obtain more intelligence, Mr. Howard, on the following morning, again went to London, but to his disappointment found that the vessel had sailed on her downward passage a few hours before. A gentleman came into the office while he was there to inquire for one of his trunks which was missing, and Mr. Howard found he had been a passenger in the Victoria. He said he had been much at sea, but had only once before been out in a similar storm; that their escape had been most providential, as several vessels near them had been driven on shore. The frightful accident which had taken place had thrown a heavy gloom on all; their being unable to render any assistance had been heart-rending; it was a moment, he said, he never could forget, but the darkness of the night and the violence of the storm had rendered all attempts impossible. Not half an hour after the wind had fallen in some degree for a short time, and a boat had put off from the shore; some of the passengers had taken advantage of this, and had left the vessel; but it seemed to him as if no boat could live in such a sea, and he had, after some hesitation, resolved to abide by the ship.",anxious see captain possible obtain more intelligence follow morning go disappointment find vessel sail downward passage few hour gentleman come office inquire trunk miss find passenger say much sea similar storm escape providential several vessel drive shore frightful accident take place throw heavy gloom unable render assistance heart rending moment say forget darkness night violence storm render attempt impossible hour wind fall degree short time boat put shore passenger take advantage leave vessel seem boat live sea hesitation resolve abide ship

53,"“He spoke of Dash, my love, with much regret; he said he was a most noble animal. He seemed not to be aware to whom it belonged.”",speak love much regret say noble animal seem aware belong 
54,"Leila sighed heavily. “A most noble animal; yes, he was noble, every body loved Dash.” Then taking her papa’s hand, she looked anxiously up in his face, and said, “Dash could swim so well; do you think, papa, there is any----” She stopped.",sigh noble animal noble body love take papa hand look face say swim think be stop 
55,"“Any hope, you would say, my love; I fear, Leila, we must not trust to it, but the same idea struck me, and before I left town I wrote an advertisement, fully describing Dash, and giving our address; and this I sent to the ‘Times’ newspaper office.”",hope say love fear trust same idea strike leave town write advertisement describe give address send newspaper office 
56,"“Oh, thank you, thank you, dear papa,” and she hastily walked to the window and looked out. She was determined not again to give way.",thank thank dear walk window look determined give way 
57,"Leila’s naturally buoyant spirits did not long remain much depressed; still the sudden shock, after all her bright anticipations, had been so great, that it left evident traces in her appearance, and when any accidental circumstance recalled the late events, a pang of such acute sorrow shot through her frame as it greatly pained Mr. Howard to witness, and he was not sorry that neither Mr. and Mrs. Herbert nor the Selbys had accepted his invitation for Christmas; the Selbys had a family party that day, and the Herberts were on a tour of visits; both parties, however, promised to be at Woodlands soon after Christmas, and Mr. Herbert added, that if Mr. Howard would allow him, he would be glad to introduce to him his son, who would be at home for the holidays. Christmas-day, therefore, would be spent in a manner more congenial to the tone of their present feelings; and Mr. Howard arranged that they should not remove to Woodlands till a few days before, when Leila could have the comfort of having her uncle and aunt and her cousins with her.",buoyant spirit remain depressed sudden shock bright anticipation great leave evident trace appearance accidental circumstance recall late event pang such acute sorrow shoot frame pain witness sorry accept invitation have family party day tour visit party promise add allow glad introduce son home holiday day spend manner congenial tone present feeling arrange remove few day have comfort have uncle aunt cousin 
58,"The meeting with her pets again had been very trying to Leila, and still more so was her first visit to Peggy Dobie’s cottage; Susan, Bill’s wife, had been employed to take charge of her pets for the present, till some one could be found to fill the situation, and the cottage had continued locked up. Matilda had in vain tried to dissuade Leila from making this visit, but she said she felt sure she would feel better when it was over, and she thought of it so much; and Selina seemed to be of the same opinion. It appeared as yesterday when she had been there before, but with what different feelings! there stood the glass with the withered flowers, on the little table, and the wood-ashes lay cold upon the hearth. Leila gazed earnestly on every object which before had given her such delight; the tears ran silently down her cheeks, there was no violent emotion. She turned Peggy’s own chair from the hearth, and placed it against the wall, then left the cottage followed by Selina and Matilda. She was certainly better after all this was over, yet there were feelings which did not soon leave her; she could not help remembering, with self-accusation, that her papa had only yielded to Peggy’s removal to England in consequence of her entreaties; he had at first represented to her that at Peggy’s time of life it were wiser to leave her in her own country, and probably more for her happiness to do so; but Leila had been carried away too much by her own wishes in this instance to practise the lesson of self-sacrifice which her papa so often inculcated; she now felt this deeply, and it was a lesson not lost upon her.",meeting pet try first visit cottage wife employ take charge pet present one find fill situation cottage continue lock vain try dissuade make visit say feel sure feel good think seem same opinion appear yesterday different feeling stand glass wither flower little table wood ash lay cold hearth gaze object give such delight tear run cheek be violent emotion turn own chair hearth place wall leave cottage follow good be feeling leave help remember self accusation papa yield removal consequence entreaty represent time life wise leave own country more happiness do carry much own wish instance practise lesson self sacrifice papa inculcate feel lesson lose
