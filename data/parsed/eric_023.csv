4,"Next evening, when preparation began, Pietrie and Graham got everything ready for a carouse in their class-room. Wildney, relying on the chance of names not being called over (which, was only done in case any one's absence was observed), had absented himself altogether from the boarders' room, and helped busily to spread the table for the banquet. The cook had roasted for them the fowls and pigeons, and Billy had brought an ample supply of beer and some brandy for the occasion. A little before eight o'clock everything was ready, and Eric, Attlay, and Llewellyn were summoned to join the rest.",next evening preparation begin get ready carouse class -room rely chance name call do case one absence observe absent border room help spread table banquet cook roast fowl pigeon bring ample supply beer brandy occasion little o'clock ready summon join rest 
5,"The fowls, pigeons, and beer had soon vanished, and the boys were in the highest spirits. Eric's reckless gaiety was kindled by Wildney's frolicsome vivacity, and Graham's sparkling wit; they were all six in a roar of perpetual laughter at some fresh sally of fun elicited by the more phlegmatic natures of Attlay or Llewellyn, and the dainties of Wildney's parcel were accompanied by draughts of brandy and water, which were sometimes exchanged for potations of the raw liquor. It was not the first time, be it remembered, that the members of that young party had been present at similar scenes, and even the scoundrel Billy was astonished, and alarmed occasionally at the quantities of spirits and other inebriating drinks that of late had found their way to the studies. The disgraceful and deadly habit of tippling had already told physically on both Eric and Wildney. The former felt painfully that he was losing his clear-headedness, and that his intellectual tastes were getting not only blunted but destroyed; and while he perceived in himself the terrible effects of his sinful indulgence, he saw them still more indisputably in the gradual coarseness which seemed to be spreading, like a grey lichen, over the countenance, the mind, and the manners of his younger companion. Sometimes the vision of a Nemesis breaking in fire out of his darkened future, terrified his guilty conscience in the watches of the night; and the conviction of some fearful Erynnis, some discovery dawning out of the night of his undetected sins, made his heart beat fast with agony and fear. But he fancied it too late to repent. He strangled the half-formed resolutions as they rose, and trusted to the time when, by leaving school, he should escape, as he idly supposed, the temptations to which he had yielded. Meanwhile, the friends who would have rescued him had been alienated by his follies, and the principles which might have preserved him had been eradicated by his guilt. He had long flung away the shield of prayer, and the helmet of holiness, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; and now, unarmed and helpless, Eric stood alone, a mark for the fiery arrows of his enemies, while, through the weakened inlet of every corrupted sense, temptation rushed in upon him perpetually and unawares.",fowl pigeon beer vanish boy high spirit reckless gaiety kindle frolicsome vivacity sparkling wit roar perpetual laughter fresh sally fun elicite phlegmatic nature dainty parcel accompany draught brandy water exchange potation raw liquor first time remember member young party present similar scene scoundrel astonished alarm quantity spirit other inebriate drink late find way study disgraceful deadly habit tippling tell former feel lose clear headedness intellectual taste blunt destroy perceive terrible effect sinful indulgence see gradual coarseness seem spread grey lichen countenance mind manners young companion vision break fire darken future terrify guilty conscience watch night conviction fearful discovery dawn night undetected sin make heart beat agony fear fancy late repent strangle half form resolution rise trust time leave school escape suppose temptation yield friend rescue alienate follie principle preserve eradicate guilt flung shield prayer helmet holiness sword word unarmed helpless stand mark fiery arrow enemy weaken inlet corrupt sense temptation rush unawares 
6,"As the class-room they had selected was in a remote part of the building, there was little immediate chance of detection. So the laughter of the party grew louder and sillier; the talk more foolish and random; the merriment more noisy and meaningless. But still most of them mingled some sense of caution with their enjoyment, and warned Eric and Wildney more than once that they must look out, and not take too much that night for fear of being caught. But it was Wildney's birth-day, and Eric's boyish mirth, suppressed by his recent troubles, was blazing out unrestrained. In the riot of their feasting, the caution had been utterly neglected, and the boys were far from being sober when the sound of the prayer-bell ringing through the great hall, startled them into momentary consciousness.",class room select remote part building be little immediate chance detection laughter party grow louder silly talk foolish random merriment noisy meaningless most mingle sense caution enjoyment warn more look take much night fear catch birth day boyish mirth suppress recent trouble blaze unrestrained riot feasting caution neglect boy sober sound prayer bell ring great hall startle momentary consciousness 
7,"""Good heavens!"" shouted Graham, springing up; ""there's the prayer-bell; I'd no notion it was so late. Here, let's shove these brandy bottles and things into the cupboards and drawers, and then we must run down.""",good heaven shout spring be prayer bell notion late let shove brandy bottle thing cupboard drawer run 
8,"There was no time to lose. The least muddled of the party had cleared the room in a moment, and then addressed themselves to the more difficult task of trying to quiet Eric and Wildney, and conduct them steadily into the prayer-room.",be time lose least muddled party clear room moment address difficult task try quiet conduct prayer room 
9,"Wildney's seat was near the door, so there was little difficulty in getting him to his place comparatively unobserved. Llewellyn took him by the arm, and after a little stumbling, helped him safely to his seat, where he assumed a look of preternatural gravity. But Eric sat near the head of the first table, not far from Dr. Rowlands' desk, and none of the others had to go to that part of the room. Graham grasped his arm tight, led him carefully down stairs, and, as they were reaching the door, said to him, in a most earnest and imploring tone--""Do try and walk sensibly to your place, Eric, or we shall all be caught.""",seat door be little difficulty get place unobserve take arm little stumbling help seat assume look preternatural gravity sit head first table desk other have go part room grasp arm lead stair reach door say earnest implor tone try walk place catch 
10,"It was rather late when they got down. Everybody was quietly seated, and most of the Bibles were already open, although the Doctor had not yet come in. Consequently, the room was still, and the entrance of Graham and Eric after the rest attracted general notice. Eric had just sense enough to try and assume his ordinary manner; but he was too giddy with the fumes of drink to walk straight, or act naturally.",late get seat most open come room entrance rest attract general notice sense try assume ordinary manner giddy fume drink walk act 
11,"Vernon was sitting next to Wright, and stared at his brother with great eyes and open lips. He was not the only observer.",sit stare brother great eye open lip only observer 
12,"""Wright,"" whispered he, in a timid voice; ""just see how Eric walks. What can be the matter with him? Good gracious, he must be ill!"" he said, starting up, as Eric suddenly made a great stagger to one side, and nearly fell in the attempt to recover himself.",whisper timid voice see walk matter good gracious ill say start make great stagger side fall attempt recover

14,"""Hush!"" he whispered; ""take no notice; he's been drinking, Verny, and I fear he'll be caught.""",whisper take notice drink fear catch 
15,"Vernon instantly sat down, and turned deadly pale. He thought, and he had hoped, that since the day at the ""Jolly Herring,"" his brother had abandoned all such practices, for Eric had been most careful to conceal from him the worst of his failings. And now he trembled violently with fear for his discovery, and horror at his disgraceful condition.",sit turn deadly pale think hope day jolly brother abandon such practice careful conceal bad failing tremble fear discovery horror disgraceful condition 
16,"The sound of Eric's unsteady footsteps had made Mr. Rose quickly raise his head; but at the same moment Duncan hastily made room for the boy on the seat beside him, and held out his hand to assist him. It was not Eric's proper place; but Mr. Rose, after one long look of astonishment, looked down at his book again, and said nothing.",sound unsteady footstep make raise head same moment make room boy seat hold hand assist proper place long look astonishment look book say 
17,It made other hearts besides Vernon's ache to see the unhappy boy roll to his place in that helpless way.,make other heart ache see unhappy boy roll place helpless way 
18,"Dr. Rowlands came in, and prayers commenced. When they were finished, the names were called, and Eric, instead of quietly answering his ""adsum,"" as he should have done, stood up, with a foolish look, and said, ""Yes, Sir."" The head master looked at him for a minute; the boy's glassy eyes, and jocosely stupid appearance, told an unmistakable tale; but Dr. Rowlands only remarked, ""Williams, you don't look well. You had better go at once to bed.""",come prayer commence finish name call answer adsum do stand foolish look say head master look minute boy glassy eye stupid appearance tell unmistakable tale remark look have good go bed 
19,"It was hopeless for Eric to attempt getting along without help, so Duncan at once got up, took him by the arm, and with much difficulty (for Eric staggered at every step) conducted him to his bed-room.",hopeless attempt get help get take arm much difficulty stagger step conduct bed room 
20,"Wildney's condition was also too evident; and Mr. Rose, while walking up and down the dormitories, had no doubt left on his mind that both Eric and Wildney had been drinking. But he made no remarks to them, and merely went to the Doctor to talk over the steps which were to be taken.",condition evident walk dormitory have doubt leave mind drink make remark go talk step take 
21,"""I shall summon the school,"" said Dr. Rowlands, ""on Monday, and by that time we will decide on the punishment. Expulsion, I fear, is the only course open to us.""",summon school say time decide punishment expulsion fear only course open

23,"""Perhaps; but the offence is of the worst character I must consider the matter.""",offence bad character consider matter 
24,"""Poor Williams!"" sighed Mr. Rose, as he left the room.",poor sigh leave room 
25,"The whole of the miserable Sunday that followed was spent by Eric and his companions in vain inquiries and futile restlessness. It seemed clear that two of them at least were detected, and they were inexpressibly wretched with anxiety and suspense. Wildney, who had to stay in bed, was even more depressed; his head ached violently, and he was alone with his own terrified thoughts. He longed for the morrow, that at least he might have the poor consolation of knowing his fate. No one came near him all day. Eric wished to do so, but as he could not have visited the room without express leave, the rest dissuaded him from asking, lest he should excite further suspicion. His apparent neglect made poor Wildney even more unhappy, for Wildney loved Eric as much as it was possible for his volatile mind to love any one; and it seemed hard to be deserted in the moment of disgrace and sorrow by so close a friend.",whole miserable follow spend companion vain inquiry futile restlessness seem clear least detect wretch anxiety suspense have stay bed depressed head ach alone own terrified thought long morrow least have poor consolation know fate come day wish do visit room express leave rest dissuade ask excite further suspicion apparent neglect make poor unhappy love much possible volatile mind love one seem hard desert moment disgrace sorrow close friend 
26,"At school the next morning the various masters read out to their forms a notice from Dr. Rowlands, that the whole school were to meet at ten in the great schoolroom. The object of the summons was pretty clearly understood; and few boys had any doubt that it had reference to the drinking on Saturday night. Still nothing had been _said_ on the subject as yet; and every guilty heart among those 250 boys beat fast lest _his_ sin too should have been discovered, and he should be called out for some public and heavy punishment.",school next morning various master read form notice whole school meet great schoolroom object summons understand few boy have doubt have reference drinking night _said_ subject guilty heart boy beat fast lest sin discover call public heavy punishment 
27,"The hour arrived. The boys thronging into the great school-room, took their places according to their respective forms. The masters in their caps and gowns were all seated on a small semicircular bench at the upper end of the room, and in the centre of them, before a small table, sate Dr. Rowlands.",hour arrive boy throng great school room take place accord respective form master cap gown seat small semicircular bench upper end room centre small table sate 
28,"The sound of whispering voices sank to a dead and painful hush. The blood was tingling consciously in many cheeks, and not even a breath could be heard in the deep expectation of that anxious and solemn moment.",sound whisper voice sink dead painful hush blood tingle many cheek breath hear deep expectation anxious solemn moment 
29,"Dr. Rowlands spread before him the list of the school, and said, ""I shall first read out the names of the boys in the first-fifth, and upper-fourth forms.""",spread list school say read name boy first fifth upper fourth form 
30,"This was done to ascertain formally whether the boys were present on whose account the meeting was convened; and it at once told Eric and Wildney that _they_ were the boys to be punished, and that the others had escaped.",do ascertain boy present account meeting conven tell boy punish other escape 
31,"The names were called over, and an attentive observer might have told, from the sound of the boys' voices as they answered, which of them were afflicted with a troubled conscience.",name call attentive observer tell sound boy voice answer afflict troubled conscience 
32,"Another slight pause, and breathless hush.",slight pause breathless 
33,"""Eric Williams and Charles Wildney, stand forward.""",stand 
34,"The boys obeyed. From his place in the fifth, where he was sitting with his head propped on his hand, Eric rose and advanced; and Wildney, from the other end of the room, where the younger boys sat, getting up, came and stood by his side.",boy obey place fifth sit head proppe hand rise advance other end room young boy sit get come stand side 
35,"Both of them fixed their eyes on the ground, whence they never once raised them; and in the deadly pallor of their haggard faces, you could scarcely have recognized the joyous high-spirited friends, whose laugh and shout had often rung so merrily through the play-ground, and woke the echoes of the rocks along the shore. Every eye was on them, and they were conscious of it, though they could not see it--painfully conscious of it, so that they wished the very ground to yawn beneath their feet for the moment, and swallow up their shame. Companionship in disgrace increased the suffering; had either of them been alone, he would have been less acutely sensible to the trying nature of his position; but that they, so different in their ages and position in the school, should thus have their friendship and the results of it blazoned, or rather branded, before their friends and enemies added keenly to the misery they felt. So, with eyes bent on the floor, Eric and Charlie awaited their sentence.",fix eye ground raise deadly pallor haggard face recognize joyous high spirit friend laugh shout rung play ground wake echo rock shore eye conscious see conscious wish very ground yawn foot moment swallow shame companionship disgrace increase suffering alone sensible try nature position different age position school have friendship result blazon brand friend enemy add misery feel eye bend floor await sentence 
36,"""Williams and Wildney,"" said Dr. Rowlands in a solemn voice, of which every articulation thrilled to the heart of every hearer, ""you have been detected in a sin most disgraceful and most dangerous. On Saturday night you were both drinking, and you were guilty of such gross excess, that you were neither of you in a fit state to appear among your companions--least of all to appear among them at the hour of prayer. I shall not waste many words on an occasion like this; only I trust that those of your schoolfellows who saw you staggering and rolling into the room on Saturday evening in a manner so unspeakably shameful and degrading, will learn from that melancholy sight the lesson which the Spartans taught their children by exhibiting a drunkard before them--the lesson of the brutalising and fearful character of this most ruinous vice. Eric Williams and Charles Wildney, your punishment will be public expulsion, for which you will prepare this very evening. I am unwilling that for a single day either of you--especially the elder of you--should linger, so as possibly to contaminate others with the danger of so pernicious an example.""",say solemn voice articulation thrill heart hearer detect sin disgraceful dangerous night drink guilty such gross excess fit state appear companion least appear hour prayer waste many word occasion trust schoolfellow see staggering roll room evening manner shameful degrading learn melancholy sight lesson teach child exhibit drunkard lesson brutalise fearful character ruinous vice punishment public expulsion prepare very evening unwilling single day elder linger contaminate other danger pernicious example 
37,"Such a sentence was wholly unexpected; it took boys and masters equally by surprise. The announcement of it caused an uneasy sensation, which was evident to all present, though no one spoke a word; but Dr. Rowlands took no notice of it, and only said to the culprits--",sentence unexpected take boy master surprise announcement cause uneasy sensation evident present speak word take notice say culprit 
38,"""You may return to your seats.""",return seat 
39,"The two boys found their way back instinctively, they hardly knew how. They seemed confounded and thunderstruck by their sentence, and the painful accessories of its publicity. Eric leaned over the desk with his head resting on a book, too stunned even to think; and Wildney looked straight before him with his eyes fixed in a stupid and unobserved stare.",boy find way know seem confound thunderstruck sentence painful accessory publicity learn desk head rest book stunn think look eye fix stupid unobserved stare 
40,"Form by form the school dispersed, and the moment he was liberated Eric sprang away from the boys, who would have spoken to him, and rushed wildly to his study, where he locked the door. In a moment, however, he re-opened it, for he heard Wildney's step, and, after admitting him, locked it once more.",form form school disperse moment liberate spring boy speak rush study lock door moment re-open hear step admit lock 
41,"Without a word Wildney, who looked very pale, flung his arms round Eric's neck, and, unable to bear up any longer, burst into a flood of tears. Both of them felt relief in giving the reins to their sorrow.",word look pale flung arm neck unable bear burst flood tear feel relief give rein sorrow 
42,"""O my father! my father!"" sobbed Wildney at length. ""What will he say? He will disown me, I know; he is so stern always with me when he thinks I bring disgrace on him.""",father father sobb length say disown know stern think bring disgrace 
43,"Eric thought of Fairholm, and of his own far-distant parents, and of the pang which _his_ disgrace would cause their loving hearts; but he could say nothing, and only stroked Wildney's dark hair again and again with a soothing hand.",think own distant parent pang _his_ disgrace cause loving heart say stroke dark hair soothing hand 
44,"They sat there long, hardly knowing how the time passed; Eric could not help thinking how very, very different their relative positions might have been; how, while he might have been aiding and ennobling the young boy beside him, he had alternately led and followed him into wickedness and disgrace. His heart was full of misery and bitterness, and he felt almost indifferent to all the future, and weary of his life.",sit know time pass help think different relative position aid ennobl young boy lead follow wickedness disgrace heart full misery bitterness feel indifferent future weary life 
45,"A loud knocking at the door disturbed them. It was Carter, the school servant.",loud knock door disturb school servant 
46,"""You must pack up to go this evening, young gentlemen.""",pack go evening young gentleman 
47,"""O no! no! no!"" exclaimed Wildney; ""_cannot_ be sent away like this. It would break my father's heart. Eric, _do_ come and entreat Dr. Rowlands to forgive us only this once.""",exclaim send break father heart come entreat forgive

49,"Filled with an irresistible impulse, he pushed Carter aside, and sprang down stairs three steps at a time, with Wildney following him. They went straight for the Doctor's study, and without waiting for the answer to their knock at the door, Eric walked up to Dr. Rowlands, who sate thinking in his arm-chair by the fire, and burst out passionately, ""O sir, forgive us this once.""",fill irresistible impulse push spring stair step time follow go study wait answer knock door walk sate think arm chair fire burst sir forgive 
50,"The Doctor was completely taken by surprise, so sudden was the intrusion, and so intense was the boy's manner. He remained silent a moment from astonishment, and then said with asperity--",take surprise intrusion intense boy manner remain silent moment astonishment say asperity 
51,"""Your offence is one of the most dangerous possible. There could be no more perilous example for the school, than the one you have been setting, Williams. Leave the room,"" he added, with an authoritative gesture, ""my mind is made up.""",offence dangerous possible be perilous example school one set leave room add authoritative gesture mind make 
52,"But Eric was too excited to be overawed by the master's manner; an imperious passion blinded him to all ordinary considerations, and, heedless of the command, he broke out again--",excited overaw master manner imperious passion blind ordinary consideration heedless command break

54,"Dr. Rowlands, seeing that in Eric's present mood he must and would be heard, unless he were ejected by actual force, began to pace silently up and down the room in perplexed and anxious thought; at last he stopped and turned over the pages of a thick school register, and found Eric's name.",see present mood hear eject actual force begin pace room perplexed anxious thought last stop turn page thick school register find name 
55,"""It is not your first offence, Williams, even of this very kind. That most seriously aggravates your fault.""",first offence kind aggravate fault

O, I entreat you, sir, to forgive us only this once, and I will never ask again. Let us bear _any_ other punishment but this.

57,"The head-master made no reply for a time, but again paced the room in silence. He was touched, and seemed hardly able to restrain his emotion.",head master make reply time pace room silence touch seem able restrain emotion 
58,"""It was my deliberate conclusion to expel you, Williams. I must not weakly yield to entreaty. You must go.""",deliberate conclusion expel yield entreaty go 
59,"Eric wrung his hands in agony. ""O, sir, then, if you must do so, expel me only, and not Charlie, _I_ can bear it, but do not let me ruin him also.

It is I who have misled him;"" and he flung himself on his knees, and lifted his hands entreatingly towards the Doctor.",wrung hand agony sir do expel bear let ruin implore sir love do forgive misl flung knee lift hand 
60,"Dr. Rowlands looked at him--at his blue eyes drowned with tears, his agitated gesture, his pale, expressive face, full of passionate supplication. He looked at Wildney, too, who stood trembling with a look of painful and miserable suspense, and occasionally added his wild word of entreaty, or uttered sobs more powerful still, that seemed to come from the depth of his heart. He was shaken in his resolve, wavered for a moment, and then once more looked at the register.",look blue eye drown tear agitated gesture pale expressive face full passionate supplication look stand tremble look painful miserable suspense add wild word entreaty utter sob powerful seem come depth heart shake resolve waver moment look register

Risked his life in the endeavor to save Edwin Russell at the Stack.' That one good and noble deed shall be the proof that you are capable of better things. It may be weak perhaps--I know that it will be called weak--and I do not feel certain that I am doing right; but if I err it shall be on the side of mercy.

63,"""O thank you, thank you, sir,"" he exclaimed, drying his eyes, and pouring into the words a world of expression, which it was no light pleasure to have heard. But Eric spoke less impulsively, and while the two boys were stammering out their deep gratitude, a timid hand knocked at the door, and Vernon entered.",thank thank exclaim drying eye pour word world expression light pleasure hear speak boy stammer deep gratitude timid hand knock door enter 
64,"""I have come, sir, to speak for poor Eric,"" he said in a low voice, and trembling with emotion, as, with downcast eyes, he modestly approached towards Dr. Rowlands, not even observing the presence of the others in the complete absorption of his feelings. He stood in a sorrowful attitude, not venturing to look up, and his hand played nervously with the ribbon of his straw hat.",come sir speak poor say low voice tremble emotion downcast eye approach observe presence other complete absorption feeling stand sorrowful attitude venture look hand play ribbon straw hat

67,"Dr. Rowlands watched the scene with moist eyes. He was generally a man of prompt decision, and he well knew that he would incur by this act the charge of vacillation. It was a noble self-denial in him to be willing to do so, but it would have required an iron heart to resist such earnest supplications, and he was more than repaid when he saw how much anguish he had removed by yielding to their entreaties.",watch scene moist eye man prompt decision know incur act charge vacillation noble self denial willing do require iron heart resist such earnest supplication more repaid see much anguish remove yield entreaty 
68,"Once more humbly expressing their gratitude, the boys retired.",express gratitude boy retire 
69,"They did not know that other influences had been also exerted in their favor, which, although ineffectual at the time, had tended to alter the Doctor's intention. Immediately after school Mr. Rose had been strongly endeavoring to change the Doctor's mind, and had dwelt forcibly on all the good points in Eric's character, and the promise of his earlier career. And Montagu had gone with Owen and Duncan to beg that the expulsion might be commuted into some other punishment. They had failed to convince him; but, perhaps, had they not thus exerted themselves, Dr. Rowlands might have been unshaken, though he could not be unmoved by Vernon's gentle intercession and Eric's passionate prayers.",know other influence exert favor ineffectual time tend alter intention school endeavor change mind dwele good point character promise early career go beg expulsion commute other punishment fail convince exert unshaken unmove gentle intercession passionate prayer 
70,"Wildney, full of joy, and excited by the sudden revulsion of feeling, only shook Eric's hand with all his might, and then darted out into the playground to announce the happy news. The boys all flocked round him, and received the intelligence with unmitigated pleasure. Among them all there was not one who did not rejoice that Eric and Wildney were yet to continue of their number.",full joy excite sudden revulsion feeling shake hand dart playground announce happy news boy flock receive intelligence unmitigated pleasure be one rejoice continue number 
71,"But the two brothers returned to the study, and there, sorrowful in his penitence, with his heart still aching with remorse, Eric sat down on a chair facing the window, and drew Vernon to his side. The sun was setting behind the purple hills, flooding the green fields and silver sea with the crimson of his parting rays. The air was full of peace and coolness, and the merry sounds of the cricket field blended joyously with the whisper of the evening breeze. Eric was fond of beauty in every shape, and his father had early taught him a keen appreciation of the glories of nature. He had often gazed before on that splendid scene, as he was now gazing on it thoughtfully with his brother by his side. He looked long and wistfully at the gorgeous pageantry of quiet clouds, and passed his arm more fondly round Vernon's shoulder.",brother return study sorrowful penitence heart ach remorse sit chair face window draw side sun set purple hill flood green field silver sea crimson parting ray air full peace coolness merry sound cricket field blend whisper evening breeze fond beauty shape father teach keen appreciation glory nature gaze splendid scene gaze brother side look long gorgeous pageantry quiet cloud pass arm shoulder

73,"""Gladder, far gladder than I can say, Verny. O Verny, Verny, I hope your school-life may be happier than mine has been. I would give up all I have, Verny, to have kept free from the sins I have learnt. God grant that I may yet have time and space to do better.""",gladder gladder say hope school life happy give have keep free sin learn grant have time space do good 
74,"""Let us pray together, Eric,"" whispered his brother reverently, and they knelt down and prayed; they prayed for their distant parents and friends; they prayed for their schoolfellows and for each other, and for Wildney, and they thanked God for all his goodness to them; and then Eric poured out his heart in a fervent prayer that a holier and happier future might atone for his desecrated past, and that his sins might be forgiven for his Saviour's sake.",let pray whisper brother knolt pray pray distant parent friend pray schoolfellow other thank goodness pour heart fervent prayer holy happy future atone desecrate past sin forgive sake 
75,"The brothers rose from their knees calmer and more light-hearted, and gave each other a solemn affectionate kiss, before they went down again to the play-ground. But they avoided the rest of the boys, and took a stroll together along the sands, talking quietly, and happily, and hoping bright hopes for future days.",brother rise knee calmer light hearted give other solemn affectionate kiss go play ground avoid rest boy take stroll sand talk hope bright hope future day
