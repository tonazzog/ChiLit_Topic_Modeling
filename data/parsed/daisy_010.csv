5," When Ethel came home, burning with the tidings of the newly-excited hopes for Cocksmoor, they were at once stopped by Margaret eagerly saying, “Is Richard come in? pray call him;” then on his entrance, “Oh, Richard, would you be so kind as to take this to the bank. I don’t like to send it by any one else--it is so much;” and she took from under her pillows a velvet bag, so heavy, that it weighed down her slender white hand.",come burn tiding excite hope stop say come pray call entrance kind take bank like send one else much take pillow velvet bag heavy weigh slender white hand 
6,"“What, he has given you the care of his money?” said Ethel.",give care money say 
7,"“Yes; I saw him turning something out of his waistcoat-pocket into the drawer of the looking-glass, and sighing in that very sad way. He said his fees had come to such an accumulation that he must see about sending them to the bank; and then he told me of the delight of throwing his first fee into dear mamma’s lap, when they were just married, and his old uncle had given up to him, and how he had brought them to her ever since; he said she had spoiled him by taking all trouble off his hands. He looked at it, as if it was so sorrowful to him to have to dispose of it, that I begged him not to plague himself any more, but let me see about it, as dear mamma used to do; so he said I was spoiling him too, but he brought me the drawer, and emptied it out here: when he was gone, I packed it up, and I have been waiting to ask Richard to take it all to the bank, out of his sight.”",see turn waistcoat pocket drawer look glass sigh sad way say fee come accumulation see send bank tell delight throw first fee dear mamma lap marry old uncle give bring say spoiled take trouble hand look sorrowful have dispose begg plague more let see dear mamma use do say spoil bring drawer empty gone pack wait ask take bank sight

12,"“Yes, do,” said Margaret; “pray do not tease him with it.” And as her brother left the room, she continued, “I wish he was better. I think he is more oppressed now than even at first. The pain of his arm, going on so long, seems to me to have pulled him down; it does not let him sleep, and, by the end of the day, he gets worn and fagged by seeing so many people, and exerting himself to talk and think; and often, when there is something that must be asked, I don’t know how to begin, for it seems as if a little more would be too much for him.”",do say pray tease brother leave room continue wish good think oppress first pain arm go seem pull let sleep end day wear fagg see many person exert talk think be ask know begin seem little more much

14,"“He did not sleep last night, and he is always worse when he does not drive out into the country; the fresh air, and being alone with Richard, are a rest for him.

17,"“No, I hope he will soon come; perhaps Richard will meet him. But, oh, Margaret, what do you think Richard and I have been talking of?” and, without perception of fit times and seasons, Ethel would have told her story, but Margaret, too anxious to attend to her, said, “Hark! was not that his step?” and Dr. May came in, looking mournful and fatigued.",hope come meet think talk perception fit time season tell story anxious attend say step come look mournful fatigued

20,"“Yes,” said Dr. May, sitting wearily down, and speaking in a worn-out voice. “One can’t lightly part with a man one has seen at church every Sunday of one’s life, and exchanged so many friendly words with over his counter. ‘Tis a strong bond of neighbourliness in a small place like this, and, as one grows old, changes come heavier--‘the clouds return again after the rain.’ Thank you, my dear,” as Ethel fetched his slippers, and placed a stool for his feet, feeling somewhat ashamed of thinking it an achievement to have, unbidden, performed a small act of attention which would have come naturally from any of the others.",say sit speak wear out voice part man one see church life exchange many friendly word counter tis strong bond neighbourliness small place grow old change come heavy cloud return rain thank dear fetched slipper place stool foot feel ashamed think achievement unbidden perform small act attention come other

22,"That Margaret could not be made to listen this evening was plain, and all that Ethel could do, was to search for some books on schools. In seeking for them, she displayed such confusion in the chiffonier, that Flora exclaimed, “Oh, Ethel, how could you leave it so?”",make listen evening plain do search book school seek display such confusion chiffonier exclaim leave

25,"“No, no, Flora;” and Richard, in a low voice, gave Ethel some advice, which she received, seated on the floor, in a mood between temper and despair.",low voice give advice receive seat floor mood temper despair

27,"Richard did not do it himself, but, by his means, Ethel, without being in the least irritated, gave the chiffonier a thorough dusting and setting-to-rights, sorting magazines, burning old catalogues, and finding her own long-lost ‘Undine’, at which she was so delighted that she would have forgotten all; in proceeding to read it, curled up on the floor amongst the heaps of pamphlets, if another gentle hint from Richard had not made her finish her task so well, as to make Flora declare it was a pleasure to look in, and Harry pronounce it to be all neat and ship-shape.",do means least irritate give chiffonier thorough dusting setting right sorting magazine burn old catalogue find own long lose delighted forget proceeding read curl floor heap pamphlet gentle hint make finish task make declare pleasure look pronounce neat ship shape 
28,"There was no speaking to Margaret the next morning--it was French day--and Ethel had made strong resolutions to behave better; and whether there were fewer idioms, or that she was trying to understand, instead of carping at the master’s explanations, they came to no battle; Flora led the conversation, and she sustained her part with credit, and gained an excellent mark.",be speak next morning french day make strong resolution behave good be few idiom try understand carp master explanation come battle lead conversation sustain part credit gain excellent mark 
29,"Flora said afterwards to Margaret, “I managed nicely for her. I would not let M.

How fast she gets on with Italian!”",say manage let blunder subject feel talk good have great talent language get italian

31,"It was the second time Margaret had made this proposal, and it did not please Flora, who had learned to think herself necessary to her sister, and liked to be the one to do everything for her. She was within six weeks of seventeen, and surely she need not be sent down again to the school-room, when she had been so good a manager of the whole family. She was fond of study and of accomplishments, but she thought she might be emancipated from Miss Winter; and it was not pleasant to her that a sister, only eighteen months older, and almost dependant on her, should have authority to dispose of her time.",second time make proposal please learn think necessary sister like one do week send school room good manager whole family fond study accomplishment think emancipate pleasant sister month old dependant have authority dispose time

36,"“Great nonsense they are,” said Flora. “Why don’t you tell Miss Winter they are of no use?”",great nonsense say tell use 
37,"“Mamma never interfered with them,” said Margaret. “She only kept Ethel in her own hands, and if you would be so kind as to change sometimes and sit in the school-room, we could spare Ethel, without hurting Miss Winter’s feelings.”",interfer say keep own hand kind change sit school room spare hurt feeling

40,"“Oh, Margaret, I am so glad to come to you. Miss Winter has set Mary to read ‘To be, or not to be,’ and it would have driven me distracted to have stayed there. I have got a most beautiful sum in Compound Proportion, about a lion, a wolf, and a bear eating up a carcase, and as soon as they have done it, you shall hear me say my ancient geography, and then we will do a nice bit of Tasso; and if we have any time after that, I have got such a thing to tell you--only I must not tell you now, or I shall go on talking and not finish my lessons.”",glad come set read drive distract stay get beautiful sum lion wolf bear eat carcase do hear say ancient geography do nice bit have time get thing tell tell go talk finish lesson 
41,"It was not till all were done, that Ethel felt free to exclaim, “Now for what I have been longing to tell you--Richard is going to--” But the fates were unpropitious. Aubrey trotted in, expecting to be amused; next came Norman, and Ethel gave up in despair; and, after having affronted Flora in the morning, Margaret was afraid of renewing the offence, by attempting to secure Ethel as her companion for the afternoon; so not till after the walk could Margaret contrive to claim the promised communication, telling Ethel to come and settle herself cosily by her.",do feel free exclaim long tell go fate unpropitious trotet expect amuse come give despair affront morning afraid renew offence attempt secure companion afternoon walk contrive claim promise communication tell come settle

46,"“I am glad of resting and recollecting,” said Margaret. “It has all been so like a dream, that merry morning, and then, slowly waking to find myself here in dear mamma’s place, and papa watching over me. Sometimes I think I have not half understood what it really is, and that I don’t realise, that if I was up and about, I should find the house without her.”",glad rest recollect say dream merry morning wake find dear mamma place papa watch think half understand realise find house

48,"“That is the reason I don’t feel it wrong to like to have papa sitting with me all the evening,” said Margaret, “though it may make it worse for you to have him away. I don’t think it selfish in me to keep him. He wants quiet so much, or to talk a little when it suits him; we are too many now, when he is tired.”",reason feel wrong like have papa sit evening say make bad have think selfish keep want quiet much talk little suit many tired

But, do you know, Margaret, there’s no one such a help in those ways as Richard. Though he is so precise, he is never tiresome. He makes me see things, and do them neatly, without plaguing me, and putting me in a rage. I’m not ready to bite off my own fingers, or kick all the rattle-traps over and leave them, as I am when Miss Winter scolds me, or nurse, or even Flora sometimes; but it is as if I was gratifying him, and his funny little old bachelor tidyisms divert me; besides, he teaches me the theory, and never lays hold of my poor fingers, and, when they won’t bend the wrong way, calls them frogs.”",hollow show goodness say true come horrid wretch want undertake much leave undone know be help way precise tiresome make see thing do plague put rage ready bite own finger kick rattle trap leave scold nurse gratify funny little old bachelor tidyism divert teach theory lay hold poor finger bend wrong way call frog

71,"“If he would only read our books, and enter into poetry and delight in it; but it is all nonsense to him,” said Ethel. “I can’t think how people can be so different; but, oh! here he comes.

85,"The scene that ensued that evening in the magic lantern before Margaret’s bed, did not promise much for the freedom of her father’s mind. Harry entered with a resolute manner. “Margaret, I wanted to speak to you,” said he, spreading himself out, with an elbow on each arm of the chair. “I want you to speak to papa about my going to sea.

His subject was a river, and hers Babylon; but, altering a line or two, it did just as well. He never guessed I saw him, and thought he had done it famously. He showed them up, and would have got some noted good mark, but that, by great good luck, Ethel had made two of her pentameters too short, which he hadn’t the wit to find out, thinking all Norman did must be right.

The fact is, Margaret, they are a low, ungentlemanly lot just now, about sixth and upper fifth form,” said Harry, lowering his voice into an anxious confidential tone; “and since Norman has been less amongst them, they’ve got worse; and you see, now home is different, and he isn’t like what he was, I’m thrown on them, and I want to get out of it.

131,"“I will,” said Harry, and the words were hardly spoken, before his father’s hand was on the door.

Comeback, Harry,” and he took his hand. “It was a bad piece of work, and it will never do for you to let yourself be drawn into every bit of mischief that is on foot; I believe I ought to give you a good lecture on it, but I can’t do it, after such a straightforward confession.

144,"What a world of thought passed through the boy’s young soul in that space! First, there was a thrill of intense, burning love to his father, scarcely less fondness to his sweet motherly sister; a clinging feeling to every chair and table of that room, which seemed still full of his mother’s presence; a numbering over of all the others with ardent attachment, and a flinging from him with horror the notion of asking to be far away from that dearest father, that loving home, that arm that was round him. Anything rather than be without them in the dreary world! But then came the remembrance of cherished visions, the shame of relinquishing a settled purpose, the thought of weary morrows, with the tempters among his playmates, and his home blank and melancholy; and the roaming spirit of enterprise stirred again, and reproached him with being a baby, for fancying he could stay at home for ever. He would come back again with such honours as Alan Ernescliffe had brought, and oh! if his father so prized them in a stranger, what would it be in his own son? Come home to such a greeting as would make up for the parting! Harry’s heart throbbed again for the boundless sea, the tall ship, and the wondrous foreign climes, where he had so often lived in fancy. Should he, could he speak: was this the moment? and he stood gazing at the fire, oppressed with the weighty reality of deciding his destiny. At last Dr. May looked in his face, “Well, what now, boy? You have your head full of something--what’s coming next?”",world thought pass boy young soul space be thrill intense burn love father less fondness sweet motherly sister cling feeling chair table room seem full mother presence numbering other ardent attachment flinging horror notion ask dearest father love home arm dreary world come remembrance cherish vision shame relinquish settle purpose thought weary morrow tempter playmate home blank melancholy roam spirit enterprise stirr reproach baby fancy stay home come such honour bring father prize stranger own son come greeting make parting heart throbb boundless sea tall ship wondrous foreign clime live fancy speak moment stand gaze fire oppress weighty reality decide destiny last look face have head full come

I mean it quite in earnest--I had rather be a sailor. I don’t wish to get away from Latin and Greek, I don’t mind them; but I think I could be a better sailor than anything.

Now run down, and tell the girls to put away their work, for I shall come down in a minute to read prayers.”",think make mind quick know say father smile treat boy fancy speak manly way deserve attend run tell girl put work come minute read prayer 
153,"Harry went, and his father sighed and mused! “That’s a fine fellow! So this is what comes of bringing sick sailors home--one’s own boys must be catching the infection.

The doctor listened and considered at last he rose, and said, “Well, I’ll set Ritchie to write to Ernescliffe, and hear what he says. What must be, must be. ‘Tis only asking me to give up the boy, that’s all;” and as he left the room, his daughter again heard his sigh and half-uttered words, “Oh, Maggie, Maggie!”",wish choose else think right lay father part say temptation school doctor listen consider last rise say set write hear say ask give boy leave room daughter hear sigh half utter word
