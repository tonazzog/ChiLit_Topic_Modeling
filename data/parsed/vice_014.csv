The sort of life you're leading it, sir, will very soon make an end of you, if you don't take care. Do you think that a constitution at my age can stand sweet wines and pastry, and late hours? Why, you'll be laid up with gout in another day or two. Don't tell me, sir. I know you're suffering from indigestion at this very minute.

""Do you suppose I shall stand calmly by and see you degrading and ruining me? I may never be my old self again, but I don't mean to play into your hands for all that. You can't always keep me here, and wherever I go I'll tell my tale. I know you, you clumsy rogue, you haven't the sense to play your part with common intelligence now.

31,"Dick had started back at first in unmistakable alarm at this unexpected defiance, probably feeling his self-possession unequal to such a test; but, when Paul had finished, he said doggedly: ""Well, you can do it if you choose, I suppose.

33,"There was a hesitation in his manner, in spite of the firmness of his words, which Dick was not likely to miss. ""Stop!"" he said. ""Before you call them in, just listen to me for a minute. Do you see this?"" And, opening his coat, he pulled out from his waistcoat pocket one end of his watch-chain. Hanging to it, attached by a cheap gilt fastening of some sort, was a small grey tablet. Paul knew it at once--it was the Garud√¢ Stone. ""You know it, I see,"" said Dick, as Paul was about to move towards him--with what object he scarcely knew himself. ""Don't trouble to come any closer. Well, I give you fair warning. You can make things very nasty for me if you like. I can't help that--but, if you do--if you try to score off me in any way, now or at any time--if you don't keep it up when the Doctor comes in--I tell you what I shall do. I shall go straight home and find young Roly. I shall give him this stone, and just tell him to say some wish after me. I don't believe there are many things it can't do, and all I can say is--if you find yourself and all this jolly old school (except Dulcie) taken off somewhere and stuck down all at once thousands of miles away on a desolate island, or see yourself turned into a Red Indian, or, or a cabhorse, you'll have yourself to thank for it--that's all.

34,"""No,"" said Paul, in a broken voice, for, wild as the threat was, he could not afford to despise it after his experiences of the stone's power, ""I--I was joking, Dick; at least I didn't mean it. I know of course I'm helpless. It's a sad thing for a father to say, but you've got the best of it.... I give in ... I won't interfere with you. There's only one thing I ask.

38,"There was a pause, in which the conversation seemed about to flag hopelessly, but at last Dick said, almost as if he felt some compunction for his present unfilial attitude: ""Now, you know, it's much better to take things quietly. It can't be altered now, can it? And it's not such bad fun being a boy after all--for some things. You'll get into it by-and-by, you see if you don't, and be as jolly as a sandboy. We shall get along all right together, too. I shan't be hard on you. It isn't my fault that you happen to be at this particular school--you chose it! And after this term you can go to any other school you like--Eton or Rugby, or anywhere. I don't mind the expense. Of, if you'd rather, you can have a private tutor.
