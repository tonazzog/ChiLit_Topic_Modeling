1,CHAPTER X. _The Prince and the Remora_,
2,"If he had been too warm before, the prince was too cold now. The hill of the Remora was one solid mass of frozen steel, and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy beast, which indeed it _was_. All around were things like marble statues of men in armour: they were the dead bodies of the knights, horses and all, who had gone out of old to fight the Remora, and who had been frosted up by him. The prince felt his blood stand still, and he grew faint; but he took heart, for there was no time to waste. Yet he could nowhere see the Remora. “Hi!” shouted the prince. Then, from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth, black hill,--a chink no deeper than that under a door, but a mile wide,--stole out a hideous head!",warm prince cold hill solid mass freeze steel cold rush breath icy beast thing marble statue man armour dead body knight horse go old fight frost prince feel blood stand grow faint take heart be time waste see shout prince narrow chink bottom smooth black hill chink deep door mile wide steal hideous head

7,"Then the flat, white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped, and slowly, like the movement of a sheet of ice, it slipped upwards and curled upwards, and up, and up! There seemed no end to it at all; and it moved horribly, without feet, holding on by its own frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill. Now all the lower part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in smooth, flat shiny coils; and still the head was higher than the rest; and still the icy cold came nearer and nearer, like Death.",flat white head set edge chink peep movement sheet ice slip curl seem end move foot hold own frost slippery side freeze hill low part black hill cover horrid white thing coiled smooth flat shiny coil head high rest icy cold come nearer 
8,"The prince almost fainted: everything seemed to swim; and in one moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top, and the white head would have crawled over him, and the cold coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone.
