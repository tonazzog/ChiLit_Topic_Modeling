3," Poor Mr. Bultitude, springing wildly upstairs in a last desperate effort to avoid capture, had now almost reached his goal. Just above him was the nursery landing, with its little wooden gate, and near it, leaning against the wall, was a pair of kitchen steps, with which he had hopes of reaching the roof, or the cistern loft, or some other safe and inaccessible place. Better a night spent on the slates amongst the chimney-pots than a bed in that terrible No. 6 Dormitory!",poor spring last desperate effort avoid capture reach goal nursery landing little wooden gate lean wall pair kitchen step have hope reach roof cistern loft other safe inaccessible place good night spend slate chimney pot bed terrible no. dormitory

He was not more than half-a-dozen steps from the top, when, to his unspeakable horror, he saw a small form in a white frock and cardinal-red sash come running out of the nursery, and begin to descend slowly and cautiously, clinging to the banisters with one chubby little hand.",fate more half step top unspeakable horror see small form white frock cardinal red sash come run nursery begin descend cling banister chubby little hand 
5,"It was his youngest son, Roly, and as soon as he saw this, he lost hope once and for all; he could not escape being recognised, the child would probably refuse to leave him, and even if he did contrive to get away from him, it would be hopeless to make Roly understand that he was not to betray his hiding-place.",young son see lose hope escape recognise child refuse leave contrive get hopeless make understand betray hiding place 
6,"So he stopped on the stairs, aghast at this new misfortune, and feeling himself at the end of all his resources.

Not till then did he feel perfectly secure.",take care stop first window manage coaxing persuade give have hand open window flung dangerous talisman darkness feel secure

117,"Mr. Bultitude too, felt something spring up in his heart which drew him towards the boy in an altogether novel manner, but no one will say that either was the worse for it.",feel spring heart draw boy novel manner say bad 
118,"""Well,"" he said mildly, ""prove to me that I have made no mistake. Go back to Crichton House now, work and play well, and try to keep out of mischief for the rest of the term. I trust to you,"" he added, in a lower tone, ""while you remain at Market Rodwell, to keep my--my connection with it a secret; you owe that at least to me. You may probably have--ahem, some inconveniences to put up with--inconveniences you are not prepared for. You must bear them as your punishment.""",say prove make mistake go work play try keep mischief rest term trust add low tone remain keep connection secret owe least have inconvenience put inconvenience prepare bear punishment

120,"As Paul shook hands through the cab window with his prodigal son, he repeated his warning. ""Mind,"" he said, ""_you_ have been at school all this past week; you have run away to attend this party, you understand? Good-bye, my boy, and here's something to put in your pocket, and another for Jolland; but he need not know it comes from me."" And when Dick opened his hand afterwards, he found two half-sovereigns in it.",shake hand cab window prodigal son repeat warning mind say school past week run attend party understand good boy put pocket know come open hand find half sovereign 
121,"So the cab rolled away, and Paul went up to the drawing-room, where, although he certainly allowed the fireworks on the balcony and in the garden to languish forgotten on their sticks, he led all the other revels up to an advanced hour with jovial _abandon_ quite worthy of Dick, and none of his little guests ever suspected the change of host.",cab roll go draw room allow firework balcony garden languish forget stick lead other revel advanced hour jovial _abandon_ worthy little guest suspect change host 
122,"When it was all over, and the sleepy children had driven off, Paul sat down in an easy chair by the bright fire which sparkled frostily in his bedroom, to think gratefully over all the events of the day--events which were beginning already to take an unreal and fantastic shape.",sleepy child drive sit easy chair bright fire sparkle bedroom think event day event begin take unreal fantastic shape 
123,"Bitterly as he had suffered, and in spite of the just anger and thirst for revenge with which he had returned, I am glad to say he did not regret the spirit of mildness that had stayed his hand when his hour of triumph came.",suffer spite anger thirst revenge return glad say regret spirit mildness stay hand hour triumph come 
124,"His experiences, unpleasant as they had been, had had their advantages: they had drawn him and his family closer together.",experience unpleasant have advantage draw family 
125,"In his daughter Barbara, as she wished him good-night (knowing nothing, of course, of the escape), he had suddenly become aware of a girlish freshness and grace he had never looked for or cared to see before. Roly after this, too, had a claim upon him he could never wish to forget, and even with the graceless Dick there was a warmer and more natural feeling on both sides--a strange result, no doubt, of such unfilial behaviour, but so it was.",daughter wish good night know course escape become aware girlish freshness grace look care see have claim wish forget graceless be warm natural feeling side strange result doubt such unfilial behaviour 
126,"Mr. Bultitude would never after this consider his family as a set of troublesome and thankless incumbrances; thanks to Dick's offices during the interregnum, they would henceforth throw off their reserve and constraint in their father's presence, and in so doing, open his eyes to qualities of which he had hitherto been in contented ignorance.",consider family set troublesome thankless incumbrance thanks office interregnum throw reserve constraint father presence do open eye quality content ignorance

131,"It took Mr. Bultitude considerable time and trouble to repair all the damage his son's boyish excesses had wrought both at Westbourne Terrace and in the City. He found the discipline of his clerks' room and counting-house sorely relaxed, and his office-boy in particular attempted a tone towards him of such atrocious familiarity that he was indignantly dismissed, much to his astonishment, the very first day. And probably Paul will never quite clear himself of the cloud that hangs over a man of business who, in the course of however well regulated a career, is known to have been at least once ""a little odd.""",take considerable time trouble repair damage son boyish excess wring find discipline clerk room counting house relaxed office boy particular attempt tone such atrocious familiarity dismiss much astonishment very first day clear cloud hang man business course regulate career know least little odd

134,"For some time, as fresh proof of Dick's extravagances came home to him, Paul found it cost him no little effort to restrain a tendency to his former bitterness and resentment, but he valued the new understanding between himself and his son too highly to risk losing it again by any open reproach, and so with each succeeding discovery the victory over his feelings became easier.",time fresh proof extravagance come find cost little effort restrain tendency former bitterness resentment value new understanding son risk lose open reproach succeed discovery victory feeling become easy 
135,"As for Dick, he found the inconveniences at which his father had hinted anything but imaginary, as will perhaps be easily understood.",find inconvenience father hint imaginary understand 
136,"It was an unpleasant shock to discover that in one short week his father had contrived somehow to procure him a lasting unpopularity. He was obviously looked upon by all, masters and boys, as a confirmed coward and sneak. And although some of his companions could not fairly reproach him on the latter score, the imputation was particularly galling to Dick, who had always treated such practices with sturdy contempt.",unpleasant shock discover short week father contrive procure last unpopularity look master boy confirm coward sneak companion reproach latter score imputation galling treat such practice sturdy contempt 
137,He was sorely tempted at times to right himself by declaring the real state of the case; but he remembered his promise and his father's unexpected clemency and his gratitude always kept him silent.,tempt time right declare real state case remember promise father unexpected clemency gratitude keep silent 
138,He never quite understood how it was that the whole school seemed to have an impression that they could kick and assault him generally with perfect impunity; but a few very unsuccessful experiments convinced them that this was a popular error on their part.,understand whole school seem have impression kick assault perfect impunity few unsuccessful experiment convince popular error part

140,"His little sweetheart, with the grey eyes and soft brown hair, cruelly refused to have anything more to do with him. For Dulcie's pride had been wounded by what she considered his shameless perfidy on that memorable Saturday by the parallel bars; the last lingering traces of affection had vanished before Paul's ingratitude on the following Monday, and she never forgave him.",little sweetheart grey eye soft brown hair refuse have more do pride wound consider shameless perfidy memorable parallel bar last linger trace affection vanish ingratitude follow forgive 
141,"She did not even give him an opportunity of explaining himself, never by word or sign up to the last day of the term showing that she was even aware of his return. What was worse, in her resentment she transferred her favour to Tipping, who became her humble slave for a too brief period; after which he was found wanting in polish, and was ignominiously thrown over for the shy new boy Kiffin, whose head Dick found a certain melancholy pleasure in punching in consequence.",give opportunity explain word sign last day term show aware return bad resentment transfer favour become humble slave brief period find want polish throw shy new boy head find certain melancholy pleasure punch consequence 
142,"This was Dick's punishment, and a very real and heavy one he found it. He is at Harrow now, where he is doing fairly well; but I think there are moments even yet when Dulcie's charming little face, her pretty confidences, and her chilling disdain, are remembered with something as nearly resembling a heartache as a healthy unsentimental boy can allow himself.",punishment real heavy one find do think be moment charming little face pretty confidence chill disdain remember resemble heartache healthy unsentimental boy allow 
143,"Perhaps, if some day he goes back once more to Crichton House ""to see the fellows,"" this time with the mysterious glamour of a great public school about him, he may yet obtain forgiveness, for she is getting horribly tired of Kiffin, who, to tell the truth, is something of a milksop.",day go more see fellow time mysterious glamour great public school obtain forgiveness get tired tell truth milksop 
144,"As for the Garudâ Stone, I really cannot say what has become of it. Perhaps it was dashed to pieces on the cobble-stones of the stables behind the terrace, and a good thing too. Perhaps it was not, and is still in existence, with all its dangerous powers as ready for use as ever it was; and in that case the best I can wish my readers is, that they may be mercifully preserved from finding it anywhere, or if they are unfortunate enough to come upon it, that they may at least be more careful with it than Mr. Paul Bultitude, by whose melancholy example I trust they will take timely warning.",say become dash piece cobble stone stable terrace good thing existence dangerous power ready use case good wish reader preserve find unfortunate come least careful melancholy example trust take timely warning
