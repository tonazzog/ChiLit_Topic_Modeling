4,"""You see,"" said Peterkin, ""it might be all very well for a stupid fellow like me to remain here and leave the penguins alone, but it would be quite inconsistent with your characters as philosophers to remain any longer in ignorance of the habits and customs of these birds; so the sooner we go the better.""",see say stupid fellow remain leave penguin inconsistent character philosopher remain long ignorance habit custom bird go good

7,"""Stay at home?"" cried Peterkin; ""my dear fellow, you would certainly lose your way, or get upset, if I were not there to take care of you.""",stay home cry dear fellow lose way get upset take care 
8,"""Ah, true,"" said Jack, gravely, ""that did not occur to me; no doubt you must go.  Our boat does require a good deal of ballast; and all that you say, Peterkin, carries so much weight with it, that we won't need stones if you go.""",true say occur doubt go boat require good deal ballast say carry much weight need stone go 
9,"Now, while my companions were talking, a notable event occurred, which, as it is not generally known, I shall be particular in recording here.",companion talk notable event occur know particular record 
10,"While we were talking, as I have said, we noticed a dark line, like a low cloud or fog-bank, on the seaward horizon.  The day was a fine one, though cloudy, and a gentle breeze was blowing, but the sea was not rougher, or the breaker on the reef higher, than usual.  At first we thought that this looked like a thunder-cloud; and, as we had had a good deal of broken weather of late, accompanied by occasional peals of thunder, we supposed that a storm must be approaching.  Gradually, however, this line seemed to draw nearer, without spreading up over the sky, as would certainly have been the case if it had been a storm-cloud. Still nearer it came, and soon we saw that it was moving swiftly towards the island; but there was no sound till it reached the islands out at sea.  As it passed these islands, we observed, with no little anxiety, that a cloud of white foam encircled them, and burst in spray into the air: it was accompanied by a loud roar.  This led us to conjecture that the approaching object was an enormous wave of the sea; but we had no idea how large it was till it came near to ourselves.  When it approached the outer reef, however, we were awe-struck with its unusual magnitude; and we sprang to our feet, and clambered hastily up to the highest point of the precipice, under an indefinable feeling of fear.",talk say notice dark line low cloud fog bank seaward horizon day fine one cloudy gentle breeze blow sea rougher breaker reef high usual think look thunder cloud have good deal break weather accompany occasional peal thunder suppose storm approach line seem draw nearer spread sky case storm cloud come see move island be sound reach island sea pass island observe little anxiety cloud white foam encircle burst spray air accompany loud roar lead conjecture approach object enormous wave sea have idea large come approach outer reef awe strike unusual magnitude spring foot clamber high point precipice indefinable feeling fear 
11,"I have said before that the reef opposite Spouting Cliff was very near to the shore, while, just in front of the bower, it was at a considerable distance out to sea.  Owing to this formation, the wave reached the reef at the latter point before it struck at the foot of Spouting Cliff.  The instant it touched the reef we became aware, for the first time, of its awful magnitude.  It burst completely over the reef at all points, with a roar that seemed louder to me than thunder; and this roar continued for some seconds, while the wave rolled gradually along towards the cliff on which we stood.  As its crest reared before us, we felt that we were in great danger, and turned to flee; but we were too late.  With a crash that seemed to shake the solid rocks the gigantic billow fell, and instantly the spouting-holes sent up a gush of water-spouts with such force that they shrieked on issuing from their narrow vents.  It seemed to us as if the earth had been blown up with water.  We were stunned and confused by the shock, and so drenched and blinded with spray, that we knew not for a few moments whither to flee for shelter.  At length we all three gained an eminence beyond the reach of the water; but what a scene of devastation met our gaze as we looked along the shore!  This enormous wave not only burst over the reef, but continued its way across the lagoon, and fell on the sandy beach of the island with such force that passed completely over it and dashed into the woods, levelling the smaller trees and bushes in its headlong course!",say reef spout shore front bower considerable distance sea owe formation wave reach reef latter point strike foot spout instant touch reef become aware first time awful magnitude burst reef point roar seem louder thunder roar continue second wave roll cliff stand crest rear feel great danger turn flee late crash seem shake solid rock gigantic billow fall spout hole send gush water spout such force shriek issue narrow vent seem earth blow water stunn confuse shock drench blind spray know few moment flee shelter length gain eminence reach water scene devastation meet gaze look shore enormous wave burst reef continue way lagoon fall sandy beach island such force pass dash wood levell small tree bush headlong course 
12,"On seeing this, Jack said he feared our bower must have been swept away, and that the boat, which was on the beach, must have been utterly destroyed.  Our hearts sank within us as we thought of this, and we hastened round through the woods towards our home.  On reaching it we found, to our great relief of mind, that the force of the wave had been expended just before reaching the bower; but the entrance to it was almost blocked up by the torn-up bushes and tangled heaps of sea-weed. Having satisfied ourselves as to the bower, we hurried to the spot where the boat had been left; but no boat was there!  The spot on which it had stood was vacant, and no sign of it could we see on looking around us.",see say fear bower sweep boat beach destroy heart sink think hasten wood home reach find great relief mind force wave expend reach bower entrance block torn bush tangle heap sea weed satisfy bower hurry spot boat leave boat spot stand vacant sign see look 
13,"""It may have been washed up into the woods,"" said Jack, hurrying up the beach as he spoke.  Still, no boat was to be seen, and we were about to give ourselves over to despair, when Peterkin called to Jack and said,--",wash wood say hurry beach speak boat see about give despair call say 
14,"""Jack, my friend, you were once so exceedingly sagacious and wise as to make me acquainted with the fact that cocoa nuts grow upon trees; will you now be so good as to inform me what sort of fruit that is growing on the top of yonder bush? for I confess to being ignorant, or, at least, doubtful on the point.""",friend sagacious wise make acquainted fact cocoa nut grow tree good inform sort fruit grow top confess ignorant least doubtful point 
15,"We looked towards the bush indicated, and there, to our surprise, beheld our little boat snugly nestled among the leaves!  We were very much overjoyed at this, for we would have suffered any loss rather than the loss of our boat.  We found that the wave had actually borne the boat on its crest from the beach into the woods, and there launched it into the heart of this bush; which was extremely fortunate, for had it been tossed against a rock or a tree, it would have been dashed to pieces, whereas it had not received the smallest injury.  It was no easy matter, however, to get it out of the bush and down to the sea again.  This cost us two days of hard labour to accomplish.",look bush indicate surprise beheld little boat nestle leave overjoyed suffer loss loss boat find wave borne boat crest beach wood launch heart bush fortunate toss rock tree dash piece receive small injury easy matter get bush sea cost day hard labour accomplish 
16,"We had also much ado to clear away the rubbish from before the bower, and spent nearly a week in constant labour ere we got the neighbourhood to look as clean and orderly as before; for the uprooted bushes and sea-weed that lay on the beach formed a more dreadfully confused-looking mass than one who had not seen the place after the inundation could conceive.",have much ado clear rubbish bower spend week constant labour get neighbourhood look clean orderly uproot bush sea weed lay beach form confused look mass see place inundation conceive 
17,"Before leaving the subject I may mention, for the sake of those who interest themselves in the curious natural phenomena of our world, that this gigantic wave occurs regularly on some of the islands of the Pacific, once, and sometimes twice in the year.  I heard this stated by the missionaries during my career in those seas.  They could not tell me whether it visited all of the islands, but I was certainly assured that it occurred periodically in some of them.",leave subject mention sake interest curious natural phenomenon world gigantic wave occur island year hear state missionary career sea tell visit island assure occur 
18,"After we had got our home put to rights and cleared of the _debris_ of the inundation, we again turned our thoughts to paying the penguins a visit.  The boat was therefore overhauled and a few repairs done.  Then we prepared a supply of provisions, for we intended to be absent at least a night or two, perhaps longer.  This took us some time to do, for while Jack was busy with the boat, Peterkin was sent into the woods to spear a hog or two, and had to search long, sometimes, ere he found them. Peterkin was usually sent on this errand, when we wanted a pork chop (which was not seldom), because he was so active, and could run so wonderfully fast that he found no difficulty in overtaking the hogs; but, being dreadfully reckless, he almost invariably tumbled over stumps and stones in the course of his wild chase, and seldom returned home without having knocked the skin off his shins.  Once, indeed, a more serious accident happened to him.  He had been out all morning alone and did not return at the usual time to dinner.  We wondered at this, for Peterkin was always very punctual at the dinner hour.  As supper-time drew near we began to be anxious about him, and at length sallied forth to search the woods.  For a long time we sought in vain, but a little before dark we came upon the tracks of the hogs, which we followed up until we came to the brow of a rather steep bank or precipice.  Looking over this we beheld Peterkin lying in a state of insensibility at the foot, with his cheek resting on the snout of a little pig, which was pinned to the earth by the spear!  We were dreadfully alarmed, but hastened to bathe his forehead with water, and had soon the satisfaction of seeing him revive. After we had carried him home he related to as how the thing had happened.",get home put right clear _debris_ inundation turn thought pay penguin visit boat overhaul few repair do prepare supply provision intend absent least night take time do busy boat send wood spear hog have search find send errand want pork chop seldom active run find difficulty overtake hog reckless tumble stump stone course wild chase return knock skin shin serious accident happen morning return usual time dinner wonder punctual dinner hour supper time draw begin anxious length sall search wood long time seek vain little dark come track hog follow come brow steep bank precipice look beheld lie state insensibility foot cheek rest snout little pig pinn earth spear alarm hasten bathe forehead water have satisfaction see revive carry relate thing happen 
19,"""You must know,"" said he, ""I walked about all the forenoon, till I was as tired as an old donkey, without seeing a single grunter, not so much as a track of one; but, as I was determined not to return empty-handed, I resolved to go without my dinner and--""",know say walk forenoon tired old donkey see single grunter much track determined return empty handed resolve go dinner 
20,"""What!"" exclaimed Jack, ""did you _really_ resolve to do that?""",exclaim resolve do 
21,"""Now, Jack, hold your tongue,"" returned Peterkin; ""I say that I resolved to forego my dinner and to push to the head of the small valley, where I felt pretty sure of discovering the hogs.  I soon found that I was on the right scent, for I had scarcely walked half a mile in the direction of the small plum tree we found there the other day, when a squeak fell on my ear.  'Ho, ho,' said I, 'there you go, my boys;' and I hurried up the glen.  I soon started them, and singling out a fat pig, ran tilt at him. In a few seconds I was up with him, and stuck my spear right through his dumpy body.  Just as I did so, I saw that we were on the edge of a precipice, whether high or low I knew not, but I had been running at such a pace that I could not stop, so the pig and I gave a howl in concert and went plunging over together.  I remembered nothing more after that, till I came to my senses and found you bathing my temples, and Ralph wringing his hands over me.""",hold tongue return say resolve forego dinner push head small valley feel sure discover hog find right scent walk mile direction small plum tree find other day squeak fall ear say go boy hurry glen start single fat pig run tilt few second stick spear dumpy body do see edge precipice high low know run pace stop pig give howl concert go plung remember more come sense find bathing temple wring hand 
22,"But although Peterkin was often unfortunate, in the way of getting tumbles, he was successful on the present occasion in hunting, and returned before evening with three very nice little hogs.  I, also, was successful in my visit to the mud-flats, where I killed several ducks.  So that, when we launched and loaded our boat at sunrise the following morning, we found our store of provisions to be more than sufficient. Part had been cooked the night before, and, on taking note of the different items, we found the account to stand thus:--",unfortunate way get tumble successful present occasion hunting return evening nice little hog successful visit mud flat kill several duck launch load boat sunrise follow morning find store provision more sufficient part cook night take note different item find account stand 
23,"10 Bread-fruits, (two baked, eight unbaked.) 20 Yams, (six roasted, the rest raw.) 6 Taro roots. 50 Fine large plums. 6 Cocoa nuts, ripe. 6 Ditto green, (for drinking.) 4 Large ducks and two small ones, raw. 3 Cold roast pigs, with stuffing.",bread fruit bake unbake yam roast rest raw root fine large plum cocoa nut ripe ditto green drinking large duck small one raw cold roast pig stuff 
24,"I may here remark that the stuffing had been devised by Peterkin specially for the occasion.  He kept the manner of its compounding a profound secret, so I cannot tell what it was; but I can say, with much confidence, that we found it to be atrociously bad, and, after the first tasting, scraped it carefully out and threw it overboard.  We calculated that this supply would last us for several days, but we afterwards found that it was much more than we required, especially in regard to the cocoa nuts, of which we found large supplies wherever we went.  However, as Peterkin remarked, it was better to have too much than too little, as we knew not to what straits we might be put during our voyage.",remark stuff devise occasion keep manner compound profound secret tell say much confidence find bad first tasting scrape throw calculate supply last several day find more require regard cocoa nut find large supplies go remark good have much little know strait put voyage 
25,"It was a very calm sunny morning when we launched forth and rowed over the lagoon towards the outlet in the reef, and passed between the two green islets that guard the entrance.  We experienced some difficulty and no little danger in passing the surf of the breaker, and shipped a good deal of water in the attempt; but, once past the billow, we found ourselves floating placidly on the long oily swell that rose and fell slowly as it rolled over the wide ocean.",calm sunny morning launch row lagoon outlet reef pass green islet guard entrance experience difficulty little danger pass surf breaker ship good deal water attempt billow find float long oily swell rise fall roll wide ocean 
26,"Penguin Island lay on the other side of our own island, at about a mile beyond the outer reef, and we calculated that it must be at least twenty miles distant by the way we should have to go.  We might, indeed, have shortened the way by coasting round our island inside of the lagoon, and going out at the passage in the reef nearly opposite to Penguin Island, but we preferred to go by the open sea; first, because it was more adventurous; and, secondly, because we should have the pleasure of again feeling the motion of the deep, which we all loved very much, not being liable to sea sickness.",lay other side own island mile outer reef calculate least mile distant way have go shorten way coast island lagoon go passage reef prefer go open sea adventurous have pleasure feel motion deep love liable sea sickness 
27,"""I wish we had a breeze,"" said Jack.",wish have breeze say 
28,"""So do I,"" cried Peterkin, resting on his oar and wiping his heated brow; ""pulling is hard work.  Oh dear, if we could only catch a hundred or two of these gulls, tie them to the boat with long strings, and make them fly as we want them, how capital it would be!""",cry rest oar wipe heat brow pull hard work dear catch gull tie boat long string make fly want capital 
29,"""Or bore a hole through a shark's tail, and reeve a rope through it, eh?"" remarked Jack.  ""But, I say, it seems that my wish is going to be granted, for here comes a breeze.  Ship your oar, Peterkin.  Up with the mast, Ralph; I'll see to the sail.  Mind your helm; look out for squalls!""",bear hole shark tail reeve rope remark say seem wish go grant come breeze ship oar mast see sail mind helm look squall 
30,"This last speech was caused by the sudden appearance of a dark blue line on the horizon, which, in an incredibly short space of time, swept down on us, lashing up the sea in white foam as it went.  We presented the stern of the boat to its first violence, and, in a few seconds, it moderated into a steady breeze, to which we spread our sail and flew merrily over the waves.  Although the breeze died away soon afterwards, it had been so stiff while it lasted, that we were carried over the greater part of our way before it fell calm again; so that, when the flapping of the sail against the mast told us that it was time to resume the oars, we were not much more than a mile from Penguin Island.",last speech cause sudden appearance dark blue line horizon short space time sweep lash sea white foam go present stern boat first violence few second moderate steady breeze spread sail fly wave breeze die stiff last carry great part way fall calm flap sail mast tell time resume oar more mile 
31,"""There go the soldiers!"" cried Peterkin as we came in sight of it; ""how spruce their white trousers look, this morning!  I wonder if they will receive us kindly.  D'you think they are hospitable, Jack?""",go soldier cry come sight spruce white trousers look morning wonder receive think hospitable 
32,"""Don't talk, Peterkin, but pull away, and you shall see shortly.""",talk pull see 
33,"As we drew near to the island we were much amused by the manoeuvres and appearance of these strange birds.  They seemed to be of different species, for some had crests on their heads while others had none, and while some were about the size of a goose others appeared nearly as large as a swan.  We also saw a huge albatross soaring above the heads of the penguins.  It was followed and surrounded by numerous flocks of sea-gulls.  Having approached to within a few yards of the island, which was a low rock, with no other vegetation on it than a few bushes, we lay on our oars and gazed at the birds with surprise and pleasure, they returning our gaze with interest.  We now saw that their soldier-like appearance was owing to the stiff, erect manner in which they sat on their short legs,--""Bolt-up-right,"" as Peterkin expressed it.  They had black heads, long sharp beaks, white breasts, and bluish backs.  Their wings were so short that they looked more like the fins of a fish, and, indeed, we soon saw that they used them for the purpose of swimming under water.  There were no quills on these wings, but a sort of scaly feathers; which also thickly covered their bodies.  Their legs were short, and placed so far back that the birds, while on land, were obliged to stand quite upright in order to keep their balance; but in the water they floated like other water-fowl.  At first we were so stunned with the clamour which they and other sea-birds kept up around us, that we knew not which way to look,--for they covered the rocks in thousands; but, as we continued to gaze, we observed several quadrupeds (as we thought) walking in the midst of the penguins.",draw island amuse manoeuvre appearance strange bird seem different species have crest head other have size goose other appear large swan see huge albatross soar head penguin follow surround numerous flock sea gull approach few yard island low rock other vegetation few bush lay oar gaze bird surprise pleasure return gaze interest see soldier like appearance ow stiff erect manner sit short leg right express have black head long sharp beak white breast bluish back wing short look fin fish see use purpose swim water be quill wing sort scaly feather cover body leg short place bird land oblige stand order keep balance water float other water fowl first stunn clamour other sea bird keep know way look cover rock thousand continue gaze observe several quadruped think walk midst penguin 
34,"""Pull in a bit,"" cried Peterkin, ""and let's see what these are.  They must be fond of noisy company, to consort with such creatures.""",pull bit cry let see fond noisy company consort such creature 
35,"To our surprise we found that these were no other than penguins which had gone down on all fours, and were crawling among the bushes on their feet and wings, just like quadrupeds.  Suddenly one big old bird, that had been sitting on a point very near to us, gazing in mute astonishment, became alarmed, and, scuttling down the rocks, plumped or fell, rather than ran, into the sea.  It dived in a moment, and, a few seconds afterwards, came out of the water far a-head, with such a spring, and such a dive back into the sea again, that we could scarcely believe it was not a fish that had leaped in sport.",surprise find other penguin go four crawl bush foot wing quadruped big old bird sit point gaze mute astonishment become alarm scuttle rock plump fall run sea dive moment few second come water head spring dive sea believe fish leap sport 
36,"""That beats everything,"" said Peterkin, rubbing his nose, and screwing up his face with an expression of exasperated amazement.  ""I've heard of a thing being neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, but I never did expect to live to see a brute that was all three together,--at once--in one!  But look there!"" he continued, pointing with a look of resignation to the shore, ""look there! there's no end to it.  What _has_ that brute got under its tail?""",beat say rub nose screw face expression exasperated amazement hear thing fish flesh fowl expect live see brute look continue point look resignation shore look be end brute get tail 
37,"We turned to look in the direction pointed out, and there saw a penguin walking slowly and very sedately along the shore with an egg under its tail.  There were several others, we observed, burdened in the same way; and we found afterwards that these were a species of penguins that always carried their eggs so.  Indeed, they had a most convenient cavity for the purpose, just between the tail and the legs.  We were very much impressed with the regularity and order of this colony.  The island seemed to be apportioned out into squares, of which each penguin possessed one, and sat in stiff solemnity in the middle of it, or took a slow march up and down the spaces between.  Some were hatching their eggs, but others were feeding their young ones in a manner that caused us to laugh not a little.  The mother stood on a mound or raised rock, while the young one stood patiently below her on the ground.  Suddenly the mother raised her head and uttered a series of the most discordant cackling sounds.",turn look direction point see penguin walk shore egg tail be several other observe burden same way find species penguin carry egg have convenient cavity purpose tail leg impressed regularity order colony island seem apportion square penguin possess sit stiff solemnity middle take slow march space hatch egg other feed young one manner cause laugh little mother stand mound raise rock young one stand ground mother raise head utter series discordant cackling sound 
38,"""She's going to choke,"" cried Peterkin.",go choke cry 
39,"But this was not the case, although, I confess, she looked like it.  In a few seconds she put down her head and opened her mouth, into which the young one thrust its beak and seemed to suck something from her throat. Then the cackling was renewed, the sucking continued, and so the operation of feeding was carried on till the young one was satisfied; but what she fed her little one with, we could not tell.",case confess look few second put head open mouth young one thrust beak seem suck throat cackling renew sucking continue operation feeding carry young one satisfy feed little one tell 
40,"""Now, just look yonder!"" said Peterkin, in an excited tone; ""if that isn't the most abominable piece of maternal deception I ever saw.  That rascally old lady penguin has just pitched her young one into the sea, and there's another about to follow her example.""",look say excited tone abominable piece maternal deception see rascally old lady penguin pitch young one sea be follow example 
41,"This indeed seemed to be the cue, for, on the top of a steep rock close to the edge of the sea, we observed an old penguin endeavouring to entice her young one into the water; but the young one seemed very unwilling to go, and, notwithstanding the enticements of its mother, moved very slowly towards her.  At last she went gently behind the young bird and pushed it a little towards the water, but with great tenderness, as much as to say, 'Don't be afraid, darling!  I won't hurt you, my pet!' but no sooner did she get it to the edge of the rock, where it stood looking pensively down at the sea, than she gave it a sudden and violent push, sending it headlong down the slope into the water, where its mother left it to scramble ashore as it best could.  We observed many of them employed in doing this, and we came to the conclusion that this is the way in which old penguins teach their children to swim.",seem cue top steep rock edge sea observe old penguin endeavour entice young one water young one seem unwilling go notwithstand enticement mother move last go young bird push little water great tenderness much say afraid darling hurt pet get edge rock stand look sea give sudden violent push send slope water mother leave scramble good observe many employ do come conclusion way old penguin teach child swim 
42,"Scarcely had we finished making our remarks on this, when we were startled by about a dozen of the old birds hopping in the most clumsy and ludicrous manner towards the sea.  The beach, here, was a sloping rock, and when they came to it, some of them succeeded in hopping down in safety, but others lost their balance and rolled and scrambled down the slope in the most helpless manner.  The instant they reached the water, however, they seemed to be in their proper element.  They dived and bounded out of it and into it again with the utmost agility; and so, diving and bounding and spluttering, for they could not fly, they went rapidly out to sea.",finish make remark startle old bird hopping clumsy ludicrous manner sea beach slope rock come succeed hopping safety other lose balance roll scramble slope helpless manner instant reach water seem proper element dive bound utmost agility diving bound splutter fly go sea 
43,"On seeing this, Peterkin turned with a grave face to us and said, ""It's my opinion that these birds are all stark, staring mad, and that this is an enchanted island.  I therefore propose that we should either put about ship and fly in terror from the spot, or land valorously on the island, and sell our lives as dearly as we can.""",see turn grave face say opinion bird stark stare mad enchanted island propose put ship fly terror spot land island sell life 
44,"""I vote for landing, so pull in, lads,"" said Jack, giving a stroke with his oar that made the boat spin.  In a few seconds we ran the boat into a little creek where we made her fast to a projecting piece of coral, and, running up the beach, entered the ranks of the penguins armed with our cudgels and our spear.  We were greatly surprised to find that, instead of attacking us or showing signs of fear at our approach, these curious birds did not move from their places until we laid hands on them, and merely turned their eyes on us in solemn, stupid wonder as we passed. There was one old penguin, however, that began to walk slowly toward the sea, and Peterkin took it into his head that he would try to interrupt its progress, so he ran between it and the sea and brandished his cudgel in its face.  But this proved to be a resolute old bird.  It would not retreat; nay, more, it would not cease to advance, but battled with Peterkin bravely and drove him before it until it reached the sea.  Had Peterkin used his club he could easily have felled it, no doubt; but, as he had no wish to do so cruel an act merely out of sport, he let the bird escape.",vote land pull lad say give stroke oar make boat spin few second run boat little creek make project piece coral run beach enter rank penguin armed cudgel spear surprise find attack show sign fear approach curious bird move place lay hand turn eye solemn stupid wonder pass be old penguin begin walk sea take head try interrupt progress run sea brandish cudgel face prove resolute old bird retreat cease advance battle drive reach sea use club fell doubt have wish do cruel act sport let bird escape 
45,"We spent fully three hours on this island in watching the habits of these curious birds, and, when we finally left them, we all three concluded, after much consultation, that they were the most wonderful creatures we had ever seen; and further, we thought it probable that they were the most wonderful creatures in the world!",spend hour island watch habit curious bird leave conclude much consultation wonderful creature see think probable wonderful creature world
