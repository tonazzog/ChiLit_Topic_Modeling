1,CHAPTER XV.,
2," When Nod opened his eyes beneath the vast blue arch of the cavern, not a sign of the Men of the Mountains was to be seen. He sat for awhile watching his brothers humped up in sleep on the floor, and wondering rather dismally when they should have done with their troubles and come to the palace of their Uncle Assasimmon. He was blained and footsore; his small bones stuck out beneath his furry skin, his hands were cracked and scorched. And the keen high air of Arakkaboa made him gasp at every breath.",open eye vast blue arch cavern sign see sit watch brother hump sleep floor wonder do trouble come palace blain footsore small bone stick furry skin hand crack scorch keen high air make gasp breath 
3,"When Thumb awoke they sat quietly mumbling and talking together a while. Beyond the mouth of the cavern stood the beehive-houses of the Mountain-mulgars, each in its splash of lengthening shadow. Day drew on to evening. An eagle squalled in space. Else all was still; no living thing stirred. For these Men of the Mountains have no need to keep watch. They sleep secure in their white huts. None can come in, and none go out but first they must let down their ladders. Thumb scrambled up, and he and Nod hobbled off softly together to where the cataract hung like a shrine of hoarfrost in pillars of green ice from the frozen snows above. The evening was filled with light of the colour of a flower. Even the snow that capped the mountains was faintest violet and rose, and far in the distance, between the peaks of Zut and misty Solmi, stretched a band of darkest purple, above which the risen moon was riding in pale gold. And Nod knew that there, surely, must be Battle's Sea. He pointed Thumb to it, and the two Mulgars stood, legs bandy, teeth shining, eyes fixed. Nod gazed on it bewitched, till it seemed he almost saw the foam of its league-long billows rolling, and could catch in his thin round ear the roar and surge Battle had so often told him of. ""Ohé! if my Oomgar were but with me now!"" he thought. ""How would his eyes stare to see his friend the sea!""",awoke sit mumble talk while mouth cavern stand beehive house mulgar splash lengthen shadow day draw evening eagle squall space living thing stirr have need keep watch sleep secure white hut come go let ladder thumb scramble hobble cataract hang shrine hoarfrost pillar green ice freeze snow evening fill light colour flower snow cap mountain faintest violet rise distance peak misty stretch band dark purple rise moon ride pale gold know point thumb stand leg bandy tooth shine eye fix nod gaze bewitch seem see foam league long billow roll catch thin round ear roar surge tell think eye stare see friend sea 
4,"But the Men of the Mountains were now bestirring themselves. They came creeping, lean and hairy, out of their mushroom houses. Some fetched water, some looped down over the brink by which the travellers had come up. Some clambered up into little dark horseshoe courts cut in the rock like martins' holes in sand, and came down carrying sacks or suchlike out of their nut pantries and cheese-rooms. Some, too, of the elders sat combing their long beards with a kind of teasel that grows in the valleys, while their faint voices sounded in their gossiping like hundreds of grasshoppers in a meadow. Nod watched them curiously. Even the faces of quite the puny Mountain-mulgars were sad, with round and feeble eyes. And he couldn't help nudging Thumb to look at these tiny creatures gravely combing their hairy chops--for all had whiskers, from the brindled and grey, whose hair fell below their knees, to the mouse and cane coloured babies lying in basins or cradles of Ollaconda-bark, kicking their toes towards the brightening stars.",bestirr come creep lean hairy mushroom house fetched water loop brink traveller come clamber little dark horseshoe court cut rock hole sand come carry sack suchlike nut pantry cheese room elder sit comb long beard kind teasel grow valley faint voice sound gossiping hundred grasshopper meadow watch face puny mulgar sad round feeble eye help nudge thumb look tiny creature comb hairy chop have whisker brindle grey hair fall knee mouse cane coloured baby lie basin cradle bark kick toe brighten star 
5,"The moonlight dwelt in silver on every crag. And, like things so beautiful that they seem of another world, towered the mountains around them, clear as emeralds, and crowned with never-melting snow.",moonlight dwele silver crag thing beautiful seem world tower mountain clear emerald crown melt snow 
6,"Thimble, when he awoke, was fevered and aching. The heights had made his head dizzy, and the mountain cheese was sickly and faint. He lay at full length, with wandering eyes, refusing to speak. So, when the Mulla-moona sent for the three travellers, only Thumb and Nod went together. He was old, thin-haired and thick-skinned, and rather fat with eating of cheese; he wore a great loose hat of leopard-skin on his head. And he looked at them with his eyes wizened up as if they were creatures of no account. And he asked one of the Mountain-mulgars who stood near, Who were these strangers, and by whose leave they had come trespassing on the hill-walks of the Mountain-mulgars. ""Munza is your country,"" he said. ""The leaves are never still with you, thieves and gluttons, squealing and fighting and swinging by your tails!""",thimble awoke fever ach height make head dizzy mountain cheese sickly faint lay full length wonder eye refuse speak send traveller go old thin haired thick skinned fat eating cheese wear great loose hat leopard skin head look eye wizen creature account ask mulgar stand stranger leave come trespass hill walk mulgar country say leave thief glutton squeal fight swing tail 
7,"Thumb opened his mouth at this. ""We are three, and you are many, Old Man of the Mountains,"" he barked, ""but keep a civil tongue with us, for all that. We are neither thieves nor gluttons. We fight, oh yes, when it pleases us. But having no tails, we do not swing by them. We are Mulla-mulgars, my brothers and I, and we go to the kingdom of our father's brother, Assasimmon, Prince of the Valleys of Tishnar. He is a Prince, O Mulla-moona, who has more slaves in his palace and more Ukka-trees in the least of his seventy-seven gardens than your royal whiskers have hairs! On, then, we go! But be not afraid, Mulla-moona-mulgar. We will leave a few small stones of Arakkaboa behind us. But whether you will or whether you won't, on we go until the Harp sounds. Then our Meermuts will Tishnar welcome, and bid wander over these her mountains, never hungry, never thirsty, never footsore, with sweet-smelling lanterns to light us, and striped Zevveras to carry us, and gongs to make music. But if we live, Chief Mulgar of Kush, we will remember your words, I and my brother Ummanodda Nizza-neela, for he shall breathe them into a little book in the Zbaffle Oomgar's tongue for Prince Assasimmon to mock at in his Ummuz-fields.""",thumb open mouth many old bark keep civil tongue thief glutton fight please have tail swing mulgar brother go kingdom father brother have more slave palace tree least garden royal whisker have hair go afraid mulgar leave few small stone go sound bid wander mountain hungry thirsty footsore sweet smelling lantern light stripe carry gong make music live chief remember word brother breathe little book tongue mock field 
8,"Nod listened in wonder to this palaver. Had he, then, been talking in his sleep, that Thumb knew all about the Oomgar's little fat magic-book? The old Mountain-mulgar sat solemnly blinking, fingering the tassel of his long tail. He was a doleful and dirty fellow, and very sly.",nod listen wonder palaver talk sleep know little fat magic book old mulgar sit blink finger tassel long tail doleful dirty fellow sly 
9,"""Why,"" he said at last, ""I did but speak Munza fashion. Scratch if you itch, traveller. Even an Utt can grow angry. As for writing my words in the Oomgar's tongue, that is magic, and I understand it not. Rest in the cool of the shadow of Kush a little, and to-morrow my servants shall lead you as far across Arakkaboa as they know the way. But this I will tell you: Beyond Zut my paths go not."" He raised his pale eyes softly. ""But then, Meermuts need no paths, Mulla-mulgars.""",say last speak fashion scratch itch traveller grow angry write word tongue magic understand rest cool shadow little servant lead know way tell path go raise pale eye need path mulgar 
10,"Thumb laughed. ""All in good time, Prince,"" he said, showing his teeth. ""I begin to get an itching for this Zut. We will rest only one day. The Mulla-mulgar Thimbulla has a poor stomach for your green cheese. We will journey on to-morrow.""",thumb laugh good time say show tooth begin get itching rest day have poor stomach green cheese journey 
11,"The Mulla-moona then called an old Mulgar who stood by, whose name was Ghibba, and bade him take a rope (that is, about twenty) of the Mountain-mulgars with him to show the travellers the secret ""walks"" and passes across their country to the border round Zut. ""After that,"" he said, turning sourly to Thumb, ""though your Meermuts were three hundred and not three, and your Uncle, King Assasimmon, had more palaces than there are nuts on an Ukka-tree, I could help you no more. Sulâni, O Mulla-mulgars, and may Tishnar, before she scatters your bones, sweeten your tempers!""",call old stand name bid take rope mulgar show traveller secret walk pass country border say turn have more palace be nut tree help more mulgar scatter bone sweet temper 
12,And at that the old Mountain-man curled his tail over his shoulder and shut his eyes.,old man curl tail shoulder shut eye 
13,"When Thumb and Nod came into the great cavern again to Thimble, they found him helpless with pain and fever. He could not even lift his head from his green pillow. His eyes glowed in their bony hollows. And when Thumb stooped over him he screamed, ""Gunga! Gunga!"" as if in fear.",come great cavern find helpless pain fever lift head green pillow eye glow bony hollow stoop scream fear 
14,"Thumb turned and looked at Nod. ""We shall have to carry him, Ummanodda,"" he said. ""If he eats any more of their mouldy nuts and cheese our brother will die in these wild mountains. They must be sad stomachs that thrive on meat gone green with age. And now the physic is gone, and where shall we find more in these great hills of ice? We must carry him--we must carry him, Nodnodda.""",thumb turn look have carry say eat more mouldy nut cheese brother die wild mountain sad stomach thrive meat go green age physic gone find more great hill ice carry carry 
15,"Then Ghibba, who was standing near, understanding a little of what Thumb said, though he had spoken low in Mulgar-royal, called four of his twenty. And together they made a kind of sling or hammock or pallet out of their strands of Cullum, and cushioned it with hair and moss. For once every year these Mulgars shave all the hair off their bodies, and lie in chamber until it is grown again. By this means even the very old keep sleek and clean. With this hair they make a kind of tippet, also cushions and bedding of all sorts. It is a curious custom, but each, growing up, follows his father, and so does not perceive its oddness. Into this litter, then, they laid Thimble, and lifted him on to their shoulders by ropes at the corners, plaited thick, so as not to chafe the bearers. Then, the others laden with great faggots of wood and torches, bags of nuts and cheese, and skin bottles of milk, they passed through an arch in the wall of the cavern, and the travellers set out once more. All the Men of the Mountains came out with their little ones in the starlight and torch-flare to see them go. Even the old chief squinnied sulkily out of his hut, and spat on the ground when they were gone.",stand understand little say speak low royal call make kind sling hammock pallet strand cushion hair moss year shave hair body lie chamber grow mean old keep sleek clean hair make kind tippet cushion bedding sort curious custom grow follow father perceive oddness litter lay lift shoulder rope corner plait thick chafe bearer other laden great faggot wood torche bag nut cheese skin bottle milk pass arch wall cavern traveller set more come little one starlight torch flare see go old chief squinny hut spat ground gone 
16,"The Mulgar-path on the farther side of this arch was so wide that here and there trees hung over it with frost-tasselled branches. And a rare squabbling the little Mountain-owls made out of their holes in the rock to see the travellers' torches passing by. First walked six of the Men of the Mountains, two by two. Then came Thimble, tossing and gibbering on his litter. Close behind the litter followed Ghibba, walking between Thumb and Nod. And last, talking all together in their thin grasshopper voices, the other ten Mountain-mulgars with more bags, more faggots, and more burning torches. It was, as I have said, clear and starry weather. Far below them the valleys lay, their blackness fleeced with mist; high above them glittered the quiet ravines of ice and snow. So cold had it fallen again, Nod huddled himself close in his sheep's-jacket, buzzing quiet songs while he waddled along with his stick. So all night they walked without resting, except to change the litter-bearers.",path far side arch wide tree hang frost tassell branch rare squabbling little owl make hole rock see traveller torche pass walk come toss gibber litter close litter follow walk last talk thin grasshopper voice other mulgar more bag more faggot more burning torche say clear starry weather valley lay blackness fleece mist high glitter quiet ravine ice snow cold fall huddle close sheep jacket buzz quiet song waddle stick night walk resting change litter bearer 
17,"When dawn began to stir, they came to where the Mulgar-path widened awhile. Here many rock-conies dwelt that have, as it were, wings of skin with which they leap as if they flew. And here the travellers doused their torches, set Thimble down, and made breakfast. While they all sat eating together, on a narrow pass beneath them wound by another of the long-haired companies of the Men of the Mountains. From upper path to lower was about fifteen Mulgars deep, for that is how they measure their heights. All these Mulgars were laden with a kind of fresh green seaweed heaped up on their shallow head-baskets, and were come three days' journey from the sea from fetching it. This seaweed they eat in their soup, or raw, as a relish or salad. Perhaps they pit it against their cheese. Whether or no, its salt and refreshing savour rose up into the air as they walked. And Nod sniffed it gladly for simple friendship and memory of his master Battle.",dawn begin stir come path widen many rock cony dwele wing skin leap fly traveller douse torche set make breakfast sit eat narrow pass wind long haired company upper path low deep measure height laden kind fresh green seaweed heap shallow head basket come day journey sea fetch seaweed eat soup raw relish salad pit cheese salt refresh savour rise air walk sniff simple friendship memory master 
18,"Breakfast done, the snow-bobbins hopped down to pick up the crumbs. These little tufty birds, of the size of a plump bull-finch, but pure white, with coral eyes, hop among the Mountain-mulgar troops wheresoever they go, having a great fancy for their sour cheese-crumbs.",breakfast do snow bobbin hopp pick crumb little tufty bird size plump bull finch pure white coral eye hop mulgar troops go have great fancy sour cheese crumb 
19,"The Men of the Mountains then hung up on their rods or staves a kind of thick sheet or shadow-blanket, as they call it, woven of goats' wool and Ollaconda-fibre, under which they all hid themselves from the glare of the over-riding sun. Nod, too, and Thumb sat down in close shade beside Thimble's litter, and slept fitfully, tired out with their night-march, but anxious in the extreme for their brother.",hang rod stave kind thick sheet shadow blanket call wove goat wool fibre hide glare over riding sun sit close shade litter sleep tired night march anxious extreme brother 
20,"Towards about three, as we should say, or when the sun was three parts across his bridge, having wound up their shadow-blankets and made all shipshape, the little company of grey and brown Mulgars set out once more. Thimble, who had lain drowsy and panting, but quiet, during the day, now began to toss and rave as if in fear. His cries rang piercing and sorrowful against these stone walls, and even the hairy Mountain-men, who carried him in such patience slung between them, grew at last weary of his clamour, and shook his litter when he cried out, as if, indeed, that might quiet him.",say sun part bridge wind shadow blanket make shipshape little company grey brown set more lain drowsy panting quiet day begin toss rave fear cry ring pierce sorrowful stone wall hairy man carry such patience sling grow last weary clamour shake litter cry quiet 
21,"Nod stumped on for a long time in silence, listening to his brother's raving. ""O Thumb, what should we do,"" he broke out at last--""what should we do, you and me, if Thimble died?""",nod stump long time silence listen brother raving do break last do die 
22,"Thumb grunted. ""Thimble will not die, little brother.""",thumb grunt thimble die little brother

24,"""I never could tell how I know, Ummanodda; but know I do, and there's an end.""",tell know know be end

27,"""Ay,"" muttered Thumb, ""and being a Mulla-mulgar, he does not show it.""",mutter mulgar show 
28,"Nod turned his head away, blinked softly, shrugged up his jacket, but made no answer. And Thumb, in his kindness, and perhaps to ease his own spirits, too, broke out in his great seesaw voice into the Mulgar journey-song. High above the squabbling of the little Mountain-owls, high above the remote thunder of the surging waters in the ravine, into the clear air they raised their hoarse voices together:",turn head blink shrugg jacket make answer kindness ease own spirit break great seesaw voice journey song high squabbling little owl high remote thunder surge water ravine clear air raise hoarse voice

38,"It was a long song, and it lasted a long time, and so many were the verses, that at last even the Men of the Mountains caught up the crazy Mulgar drone and wheezily joined in, too. A very dismal music it was--so dismal, indeed, that many of the eagles who make their nests or eyries in the crevices and ledges of the topmost crags of Arakkaboa flew screaming into the air, sweeping on their motionless wings between the stars over the echoing precipices.",long song last long time many verse last catch crazy drone join dismal music dismal many eagle make nest eyrie crevice ledge topmost crag fly scream air sweep motionless wing star echoing precipice 
39,"The travellers had set to the last verse of the Journey-Song more lustily than ever, when of a sudden one of these eagles, crested, and bronze in the torchlight, swooped so close in its anger of the voices that it swept off Thumb's wool hat. In his haste he heedlessly struck at the shining bird with his staff or cudgel. Its scream rose sudden and piercing as it soared, dizzily wheeling in its anger, at evens with the glassy peak of Kush. Too late the Men of the Mountains cried out on Thumb to beware. In an instant the night was astir, the air forked with wings. From every peak the eagles swooped upon the Mulgars. And soon the travellers were fighting wildly to beat them off. They hastily laid poor Thimble down in his sling and covered up his eyes from the tumult with a shadow-blanket. And with sticks and staves and flaring torches they turned on the fierce birds that came sweeping and swirling out of the dark upon them on bristling feathers, with ravening beaks and talons. But against Thumb the eagles fought most angrily for his insult to their Prince, hovering with piercing battle-cry, their huge wings beating a dreadful wind upon his cowering head. Nod, while he himself was buffeting, ducking and dodging, could hear Thumb breathing and coughing and raining blows with his great cudgel. The moon was now sliding towards the mouth of Solmi's Valley, and her beams streamed aslant on the hosts of the birds. Wherever Nod looked, the air was aflock with eagles. His hand was torn and bleeding, a great piece of his sheep's-jacket had been plucked out, and still those moon-gilded wings swooped into the torchlight, beaks snapped almost in his face, and talons clutched at him.",traveller set last verse sudden one eagle crest bronze torchlight swoop close anger voice sweep wool hat haste strike shine bird staff cudgel scream rise sudden pierce soar wheel anger even glassy peak late cry beware instant night astir air fork wing peak eagle swoop traveller fight beat lay poor sling cover eye tumult shadow blanket stick stave flaring torche turn fierce bird come sweep swirl dark bristle feather ravening beak talon eagle fight insult hover pierce battle cry huge wing beat dreadful wind cower head buffet duck dodg hear thumb breathe cough rain blow great cudgel moon slide mouth beam stream aslant host bird look air aflock eagle hand torn bleed great piece sheep jacket pluck moon gilded wing swoop torchlight beak snap face talon clutch 
40,"Suddenly a scream rose shrill above all the din around him. For a moment the birds hung hovering, and then Nod perceived one of the biggest of the eagles struggling in mid-air with something stretched and wrestling upon its back. It was a Man of the Mountains floating there in space, while the maddened eagle rose and fell, and poised itself, and shook and beat its wings, vainly striving to tear him off. And now many other of the eagles wheeled off from the Mulgars and swept in frenzy to and fro over this struggling horse and rider, darting upon them, beating the dying Mulgar with their wings, screaming their war-song, until at last, gradually, lower and lower they all sank out of the moonlight into the shadow of the valley, and were lost to sight. The few birds that remained were soon beaten off. Five lay dead in their beautiful feathers on the pass. And the breathless and bleeding Mulgars gathered together on this narrow shelf of the precipice to bind up their wounds and rest and eat. But three of them were nowhere to be found. They made no answer, though their friends called and called, again and again, in their shrill reedy voices. For one in fighting had stumbled and toppled over, torch in hand, from the path, one had been slit up by an eagle's claw, and one had been carried off by the eagles.",scream rise shrill din moment bird hang hover perceive big eagle struggle mid-air stretch wrestle back float space madden eagle rise fall poise shake beat wing striving tear many other eagle wheel sweep frenzy for struggle horse rider dart beat die wing scream war song last low low sink moonlight shadow valley lose sight few bird remain beat lay dead beautiful feather pass breathless bleeding gather narrow shelf precipice bind wound rest eat find make answer friend call call shrill reedy voice fighting stumble topple torch hand path slit eagle claw carry eagle
