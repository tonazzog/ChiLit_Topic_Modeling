2," “FANCY seeing you!” cried his Majesty, as we sat down beside the Fish under the gombobble tree. “How ever did you get here? And what’s the news at Why?”",fancy see cry sit gombobble tree get news 
3,"“Oh, thad’s a log story,” said A. Fish, Esq., and proceeded to tell us how that after we had escaped from Why, by means of the shute, there had been a great commotion in the place, and the Doctor-in-Law was furious. He declared that we should not slip through his hands in this way, and had a long conversation with the Sister-in-Law and the others as to the best way of affecting our capture. Finally they decided to attach themselves to a long rope, and come down the shute in pursuit of us.",log story say proceed tell escape means shute be great commotion place furious declare slip hand way have long conversation other good way affect capture decide attach long rope come shute pursuit 
4,"A. Fish, Esq., made the excuse that his cold was too bad to permit him to join the party, and waited till they had got a good way down, and then cut the rope. He thought that this would be the best way of being of service to us. And so it was, of course, for goodness only knows where our pursuers were by this time.",make excuse cold bad permit join party wait get good way cut rope think good way service course goodness know pursuer time 
5,"A little while after he had cut the rope A. Fish, Esq., came across the Crow, who told him that he had been informed by two duffer birds (which was the name of the curious blue birds which we had noticed) that we were here at Wer-har-wei, and had immediately set about to discover the best way to get here.",little while cut rope come tell inform duffer bird name curious blue bird notice set discover good way get 
6,"He went in the first place to the station-master at Why, and found him, as usual, engaged in squabbling with the porter.",go first place station master find usual engage squabble porter 
7,They were arguing as to whether a certain signal should be up or down.,argue certain signal 
8,"The station-master declared that the signal should always be up on the up line and down on the down line. This the porter would not agree to, so it was at last decided to put one up and one down and leave them so, and then the engine-drivers could do as they pleased about going on or stopping.",station master declare signal up line down line porter agree last decide put leave engine driver do pleased go stop 
9,[AS USUAL THE STATION-MASTER WAS SQUABBLING WITH THE PORTER.],usual station master squab 
10,"When they had quite settled this dispute, A. Fish, Esq., had asked them if there were any trains running between Why and this place, and at first they had said no; but presently the porter remembered that there was a certain train which started on some days and went no one knew where.",settle dispute ask be train run place first say porter remember be certain train start day go know 
11,"No one was ever known to travel by it, and the engine-driver, who was an old salamander by the name of Mike, was deaf and dumb, and could neither read nor write, so that they had never been able to find out from him where his train went to. It had some letters on it which corresponded with those on the station-master’s collar, but no one had ever been able to discover what they meant. They were popularly supposed to stand for Weary Waiting and Horribly Wobbly Railway, the initials on the station-master’s collar being W.W.H.W.R., but A. Fish, Esq., had by a brilliant inspiration come to the conclusion that they stood for Why and Wer-har-wei Railway, and when the train, which consisted of only one carriage and the engine, came into the station, he jumped in, to the intense surprise of Mike, who had never had a passenger before, and who in his agitation recklessly put two shovelfuls of coal into the furnace, and, giving a frantic “toot” on the whistle, started off at full speed.",know travel engine driver old salamander name deaf dumb read write able find train go have letter correspond station master collar able discover mean suppose stand weary wobbly initial station master collar have brilliant inspiration come conclusion stand train consist carriage engine come station jump intense surprise have passenger agitation put shovelful coal furnace give frantic toot whistle start full speed 
12,"“It was a dreadful journey,” said A. Fish, Esq., “ad I dever had so bedy ups and dowds id all by life.”",dreadful journey say ad have bedy up dowd id life 
13,"We didn’t quite understand what he meant by this at the moment, but a little later on we discovered the reason to our cost.",understand mean moment little discover reason cost 
14,"After an eventful journey, A. Fish, Esq., had arrived at this place, and had found on alighting from the train that no one was to be seen, and he was just about to kick at the door of Ho-Lor’s house when Kis-Smee came bounding out. Poor A. Fish, Esq., had been terribly alarmed, and had made for the nearest tree, and was vainly trying to climb up into it when we made our appearance.",eventful journey arrive place find alighting train see about kick door house come bound poor alarmed make near tree try climb make appearance 
15,"“If I were you,” he advised, “I should certaidly cub back to Why at odce, for the people all seeb to be rejoiced thad Madame and the Doctor-id-Law have gode away, ad I think thad they would willingly forgive you for having said, ‘Ad horse! ad horse! by kigdob for ad horse!’”",advise cub odce person seeb rejoice id go ad think forgive say ad horse ad horse kigdob ad horse 
16,"After talking the matter over for a few minutes we decided that perhaps it would be the best thing to do, and as the little blue station was only just at the back of Ho-Lor’s house we thought that perhaps by hurrying we should catch the same train back to Why by which A. Fish, Esq., had come. So we set out to try and find the little blue people, to bid them “good-by,” and thank them for their hospitality.",talk matter few minute decide good thing do little blue station back house think hurry catch same train come set try find little blue person bid good thank hospitality 
17,"We found them at the station sitting beside Mike, to whom it appeared they were in the habit of being very kind on his occasional visits.",find station sit appear habit kind occasional visit 
18,"They seemed quite sorry to hear that we were leaving them so soon, and insisted upon making the Wallypug a present of Kis-Smee, and of stuffing into my pocket an enormous gombobble as a souvenir of my visit. Then there was just time to look at the “train” before we started. I must say that of all crazy, ramshackle affairs it was quite the worst that I had ever seen. To begin with, the wheels were all sorts of shapes, and not one of them was quite round. There was only one compartment, and that had no windows in it. And the engine! Well, it was something like Puffing Billy, only a little worse.",seem sorry hear leave insist make present stuff pocket enormous gombobble souvenir visit be time look train start say crazy ramshackle affair bad see begin wheel sort shape be compartment have window engine little bad 
19,"There was no room for Kis-Smee in the carriage, so we were obliged to chain him up on the roof, evidently much to his disgust.",be room carriage oblige chain roof much disgust 
20,"I must confess to a certain feeling of uneasiness when, having taken our seats, the engine gave a snort, and puffing out a volume of dense black smoke and smuts, started us on our journey.",confess certain feeling uneasiness take seat engine give snort puffing volume dense black smoke smut start journey 
21,"By reason of the odd shape of our wheels and the unevenness of the rails the carriage pitched and tossed about like a ship at sea, and our passage over a little wooden viaduct, where on either side the little blue people stood waving their adieux with quaint little flags, was, I am convinced, attended with considerable danger.",reason odd shape wheel unevenness rail carriage pitch toss ship sea passage little wooden viaduct side little blue person stand wave adieux quaint little flag convinced attend considerable danger 
22,"It was really a dreadful journey. The carriage pitched backward and forward, and rolled from side to side with every revolution of the wheels, while poor Kis-Smee, on the top, kept slipping about in the most painful manner. His Majesty’s carpet-bag, which had not been securely fastened to the top of the carriage, slipped off soon after we started, and though we rang the bell violently Mike refused to stop, and it was lost forever.",dreadful journey carriage pitch roll side side revolution wheel poor top keep slip painful manner carpet bag fasten top carriage slip start ring bell refuse stop lose 
23,“Fortunately there was not much in it!” his Majesty gasped between the jerks which the irregular motion of the train occasioned. “Only a tooth-brush and small cake of soap.”,be much majesty gasp jerk irregular motion train occasion tooth brush small cake soap 
24,[The carriage pitched backward and rolled from side to side.—Page 138.   _Wallypugland._],carriage pitch roll side side page 
25,"“But it felt quite full,” I remarked in surprise.",feel full remark surprise 
26,"“Yes,” explained his Majesty. “I stuffed it full of paper and things, because I thought that it would look so bad for a king to be traveling about without any luggage.”",explain stuff full paper thing think look bad king travel luggage 
27,"Just then there was a yelp and a howl from Kis-Smee, and looking out of the window we found that the poor creature had fallen from the roof and was hanging down by the chain which was attached to the top of the carriage, and was in momentary danger of being strangled.",be yelp howl look window find poor creature fall roof hang chain attach top carriage momentary danger strangle 
28,"We managed, after a prolonged struggle, to haul him in through the window, and, although we were rather crowded, to find room for him in the carriage. We had hardly settled down into our places, however, before the train came to a standstill, and Mike came to the door in a great state of agitation.",manage prolonged struggle haul window crowd find room carriage settle place train come standstill come door great state agitation 
29,"“Av yez plaze, sor,” he began.",begin 
30,"“Why! I thought you were deaf and dumb,” I cried.",think deaf dumb cry 
31,"“Och—that’s all gammon sure—oi can talk all roight, and hear all roight too when it suits me purpose. Well, now, ye see when the dog fell off the roof he upset me coal-scuttle, and never a bit of coal is there left. Would ye be good enough, kind gentlemen, to go back and pick some up off the line, it’s only about a moile and a half back.”",gammon sure oi talk roight hear roight suit purpose see dog fall roof upset coal scuttle bit coal left good kind gentleman go pick line moile half back 
32,"The engine, it appeared, could not be reversed, and, as there was no chance of getting a supply anywhere else, nothing remained but for his Majesty and myself to go back with the coal-scuttle and pick some of the spilt coal up.",engine appear reverse be chance get supply remain go coal scuttle pick spilt coal 
33,"Kis-Smee bounded delightedly at our side; but we did not take A. Fish, Esq., with us, as he complained of a pain in his tail, and we feared that the long walk might make it worse.",bound side take complain pain tail fear long walk make bad 
34,"“I shall amuse byself while you are away by giving Bike ad elocutiod lessod,” he said, as we left him.",amuse byself give bike ad elocutiod lessod say leave 
35,"But Mike, who was undoing his bundle preparatory to having some dinner, did not look very enthusiastic over the project, and I am almost certain I heard him mutter, “Not if I know it,” as we were walking away.",undoing bundle preparatory have dinner look enthusiastic project certain hear mutter know walk 
36,"We found the coal, as we expected, beside the line, after we had walked a little over a mile, and his Majesty and myself picked it up, and packing it in the scuttle, took turns in carrying it back to the train again.",find coal expect line walk little mile pick pack scuttle take turn carry train 
37,"We had nearly arrived at the spot where the train was waiting for us, when his Majesty noticed some curious flowers growing in a little copse beside the line, and we put down our coal-scuttle and went to gather them. While we were doing so, however, we heard a wild shout, and looking up beheld an enormously tall and thin man running towards us, gesticulating violently.",arrive spot train wait notice curious flower grow little copse line put coal scuttle go gather do hear wild shout look beheld tall thin man run gesticulate 
38,He was waving some wire and leather dog muzzles in one hand.,wave wire leather dog muzzle hand

40,"“Where’s his muzzle?” he demanded, pointing to Kis-Smee. “Can’t you see the dog is mad and must be muzzled immediately?”",muzzle demand point see dog mad muzzle 
41,"“I’m sure he’s not,” cried the Wallypug, indignantly, and patting Kis-Smee’s head.",sure cry pat head 
42,"“He is,” declared the man. “All dogs are mad, and I insist upon them being muzzled.”",declare man dog mad insist muzzle 
43,"“Very well,” I interposed. “You had better try and put a muzzle on this one yourself.”",interpose have good try put muzzle one 
44,"“Oh! I’ll soon do that,” cried the man, selecting a large muzzle from the collection which he carried with him. “Come here, sir! Good dog, then.”",do cry man select large muzzle collection carry come sir good dog 
45,"Kis-Smee growled, and grinning more than ever made a dart at the man, who dropped his muzzles and fled, screaming, “Mad dog! Mad dog!” at the top of his voice.",growl grinn more make dart man drop muzzle flead scream mad dog mad dog top voice 
46,"His Majesty and myself, laughing heartily at his discomfiture, hurried back to the train without meeting with any further adventures.",laugh discomfiture hurry train meet further adventure 
47,"A. Fish, Esq., and Mike seemed to be rather cool towards each other, I thought, and I heard afterwards that they had not got on at all well with the “elocution” lesson—in fact, Mike had absolutely refused to be instructed in that very necessary art.",seem cool other think hear get elocution lesson fact refuse instruct necessary art 
48,"Of course we told them of our adventure with the man in the wood, and Mike explained that he was well known as “The Long Man of Muzzledom,” and was quite harmless, though rather silly, being under the impression that all dogs and cats were mad and should be muzzled.",course tell adventure man wood explain know long harmless silly impression dog cat mad muzzle 
49,"“Well, he didn’t muzzle Kis-Smee, anyhow,” said his Majesty, as we took our seats in the carriage, and the train once more started for Why.",muzzle say take seat carriage train start 
50,"After several hours of bumping and jolting, we were delighted to see the familiar towers and gables of his Majesty’s palace in the distance, and knew that we had at last arrived at the end of our journey.",several hour bump jolt delighted see familiar tower gable palace distance know last arrive end journey
