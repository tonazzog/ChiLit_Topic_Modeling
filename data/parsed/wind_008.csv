1,CHAPTER VIII. THE EAST WINDOW,window 
2," THAT Diamond had fallen fast asleep is very evident from the strange things he now fancied as taking place. For he thought he heard a sound as of whispering up in the great window. He tried to open his eyes, but he could not. And the whispering went on and grew louder and louder, until he could hear every word that was said. He thought it was the Apostles talking about him. But he could not open his eyes.",fall asleep evident strange thing fancy take place think hear sound whisper great window try open eye whispering go grow louder louder hear word say think talk open eye 
3,"“And how comes he to be lying there, St. Peter?” said one.",come lie say 
4,"“I think I saw him a while ago up in the gallery, under the Nicodemus window. Perhaps he has fallen down.",think see while gallery window fall 
5,"“What do you think, St. Matthew?”",think 
6,“I don’t think he could have crept here after falling from such a height. He must have been killed.”,think creep fall height kill 
7,"“What are we to do with him? We can’t leave him lying there. And we could not make him comfortable up here in the window: it’s rather crowded already. What do you say, St. Thomas?”",do leave lie make comfortable window crowd say 
8,“Let’s go down and look at him.”,let go look 
9,"There came a rustling, and a chinking, for some time, and then there was a silence, and Diamond felt somehow that all the Apostles were standing round him and looking down on him. And still he could not open his eyes.",come rustling chinking time be silence feel stand look open eye 
10,"“What is the matter with him, St. Luke?” asked one.",matter ask 
11,"“There’s nothing the matter with him,” answered St. Luke, who must have joined the company of the Apostles from the next window, one would think. “He’s in a sound sleep.”",be matter answer join company next window think sound sleep 
12,"“I have it,” cried another. “This is one of North Wind’s tricks. She has caught him up and dropped him at our door, like a withered leaf or a foundling baby. I don’t understand that woman’s conduct, I must say. As if we hadn’t enough to do with our money, without going taking care of other people’s children! That’s not what our forefathers built cathedrals for.”",have cry trick catch drop door wither leaf foundling baby understand woman conduct say have enough do money go take care other person child forefather build cathedral 
13,"Now Diamond could not bear to hear such things against North Wind, who, he knew, never played anybody a trick. She was far too busy with her own work for that. He struggled hard to open his eyes, but without success.",bear hear such thing know play trick busy own work struggle open eye success 
14,"“She should consider that a church is not a place for pranks, not to mention that we live in it,” said another.",consider church place prank mention live say 
15,“It certainly is disrespectful of her. But she always is disrespectful. What right has she to bang at our windows as she has been doing the whole of this night? I daresay there is glass broken somewhere. I know my blue robe is in a dreadful mess with the rain first and the dust after. It will cost me shillings to clean it.”,disrespectful disrespectful right have bang window do whole night be glass break know blue robe dreadful mess rain first dust cost shilling clean 
16,"Then Diamond knew that they could not be Apostles, talking like this. They could only be the sextons and vergers and such-like, who got up at night, and put on the robes of deans and bishops, and called each other grand names, as the foolish servants he had heard his father tell of call themselves lords and ladies, after their masters and mistresses. And he was so angry at their daring to abuse North Wind, that he jumped up, crying--“North Wind knows best what she is about. She has a good right to blow the cobwebs from your windows, for she was sent to do it. She sweeps them away from grander places, I can tell you, for I’ve been with her at it.”",know talk sexton verger such get night put robe dean bishop call other grand name foolish servant hear father tell call lord lady master mistress angry dare abuse jump cry know good have good right blow cobweb window send do sweep grander place tell 
17,"This was what he began to say, but as he spoke his eyes came wide open, and behold, there were neither Apostles nor vergers there--not even a window with the effigies of holy men in it, but a dark heap of hay all about him, and the little panes in the roof of his loft glimmering blue in the light of the morning. Old Diamond was coming awake down below in the stable. In a moment more he was on his feet, and shaking himself so that young Diamond’s bed trembled under him.",begin say speak eye come open be verger window effigy holy man dark heap hay little pane roof loft glimmer blue light morning old come stable moment foot shake young bed tremble 
18,"“He’s grand at shaking himself,” said Diamond. “I wish I could shake myself like that. But then I can wash myself, and he can’t. What fun it would be to see Old Diamond washing his face with his hoofs and iron shoes! Wouldn’t it be a picture?”",grand shake say wish shake wash fun see old wash face hoof iron shoe picture 
19,"So saying, he got up and dressed himself. Then he went out into the garden. There must have been a tremendous wind in the night, for although all was quiet now, there lay the little summer-house crushed to the ground, and over it the great elm-tree, which the wind had broken across, being much decayed in the middle. Diamond almost cried to see the wilderness of green leaves, which used to be so far up in the blue air, tossing about in the breeze, and liking it best when the wind blew it most, now lying so near the ground, and without any hope of ever getting up into the deep air again.",say get dress go garden be tremendous wind night quiet lay little summer house crush ground great elm tree wind break decay middle cry see wilderness green leave use blue air toss breeze like good wind blow most lie ground hope get deep air 
20,“I wonder how old the tree is!” thought Diamond. “It must take a long time to get so near the sky as that poor tree was.”,wonder old tree think take long time get sky poor tree 
21,"“Yes, indeed,” said a voice beside him, for Diamond had spoken the last words aloud.",say voice speak last word 
22,"Diamond started, and looking around saw a clergyman, a brother of Mrs. Coleman, who happened to be visiting her. He was a great scholar, and was in the habit of rising early.",start look see clergyman brother happen visit great scholar habit rise 
23,"“Who are you, my man?” he added.",man add 
24,"“Little Diamond,” answered the boy.",little answer boy 
25,“Oh! I have heard of you. How do you come to be up so early?”,hear come 
26,"“Because the sham Apostles talked such nonsense, they waked me up.”",sham talk such nonsense wake 
27,"The clergyman stared. Diamond saw that he had better have held his tongue, for he could not explain things.",clergyman stare see hold tongue explain thing 
28,"“You must have been dreaming, my little man,” said he. “Dear! dear!” he went on, looking at the tree, “there has been terrible work here. This is the north wind’s doing. What a pity! I wish we lived at the back of it, I’m sure.”",dreaming little man say dear dear go look tree be terrible work north wind do pity wish live back sure 
29,“Where is that sir?” asked Diamond.,sir ask 
30,"“Away in the Hyperborean regions,” answered the clergyman, smiling.",region answer clergyman smile 
31,"“I never heard of the place,” returned Diamond.",hear place return 
32,"“I daresay not,” answered the clergyman; “but if this tree had been there now, it would not have been blown down, for there is no wind there.”",answer clergyman tree blow be wind 
33,"“But, please, sir, if it had been there,” said Diamond, “we should not have had to be sorry for it.”",sir say have sorry 
34,“Certainly not.”,
35,"“Then we shouldn’t have had to be glad for it, either.”",have glad 
36,"“You’re quite right, my boy,” said the clergyman, looking at him very kindly, as he turned away to the house, with his eyes bent towards the earth. But Diamond thought within himself, “I will ask North Wind next time I see her to take me to that country. I think she did speak about it once before.”",right boy say clergyman look turn house eye bend earth think ask next time see take country think speak
