2," Alfred and Martin brought in the wolf which Emma had killed, but it was frozen so hard that they could not skin it. Poor little Trim was also carried in, but the ground was too hard frozen for them to bury the body, so they put it into the snow until the spring, when a thaw would take place. As for the wolf, they said nothing about it, but they remained up when the rest of the family retired, and after the wolf had been some time before the fire, they were able to take off the skin.",bring wolf kill freeze skin poor little trim carry ground hard freeze bury body put snow spring thaw take place wolf say remain rest family retire wolf time fire able take skin 
3,"On the following morning, when the hunters went out, they were particularly desired to shoot a wild turkey if they could, as the next day was Christmas-day.",follow morning hunter go desire shoot wild turkey next day day 
4,"""Let us take Oscar with us,"" said Alfred; ""he is very swift, and may run them down; we never can get up with them in our snow-shoes.""",let take say swift run get snow shoe 
5,"""I wonder whether they will get a turkey,"" said Emma, after the hunting party had left.",wonder get turkey say hunting party leave 
6,"""I think it will be difficult,"" said Mrs. Campbell; ""but they will try all they can.""",think difficult say try 
7,"""I hope they will; for Christmas-day without a turkey will be very un-English.""",hope day turkey un 
8,"""We are not in England, my dear Emma,"" said Mr. Campbell; ""and wild turkeys are not to be ordered from the poulterer's.""",dear say wild turkey order poulterer 
9,"""I know that we are not in England, my dear uncle, and I feel it too. How was the day before every Christmas-day spent at Wexton Hall! What piles of warm blankets, what a quantity of duffil cloaks, flannels, and worsted stockings were we all so busy and so happy in preparing and sorting to give away on the following morning, that all within miles of us should be warmly clothed on that day. And, then, the housekeeper's room with all the joints of meat, and flour and plums and suet, in proportion to the number of each family, all laid out and ticketed ready for distribution. And then the party invited to the servants' hall, and the great dinner, and the new clothing for the school-girls, and the church so gay, with their new dresses in the aisles, and the holly and the mistletoe. I know we are not in England, my dear uncle, and that you have lost one of your greatest pleasures--that of doing good, and making all happy around you.""",know dear uncle feel day day spend pile warm blanket quantity duffil cloak flannel worsted stocking busy happy prepare sort give follow morning mile cloth day housekeeper room joint meat flour plum suet proportion number family lay ticket ready distribution party invite servant hall great dinner new clothing school girl church gay new dress aisle holly mistletoe know dear uncle lose great pleasure do good make happy 
10,"""Well, my dear Emma, if I have lost the pleasure of doing good, it is the will of Heaven that it should be so, and we ought to be thankful that, if not dispensing charity, at all events, we are not the objects of charity to others; that we are independent, and earning an honest livelihood. People may be very happy, and feel the most devout gratitude on the anniversary of so great a mercy, without having a turkey for dinner.""",dear lose pleasure do good will thankful dispens charity event object charity other independent earn honest livelihood person happy feel devout gratitude anniversary great mercy have turkey dinner 
11,"""I was not in earnest about the turkey, my dear uncle. It was the association of ideas connected by long habit, which made me think of our Christmas times at Wexton Hall; but, indeed, my dear uncle, if there was regret, it was not for myself so much as for you,"" replied Emma, with tears in her eyes.",earnest turkey dear uncle association idea connect long habit make think time dear uncle be regret much reply tear eye 
12,"""Perhaps I spoke rather too severely, my dearest Emma,"" said Mr. Campbell; ""but I did not like to hear such a solemn day spoken of as if it were commemorated merely by the eating of certain food.""",speak dearest say like hear solemn day speak commemorate eating certain food 
13,"""It was foolish of me,"" replied Emma? ""and it was said thoughtlessly.""",foolish reply say 
14,"Emma went up to Mr. Campbell and kissed him, and Mr. Campbell said, ""Well, I hope there will be a turkey, since you wish for one.""",go kiss say hope be turkey wish 
15,"The hunters did not return till late, and when they appeared in sight, Percival, who had descried them, came in and said that they were very well loaded, and were bringing in their game slung upon a pole.",hunter return appear sight descry come say load bring game sling pole 
16,"Mary and Emma went out of the door to meet their cousins. That there was a heavy load carried on a pole between Martin and Alfred was certain, but they could not distinguish what it consisted of. As the party arrived at the palisade gates, however, they discovered that it was not game, but a human being, who was carried on a sort of litter made of boughs.",go door meet cousin be heavy load carry pole certain distinguish consist party arrive palisade gate discover game human being carry sort litter make bough 
17,"""What is it, Alfred?"" said Mary.",say 
18,"""Wait till I recover my breath,"" said Alfred, as he reached the door, ""or ask Henry, for I'm quite knocked up.""",wait recover breath say reach door ask knock 
19,"Henry then went with his cousins into the house, and explained to them that as they were in pursuit of the wild turkeys, Oscar had stopped suddenly and commenced baying; that they went up to the dog, and, in a bush, they found a poor Indian woman nearly frozen to death, and with a dislocation of the ankle, so severe that her leg was terribly swelled, and she could not move. Martin had spoken to her in the Indian tongue, and she was so exhausted with cold and hunger that she could just tell him that she belonged to a small party of Indians who had been some days out hunting, and a long way from where they had built their winter lodges; that she had fallen with the weight which she had carried, and that her leg was so bad, she could not go on with them; that they had taken her burden, and left her to follow them when she could.",go cousin house explain pursuit wild turkey stop commence bay go dog bush find poor indian woman freeze death dislocation ankle severe leg swell move speak indian tongue exhausted cold hunger tell belong small party day hunting long way build winter lodge fall weight carry leg bad go take burden leave follow 
20,"""Yes,"" continued Alfred; ""left the poor creature without food, to perish in the snow. One day more, and it would have been all over with her. It is wonderful how she can have lived through the two last nights as she has. But Martin says the Indians always do leave a woman to perish in this way or recover as she can, if she happens to meet with an accident.""",continue leave poor creature food perish snow day more wonderful live last night have say leave woman perish way recover happen meet accident 
21,"""At all events, let us bring her in at once,"" said Mr. Campbell. ""I will first see if my surgical assistance can be of use, and after that we will do what we can for her. How far from this did you find her?""",event let bring say see surgical assistance use do find 
22,"""About eight miles,"" replied Henry; ""and Alfred has carried her almost the whole way; Martin and I have relieved each other, except once, when I took Alfred's place.""",mile reply carry whole way relieve other take place 
23,"""And so you perceive, Emma, instead of a wild turkey I have brought an Indian squaw,"" said Alfred.",perceive wild turkey bring indian squaw say 
24,"""I love you better for your kindness, Alfred,"" replied Emma, ""than if you had brought me a wagon-load of turkeys.""",love good kindness reply bring wagon load turkey 
25,"In the meantime, Martin and Henry brought in the poor Indian, and laid her down on the floor at some distance from the fire, for though she was nearly dead with the cold, too sudden an exposure to heat would have been almost equally fatal. Mr. Campbell examined her ankle, and with a little assistance reduced the dislocation. He then bound up her leg and bathed it with warm vinegar, as a first application. Mrs. Campbell and the two girls chafed the poor creature's limbs till the circulation was a little restored, and then they gave her something warm to drink. It was proposed by Mrs. Campbell that they should make up a bed for her on the floor of the kitchen. This was done in a corner near the fire-place, and in about an hour their patient fell into a sound sleep.",meantime bring poor lay floor distance fire dead cold sudden exposure heat fatal examine ankle little assistance reduce dislocation bind leg bath warm vinegar first application girl chafe poor creature limb circulation little restore give warm drink propose make bed floor kitchen do corner fire place hour patient fall sound sleep 
26,"""It is lucky for her that she did not fall into that sleep before we found her,"" said Martin; ""she would never have awoke again.""",lucky fall sleep find say awoke 
27,"""Most certainly not,"" replied Mr. Campbell. ""Have you any idea what tribe she is of, Martin?""",reply have idea tribe 
28,"""Yes, sir; she is one of the Chippeways; there are many divisions of them, but I will find out when she awakes again to which she belongs; she was too much exhausted when we found her, to say much.""",sir be many division find awake belong exhausted find say much 
29,"""It appears very inhuman leaving her to perish in that way,"" observed Mrs. Campbell.",appear inhuman leave perish way observe 
30,"""Well, ma'am, so it does; but necessity has no law. The Indians could not, if they would, have carried her, perhaps one hundred miles. It would have probably been the occasion of more deaths, for the cold is too great now for sleeping out at nights for any time, although they do contrive with the help of a large fire to stay out sometimes.""",necessity have law carry mile occasion more death cold great sleep night time contrive help large fire stay 
31,"""Self-preservation is the first law of nature, certainly,"" observed Mr. Campbell; ""but, if I recollect right the savage does not value the life of a woman very highly.""",self preservation first law nature observe recollect savage value life woman 
32,"""That's a fact, sir,"" replied Martin; ""not much more, I reckon, than you would a beast of burden.""",fact sir reply more reckon beast burden 
33,"""It is always the case among savage nations,"" observed Mr. Campbell; ""the first mark of civilization is the treatment of the other sex, and in proportion as civilization increases, so are the women protected and well used. But your supper is ready, my children, and I think after your fatigue and fasting you must require it.""",case savage nation observe first mark civilization treatment other sex proportion civilization increase woman protect use supper ready child think fatigue fasting require 
34,"""I am almost too tired to eat,"" observed Alfred, ""I shall infinitely more enjoy a good sleep under my bear skin. At the same time I'll try what I can do,"" continued he, laughing, and taking his seat at table.",tired eat observe enjoy good sleep bear skin same time try do continue laugh take seat table 
35,"Notwithstanding Alfred's observation, he contrived to make a very hearty supper, and Emma laughed at his appetite after his professing that he had so little inclination to eat.",observation contrive make hearty supper laugh appetite professing have little inclination eat 
36,"""I said I was too tired to eat, Emma, and so I felt at the time; but as I became more refreshed my appetite returned,"" replied Alfred, laughing, ""and notwithstanding your jeering me, I mean to eat some more.""",say tired eat feel time become refresh appetite return reply laugh notwithstand jeer mean eat more 
37,"""How long has John been away?"" said Mr. Campbell.",say 
38,"""Now nearly a fortnight,"" observed Mrs. Campbell; ""he promised to come here Christmas-day. I suppose we shall see him to-morrow morning.""",fortnight observe promise come day suppose see morning 
39,"""Yes, ma'am; and old Bone will come with him, I dare say. He said as much to me when he was going away the last time. He observed that the boy could not bring the venison, and perhaps _he_ would if he had any, for he knows that people like plenty of meat on Christmas day.""",old come say say much go last time observe boy bring venison have know person like plenty meat day 
40,"""I wonder whether old Malachi is any way religious,"" observed Mary. ""Do you think he is, Martin?""",wonder old way religious observe think 
41,"""Yes, ma'am; I think he feels it, but does not show it. I know from myself what are, probably, his feelings on the subject. When I have been away for weeks and sometimes for months, without seeing or speaking to any one, all alone in the woods, I feel more religious than I do when at Quebec on my return, although I do go to church. Now old Malachi has, I think, a solemn reverence for the Divine Being, and strict notions of duty, so far as he understands it,--but as he never goes to any town or mixes with any company, so the rites of religion, as I may call them, and the observances of the holy feast, are lost to him, except as a sort of dream of former days, before he took to his hunter's life. Indeed, he seldom knows what day or even what month it is. He knows the seasons as they come and go, and that's all. One day is the same as another, and he can not tell which is Sunday, for he is not able to keep a reckoning. Now, ma'am, when you desired Master John to be at home on the Friday fortnight because it was Christmas-day, I perceived old Malachi in deep thought: he was recalling to mind what Christmas-day was; if you had not mentioned it, the day would have passed away like any other; but you reminded him, and then it was that he said he would come if he could. I'm sure that now he knows it is Christmas-day, he intends to keep it as such.""",think feel show know feeling subject week month see speak one wood feel religious do return go church old think solemn reverence divine strict notion duty understand go town mix company rite religion call observance holy feast lose sort dream former day take hunter life know day month know season come go day same tell able keep reckoning desire home fortnight day perceive old deep thought recall mind day mention day pass other remind say come sure know day intend keep such 
42,"""There is much truth in what Martin says,"" observed Mr. Campbell; ""we require the seventh day in the week and other stated seasons of devotion to be regularly set apart, in order to keep us in mind of our duties and preserve the life of religion. In the woods, remote from communion with other Christians, these things are easily forgotten, and when once we have lost our calculation, it is not to be recovered. But come, Alfred and Henry and Martin must be very tired, and we had better all go to bed. I will sit up a little while to give some drink to my patient, if she wishes it. Good-night, my children.""",be much truth say observe require seventh day week other state season devotion set order keep mind duty preserve life religion wood remote communion other thing forget lose calculation recover come tired have good go bed sit little while give drink patient wish good night child
