1,CHAPTER 48. Farmer Thoroughgood and His Grandson Willie,
2," At this sale, of course I found myself in company with the old broken-down horses--some lame, some broken-winded, some old, and some that I am sure it would have been merciful to shoot.",sale course find company old break horse lame break wind old sure merciful shoot 
3,"The buyers and sellers, too, many of them, looked not much better off than the poor beasts they were bargaining about. There were poor old men, trying to get a horse or a pony for a few pounds, that might drag about some little wood or coal cart. There were poor men trying to sell a worn-out beast for two or three pounds, rather than have the greater loss of killing him. Some of them looked as if poverty and hard times had hardened them all over; but there were others that I would have willingly used the last of my strength in serving; poor and shabby, but kind and human, with voices that I could trust. There was one tottering old man who took a great fancy to me, and I to him, but I was not strong enough--it was an anxious time! Coming from the better part of the fair, I noticed a man who looked like a gentleman farmer, with a young boy by his side; he had a broad back and round shoulders, a kind, ruddy face, and he wore a broad-brimmed hat. When he came up to me and my companions he stood still and gave a pitiful look round upon us. I saw his eye rest on me; I had still a good mane and tail, which did something for my appearance. I pricked my ears and looked at him.",buyer seller many look good poor beast bargain be poor old man try get horse pony few pound drag little wood coal cart be poor man try sell wear out beast pound have great loss kill look poverty hard time harden be other use last strength serving poor shabby kind human voice trust be totter old man take great fancy strong anxious time come good part fair notice man look gentleman farmer young boy side have broad back round shoulder kind ruddy face wear broad brimm hat come companion stand give pitiful look see eye rest have good mane tail do appearance prick ear look

5,"“Poor old fellow!” said the boy, “do you think, grandpapa, he was ever a carriage horse?”",poor old fellow say boy think carriage horse 
6,"“Oh, yes! my boy,” said the farmer, coming closer, “he might have been anything when he was young; look at his nostrils and his ears, the shape of his neck and shoulder; there’s a deal of breeding about that horse.”  He put out his hand and gave me a kind pat on the neck. I put out my nose in answer to his kindness; the boy stroked my face.",boy say farmer come close young look nostril ear shape neck shoulder be deal breed horse put hand give kind pat neck put nose answer kindness boy stroke face 
7,"“Poor old fellow! see, grandpapa, how well he understands kindness. Could not you buy him and make him young again as you did with Ladybird?”",poor old fellow see grandpapa understand kindness buy make young do 
8,"“My dear boy, I can’t make all old horses young; besides, Ladybird was not so very old, as she was run down and badly used.”",dear boy make old horse young old run use 
9,"“Well, grandpapa, I don’t believe that this one is old; look at his mane and tail. I wish you would look into his mouth, and then you could tell; though he is so very thin, his eyes are not sunk like some old horses’.”",believe one old look mane tail wish look mouth tell thin eye sink old horse 
10,The old gentleman laughed. “Bless the boy! he is as horsey as his old grandfather.”,old gentleman laugh bless boy horsey old grandfather 
11,"“But do look at his mouth, grandpapa, and ask the price; I am sure he would grow young in our meadows.”",look mouth grandpapa ask price sure grow young meadow 
12,The man who had brought me for sale now put in his word.,man bring sale put word 
13,"“The young gentleman’s a real knowing one, sir. Now the fact is, this ‘ere hoss is just pulled down with overwork in the cabs; he’s not an old one, and I heerd as how the vetenary should say, that a six months’ run off would set him right up, being as how his wind was not broken. I’ve had the tending of him these ten days past, and a gratefuller, pleasanter animal I never met with, and ‘twould be worth a gentleman’s while to give a five-pound note for him, and let him have a chance. I’ll be bound he’d be worth twenty pounds next spring.”",young gentleman real know one sir fact ere hoss pull overwork cab old one heerd vetenary say month run set wind break have tend day gratefuller pleasanter animal meet worth gentleman give pound note let have chance bind worth pound next spring 
14,"The old gentleman laughed, and the little boy looked up eagerly.",old gentleman laugh little boy look 
15,"“Oh, grandpapa, did you not say the colt sold for five pounds more than you expected? You would not be poorer if you did buy this one.”",say colt sell pound more expect poorer buy one 
16,"The farmer slowly felt my legs, which were much swelled and strained; then he looked at my mouth. “Thirteen or fourteen, I should say; just trot him out, will you?”",farmer feel leg swell strain look mouth say trot 
17,"I arched my poor thin neck, raised my tail a little, and threw out my legs as well as I could, for they were very stiff.",arched poor thin neck raise tail little throw leg stiff 
18,“What is the lowest you will take for him?” said the farmer as I came back.,low take say farmer come 
19,"“Five pounds, sir; that was the lowest price my master set.”",pound sir low price master set 
20,"“‘Tis a speculation,” said the old gentleman, shaking his head, but at the same time slowly drawing out his purse, “quite a speculation! Have you any more business here?” he said, counting the sovereigns into his hand.",tis speculation say old gentleman shake head same time draw purse speculation have more business say count sovereign hand 
21,"“No, sir, I can take him for you to the inn, if you please.”",sir take inn 
22,"“Do so, I am now going there.”",do go 
23,"They walked forward, and I was led behind. The boy could hardly control his delight, and the old gentleman seemed to enjoy his pleasure. I had a good feed at the inn, and was then gently ridden home by a servant of my new master’s, and turned into a large meadow with a shed in one corner of it.",walk lead boy control delight old gentleman seem enjoy pleasure have good feed inn ride servant new master turn large meadow shed corner 
24,"Mr. Thoroughgood, for that was the name of my benefactor, gave orders that I should have hay and oats every night and morning, and the run of the meadow during the day, and, “you, Willie,” said he, “must take the oversight of him; I give him in charge to you.”",name benefactor give order have hay oat night morning run meadow day say take oversight give charge 
25,"The boy was proud of his charge, and undertook it in all seriousness. There was not a day when he did not pay me a visit; sometimes picking me out from among the other horses, and giving me a bit of carrot, or something good, or sometimes standing by me while I ate my oats. He always came with kind words and caresses, and of course I grew very fond of him. He called me Old Crony, as I used to come to him in the field and follow him about. Sometimes he brought his grandfather, who always looked closely at my legs.",boy proud charge undertake seriousness be day pay visit pick other horse give bit carrot good stand eat oat come kind word caresse course grow fond call old use come field follow bring grandfather look leg 
26,"“This is our point, Willie,” he would say; “but he is improving so steadily that I think we shall see a change for the better in the spring.”",point say improve think see change good spring 
27,"The perfect rest, the good food, the soft turf, and gentle exercise, soon began to tell on my condition and my spirits. I had a good constitution from my mother, and I was never strained when I was young, so that I had a better chance than many horses who have been worked before they came to their full strength. During the winter my legs improved so much that I began to feel quite young again. The spring came round, and one day in March Mr. Thoroughgood determined that he would try me in the phaeton. I was well pleased, and he and Willie drove me a few miles. My legs were not stiff now, and I did the work with perfect ease.",perfect rest good food soft turf gentle exercise begin tell condition spirit have good constitution mother strain young have good chance many horse work come full strength winter leg improve much begin feel young spring come day determine try phaeton pleased drive few mile leg stiff do work perfect ease 
28,"“He’s growing young, Willie; we must give him a little gentle work now, and by mid-summer he will be as good as Ladybird. He has a beautiful mouth and good paces; they can’t be better.”",grow young give little gentle work mid-summer good have beautiful mouth good pace good 
29,"“Oh, grandpapa, how glad I am you bought him!”",glad buy 
30,"“So am I, my boy; but he has to thank you more than me; we must now be looking out for a quiet, genteel place for him, where he will be valued.”",boy have thank more look quiet genteel place value
