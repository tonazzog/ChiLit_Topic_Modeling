1,CHAPTER 10. LORD TOTTENHAM,lord 
2,"Oswald is a boy of firm and unswerving character, and he had never wavered from his first idea. He felt quite certain that the books were right, and that the best way to restore fallen fortunes was to rescue an old gentleman in distress. Then he brings you up as his own son: but if you preferred to go on being your own father’s son I expect the old gentleman would make it up to you some other way. In the books the least thing does it--you put up the railway carriage window--or you pick up his purse when he drops it--or you say a hymn when he suddenly asks you to, and then your fortune is made.",boy firm unswerving character waver first idea feel certain book right good way restore fall fortune rescue old gentleman distress bring own son prefer go own father son expect old gentleman make other way book least thing put railway carriage window pick purse drop say hymn ask fortune make 
3,"The others, as I said, were very slack about it, and did not seem to care much about trying the rescue. They said there wasn’t any deadly peril, and we should have to make one before we could rescue the old gentleman from it, but Oswald didn’t see that that mattered. However, he thought he would try some of the easier ways first, by himself.",other say slack seem care much try rescue say be deadly peril have make rescue old gentleman see matter think try easy way 
4,"So he waited about the station, pulling up railway carriage windows for old gentlemen who looked likely--but nothing happened, and at last the porters said he was a nuisance. So that was no go. No one ever asked him to say a hymn, though he had learned a nice short one, beginning ‘New every morning’--and when an old gentleman did drop a two-shilling piece just by Ellis’s the hairdresser’s, and Oswald picked it up, and was just thinking what he should say when he returned it, the old gentleman caught him by the collar and called him a young thief. It would have been very unpleasant for Oswald if he hadn’t happened to be a very brave boy, and knew the policeman on that beat very well indeed. So the policeman backed him up, and the old gentleman said he was sorry, and offered Oswald sixpence. Oswald refused it with polite disdain, and nothing more happened at all.",wait station pull railway carriage window old gentleman look likely happen last porter say nuisance go ask say hymn learn nice short one begin new morning old gentleman drop shilling piece hairdresser pick think say return old gentleman catch collar call young thief unpleasant happen brave boy know policeman beat policeman back old gentleman say sorry offer sixpence refuse polite disdain happen 
5,"When Oswald had tried by himself and it had not come off, he said to the others, ‘We’re wasting our time, not trying to rescue the old gentleman in deadly peril. Come--buck up! Do let’s do something!’",try come say other waste time try rescue old gentleman deadly peril come buck let do 
6,"It was dinner-time, and Pincher was going round getting the bits off the plates. There were plenty because it was cold-mutton day. And Alice said--",dinner time go get bit plate be plenty cold mutton day say 
7,‘It’s only fair to try Oswald’s way--he has tried all the things the others thought of. Why couldn’t we rescue Lord Tottenham?’,fair try way try thing other think rescue 
8,"Lord Tottenham is the old gentleman who walks over the Heath every day in a paper collar at three o’clock--and when he gets halfway, if there is no one about, he changes his collar and throws the dirty one into the furze-bushes.",old gentleman walk day paper collar o'clock get be change collar throw dirty one furze bush 
9,"Dicky said, ‘Lord Tottenham’s all right--but where’s the deadly peril?’",say right deadly peril 
10,"And we couldn’t think of any. There are no highwaymen on Blackheath now, I am sorry to say. And though Oswald said half of us could be highwaymen and the other half rescue party, Dora kept on saying it would be wrong to be a highwayman--and so we had to give that up.",think be highwaymen sorry say say half highwaymen other half rescue party keep say wrong highwayman have give 
11,"Then Alice said, ‘What about Pincher?’",say 
12,And we all saw at once that it could be done.,see do 
13,"Pincher is very well bred, and he does know one or two things, though we never could teach him to beg. But if you tell him to hold on--he will do it, even if you only say ‘Seize him!’ in a whisper.",breed know thing teach beg tell hold do say seize whisper 
14,"So we arranged it all. Dora said she wouldn’t play; she said she thought it was wrong, and she knew it was silly--so we left her out, and she went and sat in the dining-room with a goody-book, so as to be able to say she didn’t have anything to do with it, if we got into a row over it.",arrange say play say think wrong know silly leave go sit dining room goody book able say have do get row 
15,"Alice and H. O. were to hide in the furze-bushes just by where Lord Tottenham changes his collar, and they were to whisper, ‘Seize him!’ to Pincher; and then when Pincher had seized Lord Tottenham we were to go and rescue him from his deadly peril. And he would say, ‘How can I reward you, my noble young preservers?’ and it would be all right.",hide furze bush change collar whisper seize seize go rescue deadly peril say reward noble young preserver right 
16,"So we went up to the Heath. We were afraid of being late. Oswald told the others what Procrastination was--so they got to the furze-bushes a little after two o’clock, and it was rather cold. Alice and H. O. and Pincher hid, but Pincher did not like it any more than they did, and as we three walked up and down we heard him whining. And Alice kept saying, ‘I _am_ so cold! Isn’t he coming yet?’ And H. O. wanted to come out and jump about to warm himself. But we told him he must learn to be a Spartan boy, and that he ought to be very thankful he hadn’t got a beastly fox eating his inside all the time. H. O. is our little brother, and we are not going to let it be our fault if he grows up a milksop. Besides, it was not really cold. It was his knees--he wears socks. So they stayed where they were. And at last, when even the other three who were walking about were beginning to feel rather chilly, we saw Lord Tottenham’s big black cloak coming along, flapping in the wind like a great bird. So we said to Alice--",go afraid late tell other get furze bush little o'clock cold hide like more walk hear whine keep say cold come want come jump warm tell learn spartan boy thankful get beastly fox eat time little brother go let fault grow milksop cold knee wear sock stay last other walk begin feel chilly see big black cloak come flap wind great bird say 
17,‘Hist! he approaches. You’ll know when to set Pincher on by hearing Lord Tottenham talking to himself--he always does while he is taking off his collar.’,hist approach know set hear talk take collar 
18,"Then we three walked slowly away whistling to show we were not thinking of anything. Our lips were rather cold, but we managed to do it.",walk whistle show think lip cold manage do 
19,"Lord Tottenham came striding along, talking to himself. People call him the mad Protectionist. I don’t know what it means--but I don’t think people ought to call a Lord such names.",come strid talk person call mad protectionist know mean think person call lord such name 
20,"As he passed us he said, ‘Ruin of the country, sir! Fatal error, fatal error!’ And then we looked back and saw he was getting quite near where Pincher was, and Alice and H. O. We walked on--so that he shouldn’t think we were looking--and in a minute we heard Pincher’s bark, and then nothing for a bit; and then we looked round, and sure enough good old Pincher had got Lord Tottenham by the trouser leg and was holding on like billy-ho, so we started to run.",pass say ruin country sir fatal error fatal error look see get walk think look minute hear bark bit look sure good old get trouser leg hold start run 
21,"Lord Tottenham had got his collar half off--it was sticking out sideways under his ear--and he was shouting, ‘Help, help, murder!’ exactly as if some one had explained to him beforehand what he was to do. Pincher was growling and snarling and holding on. When we got to him I stopped and said--",get collar half stick ear shouting help help murder one explain do growl snarl hold get stop say 
22,"‘Dicky, we must rescue this good old man.’",rescue good old man 
23,"Lord Tottenham roared in his fury, ‘Good old man be--’ something or othered. ‘Call the dog off.’",roar fury good old man othered call dog 
24,"So Oswald said, ‘It is a dangerous task--but who would hesitate to do an act of true bravery?’",say dangerous task hesitate do act true bravery 
25,"And all the while Pincher was worrying and snarling, and Lord Tottenham shouting to us to get the dog away. He was dancing about in the road with Pincher hanging on like grim death; and his collar flapping about, where it was undone.",worry snarl shouting get dog dance road hang grim death collar flap undone 
26,"Then Noel said, ‘Haste, ere yet it be too late.’ So I said to Lord Tottenham--",say haste late say 
27,"‘Stand still, aged sir, and I will endeavour to alleviate your distress.’",stand aged sir endeavour alleviate distress 
28,"He stood still, and I stooped down and caught hold of Pincher and whispered, ‘Drop it, sir; drop it!’",stand stoop catch hold whisper drop sir drop 
29,"So then Pincher dropped it, and Lord Tottenham fastened his collar again--he never does change it if there’s any one looking--and he said--",drop fasten collar change be one look say 
30,"‘I’m much obliged, I’m sure. Nasty vicious brute! Here’s something to drink my health.’",oblige sure nasty vicious brute drink health 
31,"But Dicky explained that we are teetotallers, and do not drink people’s healths. So Lord Tottenham said, ‘Well, I’m much obliged any way. And now I come to look at you--of course, you’re not young ruffians, but gentlemen’s sons, eh? Still, you won’t be above taking a tip from an old boy--I wasn’t when I was your age,’ and he pulled out half a sovereign.",explain teetotaller drink person health say oblige way come look course young ruffian gentleman son take tip old boy age pull sovereign 
32,"It was very silly; but now we’d done it I felt it would be beastly mean to take the old boy’s chink after putting him in such a funk. He didn’t say anything about bringing us up as his own sons--so I didn’t know what to do. I let Pincher go, and was just going to say he was very welcome, and we’d rather not have the money, which seemed the best way out of it, when that beastly dog spoiled the whole show. Directly I let him go he began to jump about at us and bark for joy, and try to lick our faces. He was so proud of what he’d done. Lord Tottenham opened his eyes and he just said, ‘The dog seems to know you.’",silly do feel mean take old boy chink put funk say bring own son know do let go go say welcome have money seem good way beastly dog spoiled whole show let go begin jump bark joy try lick face proud do open eye say dog seem know 
33,"And then Oswald saw it was all up, and he said, ‘Good morning,’ and tried to get away. But Lord Tottenham said--",see say good morning try get say 
34,"‘Not so fast!’ And he caught Noel by the collar. Noel gave a howl, and Alice ran out from the bushes. Noel is her favourite. I’m sure I don’t know why. Lord Tottenham looked at her, and he said--",fast catch collar give howl run bush favourite sure know look say 
35,‘So there are more of you!’ And then H. O. came out.,be more come 
36,‘Do you complete the party?’ Lord Tottenham asked him. And H. O. said there were only five of us this time.,complete party ask say be time 
37,"Lord Tottenham turned sharp off and began to walk away, holding Noel by the collar. We caught up with him, and asked him where he was going, and he said, ‘To the Police Station.’ So then I said quite politely, ‘Well, don’t take Noel; he’s not strong, and he easily gets upset. Besides, it wasn’t his doing. If you want to take any one take me--it was my very own idea.’",turn sharp begin walk hold collar catch ask go say say take strong upset do want take one take own idea 
38,"Dicky behaved very well. He said, ‘If you take Oswald I’ll go too, but don’t take Noel; he’s such a delicate little chap.’",behave say take go take delicate little chap 
39,"Lord Tottenham stopped, and he said, ‘You should have thought of that before.’ Noel was howling all the time, and his face was very white, and Alice said--",stop say think howl time face white say 
40,"‘Oh, do let Noel go, dear, good, kind Lord Tottenham; he’ll faint if you don’t, I know he will, he does sometimes. Oh, I wish we’d never done it! Dora said it was wrong.’",let go dear good kind faint know wish do say wrong 
41,"‘Dora displayed considerable common sense,’ said Lord Tottenham, and he let Noel go. And Alice put her arm round Noel and tried to cheer him up, but he was all trembly, and as white as paper.",display considerable common sense say let go put arm try cheer trembly white paper 
42,Then Lord Tottenham said--,say 
43,‘Will you give me your word of honour not to try to escape?’,give word honour try escape 
44,So we said we would.,say 
45,"‘Then follow me,’ he said, and led the way to a bench. We all followed, and Pincher too, with his tail between his legs--he knew something was wrong. Then Lord Tottenham sat down, and he made Oswald and Dicky and H. O. stand in front of him, but he let Alice and Noel sit down. And he said--",follow say lead way bench follow tail leg know wrong sit make stand front let sit say 
46,"‘You set your dog on me, and you tried to make me believe you were saving me from it. And you would have taken my half-sovereign. Such conduct is most--No--you shall tell me what it is, sir, and speak the truth.’",set dog try make believe save take half sovereign such conduct tell sir speak truth 
47,"So I had to say it was most ungentlemanly, but I said I hadn’t been going to take the half-sovereign.",have say say go take half sovereign 
48,"‘Then what did you do it for?’ he asked. ‘The truth, mind.’",do ask truth mind 
49,"So I said, ‘I see now it was very silly, and Dora said it was wrong, but it didn’t seem so till we did it. We wanted to restore the fallen fortunes of our house, and in the books if you rescue an old gentleman from deadly peril, he brings you up as his own son--or if you prefer to be your father’s son, he starts you in business, so that you end in wealthy affluence; and there wasn’t any deadly peril, so we made Pincher into one--and so--’ I was so ashamed I couldn’t go on, for it did seem an awfully mean thing. Lord Tottenham said--",say see silly say wrong seem do want restore fall fortune house book rescue old gentleman deadly peril bring own son prefer father son start business end wealthy affluence be deadly peril make ashamed go seem mean thing say 
50,"‘A very nice way to make your fortune--by deceit and trickery. I have a horror of dogs. If I’d been a weak man the shock might have killed me. What do you think of yourselves, eh?’",nice way make fortune deceit trickery have horror dog weak man shock kill think 
51,"We were all crying except Oswald, and the others say he was; and Lord Tottenham went on--‘Well, well, I see you’re sorry. Let this be a lesson to you; and we’ll say no more about it. I’m an old man now, but I was young once.’",cry other say go see sorry let lesson say more old man young 
52,"Then Alice slid along the bench close to him, and put her hand on his arm: her fingers were pink through the holes in her woolly gloves, and said, ‘I think you’re very good to forgive us, and we are really very, very sorry. But we wanted to be like the children in the books--only we never have the chances they have. Everything they do turns out all right. But we _are_ sorry, very, very. And I know Oswald wasn’t going to take the half-sovereign. Directly you said that about a tip from an old boy I began to feel bad inside, and I whispered to H. O. that I wished we hadn’t.’",slide bench put hand arm finger pink hole woolly glove say think good forgive sorry want child book have chance do turn right sorry know go take half sovereign say tip old boy begin feel bad whisper wish 
53,"Then Lord Tottenham stood up, and he looked like the Death of Nelson, for he is clean shaved and it is a good face, and he said--",stand look clean shave good face say 
54,"‘Always remember never to do a dishonourable thing, for money or for anything else in the world.’",remember do dishonourable thing money else world 
55,"And we promised we would remember. Then he took off his hat, and we took off ours, and he went away, and we went home. I never felt so cheap in all my life! Dora said, ‘I told you so,’ but we didn’t mind even that so much, though it was indeed hard to bear. It was what Lord Tottenham had said about ungentlemanly. We didn’t go on to the Heath for a week after that; but at last we all went, and we waited for him by the bench. When he came along Alice said, ‘Please, Lord Tottenham, we have not been on the Heath for a week, to be a punishment because you let us off. And we have brought you a present each if you will take them to show you are willing to make it up.’",promise remember take hat take go go feel cheap life say tell mind much hard bear say go week last go wait bench come say week punishment let bring present take show willing make 
56,"He sat down on the bench, and we gave him our presents. Oswald gave him a sixpenny compass--he bought it with my own money on purpose to give him. Oswald always buys useful presents. The needle would not move after I’d had it a day or two, but Lord Tottenham used to be an admiral, so he will be able to make that go all right. Alice had made him a shaving-case, with a rose worked on it. And H. O. gave him his knife--the same one he once cut all the buttons off his best suit with. Dicky gave him his prize, Naval Heroes, because it was the best thing he had, and Noel gave him a piece of poetry he had made himself--",sit bench give present give sixpenny compass buy own money purpose give buy useful present needle move have day use admiral able make go right make shaving case rose work give knife same one cut button good suit give prize naval good thing have give piece poetry make 
57,    When sin and shame bow down the brow     Then people feel just like we do now.     We are so sorry with grief and pain     We never will be so ungentlemanly again.,sin shame bow brow person feel sorry grief pain 
58,"Lord Tottenham seemed very pleased. He thanked us, and talked to us for a bit, and when he said good-bye he said--",seem pleased thank talk bit say good bye say 
59,"‘All’s fair weather now, mates,’ and shook hands.",fair weather mate shake hand 
60,"And whenever we meet him he nods to us, and if the girls are with us he takes off his hat, so he can’t really be going on thinking us ungentlemanly now.",meet nod girl take hat go think
