4," “I have it!” began Harry, as he came down to breakfast. “I don’t know how I came to forget it. The will was to be sent home to Mr. Mackintosh’s English partner. I’ll go and overhaul him this very morning. They won’t mind my coming by a later train, when there is such a reason.”",have begin come breakfast know come forget will send english partner go overhaul very morning mind come late train be reason 
5,“What is his name? Where shall you find him?” asked Flora.,name find ask 
6,"“I can’t be sure; but you’ve a navy list of that sort of cattle, have not you, Flora? I’ll hunt him up.”",sure navy list sort cattle hunt 
7,"Flora supposed he meant a directory; and all possible South American merchants having been overlooked, and the Mackintoshes selected, he next required a chart of London, and wanted to attempt self-navigation, but was forced to accept of George’s brougham and escort; Flora would not trust him otherwise; and Norman was obliged to go to Oxford at once, hurrying off to his train before breakfast was over.",suppose mean directory possible south american merchant overlook select require chart want attempt self navigation force accept escort trust oblige go hurry train breakfast 
8,"Flora might have trusted Harry alone. George contributed no more than the dignity of his presence; and, indeed, would have resigned the pursuit at the first blunder about the firm; and still more when the right one had been found, but the partner proved crusty, and would not believe that any such document was in his hands. George was consenting to let it rest till Mr. Mackintosh could be written to; but Harry, outrunning his management, and regardless of rebuffs, fairly teased the old gentleman into a search, as the only means of getting rid of the troublesome sailor.",trust contribute more dignity presence resign pursuit first blunder firm right one find partner prove crusty believe such document hand consent let rest write outrunn management rebuff tease old gentleman search only means get rid troublesome sailor 
9,"In the midst of George’s civil regrets at the fruitless trouble they were causing, forth came a bundle of papers, and forth from the bundle fell a packet, on which Harry pounced as he read, “Will of Alan Halliday Ernescliffe, Esquire, of Maplewood, Yorkshire, Lieutenant in H. M. S. Alcestis,” and, in the corner, the executors’ names, Captain John Gordon, of H. M. S. Alcestis; and Richard May, Esquire, M. D., Market Stoneborough.",midst civil regret fruitless trouble cause come bundle paper bundle fall packet pounce read corner executor name 
10,"As if in revenge, the prudent merchant would not be induced to entrust him with the document, saying he could not give it up till he had heard from the executors, and had been certified of the death of the testator. He withstood both the angry gentlemen, who finally departed in a state of great resentment--Harry declaring that the old land-lubber would not believe that he was his own father’s son; and Mr. Rivers, no less incensed, that the House of Commons had been insulted in his person, because he did not carry all before him.",revenge prudent merchant induce entrust document say give hear executor certify death testator withstood angry gentleman depart state great resentment declare old land lubber believe own father son incense insult person carry 
11,"Flora laughed at their story, and told them that she suspected that the old gentleman was in the right; and she laid plans for having Harry to teach them yachting at Ryde, while Harry declared he would have nothing to do with such trumpery.",laugh story tell suspect old gentleman right lay plan have teach yacht declare have do such trumpery 
12,"Harry found his home in a sort of agony of expectation, for his non-arrival at the time expected had made his first appearance seem like an unsubstantial illusion, though Dr. May, or Mary and Aubrey, had been at the station at the coming in of each train. Margaret had recovered the effects of the first shock, and the welcome was far more joyous than the first had been, with the mixed sensations that were now composed, and showed little, outwardly, but gladness.",find home sort agony expectation non-arrival time expect make first appearance seem unsubstantial illusion station come train recover effect first shock welcome joyous first mix sensation compose show little gladness 
13,"Dr. May took Flora’s view of the case, and declared that, if Harry had brought home the will, he should not have opened it without his co-executor. So he wrote to the captain, while Harry made the most of his time in learning his sisters over again. He spent a short time alone with Margaret every morning, patiently and gently allowing himself to be recalled to the sad recollections that were all the world to her. He kept Ethel and Mary merry with his droll desultory comments; he made Blanche keep up her dancing; and taught Gertrude to be a thorough little romp. As to Dr. May, his patients never were so well or so cheerful, till Dr. Spencer and Ethel suspected that the very sight of his looks brightened them--how could they help it? Dr. Spencer was as happy as a king in seeing his friend freed from the heavy weight on his spirits; and, truly, it was goodly to watch his perfect look of content, as he leaned on his lion-faced boy’s arm, and walked down to the minster, whither it seemed to have become possible to go on most evenings. Good Dr. May was no musician, but Mr. Wilmot could not regret certain tones that now and then burst out in the chanting, from the very bottom of a heart that assuredly sang with the full melody of thankfulness, whatever the voice might do.",take view case declare bring will open co-executor write captain make most time learn sister spend short time morning allow recall sad recollection world keep merry droll desultory comment make keep dancing teach thorough little romp patient cheerful suspect very sight look brighten help happy king see friend free heavy weight spirit watch perfect look content learn lion face boy arm walk minster seem become possible go most evening good musician regret certain tone burst chant very bottom heart sing full melody thankfulness voice do

15,"The girls wondered that, after writing with so much warmth and affection, both of and to Harry, he met him without any demonstration of feeling; and his short peremptory manner removed all surprise that poor Hector had been so forlorn with him at Maplewood, and turned, with all his heart, to Dr. May. They were especially impressed at the immediate subsidence of all Harry’s noise and nonsense, as if the drawing-room had been the quarter-deck of the Alcestis.",girl wonder write much warmth affection meet demonstration feeling short peremptory manner remove surprise poor forlorn turn heart impressed immediate subsidence noise nonsense draw room quarter deck 
16,"“And yet,” said Margaret, “Harry will not hear a single word in dispraise of him. I do believe he loves him with all his heart.”",say hear single word dispraise believe love heart

18,"“I believe you are right,” said Margaret; “but it is a serious thing for a man to have so little sympathy with those below him. You see how Hector feels it, and I now understand how it told upon Alan, and how papa’s warmth was like a surprise to him.”",believe right say serious thing man have little sympathy see feel understand tell papa warmth surprise 
19,"“Because Captain Gordon had to be a father to them, and that is more than a captain. I should not wonder if there were more similarity and fellow-feeling between him and Harry than there could be with either of them. Harry, though he has all papa’s tenderness, is of a rougher sort that likes to feel itself mastered. Poor Hector! I wonder if he is to be given back to us.”",have father more captain wonder be more similarity fellow feeling be have papa tenderness rougher sort like feel master poor wonder give

21,"“Yes, I believe so. I was not to have told you, but--”",believe tell 
22,"“There is no reason that it should do me any harm,” said Margaret, almost smiling, and looking as if she was putting a restraint on something she wished to say. “Go down, dear Ethel--Aubrey will be waiting for you.”",be reason do harm say smile look put restraint wish say go dear wait 
23,"Ethel went down to the difficult task of hearing Aubrey’s lessons, while Harry was pretending to write to Mrs. Arnott, but, in reality, teaching Gertrude the parts of a ship, occasionally acting mast, for her to climb.",go difficult task hear lesson pretend write reality teach part ship act mast climb

28,"“The best, the best!” said Dr. May. “Ethel, listen--twenty thousand, to build and endow a church for Cocksmoor!”",good good say listen build endow church 
29,"No need to bid Ethel listen. She gave a sort of leap in her chair, then looked almost ready to faint.",need bid listen give sort leap chair look ready faint 
30,"“My dear child,” said her father, “This is your wish. I give you joy, indeed I do!”",dear child say father wish give joy do 
31,"Ethel drew his arm round her, and leaned against him. “My wish! my wish!” she repeated, as if questioning the drift of the words.",draw arm learn wish wish repeat question drift word 
32,"“I’m glad it is found!” cried Harry. “Now I know why he talked of Cocksmoor, and seemed to rest in planning for it. You will mind the roof is as he said.”",glad find cry know talk seem rest plan mind roof say

36,“What does the captain say?” asked Harry.,captain say ask

I am fellow-trustee with Captain Gordon, and as to personal guardianship, I fancy the captain found he could not make the boy happy, and thinks you no bad specimen of our training.”",get fellow trustee personal guardianship fancy captain find make boy happy think bad specimen training

42,"With all Ethel’s reputation for bluntness, it was remarkable how her force of character made her always called for whenever there was the least dread of a scene.",reputation bluntness remarkable force character make call be least dread scene 
43,"She turned abruptly from Harry; and, going outside the window, tried to realise and comprehend the tidings, but all she could have time to discover was that Alan’s memory was dearer to her than ever, and she was obliged to hasten upstairs.",turn go window try realise comprehend tiding have time discover memory dearer oblige hast 
44,"Her father quitted the room by one door, as she entered by the other; she believed that it was to hide his emotion, but Margaret’s fair wan face was beaming with the sweetest of congratulating smiles.",father quit room door enter other believe hide emotion fair want face beam sweetest congratulate smile

47,"“You think!” exclaimed Margaret, as if disappointed.",think exclaim disappoint 
48,"“I beg your pardon,” said Ethel, with quivering lip. “Dear Margaret, I am glad--don’t you believe I am, but somehow, it is harder to deal with joy than grief. It confuses one! Dear Alan--and then to have been set on it so long--to have prayed so for it, and to have it come in this way--by your--”",beg pardon say quiver lip dear glad believe hard deal joy grief confuse dear set pray have come way

He used to make projects when he was here, but he would not let me tell you, lest he should find duties at Maplewood--whereas this would have been his pleasure.”",come great wish do use make project let tell find duty pleasure 
50,"“Dear Alan!” repeated Ethel. “If you are so kind, so dear as to be glad, Margaret, I think I shall be so presently.”",dear repeat kind dear glad think 
51,"Margaret almost grudged the lack of the girlish outbreak of rejoicing which would once have forgotten everything in the ecstasy of the fulfilled vision. It did not seem to be what Alan had intended; he had figured to himself unmixed joy, and she wanted to see it, and something of the wayward impatience of weakness throbbed at her heart, as Ethel paced the room, and disappeared in her own curtained recess.",grudge lack girlish outbreak rejoicing forget ecstasy fulfil vision seem intend figure unmix joy want see wayward impatience weakness throbb heart pace room disappear own curtain recess 
52,"Presently she came back saying, “You are sure you are glad?”",come say sure glad 
53,"“It would be strange if I were not,” said Margaret. “See, Ethel, here are blessings springing up from what I used to think had served for nothing but to bring him pain and grief. I am so thankful that he could express his desire, and so grateful to dear Harry for bringing it to light. How much better it is than I ever thought it could be! He has been spared disappointment, and surely the good that he will have done will follow him.”",strange say see blessing spring use think serve bring pain grief thankful express desire grateful dear bring light good think spare disappointment good do follow

56,Richard’s tap interrupted them. “Had he heard?”,tap interrupt hear 
57,"“I have.” The deepened colour in his cheek betrayed how much he felt, as he cast an anxious glance towards Margaret--an inquiring one on Ethel.",have deepen colour cheek betray much feel cast anxious glance inquire one 
58,"“She is so pleased,” was all Ethel could say.",pleased say 
59,"“I thought she would be,” said Richard, approaching. “Captain Gordon seemed quite vexed that no special token of remembrance was left to her.”",think say approach seem vexed special token remembrance leave 
60,"Margaret smiled in a peculiar way. “If he only knew how glad I am there was not.” And Ethel knew that the church was his token to Margaret, and that any “fading frail memorial” would have lessened the force of the signification.",smile peculiar way know glad know church token fade frail memorial lessen force signification 
61,"Ethel could speak better to her brother than to her sister. “Oh, Richard! Richard! Richard!” she cried, and a most unusual thing with both, she flung her arms round his neck. “It is come at last! If it had not been for you, this would never have been. How little likely it seemed, that dirty day, when I talked wildly, and you checked me!”",speak good brother sister cry unusual thing flung arm neck come last little likely seem dirty day talk check 
62,"“You had faith and perseverance,” said Richard, “or--”",have faith perseverance say 
63,"“You are right,” said Margaret, as Ethel was about to disclaim. “It was Ethel’s steadiness that brought it before Alan’s mind. If she had yielded when we almost wished it, in the time of the distress about Mrs. Green, I do believe that all would have died away!”",right say about disclaim steadiness bring mind yield wish time distress believe die 
64,"“I didn’t keep steady--I was only crazy. You and Ritchie and Mr. Wilmot--” said Ethel, half crying; then, as if unable to stay, she exclaimed with a sort of petulance, “And there’s Harry playing all sorts of rigs with Aubrey! I shan’t get any more sense out of him to-day!”",keep steady crazy say half cry unable stay exclaim sort petulance be play sort rig get more sense day 
65,"And away she rushed to the wayfaring dust of her life of labour, to find Aubrey and Daisy half-way up the tulip tree, and Harry mischievously unwilling to help them down again, assuring her that such news deserved a holiday, and that she was growing a worse tartar than Miss Winter. She had better let the poor children alone, put on her bonnet, and come with him to tell Mr. Wilmot.",rush wayfaring dust life labour find half tulip tree unwilling help assure such news deserve holiday grow bad tartar let poor child put bonnet come tell 
66,"Whereat Ethel was demurring, when Dr. May came forth, and declared he should take her himself.",demurr come declare take 
67,"Poor Mr. Wilmot laboured under a great burden of gratitude, which no one would receive from him. Dr. May and Ethel repudiated thanks almost with terror; and, when he tried them with the captain, he found very doubtful approval of the whole measure, so that Harry alone was a ready acceptant of a full meed of acknowledgments for his gallant extraction of the will.",poor laboure great burden gratitude receive repudiate thanks terror try captain find doubtful approval whole measure ready acceptant full meed acknowledgment gallant extraction will 
68,"No one was more obliged to him than Hector Ernescliffe, who wrote to Margaret that it would be very jolly to come home again, and that he was delighted that the captain could not hinder either that or Cocksmoor Church. “And as to Maplewood, I shall not hate it so much, if that happens which I hope will happen.” Of which oracular sentence, Margaret could make nothing.",oblige write jolly come delighted captain hinder hate happen hope happen oracular sentence make 
69,"The house of May felt more at their ease when the uncongenial captain had departed, although he carried off Harry with him. There was the better opportunity for a tea-drinking consultation with Dr. Spencer and Mr. Wilmot, when Margaret lay on her sofa, looking better than for months past, and taking the keenest interest in every arrangement.",house feel more ease uncongenial captain depart carry be good opportunity tea drinking consultation lay sofa look good month past take keenest interest arrangement 
70,"Dr. Spencer, whose bright eyes glittered at every mention of the subject, assumed that he was to be the architect, while Dr. May was assuring him that it was a maxim that no one unpaid could be trusted; and when he talked of beautiful German churches with pierced spires, declared that the building must not make too large a hole in the twenty thousand, at the expense of future curates, because Richard was the first.",bright eye glitter mention subject assume architect assure maxim unpaid trust talk beautiful german church pierce spire declare building make large hole expense future curate first 
71,"“I’ll be prudent, Dick,” said Dr. Spencer. “Trust me not to rival the minster.”",prudent say trust rival minster

79,"“Well, well, I know the people must have room,” said Dr. May, cutting short several further attacks which he saw impending.",know person have room say cut short several further attack see impend 
80,"“Yes, you would like to build another blue gallery, blocking up another window, and with Richard May and Christopher Tomkins, Churchwardens, on it, in orange-coloured letters--the Rivers’ colours. No disrespect to your father, Miss May, but, as a general observation, it is a property of Town Councillors to be conservative only where they ought not.”",like build blue gallery block window orange coloured letter colour disrespect father general observation property conservative 
81,"“I brought you here to talk of building a church, not of pulling one to pieces.”",bring talk build church pull piece 
82,"Poor Dr. May, he knew it was inevitable and quite right, but his affectionate heart and spirit of perpetuity, which had an association connected with every marble cloud, green baize pew, and square-headed panel, anticipated tortures in the general sweep, for which his ecclesiastical taste and sense of propriety would not soon compensate.",poor know inevitable right affectionate heart spirit perpetuity have association connect marble cloud green baize pew square head panel anticipate torture general sweep ecclesiastical taste sense propriety compensate 
83,"Margaret spared his feelings by bringing the Cocksmoor subject back again; Dr. Spencer seemed to comprehend the ardour with which she pressed it on, as if it were very near her heart that there should be no delay. He said he could almost promise her that the first stone should be laid before the end of the summer, and she thanked him in her own warm sweet way, hoping that it would be while Hector and Harry were at home.",spare feeling bring subject seem comprehend ardour press heart be delay say promise first stone lay end summer thank own warm sweet way hope home 
84,"Harry soon returned, having gone through the court-martial with the utmost credit, been patronised by Captain Gordon in an unheard-of manner, asked to dine with the admiral, and promised to be quickly afloat again. Ere many days had passed, he was appointed to one of the finest vessels in the fleet, commanded by a captain to whom Captain Gordon had introduced him, and who “seemed to have taken a fancy to him,” as he said. The Bucephalus, now the object of his pride, was refitting, and his sisters hoped to see a good deal of him before he should again sail. Besides, Flora would be at Ryde before the end of July.",return go court martial utmost credit patronise unheard manner ask dine admiral promise afloat many day pass appoint fine vessel fleet command captain introduce seem take fancy say object pride refitt sister hope see good deal sail end 
85,It was singular that Ethel’s vision should have been fulfilled simultaneously with Flora’s having obtained a position so far beyond what could have been anticipated.,singular vision fulfil obtain position anticipate 
86,"She was evidently extremely happy and valuable, much admired and respected, and with full exercise for the energy and cleverness, which were never more gratified than by finding scope for action. Her husband was devotedly attached to her, and was entirely managed by her, and though her good judgment kept her from appearing visibly in matters not pertaining to her own sphere, she was, in fact, his understanding. She read, listened, and thought for him, imbued him with her own views, and composed his letters for him; ruling his affairs, both political and private, and undeniably making him fill a position which, without her, he would have left vacant; nor was there any doubt that he was far happier for finding himself of consequence, and being no longer left a charge upon his own hands. He seemed fully to suffice to her as a companion, although she was so far superior in power; for it was, perhaps, her nature to love best that which depended upon her, and gave her a sense of exercising protection; as she had always loved Margaret better than Ethel.",happy valuable admire respect full exercise energy cleverness gratified find scope action husband attach manage good judgment keep appear matter pertain own sphere fact understanding read listen think imbue own view compose letter rule affair political private make fill position leave vacant be doubt happy find consequence leave charge own hand seem suffice companion superior power nature love good depend give sense exercising protection love good 
87,"“Mrs. Rivers was an admirable woman.” So every one felt, and her youthful beauty and success in the fashionable world made her qualities, as a wife and mistress of a household, the more appreciated. She never set aside her religious habits or principles, was an active member of various charitable associations, and found her experience of the Stoneborough Ladies’ Committee applicable among far greater names. Indeed, Lady Leonora thought dear Flora Rivers’s only fault, her over-strictness, which encouraged Meta in the same, but there were points that Flora could not have yielded on any account, without failing in her own eyes.",admirable woman one feel youthful beauty success fashionable world make quality wife mistress household appreciate set religious habit principle active member various charitable association find experience applicable great name think dear fault strictness encourage same be point yield account fail own eye 
88,"She made time for everything, and though, between business and fashion, she seemed to undertake more than mortal could accomplish, it was all effected, and excellently. She did, indeed, sigh over the briefness of the time that she could bestow on her child or on home correspondence, and declared that she should rejoice in rest; but, at the same time, her achievements were a positive pleasure to her.",make time business fashion seem undertake more mortal accomplish effect briefness time bestow child home correspondence declare rejoice rest same time achievement positive pleasure 
89,"Meta, in the meantime, had been living passively on the most affectionate terms with her brother and sister, and though often secretly yearning after the dear old father, whose darling she had been, and longing for power of usefulness, she took it on trust that her present lot had been ordered for her, and was thankful, like the bird of Dr. May’s fable, for the pleasures in her path--culling sweet morals, and precious thoughts out of book, painting or concert, occasions for Christian charities in each courtesy of society, and opportunities for cheerful self-denial and submission, whenever any little wish was thwarted.",meantime live affectionate term brother sister yearn dear old father darling long power usefulness take trust present lot order thankful bird fable pleasure path cull sweet moral precious thought book painting concert occasion christian charity courtesy society opportunity cheerful self denial submission little wish thwart 
90,"So Norman said she had turned into a fine lady! It was a sudden and surprising intimation, and made a change in the usually bright and calm current of her thoughts. She was not aware that there had been any alteration in herself, and it was a revelation that set her to examine where she had changed--poor little thing! She was not angry, she did not resent the charge, she took it for granted that, coming from such a source, it must be true and reasonable--and what did it mean? Did they think her too gay, or neglectful of old friends? What had they been saying to Harry about her?",say turn fine lady sudden surprising intimation make change bright calm current thought aware be alteration revelation set examine change poor little thing angry resent charge take grant come source true reasonable mean think gay neglectful old friend say 
91,"“Ah!” thought Meta, “I understand it. I am living a life of ease and uselessness, and with his higher aims and nobler purposes, he shrinks from the frivolities among which I am cast. I saw his saddened countenance among our gaieties, and I know that to deep minds there is heaviness in the midst of display. He withdraws from the follies that have no charms for him, and I--ought I to be able to help being amused? I don’t seek these things, but, perhaps, I ought to avoid them more than I do. If I could be quite clear what is right, I should not care what effort I made. But I was born to be one of those who have trial of riches, and such blessed tasks are not my portion.

92,"So meditated Meta, as she copied one of her own drawings of the Grange, for her dear old governess, Mrs. Larpent, while each line and tint recalled the comments of her fond amateur father, and the scenery carried her home, in spite of the street sounds, and the scratching of Flora’s pen, coursing over note-paper. Presently Sir Henry Walkinghame called, bringing a beautiful bouquet.",meditate copy own drawing dear old governess line tint recall comment fond amateur father scenery carry home spite street sound scratching pen course note paper call bring beautiful bouquet 
93,"“Delicious,” cried Meta. “See, Flora, it is in good time, for those vases were sadly shabby.”",delicious cry see good time vase shabby 
94,"She began at once to arrange the flowers, a task that seemed what she was born for, and the choice roses and geraniums acquired fresh grace as she placed them in the slender glasses and classic vases; but Flora’s discerning eyes perceived some mortification on the part of the gentleman, and, on his departure, playfully reproached Meta for ingratitude.",begin arrange flower task seem bear choice rose geranium acquire fresh grace place slender glasses classic vase discerning eye perceive mortification part gentleman departure reproach ingratitude

102,"Instances of his complaisance towards herself rose before her, so as to excite some warmth and gratitude. Her lonely heart thrilled at the idea of being again the best beloved, and her energetic spirit bounded at the thought of being no longer condemned to a life of idle ease. Still it was too new a light to her to be readily accepted, after she had looked on him so long, merely as a familiar of the house, attentive to her, because she fell to his share, when Flora was occupied. She liked him, decidedly; she could possibly do more; but she was far more inclined to dread, than to desire, any disturbance of their present terms of intercourse.",instance complaisance rise excite warmth gratitude lonely heart thrill idea good beloved energetic spirit bound thought condemn life idle ease new light accept look familiar house attentive fall share occupy like do more inclined dread desire disturbance present term intercourse 
103,"“However,” thought she, “I must see my way. If he should have any such thing in his head, to go on as we do now would be committing myself, and I will not do that, unless I am sure it is right. Oh, papa, you would settle it for me! But I will have it out with Flora. She will find out what I cannot--how far he is a man for whom one ought to care. I do not think Norman liked him, but then Norman has so keen a sense of the world-touched. I suppose I am that! If any other life did but seem appointed for me, but one cannot tell what is thwarting providential leading, and if this be as good a man as--What would Ethel say? If I could but talk to Dr. May!

106,"It should be premised that Mrs. Rivers had no notion of the degree of attachment felt by her brother for Meta; she only knew that Lady Leonora had a general distrust of her family, and she felt it a point of honour to promote no dangerous meetings, and to encourage Sir Henry--a connection who would be most valuable, both as conferring importance upon George in the county, and as being himself related to persons of high influence, whose interest might push on her brothers. Preferment for Richard; promotion for Harry; nay, diplomatic appointments for Tom, came floating before her imagination, even while she smiled at her Alnaschar visions.",premise have notion degree attachment feel brother know have general distrust family feel point honour promote dangerous meeting encourage connection valuable conferr importance county related person high influence interest push brother preferment promotion diplomatic appointment come float imagination smile vision 
107,"But the tone of Meta, as she drew her almost forcibly into her room, showed her that she had given a great shock to her basket.",tone draw room show give great shock basket

112,"“It was very silly of me,” said Meta; “but you gave me a terrible fright.”",silly say give terrible fright 
113,"“Was it so very terrible, poor little bird?” said Flora, in commiseration. “Well then, you may safely think of him as a man tame about the house. It was much prettier of you not to appropriate the flowers, as any other damsel would have done.”",terrible poor little bird say commiseration think man tame house pretty appropriate flower other damsel do 
114,"“Do you really and truly think--” began Meta; but, from the colour of her cheek and the timid resolution of her tone, Flora thought it safest not to hear the interrogation, and answered, “I know what he comes here for--it is only as a refuge from his mother’s friend, old Lady Drummond, who would give the world to catch him for her daughters--that’s all. Put my nonsense out of your head, and be yourself, my sweet one.”",think begin colour cheek timid resolution tone think safe hear interrogation answer know come refuge mother friend old give world catch daughter put nonsense head sweet one

120,"“And we will send the baby down the last day before we go to Ryde, with Preston and Butts to take care of her. We can’t spare him to take them down, till we shut up the house. It is so much easier for us to go to Portsmouth from hence.”",send baby last day go take care spare take shut house easy go 
121,"The lurking conviction was that one confidential talk with Ethel would cause the humming-bird to break the toils that were being wound invisibly round her. Ethel and her father knew nothing of the world, and were so unreasonable in their requirements! Meta would consult them all, and all her scruples would awaken, and perhaps Dr. Spencer might be interrogated on Sir Henry’s life abroad, where Flora had a suspicion that gossip had best not be raked up.",lurk conviction confidential talk cause hum bird break toil wind father know world unreasonable requirement consult scruple awake interrogate life have suspicion gossip rake 
122,"Not that she concealed anything positively known to her, or that she was not acting just as she would have done by her own child.

124,"So she wrote that she could not come home; Margaret was much disappointed, and so was Meta, who had looked to Ethel to unravel the tangles of her life.",write come disappoint look unravel tangle life 
125,"“No, no, little miss,” said Flora to herself; “you don’t talk to Ethel till your fate is irrevocable. Why, if I had listened to her, I should be thankful to be singing at Mrs. Hoxton’s parties at this minute! and, as for herself, look at Norman Ogilvie! No, no, after six weeks’ yachting--moonlight, sea, and sympathy--I defy her to rob Sir Henry of his prize! And, with Meta lady of Cocksmoor, even Ethel herself must be charmed!”",little miss say talk fate irrevocable listen thankful sing party minute look week yachting moonlight sea sympathy defy rob prize lady charm
