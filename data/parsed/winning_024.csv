2," The following day, with many thanks Cuthbert started from the castle, and in the first place visited the convent, and told Lady Margaret that she would be fetched in a few days by Sir Baldwin and his wife. He took a tender adieu of her, not without many forebodings and tears upon her part; but promising blithely that he would return and lead her back in triumph to her castle, he bade adieu and rode for London.",follow day many thanks start castle first place visit convent tell fetched few day wife take tender adieu many foreboding tear part promise return lead triumph castle bid adieu ride 
3,"He had attired himself as a merchant, and took up his abode at a hostelry near Cheapside. Here he remained quietly for some days, and, mixing among the people, learnt that in London as elsewhere the rapacity of Prince John had rendered him hateful to the people, and that they would gladly embrace any opportunity of freeing themselves from his yoke. He was preparing to leave for France, when the news came to him that Prince John had summoned all the barons faithful to him to meet him near London, and had recalled all his mercenaries from different parts of the country, and was gathering a large army; also, that the barons faithful to King Richard, alarmed by the prospect, had raised the royal standard, and that true men were hurrying to their support. This entirely destroyed the plans that he had formed. Taking horse again, and avoiding the main road, by which he might meet the hostile barons on their way to London, he journeyed down to Nottingham. Thence riding boldly into the forest, he sought the outlaws, and was not long ere he found them. At his request he was at once taken before their leader, a man of great renown both for courage and bowmanship, one Robin Hood. This bold outlaw had long held at defiance the Sheriff of Nottingham, and had routed him and all bodies of troops who had been sent against him. With him Cuthbert found many of his own men; and upon hearing that the royal standard had been raised, Robin Hood at once agreed to march with all his men to join the royal force. Messengers were despatched to summon the rest of the forest band from their hiding places, and a week later Cuthbert, accompanied by Robin Hood and 300 archers, set out for the rendezvous. When they arrived there they found that Sir Baldwin had already joined with his retainers, and was by him most warmly received, and introduced to the other barons in the camp, by whom Cuthbert was welcomed as a brother. The news that Prince John's army was approaching was brought in, a fortnight after Cuthbert had joined the camp, and the army in good order moved out to meet the enemy.",attire merchant take abode hostelry remain day mix person learn rapacity render hateful person embrace opportunity free yoke prepare leave news come summon baron faithful meet recall mercenary different part country gather large army baron faithful alarm prospect raise royal standard true man hurry support destroy plan form take horse avoid main road meet hostile baron way journey thence ride forest seek outlaw long find request take leader man great renown courage bowmanship bold outlaw hold defiance rout body troops send find many own man hear royal standard raise agree march man join royal force messenger despatch summon rest forest band hiding place week accompany archer set rendezvous arrive find join retainer receive introduce other baron camp welcome brother news army approach bring fortnight join camp army good order move meet enemy 
4,"The forces were about equal. The battle began by a discharge of arrows; but Robin Hood and his men shot so true and fast that they greatly discomfited the enemy; and King John's mercenaries having but little stomach for the fight, and knowing how unpopular they were in England, and that if defeated small mercy was likely to be shown to them, refused to advance against the ranks of the loyal barons, and falling back declined to join in the fray. Seeing their numbers so weakened by this defection, the barons on the prince's side hesitated, and surrounding the prince advised him to make terms with the barons while there was yet time. Prince John saw that the present was not a favourable time for him, and concealing his fury under a mask of courtesy, he at once acceded to the advice of his followers, and despatched a messenger to the barons with an inquiry as to what they wanted of him. A council was held, and it was determined to demand the dismissal of the mercenaries and their despatch back to their own country; also that John would govern only as his brother's representative; that the laws of the country should be respected; that no taxes should be raised without the assent of the barons; that all men who had taken up arms against his authority should be held free; and that the barons on Prince John's side should return peaceably home and disband their forces. Seeing, under the circumstances, that there was no way before him but to yield to these demands, Prince John accepted the terms. The mercenaries were ordered to march direct to London, and orders were given that ships should be at once prepared to take them across to Normandy, and the barons marched for their homes.",force equal battle begin discharge arrow man shoot true fast discomfite enemy mercenary have little stomach fight know unpopular defeat small mercy likely show refuse advance rank loyal baron fall decline join fray see number weaken defection baron prince side hesitate surround prince advise make term baron be time see present favourable time conceal fury mask courtesy acced advice follower despatch messenger baron inquiry want council hold determine demand dismissal mercenary despatch own country govern brother representative law country respect tax raise assent baron man take arm authority hold free baron side return peaceably home disband force see circumstance be way yield demand accept term mercenary order march direct order give ship prepare take baron march home 
5,"Satisfied, now that the mercenaries were gone, that they could henceforth hold their ground against Prince John, the royal barons also broke up their forces. Robin Hood with his foresters returned to Sherwood; and Cuthbert, bidding adieu to Sir Baldwin, rode back to London, determined to carry out the plan which he had formed. He was the more strengthened in this resolution, inasmuch as in the royal camp he had met a friend from whom he parted last in the Holy Land. This was Blondel, the minstrel of King Richard, whose songs and joyous music had often lightened the evening after days of fighting and toil in Palestine. To him Cuthbert confided his intention, and the minstrel instantly offered to accompany him.",satisfied mercenary gone hold ground royal baron break force forester return bid adieu ride determined carry plan form strengthen resolution royal camp meet friend part last holy minstrel song joyous music lighten evening day fighting toil confide intention minstrel offer accompany 
6,"""I shall,"" he said, ""be of assistance to you. Minstrels are like heralds. They are of no nationality, and can pass free where a man at arms would be closely watched and hindered. Moreover, it may be that I might aid you greatly in discovering the prison of the king. So great is the secrecy with which this has been surrounded, that I question if any inquiries you could make would enable you to trace him. My voice, however, can penetrate into places where we cannot enter. I will take with me my lute, and as we journey I will sing outside the walls of each prison we come to one of the songs which I sang in Palestine. King Richard is himself a singer and knows my songs as well as myself. If I sing a verse of some song which I wrote there and which, therefore, would be known only to him, if he hears it he may follow with the next verse, and so enable us to know of his hiding place.""",say assistance minstrel herald nationality pass free man arm watch hinder aid discover prison king great secrecy surround question inquiry make enable trace voice penetrate place enter take lute journey sing wall prison come song sing singer know song sing verse song write know hear follow next verse enable know hiding place 
7,"Cuthbert at once saw the advantages which such companionship would bring him, and joyfully accepted the minstrel's offer, agreeing himself to go as serving man to Blondel. The latter accompanied him to London. Here their preparations were soon made, and taking ship in a merchantman bound for the Netherlands, they started without delay upon their adventure.",see advantage such companionship bring accept minstrel offer agree go serve man latter accompany preparation make take ship merchantman bind start delay adventure 
8,"The minstrels and troubadours were at that time a privileged race in Europe, belonging generally to the south of France, although produced in all lands. They travelled over Europe singing the lays which they themselves had composed, and were treated with all honour at the castles where they chose to alight. It would have been considered as foul a deed to use discourtesy to a minstrel as to insult a herald. Their persons were, indeed, regarded as sacred, and the knights and barons strove to gain their good will by hospitality and presents, as a large proportion of their ballads related to deeds of war; and while they would write lays in honour of those who courteously entertained them, they did not hesitate to heap obloquy upon those who received them discourteously, holding them up to the gibes and scoffs of their fellows. In no way, therefore, would success be so likely to attend the mission of those who set out to discover the hiding place of King Richard as under the guise of a minstrel and his attendant. No questions would be asked them; they could halt where they would, in castle or town, secure of hospitality and welcome. Blondel was himself a native of the south of France, singing his songs in the soft language of Languedoc. Cuthbert's Norman French would pass muster anywhere as being that of a native of France; and although when dressed as a servitor attention might be attracted by his bearing, his youth might render it probable that he was of noble family, but that he had entered the service of the minstrel in order to qualify himself some day for following that career. He carried a long staff, a short sword, and at his back the lute or small harp played upon by the troubadour. Blondel's attire was rich, and suitable to a person of high rank.",minstrel troubadour time privileged race belong south produce land travel sing lay compose treat honour castle choose aligh consider deed use discourtesy minstrel insult herald person regard sacred knight baron strive gain good will hospitality present large proportion ballad related deed war write lay honour entertain hesitate heap obloquy receive hold gibe scoff fellow way success likely attend mission set discover hiding place guise minstrel attendant question ask halt castle town secure hospitality welcome native south sing song soft language pass muster native dress servitor attention attract bear youth render probable noble family enter service minstrel order qualify day follow career carry long staff short sword back lute small harp play troubadour attire rich suitable person high rank 
9,"They crossed to the Scheldt, and thence travelled by the right bank of the Rhine as far as Mannheim, sometimes journeying by boat, sometimes on foot. They were also hospitably entertained, and were considered to more than repay their hosts by the songs which Blondel sang. At Mannheim they purchased two horses, and then struck east for Vienna. The journey was not without danger, for a large portion of this part of Europe was under no settled government, each petty baron living in his own castle, and holding but slight allegiance to any feudal lord, making war upon his neighbour on his own account, levying blackmail from travellers, and perpetually at variance with the burghers of the towns. The hills were covered with immense forests, which stretched for many leagues in all directions, and these were infested by wolves, bears, and robbers. The latter, however, although men without pity or religion, yet held the troubadours in high esteem, and the travellers without fear entered the gloomy shades of the forest.",cross thence travel right bank journey boat foot entertain consider more repay host song sing purchase horse strike journey danger large portion part settle government petty baron live own castle hold slight allegiance feudal lord make war neighbour own account levy blackmail traveller variance burgher town hill cover immense forest stretch many league direction infest wolf bear robber latter man pity religion hold troubadour high esteem traveller fear enter gloomy shade forest

13,"Blondel, without objection, turned his horse's head and accompanied the men, followed by Cuthbert. After half an hour's travelling, they came to a building which had formerly been a shrine, but which was now converted to the robbers' headquarters. The robber chief on hearing from his followers the news that a minstrel had arrived, came forward to meet him, and courteously bade him welcome.",objection turn horse head accompany man follow hour travelling come building shrine convert robber headquarters robber chief hear follower news minstrel arrive come meet bid welcome 
14,"""I am Sir Adelbert, of Rotherheim,"" he said, ""although you see me in so poor a plight. My castle and lands have been taken by my neighbour, with whom for generations my family have been at feud. I was in the Holy Land with the emperor, and on my return found that the baron had taken the opportunity of my absence, storming my castle and seizing my lands. In vain I petitioned the emperor to dispossess this traitorous baron of my lands, which by all the laws of Christendom should have been respected during my absence. The emperor did indeed send a letter to the baron to deliver them up to me; but his power here is but nominal, and the baron contemptuously threw the royal proclamation into the fire, and told the messenger that what he had taken by the sword he would hold the sword; and the emperor, having weightier matters on hand than to set troops in motion to redress the grievances of a simple knight, gave the matter no further thought. I have therefore been driven to the forest, where I live as best I may with my followers, most of whom were retainers upon my estate, and some my comrades in the Holy Land. I make war upon the rich and powerful, and beyond that do harm to no man.

And indeed, sir knight, since you are well disposed towards him, I may tell you that the purport of my journey is to discover if I can the place of his confinement.

26,"The minstrel and Cuthbert were soon seated at the table with the knight and one or two of his principal companions. A huge venison pasty formed the staple of the repast, but hares and other small game were also upon the table. Nor was the generous wine of the country wanting.",minstrel seat table knight principal companion huge venison pasty form staple repast hare other small game table generous wine country want

He is, as I guess, your companion in this quest; is it not so?""",knight have several time glance last exclaim have attendant sir minstrel valiant young knight ride battle guess companion quest 
28,"""It is,"" Cuthbert replied frankly. ""I am like yourself, a disinherited knight, and my history resembles yours. Upon my return to England I found another in possession of the land and titles that belonged to the noble I followed, and which King Richard bestowed upon me. The Earl of Evesham was doubtless known to you, and before his death King Richard, at his request, bestowed upon me as his adopted son--although but a distant connexion--his title and lands and the hand of his daughter. Prince John, who now rules in England, had however granted these things to one of his favourites, and he having taken possession of the land and title, though not, happily, of the lady, closed his door somewhat roughly in my face. I found means, however, to make my mark upon him; but as our quarrel could not be fought out to the end, and as the false knight had the aid of Prince John, I am forced for a while to postpone our settlement, and meeting my good friend the minstrel, agreed to join him in his enterprise to discover our lord the king.""",reply disinherite knight history resemble return find possession land title belong noble follow bestow know death request bestow adopt son--although distant connexion title land hand daughter rule grant thing favourite take possession land title lady close door face find means make mark quarrel fight end false knight have aid force while postpone settlement meet good friend minstrel agree join enterprise discover lord king

Many of my retainers still live upon the estate, and would; I am sure, gladly join me, if I were to raise my flag.

50,"Blondel warmly assented to Cuthbert's scheme, and it was settled that at daybreak they should start to view the Castle of Rotherheim. At early dawn they were in the saddle, and the three rode all day, until towards sunset they stood on the crest of a hill looking down into the valley of the Rhine.",assent scheme settle daybreak start view early dawn saddle ride day sunset stand crest hill look valley 
51,"The present aspect of that valley affords but a slight idea of its beauty in those days. The slopes are now clad with vineyards, which, although picturesque in idea, are really, to look at from a distance, no better than so many turnip fields. The vines are planted in rows and trained to short sticks, and as these rows follow the declivities of the hillside, they are run in all directions, and the whole mountain side, from the river far up, is cut up into little patches of green lines. In those days the mountains were clad with forests, which descended nearly to the river side. Here and there, upon craggy points, were situate the fortalices of the barons. Little villages nestled in the woods, or stood by the river bank, and a fairer scene could not be witnessed in Europe.",present aspect valley afford slight idea beauty day slope clad vineyard picturesque idea look distance good many turnip field vine plant row train short stick row follow declivity hillside run direction whole mountain side river cut little patch green line day mountain clad forest descend river side craggy point situate fortalice baron little village nestle wood stand river bank fair scene witness

53,"Cuthbert examined closely the fortress of Rotherheim. It was a large building, with towers at the angles, and seemed to rise almost abruptly from the edge of the rock. Inside rose the gables and round turrets of the dwelling-place of the baron; and the only access was by a steep winding path on the river side.",examine fortress large building tower angle seem rise edge rock rise gable round turret dwelling place baron only access steep wind path river side 
54,"""It is indeed a strong place,"" Cuthbert said, ""and difficult to take by surprise. A watch no doubt is always kept over the entrance, and there we can hope for no success. The only plan will be to scale the wall by means of a ladder; but how the ladder is to be got to so great a height, I own at present passes my comprehension."" After much thought, Cuthbert went on, ""It might, methinks, be practicable for an archer to approach the walls, and to shoot an arrow over the angle of the castle so that it would pass inside the turret there, and fall in the forest beyond. If to this arrow were attached a light cord, it could be gained by one on the other side, and a stronger cord hauled over. To this could be attached a rope ladder, and so this could be raised to the top of the wall. If a sentinel were anywhere near he might hear the rope pulled across the battlements; but if as we may hope, a watch is kept only over the entrance, the operation might be performed without attracting notice.""",strong place say difficult take surprise watch doubt keep entrance hope success only plan scale wall means ladder ladder get great height own present pass comprehension much thought go methink practicable archer approach wall shoot arrow angle castle pass turret fall forest arrow attach light cord gain other side strong cord haul attach rope ladder raise top wall sentinel hear rope pull battlement hope watch keep entrance operation perform attract notice

57,"""Methinks,"" Cuthbert said, ""that I can do that, for as a lad I was used to the strong bows of my country.

58,"The party bivouacked in the woods for the night, for the horses had already done a very long journey, and needed rest before starting back for the Black Forest. At daybreak, however, they started, and at nightfall rejoined their band. These were delighted when they heard the scheme that had been set on foot, and all avowed their eagerness to join in the attempt to restore their lord to his rights.",party bivouack wood night horse do long journey need rest start black daybreak start nightfall rejoin band delight hear scheme set foot avow eagerness join attempt restore lord right 
59,"Two days later they set out, having already procured from the nearest town a strong bow, some arrows, a very light rope, and a stronger one from a portion of which they manufactured a rope ladder capable of reaching from the top of the wall to the rock below. The journey this time occupied two days, as the men on foot were unable to march at the pace at which the mounted party had traversed the ground. The evening of the second day, however, saw them in sight of the castle. By Cuthbert's advice, Sir Adelbert determined to give them twenty-four hours of rest, in order that they might have their full strength for undertaking the task before them. During the day, Cuthbert, guided by the knight, made his way through the woods to the foot of the rocks on which the castle stood. They were extremely steep, but could be mounted by active men if unopposed from above. Cuthbert measured the height with his eye from the top of the castle wall to the place which he selected as most fitting from which to shoot the arrow, and announced to the knight that he thought there would be no difficulty in discharging an arrow over the angle.",day set procure near town strong bow arrow light rope strong one portion manufacture rope ladder capable reach top wall rock journey time occupy day man foot unable march pace mount party travers ground evening second day see sight castle advice determine give hour rest order have full strength undertake task day guide knight make way wood foot rock castle stand steep mount active man unoppose measure height eye top castle wall place select fitting shoot arrow announce knight think be difficulty discharg arrow angle 
60,"At nightfall the whole party made their way silently through the woods. Three men were sent round to the side of the castle opposite that from which Cuthbert was to shoot. The length of light string was carefully coiled on the ground, so as to unwind with the greatest facility, and so offer as little resistance to the flight of the arrow as might be. Then, all being in readiness, Cuthbert attached the end to an arrow, and drawing the bow to its full compass, let fly the arrow. All held their breath; but no sound followed the discharge. They were sure, therefore, that the arrow had not struck the wall, but that it must have passed clear over it. Half-an-hour elapsed before they felt that the cord was pulled, and knew that the men upon the other side had succeeded in finding the arrow and string attached. The stronger cord was now fastened to that which the arrow had carried, and this gradually disappeared in the darkness. A party now stole up the rock, and posted themselves at the foot of the castle wall. They took with them the coil of rope-ladder and the end of the rope. At length the rope tightened, and to the end they attached the ladder. This again ascended until the end only remained upon the ground, and they knew that it must have reached the top of the wall. They now held fast, and knew that those on the other side, following the instructions given them, would have fastened the rope to a tree upon the opposite side. They were now joined by the rest of the party, and Sir Adelbert leading the way, and followed by Cuthbert and Blondel, began cautiously to ascend the rope ladder.",nightfall whole party make way wood man send side castle shoot length light string coiled ground unwind great facility offer little resistance flight arrow readiness attach end arrow draw bow full compass let fly arrow hold breath sound follow discharge sure arrow strike wall pass clear half hour elapse feel cord pull know man other side succeed find arrow string attach strong cord fasten arrow carry disappear darkness party steal rock post foot castle wall take coil rope ladder end rope length rope tighten end attach ladder ascend end remain ground know reach top wall hold know other side follow instruction give fasten rope tree opposite side join rest party lead way follow begin ascend rope ladder 
61,"All this time no sound from the castle proclaimed that their intention was suspected, or that any alarm had been given, and in silence they gained the top of the wall. Here they remained quiet until the whole band were gathered there, and then made their way along until they reached the stairs leading to the courtyard. These they descended, and then, raising his war cry, Sir Adelbert sprang upon the men who, round a fire, were sitting by the gate. These were cut down before they could leap to their feet, and the party then rushed at the entrance to the dwelling-house. The retainers of the castle, aroused by the sudden din, rushed from their sleeping places, but taken completely by surprise, were unable to offer any resistance whatever to the strong force which had, as if by magic, taken possession of the castle. The surprise was complete, and with scarce a blow struck they found themselves in possession. The baron himself was seized as he rose from his bed, and his rage at finding himself in the power of his enemy was so great as for some time to render him speechless. Sir Adelbert briefly dictated to him the conditions upon which only he should desist from using his power to hang him over his own gate. The baron was instantly to issue orders to all his own retainers and tenantry to lend their aid to those of Sir Adelbert in putting the castle of the latter into a state of defence and mending the breach which existed. A sum of money, equal to the revenues of which he had possessed himself, was to be paid at once, and the knight was to retain possession of Rotherheim and of the baron's person until these conditions were all faithfully carried out. The baron had no resource but to assent to these terms, and upon the following day Cuthbert and Blondel departed upon their way, overwhelmed with thanks by Sir Adelbert, and confident that he would now be able to regain and hold the possession of his estate.",time sound castle proclaim intention suspect alarm give silence gain top wall remain quiet whole band gather make way reach stair lead courtyard descend raise war cry spring man fire sit gate cut leap foot party rush entrance dwelling house retainer castle arouse sudden din rush sleeping place take surprise unable offer resistance strong force magic take possession castle surprise complete scarce blow strike find possession baron seize rise bed rage find power enemy great time render speechless dictate condition desist use power hang own gate baron issue order own retainer tenantry lend aid put castle latter state defence mend breach exist sum money equal revenue possess pay knight retain possession baron person condition carry baron have resource assent term follow day depart way overwhelm thanks confident able regain hold possession estate
