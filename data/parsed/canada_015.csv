2," It was on the Saturday evening, when they had all assembled round the fire, for it was more cold than it had hitherto been, that the moaning of the wind among the trees of the forest announced a gale of wind from the northward.",evening assemble fire cold moan wind tree forest announce gale wind northward 
3,"""We shall have it soon,"" observed Martin, ""winter mostly comes in with a gale.""",have observe winter come gale 
4,"""Yes; and this appears as if it would be a strong gale,"" replied Alfred. ""Hark! how the boughs of the trees are sawing and cracking against each other.""",appear strong gale reply hark bough tree saw crack other 
5,"""I reckon we may get our snow-shoes out of the store-house, John,"" said Martin, ""and then we shall see how you can get over the ground with them when you go hunting. You have not shot a moose yet.""",reckon get snow shoe store house say see get ground go hunt shoot moose 
6,"""Is the moose the same as the elk, Martin?"" said Henry.",moose same elk say

8,"""Have you ever shot any?"" said Mrs. Campbell.",shoot say 
9,"""Yes, ma'am; many a one. They're queer animals; they don't run like the other deer, but they trot as fast as the others run, so it comes to the same thing. They are very shy, and difficult to get near, except in the heavy snow, and then their weight will not allow them to get over it, as the lighter deer can; they sink up to their shoulders, and flounder about till they are overtaken. You see, Master Percival, the moose can't put on snow-shoes like we can, and gives us the advantage over the animal.""",many one queer animal run other deer trot other run come same thing shy difficult get heavy snow weight allow get light deer sink shoulder flounder overtake see moose put snow shoe give advantage animal 
10,"""Are they dangerous animals, Martin?"" inquired Mary Percival.",dangerous animal inquire 
11,"""Every large animal is more or less dangerous when it turns to bay, miss. A moose's horns sometimes weigh fifty pounds, and it is a strong animal to boot; but it can't do anything when the snow is deep. You'll find it good eating, at all events, when we bring one in.""",large animal dangerous turn bay miss moose horn weigh pound strong animal boot do snow deep find good eating event bring 
12,"""I'll bring one,"" said John, who was cleaning his rifle.",bring say clean rifle 
13,"""I dare say you will as soon as you can manage your snow-shoes,"" replied Martin. ""The wind is getting up higher. I guess you'll not find your way back to Malachi's lodge, Master John, as you thought to do to-morrow morning.""",say manage snow shoe reply wind get high guess find way lodge think do morning 
14,"""It is certainly a dreadful night,"" observed Mrs. Campbell; ""and I feel the cold very sensibly.""",dreadful night observe feel cold

16,"""It is time to go to bed,"" observed Mr. Campbell, ""so put away your work: and, Henry, give me down the Bible.""",time go bed observe put work give 
17,"During that night the gale increased to almost a hurricane; the trees of the forest clashed and crackled, groaned and sawed their long arms against each other, creating an unusual and almost appalling noise; the wind howled round the palisades and fluttered the strips of bark on the roof, and as they all lay in bed, they could not sleep from the noise outside, and the increased feeling of cold. It was also the first trial of this new house in severe weather, and some of the wakeful party were anxiously watching the result. Toward the morning the storm abated, and every thing was again quiet. In consequence of the restless night which they had passed they were not so early as usual. Emma and Mary, when they came out of their room, found Martin and Alfred up and very busy with shovels; and, to their astonishment, they perceived that the snow was at least three feet deep on the ground, and in some places had been drifted up higher than their heads.",night gale increase hurricane tree forest clash crackle groan saw long arm other create unusual appalling noise wind howl palisadd flutter strip bark roof lay bed sleep noise increase feeling cold first trial new house severe weather wakeful party watch result morning storm abate thing quiet consequence restless night pass early usual come room find busy shovel astonishment perceive snow least foot deep ground place drift high head

19,"""It still snows,"" observed Mary; ""not much, indeed, but the sky is very black.""",snow observe much sky black 
20,"""Yes, miss; we shall have some more of it yet,"" observed Martin. ""Mr. Campbell and Henry have gone to the store-house for more shovels, for we must work hard, and clear a footpath, and then get the snow up against the palisades.""",miss have more observe go store house more shovel work clear footpath get snow palisadd 
21,"""What a sudden change,"" said Emma; ""I wish the sky would clear, and then I should not care.""",sudden change say wish sky clear care 
22,"""It will to-morrow, Miss Emma, I dare say; but the snow must come down first.""",say snow come 
23,"Martin and Alfred had only time to clear a path to the store-house. Mr. Campbell and Henry returned with more shovels, and as soon as breakfast was over, they commenced work. As for Mary and Emma going to milk the cows, that was impossible. Martin undertook that task until they had cleared a pathway to the hunter's lodge, in which the animals were shut up every night.",have time clear path store house return more shovel breakfast commence work go milk cow impossible undertake task clear pathway hunter lodge animal shut night 
24,"By the advice of Martin, the snow next the palisades was piled up against the palings like a wall, as high as they could reach or throw it, by which means they got rid of the snow about the house, and at the same time formed a barrier against the freezing winds which they had to expect. All worked hard; Percival and John were of great use, and even Mrs. Campbell and the girls assisted collecting the remainder of the snow, and clearing it off the window-sills and other parts. By noon the snow left off falling, the sky cleared up, and the sun shone bright, although it gave out but little warmth.",advice snow palisadd pile paling wall high reach throw mean get rid snow house same time form barrier freeze wind have expect work great use girl assist collect remainder snow clear window sill other part noon snow leave falling sky clear sun shine bright give little warmth 
25,"After dinner they renewed their labors, and commenced clearing away a path to the lodge, where the cows were locked in, and before nightfall they had accomplished their task as far as the bridge over the stream, which was about half-way. It had been a day of great fatigue, and they were glad to retire to rest. Mrs. Campbell and the girls had put an additional supply of blankets and skins upon the beds, for the cold was now intense, and the thermometer stood far below the freezing point.",dinner renew labor commence clear path lodge cow lock nightfall accomplish task bridge stream half way day great fatigue glad retire rest girl put additional supply blanket skin bed cold intense thermometer stand freezing point 
26,"The following morning they resumed their task; the sky was still unclouded, and the sun shone out clear and bright. By dinner-time the path to the cow house had been completed; and the men then employed themselves in carrying as much fire-wood as they could, before it was dark, within the palisades.",follow morning resume task sky unclouded sun shine clear bright dinner time path cow house complete man employ carry much fire wood dark palisadd 
27,"""Well,"" observed Alfred, ""now things may go on as usual within doors; and what have we to do out, Martin?""",observe thing go usual door do 
28,"""You must first get on your snow-shoes, and learn to walk in them,"" observed Martin; ""or otherwise you'll be a prisoner as well as the ladies. You see, John, you're not at Malachi's lodge.""",get snow shoe learn walk observe prisoner lady see lodge 
29,"""Go to-morrow,"" replied John.",go reply 
30,"""No; not to-morrow, for I must go with you,"" said Martin; ""I can not trust you for finding your way; and I can not go to-morrow nor the next day either. We must kill our beef to-morrow; there's no fear but it will keep all the winter now, and we shall save our hay.""",go say trust find way go next day kill beef be fear keep winter save hay 
31,"""My larder is but poorly furnished,"" observed Mrs. Campbell.",larder furnish observe

36,"""What is the name of this fish, Martin?""",name fish 
37,"""It is called the white-fish,"" replied Martin, ""and I have heard gentry from the old country say that they have none better, if any so good.""",call white fish reply hear gentry old country say have good good 
38,"""It is certainly most excellent,"" replied Mr. Campbell, ""and we will not forget to have a good provision for next winter, if it please God to spare our lives.""",excellent reply forget have good provision next winter spare life 
39,"""Where were you born, Martin?"" said Henry, as they were sitting round the kitchen fire, as usual in the evening.",bear say sit kitchen fire usual evening 
40,"""Why, Mr. Henry, I was born at Quebec. My father was a corporal in the army under General Wolfe, and was wounded in the great battle fought between him and the Frenchman Montcalm.""",bear father corporal army wound great battle fight 
41,"""In which both generals were killed, but the victory was to us.""",general kill victory 
42,"""So I've heard, sir,"" replied Martin. ""My mother was an English woman, and I was born about four years after the surrender of Quebec. My mother died soon afterward, but my father was alive about five years ago, I believe. I can't exactly say, as I was for three or four years in the employ of the Fur Company, and when I returned, I found that he was dead.""",hear sir reply mother english woman bear year surrender mother die father alive year believe say year employ return find dead 
43,"""And you have been a hunter all your life?""",hunter life 
44,"""Not all my life, and not exactly a hunter. I call myself a trapper, but I still am both. I first was out with the Indians when I was about fourteen, for you see my father wanted to make me a drummer, and I could not stand that; so I said to him, 'Father, I won't be a drummer.' 'Well,' says he, 'Martin, you must help yourself, for all my interest lies in the army.' 'So I will,' says I; 'father, I'm off for the woods.' 'Well,' says he, 'just as you like, Martin.' So one fine day I wished him good-by, and did not see him again for more than two years.""",life hunter call trapper see father want make drummer stand say father drummer say help interest lie army say father wood say like fine day wish good see more year 
45,"""Well, and what took place then?""",take place 
46,"""Why, I brought home three or four packages of good skins, and sold them well. Father was so pleased, that he talked of turning trapper himself, but, as I told the old man, a man with a lame leg--for he had been wounded in the leg and halted--would not make his livelihood by hunting in the woods of Canada.""",bring package good skin sell father pleased talk turn trapper tell old man man lame leg wound leg halt make livelihood hunt wood 
47,"""Was your father still in the army?""",father army 
48,"""No, ma'am, he was not in the army; but he was employed in the storekeeper's department; they gave him the berth on account of his wound.""",army employ storekeeper department give berth account wound 
49,"""Well, go on, Martin.""",go 
50,"""I haven't much more to say, ma'am, I brought home my furs, sold them, and father helped me to spend the money as long as he was alive, and very welcome he was to his share. I felt rather queer when I came back from the Fur Company and found that the old man was dead, for I had looked forward with pleasure to the old man's welcome, and his enjoying his frolic with me as usual.""",more say bring fur sell father help spend money alive welcome share feel queer come find old man dead look pleasure old man welcome enjoy frolic usual 
51,"""I'm afraid those frolics were not very wise, Martin.""",afraid frolic wise 
52,"""No, sir, they were very foolish, I believe; but I fear it will always be the case with us trappers. We are like sailors, we do not know what to do with money when we get it; so we throw it away, and the sooner the better, for it is our enemy while we have it. I assure you, sir, that I used to feel quite happy when all my money was gone, and I was setting off to the woods again. It's a hard life, but a life that unfits you for any other; a life which you become very fond of. I don't mind being here with you by way of a change; indeed, as long as there is hunting, it is almost as good as if I were in the woods, but else I think I shall die a trapper.""",sir foolish believe fear case trapper sailor know do money get throw good enemy have assure sir use feel happy money gone set wood hard life life unfit other life become fond mind way change be hunting good wood think die trapper 
53,"""But, Martin,"" said Mr. Campbell, ""how much more wise would it be to put your money by, and after a time purchase a farm and settle down a steady man with property, perhaps married and the father of a family.""",say wise put money time purchase farm settle steady man property married father family 
54,"""Perhaps it might be; but if I do not like it so well as trapping, I don't see why I should do so; it would be changing my life to please others and not myself.""",like trapp see do change life please other 
55,"""That's very true, Martin,"" said Alfred, laughing.",true say laugh 
56,"""Perhaps Martin may change his mind before he is an old man,"" replied Mrs. Campbell. ""Dear me! what noise was that?"" exclaimed Mrs. Campbell, as a melancholy howl was heard without.",change mind old man reply noise exclaim melancholy howl hear 
57,"""Only a rascally wolf, ma'am,"" said Martin; ""we must expect the animals to be about us now that the snow has fallen, and the winter has set in.""",rascally wolf ma'am say expect animal snow fall winter set 
58,"""A wolf! are they not dangerous, Martin?"" inquired Mary Percival.",wolf dangerous inquire 
59,"""That depends, miss, how hungry they may be; but they are not very fond of attacking a human being; if we had any sheep outside, I fancy that they would stand a bad chance.""",depend miss hungry fond attack human being have sheep fancy stand bad chance 
60,"The howl was repeated, when one or two of the dogs which had been admitted into the house and were stretched before the fire, roused up and growled.",howl repeat dog admit house stretch fire rouse growl 
61,"""They hear him, ma'am, and if we were to let them out, would soon be at him. No, no, John, sit still and put down your rifle; we can't afford to hurt wolves; their skins won't fetch a half-dollar, and their flesh is not fit for a clog, let alone a Christian. Let the vermin howl till he is tired; he'll be off to the woods again before daylight.""",hear let sit put rifle afford hurt wolf skin fetch half dollar flesh fit clog let alone let vermin howl tired wood daylight

63,"""What, Emma, afraid?"" said Alfred, going to her; ""why yes, really she trembles; why, my dear Emma, do you recollect how frightened you and Mary were at the noise of the frogs when you first came here; you got used to it very soon, and so you will to the howl of a wolf.""",afraid say go tremble dear recollect frighten noise frog come use howl wolf 
64,"""There is some difference, Alfred,"" replied Emma, shuddering as the howl was repeated. ""I don't know how it is,"" said she, rallying her spirits, ""but I believe it was reading Little Red Riding Hood when I was a child, which has given me such a horror of a wolf; I shall get over it very soon, I have no doubt.""",be difference reply shudder howl repeat know say rallying spirit believe read little red child give horror wolf get have doubt 
65,"""I must say, that it does not create the most agreeable sensation in my mind,"" observed Mrs. Campbell, ""but I was aware of what we were to encounter when we came here, and if it is only to be annoyed with the cry of a wild beast, we may consider that we get off very cheaply.""",say create agreeable sensation mind observe aware encounter come annoy cry wild beast consider get

71,"""And the rest soon shall be,"" said Alfred, ""even the three appropriated for your use, mother and cousins.

72,"""No, it has not, and I am very glad that I did learn it; I am a coward in apprehension, Alfred, but, perhaps, if I was put to the test, I should behave better.""",glad learn coward apprehension put test behave good 
73,"""That I really believe,"" replied Alfred; ""a gale of wind at sea sounds very awful when down below jerking about in your hammock, but when on deck, you don't care a fig about it. Now the rifles are all loaded, and we may go to bed and sleep sound."" They did retire to rest, but all parties did not sleep very sound; the howling of one wolf was answered by another; Emma and Mary embraced each other, and shuddered as they heard the sounds, and it was long before they forgot their alarm and were asleep.",believe reply gale wind sea sound awful jerk hammock deck care fig rifle load go bed sleep sound retire rest party sleep sound howling wolf answer embrace other shudder hear sound long forget alarm asleep
