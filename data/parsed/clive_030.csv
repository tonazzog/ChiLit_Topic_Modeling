1,CHAPTER 29. The Siege Of Pondicherry.,
2," As the health of the two officers was shaken by their long and arduous work, and their services were not, for the moment, needed, they obtained leave for three months, and went down in a coasting ship to Columbo, where several English trading stations had been established. Here they spent two months, residing for the most part among the hills, at the town of a rajah very friendly to the English; and with him they saw an elephant hunt, the herd being driven into a great inclosure, formed by a large number of natives who had, for weeks, been employed upon it. Here the animals were fastened to trees by natives, who cut through the thick grass unobserved; and were one by one reduced to submission, first by hunger, and then by being lustily belaboured by the trunks of tamed elephants. Tim highly appreciated the hunt, and declared that tiger shooting was not to be compared to it.",health officer shake long arduous work service moment need obtain leave month go coasting ship several english trading station establish spend month reside most part hill town rajah friendly see elephant hunt herd drive great inclosure form large number native week employ animal fasten tree native cut thick grass unobserve reduce submission hunger belaboure trunk tame elephant appreciate hunt declare tiger shooting compare 
3,"Their residence in the brisk air of the hills completely restored their health, and they returned to Madras perfectly ready to take part in the great operations which were impending. Charlie, on his return, was appointed to serve as chief of the staff to Colonel Coote; Captain Peters being given the command of a small body of European horse, who were, with a large body of irregulars, to aid in bringing in supplies to the British army, and to prevent the enemy from receiving food from the surrounding country.",residence brisk air hill restore health return ready take part great operation impend return appoint serve chief staff give command small body european horse large body irregular aid bring supplies british army prevent enemy receive food surround country 
4,"Early in June, the British squadron off the coast was joined by two ships of the line, the Norfolk and Panther, from England; and a hundred Europeans, and a detachment of European and native artillery came down from Bombay.",british squadron coast join ship line detachment european native artillery come 
5,"Around Pondicherry ran a strong cactus hedge, strengthened with palisades, and the French retired into this at the beginning of July. They were too strongly posted there to be attacked by the force with which the English at first approached them, and they were expecting the arrival of a large body of troops from Mysore, with a great convoy of provisions.",run strong cactus hedge strengthen palisadd retire beginning post attack force approach expect arrival large body troops great convoy provision 
6,"On the 17th these approached. Major Moore, who was guarding the English rear, had a hundred and eighty European infantry; fifty English horse, under Peters; sixteen hundred irregular horse; and eleven hundred Sepoys. The Mysoreans had four thousand good horse, a thousand Sepoys, and two hundred Europeans, with eight pieces of cannon.",17th approach guard english rear have european infantry english horse irregular horse sepoy have good horse sepoy piece cannon 
7,"The fight lasted but a few minutes. The British native horse and Sepoys at once gave way; and the English infantry retreated, in great disorder, to the fort of Trivadi, which they gained with a loss of fifteen killed and forty wounded. Peters' horse alone behaved well. Several times they charged right through the masses of Mysorean horse; but when five-and-twenty were killed, and most of the rest, including their commander, severely wounded, they also fell back into the fort.",fight last few minute british native horse give way english infantry retreat great disorder fort gain loss kill wound horse behave several time charge mass horse kill most rest include commander wound fall fort 
8,"Colonel Coote, when the news of the disaster reached him, determined, if possible, to get possession of the fort of Vellenore, which stood on the river Ariangopang, some three miles from Pondicherry, and covered the approaches of the town from that side. The English encampment was at Perimbe, on the main road leading, through an avenue of trees, to Pondicherry. Colonel Coote threw up a redoubt on the hill behind Perimbe, and another on the avenue, to check any French force advancing from Pondicherry. These works were finished on the morning of the 19th of July.",news disaster reach determine possible get possession stand river mile cover approach town side english encampment main road lead avenue tree throw redoubt hill avenue check french force advance work finish morning 19th 
9,"The next morning the French army advanced along the river Ariangopang, but Coote marched half his force to meet them, while he moved the rest as if to attack the redoubts, interspersed along the line of hedge. As the fall of these would have placed the attacking force in his rear, Lally at once returned to the town. The same evening the Mysoreans, with three thousand bullocks carrying their artillery and drawing their baggage, and three thousand more laden with rice and other provisions, arrived on the other bank of the Ariangopang river, crossed under the guns of the redoubt of that name, and entered the town.",next morning french army advance river march force meet move rest attack redoubt intersperse line hedge fall place attack force rear return town same evening bullock carry artillery draw baggage laden rice other provision arrive other bank river cross gun redoubt name enter town 
10,"The fort of Vellenore was strong, but the road had been cut straight through the glacis to the gate, and the French had neglected to erect works to cover this passage. Coote took advantage of the oversight, and laid his two eighteen-pounders to play upon the gate, while two others were placed to fire upon the parapet. The English batteries opened at daybreak on the 16th, and at nine o'clock the whole of the French army, with the Mysoreans, advanced along the bank of the river.",strong road cut glacis gate neglect erect work cover passage take advantage oversight lay pounder play gate other place fire parapet english battery open daybreak 16th o'clock whole french army advance bank river 
11,"Coote at once got his troops under arms, and advanced towards the French, sending a small detachment of Europeans to reinforce the Sepoys firing at the fort of Vellenore. By this time the batteries had beaten down the parapet, and silenced the enemy's fire. Two companies of Sepoys set forward, at full run, up to the very crest of the glacis.",get troops arm advance send small detachment reinforce fire fort time battery beat parapet silence enemy fire company sepoy set full run very crest glacis 
12,"The French commander of the place had really nothing to fear, as the Sepoys had a ditch to pass, and a very imperfect breach to mount, and the fort might have held out for two days, before the English could have been in a position to storm it. The French army was in sight, and in ten minutes a general engagement would have begun. In spite of all this, the coward at once hoisted a flag of truce, and surrendered. The Europeans and Sepoys ran in through the gate, and the former instantly turned the guns of the fort upon the French army. This halted, struck with amazement and anger, and Lally at once ordered it to retire upon the town.",french commander place have fear have ditch pass imperfect breach mount fort hold day position storm french army sight minute general engagement begin spite coward hoist flag truce surrender run gate former turn gun fort french army halt strike amazement anger order retire town 
13,"A week afterwards six ships, with six hundred fresh troops from England, arrived.",week ship fresh troops arrive 
14,"The Mysoreans, who had brought food into Pondicherry, made many excursions in the country, but were sharply checked. They were unable to supply themselves with food, and none could be spared them from the stores in the magazines. Great distress set in among them, and this was heightened by the failure of a party, with two thousand bullocks with rice, to enter the town. This party, escorted by the greater portion of the Mysorean horse from Pondicherry, was attacked and defeated, and nine hundred bullocks, laden with baggage, captured. Shortly afterwards the rest of the Mysorean troops left Pondicherry, and marched to attack Trinomany.",bring food make many excursion country check unable supply food spare store magazine great distress set heighten failure party bullock rice enter town party escort great portion mysorean horse attack defeat bullock laden baggage capture rest troops leave march attack 
15,"Seeing that there was little fear of their returning to succour Pondicherry, the English now determined to complete the blockade of that place. In order to have any chance of reducing it by famine, it was necessary to obtain possession of the country within the hedge; which, with its redoubts, extended in the arc of a circle from the river Ariangopang to the sea. The space thus included contained an area of nearly seven square miles, affording pasture for the bullocks, of which there were sufficient to supply the troops and inhabitants for many months. Therefore, although the army was not yet strong enough to open trenches against the town, and indeed the siege artillery had not yet sailed from Madras, it was determined to get possession of the hedge and its redoubts.",see be little fear return succour determined complete blockade place order have chance reduce famine necessary obtain possession country hedge redoubt extend arc circle river sea space include contain area square mile afford pasture bullock be sufficient supply troops inhabitant many month army strong open trenche town siege artillery sail determined get possession hedge redoubt 
16,"Before doing this, however, it was necessary to capture the fort of Ariangopang. This was a difficult undertaking. The whole European force was but two thousand strong, and if eight hundred of these were detached across the river to attack the fort, the main body would be scarcely a match for the enemy, should he march out against them. If, on the other hand, the whole army moved round to attack the fort, the enemy would be able to send out and fetch in the great convoy of provisions collected at Jinji.",do necessary capture fort difficult undertaking whole european force strong detach river attack fort main body match enemy march other hand whole army move attack fort enemy able send fetch great convoy provision collect 
17,"Mr. Pigot therefore requested Admiral Stevens to land the marines of the fleet. Although, seeing that a large French fleet was expected, the admiral was unwilling to weaken his squadron; he complied with the request, seeing the urgency of the case, and four hundred and twenty marines were landed.",request land marine fleet see large french fleet expect admiral unwilling weaken squadron complie request see urgency case marine land 
18,"On the 2nd of September two more men-of-war, the America and Medway, arrived, raising the fleet before Pondicherry to seventeen ships of the line. They convoyed several Company's ships, who had brought with them the wing of a Highland regiment.",2nd more man war arrive raise fleet ship line convoy several company ship bring wing regiment 
19,"The same evening Coote ordered four hundred men to march to invest the fort of Ariangopang; but Colonel Monson, second in command, was so strongly against the step that, at the last moment, he countermanded his orders. The change was fortunate, for Lally, who had heard from his spies of the English intentions, moved his whole army out to attack the--as he supposed--weakened force.",same evening order man march invest fort second command step last moment countermand order change fortunate hear spy english intention move whole army attack suppose weaken force 
20,"At ten at night fourteen hundred French infantry, a hundred French horse, and nine hundred Sepoys marched out to attack the English, who had no suspicion of their intent. Two hundred marines and five hundred Sepoys proceeded, in two columns. Marching from the Valdore redoubt, one party turned to the right to attack the Tamarind redoubt, which the English had erected on the Red Hill. Having taken this, they were to turn to their left and join the other column. This skirted the foot of the Red Hill, to attack the redoubt erected on a hillock at its foot, on the 18th July.",night french infantry french horse sepoy march attack have suspicion intent marine sepoy proceed column march redoubt party turn right attack redoubt erect red take turn left join other column skirt foot red attack redoubt erect hillock foot 18th 
21,"Four hundred Sepoys and a company of Portuguese were to take post at the junction of the Valdore and Oulgarry avenues. The regiments of Lorraine and Lally were to attack the battery in this avenue, Lorraine's from the front, while Lally's, marching outwards in the fields, was to fall on its right flank. The Indian battalion, with the Bourbon volunteers, three hundred strong, were to march from the fort of Ariangopang, across the river, to the villages under the fort of Vellenore; and, as soon as the fire became general, were to fall upon the right rear of the English encampment.",company take post junction avenue regiment attack battery avenue front march field fall right flank indian battalion volunteer strong march fort river village fort fire become general fall right rear english encampment 
22,"At midnight a rocket gave the signal, and the attack immediately commenced. The attack on the Tamarind redoubt was repulsed, but the redoubt on the hillock was captured, and the guns spiked. At the intrenchment on the Oulgarry Road the fight was fierce, and Colonel Coote himself brought down his troops to its defence. The attack was continued, but as, owing to some mistake, the column intended to fall upon the English rear had halted, and did not arrive in time, the regiments of Lorraine and Lally drew off, and the whole force retired to the town.",midnight rocket give signal attack commence attack redoubt repulse redoubt hillock capture gun spike intrenchment fight fierce bring troops defence attack continue ow mistake column intend fall english rear halt arrive time regiment draw whole force retire town 
23,"The ships arriving from England brought a commission appointing Monson to the rank of Colonel, with a date prior to that of Colonel Coote; ordering him, however, not to assert his seniority, so long as Coote remained at Madras. Coote, however, considered that it was intended that he should return to Bengal, and so handing over the command to Monson, he went back to Madras.",ship arrive bring commission appoint rank date prior order assert seniority remain consider intend return hand command go 
24,"Colonel Monson at once prepared to attack the hedge, and its redoubts. Leaving sufficient guards for the camp, he advanced at midnight, with his troops divided into two brigades, the one commanded by himself, the other by Major Smith. Major Smith's division was first to attack the enemy, outside the hedge in the village of Oulgarry; and, driving them hence, to carry the Vellenore redoubt, while the main body were to make a sweep round the Red Hill, and come down to the attack of the Valdore redoubt.",prepare attack hedge redoubt leave sufficient guard camp advance midnight troops divide brigade one command other division first attack enemy hedge village drive carry redoubt main body make sweep red come attack redoubt 
25,"Smith, moving to the right of the Oulgarry avenue, attacked that position on the left; and the advance, led by Captain Myers, carried by storm a redoubt in front of the village, and seized four pieces of cannon. Major Smith, heading his grenadiers, then charged the village, tore down all obstacles, and carried the place.",move right avenue attack position left advance lead carry storm redoubt front village seize piece cannon head grenadier charge village tore obstacle carry place 
26,"The day had begun to dawn when Colonel Monson approached the Valdore redoubt. But at the last moment, making a mistake in their way, the head of the column halted. At this moment the enemy perceived them, and discharged a twenty-four pounder, loaded with small shot, into the column. Eleven men were killed and twenty-six wounded by this terrible discharge, among the latter Colonel Monson himself, his leg being broken. The grenadiers now rushed furiously to the attack, swarmed round the redoubt and, although several times repulsed, at last forced their way through the embrasures and captured the position.",day begin dawn approach redoubt last moment make mistake way head column halt moment enemy perceive discharge pounder load small shot column man kill wound terrible discharge latter leg break grenadier rush attack swarm redoubt several time repulse last force way embrasure capture position 
27,"The defenders of the village of Oulgarry had halted outside the Vellenore redoubt; but, upon hearing the firing to their right, retreated hastily within it. Major Smith pressed them hotly with his brigade, and followed so closely upon their heels that they did not stop to defend the position, but retreated to the town. Major Smith was soon joined by the Highlanders, under Major Scott, who had forced a way through the hedge between the two captured redoubts.",defender village halt redoubt hear fire right retreat press brigade follow heel stop defend position retreat town join force way hedge capture redoubt 
28,"Thus the whole line of the outer defence fell into the hands of the English, with the exception of the Ariangopang redoubt on the left, which was held by the India regiment. Major Gordon, who now took the command, placed the Bombay detachment, of three hundred and fifty men, in the captured redoubts; and encamped the whole of the force in the fields to the right of Oulgarry.",whole line outer defence fall hand exception redoubt left hold regiment take command place detachment man capture redoubt encamp whole force field right 
29,"Major Smith advised that at least a thousand men should be left, near at hand, to succour the garrisons of the redoubts; which, being open at the rear, were liable to an attack. Major Gordon foolishly refused to follow his advice, and the same night the French attacked the redoubts. The Bombay troops, however, defended themselves with extreme bravery until assistance arrived.",advise least man leave hand succour garrison redoubt open rear liable attack refuse follow advice same night attack redoubt troops defend extreme bravery assistance arrive 
30,"Three days later the French evacuated and blew up the fort of Ariangopang, which the English were preparing to attack, and the India regiment retired into the town, leaving, however, the usual guard in the Ariangopang redoubt.",day evacuate blow fort prepare attack regiment retire town leave usual guard redoubt 
31,"Colonel Coote had scarcely arrived at Madras when he received a letter from Colonel Monson, saying that he was likely to be incapacitated by his wound for some months, and requesting that he would resume the command of the army. The authorities of Madras strongly urged Coote to return, representing the extreme importance of the struggle in which they were engaged. He consented, and reached camp on the night of the 20th. He at once ordered the captured redoubts to be fortified, to prevent the enemy again taking the offensive; and erected a strong work, called the North Redoubt, near the seashore and facing the Madras redoubt.",arrive receive letter say likely incapacitate wound month request resume command army authority urge return represent extreme importance struggle engage consent reach camp night 20th order capture redoubt fortify prevent enemy take offensive erect strong work call seashore face redoubt 
32,"A few days later, on a party of Sepoys approaching the Ariangopang redoubt, the occupants of that place were seized with a panic, abandoned the place, and went into the town. The English had now possession of the whole of the outward defences of Pondicherry, with the exception of the two redoubts by the seashore.",few day party approach redoubt occupant place seize panic abandon place go town have possession whole outward defence exception redoubt seashore 
33,"A day or two later Colonel Coote, advancing along the sea beach as if with a view of merely making a reconnaissance, pushed on suddenly, entered the village called the Blancherie, as it was principally inhabited by washerwomen, and attacked the Madras redoubt. This was carried, but the same night the garrison sallied out again, and fell upon the party of Sepoys posted there. Ensign MacMahon was killed, but the Sepoys, although driven out from the redoubt, bravely returned and again attacked the French; who, thinking that the Sepoys must have received large reinforcements, fell back into the village; from which, a day or two later, they retired into the town.",day advance sea beach view make reconnaissance push enter village call inhabit washerwomen attack redoubt carry same night garrison sall fall party post kill drive redoubt return attack think receive large reinforcement fall village day retire town 
34,"The whole of the ground outside the fort, between the river Ariangopang and the sea, was now in the hands of the English. The French still maintained their communications with the south by the sandy line of coast. By this time the attacks, which the English from Trichinopoli and Madura had made upon the Mysoreans, had compelled the latter to make peace, and recall their army, which was still hovering in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry.",whole ground fort river sea hand maintain communication south sandy line coast time attack make compel latter make peace recall army hover neighbourhood 
35,"Charlie, who had been suffering from a slight attack of fever, had for some time been staying on board ship, for change. In the road of Pondicherry three of the French Indiamen, the Hermione, Baleine, and the Compagnie des Indes, were at anchor, near the edge of the surf, under the cover of a hundred guns mounted on the sea face of the fort. These ships were awaiting the stormy weather, at the breaking of the monsoon, when it would be difficult for the English fleet to maintain their position off the town. They then intended to sail away to the south, fill up with provisions, and return to Pondicherry.",suffer slight attack fever have time stay board ship change road french anchor edge surf cover gun mount sea face fort ship await stormy weather breaking monsoon difficult english fleet maintain position town intend sail south fill provision return 
36,"Admiral Stevens, in order to prevent this contingency, which would have greatly delayed the reduction of the place, determined to cut them out. Charlie's health being much restored by the sea breezes, he asked leave of the admiral to accompany the expedition, as a volunteer. On the evening of the 6th, six-and-twenty of the boats of the fleet, manned by four hundred sailors, were lowered and rowed to the Tiger, which was at anchor within two miles of Pondicherry, the rest of the fleet lying some distance farther away.",order prevent contingency delay reduction place determine cut health restore sea breeze ask leave admiral accompany expedition volunteer evening 6th boat fleet manned sailor lower row anchor mile rest fleet lie distance 
37,"When, at midnight, the cabin lights of the Hermione were extinguished, the expedition started. The boats moved in two divisions, one of which was to attack the Hermione, the other the Baleine. The third vessel lay nearer in shore, and was to be attacked if the others were captured.",midnight cabin light extinguish expedition start boat move division attack other third vessel lay shore attack other capture 
38,"The night was a very dark one, and the boats of each division moved in line, with ropes stretched from boat to boat, to ensure their keeping together in the right direction. Charlie was in one of the boats intended to attack the Hermione. Tim accompanied him, but the admiral had refused permission for Hossein to do so, as there were many more white volunteers for the service than the boats would accommodate. They were within fifty yards of the Hermione before they were discovered, and a scattering musket fire was at once opened upon them.",night dark one boat division move line rope stretch boat boat ensure keep right direction boat intend attack accompany admiral refuse permission do be many more white volunteer service boat accommodate yard discover scattering musket fire open 
39,"The crews gave a mighty cheer and, casting off the ropes, separated; five making for each side of the ship, while two rowed forward to cut the cables at her bows. The Compagnie des Indes opened fire upon the boats, but these were already alongside the ship, and the sailors swarmed over the side at ten points.",crew give mighty cheer cast rope separate make side ship row cut cable bow open fire boat ship sailor swarm side point 
40,"The combat was a short one. The seventy men on board fought bravely, for a minute or two, but they were speedily driven below. The hatches were closed over them, and the cables being already cut, the mizzen topsail, the only sail bent, was hoisted; and the boats, taking towropes, began to row her away from shore.",combat short one man board fight minute drive hatch close cable cut mizzen only sail bend hoist boat take towrope begin row shore 
41,"The instant, however, that the cessation of fire informed the garrison the ship was captured, a tremendous cannonade was opened by the guns of the fortress. The lightning was flashing vividly, and this enabled the gunners to direct their aim upon the ship. Over and over again she was struck, and one shot destroyed the steering wheel, cut the tiller rope, and killed two men who were steering. The single sail was not sufficient to assist in steering her, and the men in the boats rowed with such energy that the ropes continually snapped.",instant cessation fire inform garrison ship capture tremendous cannonade open gun fortress lightning flash enable gunner direct aim ship strike shot destroy steering wheel cut tiller rope kill man steering single sail sufficient assist steering man boat row such energy rope snap 
42,"The fire continued from the shore, doing considerable damage; and the men in the boats, who could not see that the ship was moving through the water, concluded that she was anchored by a concealed cable and anchor. The officer in command, therefore, called up the Frenchmen from below, telling them he was about to fire the ship. They came on deck and took their places in the boats, which rowed back to the Tiger.",fire continue shore do considerable damage man boat see ship move water conclude anchore conceal cable anchor officer command call tell about fire ship come deck take place boat row 
43,"Upon arriving there Captain Dent, who commanded her, sternly rebuked the officer; and said that, unless the boats returned instantly and brought the Hermione out, he should send his own crew in their boats to fetch her. The division thereupon returned, and met the ship half a mile off shore, the land wind having now sprung up.",arrive command rebuke officer say boat return bring send own crew boat fetch division return meet ship mile shore land wind spring 
44,"The Baleine had been easily captured and, having several sails bent, she was brought out without difficulty. No attempt was made to capture the third vessel.",capture have several sail bend bring difficulty attempt make capture third vessel 
45,"The rains had now set in, but the English laboured steadily at their batteries. The French were becoming pressed for provisions, and Lally turned the whole of the natives remaining in the town, to the number of fourteen hundred men and women, outside the fortifications. On their arrival at the English lines they were refused permission to pass, as Colonel Coote did not wish to relieve the garrison of the consumption of food caused by them. They returned to the French lines, and begged to be again received; but they were, by Lally's orders, fired upon, and several killed.",rain set laboure battery become press provision turn whole native remain town number man woman fortification arrival english line refuse permission pass wish relieve garrison consumption food cause return french line begg receive order fire several kill 
46,"For seven days the unhappy wretches remained without food, save the roots they could gather in the fields. Then Colonel Coote, seeing that Lally was inflexible, allowed them to pass.",day unhappy wretche remain food save root gather field see inflexible allow pass 
47,"On the 10th of November the batteries opened, and every day added to the strength of the fire upon the town. The fortifications, however, were strong, and the siege progressed but slowly. On the 30th of December a tremendous storm burst, and committed the greatest havoc, both at land and sea. The Newcastle, man-of-war; the Queenborough, frigate; and the Protector, fire ship were driven ashore and dashed to pieces; but the crews, with the exception of seven, were saved. The Duke of Aquitaine, the Sunderland, and the Duke, store ship, were sunk, and eleven hundred sailors drowned. Most of the other ships were dismasted.",10th battery open day add strength fire town fortification strong siege progress 30th tremendous storm burst commit great havoc land sea man war frigate fire ship drive dash piece crew exception save store ship sink sailor drown most other ship dismast
