1,CHAPTER 9. A ROD IN PICKLE.,chapter rod 
2,"Loman, who had arrived at the same conclusion respecting Oliver's bravery as the majority in the Fifth, did not allow his conscience to trouble him as to his share of the morning's business.  He never had liked Oliver, and lately especially he had come to dislike him.  He was therefore glad to have made him smart; and now, since the blunder in the cricket match, he felt greatly inclined to repeat the blow, particularly as there did not seem much to fear if he did so.",arrive same conclusion respect bravery majority fifth allow conscience trouble share morning business like come dislike glad make smart blunder cricket match feel inclined repeat blow seem much fear do 
3,"He was quick, too, to see that Oliver had lost favour with his comrades, and had no hesitation in availing himself of every opportunity of widening the breach.  He affected to be sorry for the poor fellow, and to feel that he had been too hard on him, and so on, in a manner which, while it offended the Fifth, as applied to one of their set, exasperated them all the more against Oliver.  And so matters went on, getting more and more unsatisfactory.",quick see lose favour comrade have hesitation avail opportunity widen breach affect sorry poor fellow feel hard manner offend fifth apply set exasperate more matter go get more unsatisfactory 
4,"Loman, however, had other things to think of than his rival's cowardice, and foremost among these was his new fishing-rod--or rather, the rod which he coveted for his own.  Until the day after the Alphabet Match he had not even had time to examine his treasure.  Three pounds ten was an appalling figure to pay for a rod; ""But then,"" thought Loman, ""if it's really a good one, and worth half as much again, it would be a pity to miss such a bargain;"" and every one knew the Crippses, father and son, were authorities on all matters pertaining to the piscatorial art. Loman, too, was never badly off for pocket-money, and could easily raise the amount, he felt sure, when he represented the case at home.  So he took the rod out of its canvas bag, and began to put it together.",have other thing think rival cowardice foremost new fishing rod rod covete own day have time examine treasure pound appalling figure pay rod think good one worth half much pity miss bargain one know father son authority matter pertain piscatorial art pocket money raise amount feel sure represent case home take rod canvas bag begin put 
5,"Now, a boy's study is hardly the place in which to flourish a fishing-rod, and Loman found that with the butt down in one bottom corner of the room, the top joint would have to be put on up in the opposite top corner.  When this complicated operation was over, there was no room to move it from its position, still less to judge of its weight and spring, or attach the winch and line.  Happy thought! the window!  He would have any amount of scope there.  So, taking it to pieces, and putting it together again in this new direction, he had the satisfaction of testing it at its full length.  He was pleased with the rod, on the whole.  He attached the line, with a fly at the end, in order to give it a thorough trial, and gave a scientific ""cast"" into an imaginary pool.  It was a splendid rod, just right for him; how he wished he was up above Gusset Weir at that moment!  Why, he could--",boy study place flourish fishing rod find butt bottom corner room top joint have put opposite top corner complicated operation be room move position less judge weight spring attach winch line happy thought window have amount scope take piece put new direction have satisfaction test full length pleased rod whole attach line fly end order give thorough trial give scientific cast imaginary pool splendid rod right wish moment 
6,"Here he attempted to draw up the rod.  There was an ugly tug and a crack as he did so, and he found, to his disgust, that the hook, having nothing else to catch, had caught the ivy on the wall, and, what was worse, that the top joint of the rod had either snapped or cracked in its inability to bring this weighty catch to shore.  It was a long time before Loman was able to disengage his line, and bring the rod in again at the window.  The top joint was cracked.  It looked all right as he held it, but when he tried to bend it it had lost its spring, and the crack showed only too plainly.  Another misfortune still was in store. The reel in winding up suddenly stuck.  Loman, fancying it had only caught temporarily, tried to force it, and in so doing the spring broke, and the handle turned uselessly round and round in his hand.  This _was_ a streak of bad luck, and no mistake!  The rod was not his, and what was worse, it was (so Cripps said) a rod of extraordinary excellence and value.  Loman had his doubts now about this.  A first-rate top-piece would bend nearly double and then not break, and a reel that broke at the least pressure could hardly be of the best kind.  Still, Cripps thought a lot of it, and Loman had undoubtedly himself alone to blame for the accidents which had occurred.  As it was, the rod was now useless.  He knew there was no place in Maltby where he could get it repaired, and it was hardly to be expected that Cripps would take it back.",attempt draw rod be ugly tug crack do find disgust hook have else catch catch ivy wall bad top joint rod snap crack inability bring weighty catch shore long time able disengage line bring rod window top joint crack look right hold try bend lose spring crack show misfortune store reel wind stuck fancy catch try force do spring break handle turn hand streak bad luck mistake rod bad say rod extraordinary excellence value have doubt first rate top piece bend double break reel break least pressure good kind think lot have alone blame accident occur rod useless know be place get repair expect take 
7,"What was to be done?  Either he must pay 3 pounds 10 shillings for a rod of no value, or--",do pay pound shilling rod value 
8,"He slowly took the rod to pieces and put it back into the canvas bag. The top joint after all did not look amiss; and, yes, there was a _little_ bit of elasticity in it.  Perhaps the crack was only his fancy; or perhaps the crack was there when he got it.  As to the reel, it looked as if it _ought_ to work, and perhaps it would if he only knew the way.  Ah! suppose he just sent the rod back to Cripps with a message that he found he did not require it?  He would not say he had not used it, but if Cripps chose to imagine he received it back just as he sent it, well, what harm?  Cripps would be sure to sell it to some one else, or else put it by (he had said he possessed a rod of his own).  If he, Loman, had felt quite certain that he had damaged the rod himself, of course he would not think of such a thing; but he was not at all certain the thing was not defective to begin with.  In any case it was an inferior rod--that he had no doubt about--and Cripps was not acting honestly by trying to pass it off on him as one of the best make.  Yes, it would serve Cripps right, and be a lesson to him, and he was sure, yes, quite sure now, it had been damaged to begin with.",take rod piece put canvas bag top joint look amiss be _little_ bit elasticity crack fancy crack get reel look _ought_ work know way suppose send rod message find require say use choose imagine receive send harm sure sell one else put say possess rod own feel certain damage rod course think thing certain thing defective begin case inferior rod have doubt act try pass good make serve right lesson sure sure damage begin 
9,"And so the boy argued with himself and coquetted with the tempter. Before the afternoon was over he felt (as he imagined) quite comfortable in his own mind over the affair.  The rod was tied up again in its bag exactly as it had been before, and only wanted an opportunity to be returned to Mr Cripps.",boy argue coquett tempter afternoon feel imagine comfortable own mind affair rod tie bag want opportunity return 
10,"After that Loman settled down to an evening's study.  But things were against him again.  Comfortable as his conscience was, that top joint would not let him alone.  It seemed to get into his hand in place of the pen, and to point out the words in the lexicon in place of his finger. He tried not to mind it, but it annoyed him, and, what was worse, interfered with his work.  So, shutting up his books, and imagining a change of air might be beneficial, he went off to Callonby's study, there to gossip for an hour or two, and finally rid himself of his tormentor.",settle evening study thing comfortable conscience top joint let seem get hand place pen point word lexicon place finger try mind annoy bad interfer work shut book imagin change air beneficial go study gossip hour rid tormentor 
11,"Stephen, meanwhile, had had Mr Cripps on his mind too, for that afternoon his bat had come home.  It was addressed to ""Mr Greenfield, Saint Dominic's,"" and of course taken to Oliver, who wondered much to receive a small size cricket-bat in a parcel.  Master Paul, however, who was in attendance, was able to clear up the mystery.",have mind afternoon bat come address course take wonder much receive small size cricket bat parcel attendance able clear mystery

13,"""All I can say is, he must be more flush of cash than I am, to go in for a thing like this.  Send him here, Paul.""",say more flush cash go thing send

26,"""But I can't; I've only two shillings left,"" said Stephen, dejectedly.",shilling leave say 
27,"""Why, whatever have you done with the five shillings you had last week?""",do shilling have last week 
28,"Stephen blushed, and then faltered, ""I spent sixpence on stamps and sixpence on--on brandy-balls!""",blush falter spend sixpence stamp sixpence brandy ball 
29,"""I thought so.  And what did you do with the rest?""",think do rest 
30,"""Oh!  I--I--that is--I--gave them away.""",give

33,"""Where?--when?  Upon my word, Stephen, you _are_ a jackass--who to?""",word jackass 
34,"And then Stephen confessed, and the elder brother rated him soundly for his folly, till the little fellow felt quite miserable and ashamed of himself.  In the end, Oliver insisted on Stephen finding out at once what the price of the bat was, and promised he would lend his brother the money for it.  In return for this, Stephen promised to make no more purchases of this kind without first consulting Oliver, and at this juncture Wraysford turned up, and Stephen beat a retreat with his bat over his shoulder.",confess elder brother rate folly little fellow feel miserable ashamed end insist find price bat promise lend brother money return promise make more purchase kind consult juncture turn beat retreat bat shoulder 
35,"The two friends had not been alone together since _the fracas_ in the Fifth two days before, and both now appeared glad of an opportunity of talking over that and subsequent events.",friend alone fracas_ fifth day appear glad opportunity talk subsequent event

44,"Wraysford looked greatly relieved when this confession was over.  ""You are a rum fellow, Noll,"" said he, after a pause, ""and of course it is all right; but the fellows don't know your reason, and think you showed the white feather.""",look relieved confession rum fellow say pause course right fellow know reason think show white feather

47,"""Steady, old man!"" said Wraysford, good-humouredly; ""I quite agree with you.  But I say, Noll, I think it's a pity you don't put yourself right with them and the school generally, somehow.  Everybody heard Loman call you a fool yesterday, and you know our fellows are so clannish that they think, for the credit of the Fifth, something ought to be done.""",steady old man say good agree say think pity put school hear call fool yesterday know fellow clannish think credit fifth ought do

67,"The reader will no doubt have already decided in his own mind whether Oliver Greenfield did rightly or wrongly in putting his hands into his pockets instead of using them to knock down Loman.  It certainly did not seem to have done him much good at the time.
