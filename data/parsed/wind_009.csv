30,"I will not describe the preparations Diamond made. You would have thought he had been going on a three months’ voyage. Nor will I describe the journey, for our business is now at the place. He was met at the station by his aunt, a cheerful middle-aged woman, and conveyed in safety to the sleepy old town, as his father called it. And no wonder that it was sleepy, for it was nearly dead of old age.",describe preparation make think go month voyage describe journey business place meet station aunt cheerful middle aged woman convey safety sleepy old town father call wonder sleepy dead old age 
31,"Diamond went about staring with his beautiful goggle-eyes, at the quaint old streets, and the shops, and the houses. Everything looked very strange, indeed; for here was a town abandoned by its nurse, the sea, like an old oyster left on the shore till it gaped for weariness. It used to be one of the five chief seaports in England, but it began to hold itself too high, and the consequence was the sea grew less and less intimate with it, gradually drew back, and kept more to itself, till at length it left it high and dry: Sandwich was a seaport no more; the sea went on with its own tide-business a long way off, and forgot it. Of course it went to sleep, and had no more to do with ships. That’s what comes to cities and nations, and boys and girls, who say, “I can do without your help. I’m enough for myself.”",go stare beautiful goggle eye quaint old street shop house look strange town abandon nurse sea old oyster leave shore gape weariness use chief seaport begin hold high consequence sea grow less intimate draw keep more length leave high dry sandwich seaport more sea go own tide business long way forget course go sleep have more do ship come city nation boy girl say do help enough 
32,"Diamond soon made great friends with an old woman who kept a toyshop, for his mother had given him twopence for pocket-money before he left, and he had gone into her shop to spend it, and she got talking to him. She looked very funny, because she had not got any teeth, but Diamond liked her, and went often to her shop, although he had nothing to spend there after the twopence was gone.",make great friend old woman keep toyshop mother give twopence pocket money leave go shop spend get talk look funny get tooth like go shop have spend twopence gone

34,"“Please may I sit down for a minute on this box?” he said, thinking the old woman was somewhere in the shop. But he got no answer, and sat down without one. Around him were a great many toys of all prices, from a penny up to shillings. All at once he heard a gentle whirring somewhere amongst them. It made him start and look behind him. There were the sails of a windmill going round and round almost close to his ear. He thought at first it must be one of those toys which are wound up and go with clockwork; but no, it was a common penny toy, with the windmill at the end of a whistle, and when the whistle blows the windmill goes. But the wonder was that there was no one at the whistle end blowing, and yet the sails were turning round and round--now faster, now slower, now faster again.",sit minute box say think old woman shop get answer sit great many toy price penny shilling hear gentle whirring make start look be sail windmill go close ear think first toy wind go clockwork common penny toy windmill end whistle whistle blow windmill go wonder be whistle end blow sail turn fast slow fast

No doubt South Wind would carry him faster, but South Wind is sitting on her doorstep then, and if I stopped there would be a dead calm. So you are all wrong to say he can sail north in spite of me; he sails north by my help, and my help alone.

I shall be blowing against you; you will be sailing against me; and all will be just as we want it. The captain won’t get on so fast as he would like, but he will get on, and so shall we. I’m just going to put you on board.

Don’t be afraid, it is of no depth, and you will fall on sail-cloth. You will find it nice and warm and dry-only dark; and you will know I am near you by every roll and pitch of the vessel.

116,"In a moment they were on a level with the bulwarks, and North Wind sent the hatch of the after-store rattling away over the deck to leeward. The next, Diamond found himself in the dark, for he had tumbled through the hole as North Wind had told him, and the cover was replaced over his head. Away he went rolling to leeward, for the wind began all at once to blow hard. He heard the call of the captain, and the loud trampling of the men over his head, as they hauled at the main sheet to get the boom on board that they might take in a reef in the mainsail. Diamond felt about until he had found what seemed the most comfortable place, and there he snuggled down and lay.",moment level bulwark send hatch store rattling deck leeward next find dark tumble hole tell cover replace head go roll leeward wind begin blow hear call captain loud trampling man head haul main sheet get boom board take reef mainsail feel find seem comfortable place snuggle lay 
117,"Hours after hours, a great many of them, went by; and still Diamond lay there. He never felt in the least tired or impatient, for a strange pleasure filled his heart. The straining of the masts, the creaking of the boom, the singing of the ropes, the banging of the blocks as they put the vessel about, all fell in with the roaring of the wind above, the surge of the waves past her sides, and the thud with which every now and then one would strike her; while through it all Diamond could hear the gurgling, rippling, talking flow of the water against her planks, as she slipped through it, lying now on this side, now on that--like a subdued air running through the grand music his North Wind was making about him to keep him from tiring as they sped on towards the country at the back of her doorstep.",hour hour great many go lay feel least tired impatient strange pleasure fill heart straining mast creaking boom singing rope bang block put vessel fall roaring wind surge wave side thud strike hear gurgle ripple talk flow water plank slip lie side subdued air run grand music make keep tiring spe country back doorstep 
118,"How long this lasted Diamond had no idea. He seemed to fall asleep sometimes, only through the sleep he heard the sounds going on. At length the weather seemed to get worse. The confusion and trampling of feet grew more frequent over his head; the vessel lay over more and more on her side, and went roaring through the waves, which banged and thumped at her as if in anger. All at once arose a terrible uproar. The hatch was blown off; a cold fierce wind swept in upon him; and a long arm came with it which laid hold of him and lifted him out. The same moment he saw the little vessel far below him righting herself. She had taken in all her sails and lay now tossing on the waves like a sea-bird with folded wings. A short distance to the south lay a much larger vessel, with two or three sails set, and towards it North Wind was carrying Diamond. It was a German ship, on its way to the North Pole.",last have idea seem fall asleep sleep hear sound go length weather seem get bad confusion trampling foot grow frequent head vessel lay more more side go roar wave bang thump anger arise terrible uproar hatch blow cold fierce wind sweep long arm come lay hold lift same moment see little vessel right take sail lay toss wave sea bird fold wing short distance south lay large vessel sail set carry german ship way

120,"She managed to hide him amongst the flags of the big ship, which were all snugly stowed away, and on and on they sped towards the north. At length one night she whispered in his ear, “Come on deck, Diamond;” and he got up at once and crept on deck. Everything looked very strange. Here and there on all sides were huge masses of floating ice, looking like cathedrals, and castles, and crags, while away beyond was a blue sea.",manage hide flag big ship stow spe north length night whisper ear come deck get creep deck look strange side huge mass float ice look cathedral castle crag blue sea

122,"“Neither or both, which you please. I can hardly tell which myself. If he is setting now, he will be rising the next moment.”",tell set rise next moment 
123,"“What a strange light it is!” said Diamond. “I have heard that the sun doesn’t go to bed all the summer in these parts. Miss Coleman told me that. I suppose he feels very sleepy, and that is why the light he sends out looks so like a dream.”",strange light say hear sun go bed summer part tell suppose feel sleepy light send look dream 
124,"“That will account for it well enough for all practical purposes,” said North Wind.",account practical purpose say 
125,"Some of the icebergs were drifting northwards; one was passing very near the ship. North Wind seized Diamond, and with a single bound lighted on one of them--a huge thing, with sharp pinnacles and great clefts. The same instant a wind began to blow from the south. North Wind hurried Diamond down the north side of the iceberg, stepping by its jags and splintering; for this berg had never got far enough south to be melted and smoothed by the summer sun. She brought him to a cave near the water, where she entered, and, letting Diamond go, sat down as if weary on a ledge of ice.",iceberg drift pass ship seize single bind light huge thing sharp pinnacle great cleft same instant wind begin blow south hurry north side iceberg step jag splinter berg get melt smooth summer sun bring cave water enter let go sit weary ledge ice 
126,"Diamond seated himself on the other side, and for a while was enraptured with the colour of the air inside the cave. It was a deep, dazzling, lovely blue, deeper than the deepest blue of the sky. The blue seemed to be in constant motion, like the blackness when you press your eyeballs with your fingers, boiling and sparkling. But when he looked across to North Wind he was frightened; her face was worn and livid.",seat other side while enrapture colour air cave deep dazzling lovely blue deep deep blue sky blue seem constant motion blackness press eyeball finger boil sparkling look frighten face wear livid 
127,"“What is the matter with you, dear North Wind?” he said.",matter dear say 
128,"“Nothing much. I feel very faint. But you mustn’t mind it, for I can bear it quite well. South Wind always blows me faint. If it were not for the cool of the thick ice between me and her, I should faint altogether. Indeed, as it is, I fear I must vanish.”",much feel faint mind bear blow faint cool thick ice faint fear vanish 
129,"Diamond stared at her in terror, for he saw that her form and face were growing, not small, but transparent, like something dissolving, not in water, but in light. He could see the side of the blue cave through her very heart. And she melted away till all that was left was a pale face, like the moon in the morning, with two great lucid eyes in it.",stare terror see form face grow small transparent dissolve water light see side blue cave very heart melt leave pale face moon morning great lucid eye

131,“Does it hurt you?” asked Diamond.,hurt ask 
132,"“It’s very uncomfortable,” she answered; “but I don’t mind it, for I shall come all right again before long. I thought I should be able to go with you all the way, but I cannot. You must not be frightened though. Just go straight on, and you will come all right. You’ll find me on the doorstep.”",uncomfortable answer mind come think able go way frighten go come right find doorstep 
133,"As she spoke, her face too faded quite away, only Diamond thought he could still see her eyes shining through the blue. When he went closer, however, he found that what he thought her eyes were only two hollows in the ice. North Wind was quite gone; and Diamond would have cried, if he had not trusted her so thoroughly. So he sat still in the blue air of the cavern listening to the wash and ripple of the water all about the base of the iceberg, as it sped on and on into the open sea northwards. It was an excellent craft to go with the current, for there was twice as much of it below water as above. But a light south wind was blowing too, and so it went fast.",speak face fade think see eye shine blue go close find think eye hollow ice gone cry trust sit blue air cavern listen wash ripple water base iceberg spe open sea excellent craft go current be much water light south wind blow go 
134,"After a little while Diamond went out and sat on the edge of his floating island, and looked down into the ocean beneath him. The white sides of the berg reflected so much light below the water, that he could see far down into the green abyss. Sometimes he fancied he saw the eyes of North Wind looking up at him from below, but the fancy never lasted beyond the moment of its birth. And the time passed he did not know how, for he felt as if he were in a dream. When he got tired of the green water, he went into the blue cave; and when he got tired of the blue cave he went out and gazed all about him on the blue sea, ever sparkling in the sun, which kept wheeling about the sky, never going below the horizon. But he chiefly gazed northwards, to see whether any land were appearing. All this time he never wanted to eat. He broke off little bits of the berg now and then and sucked them, and he thought them very nice.",little go sit edge float island look ocean white side berg reflect much light water see green abyss fancy see eye look fancy last moment birth time pass know feel dream get tired green water go blue cave get tired blue cave go gaze blue sea sparkling sun keep wheel sky go horizon gaze see land appear time want eat break little bit berg suck think nice 
135,"At length, one time he came out of his cave, he spied far off on the horizon, a shining peak that rose into the sky like the top of some tremendous iceberg; and his vessel was bearing him straight towards it. As it went on the peak rose and rose higher and higher above the horizon; and other peaks rose after it, with sharp edges and jagged ridges connecting them. Diamond thought this must be the place he was going to; and he was right; for the mountains rose and rose, till he saw the line of the coast at their feet and at length the iceberg drove into a little bay, all around which were lofty precipices with snow on their tops, and streaks of ice down their sides. The berg floated slowly up to a projecting rock. Diamond stepped on shore, and without looking behind him began to follow a natural path which led windingly towards the top of the precipice.",length time come cave spy horizon shine peak rise sky top tremendous iceberg vessel bear go peak rise rise high high horizon other peak rise sharp edge jagge ridge connect think place go right mountain rise rise see line coast foot length iceberg drive little bay lofty precipice snow top streak ice side berg float project rock step shore look begin follow natural path lead top precipice 
136,"When he reached it, he found himself on a broad table of ice, along which he could walk without much difficulty. Before him, at a considerable distance, rose a lofty ridge of ice, which shot up into fantastic pinnacles and towers and battlements. The air was very cold, and seemed somehow dead, for there was not the slightest breath of wind.",reach find broad table ice walk much difficulty considerable distance rise lofty ridge ice shoot fantastic pinnacle tower battlement air cold seem dead be slight breath wind 
137,"In the centre of the ridge before him appeared a gap like the opening of a valley. But as he walked towards it, gazing, and wondering whether that could be the way he had to take, he saw that what had appeared a gap was the form of a woman seated against the ice front of the ridge, leaning forwards with her hands in her lap, and her hair hanging down to the ground.",centre ridge appear gap opening valley walk gaze wonder way have take see appear gap form woman seat ice front ridge lean forward hand lap hair hang ground 
138,"“It is North Wind on her doorstep,” said Diamond joyfully, and hurried on.",doorstep say hurry 
139,"He soon came up to the place, and there the form sat, like one of the great figures at the door of an Egyptian temple, motionless, with drooping arms and head. Then Diamond grew frightened, because she did not move nor speak. He was sure it was North Wind, but he thought she must be dead at last. Her face was white as the snow, her eyes were blue as the air in the ice-cave, and her hair hung down straight, like icicles. She had on a greenish robe, like the colour in the hollows of a glacier seen from far off.",come place form sit great figure door egyptian temple motionless droop arm head grow frighten move speak sure think dead last face white snow eye blue air ice cave hair hang straight icicle have greenish robe colour hollow glacier see 
140,"He stood up before her, and gazed fearfully into her face for a few minutes before he ventured to speak. At length, with a great effort and a trembling voice, he faltered out--",stand gaze face few minute venture speak length great effort tremble voice falter

158,"“Do it,” said North Wind.",do say 
159,"Diamond walked towards her instantly. When he reached her knees, he put out his hand to lay it on her, but nothing was there save an intense cold. He walked on. Then all grew white about him; and the cold stung him like fire. He walked on still, groping through the whiteness. It thickened about him. At last, it got into his heart, and he lost all sense. I would say that he fainted--only whereas in common faints all grows black about you, he felt swallowed up in whiteness. It was when he reached North Wind’s heart that he fainted and fell. But as he fell, he rolled over the threshold, and it was thus that Diamond got to the back of the north wind.",walk reach knee put hand lay save intense cold walk grow white cold st fire walk grope whiteness thicken last get heart lose sense say faint common faint grow black feel swallow whiteness reach heart faint fall fall roll threshold get back north wind
