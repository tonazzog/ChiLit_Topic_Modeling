1,CHAPTER XIV. THE LAST STAND OF THE GREYS,last stand grey 
2,"In a few more minutes the regiments destined to carry out the flanking movements had tramped off in silence, keeping carefully to the lee of the rising ground in order to conceal their advance from the keen eyes of Twala's scouts.",few more minute regiment destine carry flanking movement tramp silence keep lee rise ground order conceal advance keen eye scout 
3,"Half an hour or more was allowed to elapse between the setting out of the horns or wings of the army before any stir was made by the Greys and their supporting regiment, known as the Buffaloes, which formed its chest, and were destined to bear the brunt of the battle.",hour more allow elapse setting horn wing army stir make support regiment know form chest destine bear brunt battle 
4,"Both of these regiments were almost perfectly fresh, and of full strength, the Greys having been in reserve in the morning, and having lost but a small number of men in sweeping back that part of the attack which had proved successful in breaking the line of defence, on the occasion when I charged with them and was stunned for my pains. As for the Buffaloes, they had formed the third line of defence on the left, and since the attacking force at that point had not succeeded in breaking through the second, they had scarcely come into action at all.",regiment fresh full strength reserve morning lose small number man sweep back part attack prove successful break line defence occasion charge stunn pain form third line defence left attack force point succeed break second come action 
5,"Infadoos, who was a wary old general, and knew the absolute importance of keeping up the spirits of his men on the eve of such a desperate encounter, employed the pause in addressing his own regiment, the Greys, in poetical language: explaining to them the honour that they were receiving in being put thus in the forefront of the battle, and in having the great white warrior from the Stars to fight with them in their ranks; and promising large rewards of cattle and promotion to all who survived in the event of Ignosi's arms being successful.",wary old general know absolute importance keep spirit man eve desperate encounter employ pause address own regiment poetical language explain honour receive put forefront battle have great white warrior fight rank promise large reward cattle promotion survive event arm successful 
6,"I looked down the long lines of waving black plumes and stern faces beneath them, and sighed to think that within one short hour most, if not all, of those magnificent veteran warriors, not a man of whom was under forty years of age, would be laid dead or dying in the dust. It could not be otherwise; they were being condemned, with that wise recklessness of human life which marks the great general, and often saves his forces and attains his ends, to certain slaughter, in order to give their cause and the remainder of the army a chance of success. They were foredoomed to die, and they knew the truth. It was to be their task to engage regiment after regiment of Twala's army on the narrow strip of green beneath us, till they were exterminated or till the wings found a favourable opportunity for their onslaught. And yet they never hesitated, nor could I detect a sign of fear upon the face of a single warrior. There they were--going to certain death, about to quit the blessed light of day for ever, and yet able to contemplate their doom without a tremor. Even at that moment I could not help contrasting their state of mind with my own, which was far from comfortable, and breathing a sigh of envy and admiration. Never before had I seen such an absolute devotion to the idea of duty, and such a complete indifference to its bitter fruits.",look long line wave black plume stern face sigh think short hour most magnificent veteran warrior man year age lay dead die dust condemn wise recklessness human life mark great general save force attain end certain slaughter order give cause remainder army chance success foredoom die know truth task engage regiment regiment army narrow strip green exterminate wing find favourable opportunity onslaught hesitate detect sign fear face single warrior go certain death quit bless light day able contemplate doom tremor moment help contrast state mind own comfortable breathe sigh envy admiration see absolute devotion idea duty complete indifference bitter fruit 
7,"""Behold your king!"" ended old Infadoos, pointing to Ignosi; ""go fight and fall for him, as is the duty of brave men, and cursed and shameful for ever be the name of him who shrinks from death for his king, or who turns his back to the foe. Behold your king, chiefs, captains, and soldiers! Now do your homage to the sacred Snake, and then follow on, that Incubu and I may show you a road to the heart of Twala's host.""",behold king end old point go fight fall duty brave man curse shameful name shrink death king turn back foe behold king chief captain soldier do homage sacred snake follow show road heart host 
8,"There was a moment's pause, then suddenly a murmur arose from the serried phalanxes before us, a sound like the distant whisper of the sea, caused by the gentle tapping of the handles of six thousand spears against their holders' shields. Slowly it swelled, till its growing volume deepened and widened into a roar of rolling noise, that echoed like thunder against the mountains, and filled the air with heavy waves of sound. Then it decreased, and by faint degrees died away into nothing, and suddenly out crashed the royal salute.",be moment pause murmur arise serry phalanxe sound distant whisper sea cause gentle tapping handle spear holder shield swell grow volume deepen widen roar roll noise echoe thunder mountain fill air heavy wave sound decrease faint degree die crash royal salute

10,"Ignosi acknowledged this magnificent act of homage by lifting his battle-axe, and then the Greys filed off in a triple-line formation, each line containing about one thousand fighting men, exclusive of officers. When the last companies had advanced some five hundred yards, Ignosi put himself at the head of the Buffaloes, which regiment was drawn up in a similar three-fold formation, and gave the word to march, and off we went, I, needless to say, uttering the most heartfelt prayers that I might emerge from that entertainment with a whole skin. Many a queer position have I found myself in, but never before in one quite so unpleasant as the present, or one in which my chance of coming off safe was smaller.",acknowledge magnificent act homage lift battle axe file triple line formation line contain fighting man exclusive officer last company advance yard put head regiment draw similar fold formation give word march go needless say utter heartfelt prayer emerge entertainment whole skin many queer position find unpleasant present chance come safe small 
11,"By the time that we reached the edge of the plateau the Greys were already half-way down the slope ending in the tongue of grass land that ran up into the bend of the mountain, something as the frog of a horse's foot runs up into the shoe. The excitement in Twala's camp on the plain beyond was very great, and regiment after regiment was starting forward at a long swinging trot in order to reach the root of the tongue of land before the attacking force could emerge into the plain of Loo.",time reach edge plateau half slope end tongue grass land run bend mountain frog horse foot run shoe excitement camp plain great regiment regiment start long swing trot order reach root tongue land attack force emerge plain 
12,"This tongue, which was some four hundred yards in depth, even at its root or widest part was not more than six hundred and fifty paces across, while at its tip it scarcely measured ninety. The Greys, who, in passing down the side of the hill and on to the tip of the tongue, had formed into a column, on reaching the spot where it broadened out again, reassumed their triple-line formation, and halted dead.",tongue yard depth root wide part more pace tip measure pass side hill tip tongue form column reach spot broaden reassume triple line formation halt dead 
13,"Then we--that is, the Buffaloes--moved down the tip of the tongue and took our stand in reserve, about one hundred yards behind the last line of the Greys, and on slightly higher ground. Meanwhile we had leisure to observe Twala's entire force, which evidently had been reinforced since the morning attack, and could not now, notwithstanding their losses, number less than forty thousand, moving swiftly up towards us. But as they drew near the root of the tongue they hesitated, having discovered that only one regiment could advance into the gorge at a time, and that there, some seventy yards from the mouth of it, unassailable except in front, on account of the high walls of boulder-strewn ground on each side, stood the famous regiment of Greys, the pride and glory of the Kukuana army, ready to hold the way against their power as the three Romans once held the bridge against thousands.",move tip tongue take stand reserve yard last line high ground have leisure observe entire force reinforce morning attack notwithstand loss number less move draw root tongue hesitate discover regiment advance gorge time yard mouth unassailable front account high wall boulder strewn ground side stand famous regiment pride glory army ready hold way power hold bridge thousand 
14,"They hesitated, and finally stopped their advance; there was no eagerness to cross spears with these three grim ranks of warriors who stood so firm and ready. Presently, however, a tall general, wearing the customary head-dress of nodding ostrich plumes, appeared, attended by a group of chiefs and orderlies, being, I thought, none other than Twala himself. He gave an order, and the first regiment, raising a shout, charged up towards the Greys, who remained perfectly still and silent till the attacking troops were within forty yards, and a volley of _tollas_, or throwing-knives, came rattling among their ranks.",hesitate stop advance be eagerness cross spear grim rank warrior stand firm ready tall general wear customary head dress nodd ostrich plume appear attend group chief orderly think other give order first regiment raise shout charge remain silent attack troops yard volley _tollas_ throw knife come rattling rank 
15,"Then suddenly with a bound and a roar, they sprang forward with uplifted spears, and the regiment met in deadly strife. Next second the roll of the meeting shields came to our ears like the sound of thunder, and the plain seemed to be alive with flashes of light reflected from the shimmering spears. To and fro swung the surging mass of struggling, stabbing humanity, but not for long. Suddenly the attacking lines began to grow thinner, and then with a slow, long heave the Greys passed over them, just as a great wave heaves up its bulk and passes over a sunken ridge. It was done; that regiment was completely destroyed, but the Greys had but two lines left now; a third of their number were dead.",bind roar spring uplift spear regiment meet deadly strife next second roll meeting shield come ear sound thunder plain seem alive flash light reflect shimmer spear swing surge mass struggle stabbing humanity long attack line begin grow thin slow long heave pass great wave heave bulk pass sink ridge do regiment destroy have line leave third number dead 
16,"Closing up shoulder to shoulder, once more they halted in silence and awaited attack; and I was rejoiced to catch sight of Sir Henry's yellow beard as he moved to and fro arranging the ranks. So he was yet alive!",close shoulder shoulder more halt silence await attack rejoice catch sight yellow beard move arrange rank alive 
17,"Meanwhile we moved on to the ground of the encounter, which was cumbered by about four thousand prostrate human beings, dead, dying, and wounded, and literally stained red with blood. Ignosi issued an order, which was rapidly passed down the ranks, to the effect that none of the enemy's wounded were to be killed, and so far as we could see this command was scrupulously carried out. It would have been a shocking sight, if we had found time to think of such things.",move ground encounter cumber prostrate human being dead die wound stain red blood issue order pass rank effect enemy wound kill see command carry shocking sight find time think such thing 
18,"But now a second regiment, distinguished by white plumes, kilts, and shields, was moving to the attack of the two thousand remaining Greys, who stood waiting in the same ominous silence as before, till the foe was within forty yards or so, when they hurled themselves with irresistible force upon them. Again there came the awful roll of the meeting shields, and as we watched the tragedy repeated itself.",second regiment distinguish white plume kilt shield move attack remain stand wait same ominous silence foe yard hurl irresistible force come awful roll meeting shield watch tragedy repeat 
19,"But this time the issue was left longer in doubt; indeed, it seemed for awhile almost impossible that the Greys should again prevail. The attacking regiment, which was formed of young men, fought with the utmost fury, and at first seemed by sheer weight to be driving the veterans back. The slaughter was truly awful, hundreds falling every minute; and from among the shouts of the warriors and the groans of the dying, set to the music of clashing spears, came a continuous hissing undertone of ""_S'gee, s'gee_,"" the note of triumph of each victor as he passed his assegai through and through the body of his fallen foe.",time issue leave doubt seem impossible prevail attack regiment form young man fight utmost fury seem sheer weight drive veteran slaughter awful hundred fall minute shout warrior groan die set music clash spear come continuous hissing undertone note triumph victor pass assegai body fall foe 
20,"But perfect discipline and steady and unchanging valour can do wonders, and one veteran soldier is worth two young ones, as soon became apparent in the present case. For just when we thought that it was all over with the Greys, and were preparing to take their place so soon as they made room by being destroyed, I heard Sir Henry's deep voice ringing out through the din, and caught a glimpse of his circling battle-axe as he waved it high above his plumes. Then came a change; the Greys ceased to give; they stood still as a rock, against which the furious waves of spearmen broke again and again, only to recoil. Presently they began to move once more--forward this time; as they had no firearms there was no smoke, so we could see it all. Another minute and the onslaught grew fainter.",perfect discipline steady unchanging valour do wonder veteran soldier worth young one become apparent present case think prepare take place make room destroy hear deep voice ring din catch glimpse circle battle axe wave plume come change cease give stand rock furious wave spearmen break recoil begin move more time have firearm be smoke see minute onslaught grow fainter 
21,"""Ah, these are _men_, indeed; they will conquer again,"" called out Ignosi, who was grinding his teeth with excitement at my side. ""See, it is done!""",conquer call grind tooth excitement side see do 
22,"Suddenly, like puffs of smoke from the mouth of a cannon, the attacking regiment broke away in flying groups, their white head-dresses streaming behind them in the wind, and left their opponents victors, indeed, but, alas! no more a regiment. Of the gallant triple line, which forty minutes before had gone into action three thousand strong, there remained at most some six hundred blood-spattered men; the rest were under foot. And yet they cheered and waved their spears in triumph, and then, instead of falling back upon us as we expected, they ran forward, for a hundred yards or so, after the flying groups of foemen, took possession of a rising knoll of ground, and, resuming their triple formation, formed a threefold ring around its base. And there, thanks be to Heaven, standing on the top of the mound for a minute, I saw Sir Henry, apparently unharmed, and with him our old friend Infadoos. Then Twala's regiments rolled down upon the doomed band, and once more the battle closed in.",puff smoke mouth cannon attack regiment break fly group white head dress stream wind leave opponent victor regiment gallant triple line minute go action strong remain most blood spatter man rest foot cheer wave spear triumph fall expect run yard fly group foemen take possession rise knoll ground resume triple formation form threefold ring base thanks stand top mound minute see unharmed old friend regiment roll doom band battle close 
23,"As those who read this history will probably long ago have gathered, I am, to be honest, a bit of a coward, and certainly in no way given to fighting, though somehow it has often been my lot to get into unpleasant positions, and to be obliged to shed man's blood. But I have always hated it, and kept my own blood as undiminished in quantity as possible, sometimes by a judicious use of my heels. At this moment, however, for the first time in my life, I felt my bosom burn with martial ardour. Warlike fragments from the ""Ingoldsby Legends,"" together with numbers of sanguinary verses in the Old Testament, sprang up in my brain like mushrooms in the dark; my blood, which hitherto had been half-frozen with horror, went beating through my veins, and there came upon me a savage desire to kill and spare not. I glanced round at the serried ranks of warriors behind us, and somehow, all in an instant, I began to wonder if my face looked like theirs. There they stood, the hands twitching, the lips apart, the fierce features instinct with the hungry lust of battle, and in the eyes a look like the glare of a bloodhound when after long pursuit he sights his quarry.",read history gather honest bit coward way give fighting lot get unpleasant position oblige shed man blood hate keep own blood undiminished quantity possible judicious use heel moment first time life feel bosom burn martial ardour warlike fragment number sanguinary verse old spring brain mushroom dark blood half freeze horror go beat vein come savage desire kill spare glance serried rank warrior instant begin wonder face look stand hand twitch lip fierce feature instinct hungry lust battle eye look glare bloodhound long pursuit sight quarry 
24,"Only Ignosi's heart, to judge from his comparative self-possession, seemed, to all appearances, to beat as calmly as ever beneath his leopard-skin cloak, though even _he_ still ground his teeth. I could bear it no longer.",heart judge comparative self possession seem appearance beat leopard skin cloak _he_ ground tooth bear

27,"As he spoke a fresh regiment rushed past the ring upon the little mound, and wheeling round, attacked it from the hither side.",speak fresh regiment rush ring little mound wheeling attack hither side 
28,"Then, lifting his battle-axe, Ignosi gave the signal to advance, and, screaming the wild Kukuana war-cry, the Buffaloes charged home with a rush like the rush of the sea.",lift battle axe give signal advance scream wild war cry charge rush rush sea 
29,"What followed immediately on this it is out of my power to tell. All I can remember is an irregular yet ordered advance, that seemed to shake the ground; a sudden change of front and forming up on the part of the regiment against which the charge was directed; then an awful shock, a dull roar of voices, and a continuous flashing of spears, seen through a red mist of blood.",follow power tell remember irregular order advance seem shake ground sudden change front form part regiment charge direct awful shock dull roar voice continuous flash spear see red mist blood 
30,"When my mind cleared I found myself standing inside the remnant of the Greys near the top of the mound, and just behind no less a person than Sir Henry himself. How I got there I had at the moment no idea, but Sir Henry afterwards told me that I was borne up by the first furious charge of the Buffaloes almost to his feet, and then left, as they in turn were pressed back. Thereon he dashed out of the circle and dragged me into shelter.",mind clear find stand remnant top mound person get have moment idea tell borne first furious charge foot leave turn press thereon dash circle drag shelter

34,"It was a splendid thing to see those brave battalions come on time after time over the barriers of their dead, sometimes lifting corpses before them to receive our spear-thrusts, only to leave their own corpses to swell the rising piles. It was a gallant sight to see that old warrior, Infadoos, as cool as though he were on parade, shouting out orders, taunts, and even jests, to keep up the spirit of his few remaining men, and then, as each charge rolled on, stepping forward to wherever the fighting was thickest, to bear his share in its repulse. And yet more gallant was the vision of Sir Henry, whose ostrich plumes had been shorn off by a spear thrust, so that his long yellow hair streamed out in the breeze behind him. There he stood, the great Dane, for he was nothing else, his hands, his axe, and his armour all red with blood, and none could live before his stroke. Time after time I saw it sweeping down, as some great warrior ventured to give him battle, and as he struck he shouted ""_O-hoy! O-hoy!_"" like his Berserkir forefathers, and the blow went crashing through shield and spear, through head-dress, hair, and skull, till at last none would of their own will come near the great white ""_umtagati_,"" the wizard, who killed and failed not.",splendid thing see brave battalion come time time barrier dead lift corpse receive spear thrust leave own corpse swell rise pile gallant sight see old warrior cool parade shouting order taunt jest keep spirit few remain man charge roll step fighting thickest bear share repulse more gallant vision ostrich plume shorn spear thrust long yellow hair stream breeze stand great else hand axe armour red blood live stroke time time see sweep great warrior venture give battle strike shout forefather blow go crash shield spear head dress hair skull last own come great white wizard kill fail

36,"""Where art thou, Incubu, thou white man, who slewest Scragga my son--see if thou canst slay me!"" he shouted, and at the same time hurled a _tolla_ straight at Sir Henry, who fortunately saw it coming, and caught it on his shield, which it transfixed, remaining wedged in the iron plate behind the hide.",art white man slewest son-- see slay shout same time hurl _tolla_ see come catch shield transfixe remain wedge iron plate hide

38,"But at this time the matter went no further, for that instant there rose from the regiments pressing round us something like a shout of dismay, and on looking up I saw the cause.",time matter go instant rise regiment press shout dismay look see cause 
39,"To the right and to the left the plain was alive with the plumes of charging warriors. The outflanking squadrons had come to our relief. The time could not have been better chosen. All Twala's army, as Ignosi predicted would be the case, had fixed their attention on the bloody struggle which was raging round the remnant of the Greys and that of the Buffaloes, who were now carrying on a battle of their own at a little distance, which two regiments had formed the chest of our army. It was not until our horns were about to close upon them that they had dreamed of their approach, for they believed these forces to be hidden in reserve upon the crest of the moon-shaped hill. And now, before they could even assume a proper formation for defence, the outflanking _Impis_ had leapt, like greyhounds, on their flanks.",right left plain alive plume charging warrior outflanking squadron come relief time choose army predict case fix attention bloody struggle rage remnant carry battle own little distance regiment form chest army horn about close dream approach believe force hide reserve crest moon shape hill assume proper formation defence outflanking leapt greyhound flank 
40,"In five minutes the fate of the battle was decided. Taken on both flanks, and dismayed at the awful slaughter inflicted upon them by the Greys and Buffaloes, Twala's regiments broke into flight, and soon the whole plain between us and Loo was scattered with groups of running soldiers making good their retreat. As for the hosts that had so recently surrounded us and the Buffaloes, they melted away as though by magic, and presently we were left standing there like a rock from which the sea has retreated. But what a sight it was! Around us the dead and dying lay in heaped-up masses, and of the gallant Greys there remained but ninety-five men upon their feet. More than three thousand four hundred had fallen in this one regiment, most of them never to rise again.",minute fate battle decide take flank dismay awful slaughter inflict regiment break flight whole plain scatter group run soldier make good retreat host surround melt magic leave stand rock sea retreat sight dead die lay heap mass gallant remain man foot more fall regiment most rise 
41,"""Men,"" said Infadoos calmly, as between the intervals of binding a wound on his arm he surveyed what remained to him of his corps, ""ye have kept up the reputation of your regiment, and this day's fighting will be well spoken of by your children's children."" Then he turned round and shook Sir Henry Curtis by the hand.

42,"At this moment the Buffaloes began to march past our position on the road to Loo, and as they went a message was brought to us from Ignosi requesting Infadoos, Sir Henry, and myself to join them. Accordingly, orders having been issued to the remaining ninety men of the Greys to employ themselves in collecting the wounded, we joined Ignosi, who informed us that he was pressing on to Loo to complete the victory by capturing Twala, if that should be possible. Before we had gone far, suddenly we discovered the figure of Good sitting on an ant-heap about one hundred paces from us. Close beside him was the body of a Kukuana.",moment begin march position road go message bring request join order issue remain man employ collect wound join inform press complete victory capture possible go discover figure sit ant heap pace close body 
43,"""He must be wounded,"" said Sir Henry anxiously. As he made the remark, an untoward thing happened. The dead body of the Kukuana soldier, or rather what had appeared to be his dead body, suddenly sprang up, knocked Good head over heels off the ant-heap, and began to spear him. We rushed forward in terror, and as we drew near we saw the brawny warrior making dig after dig at the prostrate Good, who at each prod jerked all his limbs into the air. Seeing us coming, the Kukuana gave one final and most vicious dig, and with a shout of ""Take that, wizard!"" bolted away. Good did not move, and we concluded that our poor comrade was done for. Sadly we came towards him, and were astonished to find him pale and faint indeed, but with a serene smile upon his face, and his eyeglass still fixed in his eye.",wound say make remark untoward thing happen dead body soldier appear dead body spring knock good head heel ant heap begin spear rush terror draw see brawny warrior make dig dig prostrate prod jerk limb air see come give final vicious dig shout take wizard bolt good move conclude poor comrade do come astonished find pale faint serene smile face eyeglass fix eye 
44,"""Capital armour this,"" he murmured, on catching sight of our faces bending over him. ""How sold that beggar must have been,"" and then he fainted. On examination we discovered that he had been seriously wounded in the leg by a _tolla_ in the course of the pursuit, but that the chain armour had prevented his last assailant's spear from doing anything more than bruise him badly. It was a merciful escape. As nothing could be done for him at the moment, he was placed on one of the wicker shields used for the wounded, and carried along with us.",capital armour murmure catching sight face bending sell beggar faint examination discover wound leg _tolla_ course pursuit chain armour prevent last assailant spear do more bruise merciful escape do moment place wicker shield use wound carry 
45,"On arriving before the nearest gate of Loo we found one of our regiments watching it in obedience to orders received from Ignosi. The other regiments were in the same way guarding the different exits to the town. The officer in command of this regiment saluted Ignosi as king, and informed him that Twala's army had taken refuge in the town, whither Twala himself had also escaped, but he thought that they were thoroughly demoralised, and would surrender. Thereupon Ignosi, after taking counsel with us, sent forward heralds to each gate ordering the defenders to open, and promising on his royal word life and forgiveness to every soldier who laid down his arms, but saying that if they did not do so before nightfall he would certainly burn the town and all within its gates. This message was not without its effect. Half an hour later, amid the shouts and cheers of the Buffaloes, the bridge was dropped across the fosse, and the gates upon the further side were flung open.",arrive near gate find regiment watch obedience order receive other regiment same way guard different exit town officer command regiment salute king inform army take refuge town escape think demoralise surrender take counsel send forward herald gate order defender open promise royal word life forgiveness soldier lay arm say do nightfall burn town gate message effect hour shout cheer bridge drop fosse gate further side flung open 
46,"Taking due precautions against treachery, we marched on into the town. All along the roadways stood thousands of dejected warriors, their heads drooping, and their shields and spears at their feet, who, headed by their officers, saluted Ignosi as king as he passed. On we marched, straight to Twala's kraal. When we reached the great space, where a day or two previously we had seen the review and the witch hunt, we found it deserted. No, not quite deserted, for there, on the further side, in front of his hut, sat Twala himself, with but one attendant--Gagool.",take due precaution treachery march town roadway stand thousand dejected warrior head droop shield spear foot head officer salute king pass march kraal reach great space day see review witch hunt find desert desert further side front hut sit attendant 
47,"It was a melancholy sight to see him seated, his battle-axe and shield by his side, his chin upon his mailed breast, with but one old crone for companion, and notwithstanding his crimes and misdeeds, a pang of compassion shot through me as I looked upon Twala thus ""fallen from his high estate."" Not a soldier of all his armies, not a courtier out of the hundreds who had cringed round him, not even a solitary wife, remained to share his fate or halve the bitterness of his fall. Poor savage! he was learning the lesson which Fate teaches to most of us who live long enough, that the eyes of mankind are blind to the discredited, and that he who is defenceless and fallen finds few friends and little mercy.

48,"Filing through the kraal gate, we marched across the open space to where the ex-king sat. When within about fifty yards of him the regiment was halted, and accompanied only by a small guard we advanced towards him, Gagool reviling us bitterly as we came. As we drew near, Twala, for the first time, lifted his plumed head, and fixed his one eye, which seemed to flash with suppressed fury almost as brightly as the great diamond bound round his forehead, upon his successful rival--Ignosi.",file kraal gate march open space ex-king sit yard regiment halt accompany small guard advance revile come draw first time lift plumed head fix eye seem flash suppress fury great diamond bind forehead successful rival

What chance should I have against a desperate savage six feet five high, and broad in proportion? I might as well commit suicide at once.

66,"The ex-king laughed savagely, and stepping forward faced Curtis. For a moment they stood thus, and the light of the sinking sun caught their stalwart frames and clothed them both in fire. They were a well-matched pair.",ex-king laugh step face moment stand light sinking sun catch stalwart frame cloth fire match pair 
67,"Then they began to circle round each other, their battle-axes raised.",begin circle other battle axe raise 
68,"Suddenly Sir Henry sprang forward and struck a fearful blow at Twala, who stepped to one side. So heavy was the stroke that the striker half overbalanced himself, a circumstance of which his antagonist took a prompt advantage. Circling his massive battle-axe round his head, he brought it down with tremendous force. My heart jumped into my mouth; I thought that the affair was already finished. But no; with a quick upward movement of the left arm Sir Henry interposed his shield between himself and the axe, with the result that its outer edge was shorn away, the axe falling on his left shoulder, but not heavily enough to do any serious damage. In another moment Sir Henry got in a second blow, which was also received by Twala upon his shield.",spring strike fearful blow step side heavy stroke striker half overbalance circumstance antagonist take prompt advantage circle massive battle axe head bring tremendous force heart jump mouth think affair finish quick upward movement left arm interpose shield axe result outer edge shorn axe fall left shoulder do serious damage moment get second blow receive shield 
69,"Then followed blow upon blow, that were, in turn, either received upon the shields or avoided. The excitement grew intense; the regiment which was watching the encounter forgot its discipline, and, drawing near, shouted and groaned at every stroke. Just at this time, too, Good, who had been laid upon the ground by me, recovered from his faint, and, sitting up, perceived what was going on. In an instant he was up, and catching hold of my arm, hopped about from place to place on one leg, dragging me after him, and yelling encouragements to Sir Henry--",follow blow blow turn receive shield avoid excitement grow intense regiment watch encounter forget discipline draw shout groan stroke time good lay ground recover faint sit perceive go instant catching hold arm hopp place place leg drag yell encouragement

71,"Presently Sir Henry, having caught a fresh stroke upon his shield, hit out with all his force. The blow cut through Twala's shield and through the tough chain armour behind it, gashing him in the shoulder. With a yell of pain and fury Twala returned the blow with interest, and, such was his strength, shore right through the rhinoceros' horn handle of his antagonists battle-axe, strengthened as it was with bands of steel, wounding Curtis in the face.",catch fresh stroke shield hit force blow cut shield tough chain armour gash shoulder yell pain fury return blow interest such strength shore rhinocero horn handle antagonist battle axe strengthen band steel wound face 
72,"A cry of dismay rose from the Buffaloes as our hero's broad axe-head fell to the ground; and Twala, again raising his weapon, flew at him with a shout. I shut my eyes. When I opened them again it was to see Sir Henry's shield lying on the ground, and Sir Henry himself with his great arms twined round Twala's middle. To and fro they swung, hugging each other like bears, straining with all their mighty muscles for dear life, and dearer honour. With a supreme effort Twala swung the Englishman clean off his feet, and down they came together, rolling over and over on the lime paving, Twala striking out at Curtis' head with the battle-axe, and Sir Henry trying to drive the _tolla_ he had drawn from his belt through Twala's armour.",cry dismay rise hero broad axe head fall ground raise weapon fly shout shut eye open see shield lie ground great arm twin middle swing hug other bear strain mighty muscle dear life dearer honour supreme effort swing clean foot come roll lime pave strike head battle axe try drive _tolla_ draw belt armour

75,"At any rate, dropping the _tolla_, he snatched at the axe, which was fastened to Twala's wrist by a strip of buffalo hide, and still rolling over and over, they fought for it like wild cats, drawing their breath in heavy gasps. Suddenly the hide string burst, and then, with a great effort, Sir Henry freed himself, the weapon remaining in his hand. Another second and he was upon his feet, the red blood streaming from the wound in his face, and so was Twala. Drawing the heavy _tolla_ from his belt, he reeled straight at Curtis and struck him in the breast. The stab came home true and strong, but whoever it was who made that chain armour, he understood his art, for it withstood the steel. Again Twala struck out with a savage yell, and again the sharp knife rebounded, and Sir Henry went staggering back. Once more Twala came on, and as he came our great Englishman gathered himself together, and swinging the big axe round his head with both hands, hit at him with all his force.",rate drop snatch axe fasten wrist strip buffalo hide roll fight wild cat draw breath heavy gasp hide string burst great effort free weapon remain hand second foot red blood stream wound face draw heavy _tolla_ belt reel strike breast stab come true strong make chain armour understand art withstood steel strike savage yell sharp knife rebound go staggering more come come great englishman gather swing big axe head hand hit force 
76,"There was a shriek of excitement from a thousand throats, and, behold! Twala's head seemed to spring from his shoulders: then it fell and came rolling and bounding along the ground towards Ignosi, stopping just at his feet. For a second the corpse stood upright; then with a dull crash it came to the earth, and the gold torque from its neck rolled away across the pavement. As it did so Sir Henry, overpowered by faintness and loss of blood, fell heavily across the body of the dead king.",be shriek excitement throat head seem spring shoulder fall come roll bound ground stop foot second corpse stand dull crash come earth gold torque neck roll pavement overpower faintness loss blood fall body dead king

Then advancing, he placed his foot upon the broad chest of his headless foe and broke out into a chant, or rather a pæan of triumph, so beautiful, and yet so utterly savage, that I despair of being able to give an adequate version of his words. Once I heard a scholar with a fine voice read aloud from the Greek poet Homer, and I remember that the sound of the rolling lines seemed to make my blood stand still. Ignosi's chant, uttered as it was in a language as beautiful and sonorous as the old Greek, produced exactly the same effect on me, although I was exhausted with toil and many emotions.",bind diadem brow advance place foot broad chest headless foe break chant pæan triumph beautiful savage despair able give adequate version word hear scholar fine voice read greek poet remember sound roll line seem make blood stand chant utter language beautiful sonorous old produce same effect exhaust toil many emotion
