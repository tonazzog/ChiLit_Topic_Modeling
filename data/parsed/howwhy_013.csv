So now you will have a chance of seeing something of the great sea outside, and of seeing, perhaps, the whale himself.",kind person come harbour last night offer take coast town sleep start morning have chance see great sea see whale

21,"That is very difficult for you and me to imagine, because we always think in words.  They must think in pictures, I suppose, by remembering things which have happened to them.  You and I do that in our dreams.  I suspect that savages, who have very few words to express their thoughts with, think in pictures, like their own dogs.  But that is a long story.

30,"What, that long bank of stones, with a house on it?",long bank stone house 
31,"That is no house.  That is a square lump of mud, the last remaining bit of earth which was once the moraine of a glacier.

He knows that it must be an old glacier moraine; and he has reason to think that moraine once stretched right across the bay to the low island, and perhaps on to the other shore, and was eaten out by the sea as the land sank down.",cliff cow feed make island loose earth stone bright green gray rock brown heather moor foot know old glacier moraine have reason think moraine stretch bay low island other shore eat sea land sink

You recollect the pictures of Christmas Sound and Possession Bay?",say certain say suppose be glacier sail end ice cliff such see picture fond recollect picture

But they will catch plenty of mackerel now; for where he is they are; and where they are, perhaps the whale will be; for we are now well outside the harbour, and running across the open bay; and lucky for you that there are no rollers coming in from the Atlantic, and spouting up those cliffs in columns of white foam.",find catch make boat smell glad throw save life nastiness catch plenty mackerel whale harbour run open bay lucky be roller come spout cliff column white foam

But while he is under, mind, the air in his lungs is getting foul, and full of carbonic acid, just as it would in your lungs, if you held your breath.  So he is forced to come up at last: and then out of his blowers, which are on the top of his head, he blasts out all the foul breath, and with it the water which has got into his mouth, in a cloud of spray.

283,I know.  But how are you going to get through the chalk hills?  Is there a tunnel as there is at Box and at Micheldever?,know go get chalk hill be tunnel be 
284,"No.  Something much prettier than a tunnel and something which took a great many years longer in making.  We shall soon meet with a very remarkable and famous old gentleman, who is a great adept at digging, and at landscape gardening likewise; and he has dug out a path for himself through the chalk, which we shall take the liberty of using also.  And his name, if you wish to know it, is Father Thames.",pretty tunnel take great many year make meet remarkable famous old gentleman great adept digg landscape gardening dig path chalk take liberty use name wish know 
285,I see him.  What a great river!,see great river 
286,"Yes.  Here he comes, gleaming and winding down from Oxford, over the lowlands, past Wallingford; but where he is going to it is not so easy to see.",come gleam wind lowland go easy see 
287,"Ah, here is chalk in the cutting at last.  And what a high bridge.  And the river far under our feet.  Why we are crossing him again!",chalk cutting last high bridge river foot cross 
288,Yes; he winds more sharply than a railroad can.  But is not this prettier than a tunnel?,wind railroad pretty tunnel 
289,"Oh, what hanging-woods, and churches; and such great houses, and pretty cottages and gardens--all in this narrow crack of a valley!",hanging wood church such great house pretty cottage garden narrow crack valley 
290,"Ay.  Old Father Thames is a good landscape gardener, as I said.  There is Basildon--and Hurley--and Pangbourne, with its roaring lasher.  Father Thames has had to work hard for many an age before he could cut this trench right through the chalk, and drain the water out of the flat vale behind us.  But I suspect the sea helped him somewhat, or perhaps a great deal, just where we are now.",old good landscape gardener say be roar lasher have work many age cut trench chalk drain water flat vale suspect sea help great deal 
291,The sea?,sea 
292,"Yes.  The sea was once--and that not so very long ago--right up here, beyond Reading.  This is the uppermost end of the great Thames valley, which must have been an estuary--a tide flat, like the mouth of the Severn, with the sea eating along at the foot of all the hills.  And if the land sunk only some fifty feet,--which is a very little indeed, child, in this huge, ever-changing world,--then the tide would come up to Reading again, and the greater part of London and the county of Middlesex be drowned in salt water.",sea uppermost end great valley estuary tide flat mouth sea eat foot hill land sink foot little child huge change world tide come great part county drown salt water 
293,How dreadful that would be!,dreadful 
294,"Dreadful indeed.  God grant that it may never happen.  More terrible changes of land and water have happened, and are happening still in the world: but none, I think, could happen which would destroy so much civilisation and be such a loss to mankind, as that the Thames valley should become again what it was, geologically speaking, only the other day, when these gravel banks, over which we are running to Reading, were being washed out of the chalk cliffs up above at every tide, and rolled on a beach, as you have seen them rolling still at Ramsgate.",dreadful grant happen terrible change land water happen happen world think happen destroy much civilisation loss mankind valley become speak other day gravel bank run wash chalk cliff tide roll beach see roll 
295,"Now here we are at Reading.  There is the carriage waiting, and away we are off home; and when we get home, and have seen everybody and everything, we will look over our section once more.",be carriage waiting home get see look section more 
296,"But remember, that when you ran through the chalk hills to Reading, you passed from the bottom of the chalk to the top of it, on to the Thames gravels, which lie there on the chalk, and on to the London clay, which lies on the chalk also, with the Thames gravels always over it.  So that, you see, the newest layers, the London clay and the gravels, are lower in height than the limestone cliffs at Bristol, and much lower than the old mountain ranges of Devonshire and Wales, though in geological order they are far higher; and there are whole worlds of strata, rocks and clays, one on the other, between the Thames gravels and the Devonshire hills.",remember run chalk hill pass bottom chalk top gravel lie chalk clay lie chalk gravel see new layer clay gravel low height limestone cliff low old mountain range geological order high be whole world strata rock clay other gravel hill 
297,"But how about our moors?  They are newer still, you said, than the London clay, because they lie upon it: and yet they are much higher than we are here at Reading.",moor new say clay lie high 
298,"Very well said: so they are, two or three hundred feet higher.  But our part of them was left behind, standing up in banks, while the valley of the Thames was being cut out by the sea.  Once they spread all over where we stand now, and away behind us beyond Newbury in Berkshire, and away in front of us, all over where London now stands.",say foot high part leave stand bank valley cut sea spread stand front stand 
299,How can you tell that?,tell 
300,"Because there are little caps--little patches--of them left on the tops of many hills to the north of London; just remnants which the sea, and the Thames, and the rain have not eaten down.  Probably they once stretched right out to sea, sloping slowly under the waves, where the mouth of the Thames is now.  You know the sand-cliffs at Bournemouth?",be little cap little patch leave top many hill north remnant sea rain eat stretch sea slope wave mouth know sand cliff 
301,Of course.,course 
302,"Then those are of the same age as the Bagshot sands, and lie on the London clay, and slope down off the New Forest into the sea, which eats them up, as you know, year by year and day by day.  And here were once perhaps cliffs just like them, where London Bridge now stands.",same age sand lie clay slope new sea eat know year year day day cliff stand

304,"There, we are rumbling away home at last, over the dear old heather-moors.  How far we have travelled--in our fancy at least--since we began to talk about all these things, upon the foggy November day, and first saw Madam How digging at the sand-banks with her water-spade.  How many countries we have talked of; and what wonderful questions we have got answered, which all grew out of the first question, How were the heather-moors made?  And yet we have not talked about a hundredth part of the things about which these very heather-moors ought to set us thinking. But so it is, child.  Those who wish honestly to learn the laws of Madam How, which we call Nature, by looking honestly at what she does, which we call Fact, have only to begin by looking at the very smallest thing, pin's head or pebble, at their feet, and it may lead them--whither, they cannot tell.  To answer any one question, you find you must answer another; and to answer that you must answer a third, and then a fourth; and so on for ever and ever.",rumble last dear old heather moor travel fancy least begin talk thing foggy day see digg sand bank water spade many country talk wonderful question answer grow first question heather moor make talk hundredth part thing heather moor set think child wish learn law call look do call have begin look small thing pin head pebble foot lead tell answer question find answer answer answer third fourth 
305,For ever and ever?,
306,"Of course.  If we thought and searched over the Universe--ay, I believe, only over this one little planet called earth--for millions on millions of years, we should not get to the end of our searching.  The more we learnt, the more we should find there was left to learn.  All things, we should find, are constituted according to a Divine and Wonderful Order, which links each thing to every other thing; so that we cannot fully comprehend any one thing without comprehending all things: and who can do that, save He who made all things?  Therefore our true wisdom is never to fancy that we do comprehend: never to make systems and theories of the Universe (as they are called) as if we had stood by and looked on when time and space began to be; but to remember that those who say they understand, show, simply by so saying, that they understand nothing at all; that those who say they see, are sure to be blind; while those who confess that they are blind, are sure some day to see.  All we can do is, to keep up the childlike heart, humble and teachable, though we grew as wise as Newton or as Humboldt; and to follow, as good Socrates bids us, Reason whithersoever it leads us, sure that it will never lead us wrong, unless we have darkened it by hasty and conceited fancies of our own, and so have become like those foolish men of old, of whom it was said that the very light within them was darkness.  But if we love and reverence and trust Fact and Nature, which are the will, not merely of Madam How, or even of Lady Why, but of Almighty God Himself, then we shall be really loving, and reverencing, and trusting God; and we shall have our reward by discovering continually fresh wonders and fresh benefits to man; and find it as true of science, as it is of this life and of the life to come--that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what God has prepared for those who love Him.",course think search believe little planet call earth million million year get end searching learn more find leave learn thing find constitute accord divine wonderful link thing other thing comprehend thing comprehend thing do save make thing true wisdom fancy comprehend make system theory call stand look time space begin remember say understand show say understand say see sure blind confess blind sure day see do keep childlike heart humble teachable grow wise follow good bid reason lead sure lead wrong darken hasty conceited fancy own become foolish man old say very light darkness love reverence trust will loving reverence trust have reward discover fresh wonder fresh benefit man find true science life life come eye see ear hear have enter heart man conceive prepare love
