5,"Finding no affirmative reply on Nurse's placid face, the small lips closed firmly--two dimples came and went on two very round cheeks--the mischievous brown eyes grew full of laughter, and the next moment the little questioner had squeezed her way through a slightly open door, and was toddling down the broad stone stairs and across a landing to Hetty's room.  The room door was open, so the truant went in.  A bed with the bedclothes all tossed about, a half worn-out slipper on the floor, a very untidy dressing-table met her eyes, but no Hetty.",find affirmative reply placid face small lip close dimple come go round cheek mischievous brown eye grow full laughter next moment little questioner squeeze way open door toddle broad stone stair landing room room door open truant go bed bedclothe toss half wear out slipper floor untidy dress table meet eye

24,"She gathered up her muff and gloves, and ran out of the little study where she had been making believe to eat breakfast.  A tall, stern-looking man was in the hall, buttoning on an overcoat; a brougham waited at the door.  The next moment Hester and her father were bowling away in the direction of the nearest railway station.  Nan's little chubby face had faded from view.  The old square grey house, sacred to Hester because of Nan, had also disappeared; the avenue even was past, and Hester closed her bright brown eyes.  She felt that she was being pushed out into a cold world, and was no longer in the same snug nest with Nan.  An intolerable pain was at her heart; she did not glance at her father, who during their entire drive occupied himself over his morning paper.  At last they reached the railway station, and just as Sir John Thornton was handing his daughter into a comfortable first-class carriage, marked ""For Ladies only,"" and was presenting her with her railway ticket and a copy of the last week's illustrated newspaper, he spoke--",gather muff glove run little study make believe eat breakfast tall stern look man hall button overcoat brougham wait door next moment father bowl direction near railway station little chubby face fade view old square grey house sacred disappear avenue past close bright brown eye feel push cold world same snug nest intolerable pain heart glance father entire drive occupy morning paper last reach railway station hand daughter comfortable first class carriage mark lady present railway ticket copy last week illustrate newspaper speak

This train takes you straight to Sefton, and Mrs Willis will meet you, or send for you there.  Good-bye, my love; try to be a good girl, and curb your wild spirits.
