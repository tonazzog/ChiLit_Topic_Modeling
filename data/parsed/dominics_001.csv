1,PREFACE.,preface 
2,"_The Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's_ is a story of public-school life, and was written for the _Boy's Own Paper_, in the Fourth Volume of which it appeared.  The numbers containing it are now either entirely out of print or difficult to obtain; and many and urgent have been the requests--from boys themselves, as well as from parents, head masters, and others--for its re-issue as a book.",fifth story public school life write own fourth appear number contain print difficult obtain many urgent request boy parent head master other re-issue book 
3,"Of the story itself little need be said.  It deals in a bright and vigorous style with the kaleidoscopic, throbbing life of a great public school--that world in miniature which, in its daily opportunities and temptations, ambitions and failures, has so often afforded superabundant material for narratives powerful to enchain the attention and sway the emotions, whether to smiles or tears.  This will take its place, amongst the best of them.",story little need say deal bright vigorous style kaleidoscopic throbb life great public school world miniature daily opportunity temptation ambition failure afford superabundant material narrative powerful enchain attention sway emotion smile tear take place good 
4,"Though the story is one of school life, its interest is by no means limited to school or college walls.  Boys of all sorts and conditions-- ay, and their parents too--will follow its fortunes with unflagging zest from the first page to the last; and it is difficult to conceive of any reader, be he young or old, who would not be the better for its vivid portraiture and bracing atmosphere.  There is a breeziness about it calculated to stir the better life in the most sluggish; and without pretence or affectation it rings out its warnings, no less than its notes of cheer, clear and rousing as trumpet blasts.",story school life interest means limit school college wall boy sort condition parent follow fortune unflagging zest first page last difficult conceive reader young old good vivid portraiture brace atmosphere be breeziness calculate stir good life sluggish pretence affectation ring warning less note cheer clear rousing trumpet blast 
5,"  ""Do right, and thou hast nought to fear,   Right hath a power that makes thee strong;   The night is dark, but light is near,   The grief is short, the joy is long.""",do right nought fear right have power make strong night dark light grief short joy long 
6,"Without the most distant approach to that fatal kind of sermonising which all but inevitably repels those whom it is meant to benefit, the story forcefully illustrates how rapidly they may sink who once tamper, for seeming present advantage, with truth, and how surely, sooner or later, a noble character comes to vindication and honour; and in all such respects it is eminently true to life.  These boys of Saint Dominic's, even the best of them, are very human--neither angels nor monstrosities, but, for the most part, ardent, impulsive, out-and-out, work-a-day lads; with the faults and failings of inexperience and impetuosity, no doubt, but also with that moral grit and downright honesty of purpose that are still, we believe, the distinguishing mark of the true British public-school boy.  Hence one is impelled to take from the outset a most genuine interest in them and their affairs, and to feel quite as though one had known many of them personally for years, and been distinctly the better, too, for that knowledge.  Such boys stand at the antipodes alike of the unreal abstractions of an effeminate sentimentalism--the paragons who prate platitudes and die young--and of the morbid specimens of youthful infamy only too frequently paraded by the equally unreal sensationalism of to-day to meet the cravings of a vitiated taste.",distant approach fatal kind sermonising repel mean benefit story illustrate sink tamper seem present advantage truth noble character come vindication honour such respect true life boy good human angel monstrosity most part ardent impulsive work day lad fault failing inexperience impetuosity doubt moral grit downright honesty purpose believe distinguish mark true british public school boy impell take outset genuine interest affair feel know many year good knowledge such boy stand antipode alike unreal abstraction effeminate sentimentalism paragon prate platitude die young morbid specimen youthful infamy parade unreal sensationalism day meet craving vitiate taste 
7,"_The Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's_ is the kind of book we should place with confidence in the hands of our own boys when leaving the home shelter, whether for school or the sterner after-battle; and we cannot conceive of the parent who, having read it with care and pleasure, as we have done, and knowing at the same time anything of the stress and strain of daily life, would not, with gratitude to the author, gladly do the same.  With all their faults, Oliver Greenfield and Wraysford are splendid boys, of just the fibre that the Church needs, and the world cannot afford to do without; and yet their school career proves by no means a bed of roses.  To drift with the current is proverbially easy; to seek to stem it manfully, and steer by the stars, may, and often does, lay one open to misapprehension or envy, and all the ills that follow in their train; yet--",fifth kind book place confidence hand own boy leave home shelter school sterner battle conceive parent read care pleasure do know same time stress strain daily life gratitude author do same fault splendid boy fibre need world afford do school career prove mean bed rose drift current easy seek stem steer star lay open misapprehension envy ill follow train

9,"Our heroes had their full share of trouble--what real hero has not?--but they come out of the ordeal purified and strengthened, with nobler aspirations after duty, and tenderer thoughts of helpfulness towards those needing, if far from seeking, their succouring arm.",hero have full share trouble real hero come ordeal purify strengthen noble aspiration duty tenderer thought helpfulness need seek succouring arm 
10,"How all this comes about it is not for us to tell.  Readers will find that out for themselves, and thank us for allowing them, unaided, to do so.  The school cricket match, the grand football struggle, the ever-memorable prize-day--these are matters that no alien pen may touch. Our prayer is that God may abundantly bless the book to the building up in our schools and families of strong Christian characters, who in the after days shall do valiant service for Christ and humanity.",come tell reader find thank allow unaided do school cricket match grand football struggle memorable prize day matter alien pen touch prayer bless book building school family strong christian character day do valiant service humanity
