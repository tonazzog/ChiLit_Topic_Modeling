1,CHAPTER XXXIII. TOADY LION'S SECOND LONE HAND.,lion second lone hand 
2," Edam Water ran swiftly, surging and pushing southward on its way to the sea. It was brown and drumly with a wrack of twigs and leaves, snatched from the low branches of the hazels and alders which fringed its banks. It fretted and elbowed, frothing like yeast about the landing-place from which the two boat-loads were to set out for the attack.",run surge push way sea brown wrack twig leave snatch low branch hazel alder fring bank fret elbow froth yeast landing place boat load set attack 
3,"General Napoleon Smith, equipped with sword and sash, sat in the stern of the first, in order to steer, while Prince Michael O'Donowitch stood on the jetty and held the boat's head. The others sat still in their places till the General gave the word. The eager soldiery vented their feelings in a great shout. Cissy Carter took her place with a flying leap just as the rope was cast off, and the fateful voyage began.",equip sword sash sit stern first order steer stand jetty hold boat head other sit place give word eager soldiery vent feeling great shout take place fly leap rope cast fateful voyage begin 
4,"At first there was little to be done save in the way of keeping the vessel's head straight, for the Edam Water, swirling and brown with the mountain rains, hurried her towards the island with almost too great speed. With a rush they passed the wide gap between the unsubmerged stones of the causeway, at which point the boldest held his breath. The beach of pebbles was immediately beyond. But they were not to be allowed to land without a struggle; for there, directly on their front, appeared the massed forces of the enemy, occupying the high bluff behind, and prepared to prevent the disembarkation by a desperate fusillade of stones and turf.",first be little do way keep vessel head swirl brown mountain rain hurry island great speed rush pass wide gap unsubmerged stone causeway point bold hold breath beach pebble allow land struggle front appear mass force enemy occupy high bluff prepare prevent disembarkation desperate fusillade stone turf 
5,It was in this hour of peril that the soldierly qualities of the leader again came out most strongly.,hour peril soldierly quality leader come 
6,"He kept the boat's head straight for the shore, as if he had been going to beach her, till she was within a dozen yards; then with a quick stroke of his steering oar he turned her right for the willow copses which fringed the island on the eastern side. The water had risen, so that these were sunk to half their height in the quick-running flood, and their leaves sucked under with the force of the current. But behind there was a quiet backwater into which Hugh John ran his vessel head on till she slanted with a gentle heave up on the green turf.",keep boat head shore go beach yard quick stroke steering oar turn willow copse fring island eastern side water rise sink height quick run flood leave suck force current quiet backwater run vessel head slant gentle heave green turf 
7,"""Overboard every man!"" he cried, and showed the example himself by dashing into the water up to the knees, carrying the blue ensign of his cause. The enemy had not expected this rapid flank movement, and waited only till the invaders had formed in battle array to retreat upon the castle, fearful perhaps of being cut off from their stronghold.",overboard man cry show example dash water knee carry blue ensign cause enemy expect rapid flank movement wait invader form battle array retreat castle fearful cut stronghold 
8,General-Field-Marshal Smith addressed his army.,address army 
9,"""Soldiers,"" he said, ""we've got to fight, and it's dead earnest this time, mind you. We're going to lick the Smoutchies, so that they will stay licked a long time. Now, come on!""",soldier say get fight dead earnest time mind go lick stay lick long time come 
10,"This brief address was considered on all hands to be a model effort, and worthy of the imitation of all generals in the face of the enemy. The most vulnerable part of the castle from the landward side was undoubtedly the great doorway--an open arch of some six feet wide, which, however, had to be approached under a galling cross fire from the ports at either side and from the lintel above.",brief address consider hand model effort worthy imitation general face enemy vulnerable part castle landward side great doorway open arch foot wide have approach gall cross fire port side lintel 
11,"""It's no use wasting time,"" cried the General; ""follow me to the door.""",use waste time cry follow door 
12,"And with his sword in his hand he darted valiantly up the steep incline which led to the castle. Cissy Carter charged at his left shoulder also sword in hand, while Mike and Peter, with Gregory's Mixture and the Craw Bogle, were scarcely a step behind.",sword hand dart steep incline lead castle charge left shoulder sword hand step 
13,"Stones and mortar hailed down upon the devoted band; sticks and clods of turf struck them on their shoulders and arms. But with their teeth clenched and their heads bent low, the storming party rushed undauntedly upon their foes.",stone mortar hail devoted band stick clod turf strike shoulder arm tooth clench head bend low storming party rush foe 
14,"The Smoutchies had built a breast-work of driftwood in front of the great entrance, but it was so flimsy that Mike and his companions kicked it away in a moment--yet not before General Smith, light as a young goat, had overleaped it and launched himself solitary on the foe. Then, with the way clear, it was cut and thrust from start to finish.",build breast work driftwood front great entrance flimsy companion kick moment light young goat overleap launch solitary foe way clear cut thrust start finish 
15,"First among the assailants General Smith crossed swords with the great Nipper Donnan himself. But his reserves had not yet come up, and so he was beaten down by three cracks on the head received from different quarters at the same time. But like Witherington in the ballad, he still fought upon his knees; and while Prince Michael and Gregory's Mixture held the enemy at bay with their stout sticks, the stricken Hugh John kept well down among their legs, and used his sword from underneath with damaging effect.",assailant cross sword great reserve come beat crack head receive different quarter same time ballad fight knee hold enemy bay stout stick stricken keep leg use sword damaging effect 
16,"""Give them the point--cold steel!"" he cried.",give point cold steel cry 
17,"""Cowld steel it is!"" shouted Prince Michael, as he brought down his blackthorn upon the right ear of Nipper Donnan.",cowld steel shout bring blackthorn right ear 
18,"""Cauld steel--tak' you that!"" cried Peter Greg the Scot as he let out with his left, and knocked Nosey Cuthbert over backwarks into the hall of the castle.",cauld steel tak cry let left knock backwark hall castle 
19,"Thus raged in front the heady fight; and thus with their faces to the foe and their weapons in their hands, we leave the vanguard of the army of Windy Standard, in order that for a little we may follow the fortunes of the other divisions.",rage front heady fight face foe weapon hand leave vanguard army windy order little follow fortune other division 
20,       *       *       *       *       *,
21,"Yes, divisions is the word, that is to say Billy Blythe's gipsy division and--Sir Toady Lion.",division word say gipsy division 
22,For once more Toady Lion was playing a lone hand.,more play lone hand 
23,"So soon as Prissy and he had been left behind, we regret to be obliged to report that the behaviour of the distinguished knight left much to be desired.",leave regret oblige report behaviour distinguished knight leave much desire 
24,"""Don't be bad, Toady Lion,"" said his sister, gently taking him by the hand; ""come and look at nice picture-books.""",bad say sister take hand come look nice picture book 
25,"""Will be bad,"" growled Toady Lion, stamping his little foot in impotent wrath; ""doan want t' look at pitchur-books--want to go and fight! And I will go too, so there!""",bad growl stamp little foot impotent wrath want look pitchur book want go fight go 
26,"And in his fiery indignation he even kicked at his sister Prissy, and threw stones after the boat in which the expedition had sailed. The gipsy division, which was to wait till they heard the noise of battle roll up from the castle island before cutting loose, took pity on Sir Toady Lion, and but for the special nature of the service required of them, they would, I think, have taken him with them.",fiery indignation kick sister throw stone boat expedition sail gipsy division wait hear noise battle roll castle island cut take pity special nature service require think take 
27,"""That's a rare well-plucked little 'un!"" cried Joe Baillie. ""See how he shuts his fists, and cuts up rough!""",rare pluck little un cry see shut fist cut rough 
28,"""A little man!"" said the leader encouragingly; ""walks into his sister's shins, don't he, the little codger!""",little man say leader walk sister shin little codger 
29,"""Let me go wif you, please,"" pleaded Toady Lion; ""I'll kill you unless!--Kill you every one!"" And his voice was full of bloodshed.",let go plead kill kill one voice full bloodshed 
30,"""Last time 'twas me that d'livered Donald, when they all runned away or got took prisoner; and now they won't even take me wif them!""",last time twat d'liver runn take prisoner take wif 
31,Billy regretfully shook his head. It would not do to be cumbered with small boys in the desperate mission on which they were going. The hope was forlorn enough as it was.,shake head do cumber small boy desperate mission go hope forlorn 
32,"""Wait till we come back, little 'un,"" he said kindly; ""run away and play with your sister.""",wait come little say run play sister 
33,Toady Lion stamped on the ground more fiercely than ever.,stamp ground 
34,"""Shan't stop and play wif a girl. If you don't let me come, I shall kill you.""",stop play girl let come kill 
35,"And with sentiments even more discreditable, he pursued their boat as long as he could reach it with volleys of stones, to the great delight of the gipsy boys, who stimulated him to yet more desperate exertions with cries of ""Well fielded!"" ""Chuck her in hard!"" ""Hit him with a big one!"" While some of those in the stern pretended to stand shaking in deadly fear, and implored Toady Lion to spare them because they were orphans.",sentiment discreditable pursue boat reach volley stone great delight gipsy boy stimulate desperate exertion cry field hard hit big one stern pretend stand shake deadly fear implore spare orphan 
36,"""Shan't spare none--shall kill 'oo every one!"" cried the angry Toady Lion, lugging at a bigger stone than all, which he could not lift above three inches from the ground.",spare kill one cry angry lugg big stone lift inch ground 
37,"""Will smass 'oo with this, Billy Blythe--bad Billy!"" he exclaimed, as he wrestled with the boulder.",smass bad exclaim wrestle boulder 
38,"""Oh, spare me--think of my family, Toady Lion, my pore wife and childer,"" pleaded Billy hypocritically.",spare think family pore wife childer plead 
39,"""'Oo should have finked of 'oo fambly sooner!"" cried Toady Lion, staggering to the water's edge with the great stone.",fink cry staggering water edge great stone 
40,"But at this moment the noise of the crying of those warring for the mastery came faintly up from the castle island. The rope that had been passed through the ring on the landing-stage and held ready in the hand of Billy Blythe, was loosened, and the second part of the besieging expedition went down with the rushing spate which reddened Edam Water. And as they fell away Billy stood up and called for three cheers for ""little Toady Lion, the best man of the lot.""",moment noise cry warr mastery come castle island rope pass ring landing stage hold ready hand loosen second part besieging expedition go rush spate redden fall stand call cheer little good man lot 
41,"But Toady Lion stood on the shore and fairly bellowed with impotent rage, and the sound of his crying, ""I'll kill 'oo! I'll kill 'oo dead!"" roused Janet Sheepshanks, who was taking advantage of her master's absence to carry out a complete house-cleaning. She left the blanket-washing to see what was the matter. But Toady Lion, angry as he was, had sense enough to know that if Janet got him, he would be superintended all the morning. So with real alacrity he slipped aside into the ""scrubbery,"" and there lay hidden till Janet, anxious that her maids should not scamp their house-work, was compelled to hurry back to the laundry to see that the blankets were properly washed.",stand shore bellow impotent rage sound cry kill kill dead rouse take advantage master absence carry complete house cleaning leave blanket washing see matter angry have sense know get superintend morning real alacrity slip scrubbery lay hide anxious maid scamp house work compel hurry laundry see blanket wash 
42,"After this there was but one thing to do, and so the second division, under Sir Toady Lion, did it. He resolved to turn the enemy's flank, and attack him with reinforcements from an entirely unexpected quarter. So, leaving Prissy to her own devices, he took to his heels, and his fat legs carried him rapidly in the direction of the town of Edam. Difficulties there were of course, such as the barrier of the white lodge gate, where old Betty lay in wait for him.",be thing do second division do resolve turn enemy flank attack reinforcement unexpected quarter leave own device take heel fat leg carry direction town difficulty course such barrier white lodge gate old lay wait 
43,"But Toady Lion circumnavigated Betty by going to the lodge-door and shouting with all his might, ""Betty, come quick, p'raps they's some soldiers comin' down the road--maybe Tom's comin', 'oo come and look.""",circumnavigate go lodge door shouting come quick p'rap soldier comin' road comin' come look 
44,"""Sodjers--where?--what?"" cried old Betty, waking up hastily from her doze, and fumbling in her pocket for the gate-key.",cry old wake doze fumble pocket gate key 
45,"Toady Lion was at her elbow when she undid the latch. Toady Lion charged past her with a yell. Toady Lion it was who from the safe middle of the highway made the preposterous explanation, ""Oh no, they isn't no soldiers. 'Tis only a silly old fish-man wif a tin trumpet.""",elbow undid latch charge yell safe middle highway make preposterous explanation soldier silly old fish man wif tin trumpet 
46,"""Come back, sir, or I'll tell your father! Come back at once!"" cried old Betty.",come sir tell father come cry old 
47,"But she might shake her head and nod with her nut-cracker chin till the black beads on her lace ""kep"" tinkled. All was in vain. Toady Lion was out of reach far down the dusty main road along which the Scots Greys had come the day that Hugh John became a soldier. Toady Lion was a born pioneer, and usually got what he wanted, first of all by dint of knowing exactly what he did want, and then ""fighting it out on that line if it took all summer""--or even winter too.",shake head nod nut cracker chin black bead lace kep tinkle vain reach dusty main road come day become soldier bear pioneer get want first dint know want fight line take summer winter 
48,"The road to the town of Edam wound underneath trees great and tall, which hummed with bees and gnats that day as Toady Lion sped along, his bare feet ""plapping"" pleasantly in the white hot dust. He was furtively crying all the time--not from sorrow but with sheer indignation. He hated all his kind. He was going to desert to the Smoutchies. He would be a Comanche Cowboy if they would have him, since his brother and Cissy Carter had turned against him. Nobody loved him, and he was glad of it. Prissy--oh! yes, but Prissy did not count. She loved everybody and everything, even stitching and dollies, and putting on white thread gloves when you went into town. So he ran on, evading the hay waggons and red farm-carts without looking at them, till in a trice he had crossed Edam Bridge and entered the town--in the glaring streets and upon the hot pavement of which the sunshine was sleeping, and which on Saturday forenoon had more than its usual aspect of enjoying a perpetual siesta.",road town wind tree great tall humm bee gnat day spe bare foot plapp white hot dust cry time sorrow sheer indignation hate kind go desert have brother turn love glad prissy count love stitching dolly put white thread glove go town run evade hay waggon red farm cart look trice cross enter town glaring street hot pavement sunshine sleep forenoon have more usual aspect enjoy perpetual siesta 
49,"The leading chemist was standing at his door, wondering if the rustic who passed in such a hurry could actually be on the point of entering the shop of his hated rival. The linen-draper at the corner under the town clock was divided between keeping an eye on his apprentices to see that they did not spar with yard sticks, and mentally criticising the ludicrous and meretricious window-dressing of his next-door neighbour.",lead chemist stand door wonder rustic pass hurry point enter shop hate rival linen draper corner town clock divide keep eye apprentice see spar yard stick criticise ludicrous meretricious window dress next door neighbour 
50,"None of them cared at all for the small dusty boy with the tear-furrowed countenance who kept on trotting so steadily through the town, turned confidently up the High Street, and finally dodged into the path which led past the Black Sheds to the wooden bridge which joined the castle island to the butcher's parks. As he crossed the grass Toady Lion heard a wrathful voice from somewhere calling loudly, ""Nipper! Nipper-r-r-r! Oh, wait till I catch you!""",care small dusty boy tear furrow countenance keep trot town turn high dodg path lead black wooden bridge join castle island butcher park cross grass hear wrathful voice call wait catch 
51,"For it chanced that this day the leading butcher in Edam was without the services of both his younger assistants--his son Nipper and his message boy, Tommy Pratt. Mr. Donnan had a new cane in his hand, and he was making it whistle through the air in a most unpleasant and suggestive manner.",chance day lead butcher service young assistant son message boy have new cane hand make whistle air unpleasant suggestive manner 
52,"""Get away out of my field, little boy--where are you going? What are you doing there?""",get field little boy go do 
53,"The question was put at short range now, for all unwittingly Sir Toady Lion had almost run into butcher Donnan's arms.",question put short range run butcher arm 
54,"""Please I finks I'se going to Mist'r Burnham's house,"" explained Toady Lion readily but somewhat unaccurately; ""I'se keepin' off the grass--and I didn't know it was your grass anyway, please, sir.""",fink go house explain i'se keepin grass know grass sir 
55,"At the same time Toady Lion saluted because he also was a soldier, and Mr. Donnan, who in his untempered youth had passed several years in the ranks of Her Majesty's line, mechanically returned the courtesy.",same time salute soldier untempered youth pass several year rank line return courtesy 
56,"""Why, little shaver,"" he said not unkindly, ""this isn't the way to Mr. Burnham's house. There it is over among the trees. But, hello, talk of the--ahem--why, here comes Mr. Burnham himself.""",little shaver say way house be tree talk come 
57,"Toady Lion clapped his hands and ran as fast as he could in the direction of the clergyman. Mr. Burnham was very tall, very soldierly, very stiff, and his well-fitting black coat and corded silk waistcoat were the admiration of the ladies of the neighbourhood. He was never seen out of doors without the glossiest of tall hats, and it was whispered that he had his trousers made tight about the calves on purpose to look like a dean. It was also understood in well-informed circles that he was writing a book on the eastward position--after which there would be no such thing as the Low Church. Nevertheless an upright, good, and, above all, kindly heart beat under the immaculate silk M. B. waistcoat; also strong capable arms were attached to the armholes of the coat which fitted its owner without a wrinkle. Indeed, Mr. Burnham had a blue jacket of a dark shade in which he had once upon a time rowed a famous race. It hung now in a glass cabinet, and was to the clergyman what Sambo Soulis was to General-Field-Marshal Smith.",clapp hand run direction clergyman tall soldierly stiff fitting black coat cord silk waistcoat admiration lady neighbourhood see door glossiest tall hat whisper have trousers make tight calve purpose look dean understand inform circle write book eastward position be such thing lo upright good heart beat immaculate silk waistcoat strong capable arm attach armhole coat fit owner wrinkle have blue jacket dark shade have time row famous race hang glass cabinet clergyman 
58,"But as we know, the fear of man dwelt not in Sir Toady Lion, and certainly not fear of his clergyman. He trotted up to him and said, ""I wants to go to the castle. You come.""",know fear man dwele fear clergyman trotet say want go castle come 
59,"Now hitherto Mr. Burnham had always seen Sir Toady Lion as he came, with shining face and liberally plastered hair, from under the tender mercies of Janet Sheepshanks--with her parting monition to behave (and perhaps something else) still ringing in his ear.",see come shine face plaster hair tender mercie parting monition behave else ring ear 
60,"So that it is no wonder that he did not for the moment recognise in the tear-stained, dust-caked face of the barefooted imp who addressed him so unceremoniously, the features of the son of his most prominent parishioner. He gazed down in mildly bewildered surprise, whereupon Toady Lion took him familiarly by the hand and reiterated his request, with an aplomb which had all the finality of a royal invitation.",wonder moment recognise tear stain dust cake face barefoot imp address feature son prominent parishioner gaze bewilder surprise take hand reiterate request aplomb have finality royal invitation 
61,"""Take me to the castle on the island. I 'ants to go there!""",take castle island ant go

64,"""Why do you want to go to the castle island?"" asked Mr. Burnham.",want go castle island ask 
65,"""To find my bruvver Hugh John,"" said Toady Lion instantly.",find bruvver say 
66,"The butcher had come up and stood listening silently, after having, with a certain hereditary respect for the cloth, respectfully saluted Mr. Burnham.",butcher come stand listen certain hereditary respect cloth salute 
67,"""This little boy wants to go on the island to find his brother,"" said the clergyman; ""I suppose I may pass through your field with him?""",little boy want go island find brother say clergyman suppose pass field

69,"""There is some dust being kicked up among the boys. I can't get my rascals to attend to business at all this last week or two.""",be dust kick boy get rascal attend business last week 
70,"And Mr. Donnan again caused his cane to whistle through the air in a way that turned Toady Lion cold, and made him glad that he was ""Mr. Smift's little boy,"" and neither the son nor yet the errand-boy of the butcher of Edam.",cause cane whistle air way turn cold make glad little boy son errand boy butcher 
71,"Presently the three came to the wooden bridge, and from it they could see the flag flying over the battlements of the castle, and a swarming press of black figures swaying this way and that across the bright green turf in front.",come wooden bridge see flag fly battlement castle swarm press black figure sway way bright green turf front

73,"Suddenly a far-off burst of cheering came to them down the wind. Black dots swarmed on the perilous battlements of the castle. Other black dots were unceremoniously pitched off the lower ramparts into the ditch below. The red and white flag of jacobin rebellion was pulled under, and a clamorous crowd of disturbed jackdaws rose from the turrets and hung squalling and circling over the ancient and lofty walls.",off burst cheering come wind black dot swarm perilous battlement castle other black dot pitch low rampart ditch red white flag jacobin rebellion pull clamorous crowd disturb jackdaw rise turret hang squall circle ancient lofty wall 
74,"The conflict had indeed joined in earnest. The embattled foes were in the death grips; and, fearful lest he should arrive too late, Toady Lion hurried forward his reinforcements, crying, ""Come on both of you! Come on, quick!"" Butcher Donnan broke into a run, while Mr. Burnham, forgetting all about his silk waistcoat, clapped his tall hat on the back of his head and started forward at his best speed, Toady Lion hanging manfully on to the long skirts of his coat, as the Highlanders had clung to the cavalry stirrups at Balaclava till they were borne into the very floodtide of battle.",conflict join earnest embattled foe death grip fearful arrive hurry reinforcement cry come come quick break run forget silk waistcoat clapp tall hat back head start good speed hang long skirt coat cling cavalry stirrup borne very floodtide battle
