28,"Mr Seagrave narrated many instances of the sagacity of animals, when William asked the question of his father: ""What is the difference then between reason and instinct?""",narrate many instance sagacity animal ask question father difference reason instinct 
29,"""The difference is very great, William, as I will explain to you; but I must first observe, that it has been the custom to say that man is governed by reason, and animals by instinct, alone.  This is an error. Man has instinct as well as reason; and animals, although chiefly governed by instinct, have reasoning powers.""",difference great explain observe custom say man govern reason animal instinct alone error man have instinct reason animal govern instinct have reasoning power 
30,"""In what points does man show that he is led by instinct?""",point man show lead instinct 
31,"""When a child is first born, William, it acts by instinct only: the reasoning powers are not yet developed; as we grow up, our reason becomes every day more matured, and gains the mastery over our instinct, which decreases in proportion.""",child bear act instinct reasoning power develop grow reason become day mature gain mastery instinct decrease proportion 
32,"""Then when we have grown to a good old age, I suppose we have no instinct left in us?""",grow good old age suppose have instinct leave 
33,"""Not so, my dear boy; there is one and a most powerful instinct implanted in man which never deserts him on this side of the grave.  It is the fear, not of death, but of utter annihilation, that of becoming nothing after death.  This instinctive feeling could not have been so deeply implanted in us, but as an assurance that we shall not be annihilated after death, but that our souls shall still exist, although our bodies shall have perished.  It may be termed the instinctive evidence of a future existence.""",dear boy be powerful instinct implant man desert side grave fear death utter annihilation become death instinctive feeling implant assurance annihilate death soul exist body perish term instinctive evidence future existence 
34,"""That is very true, Mr Seagrave,"" observed Ready.",true observe ready 
35,"""Instinct in animals, William,"" continued Mr Seagrave, ""is a feeling which compels them to perform certain acts without previous thought or reflection; this instinct is in full force at the moment of their birth; it was therefore perfect in the beginning, and has never varied.  The swallow built her nest, the spider its web, the bee formed its comb, precisely in the same way four thousand years ago, as they do now.  I may here observe, that one of the greatest wonders of instinct is the mathematical form of the honeycomb of the bee, which has been proved by demonstration to be that by which is given the greatest possible saving of time and labour.""",instinct animal continue feeling compel perform certain act previous thought reflection instinct full force moment birth perfect beginning vary swallow build nest spider web bee form comb same way year do observe great wonder instinct mathematical form honeycomb bee prove demonstration give great possible save time labour
