1,CHAPTER 43.,
2,"As usual, Ready was the first up on the following morning, and having greeted Juno, who followed him out of the house, he set off on his accustomed rounds, to examine into the stock and their other possessions.  He was standing in the garden at the point.  First he thought that it would be necessary to get ready some sticks for the peas, which were now seven or eight inches out of the ground; he had proceeded a little farther, to where the calivances, or French haricot beans, had been sown, and had decided upon the propriety of hoeing up the earth round them, as they were a very valuable article of food, that would keep, and afford many a good dish during the rainy or winter season.  He had gone on to ascertain if the cucumber seeds had shown themselves above-ground, and was pleased to find that they were doing well.  He said to himself, ""We have no vinegar, that I know of, but we can preserve them in salt and water, as they do in Russia; it will be a change, at all events;"" and then he raised his eyes and looked out to the offing, and, as usual, scanned the horizon.  He thought he saw a ship to the north-east, and he applied his telescope to his eye.  He was not mistaken--it was a vessel.",usual ready first up follow morning greet follow house set accustom round examine stock other possession stand garden point think necessary get ready stick pea inch ground proceed little calivance french haricot bean sow decide propriety hoeing earth valuable article food keep afford many good dish rainy winter season go ascertain cucumber seed show ground pleased find do say have vinegar know preserve salt water do change event raise eye look offing usual scan horizon think see ship north east apply telescope eye mistaken vessel 
3,"The old man's heart beat quick; he dropped his telescope on his arm, and fetched some heavy breaths before he could recover from the effect of this unexpected sight.  After a minute, he again put his telescope to his eye, and then made her out to be a brig, under top-sails and top-gallant sails, steering directly for the island.",old man heart beat quick drop telescope arm fetched heavy breath recover effect unexpected sight minute put telescope eye make brig top sail top gallant sail steering island 
4,"Ready walked to the rocky point, from which they fished, and sat down to reflect.  Could it be that the vessel had been sent after them, or that she had by mere chance come among the islands?  He decided after a short time that it must be chance, for none could know that they were saved, much less that they were on the island.  Her steering towards the island must then be either that she required water or something else; perhaps she would alter her course and pass by them.  ""At all events,"" thought the old man, ""we are in the hands of God, who will, at his own time and in his own way, do with us as he thinks fit.  I will not at present say anything to Mr and Mrs Seagrave.  It would be cruel to raise hopes which might end in disappointment.  A few hours will decide.  And yet I cannot do without help--I must trust William.""",ready walk rocky point fish sit reflect vessel send have mere chance come island decide short time chance know save less island steering island require water else alter course pass event think old man hand own time own way do think fit present say cruel raise hope end disappointment few hour decide do help trust 
5,"Ready rose, examined the vessel with his telescope, and then walked towards the house.  William was up, and the remainder of the family were stirring.",ready rise examine vessel telescope walk house remainder family stir 
6,"""William,"" said Ready to him, as they walked away from the house, ""I have a secret to tell you, which you will at once see the necessity of not telling to anyone at present.  A few hours will decide the question.""  William readily gave his promise.  ""There is a vessel off the island; she may be the means of rescuing us, or she may pass without seeing us.  It would be too cruel a disappointment to your father and mother, if the latter were the case.""",say ready walk house have secret tell see necessity tell present few hour decide question give promise be vessel island means rescuing pass see cruel disappointment father mother latter case 
7,"William stared at Ready, and for a moment could not speak, his excitement was so great.",stare ready moment speak excitement great 
8,"""Oh, Ready, how grateful I am!  I trust that we may be taken away, for you have no idea how my poor father suffers in silence--and so does my mother.""",ready grateful trust take have idea poor father suffer silence mother 
9,"""I know it, William, I know it, and it is natural; they do their best to control their yearnings, and they can do no more.  But now we must be quick, and at work before breakfast.  But stop, I will show you the vessel.""",know know natural do good control yearning do more quick work breakfast stop show vessel 
10,"Ready caught the vessel in the field of the telescope, which he leant against the trunk of a cocoa-nut, and William put his eye to the glass.",ready catch vessel field telescope lean trunk cocoa nut put eye glass 
11,"""Do you see her?""",see 
12,"""Oh yes, Ready, and she is coming this way.""",ready come way 
13,"""Yes, she is steering right for the island.  I will put the telescope down here, and we will go about our work.""",steering island put telescope go work 
14,"William and Ready went to the storehouse for the axe.  Ready selected a very slight cocoa-nut tree nearest to the beach, which he cut down, and as soon as the top was taken off with the assistance of William he carried it down to the point.",go storehouse axe ready select slight cocoa nut tree beach cut top take assistance carry point 
15,"""Now, William, go for a shovel and dig a hole here, that we may fix it up as a flag-staff.  When all is ready, I will go for a small block and some rope for halyards to hoist up the flags as soon as the vessel is likely to see them.  At breakfast-time, I shall propose that you and I get the boat out of the sand and examine her, and give Mr Seagrave some work indoors.""",go shovel dig hole fix flag staff ready go small block rope halyard hoist flag vessel likely see breakfast time propose get boat sand examine give work 
16,"""But the flags, Ready; they are round my mother's bed.  How shall we get them?""",flag ready mother bed get 
17,"""Suppose I say that it is time that the house should be well cleaned, and that the canvas hangings of the beds should be taken out to be aired this fine day.  Ask your father to take the direction of the work while we dig out the boat; that will employ them all inside the house.""",suppose say time house clean canvas hanging bed take air fine day ask father take direction work dig boat employ house 
18,"""Yes, that will do, Ready.""",do ready 
19,"During breakfast-time, Ready observed that he intended to get the boat out of the sand, and that William should assist him.",breakfast time ready observe intend get boat sand assist 
20,"""And what am I to do, Ready?"" said Mr Seagrave.",do ready say 
21,"""Why, sir, I think, now that the rains are over, it would not be a bad thing if we were to air bedding, as they say at sea; it is a fine, warm day; and if all the bedding was taken out of the house and well shaken, and then left out to air, it would be a very good job over; for you see, sir, I have thought more than once that the house does smell a little close.""",sir think rain bad thing air bedding say sea fine warm day bedding take house shake leave air good job see sir think more house smell little close 
22,"""It will be a very good thing, Ready,"" observed Mrs Seagrave; ""and, at the same time, Juno and I will give the house a thorough cleaning and sweeping.""",good thing ready observe same time give house thorough cleaning sweeping 
23,"""Had we not better have the canvas screens down, and air them too?""",have canvas screen air 
24,"""Yes,"" replied Ready; ""we had better air everything.  We will assist in taking down the screens and flags, and spread them out to air, and then, if Mr Seagrave has no objection, we will leave him to superintend and assist Madam and Juno.""",reply ready have good air assist take screen flag spread air have objection leave superintend assist 
25,"""With all my heart,"" replied Mr Seagrave.  ""We have done breakfast, and will begin as soon as you please.""",heart reply do breakfast begin 
26,"Ready and William took down the canvas screens and flags, and went out of the cottage with them; they spread out the canvas at some distance from the house, and then William went down to the beach with the flags, while Ready procured the block and small rope to hoist them up with.",ready take canvas screen flag go cottage spread canvas distance house go beach flag ready procure block small rope hoist 
27,"Ready's stratagem answered well.  Without being perceived by those in the cottage, the flag-staff was raised, and fixed in the ground, and the flags all ready for hoisting; then Ready and William returned to the fuel-stack, and each carried down as much stuff as they could hold, that they might make a smoke to attract the notice of those on board of the vessel.  All this did not occupy much more than an hour, during which the brig continued her course steadily towards the island.  When Ready first saw her the wind was light, but latterly the breeze had increased very much, and at last the brig took in her top-gallant sails.  The horizon behind the vessel, which had been quite clear, was now banked up with clouds, and the waves curled in white foam over the reefs of rocks extending from the island.",ready stratagem answer perceive cottage flag staff raise fix ground flag ready hoist ready return fuel stack carry much stuff hold make smoke attract notice board vessel occupy much more hour brig continue course island ready see wind light breeze increase last brig take top gallant sail horizon vessel clear bank cloud wave curl white foam reef rock extend island 
28,"""The breeze is getting up strong, William,"" said Ready, ""and she will soon be down, if she is not frightened at the reefs, which she can see plainer now the water is rough, than she could before.""",breeze get strong say ready frighten reef see plainer water rough 
29,"""I trust she will not be afraid,"" replied William.  ""How far do you think she is off now?""",trust afraid reply think 
30,"""About five miles; not more.  The wind has hauled round more to the southward, and it is banking up fast, I see.  I fear that we shall have another smart gale; however, it won't last long.  Come, let us hoist the flags; we must not lose a chance; the flags will blow nice and clear for them to see them.""",mile more wind haul more southward banking see fear have smart gale last come let hoist flag lose chance flag blow nice clear see 
31,"William and Ready hoisted up the ensign first, and below it the flag, with the ship's name, Pacific, in large letters upon it.  ""Now then,"" said Ready, as he made fast the halyards, ""let us strike a light and make a smoke; that will attract their notice.""",hoist ensign first flag ship name large letter say ready make halyard let strike light make smoke attract notice 
32,"As soon as the cocoa-nut leaves were lighted, Ready and William threw water upon them, so as to damp them and procure a heavy column of smoke. The vessel approached rapidly, and they were watching her in silent suspense, when they perceived Mr and Mrs Seagrave, Juno carrying Albert, with Tommy and Caroline running down as fast as they could to the beach.  The fact was, that Tommy, tired of work, had gone out of the house and walked towards the beach; there he perceived, first, the flags hoisted, and then he detected the vessel off the island.  He immediately ran back to the house, crying out, ""Papa!  Mamma!  Captain Osborn come back--come back in a big ship.""  At this announcement, Mr and Mrs Seagrave ran out of the house, perceived the vessel and the flags flying, and ran as fast as they could down to where William and Ready were standing by the flag-staff.",cocoa nut leave light ready throw water damp procure heavy column smoke vessel approach watch silent suspense perceive carry run beach fact tired work go house walk beach perceive flag hoist detect vessel island run house cry come come big ship announcement run house perceive vessel flag fly run stand flag staff 
33,"""Oh!  Ready, why did you not tell us this before?"" exclaimed Mr Seagrave.",ready tell exclaim 
34,"""I wish you had not known it now, sir,"" replied Ready; ""but, however, it can't be helped; it was done out of kindness, Mr Seagrave.""",wish know sir reply ready help do kindness 
35,"""Yes, indeed it was, papa.""",
36,"Mrs Seagrave dropped down on the rock, and burst into tears.  Mr Seagrave was equally excited.",drop rock burst tear excited 
37,"""Does she see us, Ready?"" exclaimed he at last.",see ready exclaim last 
38,"""No, sir, not yet, and I waited till she did, before I made it known to you,"" replied Ready.",sir wait make know reply ready 
39,"""She is altering her course, Ready,"" said William.",alter course ready say 
40,"""Yes, sir, she has hauled to the wind; she is afraid of coming too near to the reefs.""",sir haul wind afraid come reef 
41,"""Surely she is not leaving us!"" exclaimed Mrs Seagrave.",leave exclaim 
42,"""No, madam; but she does not see us yet.""",madam see 
43,"""She does! she does!"" cried William, throwing up his hat; ""see, she hoists her ensign.""",cry throw hat see hoist ensign 
44,"""Very true, sir; she does see us.  Thanks be to God!""",true sir see thanks 
45,"Mr Seagrave embraced his wife, who threw herself sobbing into his arms, kissed his children with rapture, and wrung old Ready's hand.  He was almost frantic with joy.  William was equally delighted.",embrace wife throw sobb arm kiss child rapture wrung old hand frantic joy delighted 
46,"As soon as they were a little more composed, Ready observed: ""Mr Seagrave, that they have seen us is certain, and what we must now do is to get our own boat out of the sand.  We know the passage through the reefs, and they do not.  I doubt if they will, however, venture to send a boat on shore, until the wind moderates a little.  You see, sir, it is blowing up very strong just now.""",little compose ready observe see certain do get own boat sand know passage reef doubt venture send boat shore wind moderate little see sir blow strong 
47,"""But you don't think it will blow harder, Ready?""",think blow hard ready 
48,"""I am sorry to say, sir, that I do.  It looks very threatening to the southward, and until the gale is over, they will not venture near an island so surrounded with rocks.  It would be very imprudent if they did.  However, sir, a few hours will decide.""",sorry say sir look threatening southward gale venture island surround rock imprudent sir few hour decide 
49,"""But, surely,"" said Mrs Seagrave, ""even if it does blow, they will not leave the island without taking us off.  They will come after the gale is over.""",say blow leave island take come gale 
50,"""Yes, madam, if they can, I do think they will; but God knows, some men have hard hearts, and feel little for the misery of others.""",madam think know man have hard heart feel little misery other 
51,"The brig had, in the meantime, kept away again, as if she was running in; but very soon afterwards she hauled to the wind, with her head to the northward, and stood away from the island.",brig meantime keep run haul wind head northward stand island 
52,"""She is leaving us,"" exclaimed William, mournfully.",leave exclaim 
53,"""Hard-hearted wretches!"" said Mr Seagrave, with indignation.",hard hearted wretche say indignation 
54,"""You are wrong to say that, sir,"" replied Ready: ""excuse me, Mr Seagrave, for being so bold; but the fact is, that if I was in command of that vessel, I should do just as they have done.  The gale rises fast, and it would be very dangerous for them to remain where they now are.  It does not at all prove that they intend to leave us; they but consult their own safety, and, when the gale is over, we shall, I trust, see them again.""",wrong say sir reply ready excuse bold fact command vessel do do gale rise fast dangerous remain prove intend leave consult own safety gale trust see 
55,"No reply was made to Ready's judicious remarks.  The Seagraves only saw that the vessel was leaving them, and their hearts sank.  They watched her in silence, and as she gradually diminished to the view, so did their hopes depart from them.  The wind was now fierce, and a heavy squall, with rain, obscured the offing, and the vessel was no longer to be distinguished.  Mr Seagrave turned to his wife, and mournfully offered her his arm.  They walked away from the beach without speaking; the remainder of the party, with the exception of old Ready, followed them.  Ready remained some time with his eyes in the direction where the vessel was last seen.  At last he hauled down the ensign and flag, and, throwing them over his shoulder, followed the disconsolate party to the house.",reply make judicious remark see vessel leave heart sink watch silence diminish view hope depart wind fierce heavy squall rain obscure offing vessel distinguish turn wife offer arm walk beach speak remainder party exception old ready follow ready remain time eye direction vessel see last haul ensign flag throw shoulder follow disconsolate party house
