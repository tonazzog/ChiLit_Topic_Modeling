3," Guy’s evening with the Ashfords threw down many of the barriers in the way of intimacy. He soon made friends with the children, beginning with the two years old baby, and ending with gaining even the shy and sturdy Robin, who could not hold out any longer, when it appeared that Sir Guy could tell him the best place for finding sea-urchins, the present objects of his affections.",guy evening throw many barrier way intimacy make friend child begin year old baby end gain shy sturdy hold appear tell good place find sea- urchin present object affection

5,"‘Well, why not?’",
6,"‘We must not go into the park!’ cried the children, in chorus.",go park cry child chorus 
7,"‘Not go into the park!’ exclaimed Guy, looking at Mrs. Ashford, in amazement; then, as it flashed on him that it was his part to give leave, he added,--‘I did not know I was such a dog in the manger. I thought all the parish walked naturally in the park. I don’t know what else it is good for. If Markham will lock it up, I must tell him to give you a key.’",go park exclaim guy look amazement flash part give leave add know dog manger think parish walk park know good lock tell give key 
8,"The boys were to come the next day--to be shown the way to the bay of urchins, and thenceforth they became his constant followers to such a degree, that their parents feared they were very troublesome, but he assured them to the contrary; and no mother in the world could have found it in her heart to keep them away from so much happiness. There was continually a rushing home with a joyous outcry,--‘Mamma! Sir Guy gave me a ride on his horse!’ ‘Mamma! Sir Guy helped us to the top of that great rock!’ ‘Oh, papa! Sir Guy says we may come out shooting with him to-morrow, if you will let us!’ ‘Mamma! papa! look! Do you see? I shot this rabbit my own self with Sir Guy’s gun!’ ‘Papa! papa! Sir Guy showed us his boat, and he says he will take us out to the Shag Rock, if you will give us leave!’",boy come next day show way bay urchin thenceforth become constant follower degree parent fear troublesome assure contrary mother world find heart keep much happiness be rush home joyous outcry give ride horse help top great rock say come shoot let papa look see shoot rabbit own self gun papa show boat say take give leave 
9,"This was beyond what papa, still further beyond what mamma, could like, since the sea was often very rough in parts near the Shag; there were a good many sunken rocks, and boys, water, and rocks, did not appear by any means a safe conjunction, so Mrs. Ashford put the matter off for the present by the unseasonableness of the weather; and Mr. Ashford asked one or two of the fishermen how far they thought landing on the Shag a prudent attempt.",papa mamma like sea rough part be good many sink rock boy water rock appear mean safe conjunction put matter present unseasonableness weather ask fisherman think land prudent attempt 
10,"They did not profess to have often tried, they always avoided those rocks; but it could hardly be very dangerous, they said, for when Sir Guy was a boy, he used to be about there for ever, at first with an old boatman, and afterwards alone in his little boat. They had often wondered he was trusted there; but if any one knew the rocks, he did.",profess try avoid rock dangerous say boy use first old boatman alone little boat wonder trust one know rock 
11,"Still, Mrs. Ashford could not make up her mind to like the idea, and the boys came to Sir Guy in a state of great discomposure.",make mind like idea boy come state great discomposure 
12,"‘Never mind’ he said, ‘perhaps we shall manage it in the summer. We will get your father to go out with us himself; and, in the meantime, who likes to come with me after the rabbits in Cliffstone Copse? Farmer Holt will thank Robin for killing a dozen or so, for he makes grievous complaints of them.’",mind say manage summer get father go meantime like come rabbit thank kill make grievous complaint 
13,"Guy conducted the boys out of sight of the sea, and, to console them, gave them so much more use of the gun than usual, that it might be considered as a wonder that he escaped being shot. Yet it did not prevent a few sighs being spent on the boating.",guy conduct boy sight sea console give more use gun usual consider wonder escape shoot prevent few sigh spend boating 
14,"‘Can’t you forget it?’ said Guy, smiling. ‘You have no loss, after all, for we are likely to have no boating weather this long time. Hark! don’t you hear the ground-swell?’",forget say guy smile have loss likely have boating weather long time hark hear ground swell 
15,"‘What’s that?’ said the boys, standing still to listen to the distant surge, like a continuous low moan, or roar, far, far away, though there was no wind, and the sea was calm.",say boy stand listen distant surge continuous low moan roar be wind sea calm 
16,"‘It is the sound that comes before stormy weather,’ said Guy. ‘It is as if the sea was gathering up its forces for the tempest.’",sound come stormy weather say guy sea gather force tempest

18,"‘I suppose it is the wind on the sea before it has reached us,’ said Guy. ‘How solemn it is!’",suppose wind sea reach say guy solemn 
19,"Too solemn for the boys, who began all manner of antics and noises, by way of silencing the impression of awfulness. Guy laughed, and joined in their fun; but as soon as they were gone home, he stood in silence for a long time, listening to the sound, and recalling the mysterious dreams and fancies with which it was connected in his boyhood, and which he had never wished thus to drive away.",solemn boy begin manner antic noise way silence impression awfulness guy laugh join fun go stand silence long time listen sound recall mysterious dream fancy connect boyhood wish drive 
20,"The storm he had predicted came on; and by the evening of the following day, sea and wind were thundering, in their might, against the foot of the crags. Guy looked from the window, the last thing at night, and saw the stars twinkling overhead, with that extreme brilliancy which is often seen in the intervals of fitful storms, and which suggested thoughts that sent him to sleep in a vague, soothing dream.",storm predict come evening follow day sea wind thunder might foot crag guy look window last thing night see star twinkle extreme brilliancy see interval fitful storm suggest thought send sleep vague soothing dream 
21,"He was wakened by one tremendous continued roar of sea, wind, and thunder combined. Such was the darkness, that he could not see the form of the window, till a sheet of pale blue lightning brought it fully out for the moment. He sat up, and listened to the ‘glorious voice’ that followed it, thought what an awful night at sea, and remembered when he used to fancy it would be the height of felicity to have a shipwreck at Redclyffe, and shocked Mrs. Bernard by inhuman wishes that a ship would only come and be wrecked. How often had he watched, through sounds like these, for a minute gun! Nay, he had once actually called up poor Arnaud in the middle of the night for an imaginary signal. Redclyffe Bay was a very dangerous one; a fine place for a wreck, with its precipitous crags, its single safe landing-place, and the great Shag Stone, on the eastern side, with a whole progeny of nearly sunken rocks, dreaded in rough weather by the fishermen themselves; but it was out of the ordinary track of vessels, and there were only a few traditions of terrible wrecks long before his time.",waken tremendous continue roar sea wind thunder combine such darkness see form window sheet pale blue lightning bring moment sit listen glorious voice follow think awful night sea remember use fancy height felicity have shipwreck shock inhuman wish ship come wreck watch sound minute gun call poor middle night imaginary signal dangerous one fine place wreck precipitous crag single safe landing place great eastern side whole progeny sink rock dread rough weather fisherman ordinary track vessel be few tradition terrible wreck time 
22,"It seemed as if he had worked up his fancy again, for the sound of a gun was for a moment in his ear. It was lost in the rush of hail against the window, and the moaning of the wind round the old house; but presently it returned too surely to be imaginary. He sprang to the window, and the broad, flickering glare of lightning revealed the black cliff and pale sea-line; then all was dark and still, while the storm was holding its breath for the thunder-burst which in a few more seconds rolled overhead, shaking door and window throughout the house. As the awful sound died away, in a moment’s lull, came the gun again. He threw up the window, and as the blast of wind and rain swept howling into the room, it brought another report.",seem work fancy sound gun moment ear lose rush hail window moan wind old house return imaginary spring window broad flicker glare lightning reveal black cliff pale sea line dark storm hold breath thunder burst few more second roll overhead shake door window house awful sound die moment lull come gun throw window blast wind rain sweep howl room bring report 
23,"To close the window, light his candle, throw on his clothes, and hasten down-stairs, was the work of a very few seconds. Luckily, the key of the boat-house was lying on the table in the hall, where he had left it, after showing the boat to the Ashford boys; he seized it, caught up the pocket telescope, put on a rough coat, and proceeded to undo the endless fastenings of the hall-door, a very patience-trying occupation; and, when completed, the gusts that were eddying round the house, ready to force their way in everywhere, took advantage of the first opening to blow out his candle.",close window light candle throw clothes hast stair work few second key boat house lie table hall leave show boat boy seize catch pocket telescope put rough coat proceed undo endless fastening hall door patience try occupation complete gust eddy house ready force way take advantage first opening blow candle 
24,"However, they had in one way done good service, for the shower had been as brief as it was violent, and the inky cloud was drifting away furiously towards the east, leaving the moon visible, near her setting, and allowing her white cold light to shine forth, contrasting with the distant sheets of pale lightning, growing fainter and fainter.",have way do good service shower brief violent inky cloud drift east leave moon visible setting allow white cold light shine contrast distant sheet pale lightning grow fainter fainter 
25,"Guy ran across the court, round to the west side of the house, and struggled up the slope in the face of the wind, which almost swept him down again; and when at length he had gained the summit, came rushing against him with such force that he could hardly stand. He did, however, keep his ground, and gazed out over the sea. The swell was fearful; marked by the silver light on one side, where it caught the moonbeams, and the black shade on the other, ever alternating, so that the eye could, not fix on them for a moment; the spray leapt high in its whiteness, and the Shag stood up hard, bold, and black. The waves thundered, bursting on the cliff and, high as he stood, the spray dashed almost blinding in his face, while the wind howled round him, as if gathering its might for the very purpose of wrenching him from the cliff; but he stood firm, and looked out again, to discern clearly what he thought he had seen. It was the mast of a vessel, seen plainly against the light silvery distance of sea on the reef west of the Shag. It was in a slanting direction, and did not move; he could not doubt that the ship had struck on the dangerous rocks at the entrance of the bay; and as his eyes became more accustomed to the unusual light, and made out what objects were or were not familiar, he could perceive the ship herself. He looked with the glass, but could see no one on board, nor were any boats in sight; but observing some of the lesser rocks, he beheld some moving figures on them. Help!--instant help!--was his thought; and he looked towards the Cove. Lights were in the cottage windows, and a few sounds came up to him, as if the fishing population were astir.",guy run court west side house struggle slope face wind sweep length gain summit come rush such force stand keep ground gaze sea swell fearful mark silver light side catch moonbeam black shade other alternate eye fix moment spray leapt high whiteness stand hard bold black wave thunder burst cliff high stand spray dash blind face wind howl gather might very purpose wrench cliff stand firm look discern think see mast vessel see light silvery distance sea reef slant direction move doubt ship strike dangerous rock entrance bay eye become accustom unusual light make object familiar perceive ship look glass see board boat sight observe less rock beheld move figure help instant help thought look light cottage window few sound come fishing population astir 
26,"He hastened to the side of the cliff, which was partly clothed with brushwood. There was a descent--it could hardly be called a path--which no one ventured to attempt but himself and a few of the boldest birds’-nesting boys of the village; but he could lose no time, and scrambling, leaping, swinging himself by the branches, he reached the foot of the cliff in safety, and in five minutes more was on the little quay at the end of the steep street of the Cove.",hasten side cliff cloth brushwood be descent call path venture attempt few bold bird nest boy village lose time scramble leap swing branch reach foot cliff safety minute more little quay end steep street 
27,"The quay was crowded with the fisher-people, and there was a strange confusion of voices; some saying all was lost; some that the crew had got to the rock; others, that some one ought to put off and help them; others, that a boat would never live in such a sea; and an old telescope was in great requisition.",quay crowd fisher person be strange confusion voice say lose crew get rock other one ought put help other boat live sea old telescope great requisition 
28,"Ben Robinson, a tall, hardy young man, of five-and-twenty, wild, reckless, high-spirited and full of mischief and adventure, was standing on a pile at the extreme verge above the foaming water, daring the others to go with him to the rescue; and, though Jonas Ledbury, a feeble old man, was declaring, in a piteous tone, it was a sin and a shame to let so many poor creatures be lost in sight, without one man stirring to help them; yet all stood irresolute, watching the white breakers dashing on the Shag, and the high waves that swelled and rolled between.",tall hardy young man wild reckless high spirit full mischief adventure stand pile extreme verge foaming water dare other go rescue feeble old man declare piteous tone sin shame let many poor creature lose sight man stir help stand irresolute watch white breaker dash high wave swell roll

31,"‘Ay, ay!’ said old Ledbury. ‘Poor creatures! there they be; and what is to be done, I can’t say! I never saw a boat in such a sea, since the night poor Jack, my brother, was lost, and Will Ray with him.’",say old poor creature do say see boat sea night poor brother lose 
32,"‘I see them,’ said Guy, who had in the meantime looked through his glass. ‘How soon is high water?’",see say have meantime look glass high water 
33,"It was an important question, for the rocks round the Shag were covered before full tide, even when the water was still. There was a looking up at the moon, and then Guy and the fishermen simultaneously exclaimed, that it would be in three hours; which gave scarcely an hour to spare.",important question rock cover full tide water be look moon fisherman exclaim hour give hour spare 
34,"Without another word, Guy sprang from the quay to the boat-house, unlocked it, and, by example, showed that the largest boat was to be brought out. The men helped him vigorously, and it stood on the narrow pebbly beach, the only safe landing-place in the whole bay; he threw into it a coil of rope, and called out in his clear commanding voice--‘Five to go with me!’",word guy spring quay boat house unlock example show large boat bring man help stand narrow pebbly beach only safe landing place whole bay throw coil rope call clear commanding voice go 
35,"Hanging back was at an end. They were brave men, who had wanted nothing but a leader, and with Sir Guy at their head, were ready for anything. Not five, but five-and-twenty were at his command; and even in the hurry of the moment, a strong, affectionate feeling filled his eyes with tears as he saw these poor fellows ready to trust their lives in his hands.",hang end brave man want leader head ready command hurry moment strong affectionate feeling fill eye tear see poor fellow ready trust life hand

38,"‘It would be best to have a second boat,’ said Guy. ‘Mr. Brown,’ to the owner of the telescope, ‘will you lend yours? ‘tis the strongest and lightest. Thank you. Martin had best steer it, he knows the rocks;’ and he went on to name the rest of the crew; but at the last there was a moment’s pause, as if he doubted.",good have second boat say guy owner telescope lend strong light thank good steer know rock go name rest crew last be moment pause doubt

42,"‘All ready,--yes, sir!’",ready sir 
43,"The boat was launched, not without great difficulty, in the face of such a sea. The men stoutly took their oars, casting a look forward at the rocks, then at the quay, and on the face of their young steersman. Little they guessed the intense emotion that swelled in his breast as he took the helm, to save life or to lose it; enjoying the enterprise, yet with the thought that his lot might be early death; glad it was right thus to venture, earnest to save those who had freely trusted to him, and rapidly, though most earnestly, recalling his own repentance. All this was in his mind, though nothing was on his face but cheerful resolution.",boat launch great difficulty face sea man take oar cast look rock quay face young steersman little guess intense emotion swell breast take helm save life lose enjoy enterprise thought lot early death glad right venture earnest save trust recall own repentance mind face cheerful resolution 
44,"Night though it was, tidings of the wreck had reached the upper part of the village; and Mr. Ashford, putting his head out of his window to learn the cause of the sounds in the street, was informed by many voices that a ship was on the Shag reef, and that all were lost. To hasten to the Cove to learn the truth, and see if any assistance could yet be afforded, was his instant thought; and he had not taken many steps before he was overtaken by a square, sturdy figure, wrapped in an immense great-coat.",night tiding wreck reach upper part village put head window learn cause sound street inform many voice ship reef lose hast learn truth see assistance afford instant thought take many step overtake square sturdy figure wrap immense great coat

46,"‘Why, ay,’ said Markham, roughly, though not with the repellent manner usual with him towards Mr. Ashford, ‘I must be there, or that boy will be in the thickest of it.

49,"Comparing the reports they had heard, the clergyman and steward walked on, Markham’s anxiety actually making him friendly. They reached the top of the steep street of the Cove; but though there was a good view of the sea from thence, they could distinguish nothing, for another cloud was rising, and had obscured the moon. They were soon on the quay, now still more crowded, and heard the exclamations of those who were striving to keep their eyes on the boats.",comparing report hear clergyman steward walk anxiety make friendly reach top steep street be good view sea thence distinguish cloud rise obscure moon quay crowded hear exclamation striving keep eye boat

52,"Markham seemed to derive some relief from railing at the fishermen, singly and collectively, while Mr. Ashford tried to learn the real facts, and gather opinions as to the chance of safety. The old fishermen held that there was frightful risk, though the attempt was far from hopeless; they said the young men were all good at their oars, Sir Guy knew the rocks very well, and the chief fear was, that he might not know how to steer in such a sea; but they had seen that, though daring, he was not rash. They listened submissively to Mr. Markham, but communicated in an under-tone to the vicar, how vain it would have been to attempt to restrain Sir Guy.",seem derive relief rail fisherman try learn real fact gather opinion chance safety old fisherman hold be frightful risk attempt hopeless say young man good oar know rock chief fear know steer sea see dare rash listen communicate tone vicar vain attempt restrain

I wish it may be the steadying of Ben!’",sir say old man pleased melancholy look brave be difference do lark dare rest do thought right wish steadying 
58,"The shower rushed over them again, shorter and less violent than the former one, but driving in most of the crowd, and only leaving on the quay the vicar, the steward, and a few of the most anxious fishermen. They could see nothing; for the dark slanting line of rain swept over the waves, joining together the sea and thick low cloud; and the roaring of the sea and moaning of the wind were fearful. No one spoke, till at last the black edges of the Shag loomed clearer, the moon began to glance through the skirts of the cloud, and the heaving and tossing of the sea, became more discernible.",shower rush short violent former one drive most crowd leave quay vicar steward few anxious fisherman see dark slant line rain sweep wave join sea thick low cloud roaring sea moan wind fearful speak last black edge loom clear moon begin glance skirt cloud heaving tossing sea become discernible

Over the roaring waters came at length the sound of voices, a cheer, pitched in a different key from the thunder of wind and wave; they almost fancied they knew the voice that led the shout.

The Shag and its attendant rocks, and the broken vessel, were bathed in the clear morning light; the sky was of a beautiful blue, with magnificent masses of dark cloud, the edges, where touched by the sunbeams, of a pearly white; and across the bay, tracing behind them glittering streams of light, came up the two boats with their freight of rescued lives.

92,"‘I enjoyed it too much to have anything to say for myself,’ said Guy; ‘besides, we must see after these poor men. There were two or three nearly drowned. Is no one gone for Mr. Gregson?’",enjoy much have say say guy see poor man be drown go 
93,"Mr. Gregson, the doctor, was already present, and no one who had any authority could do anything but attend to the disposal of the shipwrecked crew. Mr. Ashford went one way, Markham another, Guy a third; but, between one cottage and another, Mr. Ashford learnt some particulars. The crew had been found on a flat rock and the fishermen had at first thought all their perils in vain, for it was impossible to bring the boats up, on account of the rocks, which ran out in a long reef. Sir Guy, who knew the place, steered to the sheltered spot where he had been used to make fast his own little boat, and undertook to make his way from thence to the rock where the crew had taken refuge, carrying a rope to serve as a kind of hand-rail, when fastened from one rock to the other. Ben insisted on sharing his peril, and they had crept along the slippery, broken reefs, lashed by the surge, for such a distance, that the fishermen shuddered as they spoke of the danger of being torn off by the force of the waves, and dashed against the rocks. Nothing else could have saved the crew. They had hardly accomplished the passage through the rising tide, even with the aid of the rope and the guidance of Sir Guy and Ben, and, before the boats had gone half a mile on their return, the surge was tumbling furiously over the stones where they had been found.",doctor present have authority do attend disposal shipwreck crew go way third cottage learn particular crew find flat rock fisherman think peril vain impossible bring boat account rock run long reef know place steer shelter spot use make own little boat undertake make way thence rock crew take refuge carry rope serve kind hand rail fasten rock other insist share peril creep slippery break reef lash surge distance fisherman shudder speak danger tear force wave dash rock else save crew accomplish passage rise tide aid rope guidance boat go mile return surge tumble stone find 
94,"The sailors were safely disposed of, in bed, or by the fireside, the fishers vying in services to them. Mr. Ashford went to the cottage of Charity Ledbury, Jem’s mother, to inquire for the boy with the broken arm. As he entered the empty kitchen, the opposite door of the stairs was opened, and Guy appeared, stepping softly, and speaking low.",sailor dispose bed fireside fisher vie service go cottage mother inquire boy break arm enter empty kitchen opposite door stair open appear step speak low

Good-bye!’,past be bell beginning think go tell excited remember church go morning glad find minute late make haste good

102,"‘May you?’ said Mr. Ashford, smiling. ‘Is it wise, with all your wet things?’",say smile wise wet thing

104,"‘Of course I will’ said Mr. Ashford, with much emotion. ‘The danger must have been great.’",course say much emotion danger great 
105,"‘It was,’ said Guy, as if the strong feeling would show itself. ‘It was most merciful. That little boat felt like a toy at the will of the winds and waves, till one recollected who held the storm in His hand.’",say strong feeling show merciful little boat feel toy will wind wave recollect hold storm hand 
106,"He spoke very simply, as if he could not help it, with his eye fixed on the clear eastern sky, and with a tone of grave awe and thankfulness which greatly struck Mr. Ashford, from the complete absence of self-consciousness, or from any attempt either to magnify or depreciate his sense of the danger.",speak help eye fix clear eastern sky tone grave awe thankfulness strike complete absence self consciousness attempt magnify depreciate sense danger

108,"‘It was not. The fishermen, who were used to such things, did not think much of it; but I am glad to have been out on such a night, if only for the magnificent sensation it gives to realize one’s own powerlessness and His might.

There must be a great deal of good in him, if one only knew how to get hold of it.’",bad look step time want know be fine fellow behave regular hero thorough contempt love danger read be great deal good know get hold 
111,"‘Look there!’ was Mr. Ashford’s answer, as he turned his head at the church wicket; and, at a short distance behind, Guy saw Ben himself walking up the path, with his thankful, happy father, a sight that had not been seen for months, nay, for years.",look answer turn head church wicket short distance see walk path thankful happy father sight see month year

114,"After church, Guy walked fast away; Mr. Ashford went home, made a long breakfast, having the whole story to tell, and was on to the scene of action again, where he found the master, quite restored, and was presently joined by Markham. Of Sir Guy, there was no news, except that Jem Ledbury said he had looked in after church to know how the cabin boy was going on, and the master, understanding that he had been the leader in the rescue, was very anxious to thank him, and walked up to the house with Markham and Mr. Ashford.",church walk go make long breakfast have whole story tell scene action find master restore join be news say look church know cabin boy go master understanding leader rescue anxious thank walk house 
115,"Markham conducted them straight to the library, the door of which was open. He crossed the room, smiled, and made a sign to Mr. Ashford, who looked in some surprise and amusement. It has been already said that the room was so spacious that the inhabited part looked like a little encampment by the fire, though the round table was large, and the green leather sofa and arm chair were cumbrous.",conduct library door open cross room smile make sign look surprise amusement say room spacious inhabit part look little encampment fire round table large green leather sofa arm chair cumbrous 
116,"However, old Sir Guy’s arm-chair was never used by his grandson; Markham might sit there, and Bustle did sometimes, but Guy always used one of the unpretending, unluxurious chairs, which were the staple of the room. This, however, was vacant, and on the table before it stood the remains of breakfast, a loaf reduced to half its dimensions, an empty plate and coffee-cup. The fire was burnt down to a single log, and on the sofa, on all the various books with which it was strewed, lay Guy, in anything but a comfortable position, his head on a great dictionary, fairly overcome with sleep, his very thick, black eyelashes resting on his fresh, bright cheek, and the relaxation of the grave expression of his features making him look even younger than he really was. He was so sound asleep that it was not till some movement of Markham’s that he awoke, and started up, exclaiming,--",old arm chair use grandson sit guy use unpretending unluxurious chair staple room vacant table stand remains breakfast loaf reduce dimension empty plate coffee cup fire burn single log sofa various book strew lay guy comfortable position head great dictionary overcome sleep thick black eyelashe rest fresh bright cheek relaxation grave expression feature make look young sound asleep movement awoke start exclaim

123,"‘I beg your pardon, sir!’ said the captain, while they all laughed, ‘I did not guess you could be so young a gentleman.

All our lives are owing to you, sir.’",beg pardon sir say captain laugh guess young gentleman sure sir man proud do see add fresh start honour life ow sir 
124,"Guy did not cut him short, though very glad when it was over. He felt he should not, in the captain’s place, like to have his thanks shortened, and besides, if ever there was happiness or exultation, it was in the glistening eyes of old Markham, the first time he had ever been able to be justly proud of one of the family, whom he loved with so much faithfulness and devotion.",guy cut short glad feel captain place like have thanks shorten be happiness exultation glisten eye old first time able proud family love much faithfulness devotion
