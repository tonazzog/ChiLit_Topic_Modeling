5,"I can only regretfully admit that, sooner or later as we grow up to be men and women, there are bound to be many fond illusions which are one by one ruthlessly dispelled, and that many of the dreams and thoughts which, in our younger days, we cherish most dearly, the hard, matter-of-fact world will always persist in describing as “a pack of nonsense.” However, for many of us fortunately, this tiresome time has not yet arrived, and for the present we will refuse to give up our poor dear Wallypug—for whom I declare I have as great an affection and regard, as the most enthusiastic of my young readers.",admit grow man woman be bound many fond illusion dispell many dream thought young day cherish hard matter fact world persist describe pack nonsense many tiresome time arrive present refuse give poor dear declare have great affection regard enthusiastic young reader
