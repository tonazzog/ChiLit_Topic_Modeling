3,"For many days after this Jack applied himself with unremitting assiduity to the construction of our boat, which at length began to look somewhat like one.  But those only who have had the thing to do can entertain a right idea of the difficulty involved in such an undertaking, with no other implements than an axe, a bit of hoop-iron, a sail-needle, and a broken pen-knife.  But Jack did it.  He was of, that disposition which _will_ not be conquered.  When he believed himself to be acting rightly, he overcame all obstacles.  I have seen Jack, when doubtful whether what he was about to do were right or wrong, as timid and vacillating as a little girl,--and I honour him for it!",many day apply unremitt assiduity construction boat length begin look have thing do entertain right idea difficulty involve undertaking other implement axe bit hoop iron sail needle break pen-knife do disposition conquer believe act overcame obstacle see doubtful about do right wrong timid vacillate little girl honour 
4,"As this boat was a curiosity in its way, a few words here relative to the manner of its construction may not be amiss.",boat curiosity way few word relative manner construction amiss 
5,"I have already mentioned the chestnut tree with its wonderful buttresses or planks.  This tree, then, furnished us with the chief part of our material.  First of all Jack sought out a limb of a tree of such a form and size as, while it should form the keel a bend at either end should form the stem and stern posts.  Such a piece, however, was not easy to obtain, but at last he procured it, by rooting up a small tree which had a branch growing at the proper angle about ten feet up its stem, with two strong roots growing in such a form as enabled him to make a flat-sterned boat.  This placed, he procured three branching roots of suitable size, which he fitted to the keel at equal distances, thus forming three strong ribs.  Now, the squaring and shaping of these, and the cutting of the grooves in the keel, was an easy enough matter, as it was all work for the axe, in the use of which Jack was become wonderfully expert; but it was quite a different affair when he came to nailing the ribs to the keel, for we had no instrument capable of boring a large hole, and no nails to fasten them with.  We were, indeed, much perplexed here; but Jack at length devised an instrument that served very well.  He took the remainder of our hoop-iron and beat it into the form of a pipe or cylinder, about as thick as a man's finger.  This he did by means of our axe and the old rusty axe we had found at the house of the poor man at the other side of the island.  This, when made red hot, bored slowly though the timbers; and, the better to retain the heat, Jack shut up one end of it and filled it with sand.  True, the work was very slowly done, but it mattered not--we had little else to do.  Two holes were bored in each timber, about an inch and a half apart, and also down into the keel, but not quite through.  Into these were placed stout pegs made of a tree called iron-wood; and, when they were hammered well home, the timbers were as firmly fixed as if they had been nailed with iron.  The gunwales, which were very stout, were fixed in a similar manner.  But, besides the wooden nails, they were firmly lashed to the stem and stern posts and ribs by means of a species of cordage which we had contrived to make out of the fibrous husk of the cocoa nut.  This husk was very tough, and when a number of the threads were joined together they formed excellent cordage.  At first we tied the different lengths together, but this was such a clumsy and awkward complication of knots, that we contrived, by careful interlacing of the ends together before twisting, to make good cordage of any size or length we chose.  Of course it cost us much time and infinite labour, but Jack kept up our spirits when we grew weary, and so all that we required was at last constructed.",mention chestnut tree wonderful buttress plank tree furnish chief part material first seek limb tree form size form keel bend end form stem stern post piece easy obtain last procure root small tree have branch grow proper angle foot stem strong root grow form enable make flat stern boat place procure branching root suitable size fit keel equal distance form strong rib squaring shaping cutting groove keel easy enough matter work axe use become expert different affair come nail rib keel have instrument capable boring large hole nail fast perplex length devise instrument serve take remainder hoop iron beat form pipe cylinder thick man finger do means axe old rusty axe find house poor man other side island make red hot bored timber good retain heat shut end fill sand true work do matter have little else do hole bored timber inch half keel place stout peg make tree call iron wood hammer timber fix nail iron gunwale stout fix similar manner wooden nail lash stem stern post rib means species cordage contrive make fibrous husk cocoa nut husk tough number thread join form excellent cordage tie different length clumsy awkward complication knot contrive careful interlacing end twist make good cordage size length choose course cost much time infinite labour keep spirit grow weary require last construct 
6,"Planks were now cut off the chestnut trees of about an inch thick.  These were dressed with the axe,--but clumsily, for an axe is ill adapted for such work.  Five of these planks on each side were sufficient, and we formed the boat in a very rounded, barrel-like shape, in order to have as little twisting of the planks as possible; for, although we could easily bend them, we could not easily twist them.  Having no nails to rivet the planks with, we threw aside the ordinary fashion of boat building and adopted one of our own.  The planks were therefore placed on each other's edges, and sewed together with the tough cordage already mentioned.  They were also thus sewed to the stem, the stern, and the keel.  Each stitch or tie was six inches apart, and was formed thus: Three holes were bored in the upper plank and three in the lower,--the holes being above each other, that is, in a vertical line.  Through these holes the cord was passed, and, when tied, formed a powerful stitch of three ply.  Besides this, we placed between the edges of the planks, layers of cocoa-nut fibre, which, as it swelled when wetted, would, we hoped, make our little vessel water-tight.  But in order further to secure this end, we collected a large quantity of pitch from the bread-fruit tree, with which, when boiled in our old iron pot, we payed the whole of the inside of the boat, and, while it was yet hot, placed large pieces of cocoa-nut cloth on it, and then gave it another coat above that.  Thus the interior was covered with a tough water-tight material; while the exterior, being uncovered, and so exposed to the swelling action of the water, was we hoped, likely to keep the boat quite dry.  I may add that our hopes were not disappointed.",plank cut chestnut tree inch thick dress axe axe ill adapt such work plank side sufficient form boat round barrel like shape order have little twisting plank possible bend twist have nail rivet plank throw ordinary fashion boat building adopt own plank place other edge sew tough cordage mention sew stem stern keel stitch tie inch form hole bored upper plank low hole other vertical line hole cord pass tie form powerful stitch ply place edge plank layer cocoa nut fibre swell wett hope make little vessel water tight order secure end collect large quantity pitch bread fruit tree boil old iron pot pay whole inside boat hot place large piece cocoa nut cloth give coat interior cover tough water tight material exterior uncover expose swell action water hope likely keep boat dry add hope disappoint 
7,"While Jack was thus engaged, Peterkin and I sometimes assisted him, but, as our assistance was not much required, we more frequently went a-hunting on the extensive mud-flats at the entrance of the long valley which lay nearest to our bower.  Here we found large flocks of ducks of various kinds, some of them bearing so much resemblance to the wild ducks of our own country that I think they must have been the same.  On these occasions we took the bow and the sling, with both of which we were often successful, though I must confess I was the least so.  Our suppers were thus pleasantly varied, and sometimes we had such a profusion spread out before us that we frequently knew not with which of the dainties to begin.",engage assist assistance require go -hunting extensive mud flat entrance long valley lay near bower find large flock duck various kind bear much resemblance wild duck own country think same occasion take bow sling successful confess least supper varied have profusion spread know dainty begin 
8,"I must also add, that the poor old cat which we had brought home had always a liberal share of our good things, and so well was it looked after, especially by Peterkin, that it recovered much of its former strength, and seemed to improve in sight as well as hearing.",add poor old cat bring have liberal share good thing look recover much former strength seem improve sight hearing

10,"The large flat stone, or rock of coral, which stood just in front of the entrance to our bower, was our table.  On this rock we had spread out the few articles we possessed the day we were shipwrecked; and on the same rock, during many a day afterwards, we spread out the bountiful supply with which we had been blessed on our Coral Island.  Sometimes we sat down at this table to a feast consisting of hot rolls,--as Peterkin called the newly baked bread fruit,--a roast pig, roast duck, boiled and roasted yams, cocoa nuts, taro, and sweet potatoes; which we followed up with a dessert of plums, apples, and plantains,--the last being a large- sized and delightful fruit, which grew on a large shrub or tree not more than twelve feet high, with light-green leaves of enormous length and breadth.  These luxurious feasts were usually washed down with cocoa-nut lemonade.",large flat stone rock coral stand front entrance bower table rock spread few article possess day shipwreck same rock day spread bountiful supply bless coral sit table feast consist hot roll call bake bread fruit roast pig roast duck boil roast yam cocoa nut taro sweet potato follow dessert plum apple plantain last large sized delightful fruit grow large shrub tree more foot high light green leave enormous length breadth luxurious feast wash cocoa nut lemonade 
11,"Occasionally Peterkin tried to devise some new dish,--""a conglomerate,"" as he used to say; but these generally turned out such atrocious compounds that he was ultimately induced to give up his attempts in extreme disgust.  Not forgetting, however, to point out to Jack that his failure was a direct contradiction to the proverb which he, Jack, was constantly thrusting down his throat, namely, that ""where there's a will there's a way.""  For he had a great will to become a cook, but could by no means find a way to accomplish that end.",try devise new dish conglomerate use say turn such atrocious compound induce give attempt extreme disgust forget point failure direct contradiction proverb thrust throat be will be way have great will become cook means find way accomplish end 
12,"One day, while Peterkin and I were seated beside our table on which dinner was spread, Jack came up from the beach, and, flinging down his axe, exclaimed,--",day seat table dinner spread come beach fling axe exclaim 
13,"""There, lads, the boat's finished at last! so we've nothing to do now but shape two pair of oars, and then we may put to sea as soon as we like.""",lad boat finish last have do shape pair oar put sea like 
14,"This piece of news threw us into a state of great joy; for although we were aware that the boat had been gradually getting near its completion, it had taken so long that we did not expect it to be quite ready for at least two or three weeks.  But Jack had wrought hard and said nothing, in order to surprise us.",piece news throw state great joy aware boat get completion take expect ready least week wring say order surprise 
15,"""My dear fellow,"" cried Peterkin, ""you're a perfect trump.  But why did you not tell us it was so nearly ready? won't we have a jolly sail to- morrow? eh?""",dear fellow cry perfect trump tell ready have jolly sail 
16,"""Don't talk so much, Peterkin,"" said Jack; ""and, pray, hand me a bit of that pig.""",talk say pray hand bit pig 
17,"""Certainly, my dear,"" cried Peterkin, seizing the axe; ""what part will you have? a leg, or a wing, or a piece of the breast; which?""",dear cry seize axe part have leg wing piece breast 
18,"""A hind leg, if you please,"" answered Jack; ""and, pray, be so good as to include the tail.""",hind leg answer pray good include tail 
19,"""With all my heart,"" said Peterkin, exchanging the axe for his hoop-iron knife, with which he cut off the desired portion.  ""I'm only too glad, my dear boy, to see that your appetite is so wholesale; and there's no chance whatever of its dwindling down into re-tail again, at least in so far as this pig is concerned.  Ralph, lad, why don't you laugh?--eh?"" he added turning suddenly to me with a severe look of inquiry.",heart say exchang axe hoop iron knife cut desire portion glad dear boy see appetite wholesale be chance dwindling re-tail least pig concerned laugh add turn severe look inquiry 
20,"""Laugh?"" said I; ""what at, Peterkin? why should I laugh?""",laugh say laugh 
21,"Both Jack and Peterkin answered this inquiry by themselves laughing so immoderately that I was induced to believe I had missed noticing some good joke, so I begged that it might be explained to me; but as this only produced repeated roars of laughter, I smiled and helped myself to another slice of plantain.",answer inquiry laugh induce believe miss notice good joke begg explain produce repeat roar laughter smile help slice plantain 
22,"""Well, but,"" continued Peterkin, ""I was talking of a sail to-morrow. Can't we have one, Jack?""",continue talk sail have 
23,"""No,"" replied Jack, ""we can't have a sail, but I hope we shall have a row, as I intend to work hard at the oars this afternoon, and, if we can't get them finished by sunset we'll light our candle-nuts, and turn them out of hands before we turn into bed.""",reply have sail hope have row intend work oar afternoon get finish sunset light candle nut turn hand turn bed 
24,"""Very good,"" said Peterkin, tossing a lump of pork to the cat, who received it with a mew of satisfaction.  ""I'll help you, if I can.""",good say toss lump pork cat receive mew satisfaction help 
25,"""Afterwards,"" continued Jack, ""we will make a sail out of the cocoa-nut cloth, and rig up a mast, and then we shall be able to sail to some of the other islands, and visit our old friends the penguins.""",continue make sail cocoa nut cloth rig mast able sail other island visit old friend penguin 
26,"The prospect of being so soon in a position to extend our observations to the other islands, and enjoy a sail over the beautiful sea, afforded us much delight, and, after dinner, we set about making the oars in good earnest.  Jack went into the woods and blocked them roughly out with the axe, and I smoothed them down with the knife, while Peterkin remained in the bower, spinning, or, rather, twisting some strong thick cordage with which to fasten them to the boat.",prospect position extend observation other island enjoy sail beautiful sea afford much delight dinner set make oar good earnest go wood block axe smooth knife remain bower spinn twist strong thick cordage fast boat 
27,"We worked hard and rapidly, so that, when the sun went down, Jack and I returned to the bower with four stout oars, which required little to be done to them save a slight degree of polishing with the knife.  As we drew near we were suddenly arrested by the sound of a voice!  We were not a little surprised at this--indeed I may almost say alarmed--for, although Peterkin was undoubtedly fond of talking, we had never, up to this time, found him talking to himself.  We listened intently, and still heard the sound of a voice as if in conversation.  Jack motioned me to be silent, and, advancing to the bower on tip-toe, we peeped in.",work sun go return bower stout oar require little do save slight degree polish knife draw arrest sound voice little surprise say alarm fond talk time find talk listen hear sound voice conversation motion silent advance bower tip toe peep 
28,"The sight that met our gaze was certainly not a little amusing.  On the top of a log which we sometimes used as a table, sat the black cat, with a very demure expression on its countenance; and in front of it, sitting on the ground, with his legs extended on either side of the log, was Peterkin.  At the moment we saw him he was gazing intently into the cat's face, with his nose about four inches from it,--his hands being thrust into his breeches pockets.",sight meet gaze little amusing top log use table sit black cat demure expression countenance front sit ground leg extend side log moment see gaze cat face nose inch hand thrust breeche pocket

30,"There was a pause, as if Peterkin awaited a reply to this affectionate declaration but the cat said nothing.",be pause await reply affectionate declaration cat say

32,"To this touching appeal the cat said ""Mew,"" faintly.",touch appeal cat say 
33,"""Ah! that's right.  You're a jolly old rascal.  Why did you not speak at once? eh?"" and Peterkin put forward his mouth and kissed the cat on the nose!",right jolly old rascal speak put mouth kiss cat nose 
34,"""Yes,"" continued Peterkin, after a pause, ""I love you.  D'you think I'd say so if I didn't, you black villain?  I love you because I've got to take care of you, and to look after you, and to think about you, and to see that you don't die--""",continue pause love think say black villain love get take care look think see die-- 
35,"""Mew, me-a-w!"" said the cat.",say cat 
36,"""Very good,"" continued Peterkin, ""quite true, I have no doubt; but you've no right to interrupt me, sir.  Hold your tongue till I have done speaking.  Moreover, cat, I love you because you came to me the first time you ever saw me, and didn't seem to be afraid, and appeared to be fond of me, though you didn't know that I wasn't going to kill you.  Now, that was brave, that was bold, and very jolly, old boy, and I love you for it--I do!""",good continue true have doubt have right interrupt sir hold tongue do speak cat love come first time see seem afraid appear fond know go kill brave bold jolly old boy love do 
37,"Again there was a pause of a few minutes, during which the cat looked placid, and Peterkin dropped his eyes upon its toes as if in contemplation.  Suddenly he looked up.",be pause few minute cat look placid drop eye toe contemplation look 
38,"""Well, cat, what are you thinking about now? won't speak? eh?  Now, tell me; don't you think it's a monstrous shame that these two scoundrels, Jack and Ralph, should keep us waiting for our supper so long?""",cat think speak tell think monstrous shame scoundrel keep wait supper 
39,"Here the cat arose, put up its back and stretched itself; yawned slightly, and licked the point of Peterkin's nose!",cat arise put back stretch yawn lick point nose 
40,"""Just so, old boy, you're a clever fellow,--I really do believe the brute understands me!"" said Peterkin, while a broad grin overspread his face, as he drew back and surveyed the cat.",old clever fellow believe brute understand say broad grin overspread face draw survey cat 
41,"At this point Jack burst into a loud fit of laughter.  The cat uttered an angry fuff and fled, while Peterkin sprang up and exclaimed,--",point burst loud fit laughter cat utter angry fuff flead spring exclaim 
42,"""Bad luck to you, Jack! you've nearly made the heart jump out of my body, you have.""",bad luck make heart jump body have 
43,"""Perhaps I have,"" replied Jack, laughing, as we entered the bower, ""but, as I don't intend to keep you or the cat any longer from your supper, I hope that you'll both forgive me.""",reply laugh enter bower intend keep cat supper hope forgive 
44,"Peterkin endeavoured to turn this affair off with a laugh, but I observed that he blushed very deeply at the time we discovered ourselves, and he did not seem to relish any allusion to the subject afterwards; so we refrained from remarking on it ever after,--though it tickled us not a little at the time.",endeavour turn affair laugh observe blush time discover seem relish allusion subject refrain remark tickle little time 
45,"After supper we retired to rest and to dream of wonderful adventures in our little boat, and distant voyages upon the sea.",supper retire rest dream wonderful adventure little boat distant voyage sea
