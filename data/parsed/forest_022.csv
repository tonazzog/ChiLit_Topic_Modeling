1,CHAPTER XXII.,
2," Edward was certain that Mr. Langton would not have advised him to leave London if he had not considered that it was dangerous to remain. He therefore first called upon the Hamburgh merchant, who, upon his explanation, gave him a letter of credit to a friend who resided in the city of York; and then returned to the hotel, packed up his saddle-bags, paid his reckoning, and, mounting his horse, set off on the northern road. As it was late in the afternoon before he was clear of the metropolis, he did not proceed farther than Barnet, where he pulled up at the inn. As soon as he had seen his horse attended to, Edward, with his saddle-bags on his arm, went into the room in the inn where all the travelers congregated. Having procured a bed, and given his saddle-bags into the charge of the hostess, he sat down by the fire, which, although it was warm weather, was nevertheless kept alight.",certain advise leave consider dangerous remain call merchant explanation give letter credit friend reside city return hotel pack saddle bag pay reckoning mount horse set northern road afternoon clear metropolis proceed pull inn see horse attend saddle bag arm go room inn traveler congregate procure bed give saddle bag charge hostess sit fire warm weather keep alight 
3,"Edward had made no alteration in the dress which he had worn since he had been received in the house of Mr. Heatherstone. It was plain, although of good materials. He wore a high-crowned hat, and, altogether, would, from his attire, have been taken for one of the Roundhead party. His sword and shoulder-belt were indeed of more gay appearance than those usually worn by the Roundheads; but this was the only difference.",make alteration dress wear receive house plain good material wear high crown hat attire take sword shoulder belt gay appearance wear only difference 
4,"When Edward first entered the room, there were three persons in it, whose appearance was not very prepossessing. They were dressed in what had once been gay attire, but which now exhibited tarnished lace, stains of wine, arid dust from traveling. They eyed him as he entered with his saddle-bags, and one of them said--",enter room be person appearance prepossessing dress gay attire exhibit tarnish lace stain wine arid dust travel eye enter saddle bag say 
5,"""That's a fine horse you were riding, sir. Has he much speed?""",fine horse ride sir much speed

11,Edward did not choose to reply; he folded his arms and looked at the man with contempt.,choose reply fold arm look man contempt 
12,"The hostess, who had overheard the conversation, now called for her husband, and desired him to go into the room and prevent any further insults to the young gentleman who had just come in. The host, who knew the parties, entered the room, and said--",hostess overhear conversation call husband desire go room prevent further insult young gentleman come host know party enter room say 
13,"""Now you'll clear out of this as fast as you can; be off with you, and go to the stables, or I'll send for somebody whom you will not like.""",clear go stable send like 
14,"The three men rose and swaggered, but obeyed the host's orders, and left the room.",man rise swagger obey host order leave room 
15,"""I am sorry, young master, that these roisterers should have affronted you, as my wife tells me that they have. I did not know that they were in the house. We can not well refuse to take in their horses; but we know well who they are, and, if you are traveling far, you had better ride in company.""",sorry young master roisterer affront wife tell know house refuse take horse know travel have good ride company 
16,"""Thank you for your caution, my good host,"" replied Edward; ""I thought that they were highwaymen, or something of that sort.""",thank caution good host reply think highwaymen sort 
17,"""You have made a good guess, sir; but nothing has yet been proved against them, or they would not be here. In these times we have strange customers, and hardly know who we take in. You have a good sword there, sir, I have no doubt; but I trust that you have other arms.""",make good guess sir prove time have strange customer know take have good sword sir have doubt trust have other arm 
18,"""I have,"" replied Ed ward, opening his doublet, and showing his pistols.",reply open doublet show pistol 
19,"""That's right, sir. Will you take any thing before you go to bed?""",right sir take thing go bed 
20,"""Indeed I will, for I am hungry; any thing will do, with a pint of wine.""",hungry thing do pint wine 
21,"As soon as he had supped, Edward asked the hostess for his saddle-bags, and went up to his bed.",supp ask hostess saddle bag go bed 
22,"Early the next morning he rose and went to the stable to see his horse fed. The three men were in the stables, but they did not say any thing to him. Edward returned to the inn, called for breakfast, and as soon as he had finished, took out his pistols to renew the priming. While so occupied, he happened to look up, and perceived one of the men with his face against the window, watching him. ""Well, now you see what you have to expect, if you try your trade with me,"" thought Edward. ""I am very glad that you have been spying."" Having replaced his pistols, Edward paid his reckoning, and went to the stable, desiring the hostler to saddle his horse and fix on his saddle-bags. As soon as this was done, he mounted and rode off. Before he was well clear of the town, the highwaymen cantered past him on three well-bred active horses. ""I presume we shall meet again,"" thought Edward, who for some time cantered at a gentle pace, and then, as his horse was very fresh, he put him to a faster pace, intending to do a long day's work. He had ridden about fifteen miles, when he came to a heath, and, as he continued at a fast trot, he perceived the three highwaymen about a quarter of a mile in advance of him; they were descending a hill which was between them, and he soon lost sight of them again. Edward now pulled up his horse to let him recover his wind, and walked him gently up the hill. He had nearly gained the summit when he heard the report of firearms, and soon afterward a man on horseback, in full speed, galloped over the hill toward him. He had a pistol in his hand, and his head turned back. The reason for this was soon evident, as immediately after him appeared the three highwaymen in pursuit. One fired his pistol at the man who fled, and missed him. The man then fired in return, and with true aim, as one of the highwaymen fell. All this was so sudden, that Edward had hardly time to draw his pistol and put spurs to his horse, before the parties were upon him, and were passing him. Edward leveled at the second highwayman as he passed him, and the man fell. The third highwayman, perceiving this, turned his horse to the side of the road, cleared a ditch, and galloped away across the heath. The man who had been attacked had pulled up his horse when Edward came to his assistance, and now rode up to him, saying,",next morning rise go stable see horse feed man stable say thing return inn call breakfast finish take pistol renew priming occupy happen look perceive man face window watch see have expect try trade think glad spying replace pistol pay reckoning go stable desire hostler saddle horse fix saddle bag do mount ride clear town highwaymen canter breed active horse presume meet think time canter gentle pace horse fresh put fast pace intend do long day work ride mile come heath continue fast trot perceive highwaymen quarter mile advance descend hill lose sight pull horse let recover wind walk hill gain summit hear report firearm man horseback full speed gallop hill have pistol hand head turn reason evident appear highwaymen pursuit fire pistol man flead miss man fire return true aim highwaymen fall sudden have time draw pistol put spur horse party pass level second highwayman pass man fall third highwayman perceive turn horse side road clear ditch gallop heath man attack pull horse come assistance ride say 
23,"""I have to thank you, sir, for your timely aid; for these rascals were too many for me.""",have thank sir timely aid rascal many 
24,"""You are not hurt, I trust, sir?"" replied Edward. ""No, not the least; the fellow singed my curls though, as you may perceive. They attacked me about half a mile from here. I was proceeding north when I heard the clatter of hoofs behind me; I looked round and saw at once what they were, and I sprung my horse out of the road to a thicket close to it, that they might not surround me. One of the three rode forward to stop my passage, and the other two rode round to the back of the thicket to get behind me. I then saw that I had separated them, and could gain a start upon them by riding back again, which I did, as fast as I could, and they immediately gave chase. The result you saw. Between us we have broken up the gang; for both these fellows seem dead, or nearly so.""",hurt trust sir reply least fellow sing curl perceive attack mile proceed hear clatter hoof look see spring horse road thicket surround ride stop passage other ride back thicket get see separate gain start ride do give chase result see break gang fellow seem dead 
25,"""What shall we do with them?""",do 
26,"""Leave them where they are,"" replied the stranger. ""I am in a hurry to get on. I have important business at the city of York, and can not waste my time in depositions, and such nonsense. It is only two scoundrels less in the world, and there's an end of the matter.""",leave reply stranger hurry get have important business city waste time deposition such nonsense scoundrel less world be end matter 
27,"As Edward was equally anxious to proceed, he agreed with the stranger, that it was best to do as he proposed.",anxious proceed agree stranger good do propose 
28,"""I am also going north,"" replied Edward, ""and am anxious to get there as soon as I can.""",go reply anxious get 
29,"""With your permission we will ride together,"" said the stranger. ""I shall be the gainer, as I shall feel that I have one with me who is to be trusted to in case of any further attacks during our journey.""",permission ride say stranger gainer feel have trust case further attack journey 
30,"There was such a gentlemanlike, frank, and courteous air about the stranger, that Edward immediately assented to his proposal, of their riding in company for mutual protection. He was a powerful, well-made man, of apparently about one or two-and-twenty, remarkably handsome in person, dressed richly, but not gaudily, in the Cavalier fashion, and wore a hat with a feather. As they proceeded, they entered into conversation on indifferent matters for some time, neither party attempting by any question to discover who his companion might be. Edward had more than once, when the conversation flagged for a minute, considered what reply he should give in case his companion should ask him the cause of his journey, and at last had made up his mind what to say.",be gentlemanlike frank courteous air stranger assent proposal riding company mutual protection powerful make man handsome person dress fashion wear hat feather proceed enter conversation indifferent matter time party attempt question discover companion have more conversation flagge minute consider reply give case companion ask cause journey last make mind say 
31,"A little before noon they pulled up to bait their horses at a small village; the stranger observing that he avoided St. Alban's, and all other large towns, as he did not wish to satisfy the curiosity of people, or to have his motions watched; and therefore, if Edward had no objection, he knew the country so well, that he could save time by allowing him to direct their path. Edward was, as may be supposed, very agreeable to this, and, during their whole journey, they never entered a town, except they rode through it after dark; and put up at humble inns on the roadside, where, if not quite so well attended to, at all events they were free from observation.",little noon pull bait horse small village stranger observe avoid other large town wish satisfy curiosity person have motion watch have objection know country save time allow direct path suppose agreeable whole journey enter town ride dark put humble inn roadside attend event free observation 
32,"It was, however, impossible that this reserve could continue long, as they became more and more intimate every day. At last the stranger said,",impossible reserve continue become intimate day last stranger say 
33,"""Master Armitage, we have traveled together for some time, interchanging thoughts and feelings, but with due reserve as respects ourselves and our own plans. Is this to continue? If so, of course you have but to say so; but if you feel inclined to trust me, I have the same feeling toward you. By your dress I should imagine that you belonged to a party to which I am opposed; but your language and manners do not agree with your attire; and I think a hat and feathers would grace that head better than the steeple-crowned affair which now covers it. It may be that the dress is only assumed as a disguise: you know best. However, as I say, I feel confidence in you, to whatever party you may belong, and I give you credit for your prudence and reserve in these troubled times. I am a little older than you, and may advise you; and I am indebted to you, and can not therefore betray you--at least I trust you believe so.""",travel time interchang thought feeling due reserve respect own plan continue course have say feel inclined trust have same feeling dress imagine belong party oppose language manners agree attire think hat feather grace head good steeple crown affair cover dress assume disguise know good say feel confidence party belong give credit prudence reserve troubled time little old advise indebted betray least trust believe

35,"""I believe that,"" replied Chaloner; ""and I can not help thinking you are bound north on the same business as myself, which is, I confess to you honestly, to strike a blow for the king. If you are on the same errand, I have two old relations in Lancashire, who are stanch to the cause; and I am going to their house to remain until I can join the army. If you wish it, you shall come with me, and I will promise you kind treatment and safety while under their roof.""",believe reply help think bind same business confess strike blow king same errand have old relation stanch cause go house remain join army wish come promise kind treatment safety roof

37,"""Nay, you shall have them; for when I trust, I trust wholly. Their name is Conynghame.""",have trust trust name 
38,"Edward took his letters from out of his side-pocket, and handed one of them to his fellow-traveler. The address was, ""To the worthy Mistress Conynghame, of Portlake, near Bolton, county of Lancashire.""",take letter side pocket hand fellow traveler address worthy 
39,"""It is to that address that I am going myself,"" said Edward, smiling. ""Whether it is the party you refer to, you best know.""",address go say smile party refer know

43,"""You are right,"" answered Chaloner, ""and you are of my opinion. I know now that you have both prudence and courage. The first quality has been scarcer with us Cavaliers than the last; however, now, all reserve is over, at least on my part.""",right answer opinion know have prudence courage first quality scarcer last reserve least part 
44,"""And on mine also,"" replied Edward. Chaloner then talked about the chances of the war. He stated that King Charles's army was in a good state of discipline, and well found in everything; that there were hundreds in England who would join it, as soon as it had advanced far enough into England; and that every thing wore a promising appearance.",reply talk chance war state army good state discipline find be hundred join advance thing wear promising appearance 
45,"""My father fell at the battle of Naseby, at the head of his retainers,"" said Chaloner, after a pause; ""and they have contrived to fine the property, so that it has dwindled from thousands down to hundreds. Indeed, were it not for my good old aunts, who will leave me their estates, and who now supply me liberally, I should be but a poor gentleman.""",father fall battle head retainer say pause contrive fine property dwindle thousand hundred good old aunt leave estate supply poor gentleman

52,"""I have spoken the truth,"" replied Edward; ""and have now said so much that I must, to remove your suspicion say more than perhaps I should have done. My name is not Armitage, although I have been so called for some time. You have set me the example of confidence, and I will follow it. My father was Colonel Beverley, of Prince Rupert's troop.""",speak truth reply say much remove suspicion say more do name call time set example confidence follow father troop 
53,Chaloner started with astonishment.,start astonishment 
54,"""I'm sure that what you say is true,"" at last said he; ""for I was thinking who it was that you reminded me of. You are the very picture of your father. Although a boy at the time, I knew him well, Master Beverley; a more gallant Cavalier never drew sword. Come, we must be sworn friends in life and death, Beverley,"" continued Chaloner, extending his hand, which was eagerly grasped by Edward, who then confided to Chaloner the history of his life. When he had concluded, Chaloner said,",sure say true last say think remind very picture father boy time know gallant draw sword come swear friend life death continue extend hand grasp confide history life conclude say 
55,"""We all heard of the firing of Arnwood, and it is at this moment believed that all the children perished.

You must not conceal your name to your sovereign; the very name of Beverley is a passport, but the son of Colonel Beverley will be indeed welcomed. Why, the very name will be considered as a harbinger of good fortune. Your father was the best and truest soldier that ever drew sword; and his memory stands unrivaled for loyalty and devotion. We are near to the end of our journey; yonder is the steeple of Bolton church.

59,"Late in the evening they arrived at Portlake, a grand old mansion situated in a park crowded with fine old timber. Chaloner was recognized, as they rode up the avenue, by one of the keepers, who hastened forward to announce his arrival; and the domestics had opened the door for them before they arrived at it. In the hall they were met by the old ladies, who expressed their delight at seeing their nephew, as they had had great fear that something had happened to him.",evening arrive grand old mansion situate park crowd fine old timber recognize ride avenue keeper hasten announce arrival domestics open door arrive hall meet old lady express delight see nephew have great fear happen

65,"One of the ladies produced the letters, which Chaloner, as he read them, handed over to Edward for his perusal. They were from General Middleton, and some other friends of Chaloner's who were with the army, giving him information as to what was going on, and what their prospects were supposed to be.",lady produce letter read hand perusal other friend army give information go prospect suppose 
66,"""You see that they have marched already,"" said Chaloner, ""and I think the plan is a good one, and it has put General Cromwell in an awkward position. Our army is now between his and London, with three days' march in advance. And we shall now be able to pick up our English adherents, who can join us without risk, as we go along. It has been a bold step, but a good one; and if they only continue as well as they have begun, we shall succeed. The Parliamentary army is not equal to ours in numbers, as it is; and we shall add to ours dayly.
