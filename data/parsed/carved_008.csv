1,"CHAPTER VIII. ""NOBODY--_NOBODY_.""",
2," The history of that first week might stand for the history of several months at Green Bank. That is why I have related it as clearly as possible. In one sense I suppose people would say my life grew easier to me, that is to say I got more accustomed to it, but with the ""growing accustomed,"" increased the loss of hope and spring, so I doubt if time did bring any real improvement.",history first week stand history several month green relate possible sense suppose person say life grow easy say get accustom grow accustom increase loss hope spring doubt time bring real improvement 
3,"I became very dull and silent. I seemed to be losing the power of complaining, or even of wishing for sympathy. I took some interest in my lessons, and almost the only pleasure I had was when I got praise for them. But that did not often happen, not as often as it should have done, I really believe. For the prejudice against me on the part of the upper teachers did not wear off. And I can see now that I must have been a disagreeable child.",become dull silent seem lose power complain wish sympathy take interest lesson only pleasure have get praise happen do believe prejudice part upper teacher wear see disagreeable child

6,"The Christmas holidays came and went, without much improving matters. I spent them at school with one or two other pupils, much older than I. Miss Broom went away, and we were under Miss Aspinall's charge, for Miss Ledbury had caught a bad cold and her niece would not leave her. I preferred Miss Aspinall to Miss Broom certainly, but I had half hoped that Miss Fenmore would have stayed. She too went away, however, having got a ""holiday engagement,"" which she was very glad of she told me when she bade me good-bye. I did not understand what she meant, beyond hearing that she was glad to go, so I said nothing about being sorry.",holiday come go much improve matter spend school other pupil old go charge catch bad cold niece leave prefer half hope stay go get holiday engagement glad tell bid good bye understand mean hear glad go say sorry

9,"It was very, very dull, but I felt as if I did not mind. Even mamma's letters once a fortnight gave me only a kind of tantalising pleasure, for I knew I dared not _really_ answer them. The only thing I felt glad of was that she did not know how lonely and unhappy I was, and that she never would do so till the day--the day which I could scarcely believe would ever, _ever_ come--when I should see her again, and feel her arms round me, and know that all the misery and loneliness were over!",dull feel mind mamma letter fortnight give kind tantalise pleasure know answer only thing feel glad know lonely unhappy do day day believe come see feel arm know misery loneliness 
10,"Some new pupils came after the Christmas holidays, and one or two of the elder girls did not return. But the new boarders were older than I and took no notice of me, so their coming made no difference. One event, however, did interest me--that was the appearance at certain classes two or three times a week of a very sweet-looking little girl about my own age. She was pretty and very nicely dressed, though by no means showily, and her tone of voice and way of speaking were different from those of most of my companions. I wished she had come altogether, and then I might have made friends with her. ""Only,"" I said to myself unselfishly, ""she would most likely be as unhappy as I am, so I shouldn't wish for it.""",new pupil come holiday elder girl return new border old take notice coming make difference event interest appearance certain class time week sweet look little girl own age dress means tone voice way speak different most companion wish come make friend say unhappy wish 
11,"One of the classes she came to was the French one--the class which, as I have said, Miss Fenmore taught. And Miss Fenmore seemed to know her, for she called her by her Christian name--""Myra."" The first time I heard it I felt quite puzzled. I knew I had heard it before, though I could not remember where or when, except that it was not very long ago. And when I heard her last name, ""Raby""--""Miss Raby"" one of the other teachers called her--and put the two together--""Myra Raby""--I felt more and more certain I had heard them spoken of before, though I was equally certain I had never seen the little girl herself.",class come french one class say teach seem know call christian name first time hear feel puzzled know hear remember hear last name other teacher call put feel certain hear speak certain see little girl 
12,"I might have asked Miss Fenmore about her, but it did not enter into my head to do so: that was one of my odd childish ways. And it was partly, too, that I was growing more and more reserved and silent. Even to Harriet Smith I did not talk half as much as at first, and she used to tell me I was growing sulky.",ask enter head do odd childish way grow reserve silent talk half much first use tell grow sulky 
13,"I took great interest in watching for Myra's appearance. I daresay if I could make a picture of her now she would seem a quaint old-fashioned little figure to you, but to me she seemed perfectly lovely. She had pretty brown hair, falling in ringlets round her delicate little face; her eyes were gray, very soft and gentle, and she had a dear little rosebud of a mouth. She was generally dressed in pale gray merino or cashmere, with white lace frilled round the neck and short sleeves--all little girls wore short sleeves then, even in winter; and once when I caught a glimpse of her getting into a carriage which was waiting for her at the door, I was lost in admiration of her dark green cloth pelisse trimmed with chinchilla fur.",take great interest watch appearance make picture seem quaint old fashioned little figure seem lovely have brown hair fall ringlet delicate little face eye gray soft gentle have dear little rosebud mouth dress pale gray merino cashmere white lace frill neck short sleeve little girl wear short sleeve winter catch glimpse get carriage wait door lose admiration dark green cloth pelisse trim chinchilla fur 
14,"""She must be somebody very rich and grand,"" I thought. But I had no opportunity of getting to know more of her, than a nice little smile or a word or two of thanks if I passed her a book at the class or happened to sit next her. For she always left immediately after the lesson was over.",rich grand think have opportunity get know more nice little smile word thanks pass book class happen sit leave lesson 
15,"Up to Easter she came regularly. Then we had three weeks' holidays, and as before, Miss Fenmore went away. She was pleased to go, but when she said good-bye to me I thought she looked sad, and she called me ""my poor little girl.""",come have week holiday go pleased go say good bye think look sad call poor little girl

19,"She looked still graver at this. I fancy she saw that what I said was true. I was growing dulled and stupefied, as it were, for want of any one to sympathise with me or draw me out, though I did not know quite how to put this in words. As I have said before, I was not a child with much power of expression.",look graver fancy see say true grow dull stupefy want one sympathise draw know put word say child much power expression

22,"""Thank you,"" I answered.

23,"They came to an end at last, however, but among the returning governesses and pupils there was no Miss Fenmore. Nor did Myra Raby come again to the classes she used to attend. I wondered to myself why it was so, but for some time I knew nothing about Miss Fenmore, and in the queer silent way which was becoming my habit I did not ask. At last one day a new governess made her appearance, and then I overheard some of the girls saying she was to take Miss Fenmore's place. A sort of choke came into my throat, and for the first time I realised that I _had_ been looking forward to the pretty young governess's return.",come end last return governess pupil come class use attend wonder time know queer silent way become habit ask last day new governess make appearance overhear girl say take place sort choke come throat first time realise look young governess return 
24,"I do not remember anything special happening for some time after that. I suppose Easter must have been early that year, for when the events occurred which I am now going to relate, it was still cold and wintry weather--very rainy at least, and Mexington was always terribly gloomy in rainy weather. It seems a long stretch to look back upon--those weeks of the greatest loneliness I had yet known--but in reality I do not think it could have been more than three or four.",remember special happen time suppose early year event occur go relate cold wintry weather rainy least gloomy rainy weather seem long stretch look week great loneliness know reality think more 
25,"I continued to work steadily--even hard--at my lessons. I knew that it would please mamma, and I had a vague feeling that somehow my getting on fast might shorten the time of our separation, though I could not have said why. I was really interested in some of my lessons, and anxious to do well even in those I did not like. But I was not quick or clever, and often, very often, my hesitation in expressing myself made me seem far less intelligent than I actually was. Still I generally got good marks, especially for _written_ tasks, for the teachers, though hard and strict, were not unprincipled. They did not like me, but they were fair on the whole, I think.",continue work lesson know please mamma have vague feeling get shorten time separation say interested lesson anxious do like quick clever hesitation express make seem intelligent get good mark _written_ task teacher hard strict unprincipled like fair whole think 
26,"Unluckily, however, about this time I got a bad cold. I was not seriously ill, but it hung about me for some time and made me feel very dull and stupid. I think, too, it must have made me a little deaf, though I did not know it at the time. I began to get on less well at lessons, very often making mistakes and replying at random, for which I was scolded as if I did it out of carelessness.",time get bad cold ill hang time make feel dull stupid think make little deaf know time begin get lesson make mistake reply random scold do carelessness

28,"At last one day they came to a point. I forget what the lesson was, and it does not matter, but every time a question came to me I answered wrongly. Once or twice I did not hear, and when I said so, Miss Broom, whose class it was, was angry, and said I was talking nonsense. It ended in my bursting into tears, which I had never done before in public since I had been at Green Bank.",last day come point forget lesson matter time question come answer hear say class angry say talk nonsense end burst tear do public green

34,"Arrived there, I flung myself on to the end of my bed. It was cold, and outside it was raining, raining--it seems to me now that it never left off raining at Mexington that spring; the sky, if I had looked out of the window, was one dull gray sheet. But I seemed to care for nothing--just at first the comfort of being able to cry with no one to look at me was all I wanted. So I lay there sobbing, though not loudly.",arrive flung end bed cold rain rain seem leave rain spring sky look window dull gray sheet seem care first comfort able cry look want lay sobb 
35,"After some little time had passed the downstairs bell rang--it was afternoon, and the bell meant, I knew, preparation for tea. So I was not very surprised when the door opened and Emma and Harriet came in--they were both kind, Harriet especially, though her kindness was chiefly shown by loud abuse of Miss Broom.",little time pass downstairs bell ring afternoon bell mean know preparation tea surprised door open come kind kindness show loud abuse 
36,"""You'd better take care, Harry,"" said her sister at last, ""or you'll be getting into disgrace yourself, which certainly won't do Gerry any good.

41,"I got up slowly and tried to wash away some of the traces of my tears by plunging my face in cold water. Then Harriet helped me to smooth my hair and make myself look neat. Emma's words had had the effect of making me resolve to cry no more if I could help it. And a moment or two later I was glad I had followed her advice, for one of the elder girls came to our room with a message to say that I was to go down to tea, and after tea I was to stay behind in the dining-room as Miss Aspinall wished to speak to me.",get try wash trace tear plung face cold water help smooth hair make look neat word have effect make resolve cry more help moment glad follow advice elder girl come room message say go tea tea stay dining room wish speak

47,"Nor did I feel nervous or frightened when Miss Aspinall--all the others having gone--seated herself in front of me and began her talk. It began quite differently from what I had expected. She was a good woman, and not nearly so bad-tempered as Miss Broom, though hard and cold, and I am sure she meant to do me good. She talked about how changed I had been of late, my lessons so much less well done, and how careless and inattentive I seemed. There was some truth in it.

48,"""And worst of all,"" continued the governess, ""you have got into such a habit of making excuses that it really amounts to telling untruths. Several times, Miss Broom tells me, you have done a wrong lesson or not done one at all, and you have maintained to her that you had not been told what you _had_ been told--there was something about your French poetry yesterday, which you _must_ have known you were to learn.

She had not been told not to speak to me, very likely the teachers thought I would be asleep, and she was very curious to know what had passed. I told her all.

It was such a bad climate where he'd gone--lots of people got ill and died there, unless they were rich enough to live out of the town, and he didn't suppose any one who'd only been a clerk in the bank here would be that. And Emma said, couldn't your papa and mamma come back if they got ill, and he said if they waited till then it would be rather too late.

I could have screamed aloud. I felt I could not bear it--I must write to mamma a letter that nobody should read. I must see somebody who would tell me the truth--Haddie, perhaps, knew more than I did. If I could go to him! But I had no money and no idea of the way, and Miss Aspinall would never, _never_ let me even write to ask him.
