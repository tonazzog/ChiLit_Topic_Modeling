1,CHAPTER XXXVIII. HUGH JOHN'S BLIGHTED HEART.,blighted heart 
2," On the first evening at home Hugh John put on his new straw hat with its becoming school ribbon of brown, white and blue, for he did not forget that Prissy had described Cissy Carter as ""such a pretty girl."" Now pretty girls are quite nice when they are jolly. What a romp he would have, and even the stile would not be half bad.",first evening home put new straw hat become school ribbon brown white blue forget describe pretty girl pretty girl nice jolly romp have stile bad 
3,"He ran down to the landing-stage, having given his old bat and third best fishing-rod to his brother to occupy his attention. Toady Lion was in an unusually adoring frame of mind, chiefly owing to the new bat with the silver inscription which Hugh John had brought home with him. If that were Toady Lion's attitude, how would it be with the enthusiastic Cissy Carter? She must be more than sixteen now. He liked grown-up girls, he thought, so long as they were pretty. And Cissy was pretty, Prissy had distinctly said so.",run landing stage give old bat third good fishing rod brother occupy attention adoring frame mind ow new bat silver inscription bring attitude enthusiastic more like grow girl think pretty say 
4,"The white punt bumped against the landing-stage, but the brown was gone. However, he could see it at the other side, swaying against the new pier which Mr. Davenant Carter had built opposite to that of Windy Standard. This was another improvement; you used to have to tie the boat to a bush of bog-myrtle and jump into wet squashy ground. The returned exile sculled over and tied up the punt to an iron ring.",white punt bump landing stage brown gone see other side sway new pier build windy improvement use have tie boat bush bog myrtle jump wet squashy ground return exile scull tie punt iron ring 
5,"Then with a high and joyous heart he started over the moor, taking the well-beaten path towards Oaklands.",high joyous heart start moor take beat path 
6,"Suddenly, through the wood as it grew thinner and more birchy, he saw the gleam of a white dress. Two girls were walking--no, not two girls, Prissy and a young lady.",wood grow thin birchy see gleam white dress girl walk girl young lady 
7,"""Oh hang!"" said Hugh John to himself, ""somebody that's stopping with the Carters. She'll go taking up all Cissy's time, and I wanted to see such a lot of her.""",hang say stop go take time want see lot 
8,The white dresses and summer hats walked composedly on.,white dress summer hat walk 
9,"""I tell you what,"" said Hugh John to himself, ""I'll scoot through the woods and give them a surprise.""",tell say sceak wood give surprise 
10,"And in five minutes he leaped from a bank into the road immediately before the girls. Prissy gave a little scream, threw up her hands, and then ran eagerly to him.",minute leap bank road girl prissy give little scream throw hand run 
11,"""Why, Hugh John,"" she cried, ""have you really come? How could you frighten us like that, you bad boy!""",cry come frighten bad boy 
12,"And she kissed him--well, just as Prissy always did.",kiss 
13,"Meanwhile the young lady had turned partly away, and was pulling carelessly at a leaf--as if such proceedings, if not exactly offensive, were nevertheless highly uninteresting.",young lady turn pull leaf such proceedings offensive uninteresting 
14,"""Cissy,"" called Priscilla at last, ""won't you come and shake hands with Hugh John.""",call last come shake hand 
15,The girl turned slowly. She was robed in white linen belted with slim scarlet. The dress came quite down to the tops of her dainty boots. She held out her hand.,girl turn robe white linen belt slim scarlet dress come top dainty boot hold hand 
16,"""How do you do--ah, Mr. Smith?"" she said, with her fingers very much extended indeed.",do say finger extend 
17,"Hugh John gasped, and for a long moment found no word to say.",gasp long moment find word say 
18,"""Why, Cissy, how you've grown!"" he cried at length. But observing no gleam of fellow-feeling in his quondam comrade's eyes, he added somewhat lamely, ""I mean how do you do, Miss--Miss Carter?""",grow cry length observe gleam fellow feeling quondam comrade eye add mean do 
19,"There was silence after this, as the three walked on together, Prissy talking valiantly in order to cover the long and distressful silences. Hugh John's usual bubbling river of speech was frozen upon his lips. He had a thousand things to tell, a thousand thousand to ask. But now it did not seem worth while to speak of one. Why should a young lady like this, with tan gloves half-way to her elbows and the shiniest shoes, with stockings of black silk striped with red, care to hear about his wonderful bat for the three-figure score at cricket, or the fact that he had won the golf medal by doing the round in ninety-five? He had even thought of taking some credit (girls will suck in anything you tell them, you know) for his place in his class, which was seventh. But he had intended to suppress the fact that the fifth form was not a very large one at St. Salvator's.",be silence walk talk order cover long distressful silence usual bubble river speech freeze lip have thing tell ask seem worth while speak young lady tan glove half way elbow shiniest shoe stocking black silk stripe red care hear wonderful bat figure score cricket fact win golf medal do round think take credit girl suck tell know place class seventh intend suppress fact fifth form large one 
20,"But now he suddenly became conscious that these trivialities could not possibly interest a young lady who talked about the Hunt Ball in some such fashion as this: ""He is _such_ a nice partner, don't you know! He dances--oh, like an angel, and the floor was--well, just perfection!""",become conscious triviality interest young lady talk such fashion nice partner know dance angel floor perfection 
21,"Hugh John did not catch the name of this paragon; but he hated the beast anyhow. He did not know that Cissy was only bragging about her bat, and cracking up her score at golf.",catch name paragon hate beast know brag bat crack score golf 
22,"""Have you seen 'The White Lady of Avenel' at the Sobriety Theatre, Mr. Smith?"" she said, suddenly turning to him.",see white say turn 
23,"""No,"" grunted Hugh John, ""but I've seen the Drury Lane pantomime. It was prime!""",grunt see pantomime prime 
24,"The next moment he was sorry he had said it. But the truth slipped out before he knew. For so little was Hugh John used to the society of grown-up big girls, that he did not know any better than to tell them the truth.",next moment sorry say truth slip know little use society grow big girl know good tell truth 
25,"""Ah, yes!"" commented Cissy Carter condescendingly, ""I used quite to like going to pantomimes when I was a child!""",comment use go pantomime child 
26,"A slight and elegant young man, with a curling moustache turned up at the ends, came towards them down the bank. He had grey-and-white striped trousers on, a dark cutaway coat, and a smart straw hat set on the back of his head. He wore gloves and walked with a pretty cane. Hugh John loathed him on sight.",slight elegant young man curling moustache turn end come bank have grey white stripe trousers dark cutaway coat smart straw hat set back head wear glove walk pretty cane loath sight 
27,"""Good-evening, Courtenay,"" said Cissy familiarly, ""this is my friend, Prissy Smith, of whom you have heard me speak; and this is her brother just home from school!""",good evening say friend hear speak brother school 
28,"(""What a beast! I hate him! Calls that a moustache, I daresay. Ha, ha! he should just see Ashwell Major's. And I can lick Ashwell Major with one hand!"")",beast hate call moustache see lick hand 
29,"""Aw,"" said the young man with the cane, superciliously stroking his maligned upper lip, ""the preparatory school, I daresay--Lord, was at one once myself--beastly hole!""",say young man cane stroke malign upper lip preparatory school beastly hole 
30,"(""I don't doubt it, you look it,"" was Hugh John's mental note.) Aloud he said, ""Saint Salvator's is a ripping place. We beat Glen Fetto by an innings and ninety-one!""",doubt look mental note say rip place beat inning 
31,Mr. Courtenay Carling took no notice. He was talking earnestly and confidentially to his cousin. Hugh John had had enough of this.,take notice talk cousin have enough 
32,"""Come on, Priss,"" he said roughly, ""let's go home.""",come say let go 
33,"Prissy was nothing loath. She was just aching to get him by himself, so that she might begin to burn incense at his manly shrine. She had had stacks of it ready, and the match laid for weeks and weeks.",prissy loath ach get begin burn incense manly shrine have stack ready match lay week week 
34,"""Good-night,"" said Cissy frigidly. Hugh John took hold of her dainty gloved fingers as gingerly as if each had been a stinging nettle, and dropped them as quickly. Mr. Courtenay Carling paused in his conversation just long enough to say over his shoulder, ""Ah--ta-ta--got lots of pets to run round and see, I s'pose--rabbits and guinea-pigs; used to keep 'em myself, you know, beastly things, ta-ta!""",good night say take hold dainty glove finger sting nettle drop pause conversation say shoulder get lot pet run see s'pose rabbit guinea pig use keep know beastly thing 
35,"And with Cissy by his side he moved off, alternately twirling his moustache and glancing approvingly down at her. Cissy on her part never once looked round, but kept poking her parasol into the plants at the side of the road, as determinedly as if it had been the old pike manufactured by the exiled king O'Donowitch. Such treatment could not have been at all good for such a miracle of silk and lace and cane; but somehow its owner did not seem to mind.",side move twirl moustache glance part look keep poke parasol plant side road old pike manufacture exile king such treatment good miracle silk lace cane owner seem mind 
36,"""What an awful brute!"" burst out Hugh John, as soon as Prissy and he were clear.",awful brute burst clear 
37,"""Oh, how _can_ you say so!"" said Prissy, much surprised; ""why, every one thinks him so nice. He has such lots of money, and is going to stand for Parliament--that is, if his uncle would only die, or have something happen to him!""",say say surprise one think nice have such lot money go stand uncle die have happen 
38,"Her brother snorted, as if to convey his contempt for ""everybody's"" opinion on such a matter; but Prissy was too happy to care for aught save the fact that once more her dear Hugh John was safe at home.",brother snort convey contempt opinion matter happy care aught save fact more dear safe home 
39,"""Do you know,"" she said lovingly, ""I could not sleep last night for thinking of your coming! It is so splendid. There's the loveliest lot of roses being planted in the new potting house, and I've got a pearl necklace to show you--such a beauty--and----""",know say sleep last night think coming splendid be loveliest lot rose plant new potting house get pearl necklace show beauty 
40,"Thus she rattled on, joyously ticking off all the things she had to show him. She ran a little ahead to look at him, then ran as quickly back to hug him. ""Oh, you dear!"" she exclaimed. And all the while the heart of the former valiant soldier sank deep and ever deeper into the split-new cricketing shoes he had been so proud of when he sallied forth to meet Cissy Carter by the stile.",rattle tick thing have show run little look run hug dear exclaim heart former valiant soldier sink deep deep split new cricketing shoe proud sall meet stile 
41,"""Come on,"" she cried presently, picking up her skirts. ""I'm so excited I don't know what to do. I can't keep quiet. I believe I can race you yet, for all you're so big and have won a silver cricket bat. How I shall love to see it! Come on, Hugh John, I'll race you to the gipsy camp for a pound of candy!""",come cry pick skirt excited know do keep quiet believe race big win silver cricket bat love see come race gipsy camp pound candy 
42,"But Hugh John did not want to race. He did not want _not_ to race. He did not want ever to do anything any more--only to fade away and die. His heart was cold and dead within him. He felt that he would never know happiness again. But he could not bear to disappoint Prissy the first night. Besides, he could easily enough beat her--he was sure of that. So he smiled indulgently and nodded acquiescence. He had not told her that he had won the school mile handicap from scratch.",want race want _not_ race want do more fade die heart cold dead feel know happiness bear disappoint first night beat sure smile nod acquiescence tell win school mile handicap scratch 
43,"They started, and Hugh John began to run scientifically, as he had been taught to do at school, keeping a little behind Prissy, ready to spurt at the last and win by a neck. Doubtless this would have answered splendidly, only that Prissy ran so fast. She did not know anything about scientific sprinting, but she could run like the wind. So by the time they reached the Partan Burn she had completely outclassed Hugh John. With her skirts held high in her hand over she flew like a bird; but her brother, jumping the least bit too soon, went splash into the shallows, sending the water ten feet into the air.",start begin run teach do school keep little ready spurt last win neck answer run know scientific sprinting run wind time reach outclass skirt hold hand fly bird brother jump least bit go splash shallow send water foot air 
44,"Like a shot Prissy was back, and reached a hand down to the vanquished scientific athlete.",shot reach hand vanquish scientific athlete 
45,"""Oh, I'm so sorry, Hugh John,"" she said; ""I ought to have told you it had been widened. Don't let's race any more. I think I must have started too soon, and you'd have beaten me anyway. Here's the gipsy camp.""",sorry say tell widen let race more think start beat gipsy camp 
46,"The world-weary exile looked about him. He had thought that at least it might be some manly pleasure to see Billy Blythe once more, and try a round with the Bounding Brothers. After all, what did it matter about girls? He had a twelve-bladed knife in his pocket which he intended for Billy, and he knew a trick of boxing--a feint with the right, and then an upward blow with the left, which he knew would interest his friend.",world weary exile look think least manly pleasure see try round matter girl have blade knife pocket intend know trick boxing feint right upward blow left know interest friend 
47,But the tents were gone. The place where they had stood was green and unencumbered. Only an aged crone or two moved slowly about among the small thatched cottages. To one of these Hugh John addressed himself.,tent gone place stand green unencumbered aged crone move small thatch cottage address 
48,"""Eh, master--Billy Blythe--why, he be 'listed for a sodger--a corp'ral they say he be, and may be sergeant by this time, shouldn't wonder. Eh, dearie, and the Boundin' Brothers--oh! ye mean the joompin' lads. They're off wi' a circus in Ireland. Nowt left but me and my owd mon! Thank ye, sir, you be a gentleman born, as anybody can see without the crossin' o' the hand.""",master list sodger corp'ral say sergeant time wonder mean joompin lad will circus leave owd mon thank gentleman bear see crossin hand 
49,"Sadly Hugh John moved away, a still more blighted being. He left Prissy at the white lodge-gate in order that she might go home to meet Mr. Picton Smith on his return from the county town, where he had been judging the horses at an agricultural show. He would take a walk through the town, he said to himself, and perhaps he might meet some of his old enemies. He felt that above everything he would enjoy a sharp tussle. After all what save valour was worth living for? Wait till he was a soldier, and came back in uniform with a sword by his side and the scar of a wound on his forehead--would Cissy Carter despise him then? He would show her! In the meantime he had learned certain tricks of fence which he would rather like to prove on the countenances of his former foes.",move blight being leave white lodge gate order go meet return county town judge horse agricultural show take walk town say meet old enemy feel enjoy sharp tussle save valour worth live wait soldier come uniform sword side scar wound forehead despise show meantime learn certain trick fence like prove countenance former foe 
50,"So with renewed hope in his heart he took his way through the town of Edam. The lamps were just being lighted, and Hugh John lounged along through the early dusk with his hands in his pockets, looking out for a cause of offence. Presently he came upon a brilliantly lighted building, into which young men and women were entering singly and in pairs.",renew hope heart take way town lamp light lounge early dusk hand pocket look cause offence come light building young man woman enter singly pair 
51,A hanging lamp shone down upon a noticeboard. He had nothing better to do. He stopped and read--,hanging lamp shine noticeboard have good do stop read

53,"Hugh John did not accept the invitation, perhaps because he had no hymn-book. He only waited outside to hear Mr. N. Donnan's opening sentence. It ran thus: ""All ages of the world's history have borne testimony to the fact that peace is preferable to war, right to might, and the sweet still voice of Reason to the savage compulsions of brutal Force.""",accept invitation have hymn book wait hear open sentence run age world history borne testimony fact peace preferable war right sweet voice reason savage compulsion brutal force 
54,"""Oh, hang!"" ejaculated Hugh John, doubling his fist; ""did you ever hear such rot? I wish I could jolly well fetch Nipper Donnan one on the nob!""",hang ejaculate double fist hear such rot wish fetch nob 
55,"And he sauntered on till he came to the burying-ground of Edam's ancient abbey. He wandered aimlessly up the short avenue, stood at the gate a while, then kicked it open and went in. He clambered about among the graves, stumbling over the grassy mounds till he came to the tombs of his ancestors. At least they were not quite his ancestors, but the principle was the same. ""There's nothing exclusive about me. I'll adopt them,"" said Hugh John to himself, as many another distinguished person had done before him. They were in fact the tombs of the Lorraines, the ancient possessors and original architects of the Castle of Windy Standard, which he had spilt his best blood to defend. Well, it was to attack. But no matter.",saunter come burying ground ancient abbey wander short avenue stand gate while kick open go clamber grave stumble grassy mound come tomb ancestor least ancestor principle same be exclusive adopt say many distinguished person do fact tomb ancient possessor original architect windy spilt good blood defend attack matter 
56,"He sat down and looked at the defaced and battered tombs in silence. Mighty thoughts coursed through his brain. His heart was filled full to the brim with the sadness of mortality. Tears of hopeless resignation stood in his eyes. It was the end, the solemn end of all. Soon he, too, like them, would be lying low and quiet. He began to be conscious of a general fatal weakness of the system, a hollowness of the chest (or stomach), which showed that the end was near.",sit look deface batter tomb silence mighty thought course brain heart fill full brim sadness mortality tear hopeless resignation stand eye end solemn end like lie low quiet begin conscious general fatal weakness system hollowness chest stomach show end 
57,"Ah, they would be sorry then--_she_ would be sorry! And after morning service in church, they would come and stand by his grave and say--_she_ would say, ""He was young, but he lived nobly, though, alas! there was none to appreciate him. Ah, would that he were again alive!"" Then they (she) would weep, yes, weep bitterly, and fling themselves (herself) upon the cold, cold ground. But all in vain. He (Hugh John Picton Smith, late hero) would lie still in death under that green sod and never say a word. No, not even if he could. Like Brer Fox, he would lie low. At this point Hugh John was so moved that he put his face down into his hands and sobbed.",sorry sorry morning service church come stand grave say say young live be appreciate alive weep weep fling cold cold ground vain late hero lie death green sod say word lie low point move put face hand sobb 
58,"A heavy clod of earth whizzed through the air and impacted itself with a thud upon the mourner's cheek, filling his ear with mud and sand, and informing him at the same instant that it carried a stone concealed somewhere about its person.",heavy clod earth whizz air impact thud mourner cheek fill ear mud sand inform same instant carry stone conceal person 
59,"For though Nipper Donnan was now Vice-President of a Mutual Improvement Association, and at that moment spreading himself in a peroration upon the advantages of universal goody-goodiness, he had, happily for society and Hugh John, left exceedingly capable successors. The eternal Smoutchy was still very much alive, and still an amateur of clods in the town of Edam.",mutual moment spread peroration advantage universal goody goodiness society leave capable successor eternal alive amateur clod town

61,"He rose like a shot. Few and short were the prayers he said, but what these petitions lacked in length they made up for in fervency. He pursued his assailant down the Mill Brae, clamoured after him round the Town-yards, finally cornered him at the Spital Port, punched his head soundly--and felt better.",rise shot few short prayer say petition lack length make fervency pursue assailant clamoure yard corner spital punch head feel good 
62,"So that night the unfortunate young martyr to the flouts and scorns of love, instead of occupying a clay-cold bier with his (adopted) ancestors in Edam Abbey graveyard, ate an excellent supper in the new house of Windy Standard, with three helpings of round-of-beef and vegetables to match. Then with an empty heart, but a full stomach, he betook himself upstairs to his room, where presently Toady Lion came to worship, and Prissy dropped in to see that all was well. She had spread prettily worked covers of pink silk over his brushes and combs, an arrangement which the hero contemplated with disgust.",night unfortunate young martyr flout scorn love occupy clay cold bier adopt ancestor graveyard eat excellent supper new house windy helping round beef vegetable match empty heart full stomach betak room come worship drop see well spread work cover pink silk brush comb arrangement hero contemplate disgust
