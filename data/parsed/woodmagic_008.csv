2," When he woke next morning, Bevis quite forgot what the squirrel had told him; he jumped out of bed without thinking, and his right foot touched the floor first, and led him to the window. From the window he saw the brook, and recollected that the brook had promised to tell him what he was singing, so as soon as ever he could get out of doors away he went through the gateway the grasshopper had shown him, and down to the hatch. Instead of coming quietly on tip-toe, as the brook had told him, he danced up, and the kingfisher heard him, and went off as before, whistling: ""Weep, weep"". Bevis stood on the brink and said: ""Brook, Brook, what are you singing? You promised to tell me what you were saying.""",wake next morning forget squirrel tell jump bed think right foot touch floor lead window window see brook recollect brook promise tell sing get door go gateway grasshopper show hatch come tip toe brook tell dance kingfisher hear go whistle weep weep stand brink say sing promise tell say 
3,"The brook did not answer, but went on singing. Bevis listened a minute, and then he picked a willow leaf and threw it into the bubbles, and watched it go whirling round and round in the eddies, and back up under the fall, where it dived down, and presently came up again, and the stream took it and carried it away past the flags. ""Brook, Brook,"" said Bevis, stamping his foot, ""tell me what you are singing.""",brook answer go sing listen minute pick willow leaf throw bubble watch go whirl eddie fall dive come stream take carry flag say stamp foot tell sing 
4,"And the brook, having now finished that part of his song, said: ""Bevis dear, sit down in the shadow of the willow, for it is very hot to-day, and the reapers are at work; sit down under the willow, and I will tell you as much as I can remember.""",brook finish part song say dear sit shadow willow hot day reaper work sit willow tell remember

I am so happy I sing, sing, and never think about what it means; it does not matter what you mean as long as you sing. Sometimes I sing about the sun, who loves me dearly, and tries all day to get at me through the leaves and the green flags that hide me; he sparkles on me everywhere he can, and does not like me to be in the shadow. Sometimes I sing to the wind, who loves me next most dearly, and will come to me everywhere, in places where the sun cannot get. He plays with me whenever he can, and strokes me softly, and tells me the things he has heard in the woods and on the hills, and sends down the leaves to float along, for he knows I like something to carry.

They love me like the rest, because I am so happy, and never cease my chanting. If I am broken to pieces against a stone, I do not mind in the least; I laugh just the same, and even louder. When I come over the hatch, I dash myself to fragments; and sometimes a rainbow comes and stays a little while with me. The trees drink me, and the grass drinks me, the birds come down and drink me; they splash me, and are happy. The fishes swim about, and some of them hide in deep corners. Round the bend I go, and the osiers say they never have enough of me. The long grass waves and welcomes me; the moor-hens float with me; the kingfisher is always with me somewhere, and sits on the bough to see his ruddy breast in the water.

""Perhaps it is because all I think of is this minute; I do not know anything about the minute just gone by, and I do not care one bit about the minute that is just coming; all I care about is this minute, this very minute now.

All I know is I shall come back again; yes, I shall come back again."" The brook sang very low, and rather sadly now: ""I shall go into the sea, and shall be lost; and even you would not know me--ask your father, love, he has sailed over the sea in the ships that come to Southampton, and I was close to him, but he did not know me. But by-and-by, when I am in the sea, the sun will lift me up, and the clouds will float along--look towards the hills, Bevis dear, every morning, and you will see the clouds coming and bringing me with them; and the rain and the dew, and sometimes the thunder and the lightning, will put me down again, and I shall run along here and sing to you, my sweet, if you will come and listen.

Bevis dear, try and think and tell me. Am I really happy, Bevis? Tell me, dear; you can see the sun sparkling on me, and the wind stroking me, just as he strokes your hair (he told me he was very fond of you, and meant to tell you a story some day), and the reeds whispering, and the willows drooping over me, and the bright kingfisher; you can hear me singing, Bevis, now am I happy?""",brook sing low sad say come come happy know happy sing dear try think tell happy tell dear see sun sparkling wind stroke stroke hair tell fond mean tell story day reed whisper willow droop bright kingfisher hear sing happy

Now there is no such thing as time, Bevis my love; there never was any time, and there never will be; the sun laughs at it, even when he marks it on the sun-dial. Yesterday was just a second ago, and so was ten thousand years since, and there is nothing between you and then; there is no wall between you and then--nothing at all, dear,""--and the brook sang so low and thoughtfully that Bevis could not catch what he said, but the tune was so sweet, and soft, and sad that it made him keep quite still. While he was listening the kingfisher came back and perched on the hatch, and Bevis saw his ruddy neck and his blue wings.",dear say brook go happen second year same be real division betwixt past person live make sort stupid stupid story dear hope believe tell time be such thing time love be time sun laugh mark sun-dial yesterday second year be be wall dear brook sing low catch say tune sweet soft sad make keep listen kingfisher come perch hatch see ruddy neck blue wing

It shines just the same, as bright and beautiful; and the wind blows as sweet as ever, and I sparkle and sing just the same, and you may drink me if you like; and the grass is just as green; and the stars shine at night. Oh, yes, Bevis dear, _we_ are all here just the same, my love, and all things are as bright and beautiful as ten thousand times ten thousand years ago, which is no longer since than a second.",be brook begin dear story true believe look sun look sun darling shine bright shine same bright beautiful wind blow sweet sparkle sing same drink like grass green star shine night dear same love thing bright beautiful time year second 
38,"""But your people have gone away from us--that is their own fault. I cannot think why they should do so; they have gone away from us, and they are no longer happy, Bevis; they cannot understand our songs--they sing stupid songs they have made up themselves, and which they did not learn of us, and then because they are not happy, they say: 'The world is growing old'. But it is not true, Bevis, the world is not old, it is as young as ever it was. Fling me a leaf--and now another.

39,"""That I will,"" said Bevis; and he picked up a stone and flung it into the water with such a splash that the kingfisher flew away, but the brook only laughed, and told him to throw another, and to make haste and eat the peck of salt, and grow bigger and jump over him. ""That I will,"" said Bevis, ""I am very hungry now--good-morning, I am going home to dinner.""",say pick stone flung water splash kingfisher fly brook laugh tell throw make haste eat peck salt grow big jump say hungry good morning go dinner 
40,"""Good-morning, dear,"" said the brook, ""you will always find me here when you want to hear a song."" Bevis went home to dinner humming the tune the brook had taught him, and by-and-by, when the hot sun had begun to sink a little, he started again for the copse, and as before the dragon-fly met him, and led him to the timber, and from there to the raspberries.",good morning dear say brook find want hear song go dinner hum tune brook teach hot sun begin sink little start copse dragon fly meet lead timber raspberry 
41,"The squirrel was waiting for him on a bough of the oak, and while Bevis picked the fruit that had ripened since yesterday, told him the news the peewits had brought about the great rebel Choo Hoo. A party of the peewits, who had been watching ever so far away, thought they saw a stir and a movement in the woods; and presently out came one of the captains of the wood-pigeons with two hundred of his soldiers, and they flew over the border into King Kapchack's country and began to forage in one of his wheat-fields, where the corn was ripe. When they saw this, the peewits held a council on the hill, and they sent a messenger to Kapchack with the news. While they were waiting for him to return, some of the wood-pigeons, having foraged enough, went home to the woods, so that there was not much more than half of them left.",squirrel wait bough oak pick fruit ripen yesterday tell news peewit bring great rebel party peewit watch think see stir movement wood come captain wood pigeon soldier fly border country begin forage wheat field corn ripe see peewit hold council hill send messenger news wait return wood pigeon forage go wood be much more half leave 
42,"Seeing this--for his soldiers who were wheeling about in the air came and told him--the captain of the peewits thought: ""Now is my time! This is a most lucky and fortunate circumstance, and I can now win the high approval of King Kapchack, and obtain promotion. The captain of the wood-pigeons has no idea how many of us are watching his proceedings, for I have kept my peewits behind the cover of the hill so that he could not count them, and he has allowed half of the wood-pigeons to go home. We will rush down upon the rest, and so win an easy victory.""",see soldier wheel air come tell captain peewit think time lucky fortunate circumstance win high approval obtain promotion captain wood pigeon have idea many watch proceedings keep peewit cover hill count allow half wood pigeon go rush rest win easy victory 
43,"So saying he flew up, and all the peewits followed him in the expectation of an easy conquest. But, just as they were descending upon the wheat-field, up flew the wood-pigeons with such a terrible clangour of their strong wings, and facing towards them, showed such a determination to fight to the last breath, that the peewits, who were never very celebrated for their courage, turned tail, and began to retreat.",say fly peewit follow expectation easy conquest descend wheat field fly wood pigeon terrible clangour strong wing face show determination fight last breath peewit celebrate courage turn tail begin retreat 
44,"They would still have reached the hills in good order, and would have suffered no great disgrace (for they were but a small party, and not so numerous as the wood-pigeons), but in the midst of these manoeuvres, the lieutenant of the pigeons, who had gone home with those who had done foraging, flew out from the wood with his men, and tried by a flank movement to cut off the peewits' retreat. At this they were so alarmed they separated and broke up their ranks, each flying to save himself as best he might. Nor did they stop till long after the wood-pigeons, being cautious and under complete control, had ceased to pursue; not till they had flown back two or three miles into the fastnesses of Kapchack's hills. Then some of them, collecting again, held a hurried council, and sent off messengers with the news of this affray.",reach hill good order suffer great disgrace small party numerous wood pigeon midst manoeuvre lieutenant pigeon go do foraging fly wood man try flank movement cut peewit retreat alarm separate break rank fly save good stop wood pigeon cautious complete control cease pursue fly mile fastness hill collect hold hurry council send messenger news affray 
45,"About the same time, it happened that a missel-thrush arrived at the court, a son of the favourite missel-thrush, the only bird whom Kapchack (and the farmer) allowed to build in the orchard. The missel-thrush had just travelled through part of the country which once belonged to Kapchack, but which Choo Hoo had over-run the year before, and he brought Kapchack such a terrible account of the mighty armies that he saw assembling, that the king was beside himself with terror. Next came a crow, one of Kauc's warriors, who had been that way, and he said that two captains of the wood-pigeons, hearing of the peewits' defeat, had already, and without staying for instructions from Choo Hoo, entered the country and taken possession of a copse on the slope of the hill from which the peewits had descended.",same time happen missel thrush arrive court son favourite missel thrush only bird farmer allow build orchard missel thrush travel part country belong have run year bring terrible account mighty army see assemble king terror come crow warrior way say captain wood pigeon hearing peewit defeat have stay instruction enter country take possession copse slope hill peewit descend 
46,"""And,"" said the squirrel, as Bevis, having eaten all the raspberries, came and sat down on the moss under the oak, ""the upshot of it is that King Kapchack has called a general council of war, which is to be held almost directly at the owl's castle, in the pollard hard by. For you must understand that the farmer who lives near Kapchack's palace is so fierce, he will not let any of the large birds (except the favourite missel-thrush) enter the orchard, and therefore Kapchack has to hold these great councils in the copse. What will be the result I cannot think, and I am not without serious apprehensions myself, for I have hitherto held undisputed possession of this domain. But Choo Hoo is so despotic, and has such an immense army at his back, that I am not at all certain he will respect my neutrality. As for Kapchack, he shivers in his claws at the very name of the mighty rebel.""",say squirrel eat raspberry come sit moss oak upshot call general council war hold owl castle pollard understand farmer live palace fierce let large bird favourite missel thrush enter orchard have hold great council copse result think serious apprehension hold undisputed possession domain despotic have immense army back certain respect neutrality shiver claw very name mighty rebel 
47,"""Why does Choo Hoo want King Kapchack's country?"" said Bevis. ""Why cannot he stop where he is?""",want country say stop 
48,"""There is no reason, dear; but you know that all the birds and animals would like to be king if they could, and when Choo Hoo found that the wood-pigeons (for he was nothing but an adventurer at first, without any title or property except the ancestral ash) were growing so numerous that the woods would hardly hold them, and were continually being increased both by their own populousness and by the arrival of fresh bands, it occurred to him that this enormous horde of people, if they could only be persuaded to follow him, could easily over-run the entire country. Hitherto, it was true, they had been easily kept in subjection, notwithstanding their immense numbers, first, because they had no leaders among them, nor even any nobles or rich people to govern their movements and tell them what to do; and next, because they were barbarians, and totally destitute of art or refinement, knowledge, or science, neither had they any skill in diplomacy or politics, but were utterly outside the civilised nations.",be reason dear know bird animal like king find wood pigeon adventurer first title property ancestral ash grow numerous wood hold increase own populousness arrival fresh band occur enormous horde person persuade follow run entire country true keep subjection notwithstand immense number have leader noble rich person govern movement tell do barbarian destitute art refinement knowledge science have skill diplomacy politics civilised nation 
49,"""Even their language, as you yourself have heard, is very contracted and poor, without inflection or expression, being nothing but the repetition of the same sounds, by which means--that is simply by the number and the depth of hollowness of the same monosyllables--they convey their wishes to each other. It is, indeed, wonderful how they can do so, and our learned men, from this circumstance, have held that the language of the wood-pigeon is the most difficult to acquire, so much so that it is scarce possible for one who has not been born among the barbarians to attain to any facility in the use of these gutturals. This is the reason why little or no intercourse has ever taken place between us who are civilised and these hordes; that which has gone on has been entirely conducted by the aid of interpreters, being those few wood-pigeons who have come away from the main body, and dwell peaceably in our midst.",language hear contract poor inflection expression repetition same sound means number depth hollowness same monosyllable convey wish other wonderful do learn man circumstance hold language wood pigeon difficult acquire scarce possible bear barbarian attain facility use guttural reason little intercourse take place civilised horde go conduct aid interpreter few wood pigeon come main body dwell midst 
50,"""Now, Choo Hoo, as I said, being an adventurer, with no more property than the ancestral ash, but a pigeon of very extraordinary genius, considered within himself that if any one could but persuade these mighty and incredible myriads to follow him he could over-run the entire country. The very absence of any nobles or rich pigeons among them would make his sway the more absolute if he once got power, for there would be none to dispute it, or to put any check upon him. Ignorant and barbarous as they were, the common pigeons would worship such a captain as a hero and a demi-god, and would fly to certain destruction in obedience to his orders.",say adventurer more property ancestral ash pigeon extraordinary genius consider one persuade mighty incredible myriad follow run entire country very absence noble rich pigeon make sway absolute get power be dispute put check ignorant barbarous common pigeon worship captain hero demi-god fly certain destruction obedience order 
51,"""He was the more encouraged to the enterprise because it was on record that in olden times great bodies of pigeons had passed across the country sweeping everything before them. Nothing could resist their onward march, and it is owing to these barbarian invasions that so many of our most precious chronicles have been destroyed, and our early history, Bevis dear, involved in obscurity. Their dominion--destructive as it was--had, however, always passed away as rapidly as it arose, on account of the lack of cohesion in their countless armies. They marched without a leader, and without order, obeying for a time a common impulse; when that impulse ceased they retired tumultuously, suffering grievous losses from the armies which gathered behind and hung upon their rear. Their bones whitened the fields, and the sun, it is said, was darkened at noonday by their hastening crowds fleeing in dense columns, and struck down as they fled by hawks and crows.",encourage enterprise record olden time great body pigeon pass country sweep resist onward march ow barbarian invasion many precious chronicle destroy early history dear involve obscurity dominion destructive pass arise account lack cohesion countless army march leader order obey time common impulse impulse cease retire suffer grievous loss army gather hang rear bone whiten field sun say darken noonday hastening crowd flee dense column strike flead hawk crow 
52,"""Had they possessed a leader in whom they felt confidence the result might have been very different; indeed, our wisest historians express no doubt that civilisation must have been entirely extinguished, and these lovely fields and delicious woods have been wholly occupied by the barbarians. Fortunately it was not so. But, as I said, Choo Hoo, retiring to the top of a lofty fir-tree, and filled with these ideas, surveyed from thence the masses of his countrymen returning to the woods to roost as the sun declined, and resolved to lose no time in endeavouring to win them to his will, and to persuade them to embark upon the extraordinary enterprise which he had conceived.",possess leader feel confidence result different wisest historian express doubt civilisation extinguish lovely field delicious wood occupy barbarian say retire top lofty fir tree fill idea survey mass countryman return wood roost sun decline resolve lose time endeavour win will persuade embark extraordinary enterprise conceive 
53,"""Without delay he proceeded to promulgate his plans, flying from tribe to tribe, and from flock to flock, ceaselessly proclaiming that the kingdom was the wood-pigeons' by right, by reason of their numbers, and because of the wickedness of Kapchack and his court, which wickedness was notorious, and must end in disaster. As you may imagine, he met with little or no response--for the most part the pigeons, being of a stolid nature, went on with their feeding and talking, and took no notice whatever of his orations. After a while the elder ones, indeed, began to say to each other that this agitator had better be put down and debarred from freedom of speech, for such seditious language must ultimately be reported to Kapchack, who would send his body-guards of hawks among them and exact a sanguinary vengeance.",delay proceed promulgate plan fly tribe tribe flock flock proclaim kingdom wood pigeon right reason number wickedness court wickedness notorious end disaster imagine meet little response most part pigeon stolid nature go feeding talking take notice oration while elder one begin say other agitator put debarr freedom speech such seditious language report send body guard hawk exact sanguinary vengeance 
54,"""Finding himself in danger, Choo Hoo, not one whit abashed, instead of fleeing, came before the elders and openly reproached them with misgovernment, cowardice, and the concealment or loss of certain ancient prophecies, which foretold the future power of the wood-pigeons, and which he accused them of holding back out of jealousy, lest they should lose the miserable petty authority they enjoyed on account of their age. Now, whether there were really any such prophecies, I cannot tell you, or whether it was one of Choo Hoo's clever artifices, it is a moot point among our most learned antiquaries; the owl, who has the best means of information, told me once that he believed there was some ground for the assertion.",find danger whit abash flee come elder reproach misgovernment cowardice concealment loss certain ancient prophecy foretell future power wood pigeon accuse hold jealousy lose miserable petty authority enjoy account age be such prophecy tell clever artifice moot point learn antiquary owl have good means information tell believe be ground assertion 
55,"""At any rate it suited Choo Hoo's purpose very well; for although the elders and the heads of the tribes forthwith proceeded to subject him to every species of persecution, and attacked him so violently that he lost nearly all his feathers, the common pigeons sympathised with him, and hid him from their pursuit. They were the more led to sympathise with him because, on account of their ever-increasing numbers, the territory allotted to them by Kapchack was daily becoming less and less suited to their wants, and, in short, there were some signs of a famine. They, therefore, looked with longing eyes at the fertile country, teeming with wheat and acorns around them, and listened with greedy ears to the tempting prospect so graphically described by Choo Hoo.",rate suit purpose elder head tribe proceed subject species persecution attack lose feather common pigeon sympathise hide pursuit lead sympathise account increase number territory allot daily become less suited want short be sign famine look long eye fertile country teem wheat acorn listen greedy ear tempting prospect describe 
56,"""Above all, the young pigeons attached themselves to his fortunes and followed him everywhere in continually increasing bands, for he promised them wives in plenty and trees for their nests without number; for all the trees in their woods were already occupied by the older families, who would not, moreover, part with their daughters to young pigeons who had not a branch to roost on. Some say that the fox, who had long been deeply discontented at the loss of his ancestors' kingdom and of his own wealth, which he dissipated so carelessly, did not scruple to advise Choo Hoo how to proceed. Be that as it may, I should be the last to accuse any one of disloyalty without evident proof; be that as it may, the stir and commotion grew so great among the wood-pigeons, that presently the news of it reached King Kapchack.",young pigeon attach fortune follow increase band promise wife plenty tree nest number tree wood occupy old family part daughter young pigeon have branch roost say fox discontent loss ancestor kingdom own wealth dissipate scruple advise proceed last accuse one disloyalty evident proof stir commotion grow great wood pigeon news reach 
57,"""His spies, of whom he has so many (the chief of them is Te-te, the tomtit, of whom I bid you beware), brought him full intelligence of what was going on. Kapchack lost no time in calling his principal advisers around him; they met close by here (where the council is to take place this afternoon), for he well knew the importance of the news. It was not only, you see, the immense numbers of the wood-pigeons and the impossibility of resisting their march, were they once set in motion, but he had to consider that there was a considerable population of pigeons in our midst who might turn traitors, and he was by no means sure of the allegiance of various other tribes, who were only held down by terror.",spy have many chief tomtit bid beware bring full intelligence go lose time call principal adviser meet council take place afternoon know importance news see immense number wood pigeon impossibility resist march set motion have consider be considerable population pigeon midst turn traitor means sure allegiance various other tribe hold terror 
58,"""The council fully acknowledged the gravity of the situation, and upon the advice of the hawk it was resolved that Choo Hoo, as the prime mover of the trouble, and as the only one capable of bringing matters to a crisis, should be forthwith despatched. But when the executioners proceeded to seize him he eluded their clutches with the greatest ease; for his followers (such was their infatuation) devoted their lives to his, and threw themselves in the way of Kapchack's emissaries, the hawks, submitting to be torn in pieces rather than see their beloved hero lose a feather. Thus baffled, the enraged Kapchack next tried to get him assassinated, but, as before, his friends watched about him with such solicitude that no one could enter the wood where he slept at night without their raising such a disturbance that their evil purpose was defeated.",council acknowledge gravity situation advice hawk resolve prime mover trouble only one capable bring matter crisis despatch executioner proceed seize elude clutch great ease follower such infatuation devote life throw way emissary hawk submitt tear piece see beloved hero lose feather baffle enrage try get assassinate friend watch such solicitude enter wood sleep night raise disturbance evil purpose defeat 
59,"""In his rage Kapchack ordered a decimation of the wood-pigeons, which I myself think was a great mistake; but, as I have told you before, I do not meddle with politics. Still I cannot help thinking that if he had, instead, of his royal bounty and benevolence, given the wood-pigeons an increase of territory, seeing how near they sometimes came to a famine, that they would have been disarmed and their discontent turned to gratitude; but he ordered in his rage and terror that they should be decimated, and let loose the whole army of his hawks upon them, so that the slaughter was awful to behold, and the ground was strewn with their torn and mangled bodies. Yet they remained faithful to Choo Hoo, and not one traitor was found among these loyal barbarians.",rage order decimation wood pigeon think great mistake tell meddle politics help think have royal bounty benevolence give wood pigeon increase territory see come famine disarm discontent turn gratitude order rage terror decimate let lose whole army hawk slaughter awful behold ground strewn torn mangle body remain faithful traitor find loyal barbarian 
60,"""But Choo Hoo, deeply distressed in mind, said that he would relieve them from the burden of his presence rather than thus be the cause of their sorrow. He therefore left those provinces and flew out of the country, leaving word behind him that he would never return till he had seen the raven, and recovered from him those ancient prophecies that had so long been lost. He flew away, and disappeared in the distance; the days and weeks passed, but he did not return, and at last Kapchack, relieved of his apprehensions, recalled his murderous troops, and the pigeons were left in peace to lament their Choo Hoo.",distressed mind say relieve burden presence cause sorrow leave province fly country leave word return see raven recover ancient prophecy lose fly disappear distance day week pass return last relieve apprehension recall murderous troops pigeon leave peace lament 
61,"""A twelvemonth passed, and still Choo Hoo did not come; the people said he had been called to the happy Forest of the Heroes, and averred that sometimes they heard his voice calling to them when no one was near. There was no doubt that he had gone with the raven. The raven, you must know, my dear Sir Bevis, was once the principal judge and arbiter of justice amongst us, so much so that he was above kings, and it is certain that had he been here we should not have had to submit to the sanguinary tyranny of Kapchack, nor condemned to witness the scandalous behaviour of his court, or the still greater scandal of his own private life. But for some reason the raven mysteriously left this country about a hundred years ago, leaving behind him certain prophecies, some of which no doubt you have heard, especially that upon his return there will be no more famine, nor frost, nor slaughter, nor conflict, but we shall all live together in peace.",twelvemonth pass come person say call happy averr hear voice call be doubt go raven raven know dear principal judge arbiter justice king certain have submit sanguinary tyranny condemn witness scandalous behaviour court great scandal own private life reason raven leave country year leave certain prophecy doubt hear return more famine frost slaughter conflict live peace 
62,"""However that may be, the raven has never come back; the learned hold that he must have died long since, for he was so aged when he went away no one knew his years, hinting in their disbelief that he went away to die, and so surround his death with a halo of mystery; but the common people are quite of a different opinion, and strenuously uphold the belief that he will some day return. Well, as I told you, a twelvemonth went by, and Choo Hoo did not come, when suddenly in the spring (when Kapchack himself was much occupied in his palace, and most of his spies were busy with their nests, and the matter had almost been forgotten) Choo Hoo reappeared, bringing with him the most beautiful young bride that was ever beheld, as he himself was, on the other hand, the strongest and swiftest of the wood-pigeons.",raven come learn hold die aged go know year hint disbelief go die surround death halo mystery common person different opinion uphold belief day return tell twelvemonth go come spring occupy palace most spy busy nest matter forget reappear bring beautiful young bride beheld other hand strong swiftest wood pigeon 
63,"""When this was known (and the news spread in a minute) the enthusiasm of the barbarians knew no bounds. Notwithstanding it was nesting-time, they collected in such vast numbers that the boughs cracked with their weight; they unanimously proclaimed Choo Hoo emperor (for they disdained the title of king as not sufficiently exalted), and declared their intention, as soon as the nesting-time was over, and the proper season--the autumn--for campaigning arrived, of following him, and invading the kingdom of Kapchack.",know news spread minute enthusiasm barbarian know bound nest time collect such vast number bough crack weight proclaim emperor disdain title king exalt declare intention nest time proper season autumn campaigning arrive follow invade kingdom 
64,"""Choo Hoo told them that, after many months of wandering, he had at last succeeded in finding the raven; at least he had not seen the raven himself, but the raven had sent a special messenger, the hawfinch, to tell him to be of good cheer, and to return to the wood-pigeons, and to lead them forth against Kapchack, who tottered upon his throne; and that he (the raven) would send the night-jar, or goat-sucker, with crooked and evil counsels to confound Kapchack's wisdom. And indeed, Bevis, my dear, I have myself seen several night-jars about here, and I am rather inclined to think that there is some truth in this part at least of what Choo Hoo says; for it is an old proverb, which I daresay you have heard, that when the gods design the destruction of a monarch they first make him mad, and what can be more mad than Kapchack's proposed marriage with the jay, to which he was doubtless instigated by the night-jars, who, like genii of the air, have been floating in the dusky summer twilight round about his palace?",tell many month wonder last succeed find raven least see raven raven send special messenger hawfinch tell good cheer return wood pigeon lead totter throne raven send night jar goat sucker crooked evil counsel confound wisdom dear have see several night jar inclined think be truth part least say old proverb daresay hear god design destruction monarch make mad mad propose marriage jay instigate night jar genii air float dusky summer twilight palace 
65,"""And they have, I really believe, confounded his council and turned his wisdom to folly; for Kapchack has been so cunning for so many, many years, and all his family have been so cunning, and all his councillors, that now I do believe (only I do not meddle with politics) that this extreme cunning is too clever, and that they will overreach themselves. However, we shall see what is said at the council by-and-by.",believe confound council turn wisdom folly cunning many many year family cunning councillor believe meddle politics extreme cunning clever overreach see say council 
66,"""Choo Hoo, having told the pigeons this, added that he had further been instructed by the raven to give them a sacred and mystic pass-word and rallying cry; he did not himself know what it meant; it was, however, something very powerful, and by it they would be led to victory. So saying, he called 'Koos-takke!' and at once the vast assembly seized the signal and responded 'Koos-takke!' which mystic syllables are now their war-cry, their call of defiance, and their welcome to their friends. You may often hear them shouting these words in the depths of the woods; Choo Hoo learnt them in the enchanted Forest of Savernake, where, as every one knows, there are many mighty magicians, and where, perhaps, the raven is still living in its deep recesses. Now this war-cry supplied, as doubtless the raven had foreseen, the very link that was wanting to bind the immense crowd of wood-pigeons together. Thenceforward they had a common sign and pass-word, and were no longer scattered.",tell pigeon add instruct raven give sacred mystic pass word rallying cry know mean powerful lead victory say call takke vast assembly seize signal respond takke mystic syllable war cry call defiance welcome friend hear shouting word depth wood learn enchanted one know be many mighty magician raven live deep recesse war cry supply raven forese very link want bind immense crowd wood pigeon have common sign pass word scatter 
67,"""In the autumn Choo Hoo crossed the border with a vast horde, and although Kapchack sent his generals, who inflicted enormous losses, such as no other nation but the barbarians could have sustained, nothing could stay the advance of such incredible numbers. After a whole autumn and winter of severe and continued fighting, Choo Hoo, early in the next year, found that he had advanced some ten (and in places fifteen) miles, giving his people room to feed and move. He had really pushed much farther than that, but he could not hold all the ground he had taken for the following reason. In the spring, as the soft warm weather came, and the sun began to shine, and the rain to fall, and the brook to sing more sweetly, and the wind to breathe gently with delicious perfume, and the green leaves to come forth, the barbarians began to feel the influence of love.",autumn cross border vast horde send general inflict enormous loss such other nation barbarian sustain stay advance such incredible number whole autumn winter severe continue fighting next year find advance place mile give person room feed move push far hold ground take follow reason spring soft warm weather come sun begin shine rain fall brook sing wind breathe delicious perfume green leave come barbarian begin feel influence love 
68,"""They could no longer endure to fly in the dense column, they no longer obeyed the voice of their captain. They fell in love, and each marrying set about to build a nest, free and unmolested in those trees that Choo Hoo had promised them. Choo Hoo himself retired with his lovely bride to the ancestral ash, and passed the summer in happy dalliance. With the autumn the campaign recommenced, and with exactly the same result. After a second autumn and winter of fighting, Choo Hoo had pushed his frontier another fifteen miles farther into Kapchack's kingdom. Another summer of love followed, and so it went on year after year, Choo Hoo's forces meantime continually increasing in numbers, since there were now no restrictions as to nest trees, but one and all could marry.",endure fly dense column obey voice captain fall love marrying set build nest free unmolested tree promise retire lovely bride ancestral ash pass summer happy dalliance autumn campaign recommence same result second autumn winter fighting push frontier mile kingdom summer love follow go year year force increase number be restriction nest tree marry 
69,"""Till at last he has under his sway a horde of trained warriors, whose numbers defy calculation, and he has year by year pushed into Kapchack's territory till now it seems as if he must utterly overwhelm and destroy that monarch. This he would doubtless have achieved ere now, but there is one difficulty which has considerably impeded his advance, as he came farther and farther from his native province. This difficulty is water.",last have sway horde train warrior number defy calculation have year year push territory seem overwhelm destroy monarch achieve be difficulty imped advance come native province difficulty water

Were it not for this Choo Hoo must ere now have overwhelmed us. As it is, Kapchack shivers in his claws, and we all dread the approaching autumn, for Choo Hoo has now approached so near as to be at our very doors. If he only knew one thing he would have no difficulty in remaining here and utterly destroying us.""",winter long freeze brook cover ice pond ditch vast horde find satisfy thirst disperse overwhelm shiver claw dread approach autumn approach very door know thing have difficulty remain destroy

72,"""Will you promise faithfully not to tell any one?"" said the squirrel, ""for my own existence depends upon this horde of barbarians being kept at bay; for, you see, should they pass over they will devour everything in the land, and there will certainly be a famine--the most dreadful that has ever been seen.""",promise tell one say squirrel own existence depend horde barbarian keep bay see pass devour land be famine dreadful see

74,"""Then I will tell you,"" went on the squirrel. ""In this copse of mine there is a spring of the clearest and sweetest water (you shall see it, I will take you to it some day) which is a great secret, for it is so hidden by ferns and fir-trees overhanging it, that no one knows anything about it, except Kapchack, myself, the weasel, and the fox; I wish the weasel did not know, for he is so gluttonous for blood, which makes him thirsty, that he is continually dipping his murderous snout into the delicious water.",tell go squirrel copse be spring clearest sweetest water see take day great secret hide fern fir tree overhang know weasel fox wish weasel know gluttonous blood make thirsty dip murderous snout delicious water 
75,"""Now this spring, being so warm in the fern, and coming out of ground which is, in a manner, warm too, of all the springs in this province does not freeze, but always runs clear all the winter. If Choo Hoo only knew it, don't you see, he could stay in Kapchack's country, no matter how hard the frost, and his enormous army, whose main object is plunder, would soon starve us altogether. But he does not know of it.",spring warm fern come ground manner warm spring province freeze run clear winter know see stay country matter frost enormous army main object plunder starve know 
76,"""He has sent several of his spies, the wood-cocks, to search the country for such a spring, but although they are the most cunning of birds at that trick, they have not yet succeeded in finding my spring and thrusting their long bills into it. They dare not come openly, but fly by night, for Kapchack's hawks are always hovering about; well enough he knows the importance of this secret, and they would pay for their temerity with their lives if they were seen. All I am afraid of is lest the weasel or the fox, in their eagerness for empire, should betray the secret to Choo Hoo.",send several spy wood cock search country spring cunning bird trick succeed find spring thrust long bill come fly night hawk hover know importance secret pay temerity life see afraid weasel fox eagerness empire betray secret 
77,"""The fox, though full of duplicity, and not to be depended upon, is at least brave and bold, and so far as I can judge his character would not, for his own sake (hoping some day to regain the kingdom), let out this secret. But of the weasel I am not so sure; he is so very wicked, and so cunning, no one can tell what he may do. Thus it is that in the highest of my beech trees I do not feel secure, but am in continual fear lest a wood-cock should steal in, or the weasel play the traitor, for if so a famine is imminent, and that is why I support, so far as I can without meddling with politics, the throne of Kapchack, as the last barrier against this terrible fate.",fox full duplicity depend least brave bold judge character own sake hope day regain kingdom let secret weasel sure wicked cunning tell do high beech tree feel secure continual fear wood cock steal weasel play traitor famine imminent support meddle politics throne last barrier terrible fate 
78,"""Even now could he but be brought to reform his present life something might be hoped for, for he has a powerful army; but, as you have seen, this affair with the jay has caused ambitious ideas to spring up in the minds of his chief courtiers, some of whom (especially, I think, the crow and the weasel) are capable of destroying a country for their private and personal advantage. Therefore it is that I look forward to this council, now about to be held, with intense anxiety, for upon it will depend our future, the throne of Kapchack, our existence or destruction.
